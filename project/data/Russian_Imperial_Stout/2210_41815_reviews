"This vintage of parabola is coming off a little hot, which it don't quite remember any of their barrel beers being, but this is a super fresh bottle of a 14% abv beer! should be expected."
""
""
""
""
"Having had Parabola 3 years in a row, it can do no wrong. Well worth obtaining or trading for."
""
"Just consumed a 2015.   Started out chilled; as it warmed it got so much better.    Loved it; glad that I have 3 more that I'm aging!"
"Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing Amazing!!! Enough said!!!"
"Smooth pleasant taste and feel. Nice aroma with minimal head."
"I normally hate FS beers. But this one is just great! Very balanced, nice kick, great warm or cold. Just beautiful."
""
"Perfect example of the style; this is the gold standard that all RIS beers should be held to. Right there with Abyss"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good thing I bought a bunch of them!!"
""

""

"Better than 2014 (in my opinion). 2014 was very bourbon-y, too much so, with not enough carbonation and less lacing. 2015 seems to be perfectly balanced, super heavy bourbon nose, but could not be more balanced upon tasting. Just a wonderful beer, and oh so glad I have more. Will be interesting to taste side by side with the 2013 and 2014 that has had some time to settle in."

"This lived up to all the hype for me. It was simply the best BA beer I've had and possibly the best stout I've had. I would love to try a '13 or '14 for perspective, but the '15 was brilliant."
"Amazing. Easily best beer I have ever had."
"O.   An excellent beer.   Every aspect.  If there was something to nitpick at and I would have to,  to say much is wrong with this beer it would be the lacing.   It's a bit spotty.   But everything else is pretty top notch. Get this beer and enjoy it!"
"EXCELLENT !!! This was nice and tasty"
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – This went down easy for 13%abv.  Very nice!"
""

"Overall: I wish this was available back home."

"Pours a dark, dark [bordering on black] brown with slight auburn on the edges and a very thin mocha head. The smell is very classy and subtle. Vanilla, molasses, dried figs, dried cherries, chocolate, the bourbon is present but not overwhelming, there is a subtle hint of alcohol but it adds a little warmth instead of distracting. The flavor is exquisite. Toffee, vanilla, chocolate, mocha. With a nice thick mouthfeel that coats the tongue. This is the most subtle yet perfect BBA Stout I've ever had."
""
"Best most balanced and amazing BA Imperial Stout there is."
""

""
""
"Great beer. Cant want wait to taste it in a year."
""
""
""
""
"2012 vintage. This is the best beer I've ever had. Perfect across the board. Got this in a trade, hope the 2015 is anywhere close to this."

""
""
""
"Had this saved for my 40th bday (2014 version) this past week.  Was a great beer.  The alcohal didn't punch me in the face as much as BCBS does.  Very smooth and cant wait for 2015..."

"A quick unfocused review. This beer delivered...completely lived up to the hype. It's up there with BCBS among my favorite bourbon barrel aged stouts. Immense, chewy, roasty, delicious, but still true to its RIS base. Just wonderful."

"Just having this 2013 now...the hype is real...just amazing...let it sit..."

"2013 ages better than I though would (wow!!!!!!!) liked it fresh better with age"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very well worth the place it holds as one of the best stouts out there! I think this one kicks Bourbon County out of the room. Its not boozy considering the similar abv whereas Bourbon County is very alcoholic in flavor and pretty one sided. This beer is really what most bourbon barrel aged stouts should try to achieve."
""
"Overall- The first time a met her we made love all night. I told myself not to jump straight into the sack with this and build respect for a well founded relationship. But I couldn't help myself. My animal magnetism took over and I did what felt right. I'm thankful she still answers the phone when I call."
"This is a pretty good beer."

"On a tap @ Toronado all 3 awesome but Parabola takes the cske!!!"
"Overall, this is an exceptional offering.  What a few days it has been for us!!  Yesterday we got to enjoy Firestone’s other coveted rarity, §ucaba, and less than twenty-four hours later, we have the supreme pleasure of tackling Parabola.  This pairing has really helped put the landscape of barreling into perspective for us, and have, in part, reestablished where the bar should sit.  From the moment you open the bottle the aroma is already settling into your nasal mucosa, even at a distance.  It highlights some of the most authentic and warming oaky butters we’ve experienced to date, effectively setting the stage for a decidedly serious beer.  With this in mind, the first sip takes you a bit by surprise.  There is so much cloying sweetness to it.  Thankfully, this is transient, and only serves to shock the palate before the real complexity of the flavor begins to settle in.  The final blend is intensely bittering, with primary contributions from the deeply burnt malt bill, the wood, and the booze.  It is simply succulent and wonderfully savory.  If you are going to force us to complain about one thing, it would be the feel.  It was by no means poor, but felt, at times, lacking in substance and creaminess compared to what you’d expect for the style, and for such a big beer.  As we watch the next winter storm creep towards us on the radar, we are thankfully for such a beer to keep us warm through the evening.  This beer should be on everyone’s list, if it isn’t already."

"Beautiful, perfect in every way you want a barrel aged stout to be."

"This may be my favorite beer of all time. The mouthfeel is second to none. There's a thick, oatmeal quality to it. The flavor begins nutty, malty and chocolately and effervesces into a complex mixture of tobacco, dried fruits, malt, chocolate, booze, wood - amazingly complex and very drinkable. I wish I could scrooge mc duck into a pool of this beer."

"2013 bottle.  very thin mouthfeel, almost barleywine-like"

"Dark chocolate syrup with lots of wood in the finish. Outstanding"
""
""
""
""
"O-flavors and aroma just not coming through for me.  Beer seems to be well balance as no one flavor dominates........sweetness lingers a bit.........alcohol is noticeable but a bit tame for the ABV"
"O- I find this beer to be right up there with Black Note and BCBS, very similar flavor and mouthfeel, maybe slightly sweeter than the other two."
"O- simply a world class RIS, the complexity of this beer is so impressive, and more subtleties are revealing as it warms.  Way too drinkable at 13%, one of my favorites"

"Good, not great BBA Stout. Surprised this one scored so high. Must be the packaging."
""

"This is the beer that started it all for my obsession with craft beers.  Just thinking of this beer makes me want to pull one out of the fridge.  I have a few that I have been ageing."

"Most of the other reviews have already covered and said all there is to say about Parabola. Memories of the aroma and taste often hit me at random times in random places. Potentially one of the greatest beers of all time."

"Pours very dark but not motor oil dark like I like these beers. Smell is intensely sweet bourbon and the taste follows. The beer seems like it would benefit from cellaring at least another year to mellow out."

"Got in a trade with cyde. 22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage, bottled on 3/18/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, oak, bourbon, tobacco, light char, and roast/oak earthiness; with some light alcohol/booze. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and oak barrel notes; with solid strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, bourbon, oak, tobacco, light char, and roast/oaky earthiness. Fair amount of roast/oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, bourbon, oak, tobacco, light char, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. A very slight oak astringency was present but not detrimental. Light-medium carbonation an full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged imperial stout. All around outstanding complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An insanely delicious offering as I expected."

"Overall: after being disappointed by Sucaba and highly disappointed by Velvet Merkin I didn't expect much from this. but this one lives up to every bit of its reputation. a big and nicely decadent ba stout. perfect for the cold winter night, or national stouts day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth, semi-rich, dark as night and lightly carbonated. Dont enjoy this too cold, the alcohol is hidden, let Parabola warm down to expense the true flavors. A great label and a great beer. Super sought after in the places it doesn't make it to and I can see why."
"Dark chocolate and coffee linger on in the aftertaste, with plenty of dark roasted grains.  Very faint burnt toast component."
""
""
""
""
"2013 Vintage. Pours black as motor oil with no head to speak of. Lots of chocolate, bourbon and and roasted malt on the nose. The first thing you notice upon the first sip is just how smooth this beer is. The next thing you notice is how amazingly balanced this beer is. Firestone Walker has a world class barrel program, keep up the great work!"

"As for the Parabola.  Wow, a flavor bomb!  It is as impressive of a beer as you will ever have.  Nuff said."
""
"By far the most balanced stout I've ever had the chance to wrap my lips around. Toasty, malty, rich, chocolatey, coffee, all perfectly entwined. A 2013 aged for 1 year before sharing with some great friends."

""

""

"Poured a dark thick black with instant aroma of bourbon. Heavy oak, bourbon, and tobacco smell. Thick sticky viscosity. Instant flavor of dark chocolate that lasts and lasts. Some nuttiness as well. Not as big of a bourbon taste. This guy is very well balanced and very delicious."

"Quite possibly the best Russian Imperial Stout ever."
""

"O: 4.75 This is a superb stout. You can tell that the base beer is high quality and the bourbon really adds to it rather than covering up flaws. I would like to compare this to BCBS, but in truth they are quite different. This is a bit more roasty, bitter, and less sweet with surprisingly fruity flavors that balance out all the richness. I once did a side-by-side with a 2013 of each, and the BCBS was the clear winner, but there’s something really special about this 2014, so I might have to give it another shot ☺."
""
"Taste is rich and back to basics vs. the aroma.  Lots of rich dark malts, some cherry and fig, along with a touch of wood at the end of a rather long finish.  Offers a spritzy carbonation which is more than expected given the light foam on the pour.  Rich and full in feel without being overbearing and a hint of vanilla on the finish.  Solid stuff with a couple years on it..."

"2015 - All of the above + caramelize sugar, vanilla, and breadiness.  Everything is superbly balanced.  BCBS is more rich, but this has a more complex and intricate smell, taste, and feel.  This is a winner."

"Notes: Tragically, this bottle was heat damaged from a loss of power to the fridge. There was a strong smell of soy and it was found in the flavor to a lesser extent. I did my review of the beer omitting those flavors, and graded it accordingly, but I will cellar need to rereview this at a later time."

""

""

"2011 bottle that is jet black with brown hues on the edge.  There is minimal carb.  Mouthfeel is smooth and slick.  Not a big chewy body on this one.  It's really smooth and there is still a little bit of heat on this that warms the mouth.  No real standout flavor for me.  There's some roast, oak, and vanilla but the bourbon is the spotlight.  Outstanding BA stout."
"Old BA score: 4.60"
"Dark black color, thin mocha head. Coffee, chocolate pretzel, chocolate malt taste. thick silky body. Light hop presence, oaky vanilla character, fat beer."

"Smells and tastes like many another barrel aged stout.  It is quality, but nothing remarkable. Could use a little more carbonation to cut the sickly sweetness.  Too boozy, not enough oak flavor to really be special."
"O: I have to wonder if this beer isn't in the greatest shape given it's scores and reputation. Granted it has some age on it, if cellar'd decently that should have mellowed out some of the harsher qualities. However the malt/roast flavors coming through to me seem stale and or oxidized. Maybe I need to try a fresher example so I can give it a higher score but as it stands.. it didn't do so hot. CW16 is still my favorite BA Stout - I'll stick to that while I have a few left"

"Had just a few quick notes, so i'm sure i didn't get to write down all about this beer, and i'm sure i wouldn't be able either way. There's a huge complexity here (incredible barrel-aging), incredible flavours, setting this one as the best beer i've ever had, without any doubts."
"One of the best beers I have ever had in my life. Poured with a gorgeous, thick, luxurious head which left delicate lacing on my glass. The taste of slightly roasted cocoa nibs and mocha was so smooth I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Smooth, thick, rich, round, yet still clean and refreshing on the finish. I have never had a more perfect beer. I am so glad I have another, because I cannot wait to taste this with some age, I can't even fathom how it could be improved!"
""
""
""
""
"yes fitting words"
"Pours a light brown beer, almost looks like chocolate syrup with water, or watered chocolate. Forms bubbles immediately. Aroma is heady, coffee, chocolate. Taste is very strange. It is a heady beer but it is highly carbonated, and the carbonations tickles the tongue in a way that doesn't let you taste the high alcohol. Very strange feeling. The body is very light, not a heavy beer."
""
""
"Amazing aromas and flavors. This is a little thinner in body and more carbonated than I expected. Goes down scary smooth considering the 13% ABV. World class."

"Drank at a bottle share alongside Black Xantas and KBS. Parabola definitely holds up next to these beers even though I think KBS edges it out slightly. I enjoyed the info on the label and was surprised how high the IBUs are for not seeming too hoppy. Definitely recommend if you like BA stouts or Imperial Stouts."

"I had done a quick review as a 4.75 but am updating to 5.0 across the board after careful reconsideration. I claim to be an IPA guy but this stuff is perfect. A nice thick strong stout that is overflowing with flavor. Cary strong but you would;t know because it tastes so good."

"O: This is a fantastic imperial stout. Possibly the best I’ve had. Excellent BA character, big body, sweet while also piquantly bitter - There are a lot of elements here that seamlessly coalescence - exhibiting the essentials; roasty malts, sweet warming bourbon, while also presenting a aged resin with a bit of dank earth. Itsss aaaa parrrabbbboooolaaaa. Get some."

"O: After almost a year, still a phenomenal beer. I think I'm finding out that I actually prefer Parabola from fresh to just under a year in age, but even with those bottles that I've enjoyed slightly less I have had no real complaints. My favorite parts about this (and most of FW's barrel-aged beers) are the coconut and vanilla notes, so I strongly prefer enjoying this while they are still present."

"Overall: a hyped up barrel aged stout that deserves the hype. Its balanced and still hasn't complete lost the coffee and it hasn't distorted the beer either. I thoroughly enjoyed the 2014 fresh. The flavors come out real well. Firestone makes ba beers that drink really well fresh which I appreciate although this is more balanced with zero alcohol presence. Fresh smells a lot better too. Overall a difficult beer to review because time changes this a lot for the better."
""
"O: Let me start out by saying I'd be lying through my teeth if I said this wasn't a great BA RIS. It presents an excellent bourbon character and a depth others in the style lack. However, it's just too harsh to be world-class in my mind. Still, I'm really intrigued over aging my other bottle for a year to see how it develops."

"To start I am trying the 2014 vintage and I admit that stouts aren't my preferred style, but I do like trying new things and I do attempt to expand my horizons. That being said, I just didnt really care for this. I found it overwhelmingly sweet. My first sip I immediately get the bourbon, followed by chocolate. The oak and coffee begin to creep in after a couple of sips but sweetness is dominate. The mouth feel is a bit heavy for my preference, but not off-putting necessarily. I can appreciate the number of flavors and the balance of those flavors but this is just not for me. Kind of reminds me a little of a barley wine, maybe I'm way off on that, I dont know. I would say if you know you dont like this style but you are trying it because of the hype (like I did) then save your money and save the bottle for someone that will enjoy it."

"I'm hard pressed to say this isn't the best beer i've ever had. in my opinion the only beer I enjoy entering my chambers as much is Bourbon County Coffee, Cherry Rye, or Proprietors. I'm speaking about a cold night on a porch. This isn't fair because I drank this 2014 Parabola on the edge of a wall next to a beautiful girl, feet in the bay, 7 beers deep (and then remembered I brought Parabola). Set and Setting, this was the best beer I've ever had. It is unreal. Its like this elixir, it has the same mouthfeel as homegrown mountain Dew. It is unbelievable, unbeatable, and it is firestone walker."
"Good God!! This is as close to a meal in a bottle as you will find, ANYWHERE. If you taste this without food on the palate, it comes across as deceptively minorly-boozy. Once any type of food hits the palate, the booziness comes through in a BIG way and this will kick your ass. For SURE a sipping beer, not just for the $/mL but for the mouthfeel if nothing else. A meal in a bottle and hard to match anywhere.."
"The beer was poured into a snifter glass and the first glance offered up one dark beauty of a beer. Mostly black with hints of brown on the edge when hit by the right lighting. No head to speak of just a slight mocha ring around the top and virtually no lacing as well. Smells of, well, bourbon. Some vanilla, aged oak, dark coffee, and some espresso also join in with the abundance of bourbon. Taste is great with the hints of the above mentioned with bourbon being the most pronounced flavor for me. Very well done mouthfeel that coats the palate and is very smooth. I found Parabola to be moderately sweet and extremely easy to drink, but a sipper with that high abv. I really enjoyed this aged stout tremendously and it was amazing to get a hold of this masterpiece . Highly recommended!"

"2013 reserve, poured in a snifter. The beer is jet black, with a light halo of off-white head. Pours very thick and smooth. Aromas are spilling out of this snifter from a good distance; this is a beast. Very rich molasses, vanilla, bourbon, woody notes, chocolate, and toffee notes provide huge layers on your sense of smell. Throughout the layers, you pick up hints of licorice, cream, cherry, tobacco, smoke and char. This smells great. Flavors are very rich, with a blast of char, bitter and roasted coffee, bitter dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, and heavy booze notes. This is a blast on your palate. The more you drink, more flavor profiles reveal themselves, including tobacco, peat, earthy notes, and smoke. This is heavy. The body is robust, smooth, and full, like old motor oil, which is the perfect body to support this cavalcade of flavors. Rich, thickly sweet aftertaste of coffee, chocolate, and molasses, this remains heavy from start to finish. The finish is thick, smooth, and lingering. This beer keeps you on the ropes from the moment you open the bottle, and I personally loved every second of it."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a black body with small tan head and a lace ring that never left the glass. I pick up not only booze in the aroma but dark fruits like raisins, figs, plum(?), some bourbon and wood as well as a little sweetness. A very heavy, boozy beer that is great but definitely made sure I could only have one. Thick, not sticky but this is going to leave some beer remnants on your tongue, a little heat on the finish and this beer actually benefits from a woodiness to keep it flowing smooth. As for tastes I pick up the dark fruits which is still mostly figs and raisins and again I swear a hint of plum, possible black cherry, all combining with a vanilla-like bourbon sweetness that is wonderfully balanced."
""
""
""
"2014 bomber poured a brownish black into a snifter with a finger of dark tan head. Smell is sweet with raisins, plums and some molasses on the nose. Taste is similarly sweet with some fruit- raisins and cherries- up front, and some milk chocolate that follows, with a touch of bitter chocolate at the end. Everything gets more intense as it warms. Carries the 14 % ABC very well. Mouthfeel is light but oily, leaves it's mark, but with a nice carbonation. Very similar to BCBS coffee in taste. Expensive, but you see where your money went."
""
""
" I Understand why they charge so much. Well whatever they charge, the distributor upcharges, and the store upcharges. Its a great brew. Hands down. Oh and I forgot to mention, nice kiss of bitterness in the finish and and nice mellow carbo..."

"KBS is still my favorite barrel aged stout. However, this is one of my favorite still. Under Bourbon County Coffee, but above the regular version. So freaking smooth, wonderful barrel age character, just an amazing and delicious."
""
""
""
"O-Overall this was a fantastic beer! Definitely was glad to have dessert with it. Peanut butter pie + parabola = heaven!"
""
""
"Incredibly complex BBA Stout. Not as thick and chewy as BCBS, but with deeper character and flavor. IMO a step above KBS. Can't wait to see how age mellows the bourbon heat in this beauty."
""
"Insanely delicious. Bourbon forward, yet as it warms, the chocolate and coffee flavors come through. An amazing sipper of a beer in the same category as BCBS. Lots of vanilla flavors, great at first taste, but better on last. The smells are consistent with the taste and are nearly perfect. Full bodied and absolutely beautiful in the glass, with nice head and pitch black body. So glad I was able to score some on tap when I was least expecting it. Life is good."

"Overall, this is a rich, smooth, flavorful imperial stout with plenty of flair for the bourbon fans. With that said, it doesn't quite live up to its exceedingly lofty hype in my estimation. There are more balanced imperial stouts, barrel-aged or otherwise, that don't lean so heavily on a nearly candied sweetness."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I may have found an Imperial Stout that can unseat The Abyss from my top spot. This is an amazing beer, especially if you like a big, sticky mouthfeel. The roasted malts and grains are much less sharp than in some other examples of the style, but instead very rich and really blend well with the barrel character. Absolutely amazing."

"O - A sipper through and through, this beer was a journey, a genuine undertaking at over two hours of drinking. I normally drink pretty quickly, so this was unprecedented. I'll be aging my remaining bottles to see if time can mellow the booziness and the bourbon, allowing the subtler elements and deeply buried characteristics to shine. Nonetheless this was a highly impressive beer which is either a little rough around the ages or as yet still raw. Time will tell."

"O - Very pleased with this beer after all the buzz from my coworkers and the price. IMHO, as much I revere high alcohol content, and Parabola does a great job at dancing with its %14, I feel the flavours could ring a little stronger around %10."

""

"O - 5 - I've heard this is the best of all the batches so far. I can't argue with that. Probably THE best barrel aged imperial stout that I've had. Hands down amazing."
""
""
""
"Overall, just a fantastically rich and wonderful barrel aged stout. It's not as thick as I really like my RIS' to be, but I'm honestly quite impressed at the body considering the barrel aging. Firestone Walker really knows what they are doing when it comes to their barrel program. It's just too bad everyone knows that, making their brews hard to come by here in Kansas City."
""
""
""
"Overall: I struggled with the bourbon aroma and flavor, the low carbonation but when this beer is consumed it's world class. It's an awesome sipper, I sipped mine for about 40 minutes. It's a must try. I am hoping to pick another bottle to cellar and see what it likes in a year or two."

"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
"This is an outstanding beer, that's brewed in small batches, and has a high alcohol content. I pours dark brown, medium sized mocha head, and vivacious carbonation. It has a taste of Kentucky bourbon, Tabaco, and the finest roasted coffee beans. It has a strong edge, with an aftertaste of chocolate and bourbon, and leaves you wanting another sip. This is one to enjoy...."
"This is a stout that completely lives up to its hype. Excellent and very different fresh. Apparently with many, many years left for aging. A masterpiece."

"Overall – Big, robust, massively sweet, and warming. This is a nice imperial stout. A little sweeter then I would want on any real occasion, but this one makes a dessert all in itself, being quite nice for a capper to an evening after dinner on a cooler winter night."

"Parabola came out on top in my recent 8 beer tasting, beating out 7 of Firestone Walker's other top beers. Out of the seven BA guys we had at the tasting, Parabola got the highest marks for look, smell, taste, mouthfeel and overall. We had a pretty even split of tasters who liked IPA's to those who liked belgians and porters, and those who liked stouts. So to come out on top was pretty impressive for this stout."

"Part of a special ""barrel"" week at The Beer Junction. $3.60 for a 4oz pour, listed as 13.0% ABV. Opaque, black color with a tan head. Aroma was roasty (borderline burnt smell), picked up on the alcohol and bourbon. Flavor was really potent and bitter. It was thin and didn't leave any lace. Very strong bourbon aftertaste. This was part of a 4 beer sampler (all barrel aged) and I would say it came in 3rd. Definitely not bad and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"I broke out a 2013 Parabola for the kickoff of Super Bowl XLVIII. The Parabola poured a dark brown/black with a thin off-white head. The smell was simply tremendous. I picked up lots of dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and bourbon on the nose. It was one of those beers that I just couldn't stop smelling it between sips. The flavor of the beer lived up to and perhaps even exceeded its incredible scent. The taste made me think of a slightly undercooked dark chocolate fudge caramel brownie a la mode with vanilla bean bourbon ice cream. There were also some notes of roasted coffee beans. Its rich and decadent flavors were a perfect match for its smooth, velvety, creamy mouthfeel. I thought that the 13% ABV was rather well-disguised for the style. An absolute pleasure to drink in every way possible. Insanely delicious. 2013 Parabola is definitely an all-timer for me. Firestone Walker has blown me away yet again with their barrel-aged releases."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- As the label says, ""a one-of-a-kind sipping beer""."
""
""
""
"I wish it was not a limited release so I wouldn't have to drop $$$ to get a good supply of it. Firestone is the reason I started to get involved with the whole beer advocacy. This beer was so smooth with the hints of coffee and the barrel aged. It was beautifully crafted almost being able to take the strands of oak that caressed the individual molecules it touched. Ok maybe that's taking it a little far, but it made me fall in love with beer all over again."
""
""
"taste/overall - this takes the cake for me. there are many others right behind. But the year and a half of aging on this keg did wonders. Cannot reccomend an aged Parabola enough. so many flavors going on that all work in harmony with a perfect touch of barrel aging. you can taste the alcohol, but it is not hot at all. molasses, burnt sugar, malt, chocolate, dark figs. I have had most of the Firestone offerings and knew it would be good, but this aged version I could have drank for hours. bravo."

"Overalls - adding my voice to the general consensus of this beer's epic awesomeness; a bomber is almost too much to enjoy alone, but I'll make the sacrifice; a beer that welcomes reflection after each sip; well worth the price even if you're outside the distribution zone"
""
""
"Holy Fock!! Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Deep, dark pour. Virtually zero head, but nice even lacing with infinite bubbles. I almost trembled as I brought the glass to my nose, but the reward was remarkable. Licorice and chocolate dominate both the nose and the palate, but the taste is literally intoxicating. Upon the palate, the bourbon chocolate is phenomenally drawing and absorbing, warm and inviting, and consistently sensual. Mere words cannot possibly describe just how innocently lustful this brew envelops the senses. Both the nose and the mouthfeel expression are intoxicating. Pure rapture in a bottle. I so stunned that I cannot possibly do justice to the experience, except to say that when you get here you will understand what I mean. Pure nirvana..."

"This beer is damn near perfect, and the only drawback I could see would be the booziness. However, at 13% abv that is somewhat expected, and for me it didn't detract too much away from the enjoy-ability of the beer. At the front there is a dark chocolate bitterness with some coffee and booze, and on the back end it gets a lot smoother and creamier. Definitely can get the bourbon notes from the beer as well which comes across with nice molasses flavor and slight vanilla. Overall, if you don't mind booze in a beer( which lightens as it warms up) then this beer is a great choice. Great balance of sweetness and bitterness, and its definitely a must try. (98/100)"

"A very good beer here but a little over rated because of the alcohol in it. I have tried it multiple years and it just doesn't do it for me. I can understand how people can like it. It just isn't my thing. The smell is really good, and the appearance is amazing almost like motor oil. It is just a lot of booze flavor and to big of a beer to sit and drink."
"Agree with many of the observations of Stevedore here. It is not particularly thick, moderately carbonated. Owing perhaps to the predominance of the bourbon on the palate, it is lacking the alegasmic ""fudginess"" of Baudoinia (or even the 2012 BCBS I sampled on tap last weekend). It is not as creamy or smooth as Black Note. Way too much bourbon, even at 2+ years."

"Poured a deep brown/black with a slight red tinge when held to light and a thin ring of off-white head. Not as pure black as some Imperial Stouts, but beautiful. Scents of oak, coconut, bourbon, faint coffee hints of alcohol and a bit of sweetness. Very nice, definitely an oak aged RIS, rich and boozy. I love it. Flavor starts with roast malt, black coffee, oak, bourbon and sweet malt, with very faint hints of alcohol. The finish brings forth bittersweet cocoa, sweet chocolate and alcohol that carry into the aftertaste. Very good. Deep and strong in flavor, with all the notes of barrel aging and a good RIS as well. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, a smooth feeling and a slight hint of alcohol burn. Very easy to drink, hiding the 13% ABV quite well. Overall this is an excellent RIS. It's got the nice barrel aged quality and the core strengths of the style to carry it and it is just plain wonderful to drink."

"This beer would be a great candidate to age. I had the 2013 Vintage and although it was very good, it had a little too much of the roastiness that I don't love in fresh imperial stouts. With some time though, my guess is this taste would mellow out allowing some of the other flavors to come through. Overall though, this beer was fantastic as it has a great bourbon smell and taste to help compliment the imperial stout characteristics that are there behind the bourbon."

"O - One of my favorite stouts to date. Still have Dark Lord, Darkness, Berserker, Speedway and a couple others in the cellar to try. Comparable to the Abyss which is at the top of my stout list right now. It makes its way to the top due to the low level or carb, creamy full bodied mouth feel, and the aging has made this beer nearly flawless"

"UPDATE (1/6/2014): Damn the hype! This is amazing stuff, no doubt, but after pitting it in a bourbon barrel stout blind tasting some time ago, this didn't even make the top. Very sweet compared to other offerings of its kind, but perhaps the best one that's easy to get. Gets a lot of those bourbon sweet oak notes that I find a little difficult to wade through. This is best fresh - once it loses that roasted character, it gets a little too putrid, herbal, and sweet. Still, phenomenal stuff, but let's not forget to be objective even about our favorite beers."

"This beer confused me. All the hype I've read had me expecting something different. This is just too intense for me. Maybe years from now my pallet will develop to like this one. I love imperial stouts. In fact I prefer them, but there is something going on with this that I couldn't even finish it. Funny thing is, I think I'm the only one."
""
"Black pour with small brown head and patchy lacing. The aroma is rich with roasted malts, dark chocolate, burnt wood and light bourbon. Similar flavor with some vanilla, light coffee and faint dark fruits. It hides the alcohol rather well. Full body with a soft and smooth velvety feel. An excellent sipper and a truly incredible beer."

"I like that this isn’t overly Bourbon influenced, it is a bit hot & boozy in the end, but what can you expect from a 13% beer. Still, this does achieve a fair amount of balance in the end and is a nice way to cap off a long day; though I certainly wouldn’t want to try and finish off a whole 22oz bottle."

"Overall, a very good barrel-aged imperial stout that's relatively readily available on the shelf at a solid price point. It showcases the bourbon, but not as well as a beer like Central Waters' Fifteen does.. but then again this is a shelf beer! I guess that ""showcasing bourbon"" thing is not enough to impress me these days.. plenty of BA stouts do a good job of that already. I just would like the base beer to stand out more in these types of beers. Otherwise, you might as well splash some bourbon in a non-BA stout. That being said, it's a good example of a bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout so don't let my opinion prevent you from trying this beer. It's certainly worth drinking anytime."

"2012. Aged the bottle a bit over one year. Drank it tonite. This is just so classic. Complex. Layers of revelations. The only beer that arguably surpasses it that I know of in this category is Goose Island's Bourbon County (which I think has the edge in terms of a viscous ""motor-oil"" quality). Clearly, Firestone is at the top of their game here, and this version is probably even better than the prior two years.... I think this version has a little extra sweetness that takes some edge off the bourbon."

"A wonderfull beer very complex and flavorfull. The alcohol and bourbon were through the roof for me. I cut the rest of the bottle with some DBA. The mix made an excellent bourbon barrel black IPA."
"Can't wait for the 2014 release, so I can keep the cycle going."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an incredible stout. Lots of complexity. Extremely enjoyable and surprisingly easy to drink - the alcohol is masked well, but this is one to sip and savour. A perfect barrel aged stout."
""
"some of the highly rated beers have been a disappointment, this however is not one of them. As far as taste goes, this is most likely the best tasting beer I have ever had, with the possible exception of central waters 15. I wish I could get my hands on a case every year, a guy can dream right?"

"Bottle. Pours black with a small brown head. Aroma is bourbon, coffee, strong oak, a little alcohol. Taste is very sweet, dominated by bourbon, some vanilla, chocolate, with a roasted background. Finish is roasty and a little alcoholic. Very full bodied, syrupy, soft carbonation. Big big beer."
""

"O - Hands down, this is my personal favorite beer of all time. So well balanced and should be the example for brewer's everywhere what a barrel aged Imperial Stout should be. It ages perfectly, but is oh so fantastic as a young beer (I had the 2013 on release weekend at the brewery on tap). I just have to say over and over how good this beer is!"
""
"This is a gorgeous beer that is in my mind one of the best barrel aged stouts that I have ever had the plesure of consuming. It is a sipper for sure but it leaves the mind continually processing its complexity. It is absolutely incredible and perfectly balanced with every element working in perfect union with the others."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the best stout I have ever had. The beer pours a dark coffee color with a thick brown head. The taste is so good it mask the high alcohol content. Most beers with an alcohol content this high taste like a bum wine. This beer is flavorable and delicious. The smell was great, it was fresh and crisp."

"Loved this stout. Had it on tap fresh at Big Star, Chicago. Smell was hard to pick up but was poured into a pilsner glass, sadly. The bourbon barrel aging is smooth and not too harsh. Great flavors throughout, with roasty malts, vanilla, toffee, but balanced by some bitterness. This was served way too cold by really opened up as it warmed."

"I'm glad I saved this sucker. I mean, I just never had the reason to dig it out of the closet... then, I forgot I had it. When I saw it again recently, after hunting for some good beers, I decided I was saving it for my 1,000th review. It paid off. Not as loud and obvious as KBS, not as rich as BBPt5, falls short of BCBS, but still an elite RIS. An excellent Sunday night stout of dreams to cap off a hell of a great day."
""
"Well, it's taken me long enough to finally try Parabola, and now that I have, I'll be sure to nab up as much as possible each year that it comes out. Being from Southeast Michigan, some might say we're spoiled with ""big"" stouts; BCBS, KBS, Black Note, etc... But I'd put Parabola RIGHT up with those brews, and possibly even ahead of a few. So what the hell are you complaining about West Coasters?? This stuff is amazing."
"Overall a huge RIS from FW that should be tried by anyone that is a fan of the style.2011 Reserve sampled."
""
""
""

""
"I know it has a little bit of hype, but I still think this is an underrated beer, for something that is so well distributed, I can't believe how good it is.

"I was like 5 bombers deep when my brother and I decided to crack one of the two bottles open. Didn’t realize it was 13% and we each had just about a pint of this black/stout/wine/alcohol. Laughing at the fact we might get the spins and throw up. This beer left a distinctive reminder in the morning that it was BIG. Strong alcohol/stout/cherry aroma and the flavor followed the nose well. I was schmammered afterwards."

"Overall: One of the best beers I've had. Wish I could drink it alongside bcbs for comparison."

"Unbelievable stout! I was lucky to share a bottle of this with the owner of a bar in Jersey City, Iron Monkey, also a great pub with a huge selection. We opened the bottle and let it settle for about 5 minutes before we enjoyed. The stout just hits you with so much flavor all at once...I got hints of vanilla, maple syrup, coffee and a bit of heaven. Definitely give this beer a 5 minute cool down, I think if you drink it too cold you could miss some of the flavor. This beer definitely escalated the awesomeness of stout to the next level. I give this beer a lampshade-hat rating of 9.25. Cheers to Firestone Walker for a great beer!"

"Poured bottle into snifter. Pours pitch black with a single finger beige head that quickly fades. Smell is lots of bourbon and oak, chocolate, some licorice,some marshmallow. Taste is loaded with dark bitter cocoa, some sweet vanilla, marshmallow, tons of hot bourbon and oak, slightly smokey, nice citra hop caricature (kidding) . The texture is silky smooth. Overall this is very very good. Loaded with complex but distinct flavors. Boozy but Devine. I'm so glad I got to try this and can't wait to see how this ages."
"O: I can see what all the hype is about. This is really an experience every beer enthusiast needs to have. FW never disappoints but they took this to a whole different level. I'm not the biggest fan of stouts, but this is one of the best beers I have ever experienced."

"Overall: I was excited to drink this and it was certainly delicious. This bottle was the 2013 vintage and I think needs 6 to 12 months to even out a little more. No doubt one of the better beers I've had in a while and I cannot wait to pop my next one in the appropriate time frame."

"Overall: This is a treat for me to even have this considering how long I've been waiting to try this. The chocolate and coffee flavors mesh so well with the coconut and vanilla that come from the barrel aging. The 13% is virtually non existent so far. This is a well constructed beer and I'm definitely glad I got to enjoy this. This is one of the best beers I've ever had and Firestone Walker may have the best barrel aging programs in the world and this is a clear indication of it."

"Overall: This is one of the best beers I have ever had and I would love to have it again and again. The best Imperial Stout that I have tried, as I would place it slightly above Stone and BCBS which were two of my favorites. This is one of the most perfect beers I have tried, and worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"Overall: Seriously, this is one of the best effing beers I have ever had and may just be the best RIS I've ever enjoyed. I paid $15 for this and would easily drop $20 it's so freakin' good. Sipped it slow and made it last like a fine bourbon."

"Overall - I don't know if it's the mood I'm in, or if that strong stout factor has tipped the scales, but I like this considerably more than the Sucaba. While there's plenty of boozy character, it's not nearly that of Sucaba, or perhaps there's enough bold stout flavor to counteract the barrel-aged influence. Either way, this is pretty good. I've purchased a 2nd bottle for aging. If it's phenomenal 18-24 months from now, you better believe I'll be on here giving it praise!"
""
""
""

"O. Amazing, incredibly well blended and great flavor, one of the smoothest beers, so creamy and delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Final grade: 5/5. Parabola is incredible, and has permanently raised the bar by which I judge all other beers that set foot in the Stout category."
"Pours black with dark mahogany hues and a light sienna head that quickly develops into a lasting ring. Generous but not clinging lacing. Bourbon, campfire, oak, dark cherry, vanilla, chocolate, toffee, alcohol, and the slightest whisper of maple present in the nose. Smell translates to taste perfectly. This is a big, thick, and heavy albeit silky smooth beer. A 13% monster that lives up to the hype. This one checks all the boxes."
""
""
""
"2012 aged very nicely, had more body and flavor complexities. Caramel, roast, bourbon Would love to taste how 2013 ages as it was a little lacking, but the the potential is totally there. A solid stout, either year. Thanks, Firestone."

"O: An amazing vintage, a perfect marriage of flavors and barrel aging. Ignore the comments on that it's too hot, it's perfect."
"It poured dark like oil with very minimal head and very sexually. I wish these guys could figure out a natural additive that would make the head hang out a bit longer in these high ABV barrel aged stouts. The aromas were intense which is always a good thing but along with the rich bourbon, chocolate, slight vanilla, smoked caramel, berry medley and oak was the very apparent scent of alcohol. A renowned beer is great because the alcohol is invisible and you can really get into it. This one it is dead center and you enter with a state of mind that speaks moderation which is not good. The flavor was an alcoholic punch to the mouth that left a very nutty aftertaste that coated my mouth for a long time afterwards which was very good. Awesome in fact. I wish the dynamic of flavor profiles was a smooth transition. All the greatness is there but it should be a bit friendlier. The chocolate, vanilla, roasty, dark fruit notes are very distinguishable and enjoyable once you jump the alcohol hurdle."
""
"Overall: This is drinking excellent for how young it is. I believe that with 6 months to a year the alcohol will be smoothed out and it will be the best vintage of Parabola yet. Excellent release!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have been stowing away two of these for about a year now, but this is my first time trying it. I am glad I waited because this is drinking nearly perfectly with one year on it (although no basis for comparison). Very complex flavor full of chocolate, roast, whiskey, and oak. Impressively drinkable for a 12.5% monster. I will definitely seek out this year's batch and look forward to seeing how this one tastes fresh as well as with a few (or more) years on it. This is what barrel aged stouts should taste like."

"O - This was my first Parabola and I had been waiting about a year to drink it, so I had some high expectations, but I was kind of let down. I was hoping for more bourbon and a thicker, sweeter body, but it was actually kind of dry with a lot of alcohol burn and not a ton of bourbon flavor. Maybe I would like it better fresh? Most people rave about this beer, so I would definitely give it a try - but I'd rather have a regular BCS which I can easily obtain every year and I have to hunt this out."

"O- Right up there with all of the best BBA Stouts. Really nice flavors and light enough in ABV to finish a bomber. Seek this out and buy a few if you can. Also interested to see how this holds up with a year of age on it."

"OK...with a few minutes the head is nearly gone, aroma is big of barrel bourbon, dark malts...flavors are big with bourbon barrel, raisins, dark chocolate, bitter hops (82 IBU), vanilla. This is a big boy with complexity and strength...might have been wise to age it another 6 - 12 months, possibly more, but I couldn't resist. I've had this on many occasions over the years, probably most often on draft in Southern California. Damn fine and tasty treat."

"O-This beer mostly lived up to its reputation. I sipped it slowly over the course of the evening and enjoyed every drop. The complexity of flavors and mixture between the oaky bourbon and the more traditional RIS flavors like chocolatey malts are really fantastic. This is not a beer for the timid with its 12.5% ABV and prominent booze feel and taste, but for those who like that sort of thing, drink up."
""
"Overall this is one of the best beers I've had in quite a while. FW really hits this one out of the park, much of the hype surrounding this beer is justified by how many dimensions it has. Well worth $15 a bottle, I can't wait to age some of these"

"Lots to explore here; I really like that in a beer. When I started out on this particular journey of discovery, I felt disappointed and a bit nonplussed. I wish they'd given me more of a precursor on the look or the smell, because the anticipation and excitement is half of the fun. This doesn't look or smell nearly as good as it is."

"O - 4.25 - Very good, if overhyped. Whatever this overall flavor is, it's really very nice. There's more than one thing happening, but not much more. That's good but more would be better. A bit thicker, a bit richer, maybe some more black malt char to stiffen it. A bit of coffee or something else. Never had it fresh so not sure how it compares. I really like the alcohol level. Nice and warm. It's almost liqueur-like in sweetness and strength. I would definitely buy it again if I had local access but would not trade for it again. At the end of the bottle I'll say this is a beer that made me work and made me think and improved over the course of the bottle, which is saying something."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a nice large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of black chocolate with some light vanilla notes and some light dry roasted malt. Taste is dominated by loads of black chocolate notes with some light dry roasted malt and some vanilla and light bourbon notes. Taste is definitely quite complex and not as dry as expected with quite a bit of residual sugar coming through. Body is full with a really nice creamy texture and some good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. I can’t find many fault in this beer except that that bourbon could bit a bit more pronounced."

"O: Overall this beer is certainly on a level above most others and a 1% by style. For such a dark and high abv beer this comes off amazingly smooth, refined, balanced and is so deliciously inviting i feel i can continue much longer then the bomber should allow me to. Was literally awestruck from the first sip to the last, kept my attention and excitment thoughout with vocal explanations thrown around as to its heavenly nature. I dont hand out 5's to often but really couldnt find much else i would rather see here that could make this any more enjoyable except for another bottle in hand. Highly recommended."

"O - This beer shows why Firestone Walker is known as a great blender and barrel ager. It has great flavors, is silky smooth and no rough edges. I was really impressed by this one and surprised how much it stood out from some of the other RIS's I've had lately."
"Overall: Definitely glad I was able to try this. Not a bad brew by any means, but I'm just not thrilled about the spicy notes of this(similar to what I thought about that element in Sucaba)although it does lend to the complexity. This is also a little boozy on the back end of the drink. Aside from that, Firestone Walker makes a lot of good beer and I will continue to imbibe, I just personally like their IPAs better."

"2011 vintage in a trade. Poured on 1/22/13. Pours deep black with no light let in. Aggressive-ish pour left with a tiny brown head. Aroma is very strong vanilla, molasses, chocolate, licorice, and of course plenty of bourbon. Really beautiful. Thick an viscous mouthfeel opens up to Very mellow bourbon tones, lots of vanilla, and a burst of chocolate on the finish. Mild carbonation that is right on for this. Incredibly mellow, and I am curioud is that is the age or the uncanny craft of FW. Prickle of alcohol burn on the tongue, and a nice bit of warmth on the way down. Probably a new favorite BA Stout for me. Just right."
""
""
""
""
"The first sip is both sharp / finely carbonated and rich with big, dark fruit flavors and alcohol warmth. The middle of the beer is deceptively light on the tongue. The beer concludes with a gentle bitter edge, though I'd never have guessed anywhere close to the DIPA-worthy 82 IBUs the label claims. A little bit of treacle / bitter molasses in the end. For an imperial stout this beer is just super mellow; the barrel aging and oak flavors do it really well. Oh, except for the heavy alcohol of course. For a stout there really aren't a lot of roasty, nutty, chocolate or coffee flavors, either. But there are layers of bourbon, fruit and brandy"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black as used motor oil with little to no head and abundant alcohol legs. The aroma is enveloping and consists of vanilla, bourbon and espresso. The taste brings plenty of of roasted malt, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and coffee. The mouth feel is reminiscent of syrup, in that it coats your whole mouth and slides across your palate."
"As far as I'm concerned, Firestone Walker can't miss. This is a terrific brew. Despite being nearly 13%, this is surprisingly drinkable."
""
"2012 vintage. Yeah, it's a big American double stout and it looks the part, black as night with a big-bubbled tan froth that builds fast before falling to a thin cap under the heft of the 12.5% ethyl alcohol. Again, it's a powerful American stout and we all know what the best taste like (and this is one of the best) - rich espresso, raw cocoa, burnt sugars, toffee, and a punch of herbal hoppiness all layered with a smooth bourbon whiskey flavor on top of an oak foundation. Smoooth. The barrel aging has rounded out the rough spots and left the alcohol nigh undetectable. Firestone Walker brews excellent beer and this is no exception."

"O: This beer is very enjoyable with a great amount of complexity to both the taste and the smell - this makes it a great sipping beer that is best slowly enjoyed... The beer smells much stronger than it tastes but the alcohol is not overly present in the flavor. The beer continues to smooth out as it warms and the complexity increases."

"Overall a great stout, better with age."

"O: One of the best beers I've had. There's really not much more you could do to this, a perfect example of a barrel aged beer. World class for sure"

I love the oaking and the complexity with multiple layers of chocolate. I will try to pick this one up again."

"Pours bitch black (midnight black according to FW) with a one finger tan head that recedes to a ring of tight bubbles. Notes of bourbon, oak, cherries, dark fruit, dark chocolate, coffee, some booze and brown sugar sweetness in the nose. Taste opens with bourbon and oak followed by dark fruits in the middle of the palate. Back end is a pop of intense milk chocolate and coffee that coats the mouth. The alcohol is imperceptible. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, among the best I've had. Parabola meets the hype and in some ways exceeds it. Certainly the best barrel aged RIS I've had (still waiting on KBS)."

"The beer pours jet black with a razor thin tan head that settles down to a halo around the edges. As expected, the nose is bourbony, but its 12.5% abv is well masked. Notes of chocolate & coconut fight against slightly metallic notes of bourbon. It's definitely a bold elixir that drinks smoothly. The initial sweetness followed by much more bitterness (82 IBUs!) than I originally expected. It reminds me of wookey jack except with a lot more bourbon and booziness. The mouthfeel is bold and full bodied and despite spending 12 months in a barrel... there is ample carbonation. The aftertaste is a lingering vanilla bitterness that is possibly to bitter for its own good as the contrast overpowers the rich smoothness and drinkability I've come to expect in a good RIS. Regardless, this beer is damn good, but I must admit that I've had some that are better."
""
""

""
""
""

"An incredible imperial stout: rich, flavorful, balanced and complex. The Firestone brewers have created a monster imperial stout, bringing out various malt and grain flavorings while taming the fairly high ABV. I hope to find some more bottles of this beautiful beast..."

""
""
"O- Just a great beer. Flavors are amazing and the way they all mend together is incredible. Just an amazingly refined beer."

"Overall, this is fantastic beer, and while it may not feature traditional, or even expected Imperial Stout flavors up front, I doubt many drinkers will care. The care and craft that went into this beer is palpable and commendable, and the layers of flavor would be more believable if present in the kind of coffee-and-ice-cream-and-brownie-liqueur desserts found in restaurants whose bills leave average people gasping. This is a definite must-try."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a black body with a finger-width, creamy, dark brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves lots of lacing throughout. Aroma is big, rich, smooth chocolates and caramels with a nice, roast and mocha backing. The bourbon and oak provides a solid addition without over-powering the big malt backing. Touches of vanilla, raisins, and a light alcohol hint. Flavor is similar. Rich, bittersweet dark chocolates up front with a good amount of roasts and caramel. The oak comes on with a lighter bourbon note as well as touches of vanilla, raisin, and licorice. Mocha, tobacco, and a bit more bourbon grows towards the end as this finishes rich, roasty, slightly ashy, and sweet with a nice bourbon warmth and dry oakiness. Lengthy aftertaste following a very smooth, mouth coating, full body and a soft, light carbonation. Overall, a very big, bold, rich, well balanced imperial stout with a solid barrel aged character. Not the most complex, but such a nice body and really enjoyable all-around."

"I... I'm not sure what just happened in my mouth, but I like it. The rich folds of complexity that are present... sweet, but not overly so, bourbon, but not overwhelming, alcohol, but folded into the flavour, not overpowering. I don't pick up quite as much of the oak as I anticipated, but there's some underlying things in there. Very rich. complex and tasty. This has been the highlight of the day"

"Note: As I hit enter on this review, a bootleg version of ""Loving Cup"" by the Stones popped up on my iTunes. Perfect."
"This is a wonderful beer. It straddles the dichotomy of dark and light, of good and evil of sweet and bitter. Of everything. This beer is a little of it all. Really great stuff."
"While I can conceive of a better-tasting imperial stout, It's hard to think of one that could be better-brewed than Parabola. Everything works together. Perfect harmony."
"Enjoyable, but not a breeze to drink. To be honest, i think the bourbon hurts this beer. It's a bit too hot for my personal tastes. There are other RISs that I enjoy more. So I was let down a Little. If I think of it as a beer, I'm not a huge fan. If I think of it as an after dinner cordial, I'm a fan. It has its place but you have to be in the mood. I just feel that the bourbon barrel aging added an unnecessary element to a beer that was probably perfect in the first place...and took some of its greatness away."

"Motor oil. As black and syrupy as 30 weight. The nose is all toasted malt, coffee, chocolate, with some spice.

It is a fantastic beer but I can't always find someone to share the bottle with especially during the week. It is a heavenly elixir but a big beer so be ready for it."

"Overall: This beer has just about everything going for it -- looks good, smells better, tastes great, thick and chewy body... what else could you want? This is a great beer for dessert, wouldn't want to drink too much on a full stomach though. The alcohol and weight will indeed slow you down a bit."
"overall: epic stuff, obviously"

"I've been waiting to open this bottle for a year now. I had planned on keeping it longer, but I've never been one for patience. Opening it when I moved a month ago was the idea, to christen the new house, and although that never came to fruition, temptation proved too volatile tonight. An $18 bottle I bought from Seattle last summer that I've seen for $15 here in Bellingham, needless to say I've had better. You're buying for nomenclature and exclusivity here. While it is a tasty brew, I've had twice as good beers for half the price. Unless you're buying for a wedding or dinner party, or just to impress a lady, stick with something else to fulfill your exotic craft or review-based needs."

"Bottle shared by Eric. I've had this a couple times. Pours thick reddish muddy color with thin head. Aroma is wood, booze, sweet caramel, sherry, vanilla, and a touch of brown sugar.

"651mL 2011 ed. Having this beer for the fourth or fifth time.

"Pours a viscous motor oil black with a one and a half finger tan head. Huge aroma of oak, bourbon, and roasted malt. Bourbon, vanilla, and oak with hints of chocolate joined by the dense flavor of black cherries, hints of plums, and rich fig. Finishes with bold espresso notes and roastiness and a comfortable alchohol warmth. Full bodied, smooth, and even a bit of creaminess. Incredibly complex and without a doubt one of the finest barrel aged Russian Imperial Stouts available."
"D - Very drinkable. Amazingly smooth for how big and bold the flavors are. The balance is really spot on and the Bourbon comes through really nicely."
""
""
"Tasty stuff. Very smooth, with excellent melding of the barrel and the beer. The richness of the barrel combines really well with the sweetness of the stout. Probably not the best barrel-aged stout that I've had, but definitely up there. Has the same sweet-rich barrel aromas and flavor that Abacus has, and it's interesting to encounter those same characteristics in a stout vs. a barleywine. And now that I'm thinking about it, where's the alcohol in this beer? It's going to my head, but I barely taste it."
"O: Love the ""vanilla"" or butterscotch flavor that I get in F-W beers, didn't expect here but I got it. Not the ""biggest"" RIS I've had, but flavors are perfectly proportioned and blended."
""
"Overall, it reminds me of Old Viscosity. I remember this being better than this sample. It's in your face and not really well balanced. Too sweet and treacly at times, and the alcohol is too sharp for me. It's still a good beer though."
""
""
"O: I find this one absolutely awesome. Everything is so well balanced in this one, but be warned that this is a sweet sugary bomb. The only knock on it may be the heat on this one. I find it appropriate for the massive sweetness in this brew."

"My 300th review. Poured into a 16 oz snifter, vintage 2012. Pours a slick pitch black, with a two inch dark tan head, that leaves wonderful scattered lace. Smell is vanilla, chocolate, expresso, bourbon, and some molasses extraordinary. Taste is lots of vanilla and expresso up front, with some smoke and bourbon towards the finish, really huge flavors and every sip is as intense as the first. Body is medium large, perfect amount of life for the style, dry as you would expect from the style, and very drinkable for a big beer, that should be savored sip after sip. I have 4 more of these and am so happy about it. This is one of the finest BA Imperial Stouts on the planet. Firestone does it once again!"

"Overall: I love this beer. Probably my favorite BB stout, next to Black Note. Buy this no matter what if you have the money in your wallet. If not, go sell some scrap and come back before someone else buys it."

"O: Overall a phenomenal beer and drinking so well fresh. I've had two out of the 6 I've purchased so far. Every time I go to the store I end up picking up another bottle and will continue to do so until the supply diminishes. I look forward to this beer every year and it did not disappoint. I'd recommend this beer to any RIS fan."
"It's clearly a strong beer, but the strength of the flavor works in tandem with the strength of the alcohol like cognac. Every sip is enjoyable, the alcohol is never overwhelming, but it makes its presence well known on the palate and in your body. Take it nice and slow. It's a perfect beer."
"There is so much going on with the flavors and aromas it is mind boggling."
"O:	Absolutely solid. One of the best smelling beers I have come across so far. One whiff and you want to take a sip – and only a sip – because it is impressive looking and it smells like a bourbon bomb; you know it might knock you on your ass. It is delightfully drinkable without being overly sweet, or too decadent. Wonderful balance. I only wish it was ever so slightly thicker."

"22oz bottle. Reserve Series 003, 2012 Vintage. Pours a rich black color with an inch of light brown head. Some lacing. Aromas of booze, vanilla, toffee, and light and sweet coffee. The taste is boozey vanilla up front followed by some toffee. Some hints of coffee, chocolate and sweetness. Alcohol burn finish. Thick, heavy mouthfeel. You can certainly taste the barrel aging. This is a great slow sipper with a bunch of flavor. Damn good and would like to try it with some age on it, but fresh is outstanding. I need to get more of this."

More chocolate and roasted barley in the flavor. I found this to be a little hot. Really long dry malty finish. I expected more barrel, but it was nicely balanced. Would have benefited from some age."
""
"Just an awesome beer, Firestone has this ability to balance every single component in a beer, this is no exception. One of the best bourbon oaked aged beers i've ever had."
"O: This is a great stout. I'm glad they produce a lot of it, it's very good. Definitely not my favorite stout, but it's up there for sure!"
"Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. Faint spotty lacing. Aroma is lightly roasted malt and bourbon. Flavor is roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and oak/bourbon. Very nice. Alcohol is noticeable, but it is 13%. Finish is fairly smooth with no unpleasant lingering aftertaste. Medium to full body. A very good beer. But a sipper."
""
""
"O - Very complex and very refined. And this one hasn't even been aged! This beer is fantastic as-is and doesn't need to wait to be enjoyed. I do plan on saving a bottle for another year or two and seeing how it pans out. Overall this beer is a phenomenal barrel-aged offering from the kings of barrel-aged beers. Firestone definitely hit the nail on the head with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another fantastic barrel aged beer. Easily makes the best of list, but it is getting hard to rank them all."
""
"Overall: Just a very enjoyable experience with this one. Not overy complicated but a rather straight forward beer that is a sipping pleasure. I'm interested what some time would do to this but it is so good fresh I don't know if time would do this one good."
"Moderate mouthfeel, with decent carbonation presence. Slight oily feel on the back end, but drinks nicely. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla. Again, the bourbon is underplayed, but its subtlety is what I like about this. Rounds out a nice roasted brew, giving a welcome sweet balance. I usually like to split my bombers with someone, but this one was a treat to drink on my own. Loved it."

"O: Excellent BA Stout. Extremely well balanced. Interested to see what happens after a year."
""

"O: Overall, this is a pretty middle of the road RIS in my opinion.  Some age could do this wonders I suppose, but as is, this one is a pretty big disappointment.  I am a huge fan of barrel aged stouts but this one is far too bitter and a touch too boozy. The bourbon is masked by an almost grain alcohol character, and the rest of the flavor profile is dominated by the bitter qualities.  I would like to try an aged one to see how it develops, but the fresh one is rather meh.  No where near the level of many other big RIS's I've enjoyed, and also no where near as enjoyable as Sucaba.  "

"O - I'm sure this is the best imperial stout I've tasted, and it's very likely the best beer I've ever had. This blew my mind, I'm soooo glad I've got one more bomber. I'm going to give it a good old fashioned cellaring. I highly recommend this beer. If you see it, buy it! don't worry about the $14 price tag, it's totally worth it."

"Poured into tulip glasses, half in mine, half in Dad's (Happy Fathers Day!). It's a beautiful black with a tan head that's gone before you know it. After one whiff I knew this was something special. I instantly picked up on sweet cherries that are nicely balanced by smokey oak and vanilla. Taste up front is of dark chocolate, bourbon, sweet raisin, dates and cherry. This gave way to the notes of burnt coffee, oats and roasted malt. I picked up on a bit of liquorice and several other flavors that my palate just couldn't identify. The bitterness and light carbonation in this stout is perfect. The brew felt thick and the booziness really warms is it goes down. Overall this beer is powerful, complex and excellent. I'll be aging another bottle to crack on a cold winter's day several years in the future."
""
""
"A really nice beer, but this is not as good as I remember the '11 being. I definitely think it needs some time to mellow out. The bourbon is a little overpowering, adds a bit more heat than I'd like and hurts the drinkability. I'll be holding onto my other bottle for at least another year before I try this one again."
""
"I’ve been wanting to try this beer for awhile and it didn’t disappoint. Just a marvelous beer."
""
""
""
""
"I'm glad I finally grew the balls to crack this open. What a great beer."
"O: this made me think of what Goose Island's BCBS line would be if they were RIS - it was a little smoother, less syrupy, more creamy, and well-balanced - on par for certain - and I imagine everyone will have their own preferences - I loved it and was glad to get a hold of this limited release."
"This beer pours a dark midnight black. It has a rush of carbination that fizzles out fast and leaves no head. The smell I get is vanilla and a hint of bourbon. The taste follows suit, with a hint of chocolate thrown in to a great balanced and smooth taste. A little booze comes out in the aftertaste, but just a peak. This is a wonderful RIS, and I love how easy I can get it during the release."

"O: Of course both were delicious. The 2011 was a little less roasty, less vanilla, less alcohol heat, and more fruit. I gave it a slight edge."
"O - They don't try to do too much with this beer except make it excellent. Nice all around and best mouthfeel I have experienced."
"O: Completely stoked to be finally able to try this beer, and to have it on tap form makes the experience that much more pleasurable. World Class all the way. Next for me is finding a bottle...I recommend the same for you"
"Overall, this is a world-class RIS that is full of big huge flavors. Most of the time I find that it is overly sweet and wish it was a tad more dry. I have one to age for a while and I cannot wait to visit this one again in the future with some years in the cellar on it."
""
""
""
"O - Sit back and savor this beast. I enjoyed every last sip of this. Utterly delicious. The base beer must be great, to barrel age it excess, but also necessary. One of my favorites from PBW, and one of my favorite stouts period."
""
""
""
""
""
"No beer is perfect, but it's hard to find fault in Parabola. The far end of the aftertaste ends up with a lingering sugar taste that can be irksome, but I'll enjoy this beer for years to come."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer definitely needs to age but It's potential is through the roof. The fruit notes balance very well with the roastiness and the minor hints of bourbon. I really wanted to give this beer a 4.5 overall, but it still has some growing up to do. Can't wait to get this bad boy aged."
"O: As I said at the beginning of the review. I've had this beer countless times, and it never ceases to amaze me. Absolutely my favorite BA Stout. The balance is amazing. Firestone Walker, in my opinion, has the absolute best barrel program in the country right now. Beers like Parabola, PNC, and Sucaba all show the barrel aging dominance that is Firestone Walker. I really need to buy a case of Parabola next year....the 6 bottles I got this year seem to be dwindling quickly."
""
""
"I can see now why this beer gets so much hype. It deserves every bit of it and more. It is phenomenally crafted and I am grateful to have finally been able to try it (and glad I have a few more). I would drink/buy this at every opportunity and recommend that anyone else who loves world class barrel aged stouts to do the same. Simply amazing."
""
""
""
"What Sirtomtom said!"
"O- this beer blew me away. This was my first Parabola and now I know why people buy cases of it upon release. It has a lot of the same flavors I've seen in RIS's but is extremely well balanced and the mouthfeel is incredible. A+ brew!"
""
"O- Love the flavors on this beer, only complaint would be a little less bitter and a little less carb. This is being very nit picky."
""
""
"Perfection."
""
"This is a top notch beer from a top notch brewer. If I could make a beer like this, I'd be mighty proud."
"Pours a deep, pitch black with a slight head. Smells lightly of bourbon with strong chocolate and roasted malt. Taste is much more bourbon forward, chocolately, smoked and roasted malt. The bourbon is nicely balanced with the imperial stout backbone. Mouthfeel is smooth, well carbonated and very drinkable. This goes down exceptionally easy for a 12.5% beer. Overall, this is excellent. Pick up several if you can."
"this is a near perfect beer, and defnitely the best firestone brew ive had, including the anniversary blend. pours jet black, dense and mean, with a one inch mocha colored head that fades out after a few minutes. smells is incredible. tons of wood, vanilla, bourbon notes, wine tannons, fresh pipe tobacco, chocolatey malt. i could smell this beer for ages. the flavor is lovely, very rich. notes of oak, milk chocolate, burned sugar, and that pipe tobacco marry perfectly in the mouth for a long complex drinking experience. not sure ive had any stout this good. mouthfeel is right on. velvety smooth with all that body, mellow carbonation from the barrel time. overall this may be one of the best stouts out there, its absolutely fantastic, and worth every penny of the 15 bucks it cost. you must must try this"
""
""
"O- A fantastic beer. One of the better bourbon barrel aged stouts out there. This beer has a nice complexity mixed with solid drinkability. Definitely a must try. And since this beer isn't super rare, you shouldn't have much trouble getting your hands on a bottle."
""
"Highly recommended. Definitely has Firestone Walker barrel characteristics stamped all over it. Lives up to the hype."
""
""
""
"O – World class, but this is one intense beer. Calling it a “slow sipper” is an understatement. I’ve had spirits that drank easier than this. Took me over an hour to finish the bomber. But lest you think that’s a critique, it’s not. This imperial is challenging but accept the challenge, and you will be rewarded. If there is a minor flaw, it's that it's just slightly ""hot"". I would love to sample this after a couple of years of aging."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Champion IRS for me. I love imperials so I might be partial but for me this beer is just what beer should be. It seems to take you on a journey that is another level. Kicks your palate in the groin to say wow! That's a beer"
"Low B-"
"D - A good beer, though it's a bit restrained and I'm disappointed by it given the hype. Not memorable or unique."
""
"Final thoughts - GET THIS BEER"

"Overall this lives up to the hype. An outstanding beer and not to be missed. I think it is drinking great right now but I am cellaring a few to see what becomes of it. Great stuff!!"

""
""
"D- great flavor and limited release are worth the price. Don't miss an opportunity regardless of the sacrifice. Highly drinkable."
"O: An incredible, special RIS. At the price, it's a great treat. I must say, I was lucky to try this on-tap a few days before I cracked open my bottle so I'm able to compare. Much better from the keg with some carbonation and maybe some proper aging conditions to mellow it out a bit more. Nearly a ""5" on-tap and close to a ""4.5"" overall in the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"This is really nice. Its pretty hot and might do well to mellow a bit, but it's plenty enjoyable now. Recommended."
"The.taste is nice sweet with cocoa and coffee but a nice bourbon flavor. The bourbon is subtle but very nice everything is well balanced and the sweetness is cut by the alcohol."
"A"
""
""

"Overall: Parabola is probably my favorite stout of the moment. It manages to be the perfect balance of sweet and complex without being overwhelming. After having my first pour, I went out and purchased two bottles."
"Overall: Great beer, Definantly a Sipper, Would buy another one but its a bit expensive. This one was a gift"
"Pours black with a thumbs width mocha head that quickly recedes, what remains sticks to the edges. Nice lacing. A sharp rich and woody aroma. roasted barley, bourbon, chocolate, coffee, coconut. The flavor blew me away, so good and so balanced. Woody, bourbon, roasted barley, milk chocolate, molasses, coconut, and a touch of coffeee. The flow of flavors into one another is ridiculously awesome. Noticeable, but the alcohol blends in quite well. A nice creamy and silky mouthfeel. Overall, yeah I loved this beer. So dangerous though, should be a sipper but so tasty and smooth that I just want to devour it!"

""

"Best version yet. Almost like a Port wine, still full of chocolate, mild coffee and bourbon barrel."

"o-I cannot say enough about this beer. This is hands down my most anticipated beer release of the year. This beer continues to impress me. Excited to age some of this over the next year or so."
""
"Overall, I find this to be quite good and delicious, but I would like bitter component to come through more."
"I can't thank Rutager enough for this one its just great. I tried to age this one but it was taunting me from its little box telling me I didn't have another to gauge the aging progress so I should crack it, so I did."
""
""
"Glad I passed up the chance to try this at a bar I was at and was able to pick it up at a store (at random). Saved some coin and got a chance to truly relax with a nice beer. That being said, you gotta love finally getting to these super hyped up beers. Because you're either going to be blown away and really dig it, or you're going to be under-impressed with it. Guess which of those two this beer was for me. The latter. Sure, it's nice. Has some nice characteristics to it that work well. But this thing is rated up there with other beers that I've had that really made an impression. This one does not do that so much. There are nice vanilla and bourbon tones and a good profile, but there is nothing really interesting about it. It's ""nice", but doesn't really do anything for me at all. Especially for the price."
""
"Overall, this is one phenomenal brew. The bourbon notes are easily noticed, but not overpowering. They add to the beer as opposed to dominating it. Immense kudos to Firestone Walker for this one."
""
""
"Poured into a flute :/, jet black with half finger of creamy cocoa head. After the first sip, lacing is already showing. Nose is lots of toffee, butterscotch, bourbon and wood is hidden in the back. Taste is creamy milk chocolate, toffee/caramel, very subtle bourbon, bitter bite near the end. Mouthfeel is creamy, low carbonation, and relatively thick, IMO a great example of the style. Overall this exceptionally decadent, worth the $. Might actually get some bottles."
"Such a great beer. Incredible balance. The alcohol is present but tamed. Really without any evident flaws."
""
"The beer pours pitch black. Little head but honestly I wasn’t paying close attention because it was too cold so I set it off to the side to warm while I finished the 2010 Abyss I was drinking. When I get to the Parabola I take a deep whiff and smell chocolate, bourbon, and roasted malts. I am blown away by my first sip and it only gets better. The alcohol is hidden very well and I get chocolates and bourbon. The beer is sweet and delicious. This is definitely one of the best stouts I have ever had. I am going to pick up a few fresh bottles when it is released this year but I will not hesitate to age as a few years has done this beer well."
""
""
""
""
"O: Stellar. One of the best barrel aged beers I've had, right up there with 2011 and 2012 BCBS and KBS. If only we could get this in MN. ABV is noticeable, but not hot at all."
""
""
"Overall: As can be inferred from the geometry of its name, this beer is still moving along the curve to the apogee; not sure how long the process will take but it is still a ways away from its optimal point of consumption"
"Pours a very dark brown, with a brown-tan, quickly attenuating head. Aromas of sorghum, coconut, chocolate, and tobacco. The mouthfeel is creamy and viscous, with some scrubbing on the back of the tongue at the finish. Milk chocolate, coconut, and unflavored leaf tobacco are prevalent and alternating flavors. There is even that mild pang in the back of the jaw that occassionally occurs with dry leaf, unflavored chewing tobacco. Notes of sorghum and bourbon as well. This is my favorite FW brew. It's a phenomenal concoction."
"Very good beer, but not the best in style. This one is good as a sipper, but I wish it were more complex and the sweetness were dialed back a bit. I know they are different styles, but so much better than Sucuba, it's not funny."
"Medium-full bodied but not viscous; medium-low carbonation. Smooth, creamy, and delicious. Not the biggest or most over-the-top barrel aged stout but one of the most well-balanced and drinkable, certainly. Would love to see what a longer cellaring would bring about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best Stouts ever made."
""
""
""
"O: One hell of a barrel aged RIS. It smells bourbon-heavy but luckily it didn't taste overpowering. Just a touch boozy which suits the style nicely. Great balance between all the roasted malt flavors and the bourbon flavors. Melds better than almost all other similar beers (just short of a KBS-class beer)."
""
""
""
""
"Black and viscous. Licorice and whiskey on the nose. Very nice. The flavor is rich, boozy, malty, bitter-balanced. Vanilla, but also paler-beautiful malts. One of the best Parabolas yet. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O-great stout. surprised it wasn't hot. incredible taste"
""
"O: This is certainly a sipping beer, and an excellent one at that. I'm glad I hopped across the street for a beer to drink in this hotel before hitting the airport. As noted above this beer has excellent olfactory and palate play, but I think the mouthfeel takes away from the excellence of the beer. I also think this beer has such dominent wood character, that this would benefit from a year or two laying down to help it all come together. Granted, I think the malts would eventually turn this one really, really sweet, so it could be a delicate balance. Great beer for an oily, slow-burning, dark cigar. Or some pipe tobacco. Mostly would want the smoke in the air, not to actually take in as it would interfere rather than compliment the beer. 4/4.5/4/3/4 - 4.0"
""
"O: Not a session beer, to be sure, but one of the most complex and interesting beers I've tried."

"O: Very good Imperial Stout, wish I had some chocolate pie to go with, will seek out again"

"Pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with a decent tan head. Rich, rather sweet aroma has notes of sweet chocolate, caramel and molasses. Mouth filling flavor has semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and molasses tones plus hints of honey and fresh-cut wood. Smooth, fizzy texture has plenty of body."

"O- This is an incredible beer, spot on for the style, blends big sweet bourbon flavors with heavily roasted malts and chocolate for a mean combination. I'm really happy I have a second bottle of this, with about a year of age on it it's doing very well."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured dark almost black, minimal dark brown foam and lacing. At first the smell was almost fruity with caramel. Then I get more bourbon. Taste is deep roasty malt, caramel/vanilla and some chocolate with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Also a bit of smoke in there too. As it warms it sweetens some and the caramel, vanilla and bourbon becomes more prominent. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy bit not thick, light carbonation. Overall an excellent beer. Highly recommended. Wish I had a few more."
"O: very well done beer overall - pretty sure I just had the 2011, though it was not specified. Worth it for an $8 pour of this at Eulogy."
""
""
"5 bottles of 2012 ""in the cellar"". YAY!"
""
""
"overall aged very well and i think it could sit around a little long."
"O: This is easily the smoothest RIS I have had the pleasure to taste."
""
"Pours jet black with a small chocolate brown to tan head. In the aroma, mellow but nice bourbon notes. In the taste, chocolate like roast with a bourbon end, and vanilla and oak presence all the way through. A boozy bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry oaky vanilla and bourbon like aftertaste. Big bourbon presence, with a nice stout underneath it all."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic beer, moves up to one of my favorites. Great combination of flavors and so easy drinking for a big beer."
"Simply put, this beer does everything right. The barrel aging adds a lot of flavor without being excessive, and the malt profile is wonderfully complex. This is a sipper that will only improve over time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My only complaint is the the heat from the alcohol, but even this was relatively minimal. I chose to drink this beer now, about 8 months after release in order to still have the oak taste present while diminishing some of the heat from the alcohol. I believe this balance was met, as this was a beautiful and complex experience of a beer."
""
"Powerful bourbon-wood-vanilla combo with a balanced sweetness and drying finsh from lots of alcohol and a fair amount of leafy hops. The barrel treatment is very evident and the alcohol is pretty well integrated. Gets better as it warms, I'd be hard pressed to have to choose between this and BCBS. Its not as rich, sweet or boozy and the mouthfeel is thinner. But it is less hot and more integrated out of the gate. Whereas I can see BCBS aging well for at least 5 years, with Parabola I am not sure if any time in the cellar would be beneficial. Tasty as shit though, I like it quite a bit."
""
""
"Overall an excellent beer. Don't know hoe this will age. I enjoed it to much now to save a bottle."

"7/23/10. Huge thanks to mkade8883 for this awesome brew in my Secret Santa box!! Huge buttery, vanilla, and coconut aromas followed by obvious bourbon. Love it. The flavor doesn’t deliver as much as I was hoping, but there is nice chocolate and coffee, buttery vanilla, a hint of coconut, and a nice warming feel. Very good!"
"A trememdous beer, all around. I’d like to find another one and compare it to an Abyss. Would have been an excellent dessert to the rib-eye I had last night, except I was too full! I will buy this again, despite it’s $15 price."
"Big thanks goes out to Exiled who sent me this one in a trade LONG ago! Batch #1, 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured pitch black with a half finger light tan head that subsided to basically none fairly quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, alcohol, wood, and greatness. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, wood, sweet alcohol, milk chocolate, and dark fruit. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fantastic brew. How in the Hell have I never tried this before!? The aromas and flavors in this brew are ridiculously good and very well balanced. When I saw that it weighed in at 13% I was afraid this one would pound me in the face with alcohol, but that was not the case. Allowing this one to sit in my cellar all this time has definitely worked its magic to subdue the alcohol. Absolutely a must try if you have not done so before. Might have to crack my 2011 to compare in the near future…"
"O - This is a very nice barrel-aged stout. The bourbon is a big component, but it works very well with the heavy chocolate base."

"Overall: Probably my second most favorite Russian Imperial Stout. Spectacular."

"I've tried Parabola a few times, and I've really enjoyed it every time. Although big stouts that are really hot tend to turn me off, Parabola still worked for me. Very complex, and although the barrel flavors are huge, so is the malt bill. Overall, Parabola is a little hot, but still a great beer."

"Jet, jet black and pours like motor oil. Very thin, fine head of bubbles across the top. Deep rich and roasted aroma. Rather boozey but in a good way. Really reeks of bourbon. Just a big old hunk of rich roasted and bourbon flavor. I was not expecting it to be this rich. Nothing wrong with that though. Vanilla, oak and some sherry notes. Dark chocolate and expresso all over the place as well. Sharp bite from the booze, though it almsot comes as a kick off the barrel aging process, not the beer itself. Thick and syrupy rich body. A touch of an acrid burn but that's definately part of the whole body. A total complete desset beer. I could not finish this is one sitting and am enjoying it again a 2nd day. I have a bottle from last year to enjoy. Will stay a want for sure. Killer beer all in."

"O - The are a lot of really nice flavors and aromas, but the mouthfeel is not very pleasant. The alcohol really comes through as well, which takes away from the drinkability."

"O - A brilliant and complex beer. It made the perfect finish to our family Christmas celebration and vacation celebration."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an absolutely wonderful choice to pop open on Christmas Eve Eve. Deliciously dangerous complexity, excellent marriage of roasty/barrel aged flavors. Firestone knocked it out of the park here and I can only wonder what additional age might do to enhance/detract from a stellar beer today."

"O- World class beer, wow, I’ve had this beer before when it first came out. From hearing all the stories about FW beers not aging well I was expecting this beer to have lost some of its complexity, but the beer is still as good as the first time I had it. Very satisfying, everything I love and crave in a quality Bourbon Barrel Aged beer. Glad I have two bottles left to have on a cold winter day."
"O: Wow was the first thing I said, wow this is a good beer. I expected it to have a more boozy flavor because of the nose but I could hardly taste the alcohol. This is very well balanced and delicious beer. Probably one of the best i've ever tasted."

"2010 bottle I've been aging in my cellar- I decided to crack it with my wife in this prelude week to Christmas. I very much like the way the 13% abv edges have been smoothed out and the Bourbon flavors have become integrated into the beer. Definitely noticeable Bourbon notes, but it doesn't dominate the beer, and it's become oh so smooth. Pours inky black and viscous with a thin brown rim of a head and some legs on the glass. Nice aromas that present as a seamless whole- outstanding notes of licorice, vanilla, bourbon, and molasses. The taste is even better- really nice bourbon notes coupled beautifully with roasted notes, dark chocolate, licorice, and a slight woodiness than underlines the beer. Wonderful stuff. Absolutely silky in the mouth, with the sense of having swallowed some excellent drinking chocolate laced with good quality whiskey. Thoroughly enjoyed this, and I'm glad I was patient enough to wait."
""
"O- Was a little nervous at first with big bourbon nose to it. Once it warmed flavors really did blend together very nicely!! Was expecting a little more from the flavors, but wow they really all go together great and make for a great beer. Thanks guys, can't wait to age them a bit more."
"Cost: $17.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."

"Parabola was really good, it had a wonderful balance between the base beer and the bourbon barrel elements. I enjoy a strong bourbon presence and this certainly had one, it just wasn't overwhelming and that's okay. This is a great showcase of the style. Best ever? No, but pretty damn good."

"O- I am enjoying this beer alot. Really wishing I had a few more bottles to let them cellar for a few years. This beer is almost as good as a RIS can be."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer from Firestone that will get better with time when some of the heat from the 12.5% alcohol dies down."
""
""

"This beer is drinking great right now and I'm not certain that cellaring it further would enhance it. Hats off to Firestone, another delicious dark and strong beer. Among the best I've had!"

"O: A good BA stout. Not my favorite. I wish it was a little more bourbon forward."
""
""
"O: Maybe it's the hype, or the fact that I have such fond memories of the small sample I had a couple of years ago at the Portland International Beerfest, but this was a bit of a disappointment, though only a bit. It's still a great beer, but there are better beers out there that are both cheaper and easier to find."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a decent beer. Best enjoyed by sipping. Didn't live up to the hype for me."
""

"O - Wow! A great RIS."
"Just delicious, and a beer that I suspect will only get better with age. Impressive."

"Let this bottle warm some out of the fridge. Poured with a tan, smallish head and a little lace. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is mild, malt, roast, wine, yeast, dates, figs. Flavor's like nose, bittersweet up front, enough carbonic tang to balance. Finish is boozy and the alcohol is striking. killer brew."
""
"O- The most complex and best beer I've ever had."
"O-- Decent sweet beer. was it really aged in a barrel?? That was my biggest question. Bottle says so, so I have to concur. Really disappointed but as a straight RIS it was OK."
""
"A homerun by Firestone Walker. Just wow. One of the best BA stouts I've ever had and probably ever will have."
""
""
""
"Overall: Lot's of stuff going on. Tons of flavor. Huge on the tongue. The only thing holding this one back for me was the sticky syrupy feel on the tongue."
"batch 002. split with mr. cloeren, crack! and immediately the aroma shows its face, 22 oz bottle poured into duvel tulips. gives a pitch black liquid of midnight madness producing a half finger of a soft khaki head, tight bubbles remain for a while covering their tracks as they slowly fall. sweet bourbon straight to the head through the nose with vanilla, barrel characteristics and molasses. before i took the first sip many thoughts were racing through my head that i did not want to be disappointed more so than ever. parabola walked the walk son! the taste is even better perfect balance amongst bourbon, vanilla bean and molasses with appropriate supporting roasted malt and hints of chocolate in the back. complex and layerd to absolute, as it flows and rolls on the palate and finishes it is nothing but absolute silk to my surprise for the age (< 1yr in the bottle). the only flaw for me was that i thought it could of been slightly heavier, perhaps im wrong. it would be easy to drink every drop of this in a sitting. overall this beer was absoultely divine and i could not be happier that i have more. for myself bourbon, vanilla and molasses are my favorite characteristics for stouts and FW nailed it."

"Having had this straight after Barrel Aged Yeti, it didn't come close. I know FW make awesome beers, but this seemed like it had lost a lot of the complexity that i know it probably had."
"O: A nice BA stout, held back slightly by what I perceived as an off note in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, lower carbonation. Everything here is balanced to perfection. Very little warmth from the alcohol. Outstanding."
"O - An excellent beer. I was able to track down another bottle to age and I am looking forward to trying this one a year down the road."
""
""
""
"Overall great beer, wish I could get my hands on another bottle."
"No. 002, 2011. Black with just the faintest of dark brown edges. Brown, soapy bubbles formed a collar while extremely fine bubbles coated the surface of the beer. Decent head retention with a bit of spotty lacing that wasn't too sticky. Bourbon was evident as soon as the cap was popped. Boozy aroma with vanilla and oak apparent, notes of toffee and coconut, roast and chocolate, faint licorice and figs. Great texture, full without being heavy, moderate carbonation that provided an airy mouthfeel, a bit of astringency from the kilned grains and wood, slightly sticky. Alcohol started warm and ended a little hotter, but still well controlled. Nice depth of bitterness, both from hops and the dark grains. This worked well with the considerable malt presence, toffee and chocolate sweetness, roast and light licorice. Quite oaky as well, vanilla throughout, with plenty of bourbon character. Unfortunately, the prominence of the wood and bourbon in the flavour seemed to mask some of the complexity present in the aroma. Overall, a very strong offering from a great brewery."
"Mouthfeel is a tad boozy, as expected, full bodied, chewy, with a resonating sugar cookie and chocolate chip finish."
""
""
"On tap at Capone's Black Friday event, this beer poured out as a very dark black color with a thin tan head on top. The smell of the beer was roasted and sweet, some aromas of wood and sweet bourbon on the nose. The taste of the beer is just stunning... I really couldn't believe how nice this tasted. The sweet bourbon flavors come out perfectly in this brew. The mouthfeel of this beer was thick and oily just like it should be. Overall this brew is special. It's very very good!"

"Had a couple of bottles now, and I must say I'm looking forward to the last one I have in stock. I'm always sharing this one, and I haven't found anyone ever complaining about the smell, taste or mouthfeel. I simply love the smoothness it gives my palate, in those 3 categories. A stout as it should be. Dark. Chocolaty. Coffee. An amazing mouthfeel. In wonderfull balance. They really do make amazing beers, Firestone. Congrats"

"O: Well, hrm. I had huge expectations of this beer, based on my opinion of Firestone Walker, the reputation it has, and the price tag. I'm also unfairly judging it against Abyss, which I consider the best beer I've ever had (which is a substantial statement). That said, this beer disappointed a bit. A good beer? Yeah. It didn't blow me away. At $14 I expected a bit more - I understand production costs, especially on aged beers. The nose implied a much better palate, but it was a bit of a letdown, lots of hot alcohol, a bitter strange finish that wasn't as satisfying."
"O: Amazing beer. Well worth the price. You absolutely need to have this beer a the benchmark for stouts."
"Overall i was pretty impressed with this beer, but it didnt quite matchup to some of the other stouts ive had. Def a sipper, and i appreciate it for that reason"
"2011 vintage courtesy of BrewerB, thanks Brian! This beer pours a medium bodied dark chocolate brown in color with a one finger dark kahki head. It smells of sweet milk chocolate, dark chocolate, roasted malts, sweet vanilla, toffee and creamed coffee. It tastes of bitter chocolates, coffee with cream, a lot of oak, and bourbon. It's a pretty well integrated blend. It drinks very smoothly and isn't as viscous as a lot of imperial stouts. It's overly drinkable for the style and pretty approachable. The bourbon is there but kind of mellow. If I were to not pick I'd say it could he stronger but its not a big deal. Overall this is a fine beer and definitely worth trying. Kudos to FW for making this so available."
"D: I paid $16, which is a fair price for a stout of this caliber. I would go no higher, though. I think some of the tannic and bitter flavors could stand to be toned down a bit, but I'm sure if I wait a few months the beer will hit its sweet spot for me. Right now it's not in the top-tier of barrel-aged stouts, but it's just on the cusp."
"Overall: My first time time trying this beer and I like it. Unfortunately the availability in Southern California isn't so hot compared to other RISs I would consider in it's class (e.g. Abyss). I would gladly seek it out at the price I paid if it were distributed in decent numbers to my area."
"This is just about as black as black can get. No light gets through this one. Has a minimal brown head, if you can even call it that. Its more of a thin blanket that recedes to the sides of the glass. It leaves minimal, spotted lacing down the glass. The aroma on this one is amazing. A very strong vanilla presence, chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, and a nice touch of bourbon booziness. It smells sweeter and sweeter as it warms up as well. On to the taste test. Just as the nose described, really heavy tones of vanilla, bitter chocolate, coffee, oak, and booze. The boozy taste is by no means in the way. Its the perfect complement to the rich sweetness. Taste is just phenomenal and very complex, all of the flavors just seem to meld with each other perfectly. It has a very rich, thick, and creamy mouthfeel. Just phenomenal. I was very excited to try this, and very glad to say that this exceeds its hype. Being someone that is fairly new to BA Imperial Stouts, they are quickly becoming my new favorite style. Cheers."
"it's solid. a straight ""good"" across the board. the first impressions were impressive, but it didn't sustain its initiated characteristics enough to warrant an elite standing. i enjoyed it, but i'm definitely coming back to see if i'm just being picky and snooty from the hype."
"Overall: A top bourbon barrel beer with complex aromas and flavors. Just thinking of my experience with this beer makes me start to scheme as to how I can get more."
"O - As I drink this, I can't help but think of just how well made this is. Everything is so well balanced, the mouthfeel makes this very drinkable and the aroma is prevalent but not overbearing. The flavor is complex, inviting, and delicious. No part of this beer screams out and dominates, but the sum of the parts create an amazing beer and one that you can tell was well made. I could drink this every day."
"O: I like this a lot, it has a nice oak wood flavor with a nice vanilla spicy bourbon kick to it. The roasty malts and chocolate flavors finish fantastic."
"Overall: One of the best applications of bourbon-barrel aging I've ever encountered. Smooth and well moderated. Tons of flavor and depth. Time will only smooth out some of the heat. Truly a great take on the style."
"O: A very good imperial stout that is drinking excellently right now. I was fortunate enough to grab another bottle at a store in CO and I will be hanging on to it for another two or so months, as I'm really enjoying the way this tastes right now."
"O: Well, it’s different, I’ll give it that. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I didn’t think this beer was incredibly satisfying. I understand that new, interesting flavors are the goal, but sometimes they can expose the tastebuds to an unpleasant palate. So, as it stands, there’s a dozen other stout’s I’d have before this; I’m still open to tasting other bottles, though, just to make sure I’m not crazy."
"Overall: Off-flavor aside, I'm really impressed with this one, and look forward to trying one that's been properly cellared. This beer reminded me of Ivan the Terrible, which is probably the best imperial stout I've had. Can't wait to try it again, and highly recommend it!"
"O: This is just a wonderfully crafted beer. The blending effort and careful aging process is very clear in the smooth, balanced and complex flavors and aromas present. I'm very happy I ended up with a few bottles this year, and actually don't plan to cellar this as I think it is so well-rounded fresh in it's bottle year."
"An absolute phenomenal beer that I was I could have an unlimited supply of. Nice and strong with a great flavor that comes through from the bourbon barrel aging. The only thing that simply keeps this from getting a perfect score is that it didn't 'floor' me. Still, amazing beer."
"O. Very good barrel aged imperial stout, not sure if it makes my top 10 though."
"Overall, this was very enjoyable. Glad I have a couple to age."
"SUBLIME, MUST HAVE!"
"This brew is pretty heavy with nice carbonation. There was a bit of an alcohol burn with it, but it wasn't overwhelming. This was my first time imbibing in this particular beer and I enjoyed it very much. It was smooth...very drinkable for 12.5%!"
"Tremendous stout! Served on tap and poured into a tulip glass, this beer was a rich opaque black with a lovely chocolate brown head, nearly a finger of it, which receded a bit during the session and left just a bit of soapy lacing behind. Luscious aroma of rich bittersweet chocolate, with notes of bitter coffee and a touch of vanilla and bourbon. All these qualities followed through in an excellent way on the palate, with the smooth, rich chocolate taking the foreground, both in the front and the finish, with a good balance of coffee bitterness mid-palate. Alcohol warmth definitely present, but barely boozy at all in the taste. Woody with subtle oak tones, and just a hint of dark fruits: cherries and figs. Full-bodied, rich, and quite the amazing drink overall."
"HV"
"overall - still a great beer... had the same night has cbs, fifty fifty evan and four roses, ba boris and boris so its getting a tough review."
"I went over my standard $10.00 bomber limit for this, and have no regrets at all. A superior Imperial Stout which I will enjoy each sip of tonight."
"O - Great overall imperial stout. This is excellent fresh and seems like it would age with the best of them. Definitely a sipper, but the alcohol is hidden far too well. Incredible smoothness and complexity. One of the best I've had in recent memory."
"Thick, sticky, and luscious. Warming but never hot or boozy. Chewy as any self-respecting RIS ought to be. At 12% I'll easily sip my way through the entire bomber to myself. This is only further evidence that Firestone Walker NEEDS to distribute to OH. Seriously. While not quite as complex or unique as FW14, I think I prefer this beer. And though I didn't buy this myself, I want to say that it is cheaper to boot (paid $21 in Chicago for a bottle of the anniversary beer)."
"Pours a black color with a caramel colored head that breaks down to an oily slick with a very thin soapy head. So much going on with the aroma. Aroma of dark fruit and chocolate with hints of coffee, cherry, earthiness, and bourbon. Wow. Has a silky, creamy sweet caramel, chocolate taste with a nice bitter, biting layer from the barrel. Perhaps some citrusy hops are coming through. Some notes of dark fruit, coffee, and bourbon on the finish. What a beer. FW is truly an excellent brewery."
"Dark and thick with a tan but short lived head and minimal lace. Aroma and predominant flavor is chocolate and malty. Up front there is lots going on. Licorice leads to dark chocolate with some bourbon/oaky tones and dried fruit in the middle. A bit of booziness, but not too bad for the ABV. Very big body and medium carbonation. Glad I saved this one for dessert and a cool night."
"Overall: This is a beer that definitely lives up to the hype. A bourbon barrel stout that still manages to be delicate and complex is a rare find. I will definitely try to stock up on this beer and look forward to having it again."
"jd"
"Overall this is a great stout. The aroma could have been better but the flavors make up for it. I wish the alcohol burn would have been a little less. I'm very glad to have tried this beer and happy that it does live up to the hype. Thanks a bunch for the beer Brooks!"
"Overall, ISO: Parabola"
"Parabola is an excellent beer, but it is perhaps a bit more tame than I was anticipating. Ideally, I would have liked a stronger bourbon presence and a more robust body. To those of you who have a fresh bottle, I would definitely advise you to cellar it for at least a year. We sampled a 2010 vintage next to a 2011 and the former showcased a flavor profile that was far better melded and an alcohol presence that was much more subdued than the latter."
"A world-class -bbal RIS. If they produced fewer cases this would achieve whale status; but FW made enough to go around and thus I'm able to try it without jeopardizing my family's financial stability."
"this is defiantly a solid, very well made BA stout, one of the better ones, but there are still a few i would take over this, 09 BCBS, and BA sexy chocolate to be specific. the 12 months spent in the barrel really does show with a big, smooth bourbon character with some oak as well. this is really a bourbon lover dream. personally i think this would benefit from at least a year or 2 of age."
"O: Despite its strength, the beer doesn’t taste overly strong but is a good sipping beer because its complex aroma and taste will retain your interest."
"D= Its a sipper for sure but a damn fine one that I would go a long way to get more of."
"O - Easily as good as the top imp stouts in the world. Firestone Walker is fast becoming a favorite brewery of mine with the quality in their elite beers. Highly recommended for Imperial Stout lovers, and I'd love on eof these on a cold January evening."
"O – A fantastic RIS. Surprisingly drinkable for the booze."
"O: A+ for sure on this one. Currently in my top 5 of the year, if not all time. I just wish I had more bottles to lay down for a while."
"This is an exceptional beer. With it being 12.5% the alcohol could barely be detected. There are not that many beers that make sit back and go wow, this is one of them. Believe the hype."
"Edit - over many revisits, I'm not quite as impressed with this but it remains relatively consistent from year-to-year."
"O: Not a bad RIS, but in no way does it stand up to its hype, IMO. It just didn't work for me, too one dimensional. I kept going back to it, not because it was so good, but because I truly wanted to find something I liked in the beer, but alas there wasn't much to be found. Maybe my other bottle will fare better with a little age on it."
"A fine example of what a barrelaged stout can be. I'm glad i have a few more bottles tucked away in the cellar!"
"This is definitely a special beer, one to be sipped and savored as it gradually warms."
"Overall a really big imperial stout and a special one as well. Worth the effort to seek this one out."
"O - A delicious barrel aged RIS. I prefer bourbon county stout over this, but then again I've only had the 2009 vintage. This beer is already crazy smooth and delicious at a few months old, I'm sure with some age this will become incredible."
"O- This one has it all... Near perfection! I can't wait to see how my other bottle ages. Other than a bit hot (which never really bothers me), and it could be a touch thicker... I have nothing bad at all to say about this fantastic stout! So well done... wish this was more available to me!!!"
"This stout is huge...absurdly huge. I can't imagine how much malt was used to make this beast - the Midwest/Great Lakes area is lucky to finally have it here. Fans of chocolate bombs should seek this out. Splendid stuff."
"overall this is a great oak aged stout. my favorite? probably not. worth picking up though."
"OVERALL: The Parabola really dose live up to the hype and at $18 a bottle, this was more than worth it. I can not wait to try my next one."
"O - This brew needs a few years to mellow and relax... I still have two more shipped directly from Cali, this one was snagged in Denver... I'll be anxious to re-review if worthy."
"What a way to cap off a beer tasting!"
"D-A very solid and complex beer, yet, when it comes to bourbon barell-aged stouts, Bourbon County is still number one for me. I wish the feel on this was a little richer and the malt background was more pronounced to balance the bourbon."
"22oz. bottle served at 53 degrees in a tulip. Pours one shade shy of black with a frothy, half inch, mocha-colored head that eventually dissipates into a tight band around the shoulders. No lacing on this one. Nose expresses bourbon, licorice, burnt sugar, a hint of vanilla and ethanol. This beer is a major malt bomb. There's quite a bit of char happening in the flavor profile and the alcohol is a little caustic - it definitely lets you know it's there. Bourbon and vanilla resurface towards the back once the alcohol dissipates and a suggestion of toffee also reveals itself in the mix. The mouthfeel on this beer is exceptional. Body is medium in consistency with an oily, slightly viscous quality and there's also some residual alcohol burn that lingers at the back of the throat between quaffs. Carbonation is very pleasant; not too assertive, yet not still. Overall, I found this beer quite enjoyable, albeit a little hot. That said, I'm glad I tried it fresh because I'd definitely like to see how this one develops over time. I think it has great cellaring potential and in my opinion, will only improve with age."
"O: Overall, an awesome beer. Very enjoyable, I will savor every sip. Very glad that my local beer guy hung on to this one for me."
"Overall: Well crafted beer, a heavy flavorful stout that lives up to its reputation."
"O: This didn't quite live up to the enormous hype, but it's still a world-class beer nonetheless. Delicious"
"Appearance is black with a thin head. The nose of this beer has bourbon, chocolate, black licorice and roasted malts. Its` taste contains more chocolate, caramel, dark fruits, vanilla and bourbon. A very tasty beer that lived up the hype for me. With a mouthfeel that is nice and smooth, some alcohol that stays with you in the finish. But in general, this higher ABV offering drinks very well and is an excellent beer."
"O: Good, but nothing mindblowing. Maybe I'm not the biggest fan of Firestone Walker."
"Bottle. Pour was Joan Jett black with a small tan head. The aroma was coffee liquor and alcohol. The taste is unique with big but smooth bourbon notes, molasses, roasted malts, and backbeats of toffee, coffee, and charred oak. Clearly Parabola doesn’t give a damn about it’s bad reputation..."
"Taste is a bit smokey, lots of chocolate and sweet malt. mouthfeel is creamy and chewy. carbonation is light and smooth."
"overall a stellar RIS, one of those rare hyped beers that meets (even exceeds) expectations. another home run from firestone walker."
"D: Such a big barrel aged stout that delivers on all fronts. There is still a fair amount of alcohol, so I would love to see how this tastes after a year of aging"
"Overall this beer is fantastic. I was really worried that the hype behind this beer might turn out to be just that. It is everything people say it is. The flavor is really really good. A fantastic beer that if you see one you should buy it immediately since they will be even more scarce and hard to find every day that goes by."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is just over medium, with a fair amount of carbonation. This was the weak point of the beer for me. Would prefer to see little more body, maybe a touch less carbonation. Overall though, a very nice barrel aged stout. Again, the barrel qualities were excellent, and the base was more than enough to hang with the barrels."
"O-Just a wonderful beer. The balance is the true greatness, chocolate, bourbon and vanilla balance out perfectly with slight coffee and roasted malt."
"O- An incredible beer that I was stoked to find on draft. This is definitely on my short list of top Russian Imperial Stouts. After having this on tap, I immediately drove to pick up a few bottles at a nearby liquor store that I called while drinking this beer."
"O-Great brew especially for an RIS, loved this one great blend of everything."
"O- Truly an outstanding beer. Unfortunately this isn't something that distributes in our area which is a shame. But maybe it's for the best...I imagine I'd go broke quickly spending $20 each time I wanted one of these (which would be often)! A wonderful beer and I'm glad I got the chance to try it."
"D - Great RIS flavor; I can't say enough for this beer. every category of this beer is just fantastic and should be tried by anyone who likes a very good, memorable beer"
"My benchmark for barrel aged stouts. Absolutely phenomenal. Hasn't evolved much from the first time I've had it, though there is a more pronounced smokiness to it. We'll see what it tastes like in another year!"
"O: This is a delicious RIS. They pack so much flavour in but the end result is delicious and mellow."
" Overall wow this is one of the best barrel aged stouts I have had to date. I will recommend this all day long."
"I had this beer again on the 11th of December 2011 on a beer tasting at Erik's place, with thanks to Thijs, Jeff and Erik. It was the last beer of the session and a perfect way to end this day. I didn't alter my review because I still think it's a pretty damn good beer."
"I loved this beer fresh, in all its boozy glory. I imagine this beer will mature into something quite complex, but I'm considering drinking my remaining stash sooner rather than later."
"Overall: An exceptionally good beer. The only down side was the noticeable alcoholic finish, but with time that should mellow out."
"Pours jet black with a tan small tan head. Smell is a huge bourbon presence some nice roasted malts. Big vanilla and milk choclate on the taste some slight toffe sweetness. Mouthfeel and carbonation are pretty spot on. Great sipper but nothing mind blowing."
"Overall: Another great beer from FW and a classic barrel aged stout. However, this one seems a little hyped. It doesn't come close to Bourbon County and I found Abacus to be much more complex and original...still a great beer though."
"Overall a tasty barrel aged Imperial Stout. I'm wishing I had waited at least another year to open this though, and that is just what I will do with my other bottle. Hopefully the extra aging will make it that much better..."
"O - Easily one of the best Barrel-Aged Stouts I've had, this is an exceptional beer!"
"o-beautiful RIS with a lot of potential to age. Cannot wait to taste with a few years on it."
"O. This is a special beer. I am glad I have a few more to crack open in the next few months and years. It will always be for a special occasion because this is a beer that deserves it. This beer was not over hyped it deserves all the hype and praise it gets because wow it keeps getting better with every sip and blows away ones expectations. Buy/Trade or do whatever you need to do to get your hands on this one because you will be kicking yourself if you dont."
"O: Overall very good. Interesting flavor, and presentation, but it lacks grace. Definitely a great beer, but the finish comes on a little strong for me. Still... damn tasty."
"2014 Vintage: Just as good as ever. Maybe even better this time around. Not quite as much heat on this one. Bourbon comes through nicely but will plenty of room to let the stout shine"
"Overall there is not enough praise I can give this beer. This is a picture perfect RIS, and without a doubt the best one I have had to date. I would gladly buy it by the case if it was easier to obtain. My hunt for this most elusive beer was well worth it."
"O: 1st taste if parabola and I'm lucky to have gotten a few extra bottles. Amazing is the only word I could use to describe it. Tastes great and the booze at 12.5% is not noticeable until halfway through the bottle as it is very drinkable."
"Full, luscious, creamy body that slides across the tongue, nicely carbonated. Excellent taste and feel on this one, and I'd really like to see how this does after another 6-12 months after the hops die down a little more."
"#1300"
"O: I thought this was a great barrel-aged RIS. The flavors all meshed wonderfully and I wonder how good this could be with a little bit of age on it."
"T: Tootsie roll, roasted malt, milk chocolate, dark chocolate covered raisin, leather, mocha, a bit of smoke and just a little booziness. Amazing. I would love to have some more of this."
"Had I known, I would have had 4 of these!"
"A stellar beer. True perfection."
"O-Another home run for FW. Fantastic brew. I can't wait to let a few bottles from the newest batch age, because batch 001 was amazing."
"O - I'm generally not a fan of bourbon barrel beers, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. The bourbon is not overpowering, and compliments the heavy chocolate notes well. Alcohol presence is hidden extremely well. A nice treat, but at this price, I probably won't seek it out again."
"O - Very good, one of my favorite bourbon aged imp stouts."
"June 15, 2012 update - tried the 2012 version. Lovely aroma of Yukon Jack, and that hot malt is endlessly tasty. But it still tastes like something that squirts in your mouth out of a liqueur chocolate."
"Overall this might be the best Russian Imperial stout I have ever had. I am so glad I have another bottle of this one."
"Overall: This is a really great beer especially at the high ABV that doesn't feel like 12%. Highly recommended and I wish I had more."
"O- Amazing beer that is defenitly a big sipper, lives up to its rep and defenitly satisfying. Share this one."
"though there are people who say Firestone's barrel-aged beers don't age well... the alcohol burn in this one subsides significantly after just 6 months. I wouldn't age it for years though. 6-9 months seemesto be the sweet spot for this one."
"O-a very tasty and a very serious stout. its definitely something that will both wake you up and then put you to sleep. its not very drinkable, in any way. this is a sipper that i'm glad i tried, but i won't be craving this any time soon."
"Damn fine beer!"
"Overall: very slow sipping but very flavorful. This would be better aged as it is a bit boozy now."
"I’ve only had a few firestone walker beers, but all have been outstanding for their styles and simply showcase level beers. This one…well it is competing with perhaps my favorite beers so it is hard to compare. It isn’t the coffee forward beer I had been lead by reviews to believe I was about to enjoy. It has barrel aged but really it reminds me more of non-barrel aged Russian imperials. All that said for the 25th best beer in the world, I’m a bit unimpressed. A perfect 5 in complexity, but is complex enough? Very very good, but truly great? Maybe a hair short. e"
"Overall this beer is stellar. Firestone Walker is definitely winning with their barrel aging series of beer and I have loved Abacus, the anniversary series and now Parabola. Definitely recommended for fans of barrel aged beers and big boy stouts. I am going to call this a sessionable Barrel aged Imperial stout as it is really balanced and blended so well you almost don't recognize the boozy barrel flavors initially. Basically, yum."
"A tasty beer that doesn't quite live up to the hype (for me)."
"O: A solid BA RIS that might be amazing with a little more time. It's a bit hot and bourbon forward right now, but otherwise a really solid RIS with a good bit of complexity."
"Im looking forward to ageing this beast for a couple yrs and trying again, i can only imagine it will get better"
"O: Absolutely phenomenal! Just the right amount of bourbon. Not too overpowering with fantastic vanilla and oak flavors. Complex, rich, thick and deep in flavor. Almost no alcohol presence. Makes an excellent desert beer. Save this one for a special occasion."
"Good balanced flavor with alcohol enhancing it. Roasted a little high and there are some nice notes but they are more at the end rather than throughout the beer. It’s extremely easy considering the beer with a great smooth flavor but, honestly, somewhat disappointing. My expectations were unfortunately high."
"O: This beer has ruined other Imperial Stouts for me. This is probably one of THE best stouts I've had. I can't wait to see how this beer develops over time."
"Candied bourbon...this is a great boozy RIS. Normally I struggle with an alcohol as apparent as this, but for some reason this works for me. The bourbon is prominent, but there are many other complexities here. Vanilla and some barleywine on the nose. Caramel and molasses on the palate. Sticky and sweet, and of course the booze. Very warming and a true pleasure to drink. This is a really fine liqueur, riding incognito as a beer."
"D: Fantastic. One of the most well-crafted beers i've had in a while. Easy drinkability for a very full bodied brew."
"Overall a fantastically smooth Barrel aged imperial stout. It is not hot like many barrel age stouts yet it has a nice oaky and mild bourbon flavor."
"Overall great, worthy the hype I think. not the best of the big Imperial Stouts around, but definitely a great Imperial Stout. Big and bold, great stout flavors, doesn't overpower with roasted malts or briny scorched malts, and doesn't overpower with booze or sweetness but definitely lets you know it has both. The oak, wood, and vanilla help round it some, but the bourbon is just an afterthought compared to the big malts, chocolate, and other big flavors. The nice creamy and lucious feel are great. And then when the big earthy spicy hops kick in it really brings it up to hype level of awesomeness. Can't wait to see how it ages."
"Overall - Complexity in a beer is always welcomed here. The first sip showed how complex and rich this one is. In that respect it wanted to let you know that you should savor this beast. The finish did not linger for long, so I was caught taking quicker sips than I should of to savor it."
"Overall/Drinkability-The complexity and strength demand this beer be sipped and savored but it's so addictively delicious and drinkable for its ABV that you may find yourself taking sips in rapid succession."
"O: Very good for the style. Lots of malt character. No session beer here; daunting ABV."
"Notes: All hype is deserved. So far all the barrel aging, blending, and more I've been fortunate enough to try from Firestone Walker has been extraordinary and this one is right there. This might age beautifully, that is if one can resist keeping one set aside."
"Have you ever had bourbon county or bourbon barrel aged Old Rasputin? Well, this beer tastes like it's in between the two. The bourbon is a little hidden in the smell, but it comes through in the taste. However, it isn't as dominating as in the bourbon county, allowing the dark fruits to make their tiny presence known. Overall, a very good example of why bourbon barrel aging should be done more often."
"I've looked at my scores and I don't think they'll keep the A+ rating going. Sorry. Maybe I should have finished half the bottle before I started to review. Maybe I'll come back after that and redo my scores. Nah. A phenomenal beer to be sure though and I will fight like a bride on a budget at a sale featuring designer wedding dresses at 90% off when it comes out again next year."
"O: This is a tremendous beer. I only wish that my beer store had (a) bought more; and (b) allowed us to purchase more than one bottle. Outstanding with my leftover ribs. Cheers!"
"This beer pours a dark black with a nice sticky thick brown head. the smell is sweet bourbon roasted malts, hints of coffee and cocoa. the flavor follows suit with bourbon stealing the show. the roasted malts are present along with the coffee and cocoa notes. the mouthfeel is full, but not quite as full as I was expecting. overall this beer is amazing, and the best bourbon barrel aged stout I have had to date."
"O - Overall, this beer was spectacular. My only qualm, which is pretty trivial, is the lack of long retention. Nose could also be slightly stronger. This is still a spectacular beer. Glad I have 5 more bottles to mess around with."
"For the first couple sips, I thought, ""This is indeed a great beer, with nice dessert flavors balanced out by bitterness and heat; around a 4.5 in most categories."" Then in all aspects the beer just kept getting better... if you want more out of a beer than Parabola delivers, you're probably asking too much or are confused. Seriously close to perfection."
"Delicious brew. Still very hot but in a year or two this one is going to shine."
"My goodness what a brew! I’m a sucker for bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts and this is top shelf stuff right here...right up there with KBS and BCBS. Saying this is amazing makes me feel like I’m selling it short...adjectives just cannot do it justice. Can’t thank Ryan enough for this one...wow!"
"EDIT: the burnt flavor i was saying i liked earlier, well i dont like it so much now that its a lot warmer and closer to the bottom of the bottle, this taste is everlasting torture in your mouth unless you enjoy that ashy burnt carbonistic taste, pasted on your tongue. im not gonna change my score or rating or whatever but this is a bit irrattating"
"Drank at 55-60. Smells of dark chocolate. Pours a jet black color and has moderate lacing. Nice level of carbonation. Surprisingly light in body for such depth in flavor. Hints of bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate. Chocolatey aftertaste. Surprisingly alcoholic, sipped slowly. One of my favorite beers of the year for sure."
"Overall: 2010 - wins by an ever so slight margin. These two beers side by side was an exceptional treat."
"Poured out an oily black with some reddish highlights when held up to the light. Brownish head that was about half a finger but still stuck around for the whole beer. Nose is full and vibrant. Chocolate and coffee are big with cherry brandy and bourbon. Vanilla and roasted dark malts. Body is thick and warming. Flavor is a complex combination of layers. Chocolate and coffee, roasted dark malts, boozey bourbon and plum/raisin/cherry from the barrels. There is a definite alcohol finish that burns a little at your throat but it doesn't bother my palette because of the numerous flavors still lingering. I bought another bottle I plan on aging a couple years and at that point I'm sure the alcohol will smooth out and the many flavors will be meshed even better."
"Super, silky smooth and creamy. An awesome beer, but definitely a sipper."
"This is really a fantastic beer. Huge and complex aromas and flavors, all playing off each other exceptionally. The aging in bourbon barrels seems to have imparted as much oak and vanilla as bourbon. Probably the most most balanced barrel aged stout I've had this fresh."
"O - Amazing RIS. I'm so glad I got to try this. I Probably won't be getting another bottle of this some time soon so I' going to enjoy the hell out of this."
"Pours a pitch black along with a finger of creamy khaki colored head, leaving light whisps of lacing. The nose carries strong sweet bourbon barrel, bittersweet chocolate, toasted sweet coconut, freshly dark roasted coffee. The taste mirrors the nose if not somewhat amplified. Goes down relatively easy though it is a touch sweet and you know you are strong beer. Looking forward to trying this with some age on it."
"Yes this is one fine beer for sure. Black as pitch with a one a half finger light tan head. Fades away to a tan ring, but leaves lacing sheeting down the glass. The aroma is lovely bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, sweet white oak, and oh so balanced. What the aroma advertises the flavor delivers. Big on roasted malt, chocolate, bitter malt and paired with brilliant barrel aging - bourbon, oak, vanilla and char without being over the top. The finish is chocolatey, ashy and dry, not sweet or cloying in anyway. Nice and thick, but a little hot on the end. Overall I truly love this beer, eager to see how it ages."
"O - This isn't just a beer, it's an experience, from the box packaging to the bottle, right down to what lies within. Definately the best stout I have had (although I am not normally a stout guy). Blended incredibly well, with all the flavors coming together in perfect harmony, and throw in 13%abv and I will seek this out whenever possible."
"O: This is a keeper, I had not expected it to be this good based on the hype that some other beers have and have small run numbers. I cannot hate a great product that is brewed in larger quantities. Bravo Firestone, bravo"
"Pours a jet black color, nice carbonation, with a one-finger creamy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, tons of chocolate/toffee notes, vanilla, slight bourbon note. The taste is malty, sweet, with lots of chocolate/toffee. Full/Medium Body. The ABV is too up front on this one. A very tasty brew."
"A tasty treat, very happy to get a bottle of this, will open it at a stout tasting when the weather starts to get a little cooler."
" O- Very good stuff- I think I liked it a bit better as a blend in 13, but it`s strong on its own two legs."
"O - Well, I wish I had saved it longer. It seems like this would be exquisite with subdued alcohol notes. I guess some might call it a boozy mess. It's more of a boozy delight."
"very strong share with a buddy or loved one...enjoy"
"O: A really good BA stout, with pretty intricate flavors and characteristics. I'm not sure how old this bottle is but a couple more months would only help; however it's quite enjoyable now."
"the CPJ"
"O: Seek this out, gets one of my highest recommendations. Great job Firestone Walker!!"
"O: Amazing beer, up there with the other highly regarded RIS, less roasted and coffee flavors than KBS, but the sweetness here is balanced well and makes this a must purchase"
"O- Amazing RIS. Firestone-Walker hits another one out of the park."
"This brew pours a dark dark brown and settlea pitch black with mocha head. Oily lacing slides down the glass with grace. The nose is chocolate infused with oak, vanilla, basically bourbon characteristics. The taste is much the same. Sweet choxolate and toffee are presented up front, followed by a slight booze welcome. The mouthfeel is sticky and full, leaving a great coating on my palate. Overall, this brew packs a great punch full of originality and tastiness. Barrels are working wonders here in this brew."
"Overall: Lives up to the hype and I am so glad they distribute near me. Very solid beer and I am glad I have a vertical started as I would love to see how this ages over the years!"
"Excellent offering from FW. Really enjoyed this beer."
"This is a top notch imperial stout well worth the hype and deserves to be in the discussion with the big boys."
"O- This is wonderful and will get plenty good with time. I suggest letting it warm up past 55 as it only seems to taste better the warmer it gets. This beer is still young, but its roughness is pleasent and reminiscent of sipping on a fine bourbon. Well done."
"O- Truly an amazing RIS. It could use a little aging but I have not had a better example of this style."
"Thanks so much to my friend Ken for bringing this one over last Friday night. Poured a deep, opaque black color, with a nice tan head. Aromas of oak, black licorice, bourbon and dark chocolate. On the palate, this one is full bodied and boozy, with flavors of bourbon, dark chocolate, oak and vanilla. Excellent; welcome to Colorado."
"Feel is drier than tap, and it was fairly dry. Some tannin and velvet-ness at once. The chocolate gives way to a prune-like finish. Still smooth and darn tasty"
"2011 batch 2. Pours dark black with huge white head, brown lacing. Smells of bourbon, oak, malt, vanilla, chocolate, and a bit of cherry. Taste is mostly bourbon, followed by a sweet malt, chocolate, then comes the vanilla, and then slammed with more bourbon. Everything seems kind of meshed together though. Not layered very well. Burning in my nose from the bourbon. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Bourbon burns my cheeks. Kind of a funny finish on this. Overall, this dude is way too hot. It just tastes messy to me. It's good, but not what I was expecting at all. Very underwhelming from the reputation, and the rating, IMO. This was hard to get, and I've had better beers that are easier for me to get. I do have 2 bottles left, and I'm not touching one at all for at least a year. I'm hoping the bourbon mellows and there will be less of a mess."
"O: Deceptively drinkable at 13%. Actually dangerously so. The beer got better and better as it warmed. Cut out the overpowering soy taste and this is a home run."
"Pours a solid black with a creamy fluffy coffee colored head that sticks around for a bit. Smells of coffee, chocolate, licorice, with hints of vanilla, oak, sweet bourbon and alcohol. Thick like maple syrup body has a creamy smooth mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. Wow this one has some residual sugars that's for sure. Taste starts out with licorice and chocolate but they are assaulted with bourbon, vanilla and oak very quickly. Coffee and chocolate step in but disappear as the whole thing turns into an oddly dry finish. Long lingering alcohol heat and earthy hop bite rolled in roasted grains. This is a big beer that is tasty. I find it a bit hot in the finish, I'm curious to see what a little age does to this one."
"Bought the rest that was on the shelf from the only craft shop that carried it."
"O- Bloody Brilliant. I could wax poetic about this beer for hours. Only minor flaws mar what was an otherwise fantastic tipple, flaws which will probably be eliminated after a year or two of aging. If I were king of the world, I would drink this with and for breakfast, lunch and dinner."
"O - Wow, that was the first word that came to mind after the first sip. This beer is as close as excellence can get in my opinion. By far the best beer for me this year and definitely in my top 5 all-time. Thank god I have one more bottle aging!"
"Another big Want brought forth thanks to this BIF. Good times. It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, molasses, very light oak, vanilla, and caramel. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate, roasted malts, molasses, light vanilla, very light coffee, and an even lighter touch of char. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda chewy feel. Overall, a great impy stout, one that seems to warrant the hype it receives. Get some."
"I stalked the forums on this site for weeks and was lucky to grab a bottle at Hawthornes in the one day or so before it sold out. This beer poured black with a thin tan head. The aroma was of bourbon and oak, with notes of vanilla. The taste was a mix of notes of whiskey, brandy, raisons, and vanilla along with with some hop bitterness and alcohol burn in the finish as it warmed up. The mouthfeel was creamy and relatively light considering it's a 13% RIS. There's definitely a lot going on with this beer so it's better to sip it slow so you don't miss anything. This was a phenomenal beer and was worth all the effort it took to get it, and also worth the $21 I spent on the bottle. At this point, I'll try anything that this brewery puts out."
"Parabola pours an impenetrable black. The dark caramel head ends up at three fingers of height. The foam shows good staying power, but lacing is a bit on the light side. The nose is very good, but not great for a barrel aged stout. Sweet milk chocolate with a vanilla base is the predominant aroma, but there are also background notes of coffee and a smooth bourbon presence. That set the expectations for an above average beer, but the flavor profile blows right past that en route to legendary. The entirety of the nose is present, and in addition, caramel, cherries, and marshmallow can be appreciated on any given sip. There's so much going on with this beer that not everything gets to shine through each time I raise my glass, but it's all here and it's all delicious. The body is as rich and full as I could possibly want, with carbonation that just cuts through the sweetness and preserves the beer's malty nature. I'm not sure that I'm ready to declare Parabola my favorite barrel aged stout (hi Bourbon County Vanilla, Rare), but if it's not it's surely in the pantheon of great beers, and more proof that no one is consistently brewing big beers to the quality the Firestone Walker is"
"O: Unquestionably one of the best stouts I’ve ever had. Incredible range of flavors that somehow remain balanced and appreciable."
"Parabola 2011 looks black, thick, and syrupy, but that syrupyness does not translate to the taste or the mouthfeel; it's drier than you would expect. The bourbon soaked wood hits you... and burns you. It's not as balanced of a beer as KBS flavorwise and a little too hot with the bourbon. I feel myself wanting more dark chocolate, better quality coffee flavors, and less bourbon and oak. Hints of Madagascar Vanilla bean shine on the palate, but the smell of Parabola is better than the taste for me."
"Parabola really is a fantastically amazing beer. Very few things live up to the hype, but I'm glad to report that this particular brew not only delivers, but sets the bar so high for other beers of its style. So glad Firestone Walker is distributing on the East Coast now, allowing me and my fellow Mid-Atlantic BAs the opportunity to taste this superb drink."
"Overall: I had this at Howie and Sons in Visalia. I have had it before, and I have always loved it. This is probably one of the best bourbon aged beers I have ever had."
"O - As stated above, this might be my favorite stout of the year that's widely available. It's just a great beer for a great price and can be had without standing in ridiculous 4 hour lines at brewery releases."
"Bought on 7/21/11, and tasted on the same day. Poured it into my trusty Shakey's Mug, and it poured jet black with a nice tan head on it. I have to say that I was unimpressed with the smell. I tend to like the molassesey smelling stouts. Once I took a taste of it my opinion quickly changed. This is one fantastic tasting stout. I really liked the after burn in your throat you get about a minute after drinking it. It tastes of strong coffee, and dark chocolate. It has an after taste of bourbon to it. I have been eating a Chocolate Crisp Bar, bought at Aldis, with each stout that I drink to see if it brings out the chocolate taste. I can say that this one goes great with a piece of chocolate when you drink it. This one has been the tastiest by far."
"O- I would say Parabola lived up to the hype. Abacus has a slight edge in my book over Parabola both Parabola is one of the best Imperial Stout's I have ever had. Can't wait to try this on tap somewhere."
"Overall I really dig this one. I'm confused with the release date though but at the same time delighted. I only wish I could get this on a regular basis."
"The sweet lip smacking taste was extremely well blended and balanced with great and complex flavors. Will definitely seek this one out again."
"Overall this is a great beer but I'm on the edge about seeking out more. I'll probably wait until next time it releases and make another pilgrimage to NY beer mecca."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch khaki head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. The smell of this beer is very complex with toasted coconut, vanilla, wood, milk chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste is the same as the nose with more of a cocoa powder flavor coming through than milk chocolate. Mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with very complex smells and flavors. Some of the smells and flavors remind me a lot of Abacus which I can only assume is from the barrel aging program both beers went through. I am glad I have a few more of these in my cellar to enjoy in the future."
"Mouthfeel is incredible. My brother said it perfectly– it drinks exactly like chocolate milk. Same smooth and silky texture. An absolutely, incredible feel. Thankfully we were able to pick up multiple bottles of this mathematical shape. I had huge expectations for this beer, after hearing many good things about it, and it really surpassed them. Thank you to FSW for actually distributing to us in NY. A long time want for me!"
"Batch 002. Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours a thick, viscous black with a large dark tan head that slowly recedes. The smell is rich and chocolate. It is big and luscious with a hint of roastiness. There are notes form the barrel aging with some vanilla and oak. The flavor is a bit boozier from what I've have liked it to be, but nice regardless. Flavor also picks up chocolate and perhaps some caramel with a big dose of coffee, oak, vanilla, dark fruits, and alcohol. It isn’t ultra-complex at first, but then as you drink more and more of it subtle flavors come out. The warm alcohol sensation is a bit cloying. A solid imperial stout from a fantastic brewery nonetheless!"
"O: A very interesting beer that really aims high. I still like Bell's Expedition and a handful of other RIS's better, but I plan to grab another bottle and age this as I think it has a lot of aging potential with the high ABV and complex maltiness. Parabola is an excellent brew."
"Overall, an outstanding brew. I can see how this makes a great component of the anniversary beers. Another home run barrel aged beer from Firestone Walker."
"O: This beer lives up to every bit of hype that has been mentioned. The only bourbon barrel beer that I can think of that has better balance is Bourbon County Rare. This one is well worth seeking out."
"O - Amazing Stout. I'll stock up when I see more."
"O: This is my 2nd time having Parabola, and the first time I thought was mindblowing (but it was at a beer festival, so I didn't review it ). Upon further reflection, perhaps I overlooked a few of the flaws in this beer - most notably the odd finish. That said it's still a damn good beer, but I'm glad I sat down with it on its own to properly evaluate it."
"Overall: This beer has beat the hype and still remains a fantastic beer! Taste is similiar to Older Viscosity. Really well done and really enjoyable."
"Overall, this is a pretty spectacular RIS. It reminds me a lot of fresh Kate, just not as smooth. However, the barrel aging makes up for some of that. The flavors and nose are there, it just lacks on some of the finer points. An excellent RIS."
"O/D-Yeah. This lived up to the hype, and then some. I was worried having such a huge beer on a warm night would not be the best idea, but I loved this one. Firestone Walker seems to be one heel of a company. Double Jack and now this one...doing an unbelievable job. I love how its boxed, and for $12.99 in MA; the price is actually pretty damn good. Absolutely a great time in a bottle."
"EDIT: Happened upon a bottle of 2011 this past week. This beer has matured beautifully over the past several months. The barrel presence has mellowed without losing its bourbon bite, but the base beer has taken on an absolutely gorgeous, mellow dark fruit sweetness that complements the chocolate notes very well - it is, in many ways, quite akin to BCBS. This is drinking so well, and I am updating my score accordingly."
"Yum. A bit less sweet than BCBS, but in the same flavor bracket. Super tasty...I want more!!!"
"SUPERB DRINK -- wowed by abacus, floored by parabola."
"- This is a stellar stout, and rises above many in its field. It is damn fine fresh, and is sure to be a real hit aged. I am hoping to find a couple more to cellar as I now only have one left in the cellar. Damn good, and get it while you can."
"Without question, Parabola is in the upper echelon of the style. I highly recommend seeking it out."
"Black with thin light brown head. Lacing is more along the lines of how wine sticks as a film. Smell is somewhat mute with some dark malt and slight hint of booze bourbon. Flavor is more complex, lending some more bourbon than the smell as well as hints of chocolate and fruit. I feel like there is another liquor working here, but having trouble picking it up. A hint of smokiness as well. Slight burn from the alcohol here. Lighter mouthfeel than I prefer, but still acceptable. Overall, another unique interpretation by Firestone Walker here. It’s not your standard barrel aged stout. The complexity of the flavors keeps me guessing some."
"OK, so I had to pick one of these up, even though it's not exactly a ""summer"" beer. It pours very thick into a tulip glass. Dark, thin head. Black color, no light coming through at all. Smell a little chocolate, not much else going on. Ahhhh, but the taste. Roasted malts, chocolate. Absolutely delicious! I rarely comment on the mouthfeel, but I really dig the creamy, heavy taste of this beer. Overall, one of the best stouts out there. Must grab another soon!"
"O: This beer is instant gratification from the moment you pop the cap off. I would jump at the chance to get as much of this as possible. Firestone does magical things with barrel aging, this and their anniversary beers have set the bar very high with that technique. I might open my next bottle once the heat drops out some, this is a slow sipper by all accounts."
"O: This beer is one for my own beer tasting history book. Completely amazing. I only bought one to try, but I will be going back TOMORROW as soon as possible to pick up some more. Worth every freaking penny spent."
"Incredible; I couldn't ask for more from an oaked imperial stout."
"O Just an outstanding beer. This beer is getting a lot of hype and there are haters out there that dismiss it just for that fact, but this beer is all it is cracked up to be and more. I am so glad I scored a case of it."
"O- Quite an experience in a bottle, incredibly complex, flavors come in waves, not jumbled together. This one will only get better with age"
"o- nice beer that could use a little age but not bad by any means. crazy complex flavors"
"I very much enjoyed this beer and am so happy that I was able to try it. Super-limited edition that I was able to get two of. Having my second tomorrow."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. I believe this has cracked my top five Russian Imperial Stout list. Seek this out at all costs!! Really!!! Thanks to aandresen for this bottle."
"Overall I think this is an excellent BBA beer and one of my top three. It helps that it is not insanely overpriced like a certain ops from Brooklyn. The other barrels used impart so much more than just your average Barrel stout and it shows from the complexities, especially the faint cherry. Got one to lay down till wintertime, maybe christmas."
"Fresh: Something was off with this vintage. I get more heat/alcohol, a thin body, moderate tobacco, and very little chocolate/bourbon/etc. After a year: A little better, with substantially less heat, but the roast and ashiness are still prominent (though the flavor overall is fairly muted)."
"I think this will improve with age (alcohol may tone down a bit and the flavors may blend a bit more, while the hop spice recedes a bit), while I found that the Abacus seemed quite at its peak."
"O: Easily the best beer I've ever had. As I mentioned earlier the only flaw, and the only reason it didn't get 5's across, was because for the very slightest moment you thought about the alcohol. I'm sure with a little age that will be gone. Just a world class beer and nothing else."
"If not for the high price ($18) for one beer, I'd buy this more often. As is, it's a definite must-have for special occasions."
"Update: Had on draft 8/1/11. While slightly superior in body and flavor, I can not justify submitting a second review that would barely raise the rating."
"D: This is a heavy hitter. Thought I could take this down by myself, but suspect to find myself beaten."
"o - overall this is a top beer. this is a beer that you talk about. this is a beer that blew my mind. far and away worth the praise it receives."
"O- this is a stellar barrel aged stout. This style is becoming a bit over done but when you get one this good it makes it all worth while. A sipper for sure and very complex but so easy to enjoy. This stuff kicks ass."
"O Oh so well done and down right fantastic"
"This one packs a punch but the flavors are still subtle and balanced. Lots going on here and yet the overall experienced remains really smooth and refined. Very, very nice."
"This is a damn good barrel aged version. Probably my favorite right now. Easily drinkable for such a high ABV at 12.5%."
"Cheers!"
"Overall - Parabolas can open up, down, left, right, or in some other arbitrary direction."
"O - Love it, probably more so than prior years."
"O: great brew! Absolutely world class!"
"O: Having this side by side with Abacus and damn these are two great beers. I said in my Abacus review I liked it better, but now I don't know. Kudos to FW."
"Overall a great beer, velvety smooth, flavors are all balanced, and very easy to drink."
"Batch 002. Pours pitch black with a very light cocoa head. The nose is chocolate, roasted malts, oak and a touch of booze. The taste is sweet vanilla, bourbon and oak, melded together against a dry chocolate and charred roasted malts. Also, just a touch of licorice. Comes together very nicely, but the finish is a bit dry and overly bitter, with a bit much in the way of oak tannins. It brings out an excess in the charred malt / chocolate flavor. This is really my only problem with it. Really fantastic mouthfeel - silky and full on the tongue. The barrel and the medium-low carbonation just round the mouthfeel out to smooth, smooth, smooth. Overall, this is a really good beer, particularly when it warms - the anise flavor blooms a touch more and some of the dryness and bitterness in the finish mellows. I think a few months might really bring this beer around. Once again, FW does some fantastic work with a barrel."
"Beautiful black pour with tan lacing ringing the cup. Complex nose yealds bourbon and wood, sweet toffee, coffee and a little spice. Flavors abound in this beauty as well. Robust sweet bourbon and chocolate are balaced by roast and little char, almost nutty flavors. Bitter coffee and vanilla play around the edges. A very faint vinous character emerges as the beer warms. Smooth and silky on the tounge, Parabola is a boozy sipper that will benifit from some age."
"More balanced and less sweet than other barrel-aged stouts like Goose Island's, but also not as enticing. It lacks that ""wow factor"" that makes my knees weak."
"O: I flat out LOVE THIS BEER. There is honestly not much else to say. I was afraid of it being overly complex and tough to decipher after reading some other reviews, but it was balanced near perfectly. To be honest, the only fault I can find with this beer is that it almost smells better than it tastes. Don't get me wrong, it tastes amazing, but if i had to put a number on both, I would put Smell at 98 and Taste at 96. I can't wait to open my next bottle, which I'm sure will be sooner than I had anticipated before tasting this one."
"This is better than my review would lead me to believe. However, all the components are in place for this to be a monster of a brew, devastatingly complex and delicious, with some time. Give it time."
"Overall Impression- Intense! This guy has some serious complexity and one of my favorite beers of the month! I bought 2 bottles of this from Lukas Liquor and am going to see how they age. Could/Would only want to enjoy one of these because of how strong it is. Had a nice buzz going after this beer. Will be promoting this beer!"
"D- incredibly drinkable for the intensity of the beer. Smooth and Lucious."
"Cheers..."
"Overall this is a fantastic beer. Very much lived up to the hype for me."
"O: Excellent, there is a lot going on here and you can really pull out the individual flavors that come from the variety of barrels used. Drinks very easily for ~13%."
"Overall/notes - I didn't think it possible, but Firestone Walker topped Abacus on this one. It's like perfection bottled. I never thought I'd live to see the day I tasted what I feel is a perfect brew. This will forever be on my watch list. I just need to get some dark chocolate along for the ride next time I can find it. Seek this out and savor it. A true sipper."
"I could mention a bbal-aged stout that I like better than this, but it really is a great beer."
"O) Lives upto the hype!"
"Overall a nice beer that deserves good revues and stands out from the pack of most beers in this style. Excellent."
"O: A really excellent RIS that blends its smokey and bitter notes better than perhaps any other RIS I've had. Some aging to tone down the hotness could perhaps make this my favorite RIS. Definitely a must if you have any love for RIS."
"O: Worth the excitement, this beer has some real cascading flavors. I highly recommend sitting with this beer a bit colder, and letting it go its full flavor spectrum even beyond recommended serving temp. It remains a dessert beer throughout, featuring truly deep chocolates with a fancy alcohol pairing. Many in the style come off savory, even starting out in the realm of salty meats; but I would emphatically say that this beer came off as dessert even when a bit cold. The rolling flavors fought for my attention, and I tried to quell their excitement so that they all could be heard, ""One at a time, not all at once!"". This is a deep brew. It's like the first time you watch Mulholland Drive: You don't know what just happened, but you know that it was good. Would drink again, tomorrow or years later. Hold on to a few for yearly celebrations."
"This is a great limited release stout. Even though it's aged in bourbon barrels it's very forward on the nose but very subtle on the palate. With some age on this the bourbon will probably be gone and the chocolate will be more pronounced but I will have to find that out myself."
"O The highlight of the night. Delicious in every way. Balanced, delicious, and paired well. 4.5"
"Overall stupidly addictive, but not my favorite I think. Still quite an exceptional product I must say. I wish the nose was more varied."
"Overall, I'd say this beer lives up to the hype.  It's probably the most complex stout I've had, the only thing it lacks is superior smoothness and drinkability... Something a little age will surely cure."
"D - really solid BA RIS. I feel like the heat was a little overpowering at first but as this warmed up it turned into a really nice beer. I feel like a year or two would do wonders with this beer. Luckily I have a couple of bottles to lay down and anxiously await to crack in the future."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and thick. It is full bodied with medium carbonation. Overall it was a fantastic stout which I'm glad I finally got around to cracking."
"I've bought 7 bottles of this both years. I think its the right number to keep doing every year. Not too many beers in that elite company (PTE, Bigfoot, Parabola, Celebration, Eclipse)"
"O: Disappointing. I'd heard lots of amazing things about this one and it kinda let me down. That's a shame, because I totally dig Firestone Walker overall."
"Time has been kind to ye old Parabola. 13% my foot!"
"O: a great beer. I would never pass this beer up."
"O - A complex RIS, very nice and warming."
"Overall drinkability is very good. This is definitely a world class brew. Viscosity is not quite what i had hoped but very good nonetheless. Definitely one to pursue for impy stout lovers!"
"Overall this is an outstanding Imperial Stout, there is a nice bourbon flavor, not the alcohol taste you get with the majority of bourbon barrel stouts. Great job."
"Overall I am really looking this brew. Much better than I remember it from last year, though I didn't have it very often last year."
"Poured into a snifter. Pours a dark black with a couple fingers of light brown head. Smell is strongly vanilla, delicious bourbon vanilla. Mouthfeel is warm, the booziness coming through. Tastes magnificent, I love the vanilla, also roasty flavors coming through strongly. The main detractor (for me, at least) is the booziness, at 13% I'd expect it to be coming through somewhat less, actually. But I'm cellaring a few bottles, and I anticipate that age will mellow this and make it even better."
"Pours a rich black with dark brown head. Nose is rich with vanilla woody components, toffee, & creme de brûlée. Palate offers a rich combo of roasty flavors, vanilla wood bourbon elements again, and finishes delightfully boozy. Full bodied. Simply a hedonic delight."
"O- outstanding overall but would love for the price to be more along the lines of stone brews. That being said I bought several and will enjoy every sip."
"Staring into the depths of the sea at night. This beer smells like bourbon, chocolate, and coffee with the latter two struggling to persevere over the bourbon. The taste follows the nose with alcohol being prevalent but not overbearing; aftertaste of hops, dark chocolatiness, and bourbon. Light carbonation, nice creamy mouthfeel, and some heat from the 13% abv. Overall an awesome impy stout that sneaks up on you and won't let you go."
"Tastes are smoke, a humidor, cigars, dark chocolate, hops, wood fire, British crystal, bourbon, oak, oats, dark fruits, (alotta) booze, fastly-warming heat, a little milk sugar/lactose, menthol, vanilla beans -- strong, caramel-covered apples, tea leaves and silk."
"O- Firestone has a very respectable stout here. i'm glad i bought a few bottles of this to age"
"This is my second time having it on tap and I look forward to having it again if there is any left tomorrow. Be sure to let it warm up before imbibing."
"Great beer."
"Overall: This beer is good now but will be great with at least 1yr of aging most likely 2 just to dumb down the alcohol punch that it gives you and lets the true flavors really come through. So buy several like I did and forget about them"
"Had this numerous time, both batch 1 and batch 2. This is my first review though I've been scouring this site for some time and going out of my way to collect bottles. On the the beer...from a batch 1 bottle. Pours black in the glass with a small brown head. Aroma was molasses, roasted grains, chocolate, hot bourbon. Really pronounced flavors, a lot of that molasses I got with dark chocolate, maybe some raisins. As a BA stout it's all right, not my favorite. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy. Kind of messy and really sweet overall. I guess this would fall into the ""over rated"" camp in my book."
"The mouthfeel was pretty much perfection. Smooth and thick like velvet. It was pretty much like drinking off of cask. Drinkability was great for such a big beer, but next time I'll probably spli the bottle with someone. This was outstanding and I'm glad I got a few more to put down."
"Really a top notch -bal aged stout. Exceedingly good and smooth."
"O - Another outstanding -bal from FW. Tasty, rich and quite enjoyable. Too bad it's in such limited quantities."
"With Parabola now in bottles (and $15 for a 22 at the taproom), I am very happy that an amazing Imperial Stout will be accessible now. Way to go again Firestone!"
"O-A really nice BA stout. In my eyes, it doesn't tackle Silva, but is up there with a lot of other great examples of the style. I did a lot of leg work to track down bottles of this in the greater San Diego area. Firestone seems to spread our limited release allotment pretty thin, but I was glad to pick up several of these. I think a year or so would do interesting things to this, but its going to be hard not to crack into more."
"Full bodied, rich and creamy. Smooth small bubble carbonation further contributes to it. No alcohol detected for this year old keg."
"2010 batch shared at the May Santa Cruz tasting. Pours darkest brown, nearly black, with a coffee colored head. Aromas of sugary coffee, dark chocolate, graham crackers, and roasted malt. Flavor is punishingly strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate, immense roastiness, eternal black coffee bitterness, smoldering oak. Just an obliterating beer."
"The flavors weren't any bolder or more well-defined. The body was decent although much thinner than typical, which did help with drinkability. Overall, a good but not great beer. A relative disappointment from FW, a brewery I think very highly of."
"PP (Price Point) -- I paid a $5 premium on the bottle, it should have been around $15 but I paid $20 and snagged 3 bottles. I will probably get a few more for trading but as I said didn't really live up to the hype to me, though it was an excellent beer, only slightly above average for the style."
"O - What we have here was a highly anticipated beer that exceeded my expectations. When served cold, not so awesome. When given a chance to warm up, watch out now. Can i take a Bomber to the face? Sure, but this is one that you wanna share and enjoy with others. I've already searched all over Hawaii and nothing to be found. Once I get back to Cali, the hunt is on."
"M + D: The one negative element I found in this beer was in the body. Considering the look, scent, and flavour, I would have expected something richer and thicker--and I would have preferred it for being such, even if it was following others of the same style. It seemed a little thin, and I found that it slipped down my throat quite quickly, leaving some alcohol burn that is slightly disappointing. Fortunately, the other elements of the beer make up for it. As for drinkability, it's got a pretty high ABV. It's an evening sipper or 'end-of-the-day' type brew--best slow and steady to finish the day up."
"Overall: I'm going to need to get a lot of these. This rivals KBS in my book -- they're different versions of one of my favorite styles. I'm going to have to go head to head one of these nights. Quite a commitment to drink a 22 of 13% imperial stout, but on special occasions, this will deliver quite a treat."
"Overall - I just can't say enough about the complexity of this beer. It's like the *perfect* amount of everything mixed in. I'm not a fan of drinking a stout that tastes like someone slipped a shot of Bourbon in it. If I wanted that much Bourbon flavor, I'd just drink Bourbon. But this beer finds a wonderful middle ground between Bourbon and the other barrels used and it really just compliments what I can imagine the base beer being. Absolutely wonderful beer and I can't wait for the other half I have warming up from fridge temp!"
"O- Amazing beer, gets better ever ytime i have it, which says a lot. Wish i could drink this on the reg, but what would i dream about?"
"O - This is a very well crafted imperial stout. It's everything a stout should be, thick, complex, robust. It's all here. I can't wait to see what some aging will do to this..."
"I think I'll ration out the case over a year and see how it evolves."
"O: Outstanding big beer. FW continues to impress with their Parabola. This beer is very complex and hides the alcohol nicely! Just the right amount of bourbon comes through. Don't pass up the opportunity to try some if you have the chance!"
"I am going back and forth on this beer. Just for the record - I am not a big fan of bourbon barrel aged stouts. I generally find them too bourbon forward and not balanced enough. This is by far the most balanced bourbon barrel aged stout I've had. However, overall, this is still not a beer I would seek out or trade my first born for. It's a very good beer...and I'm curious to see how it will drink with a year on it. It is still too hot to me right now. It leaves a slightly unpleasant boozy aftertaste that I'm not fond of. Luckily, I have another one, so I think I will sit on that for a while. When it comes to imperial stouts, the Abyss has my heart, and so far nothing has come very close. This is no exception."
"O: One of my favorite imperial stouts. You can really taste the additional complexities from the bourbon barrel aging without having the bourbon overpower everything else thats going on. Another world class beer from Firestone Walker."
"O - This is phenomenal. Could drink this any day. Deserves to be one of the best. The finish is hard to match."
"O: This is one well worth seeking out, although I suspect many will be disappointed with its availability, especially us in CA. I didn't give it a 5 because this will only get better with age. However, it is outstanding right now."
"An amazing beer that should really age well."
"Smooth and silky with the alcoholic zip. Low carbonation."
"Overall: This is the best imperial stout I have ever had, Thanks FSW for making this crazy ass huge beer that is crazy good."
"O: An amazing amazing brew. I liked this with a year on it better than I did fresh on tap."
"Overall: I absolutely think FW has it going on here. An incredibly crafted stout that is underrated as far as I'm concerned. It's better (IMO) than The Abyss, Dark Lord, Speedway, MZ, etc. Absolutely amazing."
"This is my second review. Met David Walker as he handed me a snifter of Parabola and 12th Anniversary each during Seattle Beer Week. Chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee, toffee, and bourbon flavors. This is the second year bottling. Exceptional RIS. My favorite."
"Overall. Awesome stuff. The only complaint would be a little heat, but a few years should help that."
"Poured in my Westvleteren tasting glass this beer looked very nice, the oily lacing sticks to the glass. Head is low. Far away in the taste you can get some hops. Vanilla is also to find in this chocolat dark beer."
"Drinks big and bold. Complex and tasty as fuck. While booze is apparent, maybe doesnt feel quite like 13%. One of the best barrel aged stouts I've ever tried."
"O - An excellent BA stout. It's truthfully hard to find something wrong with this beer, besides the looks. Some of those who had this fresh said it's really settled down over the year (or so) it's been aging. Recommend, the 2010 vintage is drinking wonderfully now."
"O-Great stuff."
"Amazingly hidden ABV and a very rich flavor make this one drink dangerously. A really nice blend of flavors come in this bottle, anyone who likes big stouts needs to try this."
"Comparing it to other bourbon stouts, it doesn't have the complexity of The Abyss, but this is WAY less harsh and more balanced than 1-year old Bourbon County Stout. Great beer, hope to get another bomber."
"O - This is a rock-solid brew. Firestone Walker has impressed me with their steadfast grip on the fundamentals."
"D - Drinkability is high. This is an excellent barrel-aged beer and certainly a great introduction to Firestone Walker. I'm a sucker for the chocolate fudge taste and smooth bourbon in stouts so this is definitely a favorite for me. I will definitely be seeking out further releases and try to cellar some!"
"O: Goes down alright, somewhat tasty, somewhat filling, decent kick, ok representation of style. I was really looking forward to this beer, and although it's not undrinkable, I would opt for others of the style. Perhaps aging a bit would enhance this beer."
"SkÅL!"
"d - this is a very flavorful stout from FW. the use of blended barrels is very noticeable with the smell and taste of this beer. easy to drink especially knowing that it is 13% avb."
"Pours a very dark brown with a gorgeous red tint around the edges. A it of lit brown head. Very pretty. Smells cry bourbon heavy. Maybe a bit astringent on the nose. Tstes dry and sweet. There is a wonderful bitterwsweet chocolate malt as well as some solid vanilla as it warms. Maybe a touch of coconut as well. Very sweet but dry. Overall, a solid barrel aged brew"
"O-very good beer. Glad I have one to try with some age on it"
"(O)- It's strong and rich, but I could easily throw this whole bomber back myself."
"D: For a 13% ABV beer, you can barely taste the heat at all here. Deliciously full flavored with a feel that's unmatched. Do what it takes to seek this one out. It's worth it."
"O: Overall, an excellent beer. Not quite in my top 5 stouts, but probablyly in the top 10. The beer is balanced, tastes great, and has great drinkability for 13%."
"Overall this beer was great and incredibly drinkable. The ABV is noticeable, but the taste is so rich that I can't keep the glass down. Well done."
"Thanks to alfrantzell for the beer. And to think all he made me do was tongue kiss him for a bottle."
"I received this from steve8robin in ba secret santa. I poured from a bomber into a snifter, the pour is jet black, thin tan head. The aroma has big notes of coffee, chocolate, oak. There are hints of vanill and some bourbon. The taste follows the nose, and all of the flavors are very well balanced. The alcohol is not real hot. It has a lingering warm finish. A full bodied beer, very creamy mouth feel. This is a homerun for BA stouts."
"Although there is a nice bourbon flavor, the robust, roasted malt flavors are very prominent. Lots of luscious dark chocolate, oatmeal and burnt toast as well as a very strong roasted coffee bean presence. The coffee/espresso flavor is deep and roasty but is not stale, burnt or acrid tastng at all and doesn't overpower the other flavors. Again, I'm picking up a good amount of smokiness/tobacco flavor that I'm really loving. All of these flavors are bouncing off of one another resulting in an incredibly complex, delicious beer. Each sip brings something new and although there is some nice heat and burn in the finish, the ABV at 13% is very well masked. Very quaffable and tackling the whole bomber was no problem for me. Maybe that says more about me than the beer but that's a discussion for another time."
"Overall: Wow, I've been impressed with every Firestone Walker beer I've had so far, but this one blew the rest out of the water. Glad I have more of it."
"Overall: Well balanced and well done, although the high ABV makes it a bit hot and thin, keeping the score from breaking 4.5. I greatly prefer it to any of the anniversary blends."
"One of the best BA Imperial Stouts around. Highly recommended."
"12/17/2010"
"D and overall impression: Couldn't have very much of this one, my 6 oz. pour was enough. Overall, I thought it was good, not great. The booziness was just a little too much for my taste. Maybe a little more age would mellow the flavors a bit. Skal."
"D - The ABV is high and a bit present. Especially as it warms but it is a delicious stout and quite a treat. I wouldn't mind having another one."
"All the same, it produced some fun quotes from notes: ""will update on comp. I love parabola. Note: male a joke about having this in San Fran wheee the gills are like parabolas"""
"D - Very good. I have wanted to try this one for awhile now and now that I have I am impressed. I just wish I would have picked up a few bottles for myself."
"Drink- Overall, a really great stout. Would suggest to someone to trade/find someone who has one."
"Bases are loaded on this one and Firestone put one over the fence with this beer. One of my favorite Imperial stouts. 13 percent beers are usually designed to be sippers. I couldn't get enough of this one."
"MF/D: definitely could've drunk the bottle by myself if it were my own (and it wasn't 13%). went down fairly smooth, though some lingering IBU's tickled my tongue. could feel the ABV at the end of my 8oz pour."
"2010 vintage in a Duvel tulip."
"D: Extremeley easy to drink. The alcohol levels don't scream at you whatsoever. Pretty amazing for such a big brew."
"Overall, this beer was a great way to end a flight of all these great Firestone Walker beers. Can't say there is a bad one in the bunch. It basically boils down to flavor preference, and freshness to age preference, but these beers are deserving of their recognition, as they are well crafted, complex, and balanced. Glad I still have 3 bottles of Parabola, and I am looking forward to what age does for this beer."
"Up for review is a 650ml bottle of Parbola from Firestone Walker. Poured at cellar temp into a snifter. Bottle was around $15 to $18? Pours near black, thin heady. Lots of whiskey barrel, chocolate, dark roasty malts, molasses, coffee, dark fruits and hops. Body is full, but a bit under carbonated, poor finish. But a great barrel aged stout."
"D - Honestly, the abv is a bit high to drink multiples and the sweetness might linger after a couple of these."
"Man o man , a very very nice beer !!!"
"Overall, this is a good beer. The ABV and mouthfeel combine to make it slightly less drinkable but incredibly good."
"Drinkability: I really like this one. It is quite well balanced and I intend to drink it again some day."
"Drinkability - The 13% alc is present so this is a slow sipper. If this was as available as regular GI BCBS, I could see myself drinking this a lot."
"A solid imperial stout from a fantastic brewery."
"overall another superb offering from Firestone and big thanks to James for sending it my way...ill have another down the road hopefully"
"This is a medium bodied brew that is lightly carbonated and very smooth drinking. Tons of flavors to enjoy and quite a deep brew. Roasty and bitter with lots of nuances to pick up on. This is a solid example of barrel aging and something I would love to have as a staple in the cellar."
"D: For a 13% ABV beer, you can barely taste the heat at all here. Black Tuesday has a lot to learn from this barrel-aged masterpiece. Deliciously full flavored with a feel that's unmatched. Do what it takes to seek this one out. It's worth it."
"Overall, this is either number one or two for me in terms of barrel aged stouts (with Bourbon County regular) that I've had. The balance is absoutely unbelievable and the parts are perfectly integrated. Definitely something I recommend anything to try."
"It smells and tastes great, but the mouthfeel may be the highlight. So velvety smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a big, complex sipper of a beer, but wow is it good and it goes down way to easy. Looking forward to tracking down more of this."
"YUMMM"
"This is a big boy, and a total sipper, but you could drink the whole thing. Sharing is good though!"
"Mouthfeel is full and decadent. Man. This is a fantastic beer and I am frankly surprised how fantastic it is. I thought the pinacle of Imperial Stouts was reached with Darklord but this takes the style to a whole other level AND I found it at a liquor store across my hotel in Santa Barbara and didn't have to get a golden ticket or nothing. Game changer. Get it if you find it."
"Nice black pour, thin almost absent brown head. Aroma is a nice mix of bourbon and chocolate in equal parts, boozy and wood. Taste is quite enjoyable, quite chocolaty with with a nice red fruit signature and a warm boozy bourbon finish . Palate is thick and sticky, with just little carbonation and some alcohol warmth. A very nice bourbon barrel aged IS."
"Good stuff."
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Been saving it for almost a year so it has some nice age on it. Pitch black pour with beautiful chocolate-colored two finger head that fades quickly with minimal lacing. The bourbon and oak are huge right from the first whiff. Hints of vanilla, tobacco, espresso and dark chocolate make every sip a pleasure to the nose. This is one big beer! The taste is huge and complex. As in the nose, the bourbon and oak are the stars. The balance is perfect with just enought bitter hops to offset the sweet malts. Dark chocolate, vanilla, roasty coffee, oak and lots of bourbon only get better as this warms. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth as silk. And although this is a huge sipper of a beer, it was extremely drinkable. I had read complaints about the size of the bottle being too big for one person, but I was totally enjoying every drop and never felt overwhelmed. The alcohol is warming but not overpowering. This is one of those rare beers and I can't thank the staff at Tops Liquors enough for hooking me up with this classic!"
"Full bodied, smooth and creamy with just a little bite of carbonation in the middle, otherwise, pretty still, coating. Just a bit of booze heat and bitterness that lingers for a while..."
"Thanks Mikesgroove for indulging me. Pours thick black with nearly black head. This is a bourbon story. Bourbon hits you in the nose and is strong, with alcohol apparent, in the taste. I am Ok with bourbon in moderation, we are not a corn distilled fan nation, but it was too much. Cocoa powder and coconut was also experienced and not integrated. This is above average body, it was finishable, I owed it to the brewers. Not as great as many other RIS I have consumed of late, it is an example of what is turned out as a big beer."
"D: A really enjoyable barrel aged stout. Really well done and easy to drink. Glad that Firestone Walker bottled this one. Can't wait to get it again."
"Very good beer. I was not impressed as much as I had hoped, though I do attribute this to my rather high expectations. Very drinkable, the booze is not a factor which is an accomplishment with such a big beer. I am glad I have another bottle."
"Drinkability: This isn't a ""mature"" brew - that is, it's not well-aged, mellowed, subtle, or moderate. Instead, it's young, intense, bold, and extreme ... it's just youthfully, intensely, boldly, and extremely balanced. And if this brew were as bold in the aroma as it is in the mouth, you'd have yourself an easy world class brew here. As it stands, it's excellent, and the 13% doesn't manifest itself anywhere other than the bourbon warmth and spice (where it's desired) and, well, the manner in which I'm beginning to type and collect thoughts. So I'll wrap this up by saying: 1) this beer should be released again; 2) this beer should be a component of everyone FW Anniversary beer unless and until FW puts out a better one (aside: when are we getting Abacus? Bueller? Bueller?); and 3) if you haven't tried this beer and can get ahold of it, do so. You won't be disappointed."
"Drank the boomer with ZERO problem. I wish I would have picked up a couple extra bottles at the price point. Unfortunately, I am left with only one more bottle. Worthy of all the praise."
"D: I drank my 5-6 ounce snifter far too fast and my review suffered as a result. This was my first time having this beer even though I have 2 bottles of my own safely stashed away. I'm going to have to revise this in the future when I have a little more time to really think about this beer. For the moment I'm very glad I have more and look forward to drinking them! 4/5"
"OVERALL: A top notch BA imperial stout. The barrel was very present, but still didn't dominate and overpower the base beer. It certainly played a leading role, but it played the role very well. Very drinkable and very enjoyable. I constantly had Goose Islands BCBS in my mind while drinking it, and I can safely say I enjoyed this one more. It would be great to line them up head-to-head at some point. Would love to drink this again. Thanks again for the trades gents."
"Pours a jet black hue with a fizzy bronze head that fades away to a finger's worth of head and lacing. I smell vanilla and dark fruits blended in harmony, some drier, perhaps malt notes of the roasted persuasion. The first sip has a burst of warmth from the alcohol and finished with and oily aftertaste. There's a distinct whiskey flavor, too. The malt is trying to push its way through the bigger flavors and seems to work, just enough to be noticed. There;s some dark fruit flavors that give way to the roasted malt flavors. There's some vanilla sneaking around as well. Very cream mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to keep things moving. I'm trying to decide whether or not this alcohol flavor is something from the barrel or the fact that it's 13%. Knowing the barrel aged beers that I've had from the brewery in the past I'm going to guess it's from the barrel. This is a diverse beer. Definitely a good one to spend time with. I'm not sure if aging this will do any good. It's very smooth for a beer this size. I'd give this beer some time and see how the malt character changes. Perhaps without the barrel aging this might taste a little better."
"I think this beer is likely better fresh. This one was about 10 months old."
"Too bad the alcohol is up and the bottles are big, i'd get this again"
"d - Truly an amazing barrel aged beer; this is one of my favorite RIS's. The smell and taste are both very balanced and complex, and the mouthfeel is perfect. I felt like I could drink a lot of this, even with the 13% ABV. Can't wait to have this one again."
"poured a very dark brown with maroonish brown highlights that had a very thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. Upfront I detected cocoa, vanilla, chocolate, slight roastiness and bourbon for sure is coming through. it definitely has booze but faint dark fruit notes. The bourbon and the chocolate flavors mesh beautiful alongside oat grains, a little coffee roasty character, vanilla from the barrel and seems to have cocoa nib accents. I gotta say its pretty hot and probably could do well with time. The brew was full in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, boozy, silky, and chewy finish; pretty damn thick. It drank pretty good considering the ABV and was very delicious. I'm glad I have one for the cellar to compare."
"Final Thoughts - I can't wait to try this beer again with more age on it. I'm having a hard time thinking it could still get better. I liked this better than the 2009 BCS, KBS, Older Viscosity, Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti, and Old Rasputin XII I've had thus far this year. Good thing I have 3 more in the cellar (Closet)"
"Perhaps a return to high class basics - with a strict Van Winkle aging program - would resurrect the great FW barrel aged brews I know and love? Should Mr. Brynildson wish to put this query to the test, I would be honored to place my distillery's resources at his disposal. Would that Parabola return to her glory."
"one of the best beers i've had as of late. lives up to hype."
"This was a big surprise. I heard that it was very good but I thought it would be heavy and bitter like a lot of stouts but was pleasantly surprised. One of the top, best tasting imperial stouts I have ever had, and probably ever will have."
"I had this beer on numerous occasions, both from bottle and draught, there were no major differences."
"Having had FW13 a few months prior to this I can definitely tell this was a main component of that blend and after looking it up I confirmed that it was the highest percentage beer in that blend. Great stuff and I have another to age a few years. This seems to have great aging potential like GIBCS."
"This is absolutely worth its hype, a very good bourbon stout, I would be very happy to have it again."
"D: Surprisingly easier drinking than I thought it would be. I could easily enjoy a bottle on my own. This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. Nice job Firestone!"
"D - So good, this is one of the best beers out there for the style I'd wager. Fantastic flavor and mouthfeel. Still highly drinkable despite the slightly noticeable, but well-balanced alcohol. Delish! Thanks Todd!"
"(D)- Simply a fantastic Imperial Stout. A superb balance that makes this really shine for the style. Still not for the faint of heart since it is rather strong in all senses, but it just fits. Just an excellent beer."
"D: Overall a great Double Stout. Super drinkable. FSW hit this one out of the park."
"For a barrel-aged 13% imperial stout, it really doesn't get much more drinkable, or accessible, than this. Obviously one to take slow and savor, for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it's just too good to drive down quickly. What a start to the weekend..."
"Reviewed from notes, shared generously at a Chicago tasting. Pours black with a tiny tan head that fades leaving little trace. Smell is mostly oak and light hops, sweet dark malts and vanilla. A slight metallic smell as well. Taste is bourbon and carmel up front, heavily roasted malts and a bit of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is lighter then i would have expected, medium to heavy with a light carbonation. Overall drinkability for the style is pretty good, but this one could use a little time."
"Thanks Auroracrisis!"
"This is how you do a bourbon barrel aged beer. Excellent."
"D: Big and bold, a mouthful of a stout. Only problem is that is like every other imperial stout, dark and warming with plenty of roasted flavors."
"D: An awesome beer that I highly recommend. One of the best barrel-aged imperial stouts I have ever had."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with carbonation being low. Drinkability is great for such a high alcohol beer. The flavors all came together excellently. The barrel aging really enhanced it and gave it some fantastic depth instead of overpowering it. World class beer overall and one of the top of the style for sure."
"Bottled opened and poured into a large snifter. A black hole of a beer. The pour is dark, thick; a vicious appearing beer unrelenting and uncompromising in its attempt to keep out the light. A small, one inch head arises, initially light in color but darkens into a nice mocha/caramel color as is subsides into a thin ring clinging desperately to the side of the glass. On the nose I am picking up on strong fig, lots of bourbon, vanilla and a nice oakiness that gives way to booze and more booze. Taste is right along the lines of the nose, in addition to a really pleasant presence of thick caramel; chocolate covered toffee, cane sugar and toasted grains. The mouth feel is medium to heavy, at times almost seeming to be too much at once. The moderate amount of carbonation helps the drinkability. A good beer overall. This is a beer that demands your time and attention; sip it slowly and reap the benefits."
"D: A slow sipper for sure and best shared, but overall a great beer that i wouldnt mind getting more of"
"Pours black with a mocha head that fades to a ring. Nose is roasted malt of the burned varietal. Typical FW anise, almost mint-like barrel notes shine in. That was part of what I loved so much about the FW13. Bitter baker's chocolate. Mouth is almost numbing, very heavy, that burned malt playing with dark fruits like dates, raisins, still that nice herbal quality. Boozy and fairly hot. Heavy and unfocused to my taste. Has good qualities but this is a bit much on its own. I much prefer it in the anniversary blends."
"Didn't think I would enjoy this one as much as I did, a top notch example of the style. Something I'd like to try again, hopefully from a larger sample."
"Good stuff!"
"All in all, bravo Firestone Walker! This is my idea of a fantastic stout. Definitely worth hunting if you like deep, thick, creamy, dark stouts to try and grab some to age. One of my new faves for sure!!"
"4.5 across the board."
"Pours a pitch black color with a brown highlights and a tan 1 finger head. Poured into my Surly Darkness glass. Have heard how good this beer is and really am trying to not be dissappointed if it doesn't reach the level of goodness I have heard so much about. Coffee, bourbon, and cream type notes in the aroma. This is a very complex beer with lots of aromas and tastes. I taste dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and some hop bitterness. I would say this is a very balanced and complete Imperial Stout well worth the praises I have heard. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Very rich and good. It doesn't really get much better than this."
"Overall, I am very grateful to coryking for a trade I thought I could not have completed with the beers available in my area. Parabola is a stout worthy of its place amongst the best."
"Nevertheless, this beer is awesome. Highly recommended, if you can find it."
"D: Alcohol hits a little hard in the chest on the way down, or else I would have given a 5."
"nky black pour with a small, off-white head. Intense black coffee aroma, with lots of dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, and smoky, heavily charred oak. Heavy, bitter black coffee falvor with dark chocolate, lots of charred oak, and lots of dark fruit. Chalky assertive hops on the finish. Creamy, full body with soft carbonation."
"Dark brown liquid is capped with a slight skim of tiny brown bubbles. Cocoa and bourbon make up the very appealing aroma. The beer tastes chocolately, with a strong bourbon finish. Although the flavors are there, the alcohol is well-hidden. There isn't burning or a warmth to the swallow. Medium body and low carbonation. Lots of coating. The flavors stay with you a while, so you don't feel the need to grab another sip as soon as you put the glass down. A note on the bottle recommends you share, and I agree, but I would want a large pour. This is a good beer!"
"FIRESTONE WALKER PARABOLA!!! I feel bad now. What did I do to deserve this? This beer was on my most wanted list in my profile. I was thinking about trading off my Jackie O's bottles for one. HUGE thanks to Jeff."
"J"
"Highly recommended. Thanks to whitebricke and wavers1 for the bottles!"
"Overall, a very nice imp stout. Good -bal aging notes. Good flavors and the drinkability is nice on this one. Solid stuff."
"O: Very well brewed and enjoyed very much (Thanks EvilTwinCP). The only thing I would have liked more is a little more carbonation. Although I see a growing trend among the Imperial Stout beers to not have carbonation. This is what I like to call another good example of a fine gentleman's sipping beer. Would pair great with a cigar."
"I might have hyped this one up a bit in my head, thinking it could best KBS/BCS and some of my other favorites. I'll age a couple bottles, and see what I think down the road."
"Bottle. Pours a pitch black color with a brown highlights and a tan 1 finger head. Poured into my Surly Darkness glass. Have heard how good this beer is and really am trying to not be dissappointed if it doesn't reach the level of goodness I have heard so much about. Coffee, bourbon, and cream type notes in the aroma. This is a very complex beer with lots of aromas and tastes. I taste dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and some hop bitterness. I would say this is a very balanced and complete Imperial Stout well worth the praises I have heard. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Very rich and good. It doesn't really get much better than this."
"m/d-Very full syrupy flavor that clings to the mouth and leaves you feeling like you need a drink of water. It goes down smooth for something this strong, but is certainly a slow drinker."
"Pours midnight black with a dark brown head. The aroma is molasses sweet with a hefty hint of booziness. The taste is fantastic with the booziness providing a sightly harsh overtone to the coffee and sweet malty taste. The mouthfeel is noticably thick, which makes sense given the borderline ridiculous alcohol content. All in all its a fantastic beer in the vein of dark lord or the other tremendous big body american stouts."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is very thick and harsh, it coats the tongue and cheeks and leaves a bit of burn. This is as drinkable as most extreme imperial stouts (Dark Lord, DORIS the Destroyer, etc) but could be an amazing beer with some time."
"This is a good sipping beer. The 13% surprised me."
"Edit: This gets much better as it warms up. Drinkability score adjusted."
"Pours pitch black with minimal tan bead. Smells are little chocolate, booze, powered cocoa. Tastes are coffe, booze and a slight chocolate finish. There's some others in there as well, possibly some dark fruits and maybe hints of tobacco. Drinkability, as with other beers in this style are extremely subjective, and I know my group could have had one more bottle."
"Pours 'Midnight Black' with better than a full finger loose frothy dark brown head. The collar fades quickly with spotty patterns of lacing in its wake. The aroma is moderately intense; boozy bourbon, nicely roasted malt, choco-molasses and fig. The mouth feel is very nice. Creamy smooth, lightly carbonated. Slightly less coating character than my favorite examples of this style..the mouth feel is medium bodied. A wonderful after experience ...lingers nicely. One heck of a drinker!! The 13% ABV is out in the open; no apologies. Highly recommended. I got this one from Geoui. Cheers JJ"
"Flavor-wise, this one is very tasty and nicely drinkable. That 13.00%abv though, does manage to make itself known, mostly in a touch of warmth, on the back-end. Overall, it is nicely drinkable, though."
"For such a huge beer, this is incredibly nuanced and subtle. I can't get enough of this. All around excellent, and highly recommend."
"D - Again, a fantastic tasting brew. I wish I could get my hands on some more."
"Overall - This beer far surpassed my expectations. Amazingly well done with perhaps just a little too much of a bite (so age it to perfection!). Delicious but from memory I must say I don't think it tops the Abyss. But hey you two, that I know will eventually read this - lets try it out. Simultaneous tasting - Abyss vs Parabola August 2010 !!!"
"Parabola is a delicious treat that surpassed my extremely high expectations. Pour is black as can be. Smell is a chocolate toffee combo with a slight alchohol hint. Taste is amazingingly decadent, thick and satisfying. I am shocked that this beer lives up to all the hype. I went in skeptical of all the hype, but was very surpised at my result. Can not recommend this any higher, it is near the top of the stout list."
"Overall this was simply a phenomenal beer. Nothing was out of place and everything worked exceptionally well together. Well worth a shot."
"Palate is hit instantly with a sharp, carbonated, and semi-boozy bourbon note that suggests dark bread, vanilla, and cocoa. Mid-sip is when the magic of Parabola takes effect, laying down layer upon layer of decadent Baker's chocolate, oak tannins, fig & plum fruitiness, and earthen hops. The alcohol provides warmth to the palate, but never becomes too hot or solvent-like. Mouthfeel is a velvety, viscous treat. Perfect carbonation and consistency that never gets heavy or taxing to the tongue. All in all, a flat-out fantastic brew. Glad I chose this one as review Numero 1K, it was well worth it. For me, Parabola is easily in the top tier of Imperial Stouts, and, for that matter, any beer in general."
"Consumed: 7/21/2010"
"The appearance had a good, deep color. But the was not much of a crown of glory and left little lacing. The smell and taste paralleled near perfection with bold aromas/flavors of cocoa nibbs, oak, bourbon, coffee or espresso, and some alcohol. Really, this is a great stout by what matters to me the most: taste and smell. The feel was good. It wasn't frothy, but oily. Some may prefer the oily feel in a stout. An oily feel is just not my preference, but it was still good. I opened this one for mine and my girlfriends anniversary and I could not finish it. I was too full. It is a heavy beer and would be best split over a meal or partially consumed before the meal. I was really disappointed to waste about 1 3rd of such a landmark beer."
"Poured into tulip. Not much head forms, lacing is very thin to none. The body is pitch black. Smell is mostly chocolate and a hint of sweetness; enjoyable but not the most complex. The taste is slightly sweet, but nowhere near cloying. Vanilla and maple flavors dominate. This goes down smooth; the alcohol is very hidden. Mouthfeel is decent and this is relatively drinkable for the style. It's not too thick but still has the viscosity RIS should have. Love it."
"Time for another barrel aged beer. Thanks Andy for letting me drink all your beers lately. Poured this into a White Birch goblet. Big black body on this with a nice tan head. Good sticky lacing all around. I initially smell the barrel aging with dark fruits. Roasted malts and rich chocolate linger in the background. The barrel aging smells really good on this. Not overpowering, but the presence is known. The taste is really nice. Maple and bitter cocoa really dominate the pallet. This finish very nicely and lingers on the tounge. Rich and heavy and I'm digging it. The silky mouthfeel is partnered wonderfully with subtle carbonation. Great drinkability for a 13% barrel aged beer. The alcohol is hidden very well."
"Outstanding beer. Tons of different flavors. But not overdone and a pleasure to drink. Just had one glass, but definitely was sad to down the last sip. I love Firestone and this lived up to my expectations. If it were more available I would always have some in the cellar."
"Flavor is outstanding! Thick and creamy mouthfeel, mild carbonation, big boozy flavor! Tons of chocolate all over the palate. All the big stout characteristics are present, but the barrel aging makes this so nice! The sweet flavors are not overkill, but just enough to make you keep wanting more...making this thick beer surprisingly drinkable! A great beer from Firestone Walker...can't weait to age a couple to see how it mellows and/or changes!"
"Easy drinking, lovely beer. Love that it's not a sugar bomb!"
"Probably my favorite of Imperial Stouts I have tried. Manages to get across all of the enticing flavors (coffee, chocolate, oak) of a strong RIS on Oak without bashing you over the head. So easy to drink; can't wait for an opportunity to try another bottle."
"D- damn smooth and never harsh"
"Overall, I'm really happy I got a chance to try this beer and I'm looking forward to seeing how the other two age in my cellar. I feel like this beer would benefit from a 2-3% knock in the ABV and a slightly thicker body, but it's quite good as it is. Firestone Walker always does a good job with their blending and this beer is no exception. Definitely worth seeking out."
"This was a very drinkable stout, easy to put down, and didn't feel super heavy. I'm not sure how I feel about it being so thin as opposed to other stouts, but this beer was very smooth and tasty."
"Minimal head and dissipation, resulting in a very thin layer of head around the edge of the glass. Dark dark brown body no visible carbonation due to hue. The nose is pretty winy due to barrel aging with a lot of bittersweet chocolate aromas. Taste is huge hit of chocolate upfront, with oaky and winy notes, and significant hop bitterness on back end but kept in balance by significant malt bill, caramel, and the pervasive chocolate with a wee bit of coffee present. Mouthfeel is medium full, just a bit sticky, and a surprisingly dry finish given the chocolate notes. Pretty boozy effects drinkability, a sipper to be sure, this could certainly benefit from some cellaring. This is one very tasty beer, worthy of the buzz it has generated, wish I'd had grabbed a bottle at By the Bottle in Vancouver WA, as I am sure this is harder than hell to come by now."
"Flavor is deeply roasted malt, sweet, and some hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is nearly the same as the anniversary beers. For a stout, this is considered watery. It feels more like a porter which I find to be the major fault in the beer. Other wise this is an extremely well balanced and flavorful stout. The barrel aging does not seem to take a huge role in this though. I'd be interested to so if this could stand on it's own without the barrel aging."
"This bomber is alone, and i am enjoying every bit of it. yea its got some heat, but its so great for 13%."
"D: The alcohol is kept firmly in check, manifesting itself only in the bourbon notes...dangerously drinkable for such a big beer."
"Drinkability - A sipper as it should be. However, let me preface that by stating at such an early and fresh age for this beer, it is more drinkable than BCS and the Abyss at the same age. I was very impressed at how this beer turned out and I wish I could have had a second glass. Good thing I have two in my cellar. Highly recommended."
"At cellar temperature, I'm astounded by how hoppy this beer is. There's a lot of English hop character here, with a fairly high bitterness and leafy character noticeable. In addition, this batch has a lot more licorice character than I remember the first batch having, with a mild anise-like spiciness. Dark honey, a moderate bourbon character with vanilla and toasted coconut. The stout base is pretty nice too, with unsweetened baker's chocolate, molasses and licorice. The palate has all of the flavors the nose would suggest in a nice balance. Hoppy bitterness is strong on the finish, melding with the coconut and vanilla as well as some grainy bitterness. Moderately sweet as well, this has some dark caramel and candy sweetness on the mid-palate. A little less fudge-like and with more licorice and anise than I remember the first bottled batch having, this is an excellent stout. I want to drop my scores a hair, but I can't find a fair way of doing that, so my scores will stand for now."
"This is close to the perfect tasting beer. Its creamy and smooth, mildly sweet up front, not hot in the mouth. A subtle and well balanced liquor flavors, nice bourbon character. Its mildly dry but not harsh or acrid. Good roast in the back, some almost coffee like flavors. Very wonderful beer. I would drink this again if given the opportunity."
"Another yummy beer from the Firestone Walker."
"Drinkability- really good, I would like to get another one to share with my friend who is into stouts."
"All around, this is an exceptional barrel aged RIS at a reasonable price for the style."
"Great beer that lives up to the hype!"
"Rich dark chocolate smudged with oak, with a well integrated taste of mellow bourbon that lingers in the end. Traces of vanilla and coconut blend easily with a mellow bitterness. Though there's little indication of heat, it's still a mellow sipper best shared. I'm most impressed with how seamlessly Parabola is put together, nice work from the team at Firestone Walker..."
"Finally! Time to open one of my bottles. Pours a very dark dark obsidian black with a perfect tan/brown head. There's no light getting through this beer. The aromas from Parabola just flow up to my nostrils after opening the bottle. This smells amazing! Huge wooden(oak) scents with tons of chocolate and vanilla. When holding my nose into the glass, I get a nice amount of bourbon blended very well with chocolate, oak, and vanilla. The taste is huge on this thing! This beer is very rich and creamy with amazing complexity. I just get all sorts of flavors that make my palate very happy. The strongest flavors would be the chocolate and vanilla, followed very nearby by the wood and bourbon. I also get some great espresso notes and sweet candy sugar. Amazing taste. The mouthfeel is very rich and thick. This beer is definitely a dessert in itself. For how rich it is, I'm very surprised by the fairly high drinkability. This beer was a real treat that I think everyone should try before they die."
"Overall kind of a disappointing beer. I won't be seeking it out again."
"When I first poured this beer, I thought it was flat. No real head and black. I tell my drinking buddy, "" I hope this was worth the money""? First smell is coffee, a lot of coffee. Tastes of vanilla, bourbon and chocolate. The flavors blend to perfection. Not a question in my mind that this beer is worth the money. If anyone wants to do a trade, I am in...Because I will never see this beer in Florida."
"2012 vintage. This might be the best RIS I have tasted, coconut, chocolate, rich, spirits. It's almost like a boozy German chocolate cake, wow."
"D - This is a big beer but it really isn't very hot for the ABV. And is quite easy to drink."
"Move over Abyss, I have a new favorite BA RIS."
"O- Love this beer, its a big sweet RIS with no major drawbacks and all the right flavors."
"D- A wonderful beer overall by Firestone Walker. This beer I can tell will only get better with age or at least a couple more years on it. I am going to be looking for a few bottles for the cellar. Well worth the praise in every way."
"I really liked this on-tap a month ago, and I absolutely love this stuff now out of the bottle. To my palate, I think this may eclipse the bottles of FW 12 and 13 I've had recently. Between this, Abacus and the anniversary series, FW has shown they are masters of big -bal aged beers."
"There was a lot of hype around the bottling of this beer, and I'd say it just lives up to it. Not over, not under, but right there. Very tasty."
"Barrel-aged to perfection, while Firestone gives tremendous attention to their blending, the base beers (especially Parabola and Abacus) are remarkable on their own. ABV is well integrated into the whole - while the stout base isn't as remarkable as the best examples as the style, the subtleties from the barrel are unique to this brewer. Worth seeking out."
"D - Extremely drinkable. With the chocolate/coffee dominance overpowering the alcohol burn, coupled with its fairly light body, this is an easily drinkable beer."
"Wow, initially I was surprised by how vinous this was. Big fruity cherry/berry notes combining with charred woodsiness. But after the first few sips and as the glass warmed, these flavors were better integrated. Lots of rich malts, great complexity. Good amount of booze, a definite sipper, but this is just massive with great charred wood flavor and chocolate. A bit oily, but great mouthfeel as well. Sipped on my share of the bottle for almost an hour, it is rich and the 13% is warming. Another masterful beer from the FW guys, chooo choooo."
"D: glad I got this in a 10 oz. snifter, but I could easily drink three of these in a row, despite the alcohol. Definitely a sipper that gets better as it warms, but over a long session, I could keep going with this all night."
"Masterpiece. So glad I have one more bottle, & I might need another to age down the road. Though I might need to bury this one to keep from having the other bottle tomorrow night."
"Beautiful packaging for this thing with the box and nice old school label. Pours a true black with a one finger head at first that lowers to bubbles around the edge of the glass. Smell is disappointing with dark fruits and alcohol up front, and vanilla and burn taking a backseat. Flavor is goood. Great synthesis of chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, vanilla, and a tiny alcohol bite that is lower than would be expected after the nose. Pretty dry finish considering the body is medium thick. Mouthfeel is world class. EXCEPTIONALLY SMOOTH. Overall for this being young it is very good. In two years this might be a legend."
"Not as impressive as the Oak Aged Espresso Yeti I had the night before, but a great Impy stout."
"I loved this. I had a feeling I would and I did. This is the base for the Firestone Anniversary beers and those are among my favorite ever. Now I see why... Just awesome."
"Rich mouthfeel but not at all dense or cloying. Very nice sipper and this is its best point. Its lack of anything overpowering makes it an excellent sipping beer for those occasions when you don't want to be slammed by a great tasting beer. The alcohol is very well hidden."
"Do I need to say that this is delicous beer? A bomber of this may be a little much for me, but I'd certainly be happy to split one with somebody in the future...or be lucky and find Parabola on-tap again."
"D: Humm, what do you think? If I was made of money I would be quaffing these on a daily basis and always sad when another beer was offered. Each sip was swallowed with a small tinge of sadness as one of the best beers to ever cross my lips slowly and smoothly slipped down my throat. I was not sure what to expect with all of the hype but was unexpectedly blown away and came away impressed. Sometimes hype is well earned and if you are as much a fan of the infinite complexity of the imperial stout as I am this may well be your favorite beer. May my dreams tonight be filled with fresh bottles of Parabola and I may sleep the slumber of angels."
"Overall: Easy to see why this is one of the most sought after beers around. A must try! Cheers!"
"D: I don't know... something was a little off, and I can't put my finger on it. Despite tasting quite deliciously, I struggled to finish the bomber."
"I have procured a few more of these for aging and very much look forward to enjoying them later."
"Back to the smell, it *has* warmed up some and I do get notes of chocolate and vanilla and what barrel aging brings to the table but no way does the smell, imho, do the taste justice. This is one of the best barrel aged Stouts I have tried. Full marks to Firestone!"
"Bold flavors of dark chocolate, rich molasses, sweet whiskey and black licorice hit the taste buds first. There's a slight fruity, vinous quality to it as well, enhanced by a light tannic astringency. Barrel aging makes its presence known without overwhelming the complexities of the base beer, which has not always been the case in past iterations of this beer; this is clearly the most balanced batch of Parabola yet out of those I've tried. It has a hefty, chewy texture with a firm lingering roasted bitterness that clings to the tongue after a few sips and doesn't let go. Sweetness is reserved, at a perfect balance with the bitterness and tannins. The more I drink this, the more impressed I am. I've tried several batches of this beer over the years, some aged entirely in bourbon barrels, others in rye whiskey barrels, some a blend of different components. This one really nails it; the balance, nuance and delicacy make it my favorite batch yet. Thankfully, it's the one we finally got in bottles."
"D- I've had this both on tap and from the bottle, both are amazing, I enjoy the small 4oz of it just fine, the 22 becomes over whelming. but now that i have had it, i keep getting the urge to by more or drive back to firestone!"
"Overall, this is ok. Drink it quickly because as you drink it, its worse. It becomes flatter, less flavor and more alcoholic."
"D - Super drinkable for a 13%, was shocked to see that it was that much."
"D: This was excellent and will likely improve over the next year or so as the warming (which was increasingly noticable during the tasting) calms slightly. I really liked how well integrated the bourbon was with the stout. Not over the top, but just enough aging time to pick up the vanilla and oak flavors. Overall, this is excellent and I look forward to seeing this develop over the next couple years."
"D - The drinkability on this is very high for a 13% beer. Interested in what a year would do for this beer, thankfully I got more than one. Excellent sipper to be had over a longer period of time."
"Overall this a is very nice imperial stout, and at 13% is is highly drinkable. A good desert beer for sure. If the oak mellows a bit I think it could improve even more."
"Decadent, complex, outstanding. There's so much going on in this one and it all comes together in one fairly drinkable package."
"D: Wonderful beer for a relaxing afternoon/early evening. I'd be careful, hesitant even, pairing it with food. You won't want to miss out on or distract from the myriad flavors in this beer."
"Drinkability is hindered a bit at the present time due to a considerable amount of warming on the swallow, but overall it's just a fantastic beer to consume over the period of an entire evening as I am doing now. Who wants to share a beer this good, anyway? With that said, the alcohol heat doesn't detract from the flavor one bit. I'm guessing the alcohol heat will mellow with some more time, but I'm curious to see if that will hurt the taste, since it might start missing some of the alcoholic cherry flavor that I love so dearly."
"A very tasty brew but I think this will be much better after a bit of age. I'll be re-reviewing this beer later."
"For a big stout with 13% abv this is a very drinkable beer. The mouthfeel is great and the beer is an excellent stout."
"Very good drinkability for a young high-test beer. This needs to be aged for a year."
"Firestone parabola is nothing new... but lord is it good. I think that this beer is a textbook example of the Barrel Aged RIS style. Its not too sweet, not to hot (though it could use 9-12 months), and incredibly balanced. this beer will mature to really be a heavy hitter. Can't wait"
"overall a very good imperial stout. nice chocolate flavoring."
"Overall this exceeded my expectations."
"This beer young is fantastic and aged will only be even better. Glad I got some to hold on to. Yummy!!!"
"Overall I'm glad I busted open a bottle by myself and not sharing because I'm lovin this. I'll be sippin in this all night. Glad I have 5 more to put away and age. Amazing beer."
"Overall everything I wanted it to be and then some. One of the best BA beers I have ever had. It works on every level possible. So worth seeking out."
"The drinkability is pretty unreal for 13% abv. Simple delicious!"
"D- hell yes we need to get some road beers."
"D - One of the smoothest Imperial Stouts on the market, easily!"
"D- This brew, much like the full sail BBL stout, showcases the aspects of the barrel rather than the stout itself. Nothing wrong with that-but I prefer more balance. Its a decent, above average brew overall."
"Smooth medium-full body, with the extreme tininess of the bubbles ratcheting up the richness. A pleasure to drink."
"Firestone Walker knocked this one out of the park. You can tell the influence this beer had on Firestone Walker 13."
"Had at Jakes on tap, presented in a nice 8oz glass. Pitch black with no head. Smells like chocolate and burnt marshmallows, thick caramel malt and puppy kisses. Tastes like chocolate and burnt marshmallow, light char and a slight bitterness on the tail end. The alcohol warms just right and collaborates with the flavors decadently. Mouthfeel is perfect and the alcohol is sneaking up. I can see why there is so much hype on this beer."
"City Beer Store, Parabola release party. Two incredible barrel-aged beers from Firestone Walker in one night. Parabola pours a wall-to-wall black with a great brown head, thick and creamy. The aroma is complex and wonderful. Bourbon and oak are probably the strongest notes, but they don't dominate quite as much as in Parabola. There's a ton of dark chocolate, a healthy dose of roasted malt and a touch of vanilla. Brown sugar, molasses and caramel round it out. The flavor is all barrel-aged imperial stout goodness. All of those roasty sugars did their magic in the barrel, changing and blending with the barrel notes. It's not exactly sweet, but there are plenty of sugars present. There's definitely no unpleasant cloying sensation, despite its viscous feel. The finish gives a mild hop bite. This is a wonderful imperial stout."
"D-this is a nice imperial stout with some good balance between the roasted malts and the barrel aging. not hugely complex and a little boozy but not bad."
"Simply delicious, like I said really cant wait for a bottle or 5 to make it my way, damn fine offering."
"Mouthfeel is awesome. Just pure viscous velvet. One of the best I can recall."
"This beer needs some time to mellow out. It's pretty hot right now, and the roast is intense. I'd love some more bourbon or vanilla or something to even things out. Basically, I want it to be 13, which it isn't. On it's own it's a good beer, but I just know how much better it could be."
"D: Quite drinkable, although I really wish that the flavor profile was as well-integrated and complex as the nose. I'm definitely looking forward to trying this with a bit of age on it."
"Overall -- I want to go back to try it again to be sure, but right now I'm about ready to say that this is the best stout that I've tried to date. Absolutely fantastic."
"I like it, I like it a lot in fact, I just would rather have an abyss."
"Overall Score from Wiseman Justin: B (3.75)"
"What a treat! Thanks to the guys at Spuyten Duyvil!"
"Wow, the flavor and complexity of this was just outrageous and it's no wonder that the Anniversary blends are always so awesome with this being a big part of each one. This is one of the finest barrel-aged Stouts I've that I've had this year and I personally think that this is a bit underrated on here. Just fantastic stuff all around!"
"Had this on tap at the anniversary of Bailey's Taproom in summer of 2009. The colour was black with some caramel coloured edges. The aroma was brimming with toffee, dark chocolate and burnt caramel. On the palate, there was little CO2, but no matter as there was such a viscous character that CO2 seemed trivial. Loads of dark chocolate, coffee, treacle, toffee, caramel, molasses and I think a hint of lust and greed just for good measure."
"D - Good for a -bal aged imperial stout."
"D: I was expecting this one to be really overwhelming, but it wasn't at all. A fantastic beer, one that I wish I could have more often, and I actually ended up buying two glasses of it today."
"Overall an awesome brew that I'm glad to have had the chance to try."
"Draught at The Blue Palms. Black with a small tan head. Smooth deeply roasted malt and bourbon aroma. The flavor is an integrated blend of dark chocolate cake, caramel, vanilla, and light bourbon. The wood shows lightly but the overall barrel character is very integrated into the whole presentation of the beer, and the heat from the bourbon doesn't approach the richness of the malt. Thick with a silky texture. Probably the best bourbon-aged stout that I've had. The aging adds lots of complexity without drowning out the base beer. Firestone Walker needs to quite wasting all of this in the anniversary blends and bottle it as a separate release."
"Poured black with a light brown head that dissipated quickly, but expected given the ABV. Aromas were rich with hints of roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, bourbon, booze, vanilla, oak. Tastes were full and rich also - bold roasted malts, dark chocolate sweetness that lingers with notes of coffee, anise, bourbon, vanilla, oak, toasty grain. Mouth-feel was thick, smooth, and creamy - excellent! Finished with a hint of pepper as the dark chocolate lingers on the palate with the bourbon and vanilla. I had no clue this was 13% ABV while drinking it, and would recommend this to anyone who can get their hands on it! Excellent treat to have this one on tap!"
"I tried this beer at The Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beer 08. This beer pours black with a brown head. The aroma is light toast with plenty of chocolate and fruit. Well balanced bourbon, oak, and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is oily and the finish is sweet."
"This is a wonderful beer with tremendous complexity. Enjoyed best over an hour's period to allow it to warm and transition through a myriad of rich flavors. Very drinkable for such a big beer. I had no trouble enjoying a full-sized glass."
"D: Rich, smooth, complex, refined. Very tasty. A great post-dinner treat, or if just want to spoil yourself, drink it whenever."
"8/3/8/4/16 (3.9/5)"
"Drinkability- I could easliy buy this if it came out in bottles. A 12oz bottle would be sufficient."
"Very good, though a bit more harsh than expected, but it was very cool tasting another component of the anniversary ales as a stand alone offering."
"Drinkability- This was my favorite beer of the show. It was the first beer I tried when I walked in. After trying Erik's Ale next, I went straight back to Parabola. The whole thing really reminds me of BCS with how intense the bourbon is but with a spicy kick. Fantastic beer that I kicked myself in the ass for not trying at DLD and am really glad I got to try it now."
"Wish we got more Firestone Walker stuff in Chicago..."
"What can be said of this creation? It was outstanding. Like the Firestone 10 and 11, it is the result of skilled blending and masterful craftsmanship. Consider brewing and blending as an art - this is certainly one of its masterpieces."
"An exceptional stout. Was very happy to get a chance to try this. I really wish Firestone would up the production of this kind of stuff so it's not next to impossible to get."
"D- As odd as this may sound after my mouthfeel notes, this took a while just to drink through my 8 oz glass. Maybe it was the level of alchohol or maybe the overall richness, but there is no way that I could have had a second one of these on the same night."
"D: This is an outstanding beer from Firestone and I was suprised how fast I finished the glass. Not as good as the blend of Firestone 11, but this is great in its own right, glad I finally got to try it; I definitely want to have it again while it is still out."
"On-Tap at Toronado. Snifter glass. Dark black with a bloody red brown head of foam and excellent espresso khaki lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate, oak, whiskey, roasted malts, and green hops. Taste is syrupy sweet and than bitter with a lovely roast/hop combo and just the right sugary sweetness of chocolate coffee and bitter espresso at the end. Mouthfeel is chewy, thick, viscous, and warm on the finish. Drinkability is very good as well. A killer in the RIS or ADIS style categories. I can't wait for the FW12 and I am blessed that I have had this at least ten different times in the city over the past two years. FW has become one of the best breweries in all of NorCal. Bless Em'"
"Pours an insanely dark and evil looking black, very inky, no light gets through this one, very thick brown head forms, drops an insane amount of lacing, perfect retention, thick layer and ring until the glass is empty. This is about as perfect as a stout looks. Smell is insane as well, oak, toffee, chocolate, lots of licorice, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, very caramelized, alcohol, big hit of roast, very complex and layered, dark fruits up the ass, figs, it goes on and on. Taste is oaky vanilla up front, nice wood character, brown sugar, chocolate milk, roast, alcohol, licorice, molasses, some fruit, more roast, nice balanced roasty bitterness in the finish, this stuff is dangerous. Mouthfeel is pretty fulled bodied and thick, low carbonation, some warmth but you certainly don't get the 13%. Fantastic stuff, its a shame more people don't get to try this one."
"drinkability is great. hides its alcohol very well. great balance. just the perfect amount of barrel character to compliment the stout beneath. i could easily drink this all day. great stuff!"
"Have been wanting to try this one for a long time and this is the first time I have ever seen it, they are going right through this stuff and there is a good reason, it is fantastic, best imperial stout I have had in a long time, Firestone is a great brewery and their specialty brews continue to blow me away, cannot wait to drink again, highly recommended"
"An outstanding beer achievement. I'm going to label this THE BEST TASTING BEER I HAVE EVER HAD."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a light tan head. Minimal malty aroma. Similar elements in the taste, but with a nice combination of some spices, dark fruits, and maybe cask wood? Smooth with minimal carbonation. Strong in alcohol, but hardly present in the taste and very drinkable."
"Draft. Dark Lord Day 2008. Pitch black color. Integrated aromas of dark chocolate, dark fruit, vanilla, bourbon and coconut. Flavor is amazingly complex, with similar notes in the flavor as in the aroma. This one really shows Firestone Walkers great barrel aging ability and gave Oak Aged Dark Lord a run for its money."
"I get a lot of bourbon in the taste... A LOT. Wowza. Yeh, you can taste the 13%. I think I'd compare this to Goose's BCS, but actually much better. Man, I wish I had gotten another run at this but was extremely thankful to finally have tried something from Firestone. Hopefully, they'll continue to make this."
"D - Dark berry, boozy and magnificent. The finish is dry and it is easy to drink for its hugeness. A blessing to my taste buds - it tells the story well this Parabola is a testament to Firestone Walker-Kudos!"
"There's a kick to this beer from the hops. Spicy and hoppy and earthy. I am truly impressed with this Parabola. This needs to be made more often in larger quantities."
"Thick and creamy with a wonderful hop punch in the middle that leaves things spicey. Jesus this beer is delicious. The hop character really stands through and makes this BA stout much different than the others I sampled this fine day. (DLD). Thick with black fruits, mollasess, dark chocolates, black cherry, earthy hops, toasty vanilla oak, hints of bourbon, and a bit of dried dates. Delicious."
"Drinkability is high, delicious and well-balanced barrel-aged stout, great malt profile and creamy texture, good oak presence that accents without dominating, sweetness fluctuates between milk chocolate and dark fruits, absolutely a wonderful beer and a must-try for any beer fan!"
