Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate and dark fig and prune aromas with a definitive booziness. Light medicinal phenolics toward the end. Medium-full bodied with medium light carbonation and a lightly boozy heatness. Roasted malts and chocolate flavors with phenolic notes and astringency that push the drinkability limits.

Same goes through in the taste. Malts hit big in this one with notes of deep dark roasted coffee beans, deep dark chocolate and deep dark malts. This is a deep dark beer befitting of its fantastic name and label. The alcohol is hidden well in this one but it will creep up on you. Don't underestimate the Blaecorn Unidragon.","anon","Feb 13, 2015"

Just a little bitterness and some heat. Smokiness plays well in this brew. I wanna say this has some spicyness to it but I'm positive it doesn't have chilies in it. As it warms up the bitterness settles down and the bold flavors really come through. Mouthfeel is a nice mix of wet and dry. It's not overly thick but at the same time you're gonna want to drink this over a long period of time. I poured about 5oz and have been drinking it over the past hour or so. Overall a pretty damn good RIS. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it but Clown Shoes is doing great things.","MisSigsFan","Dec 11, 2014"

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a brown-to-black, with a sandy tan head, foamy, fluffy, and light, with a slow carbonation flow throughout. The aromas are boozy forward, with a heavy handed dose of hops bitterness, roasted coffee notes, cocoa nibs, woody notes, and earthy tones. Very dry and bitter on the nose. Flavors are dry and roasted forward, with a blast of booze, followed by coffee bitters, bittersweet cocoa nibs, subtle cream notes, earthy tones, and a boozy undertone that solidifies everything on the palate. Powerful brew. The body is robust and huge, but dry throughout. There is no sneaking through this beer. Big, all the way around. The finish is dry, but with solid, strong lingering characteristics of dry, bitter, and roast qualities. This is a big ass beer, and damn tasty!","GarthDanielson","0"

I will disclose that I did not have this beer fresh to draw a comparison. However, at nearly 3-years-old, it does not show any adverse effects of aging at all and shows all of the signs that make this beer one you can age for several more years, if you choose. But drinking it now regardless of age isn’t a bad idea either.","TheManiacalOne","Sep 30, 2014"

Smell is of dark chocolate, coffee, toffee, and a hint of dark ripe fruits reminiscent of fig. Initial sip reveals a pretty complex brew that doesn't have as much of the distinct chocolate or coffee flavors that the nose suggests. A plum/prune fruitiness is up front and the long lingering aftertaste is where the bitter dark chocolate, burnt caramel, and coffee comes into play. Thick rich mouthfeel that feels pretty good leaves me wanting more. High quality RIS, my first clown shoes experience has been a good one.","slackattack","Jun 22, 2014"

Then when I took a drink it was like pow in the face with a smokey flavor I didn't really get on the nose. The smokey notes fade to chocolate and bitter coffee. The flavor is moslty dark roasty malts and lingering bitterness, so if you are looking for a more chocolate or sweet RIS I would pass on this. This body isn't very thick but the flavors sit on the palate for awhile. I keep smacking my lips and the beer just lingers which I am digging. The more I drink it the more impressed I get with it. When I first started it was like a low 4 now it's a solid 4.25. Might have pick on up to age.","GetMeAnIPA","Jun 11, 2014"

I can't recommend cellaring it just because it's already got a fairly mild flavor, but who knows, maybe it'd be a good idea (bottle recommends it). The nose on this brew had me very excited, but the flavor just left me a bit more than content. Roast, coffee, smoke, and a bit of earthy hoppiness. I like hoppiness in a black ale (strangely enough), but I never seem to love it in Imperial Stouts. I suppose I'd say... try this one for yourself and decide. It looks phenomenal, it smells fantastic, and has a great feel... but the taste has me wanting something more.","Alextricity","Mar 30, 2014"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, smoke, coffee, light char, toast, floral, grass, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and compexity of dark/roasted malt notes with a fair amount of hop presence; and great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, light char, toast, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, light char, toast, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; with a nice malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and moderately chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Russian imperial stout. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 14, 2013"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth for what it was, a little warming, filling, rich, and the tastedid a nice job at holding my attention, but I think one glass is the perfect amount for me, I'm pretty sure I could take out the full bomber, but I might regret that decision later. It made for a good beer to have on a cold night. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and complexity, I thought those two aspects stood out as being pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the heavy smokey aspect, if it was toned down a little it would let more of roasted notes through. I don't know if I would get this beer again, but I might get one for aging to see how it changes overtime. I would recommend this to anyone who likes strong and smokey stouts. All in all I enjoyed this beer, I thought this was just as smokey as Porcine, maybe even a little more and I thought the barrel aspect worked very well with Porcine so I prefer Porcine Unidragon, but I thought this was still a good beer and a nice platform to build on, but I wasn't expecting it to be as smokey as it it was. Good job guys, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Nov 27, 2013"

Pour absolutely pitch black; very little color even when held to light. Khaki head that diminished quickly. Great smell, and pretty spot on for what you would expect from an RIS: lots of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee but with more hops than most. Flavor has about the same profile, but more coffee comes through. Not overly sweet, and still pretty hoppy for a stout. Just a touch of alcohol, but you would never suspect it was pushing almost 13%. Mouth feel is great, full and smooth, not thick and sticky, mild carbonation brings some of the lighter flavors to life. Overall, excellent, and worth every penny.","Samuel906","Oct 21, 2013"

As you drink it it has obvious characteristics of coffee, oak, and roasted malts with lighter hints of chocolate, molasses, and even maple syrup. The hoppy after taste is not too unpleasant and encourages the next sip. Very enjoyable beer!","gvisciano","Mar 16, 2013"

Taste is lightly sweet..molasses, figs, dark chocolate..balanced against deeply roast-charred malt and bitter citrus pithy hop. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is velvety, medium bodied, nice carbonation pricks the tongue and stirs up,the taste buds. Roasty char finish keeps the palate honest and not cloying. Very good, a big imperial stout.

On the nose, the beer smells boozy and sweet with touches of char and chocolate. There is the faintest touch of raisin dark fruit in the nose as well. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and oddly salty with a big wash of char and burn. The beer begins big salty, like surprisingly salty. The salt builds as the semi-sweet chocolaty malt moves in with a touch of cloying booze and is then eaten up as the roast moves in with big charred flavors that linger in the mouth. The salt and booze fade away and the finish is charred with the booze burning on the back of the throat. The aftertaste rings with char, too. On the mouth, the beer feels heavy in body with a slight creamy feel from the carbonation with a slight syrupiness. The carbonation gives a little prickle but also cradles the tongue nicely. The mouth is left charred, and dry from the roast with a light stickiness on the tongue. Overall, this is a great big Russian Imperial Stout. The flavors are big and the alcohol, while present, is nicely presented. This beer is tasty and could only blossom in a barrel (side note: I’ve had Porcine Unidragon, which is a barrel aged version of this mixed with Vampire Slayer, but I want just this to be in the barrel). Try this beer!","Maxwell","Feb 26, 2013"

There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted and burnt/charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, licorice, molasses, and some herbal hops. Taste is mostly like the aroma, it tastes like roasted and burnt/charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, licorice, piney hops, coffee, and a bit of dark fruit and toffee.

Flavor is way over the top and perhaps a tiny bit overly ambitious, but hell, I just love beer. One truth that absolutely pertains to me is that I look for the best in all things, and I tend to find it and enjoy. This might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but I think that it is just lovely--producing an effect that is greater than the sum of its parts. Will definitely drink again.","KKB","Nov 25, 2012"

Intense and earthy aromas of vanilla, pine, licorice and alcohol dominate the nose. It has a perfect mothfeel, creamy with low carbonation. The tast carries oasted malt up front that fades slowly and elegantly into a dark chocolate and bitter hop finish. There is definately a warming sensation to be had from drinking this brew, although the alcohol is surprisingly undetectable on the palate. Overall, I wish that there was a more intense flavor profile. Compared to the smell and appearance of this beer the taste felt somewhat muted. The bottle states that it improves with age, I'll have to cellar a few and see what happens. Definately recommended.","silverking","Nov 19, 2012"
4.12,1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"There is a very distinctive stab of licorice aroma on the nose, overlaying the char, ash, coffee, and an additional welcome garnish of pine resin. The flavor, at first, resembles as though somebody had made charcoal briquettes out of carbonized raisins. As it warms up, the flavor gains elements of pithy bittering, smokey ash, and bitter cocoa powder. The ABV is hard to detect, so I advise taking it slowly with this one. This is a pretty good RIS that distinctively leans hard on the char side of the balance spectrum with framing accent notes of licorice aroma and resinous flavor.","WastingFreetime","Nov 16, 2012"

A bit dry in the middle, but overall a good flavor progression and the rich flavor covers the booze noticed in the aroma. Nice creamy medium to heavy body. A nicely made, spot on RIS.

The dry smokiness of the beer is more aggressive in the taste, as some woodiness smooths it out a little but this is one thick sipper that I had to take slow. Along withe dryness is some sweetness derived from dark chocolate and a touch of toffee (I think) and there's a hint of floral hops and dark fruit (cherry is all I can think of), but for the most part this is just a fuller bodied malt bomb. ABV barely bleeds into beer, but still hits you as you sip and this one took a long time to nurse. A good beer, just a little rough for me to consider great.","clayrock81","Apr 20, 2012"

Pours a deep pitch black color, thick off-white head, bordering on tan. Thick appearing texture. A beast of an Imperial Stout from appearance. Smell- roasty notes, dark fruits like currants, raisins, etc. Some booze notes, expected with a 12.5% beer that is relatively fresh. There is a weird plastic aroma, but its not a huge detractor. Taste- black roastiness, coffee bitterness, a boozy blast of sweet dark fruits. In the end, leaves a sweet chocolate bitterness and a strong hop presence. I have to say I am impressed. This is the mean badass experience I tend to like from my Russian Imperial Stouts. It asserts itself with aggression but overall is pretty drinkable and balanced for the ABV.

Smells of bitter earthy ans citrus hops, roasted grains, coffee, alcohol and bits of wet dog. Taste is quite smokey up front, I wasn't expecting that from the aroma. Rich dark malts, roasted grains, ethanol, and citrus hops all rush in and no one can figure out who is in charge. Thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick oily mouthfeel. This has the makings of a great stout, but right now the flavors aren't melding well and the alcohol is a bit too present. I think with a bit of age this one might just be fantastic, we will have to see.","johnnnniee","Nov 30, 2011"

3.21,-21.3,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Blaecorn Unidragon pours a solid black, with a finger's worth of mocha foam sitting atop the beer. The head displays both good retention and lacing. The malty side of the nose is disappointing in that it's basically roasty and ashy, without much of a chocolate or coffee presence at all. There is a nice citrus undercurrent though, which manages to keep things at least a little interesting. I have a pretty similar reaction to the flavor profile. The malty flavors are still a little too roasty/ashy centric, although there is a little bit more coffee here than in the aroma. Again, there's a nice orange-y hoppy flavor that's present on the back end. It's all also a little bit mild, not nearly as potent as I might have anticipated. The body is nice and rich, full without becoming overbearing. The carbonation is a bit too much though, definitely takes away from what should be a malt centric beer. That's just the thing, Blaecorn Unidragon is supposed to be a big malty monster as an imperial stout, but the only compliments I find myself paying it are for its hops.","axeman9182","Nov 20, 2011"
4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a 3"" dark mocha head with a lasting merengue, however, the beer seemed to exhaust all its effervescence in the process. Looks black as coffee. Smells like coffee, cocoa, and malt. Taste repeats the smell but what I definitely want to address is the high alcohol. I'm not at all averse to high alcohol in beers but they need to meld with the flavors, not simply burn. In my opinion Blaecorn is hot for hot's sake. If they'd toned this down to 8% or 9% like many others Imperial Stouts I suspect this would be even more of a winner.","MoreThanWine","Nov 20, 2011"

This case-in-point pours a deep black (no fancy synonyms can do this black justice, so it's just plain black here) topped by over a finger of sienna foam. The nose comprises darkly roasted coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, dark greens, and a small whiff of char. I never thought I'd say this, but this beer smells too damn dark... The taste holds notes of burnt malts, light char, light leather, bitter dark chocolate, and pine resin. It's good, but comes awfully close to being too bitter for its own good. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a mostly solid stout, but I think they overdid a few things here, particularly with the over-roasting of everything. That, coupled with a slightly too-thin body and an overly aggressive hopping make for a less-than-fully-enjoyable stout experience for me (see my reaction to Hoppin' Frog's DORIS, as the two seem very similar to me).","TMoney2591","0"

Nice texture, full bodied without being extremely heavy, carbonation was on the lighter side but not as fine as I would have liked, alcohol warmth was apparent but not hot. Solid bitterness throughout, with hops and sweet malts battling for supremacy. Citrusy with a piney edge, caramel and roast, dry cocoa, toffee and dark chocolate, slight vanilla.
