"A delicious, drinkable imperial stout...  A lot of flavor and very enjoyable."
"I like the barrel-aged better, but this is always a good one."
""
"Though I had high expectations, this beer did not deliver. The taste was not really what I was looking for. A beer this dark should have more roastiness/etc to it. But that's not really what I got here. The beer looked and smelled great, but besides that it was just average. I would say skip this beer and just pick up some Edmund Fitzgeralds."
""
"Some hickory smoked / wood fired taste on this one, not a cream / chocolatey stout but more of the fire & brimstone type.  Some dark berry / burnt fruitcake is also present, and it finishes with a lingering toasted malt.  Intriguing, but not exactly in my personal wheelhouse."
"'Twas a good choice for my first Great Lakes gonna have to try the rest of their line up"
""

"O: [4.50] This is an excellent Stout (one of the best I have had).  It hits on all fronts.  The nose is great and inviting and plays into the taste.  The taste doesn't follow the nose exactly but continues a theme.  The nose and body both share a great mild char and chocolate.  The mouthfeel is velvety and sexy.  I can't think of anything to knock this beer for."
""
""
""
"T chocolate moca coffee with slight alcohol this is a must for stout lovers who dont care about barrel age"
"12 oz bottle.  Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, brown head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of roasted malt, toast, dark fruit, alcohol and coffee, some sourness.  Body is full, creamy and smooth.  Taste is of toasted malt, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit, herbal hops and unpleasant sourness.  Something is very wrong with this bottle."
""
""
"This is a very solid RIS, one that I can only imagine makes for a fantastic base for barrel-aging.  Not in FIS/Speedway/Ten-FIDY territory, but perhaps the tier immediately below."

"Yay! Love this beer. Five words."

"Poured dark, nearly opaque with thick, light tan head and thick lacing.  Looks like a classic stout.  Smell is burnt coffee and chocolate.  I didn't discern the smell of any fruit or other sweet flavor.  Taste emphasizes the coffee but there is a bitter hoppiness.  I've read other reviews but I'm not tasting any dark fruit. You can taste the alcohol but at 9% it's not overwhelming.  Good creamy mouth feel.  Overall, this is a very good imperial stout but I'm missing the dark fruit."
"I mean...I like stouts and all. And I like this one. But I was hoping for a thicker, blacker, stouter stout. Uhh what?? Didn't hear me?? Did I stouter??"

"One of my favorites ever."
""

"Pours black under a quickly diminishing beige head.  A bubbly ring forms at the edges.  Big roasted malt and dark chocolate aromas meet some hops and malted milk balls.  Dark malty flavors of molasses, black malt char, dark fruits, vanilla, and a little coffee on the finish.  Hoppier than most, but still secondary to the malts. Perhaps a bit less than full bodied, chewy, and smooth. A warming sensation grows deep in the throat, but things stay drinkable. Still a classic RIS - able to stand on its own without the addition of adjuncts or barrel aging."
""
""
""
""
"O: The simplicity of the flavor profile and relatively light body make this a very drinkable RIS, but ultimately it's a dead end. Any more hops and it would break into black IPA territory, any more malt and it would be lost among the mediocre stouts. As it is, it's tasty and distinguished. In a supersaturated beer world, that's saying a lot."
"Dark opaque black. Light, sweet aroma. Chocolate, coffee, mocha, little bitterness.  Light carbonation."
"Pours brilliant deep dark brown under a thin tan head. There is some light roast on the nose with traces of dark dried fruit. It has a big creamy palate with cried fruit, light roast and hints of mild coffee and chocolate flavors. Medium full body and medium low carbonation. Easy to drink, slightly warming."
"Overall: A nice and solid RIS. It's surprisingly pleasant and I found myself quaffing it a bit faster than most other beers at 9%, although it was still nice and creamy. Would probably drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm really surprised by the low pDev value (8.55%). I would think there would be more disparity based on how thin it is and the lack of fruit character and complexity for the style. Certainly a unique brew."
""

"With the Exception of their Nosferatu, I find nearly all of the Great Lakes' beers just average, and this is unquestionably the most disappointing one I've had. This has the absolute look and feel of a halfway decent porter; it has no business, in my opinion, advertising itself as an RIS. With the last few sips left in the glass, the liquid looked nearly identical to soda. Given its rating, I'm apparently in quite a minority here, but I think this is flat-out a bad stout."
"Overall - fantastic russian imperial stout!"

"Overall good, but doesn't stand up to some of the greats. Hard/near impossible to pour it with a head. Thin mouthfeel. Nice nose and good, though."
"solid stout...  just left me wanting a little more in taste profile"
""
"I'm thinking this was a 2012 bottle as the best by date was 4/28/13. This stout had aged wonderfully and was very full bodied with a great nose. It was very smooth and had no alcohol taste. I had received this as an extra in a trade a while ago and wow what an extra. I am humbled to say the least!"
""
"Overall:  Goddamn, this in one of the best non-barrel-aged Imperial Stouts I’ve ever had!!  Strong, big, bold flavors of roasted malt and strong amount of brown sugar, balanced beautifully with hops.  This is another excellent beer from Great Lakes, and could easily become my favorite beer from that outstanding brewery!  It’s fucking brilliant!"

"BBD 5/13/15.  Pours black as a starless night.  Above normal head volume, excellent lacing and retention.  Nice complex nose of semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, roast notes, hints of vanilla and dark fruit (plum, date) in the background.  Almost full bodied with a nice creamy texture.  Slightly above normal carbonation with a touch of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is intense, very complex and reasonably balanced.  It begins with a wave of flavor that slowly separates into sweet dark chocolate over molasses, then flows into the subtle vanilla and dark fruit notes. The middle is a strong roast flavor over a roast and hop bitterness that puckers the tongue a bit over a caramel sweetness.  The finish is a slow fade of caramel/molasses sweetness over a lingering bitterness with just a hint of alcohol.   This one is an excellent example of a roast forward stout that is masterfully complex and reasonably balanced with sweetness."
""
""
"Poured a very dark black, with brown hints around the edges as you move it under light. A light tan head caps it, lasting a good way into the beer and leaving nice soapy lacing. The aroma is a blend of deep roasted malts and dark fruits, (raisins, figs) and the taste follows closely along. It is much sweeter than I would have expected, but that is not a bad thing. The body is a little lighter in weight (not as slick or heavy) but still quite good."
"O- Kinda find this one to be a bit too much sweetness forward and lacking in a big flavor to match that sweetness. In my opinion it's pretty forgettable, a bit hard to find, at least in my area, and on the pricey side compared to others in its league that I prefer far more."
"Overall, this is another solid offering from Great Lakes.  Wish I'd bought another bottle."
"Lots going in here. Love it."
"Overall, I dig it.  This stout vaguely reminds me of Narwhal, but I like this a tad better.  It is sweeter and smoother."

"Overall: This is the best Great Lakes beer I have had. I need to try more of the special releases. They are beginning t surprise me! Still not my favorite brewery but they definitely do darker beers better than the ales, in my opinion."

"Fantastic imperial stout, served on draft into snifter at Harding Tavern. Light on the nose, with no big roasted notes apparent until you take the first sip here. More complexity opens up as this warms. Great smooth, thick body and mouthfeel which falls short of oily. Retains minimal head, appearance similar to a cola. Excellent chocolate and hint of hop notes come through here. For the high ABV this is devastatingly drinkable, much like the other beers in GLBC’s stable. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"Pours really thick and dark, with a medium creamy head. Smells of grains, molasses and burnt coffee. Very full taste of raisins, burnt coffee and a dark cherry taste. Creamy mouthfeel with little carbonation. Overall a very good Imperial Stout that is multi-dimensional."

"Overall (4.25): This is one of those beers that i find great generally speaking, but lacks within the style. It drinks more like a regular stout in mouthfeel and aroma. In fact, i find this strikingly similar to Deschutes Obsidian. It has a very traditional stout taste without any bells and whistles we often see in Russians nowadays. Other than that i really cant say anything bad about it. If this was labeled a regular stout id give it 4.5+ but as a RIS i give it a 4-4.25. Its a damn tasty beer regardless. Cant knock GL for playing it safe with this one"
""
"Awesome stout. Holds its own against anyone!"
""
"Tastes and smells a lot like Brazil Nuts.  You know, those weird looking dark and triangular nuts that are usually in holiday (in the shell) mixed nuts.  Maybe that's just me but I feel pretty strongly about it.  Other than that, I really liked ""StonedTrippin"" 's review.  He sums it up nicely."
"Thin for the style but really tasty. Something of a session imperial stout if there is one.  Really toasty and choclately.  This stout is underrated because it's not as thick and dense as some of the big hitters. Probably not an ager so drink fresh because the flavors are spot on."

"Ya, like other reviews have said it does have that potent taste you would expect from a beer with 9% alcohol, but if that's what you're expecting then you're in for a treat. Great flavor and texture for a beer as strong as this."
"Tastes good, but too heavy for me."
"Too boozey for me, but gd silky mouthfeel."

"Overall, a middle of the road imperial stout. Not something I would seek out but definitely wouldn't decline if offered."
""
""

"Taste is less roasted than the scent. A nice well rounded chocolate flavor. Hops only provide balance without creating any strong bitterness or flavor. Only a hint of alcohol warmth. Very well rounded imperial stout that doesn't punch you in the face as many in the style can. Very well done."
""
""
"one of the classics, although this one isnt always as easy to find as the other great lakes beers. i was lucky enough to have this one on tap during my travels, so awesome. its a dense stout, but not thick and sludgy like bourbon county or anything. in fact, it might be one of the better carbonated imperial stouts out there. its a lot like old rasputin from north coast i though, maybe a little less of the english ale yeast character in this one, but the grain bill feels very similar. its big and full bodied, but its also interesting, with maybe some oats or even rye in here in some proportion. it gives the beer a fluffy feeling, and i taste raisin and chocolate in here, its delicious without being overly complex. pillowy in its mouthfeel and well carbonated, which is uncommon and unexpected in the style, and the finish lasts forever. the booze is well hidden behind the unsweetened chocolate bitterness. a true gem, especially on tap. easily one of the best non barrel aged stouts in the country."

"A wonderful stout.  Pitch black with a mocha colored head of faom that falls in streaks andlevaes spots to look at too.   Roasty with a hint of chocolate on a deep sweet malt.  Caramel and brown sugar.  Taste follows that nose all the way.  Big beautiful stout.  Lots of maltiness.  From the way it rolls on to the palate, to the way it envelopes the palate. It's all about the delicious malt.  I love it.  Roasty, with a bit of molasses, chocolate and a nuttiness.  Dry firm and unending.  A slight ting form alcohol on the nose and one on the palate at the very end with a friendly warmth."

"Not too bad.  The body and low carb in this doesn't hit the spot for me.  Almost makes it a session stout if their is such a thing but I wouldn't really want more than one in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours watery, black color with a small tannish head, there is a little lacing.  The odor is strong with notes of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, slightly smoky.  The taste is a little thin, but full of flavor, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, very malty, slight pine, and some bitterness throughout."

"So, now I know.  Next time I am in the store, buy more. This is an excellent RIS and I would put it up against any of the non BA big boys for top of the heap."
"Overall: Another great offering from Great Lakes and a solid Imperial Stout. The unusual sweetness might be a turn-off to some, so maybe stay away from this brew if you're not into that, but if you are, it's hard to do better!"
"O: has many of the moreish qualities that their Ed Fitz possesses... this is certainly in the upper echelon of American-style (non-adjunct, non-barrel-aged) strong stouts... wish I bought another bottle"

"There are several advantages to living in the northeast in the winter, and getting Blackout Stout in a growler is one of them.  The mug is a black hole that defies the transmission of light.  The flavor is rich with deep coffee and chocolate, without any alcoholic bite, and it leaves you with a touch of sweetness.  Get it whenever the opportunity is available."

"Based on all other ratings of this beer, I'm thinking I got a bottle in the early stages of infection. I almost drain poured it after tasting it right out of the fridge. It was slightly tangy, with an unpleasant berryish flavor. I also got a tiny bit of soy sauce and some char. The beer did improve as it warmed up though, which is now making me question myself. The bottle was best by 4-15, I think? Not sure how far out GLBC dates bottles of Blackout, but I'm willing to bet this beer was mishandled at some point. GLBC has only been in our distro for a month. I'm being kind with this rating because I have a hard time believing this is what it's supposed to taste like. I'll have to try a different batch or a draft version to give this beer another shot."

"Overall- Nice balance of flavors, an interesting sweetness throughout mostly chocolate but also has a certain dark fruit profile. Counterbalance of bitterness from wonderful coffee notes and slight hop. The aroma is suprisingly absent for the most part, just not much there, mouthfeel is also a tad thin, can get watery at times. Still, a very pleasent and flavorful beer."
""
""
""
"Overall- I remember this being my favorite RIS last year. Now, I drink this and appreciate it for being a good beer... but honestly I find it gross. There is a milk chocolate overtone that I think is absolutely disgusting. Way too sweet for an Imperial but too heavy to be a dessert stout. Still a well crafted beer, but I won't be buying it again anytime soon."

"Mouthfeel is not light, but surprisingly light. Based on the viscous pour I thought it would be much thicker and heavier. Overall, very good."
"Great Lakes Blackout Stout brewed by Great Lakes Brewing Co., with an ABV of 9.0%  This brew pours out a dark brown color, with a light brown head.  Blackout Stout has the look of coffee. The smell is rich with flavor and malts. There is some sweetness in the smell of this brew. The taste is rich with flavor. This brew puts you in the mind of dark chocolate with roasted malts. There is a lot going on in this brew. Nothing overpowering in this brew, Blackout Stout has a real nice balance to it.  The mouthfeel is rich and smooth.  There is a lot of flavor, but a nice amount of smoothness. You can not pick up on the high ABV in this brew. Overall, I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5.  Great Lakes Brewing Co. did a nice job with this one. I would by this again."
""

" Overall, a 4.75  for Great Lakes Blackout Stout - Great Lakes Brewing Co. A great choice to get you out of the funk a miserable winter's day can bring. I will certainly buy this brew again!"

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/28/2012. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, light licorice, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, light-moderate dark fruit, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, plum, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, light-moderate dark fruit, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Russian imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, light-moderate dark fruit, and light earthy hops flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall, this beer has some ups and downs in my opinion. Looks great as most RIS' do with a muted aroma which was unfortunate. The redeeming and most important quality is it has great, quality flavors that round out very well. This is a good take on the style for sure. I'd like to see how some age mellows it out in the future."

"O - Very solid choice from the growler selections at Jungle Jim's. I like this stout quite well. Will be looking for it again the next time I'm in Ohio."
""
"From the tap in a snifter. Pours black, black, black. Seeing a beer like this makes you realize just how dark a beer can be. Scent is coffee, chocolate, and a bit of caramel and toffee. Taste is the same but there's a sweet underbelly that makes this a very smooth drinking RIS. I did not smell or taste the alcohol but I felt it. Texture is rather creamy. I had this in a bottle a year ago and thought it was solid but somewhat over-roasted. No sign of that here. An excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Opaque black with khaki head. Aroma has figs, black cherry, plum, raisin. Then chocolate and a hint of alcohol. Flavor is well balanced and subtle. Coffee/roasted malt, hops, chocolate malt. Feel is drinkable for abv. a bit creamy. I prefer this over most of its peers."
""
""
""

"Overall, I like the flavors in this beer but the mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired. A bit thin in the middle but too sticky at the end and too much sweetness through it all. Not bad, though."

"O- I'm a bit conflicted. Once this warmed, it was, without a doubt, the sweetest beer I've ever put in my mouth. It was like a coffee you accidentally put 1 or 2 too many sugar packets into. But at the same time, after each sweet assault up front, the flavors glided into either complimentary or contrasting flavors. Each aftertaste shifted its focus as well. I can't help but be impressed by the range of sensations this one puts you through."

"This is a tasty, smooth easy drinking beer. The flavors really come through as the beer warms."

"Bottle from jbwimer. Thanks bud! Pours dark brown to black with some light shining through the pour--a bit more than the BA version--and settles black in the glass with a half finger khaki colored head. Aromas of milk and dark chocolate, some roast, and more chocolate. Flavor is big roastiness with a nice balance of chocolate that is not too sweet. Lingering roast on the palate and a nice bitterness to finish. Velvety mouthfeel that is medium plus and super drinkable for the style. A really nice brew as usual from GL. Very drinkable and on the lighter side for the style but still plenty of big roast and chocolate flavor."

"Great Lake Brewing Blackout Stout is a Russian Imperial Stout that boasts a big 9%ABV~ About as deep pitch black as you can get, very little brownish reflects off with the iPhone flashlight test~ A medium to full bodied head that hung around enough to hear one Led Zeppelin track~ Smell is heavy malt, raisin, Soy Sauce, Earthy, Coffee, Sugar Cookie and Vanilla~ Feel is HUGE, really like a liquid solid, it's big, bold and very present, any heaver and I could substitute it for my 10w 20 yeah... Its chewy and HUGE~ Taste is Chocolate, Coffee, Molasses, an army of malt, some dark bread, Brown Sugar, Licorice, Dark Fruit, Toast, Charcoal, Cookies and Cream and espresso~ Nice and silky smooth, however a huge alcohol burn lingers on the after taste, a bit too much for a 9%, I'm from Cleveland... I'll say it: Blackout Stout is overrated, sure I'll buy it every time it comes out, GLBC needs to work on balancing and mellowing this one out~ Overall: 74"
"O- a good beer but the coffee taste was way too strong it didn't blend well with the malt. It reminded me a lot of terrapin oatmeal coffee wnb. The mouthfeel was a little bit too thin as well."
""
"Thick, black, heavy! the perfect beer to get you through a long winter night, a night without power. it's better heated up by the fire. the soft head belies the layers of roasty deliciousness. Sweet molasses, cola, tart cherry, and coffee walk through the flavor profile. remarkably easy drinking for the abv."

"Bottle (2013, fresh). Pour is murky black with slight head. Aroma is yeast, a bit of coffee. Taste is malt - roasted but not sweet. Some hop traits in the background but not as aggressive as the malt here. Well balanced and an easy drinker but nothing crazy."

"Appearance is a dark brown with amber edges and a half finger of head that dissipated very quickly. The nose has only mild roasted notes. The flavor profile is considerably roastier than the nose might indicate. This offering is definitely full-bodied. The finish is hoppier than most other RISs, which is a touch odd, but certainly NOT unpleasant to my palate."

"A well-crafted, no-frills imperial stout. I'm not clamoring for more but I won't turn it down either."
"Great Lakes makes some excellent beers, but this 2013 Blackout Stout did not live up to its ratings. Plenty of better Imperial Stouts out there."
""

""

"O: I found this beer to be very enjoyable and has a great flavor/aroma. Very easy to drink with well hidden alcohol, I would be happy to have a couple of these but alas I was only able to find one when searching the local beer stores this year. Definitely worth grabbing if you come across it and wishing I could find the barrel aged version."
""
"The beer pours a deep dark brown, and sits in the glass as midnight black. It forms a head of tan colored bubbles atop the beer, but swiftly whittles that away to a scrim. In body, the beer is slightly viscous and nearly perfectly opaque, which just hints of ruby light escaping through the edges of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of medium roast coffee, with baker’s chocolate and dark fruit notes dancing in and out of the nostrils. It smells almost like a blend of hot cocoa and coffee. Touches of creamy milk even show themselves to the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly sweet and fruity in its beginnings, but dries out perfectly with bitter roast and a touch of herbal hops in the finish. Slightly tart acidity also shows its face at the beginning of the sip, but is bulled away by the rich roasted bitters. In flavor, the beer begins as plum juice, milk chocolate, and a touch of raisins. This moves forward into rich dark roast coffee notes and then char and a light bite of herbal hops on the finish. The dark fruit returns on the finish and aftertaste, and sits nicely on the palate for a while. In the mouth, the beer feels just below full in body, with a smoothness that borders on being thin given the beer’s alcohol percentage and style. The mouth is left coffee-bitter but with a lot of acid-canceling saliva swimming in the cheeks. Overall, this is a nice imperial stout. In terms of the Russian Imperial Stout, it falls a little flat for what I look for in the style, but it has some awesome imperial stout characters that work perfectly. I want more roast and charred malt flavors in this beer in order to see it as an RIS, but its deeply fruity and tart malt character at the beginning was really quite intriguing and made the beer interesting and complex to sip. The mouthfeel was a bit thin overall for what I wanted for the style, but that does make the beer easy to sip. This is a really nice imperial stout with some funky character. Not my favorite in the style, but a nice interpretation."

"Great Lakes Blackout Stout ---4/5."
"The Blackout Stout is another solid offering from Great Lakes. The beer pours a solid opaque black with off white head that is leaving a lacing. The scent carries a roast and slight helpings of coffee, anise and chocolate. The taste has a nice balance of roast, coffee, toffee and peat. The mouthfeel is fuller in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a solid stout and perfect for those winter nights."
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Complex flavors that at times were a little too much. The whole smokey/ashy flavors worked well. A nice change of pace from other Imperial Stouts from the US. Solid choice although I don't know if I'd ever crave it or be excited to have it."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""

"Very impressive RIS, one of the better ones I've had in the style. It's not as bitter as Plead the 5th, nor is it as hoppy as Obsidian Stout or Storm King, nor is it as rich as Founders' Imperial Stout, nor is it as complex as Darkness or Marshal Zhukov- but it's excellent and incorporates all the characteristics I have really come to enjoy from each of these other Russian Imperial Stouts. I highly recommend getting one four-pack of this beer for every winter."
"Overall - Very good imperial stout and one I will buy again. Would love to age but don't have the willpower. Growler is enough to share between one and one half large men or four small women."

"poured into a snifter this beer poured a pitch black color with a finger and a half worth of head. not much of a smell besides some faint dark chocolate and coffee. very faint though. the taste was the star here with plenty of coffee and bitter dark chocolate. at first you can taste some hops immediately followed by dark malts, coffee, bitter chocolate,and some type of dark fruit. Overall this was a very good stout for the price and is a good example of the style."

"The taste was fantastic. It was very similar to the smell but everything was incredibly balanced and smooth. I am curious to age this one to see if the roastiness fades a bit and lets the great chocolate taste come forward a little bit. In the category of ""easy drinking imperial stouts", this one is a winner."

"World class beer from one of my favorite breweries."
""
"Pours out dark as night with a two finger light brown head with great reatention. Really pours out nice. Smells is quite malty with definitely some dark malts, dark fruits, just really some nice dark goodies. Really can't even smell any hops. Tastes just like the nose except there is a little coffee in there with a tiny bit of booze. Really tastes quite like the nose with way more coffee, Everything is amazing as it REALLY is stout forward. No chance of tasting hops here. Over all this is a hella great stout for the ABV. Hard to do anything better for the ABV. Just a masterpiece."

"D: my favorite thing about this stout is its undeniable drinkability and balance. just a really good drink, not necessarily a sipper, which makes this big brew that much more dangerous. to my celler-folks out there, my recommendation is to drink this fresh. drinks great right now, no heat, good complexity. I actually see time hurting this a bit more than benefiting. that and anytime a big brew has a enjoy by date on it that appears to be only about 6 months from its bottled on date, I would say drink it. they know what they are doing."
""
"I have to admit that I was surprised by this stout. The beer pour almost black with a nice head that eventually disappears. The smell immediately got my attention which was rich with depth. The taste had the attributes of a well crafted stout beer that left me wanting more. It is too bad this is a seasonal beer. This would make a good everyday beer to drink."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a very good example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style and I thought it was pretty easy drinking for a 9% RIS. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, rich, creamy, a little filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these without getting bored with it and I think it's very drinkable for the style. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything wrong or out of place with this beer. I would buy this beer again, I'm pretty sure I'll pick up another bottle and I might get one to put in the cellar, but I'm not sure this one will benefit much from aging since it's pretty smooth and tasty right now. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Russian Imperial Stouts. All in all I was happy with this beer, it was a straight up good RIS and it's up there as one of the better beers I've had from Great Lakes Brewing Company, it was smooth and it did a good job at holding my attention. Good job guys, this beer didn't disappoint, keep up the good work."

"I enjoyed this. It didn't feel like the usual punch of an Imp, but it was very delicious. Toasted malt was the overall theme, with coffee and chocolate in the background. The finish was quite dry. It left almost a slightly sour blackberry taste in your mouth. Actually, it's very much like that. I would probably get this again."
"This is really nice. It is insanely drinkable for a Russian Imperial stout. It has a wonderful, soft sweetness blended with a sublime chocolate toasted malt flavor, and just enough bitterness."

"O: A big roasty, english hop flavored, imperial stout that is good to sip whilst watching a B-movie or horror flick. The sweetness wasn't my thing but I did like the hop presence in this beer. I think with a little age this one could be up there with the best of them."
"Overall, another solid GL beer. There is an intentional complexity through the use of dark malts, fresh hops, and a hint of smokiness - well done!"
""
""
""
""
"Dark black color with a small light brown head that diminishes to just a ring while leaving a light oily lacing. Aroma has nice rich maltyness and cocoa notes. Flavor is smooth and rich with strong roasted cocoa, creamy chocolates, coffee notes, and a light bitterness. So delicious, complex and balanced all around."

"A wonderful version of an Imperial Russian Stout, one that would make any czar weep for joy."
""
""
"Pours predictably pretty dark black but does have a hint of ruby red with no head and a thin ring of lacing. Smells of milk chocolate, raisin, roasted coffee, dark bready malts, soy sauce, some pine. Taste starts with raisin, some dark chocolate, coffee. Then get more raisin, as well as plum, some pine, some breadiness. Then the finish includes, a little pine or grapefruit, roasted malt, some coffee, milk chocolate, little heat, some carmel, little soy sauce, maybe some licorice but I could just be imagining that. Pretty complex with a full body and a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation, but too much in my opinion. This is a very solid imperial stout that is on the verge of world class."

"The beer pours a very dark almost black color with several fingers of thick tan head. The head fades to a nice layer rather quickly and leaves some lacing on the side of the glass. I wasn't in love with the smell of this beer. I'm getting some sweet malt and dark fruit, but there is a slightly off note that I'm having trouble describing. Fortunately, the note that I didn't like in the smell didn't show up in the taste. While this was a very roasty beer, I thought the roast was quite smooth. I'm also getting dark chocolate and some dark fruit. The finish is sweet and roasty. The alcohol is quite well hidden. I'd have another bottle in the future."

"Overall- Great Lakes makes great beer and this one falls right in line. As this beer warms its vanilla flavor seems to become more prevalent. Almost reminiscent of a bourbon aged stout. This one will sneak up on you, tasting higher alcohol than 9% would suggest. This is a great RIS, one of the top tier out there. 4.25"

"A damn fine RIS with pronounced flavors and aroma. Highly recommended."
""
""

"Pours from the bottle with a deep brown, nearly black color, and is topped by a creamy, cream-colored head. The aroma is largely a dark, sweet combination of caramel and molasses sweetness, with some bittersweet chocolate. The flavor is a bit more complex, with characteristics of roasted, almost smoky malts, brown sugar, and some peppery, herbal hops, but there is also some lingering bitterness that seems almost metallic, and a noticeable hit of alcohol. The fine carbonation does a nice job of not masking this varied flavor profile, and the body isn't too heavy. Overall, this beer has a lot of what you'd expect from a solid imperial stout, but it doesn't have anything extra to make it exceptional."
"Hot damn, Great Lakes Brewing Company knows what they're doing. Nearly every brew I try by them, I am utterly impressed. They continue to deliver, brew after brew, style after style, and Blackout Stout is no exception. I wish this beer were a little easier to find."

"Recommended for a stronger RIS, it could use a bit more melding in the mouthfeel, but the brew is still quite nice and hits the spot on a very cold day.. Happy New Year."
"Overall: A nice and hoppy imperial stout that shows off multiple layers as it warms. A great winter beer. I would certainly pop one of these each weekend if it was available here."
"Moderately substantial pour; restrained tan head; deep, almost opaque translucent ruby-brown body. Balance of creaminess and carbonation approaches perfection in mouthfeel. The beer's aroma tends pleasantly toward chocolate. Its taste is an accomplished blend of malted grains, an edge of burnt toast, and a tempering hint of dark fruits. Little evidence of alcohol on the palate. Meritorious."

"Beer pours black with a big fluffy tan head - a much bigger head than your average imperial stout. Smell is fairly subdued, but has a combination of roast and caramel malts, chocolate, oats and a little sweet. The roast doesn't overwhelm in the nose and instead plays a complementary role with the other things going on here. The flavor here is REALLY nice. It's not your average hit-you-over-the-head big roasty stout and instead does something a little different. It's a little bit sweet, smooth and chocolate-y up front, but brings a nice amount of roast in the finish to balance it out. It's incredibly easy-drinking for such a big stout. Mouthfeel isn't super thick for a big stout, instead it's more medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is one of my favorite non-BA imperial stouts because it's not the same as all of the other big ones out there. It actually reminds me a lot of Hill Farmstead Everett, a porter, more than any other big stout I've had."

"O- Very very enjoyable. Highly recommend to anyone who has access to this beer"

"O - a good beer, but not an outstanding beer. Glad I got to try it, but for me it didn't quite live up to the hype."
""
"A nice stout here but in the competitive Imperial stout field there are better options."
"Pours a very dark motor oil brown capped with a one finger beige fluffy head. Moderate to little retention, no evident lacing. Bakers chocolate, espresso, hints of smoke and roasted malt. Dark chocolate initially, joined by hints of plum and roasted grain. Finishes dry with espresso notes, anise, some smoky, roastiness, very evident hop bitterness and phenol alcohol. Full bodied with moderate carbonation, slick and oily. A solid Russian imperial stout that will please most. Unique as the hop presence is more dominant in this brew than most others in the style, however it works. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"O: Decent drinkability. ABV is noticeable. Not one of my favorites for this style. A bummer since I like almost everything else this brewery does and thought I was really gonna like this. Can't judge a book by it's cover I guess and sometimes that goes in a negative way."
"O-Let this beer warm up to 55 f. as the label suggests. Delicious. I really like the mild sweetness they gave this beer. I find a lot of these imperial stouts are are a bit too bitter for my liking. Not to say that this wasnt bitter, but the sweetness made it all the more better by balancing things out. Nice work."
""
"O- This is up ther with STONE IRS and Narwhal in my opinion. A solid and very well done stout."
""
"This is a very good Imperial stout. It looks like this is a seasonal beer available in four packs, which isn't as good as year-round, but enjoying this beer during the winter months is something I can see myself doing. Too bad it's not distributed around here. If you find some near you, I recommend you pick some up."

"O: Not overly impressed with anything Great Lakes does, but this definitely doesn't hold true to that thought. Though I was disappointed with the initial pour appearance, everything after that led me to wanting more. As I mentioned earlier, the ABV is well hidden and this is surprisingly drinkable. Though there is different meaning behind it, the name could be used to describe the end of a night of having several of these for how easily they go down."

"I'm just going to start off by saying this is like a cross between a heavier Edmund Fitzgerald and a weaker Founders Breakfast Stout. The smell and taste are very similar between those two beers for me. Coffee on the nose, and I get more coffee and chocolate in the taste. Black in color that pours a dark tan head that dissipates quickly. Has a medium body and I get some bitterness about this which seems to come from cocoa. My general opinion is that this is okay. I was expecting more heaviness, and I don't think the taste separates itself enough from Edmund Fitzgerald for me to really care much for it. Founders Breakfast Stout is very similar to this beer but executed better in every way."

"This stout is a little more complex than a contract-brewed Guinness Extra, and has a little more burnt coffee taste. Otherwise, I would not rank this with the better imperial stouts I have tasted (i.e. Ten Fidy, or Narwhal, or Rasputin RIS or Bell's Expedition [IMO the best stout you can buy]). It is a decent brew, and priced reasonably, albeit in the middle of the pack. This would be a good ""beginners"" imperial stout...on the thin side, and not overwhelming. It can't touch the Bell's for complexity, however. That is good or bad depending upon ones tastes, obviously."

"I bought this beer for my friends on thanksgiving. I knew it was going to be a night of good food and needed a good beer. I bought it on a hunch that, a 9% abv stout would be noticed. A malty,creamy character I want from a stout, with the perfect amount of hops to accompany the flavour of the alcohol until the next drink. Great lakes is good. Sharing it with friends is great."
"Overall a superb non BA stout. Definitely prefer this one fresh as the flavors are intense and with no bourbon character it doesnt need to mellow out. Love it."

"Body is the heavier side of medium thickness, but the carbonation is adequate enough to keep things flowing in the mouth despite being heavy. Smooth and rich texture."
""

"A good stout, but overly sweet for my tastes, with an odd chemical sweetness that feels fake to me. I get a similar impression from it as I do from adulterated stouts like Southern Tier's Mokah and Jahva."

"A fine example of the Russian Imperial Stout. Textbook execution. Flavorful and complex without sacrificing drinkability. Wouldn't be too difficult to enjoy two in one sitting. Recommended."
"O: This beer is great, I can't wait to get my hands on the barrel aged version. I would recommend it to anyone...even though it's from Ohio!"
"O- Good. I do not have a fresh one to compare and see if age had done this one good. I can say that this one was enjoyable, but I would like to get my hands on a fresh one to compare."

"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a dark as night body with a 1""tan head that lays down quickly. The smell is of roasted malts and some cocoa and dark fruit notes. The taste is of roasted malt that leads into a nice coffee and chocolate taste. Then a little hop bitterness come through also. I think it is well balanced. The mouth feel is very smooth and well carbonated. I""m not a big fan or RIS but this one is defently one of the best i have had. Great job Great Lakes"
""
""
"Wow! This is a really good stout! Great flavors all around here! Really, really nice! When I poured this beer, I was thinking that the consistency and bit of a transparent blackish look would have it being a shitty beer...That was absolutely NOT the case. everything from the smell and especially the taste and mouhfeel was spot on. This a a very very drinkable, smooth, smooth stout. It ranks right up there with some of the bigger named stouts today, in addition, this stout is not massively heavy so you can drink numerous bottles!!! Wish I had more!!!"
"Medium bodied for the style, pretty much right down the center in terms of heft. Medium carbonation. I’m not sure why exactly but I was thinking this might be on the thinner side and thus a little disappointing in that regard but thankfully I was wrong and the mouthfeel is pretty nice after all. Very nice, I’d certainly buy this one again."
""
""
"O: This goes beyond hot, to where it's finishing like low-grade vodka. This could be enjoyable, but I'm cringing on every swallow. Not worth forcing myself to finish the bottle."
""
"Overall a great beer. Wish I had more of this, one of my favorite stouts now."

""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice RIS with solid drinkability. Very tasty and well-rounded, but certainly an everyday type big stout rather than a special occasion. Nothing terribly special or complex, but tasty nonetheless."
""
"O - Splendid beer, drank easy. I enjoyed the transformation of this beer as it warmed up. Seek this one out."
""
""
"Note: The menu listed this as ""Great Lakes Blackout Stout", but I have the sneaking suspicion that it may have actually been the barrel-aged variety based on the flavor and the other descriptions I've read. Guess I'll never really know for sure..."
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff, I wish Great Lakes' good stuff made it north of southern WI"
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy bodied with carbonation that foams this up slightly on the palate, creating at first a creamy, then smooth mouthfeel after the carbonation has faded. Finish is dry and satisfying. Slight ethanol burn in the post-sip, but acceptable and desirable in a beer this style."
""
""
"Thanks, Yeahnatenelson!"
"Feels warm, smooth and balanced. Not overhopped, at least when imbibed 3 weeks prior to its ""best before"" date. This one's been sitting in my fridge for about 2 months. Finally yanked it out with no regrets."
""
""
""
"O) Glad I snatched up a 4 pack of this delicious RIS. Stuck 2 in the cellar, but it will be difficult to resist the temptation to drink those. This is a fantastic brew that I highly recommend."
""
""
"O: Even as the beer warmed up and released more mid-palate flavor the finish was rather uneventful. This is a very solid stout and I would definitely like to try the BA version as I feel it would pack the finishing flavors I was lacking in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- great stout"
"O - A stolid RIS but there are a dozen others I'd go to first."
"O: a good imperial stout, overall, and a good bargain as well. On the sweeter side, but not too much so. Enjoyable and drinkable."
""
"Over this was really pleasant and easy to drink. I really liked this beer quite a lot and found the 9% ABV to be not be present at all. Considering how off of stouts I have been recently I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this which speaks volume for the quality of this brew. You can tell the recipe was crafted and tweaked numerous times to make the perfect balance which they have definitely achieved here. Looking forward to the 2010 BA version I have been saving after sampling this."
""
"A solid stout from Great Lakes, just disappointed in the feel, felt it was too thin and prickly for a 9% RIS."
""
""
"O-good with definite potential to be great, taste just doesn't quite come through as strong as it could be to make it great"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of my favorite beers from the brewery. An amped up Edmund Fitzgerald. Very drinkable."
""
""
"Pours nearly pitch black, with a tan finger of head. Aroma is big and rich with coffee, roasted notes and chocolate. Taste echo's the aroma nicely, though not quite as robustly. The feel is average and medium bodied. Good carbonation. Overall, great stout!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is descent but isnt one of my favorites by any means. I like the bitterness and the nose is nice but the taste is lacking in flavor. It was somewhat watery for me, I like big bold stouts and this isnt one of them."
""
""
"O - Easily one of my favorite Imperials. All the expected flavors from a strong stout came through without having to be a coffee or chocolate stout. One to try for sure!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Above-average carbonation for the style, but didn't take away from the brew at all. Overall a tasty offering."
"O: I wasn't too intrigued after the below par appearance and smell but the rest brought me back on board and I really enjoyed it. The 4 pack carrier I received with the trade tells me for freshest taste enjoy by this date so I'm curious to see how the other 3 will hold up in my cellar."
"Overall: a well balanced RIS that is slow sipping but extremely satisfying. A very enjoyable beer."
"There is the nice dark coffee, roasted taste with hints of toffee, the 9% which you can't tell is in there and the easy drinkability. One of my new favorites from Great Lakes."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this one. The alcohol is well hidden and that flavours are well balanced and smooth. The dark fruit flavour and low bitterness make this one of the better RIS's I've had to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: High five for pretty solid availability. I feel like I should try this fresh and aged yet even more."
"O: It's like woah. This is a supremely drinkable 9% big boy stout. This is easily one of my favorite stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body with some soft carbonation, slick and oily on the tongue. Probably aged bottle is smooth in flavor and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: I’ve had an older bottle of this that was best before 2008, which was far more boozy and abrasive than this bottling. The nose on this one was nice and the flavors worked well together. Unfortunately the look is simply far to thin and lack luster and the palate a little too average for top marks. Still, a good beer that I was glad to get another try at. Thanks again gents."
"O: Really a quality brew that I will definitely look forward to getting again in the future. Can't wait to get my hands on the BA version."
""
""
""
""
"It’s growing on me. A subtle, easy-drinking brew. Before I removed the wrapping to find out what brew this was, the subtlety and soft roast made me think some kind of dunkel or very subdued porter? To find out it was Great Lakes Blackout Stout — when I enjoyed the barrel-aged version SO MUCH — was very surprising. I like this enough, but it’s just so subdued it’s hard to believe this one is as popular as it is."
""
"O: might be a decent beer with correct carbonation."
"O: This beer is perfect, or very close to it, on so many levels. Interestingly, I wasn't terribly impressed with the barrel aged version (though it was very good as well). I just think the standard blackout is a better RIS than BA Blackout is a -bbl aged stout. Might have to re-visit that one again soon though."
""
""
"Overall: A solid take on the style. Nice and drinkable without ever crossing the line in to absurd or over-the-top. Great depth of flavor and the malts really shine."
"As this beer warmed up, the beer became sweeter and smoother. Hides the alcohol well. A very enjoyable experience - probably one of my top 10 RI stouts."
""
"O: An excellent stout with big bold flavors that meld together pleasantly with none overpowering the other."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the feel. This was extraordinary for the style, staying soft and silky, with a satisfying clean coating. The feel reminded us quite a bit of Founders Breakfast Stout, and the two are really second to none in this department. The only complaint is that it becomes pretty heavy and sticky by the end, but this is really just a great excuse to curl up in front of the fire and split a bottle with someone."
"O- very, very good, and affordable too. Can't get much better for an off the shelf RIS"
""
""
"This is a good example of an RIS. It's a bit mild, compared to some decidedly ridiculous beers of this style, but I like it. I am curious how it would age."
""
""
"Thanks to bpfrush for the killer extra!"
"I think some folks may rate this beer lower because they're used to the words ``Russian Imperial Stout'' being synonymous with ``extreme over-the-top liqueur-like beverage''. I like those beers as much as anyone, but if you're looking for a more modest, traditional, easy-to-drink RIS, look no further. This is definitely not an extreme beer and it is very porter-like, but the flavor of this stuff is hard to beat. It is very smooth and tasty. I will try to snap some more up next year."
""
""
"M/D - nice smooth creamy mouthfeel, there is a slight carbonation. Its medium bodied and very easy to drink. This is a nice stout that I could drink as a regular beer and enjoy it every time."
"Poured like a stout, if you can believe it: dark brown-black, with a frothy tan head that deposited some soapy lacing. Roasty character in the aroma, bitter notes of cocoa and coffee and a bit of ash. Flavors of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, tobacco ash, coffee bitterness. Heavier-medium mouthfeel, pretty smooth, and pretty drinkable overall."
""
""
""
"4/5 Mouthfeel is nice and thick as I would expect. Reallt hard to improve on this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown/black color with about a finger’s breadth of foamy beige head. Retention is decent, and a pillowy mass endlessly occupies the center of the glass. Minimal lacing clings to the glass. Aroma is of sugar, roasted malt, caramel, faint chocolate, and light grains. The nose seems to suggest a much lighter brew than the appearance would imply. It tastes of cane sugar, molasses, faint alcohol, caramel, and roasted malt. Not much else, but well balanced with the flavors that are present. Plenty of sugar, if that’s what you seek. Mouthfeel is thick, but lightened by the carbonation and almost milk-like texture. Overall, an interesting and enjoyable RIS. I'm certainly glad to have had the opportunity to try, and wouldn't turn one down in the future."
""
""
""
""
"O - With all the activity I see on the trade threads for BA Blackout, I'm surprised this wasn't a very big base stout. It has a nice 9% ABV but isn't very noticeable, and it's not entirely complex. Frail body with not a lot going on flavor-wise and almost nothing on the nose. Still worth a try and I'm actually more intrigued about the barrel-aged version."
""
""
"Surprised Great Lakes made this one. Maybe I will try some of their other beers. Didn't expect it to be this good...."

"The reveal: Great Lakes Brewing Co Black Out Stout. Great beer to pop my cherry on! I'm surprised I didn't pick up more on the hops as they proudly boast about them on the label."
""
"O: A great beer and very drinkable. On the sweeter side, but not to its detriment. I will drink this again."
"O: excellent, if not up to world class renditions such as Founders Breakfast Stout."
""
""
"O- A good stout that is easily drinkable, with the high ABV being hidden well. I like my RIS's with a little more richness, but still one that is worth trying."
""
"O - I'll have to try it again, I didn't get much of the complexity I read in other reviews, just unbalanced bitter roast and smokiness."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle; pours near black with a decent tan head with a somewhat rigorous pour. Head dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas of anise, burnt sugar, roasted malt, and some alcohol hit the nose. Flavors are well balanced with more burnt sugar notes, anise, molasses & brown sugar with a nice hop profile. At 9% alcohol is fairly well concealed. It still ends up being a little boozy as expected, but its balance once again keeps everything in check. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. As this warms, I am realizing this is a treat to come back to - I haven't had this one in over 3 years, but it just might be a regular winter pickup from now on. Overall, great example of the style and definitely recommendable!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is as noted well attenuated and clean and dry."

""
""
"Fun to drink after all this time of NEVER seeing it around. Above average impy stout, recommended. Thanks kawilliams81!"
""
"D and O: Very enjoyable. This is my first and only bottle. I will have to seek this out in the future. I felt it was very easy drinking, really well rounded, and overall enjoyable. Another really nice beer from GLBC."
""
"O: Another wonderful GLBC brew!"
""
"o: while not a top echelon RIS, certainly respectable. nicely balanced. another nice showing from Great Lakes"
""
"O - A nice smooth stout, excited for the BA version."
""
""
""
"D - It's fine. Nothing out of the ordinary, and I'm not very sure that this would hold up well with age. I do commend the absence of alcohol anywhere in the nose or drink."
""
""
"I really like this more than I thought I would. The mix of smokey malts, a muted sweetness, and the hops, that are more citrus than bite is balanced perfectly. If you're a fan of grapefruity notes in darker brew, this rates with the tops of the segment. I wish it weren't so hard to get. I'd drink it all winter. Plus, I can only guess how good this year's class of the BBA aged version will be. Shit, another hard ass beer to get."
""
"The nose is very rich and roasty with lots of smoke, burnt toast, cardboard. Dark black pour. Thick tan head. The lace coats the glass beautifully. Where the smoke took top tier in the aroma, it simmers down in the flavor, thankfully. Milk chocolate, roasted coffee, ghost-like smoke on the finish. Woodsy character in this one as well. Can't place it. Very rich beer. I liked it."
""
"O-a nice layered flavor beer that is rich and creamy and has fantastic flavor. Highly recommend"
"I count on Great Lakes for rock solid beers and not necessarily more, but this one is way above rock solid and in rarified are. Love the sweet. I might not necessarily recommend you risk your life to get this one. But you should definitely risk the integrity of your crappy rental car."
""
"O - Overall a very very good beer. A lot of flavors going together well, with an aroma to match. That said, the booze is a bit too pronounced. Good thing I got a four-pack, this'll be awesome in a year!"
""
"O: I'd say this is one of the best examples of this style I've had, sweet, nice roast, not overly burnt or boozy. Another GL triumph...."
"Pour is the same. Smell is totally different. Powdered milk and dark chocolate dominate the nose. Hints of roasted malt and coffee can be found. Slightly sweet. Very full body, very creamy and smooth. Mouthfeel is amazing and perfect. Hints of toffee, caramel, and candied sugars. Odd for an RIS. Hops are non-existent. The grains are buried under layers of complexity. All the above flavors. God bless Great Lakes, I love you."
""
"O: very solid beer, this one. I waited a long time to find one of these, and today I finally got a single for $2.50 or so. Worth the price - imagine Great Lakes selling a bomber for only $5. Very drinkable - I want another."
""
"Mouthfeel: It is thick and heavy just like a stout should be but it is very easy to drink which makes for a delicious beer that can be enjoyed by a couple glasses."
""
"Odd sweetness for the style with minimal roast, but it isn't terrible. A not very authentic take on the style but an okay offering none the less, worth trying. And cheap."
""
"Overall: A fantastic RIS. Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- yes. Buy this beer. If you like a nice think drinkable potient stout it is worth your bottom dollar."
"O - For a 9%, this beer is pretty easy drinking. A little bit filling. Distinguishes itself as more of a dark, burnt roast RIS. I don't feel like hopping was cleanly brought through. I want to find it in the middle, but it just seems like it gets eaten by the roast."
""
""
"O- This beer is damn good. Borderline great to be honest, I might need to go buy more."
"D- Overall this is a solid well done RIS and what I have come to expect in the style. Well done and classic example."
"Overall: Solid offering; nothing fancy. Nice drinkable and flavorful Russian Imperial Stout. This is mt favorite dark beer from great lakes. I think its better than Eddy Fitz porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I didn't really like this for the style it is in. I would seek out others. Brooklyn Chocolate stout beats this by miles in my opinion."
""
""
"Body is too thin and weak, but well carbonated. Another above average off-the-shelf imperial stout from the midwest!"
"Really tasty and enjoyable beer. The aging on this has mellowed any harshness and brought the flavor together quite well. A very well crafted and highly drinkable imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I really enjoyed this! Really nice complex flavors and balance, prefer this in the 50-ish temp range, booziness begins to assert as it warms, highly recommend."
""
""
""
"O - All in all, this is a solid beer. A solid roast forward, mostly balanced, milk chocolate-goodness stout. And not a hint of booze at 9%, well done."
""
""
"O- Very good. First time having this beer and really solid imperial stout. Perfect balance of coffee, roast, sweet, and bitterness."
""
"O- It's a 9% beer that has the booziness of an 11 or 12%. If they reeled that in, it would be a great beer."
""
""
""
"Overall – A quite good Russian Imperial Stout. Rather similar to a milk stout if I do say so myself. The alcohol is hidden quite well and is very quaffable."
"Overall, this is a pretty good stout but i wish there was more to it. It was pretty hot but tasty nonetheless. I bet that a year or two would bring out some more qualities out of this brew."
""
""
""
""
"It has a dark black appearance to it, about a fingers worth of mocha-colored head that holds retention nicely, and leaves sticky lacing down the glass. A real looker. Smell is where I was let down. It was really lacking a particular scent. It almost reminds me of a belgian dark ale yeast scent. There are also minimal traces of smoke. The taste is what redeemed the lack of scent for me. I'm getting nice toasted flavors, smoked malt, roasted barley, coffee, and chocolate. It's a really nice combo. There is a medium mouthfeel not too viscous or thick. Overall I really enjoyed this."
"Overall (4.0): This is a really enjoyable RIS; it’s not perfect in some ways, but ultimately it’s very tasty and worth picking up in the season. I could see the barrel-aged versions of this being rather nice, I’d love to see this in rye barrels to had some spice or a peaty scotch to add some other dimension of depth. Quite good but not excellent, I’d recommend it but it’s not going into my list of most memorable beers."
"O: Excellent RIS especially given the price point and availability. Too bad they don't distribute out here!"
""
""
""
""
"A really good stout, another one that I am going to wish was more available."
""
""
""
"O - Although Great Lakes is one of the best, I was surprisingly turned off by this offering. Perhaps it was due to the Belgian xms brews I had prior to this one but still... I even stopped drinking after this one. Sorry :/ I wanted to like it..."
""
""
""
"O: Although a very good offering, I was expecting a stout with more body. But the flavors were there, and I would absolutely have again. Skal."
"I see this as more of a traditional RIS. Is not over hopped, overwhelmingly sweet, or overly boozey. But it also fails to really excite me in this ""bigger is better"" competitive style. But that is what BA Blackout Stout is for."
""
""
""
""
"o: Love this stout, not trying to be Dark Lord or Abyss, falls into a wonderful category of it's own. Enjoy!"
""
"T -"
"A top-notch stout. Just wish the barrel-aged version was more readily available ... I'd pay the premium without hesitation."
""
"big thanks to beerhan for hooking me up with a four pack of this awesome brew! poured this into a tulip and it looks amazing. three finger mocha colored head sits atop a pitch black body. the head slowly recedes to just a sea foam cap, but loads of sticky lacing decorate the sides of the glass. smells of smoke at first, then the chocolate bitterness comes thru with a roasted malt presence. the taste is opposite of how it smelled. with the chocolate up front and a slight smoke finish to it. mouthfeel is a little thinner than what i expected while i watched this get poured. still a good feel to it with great carbonation and a slight alochol burn on the finish. overall i would say this is one of the best non-barrel aged stouts out there. if great lakes makes a bad beer i haven't found it yet. seek it out!"
"Taste: There's an inimitable sweetness here, while not overpowering is part of the symphony of coffee, chocolate, alcohol and smoke, This is a BIG, heavy Winter Evening Sipper with deep, rich powerful flavors. I have had the Barrel aged version of this on tap and that is an uber powerful beer. This version from the bottle is plenty all on it's own, a substantial heavyweight and unlike some American made Imperial Stouts that I have had, the sweetness is held back and not allowed to romp over the flavor profile. This is really good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"

"O - Really solid RIS. I wouldn't buy it by the case, but I look forward to a 4-pack each year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"[92/100]"
""
"O- a tasty stout, but it does not compare to other Great Lakes offerings in relation to other beers from their respective styles. Even with that being said, it is still a solid beer that I would buy again."
""
"O/D - Quality stout. Seems to be a bit of a mishmash, but tasty and really drinkable."
""
""
"A sweet dessert stout. Quite lovely."
"O: There are parts of this beer that could use a bit of touching up. But where it really counts is in the flavor profile, and this beer has it in spades. One of the better non-BA RIS's I've had of recent. Well worth seeking out. I'm stoked I've got more in the cellar."
"Overall: Another great brew from Great Lakes. Very nice flavors of chocolate and dark fruits."
""
""
""
""
"Value is rarely mentioned on this website and I truly wish other reviewers would include this when making a review."
"This is a very deep brown beer with reddish fringes. The sand colored head quickly recedes leaving just a thin ring of tiny bubbles. The beer smells richly chocolatey with a little raisin fruitiness. Blackout has slight coffee bitterness at first, then a malty sweetness comes through before the dark cocoa finish. The mouth feel is very smooth, but a little bit thin. Overall, very good, well balanced stout with just enough sweetness that I like"
""
"Bitter coffee and chocolate notes up front, then plumb, raisin and grape can be detected void of sweetness. Finishes with a lingering hop bitterness in the background. Lots of flavor here - a very solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I certainly understand now why this is not considered an Imperial Stout to age - even Great Lakes seems to discourage it with their best by date of 05/05/12 (just six months from bottling). However, that is not really a negative, because this drinks so obscenely well right now."
""
"Mouthfeel is thick. Nice level of carbonation for a Russian Imperial Stout. Overall, a strong, solid, delicious RIS. Big, bold flavors. A nice sipper on a cool night."
"O - a great RIS. It hits the mark on all fronts. It's bursting full of flavor when you let it warm up a bit. Lots of character with this one. A super stout from a world class brewery. Look forward to this brew each year it's released."
"Notes: Full body, complex flavor and incredible balance make this a very drinkable imperial stout. One of the creamiest mouthfeels I have ever experienced in a beer this big. This stuff is awesome!"
""
"Poured on tap into tall snifter glass then again enjoyed from 12oz bottle into pint glass. The appearance is true to the style, deep black, tan head. The aroma is bitter chocolate, roasty, molasses. The flavor is chocolate (more than implied by the aroma), brown sugar and molasses, much sweeter than expected. Some roasty notes in there as well. The finish is roasty, and lingering resiny bitterness. The beer has a nice thick body, full, and creamy mouthfeel. Excellent Great Lakes offering and one that I will seek out every season!"
""
"O - very delicious beer, but also very filling I could enjoy one quite highly, but I wouldn't want more than that in a night"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is fantastic. The smell and taste are both incredible and rich and right in line. My only complaint is that it feels overcarbonated, which distracts from everything else a little bit."

"Medium bodied with average carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden for 9.0 % abv. Bittersweet aftertaste. Nicely balanced. The bottle states to please enjoy by 05/05/12, but I think this should age nicely."

"Overall: A decent coffee beer. Smooth, drinkability is good."
""
"D/O - Drinkability is high. Definitely well worth the wait, and I can argue that a beer of this magnitude is better suited to be released during the winter months anyway. There is no lack of flavor here and the finish is long enough to warrant this being a sipper, even if I can't help myself from drinking."
"D- what can I say about great lakes Russian imperial...? This stuff is so fresh and full of flavor. Let it warm up and the flavors blast out of the glass. On record, one of the most drinkable and best RIS's I have ever had"

"Dark, black coffe with a creamy khaki head that shrinks to a skim, and leaves some sticky lace on the glass. Cocoa, chocolate syrup and mild anise in the aroma. Rich, roasty and delicious with flavors of molten fudge, anise and a charred bitterness, alcohol is well hidden. Silky smooth and full-bodied. A tasty beer that has been unavailable in my market for 6 or so years (thanks WCB). I wish more brewers would release an affordable RIS."
"It's a decent looking stout, got some nice complexity with the aromas and flavors. It's on the sweet side but still tasty."

"O: An incredible stout. I really wish it wasn't a seasonal. In fact, this is probably my favorite stout/porter that I've tired (in an admittedly small sample size). I'll be heading to the store tomorrow to buy another two or three four packs!"
"O: Overall this is a very good beer but I think it needs some time for the hops to settle down. I have a few more so it will be interesting to see how it develops. 4.0"
"Overall: Great Lakes never fails to impress. This is a great stout that is not too heavy. It has a ""clean"" taste which I really like"
"O. Very good Imperial stout. Not a coffee or chocolate bomb, on the hoppier side and a dangerously drinkable 9%."
"Overall I thought after the smell that this was going to be disappointing. I was a little concerned because this is from such a great brewery I respect. After one taste though, they still delivered and I am digging this probably even more cause I figured it wasn't going to be that great. Great beer, I will drink this anytime."
"O: Blackout Stout is a great beer. All of the standard flavors are mastered with the hop and dark fruit presence adding an unexpected treat. It shades on the drier side and I fear the prevalence of BA RIS's these days may lead some to view this beer as thin, but that would be a huge mistake. Blackout Stout is a wonderful achievement. Great great great job to the GL Brewery."
"Solid RIS!"
"O: A solid stout and the minty creaminess of the brew completely hides the 9% ABV. Drinkability is extremely high; you could easily pound 3 or 4 of these in succession if you were so inclined. The only thing holding this back from a really solid A or A+ is the Northern Brewer hops (which definitely do their job of hiding the ABV, by the way). I just prefer a bit less mint in my stouts, that's all."
"Definitely worth and try and comes highly recommended. If you are someone that enjoys stouts, then you absolutely must try this stout."
"Overall - Ive had this beer many times before but its never been this flavorful, balanced and alcohol masked so well. Last few years releases were strong, alcohol was present in each drink. With the 2011 version, much more malt and coffee presence, and i hardly get much alcohol in each drink. This is a insanely smooth and drinkiable beer. I liked it before, but now great lakes tweeked there recipe and quite simply made one of the best stouts out there, get this one for sure."
"O- A very drinkable RIS. The mouthfeel on this beer is what you want out of a big stout. Very flavorful and on the sweeter side for a RIS."
"Cost: $12.99 for a four pack."
"O: This is a good beer when it is fresh, but it's amazing when it has a year on it. I plan on buying a case this year, and every year after."
"This is the perfect time of year for a nice heavy full bodied stout. The carbonation helps propel this one over the tongue and down the throat. Dark fruit and roasted nut make up the aftertaste that sticks around with this beer."
"Overall - I wasn't too impressed with just the smell and appearance, but it actually did a great job with taste and mouthfeel. Very smooth blend of bitter and sweet. GL has brewed a quality RIS here."
"O Really nice beer all around. hits everything i like nicely. I want some more."
"O - a fine beer, for sure. Another great one from Great Lakes."
"O: A nice beer. The level of molasses caught me off guard, but I liked it, especially mixed with the chocolate flavors."
"O: Overall this a solid RIS- while it warms more flavors come to the front - slightly sweet - well balanced and blended stout that will become a regular in my fridge when it gets released."
"Overall: A tasty stout - especially if you lean towards the sweeter side of the stout family. A surprising flavor profile compared to most other imperial stouts with only subtle hints of the typical roasted malt bitterness you find in most imperial stouts these days."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Quite drinkable for a 9% ABV. A delicious, smooth and oaky stout."
"D – This beer really surprised me. I was expecting a boozy RIS, but what I got was a very smooth, and well balanced beer. I had to force myself to sip it rather than chug it. Very drinkable and with this high an ABV, very dangerous. I will definitely seek this out again."
"O - The initial taste was pretty good, but the heat got to me so much I could only finish about half of the 12 oz bottle. A pretty good beer, but too hard for me to drink."
"Overall: This beer blew me away immediately. Easily one of the more immediately accessible beers for this style. Might not have as intense character as others in this style, but overall an extremely pleasurable beer."
"Big thanks goes out to Lunch for sending me this one in a past trade as an extra! Bottled on 08/02/10! Served from bottle into Surly Darkness snifter. Poured pitch black with a one finger tan that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I had a feeling this was going to be good as I've had the barrel aged version quite a few times now and had never had the base beer (funny how that works out huh?). A very smooth brew with some nicely balanced flavors to keep you coming back for more. The aroma was quite pleasant as well. A definite must try rather it is barrel aged or not."
"Edit: This is a good beer, I fear it may be better at the six monthish mark. I would like to try a fresh bottle, as I've only had expired and aged. Good beer still."
"Creamy and full robust feel on this one. Overall this is a no nonsense RIS. A really enjoyable well made beer."
"This brew poured out as a black rich looking liquid. The head was creamy and brown in color. The lacing looked good on the glass. The smell of the beer was roasted with some coffee and chocolate on the nose. I slight amount of dark fruit in there too with some booze. The taste of the beer had a good strength to it, lots of chocolate upfront and bad a burnt toast flavor in the back end. The flavor wasn't as strong as some of the Russian Imperials out there. The mouthfeel was thick and full bodied. Overall I found this beer to be damn good and would enjoy having it again one day."
" The taste has lush malt layers with creamy caramel interwoven with chocolate malt roastiness and slight smooth with low bitterness and semi-sweet almost dessert-like with a coffee/cocoa and caramel blend of malt qualities as it finishes with mostly dry and mild alcohol flavor with low harshness and some raisin-like sweet flavors. Overall this is a wonderful stout with lots to like but finishes a bit sweet -not as drinkable as I remember but still worthy and one I recommend as a great example of the style."
"Very drinkable, but not sessionable for someone who wants their liver to last."
"O - Pretty damn good RIS. Not as sweet as most RIS's which is nice. This evidently wast before it's prime according to the brewery but I enjoyed it all the same. Will seek out a fresh one next time."
"A good beer throughout. It wouldn't supplant my favorites, but the aroma is very enjoyable."
"Taste balances sweetness with some toast and roast pretty well and has a pleasant fruity yeast presence. Not as well integrated as I had hoped after spending some time in the cellar. I'd like to try it fresh to see if I like it more. After having a few other stellar GL beers, I am a bit let down by this one. Mouthfeel is not overly full and the whole package just doesnt quite come together perfectly for me."
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer coats your mouth well but does not get too sticky. While not exactly creamy, the great carbonation cerainly helps the drinkability considerably."
"Overall: Great Lakes is an awesome brewery and this was an awesome beer! A real shame I can not get them here in AZ"
" Not a ton of layering but definitely pleasant overall and with interesting balance. The palate feels a bit over-carbonated to be, but that may be the hops in stout which I’m just not use to. It is slightly thinner than I would look for in a serious RIS too, but still is pleasant overall on the palate. The alcohol is noticeable but not out of balance."
"Coffee bitterness comes through on the palate and takes over a little compared to the toffee i found on the nose. Even though i loved the overwhelming toffee, i also enjoy how its sharing the front seat now. This is almost the definition of a ""chewy"" beer to me, at the right temperature, it literally just takes over my mouth with a chewy texture. The bitterness on the finish is just enough to make its presence known, i like how its on the mellower side. I will definitely he hunting down more of this to both try fresh, and throw in the cellar to try at different intervals. Very nice brew."
"Thanks ritzkiss."
"This beer pours a great motor oil color, has a thick, dark tan head and leaves good lacing around the glass. I caught strong smells of chocolate and roasted malt. The smell was great, but the taste blew me away. Great sweet chocolate taste with a bitter finish. I loved the mixture of hops and chocolate. It was a perfect balance. The carbonation was on point and the beer was a perfect thickness for a RIS. This was the best RIS I have had to date. Love everything about it. Unfortunately I have never seen bottles of this around the area, but next year I will definitely be on the look out. Great job Great Lakes!"
"One of my favorite RIS, this brew is even better on tap than it is from the bottle. If you can get it on tap, you should, now!"
"I had no problem finishing this growler off in record time... Enjoyed every sip as well.."
"d- nice, i'm enjoying this one alot, it's a nice sipper that i've been nursing for nearly an hour not getting sick of it, it's nowhere near an everyday drinker for me, but it's nice and i would definitely drink it again. really liked the masking of alcohol on this bad boy."
"O-A very good imperial stout, worth seeking out."
"Cheers..."
"My new favorite from Great Lakes.."
"D-A pretty nice RIS, but the alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming to the palate."
"Overall an excellent beer that I can't wait to get the BA version."
"Yum."
"Drink- This took some will power to not just slam the bottle. Was quite good, creamy, chocolatey and very palatable overall."
"D: This is not one of those ""drink 5 of"" beers, this is a delicate, delicious, stand-alone (mostly) stout. Would be perfect as an after dinner dessert, or paired with a desert"
"The taste is delicious. It hits the top of my tongue and coats the inside of my mouth with dark roasty stoutness. The carbonation is more than I expected. Coffee is also very prevalent in the taste. I also taste a little licorice. This is very drinkable for a Russian Imperial Stout, I will drink at least another glass before the night is out."
"D - A worthy imperial stout - not overly complex, but certainly merits a revisit. I wish I'd held on to another bottle or two, because further aging could improve this even more."
"T/M/D - This thing is roasty as hell, in a good way. The chocolate and coffee taste like they were fused in a wood burning fireplace. This gives it a heavy mouthfeel and a lingering aftertaste. I picked up some tobacco and licorice on the back palate. A great winter sipper."
"Fantastic beer, the barrel aged version I'm sure is outstanding."
"This beer was poured from a growler, courtesy of my good friend Matt (MTC1287). It poured the blackest of blacks with a one finger dark khaki head. It looked great. This brew smells of deep roasted dark malts with a great amount of fresh coffee beans. I feel the caffeine going through my nostrils. The flavor is very heavy on the coffee and deep roasted notes. This beer is heavy! It tastes like my French roast coffee every morning. If only I could switch them out. It's superb. Mad props to Matt for the growler. It's full bodied and drinks with a lot of carbonation and is very crisp. This beer is very drinkable for the content and is an exceptional RIS. I feel I'd rate it even higher with age. Great beer by Great Lakes!"
"D: I really enjoyed this one, but due to the intense flavors and ABV its a one-er."
"Drinkability: At this point there is a ton of coffee dominating the flavor, which is a good thing for me. There are more complex Imperial Stouts out there, but this is like sweet coffee candy."
"Overall impression: Pretty good stuff here. I'm looking forward to the barrel-aged version I've got queued up in the beer fridge."
"A good non special release RIS."
"Chewy full body that is roasty and smokey but not as much as the aroma suggests with lots of luscious, silky chocolate/mocha flavor. Pretty roasty up front and slightly acrid with hints of bitter dark chocolate, smoke, burnt toast and coffee bean but this is countered mid-palate by a lactic cream and sweeter malt flavor. Hints of chocolate, hazelnut, coffee, caramel, oatmeal and toffee. There is also an earthy, bitter hop presence that lingers throughout into a long dry finish. The ABV is very well masked but it is a bit too bitter/acrid/burnt tasting for my liking."
"The CPJ"
"Overall, I really don't know what to think about Blackout Stout. Its good, but it just doesn't jump out to me. The nose is great, but this whole be can be much more dynamic."
"Drinkability: Pretty good! Not 100%, but definitely worth trying and keeping around."
"D: I wasn't that impressed with this. It's good, but not great. I'm not loving the mouthfeel or aftertaste."
"D: Very drinkable and enjoyable; while I'm not rushing back to take sip after sip like I am with my very favorite beers, I fully enjoyed my glass and could easily have had another."
"D - Great lakes rarely disappoints and this is no exception. Fantastic beer and I only wish it was more widely distributed."
"D: Awesome. Well done Cleveland."
"D: Might be one of the roastier stouts I've had. Wish this was a little more balanced. Worth a try though"
"Quite a nice drinkable RIS. Not exactly what I look for usually, but would definitely try and get more. Could be a little chewier for me, but otherwise quite nice."
"Fuller body, medium carbonation, smooth and creamy with a little lingering chewyness in the feel. A really nice sipper of a RIS, great flavor and the alcohol is masked well."
"A major thank you to Damico for a bottle of this delicious RIS. Pours a black color with a caramel colored head. Aroma of roasted malt and chocolate, with hints of grapefruit. Sweet start, then roasty maltiness to the bitters. Bitters are at the perfect level. As the bitters fade, a velvety chocolate finish carries you home. What makes this beer special is the roasty flavor that hits in the middle and lingers through the finish. It gives the beer another level. Very nicely done."
"D: Goes down easily, nice kick, very good representation of style. I've had this one in bottle before but on tap is even better. I really wish Great Lakes was distributed this way!"
"D - Big fan. Good stuff. Worthy of its notoriety."
"Tasted sweet and a slightly fruity up front, alcohol heat in the middle wrapped around a prominent coffee/dark chocolate flavor, and a slight bitterness at the end. Felt thick and rich, robust, not too chewy, well carbonated. This is a nice regional (to me, anyway) representation of the style."
"Damn I would really like to try the barrel aged version of this brew."
"D - Man I kind of liked this more than the founder Imperial but never more than the breakfast stout. Still a nice addition to one of my favorite imperial stouts. Well done Great Lakes!"
"D - really tasty and decently easy to drink, but there is a tiny bit of heat to it, so a year on the cellar might be exactly what this brew needs."
"D - This RIS is very good I enjoyed it throughly yet I have others that are easier to come by that I would rank higher than this. Still good and with an ABV that isn't too crazy."
"Pretty amazing stuff. I'm glad I have a few for those cold winter PA nights coming down the pipeline."
"Pours black and opaque with a milk chocolate looking head that sticks around. Lots of lacing in the glass as this one goes down. Aroma is coffee and chocolate with slight citrusy hops in the background. The taste is huge. Chocolate is dominant than coffee. There is some slight licorice in the background and citrusy hop flavor. No noticeable molasses or dark fruit. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. I can't believe this is a 9% abv beer. Drinkability is also very good for a 9% beer. Carbonation is appropriate and the mouthfeel is luxuriously rich. I'm not a huge fan of RIS and usually prefer barleywines during the cold winter months, but this is a well made beer that I will seek out this winter."
"D: A good RIS however high ABV and strong alcohol presence make this beer a one and done for me."
"d: it's hard to talk about a Russian Imperial Stout as ""drinkable", but this rates pretty well in terms of enjoyability; excellent as a dessert, and a much better alternative to chocolate mousse; I'll probably reach for Edmund Fitzgerald (from Great Lakes) or Victory Storm King (in the RIS category) more often, but this is a decadent, delicious offering from a solid brewery"
"Creamy, a lot of chocolate malts in the front but not as heavy or thick as Russian Imperials. Good well balanced with the malt and alcohol content. Just a little watery good if you're looking to drink a couple of glasses of RIS but when you are having just one might not be my first choice."
"Another gift from the midwest connection, thanks for the 4 pack. Poured into a snifter after letting it warm up for a few minutes. It pours jet black with an incredible chocolate head. The beer smells of incredible roasted malts, powerful aroma. Has an incrediblely toasted taste, lot of malt, chocolate, coffee flavors all around with a sweet aftertaste. Incredible stout."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Nice chocolaty flavor and balanced between sweet and bitter. On the lighter side for a RIS, but still a treat to drink. That being said, I'd still grab an Old Rasputin over this. Worth trying, fairly tasty, but not great. I'm still intrigued to try the barrel aged version, but I'm a little skeptical since the body is already somewhat thin for the style."
"Overall this beer is great for a stronger stout, but a little weaker than what I look for in an RIS. Still, it's a nice one to throw back."
"D: Highly drinkable RIS. Not as rich as others but easily consumed."
"D- Would be higher if not for that heavy alcohol presence. I had a bottle before this one, the day it expired on 08/30, and I remember the alcohol being practically absent, even dangerously so, so a lot of my problems with this beer are, I think, due to the expiration date. For that reason I am elevating my scores a little bit and will probably change it once I get a fresh batch."
"Very dark brown pour that lets just a hint of light through with a big, loose tan head. Aroma of cocoa powder, dark fruit, booze and day old coffee. More cocoa in the flavor along with some hints of toffee, raisins, rum, butterscotch, alcohol and stale coffee. The body is oily and too thin for an imperial. It's over carbonated as well. It's not offensive or bad but it just falls short on every point I want in a good impy."
"this is a fantastic stout and very drinkable. almost dangerously so. even still, one or 2 of these and you're likely done. i bought this on a whim and i'm definitely going back for more."
"I would drink it again. I would suggest it for my buddies to enjoy. However, there are quite a few other beers I would share before this one."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is chocolate and roasted malt. Pretty straightforward, but very inviting. The flavor is roasted malt, alcohol, chocolate and some bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice, and I am glad I have another bottle of this to try."
"It finishes with lots of the malts still lingering for a while. As it coats the mouth, most of the flavors just linger. Some of the roast and black patent malt remain, but a lot less now. More bitterness though as the hops and roasted malts catch up finally. Some sweetness, but dries a bit too. More of the caramel, vanilla, and rich malty flavors linger, with more of the pillowy nougat and a little chocolate. No real boozy taste either."
"D: The alcohol burn might push some people away, but overall this is very drinkable."
"Drinkability: When I first had this beer when I lived in Cleveland I wasn't a huge fan. Now with my palate changing and gaining an appreciate of the RIS style, this is a fabulous beer. I can't wait until this comes out again."
"D. Not terribly complex or full bodied which is what I tend to look for in a RIS, but a very drinkable beer (as opposed to a more sippable RIS). I'd love to try the BA version of this since the bourbon should shine through nicely."
"It's a fairly straightforward beer for style. Thin, but pretty full of flavor."
"A really solid RIS for being so easy to find. This is one like Rasputin that would be rated higher if released seasonaly or with a smaller distribution."
"D: Really pleasant and easy to drink. I really liked this beer quite a lot and found the 9% ABV to be not be present at all."
"d=Though the rich, hoppy complexity is what I would normally want from this style, the alcohol content seemed a bit much, even at only 9% abv. I thoroughly enjoyed sipping a pint, but would not have more than one in an evening and couldn't drink it down fast. A nice one to savor."
"This one pours a deep, rich black color, with a light to medium brown cap on top. Huge aromas leap from the glass--cocoa powder, freshly brewed coffee, roasted malt and a little cream. The nose on this one is perfect. On the palate, I get more of the same, along with some hops, which I did not expect. A very good beer, one which I wish I could get more often."
"D - The alcohol really comes out in this one, but I'm not quite sure why. The bitterness is also a bit much to make it a super drinkable beer, but still a solid brew nonetheless."
"I think I appreciate the hoppy stouts more today, but still I can't say this is an above average representation of this style. I like this beer a good bit now, but I'm a fan of RIS's so as with many styles I enjoy, average is a good thing!"
"I poured into a pint glass to a thin brown head. This brew is pretty much black in color. The smell is some wonderful chocolate and coffee aromas from the roasted malt. My initial taste is some rich coffee flavors. There is also chocolate and other roasty goodness in there. This beer has a nice creamy texture to it. The drinkability is amazing. Call me a homer, but I love this beer and Siberian Night, both made in Ohio."
"What an even-keeled, solid representation of the style. I love that about Great Lakes; they make steadfast examples of the style without a tendency toward flashiness. This beer is no different. I've been drinking this off & on since this batch was released. I still find drinkability to be great (with the exception of one particular night at the Thirsty Ear). Easily recommended."
"A special thanks to gingermanstv for trading this at the CdC release. Pitch black fluffy sand colored head poured room temperature into a mikasa widemouth beer glass great head retention with some nice bits of amorphous lacing as the beer goes away. It smells of coffee and raisins predominantly with bittersweet chocolate and cinnamon undertones. the mouthfeel is smooth but a bit too watery. the taste is huge, big notes of dark chocolate with some roasted malt in the back some light coffee present as well. Its a bit too heavy to be that drinkable however, the alcohol is very well hidden."
"Overall: One of the best RISs available in the DC area!"
"Ok down to my last bottle of 2010, it's been almost a year and time for an update. Sorry to say that the original scores stands."
"Pours a deep black with a nice mocha head and a bit of lacing as it goes down. Initial nose is plenty of roasted malt followed up by dark chocolate, caramel/toffee, and hints of molasses. Taste is nice. Some sweetness is added in, which dilutes some of the nuances of the nose. Mouthfeel is nice, thick, and chewy. Very drinkable. A very solid stout for how widely available it is."
"Unbelievably easy to drink, as it lacks the evident alcohol and the lack of balance that can be common with the style. A beautiful piece of work from a great brewery."
"Overall I still prefer this beer fresh, but it does age well, depending on what you're looking for in a big stout such as this."
"Pours a jet black with a light tan head. Smell is very nutty with some dark fruits and hints of cocoa. It also has a very earthy and roasty tone. Upon first sip I get a pretty big hit of bitter hops followed by bitter coffee. Chocolate does not come through very hard. Great if you like a very hoppy and bitter RIS. Packed with a chewy mouthfeel with a twinge of alcohol burn. Not really what I look for in a stout but it is good stuff."
"Very drinkable, not huge in body and not at all filling. You almost don't want a 9% RIS to be this drinkable."
"Could Definitely Take Down A Few of These, Easy"
"D: Extraordinarily drinkable. The combination of the sweet choco-molasses and the roasted malt and bittering hops make this a smooth drinker that I will seek out again in the future."
"Drinkability - Drinks really easy, hard to notice the alcohol, I think I could go through a six pack before realizing the strength and the cost of said pack. Good complex flavors make this a top three Imperial Stout for me. Based on this Imperial, I need to make a trip to Great Lakes Brewery!"
"Overall: I don't know much what to make of this beer. It looks and tastes good, and smells great. But the sum of the good parts do not equate into an amazing beer. That said, I really like this overall and would drink it again. Thumbs up!"
"D: The blackout was an interesting time back in 2003, and Blackout Stout is an interesting beer in 2010. A tasty, accessible, drinkable RIS. Complexity is strong, and the alcohol adds a nice touch without being green or hot in the slightest. I would have preferred a heftier body, but it's a minor quibble. Very nice - another excellent seasonal from Great Lakes."
"D - This beer is fantastic! Just what I want in a bigger stout. Has more roast character than any other stout I've had. Especially considering the price this beer is phenomenal. I will pick this again as soon as I see it. In fact I plan on stocking up on this sucker the next time I drive up to Michigan."
"I had this beer on draft at the Great Lakes Pub. It almost pitch black and served in a 12 ounce snifter. It had about a half inch of head. This beer had a strong flavors of coffee and roasted chocolate. Very faint scents of alcohol and detergent. It was very easy to drink for the higher ABV."
"Notes: A fantastic beer. This is a brewery who continues to amaze me. I look forward to trying more of their lineup this year."
"Thanks to my brother-in-law Dave for this one! A deep, dark black pour with a nice head and decent lacing. The nose is incredible. Very complex with tons of chocolate and coffee with just a hint of vanilla. The taste follows suit. Loads of chocolate and coffee with almost no evidence of the 9% alcohol. The vanilla comes through as it warms. This beer should definitely not be served too cold. It really improved and became more complex as it warmed. This is one of the smoothest RIS's I've ever had. Nice bitter finish with a wonderful creamy mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable! A world class RIS! Would love to try the barrel-aged version."
"Overall, an excellent RIS. Doesn't exhibit a ton of nuance, in that there aren't a lot of surprises here, and, to be frank, it packs a hammer punch in terms of chocolate and coffee. However, it does possess the balance without the heat or booziness to make it an incredibly delicious RIS. Hats off, Cleveland gents."
"Overall i loved this beer, if you like dark malt beers and very hard slamming chocolate flavors this is the beer for you. i for one love it and highly recommend it to anyone."
"D-I really wanted another bottle after the I finished this one. I've had some imp stouts that were all roast - which can be challenging to drink in quantity. This one is low on the roast and it makes for a drinkable brew. Alcohol is well hidden. Wish GL distributed to my area."
"D- This stout is very drinkable. Not as heavy as I would like but we can't have everything all the time. Would love to have some more of this to age as I see this just getting better and better."
"Drinkability is very good, it had some very good chocolate and roasty, bitter flavors to it. I'm sure the year of aging had an effect on it from looking at some other reviews that say it was boozy or very hoppy. Unfortunately I haven't had one fresh yet to compare. This one that I opened was very enjoyable and smooth though."
"...I'm out of catchy tunes here, so...yeah... This guy pours a straight obsidian, luster and all, with a small layer of hussy-white bubbly head. The nose is of deep chocolate, molasses, vodka (the hell?), dark malts, a hint of coffee, and some black cherries waaaay in the back. The taste is somewhat similar, with notes of dark oats, figs, raisins, bitter chocolate, and an alcholic burn thrown in for good pyromaniacal measure. The body is a heavy medium, with low carbonation and a surprisingly watery feel. In fact, it's this thinness that knocks it down a peg for me. Just too much water, y'know? Ask the gilled Kevin Costner...he'll set ya straight. Overall, a pretty solid stout, but I just don't feel it's all that excellent, nor does it live up to its hype. Now I've gotta track down a barrel-aged version to keep that one honest..."
"The body is near full with good carbonation. This is a beer I could easily drink all night! Very nicely done!"
"I'd have two or three of these before I needed a change of pace. It would probably be the either the big roasted flavors or the hops that I would tire of. The sweetness is well balanced, so no complaints there. This is a good stout, but nothing is pushing it into the range of excellence."
"D - An assertive and powerful stout... Solid in all categories but really excels in terms of taste and mouthfeel... There's nothing timid about this one... Another job well done by Great Lakes..."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink. I would definitely try another one of these."
"This beer pours a jet-black into my glass with some initial creamy lacing that ceases to reside for long. I like that it stays pretty true to its name. Right off the nose, I get some vanilla, coffee, molasses, nutmeg, and dried cherries clouded by a certain smokeyness to this brew; it's definitely pleasing I think. As with most Imperial Stouts by the nature of their complexity, I believe this beer opens up a bit with time in your glass. Immediately upon my first sip, I get expresso beans, dark chocolate, sugar, and some burnt malts. Sometimes the high volume of the 'burnt flavor' will overpower the beer, and I think this may be partly true on this one. I think the roasty malts take away a little from what the taste could be, but not that much. There is very little carbonation and hoppyness isn't even a factor. Ok, so a little alcohol does come through on the finish, but that's to be expected with beers with ABVs like this. The drinkability for this one is good, but not great. It's such a heavy beer and all the malts are a little overwhelming. Having said that, it would make a great winter-warmer all the same. Overall, it's a really solid beer that falls a little short of its expectations."
"D - This one is a sipper for sure. It doesn't make it any less drinkable though since it's one hell of a beer I'm trying to make last. I could see one of these bottles aging well past it's best by date."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts: Blackout Stout is quite intense, smooth but very complex; it is heavy but drinkable. As with most Great Lakes brews, this is a very great beer available at a very good price. This stout goes through some interesting changes as it warms, so it's a great one to pour into a large snifter and sip on for an hour or so."
"d - I thought this was an amazing RIS; I enjoyed everything about it. Great milk chocolate taste and would love to have again."
"D: for a big beer, this is dangerously drinkable. i will definitely be going back to this in the future."
"Drinkability- This is a beer that I would not session. It has 9.0% alcohol and just one or two is enough to make you feel nice. Any more and you are disrespecting the beer. Just kick back and savor this beer. I promise you will not be disappointed."
"This is a very easy to drink stout. Highly recommended for anyone who has access to Great Lakes' stuff. One to keep stocked up."
"Flavor is good...but just slightly better than your average coffee stout. Lot's of coffee in the flavor, not a lot of sweetness to compliment the sharp coffee bitterness. Again, roasted malts are dominent. Thin to medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is just about middle of the road. Overall, a good stout...obviously I wish this was the bourbon barrel aged though!"
"Still, this was an awesome dessert stout, and I would definitely drink again and again and again!"
"This beer appears a deep, ominous black with a big beige head and adequate lacing. Aromas consist of roasted malt, bitter chocolates, and slight alcohol. This beer is very solid. I've wanted to try it for a while now, and I am certainly not disappointed. The finish is drier than I expected. A good brew, and one I plan to drink more often, as it is available in the local area now."
"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a deep opaque black with a thin tan head. Smells very roasty, with some coffee and to a lesser extent, some chocolate. A nice bitterness upfront, with the roasted malt flavour. Nice amount of coffee in there, without being a coffee stout. Incredibly smooth. A great sipping beer on this lovely Cleveland day."
"I appreciate the way the taste follows the nose, it is an honest beer. The roasted malts and coffee are most noticeable, little bit chocolate in there and some sweetness starts to come through as it warms. Temperature is playing a large role in this one, every sip is a little bit more enjoyable and a little less bitter. Its got a nice, mild smoothness balanced with some carbonation. Didn't really catch much alcohol. Coffee drinkers check this one out, good brew and not too hard to find."
"GLBC comes through w/ an amazing RIS to look forward to each spring."
"Wow, taste right off is very smokey, lots of sharp roasty character. Almost a bit of maple here and some nice woodiness as well. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy, it's a bit syrupy but it's not over the top, the light carbonation cuts it well. A bit of dark chocolate on the finish as well."
"The color of the beer pouring into the glass scared me into thinking this would be super thin and not enjoyable but it surprised me. This really reminded me of Bells Expo but the roasty flavors balanced out the sweetness...Expo is way too sweet for me. Good stuff and recommended if you have ever wanted to try it."
"Beer is thin to medium in body, sweet with a slight aftertaste. Lots of roast in the back of the mouth and it finishes a little dry. There is some alcohol in the palate and some carbonation that helps to carry the flavors through the palate. Its pretty good."
"This beer is well worth the little extra you pay at the store. Can't wait to get a little age on this one."
"Tasted on draft at Goose Island Clybourn. Pours almost black with a red tint and a thin, off-white head. The aromas are coffee, milk and dark chocolate, and very darkly toasted malt. On the palate, the coffee and chocolate come through nicely, but there is definitely big alcohol. The beer is big bodied with a very long semi-sweet finish. Overall, this is exactly what I look for in a big stout."
"D- Much more drinkable than a lot of the other American takes on this style. Im sad to see this one go but really excited for Lake Erie Monster."
"Dangerously drinkable for a 9% abv beer."
"Overall - Very enjoyable stout with a great nose and well crafted flavors. Not a very complex beer in terms of taste, but it does do a very good job at what it does."
"Nearly black, dark brown with chestnut and ruby highlighting. The head is two inches of rich, creamy tan head, but mostly dissipates in five minutes or so. Bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee are the first things the nose picks up. In the background are hints of dark fruits and alcohol. Really earthy taste with a some smokiness. For me, the coffee/espresso taste is stronger than the smell. The bitter chocolate is secondary, but really comes on in the finish. It's almost a reversal from the smell. You can feel the warming alcohol more than taste it. It's got a very rich and creamy feel."
"D. Being a RIS this isn't going to be a beer that one sessions. That said, I could easily have a couple without a problem. It slides pretty easily - always quickly inviting me back for another sip. I put this in the same category as Founders Imperial and North Coast Old Rasputin in terms of flavor, enjoyability and price. A solid offering from Great Lakes."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A good Imperial Stout for sure. I expect nothing less from Great Lakes. They make great beer at a great price."
"D- Very drinkable considering the alcohol content, goes down easy."
"The 9% ABV is very well hidden and the Blackout Stout is such a smooth and complex brew. Recommended."
"D: I really like this beer, it is an excellent example of the style. It seems to fit with the Great Lakes mentality of restrained and well-balanced which I have come to appreciate. This goes down very easy without any sign of 9% alcohol. Highly recommended."
"D_Real smooth for a big brew. Like to enjoy a couple in a sitting."
"I see on the label it's recommended that I had consumed this beer 2 months ago so I'm assuming it's a few years old today, I still think it could spend some more time under the stairs but a great beer right now regardless. I would drink this often if it was available in my part of the world but for now I'll just have to thank ritzkiss for sending it my way."
"D: This isn't the greatest big stout out there, but it's a solid example of a non barrel-aged simple stout. Enjoyable and something I would hunt out again."
"D - It's ok. I'd prefer other stouts, but I would drink a bit of this."
"D: I'm not really sure what the fuss is all about. I've heard a bit about this beer but overall, a bit disappointed. Just average in every way though the nose is unique in a heavy, subdued kind of way. Still, I'm not going out of my way for this one."
"This is a very drinkable beer and the more sips I take, the more I like it. Solid."
"D - At 9.0% this beer does not have a huge amount of drinkability. But it still is a treat every time you do get to have it."
"Drinks very well-small bite here and sometimes the coffee bean can come through twinge too much."
"D- jeez, at $9.19/4pk it's both affordable and great, i could easily deplete our area's entire supply, even in summer this would be a great late evening beer"
"Overall- this is a must try for all stout fans!! for not being a stout fan i have to say i can tip my hat to this brew."
"D - An excellent RIS. Will definitely pick up at least a 4 pack of this every winter."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a stout that I've been wanting to try."
"D/Overall: Very nice RIS, but not something I'd go out of my way for. Which is good, since going out of my way would require airfare."
"Overall, not a bad imperial stout. Imperials are not my stout of choice, but one can absolutely appreciate what Great Lakes did with this. I tend to feel that GL is overrated (being from Ohio people go absolutely crazy for the stuff, not knowning anything about beer; just that it's from Ohio) but this was a gem to find, especially on tap! I was about to get a guinness after to balance out the flavor and mouthfeel, but realized that would have tasted like water after this bad boy, so I got an IPA with my burger instead. I would enjoy again..."
"D: This stout is simply O.K. IMHO. I think it could benefit greatly from sacrificing a little of its ""blackout"" color by trading a little of the darker roasted malts for some slightly sweeter malts. Perhaps a little more chocolate malt would do this brew good. I'll throw a couple in the cellar and see if a year takes some of the bitter bite out of the flavor."
"This is a good RIS but there are better ones out there, I am eager to try this with some age on it however as it might just be too fresh. I also would like to try the BA version."
"M/D- medium0light bodied, low carbonation. very drinkable. i dunno what happened here, but i wasn't overly impressed. hopefully the other 2 i aquired will drink better in a few months."
"Bottles poured a dark black using the Sam Adams pefect pint glass. Decent amount of foam lacing the glass. The taste comes through as dark roasted chocolate. A very smooth stout overall and quite drinkable. No trace of the 9% alc at all in any sip. A pretty good stout overall, nothing amazing, but good. Glad I finally got to try this one. Would have no issues drinking this again."
"Unfortunatly it was fairly expensive at $11 something a 4 pack. But very worth it. Ill let a bottle sit for awhile"
"WOW..nice.smooth for an Imperial stout, Black , Malty, a slight alcohol finish, but all of the typical stout traits, even a little touch of smoke. Aroma of Dark chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, alcohol, mocha and coffee. Flavor is sweet roasted malts, tabacco and chocolate, . Great balance. Smooth, creamy and very easy drinking. Alcohol is a bit noticeable. Very good beer, but did you expect any less from Great Lakes. Let this 9% bitch sit a year."
"A very drinkable stout at 9% and the price doesn't hurt it either."
"Not a bad price for a big middle of the road stout."
"Smooth and lush, with a very easy drinking quality. It's so well-balanced that it goes down super smooth. The flavors are bold without being overpowering which bodes well for its drinkability. The finish is bitter and a lingering roast."
"I really like this concoction. It reminds me of a Sam Adams Triple Bock but (pleasantly) muted and filtered to the point of refinement. Great Lakes continues to deliver quality brew!"
"I was in the mood for a more chocolately stout, and I got it. I'm not a huge fan of the dark fruit notes in this one, but luckily they play a secondary role. I'm glad I got to have this, and now I'm even more interested in the barrel-aged version!"
"This brew is just boring. Mediocre taste, weak mouthfeel. I expected much better. It's not offensive or awful - it's just bland and boring. Possibly the most uninspired RIS/Double Stout I've ever had."
"Overall a super easy drinking RIS if there ever was one. I'm glad I scored a handful of bottles."
"Pours a thick opaque black with dense chocolate milk head that laces decently. Smell is strong with some big roasted/toasted malts and coffee notes. Taste follows with a punch of dark malt with some exceptional toasted flavors. Some sweeter notes under there too. Light hints of dark chocolate, and mild hop bitterness, though not nearly as much as in Storm King or Black Sun Stout. MF is creamy and clean, a bit dry actually. Very drinkable for a RIS, a great example of the style. No tricks, just a good beer."
"Had this one on tap at Capone's in PA on Friday, reviewed from notes. Pours pitch black with a nice tan colored head that leaves a fine coat of tan lacing. There is a nice ring and cloud atop the beer as I drink it and the head has nice retention and looks. Smells of roast malt, some caramel/sugars, a tiny pinch of alcohol, some cocoa and coffee. Needs a bit more strength but a good balance indeed. Much of the same in the taste. Heavy roast malts, cocoa a hint of alcohol, some sweets and a good earthy hop backbone to balance the flavor. Mouthfeel is very nice. An awesomely creamy and heavy body with great warming. A bit of oily feeling to it and a nice low amount of carbonation make for a perfect RIS mouthfeel. The tongue is left with a coat of roast malt. Very sessionable for a 9% RIS, ABV present but in a good way. The taste and price were good. A nice straight up RIS."
"D - Very good, I can only wish for this to be on cask... 4.0"
"D- A nice, drinkable RIS; pretty easy to enjoy without any aging."
"D- This is a nice beer. It provides some nice flavor without going over the top. It's a nice change of pace from some of the other big name imperial stouts."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipping or end-of-meal beer. Very relaxing and tasty as a desert, but I can't have too much of just desert. So not a more than one beer, but still very good."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a creamy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a sweet chocolatey scent that's rich and creamy with a touch of black malt earthiness. The taste is great as well. It has a warm chocolate malt flavor that goes down slow and easy with a slight black malt bitterness. It's damn smooth and rich. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a delicious beer. As far as stouts go, this one is in my top ten."
"To me this was similar to and almost as good as Bell's Batch 9000 at about 1/2 the price. For that how can you go wrong?"
"Drinkabilirty: I would definitely have this again, and recommend this to those seeking a solid RIS with tons of molasses, dark malts, dark fruit and coffee."
"Pours a near black with the head vanishing quickly leaving a thin tan ring of bubbles. The aroma is roasted with chocolate, vanilla, cherry a hint of hops and nice light alcohol burn. After my first sip I was hooked on this beer, it is incredibly balanced. Toasted and roasted, with light chocolate and not overly sweet. Finished by a bit of hops to round it all off. I was just happy to not see this overly sweet as so many other RIS are. I could be drinking this beer all the time if I could. I had a couple on tap and loved every sip of it. Great beer!"
"Overall this was an exceptional Imperial Stout from Great Lakes and one that is deserving of its praise. Thanks again Fletch for including this as an extra in our trade! Recommended."
"No problems with the drinkability of this beer and I do not detect any of the heat that is sometimes commented on"
"Good brew from Great Lakes, just a little thinner than I remember from the bottle. Could have a couple of these with no problem..."
"D- Drinkable, not my fav from them but not bad."
"D - easy drinking for a RIS"
"If you haven't had this one, try it out. Great Lakes is a brewery that gets overlooked a little too much, even by those of us in the region. They may not do anything flashy in terms of packaging or advertising but they do make great beers that speak for themselves."
"D: Wish I had more than two. One's going away for some aging. Very drinkable, and although it may seem a bit hot now, I can only imagine some age on this brew. Great beer."
"Very drinkable for an imperial stout. Overall an amazing beer, a really fine example of the style. Subtle and balanced rather than in-your-face. Time to go seek out BA Blackout."
"LOVE IT!!! Must have more!"
"Right up there with the Siberian Nights, Old Raspy and Black Chocolate Stout. This Cleveland native takes a backseat to no one."
"D - This is a very good RIS from a great brewering company, I highly recommend this and would love to try the BA version of this."
"All in all, I'm very glad I got to try this brew. If you have the opportunity, definitely give this brew a try. This is like a blend of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout and Imperial Stout Trooper. Great brew if you like stouts."
"J"
"Thanks to Dunt for this one. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours thick, jet black, with a 2+ finger white head. There are huge coffee and chocolate notes in the nose, more than some coffee stouts I have had. The coffee flavor is very rich, with supple chocolate in the background. It is very thick and the taste coat every part of the mouth. Very well carbonated and easy to sip on. This beer is underated."
"The mouthfeel starts out very smooth, but does have a little bite towards the end, presumably from some carbonation but definitely the alcohol as well. It is definitely creamy and thick, and goes down smooth. The drinkibility is great, this brew is so inviting and goes well after a nice dinner. Something that is great to drink on a cold night, and would go great with dessert or just by itself."
"The body is a little lacking and the bitterness is a bit much over time, but overall a good imperial stout."
"D-this drinks easy, the body isn't so big you can only drink one; but it is still thick giving the feel of a stout. Great complexity on the flavors with a very nice blending. Fantastic!"
"Notes- What a difference a year makes; last year I really couldn't appreciate this beer. I'm stocking up this year!"
"Great RIS from Great Lakes, a winner!"
"I poured this stout in a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass, i think i'm going to drink every beer in this glass, it has all the characteristics of every glassware"
"D: high for the style , could drink these down, this is a perfectly balanced RIS, this is great lakes best brew,"
"Like I said, this is one of my favorites. I'd compare the overall experience to Flying Dog's Gonzo."
"After 3+ years of age the alcohol is well hidden in the taste but it still has a wonderful warming effect. Would not hesitate aging this well past the best buy date that is listed on the bottle."
"Impenetrably black with a bit over one finger of pure tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves a thin sheet of lace all around the glass. At the nose sweet chocolates are noticed followed quickly by some bitter chocolates, a very faint woodiness and some distant hops. Tastes of cocoa with a vein of sweet chocolates through the middle and alcohol heat and burnt wood in the end. Fairly creamy with some dry edges, and goes down easily despite the alcohol (very little heat is noticed). Thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"D-not too rich, not too lacking, just a great approachable Stout."
"Body isn't quite as hefty as I was hoping for, but, really, that's the only knock I can think of. This is an outstanding beer. Very, very drinkable for a 9% RIS. I much prefer regular Blackout Stout to its barrel-aged counterpart."
"Really nice roast malt notes throughout and a sweetness balanced just enough by hops to make this exceptionally drinkable. Wish I had a few more of these..."
"Drinkability: Easily my favorite overall RIS and I'm so excited for this time of year as I'll be able to add to my vertical of it; amazing flavors and smells from my go-to brewery since getting back East that create the perfect cold winter night brew. Thank you GLBC, thank you."
"Very dark black appearance that turns dark brown/red around the edges when held up to the light. Nice layer of tan foam about half an inch thick. Smell was chocolate and coffee. It had a pleasant aroma, but not a particularly robust one. The taste is great, rich chocolate and coffee with hints of vanilla. The only detraction is a slight bit of alcohol in the finish. It is just a little unpleasant which is why this otherwise very drinkable beer does not have a perfect score in the taste or drinkability categories. The mouthfeel is good. Could be just a bit more viscous, but it is very good. I'll definitely have this again the next time it's available."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer even with the high abv volume. Great beer for sure and great representation of the style."
"i am blown away. i had this last winter but it was fresh, i loved it, but i was not floored by it. ohh what a year has done. very mellow and blended together with a nice wide range of flavors and scents. at no point does it get boring. thank god i have more."
"Overall- Let it warm up. Wow, delicious! Alc. is hidden behind a big creamy beer!"
"While perhaps not the most complex RIS I've tasted, certainly one of the most tasty, another big winner from Great Lakes Brewery in Ohio, what an outstanding lineup on the US side of the Great Lakes, wish I could get their products in Ontario!"
"Overall excellent and a very solid example of the style. GO BUCKS!!"
"Pours a thick black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, some lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet roasted malts, slight vanilla, tons of chocolate/toffee/caramel. The taste follows the nose pretty much, nice roasted, chocolatey, coffee flavor. Alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, a nice RIS, very much to the style."
"Despite the imperfections, or perhaps because of them, this beer is surprisingly drinkable. Not bad, and certainly one I would like to try with some age on it."
"OVERALL Smooth, balanced, rich complex and delicious. Wow! Grateful for the opportunity to try this. Even more pleased to have discovered one more fantastic brewery that was until recently unknown to me."
"Overall very nice, a little bitter for my taste, but if you like hoppy stouts, this one is pretty legit"
"Overall: Mouth feel is dry, creamy, and luscious. The body of the beer is medium full and the finish is medium full. This is a descent RIS, I feel that the body wasn't as deep as some of the greats. The hops was there but not too developed. I am being nit picky but for it to make an A, it has make a stand and it didn't."
"The feel is too light and watery not very drinkable."
"Overall, a good imperial stout. Not the best I've had, but a solid offering in a solid lineup."
"Mouthfeel is medium to medium-full, lighter than expected but creamy and a bit dry towards the finish. Alcohol is pretty much missing, fantastic drinkability."
"Wow, very impressive, and right on-target for the Imperial Stout style. A little deceiving, the alcohol is noticeable but clean and keeps this beer within a very drinkable state."
"D Nice to try and say I have buy not living up to the hype."
"D- very drinkable considering the alcohol content, goes down easy"
"A good example of a stout. I wouldn't keep it around, but every now and then it would be good to have."
"D- A really nice roasted RIS flavor that is easily to find around these parts."
"Drinkability: A very good RIS, but I believe it would be better fresh. I'd definitely buy more of this if it was available in my area. A great sipper."
"Really good example. More milk chocolate than dark chocolate and the hops have been toned down some in the year and a half this one was aged. Alcohol well hidden and the mouthfeel is chewy and heavy with the booze in the finish minimal. Drinkability was close to perfect, great beer and it goes down well."
"Drink ability is good. For 9% it drinks closer to about 7 percent. I dont know if its all in my head or what but this beer seems to have become much better with some aging. It seems more complex and smooth around the edges. Need some more of this"
"Drinkability: high abv but easy mouthfeel."
"drinkability is good.there are other russian imperial stouts that i would keep in rotation before this though."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. This bottle will give me know troubles. After having this one, I can only imagine how good the BA version is. I will be seeking that one out when it is released again. A good beer worth a try."
"Drinkability- Just an absolutely terrific brew. Like I said I've had this brew many time but they were all older. A random liquor store in Chicago had many 4 packs of this stuff covered with dust on its shelf. I think fresh it has a more brash, in your face taste, while older it was a bit mellower and the chocolate was more intertwined with everything. I really enjoyed this fresh but if I had to choose (new or old) I'd probably lean fresh. Thanks much Adam!"
"Nice beer to slowly enjoy."
"A good RIS that I'd recommend for anyone to try."
"On the full side of medium bodied, this would be a great beer to drink in a social setting because it is flavorful yet easy to drink, but in the comfort of my own home I prefer to drink something a bit more exciting."
"D: Not a bad beer by any stretch, the blackberries were something new, but the mish-mash of chocolate, tobacco and coffee feels oh so familiar to me."
"This is certainly a gem and I can see how BA this would add a nice layer. This is a great stout that I would gladly reach for again. Very nice, thanks Viggo!"
"Overall, not my favorite example of this style."
"M/D: A great texture for a Russian Imperial Stout. Only a slight bit of carbonation is evident on the tongue. The beer is creamy and delightful. The lack of depth to the flavor was slightly disappointing, but overall, this is a very solid representation of the style, and I would drink it again."
"The beer is full bodied with low carbonation. The mouthfeel is viscous, somewhat syrupy, and full."
"Excellent drinkability for such a strong beer. One of the best in it's class. Cheers!"
"This poured an opaque black ruby with a little bit of tan head. It smelled like rich molasses and brown sugar and sweet dark chocolate, with a bit of roasted coffee and prune. It tasted like molasses and honey wheat and roasted coffee, with some bitter chocolate and raisin. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a smooth bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a huge improvement over the fresh bottle. My what five years have done! It had a great scent and taste that were super smooth and rich. It was somewhere between a sweet stout and a very malty barleywine, and it worked. The body was a bit lacking, but this was otherwise a great beer. Easy enough to gulp, but much more rewarding to sip."
"Creamy body is nicely carbonated, but just a bit thin. Tasty stout from Great Lakes. Would love to try the BA version."
"D: Good.. but nothing distinguishes itself here... its not as complex as the russian imperial stout category demands from its best... nice thing is, it was relatively cheap... worth a shot"
"Pours deep, dark, sludgey and mysterious. At first tranquil looking, but leaves some sweet lacing trails. Upon smelling, I can't smell if this is a chocolate or a coffee bomb, but I'm getting both distinctly. Overall roastiness I guess is the main sensation, with a good bit of chocolate in there. Very smooth, no hint of the booziness. Not very hoppy for a RIS. May be a bit thin in the mouth for a big stout though, the initial heft doesn't really stick on the palate. Still, a good balance between creamy and slick, and if we could get this here, would be another great choice for sessionable imperial stout."
"I don't know why I never pick this up when it's out. It's a great beer and really hits the spot when I'm in a big stout mood. I guess I'll be buying more of this before it's gone this year. Probably my favorite Great Lakes beer."
"Black. Frothy head around the edges. A nice sweet malt smell with some roastiness. Hops are detected under the malt as well. It kind of has a clove smell to it. Taste is loaded with malt that coats the mouth and finishes with a nice sweet bitterness. The malt is detected on the finish more than the bitterness. Wow, swirling this around in the mouth has a great thick creaminess thats enjoyable. Prickly carbonation on the finish. Hops are noticeable. A solid beer."
"M: Mouth feel is medium heavy, not much carbonation, it goes down easy. Its a solid stout. You could have a couple of these no prob, but like most imperials I find them more of a desert or night-cap, not to be quickly imbibed, just savored."
"One of Great Lakes best beers. Lots of nice complex flavors with an easy drinkability. This is not a super thick 'in your face' Imperial Stout, it is more of a refined and classic interpretation. Can't wait till next spring so I can have more of this gem."
"This was another great Midwest RIS. I really want to try the BA version. Really good stuff."
"Overall, a top-tier RIS. Very excited to try this Barrel-Aged version of this to say the least."
"Pours black with a rich brown head. The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and a hint of raisins. Chocolate flavor is quickly followed by malt, caramel, licorice, then a light smokiness. Alcohol provides a finishing burn. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy, though now as nice as some impy's I've tried. Overall very complex and quite good."
"(D)- This RIS is simple, straightforward, yet decadent. Chocolate lovers unite! Super sweet and super roasted. A for sure sipper that could replace any dessert involving chocolate. The few extra months this had in the bottle since it was put in there over this past winter did wonders for it! If you have any of this, its really good right now in my opinion! However brace yourselves, this is not for the weak minded."
"Pours a deep, warm, opaque sable that is just a red tomcat whisker above black. Head is thick and dark tan, but disappears quickly - half a point off there. Aroma is rich and fills the nose with smoke, fine coffee, unsweetened chocolate and molasses. Flavor does not disappoint - rich and lip-smacking, it is like fine roast coffee mixed with unsweet chocolate, a hint of charcoal and a touch of molasses. Texture is thick, oily, smooth and lively so it doesn't just slide down the pipes but fairly dances its way to the tummy. A must for all stouties!"
"Pours an almost jet black motor oil hue, but has some noticeable and eye pleasing brownie highlights. A filmy, light brown head slow disintegrates into nothing. The aroma is super complex. Notes of peet, deep roastd coffee, sensual chocolate, and some single malt whisley aromas. This beer isn't even aged in oak barrels! The hopping definetly mellowed with age. But the hops still impart an overall earthy falvor to thsi very dark and complex malt bomb. The coffee and chocolate are smooth and roasty bitter to almost brunt. Then theres this vanilla wood, peet, whiskey barrel flavor and soothing alcoholic heat to the finish. This beer is awesome. I remeber it tasting great fresh, but aged... holy smokes!!!!"
"Notes: This is a big full bodied slow sipper."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a really good big stout to drink for a long time especially with some age on it."
"medium body, smooth enough, but some astringent character overall, which sort of also thins it out. mild to moderate carbonation helps with the body a little."
"D: This didn't blow my mind, but it was good enough that I'd want to get more. Well done."
"D- Very easy to drink but I wouldnt have more than one in a sitting before moving on to something else."
"Pours black with a fine tan head that displays good retention. Aromas of burnt sugar, dark fruity yeast, slight spiciness. Taste is similar to the aroma, along with rum soaked raisins. Dry roasty finish with some alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is full with a medium-high carbonation. Exceptionally fruity fruity and yeasty, and not in a good way for me."
"D - Pretty good drinkability! It goes down very smooth, and the taste isn't overpowering in any way, so this is a pretty drinkable beer."
"UPDATE---I'm drinking a bottle that I've been cellaring from the above batch and it has all come together very nicely with almost a year on it. The lingering hop bitterness has mellowed and the chocolate comes through so much more on the aroma. This is fantastic. Silky smooth. I'm going to up the mouthfeel and the taste a half point! I wish I had some more of these!!"
"Notes: a well made beer, would recommend it to anyone. let it warm, drink it slow, enjoy this beer... cause its 10$ for a 4-pack! if there is another major black out, i hope i have a 4-pack of this beer with me. when i finshed this beer i didn't want it to end."
"D= decent. Not the best RIS I have ever had. I imagine the BA version being fabulous. Pretty good though"
"Bottom line: this is a great stout and is among my favorites. I'm so glad I gave it a second chance."
"D- This has aged extremely well. Flavors are all very mellow and has perhaps gotten a little too sweet but it was tasty none the less."
"D: For the 9%, I can't complain at all. Sure it is a bit thin, but that absolutely helps the drinkability. This went down incredibly well and quickly for an RIS. It has a lot going for it in the flavor and aroma categories, but it does have room to grow in the look and feel. The look was truly lacking but the flavor really helps it all out. Very glad to have finally tried this and it works nicely. Another great brew to have enjoyed from Great Lakes. Damn tasty."
"D: What a great IRS. Probably couldn't have more than one of these, but it's so flavorful and so delicious."
"My first experience with this particular seasonal brew came at last years Beerfest, (September 2008) in Rochester NY. Word was that this dark stout was only available for a very short period of time. A friend and fellow beer enthusiast and I, parked ourselves right in front of the Great Lakes podium and began inflating our pourers heads while scoring full glasses of the delicious brew. We found out that Great Lakes at that time was not being distributed in the Rochester market but, by chance, Great Lakes would soon be flooding the shelves of local grocers Wegmans and other local distribution centers. To our dismay, we found that Great Lakes offered a variety of great tasting ales, and stouts but the coveted Blackout stout was actually a seasonal brew saved over from the past spring! We tried to get a lead on where it was hidden finally contacting the brewery itself. Our efforts were in vein. There simply was none to be had. We gave up. I was at a local Bar/Restaurant a couple of weeks ago when in pure amazement saw Blackout Stout on the menu! A few inquires to the manager and I was informed that a small shipment made its way in from Cleveland and that, what was available to the public, was being rationed out at our local ""Beers of the World"" store. 1 phone call later I was informed by the clerk that 6 cases remained. I immediately finished my drink and headed over to purchase every last bottle. 6 cases and almost $400 dollars later, I had every drop in Rochester in my possession! I made a few calls to a few good friends and parted with a couple of the cases. This is the stuff dreams are made of! Dark,full flavor, slight bitter bite, with hints of chocolate, and nutty. Great served slightly below room temp. and paired well with fruits, chocolates, and sweet desserts. This is a sipping beer meant to be drank from a goblet. At 9% ABV it is nearly perfect. I don't bother to break this stuff out for the general house guests as few have the pallet to appreciate the quality and character of this fine, fine brew."
"As a friend once said of it: ""it doesn't matter how highly this is rated, it should be rated higher."" I couldn't agree more. It's hard to go wrong with anything Great Lakes brews but it simply is wrong to not have a bottle or two of their Blackout Stout on hand in the cellar at all times. You never know when a blackout will hit and believe you me, you'll be happy to have a stockpile on hand just in case!"
"Drinkability- High ABV makes this a beer to be wary of. Though the alcohol is evident, it doesn't take away from drinkability too much."
"Poured a nice black with good carbonation and a medium tannish head. Nose is sweet light chocolate, roasted malts, espresso and a kick of alcohol. Taste is big roasted malt with cocoa on the end. Nice ABV punch to it. I almost detected some licorice candy and perhaps slight smokiness and wood. Mouthfeel is nice and drinkability is really good."
"Thanks Ben!"
"Drinkability: So high for the style. I definitely look forward to this in bottle and on tap when it comes out every year."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Imperial pint glass. This stout appears a nearly opaque deep dark brown color with an inch of pillowy dark ecru foam. Nose consists of rich, deeply roasted grains, fresh coffee beans, and raisins. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, dark roasted coffee, a hint of vanilla and sweet molasses, plums, raisins, and earthy hops. Approaching full bodied with ample carbonation. Alcohol starts really coming out as the stout warms, but it is still quite sippable and enjoyable."
"Drinkability - This beer a great stout and pretty drinkable for a 9% beer."
"I'm glad I picked this up in Chicago. A very nice sweet imperial stout that has just enough bitterness to keep it away from being cloying. Highly recommended!"
"Taste is quite smooth and mellow, caramel hits you first, a balanced maltness, licorice hints, roasted coffee flavors and shy dark chocolate, it left an aftertaste of roasted burnt coffee and a nutty note in mouth."
"D: It wasn't a fight, but like all RIS, more than one usually too much"
"This is a drinkable RIS. It's closer to Ten FIDY than Old Rasputin, but not quite in the same category of either of those."
"D- This is a very solid effort on the style. I enjoy this beer quite a bit and love the BA version. Worth seeking out really explodes with flavors once it warms."
"When I had this for the first time about a year ago, Blackout Stout was the first stout I ever really liked. I was surprised to see it listed as an RIS and not just an American Stout. This is a great beer in itself, but it can't compete with some of the huge beers in this category."
"Big fan of Great Lakes as a whole, and while this beer seems to be a big hit with many, it just isn't my pint of ale. Dark brown color, relatively carbonated, glints of red up to the light, almost Coca-cola like in appearance. Nice roasty smell. Hints of chocolate, milk, coffee, and sugar. Flavor is just a little underwhelming. Great roasty malt flavor, but nothing really deep here. A little bit sugary and sweet, with hardly any bitterness. A little thin on the palate. Nice roast to this beer but really nothing extraordinary or anything holding this beer together. Try their lagers or Burning River pale ale for a good representation from this brewery."
"Drinkability: Very good, very drinkable RIS. Will definitely seek out again."
"A year of aging has really helped this beer I think, as I don't recall fresh bottles tasting nearly as good. This is pretty impressive."
"Pours a very deep (black out) black with some nice tan head and very nice tan lacing. Deep malty scent with hints of burnt grain and a hint of sweetness (milk or oatmeal?). Excellent taste, a very deep dark stout with great burnt grain flavors and a wonderful hit of sweetness as it goes down, which reminds me of a milk stout; enouth hops to keep it from being too unbalanced. Nice and smooth, with just a bit of alcohol burn on the tongue at the end. An excellent impy stout!"
"Overall, a very nice RIS. Not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it more than Victory Storm King Stout."
"Pours nice looking black with minimal head, and copious carbonation. Smells delicious, with strong chocolate and coffee scents, with a little bit of molasses and/or brown sugar. Taste matches awesome smell, with bitter chocolate and dark, roasted coffee coming to the forefront. The beer is a pleasure to drink, and is smooth and nicely (but not overly) syrupy. I enjoyed sipping on one a lot, and could go for another, but its not a drink I could have all the time; you can feel the ABV."
" Thank you GLB"
"Special thanks to RixBeer for hooking me up with this one. If he has any left, I'd recommend you pay him a visit...."
"Another great beer from Great Lakes"
"Drink: Fairly drinkable. The alcohol seems to slow things down. But, enjoyable."
"Poured this straight from the bottle. It pours a thick creamy black. Very intense black color. Mouthfeel was great. Creamy is the best way to describe the feel of this brew. The taste really turned me on to stouts, extremely complex with notes of caramel and toasted nuts. Smell goes right along with the taste. Head was thick and frothy and stayed around the whole time. I was really happ to have picked this brew up while I could. Great call and I will be coming back for more next year."
"This is a super delicious RIS that was spot on for mouthfeel, aroma and taste. Absolutly satisfied with this beer. Anyone that says they enjoyed old rasputin ( i hated it) needs to try this to see what they are missing."
"Pours a beautiful dark brown with a small ½ finger tan colored head. Smells of sweet dark fruits dominate the roasted malts. First sip is bitter then quickly sweet as my taste buds alert me that this is something special. Under carbonated and somewhat thin bodied, there is a coffee flavored finish that is truly amazing. The chocolate, coffee and dark fruits combine easily adding sweetness to the warming alcohol."
"Definitely would recommend"
"If your expecting a Guiness you won't get quite the same flavor but to me just as much enjoyment. I usually stick to the pale ales and IPA's but as far as a dark beer goes I don't think you can beat this one. Definitely recommend."
"Great Lakes swings and knocks another one out of the park. Delicious."
"Had this on tap at Great Lakes. I will preface by saying this is one of my favorite beers of all time. Served in a snifter. Great aromas from this brew coffee, chocolate, very sweet. Thin head but great lacing. First sip was a smack to the face. This beer has some oomph. Taste is confirming of the smell. Very heavy mouthfeel and a little boozy, but a great sipper. I would definitely have this on tap again, but no more than one or two, that abv can sneak up on you."
"Pours out a deep black with about two fingers of off white, creamy head. Excellent lacing and head retention. Smells are of dark sugars, roasted coffee, a slight hop smell and a bit of alcohol. Taste is roasted coffee mixed with a sweet and sugary flavor. A small amount of hop bitterness is detected, although it finishes off with the roasted flavor and a bit of alcoholic warmth. Mouthfeel is heavy, but a bit thin compared to some of the other RIS's I've had lately. Of the RIS's I've had so far though, this one is easily the best."
"D: This beer is great to sip on for an hour. I recommend this beer to anyone into complex, balanced and hearty brews."
"Drinkability: A solid imperial stout. It's easy enough to drink, though the alcohol coming through tempers that somewhat. It's somewhat one dimensional in flavor, but enjoyable. With a few tweaks, this beer could be really outstanding. If this was local to my area, I'd probably seek it out, but I won't go out of the way to get it."
"D: A definite must try for any beer lover, especially Russian Imperial Stout lovers. A high ABV limits my consumption, but 1-2 in a sitting isn't bad. Beer gets better as it warms."
"Dark like a stout should be with some nice tan head. A decent aroma but not nose grabbing as i was hoping. Taste was extremely alcoholic at first with just a bit of burnt coffee and semi-sweet chocolate BUT let this one warm up a bit. The flavor heavily develops as it warms and the heavy alcohol flavor almost completely dissipates and you are left with some more desirable caramelized burnt coffee flavors which makes this beer very easy to drink."
"D: I am a huge fan of Great Lakes. I did not enjoy this as much as I did last year and I'm not sure if the beer changed or my taste changed. There is so much I love about this brew but the bitter combination of burnt malt and alcohol combined with a cloying type licorice makes it harder to drink than it needs to be. I'd be happier if it were a smoother drink but that's the beauty of beer - that's just my taste! Try it and enjoy it. I will certainly enjoy the 2 I have left and look forward to it next year."
"Had this on tap at the brewery. It is very much black with a small fluffy eggshell-white head. It smells of roasted malts, coffee, and hint of chocolate. The taste is of everything I listed in the smell. Taste and smell are identical. Very tasty. You can also taste the alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is of light/medium body. It's smoother than I expected. I could drink two of these in a row before probably getting a little tired of the taste, and also having to move on soon from the 9% ABV. This is another one of Great Lakes fantastic brews."
"also pairs very nicely with some dark chocolate. seems to add an extra bitterness to the finish as well as takes away some of the alcohol heat."
"Pours out a dark brown color with a small tan head and very light lacing. There's a very nice chocolate aroma, almost like tootsie rolls, the slightest hint of coffee, and a nice roasted malt character. Taste is all chocolate. There must been a copious amount of chocolate malt that went into this brew. There's also a nice bit caramel flavor a warming booziness. This is a very tasty brew and probably has more chocolate flavor out of any non-chocolate stout beer I've had. Body is slightly lacking for the style, in my opinion, but it's still medium-full. Nice brew and would love to try the barrel aged version."
"Overall, it's an amazing beer, but thats nothing new coming from Great Lakes so I didn't really expect much less. My only complaint is that it's a seasonal beer; I really wish this was year round. I think BA should start a petition!"
"D: A sipper even if you didn't try. ABV is noticeable but not overwhelming in any way. Overall, not too shabby. I would recommended other RIS over this one, but by all means this is not a lil' runt."
"D - The thinner body lends itself more to drinkability, and the price was decent as well. With just about any RIS I'd only have one in a night, which is fine, and not a pro or con to me."
"D: This beer is delicious, an excellent imperial stout. IT is nicely balanced, has a smooth body, the only gripe I have is the lingering sweetness."
"Future outlook: Great Lakes...made in state, available damn near everywhere here....and seemingly always putting out high-caliber brews, regardless of style. I will happily purchase this again."
"This beer pours a deep black with a long lasting 1 inch thick brown head. The aroma consists of roasted malts, chocolate and a very vibrant fruit. The taste follows the aroma with a very prominent malt presence and a bitter follow through. This was a great example of a RIS and I would love to try the barrel aged version of this."
"Overall I would call this a delicious imperial stout. The hops can become a bit harsh as you drink, but that's the only real complaint. The rich, smooth, roasted chocolate flavor works well with the silky body. This is definitely highly recommended, as the beers tend to be from Great Lakes Brewing Company."
"This beer is awesome. Perfect stout. A little bit smoky for the style but I rather like it. Faint alcohol warmth. Buttery smooth finish. Sweet, complex, earthy. Wow. Fantastic beer. Don't hesitate, this stuff is the nectar of the gods."
"Dangerously drinkable at 9.0Abv. An excellent Russian Imperial."
"Drinkability: Another incredible beer from Great Lakes, as expected. I am going to put s few of these in the cellar and will be interested to see how they develop. I imagine the alcohol edge, thought slight, will fade."
"Update: I have indeed found my easy go-to stout. I purchased a case of this, and couldn't be happier. Easily my favorite stout that isn't a quest to get, and one of a very elite club of beers that I have purchased a case of. Amazing beer."
"Taste is also very clean. Very little coming from the alcohol. A very calming imperial stout if you will. Almost like a milk imperial stout. If I had to drink a strong stout during the summer, this would be it. What it lacks in pure outrageous flavor, which is common among most stouts of this type, it makes up for in drinkability and overall niceness. This is turning out to be a weird review since it's late and I'm getting tired. Nonetheless, this is the first and last beer I will ever deem 'nice.' Try it for yourself and see."
"I picked up a 4-pack of these when I was in Chicago on a whim at a small liqour store by the downtown Travelodge. That store held a Great Lakes tasting while I was in town. Judging by the quality of Blackout Stout, I'm sad that I didn't pick up the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter while I was at it. I can't get this beer in the Kansas City area, which saddens me. This is a beer comparable in flavor to that old favorite, Old Rasputin -- only Blackout Stout is better. This is a triumph; I look forward to the day that I can drink this again. Until that day, I'm pretty much ""blacked-out."""
"Pours a solid black with a fluffy tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells of cocoa and milk chocolate, a bit of roast, coffee and some alcohol as it warms. Tastes of cocoa and chocoalate followed by some roast and hop bitterness followed by some coffee leaving a roast bitterness in the finish. Creamy velvety smooth mouthfeel, thick body, low but ample carbonation. This is a great stout! one of the best I've had in a while. Huge creamy mouthfeel, just awesome."
"Recommended!"
"D: seems very drinkable for the style"
"D: The lighter body of this beer makes Blackout Stout a pretty drinkable beer, however the strong malt and semi bitter aftertaste can catch up with you. A very solid beer none the less."
"I tried this beer about a month ago with my friend Jason, (thanks by the way). And He said it was going to be EPIC, and man was he right. I gave this beer a perfect score. I don't think I gave any other beer a perfect score, but this one I believe deserves it. It truely was epic in every sence. Outstanding indeed. I couldn't find anything wrong with it. Probably the best beer I've tried to date. I highly recommend this one."
"D= This was a great stout but not at all what I expected. Its sort of like an Imperial dry stout with a lot of roasted grain character as compared to most other RIS' I have had. All in all an interesting beer that was very drinkable despite the big ABV."
"D: I like this brand a lot, but despite clearly quality ingredients and brewing, I don't see myself seeking this out. I also would not turn one down!"
"While of course it isn't as good as the rare RIS, it's a really good RIS that is actually available. I would compare it to Old Rasputin"
"D - I could put down a couple of these without knowing it, its not too heavy and each sip tastes better and better. A perfect choice for a cold night like tonight."
"D- Not sessionable at 9% but i would not mind cuddling up with a few of these on a cold night. Not my favorite RIS, but far from the worst. Actually the thinner body and dry finish make this more drinkable than most. I just wish they distributed to SEPA."
"This is a great brew. One to take home and meet the parents."
"Not a bad beer at all, certainly willing to drink more. All things considered, I would much prefer some other imperial stouts to this one."
"Thanks sebletitje for the share. Pours cola brown with an off-white head, and lots of yellow lacing upon swirling. Nose is wood, chocolate, vanilla, ripe fruit, and some coffee-ness. Flavor is similar to aroma profile with an additional chocolate and some coffee bitterness in the finish. I have to agree with sebletitje in that the barrel aged version is incredible..."
"D - once again Great Lakes produces a a stellar beer. This is definitely one of the better (if not the best) roasted barley heavy RIS I've ever had."
"D: I can think of nothing better to do in a blackout than polish of a sixer of this.. after all, wouldn't want it to go bad..."
"One of the better GL and stout brews, but not the best."
"Notes: great stout. Great Lakes does a good job with their beers in general. i wish people up here would catch on to GL, but it seems to be an Ohio staple, primarily"
"A very drinkable RIS, alcohol was undetectable in both the nose and flavor, only a pleasant warming. A well put together RIS, recommended, but nothing I'd get terribly excited about."
"I wish I could get this one, here in Oklahoma."
"D: I really liked this beer! I'm glad I have some more to drink. I'll probably get some more to cellar, since I'm not sure if I'll see it next year!"
"Ahhh. A nicely aged Blackout Stout. A lovely pour. Black with a nice tan head and sticky lacing. Aroma is fermented fruits, black currants, malt and just a slight touch of sourness. Flavor is outstanding. Not a hint!! I repeat!!! Not a hint of oxidation! Boozy dark fruits, rich malts, light molasses and hints of licorice. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich. I have had many stouts that have turned sour after aging but this is holding up great."
"Overall, this is a quite good beer and I would be interested to see how it ages and ages in the barrel. Either way, it is another Great Lakes beer that is good and I will continue to search for them when shopping."
"Some Russian imperial stouts receive praise for their intensity and brashness. Others however, are respected for their grace and finesse. This beer is definitely one of the latter. Overall, an incredibly well done version of the style."
"Cheers!!!"
"This one pours a dark dark brown, almost black, with a quarter inch head. Smells strongly of coffee and chocolate. Tastes solidly of coffee, some chocolate, and molasses, nice flavor. Mouthfeel is a tad watery for a stout, and as I worked my way through the beer, the taste seemed to get less interesting and more two-dimensional. Not all that complex. Not bad, but not stellar, either."
"Notes: I had ""rated"" this in the past and I do not think that I was ready for it then. Now I was ready to appreciate its greatness and it is that....great."
"A quality RIS from Great Lakes and a must try."
"Mmm this is good stuff. Very drinkable for a RIS, too. I need to get more."
"Pitch black coloured body with a nice dense light brown head. Aroma of strong roasted malt, milk, sour cherries and a bit of fresh hops. Full-bodied with an incredible first taste of oatmeal and coffee. The flavors bring a lot of roasted malt, chocolate, raisins and molasses. Aftertaste shows hints of alcohol, a bit of sweetness and a little hop even. A real nice beer."
"Black/brown pour with a small brown head arising. Smells nice and roasty with some coffee. Full bodied with little carbonation. Bakers chocolate, burnt malt, coffee. Finished surprisingly dry. Charcoal lingering. Not the most complex, but very good at what it does. Safe to classify this as worthy."
"Drinkability: Over 2 years beyond its best by date and still drinking superbly; a fine beer; I have tasted it fresh and it has quite a hop kick; I like it both fresh as well as cellared"
"D- Its higher ABV aside, this one goes down smooth and is a good session beer."
"Drinkability- With the mouthfeel and the good flavor this one is very drinkable and really seems less than it is alcohol wise. All around very good stout that I would have on hand at all times if I had acsess to it."
"D - This one is a little rough. More age might mellow it out some more or I might have just gotten an off bottle."
"Mouthfeel is full and somewhat heavy, very smooth."
"(rated Aug 17, 2008)"
"Pours the darkest chocolate color and is opaque in the glass. It could only muster a sheet of milk chocolate head that left moderate lacing. Smells strong of coffee with hint of chocolate and malts. Taste is stronger of chocolate with a nice bittersweet coffee finish. Drinkability is good with the 9% abv."
"D-9%---What? This drink pretty good! Alcohol is certainly present but it doesnt get in the way of enjoying this one. Nicely done, a RIS to be proud of."
"And the name of the brew reminds me of the miserable experience I had when the east coast (including Ohio and Michigan) was blacked out. I was on flight from San Francisco back home to Michigan. Somewhere over Wyoming, the captain announced, without explanation, that we were being rerouted to Minneapolis. They just dropped us all off at the gate at 8 pm without telling us why, and left us to our own devices. Upon learning I'd have trouble getting a flight to Detroit for at least two days, I just rented a car and drove straight through the night back to Detroit. Miserable at the time, but BO Stout helps erase the bad memories."
"This was a great beer but was overshadowed by the barrel-aged version which was delicious beyond belief."
"D - For the style, very!"
"I got this bottle in a trade but, yeah it had to happen, I forgot who the great trader was. Great choice, buddy!"
"D: A must have if you want to try an imperial stout...key word A (1 is more than ample in ones setting)"
"This stout poured a dark opaque black color with pecan brown highlights around the edges. It was capped off by a small dark brown head that left some incredible lacing for the entire beer. The smell is a combination of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, currants, and a certain nutty quality to is as well. The flavor profile follows the nice very nicely with upfront flavors of dark roasted grain, bitter chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, and anise. There is a hint of sweetness and smoke lingering on the back of the palate as well. I don't get any alchohol burn either from the 9%. The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy, but it still manages to render itself very smooth. Someone needs to tell this beer it has 9% ABV in it, because the way it drank I would have had many more of these. Excellent stout that I wish i could get in Indiana."
"This is a great beer. If you're looking for a great RIS that you could drink all night and still love, then this is your beer."
"Drinkability: A solid RIS, spicy, robust, flavorful, but not knock-you-on-your-ass-able - it's a mere 9.0%! Ok, that's still high, but, not for the style. A real tasty one, and worth seeking out - I'd love to try the barrel-aged version one day, as I'm sure that would really round out the flavor profile on this one. Give it a shot."
"Thank you much DavidEddie"
"Overall: very good beer"
"A solid RIS, but a little too basic for me. I'm ready to move on after half of it. Would probably go well with a cigarette."
"Overall: The best thing about this beer is the taste...which is remarkable! Other then that, the beer displays very average to above average qualities that a lot of RIS's out there have. A very good beer that is ""try it"" on my list. You won't be disapointed, but won't be blown away either."
"I'm smiling now."
"Overall, of the limited number of RIS I've had, this would probably be the most drinkable for me."
"D- one of my favorite RIS to date. i picked this up cheap because its past the breweries best by date, but this shows no signs of ruining. give this one a try, i can see why its in the top 100. great lakes shows its ability to master yet another style. if it wasnt so strong you could drink this one all day. the 12oz size makes it possible to have more than one, but not several."
"D: A must grab for the fans of the Russian Imperial Stouts."
"D- Easy to drink, nice solid RIS beer. Would be a great session beer."
"A black, opaque color, with a hint of red at the bottom of the glass. A coffee colored head forms, not thick, and dissolves away quickly. The scent of chocolate and coffee, followed by dried fruit, mostly currants and raisons, along with cream scent at the end. A malty strength in the taste at the start, bringing along the flavors of bitter chocolate and hearty dark bread flavor. Midway across a coffee bitterness comes out and ends with a mild citrus, with a touch of grassiness at the end. A thick, slick, and oily mouthfeel, with a mild warming sensation from alchol at the back of the throat. Man, this is a very good imperial stout, very good scent and flavor, makes this a must try beer."
"Sweeter than other imperial stouts I have had. Lots of alcohol finish."
"Very enjoyable brew. Though not a style which is meant to be sessionable by any mean, this is as easy to drink as any RIS. If my endorsement meant anything this is one I could get behind."
"Not a session beer but damn drinkable for an RIS."
"Drinkability: It grows on you as you sip it - an unusual RIS that doesn't quite deliver the richness I hope for in the style, but interesting nonetheless."
"D: It is the kind of beer you save for special occasions. Not a session beer but a great beer for any season and anytime you need a treat."
"D: A big beast. It goes great lengths to hide that, but in the end, the alcohol trumps. Easy does it, or it might hurt in the morning."
"D - Hides its alcohol level pretty well, and has all the characteristics of a solid RIS. Definately a beer worth seeking out."
"Overall, a nice example of a RIS."
"T: Medium body, very light carbonation, overall smooth mouthfeel with a pinch of hop bitterness in the finish. Finish remains slightly dry and earthy like the smell. Very strong roasted, burnt malt flavor. Complemented by espresso and dark chocolate flavor. Slight sweetness and dark fruitiness. Very nice balance of flavors without being overwhelming and well hidden alcohol. One of my favorite GLBC beers and an excellent RIS at the price and availability. A definite sipper, but still very drinkable. Hops have faded, but are still present, very nice at 6 months out."
"D: Delicious! I had never heard of this one and thought I would be underwhelmed, yet I find myself excited. Great stuff."
"Wow. This really is a great beer. Better than I could have imagined. Pitch black and light does not penetrate; Blackout Stout is properly named. Head rises nice and even like a low rumbling freight train as with all stouts, levels off about 1/2 inch then dissipates leaving a nice creamy top layer. The coffee and toffee taste hits first then immediately followed by bitter dark chocolate, it's truly delicious! Although the high Abv is readily present, it's not overwhelming. The texture is perfect, silky smooth just like a real Stout should be. Drinkability is not extremely high due to the high Abv, I would say enjoy just a couple and call it a night."
"dry, haevy rich and packed with aholcaol, notes of bitter chocalat and coffiee, this is 9% abv and no excuses, this is a siper for sure, i only wish that i cracked this one open in the fall or winter insted of an 80 digree day in summer. this one is one that i wish that i could have this around all the time."
"Received this one from ThirstyBird (thanks Rian). Best enjoyed by 08/02/08 indicated on the label. Served in my DFH snifter. Poured one shade shy of black; no light penetration on this one. Half-inch tan colored head lost cohesion and broke down into a skim of foam and ringlets leaving behind only specks of lacing as the brew receded. Nose suggests dark fruit and chocolate on a malt backbone. Taste reveals espresso and some chocolate flavors, followed by a charred finish; dark fruit is nowhere to be found. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied without being at all viscous with a bit of carbonation burn concentrated at the front of the tongue. Good drinkability. Very flavorful without being cloyingly sweet. Alcohol is well hidden for a 9% abv. A little lighter-bodied RIS puts this on the fringes of the style, but a very nice offering nonetheless."
"This is certainly an American interpretation, IMO, for the big and clean malt flavors. Blackout Stout is rich with roasted barley and dry dark chocolate flavors. As it warms there's a hint of the alcohol, but that's to be expected. The aroma smells sort of like toasted chocolate bread and there's also a great aftertaste that keeps the focus on the dry, dark grains along with a touch of chocolate liquor. A great beer."
"POurs jet black with a tannish color head. In the aroma, sweet oatmeal and a roasty malt. In the taste, chocolate, oatmeal, and a small hop note in the end. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry chocolate aftertaste. A very nice beer, big but not, nice small hop presence, and a big chocolate maltiness."
"Pours pitch black with a tan head. Nose is not very evident, but there is malt and coffee thing with some molasses. Flavor is smooth and fairly sweet with a bit of coffee on the back side. Molasses is there too. Thick and robust, but not massively complex. There has to be a load of alcohol in here because I am feeling the hit after a third of a pint, and I have only had a few beers tonight. Feel is slick on liquid and the carbonation is low but good. Nice to drink. A smooth and slick stout."
"I probably drink at least 2 or 3 of these at a sitting, but I would probably be happy to have the next day off from work. Deceptively drinkable, and I look forward to cellaring the other 3 from the 4-pack to see how they hold up after the recommended drinking time of 8/18/08."
"This is a fantastic imp stout. Wish I had more. Will be seeking out again."
"Seasonal brew from Great Lakes, I was looking forward to it's release and grabbed a four pack soon after they hit the shelves. Great Lakes makes some very nice beers including this Imperial Stout. The beer is dark black once poured into my glass a thick head is formed. The head does become much thinner, but it sticks around for the duration of the brew which is highly unusual for a strong imperial stout, a real nice touch. There is moderate lacing. The aroma is a usual mix of roasted malts with touches of coffee and hops, but then the chocolate malts come alive and seem to dominate the thick aroma. Aside from the abundance of chocolate malts the alcohol can actually be detected with the nose, it seems to let you know that this beer needs to be enjoyed slowly. The mouthfeel is the one aspect where this beer falls short of greatness. There is an immediately recognized thinness to the beer especially thin for an imperial stout. The finish is satisfying and relatively smooth. Great taste with this one. All of the dark roasted malts create a nice flavor that is accented with a generous amount of hops that lead right into a well deserved bitter aftertaste. The chocolate malts also stand out in the overall flavor, but the coffee is more abundant than originally detected with the aroma. For an Imperial Stout Great Lakes has created a wonderful example, not the best around but surely worth trying. 5/12/06...Enjoyed the other two tonight mixed in with some other cellared Impy Stouts. Wow I upped my ratings in a couple categories, and for good reason. This is the most Aggressive Stout I have had, Absolutely killer."
"T/M/D: creamy chocolate, not too sweet or bitter, and a little alcoholic fruit. The roastiness really comes through at the end. Aftertaste is roasted grains or roasted coffee beans. It's a light roast, though. Not too much carbonation. Very drinkable. This is a nice, well-balanced stout and I could sip one after another."
"Thanks again Deniz!"
"It's dark, but there's no head to it as it sits in my snifter. Big tones of baker's chocolate and mild coffee beans in the nose. It hints vanilla and bourbon too. As I taste the beer, I am moved by the biting alcohol, the layers of semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate, echos reminiscent of Kahlua, and hot vanilla. Roasted flavors are powdery on the palate and the hops are kept in check. The beer gives my tongue a prickly feel. Delicious."
"This beer poured with no head whatsoever - it had a small patch of froth in the center of glass and a ring of tiny bubbles along the sides of the glass which was tan-brown. The beer color was brunette/near black. The aroma had a hint of coffee, and I do not like bean juice. The taste had a hint of coffee, so it was not to my particular fancy...however, the taste was so slight that I could drink the whole 12 oz. myself without concern. The feel of the beer after swallow was a hallo of tingling about the other rim of my tongue with the hint of coffee hitting the tip. Not bad, but I personally prefer less coffee flavoring and smell for my beverage of chose."
"Solidly great on all counts, a wonderful brew."
"D- Strong flavor and thickness makes this a once a nigt beer. A great finisher to a dinner with a chocolate, but not something you could drink more than once in one night and enjoy it."
"D : Love it and would love to have more. With the alcohol, probably wouldn't go for too many in one night though."
" This really is a very easy drinking stout because of it's light body but some time in the dungeon might turn this one into a real beast."
"For the wallop and extra full flavor of this offering it is very clean drinking. One of the best...this is prime real estate."
"Not the absolute best RIS, but it's still great and among the best."
"D - I'd have another. But a 6 pack?"
"Thanks to dschuster03 for trading me this brew to taste."
"pours a dark cola, minimal head. Nose- mild roast, dark fruits. Taste- powder chocolate with more dark fruits (plums, etc), with a roasty slightly hot finish. Very dry finish. Medium to moderate carbonation. Pretty straightforward yet enjoyable imperial stout."
"D--It's a bit too alcoholic to be an easy drinker, but it makes a fantastic sipper. One and done for me, but I'll be back the next night."
"Overall Great Lakes makes great stuff, but for me who is not a huge stout fan this was almost too dark and deep for me. I would much rather have more hops to help balance this out in my eyes. Still, this is a well made beer, just not really one of my favorites."
"Blackout pours a deep mahogany brown with a big tan head. Nothing is visible through this guy when held to the light, bright brown highlights shine through the bottom of the glass. The beer smells of semi-sweet roasted/burnt malts with a really balancing fruity note. The stout is big and burnt, fully body of malts, caramel, molasses, hints of licorice, toffee, coffee, and dark chocolate. A warming alcohol presence and hop bitterness linger through out. Toasty malts and bitterness stay with you for a long finish. Blackout is a heavy, coating, lingering stout meant for the serious beer drinker. I sampled this one with my buddies who aren't stout fans. Safe to say this one was not the favorite of the night... IMO this beer goes down very easy, surprisingly easy for such a meaty stout, very well done!"
"D = An excellent beer,, high drinkability, I could imagine coming back to this time and time again, only marking it down for somewhat average standard smells and slight lack of mouthcoating because in the end they detract just enough to keep this from being an exceptional beer all around."
"Overall, I've had this many times, but never on tap. It was much smoother, if a little less hoppy that out of a bottle. But it was a great treat to find, and was the perfect night cap to a long day."
"D - Great beer. I love stouts."
"Drinkability? Warm enough for winter but tasty enough for year around imbibing. Great beer."
"D - Yes. Easy drinking for the ABV."
"D: Extremly drinkable. A great stout that if i couldn't only get it up north, I'd buy all the time. I couldn't think of anything better than downing a few bottles of this and passing out when the power is knocked out!"
"Drinkability - I wish I had this to pass the hours when the lights are out during summer storms. I would stare at the wall and drink bottle after bottle till the lights come on. As a matter of fact i'm gonna trade for a 4 pack of these bad boys, then go blow out my local power station. Wonderful compilation."
"This beer was poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. The color is as black as the name promises and is adorned with a tan head that dissipates to a thick rings sending wisps across the top of the beer and lacing the sides of the glass. The aroma is pretty much dominated by roasted barley...very nice for an imperial stout. The taste also rushes forth with roasted barley and a bit of sweet chocolate. The sweetness never really takes off though because the hops provide enough bitterness to balanced it out and bite your tongue. The body is rather medium, not quite full bodied, and it is a bit drying. The carbonation is a bit lively as well. Overall, a very tasty and drinkable RIS. I would certainly not say no to another one. I like the roasted character, but in my opinion, the body of the beer is a bit off and I prefer a sweeter RIS, but that is just my preference."
"D: Drinkability is fairly good and this is a very good, though not great, stout in my book. Recommended."
"Overall, this is a fucking brutal stout with intense coffee tastes."
"Poured almost black with thin brown head that lingered a little while. Aroma was of dark roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, and coffee. Flavor was an exquisite blend of all of the above. Mouthfeel was thick and satisfying. Drinkability was good for a beer of this alcohol content. This was a fantastic beer."
"This is unlike any stout I've ever tasted. It's almost like a revved-up porter because of the roastiness. Great beer."
"Fairly drinkable for a stout."
"D - Easy to drink at 9%. Not as complex as other RIS but very smooth and drinkable. Strange how the aroma is such a smooth chocolate/espresso and the taste is big and roasty."
"D: The super burnt roasty tastes knock the drinkability down a little bit for me but a really solid RIS."
"D- Very drinkable for a stout and a 9% at that. If it were locally available, I'd likely buy this often."
"D - Pretty drinkable for 9%. A fine example of a big stout."
"Great Lakes has crafted another wonderful brew. For some reason this beer didn't resonate with me quite like I had hoped, but there's no denying it's tasty stuff."
"Don't like it as much as Eddie Fitz, Nosferatu, or the Christmas Ale, but its in the top half of the Great Lakes Beers."
"Drinkability: Though I could use a bit more fullness to the body, it's still a very good stout. Good one, Great Lakes."
"Drinkability: If I had to pick two beers this reminded me of, it would be a cross between the old-school bottle-conditioned Storm King (because goddamn it just ain't the same it used to be) and Siberian Night. Visceral enough for those craving burnt and roasted flavors, with enough sweetness and creaminess to keep you coming back. Still, it's a singular and great version of the style, one I wish I could get in bottles during the season. Glad I finally got to try it, and it was definitely worth it."
"This beer didnt wow me, but it was flavorful and drinkable. Sometimes imperial stouts can be a bit syrupy for my taste, but this one is a welcome change from that trend."
"D. I had two durring this session and I thought that was perfect.It's a sipper and thats the way I like it."
"Very easy to drink, the flavor in this beauty would make ignore the the ABV if available in quantity here. Well put together RIS!"
"A real sipper of a beer-- no need to have more than two, but an absolutely fantastic experience; a Russian Imperial Stout at the top of its game. Great offering by GLBC."
"An all right beer. I kept getting the impression that this was a double version of Ed Fitz. Oh well. Not my favorite for the style by far."
"Thanks to roymunson for this! Poured from the bottle into a snifter. Extremely dark with no head. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, toffee and alcohol. Tastes pretty much exactly how it smells, with the alcohol being hidden better. There's also a quite pleasant underlying sweetness to the taste, which is countered by a bitterness from what tastes like roasted malts. Mouthfeel is fairly thick and chewy. I can only picture myself drinking one of these in a sitting, so drinkability isn't very high. Overall this is a nice RIS."
"Got to have this on tap at Brazenhead. Poured into an imperial pint glass. Poured a cascading dark as night color with a tan head that lingered in the glass. Smell is dark roasted malt with hints of coffee, and chocolate. Taste is rich with those aromas present on the palate. Mouth feel is full and sparkles in the mouth. One of my favorite stouts just the right combination of everything."
"Everything is present, especially as it warms in the mouth, but nothing is overpowering and it's all very balanced. The finish is clean and slightly bitter, and the body is on the heavy side of medium. The ABV is warming but not too potent, and there's no trace of esters or phenols. This is a superb RIS that's perfect for a cold winter night by the fire. Bold and tasty, but not breaking the style anywhere. One of my top five RIS."
"Pours opaque black with a good fluffy white head that dissipates in about 5 minutes and leaves good lace. Nose is mostly roasted malt and has a significant but not overpowering coffee presence and slight chocolate. Taste pretty much follows, some chocolate, coffee is there, Roasted malts, slight smoke and some vanilla. A good subtle hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but still pretty good. Drinkability is second to only a select few here, very very good. Overall this is a wonderfully balanced beer, and one that would defenitely be a go to if it was available here. yet another good one from great lakes, a brewery you don't hear alot about but should. Great brew, would love to try the barrel aged, and am excited to try one of the three bottles in the cellar after some time. Great beer."
"This is just a really solid RIS and one that I really look forward to each year. I'm glad that I was able to get out there in time to still have some on draft. Packed with bold flavors and a beefy, warm feel, it still stays pretty quaffable for its size. Great stuff as usual from the GLBC."
"Definitely did not live up to the hype. Something just off with the taste. I will certainly grab one the next time I see it to give it a second shot."
"Poured a thick, deep black with a pinky of coffee tan head. Good retention and nice lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, dark fruits, toasted malt, coffee, floral hops, alcohol warmth, and Cleveland air. Tastes of creamy cappuccino, milk chocolate, cherries, raisins, dark chocolate, and more coffee bitterness in the finish mixing with a slight citrus presence and alcohol warmth. Medium full body, sticky but smooth and creamy with a nice bitter finish. A little high on the sweetness but good stuff with a solid bitterness that overtakes most of the alcohol presence."
"A must-try beer, for certain, but my stout experience has widened in the 3 years since i've had this one, and it's fallen a bit due to a lack of complexity and drinkability."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a black/deep brown color with a good head. Smells like roasted malt, coffee, with a little bit of bourbon/alcohol as an afterthought. Taste is very balanced between the hops and the malts. Somewhat of a basic stout taste with roasted malts being the primary taste coming out. Overall, a good stout. I've had better, but this is certainly not second tier."
"The beer was black in color and poured a 3/4"" brown head that slowly dissipated. The nose was filled with bitter chocolate and coffee (general coffee, not expresso and anything heavy). In it is smooth and balanced with good richness. The flavors are similar to the nose with some added bourbon notes. This is a very well made and enjoyable Imperial Stout. Well done."
"Pours a completely black with a nice 1 finger light/brown head with a subtle amount of lacing. Smells mostly of roasted coffee and bitter cocoa. The taste is really nice. Very flavorful semisweet chocolate and roasted grains. Nice bitter aftertaste leaves you wanting more. Mouthfeel was slightly too carbonated and not as smooth as expected. A little on the thin side as well. Alcohol was nicely masked and therefore I'd say I could easily make this a session brew. Overall, a very solid stout, but not my favorite. I will buy again."
"Mouthfeel lacks some of the heftiness in body that I expect from a top-notch imperial stout. Carbonation is a little low. This hurts the mouthfeel but boosts the drinkability."
"This is a smooth Imperial Stout which is interesting enough with its characteristics, but I wouldn't say differentiates itself enough from others of the style to truly stand out. A good seasonal offering nonetheless and especially designed for colder weather."
"Drink ability: I could put down one or two of these but that is it. This a beer I want to share with friends. And, honestly let sit for while. I look forward to having another one down the road... And thanks to JohnGalt1 I'll get that opportunity."
"I think this is very good, but getting it once a year is probably fine with me. It's in that bad price range where I could pay more for something that I definitely like better, or pay less for something good, but not quite this good. This is better than Old Rasputin, but that's a lot cheaper. Southern Tier Choklat is better, but more expensive. Anyway, fans of big stouts need to try this regardless."
"Overall: The bartenders favorite beer apparently. I enjoyed it as I do love stouts, and this one tastes very much like a russian stout. Pretty amazing."
"Blackout stout is a decent RIS. Mellower than a Stormking, and not AS bitter as some other RISs out there, I would like to see a little more balance between coffee and the bitter roasted flavor. The aroma is misleading and I wish that it tasted more like it smells."
"Huge thanks to Tilley4.. Jason is an awesome trader... we must do it again ... soon!"
"The body is closer to mid and to me is where this beer falls off. To start there is a good malt texture but the finish is just wispy/watery and lacks that depth. Almost like an American stout than Imp/Double Stout. There are some good textures, a silky finish, but I am looking for more. Overall good but could use some help."
"GLBC does it again...and does it very well. Get a bottle if you can, or, better yet, hit the brewpub to sample it from the tap."
"D: a very smooth stout, especially for being 9%. I could drink this consistantly."
"Sips really well, not a bad RIS would drink another one if I had it"
"Overall, a very different kind of RIS. Reminds me a lot of an Irish Dry Stout. Surprisingly refreshing, and very drinkable."
"Thanks to hoppymeal, grub, cartdan, and DrJay for a bottle each."
"You can't go wrong with Great Lakes. Excellent stout."
"D - a hearty, good drinking stout"
"Poured this beer into my Chimay chalice. It pours an opaque black that shows ruby hues when held up to the light. The head was just a thin layer of beige that dissipated into nothingness within a few seconds. No retention whatsoever. The aroma isn't as big as may RIS's. Definite notes of roasted malts, chocolate and what reminds me of sour pie cherries. Taste is pretty straight forward also. It's really big up front with a huge roasted grain flavor that settles on the back of your tongue and lingers for a while. Then comes the bitter chocolate, black licorice and sour cherries. This has a really good flavor but nothing is over whelming like with many RIS's. The alcohol is very mellow only coming out in the very end of the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking. I enjoy big, chewy, beers. All in all this is a highly drinkable RIS. This is the first Russian Imperial Stout, that I think I could sit back and drink (or try to drink) a whole sixer."
"D- This will probably be the last time I get this. There are many more superior Russian Imperial Stouts out there. It is decent... but maybe I am just spoiled."
"I got this bottle as an extra from kirok1999 and poured it into a 10oz Sam Smith nonic. Dark black with red tints at the edge of the glass so I guess it isn't a blackout after all. There is a ""sticky"" smell to it if that makes any sense and maybe yeasty dough. The flavor has a hoppiness to it and is pretty good, not too thick or syrupy at all. Very easy to drink. This is my first Great Lakes beer and it is pretty good, I'll have to check out their other offerings."
"Addendum: Aging this one for a year significantly improves drinkability, losing the alcohol bite, although malts still feel a bit too ""charred"". In a direct comparison with the barrel aged, both being aged, it is significantly ""worse""."
"Drinkability- This is a VERY pleasurable stout. Just the right amount of chocolate, just enough coffee, just enough warmth. Great Lakes has done a damn good job on this stout. It is no surprise that this beer is so in demand by the masses."
"Nice imperial stout."
"D- Very nice and smooth. I don't think I could put a whole lot of these down at one time but again a nice brew."
"Maybe I just need to let it sit for a bit and try again in 6 months or 1 year. I'll know better by then if I just had an off night."
"Drinks very well. Not overly syrupy with a really nice finish. A little heavy to drink a lot, but very sippable. Nice overall quality."
"M/D: No carbonation to speak of, extremely creamy and smooth. Feels quite nice. Couldn't have more than a few of these as they're very heavy in the stomach and dry the palate."
"Overall = This was like drinking a ""cafe mocha"" in a bottle. It was one of the best RIS that I've ever had. Unfortunately, this is not distributed in my state, so I hope to be able to get my hands on this a few times a year."
"A must-have RIS."
"Notes - Above average but perhaps not world-class."
"No more dissing Lebron,no more Indians bashing and no more, mistake by the lake smacktalk.Cleveland Rocks!This years batch,just hit Detroit last week and I will be going back for more.Pours black,not much head and really nothing in the way of lacing.Nice smell,nothing superb.Pick up a little coffee some dark chocolate.Taste is were its at,baby!Give me an IV and I could live off this stuff.Not too heavy.Not too light.Heavier with the dark chocolate and a twinge of coffee.A perfect blend.I've got to be careful with drinkability.It goes down so smoothly,naptime could creep up quickly."
"Magnificent. I ran back to the store to buy more. Pours a solid, opaque black, dark tan head. Really nothing fantastic in the smell but the taste is tremendous. Chocolate and coffee mingled together that stays throughout the start, middle and end. Incredibly drinkable. I'll probably have another right after this."
"D- if there is an RIS that is good enough and not too heavy to drink one after another this is definitely it. Really the whole package just makes me want to have another and I have to say that I actually feel like I could. Probably not the best tasting or the most complex stout but definitely one of the most drinkable that I have ever had especially at only like 9.99 a 4 pack before taxes!"
"D - Drinkability is very good. Everything comes together in this beer with good balance and makes it go down very easy. Another success for Great Lakes."
"Smooth and creamy with just the right amount of moderate carbonation to lift the texture a bit and appear rather bright initially. A hint of warmth and syrupy substance to coat the tongue and create a satisfying stout body. A fantastic selection to be sure, and still welcomed even once spring had sprung."
"D: An after dinner sipper, for sure. Good for the style"
"Thick, viscous, and sticky chewy on the palate. Pretty damn drinkable and a great RIS. Alcohol warmth all the way to the belly and up to the ears and cheeks. Thanks again Bryan."
"D_Very drinakable and a tasty overall stout without being too extreme. Well done."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, which is no big surprise for the style, and the drinkablity is great. I had this when I first purchased the four pack, and while is was really good, I have to say that I think I actually preferred this one with a touch over a year on it. Just fantastic."
"A sublime RIS. Very complex. Definitely a sipper. Waited a long time to try this and was definitely worth it. Hope I can find another 4 pack - will definitely hoard some of these."
"Overall, a great beer by Great Lakes and highly recommended. I really can't wait to see what happens to this beer with a little age on it, as the hops start to disappear. I plan on laying some of these down to see what happens to them in a year or two."
"D: Tasty and pretty easy to drink but lacks a bit of hop balance."
"Big thanks to DrBayern for this gem! Shared with pint_sized - Black pour with a nice medium brown head in a snifter. Smell was a creamy chocolately coffee roast with almost a hint of peanut buttery creaminess...(maybe I'm just crazy) Such a nice, smooth roasty chocolate flavor, with a light but noticeable and pleasant alcohol flavor to it. A great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation level let it go down like smooth chocolate. Really a great beer, with an amazingly smooth light lingering aftertaste of fine bittersweet dark chocolate. A must try!"
"D- ah, the breaks. just like all these imperials that might be the best tasting beers ever, due to the sheer magnitude of what's put into them, there D is at a D-crease because they're so damn...so damn everything! high abv, high nutritional content, my body says ""i'm full, lets take a nap"" instead of ""yeah! let's party and drink 8 more!!"" what you lack in quantity, you make up for in quality."
"This one certainly packs a punch and should be imbibed slowly. Another fine offering from the people in Cleveland and will enjoy it the rest of the winter."
"D: If this weren't 9% and so damn rare, I could drink this nightly. I had been looking forward to breaking this out for a while."
"This stout pours pitch black (hence the name) with a very smooth , one inch tan head. The smell is a very strong coffee and chocolate. The taste is a burnt darker chocolate with a sweet and slightly bitter aftertaste. Very strong flavor and yet there is a smoothness to it. Difficult to explain clearly which is why this stout is a must try."
"-Jonathan Passow"
"Drinkability: Drinkable in that it is in no way overpowering, but the astringency gets a bit in the way."
"Drinkability: Chocolate? Good. Coffee? Good. Fruit bomb red wine? Good. I would use this beer to fill my RIS cravings often if price and availability weren't an issue."
"Eric"
"Taste- sweet front, hoppy middle with a smooth, sweet, slightly hoppy finish. Bittersweet chocolate dominated the mouthfeel. Hints of creamy vanilla. Hoppier than most RIS I have tried, and I like it! Really looking forward to the 2008 release."
"Very drinkable beer for 9% abv. Goes down quite easily but the alcohol will smack you around after a while. Another great beer from Great Lakes. I wish we could get their beers in NC. Many thanks to JDiflorio for sending this one my way."
"Very good, but not epic."
"d:Thanks to hoppymeal for the chance to try this one. This is a pretty good RIS, but I won't look for it again."
"Overall, I pretty good RIS. There are so many great ones there is some stiff competition. This beer does hold up to the best of the best though."
"Not bad; I'm not much of a stout drinker, but this definitely tops Guinness and Beamish ANY day of the week!"
"Wanted to try this one before I broke out the barrel aged version I just got in a trade, very good overall and highly recommended, another good brew from Great Lakes, too bad this is so expensive around me because it is not supposed to be available here or I would drink this more often, nice beer to have on a cold night like yesterday"
"Okay here it goes my first review.This was from a 12 oz. bottle in a pint glass.Apperence a very dark rich black with a thin almond colered head with a small amount of lacing to the finish.Smell was slighty toastey to burnt with moderate alcohol.Taste got the alcohol up front but a good balance of malt and hops.Drinkability is good for a cold night like tonight but no more than two will warm you up quite nicely."
"D- Great on a cold winter night, a sipping beer that is fantastic"
"Definitely a good RIS. This is a damn good beer."
"Black in appearance with a khaki head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of coffee, bitter dark chocolate, roasty malts, and some light smoke. Tastes like it smells. Has a very rich quality to it. There is definitely some alcohol warming after each sip. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Drinkability is great for cold weather enjoyment. Recommended."
"Edit: review of an in date bottle: I'd have to agree with my previous review, and add that the licorice flavor and very full mouthfeel are very satisfying. The 9% abv is well hidden, so this would be dangerously drinkable, if it weren't so filling. Ever eat real pecan pie or a rich cheese cake? You can only handle so much of those before becoming sated. I'm not saying that Blackout is cloyingly sweet .. just very filling. It's a wonderful drinking experience, fresh, or with a bit of age on it."
"Taste - bitter, unsweetened baker's chocolate with a ton of warming alcohol notes, a bit of raisin & fig, and hint of roasted, sweet malts. Mouthfeel is quite acrid and a bit dry, but packs a fantastic, bitter chocolate finish. All in all, Blackout is one of the better RIStouts I've had. Very drinkable for its style...I'll have this again for sure."
"It's sad to see one of my cellar staples go, but drinking this is a phenomenal experience. And it ages well. I need to find more of this. And soon."
"drinkability - Nice stout, great to have with a nice steak.One of the best stouts I have tasted."
"Overall: Thanks to Faro for this treat. It is great. I am drinking the 06 right now. I will add a review for the 05 in a few days when I drink that."
"Hops are still there, but way in the back. Subdued bitterness results, meshing well with the charred malts in the middle. Earthiness lingers well into the finish, with a mild coffee bean presence. Dark baker's chocolate runs through the whole experience, very tasty and satisfying. Nutty and dry in the finish, which lasts for a good while. Any notion of alcohol heat has been subdued, but it still packs some strength. Creamy feel to it...easy to get lost with this one."
"Pours black as night with the slightest ruby hue if held to a strong light. A finger of off white head that dies quick and lacing occurs. Smells very roasty, sweet chocolate and bakers chocolate and a hint of cherry like fruity aroma. Taste is big on the roast, very tasty, the chocolate shows and the fruit drops an extremely subtle hint. Smooth as silk in the mouth with a tickle of carbonation and slightest hop bite on the finish. No ABV apparant and this one is very drinkable. A must try."
"Notes: First beer I have had from Great Lakes and I am impressed. Whatever the midwest has going on, please send some my way because I haven't had something from that region that I haven't enjoyed. In an area so rich with WONDERFUL imperial stouts I hope this one doesn't sit in the shadows."
"Highly recommended. This is up there with the best of them. Bell's Expedition is still better by a touch, but I would love to have this available in CA!"
"D - An excellent imperial stout, strong and luxurious with relatively complex flavors."
"Drinkability: Very nice.... a well done RIS... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I'll have to take my three favorite RIS's and do a side by side comparison sometime.... GLBC Blackout Stout, Hoppin' Frog B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher, and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout.... all pretty even in my book...."
"(... so far--still haven't tried the 3X Floyd Breakfast, on my to-do list, nor any of the non-bottled West coast champions, FWIW, which isn't much. Life is way too short. Quick disclaimer: I have not otherwise made the exclamation, ""best beer ever," and I make this statement carefully, soberly, and sincerely.)"
"I actually said this out loud so I thought it would be right for the review, this is a good freakin stout."
"Good as extra from Faro - many thanks! Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date of 8/2 so just passed but no biggie into a pint glass. Pitch black color even against a light. It had a smaller than expected brown head that quickly settled into a collar with a little foam in center. The aroma was strong on coffee with some roasted malts and a good whiff of alcohol. I liked the Siberian Night aroma much better. The taste pretty much followed the smell and was heavy on coffee and roasted malts. Alcohol was a player but not too overbearing. Mouthfeel was heavy and creamy with pleasing aftertaste. Drinkability is high on this one. Not an everyday beer but could see drinking this ofter during the winter months. Overall, an excellent beer worthy of its top 100 ranking. Highly recommend. (4.5, RR, T, Y)"
"Mouthfeel is thick, rich, heavy, sweet, syrupy, roasty, molasses filled, boozy, with a touch of coconut milk. Delicious stuff."
"Mouthfeel is again like a high quality Arabian coffee. Powdery. Chocolate milk."
"Deep black in color with a nice sized cocoa head on top. Nice level or roasted aroma and a somewhat coffeeish tinge. Deliciously decadent and rich roasted flavor. Burnt coffee taste to it that is quite nice. Lingering roasted flavors. Just a whisper of alcohol to boost the overall picture. Great body. Very full but balanced against the level of flavor. Just a great beer all around. Had wanted to try this one for ages. Right up there with my perennial favorite Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout."
"drinkability is mediocre. the alcohol and unbalanced flavors take away from the wonderful aroma of this brew."
"Smell is like strong roasted coffeebeans, sweet,sun-dried prune and cherry....and you can pick up on the semi-sweet chocolate as well. Pours a huge, well-retaining greyish/tan head. There are only little flakes of deep red at the side of this glass...the rest is pitch black. The taste is hoppier than most stouts....and the chocolate jumps way out to say hello. Then the mouthfeel takes over with it's oily, flavor-holding beauty. The finish is bitter chocolate and banana and back comes the sweet-dried fruit. Leaves a nice itch on my throat. Thank you sir may I have another. Another strong effort...but a touch behind thier porter on my list. Low carbonation and great taste make this a dangerously drinkable brew @ this ABV."
"Drinkability: Outstanding for a stout. What a great beer."
"D: It's allright, not the best RIS out there for sure. I guess I expected more from it being in the top 100. A good beer, it tastes good, would have it again, it just didn't live up to my expectations."
"Pours out black as night, with some toast-colored head that vanishes pretty fast. Decent lacing as the level drops. Looks good. Smells of dark roasted java, and bitter chocolate. Enticing. Hints of alcohol too. Upon the first sip I really hit by dark chocolate and licorice. It makes me think of ripened cherries, too. Lingering dark bitterness hangs on at the end. It's really quite good. It has a nice consistency, too - not syrupy thick, but it has some chewy moments in the mouth. The high alcohol would keep me from packing in a lot of it, but it's a pleasing brew."
"Overall, a good brew. I prefer my stouts with a lower ABV, but this is an IMPERIAL stout so it is being true to its style."
"Pours an opaque black with a one finger tan head that dies down to a thin lacing for the rest of the time. Stickiness is decent, nothing to go crazy about. I absolutely love this smell, almost like an oatmeal stout. Very sweet milk chocolate odor with a sweet oat background. Hints of coffee and espresso as well, can't detect any alcohol in the nose at all. Taste, wow...very balanced. Starts off with roasted malt then the coffee flavor dominates the tongue. Towards the end, hops emerge and balance out this one very well. This might be my favorite tasting Imperial Stouts by far. So smooth for 9% abv. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation, just enough for this style. Taste keeps getting better and better as the temperature rises. Drinkability is amazing. Pick this one up for sure."
"Hands down one of, if not the best RIS out there. The only thing that makes this more enjoyable is a bath in a Jim Beam barrel which is completely sublime. So recommended, if I had the money, I'd buy it for you. Never pass this one up."
"D - Very complex and balanced stout"
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. This Imperial Stout poured a solid black with a thick tan head that slowly faded away, leaving some excellent lacing around the glass. Just a bit of light is visible through the beer. The beer has nice big chocolate aroma, with notes of lightly roasted malts and some hop undertones. The flavor has quite a bit going on. You can taste cherries, milk chocolate, hints of coffee, and a touch of alcohol. I really enjoyed the flavor of this brew. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with a healthy dose of carbonation. Just a little bit thinner than I would prefer. The thin mouthfeel and unwanted level of carbonation are my only complaints. Overall, a very well done stout."
"Served at cellar temperature into my Oversized snifter, from a 12 oz. bottle. Poured a deep, spent motor oil black that no light could pass through. Just about an inch of thick coffee brown head rose from the glass. Head slowly settled into impressive lacing. Smell was of fine milk chocolate, freshly brewed coffee, some subtle hop tones, and a smooth touch of vanilla, not bad at all. Taste was of Espresso, chocolate, some woold like flavors, vanilla, some hops, and a little alcohol burn at the back of my throat. The smell was better than the taste in my opinion, but still had a great flavor to it. Mildly carbonated with plenty of warming alcohol. Had a somewhat thick and full mouthfeel to it. Seemed pretty well balanced. Very drinkable. A pretty solid beer in my book,"
"A nice chocolatey treat. Nice combination of coffee and chocolate flavors. A fine RIS that would start a session off quite well. Recommended."
"Very nice stout. Quite drinkable despite ABV and body. Marred, IMO, by just a touch too much carbonation. I would certainly drink again, glad I got a 4 pack."
"I received a few bottles of this in BIFs, thanks everyone!"
"Bottle courtesy of Jdoolin : Poured a deep black color stout with a nice foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of chocolate and coffee malt is well balance with a medium hoppy finish. Taste is really well balance between chocolate malt, some dry roasted malt and a medium bitter finish. Body was quite full with some adequate carbonation. Overall, I thought this was well done and alcohol was not perceptible. I might have lack some complexity but it was still quite enjoyable."
"This is a fantastic brew that really brings out the deep roasted and chocolate flavors that stouts should have. The roasted malt bitterness makes up for the fact that it isn't as hoppy as I would have personally liked. Perfect with a small piece of dark chocolate."
"D: Definitely an awesome stout. Great Lakes did nothing out of the ordinary but did everything right with this one. A few more sips into it and the alcohol presence was starting to bring this beer down, which surprises me since this is only a 9% abv beer. Even though one is enough for a sitting, I will be revisiting this one."
"Many thanks to Mike (mcallister) for the brew, sent in the SimplyBeer BIF."
"I gave it's drinkability high just for taste alone, and all you need is a 4-pack, because it has such a high alcohol percentage. If your drinking just for taste, than this is highly drinkable. Just take your time with this beer."
"The drinkability was excellent. You don't taste the strong alcohol at all. I would prefer it to be a tad bit sweeter, but that's just me."
"D: Excellent stout. One I would love to have more of."
"Mouthfeel has a thin creaminess to it. Smooth but not heavy. Goes down very easy. This was a great experience. I would love to get this more often."
"Overall, a very good RIS."
" Drinkability - very easy to drink, alcohol is well hidden and could be a problem because this is a tasty sessionable brew."
"Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth. Moderate carbonation. Very drinkable."
"It's medium bodied, with a bit of a syrupy character. Not a lot of complexity in terms of experiencing different sensations and or flavor on different points of the palate, but enough flavor emerge to keep it intersting. Very drinkable stout. Very solid overall, and one I find to be a good ""summer"" stout, but not earth shattering."
"It's quite drinkable. I am enjoying the 9% ABV. Nicely done. What do you do for an encore?"
"Drinkability: It's rich, but blunt. And not very complex for what it is. Unmasked notes of alcohol hinder it. Otherwise it's a decent sipper for a cool autumn or winter night."
"I was actually quite impressed with this beer. I thought I had tried it before. Either I am mistaken or it is much improved!"
"Now if I could just find somewhere in Chicago that sells it..."
"Pitch black body with a off white one finger head and some thick lacing .Dark fruits,roasted malts and some carmel come to my nose.Dark fruit taste(plums,raisons,prunes)Very smooth nitro? mouthfeel and very creamy also.Awesome RIS I love it.Taste almost like one of my favoreit RIS but with alot more kick.It never gets overly boozy and hard to drink.Great tasting."
"This one pours a thick black with a dark brown head. The smell is very inviting and has multiple flavors coming through. There are some sweet notes of vanilla and chocolate, and some dark malt characteristics. The taste follows suit and does not overpower for a RIS. I am impressed with the balance of taste and smell with the ABV, you get the warming sensation of a high alcohol beer without the overpowering alcohol taste that drowns out the subtle flavors that this beer delivers. The mouthfeel is good, it has a small hoppy bite at the beginning that adds another layer to this great brew. This one is easy to drink and is an overall great RIS and a great beer. Definitely worth checking out. Enjoy."
"D - Overall this was awesome. A very classic big stout that made me smile. I really enjoyed this and must say it definatly lived up to expectations. I have to give much props to this, full in every sense of the word."
"Exceptional pour, thick viscous black with a one to two inch offwhite head that fades fairly quickly to a rim, but leaves some great lacing. Smell is a little lighter than I'd like, but with figs, lightly roasted grain, and vanilla. Taste is rich, slightly sweet with creamy chocolate, some smooth tasting roasted grains, vanilla, and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is incrdibly smooth and creamy, like a milkshake- phenomenal! Unbelievably drinkable for an Imperial Stout with a respectable abv. A great product, and one of the easiest drinking RIS that I've had that still has some body and flavor."
"Flavors follow the aroma in complexity and richness. Roasted bitterness up front followed by chewy malts: chocolate, stewed fruits, rum, scorched sugar, peat bog. Just delicious. Rich, sweet and roasty malt flavors swell mid-palate before dark/baking chocolate bitterness joins in and a renewed, strong coffee flavor develops. This roasted bitterness dries the finish out a little and complements the earlier sweet malt nicely. Hints of flint and smoke in there as well. Long, slightly warming finish, though the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Full-bodied with a chewy feel. Very well made and extremely drinkable."
"D: Solid example for the style-I'm going to give it some time to see how it ages."
"D: At 9%, this is not a beer to pound but every sip of the pint was delicious."
"Cheers!"
"Wow. That was excellent. Time certainly tames the savage beast that is Blackout Stout, but a new animal emerges. I enjoyed this very much, and wish I had more to enjoy. It grew & changed with each taste and showed a lot of character, body and substance. I would recommend this regardless, but if you can cellar a 4-pack away and try some at 6 month intervals I think you will really enjoy that last one 24 months from now. A very enjoyable beer experience and one I highly recommend."
"Thanks to ThomasHardy for the trade. The beer poured a deep opaque black with a thin head that slowly diminished and left no lacing. The aroma was dominated by dark bitter chocolate, roasted coffee, and of course, roasted barley. The taste possessed all these characteristics as well with a profound dryness. The beer was light on the palate for one so strong and the alcohol was mostly well hidden. This is a very great imperial stout"
"D- As much as I would like to, this one is not for drinking all night. The alcohol is well hidden, but the burnt overtones can be somewhat overbearing in large doses and the beer is fairly heavy. Still and extremely delicious beer!"
"The stout poured a opaque black with a thin tan head. Thick lacing. Smell is roasted malt and chocolate. Some hops. Taste is roasted chocolate with a very complex enjoyable cherry sweetness. A very full thick mouth feel. My mouth is coated with the taste. The 9% alcohol in this beer is well hidden which makes it a wonderful drinkable stout. This beer ages exceptionally well. This years batch is still available around here, and it gets better every weekend. The more you let this beer warm, the more the java shows through."
"An extremely enjoyable RIS. One of the few Great Lakes I enjoy a lot."
"This is one of those beers that when i saw it in the store for the first time ever (last night) i freaked out and yelled ""holy shit!"" I thought i might see in town one day since great lakes is now back in south bend, but i didnt expect it so soon. Pours black through and through so that's as advertised. Little khaki head hangs out for a while before just making a small ring. Very heavy burnt coffee odor. Smells like a malty campfire. Taste is very flavorful, in that its bold and the taste is very forward. burnt tasting and somewhat hoppy cocoa beans and coffee grounds. almost singular in its flavor and im a bit diappointed because i expected more or a fruity flavor. a bit too assertive with the char flavors and not enough fruity chocolates. Its a big think monster of a beer though and i think maybe i just caught it too early. I'll sit on the other 3 bottles for a while and see how they develop."
"Mouthfeel isn't as heavy as I'd expect for a RIS. Drinkability is dangerous for a 9% abv beer. I'll enjoy drinking a case of this."
"Where this one seemed to stand up a bit more than others was the hop profile. Definitely in the RIS vein but a few steps further into the bitter / grapefruit category than most RIS's I've had recently. That, combined with the alcohol and full body made this a great tasting brew. I'm glad I still have 2 more to go!"
"obviously, it's black. the head is a mixture of tan and white -- they swirl around one another, never mixing, and eventually dissipate, leaving a white ring around the top of the liquid. at the peak of the liquid, a bit of purple/brown can be seen as the light comes through. in the nose, it's a sinus clearer. sniff it when you have a head cold. chocolate, charcoal, menthol, hops... first impression of the taste is tobacco. lots of tobacco. close behind is brownies, maybe with pot baked in. also present are walnuts, charcoal, menthol, bitter hops, citric hops. primarily though, the taste seems to be tobacco, mint, and chocolate. it's wonderful and bold. nowhere near as all-inclusive as others in the style, and it's for the better because of it. amazingly smooth in the mouth -- just the right consistency to support the flavor profile. slightly warming, but the beer never betrays its 9% abv."
"A very dark pour with just a little cola color showing through the surface when looking through towards light. The moderate tan head dissapates to a thin covering along with some lacing. Smells of darkly roasted malts with some coffee. Tastes of roated malt, some chocolate and a bit of coffee with a hint of alcohol. Body is slightly thick and drinkability is good though two at a time would be enough. Had it on tap recently where I recall it as being smoother and more balanced. A very good beer."
"Creamy and thick with a great viscosity that allows the flavors to really imbed themselves in your mouth. This is actually one of the most drinkable RIS's I've had and I could easily do some serious damage if I had more than the one bottle!"
"D- I think this is a very good beer and I love how they put some citrus hops in it to really brighten this huge beer up. It really comes through nicely. I think they did a great job on this."
"Purchased a four pack excitedly from Sams, but its readily available else where now, chilled it and poured into nonic. Off white/ light kaki head developed with shades of gray, decent retention and sticky melted marsh mellow lacing. The body is a highly reflective mahogany color, oily and completely opaque. Smells is robust, slightly salty, smoky, with lovely roasted barley notes. Both toasted and chard malts are apparent in the nose, which round out subtle hints of chocolate and caramel with notes of wonderful dry roast coffee. Hops on this are faint (more so than some other RIS), but provide just enough back up to showcase the malt quite pleasantly. The flavor is excellent big, rich and intense, yet immediately accessible and tasty as hell. Rich and sumptuous, round bitter sweet, smoked dark chocolate with hints of toffee and dry roasted coffee plus a bit of sugar for ballast. Bitterness is minimal, just enough to balance the sweet richness and add color to the bitter-sweet character. The mouthfeel is creamy surrounded by a slightly oily sensation and then a nice dry roasted coffee finish. I have to comment on this brews ability to utilize quite surly RIS characteristics so tactfully, not cloying in the least. This is extremely drinkable; I could have one for every meal and then some especially breakfast. Despite the ABV this is totally a seasonable beer, just be careful. I am so happy to have had this and will be buying in bulk in the future."
"Bottle is from 2007, best by 8/2/07. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. It smells mostly like roasted malt and coffee, with some molasses and chocolate too. It tastes pretty much the same way to me, but with some dark fruit in the taste. There's more bitterness than sweetness in the taste. There's also a hoppy bitter aftertaste and a dry finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and oily, but a bit carbonated at the same time. Drinkability is pretty good considering the 9% ABV. The alcohol is noticable, but not overwhelming at all. Overall, I think this is a pretty decent beer."
"Drank a 12 oz. of this. Best-by date of 8/2/07. Pours an opaque black, like a dark cup of coffee. Very little head, and no retention on it. Smells very heavily of molasses... some coffee, cocoa, red wine. Tastes are very similar... molasses, coffee, dark chocolate. Medium thickness on the mouthfeel, tiny bit of carbonation. Overall, a great stout. Fairly complex. Really enjoyed the flavors and aromas."
"Had it on tap at Great Lakes and what an outstanding brew. Poured black, opaque with a mocha tan head. Nice head retention and left a excellent amount of sticky lacing. Upon smelling you get a robust scent of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and vanilla ending with a hint of alcohol. The flavor is amazing. Very complex with a slightly sweet bitter dark chocolate, expresso coffee and a small undertone of vanilla to begin. Somewhere in the middle I got a little of molasses and licorice. The light hoppy flavor shine through the end that is complimented with a slight bit of alcohol to balance out the brew. The beer is very smooth, full body, oily and creamy and softly carbonated to make it a very enjoyable session. You can drink this all night, but watch out it packs 9% abv and it will creep up on you. One of the best RIS I've had. Enjoy."
"Big, full bodied beer with and oily, chewy thickness and and incredibly pleasant warming alcohol sensation."
"Drink-ability: Went down a little too easy ;-) This is one awesome stout a true pleasure. Everything balances just right"
"really dark color, with a tannish brown, non-persistant head. Consistently thin lacing. Smells of a sweet citrus overtone, comparable to an over ripe pink grapefruit. Undertones of roasted chocolate malts. Can tell this will be sweet with a very hoppy finish. Very complex taste. Starts sweet then overcome with hops, malty but really subdued by the hops, an almost grapefruit hop taste with a pine tasting finish. Perfect carbonation on this one. I think if they had allowed for more carbonation the higher alcohol taste would linger and ruin the taste, so not having such a large head may hurt the appearance of the beer but definetely works in its favor for the taste. Overall a great imperial stout worth trying."
"D: Each sip reveals a different aspect of the flavors, aromas, and textures of this excellent RIS. This is a must try!"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Blackout feels so smooth on the palate and goes down the same way. Not too thick, but not too thin either. Just about right for me. I could drink two or three of these in a sitting. Overall, clearly one of the best offerings from Great Lakes. I'm a big fan of their brews, but I may be a bit biased. I am in Columbus after all."
"This rich flavorful stout slides down with ease. Way too drinkable for the high abv which i am sure will lead to some having blackouts that have nothing to do with a computer glitch."
"Pours black, with a red hue when you hold it to the light. Thin head, with good retention,and lacing. Smell is of roasted coffee, with some chocolate undertones. Body is thick,rich,and silky. Taste is of dark roasted coffee, nicely bittered. If I've had a better Imperial Stout, I dont recall when.Excellent!"
"Great RIS, I'll definitely stock up."
"Be careful with this one its smoothness may sneak up on you!"
"D - Extremely drinkable at 9%. So smooth and mellow for an Imperial Stout it is liable to sneak up on ya."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for a Russian Imperial Stout. You can feel that this is a bigger beer but the high ABV never gets in the way of your next sip. Very subtle for the style. Recommended."
"Great beer overall. Very smooth drinking for an RIS...maybe second in that category to Siberian Nights. Very good, but nothing spectacular. I can't wait to get my hands on the barrel-aged version."
"D: This is one I'd love to have again. And if this is what it tastes like nearly 6 months past it's freshness date, it makes me wonder what it tastes like fresh or whether it's best cellared a while. A fine Imperial Stout, highly recommend and one to which I'll return."
"This poured as black as one could hope and head was minimal. No lacing. Nose is full of chocolate and espresso and minimal dark fruits. Taste is far richer. Though the same flavors appear, they seem more fleshed out ... the chocolate is milky and rich, the espresso tasting fine and as if it came from a premier coffee house. Mouth isn't quite as thick as I want but it's still very nice. I'd buy this again for sure. Thanks to Nlmartin for the trade!"
"Cheers."
"This stout is very assertive, alcohol is layered somewhere in there but does not factor in the flavors for me. Bittersweet chocolate and coffee flavors. I also get some tannin flavors-nice balance to some of the sweetness. The malt bill on this must have generous black patent and chocolate malts. The hop profile is a medium bitterness that gives the dominant malt profile a nice zing. An earthy bitterness is there towards the finish. I enjoyed mine with dessert of a chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. Great dessert stout and it goes down nice. Not sessionable but I could quaff two at one sitting. My second GLBC offering and I am impressed."
"Pours a thick black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, some lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet roasted malts, slight vanilla, tons of chocolate/toffee/caramel. The taste follows the nose pretty much, nice roasted, chocolatey, coffee flavor. Alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, a nice RIS, very much to the style."
"Mouthfeel is slightly sticky and pretty good. I also found this beer to be pretty drinkable. All-around quite good and easily the peer of Victory Storm King Stout."
"Great beer to drink while watching an Evening with Kevin Smith to warm you up to enjoy the humor just a bit more...."
"I highly recommend aging this brew, if you can wait that long. It is damn good right off the bat, but aging this gives it a smooth blending of the flavors. Awesome."
"Mmmmm...delicious."
"I lived through the said blackout that this beer commemerates. Bottle courtesy of Hyde. This one is pitch and pours a thick froth of mocha foam. Dotty lace. The aroma is mostly coffee, but has the presence of molasses, some dark bakers chocolate, plums, roasty malts and hops. Flavours are roasted nutty malts, dark cocoa beans, black coffee, molasses and rum. The balance here is mind blowing. If this was a blind taste, I would have guessed 5% ABV. Best balanced Impy Ive had thus far. F#@# me, where do I sign up? Thanks Derek!"
"D - Not too bad. I wouldn't mind having this one again - but I definiely won't seek it out. There are many RIS that I would have an easier time finding and enjoy more. It could work with some choice foods. Way too powerful to session."
" I had long been coveting this Blackout Stout. I had somehow expected something much greater than what I poured and drank. Dont get me wrong, this is an excellent Russian Imperial Stout, I just had unrealistic expectations."
"A great stout but it doesn't top the list. Still very very solid. Thanks go out to Zorro for sending me this one."
"A top notch Imperial stout, and barrel aging of some sort would add a beautiful dimension to this one."
"Pours a fairly viscous and opaque black color with a touch of ruby red highlights. Creats a dense, 1/2"" thick tan head which settles to a thin wisp. Minimal spotty lacing along the sides of the snifter. Luscious and complex aromas of espresso beans, dark chocolate, charred wood, dark fruit and molasses emerge along with a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is almost perfect; smooth, creamy, chewy with just the right amount of CO2. Flavors are a bit more assertive as compared to the nose. Loads of fig, licorice, bittersweet chocolate, espresso bean, burnt malt and charcoal overwhelm the tongue. Long, bittersweet finish with strong notes of charred wood, roasted malts with a touch of hops and ethanol which nicely warms things up. A top notch Imp. Stout."
"Creamy, silky-smooth mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable at 9% ABV and oh-so-smooth. Luckily I've only got one bottle."
"Must try stout I'd say,good beer for a cold winters night."
"Blackout Stout addresses my least favorite aspect of the Russian imperial stout by balancing that toothachey sweetness with some bittering from both dark malt and and quick hello from some hops. This is going to be a favorite example of the style for me."
"pours with not too much head but common for stouts tastes of chocolate and coffee the bottle has been aged 10 months so it has a the smell of coffee and it has a great complex feel in the mouth come this spring grab yourself a few of these recommended"
"Taste is a smooth coffee stout. Flavors are blended and evenly distributed. At first theres coffee, then theres a chocolate/slight hop taste in the middle. None of these jump out at you. It's a nice flow from one to another. My only complaint here is that the mouthfeel is a little thinner than I like out of my stouts. But thats splitting hairs, this is a terrific stout. This offering doesn't leave you with the mouth coating coffee aftertaste as well. Which makes this a highly sessionable offering. A very solid offering from a very solid brewery. A must try, even for non-stout fans."
"Pours insanely black, thick tan head forms, tons of lace and great retention, definately looks like a stout. Smell is sweet and roasty, toffee, coffee, chocolate, some dark fruits. Taste is awesome roasty chocolate, coffee and caramel, some dark fruits, nice bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thick bodied with low carbonation. Definately world class!"
"I could drink a couple of these but as dark as it is, I couldn't see this as a session beer."
"This brew pours an opaque black color. The head is two-fingers in height, and tan in color. Lacing is decent. The aroma is of chocolate, coffee, graham crackers, alcohol, and roasted malt. The taste like the aroma, but with a bit more alcohol. The aftertaste is fantastic with a ton of chocolate and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is full bodied without being too thick. Carbonation is rather low leaving a nice silky texture. Overall, this is one of the best stouts I have ever had. It seems to walk the line between a tradional impy and a huge American version."
"Can't wait to try the Barrel Aged version this weekend!!!"
"Drinkability- Dangerously easy for an Imperial Stout. Must get more!!! Great choice for my 50th review."
"Drinkability: Even tho this is my fave brew from Great lakes, anything more than a 4 pack and I tend to get a lil' too squirrely due to the high ABV."
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for this one!"
"drinkability is great. really well balanced and tasty. really happy that i got this one. thanks again nate!"
"From the moment I sniffed this beer I was exceedingly impressed by just how blended the elements were, and the flavor actually exhibited this admirable quality even more. It was a joy from the first look to the last drop, and the only thing I ever questioned was how fleeting some of the qualities seemed, but that is so small a knock as to be inconsequential. The ABV is a large intoxicating presence, and not to be ignored, though the warming way it has about it is more charming than daunting. So this is one RIS that, like so many others, should be enjoyed in careful moderation, but with the utmost gusto."
"Poured pitch black color with a thin tan head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of hops and roasted chocolate malts. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, some hops and a light alcohol burn. Slightly above average mouthfeel. I prefer the barrel-aged version more."
"D- While it is rather warm outside, I do believe I could drink this anytime...."
"Pours pretty much black with mahogany highlights. Moderate wet sand colored head gradually fades to leave a few islands of foam atop the glass. Beer displays pretty good lacing as well. Aroma has notes of dark fruit, tobacco, and a hint of espresso. Perhaps just a hint of hop spiciness as well. Flavor has a lot of dark chocolate and espresso in it; I mean a LOT. Very dry, almost like eating cocoa powder. Then it sweetness just a bit carried by a wisp of alcohol. A slight amount of bitterness balances out the package. Really cant believe how neutral the finish is. Most RIS will tend to have a strong, thick, lingering finish. This just leaves you with a bit of double-strength mocha. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected. The amount of dark roast flavors begs for a bit of thick malt to balance things out, but it never happens. Great finish for a dry stout, not sure about an Imperial stout. Not really bad, but typically the RIS reminds you of it's power and size. This one's more strong and wiry than a big brute. Drinkability is decent, but it gets a little tiring after a while. Wish it had a bit more body."
"I had the last bottle 4 months after the best before date. I think it actually gets better cellaring. Much smoother, silky body, some smokyness, warming sherry-like alcohol with hints of spice. Hell of a beer."
"D: Tasty warming heavy bodied stout, would drink this again."
"drinkability: good, slightly inhibited by bitterness"
"Drinkability: Balanced flavor with lots of nice malt developments. Not the most complex of imperial stouts, but definitely one of the more nicely executed."
"12oz brown bottle with a best before date of 10/06. Pours a jet black with a 1 finger head, great longevity and lace. Smells of highly roasted almost burnt malt mixed with chocolate, coffee and dried dark fruits. Tastes are similar with coffee being the main flavor. Alcohol comes flying through and is warming all the way down. Hops are a bit subtle but there is a nice roasted bitterness that lingers in the mouth. This stuff screams for some chocolate cake. It is smooth and creamy an although tasty it is a bit heavy to be super drinkable, but do not pass this beer by if you see it. Just drink it slowly and enjoy."
"Poured out completely black with a nice tan head leaving a very nice lacing. Hops, coffee, and a bit of cocoa in the nose. Taste explodes on the tongue, starting with currants and chocolate, then transforming into a little cherry flavor and a lot of roastiness. Amazing taste, I loved it. Low-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied, would have like it a little thicker. Takes a while to drink, but each sip was savored. Definitely a nice beer, try it if you see it available, but don't fret if you don't."
"Drinkability- Way too drinkable. The taste makes it outstanding as a cold winter night brew."
"Jen: As a general rule of thumb, Great Lakes makes some outstanding beers. This one seems to fall short by just a hair. It starts with a nice scent of roasted malts. The taste follows up nicely with a dry espresso taste and dark chocolate (not creamy like milk chocolate, more like a Hersheys Special Dark mini bar). There is a definite dryness to this that leaves your mouth with a taste that lingers only for a short while. On the exhale, I get a twinge of the 9% alcohol. The body of this beer is just too thin for me, and that is where this brew falls up a hair short. I feel a Russian Imperial Stout should coat your mouth and hang around for a while after swallowing. I would, however, never turn this down, as I am a stout lover and this is a very good one to have!"
"Doesn't hold a candle to 2004 Stone IRS, but what does, really?"
"This is the beer all stouts aspire to be, hands down one of the most phenominal beers I have ever tasted. A little strong to drink every day, but go out and try some immediately, you will regret it if you don't!"
"Poured pitch black with a very thin, tiny bubbled tan head. This is one very black beer. A nose of nearly all sorts of dark chocolate and roasted maltiness. Blackout Stout began as a dry hoppiness sweeps the tongue, then a flash of black licorice and dark, dark chocolate tones. Roasted malts and a background alcohol flavor round out this stout. Full bodied, but super drinkable because of the hidden alcohol in the flavor. This one is another winner from Great Lakes."
"Best before Aug 10 2006. Just below cellar temp, poured into a 17-ounce snifter. Black like demonic ichor with a thin desert-khaki head. Aromas of fresh black plums in the middle of summer, slightly smoky roasted malts, earthy and piney hops, and just a touch of alcohol vapor. The taste is full of wonderful roasty and vinous flavors. Brief bitter pine-sap hops at the beginning. Dark cherry appears in the middle, right after a slight touch of cabernet bite. The finish is all dark roasted malts, like the tastiest burnt toast and dark topsoil sandwich. The 9% alcohol is apparent but expertly melded with the density of the overall flavor. Medium body and a slick, chewy mouthfeel. I would love to have this available where I live, but its rarity for me makes it that much more special. Stunning RIS."
"I would like to have another of these soon. I enjoyed it very much."
"Blackout Stout is a B paper from an A student. It's good, but it doesn't have the body of the elite imperial stouts. The bitterness needs more counterpoint as well. At times, the hops become a solo act. Blackout is far from a failure, but it isn't truly special."
"The taste is sweet, yet not cloying and an immediate sense that reminds me of cocoa powder hits my taste buds; a solid chocolate note as well as a bit of a chalky note that I get from cocoa powder. The finish has a certain roasted note that picks up an acidity similar to that in an espresso. This beer has quite a burnt grain character to it as well; adds a certain dryness to this beer that in combination with the acidity helps to balance the sweet notes. There is a nice compound bitterness here as well, a combination of both the roast grain bill and a solid hop level. Maybe this is a touch thinner than I like, but it definitely works on a hot day like today."
"D: Good drinking RIS. Wonderfully balanced and smooth."
"Another excellent beer from an excellent brewery."
"Drinkability isn't perfect only because of the 9 percent -- I could drink these for hours if I didn't have to get up and go to work tomorrow. I love this beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. The beer looked really good, pitch black color with a nice thick tan foam. And it smelled better than whatever thing you can think of which is known for smelling good. Chocolate and coffee and some very mild burnt malts. The taste was almost perfect too. It felt a little oily and the body was if anything a tad light for the style, but it worked really well. Anyway it kept the drinkability pretty high."
"D: This is a very nice stout but not in the A league."
"i love this damn brewery and this is one of its finest offerings"
"This is the best stout ever! Sweet and milky with the nice toffe and caramel taste. What a great beer! Very deceptive in the fact that it is so drinkable. You just cannot drink too many, although you want to. Nice malty front, cool, not overwhelming, hops at the end. great lacing! Without a doubt, an incredible beer!"
"Hands down a World Class Imperial Stout."
"This is a pretty chewy beer but still pretty drinkable. I want to get my hands on some more of this one for sure."
"Drinkabilty - this goes down smooth and easy. Would only have another one in a session given how rich this is and of course the high abv, but definitely this will be the opening to many future sessions."
"A rich, black pour into a goblet produced a huge head that slowly receeded into a thin film. The smell of roasted coffee notes and a pinch of alcohol. Sweet, burnt malt flavor and well-balanced hops. Mouthfeel is thick, but goes down rather smooth. Very drinkable for this style, though I would keep this to one bottle per sitting. I would like to try this again later on down the road."
"This isn't one of the flashier imperial stouts out there, and it's all the better for it. Just a solid, drinkable, and delicious stout that succeeds in all the ways it's supposed to."
"D - Goes down a little too easily, but certainly packs a punch. An excellent, highly drinkable Imperial Stout."
"Very enjoyable."
"I found myself slowing down after the first couple sips. I think this stuff is a bit too bitter for the style and also the flavor doesn't follow the smell as well as it should. I don't think I could bring myself to buy a whole four pack when there are at least a couple more balanced high grav stouts for cheaper. Glad I tried it though."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and full. Coats the entire mouth and the flavor lingers for quite a while. Drinkability is superb. No harshness to be found really and a nice play of flavors on the tongue make this one that is easy to enjoy."
"The body is nice and thick. Decent carbonation. Quite drinkable for such a big stout. I love this stuff. I wish I had more."
"This beer had a small, but creamy head. The smell had dark and rich aromas of roasted malt with a hint of coffee. In addition, the aroma had sort of a sweet smell to it. The taste was very bold and the hop bitterness likewise had some ""bite"" to it. The taste of the high amount of alcohol in this beer was also present. The mouthfeel was medium/thick with low carbonation. Unfortunately, I felt that the high alcohol taste of this beer lowered it's drinkability for me. Nonetheless, this is a hearty imperial stout and would be a good companion with a meal. I believe those who enjoy imperial stouts will find this to be a quality beer which I recommend trying."
"When it came to me in the Snifter glass, it was a pitch black color with a nice size (considering the size of the glass) off white head of foam. It receded very nicely leaving behind it plenty of that off white color lace. The smell was still the same of the bottled version but just a little better. The aroma was that of a pleasant mixture of roasted malts, roasted coffee beans, and just a hint of sweet chocolate in the background. On-tap enhanced the flavor of the sweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, roasted malt, and the hint of bitter hops at the end. Excellent! The mouthfeel was thick, full bodied, and this time I could feel the 9% ABV. Wow! A beer that is a must try on-tap. But becareful that ABV will sneak up on you. Way to go Great Lakes!"
"It tastes creamy, like milk chocolate, coffee, hoppy and malty. Good carbonation."
"Dinkability is good, but I don't think I would want to have more than one in a sitting. The roastiness becomes a bit tiresome. I can see how some people may really like this, but I would take a Founder's Imperial Stout over this any day."
"Overall drinkability is very good. A nice example of a RIS. Considering cracking another one of these, rather than tasting something different."
"Quite a tasty RIS and a good one for those who like the fruity complex flavors of RIS more than chocolate and coffee flavors. Lip smacking good beer here. This isn't a Stone RIS but it is damn tasty and a beer I can highly recommend."
"BTW- This beer got better as it warmed."
"D: A beer that should be drank slowly as you share time with friends. However, be careful this beer should be taken seriously."
"D: This is a very accessible RIS that isn't as overwhelming as some in the taste and ABV categories, making it quite drinkable. And at the 4/$8.99 price tag, this is quite a good value."
"11-01-06: The hops have calmed down, allowing more complexity to come through in the nose, and this baby has become downright delicious. Bumping smell, mouthfeel, and drinkability up 0.5."
"this is a great stout, i'm making sure i get a few in my cellar."
"Dark black pour, but doesn't appear as viscous as anitcipated. The near 1/2 inch tan head dissipates quickly into a touch of froth. A nice ring lingers for a while but eventually fades to nothing. The smell is a great asset to this beer; very toasty and strong, with light notes of chocolate and coffee. The taste begins subtle and turns into a nice roasted coffee flavor with hints of sweet mocha flavor. Moderate bitterness lingers, slight alcohol also. The mouthfeel has quite a medicore thickness for an Imperial Stout, although its quite smooth with decent carbonation. Drinkablity was decent. Usually these beers improve as they warm in your hand, but this one lost its initial sweetness and just became slightly bitter/sour. Luckily the alcohol is pretty well blended. Overall I expected greater things from this top brew..."
"An exceptional imperial stout."
"Very nicely done, but could be a little more complex."
"Overall and extremely drinkable Imp Stout."
"The thing that strikes me most about his beer is the supremely smooth transition between its wonderful creamy upfront chocolate sweetness and its intense bitter hopped/alcohol finish. The aromas and flavors are huge, consisting largely of chocolate, coffee, tobacco, brown sugar, cherries, plums, smoke and burnt burntness. Appearance is great. The beer is almost pure blackness. The crown is creamy and thick and leaves a nice coating around the edge of the glass. Drinkability is insane when Ive had this stuff on tap. The bottled variety was a little more difficult to drink. The alcohol seemed less covered to me."
"Comments - Who needs the power grid?"
"A great flavor profile and not overly thick body make Blackout an incredible and very drinkable stout. Now if you can handle the 9% abv like its nothing, then you could probably pound this. As for me... this is my second beer today... I'm going to take a nap after this..."
"Black with faint ruby/mahogany highlights. The dense cap of brown foam left delicate lacing behind as it subsided to a solid ring. Rich roasted aroma with generous malty sweetness. Faint ripe fruit and alcohol as well. The flavour starts with a straightforward malt sweetness, roast and semi-sweet chocolate. Bitterness blends in nicely throughout. There's a hint of fruit and molasses towards the end and light alcohol warmth/spiciness carries through the finish, along with lingering caramel and roasted sweetness. Full bodied, low carbonation, creamy texture that's a little on the viscous side. This is a beauty. Another reason to plan a trip to visit Great Lakes."
"For a beer this high in ABV, it's very drinkable. Just make sure to keep it in a window between 40-45 degrees. Any colder and it's just a rough alcohol/roast, any warmer and the coffee and hops make it sour."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, quite thick and goes down too easy...this is one I'd snag a full case and sit on a good 12 for a year or two. One excellent brew from GL."
"Solid. Pours out to a coffee black color with a big, dense head of cocoa colored foam. Lotsa lace in uniform rings. Nice. Lower level of carbonation. Aromas of malty coffee and chocolate are noted, with a earthy dirt element. Interesting and pleasing. Taste is full bodied and complex; flavors of roasted malts, wood, mild and aged whisky, grain and dark chocolate all stand out. Mouthfeel is creamy yet not overly thick or heavy. A rather drinkable RIS, considering the 9% ABV. This one could possibly benefit from a few months of aging. In anycase, it was good when I had it. Recommended."
"Pours suprisingly light but appears black inside the glass. Seriously subtle and lacking aroma of coffee beans, malt (chocolate, roast), strawberry extract, pine, apple and raisins. In terms of flavor, this is equally balanced by the dark malt, burnt fruit and sharp hop characteristics. Front palate begins with a hint of fruit then leads into a nice chocolate, roast, coffee bean flavor and finishes with a reasonable and acceptable hop flavor and bitterness. Lacking in texture. Just not a very good Imperial and I was really hoping to like this."
"Full thick mouth that is not oily or syrupy in any way. The finish is clean and this beer deserves the hype it gets."
"Midnight black color, no light is getting through this stout. A nice one finger thick, tan colored head. Some lacing that disappears quite quickly. Fantastic smelling stout!!! Good mix coffee and chocolate up front and fades to a smoky, slightly sour smell. Very nice!! Another great tasting stout, perfect combination of chocolate and coffee. Good amount of roasted malt and ends with some dark bitterness. Maybe tobacco and smoke flavors also. Medium light body feel, maybe a tad thin for me. All in all an excellent drinking stout, that makes a great after dinner treat. Nice job Great Lakes!!!"
"another great offering from an outstanding brewery. seriously, these guys do no wrong. fabulous!"
"The mouthfeel of this beer is great. Blackout has a nice full bodied feel to it and the carbonation is appropriate to the style. It finishes in a semi-dry kind of way. First it seems to finish without leaving the palate dry, however after a few moments the palate does feel dry. This is a great beer and I'll definitely be buying this one every season, I really can't wait to try this on tap, should be good. It goes down easy if you like Russian Imperial Stouts, however it is a beer that is meant to be ""nursed"" in my opinion. If you don't nurse it then you're missing out on the great taste of this beer."
"Good beer."
"D - This beer has left me satisfied, but not jumping out of my chair to grab another. A good RIS, but there are sure better one's to be had. Overall, I did like this beer."
"O--Ive found my new favorite beer. Not enough good things to say. Watch out for the ABV if you avoid getting too taken away. Sold in 4 packs. I buy 2 at a time. I cannot wait to take a trip to the brewery and see this one in process."
"I picked up a couple four packs today and I really should just grab a couple cases and put it away (just in case of a power failure)."
"cheers..."
"Drinkability: This beer is nearing beer Nirvana. This is a very big beer that was a pleasure to drink. I am going to have to stock up on this one. Dam I missed it when it was gone."
"With this only being available in February and March, please go pick this up as quickly as possible. Well worth a drive to the brewery to check it out."
"D- The malt has nice complexity and there are some good hops to balance this but the alcohol begs for more aging. It will be tricky as to when is the right time to drink this one so that the hops are still a main player yet the alcohol has relaxed its grip. This is a nice beer but it may be a great beer when cellared?"
"Extremely solid stout. Huge roasted malt character and malt sweetness. Lots of complexity with unusual balcance. Light lactose additions help to mellow the rough 'stout-like' edges without contributing sourness. Oatmeal like smoothness does the same. Higher than normal carbonation combined with lightly fusal alcohols causes a scrubbing of the throat on the way down. This the only flaw. Finishes with a roasty-sweet sensation and lightly charcoal-like. Other contributing posatives: french roast, milk chocolate, and marshmellows in the nose, flavor, and feel. Quite nice."
"Had this in a snifter poured for me at Great Lakes on a bitter cold night- a perfect night for a stout! Dark, dark brown color with a thin, dark tan head on it. Aromas coming at me are molasses and burnt coffee. Taste of bakers chocolate and somewhat of a alcohol burn as it goes down. Good beer but not exceptional for the style. I could see drinking this with dessert- it would go fantastic with some molton chocolate cake, methinks."
"drinkability: Papa likes!"
"Well carbonated and strong, a great beer for the depths of a Michigan winter."
"Blackout Stout is a wonderfully enjoyable brew. One I would never turn down. It is a shame I can not acquire it locally, as it would smashingly compliment a cold winter evening in front of the fire."
"Drinkability: A very nice RIS I wish Great Lakes distributed in Minnesota, we have a Great Lake, too! Thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for this fine beer from BIF 24."
"Exceptional drinkability and dangerously smooth"
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the wedding gift! 1,100th ""official"" review. Jul 11 05 on label."
"After taste is a great coffee, chocolate and toasted malt blend that makes me want another. ery drinkable."
"""Blackout"" pour. Head is very small and light brown, retains poorly. Sweet cream, black coffee and hazelnut in the nose. Alcohol is masked well initially, but a slow burn begins to emerge in the aftertaste as it warms and eventually makes itself very well known in the flavor. Mouthfeel shows just a touch of carbonation, making this nicely smooth. Chocolate malts, vanilla and a very roasty bitterness make this nicely complex, though I will say that this could be a bit young and might possibly benefit from a few months in the cellar to allow the flavors to meld together and for the alcohol to cool a bit. Nonetheless, a solid Imperial that at this young age would best be paired with food rather than on its own, to compliment and bring out its rich, roasty flavors. (Goes to the kitchen to find chocolate...or a roast duck)"
"Almost black, diminishing light brown head. Well roasted grains hit the nose, closing on coffee and having that oatmeal touch (whether they use any or not) that I love in big stouts, flour-like with strong biscuity aspects. Very cookieish palate, feels like pastries. Well rounded edges, strong dark fruit components (plums, blackberries..). Anise suggestions come in right before the chocolate ice cream light lactic aspect that miraculously fades away completely to leave way to the roastiness. Very subtle for an impy, yet multi-faceted and admirable imo. Mellow alcohol feels procures a gently fruit liqueur or grand marnier note. One of the best tasting imperials Ive had I would say, but the other aspects were not as admirable. Carbonation for one may be a bit too expressive rather than letting the flavours speak for themselves, it would fit on a smaller stout, here it seems to reduce a bit the punch of this medium body."
"Pretty drinkable because it's so complex and makes me curous for more, but a sipper for sure. Thanks to BuckeyeNation for sending this one along."
"A great imperial stout. I could stand for a bit softer a carbonation, as it seems to fight the greasy slickness the body provides. The mouthfeel couple be perfect with something just a bit more relenting. It gives a bit of a carbonated bite to the finish, which I could do without. A fairly minor complaint, if it's really one at all. I should have saved the bottle for a cooler night on the porch, hoodie on and comfortable shoes, when the wind starts chasing fallen leaves down the street in a late October breeze. Ah well."
"Huge success and a real joy to drink."
"Tough to put down and the ABV is nicely concealed."
"Overall, i'd love to get some more of this one! I enjoyed very much, and I could handle another one in a sitting i think!"
"Pours maybe the darkest crude oil black I've even experienced, with a coating of chocolate brown foam that the 9% abv quickly devoured. Has a lot going on in the nose: coffee, dark fruits, smoked wood and alcohol fumes. One of the most complex beers I've ever tasted: bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee grounds, smoked beef jerky, spicey dark fruit remeniscent of a belgian strong dark and a no-nonsense alcohol kick in the face. This stout means business. Mouthfeel is thick as oil but well carbonated and goes down smooth. This was a pretty intense stout, the flavors don't always mesh (ie beef jerky with dark fruit) but it never gets out of control. A truly big beer for a cold night."
"Opaque thick black body with a smallish tan head that drops quickly leaving light rings of lace. Rich chocolate malts with big ripe fruit notes of plums and figs. There is a lighter roasted malt scent mingling in the background. Bitter sweet dark chocolate covered dark fruits hit you first in the flavor. Mild alcohol notes mix with a bit of roastiness as it warms. Some vinous qualities are there. Bitter roasty finish, definitely one of the best tasting imperial stouts I have ever had. Creamy smooth feel with a slick feel going down. Ample bodied to carry the flavor. With so much going on this goes down faster than I like but it keep me sipping. quickly. Highly recommended."
"This beer pours an opaque black color with a brown head that dissipates quickly. There are a lot of intense flavors( a burnt chocolaty toasty malt, a hop presence on the tip of the tongue, and a fruity prune flavor), yet the flavors carefully balance one another. This is a high alcohol beer, yet you barely taste the alcohol. Drinking this is an intense and enjoyable experience. A slow sipper worth savoring."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out as dark as the name suggests. The dark brown head quickly disappeared. The aroma is dark, roasted malt with licorice and chocolate. Sweet up front with a blast of roasted malt. Lot's of cocoa flavor. Warming alcohol. Full, thick mouthfeel. Low level of carbonation. This beer is pretty wild, even for an imperial stout. All the flavors are extreme. I really enjoyed my bottle, but it wouldn't want more than one."
"Drinkability: Awesomely balanced with more than just your ""typical"" stout flavors. The rich chocolate flavor is great but I like that there is some hop bitterness to balance out all of the malty and sweet components. Well done."
"Drinkability: I think GLBC knows what they are doing with just a 4 pack. More than that could be dangerous or somewhat adventerous. I enjoyed it as as a nightcap and would enjoy another to guarantee a full 8 hours at night."
"Looks absolutely gorgeous, a black hole crowned with a thick, creamy milk chocolate-colored head. I almost don't want to drink it. Smells toasted and burnt. Upfront taste is sweeter than their Edmund Fitzgerald porter, but less creamy. It tastes a little of prunes and molasses, like the Baltic porters I experimented with the other day, but not nearly as offensive. Doesn't really live up to the nose until the end, with a bitter, coffee, toasty finish. I wish it was a little more bitter. Mouthfeel is outstanding, very smooth; this beer does an excellent job of disguising its 9% ABV. I would, however, prefered a little more bitterness. I like the Edmund Fitzgerald better, but this is still a very good beer. Great Lakes is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Obsidian with a dark tan head that falls to a sturdy ring. Nose is sweet dates soaked in molasses. Taste is a sweet charcoal mix of malt and hops. The alcohol bathed prunes comes through in the finish. Complex and delicious. Mouthfeel starts a little thin, but quickly ramps up in an oily fullness that is very satisfying. This is an easy drinking stout and highly recommended."
"Best before July 11, 2005."
"Drinkability - it's a sipper for sure, good for whenever the lights are on or off..."
"Tasting again. Thsi beer pours a nice black color with a finger of head taht falls to a healthy ring over the top. The nose is a combination of fig, coffee, chocolate and a puff of alcohol. The flavor is nice, starying as a semi-sweet fig, moving to chocolate and finishing like a nice coffee bitter, but not offensive. The feel is thick, with a light carbonation. Very nice and coating. Drinkability is very nice on thie beer. The alcohol is not all that prevalent in the flavor. I really do like this beer. Very nice stout."
"Personally, this had many of the characteristics as the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Worth a try, but definitely not for everyone."
"Drinkability is good, not a bad Impy Stout would recommend to others or have in my DBF if it was locally available. Bottle said for fresh taste enjoy by 04/2005 but tasted fine to me sure it would still be fine year or more from now."
"Drinkability/Impression: This is a kickass American impy stout that is accented with an excellent array of fruit esters and smoky nuttiness that compliments the dark, roasted malts perfectly. Highly recommended!"
"The bottle is not conditioned, but I appreciate both the stamped freshness date and the suggested serving temperature on the label. In the end, the taste of alcohol was overbearing, and the body was sullen."
"Tongueland: Sweet dark fruit, figs, raisins, expresso, bitter chocolate, toffee, resinous hops and sweet cocoa to finish. Alcohol dimished by aging, but still intermixed. Tongue coating. Practically a beer shake. The head was practically enjoyable by itself."
"Drinkability: This particular stout is unintrusive and does not produce any offensive qualities. Still, it seems a bit weak as an imperial. I would surely drink this one again though."
"This stout poured an opaque black color with creamy, brown foam that settled and clung to the glass. The smell was a rich, dark malty aroma with resinous hops, and notes of licorice and molasses. The smell improved as the beer warmed. The taste was very richly malty with dark malt, molasses, and dried fruit (prunes). The alcohol was well hidden. The mouthfeel was rich and creamy and smooth with full body and moderate carbonation. This was a very nice, moderately complex imperial stout, but not over the top in intensity."
"Overall a sturdy offering. I'm a bit surprised this interpretation isn't a little bolder seeing their porter and pale are full-on expressions of the style. An Imperial for beginners and veterans to enjoy. GLBC has yet to dissapoint me."
"drinkability: Certainly one of the more drinkable imperials I've had. There's nothing overwhelming, and it certainly isn't too rich."
"This is a bit slick in the mouth. By the end of the glass, all traces of head are gone and it looks like I""m drinking ink. and loving it."
"Nice robust mouthfeel and devilishly drinkable. I only wish I had bought more of this. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: ABV is very warming,but bitterness takes over. Probably wouldn't drink more than a 4 pack."
"Served in a snifter at GLBC's brewpub. A perfectly formed dark tan head sat atop a blacker than black stout. The appearance seems to absorb light, due to its density. When swirled, some residue is left on the glass like a strong whiskey. The aroma was filled with roasted malt, with bitter chocolate, alcohol, and plenty of coffee. A slight smokiness is also present, adding some complexity to the nose. Taste begins very smoothly with lots of malt - big and creamy. Some bitter coffee and burnt malt flavors are apparent as well. Some caramel and chocolate are floating around in there too. Slightly piney but definitely citrous hops make a short-lived appearance near the end before being overthrown by that great roasted aftertaste. A slight alcohol presence adds some warmth to the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is by no means thin, but it is not as fat and chewy and some RISs. A very drinkable RIS, I could seriously enjoy this year-round (hopefully someday this will be offered year-round)."
"Pours black as night black with a decent brown head that leaves some lacing in my glass, chocolate, coffee, and tobacco aromas. Burnt coffee, chocolate and roasted nutty flavors, full bodied with a thick and creamy mouthfeel, has a nice smokey bitter finish, alcohol very well hidden, drinks like a regular stout, very nice."
"Pours a dark black with a small quickly fading tan head into my chalice. Smells of coffee, chocolate, toffee, and caramel, with a slight bit of herbal hops popping through. Taste is sweet at first. Sticky caramel and bitter coffee dominate the taste. There is a definite dark chocolate and molassses presence here also. Some piney hops poke through at the end, but are not overpowering as they are in some impys. There is an ever so slight alcohol presence with this one too. The bitter coffee lingers in the mouth, as this one coats nicely but yet remains somewhat thin. I really would love to drink these all the time, one of my top imperial stouts."
"Drinkability: Dangerously deceptive. The alcohol is hidden well. This is a great stout. It tastes very fresh and raw. I'm going to lay a few down and see what time does to this one. This is definitely another fine offering from one of my favorite breweries!"
"Bottle dated best before July 11, 05. Served at 55°. Pours an opaque jet black color with a brown, short-lived head. Intense espresso nose with notes of black-strap molasses, chocolate and plum brandy. The flavor is equally as intense; black patent and chocolate malts, espresso, bakers' chocolate, treacle, and plum all wrapped up in a chewy mouthfeel that is finished nicely with the further bittering quality of hops. Very flavorful. Drinkability is actually great for a 9%er. Well done, GLBC!"
"Superbly lush, full bodied, creamy and thick. This is how I like my stouts!! It's a joy to drink this brew, especially after a hard days work. The alcohol is well hidden and I could easily see having a few of these. Another great brew from Great Lakes...highly recommended to all fans of imperial stouts."
"Overall, a nice example of the style, though I'm not a fan of Imperial Stouts, as the alcohol taste is usually too strong for my liking. It is, however, a beautiful beer to look at, and reminisce about the power outage this beer commemorates."
"A terrific brew that doesn't ""eat like a meal."""
"Many large border-crossing thanks to cokes for the samples!"
"Drinkability & Notes: Not bad, not bad at all  had to pair this with some chocolate and it did very well with the dark chocolate."
"A friend brought this to a club meeting for us to sample. Came in a 12 ounce bottle Pours a dark color with a tall off-white head that sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is of dark malts and lots of coffee. A little bit of sweetness too. The flavor is thick and malty. Lots of coffee. Great mouthfeel and drinkability."
"This beer blew me away immediately. Easily one of the more immediately accessible beers for this style. Might not have as intense character as others in this style, but overall an extremely pleasurable beer."
"Blackout Stout is great beer from one of the truly great breweries in North America. It has instantly become one of my favorites and it is my fervent hope that Great Lakes will decide to brew it year-round. I'd also like to see it distributed to this state, but I'm not holding my breath. I'll be stocking up on my trips back to Ohio, though, that much is certain. Highly recommended. A huge 'thank you' to Dogbrick for the opportunity."
"Not as thick and robust as some imperial stouts, but the taste makes this imperial easy drinking, despite the 9% abv."
"Overall this was an excellent pickup for me, especially at a rate of 5 bucks per mixed sixer. I think I'll end up going back and picking up the remaining Blackout Stouts that they had on the mixed sixer rack."
" The beer poured, black as the night sky, with a nice two inch tan head. Lace was plenty. The aroma gave off roasted malts. The taste was soft yet complex. Heavy dark roasted malts balanced by a soft alcoholic hop. Backing up the tastes were sweetened coffee, molasses and burnt wood chips.(the wood chips might be my fault). A smooth alcohol softened things to allow this to be not just a great relaxer brew but a nice drinkable full bodied imperial stout.Nice job GLBC."
"A good imperial stout, but not great. I'd rather have an Edmund Fitzgerald from these guys than this. Just not alot of complexity to me, and too much roasted grains."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" of light brown head over the opaque dark, dark brown/black brew. Laced well. Aroma is all about dark malts, but overboard on the coffee, which portends well. Taste is heavy dark malts, with coffee leading the way, but enough sweetness from the other darks to balance evrything out for my palate. Mouthfeel is superb, and drinkability is high, although the sweetness may get old eventually, but I doubt it. Yet another winner from the massive Skidz trade..."
"This beer has a very rich malty taste with lingering toasted malt flavor and a smooth alcoholic warmth. First taste is sweet and malty. Hops seem balanced and subtle; with a trace of hop bitterness remaining afterwards."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep jet black color with two fingers of medium-tan head. There is some lacing left over. The smell is full of burnt malt, coffee, caramel, and a slight hickory smell. Very nice. The taste has a good roasted malt base with some sweet molasses and caramel. A hint of espresso and hops on the slightly dry finish. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth, just gliding over the tongue. The drinkability is pretty good for a 9% brew. A damn good Imperial Stout!"
"I don't drink too many imperial stouts, but i figured i'd give this a try. Poured dark, dark black with a tan head. Smelled of burnt coffee and had a malty note. Very heavy in the mouth with tastes of coffee, malt, slight chocolate and some burnt flavor. Even after swallowing this one lingers on for a good five seconds or more. Still, it seems very drinkable and i could definately have a couple at a time until the alcohol caught up. Definately recomended."
"Thanks to Big Hugeperson for the offerings..."
"Comments  OFS, the God of beer trading, comes through huge on this one. Its going to be hard to top this offering from Great Lakes."
"This stout is a special beer. Reminds me of Storm King. Thick and black and full of substance. The aroma is sweet and dark with licorice, burnt caramel smoke and a spicy alcohol. Complex and rich in flavor, full bodied with the finish of spicy smoked malt. Overall, a very drinkable and very strong stout that might just cause you to black out."
"Nearly opaque black with blood red highlights and a nice espresso tinged head of foam. The aroma is excellent! Creamy coffee, dark chocolate, port wine, alcohol, roasted malts, and cream. The taste is excellent as well. This is a super creamy imperial stout with a lovely blend of deep coffee flavors, roasted malt flavors, and dark chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is super thick and creamy, like a frappucino and the drinkability is like buddah! A magnificently under-rated imperial stout!"
"One of the darkest stouts I've poured - not even a hint of ruby at the edge of the glass when held to the light. Very soft aroma of sweet milk chocolate and a vague hint of coffee. A little less hefty in the mouth than the appearance would suggest. Dark roasted but well balanced bitterness. No particular emphasis on any particular flavor - sort of a generic but well-done Imperial. Sampled fairly warm, and at first I was assailed by an unpleasant rubbing alcohol vapor at the finish, but either this went away or I became acclimated to it, because it quickly fell out of the flavor profile."
"Final Thought: It's no Storm King Stout, but it's a contender without a doubt!"
"GLBC has always produced exceptional brews and this is another stellar example. Wonderful in every sense of the word, this brew competes head to head with other great examples in the style, including Old Raspy, Black Bear, Kzoo stout, Rogue Shakespeare, Samuel Smith, and Storm King."
"A little light for an imperial with a bit of mahogany around the edges, the head is nicely tan and creamy. The aroma nicely roasty with a hint of fig. The flavor is sweet (a little sugary) and fruity (the fig again) with an almost metallic bitterness finishing it out."
"Blackout stout is a good, heavy imperial stout. Black with ruby at the edges. Good dark roasted malt taste with a strong smack of hop bitterness and a lingering alcohol backup. This is a fine beer, but for the price and the ABV, it's more of a dessert beer than anything."
"Overall, I found Blackout Stout to be a highly enjoyable imperial stout. Another well-crafted brew from Great Lakes BC."
"The flavor is roasted chocolate malts with hints of vanilla and caramel. This gives way to hoppy character with a slight vinous tone, then back to a little hop bitterness. Absolutely smooth, well balanced, very drinkable, and even ends a little tannic. I dare anyone to notice a slight trace of alcohol in this...it's just not there, in my opinion. Great job here, I can't believe that I've not picked this up sooner and probably missed my opportunity to stock my cellar. Very impressed..."
"Drinkability is pretty high for a Imperial Stout. I didn't have any more to have after this one, but I could have put away a couple."
"I love trying great,new Imperial Stouts. Thanks for the opportunity Ryan."
"An Imperial Cheers to BigHuge for this Monster."
"Second bottle 26 months later, great and substantial coffee and roast aroma. Beautiful mocha ring on head. bMedium mouthfeel,n warming alcohol, satisfying coffee aftertaste."
"This beer pours out like its name, black as night. It produces a good sized creamy head that looked beautiful. The smell is very roasted with a chocolate espresso note to it. The initial flavor I got was a strong roasted coffee precense. The roasted flavors turn into a burnt chocolate that is a little unsettling. Hops mix with the alcohol and provide a spicyness, almost fruitiness but then become more bitter the further I go. The finish is alcohol dry. The body was slightly thinner than I would have hoped for. This was a good complex beer but not my favorite in the Imperial Stout category."
"Overall a very drinkable beer. A very good imperial stout. Go GLBC"
"That burnt chocolate chip cookie flavor just seems to resonate in the mouth and the memory, and I love it."
"very very nice mouthfeel...silky smooth, big and chewy all in one. If the roast was toned down a touch this beer would be right on."
"Thanks to AKsmokedPorter for this big gem of a beer,pours a deep black with a few ruby highlights showing thru with a mocha colored head,aroma ofrum and nuts with some bitter chocolate thrown in just incredibley appetizing with its wide variety.A big rich stout very chewey mouthfeel big and buttery with that rum note again with some nuttiness as well.A big complex awesome beer, man I miss getting GLB beers on a regular basis cuzz this one would be in my fridge all the time."
"The mouthfeel is not as thick as many others in this category, and that seems to make it real easy to drink. I could get into real trouble if I ever find this on tap and served by the pint!"
"On tap at Mad Mex in the North Hills of Pittsburgh. I am still recovering from the flu/cold, but I did not notice any negative aroma. It seemed to have a slight coffee/chocolate aroma. Very dark with a tight frothy head. Delicious coffee and chocolate flavor with a full-bodied palate. It's listed here as 9% ABV, but this can't be right. It tasted as though it were 5.5 to 6.5% at most. If this is 9% ABV, GLBC should be given an award for masking alcohol content. Stouts are not my favorite beers, but this stout will force me to go to Frank B. Fuhrer Wholesale Company in the South Side to pick up a keg, assuming it is still available."
"GLBC does it again...and does it very well. Get a bottle if you can, or, better yet, hit the brewpub to sample it from the tap."
"Pours black... absolutely freaking black... with a thin tan head that leaves a fair amount of lace. Aroma is a mix of malt, coffee, fennel, and some chocolate. Flavor is an absolutely amazing combniation of espresso, some notes of port wine, and spicy hops - bold and potent... with a noticeable alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is thick and oily with low to medium carbonation. This is a massive and wondefrul brew that is a great deal at $9 for a 4 pack!"
"A dark tan head tops nearly opaque deep dark brownish/black liquid. Good lacing. Intense rich coffee and dark fruit nose. Viscuous mouthfeel with robust flavors of coffee, milk chocolate, roasted barley, nicely integrated hoppiness, then alcohol is both tasted and felt. The long, long flavorful finish hints at yeasty fruitiness and espresso bitterness...simply fab-u-lous! Reminds me of a tamer version of Bell's Expedition Stout. Thanks to CRJMellor for this roasty gem...my 400th review, and quite a fitting brew for it!"

"What a great stout...wish I could have this more often!"
"Note to Great Lakes: Get this beer all over and not just in the Midwest."
"Bottle indicates best before May 29, 2004. I can pick up a slight brownish tinge to the beer as it comes out of the bottle but once in the glass it as black as a night sky. The head quickly goes away. I get mostly a chocolate aroma from the beer. Another sniff reveals a roasted coffee aroma. Actually it smells freshly brewed. First sip reveals a very dry, woody tasted with more roasted and burnt notes than chocolate. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and not syrupy or thick at all. Alcohol bite doesn't seem present at first. Several sips into the glass a pronounced bitter aftertaste is developing. A beer for sipping. It will take a while to get through the glass. Still Bell's gets my vote for a better Imperial Stout in the Midwest."
"This is a highly drinkable stout. Strong flavor but no off tastes. At 9.0 ABV, I wouldn't drink too many in a setting, but I'll definately try this one again."
"Drinkability is very nice. Another great beer from GL."
"Black. Opaque. It is stunning in its depth; it is an abyss in my glass. The russet head reached a very modest ¼ of an inch before it quickly faded to a collar. No subsequent lacing. The bouquet was simply lovely, big roasted malt aromas, a hint of coffee, chocolate, and a hint of milk-like sweetness. I couldnt detect much in the way of hops, in other words it hasnt been too Americanized. The potency is strong enough to get its point across, which is drink me! The flavors on the palate are great. I could leave the description at that. It is simply great. Big, angry, burn malts, dry coffee, and tree bark upfront, in the middle a sizable malty sweetness emerges and the first notice of the hops slide into the finish. Before I could reach the finish however the alcohol reared its head, it brought some heat and a pleasant bite. This is an outstanding Imperial Stout, be forewarned though, this isnt a hop monster like Storm King Stout, its more a kin to the SS Imperial Stout, but better. The aftertaste is long, rich malty alcohol; a hint of chocolate covered cherries, espresso, the dryness is impressive. It is very tasty. The mouthfeel is thick and hearty; the bulk on the tongue can be described as full. Carbonation levels are low but natural. It coated my mouth like lacquer. The alcohol punch is perfect, it encouraged me to sip and savor. I gladly did. This is an outstanding offering and yet another masterpiece from GLBC. This one come recommended; seek this out! Thank you PhantomVodoo"
"The bottom line: Great Lakes is one of my favourite semi-local brewers, and Blackout Stout is a great product. If you like the style, you should definitely give this one a go."
"In summary, another outstanding beer from an outstanding brewery. Maybe more people need to take notice of Great Lakes, because they are doing some wonderful things, and they have been very consistent."
"The beer as it emigrates from the bottle to my 30 year old Chimay Chalice is the color of obsidian with the head a beauteous chocolate color and also burly in size, as it calmly erodes the lace forms a fine sheet of lace to obscure the glass. The aroma of roasted grain dominates the nose with hints of bittersweet chocolate, fresh and pleasing to the eye and the nose, start is thick with malted grain, ambrosial, the top chewy thick. Finish is deliberate in its acidity, the hops sweet-tempered in their spiciness, desert dry aftertaste with the bittersweet chocolate flavor lasting to the very last, a find stout from a magnificent brewery."
"Full body packed with loads of different flavors to try and pick out. Very smooth and clean tasting, nothing here to complain about. This is definately a great brew to just sit back and enjoy in the quiet dark night. By two and share with a friend."
"I only bought a four pack but will have it again. Very easy to drink with a steak or alone. Going to grab one of my favorite 5x54 Drew Estates and have another! Damn this is great."
"Great stout overall by Great Lakes. They make some quality beers and this is just one more great one to add to the list."
"On draught at Winking Lizard (served in a snifter). I didn't think my luck could get much better after learning they were finally bottling this gem, only to find it on draught mere miles from my home! The beer is an inky black color with a thin light brown head. The head dissipates but never dissapears, and the lacing is thin. Strong roasty aroma of coffee and chocolate as it warmed. Rich bodied, with a nicely balanced blend of coffee, chocolate, malt and hops flavors. The alcohol is well-hidden too. This Imperial is definitely on the hoppy side for the style but it is pulled off very well. Some Imperials are borderline cloying with the big chewy malt/alcohol flavors but that is not the case here. The finish retains the coffee and hops aspect and makes this abundantly drinkable. I don't think this version is really any better or worse than the bottled, but it's still a great beer."
"A big beer that might not do so well as a session beer, but is an excellent treat every once in a while."
"Overall, a good imperial stout. Finally a bottled big beer from Great Lakes."
"when i first poured the beer i was amazed at the smell, one of the best aromas' from an imperial stout. I like the slight coffee after taste, with a hint of choclate. It looked great as well, Great Lakes Brewery never fails to impress me. I think this imperial stout is just as good as Stone's stout and that is saying alot! try this beer it is great!"
"This is a beer I have been hoping would come about for a long time. As a lover of Great Lakes, I was thrilled to see them release an Imperial Stout. This is one excellent beer. Pours an appropiately dark black hue with a nice hoppy aroma. A very satisfying chocolatey coffee malty mouthfeel very solid complex beer. I am very pleased with the latest offering from GLBC."
"The feel is nearly perfect being, again, more akin to VSK than many of the more cloying and heavy imperial stouts. Drinkability here is limited only by the high ABV."
"Appearance: Pitch black, nice sized tan head about two fingers width deep as it dwindles patches of lacing cling to the sides of my brandy snifter. Aroma: Loads of roasted malts, creamy edged moccha explosion, with the chocolate layers very complex alcohol is there but not in your face. Nice hop profile in the aroma that is blended between everything else that's going on. Taste: Great blend of dark roasted malts, alcohol, fruit tones, and cascades, awesome stuff. Very balanced despite being on the hoppier side of the Imperial Stout spectrum. Mouthfeel: Full bodied silky texture to it coats the palate very nicely. Drinkability: Awesome imperial stout doesn't miss a beat. Great flavor and the drinkability is it's greatest characteristic, I sometimes find the Storm King a bit on the hoppy side this one does it just right for my tastes."
"I called this one a mix between Storm King and Brooklyn Black Chocolate, and that's probably a good way to describe it. A fantastic offering from Great Lakes as always, and though Cleveland still...well, the beer is good anyway... Certainly one that I'll have again."
"Okay, I guess I will be the first to give my opinion on the lastest and greatest from Great Lakes. I believe this imperial actually replaces the Emmet Stout, but I am not positive. The beer poured as black as the night with no light even remotely penetrating that dark mass of liquid. It formed an dark tan foamy head that disipated, coating the glass with lace. The aroma was a heavy mix of hops, malt and roasted expresso coffee, which just a hint of chocolate. The flavor was of malt, coffee, chocolate and a touch of raisins. The finish was a touch burnt and rounded out a bit light in the ending notes after showing a more medium body at the presentation. I will have to compare it to some others to find who it most resembles, but so far it reminds me of the non imperial, but great, Bell's Java Stout."
"Good tasty stout on special tap at GLBC. Poured pitch black with a tan nitro head and plenty of lacing up and down the glass. Smell was almost cloying as there was nothing but huge estery sweetness and tons of alcohol, but it was perfect for the weather. Taste was smooth and extremely full bodied with tons more sweetness such as caramel and fake maple syrup as well as a hint of roasted grain. There was also enough alcohol to put a surgery patient under. Mouthfeel was great as it was a nitro pour. This baby was rough around the edges and could do with some good aging, but it hit the spot perfectly. When I took the tour I found out they are planning on bottling this under the name ""Blackout Stout""."
