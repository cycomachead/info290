"Standard stout, but nothing I would pickup again."
""
"Certainly not as thick as other Imperial Stouts. Toasty and tasty. Dangerously drinkable for my taste. Another delicious offering from Two Brothers!"

"Poured pitch black into a stemless wine glass (shoot me, my snifter was dirty), clean division between body and the cocoa-tinged head. Looks were the best quality unfortunately. Didn't live up to the IS moniker to me... slight roastiness and bitterness on the nose, with a weird smoky note too. Bit smoky and pleasantly bitter on the palate, actually the smokiness would be perfect if this was supposed to be a smoked beer)... lacked some of the bigger coffee and chocolate flavors I expect, and came off a bit thin on the mouthfeel. Upside is that the wife really liked it, and that has to be taken into account, I suppose. Wouldn't search this out, unless I was in the mood for a smoked porter."
"A bit too far on the sweet side, which is fine for half a glass but drinkability suffers.  A bit drier and I'd like this a whole lot more.  Solid, but falls short of great."

"Overall: a poor example of the style although the high ABV is well hidden."
""
"This is a must try stout chocolate covered cocoa beans"
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a reasonable representation of the style that was easy to enjoy.  If we had to complain, the mouthfeel thinned more than we hoped, and contributed towards washing out the brightest punches of flavoring.  The best thing about it was hard to pin down, as the aromas and flavors naturally coiled into one another, but unfortunately the same dullness persisted throughout.  We were in a very stouty mood when we pulled this one from the cellar, and it shared between the two of us nicely, and warmly.  Going along with the bottle’s label, we too would recommend enjoying this beer by a roaring fire.  It makes the experience that much richer."

"Overall an easy to drink example of the style. Not quite as in your face as usually is the case, making this a great beer for someone wanting to try an RIS for the first time, but a bit intimidated by their strength. It is a bit on the sweet side, but still one worth checking out."
"O - A nice imperial stout that is easy to drink despite the higher ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good beer but the lingering bitterness brings down the score just a tad for me.  Nice complexity while maintaining drinkability.  4.25/5"

"I enjoyed my single bottle from the store and will do my best to get a 6-pack before the seasonal shipment leaves."

"Overall a super solid Imperial stout.  Not sure why a fair few people aren't that excited - it is a $12 6-pack classic imperial stout that checks all the boxes!  2 bucks a bottle people!"

"10/09/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. I feel guilty saying this, but if it were 2 years ago I would be ecstatic about this stout. Since then, there have been many in the genre that have out paced this effort. Not that there anything wrong here, it's just that there is not much to set it apart. Sitting in a place with 40 choices I realize that I'm privileged & the guilt sets in when I have to pass over such a noble effort. Looking forward to trying their vanilla bean brew."

"An enjoyable, almost sessionable imperial stout due to its thin body. The score reflects the thin mouthfeel and relatively simple flavor profile. However, what is there is very enjoyable. Roasty malts, tart cherry, dark chocolate flavors. Active, creamy carbonation which offsets the slightly viscous but thin mouthfeel. The alcohols are well integrated. My bottle was aged for approximately 7 months from purchase."

"O - ABV is well hidden, nice char, but too thin."
"I always enjoy a heavy-handed pour from a bottle. I have gotten quite good at knowing when to stop and the resulting pseudo-cascade is a sight to behold. I netted a sturdy two fingers of dense, deep-tan head as the result of my pour and it sat there stubbornly, like Pussy Riot after being released by Putin. Color was an inky, deep, dark-brown allowing less than ZERO light penetration (SRM = 44). Nose smelled of fire smoke and dark chocolate. Wow. Mouthfeel was thick and viscous and tasted and felt like a dollop of dark chocolate ice cream had been scooped onto my tongue. The 9.1% ABV was well-masked, making for an alarmingly smooth, easy-drinking beer. Warming, the chocolate flavors became even more prevalent and the smokiness began to wane. The finish was semi-dry, not really sweet at all, but not totally dry, either. I really liked this, despite not being a huge fan of the style."
"Overall, this is a no-frills imperial stout with solid flavor and a great consistency. One of my preferred brews from Two Brothers."

"Very good Imperial Stout, no defects, though not overly complex but still pleasant. Good bridge for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty and drinkable stout, goes down really smooth and hides its strength well. Pretty enjoyable and looking forward to more."
""
""
"edit: currently the ABV for this is 9.10% but the bottle label is 8.5%"
"Overall, not as flavorful as I usually like these beers but easy drinking and not too strong."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. Not a meal but not a an easy drink. It is meant to be enjoyed over time."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Two Brothers Brewing has done very well with North-Wind. The Imperial Stout is probably my favorite kind of beer, and this ranks right up there with the best, though the flavors aren't quite as BOOM as I would like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: good flavor on a light body for a RIS. if you are looking for a well made balanced stout, this is a great example. but really nothing to go out of your way for."
""
" The taste is has a dark and milk chocolate flavor with light caramel and mild woody hops with toasted grain and subtle creamy yeast which adds to the sweet malt body w/ a mild molasses type richness. Overall this may not be the most complex stout but still not really flawed and pretty darn drinkable because you barely taste any alcohol + the malt is sweet without being cloying. I could drink a couple of these easily."

"Overall - not superb but a really good introduction to the style. I had this after going through a succession of Russian Imperial Stouts that I wanted to love but felt were too boozy. They should probably be cellared. This you can drink and enjoy now."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very dark, perfectly black beer. The head is a deep tan color, leaving a lot of lace, but not very thick. The smell is layered and intense....smoke and alcohol...roasted grain, charcoal, wood, booze, and malt. The taste is not as complex as the smell, but is sweet, warming, and has an abrupt bitteness that comes in the mid-taste. Full and satisfying mouthfeel. Good."

"O: Decent beer, but not a great representation of the style. Typical RIS characteristics are somewhat lacking."
""
""
""
"O- This is a great beer, I poured it and before I knew it my glass was empty and I was wishing I bought a 6 pack of this beer. You could not drink it all day but it would be great for one of those snowed in nights."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is great. Nice thick body and moderate amount of carbonation keep this a highly drinkable velvety smooth brew"

"Overall a real solid Russian Imperial worth having and seeking out again, really did enjoy this one."

"Overall- Not flashy, but very, very solid. This would easily make my go-to everyday list if it were available in my area. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid, very drinkable RIS from two brothers - none of their variety pack has disappointed."
"Bottom Line: Decent stout worth a look."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty solid RIS that is cocoa and fruit forward. Smooth with hidden alcohol."
"O- Again. A dependable Imperial Stout. Recommended."
""
"D/O- Very drinkable for the style...a good introductory RIS. Thanks for leaving this at my place Zuidman, I owe you."
"Loads of roasted barley, caramel and smoke. There's not too much chocolate or coffee. Easy drinking for 9.1%."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a very dark black color with a tan foamy head on top. The retention and head are really quite good. The smell of the beer is roasted with some notes of chocolate, subtle sweetness too. The taste is rich with roasted malt and chocolate, decent bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty good, a smooth rich thickness. Overall this beer is pretty good. Not as rich or extreme as some Russian Imperials but still pretty good."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is maybe my favorite Two Brothers beer, I seek it out when I come to Chicago during the winter months and take some home with me to share…the flavor is robust and very tasty, but unfortunately it’s a bit watery and that rushes the mouthfeel away…I do find that after 15 minutes out of the fridge, the coffee aroma and flavor awake, taking the flavor to another level…in the future, I’ll set the bottle aside a few minutes before opening…while all it’s components may not be “world class”, the flavor is outstanding, making this one of my favorite stouts...overall, I couldn’t recommend this brew more, if you see it at the store (or me with one), give it a try…(4.5/5)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On a later re-tasting I did not like this nearly as much and it had a slightly sour taste."
""
"Not the biggest Imperial Stout out there, but quite tasty. Quaffable, to say the least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Last year this was one of my go-to imperial stouts. This year... not as much. Still, for $10/6-pack for a 9.5%ABV brew, I'm impressed with the value. There's better taste for taste stouts out there, but for the price, this is a really solid offering."
""
"This is a really, really nice Imperial stout."
""
""
"O- it was a decent stout that I'd drink again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think Two Brothers is one of the better breweries in my home state of Illinois. Their beers tend to be very solid. This beer is one of my favorites and can go toe to toe with many other American Stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is an average RIS. Not spectacular but by no means bad either."
"I think the low bitterness units on this beer make it far more accessible to those folks who are afraid of stouts or do not like the style. I am a big stout guy, and I'd endorse this beer for the neophyte or the seasoned stout fan. Pick up a sixer today!"
""
""
"This beer is very strong, but very drinkable. I could definitely have 2 in a night. It isn't perfect, but it's close. I do not consider myself a stout guy, but I really do like this beer a lot. It isn't perfect but it is very good. Well done once again Two Brothers. Well done."
""
""
"This is basically just an average Russian Imperial Stout. Not bad, but there's really nothing that makes it stand out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, there are several other stouts I would choose before this one."
"Personal Rate: 4"
"Overall, this was a well-balanced, slightly lighter than expected stout that I would rate in the upper half of its class."
""
""
"This one lacks the complexity of some high ABV stouts, but it's still really tasty, and could be somewhat drinkable since the really dry finish leaves you wanting another sip of initial sweetness. It's a vicious cycle. Could be dangerous!"
"O: I doubt this beer won’t blow anybody away, but it definitely could be an archetype for the style. The texture, the nose, the balance…everything here is exactly what an RIS is all about. That said, I doubt I’d pick it up again."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, lot 51, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings to the glass, with slight alcohol legs. Aromas of big milk chocolate, roasted malt, smoke, cream, toffee, caramel, and light herbal. Very nice and unique aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of milk chocolate, smoke, roasted malt, toffee, cream, coffee, caramel, toast, and earth. No bitterness after the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, cream, toffee, and earth on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slick mouthfeel; a touch thin for 9% though. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial stout. Nice balance of robust and unique stout flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with medium-low levels of carbonation. The result is a smooth, flowing stout that goes easily across the palate. Ethanol is felt just slightly on the throat, nothing in the nostils, quite nice for a 9.1% beer. Finish is dry with little residual stickiness on palate."
""
""
""
""
"O - Just the thing to sip on a cooler day, Two Brothers' Northwind Russian imperial stout is a thick, black beauty, rich with roasted malt characteristics of chocolate and coffee. A beautiful blend, especially paired with some chunks of dark chocolate."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not too bad. Flavor is mildly complex, the aroma is good but a little weak. Overall very drinkable however with well hidden alcohol content."
"D - This stout is robust and roasted to the point that it really tastes like a coffee stout. It quite a contrast compared to many other imperial stouts that finish much sweeter than this one. This relative dryness allows it to be fairly drinkable even though it does nothing to lighten the overall experience or hide the alcohol."
"The body isn't as big as one might expect and, I'll admit, perhaps not as big as it should be. It does have a richness to it, though, a nice flow, smoothness, and a nip of crispness to keep it moving."
""
""
""
"O - I'm ambivalent about the smoke, but overall it's the light body that really hurts the profile."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not impressed by this one. Following it with a hop juice black... hopefully that will treat me right!"
""
""
""
""

""

""

"O=My bottle had been in the cellar for 3+ months, and probably was on the shelf for a month or two before that. Very nice beer that is good by itself or may go well with red meat or barbecued chicken, perhaps. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is like a RIS-mini, or even closer to a Porter. The classic RIS profile is subdued in every way and the beer is thin and flatish with no warmth on the throat."
""
"Characteristics: smoky, matly, slight dark chocolate, bitter orange rind. Drinks smooth though. Not overly harsh/bitter as some stouts in this genre can be."
"Dark black stout with 0 transparency. Poured with little head and left no lacing.   Sort of disappointing. The aroma was really nice with a whiff of black licorice. The flavor was good as expected by this genre of beer. Bits of coffee, carmel, and roasted malts as a stout like this should have. The body was thick and kinda heavy. At 9.1% alcohol it's not something you can just throw back while watching the Superbowl.  Overall it's pretty good and I would drink it again, though for my money I'd opt for Ole Rasputin which is still the standard.   Decent effort, but not the top dog. "
""
"O: a delicious brew, lacking a bit in complexity but incredibly deep, really delicious"
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent beer, but not one of my favorites and certainly nowhere near the best Imperial Stout I have tried."
"O: Alcohol is very well hidden in this beer - both in the taste and the smell. Very enjoyable and a very well balanced beer. Some complexity in the flavors. Good beer for a cold winter day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting, rather smoky imperial stout. Different, but pretty tasty. I like the variety in the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: as always, if you like stouts/imperial stouts it is worth a try. For me, the gold standard in stouts is Old Rasputin. This beer is not as smooth or mellow, and it is not as sweet either. A decent beer, but not something that I would purchase again unless I craved a stout and had no other choices available."
"Taste-Dark roasted coffee and cream,faint dark fruit, dark chocolate. Subtle hop note in the slightly warming finish. Friendly and pleasant, a nice imperial stout to cut your teeth on, or just a mellow-drinking sipper for a cold night."
""
"Poured aggressively, rewarded with an inch of tan foam over a black-oily looking brew. The foam dissipated quickly leaving a thin skein. Smell was light. Roast malt, chocolates just not much of it. Taste was a definite improvement over the nose. Nicely roasty, bittersweet chocolate, raisins, vanilla, a nice bit of hops, too. Good balance, creamy mouthfeel with a stiff carbonation keeping it interesting. Some sourness appears during the finish. Good flavor, easy to drink, enjoyable if not spectacular."

"I'm partial to Two Brothers since its my local brewery. This was one of the first Imperial Stouts I've had, and I always enjoy it. I do admit however that there are plenty of better examples of the style out there."
""
""
""
"Overall - Im shocked how smooth and one dimentional this beer is. Nothing strong, groundbreaking or special about this. The booze is well masked, this is closer to a porter then anything. Too mild and smooth for what style it is. Its decent but not close to being a top ris."
""
""
"12oz bottle, poured into a snifter. Poured near-black with a very thin, tan head that left minimal lacing on the glass and dissipated completely rather quickly. Aromas of coffee and roasted malt are noticeable. Tastes seem to be muted, even as it warms. Roasted barley, coffee, burnt sugar, and anise are present with a slightly hoppy finish. Alcohol is warming, but well concealed. Carbonation is low and mouth-feel is smooth. Overall, I seem to go back and forth with this one every time I have it: sometimes I love it and sometimes I'm disappointed. It's a good example of the style, but seems to be lacking."
""
""
"O- good ris, but nothing special. At 9% I could drink a 6 pack over a night though because of the drinkability."
""
""
"Overall: Tastes good but not the best stout. Definitely does not taste like a 9% ABV beer .. more like 6%. Strong roasted stout with a dry finish makes it easy to keep drinking this one."
""
""
"O: This is a good RIS, but in terms of the whole broad spectrum of RIS's, I think it lacks just a bit. Very little carbonation, which if it was more viscous, would be fine. For the body, imo, more carbonation needs to be present. The flavor overall was good, but was a little bland. Nice job of covering any boozy flavors; I did not detect any. The mouthfeel is also very nice. I would by this beer again at the right price and certainly would not turn this beer down."
""
"VERY DISAPPOINTING, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I ACTUALLY LIKE TWO BROTHERS' BEERS (NOT ALL, BUT SOME)."
""
""
"O: Nothing extraordinary, but quite solid and enjoyable. In a style with so many outstanding examples, I'm not sure it's one I would seek out, but definitely not one that I would turn down, either. Certainly worth a try."
""
"O: I first tried this beer when it was refrigerator-cold and the taste was too sharp. I tried it again after letting a bottle warm up a bit and it was a much better experience which let the subtle layers of flavor beneath the loud toasted malt shine--definitely warming up a bit is necessary for this. It's good, and I'd have it again, but it's also not one of my top favorites."
""
""
"Overall - This is a good and enjoyable RIS, but in my opinion doesn't quite stand out. Decent for the style."
""
""
"overall: super sweet, above par, smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Roasty malt, slight coffee and milky flavor. Cant notice the abv at all. Overall, its slightly lacking...but a decent RIS."
"The toasted malt taste overpowers anything else on the front end, but there is a slight taste of toffee & chocolate (like a Heath bar). The back end is subtle hops, but I was still tasting the malt. Definitely a heavy, chunky feeling beer. Let it sit out a bit, it gets better toward the upper 40 degrees. I was impatient, and I wish I had waited."
""
""
"D - Kind of missed the whole RIS - strong Imperial hop and roasted taste; slightly above average RIS; easy to consume; plenty of light stout flavor; needs a bit more hop and roasted malt punch"
"O- Not a bad RIS, but nothing memorable and just lacks the complexity and mouthfeel I look for in the style."
"Meh, an average at best RIS. It lacks oomph and boldness. The roasty and chocolaty flavors needed to be ratcheted up many notches. The mouthfeel was also a major letdown. Too thin and watery for the style. Overall, not wholly terrible, but not an RIS worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"O: Too thin a little and a little one dimensional in terms of the flavor profiles. Not a bad beer, but not one I'm going to seek out again."
"Mouthfeel is excellent for an imperial stout. Smooth, creamy and shy on the carbonation. The slick feel coats your mouth and leaves you with a nice malty aftertaste. A good beer but not really one that pushes the limits or raises the bar. Good enough to drink but there are better ones to be had."
""
""
"O- not bad still tasty , just not the one i will look for 2brothes is a solid brewery, one that i look for and drink year round this stout is not at the top of thier offerings but still worthy of a try"
"Overall - While it may not be bursting with flavor like other Imperial Stouts I've had, this is fairly easy to recommend because it's flavor isn't overpowering to the point where it drives others away and the other factor is that it's just a really smooth stout!"
"Pretty satisfied overall. I have 5 more and I'll probably sit on a couple until next year to see what happens. Pretty solid, not as complex as others of the style, and a bit sweet also. I'll get it again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice brown head but it doesn't last. Dark brown almost black. Foam dissipates quickly to a ring with minimal lacing. Idont get a lot of smell. Some sweet malt and coffee but it's light. Balanced taste. Nice malt,coffee and some caramel. Medium mouthfeel with light carbonation. Overall this is a good stout. great taste & easy to drink."
"Brothers has to offer."
""
""
""
""
"O: My favorite Two Brothers beer and I've had it all ways (cask, draft & bottle), but always a very good and well balanced imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, but not as good as the other beers I've tried from this brewery, which have been impressive. A solid B, I guess, worth trying, but probably won't come back to it in a crowded RIS field. Nice price though."
"Overall this seemed like a great desert beer, not something I would drink quickly, but rather something I could nurse with a full stomach."
"This is a nice beer. I have had both better and worse. I would not go out of my way to have another one."
"Overall it hard to say it but this beer is right on par with southern tier Oat. Great sweetness with a balanced roast and very drinkable. At 2.19 a bottle I now kick myself for not getting a sixer since it's so damn tasty. Not sure why this has a B rating since it screams A quality."
"Poured slowly down the side of a glass, there really is no head to mention of. A sniff of this stuff reveals hops, cocoa, and coffee. Mouth feel is just about thick, but not overbearing. Taste reveals an exceptional balance of malts, hops and sweetness. Much better blended then Storm King which i think is way to hoppy for my tastes. Northwind is a wonderfully easy to drink stout that, even though has a relatively high abv, doesn't knock your socks off with the burn. I think this stuff is slightly better then Rasputin, which i think is excellent in it's own right."
"This beer poured really dark with a thin head as about as dark tan of a head as you will ever see. The beer smelled good and I woyld not hae guessed it to be over nine percent alcohol but it is. Stout it is! The taste was a more biter than I prefer but it was alright tasting. Mouthfeel was average and oevral a decent stout.l"
"Poured from the bottle into the trusty shaker glass; served nearly room temperature. Poured a nice dark black color with a creamy brownish head. Aromas of coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste was wonderful malt, coffee, dark chocolate and no hop bitterness in the end. I'm glad I still have a few bottles of this left; will be nice to have after a day on the slopes next ski season. Best brew I had in the evening Friday, the 27th."
"There's plenty going on in this beer as it warms up - and it's definitely a long-drinker. Is it the best Imp I've had? Not by a long shot. Is it a solid beer? Yup."
"Smooth and creamy, rich and chocolaty. Yea, this is my kinda stout. Alcohol prevalent, but smooth and blends well with the other flavors. Finish is pretty dry considering the full body and residual sugars up front. There is some hop complexity and bread-dough yeast as it warms. I dont think this would be a great candidate for aging, but right now, it is damn good! I am very impressed."
"O: Northwind imperial stout falters in a lot of ways but it's really impressive in the one aspect that really counts: flavor. Not much to look at or smell but this imperial stout is incredibly balanced and displays the perfect amount of dark fruit, roasted malt, and chocolate sweetness. Definitely worth a try."
"Taste: There is some roasted bitterness with a little bit of sweetness. There is somewhat of an alcohol taste that is present at first but leaves quickly."
"Overall, I was happy with this beer, but it wasn't my favorite imperial stout. Worth a look for sure."
"Overall this is a very competent imperial stout and although I may not go hunting around for it, I would certainly order some or pick some up if I come across it again. Enjoy!!!"
"Overall: Full disclosure, I had no idea of the ABV or style of the beer when I was drinking it. It was billed at my bar as a stout and I enjoyed it greatly as a stout. I can see why people expecting a big imperial stout have been disappointed - the amount of bitterness in the brew really reminds me of a regular or even a sweet. However, the body of the beer, the drinkability, and the nice malt bill made this a very enjoyable beer. Cross ""imperial"" off the name and I think it would be better reviewed."
"I can't speak much to the complexity or balance of this beer. Personally, I find it a bit sweet for my liking, but I do enjoy the presence of the ""darker"" sweetness. The characteristic smokiness is also present, but it's not too overpowering. I have a feeling that this style is really more of an acquired taste; however, this shouldn't stop you from trying it."
"Overall I think this is just a very good RIS. It's not anything flashy or fancy, but a very enjoyable beer."
"O - This beer has pretty good drinkability. It goes down smooth and has a nice flavor. I could drink a couple of these in an evening. Overall, I thought it was a very nice beer. I just think it could have used a little more roasted bitterness in the taste, since it seemed to be a little more sweet than I would have liked it to be. Good beer though. I would try again."
"O - Overall, this is a well-crafted, clean beer. It is not as big and bold as many other examples, but it is very enjoyable."
"Pours jet black with a brown-ish head. In the aroma, sweet roasted malt and oatmeal. In the taste, roasted malt and a dry coffee, yet a bit sweet in the coffee. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry small presence of coffee and chocolate. Nice flavors and easy to drink."
"o - I am really surprised that I don't hear people raving about this beer. Fantastic milk stout flavor with a campfire of smokiness. Really great flavor and somewhat unique. Not sure if properly categorized as a RIS, but if so...a damn fine one and one that could be a gateway rauch."
"O - I like this beer...it isn't what I'd call an outstanding example of the style, but it certainly is enjoyable. This is actually a pretty easy drinker and has an absolutely silky smoothness to it. The sum is better than the parts here. This won't blow you away, but it is solid and something that I could easily have more of."
"D - Bleh. The taste is so incredibly subdued... it's really the opposite of what I hope for in an imperial stout. I expect huge notes in both the aroma and taste and Northwind barely fulfills the former and fails miserably at the latter. What's the purpose or point of this beer? Two Brothers advertises the unique hop addition to it but it doesn't work."
"Mouthfeel is not overly thick or heavy, but certainly not thin either. Lots of creamy, buttery character and a heavy dose of stickiness due to the sweetness. Finish is a mouth-smacking beast. Drinkability is hindered by the imbalance, but it isn't hard to drink at all."
"I think the drinkability of this one may be on the medium side as this one seems to be high in alcohol and not my usual style beer."
"Not bad on the drink. Lighter and not as flavorful and intense as other RIS's, but overall decent."
"Thick creamy mouthfeel, goes down smooth. The 9.1% alcohol percentage is a surprise, went down too smooth for that. Great beer."
"This is a nice easy drinker"
"This beer is not quite as dark as i would usually like for an imperial stout. It also is a bit lacking in lacing and head retention. The aroma makes up for its shortcomings in appearance. It smells of chocolate, roasted barley, and caramel. The flavor has these aspects as well, but adds in a subtle licorice flavor. Really enjoyable. The mouthfeel was full with a moderate amount of carbonation. The drinkability, is really nice on this beer. I barely feel the 9.1% at all. Really enjoyable and affordable RIS."
"On tap at Ginger Man. A very faint stout, lighter mouthfeel. Sour aroma. Smooth, until sourish finish. The best is the look, it is black and looks like an imperial stout,but it is not the best representation of the style.Still drinkable. Some roasting, maybe it needed to age more."
"D- Pretty drinkable. The high ABV would keep me at just one of these, but that doesn't mean it wasn't wast going down."
" excellent beer a must try and a cellar favorite."
"Batting fourth...North....Wind....Imperial Stooouuuttt! Was wanting a decent clean-up hitter for my four beer evening...and got it....cold cocked!!! The 2Bros Imp Stout....has some alcohol in it....let me tell you. Poured into a brandy sniffer and the color was a wonderful dark creamy pour, with tan foam head. Unfortunately the Alcohol over powers the sweet malty undertones of the nose. The taste is decent once the buds get used to the 9.1% ABV!!! Again the alcohol over powers the taste, which has roast, chocolate, coffee, and maybe molasses where perhaps the sweetness comes. Once Again....the alcohol affects the mouthfeel and drinkability. Session....no way...two would be tough to handle! This beer needs to be partaked on the wintry nights. Stay classy!"
"D- The feeling of this beer really picks up the slack of the flavors and aroma and drives home a solid beer. I easily finished this twelve ounce without thinking twice about the nine percent price tag to my liver. Impressed with this one from Two Brothers, did not expect it to be this decent."
"EDIT: On 11/27/11 I had a 3 year (09, 10, & 11) mini-vertical thanks to the Chicago Group. All three version were good, and very different. I liked the 10 the best as it smelled fresher and had a lot more coffee, but my I'm bumping my ratings up to 4/4/4/4.5/4.5 as I loved this one."
"D: Leaves an impression of weakness."
"M - Thick, creamy, silky. Moderate carbonation."
"D: A very solid Russian Imperial Stout that can be drunk very quickly! Be careful 'cause that ABV will get ya!!"
"D: This was such a wonderful surprise of a beer! If you can get your hands on this, give it a go."
"D - It's really pretty smooth, easy to drink. A little heavy, and somewhat strong, but it tastes good and I like the process of drinking it."
"Pours pitch black dark body full of malt and hops, dark tan head forming thick and dwindling slow, forms fine even lacing with eadh sip. Aroma dark chocolate malts, hints of coffee, and a touch of soy sauce. Flavor creamy dark chocolate, ripened fruit notes. A touch of saoy sauce. Mouthfeel is full bodied carbonation is moderate. Nothing heavy or cloying on the palate, drinkability is solid version of a great Impy Stout."
"Overall: A respectable example of a stout."
"With its thinner body and lack of harsh elements which would require blending with age, this is a good choice to purchase and drink right away."
"D - Again, the smoke stays with you well into the aftertaste, which knocks down the drinkability for me, but this is a highly tasty beer that I will drink that will be consumed back to back. Also, I'm not sure how this is 9% abv, it's hidden like a boss."
"Very drinkable at 9%. Be careful!"
"Beer is medium in body and holy hell is it bitter in the back. If there is anything else happening in this beer...any other flavors may only be captured in the orbit of this massive amounts of roast in the back of the palate. It's like a flavor avalanche that destroys a village of peaceful snow dwelling people at the base of a mountain...OK, that's hyperbole. It's not terrible but it's a one note wonder. Not great at all."
"Aroma is a nice mix of dark caramel and subtle hops. While the typical sweetness and roasty flavors of a stout are clearly present, a hop backbone comes through as well. Full bodied but not overly sweet, the hop presence and balance of flavors makes this beer quite drinkable (and the alcohol is well-hidden)."
"D: Very drinkable. I enjoyed this and would have it again."
"A really nice Imperial Stout. Lots of flavor, and a treat to drink. Something I would recommend."
"D - I can't say this was my favorite RIS I have ever had, but it was pretty delicious. For the price I paid, this was a pretty good deal."
"I cant say this beer is good, but there is worse. I mean the fact that its a B rated RIS says it all."
"D: This is a wholly enjoyable RIS, with plenty going for it. I would put this among the top of the second tier of RISs. If the mouthfeel were more satisfying, it would rub shoulders with FBS and Old Rasputin."
"D: Good stout overall."
"A great step forward for the Brothers Ebel. Now, age it in the French oak casks, and we might have something very special here."
"D: A very drinkable stout. Flavor profile is balanced. Stong flavor but nothing too overwhelming. I'm really slugging this back. Very good"
"A good beer and a good stout but in this style it's got some tough competition. That being said it's a lot easier to get my hands on than other R.I.S.s. It's definitely keeping me warm on this cold December night"
"D: Maybe it was the glass but this one was sort of a chore to get down. If I see it in the bottle I will give it a second chance."
"Overall: Its been said before and its true: this is a one-note beer. Its just a huge load of chocolate. That being said, they really milk that one note for all its worth; this beer is never boring and is remarkably smooth and drinkable. A good and unpretentious RIS."
"Drinkability -- Had you told me this was a milk stout, I would've given it much higher marks. Really lacks the complex character and dark fruit elements that typify the RIS style. That said, there's enough going on in the flavor profile to make it interesting and enjoyable. Glad I tried it, but might not seek it out again."
"D- Sits heavy but could put down a few over DA BEARS whoppin' that ass. A great stout @ $8.99 per six pack"
"Pours an opaque, nearly black with a thin film of reddish brown head that quickly dissipates. The nose is dominated by roasted malts - mostly coffee and chocolate. Some fruitiness (mostly plum) begins to become more noticeable as the beer warms. Taste is a complex blend of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, fruity esters, and some minimal hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and chewy with some alcohol warmth (particularly as the beer warms up). One of the more drinkable RIS."
"I've been waiting for this to come around again so's I could finally get a crack at it. It pours a slick obsidian topped by a finger of sienna foam. The nose comprises coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, and some light molasses. The taste loads up on the roasted malts, with some light cocoa, hop flowers, and light greens slapdashily tossed in, as though an afterthought. The body is fairly hefty, with a light carbonation and a semi-chewy feel. Overall, a one-dimensional stout, yes, but that one dimension is tackled very well."
"This beer pours a 'motor oil' black with no head. Coffee and chocolate dominate the nose. Those two characteristics take front stage in the taste. A slight bourbon hint and notes of hops creep up in the finish. A fantastic beer to warm your bones on a cold night, the Northwind is an amazing example of an imperial stout."
"This beer pours a pretty darkness with a finger of brown foam. The smell is a bit of oak, belgian-like aroma, brown sugar and a light roasted note. Most of the nose is really light. The taste has an odd hop bitterness that I didn't expect. There is a light bourbon flavor and a decent amount of cocoa. It must be said that this beer is a bit astringent on the palate and a bit thinner than I would have liked, but it is still rather drinkable. A good beer all around."
"Pours near black with a really thin mocha head. Not much lacing. The nose brings chocolate, roast, and a bit of coffee. The taste is of roasted malt with some lingering espresso and dark chocolate in the background. Not too boozy, but this is pretty light in ABV for the style. A bit of dry roast. Drinks quite well."
"D: This classic style is represented will with the Northwind. The ABV is hidden so well I could barely tell there was 9.1%(as per 2010 bottle stats.)"
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a brown color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight dark citrus, slight roasted malt, slight alcohol, slight hops, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, and slight dark citrus. Overall, good aroma, blend, and body."
"Drinkable I'm not sure of the ABV and Imp Stouts are large but I'm feeling like a better man having had one,so,I figure one more and I'm nearly perfect."
"D: The alcohol is masked very well from the taste so this is a very drinkable beer for the style."
"Drinkability: one and done, never again."
"The beer pours jet black with a clingy moderate tan head. The aroma is moderate-high bittersweet malt with moderate roast and a bit of chocolate. The flavor is very malty-intense bittersweet malt with underlying roast and bit of ash. The hop bitterness adds additional balance to the malt especially with slightly dry finish. The body is very smooth and full with a bit of warming quality in my belly. The carbonation is moderate. Overall a very well made IS and still having good drinkability--great on this cold, rainy evening."
"Avoid at all cost."
"This is a pretty solid stout. I had no problems putting a 12oz bottle away and found myself wanting more. Well worth a try!"
"An excellent brew that I will look for again."
"A very drinkable RIS, no signs of cloying or hotness. A solid RIS."
"overall a very nice beer. complex flavor and very drinkable."
"D: Not what was expected for style."
"D - it's worth a try."
"Poured into a snifter, opaque black color with a thin tan skim for a head. Whatever lacing starts to form slides down the glass with the alcohol. Great smell of dark fruits, alcohol, raisins and vinegar. Taste is very nice, strong boozy malts with a solid hop presence without being bitter. Nice and toasty. I'm actually getting a little bit of biscuit from the malts which is odd for the style. Pretty big body, you could drink this fast but that abv sneaks up on you! It's actually 9.1%, not 8.5% as it says on this site."
"Pours an opaque black with ruby red highlights. Topped with a thin creamy brown tan head which has great retention and sticks to the top of the brew and the glass. Warming sherry like arioma with subtle hints of fresh dark fruits. Sweet malty drink with a vinous quality and sweet fruity flavor. The finish is slow and lingers a bit too long. A little bit of cloying sweetness lingers with a soft warming sensation."
"D: A very easy drinking stout"
"Very substantial offering. I'd like six for this time next year."
"Drinkability was good. For almost 9 percent it was sessionable. Doesn't really taste like what you'd think of an imperial stout. Kinda similar to old viscosity but not as good. Worth a try but tons of other beers better than this"
"Overall Impression: Very complex beer with a variety of flavors making you want to take another drink. I drank a bottle of this a year ago before it aged and it was one of the best Imperial stouts I have had in regards to the fact that it doesn't have a big alcohol burn you normally get with most imperial stouts and it gets even better with age!"
"Im glad I gave this one a shot, cant wait to try more from this brewery."
"D: Not a bad drinking brew, especially if you like coffee flavored stouts. However, I don't think this quite achieves the taste complexity or body of most really good RISs. Watch out for the 8.5% abv too."
"Very taste and smooth, this russian imperial stout is a treat and easy to drink. Nothing really stands out but there is nothing wrong with this beer. Plain and simple, it's an easy drinking russian imperial stout."
"D - Easy enough to drink; it's decent overall. Not particularly interesting & maybe a touch too sweet."
"D - nothing earth shattering, easy to drink, smooth, but i probably won't search it out again."
"D - Lacks the complexity of other beers of the style, but very easy-drinking. Pardon the abuse of the term, but this is almost a sessionable big stout."
"Vintage - Winter 2008/9"
"Drinkability is average at best. I am not a big fan at all. This is my second beer from these guys, and I'm not sure I want to try many more. I'd still like to note though that this wasn't a total disaster, and there is definitely the potential for this style to get much worse, which is why I didn't give it a D or F. I just tend to avoid those bad examples."
"Overall, for the price this beer is pretty decent. I have had a ton of better RISs, but they are normally a lot more expensive, so I give two brothers props on this. It is fairly drinkable, as it is nothing to big. I dig it for what it is."
"Flavor was rich and creamy, big fruity component, fig & plum, plenty of mellow roastiness and chocolate notes. Very creamy but still relatively light bodied for an RIS. Fairly dry in the finish, almost woody suggesting oak. Had to re-evaluate this after the tap sample, pretty impressive stuff. Make an oak-aged version!"
"Two Brothers is generally a brewery you can count on for good beer. That's exactly what you get with Northwind. It's not great by any stretch, but it is very good. With a couple of tweaks, it'd easily attain a higher score. The nose could use a little strength and the flavor could use just a little pizzazz. More hops or some spices might do the trick. Overall, I'm pretty impressed with Northwind. It's good beer that's probably a little better than this score might indicate. Not much, but a little. Definitely recommended."
"Not the best RIS out there, but a damn solid one certainly worth a try."
"D: A very drinkable brew, but seems to be missing something to be a damn good imperial stout...definitely worth a try, but there are better ones out there..."
"Overall the tap version of this tasted a little cleaner however whether it be tap or bottle this beer still didn't quite deliver. Not a bad beer but not worth seeking out."
"I found Northwind to be a very good Russian Imperial. The flavor was strong and tasty, with chocolate being most prominent. The price was also right at $1.99 for a 12 oz single, a bargain for this style. Another good job by Two Brothers Brewing."
"Easy to drink and doesn't fill you up like some imperial stouts do, but the flavor and body could be a little more robust."
"D- Easy drinking considering it's an imperial stout(ABV) but it would be difficult to have more than a couple in a night."
"Poured black with good carbonation and a brown head. Nose is roasted malt, cocoa, coffee and a lingering sour funk...uh oh. Taste is immediate funkyness, sourness, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee but that damn sourness was terrible. Mouthfeel is warming, sour like it was either infected or had a buttload of rotten green apples dumped into the mash. Drinkability, no way. Avoid and this was among the worst RIS I have ever had and I have had my share."
"D- Good for an imperial stout. No taste is too overwhelming, not too sweet, pretty balanced. A fine example of a seasonal stout, just a little on the lighter side of the big imperials."
"D: The last two years of this beer were unimpressive but solid, this years seems to be up a notch, particularly in relation to its balance. Because of this balance, and the incredible value (10.99 per 6er), this beer is highly drinkable."
"Based on the rating system on this site, I now see why it gets a B average. All other reviewers probably aren't the same as me, but what I thought was a great beer only ends up getting an average rating, all because I didn't dig the mouthfeel. Oh well, it's still a good beer and I would gladly have more."
"D: Really more of an Imperial Porter than an RIS when compared to most US examples of this style. I quite liked it. Perfect for a cool evening. The strength makes it a good candidate for a nightcap."
"Pours black with a small tan head that quickly fades to a collar of bubbles. Just a little bit of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Has a nice roasted malt aroma with hints of dark fruit, chocolate, and coffee. Has a touch of sweetness in the flavor that is kind of unique with its subtle dark fruit notes. It is not until the finish that things turn bitter with the roasted malt and hops. The hops give some floral and herbal notes. A little solvent like alcohol warms and cleans the palate. The body feels a little light for a RIS. Carbonation is nice. A nice drinker but kind of average when it comes to RIS."
"Overall, the flavors mix quite well here...it seems to be balanced, and is pretty tasty."
"A black mahogany color with a modest tan head and very little lacing. The aroma brings a pleasant licorice and roasted malt. The flavor is very similar to the aroma, maybe more chocolaty with the licorice still a mellow lead. It's a bit sweet but has a woodsy buttery malt and mild citrus hop all in a mid-bodied brew with light carbonation. Alcohol is not much notable so it's plenty drinkable. Kind of unique and enjoyable."
"D - Pretty solid Imperial Stout overall. Nothing amazing, but quite drinkable. Alcohol isn't too obtrusive either."
"An average Imperial Stout at best. Just nothing here overly impressed me, save the aroma, which finally got going a bit once it hit room temp. This was my second time experiencing this beer (the first was in the bottle) and my opinion remains unchanged."
"i could have two or three of these on a cold night.it's a good sipper.very reasonably priced too."
"Everything in this beer balances nicely. It's hoppy, but the bitter is balanced by the malt. It's highly alcoholic (8.5%) but the warming is subtle on the tongue. Despite the high ABV, this is a good drinking beer."
"Taste has a bit more roasted coffee beans than you would ever pick up in the nose. It's a nice touch. Medium depth on the mouthfeel. Works well with the bitterness and the carbonation. I would like to see it be a little more creamy and more chocolate on the flavor. Still, it's a decent Impy in it's own right."
"Good selection from TB - reminds me much of the good ol' Old Rasputin."
"D: I don't know what is going on with this beer. It really misses the mark and is quite disappointing. Thin, burnt, and sour, but (thankfully) with not much of a residual aftertaste, I simply couldn't enjoy this beer. Eventually I bellied up and ordered a Cane & Ebel to help me get this one down."
"Overall not bad at all. Nothing going to blow your mind here, but I have to say this was a more then solid effort on their part. I would have no issue at all with having this one again, in fact I might look for it as it really seemed to go over quite well."
"Drinkability: As a big RIS fan, I was not a fan of this big RIS. Fruit accents are nice, but this went over the top. Finish didn't resemble an imperial stout in the least bit. This wasn't terrible, but it definitely wasn't for me."
"overall there are better irish dry's then this - not a beer i will seek out again but will see how it ages"
"Pours aa turgid dark brown with lots of small floaties, and little head. A bit viscous. Smells of licorice and bit roasty. Th taste is a bit more complex and has more oomph. More licorice and roastiness, and a hint of bitter chocolate. Long finish. Very, very smooth in the mouth, and overall a little flawed but still quite pleasurable."
"The mouth is thick and ashy, but with a buttery smooth finish. Oily but more ashy as it warms up. It's pretty good. Very thick, though, so repeats might be a tough sell. Still, it's a balanced, complex stout."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Pours a very deep dark brown color with a light brown head, average head retention, leaves a little sticky lacing. Hints of mocha and espresso in the nose, a little roasty but not much else. Roasted malt and bitter chocolate dominate the taste, some burnt wood action, and mocha flavors finish things off. A moderate chewy body with enough carbonation to ease the drinkability; finishes with a roasty bitterness. A straight roasted RIS, not much in the way of viscous flavors or hoppiness."
"D- The beer tastes good but is hardly an imperial stout. It's not dense enough in flavor or viscosity. Resembles more of a standard stout, other than the ABV."
"In the end I would say ""yes"" it's a good value."
"Overall: The mouth feel is creamy and flat. The body of the beer is medium full and the finish is flimsy. This is a rather poor RIS, There is no hops a little flavor and not much else. Rather disappointed, I was hoping for more."
"This beer poured solid black with a thin chocolate head. The aroma consisted of roasted malts and fruits. I found the alcohol to be masked very well. The problem I had with this beer was its carbonation. It is overly carbonated and doesn't match the profile that I am used to. Regardless, it is a good drinking beer but not something I will search out again."
"An easy drinking RIS with ""Drinkability?"" I'm not sure where I stand on this one. I guess I like it?"
"A very drinkable RIS, but on the light side for the style."
"This isn't very good. Two Brothers has disappointed me three time in a row. I hate to give up on a brewery, but I'm close."
"12 ounce bottle, lot 3508, bottle says 8.5% ABV. The beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is OK, lacing is very good. The aroma is roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and some molasses. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also burnt/charred malt and caramel that I can taste, along with a bit of hops in the slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with average carbonation, it's slick but it's also thin for an Imperial Stout. With that being said the mouthfeel isn't bad, it's just not as rich as I'd like my stouts to be. Drinkability is pretty good, it is very smooth and easy to drink. That's where the thin mouthfeel helps this beer. It is very easy to drink. The alcohol isn't very noticable either. I think this is an overall good beer, I would pick this up again in the future. Not a bad choice at all!"
"D: Very good. The lightness of the body increases the drinkability."
"Another impressive brew by Two Bros. that I would recommend."
"Poured into a tulip a black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with lots of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some vanilla, chocolate/toffee. The taste is very nice, sweet, malty, with nice touch of chocolate/toffee notes. Medium body, this is not a high ABV IS, but very tasty. Very drinkable."
"Pretty good Imperial Stout. If there is such a thing as a sessionable RIS, then I guess this would have to be it."
"Thanks guys...I am becoming a big fan."
"M: Full side of medium body. May be more carbonated than most. Rich, creamy and smooth (though a little less carbonation would help)."
"D= I was really blown away by this beer. An excellent RIS for sure, on par with (or at least worth mentioning in the same breath as) Old Rasputin. Not the strongest of RIS' but the flavor was so good I didn't care. Highly recommended!"
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is one inch of tan foam. It recedes slowly into decent lacing. The aroma is of graham cracker, roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate. The taste is of very roasty with notes of chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a nice stout. It isn't the biggest Imperial Stout out there, but it is very solid nonetheless. I will certainly drink this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Goes down fairly well, but is not leaving a big impression. This is OK at best"
"D: Very drinkable. What I like about two brothers is that they play with the traditional takes on a style and cross pollinate them with others. To me this was a RIS with a milk stout. Their tripel was really a Belgian IPA. I have enjoyed their stuff when I can find it. Thanks to Mr. Ed."
"This is a pretty drinkable, not bad at all."
"This is an easy-drinker version of the RIS. Good but not outrageously so. A solid brew."
"Overall I really enjoy this beer, I think it is underrated and a great value for a RIS."
"D - The beer goes back easy but misses the mark on the style's coined boldness. A sipper, definitely, however needs some help in the roast area of flavor and aroma. Two Brothers, please revamp this beer."
"Drinkability is moderate. The beer is fine, but in the grand scheme of things it's nothing special. Just another boring Imperial Stout. I would really have liked to see the alcohol ramped up a bit with a little more complexity of flavor as well. 7.5%(I thought it said 8.5 on the bottle) is a bit on the light side for an Impy stout, at least for my tastes."
"Overall, this is a decent example of a Russian Imperial Stout, but not big enough for me. It's reminiscent of an English version RIS and I prefer the extreme American RIS'es..."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: This beer did not live up to my expectations. It had a nice aroma, but the flavor is amazingly one dimensional. The roast character dominates and leaves little else to be detected. Moreover, there is a complete lack of the thick chewy coating body that I expect from a high gravity sippable beer. Instead, this beer is quite thin and even dry after the swallow. I think this is very uncharacteristic of the style and not what I really want to sip on a cold winter night. For the price, it's not bad yet I would suggest spending a couple more dollars and picking up one of the better RIS's out there."
"This may not hold the abv girth of most Imperial Stout's, but who cares? This is great stuff. I Wish I lived near this Place. Would love to try this one from the source."
"Pours the darkest of browns with a thin tan head.Excellent retention, and very nice laceing.Aroma is of coffee and maybe some dark fruit and chocolate. Body was smooth,silky, and mildly carbonated. Taste was coffee and fruit up front with a dark roasted finish.Hints of chocolate through out. Excellent."
"Not a bad, reasonably priced Impy."
"I don't think this is quite in RIS territory - more of an American Double/Imperial. It's a solid brew, but I don't think I'll be drinking a ton with the excessive carbonation and so many better stouts out there."
"Worth a try."
"Very easy to drink and will be picking up more of this to share with friends. A perfect warmer in this bitter winter (-19 today)."
"D-A lighter RIS, compared to some, but nonetheless quite complex."
"I poured this beer into a tulip shaped glass. The head was a coffee and cream color, about a finger think, it receded quickly leaving lacing up the glass. I got coffee and chocolate off the nose, the taste was mostly coffee and dark chocolate with a slight berry background (think a good dark chocolate). The mouthfeel is satisfying, not as thick as some of the bigger Imperial Stouts. Very drinkable for the style. Hops are balanced, no bitter aftertaste. I alternated 3 Northwind's with 2 Dogfish Head 90 minutes yesterday, can't complain. I want to taste one next to the Victory Storm King this week."
"D- I could put away a few, but not really a session beer. Two to three in a night is good for me."
"D- Very drinkable very smooth and finished without any hint of burnt coffee."
"Coffee roastey malt taste. A little smokey, smooth and velvety with a somewhat surprising off dry finish. Taste is a little underwhelming. Very lightly carbonated."
"D - This is a pretty nice imperial stout. It's not overwhelmingly alcoholic and tastes very good."
"Taste is very nice. Extremely smooth and creamy, almost like an oatmeal or milk stout. Very smooth notes of coffee, chocolate, very mild dark fruit. No noticable alcohol at all. Not hugely over the top but a nice smooth, easy to drink stout."
"2008 bottle, 45 IBUs, 8.5% ABV. Poured into a snifter, dark brown, not quite black with a small head that quickly disappeared and no lacing. Nice chocolaty aroma, dark fruit, decent hop presence in the nose, very light coffee aroma. Flavor of roasted malt, light smokiness, hints of coffee. Very dry, barely any malty sweetness. Bitter and roasted. Medium bodied, light carbonation. This is an OK RIS, but after the brews I've had recently, this one just doesn't cut it as one of the best."
"Eh, this is a pretty good RIS. If you're new to the style, I'd recommend trying it just so you can prep yourself for the flavor overload of other RISs. It's one to try, but I'm not crazy about it."
"D- Ok, not great I probably wouldn't have again there are much better examples of the style but this is average."
"Overall: I love it. I'll definitely be picking this one up again to have my friends try. Once again, very impressed with what Two Brothers has done here but I'm usually impressed with what they do."
"Pours black with a thin tan head. Nose is coffee and roasted tones. Flavor is thick in malts. Nice enough level of molasses and chocolate. Smooth and slightly sweet. Feel is quite smooth on liquid. Carbonation is lower but a it should be. This is a nice RIS that is easier drinking than it's more flamboyant counterparts. Not a wad of complexity, but nice enough to be able to enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, with a touch of oily residue left on the palate, this is a very easy, drinkable RIS. I'll have another!!!"
"The aroma is misleading, this sure is flavorful. The mouthfeel alone is reason enough to try it. Outstanding for the style."
"D- theres little to no trace of alcohol in this one, but the thinness and sour aftertaste make it so finishing more than one wouldnt be desirable. im going to have to try this one again fresh and maybe change the review. a sour RIS makes me think something was wrong with this bottle, maybe the liquor store i got it from didnt treat it as well as they could have."
"Drinkability- Very smooth on the drinkability scale and I would love to try it on tap."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Would like a touch of chocolate, smoke, or coffee though."
"It's a pretty good beer, and nothing Two Brothers should be ashamed of by any means. But I find myself demanding more malt, yet again. Other Russian Imperial Stouts fit the bill better than this, though it's worth a try."
"Pours a deep, lightless dark brown almost black color with 1 pinky of creamy tan head, average retention with some good lacing. Smells of dark fruits, chocolate, roasted malt, oat, and molasses. Tastes of raisins and other dark fruit followed by chocolate. A sweet molasses-like backbone also contains some flavors of oat and roasted malt. Finishes with some smokiness and a touch of citrus bitterness. Medium in body and low in carbonation, semi-syrupy with good dark fruit flavors as well as chocolate and a touch of roastiness and hops make a nicely balanced RIS. More mild than some of the big bruiser RIS out there, but very flavorful and low in ABV making it easier to drink."
"D: Big RIS flavors and aromas + medium sized RIS abv% = excellent drinkability."
"As if it wasn't a treat on its own, you can get a Northwind Float at the Tap House. Like beer heaven."
"Overall, I wouldnt grab this about because of the super sweet taste of this imperial stout. Just not a big fan"
"Poured oily black with an aggressive bubbly tan head settling to very little, leaving bubbly lace. Only a few deep red highlights catch on the bottom of the glass. Roasted grain and fruit scents brim from the glass, with prune, burnt wood, and smoke. An interesting mix of sweet, tart, and sour aromas. Taste is unique and inviting, with a good deal of cocoa, dark toasted bread, and juicy dark fruits. A light smoke flavor seems to tie it all together very nicely, giving it a mature taste. Finishes with some clean hop bitterness. Sticky, smooth, and slightly dry on the back end. Though differing from many RISs in feel and taste, a very unique and great beer on its own. Excellent drinkability, very palatable and easy to consume with a reasonable abv. Not what I expected in a RIS, but an excellent brew."
"The brew pours a light canceling jet black liquid. Liquid is notably thick with a thin dark beige head. Nominal lacing. Smell is roasted malts with coffee and chocolate making their presence known. Some tartness is noted. Taste is chocolate coffee with a sweet raisin note over a faint hop bitterness. Not overly complex, but extremely balanced. Mouthfeel is fairly full due to the thickness of the beer. Does not finish as clean as one would like. The heaviness of this beer hurts its drinkability. Though it was still enjoyable."
"Give this a whirl. It fits the RIS class, but it is a tad bit different giving me exactly what I would want from a small high quality American brewery."
"Drinkability - a well-constructed beer, another one wouldn't be out of the question, nor would laying a few down for some cellar time. Big for a stout, a little light for an Impy. No matter, this is on the short list for a tasty winter warm-up."
"22 oz bottle. Pours black, nearly opaque. Almost no head, beige, quickly diminishing. Light fruity aroma, maybe cherry or cranberry. Malt flavor up front, ends on bitter chocolate. Light aftertaste of bitter chocolate. Light to medium body, almost no carbonation. Alcohol hidden well. Very drinkable, but more so for the imperial stout drinker than others."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, malty scent that boasts of black and chocolate malts. It seems sweet; not overly bitter. The taste is good. It has a sweet, chocolatey flavor that goes down smooth and finishes with just a bit of black malt and hop bitterness. This tastes like more like a chocolate stout than a RIS. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is damn fine beer. I'm not sure why it wasn't reviewed better, but I really enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: Great, considering its low abv for the style and lack of an overwhelming mouthfeel. I won't touch more than 1 bottle of an RIS, but do as you wish. This beer is worth trying, since it only had a $5 price tag."
"Cheers!"
"D: To be honest I almost wanted to pour this one out after the first sip, but it grew on me after a while, not much mind you but not terrible."
"Solid - I would like to try this brew in the dead of winter."
"Drinkability: Not quite to style (not big enough and it is a bit too sweet and fruity); more like a Baltic Porter, in my opinion"
"Smooth and creamy on the palate. Heavy but not too syrupy. Pleasant and good all around."

"When I initially had this, it hadn't reached the market yet, and I couldn't wait for it to get there. This a highly recommended offering. A smooth and well-balanced drinker, this maintains a nice coffee/chocolate backbone with nice notes of vanilla & oak. Dark and heady. I can sum this up with one word. Excellent. Pricey, though."
"The imperial stout category is something of a category of giants. Looking at the other beers of this style I've reviewed, they've been largely excellent. Dark Lord, Old Rasputin, Great Divide Yeti, Brooklyn Black Chocolate, Great Lakes Blackout, and Alesmith Speedway Stout are all fantastic beers full of lots of dry roastiness and full mouthfeels. And this one fell short, at least compared to those others. While I'm a big fan of Two Bros beers, I thought this one was disappointing and not very drinkable. Flavor was not very roasty and mouthfeel was a bit watery. And maybe it was when I had it in my evening, but this beer made me feel exceptionally full which led me not to finish it. Unfortunately, the next day I'm unable to articulate what exactly it was I objected to."
"This tastes more like a Belgian export stout than a Russian Imperial. It'd probably have a higher rating if it was labeled as the former, actually. Still, at 3.99 a bomber this was quite the deal, and it's nice to come across a strong stout that's still highly drinkable and doesn't kick you so hard in the ass."
"Medium mouthfeel which isn't that bad. A little lingering flavor. This one isn't that hard to drink, nothing to be offended by. But no flavor in this really. Nothing I want to revisit."
"Flavor is solid RIS. However, not one dominant flavor, just bunches of malts, chocolate and coffee tones. Come candy tones too such as licorice and caramel. Also getting some daker fruits--cherries and old dried apricots. Mouthfeel is perhaps a bit thin and watery but not too off for the style. A very easily drinkable RIS without any off-the-wall flavors or ABV."
"Overall a tasty, chocolate stout. However, I did find it to be too mild to have the title 'imperial'."
"This was so intensely metallic and sour that we drainpoured it. I feel bad saying so, but this is just not a good offering."
"Would have given this a 2.6 or 2.7 in some catagories but that is not allowed."
"Overall, this beer is a mild version of a typical Russian imperial stout. The malts were not quite as roasted, the hop profile was weaker, the ABV was significantly lower and the beer generally seemed to be sweeter (at times it tasted like a hybrid of a Russian imperial stout and a sweet stout). While this made for a rather tasty and easy-drinking example of the style, it is understandable why many purists may find this beer disappointing."
"Pours an opaque black, brown edges, very thick tan head, great retention, some lace spots. Smell is sweet, coffee, soem chocolate, caramel, cherry, burned aroma, not bad. Taste is smoky, chocolate and coffee roasts, fruits, more roast, burnt caramel cocoa finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, a sweet and easy drink, hides alcohol well. Burnt flavour is slightly annoying though."
"D - This is probably the easiest drinking RIS I've had. The thin body and not overly complex taste make this one go down quick and smooth. I certainly like this, but it's almost more like an imperial porter than an imperial stout."
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a dark brown with two fingers of tan head. Smells of nuts, cocoa, coffee, and roasted malt. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, mildly roasted coffee, and raisins. Medium in both body and carbonation. Finish is dry and slightly bitter. The alcohol makes it's presence known in a small way. Not bad."
"Not to bad, but a little light for imperial stout."
"D - This is pretty good, the first sip I was a little turned off but after a few more I began to like this beer more."
"Pours with plenty of bubbly head, looks like chocolate milk minus that it's nearly opaque black in colour. A wild, organic essence (probably from the type of yeast) underlies the aroma along with notes of chocolate malt, a seperate bready yeast, light malt. Distinct cherry in the aroma. Medium bitterness with flavour of cocoa butter most predominant. A neat stove top roast - toasty and smoky - like if you leave something on the burner. The smokyness really suits the flavours well although is a little off-putting in the aftertaste. Doesn't taste a decimal over 6%."
"D - Not a very good beer. It is really tough to get past the vegetal taste."
"This is a very difficult one to swallow for me. The most difficult characteristic is the nose; i can hardly stand to get my face near enough to take a mouthful. There is a significant harsh acidic after taste that puts it to bed for me."
"Gracias to BA JeffKrenner for the bottle!"
"D: Thin, watery, and just plain off for the style. Pass."
"d: goes down easy without any offense but it's not something that i would buy again."
"Drinkability - Alcohol warms you a little much for more than one."
"OK, why are the scores so high? This beer improves in a massive way as it warms up. Rich, roasted malt tones become more pronounced as does the nuanced sweetness. Drink this just under room temp and I think you'll enjoy it a whole lot."
"Drinkability - this is decent, but not great. High abv also holds down sessionability."
"Purchased at Sams and cracked at a time when I was. Chilled a little under cellar and then thrown under warm water to expedite the process. Used a tumbler, the color is dark coffee black, with half inch tan nougat color head, with expectable lacing. Smells slight fruit esters which I did not expect in a RIS, but this is not necessarily unwelcome. There is some toffee, coffee, grape-ness. The taste is decent, but I feel like its lacking in several key areas namely strength, body and focus. Where I was expecting these things I got a couple other interesting things like some fruit and maybe some extra chocolate or coffee than usual, but these things to me do not make up the lack of the other stuff. This is not a bad RIS, but after tasting the good stuff ""storm king", stuff like this is far less tasty. I for sure will not buy this again, but if it comes to you for free try it and you'll better understand the good stuff."
"D - After doing a monster RIS tasting, this one falls squarely in the above average category, with not a detriment to be found. Still, there are points where it could be more exciting, but it's nice to have a ""go to"" RIS when a bomber of most others would put you over the edge of comfortable."
"Poured a dark black with a tan colored head; it even had a bit of a reverse cascade to it. Smell was of cocoa, chocolate, earthy hops and roasted coffee. Taste was much of the same, but this beer felt a little green to me, and the others who tried it. It had a very nice finish to it, and we seemed to agree that with a bit more age on it, this would be a much better beer than it already is. Higher side of medium bodied and lower carbonation. This was pretty nice, and I am going to pick up a couple bombers to age next time. I think this one gets much better with time."
"Unlike most other imperials that leave you sated after a bottle or two, I would have glady had another one or six of these, and that would have left me pretty useless for rest of the day. It is dangerously drinkable, which is quite an accomplishment in this style."
"Inky dark brown to black with a small, short-lived, light cocoa brown head. Nose of fresh-roasted grains, rye bread, chocolate pudding, and swampy cocoa beans. Roasted bitterness up front followed by moderate chocolate and dark fruit. A little astringent throughout. Dark chocolate bitterness in the finish. Not too bad. A lighter, medium-bodied stout that runs a little thin for my likes."
"With a vigorous pour you do get a inch and a half of milk chocolate colored head setting atop an oil black body. Very sweet rich smokey malt feel on the nose with a nice chocolate feel. Smooth and silky thin as it enters the mouth. Very pronounced sweetness and maltiness is soft and mocha like. There is a coffee like bitterness that lingers a bit on the finish. Alchol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is very soft for a Imperial Stout. Not one of your more bolb entries in this style catagorie, but very drinkable."
"Thanks to mattcrill (Stoutness) for the trade."
"Overall impression: A little light on the mouthfeel for an impy stout. A touch too bitter (possibly from the black patent). A higher mash temperature or bumping up the unfermentables in the grain bill would put this over the top. A solid offering and with a few tweaks could be world class. Recommended."
"22 oz. bottle. The label states 8.5 % ABV, lot 36. Pours a very solid black, no highlights, no light coming through. Thin tan head disappears very quickly. Roasty, espresso, and dark chocolate aroma along with a hint of dark fruit. Roasty flavor, with some cocoa, but not much fruit. FInishes somewhat dry. A bit thin, however the carbonation was appropriate. Not complex like others in the style. Not bad, but not much depth to this one."
"A moderately paced drinkin' stout. Not super complex nor impactful as most Impy Stouts. but does the job just fine for when in the mood for something on the darker side."
"Medium bodied that thinned just a smidgen too much by the end of the bomber. But all things considered, this was a darn fine mid-west cut at an RIS."
"A tasty RIS that is worth trying. A good flaw free RIS that isn't one of the best but a very good choice for those that like them smoky and on the bitter end of the spectrum."
"A very dark black beer, cannot see any light thru it. Has a small creamy light brown head. The aroma starts with a solid cereal malt note. Followed quickly by a wonderful coffee/chocolate character. Your mouth is greeted by a robust roasted grain flavor that moves smoothly into chocolate/coffee character. With the chocolate hitting first and leaving the finish for the tastebud tingleing bitter coffee note."
"Mouthfeel- Rich, but not too rich for an RIS. Not too mention nutty and creamy."
"This one hit me just right. At 7.5 abv it is on the lowere end of some Imp stouts I've sampled, but the quality is excellent. It pours mahogany to balck with a small head. The smell is a combination of smoky, malty witha faint hop presence. The taste shines....smoke, malt sweetness, coffee, sugar candy and hops..excellent. The mouthfeel was smooth, and almost creamy. This made for an extermely drinkable brew. Highly recommended."
"Poured almost pitch black. There's no light getting through this one. A two inch head faded to a 1/4 inch within about a minute. Smell is chocolate and oatmeal. Taste is smokey and chocolatey sweet. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and has a very slight bite on the finish. Overall, drinkability is good. I like this one enough that I'd definitely buy it again."
"A good all around RIS. Nice roasted character dominates the beer. Would have liked to have seen a little bit more presence from the alcohol, but it was well balanced and very drinkable."
"I'm more of a fan of easer to drinks beers, and this one is not at all easy to drink. It burns and is very filling, but with that said I really enjoyed this brew. The long finish with it's very detailed avenues of maltness. This beer taste awesome. But drinks honorably. Which is perfect for the style."
"Flavor is similar to advertised by nose, starts with some sweet malt qualities, chocolate and brown sugar with molassess again. Then it rolls to some roasted malt and a hint of bitter espresso as well. Maybe the bitterness is actually from hops as it develops to more of an herbal/resiny bite than coffee after more sips. This is a sipper as it is large and robust, but no hint of alcohol so be careful. The drinkability is high and I would recommend this brew to others. A nice stab at an Imperial Stout. Look for it!"
"Pours a two-finger light brown head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Totally black color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose. Starts with a malty roasted coffee flavor, hint of hops in the finish, the higher ABV is not noticeable. $4.70 for a 22 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Mouthfeel: This beer is light to medium bodied. There is a nice balance between malty and hoppy. I would have liked a bit heavier beer. Overall not a bad drinking beer. I dont want any more of this. There are better beers to be had at this price."
"The harsh flavors and the thin body, combined with the higher ABV of this beer means one bottle is almost more than I'd want."
"This stout was most notable for it's roasty flavor. Beyond the roastiness, it needed to be amped up a little more to be a great impy. Imperial stouts are not subtle beers. Northwind needed more body and flavor."
"First time i have seen this one, bought a single bomber. served chilled, in a pint glass. Poured a deep black with a short tan head that dissapeared quickly into a small ring in the middle of the glass, with almost no lacing. Really didn't get too much smell from this one. Had a creamy , almost coffee taste with maybe a hint of chocolate. This beer i thought had a creamy , milky kind of feel to it. Although it was very drinkable i have definatley had better. Biggest dissapointment of any two brothers i have had thus far."
"Brought a bottle back from Madison, sat in the cellar fridge a couple months. Lot 3345 is printed on the label."
"oh, good. an imperial stout for me to try at our MCD meeting! I brought along a Bells Expedition stout too but i'd already tried that before so I was glad to have a new one in front of me. Pours black with a small white head. I actually expect a good RIS to have a darker head or none at all but whatever. Nose is of plums and roasted malts and chocolate. Smooth roasty flavor, molasses, sweet and some complexity. a bit thin on the mouthfeel maybe but ok. fantastic drinkability. not harsh or boring. just right. i could go nuts on this baby."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"Verdict- The richness and body you would expect from an Imperial stout is here, even if it's not the most complex one on the market."
"I like the folks at Two Brothers and this one drinks fairly easily...I would try this one again when I see it on tap, but I won't be stocking up on this one at this point."
"883"
"Aroma is fairly hoppy, but with an odd lager-like aroma and very little roastiness, but some minor coffee notes. A deep black body lies beneath a dminishing mocha hued thin film of a head. Flavor is a nicely burnt/roasted melange of coffee and dark chocolate, hearty dark fruits and malt. Alcohol is almost unoticeable and the palate is thinnish."
"If you've had Founders breakfast stout, you can imagine this stuff. Just reduce the coffee component by about 75% (making it just right in my opinion). I couldn't drink more than one, because I was trying too many other beers. But I'll get this again if I see it."
"Not a bad brew though."
"I found out after trying this fantastic brew that it regularly comes in six packs as the next in a series of seasonals, but the brewery couldn't get the six-pack holders made in time, so they put it in a 22oz bottle this year. This beer pours brownish-black with a beautiful cascade and complimentary colored head. It smells the way a cup of coffee would had that cup been made by Hershey's. Yum! The only flaw in the whole beer is the mouthfeel, it could have been a little bit heavier for my taste. Some Russian Imperials can come off way too bitter or way to chocolate-y, not this one. It has great balance throughout and it's not too hard to put down a few bombers, even if it is 7.5%."
"22 ounce bottle, 8.5% ABV on label. Lot 3345. Thanks beerinator!"
"Very smooth and creamy mouth. I like this beer, great one to share & savor. Im kind of surprised its not rated higher, but to each their own. One of the better offerings from Two Brothers."
"Drinkability: Skip it, this may be one of the weakest and the lowest ABV Imperial Stouts I have run across."
"Nearly black in color, slightly brown, but poured almost zero head. The smell is basically burnt, but it's hard to tell since it is so very faint. The flavor proved to be more of an eye opener, with some fairly intense burnt malt flavors, but that's about all. Not much coffee, chocolate, but those flavors grow as I drink. The hops are there in the background, but nothing to write home about. The mouth feel is pretty thin, thinner than I expected. The carbonation is low, but it cuts through the thin beer like a knife. At least it's not syrupy. The 8.5% (as listed on my bottle) is masked well, though. Unfortunately, I am just not all that impressed with this beer, and as I recall, I was not impressed by my last one from Two Brothers. It seems like they cut too many corners to achieve the style."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is very silky smooth with a well balanced taste, but its not as heavy as I would have liked it to be. This stout could have more body to it. It's a semi drinkable beer with nice chocolatey aftertaste, but just not enough."
"D- Although the alcohol content is a bit lower than I like in an Imperial Stout, it does have some unique flavors that are very nice. It does have a good malt base but it does have an interesting aged cheese flavor that I haven't found in any other beers. Maybe yeast characteristic? Nice beer and I will have to get a few in the winter months."
"Northwind Imperial Stout doesn't seem much like a RIS to me. No matter, it's still good beer. Despite its minor flaws, I found a lot to like in this bottle."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a minimal brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head what there was, is gone almost immediately, leaving a few little areas of bubbles around the edge, and lacing as well is minimal to non-existent. Aroma is dark grains, and that's about it. Taste is sweet dark malts upfront, some coffee bitterness, and a dry close. Seems closer to a regular stout here. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both not bad, but heaven forbid one rate against the style, this one would be out the door. Not bad for a beer, but not to style, in my mind."
"Mouthfeel is medium light and slightly dry. The body here is weak, even for a stout. I shouldn't find it this easy to down an imperial stout. This doesn't really excite enough to drink more. I'll leave one in my cellar and see what happens to it."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out black, with no head at all. Sweet chocolate and caramel aroma. The flavor is sweet chocolate with some bitter coffee. This is hardly an Imperial Stout, though. This beer is thick without being big on flavor. On top of that, there is very little carbonation, so it is like drinking sludge. Low marks for drinkability. I think I would have liked this beer more if it just had some bubbles, although it still wouldn't be an imperial stout."
"Drinkability is above average but if this in a Impy Stout I'll eat my left pinkie. Just not much oomph to this, pleasant enough beer but really thin for style and a little bit too one dimensional on the sweet side."
"For me it just barely fits in the imperial stout category. If it were classified as an American stout, the scores'd be a bit higher."
"Nice rich stout. Aromas of strong coffee and molasses. Quite bitter tasting from dark malts (black patent?) and variety of hops. Roasted and chocolate malt flavors pervade. Pours almost completely black (as should be expected) with a creamy tan head. I am a sucker for stouts and this is a nice one overall. I have had better, but this one is a nice affordable mainstay."
"Rocky tan head falls quickly over pitch darkness with redish brown glints as light refracts off its edges. Arising aromas of coffee bean, prunes, bittersweet chocolate are carried to your nose by is fine appropriate carbonation. Creamy medium body with flavors of caramel, fruit,black cherry molasses and balancedhops. Finishes dry and bitter with roasted flavors. Mile IBUs and abv a nice stout but only a warmup for a great RIS."
"Ya never know what to expect from the Two Brothers; a murky black, with a thin yet dissolving tan head. Anise, black licorise and coffee beans on the nose. Somewhat thin, yet creamy up front; a massive espresso twang to it. Sweet tasting; dark chocolate noticeable; some caramel and warming coffee notes. Expecting more of a belly warming effect for the style; yet, this doe not disappoint; sticky molasses left on the palate. This should be rated top in the Not to the style listed on the label, but still pretty good category; a decent stout."
"Thin on mouthfeel and with a strangely annoying sting blend of hops and dry roastiness. I like some of Two Brother's beers ... but this just has average written all over it."
"This isn't as substantial as most imperial stouts, but is still a good one that is worth a try."
"Pours a very dark brown with a very small tan head that doesn't stay long. A little light comes around the edges. The aroma has a strong presence of roasted malt and coffee. Promising. The flavor has a lot of coffee in it and not much else. It also seems like the body could have a little more. Seems a bit watered down and thin for an imperial stout. Not a bad brew, but not the best imperial."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown. Thereis just a hint of light through the top and there is no head except a small tan rim around the top. The nose has some dark raisin/fig tones to it along with a bit of mocha as well. The flavor was not what I would expect; it was thin coffee, almost a bit watery and weak. The feel was also a bit thin as well with a hint of creamyness. Drinkability is just ok. Its a decent beer, but not really special."
"Dark brown but with plenty of light coming through at the edges. Theres virtually no head and what does form fades quickly. The aroma is roast, raspberries and nuts. The flavor adds a bit of chocolate and nougat to that combination. Still, this is a very light Imperial Stout. Itd be a decent sweet stout, but would still be a bit thin."
"Pours a dark copper brown color with noticeable flakes of sediment floating throughout. Nose is dominated by roasted malts and grains with a touch of cocoa beans in the background. A bit thin in body for the style and this is paired with a minimal amount of carbonation. Taste begins with notes of dark fruits along with some unsweetened bakers chocolate. A touch of acidic coffee and bitter hops are present towards the end. A decent enough brew but not quite what I expect from an imperial stout. Thanks to faernt for the sample!"
"I find this to be a food beer more than a beer I'll drink alone. I'll drink it with Chorizo flavored fajitas and Chicken Mole. It's a good beer but not to my expectation of style."
"Body is actually a bit thin for the notion of an Imperial Stout. Probably best to think of this as an Foreign Export."
"This beer is a little difficult to judge... when compared to other Imperial Stouts, it doesn't have many of the requisite traits needed, and thus falls short. When judged on it's own, however, it's quite a tasty and drinkable beer, that is priced really well. ($8.99 for a six pack)"
"Very nice, full body with plenty of character to please. Easily consumed, this beer would fit well in an all-star stout session. Definately one of the best Imperials I've had."
"Comments  Special thanks to qarre for organizing the BIF 5.0, of which I was the first recipient (yippee!) and the lucky beneficiary of this promising effort from Two Brothers."
"Thanks to Darkover for hooking me up. Pours a deep dark black with a thin and quickly disappearing brown head. Slow, creeping carbonation up the sides of the glass and thin lacing. The aroma is bitter roasted coffee with a bit of malt. Not as rich as most Imperial Stouts, and not quite as flavorful either. There is a nice coffee flavor but not much malt to counterbalance. There is a small amount of chocolate in the flavor as well. The finish is roasted coffee. On the Stout scale this is pretty good but on the Imperial Stout scale it falls short. Still not a bad brew though."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a pitch black with a decent head that didn't stick around long. Some lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is chocolate and roasted malt, with a heavy dose of espresso thrown in. For style this is pretty muted as an imperial stout, but I still find it very good and enjoyable. The taste has the roasted malt and coffee, but in a subdued way that makes it a very drinkable beer. Got to see what this thing is like after some more aging."
"This beer poured very black, with no light getting through it. It had a light tan bubbly head that left only trace lace as it subsided. The aroma was of malt, hops, chocolate and some coffee. A flavor of malt, hops and chocolate with some coffee elements. A bit lighter than most beers of this style with a slightly bitter finish. Not one that will challenge the great imperials, but it is not a bad beer."
"I really liked this stout and I'm going to store some back for aging. I'll others will as well."
"2-year old bottle. We sampled this at the homebrew club meeting, so these are consensus impressions. Very smoky and tobacco-y, with a dry finish. Not quite to style (though with a beer intended to age, it's hard to keep the flavor from changing) but an enjoyable brew. Extra points for its unusual, but very pleasant smell."
"Northwind Imperial Stout from Two Brothers in Chicago. Very thick and dark brew, light cannot penetrate it at all. The head was thick, toffee tan, but not particularly long lasting. The aroma is nice, somewhat chocolatety, with hints of coffee. The taste is nice, extremely malty. The dominant flavors are espresso, chocolate, and just a tiny bit of liquid soap, but that is not half as bad as it sounds. The body is light, perhaps too much so for the style. Not bad, worth sampling. Nowhere near as big as some of the other Imperials on the site."
"Opaque with dark brown tints and the thinnest layer of cocoa-hued bubbles. Roasted chocolate malt, espresso, and nutty aromas persist. Coffee, chocolate, roasted nutty malt with an accompanying sweetness lend to a a mild, earthy hop bitterness on the finish. Finish is reminiscent more of a traditional Imperial Stout rather than some of the more extreme American versions. Body borders on medium-full, rather than simply full like some others. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and elegant with mellow carbonation that works well. Two Brothers makes a very drinkable Imperial Stout with this one, and while it is indeed good, it lacks a bit of character that keeps it from being truly great. A nice stout, nonetheless, and one I will revisit."
"Mouthfeel: Unfortunately it has a very light mouthfeel & is a bit thin by this style's standards. Somewhat roasty, but not what I'd expect fm an imperial"
"Lacks the complexity that I come to enjoy in better Imperial Stouts. This clearly is not one of those. Later on, others flavors come to mind, and I'm tasting brandy, molasses, dates. Why so slow to show? It's too late, I'm bored already."
"A rough pour brings up a full tan head over an opaque black body. When held to the light, reddish-mahogany highlights are visible at the base of the glass and just below the surface. The head drops fairly quickly; but it does maintain a thin surface covering and leaves some tight, spotty lace. Roasty notes dominate the aroma. It's quite black-coffee-ish with a decent amount of prune-like fruitiness thrown in, and even some sweetish dark chocolate. The moderate carbonation is very fine; and helps to boost the creamy character of its surprisingly only medium body. Rich flavor, however, is where this beer shines. It's loaded with notes of bittersweet chocolate, burnt caramel, dark fruit skins, black cherry, burnt ""late-night diner"" coffee, blackstrap molasses, and leafy hops. It finishes dry and bitter, but not overly long, with a residual coffee/chocolate roastiness. Well-balanced and nicely done. Worth trying."
"Black, with a light, creamy brown head. Leaves good lacing. The aroma is chocolatey, with a deep roastiness toward the end. The flavor is chocolately up front, it then flows to a light roasty, coffee-like flavor. It finishes dry with burnt roast malt bitterness. The texture is somewhat oily and creamy. A very tasty full-bodied brew."
"Lighter body that most Imperials with appropriate carbonation. Drinkability is a toss up. It goes down pretty smooth and easy, but I was hoping for something a little more satisfying."
"If this wasn't an imperial, I would have a little more higher ratings for it. But it just isn't cut out for the real imperials out there. It's a good stout, and that's it. It's opaque black with a medium-sized and thick creamy tan head. The aroma is strong roasted malts and hints of chocolate. The flavor is very roasty, robust porter-like in a way, kind of sweet, with a nice bitterness coming through on the finish. I found some sourness on the finish as well, kind of annoying. It's kinda worth a try maybe sorta....I dunno. I won't buy it again."
"I can't believe they call this an Imperial Stout...It's a decent tasting ""Stout"" if you leave the ""Imperial"" out of it...It is medium bodied rather than over-the-top thick...the nose is mainly cocoa and coffee beans but very soft....the taste is burnt malts and some coffee beans but lacks complexity....finishes with a bit of a hop bite which is surprising given the low IBU...Call this a ""Stout"" and it rates high ""3's""...as an ""Imperial"" I feel I'm being generous giving it low ""3"'s...no carbonation at all hardly and that combined with the creamy texture allows this to be very drinkable as a ""Stout""...not as an Imperial...I want more....I deserve more....If a beer is called Imperial it should have more than just a high ABV..I feel like I'm being too hard on this because as I drink it is is pretty decent....it's just not close to being a good ""Imperial Stout""..."
"This is not a great Imperial Stout, but it is better than their Iditorod Imperial Stout from the same Brewery I had a few years ago."
"Not quite as strong as some Imperial Stouts, at only 7 percent alcohol by volume,but still a very tasty stout. The most dominant malt flavor is that of chocolate malt. Good hop and malt balance, though the malt tends to dominate the flavor profile. This stout isn't very roasty and tends toward being sweet. It is relatively big bodied, but not huge enough to be called ""Imperial."" A decent stout, but better examples of this style are out there."
"Pours black. Little to no head. Very little lacing. Faint roasted malt and hop aroma. The taste is likewise: toasty malt and a complement of hops. Very mild. The taste and mouthfeel are more along the lines of a Porter rather than an Imperial Stout. A very drinkable beer but not very representative of the intended style."
"Dark ruby-black in color, has a small tightly bubbled tan head. Sweet, roasted caremel and coffee aroma, sweet plum-caremel flavor. Medium-body with creamy, smooth and slick mouthfeel, seems a little light for the style, still all in all decent stout."
"Drinkability: It's not a bad brew...it's just a little mediocre compared to it's competition. Why drink this when there are other Imperials with more body and character? At least the alcohol is hidden well..."
"Easy drinker, and a pretty decent stout overall. I gave it some leeway because of this. However it is lacking in most imperial catagories."
"Opaque, murky almost black appearance, with a residual reddish-skim head. Aromas seem decent, promise fruits and some burnt java. Slightly oily mouthfeel, malting is dry and somewhat Irish-style in some senses. A bit of anise and plum to the impression with a full swallow. Bitterness in the aftertaste, some from the hops, and it builds with continued sips. Overall, I liked this beer, but without interesting sweet complex tones it lacks as a brew in the Imperial Stout category."
"Poured out a nearly an opaque black with only a ""surface"" head (or practically no head) that was brown and faded to nothing. Thin chunky lacing that slides back down the side of the glass. Aroma consisted of dark roasted coffee and roasted malt. Fair carbonation on the tongue. Mouthfeel is thin and smooth, being just a tad bit watery. Robust roasted malt middle with an introduction to a bitterness that resumes in the finish. Dry finish that has a stale coffee taste and seems slightly oily. Bottle label lists alcohol by volume as 7.5 %. An okay Imperial stout that would be better is it had a little more body and a more complex finish."
