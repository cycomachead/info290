Outstanding body for a non-BA stout. Thick and chewy, as it should be. I absolutely love this stout and the only thing holding it back for me is the slight smokiness that I would happily trade in for a touch more sweetness.

4.38,0.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Probably the best Imperial Stout (non-barrel aged) that I have had.  Nice bouquet of coffee and some vanilla.  Texture is thick, creamy, and silky with a nice level of carbonation.  Taste is so well balanced.  Lots of coffee flavors and a little bit of sweetness, but not too much.  I have found several stouts to be overly sweet and it just gets to be too much by the end of the beer.  That was the thing I like best about this is the level of sweetness was dialed in perfectly.  There is a light level of bitterness that lingers on the finish. Also this does not have any harshness like some of the other Imperial Stouts.  The 10.5% abv is well hidden and it is easy to drink fresh and doesn't need age, although I do wonder if it would get even better with some age.  I would rank this above the top competition like Expedition and Speedway (both of which I thought were very impressive) and the price is fair too as it is half the price of Speedway.

Legs on the glass as well when you swirl it around. Nose is filled with chocolate, vanilla, port, coffee, and booze, although the sum is not great as its parts. It falls apart a bit upon tasting.  Way too heavy on the burnt malt. Big espresso notes as well as bitter dark chocolate. Very bitter in fact. Full bodied with a chewy texture. Booze remains prevalent throughout the beer. I put one of these bad boys in the cellar to revisit in a year. Hoping some of the burnt flavor will mellow out. Hate to say it but I don't get all the Founders love. I've been generally disappointed with most of what I've tried.","Jacobob10","Feb 27, 2015"

Extremely smooth and well balanced.  Aftertaste is much the same on the back end with maybe more coffee.  Extremely smooth and drinkable.  32oz gone in a flash.  Well hidden abv.

It could almost be described as a distilled imperial stout, with all the flavors magnified beyond the usual imperial intensity. The hops definitely make a very strong appearance at the end - this more than anything else spoils the experience a bit for me. I wonder if it would mellow out a bit if you cellared it for a few months. Also, the malt end definitely falls on the sweet side even for the style. Overall I prefer a little more subtlety and balance in an imperial stout (both the Old Rasputin and the Narwhal accomplish this), but it's worth it to experience Founder's version.","maedhros09","Feb 16, 2015"

Delivers an obsidian black color, with a chocolatey, quickly dissipating head. The aroma is powerful, including dark-roasted coffee, chocolate and molasses scent. This is reflected in the taste, which starts heavily roasty and finishes like a mocha with strong espresso and sweet dark chocolate notes. Leaves a long-lasting imprint of dark chocolate on the palate. Overall, a fantastic stout that delivers a smooth 10% ABV amidst dark, sweet flavors.","TheElectricOne","Feb 07, 2015"

Pours absolutely sheer jet black with one of the darkest brown heads Ive ever seen. head dissipates quickly leaving behind the viscous, oily brew. Rich creamy mocha greets you on the nose complemented by toasted malt, and chocolate covered cherries. Taste is a tidal wave of bittersweet chocolate up front with a mellow finish of earthy tobacco, and roasted coffee. Feel is thick and oily, coats every inch of your mouth. A bit sticky. but it comes with the territory. Definitely a slow sipper. Overall, one of the kings of the heavy stouts. Great in all aspects.","Samuel906","Jan 26, 2015"

4.88,11.9,4.75,4.75,5,5,4.75,"Poured into a stout glass. Deep, dark, like the abyss.  Nice 2 finger head of dark brown.  Took off a couple for a few too many large bubbles.   Great lacing and leaves a thick layer of creamy froth as you drink.   Smell is roast, malt, coffee, chocolate and dark candi.  Just what a stout should be.   Could be a hint stronger, otherwise steller.  Taste is ambrosia. Sweat chocolate, coffee, hints of dark fruits, with roast and malt bitters and some earthy hops.  Feel is spot on.  Creamy, full bodied, effervescent.  You can't ask for better.  So this is almost the perfect stout.  As an Imperial it could use a hint more hop bitters, the head could be just a touch creamier, which might happen with age, and the smell could be subtly more intense, which would happen with the extra hops.  This is a really really good beer.","DougT","Jan 22, 2015"

3.41,-21.8,3.5,2.5,3.5,5,3.5,"Overall: My overall experience with this beer is that I like it a lot and I would drink it again. Although it is fresh it tastes faded, but somehow it works. Was the beer aged extensively prior to bottling? I don't know. I would recommend drinking it "as is" and not aging it further. I would drink another bottle of it, but I probably wouldn't keep a sixer around.","teromous","Beers"

Aroma of chicory, roasted malt, burnt wood, liquorice, prunes, soy sauce, dark chocolate and caramel. Medium sweetness and quite high bitterness. Full bodied, chewy but with a silky smooth, luscious texture. Low carbonation and a very long, burnt tar finish. Gentle warmth from the alcohol. A wonderfully complex drop and an excellent example of an imperial stout.","magpieken","Dec 16, 2014"

4.5,3.2,,,,,,"Poured a pitch black body letting no light through with a one finger, thick tan head. A wonderful looking Russian Imperial Stout, one of the best. Scents of rich roasted malt, dark chocolate, a light milk chocolate, coffee with cream, and a bit of rich caramel. Overall impression of aroma is of a rich, deep, complex Imperial stout aroma that is wonderfully balanced and true to style. Very chocolate-forward and roasty and pleasant. Flavor begins rich and full, with notes of roast malt, a bit of a smokey flavor, sweet chocolate and bittersweet chocolate, light notes of alcohol and caramel. Middle opens with more moderate alcohol, continues with more roast malt, smokiness, rich cocoa powder and bittersweet chocolate. Caramel drops off. Finish is medium-sweet with a high presence of alcohol, moderate roast malt and smokiness, medium-light bittersweet chocolate and coffee with cream. Aftertaste is dark roasted black coffee, rich cocoa powder and bitter roast malt with a light alcohol presence. Overall impression of flavor is of a bold, roasty, smokey, boozy Imperial stout that is still balanced by a nice sweetness that switches between caramel and chocolate and a wonderfully roasty and coffee-like aftertaste. A very robust flavor profile and nice, though intense. Mouthfeel is full bodied medium-light carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Alcohol burn is not present, despite the booziness of the flavor. Overall impression of flavor is of a full bodied and smooth Imperial stout that is very nice and true to style. Overall this is a good Imperial stout. It has a wonderful aroma profile that is very pleasing and a nicely robust, rich and deep flavor profile that is pleasantly boozy. Mouthfeel is true to form and quite smooth. A very good Imperial stout, well worth trying thought not quite as good as FBS and KBS.","Auraan","Oct 09, 2014"

Flavor is all chocolate. Not any alcohol taste, even though it is 10.5%. This is easily the thickest beer I've ever felt. Even thicker than Bourbon County. There is some peaty roast flavors as well now that I've gotten used to the chocolate. I’m sure as I drink more, I’ll taste more.","kkleu357","Sep 07, 2014"

The taste is similar, like dark chocolate, with strong hops and some alcohol showing through. This beer strikes a particularly good balance between hops and chocolaty sweetness for an RIS. The mouthfeel is a little bit sticky with a thick feeling. An excellent RIS that I would highly recommend to anyone.","DanielMB","Aug 23, 2014"

You guys have a RIS? That's cute, but ours is better." The fact of the matter here, for me, is that this might be the most divine RIS I've ever had the pleasure to consume, and without a doubt one of the finest beers I've ever had the privilege to consume. If I could have one materialistic dying wish... Making this year-round would definitely be a consideration.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 19, 2014"

I think I let it warm a little too much - I wish I'd sipped it a little colder and let it warm during my session. The appearance is outstanding and the beer has a nice robust smell. One of these is enough at a time. Very nice for sipping. It would be better by a fire place with snow outside.","fscottkey","Jun 08, 2014"

Smelling it, I get a lot of roasted grains with chocolate, charred wood with a hint of smoke, some coffee, and a slight hop aroma. The taste is much more chocolate-forward. It has a dark chocolate and cocoa powder profile carrying a vein of caramel, with a creamy, full mouthfeel throughout. It finishes with a roasty burnt oat taste with a manageable level of astringency.","itsscience","Apr 22, 2014"

I have a 2012 sitting in the fridge (don't worry it was cellared for a year), and I can't wait to crack it open. In comparison with a 2014 KBS that Core42, a fellow BA, was kind enough to send me free of charge, I find FIS to be slightly, slightly superior. Of course, I don't actually care as much for bourbon stouts. It was still delicious, and if you do like bourbon stouts, then I imagine you'll like it more, but FIS is just that good. A high caliber stout that is a well-accessible. Well done, Founders!","BradenMK","Apr 09, 2014"

The appearance of this stout is simply overwhelming. It pours a very near jet black with just a slight amount if light escaping through around the edges. The head is a large but short lasting beautiful dark brown color (one of the darkest, most handsome heads I have ever seen). It leaves a substantial film and lots of silky lacing. The nose is rather boozy and bitter. Notes of burnt coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and vanilla abound. The mouthfeel is viscous and coats every inch of the palate as it slowly slides down the throat. The flavor is over the top rich and decadent. A very bitter blend of vanilla, chocolate, and a lasting finish of dark roasted coffee. It is a very bold beer. At only a few months old, this stout is near obscenely in your face but I'm quite sure it will smooth with age. Good thing I've got three more in the cellar.","lochef81","Apr 08, 2014"

Trying to pair with salt or sweet diminished the experience and created an over bitter taste. Drinking without food was fairly erotic and very satisfying. Wish my wife would try it with me but to dark for her. I really like this and enjoyed thoroughly on a cold winters night. The buzz is noteworthy as well if you stick to less than 3 pints. I will look for this again next fall/winter/spring.","Realbeer1542","Mar 23, 2014"

4.67,7.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Love this beer. Giving it a proper review (as I have recently started to spend more time mulling over and considering the finer points of all of these wonderful brews). Poured from 12 ounce bottle into my snifter. Midnight black with a tiny cocoa-tinged head that was literally gone in seconds. The aromas were v. pleasant (even when the beer was v. cold); coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, and the slightest whiff of tobacco. The taste was perfect... molasses, dark fruit (fig?), some alcohol, and a crisp, clean bitterness. Slight coffee aftertaste. Genius in a bottle. Of course, a very viscous, heavy mouthfeel... so deep and satisfying. The key to the FIS is its big flavors, but the secret (and reason it is/will be one of my favorites) is the balance. Brilliant.","Mikus","Mar 22, 2014"

Rich dark chocolate and earthy, grainy, roasted malt aromas with a touch of dark fruit, wet tobacco, bitter coffee and boozy overtones. Full bodied with slick, oily feel up front and tangy hop bite toward the end. Dark chocolate and roasted malt flavors up front followed by slowly emerging pine and citrus hop bitterness through the middle. A brief note of sweet dark fruit and bittersweet chocolate followed once again  by intensifying hop bitterness. Finished with a lingering charred malt and pine hop bitterness.

Beautiful mocha colored 1/2inch thick head that did quickly retreat with some lacing. The aroma was quite alluring with hints of chocolate, toffee, maybe roast, and some hints of vanilla. Taste was to die for; coffee, fudge, bittersweet chocolate, and fruits. Thick and smooth with a velvet creamy mouthfeel on the palate. Founders, again, has impressed me with one of their brews. Truly one of the best imperial stouts out there; in my opinion. Highly recommend this one!","dpgoblejr","Beers"

A great beer that would be at the top of the heap if it were just slightly less roasty.","Qbdoo","Feb 20, 2014"

4.52,3.7,5,4.25,4.5,5,4.5,"BOD 12/8/13. Dark as a starless night pour with a big milk chocolate head. Magnificent lacing that lasts. Slightly sweet nose of dark chocolate with hints of plum, smoke and molasses over a rich roast background. Full bodied with a slick creamy texture - perfect. The flavor profile is complex and well balanced. It begins with a creamy slightly sweet dark chocolate, follows with notes of plum and molasses, progresses to a sweeter milk chocolate coupled with a touch of smoke and finishes with a nice burst of roast. The finish is smooth and ends with a light alcohol burn and taste. If the alcohol was better covered, this stout would be perfect.","tillmac62","Feb 19, 2014"
4.77,9.4,4,4.5,5,5,4.75,"Dark brown stout with a flat tan head. Has a malty aroma and a nice roasted malty flavor with some dark chocolate and bitterness thrown in.

It's a take that doesn't rely on any crazy components like additives or barrel-aging, but instead is just a perfect example on how the art of brewing can create a wonderfully delicious beverage. It was good by itself, but could be easily paired with food. Sweet and big enough to be a "dessert beer", but with enough balance to drink just anytime. Right about now I'm wishing I had picked up more than a 4-pack.","LambicPentameter","Feb 17, 2014"

My senses' consensus is that, yes: this is a great, great stout, worthy of enjoying along with any of the big boys out there. It's not a coffee stout, and it's not excessively chocolate-focused; it's just a solid, basic, but exceptionally well-crafted imperial stout. No more, but certainly not less.","Roguer","Feb 16, 2014"

It was strong, hoppy, and close to overpowering, but didn't have the back end complexity of a truly great stout. I have a couple bottles in the cellar, and hopefully they get wiser with age.

This is in the same class as Tenfidy, except tenfidy outclasses this with a bit more complexity and more bold and robust chocolate and dark fruits. This one kind of fell short of the mark to today's my-standards. Perhaps using the word, "imperial," these days, I tend to expect a lot. It's just a stout. It's really just your standard stout, you get dark chocolate, coffee, and a bit of dark fruits on the taste, and just dark chocolate and coffee on the exhale. Nothing more, nothing less. It is not world-class worthy. Maybe they fucked around with the original recipe for this beer, because it definitely is not worth remembering anymore. 8/10.","bball208","Jan 21, 2014"

4.39,0.7,4.5,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Founders Imperial Stout is a Russian Imperial Stout with a great big 10.5% ABV~ Probably pours as dark as I have ever seen, just flat black.. period~ Head was as present as could be on an Imperial Stout, bubbly and lasted about 5 minutes with lacing that went for eternity~ Feel was right on par for such a HUGE stout, big, thick, meaty, yet silky and creamy enough to satisfy all the way around~ Aroma is Campfire, Roasted Malts, Figs, Oats, Dark Fruit, Vanilla, Bready Malt, Sweet Molasses, Plum and Cherry~ Taste was just lovely... Dark Chocolate, Licorice, Cinnamon, Espresso, Banana, Milkshake, Carmel, Sea Salt, Butterscotch and smokey toness shine through~ Sure it has some sting and bitterness at 10.5~ It also has great balance, smoothness and complexity, it's not for beginners as she is a bruiser and a half, a stout that will land you in a comma~ Founders balances it out enough to make this a treat worth sipping, granted it would be tough to drink more than a few, this would make be the perfect drink for snow day as they don't come much heartier~ Overall: 93","BrewUSA","Jan 19, 2014"

Pours black as oil from the bottle into my Founders Snifter. Excellent dark blackish brown head the subsides ever so slowly. Coffee, raisin, roasty, caramel notes dominate the nose. The first sip tells me I'm in for a treat. There's a lot of stuff going on here. This beer is incredible. Fantastic finish, with an incredible chewy mouth feel. I can't wait to see how this beer tastes with some age on it.","BreakfastStout","Dec 31, 2013"

4.64,6.4,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Gorgeous beer. Seriously. Wow. Deep brown, luscious head. Dark, robust aromas of black strap molasses, the darkest and richest chocolate you can imagine, and freshly roasted malt that you scoop up with your hands and shove into your nose. So mellowed out with flavor that's just off the charts. Unbelievable, really. Insane amounts of roasted and charred malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar. And a delicious and welcome complement of warming booze. Incredible body with perfect carbonation. Drinkability is absurd! I could drink this all night (and regret it the next morning). Had to bump it up from a straight 4.5! This was incredible fresh but with some age on it, this beer just shines. Simple as that.","Gatch","Dec 30, 2013"

Not very sweet smelling, mostly bitterness. Flavor is much better with a nice balance between confectioners semisweet dark chocolate and espresso beans, coffee bitterness on a roasted malt background. Thick body with carbonation a little greater than I want fore the style. I like the degree of earthiness and bitterness. Some of these has too much vanilla sweetness.","kylehay2004","Dec 24, 2013"

Crazy aroma of oak, bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, and almost overpowering spicy white alcohol. For 90 IBUs and 10%, the taste is incredibly smooth with some oak, espresso, roasted malt, and vanilla moving to piney hops with warming alcohol like whiskey. Velvety mouthfeel. Full-bodied. Crazy and insane. A lot better than KBS dumping the green coffee and tomato-ey bourbon stickiness.","tarheels86","Sep 23, 2013"

It's like espresso froth. Smell is mocha, nibs of dark chocolate with hints of coffee and orange. Taste is sweet toasty malt, balanced by dark cacao bitterness.

Taste is of dark roasted chocolate malt, dark fruit, cacao, mild liquorices and bitter hops. A full bodied smooth rich and creamy mouth feel. Finishes with a combination of rich dark chocolate malt, dark fruity flavors of plums, ending is sweet bitter chocolate flavor. Overall an excellent, tasty, and flavorful Imperial Stout, Very nice indeed.","Samp01","Jul 09, 2013"

The midnight color and tan fizzy head personify this classic style. Carbonation is nice and dances everytime I swirl the glass. Smell is somewhat muted. Dark and roasty malts, but nothing really pops out. The taste is what sets this beer apart. There is a lightly roasted mocha caramel blend that would be an awesome Starbucks flavor if it could be implemented. The roast is subtle, not overcome by coffee like our KBS cousin. The acidity is lax as well which exemplifies the creaminess of its texture. I'm drinking this on a highly humid night where it's more that 75 degrees outside and enjoying the heck out of this beer. Stouts aren't just for warming you up, especially if they are as well crafted as this one.","PlinyBeMiney","May 20, 2013"

4.51,3.4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"truly exceptional stout right here. I love the fact that it isn't sweet at all, and it doesn't try to hide what it is. very straightforward stuff. the pours is almost jet black, just the darkest shade of brown in there, with a patient but excited mocha colored head that swirls right back up as soon as it settles. the nose is very alcoholic, but its not aggressive or cheap vodka style, its there as a reminder, or maybe a warning. I pick up some good wood in this too, maybe birch or maple, something lighter than oak for sure, more fresh. there is a cocoa bitterness throughout the flavor, that climaxes toward the finish. lots of dark dark roasted barley here, and a certain earthen quality that fills in for the usual residual sugar. it makes the beer more drinkable than it should be. I love the mouthfeel, soft as crushed velvet, but with enough carbonation for its huge body not to get filling. it also finishes fairly clean for a style that usually clings to the teeth for ages. alcohol is warming but not offensive, and the absence of sweetness is astounding and really quite unique in the big stout world. I can finally see for myself what all they hype is about, and this is a beer for the ages. hard to imagine kbs and cbs being even better, but I will find that out for myself as well...","StonedTrippin","May 09, 2013"

The flavor is fantastic has great taste up front with a little bite that I enjoy. It isn't as coffee flavored as alot of other stouts I have had. The finish is quite good however about 20 seconds after you take a drink it does leave a slightly bitter taste far back in the throat.

Little wonder that they are one of my favorite breweries. Like all beers I love this balances rich maltiness with a strong bitterness. In this case the bitterness comes from the charred/ roasted malt rather than the hops. The chocolate and coffee are thick and rich. Probably the best Imp.

Where this stout has less flavors, perhaps than the previous two, it makes up for it with the astounding mouthfeel and malt bill.

The noses is all dark fruits and alcohol; raison's first, blending into cinnamon and vanilla, the alcohol is faint but warning, burnt toast around the edges. The flavor picks up all the best of heavy dark roast, creamy bready malts; blackened barely (x3), bitter wheat, bouyant cinnamon. The double headed griffen is a rightous crest as this is thick, powerful and unforgetable.","templar316","Mar 19, 2013"

To me this embodies the style and would be my benchmark for future examples of the style. This is just so smooth and well crafted, does not have a weak spot. Only smell got knocked from 5 for a slight sharpness due to the alcohol aroma and mouthfeel as well due to it being a little overly thick. I think with some age these attributes would each score a 5 for me if it becomes a tad less hot and the body thins slightly.","MaineBrewing","Feb 19, 2013"

Now I'm drinking this one with about a year and 2 months age on it and it is a work of art. The anise has mellowed, the chocolate, and layers of cocoa, coffee, vanilla, come out in full force. The layers of flavor and depth to this is amazing. I'm going to continue to buy these in waves and throw them in the cellar. Simply amazing brew.","andrewjraab","Beers"

This type around, the Founder Imperial poured much darker and thicker than I remember the first time. Plus the head was a dirty cooper by wonderful head. Five minutes into my glass and there is still some signs of the head. Putting my nose into the tall glass to me is just about the same as putting your nose into a coffee grinder, but a beautiful coffee!. Loving it. The higher alcohol or perhaps the higher IBUs in this one made it quicker to drink. The coffee overtones stayed right with me until the end. Even 10" away from my glass, all I call smell and think right now is COFFEE, COFFEE, COFFEE...

Pours an utterly impenetrable inky black, the pours barely rising above a whisper as it motor oil-like stream penetrates its small, creamy wisp of dark brown foam. Aromas are immediately reminiscent of the times that I've entered the doors of an artisanal chocolatier. If that chocolatier had coffee breath and was charring marshmallows over a fire, this is what his shop would smell like. The taste is as rich as it gets, with lots of very dark chocolate on the front palate, followed by mocha then espresso on the mid palate as the sweetness dims, and finishes with a taste of burnt chocolate and day-old coffee grounds that lingers long. Super high viscosity meets uber-silky feel. An amazing sipping experience.","droomyster","Jan 29, 2013"

The aroma is a bit weaker - heavier on the roast with some dark fruit flavor and a bit of unfortunate rubbing alcohol. Great creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is present but mostly warming and pleasant (just a bit of harshness). Appearance is pretty much black wall to wall with a small brown head.

The depth of its flavor lies in the smoke and char that the malt body attempts to balance out with some moderately sweet, chocolatey richness. While it does smooth out a bit as it warms, it remains a big, challenging bastard for the duration of the experience. Pretty much typifies the style, if you ask me, and hits it out of the park.","fmccormi","Jan 21, 2013"

The beers body is blacker than night allowing no light to pass through it, and only allowing one to gaze into it and ponder what horrifying eldritch terrors must lie in wait within the glass. The beer’s lacing is long and curtain-like, though medium in thickness upon the glass. On the nose, the beer smells big and powerful, shoving sweet roasted malts into your face alongside bitter black coffee, a touch of dark chocolate, and oh-so-slight black licorice and sweet alcohol. On the tongue, the beer tastes big, roasted, chary, and bitter. The beer begins with intense sweet roast before opening into huge bitter black coffee flavors with only a faint touch of black chocolate and char. The finish is big with black coffee and alcohol and big char which lasts in the mouth like you bit into an ashy coal. On the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy, oozing across the tongue like smooth velvet while its flavors brutally assault the palate. The mouth is left dry and charred, though a little saliva scrims the tongue. Overall, this beer is intense. Big and intense. It has some wonderful flavors, but they are all a little too amped up for my palate. I think this beer will do beautifully with a little bit of cellaring, but for now it just is too much to enjoyably drink. It’s a good experience, but it needs to tone itself back.","Maxwell","Beers"

It's just I have had imperial stouts that were way better balanced than this one. But aside from that it wasn't a bad beer. Leaves a fantastic lacing on the glass.

It's been a favorite of mine on cold winter nights for a few years now and is in my top 3-4 of the RIS style. Founders Imperial Stout is a massively thick monster of a stout. Black as hell, rich, and as thick as anything you'll ever come across. It holds it's own in the founders stout family and is truly a beer worthy of anyone's glass. This black liquid, scratch that.. It's thicker than liquid, more oil based.. Anyway, this ridiculously thick black fluid is down right scary good from its rich black color to its overwhelmingly delicious taste is one of the best imperial stouts any person could ever get their hands on and will be brought into my home years and years to come. Another big stout treat from one of my favorites. Founders.. Enough said.","BradtheGreat7","Jan 17, 2013"

An aggressive pour yielded a beautiful , albeit small, caramel colored head that sat atop an absolutely pitch black body. The tiny head quickly faded and there was very little lacing. Huge roasty, cocoa nose with hints of black coffee, mocha, and dark chocolate. The taste is nothing short of heaven. Complex and extremely rich. Huge dark chocolate and cocoa up front with hints of burnt espresso, licorice, booze, and some subtle raisin, fig, and soy sauce on the finish. The mouthfeel is like velvet. Thick, creamy, and smooth as silk with just a touch of oiliness. Scary drinkability for such a big beer. Yes, it's a sipper, but I could probably sip several of these in a sitting. Overall this is probably my favorite non-barrel aged Imperial Stout. Founders can do no wrong!","beerdrifter","Jan 14, 2013"

Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, char, smoke, toast, cocoa, light dark fruit, and earthy hops; a bit of alcohol as it warms up. Nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of huge espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, smoke, toast, cocoa, and earthy hops. Good amount of roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, smoke, toast, and cocoa on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of roasted flavors; with a great hop/roast balance; and some slight cloying bitterness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Russian imperial stout as expected. Great balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted flavors; and very smooth to slowly sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","SeamusDoyle","Jan 13, 2013"

Mouth feel was still silky smooth, and though the carbonation had lost some of its bang, it was still enough to produce that gorgeous, dark tan head.

Pours thick pitch black color with a small dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, char, smoke, toast, cocoa, light dark fruit, and earthy hops; a bit of alcohol as it warms up. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of huge espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, smoke, toast, cocoa, and earthy hops. Good amount of roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, smoke, toast, and cocoa on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of roasted flavors; with a great hop/roast balance; and some slight cloying bitterness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Russian imperial stout as expected. Great balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted flavors; and very smooth to slowly sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

4.59,5.3,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Poured into a Founders snifter. Beautiful dark/mocha head, about a finger deep, some retention/lacing. Head recedes relatively quickly, leaving a very thin ring inside the glass. Completely black in color, looks like an absolutely delicious Imperial Stout. Roasty, malty aromas blend really nicely with coffee and chocolate notes. There is a small hint of heat, too, which at 10.5% is not all that surprising. Hints of molasses as well. Taste is really similar, and improves as beer warms in the glass. Alcohol "taste" is less present here, with roasted malt and coffee coming through most, with black strap molasses. Mouthfeel is great: super smooth and drinkable, slight carbonation and bitterness on the end. Overall this is an amazing beer, not sure whether it's better fresh or what, but this one is about a year old and is drinking really really well right now. It's my last one, so hopefully I can replenish with a case when it's brewed again (hoping January?). Founders Imperial Stout is really balanced. It's a must-try. Cheers.","rodlavers","Nov 29, 2012"

Smell is nothing too spectacular, you have your roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, and a hint of coffee. Taste is heavy on the roast, with notes of bitter chocolate, fig, hops on the back end, and a smoky tobacco hint to finish. For me, the mouth feel is what brings this thing together. It has the most luscious body I've ever had in a beer, so thick and silky. It's basically perfect for the style. Another winner for Founder's.","BrewtifulMind","Oct 06, 2012"

The smell is sweet and malty but not just in your face like you might think with a beer this strong. Mouthfeel is robust and almost syrupy. The taste is complex as well; a sweet malty caramel taste giving way to a dark chocolate, coffee , hops (and some alcohol)taste for the finish. Overall I will have to say it was not my favorite beer ever, but I have tried to evaluate in terms of quality and what this beer should be according to type. Since I have never had anything bad from Founders, I declare this one another winner.","Mojo","Aug 15, 2012"

The taste is over-the-top roasty at first, with some dark fruits. There's also a decently large dose of earthy hops at the end. The late finish yields a great coffee flavor. The mouthfeel is slick, with a slightly lighter body than expected. Overall, this is a great imperial stout.

The head is chocolate brown and stands very strudy for a minute or so before fading to patchy cover. A few drops of beer actually danced on top of the head until finding a place to sink through. The nose picks up a slightly boozy chocolate licorice with near cotton candy sweetness and slight nuttiness.Very intriguing. The first taste brings a vscous feeling, near minty licorice-chocolate blend of intense flavor. It's satiny smooth with just a freckling of carbonation, but velvetty, luscious stuff. Goes down easy but probably not a session brew for obvious reasons. It's pretty thick stuff, clearly full bodied. Seems like there's some herbal hop going on to really make this an interesting blend of earthy, malty pleasure. This seems pretty much what you should expect in an imperial stout. Finishes a little more boozy than I'd like but otherwise, another Founders success!","Durge","Beers"

4.41,1.1,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a snifter, the beer is jet black, with a great looking consistency, and a thick, foamy, dense, creamy, milk chocolate colored head. Aromas are rich and deep, with a good blending of chocolate and coffee, as well as some roasted qualities and a slight boozey kick. Flavors are robust and full, with a heavy roasting, almost to the point of char, carrying a solid dark coffee backbone, with some bitter cocoa nib and sweet molasses and vanilla highlights. Very well blended, and extremely smooth despite the bitter coffee and chocolate notes. The aftertaste is more of the smokey/roasted character, with a touch of the bitter chocolate and coffee once again. This full bodied brew leaves a trail of rings around the glass, and is insanely smooth leading to a velvety soft, creamy finish, with a touch of drying bitter left behind for just a moment.

I usually can't detect hops in stouts, but this is a different animal. The taste, for being without any of the aforementioned flavors, is still quite solid. There's a touch of smokiness to this, but this is otherwise a very bold, unapologetic, straight forward stout, and it's excellent at being that. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, albeit dry. It leaves a decent amount of bitterness behind, courtesy of the hops. Overall, this is a very nice beer indeed. I can see why it's so well received.","Retail1LO","Jan 21, 2012"

4.52,3.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Aight yo. I have no special interest in tracking down uber-rare CBS/KBS'es, so this is the Founders Imperial Stout that I'm going to stick with. Poured into the finest diamond imbued goblet of Silenus. JKJK typical beer stein. Pours black as a black cat on a cloudy night without a moon. Where there's no stars or anything. Really quite black. That's what I'm getting at here. Maybe a hint o f brown? Smells like coffee. I can already tell that I'm in for a treat. Hop bombs are nice, but malt bombs are somethin' else. Speaking of, this label reads '90 IBUs'. I haven't a clue where this number comes from, but certainly not the taste of this beer or its smell. The taste follows the nose - oatmeal, coffee, a little booziness, just enough hops to keep things in check. The mouthfeel makes this beer to me, it washes down like cream. Like it enters your body on a carpet of clouds and leaves behind Care Bears. This shit is dangerous, it weighs in at 10.5% ABV but feels like it should be maybe 7-8%.

Sniffed out some bitter acidic hops and burnt espresso in front of a faint berry smell. The taste confirms that super dark coffee smell and comes at me even more with bittersweet chocolate. My mouth is dry after every sip. I prefer low levels of carbonation so this is nice for me. Overall this beer met my expectations pretty evenly.

3.3,-24.3,4,4,3,4,2.5,"Pours a ink black, with only a sliver of a chocolate head evident. Minimal lacing on my CBS snifter. Truly one of the darkest looking beers I've seen. The nose is mainly coffee, bitter chocolate, malt, and that's really about it. Not quite as good as Breakfast Stout's nose. The taste is... interesting. Not sure whether I love it or hate it. There are a bunch of malts, anise, burned biscuit, coffee, and some hops. After half a bottle... I don't think I'm a fan. The taste just doesn't taste.... well... good. None of the 10.5% ABV is evident. Feel is smooth, creamy, and goes down like butter. The feel is definitely the best part of this brew for me. Overall, I have to say- I'm not a fan of the taste of this beer. I probably will gift the other three bottles away to friends. This is like a Breakfast Stout gone awry... and I love just about everything Founders does. I won't buy this again though. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Jan 06, 2012"

As far as imperial stouts go without any added hoopla, this is a solid example of the style. If you get a shot at this, don’t pass it up. Eternal thanks to Kkottonmouthkngz for my shot.

Malt, graham cracker, vanilla, and a bit of alcohol round out this beast of a nose. Taste wasn't as good as the nose, but still very good. Very malty, lots of coffee. Slight bit of chocolate and vanilla. Maybe just a tinge of sweetness to it. No hint of the ABV. Mouthfeel is creamy and gets creamier as it warms. I'd say it is between medium and full bodied, closer to the full end of it. Overall, this is very good. Very easy to drink for a high ABV stout. Highly recommended for a stout lover.","1Adam12","Aug 17, 2011"

Then I didn't get all that much from the taste either. So I let it warm further and finally got the characteristics to shine through. So you know, you might want to let this one warm a little more than usual. Anyways, a very nice example of an RIS. This isn't my favorite of the style, but still one I'm quite glad to have tried.

4,-8.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Imperial Stout pours out a dark black off the pour - no light is getting through this beer. A chocolate colored head develops and sits on top like a cap until it eventually fades out into some lacing. A mixture of bitter chocolate and roasted coffee greet you on the aroma with some sweetness on the finish. Alcohol takes the front seat on the first few sips, but fades out and allows the beer’s complex flavors to shine through. Hops hit up front, but are balanced nicely with roasted malts that are truly the backbone holding each flavor together. Chocolate and coffee notes are present, but not overwhelming.

I can't believe it lasted this long in the growler (4 months). It's really really tasty. Overall this is one of the better imperial stouts that I have had the good fortune to have.

A quarter inch of light brown foam covers the beer and then recedes leaving an appealing ring around the outside of the glass. The beer is incredibly thick. It has legs more than lacing. The nose is sweet roasted malt and dark fruit. Taste follows the nose with flavors of char, raisins and figs. Bitter hops in the finish catch me off guard. This is a very complex brew. Feel is thick and chewy with enough CO2 to keep things interesting. Overall this is a very nice Impy Stout. ABV is hardly noticable and the thick, rich texture make this a joy to imbibe.

4.3,-1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Founders Imperial Stout pours, as one might expect, ink black. The foam cap is almost intimidating in how dark a caramel color it is. The head rises to about three fingers in height and manages to stick around for a decent chunk of time. There's a great ring of lacing right at the beer's high water mark, but below that it's just a little spotty. The nose is heavy on fudgy dark chocolate, with notes of molasses and anise present as well to add some balance. Unfortunately that molasses is lost in the transition to taste, because all I find here are that same great rich dark chocolate flavor dominating, with some licorice notes present as well. I'd have liked to see a little bit more besides anise (one of my less favorite stout flavors) acting as a counterpoint to the rich malt base. The body is wonderful though, very rich and full, and it accents the fudgy flavors well to further the impression of a decadent dessert beer. The carbonation is just a hair too dull to finish things off though, it doesn't quite make an impression through all the sweetness. Founders Imperial Stout is a great beer, maybe second only to Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout in terms of readily available RIS's","axeman9182","Apr 29, 2011"

Taste is very rich with strong brewed coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and slight licorice. Slight coffee bitterness after each sip. There is a tiny bit of alcohol burn in the throat.

This brew has a very strong chocolate aroma along with some coffee, dark fruits and sweet malts. The first thing I taste is some coffee followed by some dark fruits (raisins, and plums come to mind), and the taste finishes off with some bitter chocolate. The dark fruits add some sweetness that balances well with the chocolate. I can taste a little bit of alcohol near the end, but not real strong for a beer having 10.5% ABV. The mouthfeel is a nice creamy, but sticky brew that is lip smacking good. I enjoyed this one and will drink it again. This in my opinion is not as good as Old Rasputin or Thirsty Dog's Siberian Nights, but still worth getting.","DannyDan","Apr 07, 2011"

Nose is smooth, very appealing with lots of dark roasted coffee and cocoa notes, also a good amount of hops come through, as listed on the bottle at 90 IBUs. Taste is also smooth and complex; hits all the right flavour notes with burnt malts and an ever so slightly hop presence. A bit of heat felt in the finish is welcoming for the next sip on this cool afternoon. Heavily bodied and a creamy, lucious mouthfeel. A sipper of a RIS, meant to enjoy, no less because of only one 4-pack acquired on a rare trip into Michigan.

Medium-to-full bodied, nice middle ground between syrupy and creamy. Nice RIS with alcohol pretty well hidden and the considerable sweetness is kinda balanced by the hop flavors.

The same qualities are there- roasted malts, molasses, dark chocolate, coffee, earthy notes along with some figs, smoked wood, burnt toast, nuts, hops, and plums.

Nice hop/coffee bitterness upfront with sticky sweet dark chocolate with an almost cloying sugar sweetness. I love by bitter IPA's but when it comes to stouts this is what I like to see.

Same result with the taste. The first 20 minutes the taste was just OK. Not until it warmed up did it have the very bitter chocolate taste with a coffee backbone that I look for in a RIS. The mouthful was great, carbonation was noticeable, but I didn't pick up on any notes of alcohol once it warmed up. Overall an another exceptional beer from Founder's.

In the mouth it's a huge, thick body, tons of bittersweet chocolate, some hop and chocolate bitterness at the back of the tongue, some prickly carbonation that lingers forever and ever, amen. It starts out quite sweet but finishes nice and bitter, maybe just a touch of pleasant heat, totally fantastic. It's thick and huge, more of an end-of-session or with-dinner beer for me, but plenty good. One of my favorites, rivaling FBS in my book. I'd love to do a side by side.","EricCioe","Feb 27, 2011"

I could honestly live without the licorice, but, I'm sure it's there for some reason. Not much in the chocolate, but, not overwhelming in the coffee either. However, there is a lot of flavor!

That's really all I get out of it other than some roasted malt. Even though there isn't a lot going on in the smell what is there smells very nice. Like the smell the taste is very chocolatey. Kind of surprising since when I had it fresh it wasn't like this and there was some coffee in both the smell and taste. The mouthfeel is very thick and perfect for the RIS style. No alcohol present which is very nice making this very drinkable with the chocolate taste that is coming out. Overall fresh this one is great but with some time this one gets even better.

On the initial swallow the beer coats the tongue nicely, numbs it a little. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The coffee flavor comes out nicely and covers the alcohol very well.

Head slowly fades down to an even film of tiny bubbles, and lacing consists of very slow moving foam that wants to rejoin the liquid but hardly has the strength to fall. Aroma is hearty dark malts, coupled with vinous dark fruits and alcohol. Taste is extremely rich dark chocolate and coffee flavors upfront, with the fruit and alcohol coming in on the middle, and closing with an increasingly bitter coffee flavor, and definite warmth. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, although a bit more carbonation wouldn't hurt in my eyes, and drinkability is high in that you want to come back for more, even if the abv means that you come back for more tomorrow.","Anthony1","Aug 18, 2010"

Fine speckled lacing dances around the sides of my Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Aroma has earthy herbal hops big loads of dark chocolate notes, something soy sauce about this batch that works into an imperial stout profile, dark fruit hints of anise black licorice. Flavor is full of dark fruit big blast of coffee dark espresso grade strength, creamy dark chocolate bitterness just an aboslute excellent interpretation of an imperial sout. Full bodied stout that coats the palate from every angle the most filling beer around, even smooth carbonation not a cloying bone in this beers body.

The pour results in a black soup usually reserved for coating pelicans and other wildlife during ecological disasters, topped by about a finger of burnt sienna froth. I miss crayons... The nose comprises roasted and toasted malts, molasses, chocolate, maple syrup, and a nice hint of vanilla. Yum so far. The taste holds notes of dark, smokey, roasted malts; dark chocolate; a tiny bit o' vanilla; and a slightly surprising hint of bourbon. The body is Kingpin heavy and coats the mouth with thick, chewy goodness. As much as I want to guzzle this beast, the thickness, richness, and relatively high ABV make this an impossible dream (though, like Quixote, that hasn't stopped me yet).

Huge rich flavors rush in from every angle. The is silky smooth and slighty slick body with gentle carbonation usher in tons of chocolate covered espresso beans in the flavor. There's also a soft warming from the alcohol and a subtle fruitiness that round out the complex combination of flavors. The finish is a lasting bitterness much like a piece of ultra-dark chocolate. At 90 IBUs, I thought there might be a bit more hop character, but the bitterness is manifested in the roasty espresso and dark chocolate notes. This beer is incredibly delicious and every sip shows me something new with this one. Really quite outstanding. Bravo!","cdpike","Feb 12, 2010"

Alcohol is there as well. The taste is not a letdown. Tastes just as good as it smells, maybe ever better. Tastes of roasted malts and espresso. Black coffee. Caramel and some kind of sugary sweetness. Vanilla extract maybe? The flavor really starts to come out as the beer warms. Slight hops at the end give the beer a nice balance.

4.66,6.9,5,4,5,5,4.5,"One of the strangest pours I have ever seen! Poured out like a carton of motor oil and it appeared as if there was no hope for the formation of a head. After a very aggressive pour of the whole bottle into my snifter the head came out of nowhere and formed to the size of about one finger. The rising head from inside the opaque beer looked magical after such a strange pour. The head retains pretty well at about half to one finger and is a beautiful, VERY dark almost coffee bean color. A blanket of this head stays afloat on the beer for the reminder of the time. The lacing makes a cream around the glass as the head dies down. The nose on this one is good but very aggressive. I can smell alcohol vapors right of the top of the beer. The main components are, as expected, roasted malts, cocoa and some coffee notes. These are most likely from the malts. I can not pick up any hops in the aroma. The nose is of good strength and represents an Imperial Stout well. Finally to the taste. This beer is huge! Roasted malts and cocoa notes demolish my taste buds and are backed by earthy RIS-like hops very well. The hops help to balance the flavor but do not take over the malts, something I like in an RIS. The coffee is faint but I get hints of it (maybe just from similar roasty flavors). Alcohol is not as present in the flavor as I expected it to be from the aroma. The more I drink this beer, a bunch of times now, it really has one of the best non-specialty RIS flavors. The mouthfeel is amazing. This is the thickest beer I have ever had and it feels so good. It is almost milkshake thick with low RIS-like carbonation. The tongue is left with a blast of roast and earthy hop flavors, very nice. A tiny bit of warming leaves my mouth in heaven. Drinkability is great because of the taste and price for such a big beer. The downside is that this is definitely not sessionable, I would like to enjoy this one bottle at a time and hopefully on tap sometime. Great example of an RIS and one of my new favorites by Founders.","cbutova","Jan 14, 2010"

A bit of vanilla in the aftertaste. Alcohol is there but doesn't get in the way at all. Mouthfeel is great, definitely a stout you can "chew" which I love.

Raisin and candied fig show up as the beer warms, and I can still taste the coffee and cocoa minutes after each sip. Medium-thick, luxurious mouthfeel with a sticky, boozy finish...could stand to be a bit creamier, but that's a minor knock. Besides, the lowered viscosity provides a boost in the drinkability.

4.1,-6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Judging by the notch, this was bottled on June 2008. Decanted into a pint glass. Completely opaque black with a thin tan head. Okay on the retention. Aromas are pretty light: the expected bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee. Maybe some raisins and charred wood. Tastes of the dark chocolate and coffee. Decidedly burnt finish, although it's not bad - the bitterness off-sets the dark sweetness. Decent amount of carbonation - actually a little lighter-bodied that most other imperial stouts, but all of this makes it a very drinkable stout. The higher ABV is hidden, so take care, but otherwise this is a great example of a standard imperial stout. Nothing crazy like barrel-aging or whatnot, but if you're the mood for a good stout, this is a sure bet.","ndekke39","Apr 15, 2009"

Full-bodied, Very chewy yet with a subtle carbonation which prods the whole forward when it starts to get lazy. Pure coffee, dark chocolate, toffee flavors, spoonful of freshly whipped cream on top. Gentle roast, never that aggressive of a toastiness, much in keeping with a bigger isn't always better approach. Pine and anise seed brighten the mid-palate and add lift. Dense soda bread doughiness.

Large dense deep brown head, it almost looks like it has reddish tints as well. Great retention and clumpy streaks of lacing all over the glass. Very strong, potent aroma, that leans a little heavily on a hop like bitterness, slightly astringent, almost like a house hold cleaner. Behind that, some malt and coffee like presence and dark fruit sweetness, but the astringency is a turn off. Body is very thick and creamy, but very low carbonation reminding me of Expedition (looking at other reviews, starting to wonder if I have an off bottle). Primary flavor starts with dark fruit, berries, etc transitioning to a light coffee/chocolate flavor before a dry light hop finish. Very little alcohol presence. A nice RIS, and great representation of the style, but nothing remarkable and in my opinion I prefer something cheaper like Old Rasputin or Storm King.","yourefragile","Feb 17, 2009"

There isn't an abundance of smells. I get the feeling of carbonation in the nose, a smell of alcohol, with a faint whiff of roasted malts in the background. The taste hit me immediately as a bittersweet chocolate, then the alcohol took over. This one finishes kind of dry, with that taste of black patent erasing everything else behind. The only complaint is that it lacks complexity. I mean, there's plenty of flavor there, but I can't dig deep and search without finding the same stuff. The mouthfeel is oddly a bit thin, which may be a product of the dryness. It allows the alcohol to just pund your tongue - which brings me to drinkability. The attack on my tongue of the alcohol slowed me down quickly, and the feeling in my nose from the alcohol and sort of empty carbonation worked to do the same, but I still found this to be pleasant.","taylorhamrick","Feb 13, 2009"

Instead, it just produced the forest fire, or perhaps a severe house fire, or maybe just the sort of thing that strikes a lightning rod, and, well, nevermind. The long and short of it is, regardless of my expectations, this is still a really solid beer, more towards the chocolate and anise end of the RIS spectrum, sweet and spicy, though definitely complex across the board.

Poured the color of engine oil with a tight, half inch, mocha-colored cap embedded with bubbles. Head eventually dissipated into a band that coalesced around the bowl and some swirls of foam; some spots of lacing present adhered during the tasting. Nose was cocoa, coffee and dark fruit. Taste consistent with nose; however, dark fruit disappears and a slightly boozy quality comes out manifested as a lingering bitter astringency at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and oily with a little bit of carbonation prickliness.

Huge malt presence (I hear they used 10 kinds of malts). Lots of chocolate, brown sugar, and nice burnt notes. Mouthfeel was on the thin side as far as imperial stouts go, but still sported a thicker medium body. Carbonation was just fine.

This one sure has that "Founders" taste to it, but that's a good thing. Blaack coffee with a hint of cane sugar. Not as sweet as the nose, but there is some cherry notes on the tongue. Smokey wood flavors with a bit of an earthy hop bite to it. Aftertaste is dry with hints of vanilla and cocoa. Thick, creamy, and smooth mouthfeel with a subtle but fitting carbonation. Perect texture for the style. I let this one warm up pretty good before tasting and I'm glad I did. What an amazing RIS, one of the best for sure.

After rich coffee flavors up front, you notice the soft, mellow mouthfeel, followed by a bittersweet finish that leaves a pleasant tang in your mouth. A little alcohol burn afterward, but apparently unlike most raters, I don't think that's a bad thing at all. One of my top three imperial stouts.","Flyer","Apr 26, 2007"

Very sweet, and damn near perfect smell on this, fine job, very rich and desert like. The taste was strong, and definatly packed a punch. Very sweet, with the biggest flavor here being roasted coffee and chocolate. Definate alcohol presence here whci at 10% is not shock. Again the feel was very thick, but the lack of carbonation hurt it, as it did not feel as creamy as it could have been. This left the mouthfeel a bit dull and flat. The finish was nice, dry and somewhat hoppy. This one needs more carbonation. The flatness in the mouthfeel takes away from the great aromas and flavors it possess.

Slightly roasty finish, more bitterness as well, not as good as the smell. Lighter side of medium carbonation with medium body. This was pretty good, but perhaps more age would benefit it yet.

Smell is wonderfully complex, slight hints of coffee and citrus, but dominated by a milk chocolatey aura. Taste is initially of roasted malt and citrus notes, with a good amount of hops to balance and an ever so slight aftertaste of alcohol. The mouthfeel is definitely full bodied, with very little carbonation and leaves a coated feel on the mouth. A very drinkable beer, but at 10% watch out!

Good body for the style, not crazy heavy but nice and thick and chewy.

Excellent balance of flavours, with chocolate and light raisin/plum to start, mild bitterness, roast and dark fruit. Just a bit of lactic sourness as well.

Flavor begins with a plethora of sharp anise notes, which leads into a light array of currant and charred fruits. Chocolate covered truffles finish things out, underneath a rich roastyness and an easily perceptible hop flavor and bitterness on the finish.

Aroma is hearty dark malts, coupled with vinous dark fruits and alcohol. Taste is extremely rich dark chocolate and coffee flavors upfront, with the fruit and alcohol coming in on the middle, and closing with an increasingly bitter coffee flavor, and definite warmth.

Smells raisiny, molasses, licorice, and chocolate with a gentle sting of alcohol. Taste starts roast with a barely detectable underlying chocolate. The chocolate then rises and persists well into the aftertaste. is just a hint of cherry sour. As the beer warms, the roast grows stronger, but a caramel toffee rises, and helps with the transition from roast to chocolate. Overall, the beer is sweet, but the chocolate has dried out and the roast after the swallow lays dry on my tongue. A nice contrast with the sweet on my cheecks and back of my tongue.

The head was very scarce and there were a few conglomerates of sticky residue that looked like a fungus. Anyways, the aroma is filled with a pruney, chocolate, raisin kick. The taste is sweet with a semi-thick body. There is a residual sweetness that clings to the tongue a little bit. The beer is well balanced for an imperial stout. There seems to be some characteristics of a baltic porter in this one. Overall, a nice beer from founders, but not one that will blow you out of the water.","ALESwhatCURESya","Jun 02, 2005"

As I finished up my second bottle I was left wondering what was missing from the bottled version. The tap version was great, the bottled version was good but not quite wowing good. Typical inky black body with slight brown head with some staying power. Nice roastiness backed with light dark fruit sweetness and some dark chocolate. Sweet fruit flavors with a big chocolate and roastiness. Some coffee going as well. Sweetness though seems a bit over done here. Light bitter finish. Mouthfeel is just ridiculous, motor oil indeed is not doing it here. The thick creaminess makes this go down quite easy. If the sweetness would be toned down a bit it would have helped. Good brew all around that I look forward to drinking again.","meathookjones","Jun 01, 2005"

As far as looks, this is probably one of the most eye-catching beers I've ever drank...and it had an aroma to match. The scent was a melange of baking chocolate and an almost chocolate liqueur/baking vanilla type scent, like sweetness with a distinctly alcoholic edge. Felt thick in the mouth, almost syrupy, and the taste was exceptional. Lots sweetness in the mouth and then a finish like Irish coffee, bitter with a nice alcohol bite (and considering its 10% ABV, no wonder!). Hanging around in the background was a very nice hoppy character that the bitter finish tempers well so it doesn't become to overwhelming.

The infantile Pinot Noir traits have blossomed into fully-realized Sherry. The malt leans more towards fudge than roast, but both are present in buckets. Hopping has fizzled somewhat but still has pine cones to spare. The bitterness now just offsets the gluttony. Alcohol is perhaps more of a factor than ever, or at least more than I realized. In many ways, this seems to separate with time rather than congeal.","cokes","Apr 03, 2005"

Aroma is residual sugars and alcohol combined with a thick coffee roastedness. Taste is simply too strong on the alcohol though for me to fully appreciate this beer. It's good. Nice thick chocolate malt syrup taste then a slight hoppiness but not quite enough. Alcohol is very apparent and there's a bitter espresso taste in the finish. Finish is acidic and lingers with espresso beans and alcohol. Surely a sipper. Body is very thick. Not a real complex beer but I think time might help both the complexity and alcohol intensity.

The alcohol was imperceptable under the robust flavor. The richness seemed to increase the deeper I plunged into the glass. The chocolate goodness in the last swallow was like the peaking of the experience. I immediately wished I had another bottle to rip into after this one was gone. It was surprisingly delicious.

Opaque tar appearance. Very well balanced chocolate milk and coffee nose is backed up by a hefty dose of vinous fruits. Rich malt profile. Licorice reminiscent flavors emanate as the beer warm together with a mellow alcohol kiss. Apparent oatmeal character, velvety texture with extremely mellow carbonation enhancing the silky creamy feel. Understated foresty hops blend with the heavy roasted malts in elegance and taking good care of avoiding acidity. Stunning take on the style, possibly the best looking impy, superb texture and solid flavor balance makes it a real winner.","Rastacouere","Mar 06, 2005"

Black in color with a thick creamy tan head (after a hard pour). Aroma of malted barley, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, coating and extremely smooth. Things start off with a dark choclate flavor and move to a rich vinous taste in the middle, somewhat reminiscent of raisins. Hops make their presence known just before the finish. Bitterness seems appropriate and builds on the dark roasted barley and vinous flavors. Alchohol is not overpowering at all for a 12% Imperial Stout and the drinkability is remarkable.

Coffee, espresso, chocolate are all here and rolled up into one big stout. The hop bitterness doesnt shy away at all either. It hits you nicely, with a grassy hop flavor that rounds out the profile. The alcohol is there, but well hidden for being a supposed 12%. This stuff is thick and literally coats the mouth. This is how an imperial should be as far as mouthfeel. This one is top notch.

The flavor is somewhat of a letdown unfortunately. The chocolate remains, but seems unsupported by a good roatiness. The flavor is surprisingly mellow and soft given the aroma. It seems a little flat and one-dimensional. The mouthfeel is actually worth mentioning (an aspect I rarely feel worthy of comment in most beers). It's a very airy and creamy feel on the tongue. Quite pleasant and something that makes this beer feel lighter than it otherwise would.
