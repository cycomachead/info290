"Drinkability is solid. Not an overpowering beer at 10%. Would seek out again."
"O - A pleasant beer from Brooklyn. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"2013 vintage release. Kinda light. Delicious"
""
"Very Rich, a bit sweet.  Very good"
""
""
"Good, but gimmicky and way overpriced. Hard to appreciate tastes with agressive carbonation. Innovative and dangerous  as a style for me so worth the $20, once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer. Pours jet black with a thick foamy head which is indicative of its carbonation. Tastes of bourbon with some champagne undertones from the yeast fermentation. Very bubbly on the tongue like a champagne. Great beer for a special occasion."
"O: As a lover of thick, sweet stouts, this was a grand departure. Had reservations about drinking it judging it from previous reviews. The thin mouthfeel dominates the equation for me, but not in the negative way that I was expecting. Have a 2014 vintage in the cellar - looking forward to visiting it in a years time."
""
""
""
"It's a fantastic.beer,  the flavor of tost caramel and vanilla is incredibly.  the chanpanoase process add create a different sensation in your mouth gave more drinkhability"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Very drinkable. It's been several years since I've had this fresh, so I'm not sure how boozy it is, or how much barrel aging is present, but I can say that this particular bottle has pleasant barrel aging qualities, and the booze at 10.7% is extremely well hidden.  It's an easy drinker for sure. I also believe the aging takes a bit away from the lighter, effervescent notes brought on by the champagne yeast.  Roasted malts are not part of this stout. This one is more delicate with no in your face elements."
""
""
"2013 Vintage. Very tasty, but I wouldn't continue to age this one any longer (as very, very, slight soy flavor has crept in), but still drinking wonderfully. Bourbon and chocolate notes throughout. Very smooth."
""
"Had at Pittsburgh Winter BeerFest."
""
"Lots of licorice in taste and aroma. Bourbon flavor is smooth, not overly sweet like some other BBA Stouts. One of the better mouth feels I've had for this style. The champagne yeast is evident and makes this beer stand out."
"Poured a deep black with very light head, and below average head retention. Smelled of strongly of stone fruits with an understone of wine? Taste lacked complexion for me. Drinkable but taste carried the same tangy wine charachteristics while lacking a satisfying level of bourbon. Mouthfeel was suprisingly thin and lingered. Overall a good beer, but not worth seeking out."
""
""
"Bourbon is overpowering. Probably should have aged."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best Bourbon-Barrel Aged stouts you could ask for- the champagne yeast used for the bottle conditioning puts it over the top.  Great beer!"
""
""
"Flavor is sweet, boozy, and licorice, as well. Needs much time to develop."
"Not feeling qualified as reviewer, but for me was hit with too much bourbon. Otherwise very good."
"I always age this one a year. First time I had it fresh the beer was way too hot. Ever since I let it sit for a year and it makes a world of difference. Smooth, light and delicate, almost hard to believe it is a stout. Champagne yeast makes this a really interesting brew. Highly recommend"

"I tried this only once and was a little tipsy, so I'll need to try and review again, but it was definitely an interesting beer.  Much different from other imperial stouts. It had a lot of flavors at once. Wine, bourbon, beer. I remember being a bit let down. The taste was somewhat flat and dry. Probably a little too much for my taste, but definitely fun to try."
""
""
"something about the process brooklyn uses to bottle condition, maybe its the champagne yeast, i dont know, but it seems like very bottle of brooklyn beer i taste has an amazing yeast complexion and mouthfeel to it, this is no different. so much different from the other dark brooklyn brews, chocolate stout, cuvee noir, any of those, but its equally smooth, crushed velvet in the feel, but much more intense on the roast, passing the dried fruit realm right into dark chocolate and espresso, but there is a crazy lightness to this not common or even possible i didnt think in a russian imperial type. definitely something interesting going on with the grain, toast and roast, oats, minor tannins, its cool. carbonation doesnt feel all that high, but the yeast lends a maturity to it, a pillowy thing, not enough yeast in these normally i dont think, so this is pleasant. for such a big and bold beer, i just cant believe how delicate it feels, built masterfully, and again, i would nominate these guys as one of the best breweries in the country, but they never seem to be in that conversation. this is incredible beer, a whole new direction for the style. dying for another..."

"Overall this was a great beer thats been on my want list forever. One of the pioneers of bourbon aged stouts, just wish the bourbon was more apparent. A nice head would have also propelled this beer to top ten status but its still pretty enjoyable."
""
""
"Looks good, smells good, Tastes good initially - smooth, nice barrel notes, but not a fan at all of the champagne yeast"
"This is a serious competitor to BCBS as best bourbon aged stout. Fantastic flavor and very smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A little disappointing. Bourbon overpowers. Most of the other flavors are under-developed. I would take their Black Chocolate Stout over this any day. Curious to see how it ages but my hopes are not high."
""
""
""
"Just bought a bottle at Gordon's in Waltham after their Black Beer Affair. This beer is excellent. Very drinkable. I can definitely taste the barrel aging flavor."
"There are so many barrel aged stouts being offered and I feel like this one falls short.  It's good in It's own right, but can't hang with the big boys."
""
""
""
""
"Was reminded very much of Alesmith speedway stout, but the champagne yeast made this exceptionally dry. I found myself swirling the glass to knock the unwelcome style of carbonation out. After warming up and breathing for a while, I found it very enjoyable. Flavor and aroma very agreeable to me, champagne yeast - not so much. All in all, glad I tried it. Unique and very solid offering from brooklyn brewery."
""
""
""
""
"This was a real disappointment given the huge price tag. Its thin and watery and the bourbon overwhelms the base beer. Will not be trying this one again."
""
""
""
"Mind when summarizing  2013"
"Pitch black, laced toffee foam. Oak, some bourbon, chalky nibs. Decadent and boozy, bittersweet roasty malt finish. Exceptional."
""
""
"Very bourbon forward, would love to taste this in a few years"
""
""
"I had to miss the mark on this one.  I have enjoyed most beers coming from the Brooklyn Brewery and Black Ops was not an exception.  It just that it didnt live up to some of the hype I read about.  I was enjoyable, hard to distinguish between a stout and a Belgium beer."
"first Brooklyn beer for me. Outstanding"
""
"This beer poured a dark inky black with about a finger of foamy khaki head off of an aggressive pour. Solid looking beer in the glass. Nose on this was strange... Super super bourbon forward with very subtle hints of vanilla and oak, maybe a touch of chocolate. The worst part about this nose for me is if you let the beer sit in the glass for a few minutes. The beer actually takes on an aroma of stale bud light left out overnight. But moving on... Mouth feel was average at best. On the thinner side especially for a BBA stout. Taste was bourbon. That's about it. Bourbon. Pretty much covered up any other notes present in this beer. I've got another bottle of this stuff I'll be aging for a couple years but I do not have high hopes. We fan only hope time helps the bourbon mellow to a reasonable level. Really saddened by this one, especially for the price point :("
"OVERALL (2.75) - I have never drain-poured a beer before. I drain-poured this one. I tried letting it warm, but it just didn't get any better. I got halfway through maybe a 6oz portion and I had to pour out the rest of the glass. The rest of the bottle is still sitting in my refrigerator and I'm wishing that I'd never opened it, because it could have used about two or more years of age. It wasn't the worst beer ever, for sure, but I wanted something tasty that night, and this was not it. It could definitely have developed a lot more in the bottle over time, but as my first experience with this stout I can't understand how it's so highly rated. Straight up BCS is way better than this and is more than four times cheaper (per ounce)."
""
""
"Cheers to jonnybeers for sharing this 2011 bottle! Can't believe I haven't tried this! Amazing mouthfeel, medium-full body and smooooth fine carbonation."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I expect from a big stout. This is likely influenced by the strong level of carbonation, which feels a little out of place. Overall very enjoyable, but in some ways it feels that all the pieces don't come together cohesively."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had pretty much everything that i expect from the style with more barrel aspect than I expected and I thought the champagne yeast made it pretty unique for the style.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, slightly warming, crisp, slightly sticky, not to filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, with how smooth it drinks I wouldn't rule out drinking the whole bottle and it's just smoother than I expected.  What I like the most about this beer was how well the champagne yeast worked with it and the balance, to me those were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the price, it's pretty damn expensive.  I might buy this beer again, but because of the price it would be for special occasions only.  I would recommend this if you want a unique barrel aged Imperial Stout.  All in all I was happy with this beer and I was impressed with how well the champagne yeast worked with it, I just enjoyed how unique it was.  So far it's one of the better beers I've had from this brewery and while it's not my favorite of the style it's for sure on the unique side.  Good job guys, this was tasty and unique barrel aged Imperial Stout, keep up the hard work."

"Body of a stout, texture of a wine, taste of bourbon"

"This is a really good beer, different than the standard.  Price ($20) was a little high."

"More vanilla than I remember in previous years."
"2013, opened today, cleaning cellar. Not much of a reviewer but this didn't sit well with me and perhaps one of my least favorite beers I've had lately. Smell seems off, taste was pretty interesting. I didn't finish my glass because I did not care for this at all."
""
""
""
"O: the easiest drinking stout of its kind. That uniqueness alone makes it remarkable. Tons of taste, without being heavy."
"Overall: I can see why this is highly regarded. Garrett Oliver is the true definition of a brewmaster. The addition of champagne yeast makes this beer stand out from the rest of the stouts on the market. Definitely a unique brew. I'll probably pass on this in the future because there are other BA stouts that will allow me to get 4 bottles for the same price of this one. However, I will enjoy the rest of this 750 and savor every last drop."

"Walked into my local bottle shop last night and found this sitting on the shelf.  2014 edition.  I have never had the opportunity to purchase this and decided to give it a go. A/Poured very black.  It is what I was expecting from this RIS.  S/Bourbon followed by roasted malts, followed by hints of chocolate, and smokiness.  T/Bourbon upfront followed by smokiness, hint of chocolate with a creamy finish. O/This beer was a little light with more carbonation than what I expected of this RIS.  It is bad? No it was a very enjoyable deviation than what I am used to or expecting.  While every sip was consistent it was enjoyable and got even better as it warmed.  I found the best range was probably about 10 degrees cooler than room temp. I would seek this out again if it wasn't for the $20 price.  That is the only factor holding me back from purchasing this again.  I think if you have the chance spring for it at least once."

"O: very well crafted and balanced."

"If it weren't for the price I would make more of an effort to hunt this down. It is truly worth having at least once, make an occasion of it. Highly recommended."

"Picked up the 2013 at the Burger Bar in Vegas. Poured well, minimal foam. Has a very fruity nose at first. The carbonation is different, more smooth than a standard beer. Fairly light mouth feel for a stout. Fantastic coffee finish."

"2012. This is light. Wow. Its ok, wish it had more flavor."
""

"Not at all what I've come to expect from a barrel aged RIS. Comparable to a lawyer who's son decides to goes to Art School... A complete disappointment."

"Pours a black body with a mostly dark fruit, raisin/prune aroma along with roasted malts, touches of sweet malts and bread and booze. A really dry, roasted malt beer with some cracker like dryness that is big and boozy, almost medicinal, with a strong dark fruit flavor (raisins, figs, prunes) and subtle tastes of coffee and dark chocolate sweetness. More of a dry, sipping stout than it has sweetness or balance and finishes dry with a little alcohol heat."

"I am in love with this beer. The mouthfeel is a light as a feather considering that this is a stout. The champagne qualities of the yeast have done this beer many graceful favors. It has given it a texture that is almost ethereal. It finishes dry and drying to leave resonant aftertastes of toffee, cherry and chocolate. This one was a ride in a limousine."
""
"Poured from 750 ml bottle into glasses. Dark brown, almost black with a nice, thick tan head that holds fairly well. Smells straight up of bourbon. Very slight notes of chocolate and roast, but mostly a subtle but distinct American bourbon aroma. Lots of bourbon in the taste as well, but again subtle, not overwhelming. A very easy drinking smoothness to this stout. Not harsh or astringent at all. Overall, it's priced much too high, but is still a wonderful bourbon barrel-aged stout."

"O I guess I shouldn't really discuss this, due to the hush hush nature of this non-existent brew, but if it did exist I'd say it was quite a nice bourbony heavy brew that kept giving me some real port feels throughout the bottle. It was a good drink."

"If I ever get my hands on another bottle, I'd be willing to give it a second chance (and a new review), but I'm not going to pay for it, that's for sure."
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty freaking solid RIS that you should not pass up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The 2012 bottle is awesome! The beer poured a dark opaque with tan head that is not lacing. The scent carries roast, bourbon and dark fruit. The taste is very smooth with bourbon base with touches of earth roast and plume at the finish. The mouthfeel is full body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is very light and active for a barrel aged stout, which was expected due to the re-fermentation. There's still some stickiness on the finish. Overall, this is an appealing brew with very deep levels of complexity, and the mouthfeel is very interesting. With a few months on it, the bourbon has seemed to move into the background a bit, but is still there. Worth trying, but the price was just a tad high for me."
""
""
""
""
"O- overall I thought this was pretty good. My previous bourbon barrel stout was from Central Waters Brewing co, which in my opinion is one of the best examples of a barrel aged beer out there. I think what threw me off here was the after taste. It wasn't bad, just odd. I think the big takeaway here is that I should probably have aged this for a few months at least. That's the plan for next time."

"There are some good qualities about this beer and then there are some truly odd ones. It's a very mixed bag for an expensive beer."
"O: I didn't age this one, and I don't feel robbed at all. I might get another bottle and let it sit. Maybe that would make it even better. Overall, if you're into darker, thicker, more bourbon -oriented beer, this is a must have."

"An awe-inspiring bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout, whether aged or not. But, I must say, the aging takes a lot of the sting away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Recommendation - Age this bad boy. Not worth buying and drinking right away."

"O - Oh my! This is my second Black Ops. The first one I chilled, then drank right up. This one I let age for over a year under my bar. The flavors have matured and melded to a point where they are so well integrated that the full potential of this stout comes to bear. In my honest opinion, this stout should *never* be consumed until it has aged for at least one full year."
""
""
""
"Overall – The aroma and look of the beer (especially the aroma) were fantastic and really gave me high hopes after the initial pour. The taste and the feel however fell a bit short of expectations for the price I had to pay (~$20). The feel was too thin and the taste was not roasty enough and fell short of the big bourbon aromas that I was hoping would be present on the tongue as well."
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting beer that could use a stronger presence from the more subtle notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the bottle it explains that Black Ops doesn't exist...what truly doesn't exist is any barrel character here what-so-ever."
""
"Initial poor is that of used motor oil and a solid dark brown caramel head. Aroma is very sweet, boozy, great bourbon notes, and vanilla, but also very complex. There is certainlty alot going on here. Taste is very boozy and that of sweet candied fruit - cherry, raspbbery, figs and dates. Mouthfeel is very slick like a banana peel of motor oil. This is a delicious bourbon barrel aged stout that should be bought whenever seen and extra bottles aged in the cellar!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The nose is the highlight. Perhaps some cellaring would do this brew well. It's a damn good stout, don't get me wrong, but not worth searching the ends of the earth for."

"O: Overall just a solid example of a great Russian Imperial Stout !! Period"
"Overall, I'm very impressed with this beer. The flavor is complex and wonderfully balanced, and the bottle fermentation does amazing things with the mouthfeel. Can't wait for next year's!"
""
"Nice take on a BA stout. Oak flavors work well. Comes off less sweet than their Black Chocolate Stout. Great sipper on a cold night."
"O- It is not a bad beer, maybe after a little aging some more flavors well come out. That is what i am hoping for because I have 3 in my cellar right now."

""

"O- I was totally blown away by how good this beer was. I forgot who gave this beer to me as an extra, but thank you sooo much. I imagine that the age on this beer is what did it so well. Perhaps better techniques for a smaller brewery back then?"
""
""
""
""
"I have another bottle in the cellar--2012 I believe--that I'm just going to let sit for a while. Should be interesting in a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Worth the buy, then again I got this as a gift from my staff. I suggest cellaring for a while then it would be great as a true vintage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: If you’re going to buy it, I suggest cellaring for a while or picking up a well cared for old vintage. This is not worth the $20 as is, save for the experimentalism of it."

"Overall, an outstanding, subtle BA beer. Barrel is not prominent in the taste, but is in the scent. Good blend of barrel and traditional stout malts. Glad I was able to find this."
"O: The flavor of the beer is really the only kicker to me, I see that they change it a little every year and maybe this year for the flavor wasn't their year, overall it's a solid stout, I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but if it happens to be at your bottle shop it is definitely worth a try"
"O: Coming into this tasting, I had both high expectations and concerns that this might be a hyped up beer selling for $25 a bomber. However, I can say that this beer is well deserving of most of the hype surrounding it. Having had other popular bourbon barrel aged stouts (Bourbon County & Hill Farmstead's Genealogy of Morals) I can say that I think Black OPS is among the best. Genealogy is slightly more perfect, in my opinion, probably because that spends 20+ months in barrels rather than 4, and although it is a tad sweet and could use a year or two aging, it is very much world-class and worth the try. Glad I got my hands on two bottles this year."
"O. Not bad but the strong boozy nature really dominants in a negative way. I've had much higher abv stouts that are smoother and more balanced. Since it rings in at around 20 bux a bomber, I expected more. I would try this on draft but will likely pass from a bottle in the future."

"O: A very well balanced BBA stout. Theres plenty of dark fruit as well as roastiness. The 11.5% is very nicely hidden and makes this quite drinkable but still a sipper. A bit pricey at $20 for a 750 C&C bottle, but it's great to drink now or be aged so it's a good investment"
""
""

"it pours a very very dark brown almost black with light pouring in around the edges. It surprisingly has a slight head with little retention. At 10.5 and on cask I would expect nill. The smell is very barrel forward but in a nice way with oak and a slight chocolate nose that really is inviting as it is already warm and ready to go. The taste is easy drinking with a slight alcohol burn with a bourbon presence. It is an experience though with the change in flavor profile on cask. The mouthfeel is thin for the style but then so is the bottled version. Then again its on cask and I expected more but it is still a nice experience as the beer went down very easy. Overall I enjoyed the beer but I feel the novelty of the cask added a lot and I was still very happy to have had it. Now the last sip! Cheers"
""
"Pours almost black with a thick, medium brown foamy head that settles back to about a quartet-inch. Smell is of chocolate and vanilla, with sweet bourbon notes. Feel is medium-thick, with light carbonation. Taste is bourbon and roasted coffee with chocolate. Finish is dry, with lingering bourbon and a light alcohol warmth. There is more oak and vanilla as it warms up. Overall, this is smooth and drinkable, with great flavor. It's lighter than one might expect, and the light carbonation really brings out the flavor nicely."

"Flavor starts out with an interesting molasses and booze - cedarish even with a little bit of fruit. Surprisingly delicate for a barrel aged brew. Never too sweet and gets better as it warms. Big on the bourbon and vanilla which is accentuated by the rather medium body. Alll the parts are well integrated and tastes like a well thought out recipe. Even with the steep price tag, I'd buy it again."
""
"Overall - I didn't like this fresh as much as I like it now. The oxidation adds a level of complexity."
""
""
"Overall great beer. Perhaps a bit lacking in the bourbon department, but this is wonderfully balanced beer. It's not my favorite BA Stout, but I am glad to have the chance to have one with a bit of age on it. Will look for 2013 vintage this winter and try fresh. Cheers."

"This is one of those where the sum is greater than its parts. It's really good and strong and bold, but gentle and fresh at the same time. I like high ABV beers, but I'm not a spirit drinker. As such, most barrel aged beers don't work for me. But this was different. The alcohol was just a bit player. Well done."

"2011 aged about a year and half in my basement. So smooth. Better than 2012 by just a hair, but that may be the aging. No superlatives capture it. If you are a fan of beer, then something has to be everything you expect, love, hope out of a beer, and you should score it perfectly. This is one of mine. Perfect."

"I think my rating may be little harsh... The beer was not awful, disgusting, or hard to drink by any means, but it is incredibly overrated (and probably over-priced), and it's one of the weakest attempts at the style that I've come across, especially for having some decent acclaim. I appreciate Mike's generosity of sharing, but we both agreed that this is not how a stout was meant to be. I still don't understand all the positive reviews."

"HA. Now that I read the label, it says it was refermented with champagne yeast. So that's exactly what I was tasting."
"O- Commonly overpriced and I've had better, but still a very delicious and potent RIS."

"Aged for a year in the cellar and served in a Selinsgrove snifter. Pours thick and black with a dark, milk chocolate head. The oak notes dominate the nose, rising into bourbon burn before falling into; dates and chocolate. The champagene yeast dominates the flavor overwhelming the black chocolate opening, with sour apple and sharp pear. The wood finishes but it all fades fast and finishes smooth. You can tell they are striving for greatness and next time I'll buy 2 bottles (despite the price): one to drink fresh and one for 3 years deep. Smooth easy and effortless."

"Pours extremely dark brown to black capped by a two finger tan head. Toasted oak, vanilla, bakers chocolate, hints of bourbon booziness, and accents of dark fruit. Big oak notes, vanilla, hints of dried black cherries, raisins, and prunes transitioning to dark chocolate and finishing with some more oak notes accented with pleasant warming bourbon booziness. Medium-bodied, certainly light for a imperial stout; creamy, with effervescent carbonation, undoubtedly due to the champagne yeast. Overall, this is an interesting and enjoyable beer. The re-fermentation in the bottle using champagne yeast does seem to work better with the other brews in the Big Bottle Series, however Black Ops is definitely an enjoyable, unique brew."

"Deep brown/black pour with a mocha colored foamy head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Smells of raisins, chocolate, oak, vanilla, prunes and alcohol. Taste is chocolate but somewhat chalky, faded bourbon elements, a bit of alcohol, oak wood. Mouthfeel is lighter than I'd like. Carbonation is decently adequate. As it warms, more noticeable alcohol. Perhaps it didn't age well, but I'm not digging this one."
""
""
"Overall pretty good, but mixed. The aroma is awesome, but flavor doesn't come through as much as I expected, and the body seems a bit thin for what it should be. Still tasty and a treat to drink, the aging didn't seem to really help as much as I expected as the booze is still rampant, bourbon seems to have died off a bit perhaps, and it's sweet and syrupy, but the soft aged dark malt feel brings a decent touch. However, the over roasted burnt acrid coffee I think I remember from fresh small sample I had is mostly gone, so that helps a bit. Still a pretty good beer."

"Had a glass of this as part of Easter dinner. Poured into a pint glass, it was jet black and had a moderate (albeit temporary) head. Lifting the glass to my nose, I was instantly hit by scents of bourbon, oak, vanilla, spices, and something vaguely and distantly fruity. The taste was similar. I did notice that as it warmed, the beer gave off much more of a bourbon taste and the 10.5% alcohol really started to come through. Overall, I enjoyed this as a sipping beer for a special occasion but it had too much of a bourbon taste for my liking. I would not turn this beer down, but I think I will stick to Founder's Breakfast Stout for now."
""

"Very nice BA RIS, but not in the class of BCBS, KBS."
""
""
""
"Reviewed from notes. Pours opaque black with evidence of champagne yeast as it it is rather fizzy. Head quickly fizzes out, much like a glass of soda. The nose is heavy on chocolate malts, fruity yeast esters come next which is followed by smokey and robust oak. The taste starts with chocolate and then takes an unexpected turn that I can't quite get in to. I pick up some metallic tons along with grapes, dark fruit, and a mild wave of vanilla. The mouthfeel is prickly and fizzy, just doesn't work for a barrel aged stout. Overall, this one doesn't work for me. I don't get much barrel character but I get tons of the effervescent champagne yeast character that seemingly detracts from this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fine beer. Worth the $20 (or so) for the 750mL bottle. Delicious layers of dark, roasted malt, bourbon and chocolate flavors... Mouthfeel is lively and the champagne yeast adds an extra dimension that sets this beer apart from most other imperial stouts. At 10.5%, this stout is very drinkable. I'll definitely have it again... A very complex, tasty and interesting beer from Brooklyn."
""
""
""
"Overall: Its still a pretty good beer, but a total letdown. I'd pay maybe 7 or 8 bucks for it, not 20 something."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's not terribly complex, but the flavors that are there are fine. Just nothing to stand out, especially in the weight of the body. It's quite drinkable, but the body leaves something to be desired. I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be, but worth trying once. I have one more bottle, so we'll see what happens to it."
""
"O – This is a good and interesting RIS but unfortunately it does not pass into the realm of elite. I think it definitely has the potential given the aromas and taste, but the mouthfeel is way too thin. My guess is that it’s from the champagne yeast. I’m not sure if that kind of yeast adds more to the aroma or flavor, but I almost wish they used regular old ale yeast. While the mouthfeel doesn’t quite fit the big RIS style, it is an interesting and very different touch. All in all, this is a tasty and drinkable beer, and I’m very glad that I got to try it."

"Pours black with tall mocha colored head. Aroma is strong bourbon with a hint of chocolate in the background. Some slight effervescence for an impy. Medium mouthfeel. Not highly carbonated but different from most impy stouts I have had. Big bourbon and booze notes with a very roasty backbone. Fades to chocolate just a bit, but a somewhat bitter finish. Strange for the style, but not completely awful. Just don’t think the yeast works for this. Comes off more ad a bourbon porter and your $23+ is better spent elsewhere."
""
""
"Snagged this while on vacation in Dallas. Pitch black pour with one finger caramel colored head that fades quickly with decent lacing. Huge bourbon and oaky notes dominate the nose along with dark chocolate, coffee, licorice, and just a touch of bubblegum. The oak nudges out the bourbon for the top spot in the taste. Probably some of the most intense woodiness I've ever tasted in a barrel aged stout. Almost comparable to a good oak aged wine. Also getting hints of chocolate, tobacco, espresso, molasses, vanilla, and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is really creamy with a subtle thickness to it, but a little more fizzy than a typical big stout. Definitely not as heavy as most, with a nice vinous character on the finish. I really wasn't expecting to be blown away by this beer, but it really was a pleasant surprise. Because it's lighter in feel, it's really drinkable and the 10.5 ABV is well hidden. I will definitely be trying to get more of this one!"
"Overall: A very good and unique version of a barrel aged imperial stout. Has the good chocolate and fruit notes of the base beer and adds an interesting twist with the champagne yeast along with the barrel. Really good."

"O: good but bourbon notes could be bigger and champagne yeast makes it a little lighten than I'd prefer, unique. Not great and not worth the price but glad I got to try it"

"The use of Champaign yeast gives the beer a lightness that one wouldn't expect from a RIMP."
""
""
"The body was nicely smooth and even, there was a tangy finish that was clean and dry. There was a bit of an aspect that I couldn't really figure out, a slight funk that wasn't really a taste, but hung around over the whole of the beer. Drinkability was very good, I enjoyed this brew and would like to try some more. Overall, a very nice beer that's certainly worth your time."

"I feel that the mystique surrounding this offering is a little uninformed - it isn't really all that 'big' in the general booze and malt sense. It's hefty, sure, but in a much more restrained, subtle sense - coffee, cocoa, and fruit, all fluffed up by a crazily understated alcohol measure, one which may the enduring point here, as you can barely sense the barest prick of alcohol edge. That may very well be the biggest champion for this offering, which parlays rather well into my overall impression - big, level, and sneaky, all at the same time. Maybe not quite worth spending all that much effort seeking out, but grab it if you can, even if you have to bend your local retailer's ear and/or arm."

"A serious sipping beer. Full bodied liquid velvet. Smooth with a capital and underlined SMOO. Nicely warming. A bit cloying after the swallow with a goodly coating of the upper palate. It goes great with homemade chocolate chip cookies. ;) A rich, decadent dessert in a glass. Should have shared this but I'm just too greedy."
""
""
"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable and warming, but there is no alcohol burn or heat. This is a very nice beer. I will keep the other bottles I have for a while, to see how they age."
""
""
"Glad I got a chance to try this - I think I'd like to compare it with a fresher edition to get a sense of what the age does to the brew. Good stout."
"Poured from a 2011 bottle on super bowl sunday! A very solid brew, albeit a bit expensive. Lots of delicious bourbon in the nose. A great black color and a deep brown head. The taste is very mild. There is nothing amazing about this beer but it is very solid and smooth. For over 10% it goes down easy. If this was cheaper I could crush this all day."
""
"O: Overall a great beer I have searched for three years for this beer and so happy this one did not dissapoint, was very good and will keep looking for it even though I personally thought I overpaid but not by much and was very pleased with the product."

""
"O: Solid BA stout although the alcohol is not as forward as I would like with the taste. Still definitely worth trying!"
"Overall - Decent but i was expecting alot more. The flavor is really mild for being higher alcohol and barrel aged ris. As this warms, the alcohol comes out more, not more flavors. Very overpriced and not nearly as good as lets say, kbs. Worth a drink espically for fans of the style, just too mellow for my liking."
""
""
"O - A really good stout I'm enjoying drinking, but very muted flavors. I like it, its not so in your face. I was going to buy another bottle to age, but I don't think I will as I can't see this one really improving with aged for my tastes."

"You should pour carefully or half the glass will get filled with dark brown microfoam, very whipped up and almost delicate, no dimpling, close to zero lacing, slides right off the glass sides. The liquid is, naturally enough, jet black and seems clear, no visible bubbles, touch of orange at the rims. The nose features roasted cocoa, caramel, coffee and anise, close to too muscular for the flowers and tangerine to shine, low level of plum and fig fruit scents, no discernible hops presence, really not that boozy at all. Full-bodied, dry yet creamy in texture, here you get more butterscotch, caramel, coconut and vanilla bean from the barrel treatment. Also still loaded with cocoa, mocha with more cola to black licorice than coffee accents. Too dry for the cherry, plum and raisin fruit to spread. The carbonation is arguably too fine for the overall body weight. Has good integration and balance yet not so much richness of flavor and flow. (2012 Edition)"

"O For the many characteristics of taste that protrude it's a pretty balanced stout aside from the slight booze after taste. But should be cheaper on the wallet for what it is."
""
"Good brew, almost gotta try a glass. Not my fit for be $$."
"While Black Ops isn't quite what I expected it is quite good. More barrel than booze and more sweet than roasty, this is a different take on the barrel aged imperial stout. I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops over a year or two."

"Poured 2012 vintage into a 16 oz snifter. Poured down the middle and got a massive light brown head, that leaves a little lace. Smell is strong bourbon, some dark chocolate, vanilla, anise, and dark fruits. Taste is very aggressive bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, and some smoke left on the tongue. Body is thinner than I prefer, the amount of life you would expect from the style, a little dry, and drinks fairly easy. Will pick up another and let it mature, a little too one dimensional with bourbon being to overbearing now. I want a beer with bourbon flavors, not a IRS that had bourbon poured into it. Not sad, just like more balance."
"I look forward to reviewing my 2012 bottle in a couple years."
""
""
"Overall a real tasty beer, can compete with some of the other bourbon barrels but may fall a little short of the greats. I like the uniqueness of the yeast."
""
"O: Overall it was one of the better RIS's I've had, let alone stouts. I would buy it again if cost and availability permits. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good stout (naturally) but those who don't drink whiskey or bourbon might be turned off by the flavors it adds. I really enjoyed the complexity it adds without overpowering the beer."

"Bottle is fresh as can be, 2012 in a place you would never expect. Super light mouthfeel, its champagne-like, bubbly, effervescent like Belgian yeti. Not a stout feel at all, yet delicious. Give this 2 years it will be insatiable. Get it now if you can, age it now if you can, drink it now if you can, just plain drink it"
"Overall I couldn't have been more pleased with this beer. I have been fairly off stouts recently mainly because American brewers have been adding a lot more hops which I just do no enjoy in my beers and also many are too sweet and syrupy. But here the extra age and addition of champagne yeast adds a different dynamic to this offering. Not sure what it was like fresh but with 2 years on this, it's a winner for me."
""
""
""
""
"Due to Brooklyn Brewery fanboyism and my like for bourbon, I still like this a lot. I've got another bottle that'll be aged for a year and reviewed then."
""
"O: One of my favorite beers EVER. To be honest, the nose did put me off a bit, but the balanced mix of dark chocolate, bourbon, and delicate wine yeast made this something to remember. Brooklyn, you’ve stolen my heart with this beer – I’m in love."
""
""
""
"O- I've always thought was a bit expensive at $20-25. Seems like it should be sitting in the $14.99-17.99 range. I really prefer this with two years on it to let the booze settle down and blend in with all the other luxurious notes that this RIS has to offer. The mouthfeel has also always been my biggest pet peave with this one."
"Overall: I think this can get there with age, but it's just not what I'm looking for right now. I think BCBS and BCBS Coffee are significantly better at the same price point and have way more flavor, not even aged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very reminiscent of Weyerbacher Heresy, which is a fraction of the cost of Black Ops. This begs the question ``why pay $23 for a bottle of Black Ops?''. Answer: don't. It's got good flavor, but lousy value. Spend the $20 on multiple bottles of Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout instead. It is far better than this and much less expensive."
"Overall, I thought the nose on this beer excellent, but the flavors didn’t quite live up to expectations, being more watery and more geared toward sweet sugars (as opposed to bourbon and ash) than expected, the heavy alcohol burn does somewhat detract from the experience, and the strangely watery mouthfeel adds a further note of disconnectedness. This is not to say that the beer is bad—in fact, it’s delicious—but it does tend to come across more like a barrel-aged stout, and not a barrel-aged Imperial Stout. Still very much worth trying."

"O: Due to the thinness it's almost an easy drinking, high-ABV RIS (if there were such a thing). Sharp boozy bourbon reminds you right away that this is no wussy brew. Roasted malt presence is oddly subdued by the thinness and bourbon. Just a bit of chocolate. I've had 5% porters with stronger roasted malt character. Needless to say, a very unique brew, it definitely stands alone as far as RISes go. Honestly it's not bad, either. Kind of a thin, effervescent chocolatey-bourbon combination that goes down easy. Once it warms the flavor balance is pretty decent in fact. I will give this one good marks due to it's decent execution of such a unique combination that I honestly would have never expected to work. Don't pick this up thinking it's some brownie-batter huge RIS because it's not. I think with a little more age on it the bourbon might mellow out a bit and this could be really good."

"O: Outstanding barrel aged Russian Iperial Stout. This is all that is hyped to be."

"[O] In my experience with Black Ops... the fresher the better. Not to say that aged bottles aren't enjoyable. But as with most beers, I've come to find that they generally don't improve with age - stout, bourbon barrel aged, or otherwise. Bottom line: Black Ops is a good purchase for $20 or less...but a bad buy for more than that."
"Had this for my 30th and it was nothing short of awesome! I loved and bourbon barrel aging and in bottle fermenting with champagne yeast. It was smooth and delicious but drink this bad boy as your last beer of the night when ur still sober cause it really is tasty. Oh yea, we had to get 2 bottles once we had the first."

"Pours very dark, with a thin tan head that quickly recedes. Intense milk chocolate aroma with light notes of dark fruit and a hint of banana. Chocolate dominates the taste with a some mild coffee, but overall the flavors are significantly muted compared to the aroma. Highly carbonated for the style, a bit thin, and with a slightly harsh alcohol bite. I suspect that the use of champagne yeast acts to the detriment of this beer, attenuating it more than really necessary."

"Overall: This beer smells great and tastes really good. I wouldn't have minded if the carbonation was a bit more delicate."

"Nothing mind blowing, but it's a SOLID Imperial Stout. Very highly recommended."

"The beer pours a deep, inky black color with a tan head. The aroma is very complex. I get a ton of chocolate, bourbon and raisins, as well as some roasted malt notes. The flavor is just as great, with some additional notes. The bourbon is front and center, with some chocolate, dark fruit, raisins and alcohol thrown in. As the beer gets a little warmer, I get some oak, vanilla and maple notes. The beer is fairly sweet and boozy, but it is still very easy to drink. Thick, full mouthfeel and low carbonation.

"Black body with a tan head - quintessential imperial stout appearance. Good lacing and a solid amount of lacing. Nose has baker's chocolate, brown sugar, some light vanilla, gentle bourbon with a touch of coffee. Again, gentle bourbon sweetness on the palate, light coffee (perhaps a bit of espresso?), dark chocolate and perhaps a bit of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is a let down for me, thin and almost watery. Sweet bourbon notes help support some feel, but density is too low for my liking within the style. On the bright side, this certainly lends the stout to easy consumption. A good RIS, but the body isn't there to make this standout for me."
""
""
"Overall: Excellent beer, the only negative is the high price tag ($30+). Another good special occasion beer."
""
""
"O - This is an interesting beer. It carries the flavor and aroma profile of a big imperial stout but the softer more supportive body of a Belgian dark. The bourbon barrel aging adds layers that make it a beer to truly sit back and enjoy. Solid."
"O: Although this year (2010) is not as well rounded as the first (2008) bottled release, it's still an excellent imperial stout."
""
""
"O - This is an amazing beer. Hearing mixed reviews and a high price tag has kept me away from this beer in the past. Finally decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. Amazing chocolate base beer that was perfectly bourbon barrel aged. Add in the uniqueness of the champagne yeast and this makes for a stellar stout."

""

"O - This has good drinkability. It has nice flavor and goes down smooth. Overall, I think it is a nice beer, as well as a nice example of the style. It has a nice bourbon character to it, but I wish there was a little more roasted bitterness to it, and maybe some hop presence. It is a nice beer overall though, and worth trying out. I'd drink it again."

"I understand that bomber bottles, time in captivity, and exclusivity bring the price of a brew up, but $24 is a tad absurd. Eh."

"Two fingers of dark chocolate head on a jet black body. Excellent retention and good lacing. Aroma is is nutty with chocolate, roasted malt and bourbon notes. Flavor is excellent with initially a chocolate with light coffee and coconut notes blending well with a smooth bourbon finish. Thick and full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall this beer is very smooth with the bourbon present in the flavor and aroma without the sharpness in the mouthfeel."
""
"O - A great beer, but a tad spendy ($20 for 750ML). Put it in your cellar for a year or two and it will be world-class. As I don't have a cellar I'm just happy to find this one and experience it now."
"O: It was an experience drinking this beer. It was a one time treat due to the price, but this is one of the best beers of any style that I've ever tasted. The Brooklyn brewery really knows what they're doing. Cheers!"
"Overall: I always end up with the same reaction to this beer. It smells great, but the body and mouthfeel aren't on par. Bourbon is aggressive and even with age it doesn't back off enough to really blend with malts."

"O: Incredibly well balanced oak and bourbon expressions, which both confidently project themselves without dominating. A solid BBRIS all round, although it offers no reason to bestow superlatives for orginality or complexity.

"O - Didn't know what to expect, reviews seem to be quite polarized on this one. I definitely enjoyed it, big flavor profile with great balance. It's quite sweet, but the flavors are so good it's acceptable."
"Looks amazing. Very thick, totally opaque, with a nice big chocolate milk colored head. The lacing changes with every sip. Aroma is like chocolate whisky with a variety of subtle complexities. Black cherry, raspberry, raisins, leathery tobacco, molasses, musky coffee, and sweet caramel drizzle. Taste is full of complexities though still smooth even with the alcohol punch. Soft caramelly dark chocolate, mollasses, tobacco, vanilla, toffee, maybe even a touch of orange. Mouthfeel is very appealing to me. Full body with a smooth, soft touch. Feels light and fluffy but there's deceptive density. Mmmm."
"Nice...I had not tasted this one until now, some three-plus years after buying the bottle, but I would imagine age has done some good. Sleek, well-blended flavor."
""
""
"I know 750ml all to myself would have been over the top. This was a very tasty treat and I would love to try another bottle even though it will be a different vintage."
""
"I’m long past the days where stouts impress me simply because they’re barrel-aged, but Brooklyn Black OPS is a genuinely lavish beer. In fact, I'm feeling pretty good about dropping the $20 plus dollars on a few bottles; it was worth it and, although this has since been re-released, I wish I had bought up a few more of the original batch. Not a lot of beers offer this much drinkability while retaining so much rich, decadent complexity."
""
"Not a bad beer, its biggest flaw is that the body makes it seem too thin; the flavors are pretty well spot on and I really like that the Bourbon barrel did not end up being too overwhelming for the base beer flavors and they remain pretty smooth. As the beer warms up it seems to get a bit thinner and a bit more Bourbon dominated, neither of which really helps things."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I have to go with a B+ or A- on this one. The biggest knock on it is the champagne yeast that they used. It's OVER carbonated. Takes away from the flavors that would normally linger on the tongue a while."
""
"It pours a deep black with a thin brown head that fades into a ring around the center. The smell really threw me at first. The first distinguishable aroma was bananas. The more I dove in the more I was able to get through the initial banana onslaught I was able to pick out subtle oak and bourbon aroma with hints of chocolate, vanilla, and roasted grains. The taste, unlike the aroma, did not contain banana thankfully. There were chocolate notes, vanilla, oak, a hint of bourbon, and roasted notes, with surprisingly no noticeable alcoholic taste. The mouthfeel was carbonated perfectly, medium-full body with a medium carbonation and a lingering finish. Easy to drink, perhaps too easy to drink. Overall I'm glad I finally tried the beer, but I wouldn't say the price is justified."
"[93/100]"
"Moderate carbonation an a full body, this beer is something to be proud of. Brooklyn has a winner here, and while it'd defiantly a sipping beer, I would be incredibly tempted to drink another bottle solo."
""
""
""
""
"O - Thoroughly disappointed by this. Although it pours well and has a nice aroma, the rest of this beer is par at best. I could almost chug this beer from the mouthfeel. Putting the base in a barrel cannot hide this one. Points are actually taken away for wasting Woodford Reserve barrels on this. This is approachable for many new to the style, but nothing more. Now I've got to drink some Woodford Reserve, neat, to make me feel better about life."
""
""
""
"O- I'd had a number of beers that night before this one, but the either way the Bourbon taste would have been way too much. That said, I personally don't like wood-aged beers with or without liquor in the wood."
""
"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled 10/21/2010. Pours pitch black, with a nice 2 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing on the glass; with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big bourbon, caramel, toffee, vanilla, chocolate, roasted malt, light dark fruitiness, and a bit of alcohol. Nice and well balanced aromas. Taste of big caramel, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, molasses, oak, roasted malt, light coffee, and a bit of spiciness. Lingering notes of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and oak on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. A bit of prickly carbonation from the bottle conditioning. Alcohol is well hidden at 11.3% with only a warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent, balanced, and smooth barrel aged imperial stout. A bit different due to the champagne yeast bottle conditioning. Probably not worth $22 for another bottle, but it was nice to try once."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Definitely an interesting and different take on the style using the champagne yeast. I want to like this beer but the high carbonation and thin feel are throwing me, I would also have liked a bit more malt character to offset the strong bourbon flavors and in general the whole beer just doesn't come together for me. I had high expectations for this one and was pretty disappointed, especially for $20 a bottle."
"Overall: the $23 tag doesn't make this a everyday go to brew, but I am happy I got a few bottles for future occasions after some time."
""
""
""

"Pours a dark brown with a perfect one finger chocolate head. Excellent lacing on my New Belgium glass. Nose is bourbon, oak, vanilla. Pretty nice aroma coming off this beer. The taste is full, with bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate and malt/ alcohol coming through. This brew would probably do well with aging. Feel is full, with a nice alcohol oak aftertaste. Overall,a really nice RIS that's worth seeking out. Cheers"
""
""
""
""
"As for all the hype around the beer? I dunno..."
"O: Overall, I thought this was a great beer. The fact that it had strong bourbon aromas and a strong bourbon taste without too much burn made for a nice smooth drinking experience. After the bourbon flavor/aromas subsided, other more subtle flavors like vanilla, chocolate and yeast-like flavors/aromas appeared."
""
"O - Complex, but lacking at the same time. I expected a little bit more as a ""special release"" beer, but was enjoyable none the less. I found this to be a notch or two above an excellent/outstanding Imperial Stout; not necessarily ""special release"" material. Good example of the style."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Swirling down a 2011 version and it's still much thinner than I would expect. Great for a special dinner I guess."
""
""
""
""
"Black Ops is undoubtedly in my top 5 Russian Imperial Stouts, and to me is Brooklyn's best offering. Many thanks to my friend Frank for selecting and sharing this gem. Fabulous and first rate."
""
"O - An enjoyable but not world-class RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love this, but the price and availability bring this down for me. This is very easy to drink though and incredibly complex, highly recommended."
"Overall: Black Ops was Well Balanced and smooth. I really liked the Vanilla and bourbon combination. I cant wait to get another bottle of this beer again."
""
""
""
""

"Pours black in color with a finger of brown head. A rich bourbon aroma along with plenty of oak and roasted malt. There's a nice vanilla note and some dark chocolate and molasses. The flavor isn't quite as good, but still solid. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, and molasses with a bit of bourbon and vanilla. Maybe a little heavy on the charred wood flavor for my tastes. A little boozy, too. Medium to full bodied with medium carbonation."
"Lots of whiskey notes, which make it clean compared to something like BORIS. Subtle and nuanced. A heavy hitter with lots of layers."
"Crazy good beer. I almost passed this up at the store due to the unassuming bottle. Poured a super deep black with a surprisingly thin head. Smells of rich dark coffee/chocolate, and a big hit of bourbon on the nose. A whole lot less carbonated than I thought it was going to be, given the description, but in a good way. Flavors of rich dark tones highlighted the beer, and flowed into bourbon notes at the end. Nice and crisp finish, with a perfect aftertaste that lingers for the right amount of time."
"This is dissapointing. Maybe it's faded away after a year in the cellar? Not worth the price at all. I won't be seeking this one out again."
""
""
""
"And this is one of those RISs that is viscous and velvety at the same time. Sip this one, enjoy it and don't overdo it otherwise you might be at risk of repeating ""Eli has a horseshoe up his ass"" about ten times in ten minutes and not even realizing it. Love ya Duck! Go Big Blue!"
"Quite good, but neither worth the price ($30/750mL) nor hype."
"not a bad beer, but its not something you should age for 3 years. i'll have to revisit this, but this is something i'd avoid."
""
""
"overall, a very good beer but ultimately fell short of expectations. which were considerable considering the price point black ops brings. no way this beer is worth anything close to that. i'm docking it a half point here for bad value."
"Pours a dark brown almost black with a super thick and frothy dark tan head that refuses to dissipate. This puppy looks amazing. Smells of deep roasted malts, coffee and chocolate and just a tad of dark ripe fruit comprise a great nose. First sip is creamy good with sweet overly roasted dark malts hitting first with a generous amount of coffee and dark chocolate aiding on a bitter finish. The 10.7% ABV is fairly well hidden. I had one of these back in ’08 and was not impressed then. I am impressed now...just not $21/bottle impressed."
""
"This brew was supposedly barrel-aged in Woodford Reserve bottles (which may be why I like this so much as Woodford Reserve is one of my favorite bourbon brands). Black Ops was aged for four months in bourbon barrels, bottled flat, and re-fermented with Champagne yeast, which the intent was to create big chocolate and coffee flavors with a rich underpinning of vanilla-like oak notes. The brewery claims that there are only 1000 cases of this special brew annually. Pours jet black with a mocha head along beautiful lacing that lasts well throughout the session. Big chocolate, some licorice, cocoa nibs, paramount bourbon aroma and taste. Also picked up some oak, vanilla, and coffee in the flavor. Warm alcohol was detected especially in the back finish. Smooth medium to thick mouthfeel. An excellent stout!"
""
""
""
""
"This brew is spectacular in a lot of areas. It is also just right without any aging- the booze is mild and the flavors are all quite robust and clean."
"This was a really good bottle to prepare for the Giants game."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I find this to be a quite a nice barrel aged beer with the oak and vanilla character balanced...still something is missing. More beer-like complexity would be nice, but this is quite enjoyable as it is. I bet age would do wonders."
""
""
"Overall, this is a bit disappointing, especially at the price point. It doesn't taste much like a RIS, it's too... clean and ""fresh"" and light bodied. It is though very easy drinking for the high abv. It's drinkable, but I will probably never have another one of these for the price I paid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer may be a victim of its own hype, or a victim of the style category it is in, but this is not an RIS I would buy again. If the brewery wants to make a beer this thin, don't call it an RIS and I think they could save the trouble of bourbon barrel aging because there is way too much sweetness up in here."
"O: A waste of the money, for my liking. Certain people will like this I'm sure, considering Brooklyn's excellent track record. For bourbon fans only, though. It'll get you cocked too. At 10.70 percent, Black Ops doesnt mess around."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid BA stout. I like it more than the Brooklyn BCS for sure (which I do not really care for at all). I have never had it fresh, as I bought this bottle and aged it for a yr before drinking it, but I do like it with the yr on it. If i see this one again, I would buy it. However, it's a little steep in the price and I think there are some out there that are just as good if not better (try Schlafly Imperial Reserve stout for example) that also happen to be cheaper."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- different for sure. Didn't pick up much BA characteristics. Champagne yeast just overpowered the beer, and is a terrible choice of yeast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes so mellow and so good with the bourbon flavor adding to the complexities of the beer. For me, I think it would benefit from more stronger bourbon flavor profile. Then again, I had the 2008 bottle, which I can imagine have a different flavors profile compared to more recent vintages."
""
""
"A little thin-bodied for the style. Very smooth though. The carb bubbles remind me of the way Russian River does things with the Champagne yeast here. Again, different but not desireable... not a dealbreaker though either."
""
""
"The taste was initially loaded with vanilla and booze. I like the amount of vanilla, but its just a bit too hot for me. Another Brooklyn stout thats too hot for me. I wish it was a bit more complex, but the bourbon, vanilla, and booze just take over."
"Overall: Feels like this is somewhat past it's prime by about 6 months to a year. At this point, it's OK but nothing particularly special. I might pick one up next time I see it and wait for 1 year to drink."
""
""
""
""
"As I drink more, I'm getting used to the taste, its excellent, a great beer. I'll have to pick up another. This might be one of the best beers I've had. Bumping up my rating."
"D/O- Well, its different. The mouthfeel is definitely a polarizing aspect of this beer. Worth a try, but for the price I won't be buying (trading) for Black OPS again."
""
"Pretty disappointed in this one. Wish I wouldn't have sat on it for so long, as it's apparently a bit richer and more flavorful at about 6-12 months old."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Awesome beer. I generally prefer a little more roastiness in an Imperial Stout, but I feel like they held back the roastiness in order to let the bourbon shine through. I bought two so that I could age one and I'm excited to try it again in a year or so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is right up there with KBS and Parabola as far as I'm concerned. Just an outstanding imperial stout. Well done, Brooklyn."
"Overall I'm not sure how I feel about this one. At first it tasted a lot like Black Chocolate Stout, and by my second pour, once it reached room temperature, it tasted waaay too heavy on the bourbon. Somewhere in the middle would be nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A Fantastic beer!!!! Not the best barrel aged stout I've had but in my book this stout was done justice with the bourbon treatment. Good thing i have another bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an ok take on the style. The bourbon doesn't allow the other flavors and aromas to come through when relatively fresh. Perhaps some aging will take care of that. The carbonation is an issue. It leaves a prickly feeling on the tongue and, that, combined with the booziness, detracts from the other characteristics in the taste."
""
""
""
"O: a year definitely mellows this bad boy out and makes it more drinkable. Wish I had tried this when I didn't have a head cold so I could appreciate this more. Good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Eh. I finished a bottle over an hour and a half. It's not a bad beer. I'm obviously in the minority on here, but I really don't think that this is world class stuff. Lacks the depth and complexity of the best examples of the style, it's too thin bodied, and it shows it's alcohol far too well."
"Highly recommended, and if you like the regular Brooklyn BCS I am sure you will definitely enjoy the Black Ops."
""
""
""
"D- overall this is a decent bourbon aged stout, it's no KBS but it's pretty solid, the alcohol has a tendency to overwhelm the beer"

"Moutfeel is really good, not quite as full as one would expect for this style though. Even though it's a little thin, the flavor still lingers a bit. Has a decent carbonation level. Slightly gritty but mostly smooth with a slight warming finish at the end. The bourbon comes out quite a bit at the end. Pretty drinkable overall, bottle is more meant for sharing though. Good beer, one of the first barrel aged beers I'd had and it still hangs with the best of them."

"O - amazing beer! So unique. Very good."
"Big thanks goes out to the head brewer at NoDa Brewing for sharing this one with me as a celebration their grand opening! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a half finger light brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate, wood, sweet alcohol, and cherry. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, dark fruit, cherry, sweet alcohol, and dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this is definitely a solid brew. Surprisingly I have yet to have this before, and it definitely didn't let me down. Loads of complexity going on here with a great well-balanced flavor to keep you coming back for more. My only gripe is that the mouthfeel was just a little bit thin for the style in my opinion. Other than that, well done Brooklyn!"
"Overall: This really was a great beer. No a session drink by any means, but very taste and creative. Brooklyn never seems to disappoint."
"Overall: One of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking!"
"mouthfeel/overall - malts lead the way a bit too much, not overly sweet, nice alcohol burn in throat but not much in the mouth. interesting but not incredible. a bit thin in the body as well for my liking."
"It isn't too sweet imo (maybe it is my palate tonight) and that is why it deserves some credit, it has more subtlety than most Russian imperial stouts. Nice one."
"A good but unspectacular RIS--perhaps it would have been great if I had the patience and foresight to sit on it for a few more years."
"Pours into a snifter a deep dirty-oil black with about an inch of thick, creamy deep tan head that fades very slowly. Superb retention of lacing. Aroma is surprisingly light; earthy, nutty, slightly hoppy, with some vanilla and coffee noticable. There is a faint boozy smell there also. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich. Taste is of hops, coffee, some chocolate, vanilla, oaky, and a bit boozy. This is a crazy heavy stout that is excellent, but worth the $20 price tag? I'm not sure."
"O - I know they went to great lengths to do this project, but unfortunately, it's just not my thing."
"Overall, I think this is an underrated beer. It's a little expensive but well worth the money in my opinion. I'd like to try one with some age on it."
"O: Overall, it was better then a 2010 I had, because the booziness was actually complementing the flavors instead of hindering them. But nevertheless, it was pretty enjoyable and definitely better with some age on it."
"Cheers!"
"Probably one of my favorites from Brooklyn, The Black Ops poured out as a heavy duty looking black oily liquid. The head slowly makes it's way to the top of the beer. The head leaves a light scattered lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is loaded with roasted malts, dark chocolate and some coffee notes. The tastes of the beer was packed with toasted and burnt flavors, mixed with some sweet dark chocolate in there too. The mouthfeel was slick and smooth, just a touch of booze in the chest. Overall I found this one to be very good, I was very happy to have had it and would drink again if the price was right."
"Good idea to try the champagne yeast, but it's not working for me. It makes the mouthfeel too light and carbonated for a stout in my opinion. Overall, a good RIS, but not great in my book. Although this has some age on it, more time in the cellar might lighten the overpowering bourbon and allow for a better blending of the flavors."
"Overall, this surpassed my expectations.  It's pretty complex!  It's a little sweet for my taste, and I'm not getting enough of bourbon from this one.  Also, it's expensive... But definitely worth getting once a year in my opinion."
"I've always thought Black OPS was an extremely well done demonstration of how to bourbon barrel age an Imperial Stout. This had all the elements: bourbon, wood, chocolate and sweet vanilla in the perfect balance. This is easily one of the better beers of this style out there."
"The flavors are very one dimensional, while the aroma was fine, on the palate the alcohol flavors are coarse and grating, and same goes for the roast notes with some chocolate hints along the path. I really enjoyed the first 6oz, but as i work through this 750ml alone they get a bit much, but really who does that alone? Anyway, the mouthfeel is thin for a RIS if you ask me, and most other people too."
"O-Really happy i got to try just to say i tried it, but not anything special when compared some of the other Imperial Stouts that i have had. Like KBS for example. Good beer but slightly disappointing"
"O - Not a bad beer, it's something different, but it's not what I'd really go for. Worth trying."
"O- i liked this beer more than i thought i would having read some of the reviews. i have one more left, and im going to see how it ages. if i cant wait that long id love to pair it with a big and bold cigar."
"I was excited about this one and personally I was not disappointed (much). If this beer did not exist as the Brooklyn Brewery claims I would have nothing to say about it. But since it does I will say that this 2010 poured a ninja black. Had a light brown, full head with full lacing. It smells of cocoa and coffee. It tastes good I can pick up the oak barrel but I'm not sure I get as much Woodford burbon as I would like. More booze please. I can see how hardcore Russian Imp. Stout fans could disapprove but I enjoy the lighter mouthfeel of this brew."
"Excellent mouthfeel and overall very smooth Russian Imperial Stout. The bourbon flavor is very faint but is noticeable. I am not a big fan of this style, but this is definitely a beer I can get behind. Will drink again."
"O (D) - pretty disappointing. Perhaps this was a bad bottle..."
"Pours a midnight black, small brown head and some lacing. Aroma is quite boozy with bourbon, chocolate malts, coffee and clean alcohol all present. They follow through to the flavor, a strong Russian Imperial stout base laced with with Jack Daniels. Deeply roasted malts make themselves known along with a strong hit of alcohol. Some tannins and oak barrel qualities are there but somewhat muted. Mouthfeel is very smooth and carbonation is moderate to low. Overall, this was a big beer and a unique experience. I'd save a bottle for quite a while in the cellar if I had one, time would be good to let the heat die down."
"O- A little hot for my tastes, the 11.6% ABV is noticeable. It’s a sipper to be sure and nicely done but I’ve had better examples of the style."
"D - Pretty drinkable, even with the extremely strong flavors. The Bourbon flavors are very strong, and the beer is not quite perfectly balanced, but the strength of the Bourbon flavors is really nice on top of the BCS."
"Drinkability is pretty damn good. It's not thick or huge enough to wreck the palate and feels uniquely refreshing compared to so many other RIS or American stouts. There's absolutely no abv presence in any respect. The oak quality never showed up as much as I thought it might throughout the drink, but that's a minor knock against a really nice beer."
"Overall: I'm not sure how I feel about this beer. Its pretty delicious but it doesn't seem to stand up next to other barrel aged imperial stouts and after having drank it, I can say that the price is completely out of control for this beer. Sorry, Brooklyn. I love you but this is too expensive for what it is. Its worth trying, but its not worth buying. Its also not as good as Brooklyn's other, cheaper imperial stout. Cheers!"
"The CPJ"
"Inky black with caramel head, spots of lace. Full on wood and whisky aroma, chocolate, caramel. Rich and thick, with lot of vanilla, oaky whisky flavor. Pervasive pleasant espresso bitterness. Very fine carbonation makes the mouthfeel oddly schizophrenic--thick brew with aippy fine bubbles. It is interesting but a creamier mouthfeel would probbly convey the flavors more effectively. Still, this is an imprssive and delicious beer."
"O= A tasty treat indeed. Worth checking out and getting a bottle. I had this waiting for me for a long time and finally my buddy that lives in NYC was able to pick me up a bottle. The taste on this one is nice. Unique combination and for sure a unique aftertaste. The mouth was a big letdown however."
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch dark khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Random legs of lacing hang around the glass on the drink down. Smells of cocoa powder, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. Taste is very bourbon forward up front with vanilla, oak, and bourbon flavors. Chocolate and roasted dark malt tastes come around on the aftertaste. The champagne yeast gives this beer a definite prickly and lively carbonation for a RIS, but I think it works very nicely. Slight alcohol warmth is felt in the throat on the drink down. Overall, this is a tasty RIS with a very nice bourbon presence. It is also interesting to see a beer with champagne yeast. I am glad I got a chance to try this one."
"Overall a fantastic beer and a lucky find for me (not big into chasing rare beers). Don't know if I will ever have one again, but even at the high price point, if I'm ever lucky enough to run across another on the shelves I will snatch it right up."
"All-around, this is an excellent version of the style - bold and flavorful, with lots of aging potential. The barrel aging is prominent, and lends the experience a ""raw"" quality, but doesn't overwhelm the base beer entirely."
"CHEERS!"
"D: This looked and smelled fantastic. It tasted good, but was a bit rough and hot. The body was a bit weak too, so this wasn't very easy to drink. Age would definitely help mellow it out. I'm not sure if this was as good as the hype or worth the cost, now that there are so many other bourbon stouts on the market. It was """only""" really good fresh, whereas perhaps it will become more amazing with a few years of age."
"O: Yep, I tried this beer, wanted to be sure about my palate so I threw in the fridge with a champagne cork only to have the near-same experience the next night. Poor beer."
"A very good barrel aged beer that is perhaps a bit expensive for what you get. But that aside, I really enjoyed this and would have no hesitation buying another to age for a year or so. Perhaps I owe it to myself to try this young to see how hot it really is. No matter, a solid beer."
"O - I was not overly impressed with this one. Pretty average and it didn't not come across as a typical, heavy RIS. I don't think that yeast type belongs in a RIS."
"O: It's like hugging an ex girlfriend when you run into her at the supermarket. Interesting, and familiar; invoking fond memories, yet ends up being harsh and unsatisfying in the end."
" Just too average to want it again."
"Overall a great beer. I had one fresh and it was too strong with the whisky, bourbon, harsh, biting characteristics, but after aging, as expected, this beer mellowed out and has become quite enjoyable and I am proud to drink this now. I will age my last bottle for a good year or so."
"O: Total disappointment. I wouldn't try again. I'm not sure how others have rated this so high, but taste is subjective so who knows. This was horrible though..."
"O: Overall, an incredibly overpriced piece of mediocrity. Not a bad beer, but given its price it is definitely not worth it. The aroma is quite nice, but the taste reminds me of when I've experimented with adding bourbon to other stouts and accidentally added too much. The stout flavors are completely masked by the barrel."
"O: This one was a sipper for me because the strong boozy flavor. Because of that, I would only have 1 bottle at a sitting. Definitely a good beer though."
"Overall an amazing beer. Have one more 08 in the cellar. Gunna have to get some more recent bottelings to age."
"Thanks to schmittymack for sharing this one at his 50th birthday party earlier this month. I didn't get the vintage. Poured dark brown, almost black with a little light brown head. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon, oak and chewy cookies. Palate was medium bodied and smooth, with flavors of dark chocolate, bourbon, roasted malt and vanilla. Very good, but worth the price (even though I did not pay for it)"
"25.4oz bottle. 11.6% Abv. The date stamp on the back looks like it says 3159, from what I have read it means the 315th day of 2009. Pours a viscous black with a giant frothy brown head. Tons of lacing. Boozey aroma along with some roasted malts, vanilla, oak, and chocolate. I know it says it was aged in Bourbon barrels but it kind of smells like rum. Damn this beer is smooth. Nice warming alcohol flavor, but not overly harsh. Some chocolate and vanilla flavors as well. Mostly oak and alcohol at the end. Mouthfeel is very reminiscent of Guinness. The beer smells more boozey than it tastes but you can certainly tastes the bourbon. Overall this is a well crafted beer and although it was pricey I'm glad I bought it and then gave it time to age. Worth grabbing again for sure."
"Overall: Can’t decide if I love it or hate it but this beer doesn’t allow you to settle somewhere in the middle. If drinking a goblet – A. If drinking half a bottle – C. This beer is good in moderation but a killer if you’re enjoying a bottle yourself. Worth trying and sharing with many people who love a good stout."
"Overall, I hesitate to say this beer is worth $18. A good experience, but probably not one I'm going to return to."
"This beer pours black with a huge mocha head. Small beads, good retention, and slight lacing. Beautiful nose on this ale- chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, burnt sugar, coffee, and a touch of booze. The scents detected all present themselves as I sip but sweetness is heavy and the alcohol is more pronounced. Full body and highly carbonated for the style (champagne yeast I assume) but in a good and interesting way. Great beer and my favorite from Brooklyn thus far. Pick up 2 and age one of these monsters."
"During the second half of this bottle, I sparked up a cohiba maduro cigar. Absolutely fantastic combination!"
"Concluding thoughts: Overall probably one of my favorite beers to date. I wish I could have gotten another bottle to set down for awhile to see how the flavors matured. If you are a fan of barreled-age stouts, this is a must try!"
"Pours jet black, with a light brown head. In the aroma, bourbon and oak. In the taste, roasted malt, hints of chocolate and vanilla, and ends with a oaky and bourbon alcohol burn. A small bite and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry roasted malt and faint bourbon in the aftertaste. Big bourbon, sweet chocolate and vanilla, and a dry end. Not over barring at all, quite exceptional."
"HUGE HUGE LET DOWN!!!!"
"This beer pours a creamy blackness topped by a brown finger or so of foam. The head clings in a nice creamy fashion to the surface of this beer and looks rather gorgeous if I do say so myself. The aromatics are rather bourbon forward. There is vanilla and oak in the nose that would be expected with a BBA beer. There is a touch of black cherry and dark raspberry in the nose as well. The flavor has a lot of bourbon extracted from the barrels, to the point where it's almost aggressive and astringent on the palate. The fruit notes may actually be coming from the oak barrel. I would expect to taste some chocolate or coffee, but honestly I don't get either because of the bourbon. The overall experience is that this is good, but in my opinion the flavor of this beer is so dominated by the bourbon that it affects the overall flavor and enjoyment."
"Overall -- Lots of great flavors, and I especially like how much oaky vanilla comes through. However, the high alcohol presence is definitely a distraction, like the booziness of Black Chocolate Stout turned to 11. I rest the blame on the base beer rather than the barrel-aging. Not bad, but not a stunning example of the barrel-aged stout, either."
"overall, its an interesting take on the style. i could see someone who appreciates bourbon enjoying this as it is very prevalant. IMHO, its definatly not worth the 28$ i payed for this bottle, black chocolate stout blows this out of the water. bourbon barrel aged black chocolate stout, now theres an idea!"
"I have one bottle that I'm saving, but I won't be drinking it alone."
"Drink- An 11.3% with this mouthfeel was quite a suprise. I really enjoyed it. Would really like a bottle of 09 & 10 now. Would drink this again in a heartbeat."
"Pours black with thin tan head that lingered throughout. Strong bourbon on the nose at first. Sweet caramel comes out as it warmed. Boozy oaked bourbon taste. Feeling the alcohol burn down. Vanilla also. Dark chocolate on the back end taste as it warmed. Thick mouthfeel. Delicious and loved it overall."
"All in all very tasty, but for a barrel aged Imperial Stout, it leaves something to be desired. As it warmed, nothing really changed. Let's try this vintage again in a year."
"Pours a deep sable that is about a flea's eyebrow above pitch black with a thin tan head - the latter may be an artifact of how it was poured. Bourbon alcohol dominates the aroma, which has tones of semi-sweet chocolate and quality roast coffee. Flavor is like a fine mocha mixed with bourbon or brandy - the alcohol tends to dominate, if not overwhelm, the coffee and chocolate. Texture features a rather strong alcohol bite! This one is not for the faint of heart! If the alcohol bite wasn't so fierce, I would have rated this a little higher."
"Overall I think this is a little thin for the style. The 08 is the better of the two (thus that is the one I rated in the numbers). The dry after taste kinda turned me off a little."
"drinks pretty well. not exceptional, maybe not worth the price, maybe not exactly for me, but a wonderful beer nonetheless."
"[Update after having this beer several more times, including blind - the last 2 batches taste of onions]"
"This beer is very clean and the complex flavors really make it. I can't recommend aging this one, but if you come across an aged bottle, have at it. I just feel that the noticeably different flavors work to this beer's advantage."
"M: Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Silky and"
"Full body, pretty creamy feel, a bit high on the carbonation though, which interferes a bit with the smoothness. Drinks nicely, good flavor, boozy but suited for the style. Not necessarily a great bal aged stout (abyss, bcbs) but definitely solid."
"Here we have a strong piney, oak that rides in hard yet accentuates the background flavors as opposed to the beautiful leveling dance that The Abyss performs. I've always been more of a fan of hoppy than malty beers, but these two have really shined a new light on matters. Brilliant; well done."
"This is an enjoyable bal, but with a market saturated with great offers, this one falls a bit short."
"Bottle shared thanks to the ever generouse Andrewinski1. Thanks! Poured into a tulip. The beer pours black with a huge tan head at least three fingers. Great retention leaving some sticky lace behind. The aroma is kind of fruity, very boozey, slightly metallic and has a slight coffee undertone behind it all. The flavor is pretty solid. Bitter espresso and mollasses flavor. My biggest qualm is that I really get a metallic flavor also. Overall though pretty enjoyable. The body is full and smooth but what the hell? This seems like it could use a bit more carbonation. This surprises me because of the enormouse head. Not bad, a bit heavy. Overall, it's a sound beer, but not the best example of the style I've had."
"Pours dark dark brown almost black with lots of foamy head. Tiny bubbles indicative of TONS of carbonation. Conditioned in the bottle with champagne yeast so I guess this is not to be surprising. Smells chocolatey with a touch of bourbon. Sweeter than Black Chocolate Stout but not by much. The bourbon is far more subtle than I was expecting. Dry and chocolately on the tongue. Bourbon melds nicely. Certainly stronger than it smells. Thick but overly carbonated for me. Very drinkable though. a great sipper"
"I poured from a bomber(2010 vintage) into my Boulevard goblet. The pour is jet black, thin tan head, very light lacing. The aroma is full of bourbon, vanilla, alcohol. The firt sip is all bourbon, followed by some oak. It has a lingering alcohol feel to it. The body is full, carbonation light, and for a high ABV beer it is really drinkable. It is a great BA stout, yes pricey($20), but it is worth it."
"D- It was pretty drinkable, as it was pretty light for the style. It kept reminding me though how much I like the big body and flavor of Bourbon County."
"D - If I think about it as something else than a stout, its pleasant, but for the style it is off."
"Drinkability: One of these a night is enough."
"Edit: Opened a 2009 bottle on 3/4/12 to celebrate a few things with Goblinmunkey7. The body is more well-rounded than I remember, with a lot of malt and some warming bourbon. The aroma is not a ""5," though. Definitely a 4, right now, adjusting to 4.5 out of respect for my old memories."
"Very good beer that I would buy again."
"More of a sipper, but given the ABV and bourbon, it's acceptable. I like this one. Definitely way overpriced even at the $20 I found this bottle at. For that reason, I probably won't be getting my own bottle again unless I'm sharing it."
"This beer pours a nice black color, thin looking with a lighter than usual head for the style. the smell is roasty with hints of bourbon. the taste is weird, first off its very thin and over carbonated, it also has champagne like qualities due to the yeast used to carbonate it. drinkability is so so on this one, not my cup of tea"
"75cl bottle, number 3178 (I've seen this from a few reviews, must be a batch number), served in a snifter glass. Pours a pitch black with a decent, frothy tan head, lacing throughout. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, wood, an almost hint of soy-like aroma, vanilla, vinous, and bourbon. Flavor is roasted/burnt malt, chocolate, coffee, wood, alcohol, vanilla, and bourbon. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, warming, and bitter. Pretty damn good beer, nice and complex."
"D- Moderate. Tasty, but hot. Very enjoyable beer, but not in the elite class of b-bal stouts. Still worth checking out."
"Pours jet black with a dark brown head. Label says it was re-fermented with champagne yeast. I get the smell of champagne and taste of champagne right up front. If it weren't for the vanilla notes and pitch black color I'd feel like I'm drinking champagne. I taste no bourbon notes which is nice that's something you normally expect from a beer aged in bourbon barrels. It's very smooth and easily drinkable. I had to try this since I had their black chocolate a couple times and I'm glad I have."
"This one had a really nice bourbon/vanilla tone to it, really strong smell, and not a lot of head on the pour. It was pretty similar to the Great Lakes Blackout, but without as much barrel and caramel taste. Really good still, the taste lingered in your mouth keeping you wanting more. Good beer at a good time!"
"Overall this beer is decent but a bit unbalanced with too heavy of a barrel presence. The bourbon is nicely integrated and the ABV is well masked but I wish it was fuller bodied with more of a luscious chocolate malt profile."
"Pours a one finger brown head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Black color - no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is bourbon and oak, flavor is bourbon, some coffee and oak. The high ABV is hidden. Interesting imp stout but does it need to be $20.00 for a caged and corked 750ml bottle?? Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME. There's only 1000 cases of this."
"D: very tasty, I have have this many, many times over."
"I had heard there were only 1000 bottles made so Good Luck finding it."
"Pours a jet black with a nice tan head. Smell is amazing! Bourbon, spices and a subtle sweetness. Taste is creamy and thin bodied. Bold bourbon taste but it blends well with the chocolaty malt backbone. Great beer for those not into coffee. Very drinkable for the strength. Advise you to pick up a bottle if possible."
"D - While I usually split these bottles between a couple of friends, I could easily drink one by myself."
"The drinkability is very low for me. I'm sad to say, but I don't think I would buy this beer again. I wouldn't reject it if offered, but I most certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"D: An excellent sipper that I want to gulp; I'm glad to have held on to this until now."
"D - Dangerously drinkable for something over 11%. Alcohol is very well hidden behind some of the bolder flavors here. This is one I'll be sure to seek out again."
"D - This needs more time. This beer is already aged a year (plus), and still tastes crazy hot. Sooo boozy. I can see the where this might be headed, but it will probably take a few more years to get there. This beer would rate higher for me if the alcohol wasn't so overpowering."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. If not for the strange, distinct astringency in the nose and taste this would be a winner. The alcohol complements the flavors marvelously and everything comes together nicely to make it better than the sum of its parts. If not for the high price tag, I could see myself drinking this a few times during its release."
"Overall, I was happy to have tried this special brew. The big league price tag scared me a little but it is definitely a treat."
"D: Sunday afternoon, watching golf, fully expect to put the whole bottle down easily. One note, if you prefer a chocolatey RIS this may not be for you."
"All and all a solid beer. This would have to be cellared a little while to calm down the crazy amount of whiskey in it.I would have to question the 11.6% ABV. This just seems so much higher alcohol content."
"D - This is a BIG beer. Full on flavor and very assertive. I wouldn't recommend drinking more than a pint or so, though if you're into this kind of thing you could definitely finish the bottle on your own (I did)."
"Dark Black. Nice frothey head that sticks to the glass. Sugary and sweet smelling. Really like this beer. Perfect carbonation for a rich creamy beer. I could do a whole bottle of this myself. But, thankfully I had some help with this one. Really a wonderful beer and I really liked it."
"D: Really drinkable, tried this one directly after Victory Dark Intrigue, Black OPS was the clear winner."
"D: For an 11.6%ABV RIS it drinks spectacular. GREAT brew."
"This is very good fresh. I can imagine how good it would be aged."
"A really great beer. Glad I got to try it."
"D - Really great sipper with such a different feel and complexity for a barrel aged RIS. Looking forward to seeing how the rest of the case ages as I'm sure it just gets better."
"Drank this during the AFC Championship game, played for the right to lose to the Packers in 2 weeks. I'm glad I still have 2 more of these left, we'll see what they're like in December or 2011 and beyond."
"I'd love to try this again with a bit more time to mellow out as I believe this beer can only get better with age."
"Another Brooklyn that I would take a pass on."
"D-A sipping beer that tastes great. Although this beer comes with a high price tag it is more than worth at least one try. I'll try and buy more next year and try aging some."
"D - Decently high. I liked this one, but only once it warmed up a bit. When it was cold it was a bit awkward with that much bourbon and not much of the base flavors. Once it warmed up a bit you could finally smell and taste some of the other flavors that make this beer great. With such a high ABV you really can't drink a ton of this but it is good to have every now and then."
"Verdict: Black Ops would be a great beer without the qualities it picked up while aging, but those qualities transform it into a truly top-notch beer. As great as this is now, I cannot wait to see how it ages."
"D: I liked it but I didn't love it. I think I'll age my bottle of 2010 longer than this one and see how it turns out. Thanks again for hooking me up Josh!"
" I felt the beer was served at optimal temperature it opens up with loads of bourbon and woodiness and the vanilla is pretty high in the taste too. There is some dark cocoa and earthy bitter flavors that I associate with high cocoa content chocolate bars. The coffee in the flavor is like a smooth slightly roasted, not overoasted smokey bean, but the main accent of acidity is mild with hop flavor adding to the complexity. The taste is semi-dry from the bourbon barrel but the toffee and dark fruit flavors shine through the taste of alcohol which is relatively smooth for the strength. I enjoyed this wonderful stout. I remember having it the first year it was released, but did not have enough to justify a review. The bourbon is all over the flavor and the beer is pretty easy to drink in spite of it all. I enjoy the way the woodford reserve barrel was utilized adding just enough character to amplify the best attributes of the stout."
"Overall this is a great barrel ages stout in my opinion. My first barrel aged stout was an 11month old bottle of Goose Island BCBS which was way boozier at that age than Black Ops is at 3 months. Brooklyn has really seemed to achieve a great balance of bourbon and stout with this beer."
"D: OK."
"Wow. What a beer. Good enough to make me not regret the ridiculous price I paid for it at The Foodery."
"Salud!"
"D - It is quite drinkable and quite delicious, I however would really like to see how this ages and how the flavors develop over time."
"EDIT: The beer gets even better as it warms."
"(80)"
"Cheers!"
"The beer is slightly astringent on the tongue, but it works well with the complexity of it. All of the elements of this beer work in harmony, creating a very drinkable, delicious ale. If you can find it, pick up a bottle (or two, and save one for years to come)."
"D: Most drinkable stout I've had recently."
"750mL bottle into a tulip glass pours a deep opaque black with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is roasted malts with a hint of oak and Bourbon. The taste is a nice blend of roasted malts, vanilla, cherry, bitter cocoa and a hint of Bourbon. The beer is slightly heavy, but is surprisingly smooth and easy drinking. This is a very enjoyable barrel aged stout, far from the best, but quite respectable."
"Black OPS is a great beer that should only get better with age. A bit overpriced, but I'm glad I got to try it. Have to admit that I could just as happily have a Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, 12 bottles of which I could buy for the price of Black OPS."
"Magnum bottle, holding on to this for a year. Opened NYE to share with non-craft friends. Black and even pours thick. Light chocolate colored head. Smells amazing, bourbon and dark chocolate and vanilla. Tastes incredible. Super warming alcohol and chocolate up front with bourbon and vanilla on the end. Wow! Glad I waited and it was worth it. Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, thick and chewy. Dessert in a glass. Drinkability might be hindered by the high ABV but this is one RIS thats hard to put down. Bravo Brooklyn!"
"Poured into a snifter, this is a thick dark black with an inch of foamy head. Smell is a creamy, buttery mix of chocolate, bourbon, and rum. Taste is heavy on bourbon with whipped cream and chocolate. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is present, but masked fairly well. Worth trying."
"D: The beer tastes like it is strong, but is nowhere near an alcohol content of 11.6%."
"M/D: This Imperial Stout finishes much dryer than most other Bourbon Barrels, but still has a unique and complex flavor definitely worth checking out."
"Drinks very well, will make a perfect night cap for New Years Eve. With the flood of Bourbon Barrell Aged Stouts on the market, I see how this one could get lost in the mix. It is worth trying at least once, as it is a great example of the style from a more traditional American brewery."
"Notes: This beer is a little too oaky-bourbon and not enough stout. I'm not getting enough of the dark malty flavors that I love in a stout. I would have to be in the right mood to drink this again--a bourbon mood, as it really showcases some good bourbon tastes. I could also see it improving with a little age."
"D: Wow, what a disciplined, refined, and well crafted beer! I had a lot of high expectations about this thing due to its high price tag, but I think it was worth every penny!"
"D - Definitely a beer I will try to buy each year, I bought 2 bottles, one will be aging for a few years or months."
"if you can find this beer, buy it. dont let the price tag scare you, its worth it IMO."
"D/M: drinks smooth, incredible taste really makes it a joy to drink, slight carbonation tingle, overall I'm incredibly impressed"
"Overall a tasty beverage that is a little over hyped. Let it warm up and agitate some carbonation out and it really improves. Recommended."
"Not impressed. Not bad mind you, but really, in the end, its not worth the price and not worth the hassle to get(for a west coaster that is, maybe super easy to get for easterners)"
"Black Ops drinks like booze. It's heavy and uncomplicated -- a lot of bourbon with a little bit of beer. It improves impressively as it warms, but never reaches the smoothness or balance you'd expect from a $20+ bottle of beer."
"D-- Not at all what I expected. Very different. Good parts are that the bourbon is well hidden does have some good fruity qualities to this. Negative is the yeast. Too carbonated for me and this style. Big time sipper."
"Overall this was more complex a beer than I was expecting. My senses were instantly cut off by the alcohol flavors, which is a rarity for me, even in some of the high alcohol RISs. I returned to the beer after resting for a bit, and found a lot of different flavors on the tongue at once. It's no Kate, but it's nice to find something that doesn't lean towards chocolate milkshake either."
"A: Black Ops pours thick and result in a dense and tan head, there is a good deal of lacing that sticks to the sides of the glass like glue, dark brown to pitch black in color, a very nice looking beer - 4.50, S: The initial nose is strong with whisky and dark chocolates, I also pick up a slight medicinal aroma in addition to a bit of chalkiness, faint Tootsie Roll and burnt caramel, noticeable vanilla rounds out the nose, wonderful aroma all around - 4.50, T: My first impression reminds me of chocolate covered cherries that have been soaked in booze, there is a mild alcohol burn and some faint medicinal flavors, considerable dark fruits including sugared dates and prunes, extremely sweet and with a hint of licorice - 4.00, M: Though the mouth is quite creamy the body is a touch on the side of thin in my opinion - 3.50, D: All around a very nice beer and certainly an above average bourbon barrel aged beer - 4.25"
"This is great. The bourbon flavors do not overpower the beer. It is definitely one to try. It is very well balanced."
"I liked OPS much better this time around than the first time I bough it. Still, nothing justifies the $20 price tag. This is a very good beer, but no better than a $9 barrel-aged imperial stout."
"D: I found this easy to drink, all things considered. The alcohol has really faded. The beer was somewhat lacking from a mouthfeel standpoint though. I've got one more of this vintage to try in another year"
"D. It drinks almost like a dark champagne. The aroma is a bit misleading - the chocolate and coffee characteristics are much more prevalent than expected. Decent, but not great."
"I picked this up yesterday at Cambridge Wine and Spirits for about $24. A little steep price wise, but that is why it is a limited/special release. I also have loved other vintages of this brew, so I didn't mind throwing down for this. As expected, Black Ops comes out completely black, with about a finger of brown tan heading. The nose is deep with complexities. Rich, dark chocolate kicks things off, followed by hints of bourbon, earth, molasses, and some vanilla. Coffee, chocolate and vanilla flavors are the most dominant tastes here, along with brown bread, and dark stone fruit such as cherry and plum. The mouthfeel is the most extraordinary part of the experience. The body is thick as expected, but there is also an amazing carbonation that is almost reminiscent of champagne. That same superb mouthfeel can also be felt in Local 1 and 2. I tend to like big imperial stouts more slick and oily, but this is a definite exception, it works perfectly. The bourbon barrel aging is definitely noticeable, but does not deter from drinkability. In fact the alcohol heat is kept very much in control. It is hard to see Brooklyn outdoing themselves stout wise with the strength and quality of Black Chocolate Stout. But they have, and have made one of the best Imperial Stouts I have ever encountered. Truly a dark masterpiece."
"Conclusion: perhaps the best bourbon barrel aged stout I have ever had"
"Look forward to see what Brooklyn Brewery has up there sleeve next."
"D - Tastes a little heavy at first sip, but it becomes completely smooth and perfect for what it is afterwards. Is it worth $20 per bottle? Not in my opinion, but still worth trying once."
"D - This is a really tasty beer but man is it big and bold. A little to big and bold to not share this one."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV, 2-glasses in and still have an in-tact palate."
"More of a bourbon lovers beer than a stout lovers beer. Just too hot and boozy to consider this in the elite realm of barrel-aged stouts."
"Poured into a snifter with a jet black body, impossible to see any light through. Cascading, dense mocha color head that is nice and big with great retention for a brew this size. Smells of cocoa, vanilla, booze, coffee, and some spice. Incredible flavor! Tasted of chocolate fudge brownie batter upon first sip. Huge roasted coffee flavor with lots of raisin and vanilla. Oak, caramel and vanilla sweetness from the bourbon barrels, but not much booze (thankfully). Thick and viscous but nice and velvety body, decent carbonation. Very creamy, but still smooth and easy to drink. Drinks easy from a taste standpoint, and the booze isn't as overpowering as expected, but at nearly 12% it is still one to share with friends. Great job by Brooklyn, and I'm looking forward to the upcoming release!"
"(D)- Its showed promise, but this needs at least a few years before I would even touch it again. The boozy heat throws its weight around very much. Perhaps the booziest beer I have had. 11.6% ABV? It really feels more like 20%+"
"This is like velvet on my tongue."
"Price is usually expensive, typically in the $25-$35 range. A treat that is well worth it; just make sure you have an hour or so - it is definitely a 'slow sipper.'"
"Notes: I absolutely love the label and the whole image. Using the classic ""B" in the circle and appearing very sinister in your local purveyor's cabinet, Brooklyn Black OPS certainly looks the part. The appearance and smell even deliver but then much is left to be desired after that. After all, I am reviewing the beer and not the label!"
"OVERALL: A decent enough BA imperial stout, but nothing overly special and certainly not worth the hefty price tag. The champagne yeast is an interesting idea, but it's made the beer overly carbonated for the style, and has thinned out the body too much. Perhaps the same base beer done differently would yield better results. Regardless, I'm very glad I had the chance to try this one, but will not be seeking it out again. Thanks again for the awesome trade NYC!"
"Overall, although certainly not exploding with flavor, this one was still intensely pleasant, perhaps because of its subtlety. I would love to have another few bottles around, but it is a bit tough to justify at its high price."
"Pours an opaque black with a thin mocha head. Nose is bourbon, vanilla, roast, and dark chocolate. The bourbon really comes out in the flavor with some silky vanilla and hocolate in back. Fairly full body with a bit of heat. Quite tasty, but not worth he high price point."
"This may have been judged slightly harshly in comparison to some other beers tasted at the same time, but this really wasn't terribly drinkable or enjoyable thanks to the excess of bourbon and barrel."
"Very enjoyable beer. There are a few barrel aged stouts I would put ahead of Black Ops but it is certainly one of the better ones out there. Drinkability is relatively high, easy to enjoy a couple glasses in a sitting."
"The beer is well carbonated and full flavored, the finish is nice and dry. The alcohol is incorporated well into the flavors of the beer, it's a just a bit too sweet to get high marks for drinkability."
"As a youngster, this was a bitch, as a middle ager, she is very mellow, as she reaches maturity, it will be a world class stout."
"this aged wonderfully. not sure how much longer it could hold up for, maybe another year? alcohol was not over the top and this was delicious, i would love some more."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good, although the flavor profile of this beer can barely keep the ABV from rearing its head, especially in the finish."
"D - Overall a good solid beer, just not my favorite RIS. Too boozy and a little thin. The alcohol is not well hidden, which makes this a sipper."
"Much more balanced than GIBCBS and I'd rather have one of these than 3 GIBCBS. Well done Garrett!"
"I really like bourbon barrel beers, and this one is right up there. Pours black as night with a tan head that settles to a thin swirl. Smells beautifully of whiskey with some nice roastiness and some light oak. The taste starts with a nice hit of bourbon- long and mellow, perfectly balanced by the smooth roastiness and dark fruits of the stout. Smooth finish, silk in the mouth and not hot. Delicious- just wish they'd make more of it."
"A very well-crafted beer and a real pleasure."
"Brooklyn did a good job with the barrel-aging on this one; I find the integration very good. The champagne yeast adds something of an obscure aspect to the beer, but I reckon that's what keeps it interesting. I also think it's better while chilled. Personal preferences on carbonation aside, this is a really solid beer. The price of admission is kind of high, but worth shot."
"Pours black with a thin tan head. Smells are licorice, alcohol, some roasted malts but really mostly licorice. Tastes are booze, licorice, chocolate and more licorice. Mouthfeel is chewy with the right amount of carb. Drinkability is not much, split amongst 5 of us and that was good. It's a really good beer, but for the money you could buy 2 four packs of Breakfast Stout, Old Rasputin or Brooklyn Black Chicolate and be happier."
"Surprisingly thin, a bit of heat, but enjoyable. Would like another opportunity to linger over this."
"I was expecting a lot from this beer and came away very disappointed. The flavors completely fell flat in this beer, not really sure what to blame. I wanted a big bold stout, not a bland alcoholic mess. Too bad, definitely had potential considering the base is their excellent BCS."
"D - Subtle flavors but strong booze. Tasty but taxing."
"This is probably one of my favourite barrel-aged beers, and one of my favourite imperial stouts. Its crafted with that deft hand that garret oliver has, and its incredibly drinkable and worthy of a special occasion."
"The ABV is nowhere to be seen and my third of the bottle disappears all to quickly, it would not be a chore in any way to finish a bottle of this. I balked at the price tag on the 2nd release and now I am wishing perhaps I hadn't - this is a terrific beer!"
"D: Splitting the bottle with my girlfriend gave about the perfect amount for both of us. This beer is incredibly strong, and I can feel it most of the way through this snifter. Nice beer, but a little bigger body, and a little more from the base beer would help this out a ton. Probably wouldn't want to keep drinking this all night. I love bourbon, and I love stouts, the combination of the two is really a beautiful thing, however when they are mixed I really want the stout to shine with hints of bourbon and bourbon notes. Still not disappointed, this is a great beer, and I'm glad to get the chance to try it!"
"Overall I was hoping a little bit of time on this beer would help thicken it up but if anything I think the flavors have become even more muted than the first time I tried it and certainly isn't up to par with next year's version when relatively fresh. Worth a shot but the price tag is a bit much."
"D: This bad boy needs time. I'm not even sure if time would mellow it out too much more considering I let mine hang out for just past 6 months or so. Just a gigantic RIS overflowing with both sweet bourbon notes, as well as some bourbon heat. Easy does it with this one."
"Poured jet black with a finger of beige/brown head into a snifter; no visible carbonation (as expected), great retention, and even better lacing. The nose? Wow..dark chocolate, cocoa, currant, roasted malt, oak, caramel, coffee, and a hint of high alcohol content. The taste was a wonderfully balanced mix of all of the above through midpalate, and finishing with evidence of the alcohol content, and coffee/cocoa flavor afterwards. Thick and smooth; liquid velvet mouthfeel with no carbonation. Not a huge fan of the style, but I am a huge fan of this sipping beer. Again...wow."
"D- I was holding onto this for 7 months and looking to pop it around now, just waiting for the right time....sometimes it's as easy as bring told when the right time is. Given that the weather has been scorching lately, drinking this beer first thing in the morning seems very appropriate (stop judging). After having had the manhattan project and dark matter I can find many similar flavors and notes in this beer. I guess this was the 1st gen beer in those bourbon barrels. It's ol by me, because I really enjoyed those beers too. But I think the OG is the best of the bunch."
"Drinkability is very good, it was a very good tasting beer to sip on this evening. I didn't try it fresh but heard it was a little hot. After a year of aging I can say it wasn't hot at all and was pretty much exactly the way I enjoy my Bourbon stouts. My only criticism is that the base beer could have come through with a bit bolder flavor in both the nose and taste. Still a very good bourbon aged beer though."
"D- this is certainly a hot one. Definitely a sipper..."
"D: Could drink this any day of the week. Alcohol warmth is the only thing that detracts, making it difficult to drink a lot."
"Pours a gorgeous pitch black with a dark brown head. The scent is incredible - chocolate and coffee, but words don't do it justice. This is one of the best, if not the best scent for any beer I've ever smelled. The taste is a bit boozey, and of coffee, dark malts, and a subtle smokiness. Very tasty. This is the perfect mouthfeel for the style - creamy and full-bodied. This is the way every Imperial Stout should feel. Despite the ABV, I could easily get carried away drinking this great beer."
"This beer overall feels a little raw highly carbonated and very boozy without enough balance but still a very solid offering from Brooklyn brewery."
"Beer is medium bodied and pretty sweet. It has a strong liquor character to it and its nicely flavored with bourbon. Nice levels of carbonation on the palate and good drinkability. Its a big beer but it goes down smooth. Body is creamy and smooth. Finishes fine, not too dry. Overall a good beer."
"Drank this glass real fast. I could probably drink too much of this beer it goes down real easy. 4.5"
"D: Overall I think this could be a very dangerous beer. Tasty as hell and pretty potent. Very nice, but doesn't top some other beers in this style. Regardless this is a monster brew that is worth trying, and I only wish I had another bottle or two tucked away to try with a little age on it. le sigh."
"D- This was a hot beer for me. I think some aging should clear up some of the mouthfeel and flavor profile. I would like to try this again with at least a year of age on it. Will have to trade for and keep in the cellar."
"Reviewed from my notes of a bottle pour at the Great Lost Bear. I was served about 6 ounces in a tulip glass. The Black OPS came to me looking pitch black, with a brown foam head. It is fully opaque, not light gets through whatsoever. It looks like a near perfect stout, except that it had hardly any lacing. Maybe this was just my glass though. The aroma is full of malt and bourbon. I can detect alcohol, oak, and slight roasted malt notes. The bourbon aspect is the strongest thought, and nearly overpowers everything. It is equally strong in the flavor. I can taste it right away and it gets stronger after I swallow. Coffee bitterness and alcohol provide a sharp bite that sits behind the bourbon. It's a very good flavor, but it is very hot. I would love to try some with a year or more of age on the bottle. The beer is full bodied. It is a bit sweet and sticky, but less so than some other beers of this style. The carbonation is at a good level--I don't feel too much on my tongue, but ti will foam up if I swish it around my mouth. I find the Black OPS to be somewhat drinkable in its fresh form. The bourbon will be too strong for most drinkers. The big stout characteristics will be too much for others. If I opened a bottle, I would need to share it. Still, I think this beer is worth seeking out; I'm just not sure it is worth the hype. I think I prefer local bourbon aged stouts (such as the one put out by Sebago) more."
"2.0 D: I like bourbon barrel beers when the bourbon complements the beer. Unfortunately, the bourbon in this dominates the nose and taste instead of adding complexity to a tasty base stout. I'm sure people who like whiskey a lot will find this very appealling, but I'm not one of them."
"Awesome."
"D: I didn't care for this beer. I prefer something with a little more body, a little less heat, and much less roast. Not something I'd get again. Abyss is half the cost and I enjoy it a bit more."
"OPS is good beer. Is it worth the price? Well, I paid $13.33, or one-third of the total price, so I guess it was worth it for a one time purchase. But I can't see this getting a second chance from my wallet."
"D: This is good. At it's very expensive price though, I wanted to be wowed, and I was a little let down in that regard, but I still like Black Ops a lot. For the style, it's a very easy drinker."
"Drinkability - It went down very easy and was a pleasure to drink."
"Appreciate the trade to let me try this!"
"D-Hmmm....I was worried this one would be a bit hot--but NO! Tasty? YES! This is some damn good stuff. Looking to revisit this one after I let a bottle get a little age on it. Well done Brooklyn."
"This is definately a unique brew, I was glad I was finally able to cross this one off my list. However the $20 a bottle price tag will most likely prevent me from continuously seeking this out."
"Very smooth beer, quite nice to sit and sip. Well done and even the big bottle size and high ABV make this a nice beer."
"D-overall an extremely interesting beer it definately is one of a kind"
"Drinkability: As you can tell from my review, this beer was barrel aged and it wanted you to know that. Maybe not the in the nose, but clearly in the taste and mouthfeel. In the end, I'm glad I finally got to try Brooklyn's barrel aged R.I.S. Yeah it got boozy at times, but it's not a bad beer. Sometimes I think it was too young to open. Black OPS can't be found like some of Brooklyn's other beers, but it shouldn't be hard to track one down if you really want to try this beer. It's not a I know somebody who knows somebody who knows the brewmaster's mom rare beer."
"Drinkability? Not sure. I don't think you could drink more than a glass of two before your taste buds died off from flavor overload. Still, what a great way to burn your buds out. Truely fantastic beer. Great job, Brooklyn!"
"I have to say...thus far, I haven't been the biggest fan of Brooklyn Brewing's 750 ml bottle releases. Black Ops is the best one I've had, but it could be a little better. Personally, I think the bourbon flavor's just a tad too strong, and interferes with some of the other flavors. I'm also not sure that champagne yeast was the best choice. Perhaps that had some impact. Nonetheless, for a beer that actually doesn't exist, it's not too shabby. If you ever see a bottle (which you won't), pick it up."
"Sampled on May 8, 2010. I put this on a shelf for six months before opening it. The pour is inky black with a quick building frothy three inch brown head. The aroma explodes with chocolate, coffee, wood, and hard liquor. The mouthfeel is somewhat oily but bold in texture. Dark chocolate, spent coffee grinds, and hops are the main ingredients of the taste with a distinctive hard liquor shadow. At the end of it there is a kind of hot pepper like sensation. This is a very smooth and unique Russian Imperial stout."
"Highly recommended!!!"
"O: A very nice beer by Garrett Oliver and Co. Is very drinkable as I'm having no difficulty in putting back a bottle by myself, but I do wish that the alcohol was put in check a bit more and the carbonation toned down slightly."
"d - I thought this was a very good RIS. Lots of bourbon in the smell and taste which I find very enjoyable. Would love to have again."
"All in all, this was a good brew. Glad I got to try it. Definitely worth hunting down. Good example of a stout."
"Overall a bit too hot for my taste. Plenty of nice flavors going on just super boozy. I'm glad I had someone to share this with. It would have been a long night trying to polish off a whole bottle."
"The drinkability, in terms of flavor at least, is dangerously high for the ABV. A couple glasses will definitely sneak up on you. A truly big, indulgent beer. One to seek out."
"Notes from the 3rd beer in a tasting, generously presented by atremains. Pours as black as ops can be, dark brown head. Not much lacing but retains pretty well. I can't resist the greatness of a head this dark. Smell is booze. Straight up booze. I was pretty scared to sip this after a few whiffs of this beast. But, luckily, alcohol is much less present in the taste. Matter of fact is is quite hidden for 11.6% in my opinion. Lots of great tastes that don't always come out this much in a barrel-aged beer, such as dark chocolate, dark fruit and coffee. The oak really smooths things out overall. Mouthfeel is decent for a stout of this caliber, not very thick but nice and fluffy. The booze shows itself a bit more towards the end but is still quite hidden overall. I don't think I would pay the price it costs for a bottle, but this is really drinkable considering the style and alcohol content. I had a 8oz pour or so and I wanted more and could've drank it easily. This one surprised me."
"D: At nearly 12%, this is a strong beer that requires time to get through. I liked the complexity that emerged near the end of the glass."
"Last beer in a good tasting, reviewed from notes. 2009 bottle. Pours pitch black with a dark tan head that has decent retention. Thick lace is left at the top but as I drink the beer it stops leaving lacing. A cloud is present for a while but disappears as the beer does also. Smell is massive. Bourbon and alcohol notes sting the nostrils but die down after a bit. Lots of cocoa, dark roast malts and fruit (dark, cherries) come through and balance out the weakened bourbon and alcohol very well. Taste is amazing. A very well balanced blend of many great flavors. The cocoa comes through hugely with the slightly sour cherries. It tastes like a dessert. The bourbon, oak, alcohol, roast coffee and subtle vanilla taste great with the cocoa cherries. The booziness of this beer was surprisingly faint after the first few sniffs. The mouthfeel was good. It has a creamy and milky, a bit oily, medium-heavy body that has low carbonation. This suits the big flavors well. The alcohol is pretty warm but doesn't sting the tongue like other big beers I have had. A coat of warmth, cocoa and cherries stays on the tongue, as well as a bit of bourbon and oak. Drinkability... it is a big beer with great, balanced flavors. It is certainly not a session beer but I could down a bottle of it. The price is iffy but I am really satisfied with the stout and wood aged aspects of this beer. Really loved the fruit aspect."
" D- This beer does not have a lot of depth to the black malt itself but it has a very full rich flavor with a the chocolatey oaky flavor support the roasted inky black malt flavors. I didn't notice any quality that would be lead to the champagne yeast."
"Oh man, way to much alcohol for this to be enjoyable. This will be a chore to finish. Brooklyn Chocolate Stout is superior in every way."
"Was delicious on cask. Aromas were great. Lots of vanilla with some oak and bourbon as well. The appearance was essentially black with a little bit of deep red on the edges. The taste was much the same as the aroma with added sweetness and some chocolate. There is no hop character to speak of. The mouthfeel was silky smooth and keeps the taste of alcohol in the background. Very drinkable for a Russian imperial stout."
"Not quite as viscous as some others in the style. Carbonation is fine and fairly active. Although I did mention some heat earlier in the review I still find this very drinkable for what it is. Overall a solid beer that I'd likely buy again if it were on the shelves in my area."
"Excellent brew. I'd take another any time one falls into my lap."
"D: Drinkability was incredibly smooth and easy, an 11.6%abv that easily drank like a 6-7%, going down effortlessly and with pleasurable results. Even consumed in warm state 50F this beer still didn't reveal its high abv and was as smooth and silky as velvet and as easy as a girl on prom night to consume. This was a great drinking experience and worth every bit its price of admission at $25 a bomber , of which I would gladly scoop up more if I am so lucky to come across it."
"Drinkability is average. A glass of this is great(except the pricetag) with a meal, but otherwise I can't see myself drinking more than one."
"Some stores decided to price this at 45 to 50 dollars a bottle, which I consider pure exuberance compared to the sticker price of 20-25 dollars a bottle. Limited release that's for sure, but I got this bottle in Ohio for 25 versus the 45 dollar mark up. Pours from a corked and caged bottle that releases oak barrel effects of oak wood and soft notes of vanilla and whiskey barrel aging that I just can't get enough of in the nose. Aroma and flavor have ample loads of bourbon barrel aging, dark black malts bring alcohol infused whiskey barrel markings which burns the back of the throat. The rest of the flavor brings in dark malts and alcohol burn, a lot of bitter dark chocolate and burning beer barrel whiskey effects. Dark chocolate and burning alcohol can be quite the cloying flavor. Mouthfeel is dry bitterness from the dark chocolate with warming burning alcohol screaming out like whoa. Drinkability overall is too intense for a general public's flavor profile. It's just a bit too much for me and others in my drinking circle."
"Saving a 2008 and another 2009, we'll see how some age does it. I'm sure the carb will settle down and improve this even more."
"Since I cracked this open on a Sunday night I will be useless on Monday morning, as this beer is strong and has F'd me up. This is a nightcap beer to try with several other beer enthusiasts, not one to take down alone as I mistakenly did this evening. Overall it was a good beer experience that is meant to be enjoyed in small quantities (4-8 oz glasses). Worth trying this beer just to indulge in something that can kick your ass. I'm glad I tried it, but would not seek it out again."
"Just a gorgeous looking RIS. Almost looks ""chunky"" when poured. Jet black with a huge cocoa head on top. Would make a great ad for sure! Aroma is ok but not as big as I expected. Some dried fruit and dark espresso notes. Flavor screams of alcohol. Deep roasted grains and flavor. Figs,licorice and espresso. Too bad the alcohol gets in the way. Considering the BCS is roughly the same alcohol I am suprised how ""hot"" this is. Still huge flavor wise dont get me wrong. Nice residual dryness in the finish. Decent enough body-I was expecting a bit more ""umph"". Wouldnt call it thin by any means. A really, really good beer. Don't know if it lives up to the hype but well worth trying if possible. Looking forward to the other bottle in a few years."
"D - The alcohol is killing me. It's a really solid beer with serious potential with age but hot damn, the booziness is a bit ridiculous with it's young age. Close to difficult to drink but as a sipper, its ok."
"Taste is sweet and smooth, lighter body due to champagne yeast. Makes it very drinkable and slightly higher carbonation. There's some chocolate and smoke on the finish."
"A bit weak, but not bad."
"Either way, it's well worth a shot for just about everyone, regardless of preference. Highly recommended."
"D - Not overwhelmingly syrupy like other RISs (TenFity). Easy to drink, which I really like."
"Huge hotness detracts from drinkability but we'll see how it mellows out. Overall a great beer that could be legendary in a few years."
"Nice beer from Brooklyn, definitely think the nose was the highlight but tasted quite nice as well, would definitely try this one again if I came across it..."
"Mouthfeel - Smooth, creamy and full bodied with some carbonation"
"Poured into my Brooklyn short snifter, it appears black with no light shining through. Darkly tanned-brown head more than two fingers strong. Lace clings all over the glass. Nose is a strong blend of woodsy and smoked oak, bourbon, slight vanilla, coffee and chocolate. Bit of yeast is notes in the background. Taste is very bourbon forward with smoke, oak, bitter chocolate, coffee and traces of vanilla. Slight alcohol astringency and very warming finish. Surprisingly light mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good an clearly a sipper. Lingering taste left in the mouth of bitter chocolate, bourbon and oak. Really enjoyed this beer and was surprised at how strikingly different this is from the base beer in so many ways."
"The mouthfeel on this beer is the most interesting but it didn't throw me off that much. I like it's use of champagne yeast and bumping up the carbonation. But it leaves your mouth feeling a little watery. It makes for an interesting presentation though."
"Good gift from my buddy Jae. Always nice to check in on my partners in Brooklyn. Looks stunning, (out of the oversized wine glass,) cappacino head sits in the center like a dark, chaotic universe forming. Aroma reaks of vanilla booze cream, whiskey, wood, and oreos dunked in Grandads. So easy up front; light chocolate, coffee, custard, vanilla, pudding, and then ease into booze. It may be young, but it definitely hurts. Maturation is key with this one. An early serving leads to stomach twitches and bad breath. Im excited to hit this one up five years from now."
"Pours opaque in body with a coffee tinted head that dissipates quickly. An aroma that has me wondering who put the Jack Daniel's in the milk? Alcohol, cream, slight chocolate, and bourbon. Flavors of faint chocolate, booze, slight vanilla, plums, licorice, bourbon. Medium bodied brew with almost no carbonation. The whiskey aftertaste is a bit too strong for my liking but its rather drinkable for such a heavy beer. This beer is like a good novel that has a disappointing last chapter."
"D: One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had to date. If this wasn't $25 a bottle I'd buy it by the case. The ABV will sneak up on you though."
"I was not greatly impressed with this beer yes it was good but I was expecting a lot more."
"A pretty rich mouthfeel wtoh a soft and appealing carbonation."
"Overall impression: Hot and raw, yet still very enjoyable. This seems like a great candidate for cellaring. Would love to try this with a couple of years on it."
"M/D - A full bodied brew which as it warmed in my glass it seemed like it got better. Coffee beans, chocolate came through better. Still not a lot of hop flavor. I would love to have this brew again. I highly recommend purchasing or trading for this. A well done Russian imperial stout!"
"Definitely a raw brew, and could benefit from a year or two in the cellar. If the ethanol character where to mellow, this would be a fantastic brew, but for now it's sub-par. Thanks for the chance Dennis and Paul, I really look forward to trying this in the future!"
"-did not have a great time drinking this and i had to work hard to get through it. i feel like we need to hold onto the 2nd bottle for like 4 years to get some of the carbonation out of there. then it might be much more enjoyable. i kind of feel bad writing about it badly, but this is how i felt"
"Medium-full body. I thought the carbonation level was fine. This beer is an absolute mouth-coater. Slow sipper for sure. Really tasty beer from Brooklyn, but I think more subtlety from the barrel could potentially make this world-class."
"this potent brew will mellow it out to the point where it doesn't have to be served in a shot glass! ;)"
"Flavor is of thick, oily dark chocolate fudge, vinous with roasted malts and java. Charred earth and bourbon barrels compete with a spicy ethanol presence on the finish. The body is thick, but not as hefty as many other Imperial Stouts, likely a result of the champagne yeast re-fermentation. Black OPS has aged nicely, and I wish I had another bottle around to see how it does in a year or so. Excellent job, Brooklyn. Top notch beer."
"Drinkability: a beer to be enjoyed like a scotch, a heavy beer with many different influences which makes for an appreciable experience."
"A very good and robust stout that has a _strong_ bourbon presence. I would have wished for a fuller body but other than that this is a top notch brew if you're into bourbon-barrel-aged stouts."
"The beer poured black with a thin tan head. The aroma was of rich dark fruits. The taste was cherry with a nice alcohol bite, and the pleasantly medicinal quality of many fine RIS's. The feel was surprisingly light and dry. Just a very nice RIS, I love a lot of cherry and no real hop evidence."
"D- Good thing I have a few of these to age and see how they mellow. It's a little hot now but is a great sipper and would please a bourbon lover."
"D-this is a solid drink, it's a little hot but not too much at all, fresh and big. The bourbon barrel aging was done extremely well bringing out a good oaky vanilla taste with a solid bourbon base. The finish brings a nice sweetness to add complexity (but not overtly sweet like some RIS' go). It does lack a big roasted malt character up front; but, very well done!"
"Overall, I was very impressed with this beer. Brooklyn Brewery did a great job with the bourbon barrel aging. The woodiness and bourbon from the barrel was definitely present, but incorporated very well. This beer actually surprised me a bit with how good it was and I'll definitely have to see any more bottles are floating around. If not, I will be eagerly awaiting the next release of this great brew."
"It's a decent RIS overall. I'd wish for more bourbon and wood balance with the malt body, which maybe age would help. All in all, glad I tried it."
"D: I have had this one on a couple of occasions, the first time i enjoyed it, but since then I have been disappointed"
"Overall: Great beer, man I was impressed, The bourbon is present and is integrated well. I have another one that I intend to drink in around a year, so I'll make sure to update this review then."
"D- Not at all for the faint of heart. A fresher bottle such as this is really hot, really boozy and really big on bourbon. Share this bottle."
"D - Could drink this all night, despite the hefty abv. Very well done."
"D - if you like bourbon then you will like this. I do not so I do not. I do not like dissing this brew, but it is not my bag."
"The appearance is outstanding. The head built a massive, dark brown head. The retention is one of the best I've seen. The smell was loaded with coffee, butter scotch and bourbon alcohol. The taste is not impressive though. It is one-sided, full of wood, bourbon and a sour coffee with a high alcohol taste. The taste is below average making me rank it at 2.5. The feel is really good. This beer is at odds with itself. Not too thick but not thin. The feel is smooth but a harsh alcohol, wooden aftertaste quickly robs the pleasure of the feel. Considering what a big bitch this is(the beer), the drink is decent. But if this was a Raspy or Yeti, the drink would be lower."
"D - Very good, but not so sure its worth buying several bottles at $20 a piece."
"Exceptionally dark black with a mocha head. Smells of alcohol, reminding me of an aged scotch. Very complex and pleasant smell. Honestly the taste reminds me more of a nice scotch/bourbon than a beer. Obviously sweeter than a bourbon and I do taste a burnt sugar. Smooth mouthfeel, with nice carbonation that hits the back of the tongue. It's a nice beer once and a while, but obviously you're not having more than one."
"Got to try this in August of 2009 thanks to a friend who got it in a beer trade. The colour was as black as the night we had it, in the forested foothills of Mt. St. Helens! The aroma was reminiscent of Brach's caramels, toasty oak and dark sweet chocolate. On the palate, the CO2 was rather light but the flavours that followed were not! Loads of bittersweet chocolate, Scottish toffee, burnt brown sugar, Christmas cake with hard sauce and strong black coffee. What a treat!"
"Pours a deep, shiny obsidian, opaque, with a small brown head that fades into the darkness. The nose holds hints of anise, coffee, vanilla, and oak, with a slightly perceptible booziness. The taste follows suit, the oak and vanilla taking a stronger stance from within their dark confines, and a very slight sweetness creeping up from underneath, not unlike a rivulet running through a deep dark cave. Yes, he's heavy, but he's still my brother, and I will support him constantly (with my tongue, anyway). A fine, sturdy stout indeed!"
"Overall this is great. Like everything else I said, it depends on your feeling of bourbon. The bottle I had was heavy on the bourbon but you can tell it's a good imp stout underneath. Hard to drink in quantity for sure but definitely worth seeking out. I've put a couple in the cellar from when I bought this one too - some age would probably go quite well with this. Overall a very good beer and a worthy step up from BCS."
"D - As expected, this is a big, bold stout. The barrel aged qualities are readily apparent, yet they don't bludgeon the palate with Bourbon flavors the way one might expect. The whiskey character is restrained to the point that it works with and emphasizes certain aspects of the base beer without overpowering the underlying character. The aroma is fantastic, it is rich and complex and manages to hit all of the characteristics that one would expect from a Bourbon Barrel aged Imperial stout. The flavor reflects many of the characteristics that make the aroma so enjoyable, but it does not come together quite as well. The alcohol is somewhat hot and not particularly well hidden and the flavors come across as just a little bit disjointed. It is still an enjoyable beer to sip, but it seems like it has room to improve with age. Fortunately, I have a bottle of last years release sitting in my cellar; I am looking forward to seeing what a year has done to mature this beer."
"I guess with Black Ops I was preparing to be blown out of the water, so the overall experience ended up being surprisingly muted. This isn't boring in the slightest, it's just much more toned down than I've come to expect from the IRS/Bourbon craze. The problem is, at this stage, I don't really want toned down. I'm sure people would disagree, but I don't think an outrageous, boozy stout like Bourbon County loses anything in the way of subtle flavors and complexity. Maybe I've become desensitized if this qualifies as understated - but either way, when I'm going to drop a decent amount on a bomber of something rare, I want it to be exciting and explosive."
"Out of a bottle this RIS was a used-motor-oil-black color with one finger of head the color of stained wood. The retention as a collar was good and the lacing impressive, sliding down my glass in slick sheets. The aroma was dark and musty like a stone cellar packed with fermenting figs and plums. I'm not sure how appealing that sounds but it was indeed pleasant to me! The flavors were quite tasty! All the usual coffee, chocolate and tobacco notes one would hope for plus molasses, musty malt, earth and a bitter dry finish. And bourbon. Oh yes.... Can't miss the bourbon... Solid and balanced. The mouthfeel was rich and smooth, the body full and the carbonation appropriate. Not amazing but good for sure!"
"I have a 2008 vintage I'm sitting on, so I'll add the notes to this review when I eventually crack that one - I'd be interested to see how this is with some age on it."
"D- I could drink this all night! It is very filling and strong. But what a way to say goodbye to a night?! Very good beer that I consider a treat anyone would be lucky to get."
"Even mouthfeel, just a tad thin, a bit dry. Very flavorful and interesting beer, a great sipper in front of the fire on the coldest night of the year."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but nothing amazing. I shared this with a few other BAs and we all agreed it had more wine characteristics then bourbon flavors. I wouldn't want to spend another $22 on this one. It is good, but I expected better."
"Flavor is incredibly good. Sweet of chocolate and coffee. Surprisingly, a little hoppy on the back side. Thick mouthful, booze warming...malty, a little creamy vanilla. Great RIS!"
"One of those beers that just does it all right. Massive dark malt, with a touch of sorgum sweetness and the hint of bourbon vanilla. Not too much heat from the alcohol, but enougth to add a little spicyness. Swirling in the glass reveals an almost oily coating legs. Finish is surprisingly smooth. Deserving of its sougth-after status."
"Medium-plus body for the style, just a little boozy. Really enjoyable overall and drinkable for the style. Paired pretty nicely with a cigar."
"Notes: It is certainly not only over-hyped but painfully overpriced. Unless one is a great admirer or the subtle if persistent champagne edge for a bourbon stout this feels rightly undeserving. Mind you, it is pretty good, but not that good."
"Bourbon smell and flavors are front and center. I wouldn't be surprised if they added a little bit of straight bourbon to the brew. Malts are relatively sweet and only mildly smoked complementing the bourbon flavors. Very mildly hopped. Well-carbonated, but dies down quickly from the high alcohol. Surprisingly light mouthfeel considering it's pushing 11% ABV...texture is not at all syrupy. It goes down dangerously easily, so I'm giving this a high drinkability score. If you like bourbon, scotch, or whiskey, Brooklyn's Black Ops won't disappoint you."
"I was saving this beer for something, I don't remember what. Then, on my birthday, it was snowing so we didn't go out for dinner, and I decided what better time to have this beer. It was a great birthday treat. In a tulip glass it was black with a thick cocoa head. Great aroma: cocoa powder and sweet chocolate, coffee, and big bourbon. Taste fulfilled my expectations. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and bourbon. Warming in the mouth. Spectacular."
"drinkability: solid RIS as expected from Brooklyn. Ilike BCS better. this was too bourboned for me."
"Picked this up at the local craft beer store, the manager was nice enough to put one aside for me because he knew I would like it. Got this for a colleague as well, he was a huge fan of this beer too. This is an awesome!! beer, and I would highly recommend that y'all get your hands on a bottle before there all gone."
"Overall, I'd really like to try this with some age on it. I suspect that the alcohol would subside and the flavors would integrate better as a result. I was a bit disappointed with this fresh unfortunately but still a very solid offering nonetheless."
"D- This is one mean brew. Nice full rich flavor with a good punch of alcohol."
"Finally opening a bottle from the original 2008 batch. Its pitch black with a thick dark brown head. Aroma is full of sweet dark chocolate, vanilla, light fruits and the taste is similar -- sooo smooth! Bourbon and vanilla flavors are up front and really smooth out the taste. The alcohol is hardly noticeable in the taste, but I'm definitely feeling it. The carbonation is just right, and the feel is not too thick or syrupy, but definitely not any where near watery --- just right. This beer is extremely dark and smooth. This is how I like my stouts!"
"As I said before, the Brooklyn seems a bit on the raw side, while the Firestone is incredibly smooth, having been aged substantially longer than the Brooklyn's 4 months. The Firestone is also noticably sweeter, which I prefer, and seems more complex as well. Strangely, the Brooklyn's 11.6 ABV nearly got the best of me, while the Firestone's 12.0 was, simply, glorious."
"Cheers!"
"750ml caged and corked bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem, NH; split with BA CheckMate. Pours an opaque black body with a good inch of persistent light brown head. Bourbon, vanilla, coffee, date, and wood characterize the aroma. Bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, and fruit all comprise the flavor. A little boozy at the start, but the alcohol flavor takes a backseat after a few sips. Bourbon flavor stays fairly persistently though. Definitely a sipper, with the full rich body and low carbonation with the alcohol warming. Not that keen on bourbon myself - I've had bourbon barrel aged beers with much less bourbon character. The Champagne yeast brings an interesting fruitiness/vineousness to the table and dries it out nicely. I'd bet this would age amazingly, and I may just buy another bottle for that purpose. As it is now though, the beer is just a bit over-the-top for my taste."
"World class - tried to go slow on a 12 oz chalice pour but my taste buds kept screaming for more."
"Drinkability - I know some people have been complaining that this beer is hot, but I am hardly getting any heat that isn't to style or welcomed. Granted, I have been drinking a lot of scotch and whiskey recently so I might not notice it as much, but this beer did a very nice job of combining bourbon and RIS. Ultimately, this is a very well balanced and very solid beer."
"D- I split this bottle with kfsv034, and wouldnt have much more. Big bourbon flavor with not much else. But I still like it. Real gem, different but good."
"D- If you enjoy bourbon then you'll likely enjoy this beer fresh. I think that many people are confusing booze heat with the sheer bourbon flavor that this beer presents. I would not describe it as hot, it's just a potent brew with big flavors."
"Tastes like a bigger cousin of their Black Chocolate Stout. Certainly worth what I paid and you should check it out too."
"Still, it's worth trying. I'll be interested to see how the fresh batch compares."
"D: This started off very promising and really wore on us as we worked though the bottle. It actually seemed a little sloppy to us from the mid-way point on. I've been hanging onto this bottle for almost a year in hopes of smoothing it out. I can't imagine how rough this must have been when newly bottled. Definitely not worth the $."
"Update (1/6/12) just popped the most recent version and am loving it. the booziness is definitely there, but as the world of bourbon barrel aged stouts grows and grows, i've become more accustomed to these big brews (and this year seems a bit tamed back than the past few). this one remains a classic to me, but not the jewel that i once believed it to be. still a great beer, and probably in the top 5 or 10 BBA brews in my opinion. cheers to the local boys garret and team for doing it again!"
"Black OPS, mystique aside, floods my consciousness with memories of my grandfather smoking cigars in his study lined with books and dark wood paneling. All that he inspired in me returns in torrents of excitement. In one word, WOW! Thanks Brooklyn."
"4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4"
"Let it warm up. A much better drinking experience."
"at a few months (weeks?) old, its not as well-rounded as other bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts ive had. might be best after sitting for a bit. sit sit sit. sit for a bit. we will see! still good. for sure."
"Taste this beer is awesome choclate vanilla bourban lite hops i think american so what thin but drinkabilty is awesome dont really tase the etoh. I wish this beer wasn't some expesive 19.99 in new jersey. Placed another bottle in celler with my 2008 version will revisit next year with a vertical tasting."
"First sip was filled with dark chocolate and espresso. The oak and bourbon notes came through on the back end. A bit smoky aftertaste. Not very chewy, moderate carbonation.. It was a bit thinner than I expected."
"D: A great bourbon barrel aged stout. It doesn't quite match the elite bourbon barrel stouts like Black Tuesday or GI Bourbon County, but it's very good. With a year or two of age it might come close - it's still pretty hot right now. I'll cellar a few and find out!"
"Drinkability- look you can tell this is a well made beer but at this point at least its not extremely drinkable in any means, the alcohol is way to noticeable and heated to make this beer anywhere near the best of the stouts I have enjoyed, I will have to give my other bottle another review but for now this is not close to worth its silly price"
"I almost thought this would be too thin as it poured into my glass, but the mouthfeel is wonderfully soft and almost devoid of any carbonation. This beer is not for the novice drinker and although many reviewers think that this is for at least two people, it can be enjoyed solo with the right amount of time and patience. This is about the best dessert beer out there that's above the average dessert, in that the effervescence and subtle depth of this seem to hearken to the special occasions in life. Although New Year's is over, today was special because I finally got around to this and any beer aficionado would be wiser for seeking this out and expanding their horizons. This effort by Brooklyn does not disappoint!"
"In a few small sips, this became one of my top two or three imperial stouts. Simply amazing."
"Note: I was a little harder on this beer due to the price. You sell a bottle of beer for $25 for a 750ml bottle I expect it to be great, this was just good."
"Well this stout presented itself to me courtesy of my roommate. It did not disappoint. Well balanced bourbon mixed with hints of dark chocolate and burnt caramel. Thirty minutes in and a solid head still remains. Perfect compliment to an evening spent indoors away from a blizzard. This beer is filthy good."
"Enjoyed very much as an after dinner sipper."
"Drinkability is great - as with Champagne, it can go down quickly and probably dangerously hurt you the day after. Too bad this one only comes out once a year and is tough to find."
"D - Dangerously high drinkability for a beer that's 10.7% abv. The creaminess is mildly distracting, but the flavor profile makes up for it and then some. Overall, very enjoyable and very easy to drink."
"D: Maybe I should stop bothering with bourbon barrel beers. With a few exceptions, they haven't done much for me. At the very least, this needs about a year of aging to reach its potential."
"Pretty drinkable beer. It is definitely good, but I think it could be better."
"D: Great drinkability, and as is usually the case, any beer I share with friends always tastes better to me. Maybe its the smaller portion sizes, but I will definitely seek out the next batch that comes out."
"O: Little let-down. Not bad, just not explosive or exciting."
"Picked up a 2008 bottle last year and has been in the cellar since then. Thanks to braineater for the hook up. Last night, my wife and I celebrated two special occasions, so we finally opened it. Served at cellar temp. Poured into large stemmed glasses. Dark black color with a hint of brown. Huge leather color head. Smell of bourbon right off the top. A wonderful symphony of flavor. Chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla all combine into an ultra-flavorful stout. Perfect mouthfeel, as it was just thick enough but smooth as heck. With a beer this flavorful, and the abv over 10%, it's a sipper for sure. Excellent RIS, and I am glad that I was able to purchase one. I hear the 2009 batch is now in the barrels, and I would recommend seeking a bottle out."
"****NOTES****This has been sitting in my cellar for about 4 months now and I believe it was not for the best. I shall say I expected more from the flavor and was kind of weak compared to other high end stouts. I would drink this one fresh and compare."
"Pours pitch black with a milk chocolate head. Nice fluffy lacing. Aroma is very chocolatey with a red fruitiness. Not much bourbon at all here, which is sort of refreshing. Flavor is somehow not roasty at all. There are coffee notes but none of the roasted bitterness that usually accompanies it. Chocolate syrup and dark chocolate notes with a oakiness and subtle bourbon. Doesn't taste as big as it is, which is a bit of a downside."
"Drinkability: The yeast adds a great depth to this brew on many levels. It's my favorite Brooklyn beer, and their best. The price is slightly high at $20, but it's worth it for a bottle. You can sip on the thing for hours, and it really is a wild experience. Plus, the buzz is one of those amazingly euphoric ones that's hard to find. Wouldn't mind getting another bottle to cellar and see what happens, if I can find it again. Don't miss out if you see it around."
"After drinking this I thought, ""I feel special."""
"D: A modest fusel burn, but not much of a deterrent todrinkability. Good roasted flavor, with a complex nose and flavors to match. Glad to have held onto one to try after the initial tasting months ago...what was probably a 4.1-4.2 beer then has evolved, improved. Strong recommendation for drinking the 2008 now."
"I definitely wish that I didn't wait quite as long aging this one (roughly 11 months), but I will be interested to crack my final remaining bottle side by side with the 2009 release coming out next month to get a better comparison."
"Been a little while since I've been moved to put down notes on a beer, but as soon as I popped this one and the coffee, chocolate, and bourbon nose began to waft through the room I figured this one will be worth remembering. This has some really nice earthiness and spice on the nose as well. Sits pitch black in the glass, with a chocolate milk head that sticks around and leaves some lacing. My one worry with this beer was that the bourbon flavor would overpower everything else, as it has with most bourbon barrel aged beers I've tasted, but here it is in fine balance with chocolate, coffee and anise. The mouthfeel is intensely creamy, though not nearly as rich as most stouts of this type, with lively but fine and delicate carbonation - the champagne yeast is an interesting and welcome twist. There is a nice warming sensation, akin to, surprise surprise, a smooth whiskey. This is quite good, and it has some unique and interesting qualities."
"Mouthfeel is medium to medium-full, a bit too much prickle in the carbonation in my opinion. Drinkability is rather low simply because of the harsh woodiness. 8 oz. would make a good nightcap, too bad the bomber is 26. Share this."
"Poured a jet black with good carbonation and nice brown head. Nose is smooth ut subdued bourbon and vanilla. Taste is light bourbon, oak, vanilla and very faint cocoa with a very light roastiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy very misleading on the ABV here, you would never suspect this brew is 10% ABV. Outstanding RIS!"
"Pours opaque oily black with a small island is brown foam left. Boozy nose with with some decent roast and chocolate character. The flavor is mostly just hot with booze and tannic with oak. I find this to be very thin and prickly. I can see why most people like this one, and I certainly don't hate it. I just prefer a richer beer for an imperial stout."
"In the intensity of the expression of the barrel character, this beer reminds me of the most recent vintage of the BA Speedway. Unfortunately, the base beer isn't as phenomenal, a beer with a barrel character this big deserves a slightly richer beer. All told, I have no regrets with this pricey purchase."
"I had big hopes for this beer, but it just seems lacking in several areas. Especially compared to some other BBA Stouts like BCS and KBS. And that's not even factoring the $20+ price tag. Maybe some age will do this beer some good. I've got several bottles to lay down and plan on re-visiting it down the road."
"Kind of disappointing. This is a rather flat tasting brew."
"Mouthfeel: medium bodied, with minimal carbonation and sikly smooth. Drinkability: I would definitely have this again despite the abv and if you haven't tried it you need to try it. Enough said."
"Flavors of big dark chocolate with hints of sweetness and big coffee/dark chocolate flavors with espresso bean finish and just a hint of ""bitter."" Very drinkable. Very good. Yes, I do want more and I'll drink it. However, this is not the ""holy grail"" of this style and type of brew. Just my opinion. (And, again...I'm happy to drink it with anyone, anytime!)"
"D - Drinkability is good for a 10.7% brew. Complexity is on target for a great example of the style. Given the abv, the limit is one. This is easily good enough to buy again and again though. The Champagne yeast is evident and kind of throws it off but that seems to correct itself as it warms. Brooklyn Brewery has a real winner on it's hands with the Black OPS."
"J"
"the mouthfeel is pretty ridiculously bad for an imperial stout. WAAAY too much carbonation (champagne yeast) that makes it similar to champagne (liquid turns to exploding bubbles upon contact with the tongue, which makes it very thin and rather unpleasant). again, not a good mouthfeel for an imperial stout that should be thick and chewy. drinkability is okay, but this beer should be enjoyed with others and on special occasions."
"While I do have a few bottles of this tucked away for future winters, I'm looking forward to a fresh batch of the '09 Black Ops. Oh, and did I mention...wow? Good."
"Personally: My tastebuds and I can not get into bourbon infused, super powerful 10W-30 strength imperial stouts."
"I dont quite know what to think about this brew. it has most of the aspects of an ris, but then again, it lacks so much in other regions. its good, i guess, but then again it is missing things that i consider to be fundamental to the ris style."
"Super pricey stuff...I suppose the rareness makes it worth the price."
"This is one of the examples of an RIS I've ever had. Highly drinkable, but the ABV can creep up on you."
"All things considered, this beer will be an A or A+ once the oak astringency fades to manageable levels."
"Doesn't live up to its name, more like having a couple of flash-bangs thrown in your bedroom & having the 75th Ranger Regiment rush ya!"
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head recedes sedately, with average lacing. Aroma is anise, dark grain, and alcohol. Taste with hearty dark sweetness, some anise and a peek of dark fruitiness in the middle, and closes with a big bonk of alcohol coupled with some coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with excellent drinkability for the style. The alcohol presence, although heavy, is complementary and not harsh at all. Great stuff."
"D - You see, I don't give out too many 5s. But this is truly an exceptional beer, and the best Russian Imperial Stout I've yet tried. This brew is the kind that leaves you licking your teeth trying to glean the last bit of flavor from each sip. I can only imagine how amazing this will taste with a few years' time down in the cellar. Go and find yourself a bottle."
"After having a few other barrel aged RIS in the last few days, I have to say I'm a little disappointed with the Black OPS. I think the appearance and smell really were steps ahead of the flavor. The champagne yeast adds an interesting dimension, and I think it helps the existing flavor profile of the beer. I don't think I'd like it in most cases though. Had the flavor been more like the smell, I think this would be one of my favorite beers ever."
"Brooklyn Black Ops is a fine effort and is a beer that I'll enjoy to the final bourbon-soaked ounce. That said, this basic blueprint has been done better by other craft brewers. I still think Brooklyn Lager is their best and most drinkable beer."
"This is well carbonated with over four fingers of sexy dark chocolate brown head. This head turns rocky and caverns as the head very slowly fades. Body of the beer is cats eye black and as thick as old ink. A bit of up front alcohol is noticeable on the nose followed quickly by roasted coco, and even some dark black cherry tones. This beer carries a nice carbonation level as it flows over the tongue. Very much like blackness in the taste profile with exceptional black chocolate tones along with smooth dryness and a bitter feel that is long and consistent through the palate. Really a lot going on here for such a big dark stout. There is even a hint of banana bread like sweetness that peeks out as you drink. Mouthfeel is very full and bold yet dry and pleasant. As big stouts go this is wonderfully drinkable."
"D: A good beer. Not a bourbon monster. Instead, it's quite well balanced and showcases a happy marriage between imperial stout flavors and subtle bourbon notes."
"A good beer. Would work well with chocolate covered fruit for dessert. Champagne yeast is a interesting twist on the style. A bit pricey, but worth splitting the cost."
"D: Excellent for a beer of this strength."
"split a 750 of this (rumored) beer the other night with my absolute favorite bartender, who always recommends a good beer for whatever my mood is. I have a serious love for imperial stouts, and this definitely measured up. Pours so so black with a nice, creamy tan head, and smells dark and roasted. The flavors are classic chocolate, malt, and coffee, but the sweetness is tempered by the alcoholic and barrel-aged essences so the beer feels less like a dessert than some others in this style. Drinks really well, not too thick in the mouth, but it's not deceptive- you can taste the powerful abv, and it wouldn't be easy to chug. A nice, cool and quiet night beer, and a good bit better than most of Brooklyn's offerings. Too bad it's only an urban legend ;)"
"This was nice. Excellent blend of flavors here, between the Imperial Stout and barrel notes, even if the heavy ABV held back the feel and drinkibility a bit. This was a pleasant sipper. Reminded me a bit of Deschutes The Abyss with a yeasty kick to it."
"It's easily drinkable, and the beer is focused and the Bourbon is kept in check. It's like an Imperial Russian with just a little bit of extra character. I'd personally like more malt, but I've had some English examples that have had less (Le Coq from Harvey & Son comes to mind). Worth trying, but it's a limited release."
"I never actively sought this beer out, but I'm very happy the beer fell into my lap as part of a larger trade. This is an excellent and very enjoyable Bourbon Russian Imperial Stout. This is highly recommended. Seek it out."
"Drinkability: A good, enjoyable stout as it stands now, though I feel some time carefully tucked away in the cellar would do nothing but benefit it."
"750 from HimerMan in No BS 4, split with dirtylou post Camera Obscura at 9:30"
"drinkability; sipper"
"hmm... not what i expected at all. what is with the acidity? my brother's glass was the same way. we were served at different intervals, so there's also a good chance it was from two separate bottles."
"[1x]"
"D - Excellent bourbon barrel aged RIS with a wonderful blend of vanilla, chocolate and bourbon, but also an unexpected roastiness that was a surprise. This was not as hot as I had anticipated, which really enhanced the overall drinkability."
"D - Pretty nice beer. The hype made me expect more, but by itself, pretty tastyl."
"Well done Mr. Oliver!"
"It's a very nice cool evening sipper and I can't wait to see what a year or two does to the other bottle I have left."
"This is extremely drinkable. Although I can't find the 10.7%ABV in the taste, I am starting to feel it, at a little past the halfway point in this 750ML bottle. So, maybe it would be more drinkable if it's being shared."
"With all of the flavors playing nice in the sandbox, this is a damn fine drinking bourbon aged stout. Scary drinkable."
"Overall: The mouth feel is rich, small carbonation bubble, creamy, and smooth. The body of the beer is thick, chewy, and dense. The finish of the beer is full. This beer is well rounded, very well made, and very good. The head has retention and leaves lacing on the glass. The aging on the beer is perfect. This is why I love RIS."
"That's my story and I'm sticking with it. Beyond that, I have no comment, Senator."
"Also, a great beer for my 100th rating on BA!"
"I'd be curious to see how it cellars, though I'm not sure it's a good idea. The flavors might integrate more, but I'm not entirely sure that would be a good thing as the balance is, to my palate, perfect at the moment. Still, I might stow a bottle or two away for the future, assuming this will never become a regular production item."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: Some folks may not like the bourbon character of this beer its boozey. Frankly I think it added alot to the beer. The body of the beer is on the plus side of medium. Carbonation is light but perfect for this beer. The alcohol in the mouthfeel may die down with some cellaring. But I think the beer may not be as satisfying in character. This is an excellent beer treat. This is all the promises of bourbon barrel aging put paid. I am really not certain this beer could be improved upon."
"Drinkability: A very different take on the style - a thinner body and more overwhelming bourbon and wood flavors than others of this style; I have tasted this one young and when it has matured a bit and would recommend cellaring it for some time as it is too one-dimensional when young"
"Feel and Drinkability: Heavy on the palate with some prickly delicate carbonation. Level of carbonation is low as befits the style, but I like that the carbonaion is prickly, it helps this one. This beer is so big that were the carbonation soft after the first few sips you'd still enjoy the beer, but would be missing out on the subtle intricacies that make this one wonderful. And perhaps they're not even intricacies, perhaps they really are foreground....but this is a big beer and it tends to overwhelm the palate. Prickly carbonation helps to cleanse the palate and get it ready for the next sip, trying to give every sip the same experience as the first. However, this prickleyness doesn't seem to be enough, its still just to big and full, the palate gets overwhelmed...that is my only complaint on this beer, that each sip is less satisfying than the first because it becomes harder and harder to taste the small things and maybe even some of the big things that make this awesome. After a while it comes down to alcohol, burnt and roasted. Its just too damn good. I love this beer, and really wish that I could get another bottle, I'm really happy that I didn't trade this mother away! Too bad I'll prolly never be able to find it again, thats a complaint against drinkabilty, too exclusive and rare...but supply and demand...I guess that makes this bottle even more special. I'll definitely enjoy this brew and be more than happy to finish it...I think I'll drink the rest in about an hour after my palate has had some time to recover so I'll be able to get that initial shock again. Just awesome!"
"D: Much better and smoother than it was fresh. A very nice example of a style that I think relies too much on the bourbon barrel. I have had this and Dark Matter and I must say Brooklyn knows how to use a barrel."
"Poured into a Darkness glass. Huge dark brown wonderful head with incredible small bubble retention. One of the nicest looking dark RIS I have come across. Black as fricking midnight. Light...yeah, what light. There was none. Wonderful lacing stuck to the side of the glass as it was consumed. Smell was very heavy on the bourbon side. Alcohol was also very present. Very nice touch. A wonderful burnt aroma was noticed as the beer was swirled. Taste was of alcohol, bourbon, burnt carmel, molassas, some chocolate, burnt marshmallows....very very nice. Again, the alcohol was very present. I do like most of my RIS to have a thick mouthfeel, something that is going to stick to everything. (Hello Bell's Expedition...probably the thickest RIS there is...at least that I have had.) This is where this beer lacked a little definition. Somewhat thin. Keith and I talked about this. Great taste but just a little too thin for this type of beer. I also gave this beer a lower rating on it being only in a 750 ml bottle. This big of a beer needs to either be shared with someone or to be packaged in a 12 ounce standard bottle. Too much beer for just one person at any given sitting. Overall, a very strong Bourbon Barrel Russian Imperial Stout. Thanks again Keith for sharing this one."
"A million thanks to knifestyles for this amazing EXTRA!! Very dark brown as it pours, jet black in the glass with a nice creamed coffee colored head that left some light lacing. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malts, a hint of smoke and charcoal, a touch of fruitiness, light coffee, and a nice whiff of alcohol on the tail end. Taste is mostly dark bitter chocolate, backed up by some coffee, a nice roastiness, a touch of bourbon and oak on the finish. The chocolate flavor is much like the chocolate dipped cones from Dairy Queen. YUM. Very nice, extremely well balanced, gets better and more complex as it warms. Creamy mouthfeel, but a tad light. I've still yet to find a mouthfeel that can come close to something like Expedition, but this adequate enough. Alcohol is slightly warming, but I'm finding this pretty easy to drink. An all around exceptional brew and would love to have another bottle of this to age for a year or too. Oh well, I'm happy just to have this one and am very happy to have had the chance to try it. Thanks again, Chris!"
"Pours a solid black color with a huge fluffy tan head that stays around forever. Leaves lots of lace all over my glass. Smells of bourbon right off. Chocolate and roast and some vanilla hidden behind that smell o' Kentucky. Brown sugar and caramel in there as well. Taste starts with a bitter roast and chocolate, some higher alcohols and then a bourbon vanilla finish with a lingering alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is creamy, body is thick, carbonation is a little high, but acceptable. Great Bourbon barrel aged Imp Stout. Its a little hot at times. I wish I could afford to see how this one ages, but at 24.99 its one and done."
"Overall, this beer was good, but not one of the better Imperial Stouts that I have had. Worth a try though for sure."
"D- I've only shared a couple of bottles and I'm not sure if I'd be able to drink a whole bottle but I'd be willing to try..."
"Drinkability-High ABV and huge flavor make this a sipper to be had with a fine cigar and shared with a friend. Far too much for me in a single session."
"Drinkability: Good, but not great. Nice, chocolatey-milk flavor, but I think there are examples out there with less hype and more substance."
"Bottle courtesy of Secret Santa: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a super large dark brown foamy head with great retention and great lacing. Aroma of bourbon and sweet malt is interesting though bourbon is more dominating then I had expected. Taste is also dominated by bourbon with some notes of alcohol and very subtle sweet roasted malt. Body is full with somewhat creamy texture with great carbonation and some alcohol is apparent. Good though a bit too much alcohol was apparent for my taste."
"The lighter body helps the drinkability though"
"D: Damn good stuff that I don't see myself getting sick of"
"cheers."
"This beer is high on the ABV and does have a nice kick to it. It does have a nice full flavor that is not too tough on the palete."
"Drinkability - I may yet kick that taste up to a 5 if the flavors develop well with some cellaring. The bourbon is bold and hot at times, but not entirely out of place or unenjoyable that way. However, I see potential for this beer to come together on all fronts with some good melding. Stellar."
"Drinkability is high. For the ABV, it's crazy drinkable. The alcohol is hidden well and the flavor profile is pleasing. A real winner in my book."
"the drinkability is good. it's a little something different, with a lot going on, and one things for sure the 11% abv is incredibly well hidden."
"This is quite good. As it warmth alot of the sweetness drops out. This is no chugger, although its drinkability is high, its definatly a sipper. My taste buds were annihilated after the huge oaky bourbon chocolate explosion. The creamy textures and champagne yeasted carbonation is super elite in this brew. Definatly loved it!"
"Very dark brown, pretty much black on the pour. Decent inch of tan head forms on the pour. Smell is slight bourbon, and a good amount of heavily roasted malts. Flavor is initially roasted malts, almost a coffee ground like burnt flavor. Then on the second half you get the bourbon barrel flavors on the finish. Very interesting twist. The bourbon flavors are not dominant, but there's just enough there to remind you that it is there. Amazingly not a whole lot of influence by the high ABV on this one. It's hidden very well. I was initially worried about the repitching with champagne yeast during bottling. Didn't want an overly bubbly, carbonated, barrel aged beer. But again, it wasn't that highly carbonated and had a nice mouthfeel. Well done."
"Edit: This beer really needs to age! Above review is for a green beer, 2008 served in early 2009. After a year in the bottle it is simply fantastic! Body filled in, taste got better and bigger. Revised my review from a B- to a high A."
"Overall, I'm glad I was only charged 17-18 bucks for this one (because it's more expensive elsewhere in the country) but it wasn't nearly worth that kind of money. Decent beer, but I personally think this is a major pass considering the price point."
"D: I would totally drink drink a bottle of this by myself. I would try a second bottle but I might need some help half way through."
"D - It's a good beer. Expensive, but a good beer."
"Let it warm up. A much better drinking experience."
"Overall, this was a solid brew. The depth of flavor was not as great as other bourbon aged stouts I've tried which cost less. But nonetheless, it was a fine beer."
"M/D- viscous, but easy to drink. Way too easy to drink. There's no astringency here, the flavors meld so well and give you a great complex beer."
"I love Garrett and I enjoy most of his brews, but this one turned out to be a real mess. This beer has an edge so raw and so sharp that it is practically undrinkable as is. My advice to those that already have a bottle in their possession: Leave it in the cellar for at least a year or two and cross your fingers you when you do decide to open it."
"Overall a great and unique beer from Brooklynn. Not the classic that BBCS is, but a totally different kind of stout. The unique yeast (for the style) is also very interesting. Im excited to see how this one does with some age. I think it will be a good cellar candidate. Defenitely an overpriced beer, IMO, but a good one too. Give it a shot to find out if its worth the price tag for you."
"Overall, a great beer. Is it a $20 beer? I'm not sure. Drinkability suffers due to price and the alcohol content. Still a darn good beer though."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Wish I had more. Although I don't know how many I'd buy at the $20+ price tag."
"Bottle batch 3178 received in trade(thanks kiefdog). Poured into pint glass, pours jet black with three fingers of dark tan head. Tons of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is very bourbon like with hints of chocolate. Taste is chocolatey and smooth with a hint of bourbon in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is fairly light and a little dry. Drinkability is great but is hindered only by the alcohol and the slight bourbon taste. Overall an amazing stout that I would love to drink more often if it was locally available. This is in my top 3 favorite stouts easily. A great brew from Brooklyn Brewing."
"Very drinkable for over 10% abv"
"At $25 this was an awesome overpriced RIS that im glad I tried but wont drop the duckets on again. I guess in these tough economic times every brewery needs a product to bring in cash."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a really nice oak scent that really compliments the black and chocolate malts. The taste is perfect. It has an exceptionly smooth black and chocolate malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a wonderful bourban taste. The mouthfeel is also perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is damn good beer. The best Brooklyn has ever produced IMO. It's complex, yet very easy drinking. Great Job G.O.!"
"this beer pours a dark black, with a tan head that cascades into a rocky foam leaving sticky lace down the side of the glass. the aroma brings the bourbon right to the nose with a bit of sweet malt to back it up. the taste has a bit of alcohol right up front with a lot of malt character and some astringency from the roasted malts... this is a delicious beer with a lot of character the full body and good carbonation make it a great beer."
"Drinkability: This is one unique brew. Doesn't taste like any other RIS out there (that I've tried anyway). I went through the first half of my glass fast, and I'm definitely feeling it. This is a sipper, but I'm not treating it as such. I guess to sum it all up I'll say, ""You can go through one of these fast, but you really, really shouldn't."" Fucking addictive - there must be crack in it."
"Lucky to find a bottle of this at a local bar. Thick blackness in a glass with a nice fluff of brown head which sticks around for a while. This is a complex stout. I love that it has so much going on - barrel aging, champagne yeast, bottle conditioned... nuts. It really contributes to the overall character and depth of the beer. I tend to think a lot of these big stouts tend to fall short and taste too flavored of coffee or chocolate or booze. Not so much this one. The chocolate malt and dark fruits are there, but there is an extra deep leathery taste that brings this beer together. It's long on the palate - take a nice big inhale while drinking to get a wide array of flavors. So so soft. But bold."
"Beer is black, with a very small head. There are notes of raisins and prunes along with some chocolate and vanilla. A slightly winelike qualty. Flavors are similar. Here is the deal - for me, this beer was almost porter-like. Body was week as was the mouthfeel. Not terribly complex. Not at all a bad beer. Am I biased in my review because of the price? I would have to say yes - but I cannot help it. Simply put, the beer comes nowhere close to measuring up to its price tag, nor is it in the same ballpark as other highly rated RISs."
"I can't wait to see what age does to this."
"Remind me one more time...what's the diff between RIS and an American Double Stout? Pours an opaque darkness with better than a two finger stiff dark brown collar that fades slowly to spotty patterns of Belgian lacing, typical of a high ABV beverage. The smell of the residual bottling effort at the neck from beneath the cork and cage is all about the malty and silky smooth chocolate, with tangy and not so subtle hints of alcohol that linger appropriately. The marriage of the mouth and the flavors are truly wonderful. It reminds me a lot of Foothills Sexual Chocolate (monster monk in action). Drinkability...total package ""5"..ok...i said it. Have fun with this one!! Highly Recommend."
"D - this is a descent brew, but should age tremendously. Luckily I have another one coming so I can sit on it for awhile."
"Truly an exceptional beer. Enormous flavors: bitter chocolate, coffee, cream, with a sweetness that is not cloying. I think this is due to the cleaner than expected finish. Perhaps the champagne yeast does this? Whatever, this is a big bruiser of a beer that has layers upon layers. Only the ABV and the price keep me from guzzling it down like so much water."
"D: One of the more drinkable bourbon RISs ... the key for me was the delicate use of the bourbon barrel aging... this didnt feel like it was beer mixed with jack and coke... get your hands on one before its gone"
"The mouthfeel is creamy with a good amount of carbonation. The drinkability is also good, I could drink this quite often were it not for the price. Overall, this beer was worth buying but I probably will not be buying it again."
"The verdict on this is: ""eh."" This was clearly better via the special cask version a lot of us N'yawkas experienced previous to the official release. It seems like the hype was laid out to juice the anticipation of the bottle release, and it looks like it worked. It's a shame you'll probably never get to taste the pre-bottle-release cask version."
"Your basic black stout, no real edges to be seen, with a thick cap of dense mocha foam. Chunky lacing, great head retention. Roasty, burnt aroma, hints of charcoal, with the sweet caramel notes and light booze of bourbon up front. Chocolate and sour cherry aromas were more restrained, as were the faint hints of higher alcohols and brown sugar. Moderate bitterness overall with a solid sweetness throughout. Caramel and chocolate melded nicely with nuts and roast up front, bourbon and alcohol supported the flavour at the end. Dry, malty texture mid-palate with some oaky astringency in the finish. Pleasant warmth. Lingering toffee and rich maltiness. Full bodied with carbonation a little on the low side, very smooth. Quite good overall. This is a beer that seems like it would age nicely."
"I think this needs more age to be put in proper context. Right now it is not thrilling me, and at $20 a bottle... it should."
"This is a very nice stout from Brooklyn Brewing."
"Overall: solid big ass beer"
"Well worth the $20 and wait. Will definitely buy again next year."
"D: Makes the cask beer seem bad."
"If there is a downside, it's the mouthfeel. While decently thick, this is not a superlative motor oil consistency that you'd get from a few other stouts out there."
"D - I'm admittedly going to finish this bottle alone, with the single negating factor being sheer alcohol content. This beer reminds me of the concept of a multivitamin - hear me out... with incredible strength, depth, and density, all compacted into one seemingly unimposing and deceivingly benign sip. Simply, for a beer this large to drink in flavor and feel so easily is rather impressive. It ought not to be so drinkable, and I'll score it as such, but be warned."
"Drinkability: This got a low score for me because of the high ABV and the fact that I felt I was lost trying to drink it. Too much of the bourbon and not enough of the beer for me to want to make this something that I go back for, but then again, the 20 bucks that was paid for it would probably also be enough to help ensure that as well..."
" I would drink this any day. Again and again. Yummy. sad to see it go. so now i guess i start the search for another couple of bottles."
"Overall: Before taking a sip of this beer, I was thinking that I was going to have this thick and chocolate-like bomb. To say the least, I was a little surprised...but in a good way. This was a nice twist on this style and could have easily down the whole bottle. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"this beer was a hard one to get. I missed out the first time that my distributor had it but when i saw it again, i had to get it. I poured it into a snifter with a thin tan head. Hints of vanilla and bourbon came over. It had nice legs and oaky aroma. The sip had great caramel and vanilla flavors. The bourbon was huge on this beer. I loved the bottle. I had the bottle to myself, it was impossible for me to finish it. It was the definition of too much. A great effort and i love beers that are aged in bourbon barrels. An IPA would be great....hmmmm Dogfish Head take a hint. Let the 90 minute sit in one for a while."
"D - I think this is about as drinkable as you can get for a barrel aged beer easy to drink with a very good taste definitely worth hunting down to try it"
"My hopes were admittedly high, thus making the let-down worse. I have a couple bottles in the basement, I hope to revisit this and have a better experience."
"Very drinkable beer for the style. Shame it's so rare."
"Very good beer"
"Full bodied yet not thick, perfect carbonation and ever so drinkable for a brew of 10.7% ABV. This stuff tastes great now and will even get smoother and tastier with some age on it, no doubt. Highly recommended!"
"Split with willheels into 2 Brooklyn snifters. Poured this bad boy super slow and got a terrific 3 fingers of mocha brown head. Hot bourbon nose at first, velvety on the lips. Dry in the mouthfeel, champagne fuzzy. Very unique texture for a bourbon RIS. Looking down into the glass, I see the Milky Way with lots of starts. Back to the bourbon...dominates the flavor. Not terribly complex...maybe age will bring out more of the subtleness? Extremely drinkable though."
"Overall its very enjoyable.. I certainly am not complaining about the price tag and I am happy I tried it, though It wasn't exactly easy to finish towards the end."
"A very deep RIS, but a little lower on the complexity side. A good stout, but $25? You be the judge. Still, recommended."
"Black Ops from Brooklyn came is an imposing looking, corked and caged bomber, with an elegant black and brushed silver label . I chose pour this elusive find into a Duvel Tulip, and the fermentation in the bottle had evidently done its magic, and the beer came out with a thick foamy head over a pitch black body. The aroma of the beer was beyond belief, as the chocolate, coffee, and vanilla smells melded together seamlessly to create a cohesive whole. The First sip showed the effects of the barrel aging clearly, as the body was silky smooth and taste full of oak tannins and sweet vanilla beans. The chocolate and coffee that were so perceptible in the nose were far more restrained in the mouth, and toffee and black strap molasses were more prominent here. Clearly of a high strength and very warming, but not overly hot. A beautiful take on an ageless style."
"D - As a digestif, yes - if you're trying to drink the whole bottle, no, no, no."
"This is very good example of an RIS that's not too overpoweringly roasty. The bourbon aging is subtle as I get minimal presence from the barrels. Still, it's an excellent stout."
"pretty drinkable, i'm having 3/4 of the bottle by my self. i feel like a champ! drink it! i and my girlfriend like it!"
"It feels like a more subtle, delicate version of BBCS, with less bitter notes. Very nicely crafted, but too expensive."
"Would have liked a bit more balance with this beer, guess I should have cellared it for awhile but it's always good to see how it tastes right away. I'll have to rank this one as slightly hyped up, good beer, but I've certainly had better beers more deserving of being in the top 100."
"Pours into a chalice a deep black color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger tan head, which leaves one big island in the middle of the glass, with some smaller one's on the outside. The nose is malty, with some bourbon notes, toffee/chocolate. The taste is very nice the best thing about this brew. Malty, very nice bourbon notes, vanilla, toffee/chocolate. Full/medium body, velvety/creamy, texture. The ABV is hidden very well. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty RIS."
"drinkability is good. great balance, and very tasty. not my favourite barrel-aged stout (BA speedway holds that crown), but still very nice."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Rich but bubbly, standout from most imperial stouts in this regard. Big whiskey barrel character, but it's in balance with the base beer. Caramel and vanilla sweetness meets burnt bread bitterness. Moderate whiskey heat is plainly noticeable as well, but not so much in a harsh fusel alcohol sort of way; it's more like sipping on a fine whiskey. The finish is bittersweet, clean and pleasantly lingering. Excellent stuff, as tired as I've become of big stouts, I found myself really enjoying this one."
"I was wicked excited for the release of the beer, all in all its a good beer but its more of a belgian stout than a Russian imperial stout. It was lacking in body and mouth feel, The flavor was good nothing spectacular going on... don't get me wrong here its a decent beer just doesn't live up to the hype... didn't feel like a Russian imperial stout."
"I should have aged this a year or more I think - maybe it would mellow and mesh better with some time in the cellar."
"HV"
"This beer is exceptionally thin in the mouth however. I wanted something chewy and this was bubbly. Kind of a bait & switch after looking and smelling it. It was a little hot still, so I'm very curious as to how my other bottle will taste next winter."
"D - The bourbon flavors could be a bit strong for some, but I found it to be very drinkable. A great brew from Brooklyn, next time I sample it I will try it side by side with Brooklyn's chocolate stout."
"D - This is a standout beer that met my expectations."
"I fear this is perhaps a tad over-rated due to the high price and the brewer's viral marketing attempt. I much prefer goose BCS; this one could have used a little more time in the barrel; perhaps it should have remained a secret a tad longer. Won't go after it again unless I hear it improves."
"D - Found this to be tastey, but certainly not $21 a bottle tasty"
"Both the mouthfeel and the sheer size of this beer make it a sipper - I could easily savor a bottle of this over an evening, but much more than that would be a bit much."
"Bottom line: This is an excellent RIS and I'm *so* happy that Alan and Joe gave me the chance to try it. Thanks guys!"
"Drinkablity is low, only due to the fact that there is alot to dissect here and it's so damn rare and expensive, other than that, this is a fine sipper, hugely warming and highly enjoyable."
"Drinks like bourbon and like bourbon.... So that means it's nicely drinkable.... Goes down nicely on a night where we are supposed to have a snow storm. Perfect for the occasion."
"If this one did exist, I would definitely recommend it!"
"Overall, a very nice beer. If you enjoy bourbon you will dig this brew. It is considerable in body yet easy going down. Although the whiskey flavor really comes to the forefront, it is not the alcohol itself that is noticable. Very well done barrel aged beer."
"From a large bottle (guessing 750), Black in that nice super dark light stopper kind of way, with a little tan head. Bitter and chocolaty when it hits your mouth, then it leaves with a bourbon rub and a lingering chocolate finale. Nice beer to start off the tasting with..."
"ADDENDUM: I actually raised the ratings on the last three categories after drinking some more. This beer really gets better with each sip. Worthy of the hype and a real winner from BB."
"Fromt eh bottle, this was a dark blown/black licorice coloured brew with a small tan head of foam. Not much bourbon int he aroma really, more of a sweet malt and slight acrid hop. Taste was a bit thin with some roasty malt, and a good hop balance. Bourbon was there, but kind of hot, and all wrong in flavor profile. Mouthfeel a bit thin, drinkability a bit blah. I would not go out of my way to try this one again..."
"Pours a deep opaque black, no light gets through, thick brown head forms, drops a nice lace ring on the glass, very thick and chunky, great retention. Smell is nice, sweet at first, some brown sugar and toffee, molasses, vanilla and oak, chocolate milk, fruit, raisins, roast, bourbon sweetness, some cherry and strawberry, not bad. Taste is pretty intense, heavy vanilla and oak, bourbon, toast and toffee through the middle, chocolate, roast, burnt sugar, alcohol, pretty smooth through the middle but a rough oaky finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down but the alcohol is well hidden. Pretty nice bourbon barrel RIS, I would think this would age pretty well. Not my favourite but still pretty damn good."
"Enjoyed at Coles. Big bourbon cask aroma, very good bourbon taste at that, supported by some chocolate malts. Above average mouthfeel. Yeasty, a bit of sourness in mid-sip offset by the vanilla in the wood. A RIS with some complexity. Dark colour.A big beer."
"Overall this was probably the best beer I had yesterday, and definitely better on cask. Awesome warmth, taste and smell alike, and not a harsh imperial stout at all."
"The exceptional warmth of the aftertaste was a reminded of its strength and abv, so my second share of the dark ale revisited and confirmed all the special highlights I could talk about at length in the company of friends."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with about a two inch frothy brown head. Head retention is excellent, lacing is good. It smells like chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla, coffee and roasted/charred malt. It's a very nice sweet and malty aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma, no surprise there. Bourbon is what I tasted first, but there's also coffee, bittersweet chocolate, oak, vanilla, molasses and roasted malt noticable too. The bourbon taste in the beer is nice and smooth, and it has a lingering bourbony/bittersweet dry finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and very enjoyable to drink. It's definitely a sipping beer, the alcohol does catch up to you after a while if you end up drinking the whole bottle by yourself. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, I definitely recommend this. With that being said, I like big stouts and bourbon so I'm a bit biased!"
"T/M: Interesting mouthfeel. Medium bodied with some prickly carbonation in the background. Lots of vanilla and oakiness with some milky sweetness. Bourbon notes really come through on the finish and toy with being a bit overpowering due to the lighter mouthfeel. Also slightly hot. Bitter espress and alcohol on finish."
"Overall, this was not my favorite RIS, but solid none the less and certainly worth trying."
"D - For a beer of this strength and complexity, the drinkabilty is impressive. Not that I'd want to drink this all night as it's clearly a sipper. I'm knocking it a .5 point since it's not as stellar as some of my favorite RIS's but I'm definitely looking forward to aging the few extras I have."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"I think what sets the Black Ops apart from a lot of other stouts is the overall impression you get from Black Ops. Well named. Well marketed. Just a great presentation and terrific beer."
"This was a high pressure beer for me to review/taste, as I had very high expectations. I thoroughly enjoy the bourbon flavors, as well as the oak. I enjoyed it more than any other ris I have had, but have not had any other bourbon barrel ris'. I am glad I bought two, the other can sit for some time."
"The aroma is sort of a sweet white, vanilla cake smell with a hint of charred oak. At first, however, the stout dominated with dark, dark chocolate, and espresso which reminds me of Middle Ages' Dragonslayer. The flavor has a raw barrel character with wet oak, vanilla, and coconut over the burnt cocoa flavor. Very drinkable and slowly warming. Watch out for this one, share with a friend or two."
"A Good beer? Definitely. Worth the hype or the 20+ dollar price tag? Not really. First let me tell you what I loved about the beer. I, unlike my home slice that I shared this brew with (younger 35), like my stouts a step or 2 below pudding consistency. I really loved that Brooklyn was able to do a ""big"" stout with a lot of flavor while doing without the motor oil viscosity that so many other breweries do for their super top secret limited release RIS's. So cheers to Brooklyn for going against the grain. What made this really great for me was the use of champagne yeast to finish this brew. Those plentiful little bubbles did worlds for this stout's mouthfeel and flavors. They made every sip seem as fresh as the first, and helped bring the more subtle vanilla flavors out too. This ended up being important because the nose of this beer was heavily of Bourbon, as well as the aftertaste of each sip- which for me was the slightly disappointing side of this brew, way to much Bourbon. To be fair I probably should have aged it for at least six months, but, oh well, this is what I'm working with. It would have been a perfect stout if they had actually skipped the burbon barrel aging! All in all I do recomend this beer, but I also recommend putting it in your basement and drinking it next year."
"This was a very nice imperial stout that was straight-forward and cut to the chase. Not quite as complex as some other top examples, but a very drinkable and enjoyable big beer."
"Drinkability- I think my overall review seems a bit more negative on this beer than I meant it to be. I really enjoyed it tremendously but I think it's probably still a bit young. Give it another year or more and the alcohol will fade out a bit and make this thing even better. Thanks to my buddy for sharing!"
"The brew pours black/brown color with bright reddish highlights and a small bubbly brown head. This beers got one high octane nose! Thick chocolatey roasted malts, slight bourbon sweetness, even subtler wet woody aroma and big whiffs of booze. Bright and almost acidic to the tongue initially, i think its a balance of the alcohol, hops and time in the barrel. I wish the bourbon barrel was a bit more pronounced, i get vanilla and hints at bourbon mash but i crave more!! This beer is full of malt flavor, it really wows me because of its super light body, a little bit more carbonation would warrant a perfect score here. I expected this beer to be sold with a spoon attached but i was pleasantly surprised. Definitely a sipper and a nice one at that. Be warned, this beer is 'hot' right now, i have a feeling that 6 months to a year in the cellar would do this one wonders."
"This is certainly a slow sipper. Awesome brew, hope to find another bottle to age for a while."
"D: Extremely drinkable, given the ABV and style. Personally, one generously poured snifter was just right for me. A nice beer for a special occasion (or not) to share a few ways."
"Overall this is an interesting beer. For those bourbon and Scotch whisky fans, I think it's certainly worth a try."
"d- a little boozy, yes, but this is a tremendous brew, perfect for showing off to friends at parties and the like."
"Overall, too much bourbon/wood flavoring for me. But I can certainly see why so many people loved this beer. Worth the hype, but maybe not the $25 I paid for it."
"Jesus! This beer is effing awesome. It pours out very dark with ruby and dark brown hues coming through the edges. The head is dark brown and rich, and it leaves unbeleiveable lace. One of, if not the best, head I have ever seen. Not to mention some of the best lace I have ever seen. The nose is of roasted malt, dark chocolate, espresso, and bourbon. Dark fruits and alcohol come through as well. The taste is also wonderful: dark, bitter chocolate, coffee beans,vanilla, and a big dash of bourbon, which really appears towards the end. It's the biggest and sweetest beer I've had. I think because of the champagne yeast, the mouthfeel is heavy yet light and playful. I can't get over this beer. It is silky in the mouth and extremely drinkable...you should have no problem putting down the whole bottle, just be prepared to get tipsy haha."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth, but slightly thin."
"Seems a bit thin. A bit of warming alcohol. Pretty good, but something just seemed missing."
"D - great. I want a another bomber."
"This beer is fantastic. I could drink this beer all night. Unfortunately acquiring this beer is just shy from your first born."
"D: Given how in balance everything is, I didn't even notice the alcohol. Could drink a lot of this."
"Black OPS is a wonderful beer - and unfortunately rare. Brooklyn, if you're out there, we want more!"
"Drinkability: This is what happens when Brooklyn makes an ADIS, I suppose. The only heat here is bourbon-esque, well-blended, prickly, and woody - in a word, delicious. The alcohol itself is hidden well - the bourbon is its only outlet, and, well, that tastes really good - and though it is up there (hence the half point loss) - this is an incredibly subtle, gentle, well-blended, and drinkable barrel aged IS. Probably about as drinkable as you can expect one to be. You should expect nothing less from Garrett Oliver."
"D: Insanely drinkable for the ABV. Tasty Tasty Stuff."
"Just seems something is missing in the middle. A very good solid beer but not on the same plateau as the KBS, BCS beers out there."
"D: OK, very flavorful and really heavy and alcoholic. I am glad I split this with 2 other people, I don't think I would have been able to finish the entire bottle."
"i know my rating seems low, but this beer has a lot of competition. nevertheless, pitch black beer under a creamed coffee head is very pretty, and the nose, which exhibits lots of vanilla and oak, leads to a fullly complex taste loaded with dark choc., bourbon, dark fruit, coffee and the vinous characteristic of a proper ris. velvety, but not as full as i would have hoped for. drinks well."
"Pours black as midnight with a huge dense foamy head. Which dissaptes rather quickly for such a huge head. Leaving some nice lacing as the head calms down. The nose is mostly bourbon and wonderful oaky vannila flavors. Taste is absolutly awesome one of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Lots of wonderful bourbon flavor not too much just enough to come through nicely. Lots of roasted barley, coffee, chocolate as you swallow. Drinks rather well for such a high abv but its still a sipper."
"overall, great brew, it is amazing to me the different interpretations of this style. DL and darkness are sweet and this and abyss are very roasty and more traditional but all very good in their own respect. in my opinion Darkness is still king in my opinion if they could just make a thicker more viscous version(DL thick) of darkness they would conquer the RIS catagory.."
"Overall, a damn good beer. Great bourbon aroma and taste. Very rich and flavorful. The only downside is the cost. Around $20 for 750 ml is a bit steep. I highly recommend this."
"I bought this bottle for $17.99 at From the Vine, 750ml with a cork and cage. The bottle states that this is aged in bourbon barrels while flat, re-fermented in the bottle with champagne yeast. The beer is dark brown colored with a very dark tan foam. The aroma and flavors didn't do much for me at first, but I think they showed better once the beer warmed up a little. Now that it's warmer, the smell is really good. Dark roasted malts and chocolate, definitely some vanilla too. The taste is really unique and delicious, vanilla, chocolate, roasted beans, sweet malts. A little alcohol too, maybe it's a bourbon taste. The mouthfeel may be a little lighter than I hoped, maybe the flavor reminds me a little of Vanilla Bean Dark Lord but the body sure is lighter. Not a fair comparison as VBDL was epic. Very good beer but definitely on the pricy side."
"Is it worth ALL the hype it's received on BA in the past year? Perhaps// You be the judge and try! Give this one a try! Add some age on this bad-boy and watch out..."
"Pours as dark as younger35's soul with a one finger deep brown colored head that falls to a thin creamy layer which lasts throughout. Sticky spotty lacing holds on to the sides of the glass with no intentions of letting go, definitely a looker. Smell is sweet and smooth bourbon all the way with some milky chocolate and Columbian coffee beans. Carmelized almonds, musty earth, and vanilla beans in the nose as well. Just a pleasure to whiff this one, not overdone with the bourbon which can be a huge turn off at times with barrel aging. Taste doesn't disappoint. Rich smokey malts with chocolate, caramel, and gooey brownie batter. Underneath all that malty goodness is the bourbon base which is kept under control quite well. Midway the dark cofee flavors emerge with some wet charred oak and toasted nuts. Aftertaste is sweet with more warm bourbon, vanilla extract, and touch of breadiness. For such a big beer, the feel of this beer is silky smooth. Creamy, rich, and bold with a bit of tingle from the delicate carbonation. Sure, the alcohol is there, but not 11% worth. A pleasure to drink and a good one to share, but I wouldn't have a problem finishing a bottle myself. This is an A+ beer, believe the hype."
"Split a 750 into three snifters. Cork came off with a little pop, and it poured with more head than I expected. Smell was very bourbony. It didn't taste quite as much like bourbon as it smelled, which was nice. The carbonation was a real nice aspect of this beer - typically barrel aged stouts range from barely carbonated to syrupy flat, and I wish more breweries added yeast late in the process like this. Overall, it's a really great beer that I am glad I got the chance to try."
"MF & D> ok ok this is a cask pour, but the lighter body and the boozy character of this beer sometimes resembles vodka going down, maybe a white russian (or Caucasion, in the parlance of our times) at best (I'm not impressed). Of course, there's a side of me that tells me there's nothing wrong with a caucasion now and again, which may explain how easily it has gone down the gullet."
"Definitely a marathon, not a sprint. Maybe even a triathalon. Devote your undividued attention to this treasure and savor it over a couple of hours. Wow."
"Overall, a pretty good offering. I won't lie, I was expecting a little more, but still a decent beer that I would gladly try again. The aroma and initial taste promised great potential, but the finish just ruined it for me. Still one that you should seek out and try for yourself. Perhaps the alcohol will die down with some age on it."
"Mouthfeel is quite heavy. A nice fireside, winter-time beer."
"This beer pours jet black with a 1/2 fingered brown head and tons of lacing. Just like the bottled version the smell is huge of bourbon. The majority of this beer comes from the bourbon aging, yet the toasted malt base is incredible, flavors that also come to mind are vanilla, cherry and chocolate. The mouthfeel is very creamy, yet the carbonation seemed low. I polished off 2 mugs of this beer last night and I was contemplating a third! Huge beer, not a big difference from the bottled version."
"Overall, Brooklyn Black BCS is a very good RIS that is definitely worth seeking out. The bourbon characteristics and the alcohol can be overwhelming at times, but it was a solid beer regardless. Recommended!"
"Garret you have done it again!"
"D - Smooth, well balanced, nice aftertaste, other than the price it's something I could drink all the time."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer and one of the best examples of a Russian imperial stout I've ever tried."
"This 10.7 abv beer is very drinkable. The very low level of carbonation does nothing to cut the petrol thickness. Lovely mouthfeel with a texture that coats and then comes clean on the tongue. For $20 a bottle this is definitely a special occasion bottle, but worth it for a special occasion."
"Simply spectacular. Pours completely flat, with a very thin tan head. Massively aromatic with notes of bourbon, oak, vanilla and roasted coffee beans. Taste is filled with oak and bourbon. Expeptionally rich, vanilla undertones. Silky smooth. Powerful beer. Aggresive in the rich, oak, bourbon and vanilla flavors. Really one of a kind. Best barrel-aged stout I've ever had."
"Terrific stuff, Belgian style bomber, caged and corked. You know the routine, this stuff pours black, dark mocha head, leaves frothy lace. Nose of dark chocolate, coffee, fudge brownies. Deep dark chocolate notes, double fudge, cafe au lait, bourbon, vanilla. Complex, rich, flavorful. The big problem here is the PRICE. $21.99 (!) at DeCicco in Ardsley, NY. C'mon, this is clearly fine, even world class brew, but I'd much prefer THREE bottles of Stone RIS or other quality Double stout any day"
"Thanks to RomanW70 for cracking this one at our tasting. Served in a tulip. Poured with a quarter inch dense coffee-colored head that slowly dissipated into swirls of foam and tiny ringlets. Cap was refreshed with a swirl of the glass. Nose was incredible - bourbon, black licorice, alcohol, gasoline fumes; practically caustic, but in a good way. Lots of bourbon and booze revealed in the mouth on this one. Mouthfeel was full-bodied and lightly effervescent; silky without being viscous. Easy drinking and complex for the style, but pricetag was a little steep."
"M + D: The choice of yeasts to referment this beer did it a great favour... typically, I find that the carbonation in any given brew is about the same in general feeling (at least in most styles, I'd exclude many Belgians) - and more simply a matter of a control in the intensity of that feeling. This, however, is far more sparkling and foamy, smoothing out to a very mellow carbonation as the glass goes down (and after a few swirls to bring out the aroma, as well). There is a nice warming brought forth by the alcohol that takes it even more smoothly than it already does. A wonderful sipping beer, well balanced and I'm sure that this is a case in which I would find a difference each time I tried it for a while. Very nicely done."
"Overall this is a GREAT beer that really couldn't gain much by aging, this is ready Now. I wish I had some to drink tonight on NEWyears eve. This would be great to pop! A beergeeks Champagne."
"This one pours a deep black with a nose of bourbon, maple, vanilla, depth, licorice, chocolate flavor and some alcohol. Flavor is similar with the chocolate really coming through. Plenty of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and maple and vanilla flavors. Swirling produces copious amounts of yellow lace. Finish gives off slight bitterness. Incredible beer."
"Overall I was close to going a five on taste here, it was really just that good. The aroma was second to none. I am amazed and proud to have this beer in my fridge. One of the best efforts I have scene in a long time."
"Poured a dark black with an averaged sized brown head. Aromas of vanilla, lighter bourbon, earthy, chocolate, roast, and some coffee. Tastes of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, caramel, lighter roastiness, and molasses. Alcohol content well hidden. This was actually a pretty decent beer."
"Drinkability: this is a true all-evening sipping beer. At $19.99 a bottle, one will do in a session along with the high alcohol levels. IMHO, this beer is a little bit better than Black Chocolate Stout. Great beer everyone should seek out."
"This beer poured a solid black color and formed an dark tan foamy head that vanished quickly and left a circular lace around the glass. The aroma was of malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and a hint of anise. The flavor was of malt, dark chocolate, coffee and some coffee bitterness. The body was medium light and and the finish sweet, yet bitter with a heavy hint of the chocolate malts. A nice take on their Brooklyn and a shame they don't make it a regular, but maybe that will change."
"The head is thicker and produces a sheet of lacing. Bumping up the appearance."
"This is an outstanding ""sipper"". Too tasty and smooth to ""sip"" though. Dangerously drinkable. A world-class brew of a great stout with a great bourbon character. If you like bourbon-barrel aged stouts, this is a ""must try""!"
"Pours out a dark, beautiful black. There was a bit of a head, not huge, but good lacing and head retention. Looks just like I want it to, and even considering the presentation and bottling, this one is exiting to look at. The smell is clearly of alcohol in my snifter. You get a hint of roasted smells, but I think the sweet alcohol dominates. The taste is very smooth and creamy. You get dark roastedness, and the clear presence of alcohol. Then there's chocolate sweetness and the tiniest hint of fruit. You can also find a bit of woody taste. The mouthfeel is wonderful. Not much harsh alcohol bite, but good sweetness and complexity without any off-putting flavors. I love it. I drank half of the bottle very quickly while cooking, and I wanted to continue taking sips and drinks even after it was gone. A beer that I would like to have again. Guess I'll have to wait another year."
"Upon opening the bottle you could smell the bourbon. The pour was dark, and I mean dark, black. The dark brown head was silky smooth. As the beer settled the smell of coffee and vanilla could be found. The beer coats your mouth just as it coats the glass. The 10% alcohol cannot be found in the taste. It is almost TOO smooth for the amount of alcohol. The taste is of coffee and bourbon. It changes as the beer begins to warm a bit in the glass. Please remember this is a SIPPING beer."
"Note: cask version was better than the bottled version, which I found to be a little thinner, more carbonated, and lacking the same creamy mouthfeel that makes the cask version so great."
"D: It took me a while to warm up to this beer and its dryness, as I could feel the 10% ABV kicking in after just a few sips. After an hour I was craving another glass and helped myself to one."
"Overall, this was a fascinating brew, and I really hope that bottles become available. I would highly recommend this brew to anyone, especially to those who consider themselves bourbon or scotch drinker, and not BAs"
"Outstanding and the best brew at the cask festival hands down."
"August 12, 2009: Thanks jctribe25!"
"D: unbelievable, and a hard brew to come by. Garrett Oliver has no limitations. Could be the best beer I have ever tasted."
