This is better than Old Raspy; it's not 400% better (about the cost per ounce difference), nor is it better than their Double Chocolate Stout, which is about 40% cheaper. Basically what I'm saying is, this'll probably be the last time I buy it, lest I find it on tap. Love the aftertaste.","TheSixthRing","Apr 22, 2014"

4.08,1.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, molasses, light char, pine, herbal, floral, and roasted earthiness; with a bit of booze. Nice aromas with solid balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy/pine hop notes; with good strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, char, molasses, light toffee, pine, floral, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, char, molasses, light toffee, pine, floral, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Outstanding complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate earthy/pine hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick and moderately chalky/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Russian imperial stout! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and earthy/pine hops; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2014"

A bit sweet and sticky, but not unusually so for the style. And I love the ceramic bottles. Must try.","Samuel906","Feb 17, 2014"

4.03,0,4,4,4,4.25,4,"A trip to most decent liquor stores in Calgary will feature the usual wallet murderers row of suspects from Rogue. I have yet to spy a bottle of this one in Calgary but lo and behold it is currently available at Beer Revolution. Ordered a full 12 oz. in the hopes that I could still walk out afterwards, a nearly pitch black murk with the odd hint of ruby red and thick tan foam. Apparently this brew includes two ""secret ingredients"" and oddly enough the first aroma to greet me was something much like coriander seed, a citrus-like spice. Hmmm. The more expected dark coffee and chocolate sauce aromas then arrived along with earthy and citrus rind hop notes and faint smoke that brought ham to my mind. Less spicy alcohol burn than some imperial stouts I've enjoyed but this one has its own charms. Taste is an initial spike of burnt sugar, followed by cacao powder, dry wood, cigar tobacco, walnuts, and some dark pressed coffee although I find the chocolate and woody spice notes more prominent than any sort of dark roasted coffee flavor. Also rather unique is a strong undercurrent of grapefruit rind-evoking hops and oily resins, almost like a dark IPA in this regard. This citrus rind became more salient as I made my way through the pint. Certainly quite a thick and chewy beer although more fizzy than some other imperial stouts which somehow lightens up the mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy like an oatmeal stout. The fusel alcohol burn does reveal itself but again I found this one to be less boozy than something like Lagunitas Imperial. Noteworthy and certainly worth snagging if you can. Interesting in terms of hitting certain elements from other styles, bringing to mind various aspects of dark IPAs (hops), Belgian ales (spice), and of course the blackest and thickest of the stout/porter clan.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 24, 2014"

Nice aroma but the roasted coffee/malts, mixed with the resinous hop oils make for a stout and astringent drink. I'm very surprised the hop oils are still very bitter. 4 years has not mellowed this out. This could go for at least 2 to 3 more years. Wish I had another one of this vintage.","StaveHooks","Jun 20, 2013"

A lot can have dark fruits in them but not this one. Only addition is a little bit of hops to break it up. Probably a lot hoppier when it's fresh, if I'm honest. Not sure if that would be an improvement or not - will have to seek one out someday. Very tasty overall, I found it very similar to brooklyn BCS but with a little less chocolate.","Dope","Mar 25, 2013"

Big light brown head that sustains for the entire beer, and leaves nice lacing down sides of glass. Dark brown color. Sweet earthy fragrance with an almost light fruitiness. THICK feel. Beer could be a meal I believe. Coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Little alcohol in the flavor as well but it's not overpowering. Pretty bitter aftertaste that lingers. Lightly carbonated. Great beer. Only flaws for me were it could be a little sweeter, and that its syrupy.","Braz","Jan 19, 2013"

Clings all over the glass as you quaff. Aromas of molasses and old world fruit sweetness, brown sugar, coffee, oak and earth, and a hint of booze. Very rich, dynamic nose. Flavors are very rich, with a coffee and bourbon-like blending initially. Very sweet and roasted, with rich, darkly sweet undertones supporting a touch of bitterness from the coffee notes and a solid booze component. Smooth and heavy in mouth, with a rich, velvety feel. The aftertaste is a bit more boozey, with heavier presence from the wood and earth components to balance out all the sweet and rich. Avoids cloying throughout the entire palate. Very heavy, very big beer. Very good beer.","GarthDanielson","Nov 18, 2012"

This is the hoppiest, most bitter imperial stout I have ever tried, by far. Everything I love about this style is hidden behind those hops. It probably has more in common with a strong black ale than a typical Imperial stout. The feel wasn't that smooth, even for a nitro, but that could be an effect of the bitter flavor. I don't know, some people will like it (apparently - it's got an outrageous score on BA) and maybe a bottle will age well, but I'm really disappointed with it and frustrated that it cost so much.","TheRealBigC","Oct 04, 2012"

A decent head sticks to the glass quite well. Big chocolaty aroma entices. The taste very much follows the aroma. Chocolate malt flavors, roasted barley, and yes, even after four years, hops, dominate. This is very smooth. Drinks extremely well. I opened a bottle a year ago and it was not near this good. The extra year has been a good thing. If anyone has any more of these, they are drinking very well.

Nose of deep dark fruits, black cherries, currants, some raisin, plum. Touch of chocolate, and no alcohol surprisingly. Nice. Taste turns the tables, super bitter and roasty coffee. Deep dark chocolate, and a dry finish. Lengthy roastiness, and some sweet molasses near the end of the sip as well. Slightly sticky, but still quite dry. Pretty heavy body, and low carbonation. Absolutely no alcohol here, which is a feat for the ABV. Quite a nice roasty and bitter stout, that has stood up for at least 2 years, and could go longer I'd bet. 7oz is a perfect serving size.","liamt07","Oct 31, 2011"

3.62,-10.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a thick opaque black with a small dense 1/2 inch dark khaki head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Random small spots of lace slowly drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and a sharp alcohol aroma. I am also getting some molasses and graham cracker aromas as the beer warms. Taste is of bitter roasted malt, roasted coffee grounds, bitter cocoa powder, and some bitter hops on the finish. The bitterness is pretty assertive and sticks around on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a thick and somewhat flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is simply a pretty good RIS with a pronounced bitterness on the tongue. Not bad per se but I probably wouldn't go for one of these again.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 13, 2011"
3.26,-19.1,4,3,3,4,3.5,"O: One thing that bothers me about many American microbreweries is their tendency to exaggerate certain characteristics of a particular style, or in this case, to bring in elements from other styles that have no place in the style they're trying to replicate. Stouts are not supposed to be this hoppy regardless of strength. While this is an interesting effort that is bound to delight extreme beer enthusiasts, the traditional qualities of an imperial stout come off as being rather muted. I see this as a missed opportunity.","mrfrancis","Oct 08, 2011"

Smell is that of alcohol, chocolate, coffee. Taste is nice- tons of hops, barley, chocolate, coffee are present. The mouthfeel is the weak link here. As an 11% beer, I want this to be thicker, and more silky than it is. Ultimately it's a little on the thin side w/ hops/barley exploding in your mouth. Not smooth in spite of the 2 yrs. of age.

The taste has a caramel malt backbone with a little dark chocolate and a little dark fruit, but not the big flavor I was expecting. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated and not slick due to the higher alcohol content.

Heavy, rich, charred...just a touch of underlying fruit before being swallowed up by a long, bitter dryness. This is manly stout and despite the 11% I see on the bottle, there is absolutely no perceivable alcohol flavor-wise. Not the most complex beer on the planet, but what it does, it does well.

There is some roast bitterness coming in from the periphery, too. On the tongue the coffee mingles with some sweeter notes, with the bitterness developing later with the warming booze which provides for a huge finish. In the mouth it's a somewhat thinner body than I'm used to for the style, perhaps medium rather than medium full, but satisfying enough. The booze note holds back the drinkability but I'm willing to sacrifice that for flavor in a big stout. A very good beer.","EricCioe","Oct 18, 2010"

Very, very bitter, there's a ton of burnt grain, burnt toast, burnt sugar and maybe, a little hops? Despite its intensity, this isn't on the horrendous level that something like the Mikkeller Black/ CC 110K+OT2, especially because it isn't ashy. The rather prominent sweetness also does help. Bitter on the finish with an intense roast and burnt malt character that's tempered by a burnt caramel character, this is decent. The intense malt character does obscure the coffee (unless you consider burnt coffee as an acceptable attribute), molasses and licorice. As it breathes, and as my palate grows accustomed to the tarry flavors, I do pick out some pine sap, and a rather complex sweetness. Full in body with soft carbonation, this beer has quite the wonderful mouthfeel - but for the burnt malt character of course. Ultimately, 7oz is about the right serving size if you're looking to spend an hour or two with this. I doubt I'll revisit this in a hurry. However, this is rather unique, and worth a try. Just wait a year or two, though, 'cos this is just too harsh when fresh.","DefenCorps","Oct 12, 2010"

Rogue Imperial Stout pours the standard stout black, with about a finger of tan head rising up and showing a little staying power (I guess maybe this is better than it sounds due to the smaller serving size). There's really not anything in the way of lacing though. No one flavor really jumps out as I take in the aroma. If I had to pick I'd say that dark chocolate and an overly roasted note are the two most prominent. I can also find a hint of licorice and booze in the background. As I sip this beer the licorice fades out completely and, unfortunately, the burnt roasty flavor and the alcohol become the most assertive. A nice dark chocolate note is still there, and it becomes a little more prominent with warming, but it stays subordinated to burnt malt and booze. Carbonation is appropriately subdued, but the body is too thin to pull off the syrupy feel it's going for. Definitely one of the more underwhelming imperial stouts I've had, though I suppose it could improve with a little age on it.","axeman9182","Oct 05, 2010"

There is a good bit of chocolate in the aroma, but the flavor is dominated by coffee and black barley. Even the chocolate flavors are that of bitter baking chocolate rather than anything sweet. The bitter grain character seems a bit excessive at first, but it gives that beer a long, lingering aftertaste that unfolds into smoky, espresso complexity that must be given time to develop on the palate. This is not for everyone, and the drinkability is somewhat limited; a fact that Rogue seems to have recognized by bringing back the nip sized bottles.

Overall this one was not bad for a Russian imperial stout. It is kind of low in flavor as compared to others I have had in the past, but actually quite nice.

I poured it into a small glass and it looked like a thick coca cola with a light brown head. The scent is overwhelmed with malts, molasses, and coffee notes. The flavor reflects the aroma with an emphasis on sweet molasses, chocolate, and hop bitterness. There is also a bit of a light smokey flavor. At 11% ABV, the alcohol makes its self known. The mouthfeel is a full body, creamy texture. I would never want to session this beer, but if you have never tried it and like stouts, definitely buy this.

The liquid is completely black with nothing more to be said about it. While the nose has a taut muscularity to it, at the same time it's fairly inexpressive, light and hoppy with citrus and grain notes before the dark chocolate, caramel, creamed coffee ensue, plum and cherry fruit quickly breeze by, could argue that the mixed white citrus accents last longer, more pretzel dough than flaky pastry dough. Full-bodied with a soft, enveloping mouth feel, gently rubs its way into most of your mouth pores. Not to detract from the roast in the coffee, mocha flavors as well as the hoppiness. Dry, fluffed out carbonation too weak to lift things up off the tongue. Fistful of chicory, the white grapefruit pith has more oomph. Despite its body it does not warmly hug you like the best Russian Imperial Stouts do. Quiet mutterings of cherry, berry fruit, shut up by the graininess.

It leaves a nice cloud on the beer and a medium coat of lacing behind on the glass. A very nice ring around the edges of the beer. Smell is of medium strength. I get roast malts, coffee and cocoa. The balance is good with some earthy hops in there and a bit more strength would boost its rating. The taste is very nice for a straight up Imperial Stout. HUGE amount of roast malt followed by nice coffee and cocoa flavors (assuming from the malts). The hops are very nicely done for an Imperial Stout and they are earthy. I get a bit of licorice taste and no alcohol at all. I love the hop level here. The roast is almost a bit too much, taking away from a perfect taste. Mouthfeel is nice. A great heavy body with medium carbonation and a good bitter coat. A bit of warmth adds to a very nice feel, also some creaminess.

Smell is of roasted malts, some dark chocolate, a bit of pine from the hops, and a hint of alcohol. Taste follows suit - pretty damn good. Roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, coffee, some hoppy pine, and a bit of heat from the alcohol. Pretty well-balanced, as no one flavor really dominates substantially. Mouthfeel is smooth, thick, and viscous. Very rich. This is a damn fine stout, and well worth taking the time to drink.

Mouthfeel is creamy and thick, with an initial velvetness that abruptly transitions to a biting, bitter dark chocolate aftertaste that lingers incredibly long after each sip.

Slight sweetness up front with a nice blast of hops in the background along with the char flavor and a big drying finish. For 11.6% the alcohol is extremely well hidden. Very drying dark chocolately flavor. This was a fantastic Imperial Stout whose only downfall was a relatively thin body for the style, but this also made it incredibly drinkable.

4.4,9.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Served in DFH snifter. Appearance was outstanding; the way an RIS should look. Poured a deep, opaque black. One-inch mocha colored head slowly settled into a thin oil slick of foam. Solid ring of lacing around the perimeter of the glass during the tasting experience. Would have been a '5' if retention was a little better. Strong nose of toffee, malt, espresso roast and a hint of oak. Taste similar to nose with a little bit of dark chocolate and hops bitterness and a mild alcohol bite at the finish. Mouthfeel was dynamite; very full-bodied and silky with a little bit of effervescence to remind you that this is a beer and not liquid crack. This is a pretty formidable brew, and it let's you know that it packs a punch. If alcohol was a little better hidden, would have been a bit more drinkable, but perhaps it's not a bad thing that it isn't.","Jwale73","Mar 18, 2008"

The taste is not as sweet as some of the beers I have been drinking lately, but has a caramel sweetness contrasted with an espresso bite. I wish I had more.

This stuff is like liquid mocha chocolate. Huge amounts of bitter chocolate, coffee, roasted/burn malts, anise, and a little bit fruity. The fruitiness is hard to accurately characterize under all the other rich flavors. They put a flip top on this for a reason. There is no way you will be drinking all this at once.

Swallowed kind of bitter with an espresso taste on the back end(dowgraded the taste because of this flavor). This was a rogue beer and in typical fashion there were plenty of hops to balnce out the malt, but hard for me to pinpoint their flavor. Into the glass as it warmed, a few esthers vecame more apparent. A little thinner in the mouth than typical for the style-the alcohol however was nowhere to be seen.

As this ale gets warmer, much more of the dark fruit such as raisins, dates, and plums assert themselves into the mix. And still, very well hidden alcohol.

It had a wonderful black/red head, and left nice lacing when swirled in the glass. Strong vanilla aroma at first, leading to a sherry/alcohol smell. The taste was very good. There was a strong malt flavor, similar to a Barleywine, which gave way to the roasted malts. Comes off as barrel aged, not sure if thats the case though. The sherry/alcohol aroma carries through to the aftertaste, with some burnt/dried fruit flavor also. Good thick mouthfeel that this style should have.

Pours a deep mahogany (black in the glass) with a 1/2 finger tan head that fades to a ring before long. Immediately I nosed some soy and roasted malts, but this was still a bit too cold so I let it breathe and warm up. There is plenty of molasses and raisins to go with the aforementioned aromas--the soy is a little lighter and less salty at warmer temps. Dark chocolate, espresso, a bit of campfire ash and even some vanilla finish it up. Flavor has a lot of roasted malt, coffee, and unsweetened chocolate--I knew this wouldn't be sweet, but this has very little sweetness at all. The only other thing I could pick out in addition to the aroma were some leafy hops. Bone dry ashy char finish with just a bit of booze. Bitterness in the finish lingered and peaked at a 5-6 on a 1-10 scale, surprisingly. Full thick body with very low carbonation.

Nice saturated mouthfeel: juicy to syrupy with a medium carbonation bite. Flavor is intense dark malts: burnt wood, milk chocolate, walnut, a bit of coffee, and a strong acidic-grass (tomato?) undertone.

The ceramic bottle helps, since there is no risk of skunking from the light. Oxidation is another issue, however. This beer is strong enough where that shouldn't make that big of a difference.

It pours inky black, with a thin cocoa head that leaves bits of lacing here and there. Smells like a box of chocolates, with coffee, dark fruits, roasted malts, anise?, and hints of Tootsie Rolls. The first sip begins almost thin, but it quickly becomes rich and roasty, with bitter dark and sweet milk chocolate, strong raisiny/port notes, roasted/burnt malts, coffee, tobacco, hints of leather and licorice, and a hefty bitterness from the leafy/green hops, which, along with the ABV, contribute some heat to the mouthfeel. The body is smooth, silky and quite dry, medium to full with low carbonation, and it leaves a long-ass, bitter finish.

Into a glass it went dark, dark brown, almost-but-not-quite black and whipped up a frothy oak-colored head that didn't last too long, but left a ring clinging to the top of the glass. The smell wasn't overpowering, but included chocolate and heavy cream, it could have been stronger. The taste is really quite good, chocolatey and roasty with a lip-smacking cream finish and warming alcohol all the way down. This is what I want from a stout, I sort of wish it was wintertime right now so I could enjoy it totally, although on a cooler, rainy summer day, this is really hitting the spot.

Nose is interesting; lots of malt, some alcohol hints, molasses, raisins and a hint of lemon as well. Taste was good, although not quite as outstanding as I had hoped. I guess people are saying that this one has slipped recently. Strong caramel malt, some chocolate, a lot of dried fruit. Hops show up there as well, with some breadiness, and lots of coffee both at the start and end. Good, but not great. Feel was as expected: very full-bodied, almost syrupy, with medium carbonation. Overall, a solid beer, but not quite up to what I had hoped from both Rogue and an RIS. Not quite up to the (admittedly very different) Bell's Third Coast Old Ale I had in the same sitting. A little disappointing.","soupyman10","Apr 04, 2007"

Smell is boozy roasted malt. Taste is incredible. Very roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and still some alcohol. Its amazing how time has improved this beer. Only if Rogue still made this beer to this caliber. This is a very good RIS and one that I look forward to drinking again.","FtownThrowDown","Apr 03, 2007"

The scent of dries fruit, currant and raisons are very strong in the fragrance. That is followed by a the sweet smell of malt, a slight twinge of alchol is present as well. The malt is very prevalent in the taste, plus coffee flavors. Then a mild bit of hop bitterness comes foward, it ends with a harsh flavor of alchol. A thick, rich, heavy feel, very syrup like going down, the alchol does leave a warming presence on the throat. This was rather disappointing, Rogue makes excllent brews and I was expecting a very good imperial stout, the taste was a let down and the scent was nothing truely impressive.","cameraman","Mar 24, 2007"

Flavors are intense, a mixture of dark chocolate, espresso, and a balancing hop bitterness as well as some alcohol. A truly special imperial stout which was cellared for about 18 months and could probably have withstood another 18 months. 11 percent ABV is masked quite well in the flavors, but still makes the drinkability lower than it would be.

Black, like motor oil completely opaque body and two centimeter light milk chocolate head, with lacing. Toasted barely, black patent, subtle hints of dark chocolate and roasted coffee come to the fore of the scent. The hops are mild and provide some nice complexity. There is a slight creaminess that rounds this out, there is also a slight smoky, saltiness which is quite nice especially on a cold day and makes this all the more hearty. Taste is definitely hearty, the toasted barely, black patent are present with hints of chocolate and interesting hop bitterness. Flavor wise this very much has a strong roasted coffee character, bolstered by enhanced bitterness. I would however be very much interested in tasting a three or even four-year-old version of this especially after the hops have mellowed out. The alcohol is extremely subdued in the nose and really only manifests in a slow warmth, that said this is no weakling in fact the opposite.

Upfront you get a short charge of creamy milk chocolate and a nice cup of joe. That is short lived because the hop flavor and bitterness are WAY over the top. So much so that it is a big turn off.

Not the kind of depth I was hoping for. Mouthfeel is ok, drier than I'd like. Drinkability is low. I could have maybe 3 pints of this. Maybe.

Also a little bit of sweet chocolate, and although it's not bourbon aged, there is a very nice bourbony smell. Taste up front is a little roasted malt flavor mixed with a little sweet chocolate, a little thinner probably from age but still good size body and fairly creamy. From the sweetness up front the taste switches over to a hop and alcohol mix, there is still a decent bitterness and dryness on the tongue along with a nice warm alcohol.

4.88,21.1,5,4.5,5,5,5,"750 mL ceramic bottle, capped but with a swing-top cap for resealing. No date, but I'm sure this is no more than a year old. Enjoyed from a 17-ounce snifter. Pours like motor oil draining after 8000 miles: black tar with a dense cloud of espresso-colored froth on top. Aromas of thick brewed dark hot chocolate and pine sap along with a black roastiness. Flavors of malt scorched black by a cast-iron cauldron, baker's chocolate, spruce sap, a bitter alcohol-laced vinous quality, and a burnt, earthy, mineral twang at the finish. Just infinitely complex. The mouthfeel is incredibly dense and viscous. This is relatively fresh, so the alcohol is definitely noticeable and appropriately harsh. Without a doubt, a most drinkable Imperial Stout. Anyway, this is so good it *almost* justifies the exorbitant price tag for a 750 mL ceramic swingtop growler ($14.95 in my neck of the woods).","orfeu","Jun 20, 2006"

Smells of dark, very malty chocolate. My first thoughts on the flavor are that they remind me of both Bigfoot, Double Bastard and Brooklyn BCS. Heavy chocolate with a strong malty backbone and strong hop bitterness. Flavor expands when the beer is at room temp, but the alcohol also becomes more evidence. Plenty of black coffee and espresso with dark, dark fruity malt flavors. Good mouthfeel, but I just cant drink much of this.","tempest","Jun 18, 2006"

The smell has strong hints of sweet dark roasted malts. The taste for this beer is fantastic. It hits you at first with some sweet chocolate flavors and then follows with a nice roasted characteristic before finishing with a nicely balanced amount of bitterness. Some could argue that the bitterness is too much but I loved it. It is nice and creamy in your mouth with just enough carbonation which eventually dissipates but this beer is not any less enjoyable without the carbonation. Overall, highly drinkable possibly the best stout I have had to date.","MSchae1017","Jun 01, 2006"

Still, there is much to be said of it: Plenty of roastedness, black currants, espresso, anise, cocoa, and spiced rum. Flavor is magnificent. Alcohol content is well covered. Deeply grainy with strong coffee and cocoa flavors. Mild hop presence. Subtle vinous qualities. Mouthfeel is sublimely smooth. Wildly drinkable. Quite dangerous really. When I mentioned that the alcohol was well concealed I meant it. I can see myself drinking several pints of this and then collapsing from my bar stool when I stand up to use the mens room.

Pours a deep purplish wine color. At bottom it appears blackish but tapers off to a lovely purple near the rim. Nose is a fruity raisin blended with brown sugar and roasted malt, alcohol apparent but well blended. Mouthfeel is viscous, chewy, coats the tongue perceptibly. Taste is of aged prunes, raisins. A sour finish leading up to a lingering sugary malt taste. Alcohol is well balanced but readily apparent. In all the alcohol is fairly laid back but the taste still packs a wallop.

Tastes of light roasted cappuccino with a creamy chocolate milk sweetness along with some ambiguous vegetable presence. Towards the end, the alcohol reappears. Finishes with a swift kick of woody hops and lingering chocolates. The mouth feel was medium to thick in body with a very light carbonation. The milky character of this beer really caught me by surprise. I enjoyed this beer immensely because of it. However, what I didnt enjoy was the gigantic wad of doughy tar colored goo that plopped out of the bottle into my glass. This thing was huge! Being curious, I tasted it and it was a lot more hoppy that the beer itself. It came apart with a few swirls around the bottom of my glass, but it really surprised me as it was about the size of a super ball.

Smells of heavily roasted malts primarily, with stong hint of an espresso coffee with dark chocolate hue underneath, and can easily detect the alcohol. As taste and mouth goes, this is what a stout is supposed to be. Thick, velvety, creamlike finish, it has heavily roasted malt presense with an alcohol presense that isn't oppressive, with a wonderful espresso aftertaste that just hangs there. Greatness in a glass. I've had quite a few offerings from Rogue, but never this beer, and it has just claimed favorite stout status. Don't know that I'd be able to drink more than a few of these, but thats like taking points off for not likeing the colors on the bottle label.

Smelled like rich chocolate, sugar cane, rum, bourbon, light fruit...and im sure much more that I couldn't quite determine. Thre alcohol presence on this beer was definetly present, yet I could certainly put down another one without too much trouble. There also was a mild hop presence which I believe complimented the taste rather well. So often when I try a strong stout, I feel like theres a complete absense of hops that as a result makes the beer seem almost too milky and creamy, almost kahlua like. This beer on the other hand delivers on all fronts.

Flavors: see aroma. Overwhelming in the first sips. Becomes more fruity as the beer goes down. Dark dried fruits compound the chocolate and coffee flavors. Hop bittering and flavor add much more than just balance, it adds complexity, bite, and intimidation. Close to being a perfect stout. Only the harsh coffee and chocolate (chalk like) compounded with hop bite and alcoholic heat makes this beer less drinkable than a few others out there.

The taste is intense and complex, flavors of unsweetened chocolate, coffee, currant, floral hops, toffee and vanilla as well as the alcohol which is present and noticeable but doesnt distract. There is a slight sweetness present in the background, like blackstrap molasses or burnt brown sugar.

It has a coffee taste also. Chocolate flavors mix in as well. It is sweet also. This beer is quite thick. It coats my throat and stomach as it goes down.

This is a formidable looking brew. I like it. Putting the nose up the glass, an aroma of dark fruits, unsweetened chocolate, and some roasted malt comes through along with some alcohol. Quite nice. At first sip the chocolate dominates, followed by plums and raisins, then some roasted malts, then by some alcohol warmth, but the unsweetened chocolate notes continue right through. The flavours are bold and in your face. No holding back, or pussy-footing around here. This is a big, bold, and complex beer. Mouthfeel is nice a thick and almost like syrup. Quite lovely. This is an exceedingly drinkable imperial stout. It is dangerously drinkable, I find. The bottle says 11% but I couldn't tell that in a blind taste test. It drinks well below its weight. I'm going to cellar this one, and give some of the harsh edges some time to smooth out. Not that I mind the harshness, in fact I quite enjoy it.

Bitterness carries into the finish, where it is joined by warming alcohol, peat, faint smoke, and a bit of oak. Very nice. Full-bodied, with a thick (but not cloying), mouth coating feel.

I have often wondered what hopped up stouts would be like, and Rogue has answered that question for me. Cheers for that! Mouthfeel is chewy and viscous, not quite oily, but definitely nice and heavy.

Chocolate malt and some roastiness are prevalent, though not overdone  oddly, there does not seem to be anything else that catches the attention of the palate. The feel is one of initial jumpiness, probably due in part to the alcohol, that gently smooths out as the tongue becomes accustomed to the roasted characters.

Mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied, with low medium carbonation. Taste is dominated by the toasty, roasted dark malts. Burnt coffee bitterness, some chocolate cake, and a note of black cherries. Just a hint of the big alcohol. Bitter roasted malt finish with a hint of raisins in the aftertaste. Hops presence seems muted with age, and no hops notes were picked up. This one seems unlikely to benefit much from further aging. Very nice American double stout, but I wish I had sampled it when younger for sake of comparison.","merlin48","Mar 02, 2005"

The taste for me was dominated by espresso notes. There is some of the chocolate malt in the back, but I was surprised there wasnt more chocolate up front.

After being dissapointed with the appearance I took a good smell of it and was quite surprised by the pleasant roasted malt aroma and was saying to myself I'm in for a treat. I was sorely wrong. For a stout the moutfeel was pretty good. But left a overly bitter aftertaste that would just not go away. The taste itself is quite bland and nothing to get excited about. Overall I did not care for this beer much. The smell is misleading making one think that it'll be a good beer to drink.

Ridiculous lacing from this thick, oily brew. Mouthwatering aromas of dark Belgian chocolate, espresso, charred oak, juniper, and a piney blast of hops that reminds me of some dank bud. Everything is here in the tasting along with dark pit fruits, especially plum/prune, intense espresso, gobs of gooey pine, licorice, and earth. Intensely hoppy from beginning to end. Three years in the bottle has done virtually nothing to the integrity of the hops. Smooth and light carbonation, very thick, oily, coating mouths feel. You need a knife and fork for this one.

Mouth feel is significant in body...very oily and viscous....complex tastes...dates,licorice, columbian coffee, all with an over riding dollup of boiled hop oils that shadows this with a driving astringency that at times makes the whole mouthful taste salty when the alcohol tastes are added...long finish where these multitude of tastes play out against the alcohol.

4.1,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Rouge Imperial Stout was served from a 12 oz. silkscreened bottle dated 2001 (3 years aged). This beer poured murky and nearly black. In a pint glass, the stout was night black, and was adorned with a minimal dark brown ring form head that was easily thickened with a swirl of the glass. The swirls left nice brown lacing. The nose emitted a very dark and rich chocolate aroma that was accompanied by strong figgy and woody-earthy accents with a moderate sweetness. On the palate, a rich n roasty chocolate espresso malt profile presented itself softly, then quickly opened up with bold and tasty energetic-sharp woody-earthy bitter flavors that carried on right through to the robustly bittered finish, which left lingering dark bitter chocolate flavors and a rough powerful bitterness in the back of the mouth. No esters were to be found at any point, accentuating the earthy character of this rich stout. The body was medium-thick for the style, and worked quite well for the flavors and character of the beer. The drinkability was somewhat less than other examples of the style, due to lingering rough and somewhat harsh qualities described above. On the other hand, the alcohol was completely integrated into the flavors. Overall though, a pretty good earthy imperial stout that I would buy again.","HiroProtagonist","Jul 22, 2004"

Aroma leans on the roasted coffee side. Big and rich, this Imperial seems to be more on the bitter side than most. It is not rich and sweet like some of my favorites but this is still a keeper. Flavors of coffee, hops and bitter chocolate dominate, but there is an underlying sweet malt and caramel as well. The finish is mostly on the bitter hops side but there was a distinct black licorice flavor as well, althogh more understated than I remember in the bottled version.

Flavors (in order of appearance): strong coffee grounds, dried fruit (prune, raisin), dark chocolate. Weaving through all these roasty, toasty flavors is the sweetness of port. Alcoholic yeast licks at the roof of the mouth. Oak tones emerge by the time the beer gets to room temperature. Mouthfeel is winey and mellow, extremely light for the style. Balance, balance, balance. Drinkability brings with it a nice alcohol warmth. The bottle reads ""best when consumed after 1 year."" This being the first and only bottle I've ever had, I wouldn't know if it was past its prime.

The aromas are very heavy on the roasted notes, leaning toward burnt, with a touch of alcohol sweetness. The first sip reveals an almost burining, smoky bitterness from the heavily roasted malts. A touch of sweet smokiness makes you think your eating a severly burnt marshmallow from the campfire. The charred flavors continue to dominate even as the beer approaches room temp. Some more balancing sweetness appears, and actually helps reveal the hop flavors a little better. Mouthfeel is solid, but with a rather dry finish. Burnt flavors linger uncomfortably. Drinkability is acceptable, but there seems to be a bit too much black malt in this one. Give me a little more chocolate/roasted flavor without the acrid bitterness, and this would be outstanding. As it is, it's a one-timer.","aaronh","Dec 30, 2003"

Taste was bitter grains, raw chocolate sans any type of sweetening and tons of brutal over the top Rogue hops.I am a minimalist when it comes to carbonation, but this was overdoing it as there was no carbonation whatsoever. The beer was completely muddied by the fact that the hops and the malts did not acompany each other in the slightest. I will certainly not pay Rogue XS prices for this again.

Almost reminds me of drunken chocolate covered cherries. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a sharp carbonation. Initial flavors consist of dark fruits and bitter chocolate. Hops swarm in quickly to balance the malt flavors and take center stage midway through. Finishes with cherry and a smokey lingering dryness. Highly alcoholic, which detracts a bit from the overall drinkability. Wonder if it's past its approximate ""3 year prime", which others may have referred to? To me this beer seems to have peaked.

I'll get to that later. Motor oil black and opaque, like you're way beyond your 3,000 mile oil and filter change. A dense light brown head reduces to a cap but leaves sticky remnants down the sides of the glass. Decadently rich aroma....dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, a rich full city roast coffee, and sweet, sweet malt, but with a slightly citric note that makes it all seem, for lack of a better word, fresh. Bitter chocolate, caramel, espresso, and a slight smokiness are elegantly intertwined in the flavor. More bitterness in the form of citric hops and roasted barley come on strong in the finish and the smokiness develops a bit more as well, lending a somewhat dark, earthy tone reminiscent of a fine maduro cigar.

The start has some slightly sweet molasses notes up front. Chocolate is noticeable towards the middle, but only in very small amounts. Somewhere in the middle, there is also a slight burst of vinous notes. Big harsh heavily roasted coffee and hops notes finish and last into the aftertaste which lingers for a long time. Id like to age this one for a while and see how it mellows. At this point its a bit too harsh for my palate, and I couldnt drink more then one.

Finishes coffee-malty overall, but the aftertaste gradually establishes an enormous bitterness, almost ash-like.

My explanation of this stuff may not be as eloquent as a some of you other seasoned beer pros out there but to me it's just plain smooth. Samuel Smith might be smoother but it has too much other fruity stuff going on it which makes it a little confusing as to what it really is. The Rogue has a simple and not overly complicated taste. The alcohol taste jumped out at me with Arcadia and Storm king but not with Rogue. There is some kind of ""edge"" to it which I can't explain too well but I like it . Of course it is super thick -- almost liquor like. It pours with a head as good as any of the other Imperial's I've tried. I also liked the bottle design (12 oz.) .

Citrusy hop nose w/ hints of pine combined with chocolate, deeply roasted black patent and dark, slightly raisiny caramel malt. Mild butterscotch emerges as the beer breathes. Assertive hop bitterness hits the palate, and remains dominant to the malt profile. Chocolate malt melds with residual sugars to lend a briefly sweet, milk chocolate impression which is immediately offset by both sharp, slightly smokey black patent and the lingering hop bitterness. Overshadowed undertone of carob and buttery oak. Piney Chinook hop flavor remains strong, and couples with malt sweetness to lend a subtle, sweet spruce like note mid palate. Moderate in body, with a firm mouthfeel that is not quite as viscous as other imperials. Finishes bittersweet, with lingering roasted grain and hop bitterness. This is the 2001 release. Delicious in its current state, but further cellaring may tame the hop bitterness and allow more malt character to provide contrast. Easily the most bitter stout around.

Creamy and mousse-like in flavor and texture, this beer is dominated by deep malts, while the alcohol lends a nice spiciness mid-palate to compliment its dark fruit and chocolate notes. A very strong hop bitterness (87 IBUs!) gives a nice finish to the drink, and keeps it well in balance. Aftertaste is sweet and with a taste of burnt malts and currants.

Big brown head on top that leaves good lace, but settles slowly to thin.  When i first cracked this, some citrus hop aroma escaped from the bottle, but with the whole thing poured and right at my nose, that aroma is more suppressed and mingles alongside the big malt character.  Chocolate to be exact, maybe a little caramel as well.  Fruity also, besides the slight citrus.  A bit wood-like too.  Even a tiny bit peaty and smoky.  Very complex aroma, and unique for an imperial stout.  On the palate, a great combination of flavors appears, as complex as the aroma.  Roasted malt grain, dark chocolate, caramel, and bitter hop oil are noticeable first.  Peat and smoke are more noticeable than in the aroma, they add a great character, and come out especially well with retro-olfaction.  Sweet fruit hits near the middle, but then leaves.  Big alcohol warming.  Huge body!  Chewy and thick.  It can't decide whether to be smooth or aggressive in the mouthfeel department, which certainly isn't a bad thing.  Very hoppy finish that holds up even to the last taste bud.  A strong contender for the title in the imperial stout category with its great complexity in aroma and flavor, and its massive full body.

Aroma is very pleasant: strong scents of coffee, mixed with sweet/dried fruits, and burgundy/wine. Astonishingly thick body. Incredible tastes, it starts out very sweet, but then follows up hops, and lasts forever as it coats the tongue.  Little alcohol taste, but very nice warmth.

4.67,15.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"2000: 9/10/02- 7 oz. XS bottle. Looks like oil as it pours. BLACK. No head, just a very limited collar. The aroma is initially of grassy, resiny, pine-like hops and dark fruit with chocolatey and roasty malts. As it warms, however, the hop aroma is eclipsed by the fruitiness and roast character. The mouthfeel is quite oily, and very silky. The flavor starts with a sharp ""burnt currant"" note, revealing some chocolatey notes as it warms in the mouth, then a solid hop flavor & bitterness, eventually followed by an intense burnt roastiness. The high level of alcohol is surprisingly hidden. A complex, and absolutely intense beer that's best served in a small glass. (But I was upset when the put the Old Crusty in the small XS bottle!) This does not seem to have aged any better than a recent 2001. In fact, I wonder if it will age well at all, as the hops that are present seem to help distinguish this beer and I don't see the flavors rounding for the better - that will just restrict the complexity! All that might happen is that the hop flavors will become muddled. Hmmm? Only time will tell. An excellent beer in its own right, but not my choice for a stylistically correct Imperial Stout.

4.63,14.9,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"2000: Pours a bit like motor oil. A small creamy brown head disappears within seconds. A unique sweet/roasty mix in the aroma. Thick black appearance with fine sediment settling to the bottom. There's a great roasted malt taste present. There's a sweet and a bit of an alcoholic taste reminiscent of fine barleywine style beers. The bitterness is intense, as it should be for this style. And it lingers long after the drink. The IBU is 87.5. It takes an incredible malt load to balance this hopping so nicely. A truly great BIG BEER from one of the BIG BEER kings, John Maier.","Bighuge","Jun 19, 2002"
4.48,11.2,5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Bottle says best when aged one year, bottled in 2001. Some sort of coding on label, which might indicate actual bottling, but it would only be a guess (Dec 10,2001 in my case).  Anyway beer is quite fine now, at roughly half year (I think).","RonfromJersey","May 25, 2002"

4.7,16.6,4,4,5,5,5,"Black is beautiful and this beer is as black as it can get. Thick a touch sweet with an edge from the high roasted malts.  The one I just had was a 2000 but I didn't see any reason to add another entry. I think this is one of the best Imperials out there. Too bad they are not bottling them anymore. If you find one buy it, if not definately try it on tap if you are here in Portland, or Newport Oregon.","mattmaples","Sep 21, 2001"
