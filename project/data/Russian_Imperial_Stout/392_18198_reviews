"Poured out of a 12 ounce bottle. Maybe this batch went bad because it was sour (not in the good way) and not drinkable."
""
"Pours black like oil with similar viscosity and a nice amount of khaki colored head. Whiskey and cocoa on the nose, a little roasted malt too; follows onto the palate. Finishes with vanilla and cocoa, with a whiskey backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a big ba guy but this is tasty"
""
""
""
""
"Poured very dark, almost black, opaque.  Nice half-inch head. Aroma has touches of chocolate, vanilla and just a hint coffee and alcohol. Flavor was lots of dark roast malt, vanilla, and some dark fruit. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin from what I had expected from an Imperial Stout. Overall, pretty tasty, but not outstanding. Very drinkable."
""
""
"Perfect balance of bitter and sweet, great body, just a really special beer. Got nothing else to say to justify my deviant score! Cheers."
""
""
"Pours a deep inky black with a thick-ish light tan head. The head has limited retention and leaves very slight sticky lacing. The aroma is bourbon forward, with hints of vanillin and roasted malt. The taste is on the lighter side, but still has all the characteristics of the aroma, nicely melded together. The body is lighter, as well, with a nice slickness and a little alcohol tingle."
""
"Look great, smelled good, tasted sour. Must be infected. Or just a really strange mix of flavors."
"Looks good, smells great, goes down well at first... Then you get the horrible, horrible aftertaste. Disappointed."
""
""
""
"The look was perfect, it let you know it really is a stout. The smell was not as strong as a stout should be but it was there. The taste was great, the whiskey was hidden well, however, the feel let you know the whiskey was there. The feel, was like the previous statement, and kind of thin for a stout."
""
"Great beer !  What else needs to be said..."
""
"Overall: Very well made stout and enjoyable for the style. I would definitely seek this one out again in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Great look, smooth taste, the smell is enticing.  One of the best stouts I have had."
""
"Another swing-and-miss from Weyerbacher for me. With any of their beers, I've realized I either hate it or I love it. This looked and smelled nice enough, but seemed way too sweet, with an odd mix of dark fruit and toffee. Did not seem to be well complemented by it's time in the barrel. Besides the flavor profile that was a bit disjointed, the body was way too thin for what this beer is trying to be. Thankfully I had an Insanity on hand to rinse the taste out of my mouth and make me forget what I just drank."
"i was truly hoping for more. it did have a whiskey feel which was awesome"

"Dark and full of bourbon"
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/3/2015. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, light dark fruit, and roast/oaky earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and light dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, light dark fruit, and roast/oaky earthiness. Light roast/oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, light dark fruit, and roast/oaky bitterness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and light dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged imperial stout. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and light dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. The barrel character is very pronounced, but not overdone. A very enjoyable offering."

"This was just what I expected and I wasn't disappointed. Great bourbon taste and a nice heavy stout body, great example of a BBA Stout."
"Been a want of mine for a while but have had 2 infected bottles."
""
"A great great beer all around! I love this !"
""
"Not much I can say other than ""outstanding."""
""
"Multiple infected bottles of this consumed over a period of months. All of them drainpours. Awful"
""
""
"I found the whiskey flavor overpowering. Perhaps collaring for a year will mellow its bite."
"Warming full feel to this beer.  It tasted better as you get further into the beer and it warms up just a little bit.  The flavors seem to fill up a lot of your mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As much as I like Old Heathen, this just missed the mark for me. The bourbon flavor just did not seem to mesh well with this beer. Surprising because I generally like Weyerbacher's stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"poured with a nice caramel head and deep dark body.  great roasted malts to it.  lacking a little in the body for my liking, but overall a good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Enjoyable and balanced, the flavors and aromas in this beer are seemingly all subtle, but not necessarily in a bad way. Fairly easy drinker, but still flavorful. The bourbon/oak notes compliment the base beer well. The huge knock is the carbonation, it masks the flavors in a bad way. As the beer sits and warms the carbonation fades and is much more enjoyable."

"O - Something did not quite gel here.  There have been rumbling concerns of infection, but while there are off notes, particularly in the nose, this is not the issue.  The barrel has not augmented the underlying beer, and the parts are less than the whole.  A bit disappointing, but not the drain pour experience some have described."

"Drain pour for me...I don't love bourbon barrel beers but normally I can finish them. Just really, not enjoying this one. Drinks more like a mediocre sour than an Russian Imperial Stout. If it was the only beer I had in my fridge I could finish it...but for my one Tuesday night beer I'm dumping it and going for the Founders Breakfast Stout."
""
""
"Not a bad beer but just wasn't great.  Not what I was expecting in a whisky-barrel aged RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. The beer guy I buy from and trust recommended this stuff. I trust his palate but he missed on this beer big time. Nothing I want to drink again. May even end up dumping my other three bottles."
""
""
"So an employee at a local shop recommended I buy this along with the old heathen and blind test each. This one in my opinion is good for sure but super different than the old heathen. I thought there would be subtle differences based on his recommendation. Anyways, I liked both of them but old heathen is definitely more my style. This thing was like a sour stout. It was super carbonated. I started noticing the barrel taste more and more as it warmed up. Interesting beer for sure, good, not my favorite but I did enjoy it."
""
""
""
"What a disappointment. Bottled on 2/14 and I think it's also indicating a drink by date of 10/14. Similar to other reviews, there's just nothing here for me. Actually tasting more like a barrel aged sour than a stout. Thin, tart and simple. Not a good effort from Weyerbacher, which usually excells... Maybe it was a bad batch, but avoid the 2/14 bottling...."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"There is no coffee, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, anything. It smells and tastes like watered down $5/pint scottish whisky."

"To keep this short and sweet, there's just too much whiskey flavor for me if I want to enjoy this. Ole heathen was good but the whiskey on this one is a little overwhelming and unpleasant. Granted, I don't much enjoy straight liquor, and maybe that's the issue, but this tastes more of liquor than beer to me and I'm not enjoying drinking this one much as a result. It reminds me of a really badly root beer flavored dum-dum. I'll say it's ok. But that's my whiskey unfriendly palate saying so, keep in mind. Not something I'll seek out again."
""
"O: even with all the unexpected flavors mentioned above, I enjoyed this beer.  It was simple, fairly straightforward, and tasty."

"Skip and try all the straight RIS and Double stouts and porters first. Too medicinal. Let it warm. I'm going to open an Old Rasputin and save this for bed time. (or cooking)."
""
""

"O- Heresy is nothing like your bourbon soaked booze-bombs a la BCBS or KBS. However, that is not to suggest that it is any less enjoyable. In fact, Heresy is quite complex and possesses a unique character all its own. What's more, it possesses a high drinkability and stands to be the first barrel-aged beers I can have more than one in a sitting. In order to best enjoy this beer, I suggest drinking it as close to room temperature as possible and pour it with enough vigor to remove some of the carbonation. Since I did notice some faint sourness, I would suggest not aging this beer (or at a minimum this batch) since those flavors will get stronger as time goes on. (3.75)"
""

"Overall: I prefer when barrel aged stouts are roasted and chocolate malt dominated with bourbon in the background. But this has vanilla and bourbon at the forefront with roasted malts coming through towards the end of the palate. The mouthfeel is also lacking. I respect what they're trying to do and I tend to enjoy it more as it warms. Solid beer that I will most likely come back to again."
"Pours a deep black with almost no head, but it is beautiful. The smell is reminiscent of oatmeal and chocolate with large amounts of coffee. The whiskey barrels are on the end of the nose giving a complex finish of oak. Drinks smooth with strong coffee notes in the beginning. Finish is long. It is clearly a full bodied beer. Creamy on the palate and very well balanced with almost no carbonation. Very nice beer."
""
"O: A nice barrel aged stout; a little on the lighter side for an RIS, but still tasty and also a little easier drinking. I have no idea how old this bottle is (I’m guessing it’s at least two years) ... would like to try a fresh one to compare."
""
"O - Not a bad BA Stout, but it's definetly lacking in body. Not something I'd search out, but definetly drinkable."

"Overall this is a really nice tasting beer that I love and would buy over and over again. I have a hard time finding things to complain about but if I'm being honest it could be a little thicker, have more dark malts. Just really a nice beer but pretty sweet and not much bite for a barrel aged beer. That being said I would love to drink this all day."
""
""
"O - disappointing based on prior reviews here"

"DATE TASTED: April 20, 2014... GLASSWARE: Corsendonk tulip... OCCASION: Easter Sunday--another humbling, dry Lenten offering completed... APPEARANCE: intimidating black body with a one-finger, fuzzy brown head; consistent, well-tempered lacing... AROMA: thick peat, smoke and sweet chocolate scents; some licorice and candy too...PALATE: intense, impactful punch at the teeth; mellow at the mouth and warming at the throat--full-bodied...TASTE: sweet, sharp vanilla and milk collide with a mild whiskey breath that invigorates, if not inspires--a bit hot, but not much of a deterrent... OVERALL: the whiskey is subdued but the ABV is significant enough to attract attention; otherwise, a complicated combination that leaves a sweet, warm aftertaste...."
""
"pours thick black with brown head. aromas have dark fruit, chocolate cake, vanilla, whiskey, alcohol. flavors have raisin, chocolate, slight spice. it is actually really complex. a little bit of a bite, carbonation is a bit heavy but overall a pretty enjoyable double stout"
""
""
"overall: not bad but lacking complexity and heft."

"O- I really loved this beer. Im surprised it isn't rated higher."
"Overall: Decent but very underwhelming for the style."
""
"O: I am not a huge fan of whiskey - so that being said a lot of whiskey up front is not great. However, the other tones play really well and accent the whiskey flavor. Also the mouth feel is lush and sexy and I like it."
"I feel this was a let down, I was expecting better."

"Is this an infected bottle? I don't know for sure, but the fizzy head and sour notes make me seriously wonder. If I get the chance to try it again, I'd like to compare and see, but for now, I'm reviewing the glass in my hand, and it isn't good. Not at all."
"Overall - A little thin/watery and the wood aging doesn't really show up much. An okay beer but not something I'd buy again, too many better choices out there."
""
"Full body, slick and oily with some mild carbonation that lightly tickles the tongue."
""
"o: decent but underwhelming BA stout. almost felt more like an attempt at a quad to me than a BA IS, but still overall decent. not likely to buy a 4pk in the future though."
""
"Overall: The barrel still dominates the beer in every aspect, and I imagine this must be quite hot fresh. However, with time it’s really mellowed out to where some really nice barrel notes come out. With that said, this had a best by date of 11/08/2012, and in the future I’ll probably stick to that as the beer is starting to taste muted and the barrel is getting an odd, soggy/funky note. Still, I wouldn’t mind picking up a single of this guy once a year."
""
"Not a bad barrel aged stout for the price point, but too strong on the whiskey/booze characteristics. May be best with some age on it? Would be interested in trying the base beer."
""
""
""
""
"Very good and a bit cleaner than I recall in years prior. Hop aroma was a little more floral than I recall and overall my favorite offering when I visited the brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the best BA stout I've ever had but very drinkable."
""
""
""
"Mayhaps you have to leave this to mature like I did but it really delivers the goods, a slight bit thin at 8%, but that woody bourbon sour aftertaste is beguiling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black as night with a dark tan head that fades a bit quickly. Aome coffee and dark chocolate aroma and flavor hides behind a hit of bourbon. Rich, toasty character I expect in a RIS is lost behind the bourbon. Mouthfeel is disappointingly thin and watery."
"Reminds me of the Yorkshire stingo or the Sam Smith imperial stout, with that vinous dominance. Hoping that fades with age. I like sour, but not in my stouts."

"O: I received this beer in a great box from jagerholic thanks to my third place finish in BA fantasy baseball. This is my first offering from Weyerbacher and over all I enjoyed it but, I thought the alcohol was a sharp and a bit over powering for an 8% beer and distracted from the subtle nuances of the finish. I also feel the barrel character was a bit one dimensional. I got a lot of wood but none of the other flavors I have come to expect from a stout aged in whiskey barrels (Vanilla, caramel, toffee.) I would be curios to see if this beer would hold up for a couple of years to see the finish balance out a bit. Again, I did enjoy the beer and was glad I got a chance to try it. I look forward to trying additional offerings from Weyebacher."
"This is a creative brew, but not one I'll reach to drink again. The ethanol is out of balance as are some of the taste elements. The real enjoyment for me is in breathing it in...and it ends there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark brown with a small and quickly receding light brown/dark kahki head. Smell seems off. Some sour notes on top of heavy alcohol, black currant. Flavor follows very metallic and bland. Pretty high carbonation for the style. Not sure if this is infected, but it is not good. If there is any flavor here is is watered down black currants. Not much going on here. Not good. I will have to try this again hoping that I got an infected bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not only is it a wonderful beer to drink. I absolutely love the taste of the aged whiskey barrels that is left on your taste buds. I was so impressed with the flavors that I made it into an outstanding ""Heresy Brownie with Heresy Ganache"". If you have not had this beer give it a try as you will not be disappointed."

"A respectable beer. Not world class, but still enjoyable."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an interesting imperial stout. It makes for a nice contrast to the Old Heathen Imperial Stout by Weyerbacher."
""
""
"O: At first the aroma really was a no go cuz I'm not into drinking farts but as it opened up it became more like musty craft store floral aroma than ass seepage. The flavors were muted but decent. I really expected much more from this. Glad I tried this but not one I will revisit in the future."
""
""
"A really nice brew. The berry smell is a bit off putting but the flavor is great. Peel back the oak bark and there are layers of delicious flavor. Very nice, a beer I will return to in the cold winter months"
""
""
"flavors are good, if a bit muted. I think the lack of full carbonation affected the flavors a bit. Chocolate is lighter than the nose, but still there. Raisins are more prominent and whiskey/barrel comes through more without a boozy taint. It's quite smooth if thin. No off flavors here and may be a good intro to ba beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Got this as an extra. Was expecting much worse.. but super drinkable and smooth.. much better than most stouts this abv or similar i've had. Awesome mouthfeel and goes done very nicely. A bit light but actually enjoyed that feeling for a change. Super impressed for what it's worth.. A solid B in my books. If you get this, definitely try it!!"

"O - An amazing stout. One of the better bourbon barrel aged ones I have had. Sometimes the bourbon is overwhelming. This was just the right touch. Love it."

"Overall, this stout isn't bad. I'd like to see what a little aging will bring to the plate- but, sadly, I've finished the four pack. If mixing your two passions into one glass is your thing- this is definitely a brew that you need to try."
"This beer surely tastes a ton bigger than it is. I was guessing it was 11 to 12%, but is actually 8%. A pleasant surprise for me."
""
""
""
""
"Im very impressed by this brew. Nice oat notes with a good balance of the roast and cocoa notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting BA stout that falls short in a few places, but is overall satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Extremely smooth, rich, full bodied, barely carbonated. A delicious brew that drinks heavier than the 8.2% listed on the board behind the bar. Seriously good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is more of a normal stout than that of a BA Stout to me , the normal punch you in the face characteristics of a BA Stout just are not there , it is still a good tasting brew , just not one I would actively seek out again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In conclusion, an odd specimen of a barrel-aged imperial stout, with little of the expected bold, cacao/coffee of an imperial stout, but rather a dry and milky characteristic of a dry stout or sweet stout."
""
""
"Not bad, just pretty standard and by the books. I enjoyed my half pint for what it was, but probably not going to get any more than that."
"O - this is more on the subdued BA stout side, more mellow than other examples. This doesn't impact my view of this beer by any means. It is enjoyable, has a great taste and looks and smells great. Was a little on the watery side and to be honest I wish it had a little more intense flavor and higher abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I didn’t like this stout anywhere near as much as I liked Weyerbacher’s Old Heathen. Actually, out of all the Weyerbacher beers I’ve had, which I’ve liked very much, I rate this one really low, taste-wise. Not my stout at all. Love the name, in fact, it’s one of my favorite names for a beer, but I don’t like the beer."
""
""
"If you like a shot of Crown Royal with your fruit cake you should do well with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When I want a BA stout, but not one I'll miss, this is the perfect candidate. It's good. Ok. Decent. Fine. So-so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A good offering, but not in the upper tier of barrel aged stouts. Lacks a little bit in flavor, but very good for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours a deep brown/black with a finger of dark tan head which quickly dissipated. smells deliciously sweet of brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, oak, whiskey. the flavor is amazing.. a nutty/chocolatey/whiskey mix that blends so sweetly well together. a very simple but perfectly balanced flavor profile. once the beer warms up you get a lot more of the barrel flavor, which is still thoroughly enjoyable. really enjoy this one and recommend it to anyone that hasn't given it a chance. medium to full body with low carbonation, best drank at room temperature."
"The aftertaste is not too bitter, which is a plus. Heresy is a strong beer that takes time to appreciate properly as the flavors are complex and I'm still becoming acquainted with this one (only had one glass so far). I may re-rate after a second try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a somewhat subpar BA stout. If I were blindfolded, I would have a hard time guessing that this was barrel aged. Almost tastes more like a poor quality Quad. I'll update this if I get a different impression from my other bottles, but I probably wouldn't ever seek this out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've heard this has been called the ""poor man's BCBS", and I totally disagree. These are two completely different beers, especially since this is a Belgian stout. This is a very nice and drinkable barrel aged stout; it doesn't look to kick your ass like most barrel aged stouts, it just looks to be easy sipping and flavorful, which it is. Definitely worth it for the cheap price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad barrel aged stout, but it doesn't really wow me. I could see myself buying this again because it is affordable and tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Poured black with a two finger tan bubbly head. In the nose, chocolate, a little bit of oak, slightly metallic. Some dark fruit. Taste hits you with a boozy start, some dark fruit, oaky, bourbon, tobacco, some milky chocolate. Texture is good, drinkable but not as thick as many imperials I've had. I've always taken this for granted and decided to finally give it a shot. I'm pretty glad I only bought a single, it's not bad by any means at all, it just tastes a bit immature on the oak aging. I know I hold the barrel aged stout at a high bar, but this just doesn't wow me. Again, it's pretty good, nothing more. Glad I tried it once."
"O: Heresy is a decent beer but I can't recommend it any more than that."
""
""
""
""
"mainly in the mouthfeel and in the taste, the bourbon notes are there but slightly minimal for my bourbon desirous palate. slight notes of vanilla, chocolate, roast malts and bourbon, sweetness is a little les than normal and there is a very nice dry finish. the mouthfeel is not nearly as thick, slick and heavey as normal. the price point on this on the other hand is a definate plus at around 12 bucks for a four pack of 12 oz bottles, can't really beat that for a bourbon barrel age imp stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer, at a price that you can't beat! Is this the next BCBS? No. If you get your hands on a bottle or two, you'll thoroughly enjoy it! I am now looking to set a bottle or two aside to see how this brew develops, but this in my opinion is an undiscovered Gem!"
""
""
"O: This is a poor man's BCBS in every sense of the word. It's not as decadent, not as big, not as flavorful, not as hard to find, and not as expensive. The mouthfeel is underwhelming, but I can really see this as a great introduction to barrel-aged imperial stouts. Hell, I'd gladly pick it up again myself."
""
""
""
"Poured into pokal. Jet black, showing deep red in light. Thin tan head that sticks a bit. Smell; it has that ""old banana"" bourbon smell that BCBS has. Taste is coffee/chocolate stout taste up front, finishing with bourbon sweetness. In this way, it's sort of the opposite of the BCBS, where the bourbon came first and dominates. Alcohol not noticeable. As the second barrel-aged stout I've had, it's no match for BCBS, but it's good."
"I know that this is crazy - but I almost prefer this to KBS. Possibly it's because it presents itself with more of the bourbon than the KBS which is mostly coffee and chocolate (and overhyped yet still very good). Great bourbon barrel aged stout especially for the price. Definitely check it out. Don't understand the lack of love on this site for it."

"Overall - this certainly isn't the best barrel aged stout I've had, but its probably the best value. You really can't go wrong with this one at $3 a bottle. I wasn't the biggest weyerbacher fan initially, but after having Old Heathen and Heresy I am beginning to change my mind."
""
"Appearance is superb, pitch black with a light brown/tan head. The aroma is wonderful, full of licorice, leather, dark malt, and a pleasant smell of dog breath. Taste is of vanilla, burnt oak, a touch of bourbon, and roasted malt (duh). Mouthfeel is chewy and viscous. Great beer!"

"Overall: Seems to be an underrated bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout. I don't know how long they age in barrels for but its got a nice thick, sweet molasses mouthfeel that's different than most others I've had which tend to be more thinner but creamy vanilla. I'm starting to question whether I prefer the former or the latter. At the price point ($10/4pk), its really hard to argue with the value of this brew. I would recommend it for people who are interested in a cheaper but incredibly tasty bourbon barrel stout that isn't overwhelming with the bourbon heat, i.e. a cheaper, slightly more sessionable weekday night option. (4)"

"O- at less than $3 a bottle, this is a great bargain. The bourbon is definitely noticeable and has some complex flavors. Doesn't march up with the world class examples, but definitely worth trying. Going to out a couple away for a while to see how they hold up."
""
""
""
"O: It's not bad. There isn't a huge barrel profile which was a let down. I cant say these are hot, but I'm going to lay two bottles of the 4 pack down for a bit and see if it improves. I think I was hoping for the magic of Weyerbacher Insanity in a stout form, but this didnt quite live up to the bill. Regardless, it IS enjoyable, but if you are looking for a big barrel profile, I'd recommend you look elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Tasty BA stout worth the price tag twice over."
""
""
""
"I was really excited about this beer as I'm a huge fan of almost any beer aged in a Bourbon Barrel. THIS beer was aged in a Whiskey Barrel though. It had a really good start, but it doesn't have the sweetness that a bourbon barrel stout finishes with. This one was a bit drier, but it still was a welcome surprise in my birthday six pack. I would definitely recommend it because it IS delicious, but I would probably only drink one or two glasses at most if I was out."

"Black, little ring of tan foam about the beer. Smells like licorice, blackberry, malt, graham, some toasted oats, and a touch of oak. Nice flavor, lots of roasted and toasted malts, some raisin, plum, oats, oak, licorice, booze and molasses. Medium on full bodied with a tight, moderate carb and a semi dry finish. It's a decent beer."
""
""
"Want to point out the head: khaki colored which rose to two fingers with a strong pour and has been taking awhile to settle. This is the first I've seen from this year's batch but the brewery is right around the cornor. Best by Nov18 13 date which I assume to mean a Mar. 18 bottle date. Only the slightest hint of cola colored highlights when held to the light. Nice oak nose, with vanilla, allspice and coffee hints. There's alot of lacing lingering on my selinsgrove tulip. It's thin for RIS, but it's smooth and drinkable. The flavor starts with oaky vanilla, a hint of bourbon, black licorace finishes with a roasty malt char. There's not the slightest bit of harshness from the bourbon but a hop bitterness which I expect would fade away."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: upon hearing good things about this beer, I had to check it out. And I was glad I did. The overall complex and taste was fitting and quie delicious. Minor booziness was detected and enjoyed. Not much hop aroma, but its fitting for this type of brew. I would definely try again and would recommend to a friend. Cheers!"

"Very enjoyable beer, something to have one for a night."
""
"Overall: Doesn't measure up to some of the elite bourbon barrel aged stouts, but it's a good easy to find option at a reasonable price. Worth picking up."
"overall: Insanity is one of my fav beers and had high hopes for Heresy. Good but not in the same league."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was very excited about this but slightly disappointed that it was ""past-date."" Nonetheless, a delicious beer that seems to benefit from the barrel-aging."
"O: I bought this because I heard it was decent and slightly hard to find. Dare I say it, but this beer is Heresy. It's not bad but it's also not good. To me it seems like a run of the mill RIS. It is also my first Weyerbacher, and so far I am not impressed. You couldn't age it long and I don't feel it would taste better aged. It is already quite mellow, and the flavor profile is already pretty integrated."
""
""
"Certainly a bang for your buck! HERESY: The Economy BBA Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Can Heresy get any better? I wish I had aged more..."
""
""
"O: better than I expected, but in keeping with Weyerbacher's excellent barrel aged offerings. The smoked feel is an unexpected component."

"O: The taste was weak compared to many other Russian Imperial stouts I've had. The mouthfeel wasn't as warm going down as I would have liked."

"O – This is a pretty good RIS. It’s a little bit thinner and watered-down than I would like from a beer of this style but it’s still tasty. It’s also one of the more drinkable bourbon barrel-aged beers that I’ve had. Nice beer from Weyerbacher."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm just not crazy about this one. I've had it fresh before and while it did have more character, it still wasn't a great beer given how high the bar is set for this style"
"O: A very distinctive and interesting imperial stout with some big and very complex flavors. The barrel aging gives this a very unique flavor profile without totally overpowering the underlying beer."
""
""

"O: Had been sitting on this for a while. Glad I cracked it tonight, as there was a lot of good and very few detracting factors from this beer. Wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to get it again, but would certainly try it again given the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a dark chocolate brown with a finger of tan, creamy head. The nose is a tad tart - which does not work well with the taste. The flavor is creamy and rich with a subtle, but distinct undertone of bourbon and oak. The finish is slightly boozy, but pleasant nonetheless."
"Price Point - $3.50/12 oz single"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am not impressed and will never purchase it again. Just wasn't that great. I enjoy Russian Imprerial Stouts, just not this one."
"O: Overall, this was quite a pleasant surprise. Not sure why I was underestimating it, it has pretty high reviews, but it has been sitting in the back of my fridge for a couple months, never really catching my eye until tonight. Glad I finally drank it though. Good, strong aroma. Fairly complex and powerful flavor profile. Definitely worth a try. A well done IS."
"O - An average but tasty RIS that gets dropped on its ass by the thin mouth feel. Could have been a great beer."
"O - I enjoyed this one a lot. It's a nice example of a RIS, and something I would buy again. All of the flavors you'd expect from a good imperial stout are here resulting in an enjoyable, drinkable beer."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a pitch black with a small brown head that dissipates quickly but still leaves some lacing. Smells of coffee and slight chocolate, but not much else. Tastes of slight chocolate and heavy coffee, nicely balanced and very well done. Beer for its medium body is just slightly overcarbonated, but not so much to make it overly offensive. Overall, an above average beer."
"O - Great smell, bitter on the tongue and a bit thin."
""
"O-A lot of beer here, but a number of the flavors are sadly accessible. Other Weyerbacher products sort out a the mixture of flavors and feel better than this."
"O - I wanted to like it, but the mouthfeel is just so far off which effects a multitude of other aspects. Never again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-For $3 a single, I didn't really expect too much, but this is a great beer. Don't let the word 'bourbon' on the label fool you, this brew is only slightly enhanced by the barrel aging. It is not completely dependent upon the such aging. A legitimate Imperial Stout that flirts with excellence but can't quite pull itself over the ledge."
""
""
"355ml bottle. Tumbler glass. Revisited on agt´12. Dark brown color. Tan froth creates a creamy, quickly dissipated crown. Burnt & roasted aromas, hints of chocolate, tartar berries & alcohol notes to the nose. Touches of chocolate, berries & Bourbon at first sip follow by some roasted maltiness. Full & viscous body. Medium to high carbonation. Oily to watery texture in the middle makes tartiness to blow up malts. Helpfully it doesn´t linger into the slightly hoppy & sweet malty finish. Warming alcohol on the aftertaste. Dissapointed."
""
""
""

"Drinkability: With only 8% alcohol, Heresy is on the lower end of the RIS spectrum. Still, it's a good one to share, even if it's only a 12oz."

"Pitch black body with a fingers worth of sand stone colored head. Big alochol burn on the nose, surprised this is only 8%. Some chocolate covered fruits are also present. More chocolate on the tongue with hints of plums, raisins, blueberries and cherries. Mouthfeel is a sticky full body. Plenty of alochol to wipe the palate clean of anything that isn't alochol. Overall not real impressed with this. Think they could do a better job hiding the alochol and let the other ingredients shine."
"Overall: Weyerbacher too me for a loop here. I was expecting less, and got great. For the price differential, and maybe even for flavor, I prefer this over Insanity."

"4.5 D: Damn tasty beer at a very reasonable price."
"Medium body, slight sticky; average carbonation. I wouldn’t have minded a bit more heft to the mouthfeel. Overall a nice barrel-aged stout and an affordable, 12 ounce one to boot, but falls short of truly exceptional flavor for my palate. Glad to have tried it but I don’t know if it’s something I’ll need to buy again."
"O- very average overall. Pleasant although sappy and dull malt profile. Not too much roast or other complexity."
""
""
""
""
"O - Wow, a very nice surprise. I wasn't expecting junk, but this is very good. Wish it was distributed here because it is right up my alley."
"O-A nice RIS, sweet. The vanilla is a nice touch, if this beer had a slight increase in coffee it would be complete."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a delicious, very full-flavored, enjoyable offering. I would have this again in a heartbeat."
""
"OVERALL: This was alright. I'm not sure if the tart cherry aroma was intentional, but strangely enough, it worked really well. In fact, I was a little disappointed it wasn't more pronounced in the flavor, which was otherwise a little too average. The feel could use some thickening up as well. A decent beer, but nothing to write home about. Thanks again for the trade bsuedekum."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very tasty, in a perfect world i would bring out more vanilla/chocolate/roastyness and go much easier on the dark fruits but a very very tasty brew regardless."
"O: Very solid, oak aged RIS. You can taste and smell the oak aging although it does finish a bit thin/watery for my liking."
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice to have tried for the first time. Nothing that will knock your socks off but a nice change of pace with the oak component."
"Silky smooth, low carbonation, and full bodied. This beer is boozy as hell! It drinks like a 10% ABV beer, which worries me a bit. Overall though, I really liked this one, especially how smooth it was."
""
"O: Damn, this one took me by surprise. It might be the 2+ years on this bottle but this one is great. Lots of vanilla mixed with tasty bourbon and a solid stout base. This really was a pleasant beer."
"This beer has layers of complexities that make it work incredibly well. Bold and flavorful, fronted by an awesome aroma. Kudos to Weyerbacher for this one. I recommend and will certainly be back for more."

"#BOTG 59! Thanks to Mike for the chance to taste this one. Poured from bottle into CBS snifter. Paired with brownie a la mode! Poured a pitch black color, nice thickness, nice rich tan/brown color head. This looks like an evil one. I like. Smell- roasted toffee, some coffee, milk chocolate, dark chocolate. Taste- vanilla from the oak, milk chocolate, roasty notes. This is so smooth, and so mellow. I also cant believe how well this pairs with the brownie, esp the vanilla ice cream. The vanilla notes and the oak is really what makes this stout a standout. The complexity of the roast, oak, and coffee/chocolate that you get from a RIS is all there, but this is unique. This is a home run. Fantastic, getting a 5 on most fronts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice RIS to add to the mix. Happy to have picked up this single a few weeks ago. Could have aged it, but drinking it sooner than expected on this nice muggy night in Boston is well worth it. The beer got more taster and more aromas as it warmed up."

"Really woody, chocolate forward stout...might be good with some age."
""
"Don't be mislead-- there's nothing heretical here. In fact, it's a nice tame, conforming beer. As an RIS, it has all the basic features: dense, roasty-toasty, somewhat bitter but not overly so. The oak adds almost nothing; it might be that letting this sit for a year or two would bring out some oak characteristics. Not worth buying another bottle to find out, however."
"o: not bad but could use more complexity and depth for an imperial stout"
"This is a very enjoyable RIS. The oak aging doesn't do much, but it's good nonetheless."
"This beer is great and definitely a sipper. The vanilla (without being barrel aged) is an interesting contrast to a beer that's normally defined by bold notes of coffee and chocolate. Worth trying, especially to support a great ""local"" brewery such as weyerbacher."
""
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Medium body and carbonation. Overall it's okay to drink but I have several far better alternatives, maybe I'll return to later, or better yet try on draft if I can ever find it."
""
"O- I liked this better when I had it on tap. I think I'm gonna cellar my last bottle to see if some age can do it justice."
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel Tulip. Pours a very dark brown, with a two inch tan head, leaves minimal lacing. Smell is bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate, figs, molasses, and roasted coffee. Taste is very similar, but less bourbon than the nose would have you expect. Body is thinner than my favorites, not much carbonation, not overly dry, and drinkable for what it is. This is a nice, wanted more out of it for sure."
"Very dark brown with a black appearance, frothy mocha-colored head with nice retention. Lots of really dark aromas like licorice, wood, molasses and roasted malts with some touch of white chocolate and black cherries. Big punch of bitter chocolate, coffee grinds, dried wood chips, anise and vanilla on the first sip. While the chocolate and cacao bitterness and wood flavor lingers, the malty body turns flatter and less malty. Medium sized overall body with a sticky, creamy mouthfeel, slightly carbonated. Just above average in my opinion."
""
""
"Weyerbacher Heresy pours a solid black, with three or so fingers of tan foam. Head retention is decent and lacing is just a little bit spotty. The nose is a little quiet for a big beer, but it is heavy on star anise, with a bit of vanilla-sweetened chocolate as well. Licorice, a flavor I'm only really happy to see in small doses in a stout, is still the star of the show. Sweet milk chocolate and vanilla are what jump out next. Oak and bourbon come in to bring something new to the table for the close. The body has a nice creamy edge to it, but it's relatively low ABV for the style corresponds to a mouthfeel that's not quite as full as a lot of its counterparts. The carbonation is spot on though, namely subtle and out of the way. Weyerbacher Heresy is one of the more cost friendly, relatively available barrel aged imperial stouts out there, and it's a great value buy. That said, it's not going to wow you though way some great stouts will."
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid beer. Not really something that I'd seek out, but a great intro to the genre."
"I'm pretty sure this one's been around for awhile. Perhaps, one of the front-runners/pioneers of the style. It's well-done and very enjoyable. The one in my cellar is the same age. Might have to pull it out sooner rather than later. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was better than I expected. Too heavy on the alcohol smell and taste for me, though."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is fine- booze is definitely very present which detracts from an otherwise good mouthfeel; full bodied, moderately carbonated. I got this bottle for 2.45 which is great but I probably wouldn't buy more than a small bottle of this."
""
"Overall, this is certainly worth a try. A decent stout in an incredibly competitive style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All that being said, I basically liked the beer - it almost made me think of a black ale or an Akevitt Porter I've had before. A unique tasting RIS, and probably not to everyone's taste."
"O: Do you like bourbon? Choco-bourbon, perhaps? Pick this up."
"O: A good beer but the bourbon taste overpowers the rest of the flavors. I enjoy a good bourbon, so I think this beer is excellent. But you should be warned the bourbon flavor is strong."
""
""
"Pours a very dark oily brown into my pint glass - no light shines through. A very fizzy light brown head comes and goes until only a thin ring around the glass is left. Aroma is rich with an obvious bourbon scent, roasted malts, creamy chocolate, and molasses. After a big sip I can taste the bourbon, a figgy sort of flavor, and a splash of hops. There is an initial graininess that disappears quickly. The finish adds some complexity as it reveals the earthy barrel flavor. It does indeed leave me wanting more. This beer really coats the mouth in an ideal fashion - it has a milky or oily characteristic that sticks. It warms the belly on its way down. While this is very good, I could go for turning up the chocolate and roasted malt and a little toned down bourbon for a higher score."
"Pours a viscous black with a two finger beige head. Aroma of dark fruit, roasted malt, and a bit of alcohol. Roasted malt with a very slight sweetness dominates the taste, very dry finish with very slight understanded notes of oak. Very creamy, heavy medium to full body. Overall, I enjoyed this brew but expected the oak and whisky notes to come through a bit more and expected a bit fuller body for an imperial stout. Especially enjoyed the balance between the slight sweet tones early and dry finish."
"Overall - A really thin stout with not a lot of barrel. What is there? Not a lot, I guess. The flavors I get are light but nice. Easy drinking, but hot as hell, which is strange since it's so low in alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"I can see this beer benefiting from age extremely as the flavors in it now are all extremely aggressive and pull at you a bit. I'll come back to one in another year and look for improvements."
"Pours like motor oil, boozy aroma but get some bourbon notes as well. Taste is full bodied, taste is of chocolate and roastiness, some vanilla tones from the bourbon aged barrels. A really good imperial stout, tons of flavor and the bourbon barrels add a good touch.. would definitely try again."
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable and a fairly complex imperial stout. All of the flavors come together very well and none are overly dominant. I will be buying at least a four pack of this every year and I will be introducing a couple of bottles to my cellar for a year or so. I would recommend picking up at least a 4-pack if you can track it down."
""
""
""
""
""
"Those looking for an extreme beer should definitely look elsewhere. This beer is not over-the-top and it doesn't blow you away with power or intense flavor. It is a nice beer with mellow flavors that complement each other well. It doesn't explode on your palate like some barrel-aged stouts, but it's extremely drinkable. Consider me a fan. I'll buy it every year."
"Heresy’s quality stuff — big, sweet, thick. I could use a little more roast in this stout, but the oak has imparted nice toffee notes that work well with the RIS sweetness."
"Overall – Very nice. The beer is pretty good for those that both like more bitter or more semi-sweet stouts as it spends time as both. Not the best of either, but if you can’t decide this is one I would suggest."
"Heresy pours a dark complete black color, with a tan head that dispated quickly. The smell isnt strong, but has a nice wood order. The taste has a nice smokey malty flavor, strong oak flavors, nice earthy undertones. Very nice to drink, great flavors, full flavors, yet easy to drink. Overall i found this a great beer, enjoyed it greatly."
""
"The price is great--$13 or $14 for a 4-pack. That makes this one a very easy to find and affordable barrel-aged beer, and it's a pretty good one. Worth a try if you tend to like bourbon-barrel beers."
""
"O-a nice RIS, but not in the upper echelon"
""
""
""
"Have they changed the recipe? Seemed a lot better recently than the last time I had this one. Served in a snifter, a dark black color with a thin but dense mocha head. Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts, notes of bourbon and red wine. Taste of dark chocolate and rich caramel, some vanilla, more of the boozy bourbon and wine notes from the aroma, tinges of roasty malts and coffee. Very very silky smooth, nearly full-bodied, and a very enjoyable sipper overall."
"Overall: a drinkable, smooth stout with the booze well hidden."
"O: a quality oak aged RIS. Would like to see future offerings with a little more body, but the taste is top-notch. Highly recommended."
""
"Overall a tasty, smooth refreshing beer. Not as extreme as many of the other options but I'm not complaining. Could actually drink a few of these in a reasonable time. Weyerbacher strikes again!"

""
"Overall this is another great beer from Weyerbacher. They really make some lovely barrel aged beers. Nicely balanced and easy to drink."
""
"O - I was pleasantly surprised by this Weyerbacher offering. It has a unique flavor that emphasizes the bourbon from the barrel aging process. One of the best BA stouts out there with a much smaller price tag than some of the big boys. I am going to stock up on this while this batch is on the shelves."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended."
""
""
"O: Overall a delicious easy to get barrel aged stout. Depending on the season of course. Drink-ability is pretty decent abv isn't too high for an RIS and it goes down pretty smoothly. Body could use a bit more viscosity and it could be a little more aromatic but other than that it's pretty solid."
""
""
"Do you like beer? I do!"
""
""
""
""
"O: A relatively easy-going barrel aged RIS that doesn't over-do it or try to be something it isn't. Perfect for this time of year also"
"Would I get this again? I don't know, it's good but i'd put out the extra couple bucks and go with Tiny, which is such a massive beer (I like the pun of ""tiny"" for such a monster) or just get something like central waters bb stout or Williamsburg bb porter, which both have more boozy bourbon flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like the fact this is only 8% ABV for a bourbon barrel aged Russian Imperial Stout. It's very drinkable, maybe the only benefit to the mouth feel, and quite tasty. Nice job but doesn't sit atop the pile for the style."
"O- A very solid beer but it would get lost in a ligneup of well known barrel aged stouts."
"Pours black with a thick brown head. Aroma of whiskey, vanilla, oak. This brew is definitely different. If you like whiskey, you’re going to like this. It has a nice sour tang as well, which serves, oddly enough, to mellow and blend the finish. Not as hoppy or heavily bodied as most Imperial Stouts, but a very good and unique brew nonetheless."
""

""
"Overall: Decent RIS. It's a good brew but I wish there was more of a bite rather than it being sweet. The general aroma and flavors are good though."
"A little disappointed in this beer. Has a flaw developing and the beer did not benefit from the barrel aging."
""
""

""
""
"O: Not a bad imperial stout at all. If they toned down that black licorice and bumped up the dark chocolate, it would be perfect!"

"O- nice BA stout from Weyerbacher. Has a nice blend of flavors with the bourbon, vanilla, and roasted malts. No real heat noticed with nice drinkability."
"A rather tasty and quite easy to drink RIS, definitely worth a try."
""
"O: Very tasty and easy to drink. I thought all flavors were very well balanced and blended, but a little light for a stout, much less an imperial. Really like the light sweetness and barrel aging is just right. Nice feel as well. Will seek out and buy this beer whenever possible."
"O: Above average and enjoyable. Not at the top of my lists of RIP's but would gladly drink again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice flavor profile, but there's enough booze in there to keep it on the sipping side of the style."
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was its drinkability, and how inviting it was at the outset. The barreling is huge and the aroma is great with those hearty diacetyls. Nothing is too boozy or too bittering. Where we lose points, too, is in the lack of stickiness and ultimate smack that we expected from some a rich and syrupy brew."
""
""
"T/M - velvet like vanilla and bourbony notes at first, love the buttery notes in the finish, light in the body but a consistent velvet like texture; some vanilla ice cream, heavy cream, vanilla bean and raisin, pastry, candi sugar; I can see how this could be overly sweet to some people but oak and bourbon peatiness are very present."
"Good beer, I will buy another 2 cases of this this year."
"This beer pours black with a 1 finger mocha head. the smell is roasted malts with hints of oak and vanilla. the taste is very smooth and rich with the oak and vanilla notes really coming through. the mouthfeel is medium to full with good carbonation. overall a really good beer, will buy some more of this the next time i see it."
""

"Sweet slightly flabby finish, moderate to low carbonation. Overall a good imperial stout, but not great. The nose is phenomenal, but the taste is imperfect and not that well-rounded."

"mouthfeel - thin for an imp. a bit overcarbonated but very drinkable"
"O - Needs more body, and the flavors need to stay present and not fade."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch puffy dark khaki head that settles to a thin film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and some woody oak aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, vanilla, bourbon, wood, and cocoa powder on the finish. There is an alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer is a bit thin for a RIS with a very crisp mouthfeel. A higher level of carbonation on this one. Overall, this is a good barrel-aged RIS but the mouthfeel is a bit lacking."
"O. Very tasty, good entry level barrel aged stout or something you can put down by yourself without worrying about splitting it."
"Pours a dark cola like color with no visible light and a one finger coffee color head which leaves little lace. The aroma is of coffee notes along with chocolate and a nice oak smell rounds it out. The taste is of coffee and roasted malts up front. There is then a taste of milk chocolate which brings a nice sweetness to the beer. There is then a nice oak flavor to round out the entire brew. The taste overall was different than what I expected but very nice and very favorable. The mouthfeel is carbonated and isnt thick or slick. Overall this beer is good, there is no boozy like presence in the flavor or mouthfeel, this beer is very well rounded and very balanced."
"O: A really fine oak-aged imperial stout--definitely a sipper but still so balanced with no overwhelming boozy quality"
"Medium body and carbonation. A nice change of pace from all the big viscous bourbon barrel aged stouts."
"D-Overall this brew smelled good and it started out good. A good russian imperial stout flavor in the beginning but then near the end i got to much of a alcohol bitter flavor that made it not as enjoyable. Still a good brew but need to have a little more balance to make me reach for it again."
"O: A good beer consumed in good company. Not the best imperial stout, but tastier the more I drink (this is not my first beer of the night). Vanilla-soft."
"Good smell of coffee and chocolate (not much). Very soft and well balanced RIS. I am not sure but i believe there is a bit vanilla in it. The alcohol is very well hidden. Great brew."
"I'm a big weyerbacher fan but I think I will stick to their barleywines."
"A nice, dark, almost black beer. There was a head, but not quite what I expected. It was a chocolate color and faded fast. There was carbonation in the beer when I drank it. I couldn't quite identify the smell. However, the taste was great. Roasty, coffee, some chocolate. A little vanilla. A pleasant warmth from the alcohol."
"O: B. This one was just good, not great. But for the price, you really can't beat trying it."
"Reviewed from notes. Poured into dimpled mug, smell of oak from bottle as well as a maltiness that also comes through very thin lacy caramel colored bubbles around rim of mug. I was initially worried how the oak would influence this beer, but it blends well, it's presence evident without being overwhelming. Great mouth feel where the abv is noticed on the finish. Very good beer I would get again as well as more to try from the Weyerbacher brewery."
"I really enjoyed this beer though I did not appreciate any oak aging on the smell or taste."
"Tastes of chocolate, light alcohol flavor and a hint of vanilla bean at the end. Heresy is my favorite from Weyerbacher! I really am becoming a fan of Russian Imperials."
"O: Weyerbacher's Heresy label may suck, but the beer inside is a winner. I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed it, and was kicking myself for letting it linger in the back of the fridge so long. I'll be sure to snag a few more of these next year, and hope they can touch up the rough and tumble feel of an otherwise well done RIS."
"Overall - A good sipping warmer, but there are several other RIS or IS's that I prefer over this one."
"A really nice Imperial Stout that stands up against some of the best. Understated but very easy drinking."
"It's perfect for a comforting night around a fire on cold night. Like an adult s'more. Not that it tastes like marshmallows and chocolate, but it's that kind of feeling."
"O: This beer is rather straightforward and underwhelming for a RIS aged in bourbon barrels. It’s good though, and easy to drink. I just wish there was more to it."
"Pours a deep brown with ruddy highlights good creamy head. Not a very malty aroma. Tasted like burnt chocolate and sour raisins.Very bitter aftertaste.Higher and obvious alchohol content, which is expected in an Imperial. Perhaps this beer is a touch too hoppy!"
"It looked and smelled super, but the rest was a bit too evident sugar and alcohol for me."
"O- A very enjoyable big beer with lots of flavor and great balance."
"O - Very good for an easy to get barrel aged imperial stout. The appeal of being able to go into the store and buy this after work certainly adds to my overall opinion of it. It's nice to be able to get a good wood aged RIS without having to stand in line for 36 hours or offer your entire cellar for."
"Overall this is a very nice RIS, the alcohol feels more than the 8% ABV, so pace yourself and enjoy."
"O - This is a very nice oaked RIS. Weyerbacher continues to make good beers."
"O - A typical American barrel aged stout. A good beer but nothing spectacular. They certainly know what they are doing with their stout and their barrels though unlike some brewers out there who think throwing beer in a barrel makes it great. Wroth checking out and if you are a big stout fan this is probably one you will enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is very thin compared to other RIS examples I've tried. A bit of carbonation is coming through."
"i poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a black body with a nice tan 2"" head. The smell is of roasted malts and i get chocolate. The taste has chocolcate hints, roasted malts and some coffee on the back of the tongue. I even get a hint of vanilla. It has a nice mouth feel, medium body. Overall a good beer."
"Cheers..."
"Overall - the oak to this stands out and plays along very well to the beer itself. Perfect with a cigar."
"Overall: I could see really enjoying this in October-December; it's kind of a pity it's released in Feb. There's a really nice balance between roasty/fruity, both tart and sweet/and dry oak, but the booze (again, esp. for only 8%) comes through a bit too strongly and keeps this from being something I'd reach for regularly."
"Overall, think of a super-sessionable Imperial Stout and this is it, oak-aged, complex, defined and drinkable and this ticks most boxes."
"O: A pretty good stout. I've had better, but this is a solid one in its own right."
"Overall - A very balanced and well done beer, especially with the addition of the barrel aging. I haven't tasted the base beer they use prior to barrel aging, but I imagine it's nice and balanced much like this one. I think the barrel aging in Heresy was pretty well done. I might have liked a bit more strength to the barrel aging flavors, but that might upset the overall balanced nature of this beer, so I'll just say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Not my favorite barrel aged RIS, but I'd definitely drink this again. Thank you trxxpaxxs!! Another greatly appreciated brew!"
"Pours a cloudy midnight black with a creamy finger of khaki colored foam. The nose hits you with powdered chocolate straight away with butter toffee, tootsie roll, and malt balls with no real sense of true malts or wood - though it was a nice if not a bit sweet nose. The taste is brings dark roasted malts, coffe and a bit of dryer toffee - nice and different from the nose. The wood brings a nice tannic balance on the finish the oddly finishes a bit diluted for an 8% beer. Nicely done."
"Poured vigorously into the glass and developed a finger and a half width head which dissipated quickly. This scarcely had any kind of nose/smell to it whatsoever. Cocoa was about the only present scent, and it was faint at best. The taste is just...so undistinguished. There's not a lot going on at all. In fact, I struggle to pull out any typical flavor associated with a stout. It's just...bland. Alcohol is about the only thing detectable. The mouthfeel is the least impressive aspect of this beer. It's so thin, I feel like I'm drinking a weak cup of coffee. Overall, this isn't something I have any desire to come back to. I have 3 more bottles left. Think I'll give these away as extras in trades."
"Medium bodied and well balance with a strong base beer character that counters the strong bourbon barrel presence. Lots of great boozy bourbon flavor without being overly hot. A decent amount of earthy wood/oak as well as some coconut and vanilla notes the smooth out the sweet bourbon flavor. Underneath, there is a prominent sweet and roasted malt presence. Lots of luscious chocolate along with some roasted coffee, toffee, nut and oatmeal. Really smooth and quaffable, especially considering the amount of bourbon flavor. Very good and probably the best beer I've had yet from this brewery."
"Drinkability – Goes down really smooth, even in this summer heat. Nice depth and complexity without being overwhelming. Bold, balanced, and approachable."
"Overall it is good. No more, no less. Bourbon seem a bit low quality and there could be a bit more of a malt presence."
"I love this beer. It was one of the first imperial stouts I came around to. Weyerbacher makes my favorite-easily-accessible beers. This one is almost always in my cellar (hard to keep my hands off of)."
"Overall, this is a great Imperial Stout, and the bourbon touches give it an edge that is quite appealing. Only the slight vodka edge mars what is otherwise a good taste profile for this style. Still, if you're looking for a mealy stout, you don't get a whole lot better than this."
"I had this beer for the first time at a festival and was very excited to try a whole bottle. This beer poured black with a thin white head. It had an aroma of roasted malts with some notes of licorice, and vanlla mixed in. The taste was a nice roasty blend of oak, vanilla, and roasted malts, with notes lactose and cocunut thrown in. It was medium bodied and drinkable for the style without that much of an alcohol burn. This was a very delicious stout."
"12oz. bottle served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown/black with almost a finger of tan head. Big aroma of bourbon, but in a good way! Also some vanilla and toffee. In the flavor there was not as much bourbon as you would have expected from the aroma. Maybe a little thin. Lots of chocolate, not a lot of roasted barley. More toffee and vanilla in the finish. Pretty easy drinking. I enjoyed this."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer a lot; it will be nice to see how it changes with a little age on it. If I could improve anything it would be the body of the beer."
"Overall: While some flavors still stand out it feels like the age has mellowed and melded the flavors. It's very tasty, not great but satisfying-recommended."
"Overall-The fact that all this flavor comes out a 8% beer is amazing. Could definitely drink 3 or 4 of these in a sitting. Going to save some more bottles and try them every few months. As for the other few bottles I have left, I'm going to have to drink them."
"M - Light to medium body. Somewhat watery at times."
"O - Enjoyable. Glad I tried it, been eyeing it awhile. I will revisit this one in the fall I believe once the leaves start to turn"
"Overall: I really like this brewery. I have had 2 of their beers so far and have been very impressed with both of them. Under rated brewery alert! Fantastic beer. Seek it out."
"Overall, very good stout. This doesn't stand up to the best barrel-aged stouts out there, but it's a step above many imperial stouts on the market."
"O: A great beer if you like the vanilla taste especially. very tasty. need to get more of it."
"O. Overall I like this beer. Kind of hard to go wrong with a barrel aged Imperial Stout, but this beer has some finer qualities. It is very smooth. Has a nice vanilla milk chocolate flavor."
"O - Heresy seems like a name more fit for a beer brewed to be an abomination of a style while this one is pretty darn close to it's intended objective. Great all around, I'd love to age a few of these for future consumption. Certainly an enjoyable RIS!"
"O: Very drinkable in a snifter with a fine Grasshopper Tiramasu the tastes were very complimentary to one another."
"This is my first Weyerbacher and I look forward to tasting some more."
"I see what they were aiming for in this beer but they missed the mark. The beer pours a dark brown, almost black with a thin head that fades fast and leaves minimal lacing. The smell is of immediate oak and bourbon with roasted malt and coffee tones following. Faint hints of cocoa and smoke. The taste has ashy burnt malt up front and oak and bourbon in the back with no middle. The sweet that should be center is missing. Faint hint of dry cocoa meshed with burnt roasty flavors, smoke and bourbon don't meld well. Faint hint of vanilla trys to salvage but just isn't enough. The mouthfeel is quite thin for the style and finishes with medicinal notes. Won't buy this one again."
"Poured into my ccb pint glass, brownish black with no head or lacing at all. Aroma of the oak right away, then malts and sweetness. Taste follows the nose, vanilla and butterscotch are also there, finish is a bit medicinal. Mouthfeel is nice, moderate carbonation. Not a bad ris."
"This pours a very dark brown color and ends up solid black with reddish-amber edging. Less than a pinky finger of tan head resides for a short period of time. The nose is dominated by the offerings given by the barrels. Butterscotch, oak and vanilla. The taste is quite the same with a roasty exception. Pretty damn sweet up front but not really cloyingly so. Butterscotch, vanilla, roasted malt and chocolate are the big players in the taste. The bitter chocolate is carried throughout the aftertaste and mellows into a sweeter cocoa taste. Yum. The mouthfeel is pretty velvet like with a nice carbonation level. Very sticky as well, coating my palate. Big bodied beast for sure. Overall, great bourbon flavor upfront packs a punch without masking the roasty, chocolate flavors offered by the stout before barrel aging. Thanks again Rich!"
"Overall: Extremely generic and I wouldn't buy it again (particularly for European prices) but I don't regret picking one up. It's odd: though this stout is ostensibly -bal aged I've only thought to address that element twice, once in the aroma and once now - needless to say the bourbon factor is minor to the point of being undetectable. DO NOT BUY THIS BEER JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE GI BCBS OR PARABOLA/KBS/BLAH BLAH. In summation: fine, but unexciting."
"O- A solid beer, just a little thin and a LOT of heat"
"M/D - medium bodied with light carbonation, its very thin and disappears fairly quickly. I'm wondering if this is due to the age of the bottle. I'll have to find a fresher bottle to compare."
"I'd try it again, especially on tap. But nothing I'm super excited about."
"It's actually very drinkable, getting through multiple 12 oz'ers would be a piece of cake. The flavors are nice throughout the nose and drink but nothing is particularly dominant or powerful. Unfortunately, that means Heresy isn't too memorable, but it does drink more easily than many other competitors in this style."
"Pours jet black with almost three fingers of dark khaki foam. Pretty good retention but minimal lacing. Smell is roasted malt, a bit of toasted oak, bourbon, and cinnamon/cardamon, molasses. Taste is chocolate malt, oak, cola, some bourbon, and coffee on the finish. Nice round mouthfeel, medium-full body; carbonation is on the low end; alcohol is invisible. Overall: wow, this is really tasty. The oak is well integrated and avoids being overpowering. Definitely smooth enough to drink alone or pair with dessert. I could drink this all day."
"If you are out and see it try it, probably close to the bottle price and worth trying."
"O: Very nice beer, drinks extremely smooth with no sign of alcohol in it, but even at 8% its a sipper that could easily catch up to you. Probably the best beer I have had from Weyerbacher so far."
"The CPJ"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass. An aggressive pour yields a two finger sized tan head and an ink black body. Smells of bourbon,roast malt,and a slightly fruity scent rise from the glass. Strong roasted flavors with hints for dark fruits and berries and notes of chocolate and bourbon,oak,and hints of vanilla make for a nice complexity. But all the flavors are nicely balanced. Alcohol taste is present but is not overwhelming. This beer has a nice thick,viscous mouthfeel and a rich character. It's a big beer that avoids being over powering...one of my favorites. "
"I am sure there are faults to this beer, but to be honest, at this moment in time, I cannot think of them. IMO this is one of the best Imp Stouts for the money, but I admit there are 100's I have not tried yet. But as a point of reference I have had Founders KBS (draft), Victory Storm King, Samuel Smith's Imperial, etc."
"Overall, a pretty solid beer. I have to say I prefer Weyerbacher's Insanity when it comes to bourbon barrel beers, but this one is definitely enjoyable."
"Food Pairing: Fruits, Chocolate, Roasted Meats, Smoked Ham, Blackened Fish, Ribs (very nice rib beer!), Smoky Cheese, Creamy Cheeses"
"O- I was decently impressed with this beer. The bourbon characteristics are the most interesting part here, being very subtle and letting the rest of the beer shine through nicely. A decent brew."
"O: Overall, a good bourbon barrel stout and the best deal out there for the style. It's not at the top of the category, but I enjoyed this beer far more than I've enjoyed several other bbal stouts that cost $15-20+ per bottle. It's one of the rare bbal stouts that manages to still taste like a stout while incorporating the bourbon flavors. The bourbon could be a bit stronger, but I'd rather have it a bit too subtle than overwhelming like it is in many versions of the style. Its only real failing is the body."
"Overall: A bit on the thin side and I would have like bolder flavors. That being said, still pretty smooth and not a bad beer."
"Not bad, actually gets worst as it warms, believe it or not. Thin mouthfeel for style, slightly tannic and alcohol a little warm are its flaws."
"This is a sipper for sure. The taste of alcohol is hidden well but sneaks up on you. I'm used to big time alcohol warmth with Imperial Stouts, especially, barrel aged stouts but not that issue here. Very smooth and creamy feel."
"M,O: For a Russian imperial stout it is not very oily which is pleasant, there is also no overwhelming alcohol presence. Very drinkable for the style. The oak seems to smooth this beer out very nicely."
"O - Nice, but I doubt that the bottle would yield as much fun. Guess I'll have to try one out..."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a snifter glass. Pours jet black with a small fading thin head. Decent, but not great, looking beer. Aroma is chocolate, roast, and caramel. The oak and bourbon from the barrel-aging are just barely noticeable. Flavor is typical imperial stout notes of chocolate, coffee, roast, and caramel. Very subtle oak and bourbon, along with maybe a touch of vanilla. Balanced and tasty. Somewhat thin on the palate for the style. I’d like a little more to it. Smooth mouthfeel though, but a disappointment overall."
"This beer is a heavy imperial stout beer that has been aged in Oak barrels. It is in these barrels that the beer develops a harsh taste to the beer. I personally, do not like the taste of this beer despite the fact that I really like imperial stouts. I was disappointed and expected more."
"D - When I first read the label, I only thought this was aged in oak barrels, not bourbon barrels and was pleasantly surprised when I started drinking this. This was a really good bourbon barrel aged RIS. I wasn't the biggest fan of Old Heathen, but the barrel aging took the stout to another level. Nice chocolate and sweet molasses puts this one near the top of the BAL RISs for me, especially at only 8%."
"D: A little too sweet and a little boozy, but otherwise, pretty drinkable. However, I do prefer Weyerbacher's normal imperial stout (Old Heathen) to this."
"Heresy is quite a heavy beer that is nicely balanced by ample carbonation. Tastes of bourbon and oak come through with a nearly-over-the-top sweetness that stays barely on the right side of that line, probably coming more from brown sugar than caramel. Saw this on draft at ChurchKey and will have to compare the two deliveries."
"O: Good beer, but my taste buds are kind of burned out after just a couple of sips"
"O: Not bad overall. Nothing really stands out to me about this beer, but I didn't hate it. The oak taste isn't inhibiting like I've found in other beers, it rests nicely in the background and allows other flavors to show up. The problem is no one flavor seems to stick out."
"A well-balanced barrel-aged RIS."
"Overall, could probably benefit from more conditioning. The flavors haven't properly meshed, leaving me desiring more chocolate, coffee, or cream, but comes up short on all three."
"Pours a dark shade or two off of black, almost opaque body with some ruby and mahogany translucence around the edges. No head, but a collar remains. Nose has some chocolate, molasses and light roastiness. Relatively sweet in this respect. Taste has more sweet chocolate, molasses, anise, some maple and caramel comes through siginificantly as it warms. Sweet and medium heavy mouthfeel. Warming alcohol, and some lingering roastiness on the palate. Solid imperial stout."
"Overall, this is an enjoyable and drickable Imperial Stout. Enjoy!!!"
"O - A tasty beer but just a few off flavours in different parts of the palate. I think it could afford to be a bit better organized but a decent drink. I would try this one again for sure."
"O: I really like this beer and want to drink a lot of it in a sitting, but I'm unsure if it would be possible."
"I was hoping that this could get me my BA Imperial Stout fix, but no dice."
"Absolutely a solid beer, and I'm glad I got a chance to try it. It makes me want to look into Weyerbacher's other offerings."
"Pours opaque black with a cocoa-tan head. Nose is roast and coffee, maybe the faintest touch of vanilla/oak. I'm pretty torn on the flavor. Some sips it comes together and some it doesn't. When it's good, the vanilla and oakiness, meld well with the roast and chocolate and go down smooth and easy. When it's not working for me, there is a bit of booziness/faint bitterness or oak astringency in the finish that is unpleasant. The mouthfeel is affected negatively by that oakiness that sits on the tongue and a somewhat thinner than expected body. Overall, this is pretty good with moments of greatness and a slight upgrade for the can't miss price."
"Pours a dark black with a thin layer of light brown head. Oak comes through strong in the nose, as well as toasty barley, and some faint chocolate notes. The bourbon comes through quite well, and is quite tasty against the other scents. The flavor is very deep. Bourbon comes through first on the taste, followed by robust roasted notes at the end, very tasty. The mouthfeel is fairly light considering the ABV and complex flavors going on. This beer coats the mouth quite well, and leaves a pleasant after taste. Overall, this is a great beer."
"O- I generally love Weyerbacher, but I feel like they missed an opportunity on this one. Slightly better than average brew- that deserves to be more complex and hearty. Still, glad I got to try this one."
"Overall I’m pretty happy with this beer. Huge thanks to Crushedvol for this extra. It isn’t a beer I’ll seek out again, but I’m very pleased with it."
"What a beast of a beer this is. The color is so dark just like it should be. There is really no light getting through this one. The head is a thick looking brown foam. The aroma of some highly roasted malts give off this burnt smell to the beer which is countered by the Barrel Aging which adds a sweetness to the nose. The taste is all imperial stout. The burnt and roasted malts kick you in the face right off the bat, then it starts to tingle with some hops and the bourbon barrel finishes it off with a very light sweet vanilla flavor and some fresh wood. The mouthfeel is nice and thick like oil. Really a nice brew!"
"(D)- A world class stout that is severely underrated in the world that consider ""bigger is better"" high gravity, boozy stouts. This is what I like to see in a great stout. I daresay this has more (and better) flavor that alot of the big, heavy, popular Imperial Stouts lack. Excellent stuff to say the least."
"overall this is a solid RIS, but also a flawed one. personally i look for my (russian) imperial stouts to be bolder and thicker."
"Overall- its no oak yeti or bbcs but for the price it is one of the better deals on oak aged imps."
"Verdict: excellent beer, worth tracking down"
"Pours a hazy very dark brown with two finger medium brown head that quickly fades to a thin layer. Spotty lace left behind. Smell: a little oak character, booze, caramelized sugar, creamered coffee, whiff of vanilla. Taste: caramelized sugars, medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, a little vanilla, with earthy hop balance. It does have a really mild/watery whiskey/bourbon note near the end of the sip. Velvety feel, but lighter bodied than most, semi-dry and sweet finish. Nice. 2011."
"D - great, interesting flavor - a bit different than I was expecting, but I really enjoyed it. I will definitely come back to this when i have a chance."
"O Excellent beer that I will buy over and over again."
"O- I've always enjoyed this brew. I wish I had saved a couple from a few years ago so that I could try them side by side."
"Overall, this drinks more like a sweet milk stout than an imperial. The flavors are decent, though I was left wanting more. A decently drinkable beer, though I'd put it in the mid-range of imperial stouts."
"Overall: Very drinkable for such a good beer, and a pleasure on tap. I wish this brew were a bit bigger, with the flavors more pronounced and the body a bit more robust, but at 8%, it is unimpeachable. The bottle is probably stronger overall, but the tap is fresh and woodsy and delicious. It grew on me. The first pint was a tad disappointing, with later servings being round and fulfilling."
"If you like Russian Imperial Stouts this is a must try if you can find it."
"O- nice beer everything works well together"
"Mouthfeel is more carbonated than expected and creamy at the same time. Booze hits at the back as well, which is unwelcome in this as it amplifies the overly rich buttery flavor and feel in the middle. Overall though it's a very decent mouthfeel. Drinkability is tough to gauge - it's a good sipper, and a very bad drinker. I find myself enjoying most when I have a glass of water nearby to clean my palate in between sips. I guess this is a good, but not great beer in my eyes, but I'm more of a chocolate and coffee guy anyways."
"Good effort from a great local brewery."
"Overall: Not a bad option to go for, but I'd be hard pressed to put this at the top of my shopping list anytime soon. It has admirable traits and unique aspects that make it a worthy drink, but it loses out against my other favorites in the style."
"D: A nice RIS from Weyerbacher with their trademark attention to hops and higher ABV, 8% in the case of Heresy. It's got a lot of potential for doctored spin-offs, like bourbon and oak aged versions. As it stands, not a bad choice if Old Rasputin isn't available."
"Overall, pretty tasty. I haven't had too much from Weyerbacher, even though they're a local. I'll be seeking out some more from them in the future."
"O - A great choice for anyone who enjoys dark beer. Tons of flavor but not harsh in its body or warmth."
"O - I enjoy this beer as a drinker in my rotation. Not the best Imperial oak stout but very solid beer. I buy a four pack once a month. Encourage people to try this one."
"D: Unlike Insanity, barrel-aging certainly did this one well."
"Drinkability: I would say that this a pretty drinkable beer. The bourbon doesn't dominate the beer like some other barrel aged beers. The bourbon itself adds a nice touch to the beer. I just wish I had found this earlier in the winter such as December rather than March. I can't really see myself drinking this in the springtime unfortunately."
"Drink is pretty good. Nice oak characters, and overall a nice brew!"
"Only negative- Weyerbacher's terrible labels. Theses are no doubt the worst looking beers on the shelf. They are redesigning their labels and with good cause. Hideous."
"I actually get quite a bit of the oak, something that reminds me of whiskey/bourbon, a definite plus for this drink. Otherwise some maltiness with some coffee and chocolate tones. Medium body, a little oily, but tough to take more than one of these, as might be typical of the style."
"D- Great conversational beer. Ideal for room temperature."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. I can pretty much sum this up as an inoffensive BA RIS. Great for someone trying to break into the style, but lacking much oomph to keep them coming back from more. The glaring flaw in this is the mouthfeel, and if this could be beefed up a bit, I could see it aiding the other factors more."
"D--I enjoy this brew as much as anything because it is all about the oak aging, not just simply a bourbon bomb. The oak presence makes it unique, a smooth sipper. I highly recommend this brew, it is top notch and this year's version is really tasty."
"D: if you can find this stuff in a store by you, i highly recommend picking some up. im sure putting some away for a little could help, but only being 8%, the little bit of alcohol is extremely tolerable."
"I guess I was a tad let down. It lacks the X-factor, but it's worthy. Maybe I just expected more being a fan of Weyerbacher."
"Drinkability is not good enough for me. If this were perhaps an American Stout then I would rate it higher but this is just weak and lacking flavor and depth for this style. I will admit though the abv is hardly noticeable, but that's probably due to how weak in general the brew is. Too bad, was hoping for some good things from this one as an avid whiskey bourbon fan. This thing was in whiskey barrels? Could have fooled me..."
"D - Great for the style, easily could go back for more. Flavors are mixed and delicious but don't wear on you, mouthfeel and booze are moderate to the style. Finally, a RIS with some complexity without being overpowering, some balance, and not so ""huge"" as to be a gut buster...and it's relatively inexpensive to boot."
"My first beer from Weyerbacher was a good one. Wouldn't mind seeing what this will do after some age, maybe the alcohol will mellow nicely."
"Drinkability is good for such a heavy, flavorful stout, but for those averse to liquorice, might just be one to sip."
"D- another RIS in my bank. i love it i love it. but cmon lets update this label. its so...pedestrian for the contents inside."
"Heresy doesnt have a ""poor"" drinkability..the carbonation just needs some taming. Perhaps with some age this might be a great beer, hopefully the carbonation will decrease and the viscosity will increase. Ill be sure to review it again sometime in december."
"d - A very good RIS. While there is light alcohol in the smell and taste, I didn't get a lot of wood/oak or bourbon. That being said, I still really enjoyed this one and it was nice to have a barrel aged RIS under 10% ABV that comes in a 12 oz. bottle. Would certainly pick this up again."
"Slainte!"
"Drinkability: Tasty brew, nice barrel aged flavor. A sipper, went well with aged cheddar and bleu cheeses which took it up to another level. Worth keeping a few of these in the cellar."
"Cheers!"
"D - If you're looking for an easy drinking barrel aged beer then look no further. The low abv and accompanied lack of any kind of burn leave the flavors open to be enjoyed."
"Vanilla undertones with roasted malts again very present. A nice warming sting from the alcohol to clean the mouth and invite more of this stuff. It's not bad. Heresy is a bit thinner than I'd like but its pretty good. Creamy mouthfeel but for being thin as I mentioned, there is some feel to it. Overall i recomend this to RIS folks."
"On the high end of medium bodied, lightish level of carbonation, a very smooth mouth feel and pretty darned easy to drink. There's no bottling date that I can find so I don't know if this is fresh or has been around a while but, no matter, I'm digging it."
"D - Barrel aging is well done and not overpowering. Clean roasted and burnt malt flavors still come through, and goes down smooth."
"Very nicely done."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A good sipping brew. I'd enjoy having this one in the morning. Resembles more of a cold coffee taste with an alcohol spike. A delicious imperial stout and one that I have been looking forward too."
"D: Enjoyable but not as great as some other barrel aged stouts out there; still, at its price point, definitely worth a try."
"D: Overall, a very solid beer from Weyerbacher. Everything blends together well and i could easily have a few of these in a sitting. Ive had this 4 years ago and i find this vintage much more drinkable than the former."
"Morey's Bottom Line: One of the more surprising and exciting beers that I've had in a while. It takes Old Heathen up several notches. It may not be as good as KBS, but it isn't too far off IMO. And for the money, it's well worth it."
"This beer pours nearly opaque dark brown color. The head is a half inch of tan foam that recedes quickly into a thin ring of lacing around the edges of the glass. The aroma is of chocolate, oak, roasted malt, graham cracker, and vanilla extract. There is some nice complexity to the aroma, but for some odd reason I just don't find it to be all that appealing. The taste is of roasted malt with a hint of wood, and cocoa powder. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a texture that comes across as watery for an Imperial Stout. Overall, this beer just doesn't do it for me. I can't see myself drinking it again."
"Notes: Heresy is a good beer, but I wonder if the brewery got the barrels from a reliable source. Were these charred American oak barrels or French Oak purchased from Chateau Latour? This full bodied brew is decent, and is a great offering. I just expected something a bit different."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side and carbonation is a little above average for a barrel aged imperial stout. Drinkability was very good, I really enjoyed it this evening. I particularly liked that the barrel characters complimented the imperial stout, instead of overpowering it. Everything came together very nicely to make an excellent beer overall."
"D- Absolutely delicious. Well done from Weyerbacher. Granted all they did was throw Old Heathen into a barrel but it turned out for the better. The added flavors and the heightened chocolate taste is great. A good example of how barrel experimentation changes a beer. Would be interesting to put this side by side with regular O.H."
"Drinkability- A very enjoyable beer, but would probably not want to have several of these in one night. Still, a little more drinkable than the average bourbon aged stout."
"Drink- For an extra this was an awesome thing to get. An RIS from the east coast that was easy to drink, flavorful and enjoyable."
"D -- Definitely worth picking up, not for everyone everyday; but very solid."
"Drinkability suffers from a sweetness that sets in after half a bomber. Not noticeable in the beginning, but very much apparent towards the end. At which point you reach for a Heffeweizen to clean your palate."
"Drinkability -- It's not bad, but this beer gets edged out by so many other BA Imperial Stouts. I'm normally a fan of Weyerbacher, but this was a bit of a dud for me."
"Mouthfeel is nice and robust but not too much. Definitely a sipping beer for me so I wouldnt consider it highly drinkable as if I was going to drink 4 of them, but very drinkable to enjoy one or two over the course of an evening."
"The wood really comes through in this one, to the point where it takes over the beer too much for my liking. If it was a lilttle sweeter and less woody wine flavors I'd probably like it more."
"D: Very drinkable, even enjoyable ... but not world-class."
"D-- Quite nice. Well hidden ABV and not a massive bourbon bomb. Like that the bourbon more secondary and the oak is more obvious. Now how the heck do I get more of it."
"D: This isn't the greatest imperial stout out there and I was a little disappointed with the taste (compared to the smell). But there's something to be said about a very drinkable, somewhat flavorable BA imperial stout. At 8%, I could drink a couple of these and still remember my name. For that reason, it got higher marks here."
"A black pour with a two-finger head, some retention and no lacing. The nose is full of cocoa and some vanilla from the oak. The taste has a bit more complexity to it. A huge blast of roasted malts engulfs the palate then it melds away into the delicate flavors of this stout, vanilla, oak, some tannins and lots of chocolate follow through. The carbonation has held up a quite well for a beer that is a year old, in fact it is a bit too much. This beer is a tad on the thin side and could have coated the palate with more depth. Overall, this is a good BA stout, nothing to write home about but not something that has gone astray."
"Wow, I've not been terribly impressed with other Weyerbacher offerings, but this one was a definite winner. Highly recommend it!"
"D - dangerously drinkable. good gateway RIS for folks who aren't fans of the style (yet)."
"D: I would like to compare a fresh one with one that is at least 18 months old. This is a very yummy beer that is not overly complicated or simple. The woodiness seems to be more pronounced than I remember and I could see the aging process causing that. Definitely recommended for any RIS lover. Anyone with a six pack should hold back a couple to experience the aging process. Nice beer, would drink regularly if I could."
"(43rd)"
"Smooth beer with a nice, but not over-powering oak flavor. Might be a nice way to introduce your friends to some bigger beers, but the dry finish and watery feel keep this from shining within the style and just off my list of favorites."
"D: OK drinkability, it was pretty hot feeling so it was harder to get down than some other ones, but at 8% abv it was still pretty drinkable."
"Probably the lightest RIS I've ever had. Not a heavy beer even though it looks like a glass of Coke after its been poured from the bottle. VERY drinkable even at 8% alcohol...read: dangerous. The malt lingers for a cocoa or chocolate finish. Not a huge head when poured but enough for the smell of roasted grains to add to the overall experience"
"Had a bottle at the Farmhouse for $6. This was a simple, but relatively drinkable RIS. There was an interesting chocolate banana flavor as the beer warms, otherwise, there's a balanced toasty vanilla and caramel, cocoa roast. It's not the most complex imperial stout, but it's smooth and makes a pretty decent dessert beer."
"D: Very good for a barrel aged beer, pretty easy to drink but I couldnt get through more than a bottle in one night."
"a wonderful pour with a very assertive head that works its way downward into the black and forms as the bubbles come up to about three fingers. nose of chocolate and bourbon malt. palate is a mild baltic sour hiding in a deep core of malt bourbon bitter warmth."
"Heavier body although slightly light for the style, some dry feel and bitterness linger on the palate. Drinks pretty well for the style, although there's definitely better examples out there."
"D - There's a nice warming quality that this has, and it's pretty easy to drink."
"Very enjoyable and rather smooth. Booze is slightly warming but not obstructive. Solid beer and definitely recommended."
"I believe this is a better beer than Old Heathen."
"12oz bottle. Pours a black viscous liquid that disappears in an instant. Minimal lacing. Aromas of chocolate and roasted malts. A nice coffee smell as well. Taste has a dark chocolate flavor to it. A bit of a coffee aftertaste. Not picking up on too much of an Oak flavor. This brew has a nice heavy quality to it. A good sipper and the flavors blend together nicely. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall this was quite enjoyable, and redeemed Weyerbacher to some degree for me, even though it wasn't a particularly great beer. I'd love to try this fresh/young."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a light, almost creamy feel and carbonation level. I'm not totally sold on whether having this brew via different presentations (tap, nitro, bottle) changes it all that much. In this case the feel has been altered a bit by the nitro. Overall, this is just a solid brew that I believe to be under appreciated. The list goes on for other beers in this catrgory that get hyped up and over exaggerated. I'm glad this is regularly available."
"D-the alcohol hits quickly but its a quite a nice beer to sip down! the distinct taste stays and is enjoyed throughout the drink."
"Drinkability is awesome. The delicious smell and the pleasing taste meld together to create a very pleasurable drinking experience. The ABV, while present, is never obtrusive and serves to complement the overall flavors of this brew. From previous reviews, it would seem that Heresy benefits from the mellowing effects of aging. Not sure how old mine was, but I'm glad it seems to have a least a few years on it."
"Pours a het black, viscous color with s light cappuccino colored head. The label reads aged in oak barrels and I get the qualities of oak. A good amount of vanilla and some bourbon too though I am not sure if this is a bourbon barrel. Either way it's got vanilla, oak, molasses, sugar cane, roasted chocolate notes. Not really coffee forward, though it does have soke bitterness onnthe backend slightly. There is a real big boozy flavor, like whiskey burn almost that is not integrated well into this beer at all. Mouthfeel is medium bodied for a ris but it's got a big dry alcohol burn on the finish. Not the most drinkable and the 8 percent abv is not hidden well at all. Nice beer, not really good on it's own, but I did pair it later with chili which was fantastic. Worth a shot, but really needs some age one it I think."
"Poured into Weyerbacher Verboten glass. Very dark with small 1/2 finger tan head. Good lacing. The bourbon is very present in this bottle. Dominates the smell. Taste wise the oak and bourbon also really come through, I just don't like it. Unfortunately not what I'm looking for in a beer although I do think that they achieved what they were out for when aging their stout in bourbon barrels."
"D - Ok, pretty good but this is a big beer with a lot of flavors. One glass is enough for me."
"D - It's high at 8 ABV, but it tastes even higher. This one would be rough to do too much."
"Drinkability: tasty and relatively low alcohol for a RIS. I'm quite enjoying the one in front of me, thank you very much."
"I'm gonna have to give this baby a tasty noms."
"D: One of the best D**M beers I've had in a long time. If HERESY was a woman, I would divorce my wife and marry her."
"M: Smooth, lighter and less syrupy than many examples of a RIS, but maybe too light and not hearty enough."
"Pours black with 2-3 fingers of dark tan head. Smells are booze, oak, dark fruits like figs and hints of chocolate. I taste oak and bourbon at the front, with some vanilla and spice and everything nice, man this is good! Mouthfeel is chewy and drinkability is great. Old Heathen is a really good beer, but this is a great beer! Man, I wish I could get this in Indiana!"
"Overall impression: Forgettable, could use a few tweaks. Not recommended."
"D: Overall a surefire hit in my book. Perfect balance of flavor and bourbon. I will have to pick up more of this soon."
"O - Really nice oak-aged Stout, not on par with KBS but a nice substitute nonetheless."
"Good stout, classic flavors, a bit more buttery than average. Exactly what you want from a stout."
"Pours a cola black with a nice 2 finger head (man, this never gets old...) that recedes fairly quickly. Initial aroma is an almost astringent chocolate, coffee nose. Its not a smooth nose off the bat, it has a bite to it, and not necessarily in a good way. Taste is of chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, and a hint (just a hint) of licorice. Mouthfeel, I have to say this is where this beer falls off. It's just too thin for an oak aged imperial stout. It has almost a cola like mouthfeel with the carbonation that quickly withers away. There's just not a lot complexity here and I was really hoping and wanting more."
"D: Pretty good drinkability for a barrel aged RIS. Alcohol/bourbon is slightly noticeable in the finish, nowhere near hot though."
"D: This is a sipper, as most Imperial stouts are. But the barrel aging ensures that you won't slam a 4 or six pack down in one session. A very nice treat. Would love to drink this around a camp fire in the winter! A great treat from Weyerbacher."
"D: No problem drinking this one and I am very glad that I have two more in the cellar!"
"D: I would drink this plenty if I could get it easily. A easy drink for the appearance and ABV. Also good flavors that call the palate back for more."
"Drinkability: Really like the oak-aging on this one, as it really elevated the base Old Heathen. First Weyerbacher brew I have had to really impress me."
"Slightly creamy, no boozy aftertaste, dangerously drinkable. Full bodied with pleasant medium carbonation, which I appreciate in a heavy dark beer much as this. Weyerbacher is improving each and every year as they grow/expand and I have enjoyed growing up/developing my beer appreciation/enjoyment in parallel with their development."
"I found this one to be quite tasty.. Not a world class brew but still a dang nice beer.."
"A pretty average RIS. The oak aging doesn't add much. It seems the base for this could use some refining as well. Drinks fine, but to me not worth the price tag. Way too many better brews in this category. Glad I only picked up a single bottle."
"The heresy is so egregious that lightning splits the sky above. Bwa-ha-ha-ha! Ahem... This beer pours an opaque black-brown topped by a quickly dissipating finger or so of ecru micro-foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, vanilla, molasses, oak, and a tinge of bourbon. The taste emphasizes the vanilla, roasted malts, and bourbon, while the chocolate is toned down and dried out. There is an ever-so-slight sour-ish tinge at the end, possibly the by-product of the barrel and some age. The body is a very light heavy (or a heavy medium...it's tough to decide), with a light carbonation and a silky smooth feel. Overall, a solid barrel-aged stout: not the finest, but certainly nowhere near bad. Get some!"
"A great barrel aged beer from a great brewery. This was my first beer craft beer I ever experienced and I love coming back to it again and again."
"D: another delicious bourbon aged stout. Not as balanced as some of the heavy hitters in the bourbon aged beer world (i.e. KBS, BCS, BCBCS) but good nevertheless"
"Overall a nice barrel aged stout and for the availability (seasonal and relatively inexpensive) a good RIS to enjoy periodically though now that I've tried it I'm not sure I'd seek it out again."
"I found this beer harder to drink than weyerbachers quad and will definitely be avoiding it."
"D - i hope my review doesn't come off to look like i'm bashing this because i am not.. this is probably the 5th four pack of these i've bought.. sometimes i just want a smooth stout and it's perfect for a hot summer nite like tonite.. but most nites i probably want a little more flavor... a little more hoppiness.. but this is okay.. good job weyerbacher!"
"D: I've been wanting to try this for a while, and the price doesn't match the taste. But, this is a mediocre to decent attempt."
"Not a bad beer, it's just once something smells like fresh paint it can't taste good again. Anyone up for a trade?"
"This is a strange one for me - not very much like any other stout I've had before. Unsure if there's something a bit off about my bottle or if that is just how this one tastes. Regardless, it is an interesting beer - glad I was able to try it, but not sure i'd seek it out again."
"Pours a very dark brown with a wet ecru head. Distinct oaky aroma with chocolate and a woody smokey note. Flavor is dark chocolate, coconut, licorice, and a decent roasted coffee note with some bitterness. Silky smooth mouthfeel, maybe a little thin. Pretty good."
"D - I could have a couple of these but not an all night drink."
"From reading older reviews (especially those of the brothers), I'm guessing Weyerbacher has improved the recipe through the years to create a better balance and better body."
"D - Decently drinkable for thie style"
"This is a confusing one. A lot of what it does is done really, really well. At the same time, the feel is a bit too light, and the alcohol is just a juggernaut that doesn't allow the numerous, beautiful flavors to shine. The boozy aroma is nice, because the bourbon character is strong and rich, while the stout notes at least stay present. In the taste, the alcohol just kind of wrecks everything. It's still an above average beer, but it leaves me wanting more (wanting *something else*)."
"Overall: Overall the beer is very good. The beer is very beer has a great balance of flavors that makes it extremely drinkable. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who likes a good stout."
"Notes: Pity, this starts hitting all the right notes, and mind you it remains pretty good, but the expectations of something truly remarkable subside a bit as soon as the aroma goes shy and the body feels not as sturdy as it could."
"D- for the style I would say that it drinks really easy. With that being said, there are plenty others that I would seek out first."
"Really darn smooth feel, as well. The alcohol, even at 8%, doesn't factor all that much into the overall taste and, therefore, this is dangerously drinkable. 2 or 3 and you're solid."
"D - Nicely balanced and easy to drink. No overpowering flavors, ABV normal for the style; I could go for two."
"Overall, pretty disappointed. Started out great with some much aroma then just boring to finish."
"D - A nice and fairly subtle oak aged offerings which is a welcome departure from a lot of what's available on the market... Quaffable, even at 8.5% ABV... A vast improvement over its rather bland non-oaked counterpart, Old Heathen..."
"Really complex and a unique beer that goes down smooth like a great after dinner drink. Not one to pound all night, but a definite beer to seek out and savor."
"D - Decent barrel aged stout. Not too hot but plenty of boozy notes to scratch that itch. A decent bang for your buck but not an extraordinary beer. Worth trying but I wouldn't go crazy seeking it out."
"D: Deceivingly drinkable, since it is a stout, with a relatively higher abv than your average beer, but not as hot or heavy as one might expect. I could have a few of these, which I look forward to do on the next beer purchase."
"Pours a uniform coffee-black with a short-lived creamy tan head, leaving an angelic ring of foam about two minutes from the pour. ""Angelic"" is the operative word here, as this beer is nothing short of heavenly. Immediately to the nose comes alcohol and dark fruit, especially raisins, prunes, and red apple. A subtle spiciness permeates the aroma, not unlike cumin and cinnamon, reminiscent of a fresh apple pie. Slightly thinner than many imperials I have tried, with very light lacing. Hits the palette with immediate strong bittersweet chocolate and cinnamon. Also, vanilla, mallow, and a very slight bitterness of a weak black coffee. A subtle finish of dates, licorice, and alcohol soon follows. Mouthfeel is smooth with immediate but subtle brown sugar sweetness with hints of molasses, followed by a residual fuzzy dryness. Overall this is a fantastic and complex beer, and in the running for my favorite imperial stout. As I write, a delayed and delightful aftertaste of spicy Cabernet is hitting the nose. A lovely, lovely beer."
"That said, an ""easy drinking"" barrel-aged stout, as the ABV is pretty manageable. Not a bad one to have in the fridge."
"D: Definitely worth a try and by no means a bad beer. Just an average RIS when RIS's should be anything BUT average."
"Recieved via trade with richbrew. Strong pour from 12oz bottle to snifter. Very black with thin mocha head. Malty, dark fruit, bitter chocolate, and roasted malts. Flavors follow nose with some barrel aging. Medium to full bodied and the obvious light carbonation for impys. Very drinkable- I loved this offering!"
"22oz. bomber: this one pours a vary dark, opaque brown color. There was a bit of a light brown head on it that doesn't leave any lacing. This one has a full nose. Some vanilla, oak, chocolate and a whiff of alcohol to the nose. For an an Imperial stout, it has a medium body. The flavor is good, but I think it suffers a bit from the lack of a fuller body. Vanilla, chocolate and maybe some faint fruits. It is just a little sweet. Decent, but there are better RIS' out there."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a small goblet at the Lion's Pride. The beer has a very dark brown color. The foamy head is also brown, and it leaves some patchy lacing as it recedes. This beer is very opaque; no light whatsoever can get through. It looks like a good RIS should look. Most of the aroma is made up of a tasty, warm bourbon smell. I can also make out toasted malts and some oakiness, which was probably infused in the barrel aging process. This is what I think a bourbon barrel aged stout should smell like. The taste is immediately sweet, with a bit of crystal sugar that I can pick up as soon as the beer touches my tongue. This sweetness is quickly overpowered by all of the other flavors this beer has. I can taste smooth chocolate, toasted malts, and a good bourbon character. The sweetness is detectable again in the aftertaste, but also present is dark chocolate bitterness and bourbon. This is a very tasty stout. The beer is sticky and sweet, but not exceptionally full-bodied. There is a low level of carbonation. The bourbon gives each sip a slight burn, but it isn't that bad at all. I find the balance of sweetness and ABV to be quite good. In fact, for such a strong flavored beer, this is quite drinkable. My one glass goes down very well. I don't think I would have more than one or two servings of this beer in an evening because it is fairly intense; it's worth savoring. I want to seek out and pick up a few bottles of this to have on hand."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Not the best in the style, but still a good example. Good to try at least once if you have access. Not worth having to trade for."
"Overall, its not bad, but I'm not terribly impressed either."
"Good imperial stout, mild oak character. This beer pours a healthy black with deep ruby highlights around the edges. The aroma is rich with brown sugar, some roast and a fair bit of fruity malt. There's a touch of oak, but it's milder than expected. The flavor is sweet with an odd finish. It's a good sweet, mild-ish impy stout. The feel is a tad under-carbonated, but it works fairly well with the flavor."
"Well, after hearing/reading such good things, I was disappointed to say the least. This is the initial review, so I'll try it again when I get back to the east coast and see if things change."
"Overall, a very good beer, one I would love to have after a nice dinner in place of dessert or paired with a vanilla ice cream. Not quite living up to the price tag to put it in the rotation, but one well worth a try."
"Pours pitch black, with a light collar of espresso colored foam sitting on top. Roasted malt, black coffee, oak, vanilla and milk chocolate on the nose. The taste is pretty similar to the nose, with the good roasty malt flavors accented nicely by oak, bourbon, milk chocolate and a bit of coconut. The oak aging works really well on this one; a huge improvement over Old Heathen."
"As stouts go, Heresy is fruity and sweet. I did not taste any coffee or chocolate. It's a good after-dinner sipper."
"D: For an imperial stout, it's relatively easy to drink. Any traces of alcohol are very well hidden."
"Overall, a really solid beer and I'm am sad to see it has been retired. If you happen to see one, pick it up while you still can."
"D- its was alright but in a world full of stouts in and out of wood this was alright."
"Drinkability- very enjoyable and one that I could see having more then one of in a session, its a very nice beer with an enjoyable and nice change of pace from some of the overally bitter and to hopped russian imperials, more sweet the dry but not cloying at all, easy smooth drinking with a taste though not super powerful that really grows on you as you go, one I would probably try again"
"Cheers!"
"Well done, Weyerbacher. It'd be nice to try a stout designed particularly for barrel aging rather than a preexisting product that's been barrel aged."
"Drinkablility is alight, pretty dissapointing RIS."
"Overall, I was a bit disappointed by this beer. It didn't compete with the other RISs that I have had. Relatively drinkable, but not something I want to much of."
"Very drinkable for the style, and especially a bourbon -bal aged version. I have two more of these in the cellar and would like to see what this beer does with a little age."
"D: This has a very mellow flavor profile. I'm impressed by how drinkable and smooth they managed to brew a 'big' beer in an 'extreme' style. Quite an accomplishment."
"Thanks to gamanley for the bottle."
"SkÅL!"
"D: An average RIS that I feel tries to go over the top with complexity and strength, but ends up failing simply because of too much booze. Chocolate malt characteristics that would have worked greatly to balance the taste, are, as stated before, lacking. Not a bad beer by any means but not one that I'll be dying to try again."
"Cheers!"
"D: Not a bad beer, and one of the better beers I've had from Weyerbacher. The alcohol is well hidden, so no complaints there."
"Taste is surprisingy not too boozy, it's very rich and complex with an initial sharp bite that actually finishes very cleanly. There is a light woody flavor and subtle bourbon that's not as strong as the nose would lead on to. Mouthfeel is decent although a bit light."
"Definitely one of my favorite Bourbon flavored stouts."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slowly fading creamy head.Aroma is chocolate and whiskey.Taste is chocolate,sweet cream and burnt malts.Very smooth for a higher alcohol beer.I would highly recommend this beer and it is a no brainer that I would purchase this again."
"I can't believe I gave a beer two 5's"
"overall: i liked it, not much seperates this beer from most others of its type except that redish head but if you like this kind of beer give it a try. bought it at a beer store for 3$ for a single bottle and would have it at a bar if it was on tap."
"Overall, a decent beginner's RIS"
"Pours a dark black color with a huge poof of brown head, quickly diminishing into a small cap, decent retention, minimal lacing. Smell is of dark roasted grains supported by whiffs of burbony booze and dry wood, faint touch of chocolate and prune. Taste is a rather mellow blend of burnt grains, dark chocolate, burbon, dry wood with neary a hint of the dark fruit that i detected in smell. No vanilla from the oak - odd. I was expecting bold and got mellow. Dry, fuller side of medium bodied, slightly creamy, minimal boozy aftertaste, some sips border on watery. I sampled this on draft recently at a beer fest and it was almost like a different brew. Good beer, just different from my expectation - could use a little more assertiveness. Thanks to philbe311 for picking this one up for me."
"Overall, very drinkable with a decent body."
"D: lower abv for RIS make this one's drinkability super high. this is one awesome brew goes down like water. I got to hunt down some more of this one to lay down. bet it ages well."
"I feel that Heresy might benefit from a year in the cellar, but fresh, it's still a tasty offering from Weyerbacher."
"The oak character is mild and the alcohol is masked well in the flavors. Not anything I would try again, only because I am not a stout fan, but this is a quality stout. The flavors remind me a belgian dubel brew. Definitely worth a try if you are a stout fan."
"Overall, a much better beer than the base Old Heathen. It has more complexity and depth, more flavor and less alcohol. All around, it's a better beer and one I enjoyed much more after it had been aged in barrels."
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer. I like the malt complexity and how the wood aging adds a significant amount of character to the beer. That said, you could nit-pick the beer by saying that it would be nice if it had more alcoholic presence, more age, etc...but regardless, it is a good beer and one that I wouldn't mind drinking again."
"overall, I quite liked this little guy. packed full of flavor, but at 8%, it won't make your head spin. it'll just make you nice, warm and happy."
"Pours a deep, opaque black-brown with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled light tan head, quite appealing. Aroma is strong, smoky and fruity with a good alcohol ting like brandy and a subtle hint of unsweetened chocolate. Flavor is more like a barleywine than a stout, fruity and chocolaty with a brandy-like bite. The fruit and chocolate aspects actually complement each other rather than fighting it out on the tongue. There are also hints of smoke or charcoal and licorice. Texture is smooth as milk, yet edgy and a little tingly."
"Had a small sample of this at the Weyerbacher Brewery and it didn't really appeal to me. Had a full glass tonight and now have a greater appreciation for it once my taste buds started to settle in. A very noteworthy beer, worth checking out."
"D - Well if it gets cheaper I will have more of it but founders IRS it's my go to beer."
"Very nice mouthfeel. Definitely a keeper."
"Drinkability: A great stout, to be sure; smell, flavor and mouthfeel are all there, but the ABV is too high for too much and it could be blended just a bit better; definitely worth picking up though."
"D- Lower ABV for the style, not completely heavy on the stomach and quite smooth and well balanced all make this beer pretty drinkable."
"Great job Weyerbacher! Keep up the good work."
"D- This is a great treat of a beer. Out of the BA Impy's, this has to rank up there in the top 5 for me. A must try."
"All in all, it took me an hour to finish this thing. Maybe my tastebuds were whacked, or maybe I got a bad bottle, but this really wasn't very tasty. I had a similar experience with Peche Mortel, but upon trying again, the second bottle was much better -- so maybe I'll do the same thing with Heresy and give it a second chance."
"I like this. I got a single from Hop City for $1.99 and they seem to have many, many six packs of this stuff stacked up front. This Friday, I'm getting me some. Delicious!"
"A very good example of the style, less hoppy and a little less strong than an American Imperial Stout. Great dark color, very good roasty flavor and aroma. I would like to drink this one late at night if I can find it in bottles."
"D – One of the best stouts I've had in a while. In a crowded field (RIS), full of spectacular examples, this beer is definitely worth savoring."
"M - Nice and bubbly while still being velvety smooth."
"I would definitely try this--well worth it."
"D: A rock solid, drinkable, well made beer."
"That said, I really enjoy the flavor of this beer, and despite the ""technical"" non-perfection I find it to be quite delicious. I would happily drink some more, and hope to some time."
"Much thanks to thechrislife for this extra."
"Pour is jet black with a tight caramel head that dissipates quickly.  Nose is assertive bourbon, slightly harsh, heavy roast, slightly acrid.  Ouch, taste is rough, heavily acrid, burnt malts, extremely sweet finish, body is thin, empty in back, light carb, slick oily feel."
"D - wow. give me another. stat. 4.5"
"O- An incredible smelling and tasting beer, but not quite perfect on the mouthfeel. Still a really awesome beer."
"4/4/4/4.5/4.5"
"very enjoyable, although not my favorite. could be becuase it followed beatification..."
"Overall - I'm really digging this beer, very warming and tasty. I want to grab a few of these and add them to the cellar as I can only see them getting better with age. This is exactly what I expect when I think of a bourbon barrel stout and I'm glad I've tried it."
"Very slick mouthfeel and excellent drinkability. Had at a bar, so no detailed review."
"The Weyerbacher Heresy pours a viscous black in the glass with a thick, creamy brown froth, good lacing, and good retention. Pronounced aromas of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, oak, cinnamon, espresso (mocha), some subtle dark berries, roasted hazelnuts, & did i mention chocolate? Full, rich, sweet, and perfect for a cold winter evening! Everything found on the nose is present on the palate with a well integrated alcohol presence, slight hop bitterness, definite roastiness, creamy mouthfeel, & long finish. The overall brilliance of the beer is that it's full, rich, sweet, balanced, and everything that anyone could look for in a RIS! An absolute triumph! Highest recommendation!"
"The mouthfeel is smooth, soft and milky. This all leads to a very drinkable beer for those who favor deep, rich stouts."
"MF/D: Motor oil, velvety, not dry at the finish like I thought it would be."
"Reminds me more of a baltic porter than an imperial stout. Good, but not outstanding."
"12oz bottle into a snifter (2009). Straight pours deep opaque black with a 1.5-finger tan head that is thick but somewhat soapy that doesn't stick around much and could be darker. The aroma is a bit of harsh bourbon and some oak - some alcohol, not super deep or complex, but with obvious vanilla, wood, and tannins. The flavor is big sweet malt up front with a hint of sour followed quickly by mild oak and bourbon characteristics including vanilla, wood, and tannins. This is then followed by stout flavors including mild dark chocolate and an obvious dose of coffee flavors. I really enjoy the mouthfeel and general way this beer goes down - really smooth and just feels great in the mouth for some reason - perhaps addition of oats or maybe the aging?"
"This one took me by surprise. The first sip had me wondering what I got myself into. By the 4th sip I realized what this was meant to be: A sipping beer. If any of you are cigar affectionados, this will go great with one."
"drinkability: a solid imperial stout, intresting flavor, way to heavy though. solid beer."
"Poured a dark, thick brown with almost no head that dissipated to nothing. The aroma was sweet with a medicinal quality. The taste was coffee, some chocolate and that medicine thing (may have been alcohol or the oak, but off turning none the less) . The feel was full bodied with a lot carbonation. Drinkability was reasonable good. If not for the medicinal quality, I think Heresy would have ranked up there with Old Raspy and Stone RIS. I did buy a four pack, so I think the next one may sit in the cellar for about a year before I try again."
"The bomber I had was very old and had gone south. This was newer and much better. Definitely recommended."
"d- drinkable,"
"Dark as night with a creamy, tan head. Pretty minimal retention but a decent amount of lacing. Aromas of sweet chocolate with a hint of darkness to it and a subtle roasted backbone. Beautiful complexity in the flavor with chocolate, caramel, toffee, and molasses notes all interwoven and countered by a dark cherry fruit quality. The alcohol comes through perhaps a bit too much but it finishes smooth. A phenomenal representation of the RIS style and certainly up there with the best of them. It actually drank a lot like Old Rasputin in my estimation. Highly recommended. A must try for RIS fans."
"would go back to this again,especially if i'm in the mood for an oak aged RIS at a reasonable price"
"Creamy body with a thick and full-bodied, oaky flavors with a touch of crispness on the back end. Finishes well. Carbonation moderate with a strong balance of sweet and sultry flavors."
"Nice stout, well balanced."
"The bourbon was too much here, period. Will not be buying again."
"D - great stout easy drinking up there as would definately have another really liked this."
"d: very strong and intense flavors but very good"
"This one looks pretty much like most other RIS's, dark, opaque black. Head is smallish and tan, leaving a bit of lacing. Heresy has a great aroma to it, with some wood, bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla coming through. It isn't as robust as others like BCS or KBS, however. I like the way it tastes too--a decent amount of oakiness, some bourbon, chocolate, and a bit of an herbal finish. Medium-light body that's coating, lingering aftertaste. Easy drinker for a big stout, tasty treat that's worth trying."
"Drinkability: A very tasty RIS with a nice barrel character. I didn't get too much oak or bourbon, but the vanilla was large. I definitely liked the smell the best (almost gave it a 5.0), but all in all this was a solid beer. I wouldn't mind getting this one again."
"D: As I noted above, there's a lot of good flavor here, but I feel they're a little out of balance: a little too much booze and sweetness in the flavor for a stout in my opinion. This is definitely an interesting beer and I can see some people liking the flavors found here. It's worth trying. Personally, however, I think I'll stick to more traditional stouts."
"Drinkability this is about as good as it gets for a RIS this is a definite stand by in this style category for me"
"The mouthfeel borders on tart. For an RIS, that's weird. For its character, I credit it. The unique sweet/sour play comes partly from oak and what sense like raisin. The liquid feels like a raisin RIS. Is that possible? It's an odd beer out of Pennsylvania that is just unique enough to be worth trying. Different, simple, and enjoyable combine to produce good drinkability for a comparatively blah beer."
"No doubt this one is oak aged. It really dominates here rather than compliments this beer. Overall, good but there's plenty missing here."
"Beautiful looking imperial, with a pitch black body and a deep mocha head. Nice retention and lace. The aroma is muted, even after the too-cold-pour warms up. Aside from the expected roasted malt notes there's a touch of treacle and a spicy sweetness. The taste, however, is not muted, and there's nothing wrong with this. Its a by the book imperial stout, and doesn't call upon any extra bells and whistles to enhance its character. Strong roasted coffee notes dominate at first, before giving way to bittersweet chocolate, and a decently bitter, warming finish. Medium full body has a pleasant creaminess to it, and the restrained carbonation is about right. Obviously not one of the big imperials that will blow your taste buds away, but its well-constructed and I liked it."
"Understated alcohol, pleasant carbonation, and purple Bubble Yum flavors slapped by an oak plank yield an easy drinker."
"For an imperial stout, the smooth oak and nice mouthfeel make it relatively drinkable."
"D: i tell you what...this beer holds its own and needs a bit of work at the same time, some elements are awry within (especially for an RIS). In any event, the flavors are nice and tasty. I would buy again...but would reach for others before settling on this"
"Drinkability: This is a really good beer when compared to the broad category of ""beer"". When compared to RISs, its more like average. The bourbon hints make this more interesting than the regular Old Heathen for me. My main problem with this is the less than aggresive smell and the too-thin mouthfeel. I'll let the rest of these age."
"Rich chocolate roast, deep malt, ripe raisin. Soft hints of alcohol. Soft bitterness. Notes of dark chocolate. Soft carbonation. Soft herbal spiciness. Dark non-sweet chocolaty stout. Sadly no indication of oak, but still quite good. Tastes good. Feels good. Good drinkability."
"I'm rather pleased with my mini Weyerbacher imperial stout tasting. Good stuff, and I'll hopefully be picking up more for cellaring."
"D - While the body is thick, the taste is somewhat watery and not roasty enough to be a great stout. However, this is a great beer. If they reclassified this, it might be better. However, don't hesitate to try, but don't expect a stout."
"A good budget edition of the barrel-aged stout."
"D-Given the style which I don't think is meant to be a session beer, this beer goes does rather easy 2 or 3 three tops for me me but the style dictates that. Really good beer"
"D) A decent brew but not a standout."
"I think this one benefits from not being so strong, but they also have a nice balance here. That oakiness is just barely"
"D: Wouldn't have more than one or two. ABV is 8 so be careful."
"First time I've tried this one but it wont be the last,way above average Russian Imperial Stout."
"Weyerbacher Heresy is a solid black ale with a huge, creamy, light brown head that has outstanding retention and leaves thick sheets of lacing on the glass. There is coffee, salmiakki, chocolate and wood in the aroma. It's pretty full bodied, smooth and creamy with a crisp finish that has a little graininess to it. It's pretty delicate for an imperial stout. There's lots of wood resin in the flavor and not a lot of sweetness. There is a note of coffee and a hint of licorice. It has super balance. This beer is downright chuggable."
"What would this beer be like without the oak? I bet the lighting bolt found on the label of the beer had something to do with zapping the beer of its power potential."
"Dark as night, very ominous pour. The aroma is oaky with lots of vanilla and a touch of coffee, but the taste falls short. Not as big as I would like. There are some definite notes of coffee and vanilla, but there is also an off sour taste that is off putting. Mouthfeel is light and doesn't coat the mouth the way a powerful stout should. All of that said, this is easy to drink. It's not bad by any means. Recommended."
"Overall a very nice barrel aged version of their Old Heathen that adds lots of complexity. I really dug this beer and would be glad to drink it anytime. Very good from tap."
"Got this beer about 6 weeks ago at Sam's in Chicago. Nice stuff. Poured with an off-white to light tan head and a bit of lace. Opaque brown. Heavy dark chocolate aroma rounded out with coffee, toffee, caramel, malt, barest hint of hop. Flavor's similar. Body is good- natural carbonation, decent mouth. finish is easy. Session beer but for the sneaky alcohol"
"birthday beer is always good beer! this one pours out almost like motor oil, very dark and thick. holds onto it's dark chocolate tan head all the way down. smells were of bitter hops, chocolate, and alcohol. nice creamy and chocolate tones mixed in with roasted nuts and a small dose of alcohol heat. this is one for a cold new england evening for sure."
"D- This one's a sipper for sure. I'll have the next one with a steak or something else from the grille."
"A sub par imperial stout, wont be buying this again."
"D- I'd call this a sipper- which is good because the warmer it gets, the more flavors jump out."
"The mouthfeel is rather blah on this RIS. Medium to full bodied, little carbonation and goes down a bit watery. Short to medium finish of B-level coffee and malt roast. I drank one of these pretty quickly but am looking to different beer on my next."
"The drinkability is certainly affected by the whisky, but the beer was smooth and pleasant."
"D: not that high, a bit sweet"
"Not bad drinkability, maybe a little boozy for 8% though. Another good Weyerbacher beer."
"Overall a very tasty RIS."
"12 oz. Near black pour, with a little dark tan head. Some lacing. Aroma is roast malt, dark chocolate and some vanilla/oak. Good thick mouthfeel. Tastes heavy roast malt and coffee. Accented with chocolates, molasses. Oak, vanilla and caramel notes from the barrel is just barely present, this does slightly increase as it warms. Nice old coffee with some caramel creamer finish. Not a ton of barrel in my opion to differentiate from the regular Old Heathan, which makes this still pretty good. A real well balanced Imperial, drinkable with that lowish 8 abv. Unfortunately for this, I will be having a Founders Imperial Stout after this, which is going to be a bit much for this to compare to."
"Poured into my new Duvel tulip glass. Appears dark as night with a quickly fading film of dark tan that sticks to the edges of the glass on the way down. Smells like caramel, roasted coffee, malts, oak, vanilla, and cream. Upon hitting the palate some of these aromas are lost, but the oak character and roasty maltiness is still there and wonderful. Mouthfeel is thick but not syrupy. Drinkability is high for this style, which is dangerous."
"I'm a big fan of oak aged beers of all kind and this one is no exception."
"D- i really like the fact that weyerbacher barrel ages their year round beers and releases them as a seasonal. very cool idea. this beer was better than the non barrel aged one, and something i wish was on the shelves where i live. id like the chance to have this again. very easy to finish and left me wanting another."
"D-I really like the french vanilla notes...there are some many immense impy's out there now and this in no-way compares to those but it is highly drinkable and enjoyable in its own way."
"Drinkability- Heavy ABV and in my opinion not the best example of this style. Worth drinking one though."
"very drinkable for a RIS, i would really like to taste the old heathen, the base of this beer side by side to see the differences. recommend this to all"
"Overall, a great beer!"
"D: Stellar sipper all the way. Nice rep of the style and another great brew from this brewery. More to follow for sure, and for that and this beer...comes recommended."
"Still very enjoyable flavor-wise, etc."
"Overall this is a good beer to introduce barrel-aging as it's very heavy on those aspects. However, it needs a bit more balance to be a really great beer. Worth a shot."
"I had this on tap at Leon's in Decatur GA. The beer is dark brown color, not quite black, with a thin off-mocha foam, no real lacing. The beer smells like roasted malts and a hint of booze, not very strong bourbon aroma but maybe just enough. I get some bitter chocolate and a little coffee bean in the flavor along with the strong roasted malt. The body seems just a little light for the style, well carbonated which maybe is part of what seems a little off. Very good but not substantial feeling. Pretty good but I probably won't get it again with so many great stouts out there."
"Notes: A really accessible RIS, especially if you are turned away by some of the harshness that can be found in this style."
"A new favorite"
"d: good drinkability"
"Drinkability is straight up easy going and warm with bourbon and with sweetened/tinted fruity chocolate. Not bad at all, but there's better. The bourbon is quite nice, its just missing out some on body."
"Drinkability: While I had thought that the Old Heathen had a complex flavor Heresy trumps it easily with the additional complexity introduced by the bourbon barrel aging. At 8% ABV this is a one a night beer to sip slowly and savor. I'm looking forward to next December when I'll be sampling both Old Heathen and Heresy with another 9 months of bottle age."
"D: A really well put together Imperial Stout, definitely a must try if you enjoy this style and enjoy bourbon."
"Pours out a deep black with a nice brown head, which leaves ok lace but doesnt have much retention. The aroma is immediately of alcohol, and maybe bourbon...i wonder if the oak barrels were formerly used for bourbon? The tatse is similar, but has a great vanilla touch to it. Love the oak aging. Good beer."
"Taste is an enigma. Has great flavor, the oak aging really smooths everything out. Some licorice, some vanilla, a bit of coffee and nice smooth roastiness. Oaky, a bit of chocolate as well. Pretty sweet all the way through, not a huge grain sugar sweetness like some, but it's more on the sweeter side than the roasty bitter side. I don't really get that bitter kick in that respect. However, it's really on the lighter side for a big stout. Kinda thin, if not watery. The flavors are great, but there isn't much depth to them, they don't linger to any great extent. It's like stopping after the first 3 acts of a 4 act play. Medium body, very light for a stout. Very drinkable though, top notch. Goes down smooth and easy. The flaws are overlookable for me, and I will try this again. A very sessionable imperial stout."
"D- The drinkability isn't too bad considering the high ABV. It's a sipper, but a tasty one at that. Recommended!"
"D- Off the charts, while usually weary before drinking weyerbacher products, I liked this on first sips and loved it after the bottle was done. A bit light in alcohol for an RIS with a thinner body as well but the taste is there. Will be getting again."
"Drinkability: The high abv makes this a couple then done. The alcohol is well hidden though. This is a sipper and one of Weyerbacher's best offerings. I think this blows away Old Heathen based off of taste. I will have this again."
"D- I like this beer and it's worth a try however its a touch on the sweet side for me to want more than one at a time."
"Big bourbon flavour with a touch of oak. Alcohol also comes through somewhat. The mouthfeel is little on the thin side due to the cask conditioning, i would really like to try this beer on tap or from the bottle. A pretty solid RIS and quite drinkable."
"This is an improvement over Old Heathen, but it's still not a very good beer. The bourbon helps but underneath it's still a watery, uninteresting stout. It's not terrible and the bourbon seems to mask some of the funky off flavors I found in Old Heathen, but I certainly wouldn't call it good. Like most Weyerbacher beers this embodies mediocre. Actually, in a style with so many top notch beers, this is at the bottom of the barrel."
"Medium-full body with some tingle on the tongue from the carbonation. Overall very tasty and quite drinkable...yes I'd like some more. Thanks to leftmindedrighty for this tasty extra!"
"Very smooth for a stout. Medium level of carbonation. Thinner than a typical imperial stout- somewhat crisper as well."
"D - Mouthfeel aside, Heresy is one of the best offerings I've had from Weyerbacher. The bourbon isn't overdone, resulting in an excellent, highly drinkable barrel-aged stout."
"Lots of cocoa. Do you remember taking some of the Hershey powdered chocolate and placing it on your tongue? Here it is. Relatively thin body but the light carbonation gives this a decent mouthfeel. The aftertaste is similar to the flavor of dark chocolate after the swallow."
"No doubt about it, this one wants a year or two of age to mellow and come together before it's ready."
"M/D - Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Thin on the palate. Easy drinker.. so smooth."
" cheers, Teeter"
"I would definitely buy this again."
"D: Very drinkable. Being only 8% for this big of a stout is fantastic. I could easily polish off a 4 pack in.a night (have done it and will again). I look forward to this again next year!"
"D- The price of the 4 pack will keep me from drinking too many of these but if I had unlimited funds I would pick this up everytimeI went to the store."
"D: This is an all around solid russian imperial stout. Personally at 8% I could only take maybe two of these a night, but the go down easy and are a good example of the style."
"I did not expect this beer to be as good as it was. Awesome overall, the price was steep but I would glady get this guy again. Pours a black color with a decent tan head. Smells of sweet malts and chocolate. Taste of sweet chocolate in the background and sweet malts from the oak barrels.. a nice flavor. Mouthfeel has no complaints, very smooth and goes down great. I want another."
"Pours a black opaque color with a modest tan head. Nose is of roasted malts and mild coffee/dark chocolate. A light raisin and oak aroma. Flavor is again roasted malts (coffee). Vanilla bean/oak, but very watery. Body is medium with a low carbonation feel. This beer is boring. It lacks all the adveture and depth a good RIS. Someone hook them up with some unfermentables and complexity."
"D: Wow. Big thumbs up. This just might be my new go-to RIS. It'll definitely be my go-to dessert beer."
"A lot of this beer is pretty standard for the style, not much of it stuck out as a great characteristic or a strength, really.. Its very malty and has a lot of dark fruit flavor and smell to it, similar to a strong bock more so than a RIS.. The mouth is a bit thinner but this adds a bit to the drinkability.. (my girlfriend liked it, and she usually never likes thicker, dark beers),but I found these to be weak points.. Overall Its certainly good, though not great.. I would gladly drink it again and choose it over many other options, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again."
"Pours very dark brown with a nice mocha head. Smell is slight bourbon. Taste is more of the bourbon with a nice hint of vanilla. Good mouthfeel, creamy. Good beer, but not best in class."
"D - Very drinkable for such a big beer. The flavors and complexity lead one to expect a bigger alcohol punch than the relatively modest 8%, but it seems like this allows the beer to remain drinkable while also being more than sufficiently complex. The level of bitterness is also relatively low, and this allows the excellent malty character to shine through. At the back of all of this is a subtle, smooth oak note that is a nice change of pace from the extreme wood flavor that one often sees in barrel aged beers. Overall a very nice, somewhat atypical, Imperial Stout."
"I'm super glad that they weren't selling this in singles, because I will make GREAT use out of the remaining three bottles."
"Although this one is thick and rich enough that you probably wouldn't drink more than one or two, at a time, it's very drinkable. It just goes down so smooth and easy."
"It's a thick feeling beer in your mouth that delivers on the vanilla scent but adds some malt and a rasiny flavor without being overly sweet. You can't sit at the bar all night drinking these, but one or two sure are fun!"
"I poured Heresy from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It is jet black with a thin tan head, minimal lacing. The most dominant smell is sweet whiskey. The brew is sweet and smooth. There are hints of alcohol, oak, smoke and a slight hoppy bitterness. It is a full bodied beer that is meant to be sipped and enjoyed. I really like this one."
"Get it if you can find it."
"A more than decent offering, and a pretty good sipper, but I didn't enjoy it as much as other Weyerbacher brews."
"From notes. On tap. Poured black with minimal head which fell to flimsy ring, no lacing. SMELL of molasses, malty sweetness, roasted grain, and a bit of chocolate. Molasses a bit too dominant or a higher score. TASTE follows the nose. Molasses, malty sweet, and roasted grains blending nicely, with a touch of chocolate as well. Molasses a bit strong, but still very nice. FEEL is medium carbonation, viscous, smooth and oily. Mild bitterness lingers. DRINKS pretty well for a fairly big beer, smooth and pleasant. Not session material, but I'd be pleased to have it again."
"i would drink this again. not the best of its style but it is still pretty good."
"Overall: To me the flavors are muted and not as rich as some RIS. The nose was nicer than the flavor. The mouth feel is a medium to medium light body, with a slight creaminess. The finish is medium light and a tad dry. You can taste the alcohol in the brew. The beer to me seems confused. There is not a complete unity to the brew. When I want a good RIS, I want a complete uniformed and rich in flavor. Don't get me wrong the beer is good but not great."
"This beer is an easily accessible, great mid priced brew. It is one of my favorites of the area. Seek this beer out, its a great all around beer that is easy to kick back."
"Im still quite glad Im able to get Weyerbacher. One of the best east coast breweries. Give me more."
"Poured a deep black with a medium dark brown head that slowly fades. Nose is nice. It has a very rich and malty scent that boasts of chocolate malts and a creamy finish. The oak is highly noticable. Taste is great with a smooth chocolate flavor pretty oaky too. Mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. Excellent beer."
"Notes: Barrel aging completely changed old heathen into a monster, very nice and I'll be back for more. Another extremely flavorful weyerbacher creation."
"In the end, I enjoyed it more than at first... It definitely grew on me."
"This beer pours almost black, but there are red tinges on the edges when held to the light. Head is mocha colored, fizzy and fades immediately to a thin layer, very little lacing left on the glass. Nose is of dark chocolate, coffee and malt with a hint of alcohol. Mild flavor upfront with chocolate malt and a bit of roasted coffee flavor. The finish is smooth with dark chocolate flavors - it's in the finish that you can pick up the oak taste, and some smokiness.Carbonation is medium and tingly and body weight is medium-heavy. Overall, not a bad Stout - I would definitely pick it up again."
"The taste had an oak barrel feel to it, has a metallic taste to it and is extremely heavy...to heavy. It certainly a strong stout."
"Nice full body with minimal carbonation. This was a very drinkable stout. Not overly boozy, and no cloying flavors. As I type this, it has been about 10 minutes since I took the last sip, and I still have a very nice aftertaste. One of the better purchases in this style that I've made in long while. Awfully glad I grabbed a bomber."
"Drinkability: A very good Imperial Stout. The oak notes aren't that noticeable, but I can't really hold that against this beer. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will have it again. An excellent beer for those cold nights by the fireplace."
"Fully opaque black color with zero differentiation throughout, big and frothy head upon the pour with plenty of big ole bubbles, lots of lacing and languidly slow to dissolve. The nose is super-rich sweet coffee ice cream, milk chocolate and carob, soft and creamy presence with raisin and maraschino cherry fruit accents, impressive staying power if monochrome. Full-bodied and even more dependent on coffee, buttered toast, chocolate, caramel flavors. The raisin, date, fig flavors keeps the sweetness coming. The roast subordinate to the toast. Hard to tease out any hop influence. Carbonation could stand to be a little higher. That said, moves well and never gets ""stuck."" Smooth like a road grader came through. Would like more flavor variety but quite satisfying."
"D - I've had RISs that were more and less drinkable than this. So yeah, pretty middle of the road for the style. $3 for a 12 oz. bottle, which I think is a pretty good price."
"Note: as this warmed, the chocolate and coffee flavors began to fade away (aside from the aftertaste), and the dark cherry/vinous flavors really came out. Made it a little more interesting."
"Date consumed: 8 September 2008"
"D: A bittersweet vicsous stout if I've ever had one. Big sections of dark fruit along with coffee and malts and boozy to boot. A different batch each year and different taste as well, so will keep on trying to compare."
"Drinkability is high, I would order again, but I think it is too rich to do more than one in a row."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, but somewhat flat."
"The body is moderate to full. Would like more depth. The carbonation is a bit high as well. Overall I would like a bit more malt and the phenolics and fusels are over the top. But some nice oak characteristics and chocolate notes are a plus."
"It does though come around to invite the tongue back to the party, holding the malty bitterness for minutes afterwards. Hints of powdered cocoa accompany the maltiness, creating a slick mouthfeel that outlasts the rest of the beer. Impressively heavy malts, but a bit of an odd mouthfeel and few other exceptional qualities."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"Pours black with a beautifully tanned head that quickly flattens and vanishes. Caramel chocolate and oak bouquet. Flavor is of black and sour cherries and burnt malt. Leaves a lingering bitter coffee taste. While the beer seems to become more and more bitter the more I have, I can't quite shake the feeling that this is quite an interesting and wonderful beer. There is a darkness here I can appreciate, but I wish they could get it up to around 10% to really get the flavors rocking."
"This is a pretty damn good beer. The chocolate flavors remind me a lot of ST Choklat, though it's better with the added complexity of the oak aging."
"I pick this up in S Jersey this weekend while visiting from the left coast; never having tasted a Weyerbacher beer. I have recently jumped on the oak aged bandwagon, and Stouts are always welcome. Color was fine, red tinged edges but mostly black, aroma was nice, sweet and a bit smokey. Taste and mouthfeel left me slightly dissapointed, a bit thin, sugary, not in the ""classic imperial stout"" style. Perhaps the oak ageing allowed fermentation to continue. Also suprised to see it's only 8%, just creeping into the Imperial range. Drinkable, average, didn't knock my socks off like I hoped it would. I'll definatly try other brews from Weyerbacher, may even grab a few to fly back West with."
"Drinkability: not high at all...but its worth a try"
"A friend bout me a CASE of this. A dark, dark, tan head...thick and viscous. Fantastic smell, like a jack and coke on 'roids. Malty, but with a that 'aged' overtone which seems to cut the sweetness. Smooth flavor, but a syrupy mouthfeel. A bear for a session, but a beautiful sipper. One of the most interesting beers from Weyerbacher."
"Bomber, poured into a snifter. Dark brown pour with a nice medium coffee colored Aroma of coffee and molasses. Taste of almonds, sweet chocolate and faint coffee. Really sweet for an imperial, almost to a fault. Mouthfeel is velvety with a lingering faint bitter chocolate finish."
"D: As a R.I.S. fanatic, I could sip this stuff all night. A delicious treat that isn't too heavy on the alcohol burn, try this one if you get a chance."
"D= This was a real surprise for me. I picked this up in a trade and had zero expectations. Boy was I surprised to find a fantastic flavor profile, great aroma and excellent mouthfeel. Though this is not a ""huge"" RIS, it is no slouch at 8% ABV. Very drinkable!"
"I tend to pick this beer up very rarely, but after sampling it tonight at Winchester Wine and Spirits during their weekly beer tasting, I felt the need to purchase a bottle. The sample I tasted there had this wonderful and unusual flavor of chocolate and peanut butter (ala Reeses). The bottle was poured in to a Duvel snifter. No light could penetrate this beer, black as hell with one fingers worth of light tan head. Dark bitter chocolate, mild whiskey, subtle dark fruit, marshmallow, and a hint of coffee bean come through in the nose. Vanilla is the first flavor to hit the palate, followed by powdered chocolate, black strap molasses and an oak complexity unmatched by some of the best examples of this style. Mouthfeel is hefty, but perhaps a tad light for an oak aged Imperial Stout. Very little hop bitterness comes through, but the malt and oak characteristics make themselves very known. Drinking is good on this beer, although certainly one to sip, as the alcohol is there and will bite you if you're not careful. This is an exemplary stout from Weyerbacher. It might not blow you away, but I would be surprised if it did not at least impress you. Grab a bottle, drink it now, or cellar it, I imagine it will be excellent either way. Cheers"
"Had this on tap, but can't remember where. Probably somewhere in Pennsylvannia. Appearance: small, dark-brown head that completely vanished. Aroma: chocolate, oak, charcoal, burnt coffee. Creamy mouthfeel, soft, no hint of alcohol. very smooth. Pretty good with respect to style."
"Silky sultry mouthfeel, very smooth. Finishes a bit bubbly, tongue and cheeks slowly warm and begin to numb. Very drinkable, great sipper."
"D- This is a nice, chocolaty RIS. The flavors aren't in your face and the ABV is almost undetectable. A very nice brew but not the most impressive I have had. Very similar to Old Heathen (which I have not had in awhile) and much harder to come by. I will probably have this again, but might go for Old Heathen instead because of its availability."
"this one pours black, with thin layer of head that leaves quick. the smell i smild of booze and sweetness. the taste has a sweetness similar to that of bourbon. the alcohol is not noticeable however. it is creamy and drinkable."
"At $6.49 for 26 oz., this was a deal and a definite buy again."
"All in all, I've seen what a Bourbon BBL Imp Stout can be (see Town Hall) and this falls way short of that level."
"Pours a pitch black with a great caramel colored head that goes nowhere fast. Good lacing. Smell is fantastic. Lots of oak and vanilla character, sweet malts, maybe some bourbon, cream. Taste is very sweet, oaky, vanilla notes, not much roastiness in there but lots of malty sweetness. I tend to like my Impy stouts more bold but this is still very pleasant. Mouthfeel is very thick and viscous. Not too much carbonation, slick. Fairly drinkable."
"If this wasnt as sweet, it would be near 5's in all categories. As it stands, it is still a very nice barrel aged beers. Perhaps this one isnt as sweet when consumed fresh; who knows. I plan to find out."
"Wow, this is a great Russian Imperial Stout. Appearance is jet black with a milk chocolate-colored head and some patchy lacing on the side. Aromas are wicked strong with a rich, milk chocolate smell wrapped in a woody/alcohol texture. Taste is really, really sweet. We are talking tons of chocolate, coffee, cocoa, sugars, vanilla, malt. Exceptional mouthfeel allows this to be really creamy; great desert-oriented drink. Overall, a great, great stout."
"D- Although it isn't as big as a lot of other RIS's out there, the alcohol is exceptionally well-hidden and the body isn't too heavy for another."
"d: Weyerbacher does barrel aging right. It's subtle and serves to enhance rather than overwhelm. The problem is that Old Heathen is a very good but not great RIS. Still, this is well worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is a little heavy but Heresy is very drinkable for a high ABV RIS. Great beer. I hope when Weyerbacher hits Wisconsin in the coming weeks that this is among the gems that arrive."
"Drinkability is moderate; 8.0% ABV is pretty high, and this beer is really heavy, it fills you up. Overall, this is a good beer and I enjoyed it, but I don't know if I will revisit it."
"Oak is nicely balanced, not too strong but nicely flavorful. An expectedly full flavorful beer with a nicely approachable character. Tasty and nicely sippable only impeded by abv."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass. This beer pours some of the blackest liquid I've ever seen poured out of a glass bottle. Jet black with a 1 inch dark tan head. The aroma is chocolate, vanilla, cream and a bit of oak. The taste is huge up front, with chocolate malts dominating the profile but still leaving enough room for the caramel, vanilla and oak to come through also. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thin. I definitely thought that this beer would have a bit more body to it. The drinkability is still good. I actually think that I like Old Heathen just a bit better but I definitely wouldn't turn down another bottle."
"D: Tasty and rich, but not overpowering. I thought this might have been a bit ""heavier," but it really gives way to an enjoyable and flavorful beer."
"Definitely dominated by the Bourbon barrel aging, but it keeps from being harsh (especially in the nose where it is quite smooth). Not bad and perhaps even a bit better than I was expecting."
"Pours jet black, with a dark tan head. In the aroma, roasty malt, oaky, and a small coffee presence. In the taste, big roasty malt, coffee, and a whiskey note. A smooth, big body mouthfeel, and a semi dry roasty malt aftertaste. A very smooth and big beer, and a nice coffee presence. Very nice."
"D: A good after-dinner drink, but not something I'd want most times of day. Just a bit to sweet and heavy to drink other parts of the day. However, it's a nice example of oaked IS."
"Overall a great beer, drinkable especially w/ desert. Recommended!"
"Overall: Somewhat weak nose, but the palate is good. Not exceptional by any stretch, but enjoyable."
"Amazing mouthfeel. This beer is smooth and easy to drink. A perfect balance of flavor and carbonation. I could drink this forever and the the only thing stopping me from giving it perfect scores is the moderate hop profile. I think it could use a little more bite from some hops. A dazzling beverage and a must try."
"D - Quite drinkable for a large beer. Avoids being too heavy despite the mouthfeel. Flavours are good, but no super strong."
"Drinks great for the style & delivers a boatload of flavor for the ABV! Another winner from Weyerbacher!"
"Pretty good for an oak-aged stout. Much better than the non-oaked version."
"Black in color with a creamy brown head. Aroma consists of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt and there's also some vinous notes to it. Full-bodied mouthfeel. Roasted malt and chocolate upfront. Vanilla oakiness follows with hints of creamed coffee toward the back. This is very smooth for an Imperial stout."
"Tastes richly mocha-chocolatey, made creamy by nice fine carbonation, bittered a bit with burnt coffee and a pleasantly acrid note of dry wood. There's a fruity flavor that refuses to identify itself to me, but whatever it is, it's something tropical and spicy... with maybe cola nuts? Good-good. Drippy caramels laden with savory alcohol soften and enrich a prickly, peppery, instant-coffee-powdery, cocoa-dry finish. Nice drinkability in this medium-full bodied treat."
"D - Very drinkable for an RIS, partially accentuated by the lighter mouthfeel. I don't think I'll have a problem getting through all 750ml this evening."
"I bought this bottle at the Whole Foods near Fair Lakes, VA."
"pours jet-black w/ a creamy brown head that takes a moment to subside leaving a decent lacing in my snifter ; a strong, sour, woody aroma backed by a burnt toast, dark fruits, and brandy, maybe even a touch of smoke ; a slightly tart and sweet vinous woody flavor, not as bitter or dry as other RIS's which i think is a downfall, some roasted malt and hints of choc. and raison present as well, an overall flavor that seems a bit light, except for the almost overwhelming oak making it a bit out of balance ; a rich, full body and good carbonation on this one ; a very good and drinkable brew, though the wood can be a bit much..."
"Pours a solid black with a tanish head. Aroma is roasted barley, a bit of dried fruit, a bit vinous. Taste is vinous, has some roasted malts mixed with some vanilla, and oak. Mouthfeel is thick and a bit creamy. light carbonation. Leaves a bitter oak/roast aftertaste. Nice Impy Stout, definitely a sipper, well I wanted it to be a sipper...."
"Received a black-cola body w/ a huge head that was faintly tan colored. Roasted malt first hit my nostril, along w/ other malts and a dark fruit smell. Extremely creamy and thick with a somewhat sharp backbite. Still retains some sweetness and flavor in the body while having that dry stout finish. The ABV is hidden well, but so is the unique flavor. A good stout nonetheless."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable for the style, although it surprises me that this much alcohol creates so much warming."
"D- Easy to drink. The Beam smell is a slight put off, mostly due to my own personal experiences with it."
"An all around good beer."
"Despite my questionable state of soberness I can tell you that this was a delicious beer. I'll definitely have another. Once again, thanks to my good friend and loyal drinkin' buddy Hyland24"
"I found this beer so delicious I had 11 in a row at a party and had no trouble either which is amazing since I am only 150 pounds. It was a testament to the rich complex flavors!"
"D: I was really impressed with his beer and would rate it as one of the more drinkable RIS's I've had. Complex, rich and creamy with a hint of the wood barrels make this a must-try."
"This beauty poured black with the consistency of a thin pancake syrup. Formed a brown 1 inch bubbly head with a nice sheet of sticky lacing. Smelled like charred wood, smokey coffee and chocolate. Hints of alcohol with a strong malt presence. Taste was rich with bitter coffee, smoke and toffee finishing with light alcohol taste and cocoa. Nice thick mouth coat that left behind a sticky glaze. Delicious beer that was not overpowering for an imperial. Definitely a must try."
"Doesn't quite bowl me over but is definitely flavorful enough. Unlike a lot of notes I may have reviewed this one a little TOO warm. Solid beverage nonetheless."
"Overall: Pretty good brew, with huge barrel aged character. It would have got higher marks with a bit more carbonation and malt flavor. That being said if you want tons of bourbon in your stout this one fits the bill."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams Boston Lager BL glass, the beer pours pitch black with a 2 inch frothy brown head. Head retention is good, lacing is OK. Aroma is roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and a little bit of bourbon and oak (but not as much bourbon/oak as I expected). The aroma isn't strong at first, but does get more powerful as the beer sits around a little while. I can taste bourbon, coffee, oak, roasted/burnt malt and some vanilla. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick but not as rich as I thought it would be. Carbonation is average. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and isn't hard to drink at all. Alcohol isn't very noticable. Overall I think this is a good, but not great RIS. I'd buy it again."
"This stout is a great showcasing of what oak can bring to a beer. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: Not the most powerful or the best oak aged Imperial Stout out on the market, but it's still worth a shot if you can get your hands on any."
"This poured pitch black with tan head. It smelled like milk chocolate, bourbon, and burnt coffee. It tasted like creamy chocolate milk and coffee, with delicate bourbon flavors and a slight alcohol taste. It was super thick with no carbonation and a very mild and sweet chocolate aftertaste. Overall this was a very creamy and sweet stout, with a complex but very easy to enjoy flavor that made the beer great to sip or gulp."
"This beer mellows perfectly with the oak aging. Very well done, weyerbacher has come a long way in the last decade. Well done guys!"
"T/M: Espresso and dark chocolate with some vanilla notes, fading to bourbon bite and alcohol on finish. Hops just make an appearance at the end."
"D: I suppose the added complexity would be a good thing for some, but why fix what isn't broken? When in Weyerbacher country, it's back to Old Heathen for me."
"The bomber will suffice for this barrel aged stout. Very tasty and a pleasure to relax and sip, definitely one I will revisit, but nothing I could drink many of in one sitting."
"[I later went back and looked at other reviews...is this just a flawed batch? Everybody's saying how the mouthfeel is thick, and rich, and creamy...argh...]"
"Taste is mostly roasted malt with a slight bourbon edge, but the bourbon aspect is downplayed quite a bit, the 8% is not evident as there is very little burn to this RIS, makes this very easy to drink for the style. Finishes with a slight coffee bitterness, decent creaminess the entire way through, good carbonation level."
"Overall, I grew a little tired of the big bourbon taste, but I would say this is the best ""bourbon-aged"" beer that I've tasted."
"Very good, not great - Perhaps would be better suited with some food rather than as a nightcap."
"d: Super drinkable for the style. Goes down much smoother than you would think. The barrel aging really did this beer wonders."
"D: Pretty alcoholic - so much so that I can't help but cringe a little after swallowing. It reminds me of shooting vodka, but it's still pretty drinkable for the style. Like any Imperial Stout, it's so rich and thick that it's hard to drink too much, but it's good enough for me."
"D- Definitely a sipper, and for the ABV I expected this to be a little more drinkable. Not for favorite for the style, but definitely worth a shot."
"A 22oz bottle served in a tulip glass. Nice looking beer: black, thick mocha head, impressive lacing all the way down. It had a predominately coffee aroma, as well as some sweet fruit and vanilla. Coffee and milk chocolate taste. I thought it was a tad too sweet, which cut down the drinkability a bit."
"Tastes of roasted malts, coffee, fruits, very warming whisky like alcohol and some bitterness. Not the most drinkable beer but a great one none the less."
"22oz. bomber from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours completely opaque black body with well over an inch of light brown head that slowly dissipates leaving much lacing. Wood and vanilla dominate the aroma, with hints of coffee and caramel in the background. Dark pleasant roasty coffee-dark chocolate, maltiness, and woody vanilla play equal roles in the flavor initially, but wood definitely dominates the finish and aftertaste. Rich full mouth-feel, though not viscous or sticky like some, with a fair bit of carbonation, more than is often seen in the style, but by no means does it hurt the beer. The carbonation along with the pleasing near-flawless flavor make this an extremely beer considering the full mouthfeel and abv. My only complaint for this beer is that the wood flavor could be a bit more subdued. Having said that, this beer is dangerously drinkable and is a new favorite for the style."
"D: Very easy to drink, great rich coffee finish makes this a joy to drink to the bitter end."
"A bit lighter in the feel than I expected, with some slick alcohol lasting more in the aftertaste than the flavors. It is a slow sipper as it packs a punch."
"A huge foamy three finger chocolate brown head quickly forms with a strong pour. body is black as ink letting no light escape. Nose hints of nicely robust malt, smokey meaty notes, coffee and hidden alchol. first sip is only slightly thinner than expected with hints of coco, toffee, anise and burnt malt. A short sour feel bites the back of the tongue as the beer passes by. As you continue to let it develop you also get alchol soaked sour cherries and even phenol like notes including vanilla and banana. Mouthfeel is as thick as you would expect from this style but well received. A extremely enjoyable sipper. Dry bitter bite to the tongue is also there as you continue to drink through the night. Very good underated stout."
"Split a bottle of this with a friend. Crazy cheap for a RIS ($4.99 for a bomber). Poured a pitch black color, no highlights to speak of, with an off-white head that dissovles quickly and leaves very little lacing. Nose is roasted malt and almost winey-grapes and other dried fruit. Some oakiness in there too. A touch of alcohol. Very strange, but not bad. Flavor is likewise. Smooth, and highly fruity, with some chocolate, tons of roasted malt and cookies. That wine sits there in the oak barrels as well. Body is a little thin for a RIS, but the carbonation is mellow and appropriate to the style. Overall, this one is quite a tasty unique RIS, although maybe not one of the best. Worth a shot."
"What an enjoyable beer. The malts are bitter, yet smooth. There are no overzealous hops to mask the complexity that the malts carry on their own. The %ABV is about 8%, which increases the drinkability. Highly recommended."
"Overall, an excellent stout choice."
"D = Good drinkability, too bad the ABV is as high as it is, because this would be an excellent beer to have a few of if you were going by taste alone. An excellent dessert beer."
"Pours a dark opaque black with a decent tan head that slowly diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is a wonderful blend of oak, roasted barley, coffee, and brown malts. Taste is a smooth blend of oak and roasted barley. The beer is very smooth and enjoyably dry, the alcohol is very well hidden. While still not all that high on the list when it comes to the style, this is still very enjoyable."
"22 oz bottle. Pours nearly pitch black with a tall tan head that is mostly lasting. Aroma of bitter chocolate and coffee. Initial taste of malts, dark fruits, and a hint of smoke. Flavor ends kind of dry, fruity, and bitter with a hint of alcohol. Limited lacing, light carbonation, medium to heavy body, some alcohol noted. Drinkable, but other options out there."
"D- Awesome RIS. I would love to pair this with a chocolate cake for an after dinner treat."
"Oak aged Imperial Stouts are instant favorites for most, but this one really pushes it's way to the front. When poured into a wide mouth chalice and tipped to see the color, well...there is none. It's a black hole that invites you to dive in with an alluring vanilla/coffee scent. So smooth. Sweet and bitter flavors, extremely drinkable but you'll want to savor this one at 8.2% abv. A must try."
"From what I understand, this particular brew was created by Weyerbacher aging their outstanding Old Heathen in oak-barrels... the result is a superb step-up from an already fantastic brew... Old Heathen tinged with vanilla, bourbon, and whiskey notes that is extremely complex, rich, and flavorful, and a level up from a typical RIS... Pours a deep, dark, jet-black, ebony hue with a reddish, modest tan head that soon dissipated... smell is absolutely wonderful, with rich, dark, burnt-chocolate, espresso, and cocoa... taste couldn't more strongly complement the aroma, with rich latte-like, bourbon, whiskey, vanilla, chocolate, and strong cocoa and espresso notes... just about the perfect rendition of the style... can't get much more thick, rich, or complex than this one... one of my favorite beers from Weyerbacher... this one is a real winner with myriad flavors that tingle the tongue and delight the pallate... certainly a winner where aroma and flavor are concerned... this one hits home... one of the better depictions of the style... a top American brew... Definitely recommended..."
"D: I like this. Quite drinkable for an imperial stout."
"Steve"
"Served in my DFH snifter. Poured the color of tar with absolutely no light penetration. Luscious, dense mocha-colored head with consistent lacing throughout the tasting. Strong scent of oak, coffee and molasses. Taste similar to nose with the addition of chocolate; heavy presence of alcohol and oak at the finish. Full-bodied mouthfeel. Very smooth, but not quite silky as there is a bit of carbonation detectable on the tongue and a little too oaky for my taste (strong bourbon undertones). This is a definitely a complex brew that should be savored slowly. Would have been better bottled as a 12oz. because 22 is just too much oak for a sitting."
"D - smooth with a meal or as an after dinner sipper."
"Pours a pitch black with a higher rising tan head that falls fairly quickly. Nose is thick molasses malts with mild coffee on there. The malts are the thickest character here though. Flavor is malty and thick. I get a touch of alcohol as well. Feel is about standard for the liquid, though it seems to fall off on the end to a more watery and thin feel. Carbonation is typical. Overall this is a good brew in the essence that it is even and smooth. There isn't anything overly interesting going on here. Just an even keeled experience."
"Pours black, completely opaque, with a toffee-colored head, about 1/2", that hangs. Smell is espresso, rich dark chocolate, and soft caramel malt. Taste is fantastically rich, smoother than many RIS, with heavy notes of espresso, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, cola, and a hint of figs. Lacing is fairly heavy and mouthfeel is wonderfully rich and thick. Not as powerfully bitter as Bell's Expedition, which works to its advantage. A dessert by itself."
"D: This goes down very easy for its ABV and is well balanced between bitter chocolate, sweet malts, and smokiness."
"D: Thank God for evolving tastebuds. While I once found this to be offensive, I have come around. The flavors blend nicely, a signature of Weyerbacher's barrel-aged line. This is a quality stout."
"Pours black with a thin tan head. Decent retention,and nice lacing. Smell is of smokey,roasted malts,and maybe some coffee. Medium bodied,with a bit of carbonation. Taste is roasted,and chocolately, with a bit of a dark fruit edge. Lighter than I expected. Very nice."
"D: A very interesting beer, but I think I enjoyed this more the first time around when it was fresh, or maybe I had just built up my expectations for this too much from last year."
"pours pitch black with a toffee colored head. The lacing is their, but not as present as with other of the style. The oak aging sticks out in the nose with a big wiff of vanilla and bourbon. The flavor is also strong with the oak aging, with some roasted malts and chocolates coming through. The alcohol can be detected, but is well complimented. The mouthfeel is light for an IS, and this beer is not incredibly drinkable. Overall worth a try, not the best IS but by no means bad."
"Notes: This one's been in my cellar for a pretty long time. Not sure how long, and with no dates on the bottle, I have no way of guessing just how old this one was. . . . Think Jack Daniels and Vanilla Coke -- flat Vanilla Coke -- and you have the idea. Not recommended, especially not in large quantities. Maybe this would be interesting in a 5-6 oz-sized serving in a snifter -- i.e., split the bomber 4 ways -- but trying to drink a bomber of this was a chore. I couldn't do it."
"D- Decent but somewhat uninspiring IRS, lacks boldness and complexities found is many of the bigger offerings in this genre"
"Poured into a brandy snifter. Dark black with a large beige head. Coffee aroma with some chocolate Not bitter at all. Rich and creamy, the beer goes down smoothly. Very nice beer for a cool Fall evening by the fire. This is one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts I've tried, and it's easy to find a well."
"22 oz bomber into tulip glass. A: Black oil, tan head that goes down pretty quickly. Not much lacing. S: Bitter chocolate, dark fruit, some earthy hops in there. Very enticing. T: Moderately sweet, chocolate, bourbon, oak, really nice layer of earthy/mild citrus hops on the wonderfully long finish. Beautifully balanced. M: Smooth, chewy, delicious. D: I am not by any means an expert on RIS, but I think this has to be one of my favorites out of the ones I've had. Really brilliant, complex flavors, none of them too intense as to detract from each other. I picked this one up knowing nothing about it, I think I'll definitely pick it up again."
"Decided while prepping the turkey for brining...decided a keep it for a special occasion beer was in order. The occasion, the lady making pumpkin Crème brûlée... and all I have to do is donate my brewing pot to an overnight turkey home. Black brew, good fluidity in pour. Sweet and sour beer. Quite a fantastic combination. Something I dont think I would have liked in the beginning of my beer education, ore even membership of with BA, or possibly when I received this in a trade over a year ago, but now, quite nice. I dont know how this aged bottle compares to the fresh ones, but if this is any indication, age on people, age on. Really smooth, Im glad I had the hold onto mentality with this one. Very slight alcohol taste right at the end is the only heat this one brings at its age."
"Overall, This is quite boozy tasting for 8%! Pour JD into a pint of stout, that's what this is."
"1027"
"I haven't really had a bourbon barrel-aged beer before, and I guess the bourbon flavor was a bit more than I was expecting. It seemed to overshadow the actual ""beer"" aspect rather than complement it. It was still quite enjoyable, but this ""flaw"" keeps it from competing with the upper echelon of the style. Recommended, especially for fans of bourbon barrel-aged beers."
"I will be searching this beer out again."
"Served in a snifter glass. Poured nicely with a thick brownish head almost resembling the crema of an expresso. Nice aromas, coffee,dark berries. Extremely smooth , you can definelty pick up on the oak, it smooths out the flavor. Left a bit of a tart taste on the pallet perhaps from the oak. Over all good brew would drink again."
"The flavor has a much more subtle wood flavor than many of the other wood aged beers I've tried, which I like very much. It is not over-stated at all. Bakers chocolate, alcohol is slightly noticeable, freshly cut wood."
"M/D: Robust full body with a good amount of carbonation. A little sticky. Although alcohol is concealed fairly well, this is still a sipper. Not quite smooth enough for higher drinkability. 8% is definately felt if not tasted. Something that is best enjoyed on a cold night."
"Weyerbacher never disappoints. Cheers!"
"Vanilla and chocolate flavors. Bourbon soaked oak barrels really impart a nice flavor to this beer--they actually take over most of the subtle flavors that could potentially come out. Slight dark fruit notes with a touch of licorice round out the flavors. A bit thin on the palate with most of the flavors dropping off quickly leaving only the bourbon and fading vanilla notes legging it out to the finish. Quite smooth, however, with a soft and pleasing finish. I was looking for a bigger beer with a full bodied mouthfeel. RIS at 8%? That's the first interesting thing. Unfortunately this barely touches a medium body and is actually a tad watery in my opinion. Nice try by Weyerbacher, but I was expecting more for the price tag and the style."
"Impressed by my first Weyerbacher brew."
"Let's see how its sister bottle turned out. The wine character has greatly diminished, now replaced with a vinous plum/prune combination. The oakiness has also declined, currently at a very nice level. There're malty tastes of roast and bittersweet chocolate, but they're not particularly strong and there's only a very, very minute amount of sweetness remaining. While it hasn't seen a betterment from a few years of quiet aging, it did hold up. But that's cellaring for you, it's a crapshoot."
"Overall, a disappointment. Very sweet and plain, the only high point is the oak. And, if it's oak you're looking for, go for an oak-aged Yeti."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, a little filling, excellent representation of style, despite you being able to detect the alcohol a little bit more than you usually can in a beer for this style, the kick is decent but not as hard as some RIS’s can have. However, I would definitely consider this one a sipper rather than a pounder and a very good one at that. I enjoyed Old Heathen some time ago, but enjoyed this one more, a testament oak barrel aging at the brewery."
"D- It is pretty good. I was hoping for a bit stronger beer in general (especially since it's barrel aged). Still a decent beer but wouldn't go crazy over it and I doubt it will stand out in the crowd a month down the road."
"Recieved this 22oz bottle as part of the Summer Sipper 2007 BIF. Pours a pitch black color, thick brown head that settles fairly quickly. Has somewhat of a grape aroma when poured cold, but as it warms to the proper temp, taste and aroma of coffee, baker's chocolate, possibly even tobacco become apparent, was expecting more oak-aged taste, but it is hidden somewhat behing the other flavors. Mouthfeel is just south of full bodied, nice and silky smooth. Drinkability is incredibly good. I don't recall having a ""russian imperial stout before", I expected it to be alot harsher. I love being pleasantly surprised by a beer. Very good indeed."
"A good but not great beer. I'm really on the fence about whether this will be a repeat buy or not. I suppose if I see an inexpensive one, again, I won't be able to resist an oak-aged Russian Imperial Stout."
"D: 3.5"
"Pours a nice clean black color, nice carbonation, small creamy tannish head, no sticky lacing at all though. The nose is malty, roasted, vanilla, oaky, toffee, and caramel. The taste is very nice consisting of roasted malts, some vanilla, nice oaky flavor, toffee/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a outstanding RIS, highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel has a nice medium/full body. A little more on the thick side, which is something I like in an RIS. I really enjoyed this beer, another good one from Weyerbacher"
"This is a good beer. Are there better out there? Sure, but this one is worth your time and your dollar."
"One of the best beers I have come across in the last years!"
"Thanks for sending this mikesgroove!"
"Overall: These bottles were purchased 2 years ago. They have since mellowed a bit (I would have rated it a bit lower then) and are a bit more harmonious on the palate. Let's let another bottle rest for another year...A complex and interesting RIS."
"The oak really showed up on the taste, giving the stout some beefy, merlot-style notes. The acidity and sugar were a bit on the heavy side, but its chocolate and coffee notes supplied a tasty balance to the flavor. Reminded me of a dessert-style port wine without the high alcohol and sweentess. Mouthfeel was thin and juicy, not what I was expecting from a RIS, but still good. All in all, a tasty, intriguing beer from the Easton, PA crew. Give it a shot."
"Pours an impressive dark color, with decent foam retention and fairly good lacing. On the nose I get a lot of coffee and chocalate, with a touch of sweet vanilla. On the palate this is a very nice beer indeed. It is not particularly heavy or intense, but with nice soft, smooth, sweet chocolate/coffee flavors. Although sweet, there is just a hint of dryness on the mid palate, which makes this beer all the more drinkable. On the impressive finish, I even pick up a trace of cherry along with the chocolate and coffee. The beer is surprisingly drinkable, and I have to say I appreciate the fact the abv. is ""only"" 8%. With an abv. like that, I might even be able to have a second glass. A winner from Weyerbacher."
"Heresy is medium bodied, thick and creamy in the mouth, surprisingly easy going down. A nice sipper on a cool night."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. But, due to the abv and the noticeable alcohol taste, I think drinkability is limited. One bomber is enough for me in one sitting. Overall, it's okay. Worth a try. But, there are much better imperial stouts on the market."
"I can't really say anything too bad about this beer, in fact it's not unpleasant. But it tends in taste and mouth feel to remind me more of a strong double IPA, than an IRS. You get the drift. It lacks that big beer ballsiness that sings siren songs to the IRS lover. It has lighter hopiness, not very bitter, what happened to the coffee, where is the chocolate, mouth feel not chewy. Let me reiterate: it is not a bad beer, just a weak IRS ..."
"Mouthfeel is appropriate for an 8% stout. It doesn't match the motor oil appearance, but is light enough to remain drinkable without being filling. Would pair well with food. Nice carbonation and milky cream body. The oak smoothed this one out. Not a bad buy."
"Drinkability: This was the third bourbon barrel aged beer that I have tasted (previously tasted Winter's Bourbon Cask Ale, which was so-so, and Allagash Curieux, which was very nice and unique) and in my opinion of the three, the stout balanced best with the bourbon barrel aging flavors. I really loved it (its Old Heathen kicked up a notch) and will buy this again."
"Pours black with a thick brown head. Aroma is whiskey, vanilla, oak, which gives this beer an aroma reminiscent of Baileys Irish Cream (yeah, it surprised me too). This brew is definitely different. If you like whiskey, youre likely to like this. It has a nice sour tang as well, which serves, oddly enough, to mellow and blend the finish. Not as hoppy or heavily bodied as most Imperial Stouts, but a very good and unique brew nonetheless. Nice!"
"Drinkability: Too complex to go down fast. But good for a RIS."
"Period."
"This beer is really interesting and great for someone who wants to see how much a burbon barrel can transform a beer. It has a great vanilla, nut-oak aroma. Pours thick and screams complexity. I chilled it a bit to much but let it warm up in my brandy glass a little longer after my first sip. The body is great and mouthfeel was perfect for a beer of this magnitude. I could drink about tow per session, but after that the ABV gets in the way not the taste. Try one is you have a chance and like big beers."
"I love big malty beers, especially RISes and this was no exception."
"D - This beer would be fabulous with better carbonation. Bourbon lovers dream though with very complex bourbon notes mixed in. I enjoyed it."
"D- A whole bottle would be easy to drink. This is probably the only imperial stout I could drink a lot of... but it's not thin. Just really good."
"Pours jet black with a dark tan head that stays for a bit. The smell is very sweet with a strong dose of hard liquor. The taste is very similar, sweet up front, alcohol going down that over powers the beer. This one isn't very high in ABV (for an Imperial), yet the flavor reveals so much in the taste, probably because they are aged in bourbon barrels. The mouthfeel is ok, it was hard to get past the flavor. I don't like that I bought this in a growler, the description was deceiving, I can't see having more than one of these. Check it out if you really like the Imperials."
"Drinkability - A nice solid Russian Imperial."
"Thick,syrupy, mouthfeel with a grainy, rough on the palate feel seems to be from the alcohol.Not much drinkability the very sweet booziness was too much for me to want more than one bottle."
"Pretty good stuff."
"DA: The oak aging seems to mellow out the malt flavors a bit, becoming less sweet and caramalized than some, but certainly adds a more roasty and wood-like flavor. The hop is very zesty and adds some interest to this one. This is a brew you want to enjoy slowly."
"On tap at Which Brew in Easton. Appears a very deep brown with a finger of dark tan head. Smells of chocolate, woody oak, alcohol, and roasted malts. Tastes of boozy, whiskey spiked coffee with a dose of cocoa and vanilla. The dark chocolate notes become more dominant and the alcohol burn fades as the beer warms up. A little thin in both mouthfeel and carbonation. A nice dessert sipper."
" This is a medium bodied brew and is on the dry side. I am not the biggest fan of stouts and would not be able to drink this all night but I could deffinately see myself enjoying this brew with a meal such as steak and potatos."
"Very and tasty RIS. Though its only downside is lack of hop bite."
"Overall, I found this brew to be just OK. Love the extreme dark pour but did not find it to be as bold and intense as other RIS. The oak never shined on my palate as well as the alcohol that is so noticable in other RIS."
"Served at cellar temperature in a snifter. Poured a deep jet black, with about two fingers of thick , bubbly, coffee brown head. Head dissipated quickly into a thick ring in the glass. Smell was of oak, strong vanilla, roasted malt and rich roasted coffee beans. Not too shabby. Taste was rich with vanilla, bourbon ,oak, and dark chocolates , with a smooth warming alcohol finish. Little carbonation. Seems to be a pretty solid brew. Mouthfeel was thick and full with a creaminess to it. Drinkability was great. Smooth and complex. Good beer i will be getting again."
"Tonight, timtheenchanta and I brought our Weyerbacher Old Heathen and Weyerbacher Heresey (oak aged Old Heathen) together for a little side by side comparison. The Heresey pours into the snifter black as night with a full creamy head that holds nicely leaving lace down the glass. The head certainly holds better than the old heathen, and that had a much harder pour. The aroma is dominated by the oak, which gives it a woody and vanilla like smell. Buried in there though, is the faint smell of roasted chocolate malt. In comparison, the Old Heathen, has the aroma of very sweet chocolate. Once the beer hits the mouth, the woody oak hits once again followed by a nice balance of vanilla and roasted chocolate. The woodiness also balances out the sweetness of the Old Heathen. There is a full thick mouthfeel with this one; a bit thicker than the Old Heathen. Overall, very drinkable. A great Imperial stout that uses the oak in moderation. The oak shines through without letting the beer become undrinkable."
"Moderately chalky, however the carbonation feels so relaxing in my mouth. When I'm done, I'm left with vanilla on my mind. This feels like a really bad review, but it's a really drinkable beverage. On second thought, maybe I shouldn't feel like I can throw back a bunch of RISs in one night. It just lacks the body this style should offer."
"This is one of the most interesting beers I have had, incredibly complex and it changes as you drink probably more than any beer I have had. The appearance remains jet-black throughout its enjoyment, but the head goes from massive to thin, from no lacing to decent retention. The smell is of dark plums, light chocolate, and light coffee. The taste is thick and dark with a very strong bourbon presence. The bourbon presence subsides as you drink it, but begins as very strong and mellows with each sip. Again changing, the mouthfeel goes from thick and creamy to thin and watery, very interesting. This is not the best beer I have ever had but definitely worth revisiting for its superior complexity. Not the greatest in any rating category but you will notice something different and it will hold your interest with each sip. Not for everyone, but a highly recommended beer to mix things up a bit."
"I loved this beer -- the best of any of the oak-aged Weyerbachers that I've tried."
"Drinkability: I find the old heathen to be a better more drinkable beer. But I am not a huge bourbon fan. but all in all a nice change up and great flavors...I just need to get my palate to appreciate bourbon!"
"D - A nice sipper for a cool evening. Easy to drink since the taste is so pleasing. Not too heavy on the alcohol, and an all-around enjoyable brew."
"A nice big stout. Beer with balls!"
"Man, such a promising beer through the appearance and smell but totally falls off in the taste. Thin, unbalanced and lacking any complexity. Roasty yet enamling malt, with burnt unappetizing dark chocolate flavors. An offending mouthfeel really sets it off. Hard to even place what the main proponent of dissapointment is. But I'm very saddened by the outcome of this BA stout."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable; the 8% ABV is well hidden. An enjoyable brew."
"Poured oil slick opaque black with a creamy 1 inch head that setlled down to a 1/2 layed. Depp lace and thick look overall, very nice. Smell was coffee and caramel. Maybe some toffee mixed in, earthy hints at the back but slight with a spice that tingled the nose. The taste was coffee and oak, with oak being a big played. Slight alcohol warming as well. Very unique taste, somewhat bitter as well, may do some good to lay down for a bit. Thick tasting, but not too much. This was a good RIS, and I think the oak age benefited it, will be cellaring a couple to see how they go down the road."
"Notes - A good brew, but not great. Seems to lack a distinguishing taste and depth as nothing seems to jump out at me. I might buy it again sometime, but not anytime soon."
"Pretty complex stout here, but the oak-aged...iness overwhelms the malt profile at times making it a little too sweet and woody to have more than one."
"D- This beer is big and oaky but there are no malt flavors to balance the wood. The oak flavors are balanced by a sourness and a bitterness in the finish. No real depth or complexity in this beer."
"D - Good. I prefer it to Old Heathen. Keep oak aging, Weyerbacher, and I'll keep drinking."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer very much. I'd definitely include it in a RIS sampling."
"Pours almost totally black with a little ring of tan colored head. Odor is dank like an old cellar and heavy with coffee grounds. Taste is a soft coffee with oak, vanilla, alcohol. Very mellow and soft and not overly complex. Almost, i'd say, a delicate beer. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery for the stlye, IMO. Easy to drink overall despite its ABV. Sort of a whispery version of an impy with the oak barrel aging being almost a more prominent feature than the beer itself."
"Pours with plenty of big, chocolat milk coloured head. A dark black body and would leave a lightning storm of lacing. Aroma filled with oak - a earthy, dirty aged wood. Strong bourbony notes and maybe a little alcohol creeps in. Flavours a little off centered. I get mild hop residue, a strong absence of malts (except a light biscuity malt) and a roast character of charred wood. Very flat for a RIS. The oak aging didn't seem to adopt any dimension - lack of vanilla, etc that you often find resulting from. Flavours are just too soft and the oak didn't seem to compliment anything. Disappointed."
"drinkability is good. fairly balanced and enjoyable. the aging has done this one some good, and i'd be curious to try a sample with even a little more time. i had a fresh bottle almost two years ago and the oak and whiskey were overpowering. i remember thinking 'hey, did someone pour some stout in my whiskey'. the alcohol was much more prominent then too. now i think it has mellowed alot into a nicer (but still strongly oaked) stout. definitely worth a try, especially if you can lay one down for a year."
"meh...same for flavor (and boy, this is the driest RIS i've ever tasted), though i can't taste the booze as much as i can feel it. like its unadulterated cousin this beer isn't very complex, which isn't the end of the world, but something i expect from an imperial stout. it does not taste bad...just uninspiring. the finish is anticlimactic, as well"
" *This bottle was probobly 1 +/- years old, and stored @ +/- 60 deg. F, and I'm remebering this beer was better when I had it fresh a year ago. I'll try my other bottle in another year and see if it comes full circle."
"A great beer by Weyerbacher that I would love to try again."
"This is a great RIS that may not be quite as huge and intense as some (Dark Lord), but is really nicely rounded-out and full of tasty, complex flavors."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Flat and boring... it doesn't stay together for even three seconds. I love most everything from Weyerbacher, especially their latest efforts... but this bottle of Heresy is terrible."
"Overall not very drinkable. I liked certain nuances here, but way out of balance. My least favorite of the usually wonderful Weyerbachers."
"D: An excellent RIS...terrific flavors and great balance. I'm glad I got to try this one, I'd gladly have more of these! Thanks Hart!"
"Taste is extraordinary. A complete liquid symphony harmoniously in duet with oak & balanced stout, to crescendo into a gloriously made drink that I wish would never end. Seriously, Weyerbacher has made it's way onto my radar. Bless the creators of such a fine drink."
"One of the best Ive had from Weyerbacher. Pours a deep, dark chocolate black with about two inches of rust colored foam. Settles to a thin ring quickly, with light lacing. Smells like licorice and dark fruit. Taste is very similar, raisins and hints of rich chocolate in the start. Finishes with a potent, layered oaky flavor  grimy and burnt, then smooth. Mouthfeel is full bodied, yet silky smooth. Highly drinkable. Lots of alcohol, but enticingly delicious and complex. Im completely satisfied with it as is, but I think I may add a bit of Jim Beam to see how it changes. Good stuff."
"I had a sip of this at Monster Bridge the other day and it was much more balanced and complex. Would of gotten quite a good rating that night. But this one is just too much bourbon. I will leave this review now, but I reserve the right to adjust it at a future tasting."
"Super freaking drinkable, I could sip this all night but I am running out; pity that. A REALLY great RIS that I wholeheartedly recommend."
"Drinkability: I did have this during lunch to celebrate my recent promotion, so I could feel it a bit. However, I would have had a few if I didn't need to go back to the office."
"This beer pours a deliciously dark brown color, thats hardly transparent except when heald up to light. The smell is really big, like coffee beans and dark malts. The taste is similar, with a syrupy consistancy that is pleasant all the way down. I must say the best part about this beer is that it is not huge, but a great size for a wonderful tasting big beer without the cringing. There is a sweet vanilla taste toward the end of it that washes it down very nicely. A great beer."
"This beer pours a jet black oil with a large frothy chocolate milk type of head. This is what I like about Imperial Stouts, they look beautiful. The smell is a potent mix of dark fruit, wine, chocolate, and a bourban oak aroma. Very nice. The taste is a milky creamy chocolate. cherry, dark fruit, with a mix of bourban. The m/f is medium and a little thin,my only complaint with this. A damn good beer from a brewery that I discovered only recently and has become one of my favorites."
"Another winner from Weyerbacher, who rarely dissapoints. I think this could use a little more time in the cellar, and a little less time in the oak barrels. That being said, this is still a very enjoyable stout."
"Heresy is a good imperial stout that had just a little heat. There is a lot to like about Heresy, but it isn't a top 10 impy in my book."
"M&D - the alcohol presence is a bit too high, needs a bit more balance, but otherwise is very very good, a high quality RIS, expected no less from Weyerbacher"
"The smell is deep and full of good flavors. Roasted malts dominate with a hint of oak. Oak comes though stronger in the taste, alongside more roasted malts and just a hint of chocolate. Vanilla is stronger than any other stout I've had. The mouthfeel is fairly light but brings a nice alcoholic burn. Drinkability is good."
"Thanks Muenchenerkindl! This is awesome!"
"Im glad I popped it tonight  thanks to BeerBeing for the treat. Even in the 90 degreee heat, a real fine sipper  this would make for a GREAT fall classic while watching football."
"I have had hit or miss experiences with Weyerbacher this I would say is a hit,poured a ink black with a dark mocha colored 1/2 finger creamy head.The oak its aged in shows thru in the nose with a vanilla-like tone along with some molasses and iron,a real nice mellow mouthfeel for a bigger brew really slides down easy.Not huge in my mind for the style but very good flavors vanilla tinged with molasses and rum soaked raisins finishing somewhat woody and cola-like.A nice impy stout not overly big to me,its approachable with out any flavor loss or character."
"Poured black as ink with a sand coloured head that dissolved quickly. Laced the edges of the glass wonderfully. Smell is very sweet. Almost lactic. This is the least hoppy RIS I have had in a long time. Smells delicious with lots of chocolate and coffee beans. Plenty of dark roasted malts, as well. The taste is more of the same. Almost no hops at all, with dark malts and bitter chocolate dominating. Mouthfeel is very smooth, even though it's quite heavy and thick. I'm a little surprised, quite honestly, as I was sure this would be like Old Rasputin, or Yeti, or something. No hops (citrus-pine resin like ones) here, however. Very tasty indeed. Thanks to BeerBeing for this on a trade."
"Poured a viscous, completely opaque black color with a frothy, mocha colored head. Rings of lacing were left behind in my goblet. A 1 cm head remained throughout the session. Aromas of cream, figs, dates, dark chocolate, wood, and sugar-covered candy. Sweet flavors dominate. Initial flavors rise to sweet, smoked malt flavors with a hint of smoke and dark chocolate. Cream-coffee finish with subtle hops. Smooth, sweet, and slightly fruity. A completely enjoyable beer with great flavors and depth."
"Prosit, Prosit und Dobbel Zum Wohl! MK"
"D: Way more drinkable that I had anticipated. I put this bottle down myslef. I will certainly be drinking more of these in the near future."
"Cheers!"
"I'd probably pass on this beer again unless I got it for free. Not a terrible beer by any means, but I don't think it was as good as it's non oak-aged counterpart, Old Heathen."
"Pours a deep black with a thick brown head. Aroma has coffee, chocolate, and a little bit of oak. First in the taste is a smooth chocolate flavor, but a nice oak whisky-like flavor follows in the aftertaste. The oak really balances the sweetness from the malt and chocolate flavors. Also noticing some nice vanilla notes. Really smooth and well balanced, the alcohol is just making itself slightly noticable. Lightly carbonated with a medium mouthfeel. This is a pretty enjoyable and drinkable beer!"
"After one of these, I'm quite ready to move onto either Stone IRS or Siberian Night."
"Pours black and tan -- black body, relatively dark tan head. The head sticks around forever and leaves lots of lacing. A very attractive beer. Zesty chocolates, slight berries, and the spices on top of the espresso foam in the nose. On the palate, present alcohol and sweet espresso cream mingle at first. The beer dries out in the mid-palate through the finish, with some coffee dryness taking over. Mouthfeel is thin for an oak-aged imperial stout, but maintains its smoothness throughout. The overall effect is good, pretty well integrated, but not revelatory. The tastes involved are exactly what you'd expect, but nothing more. Good but not great."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall a good beer."
"A bit too much bite to be drinkable, but very enjoyable in the right situation. Sip in moderation, and enjoy."
"For such a strong flavored beer I found it surprisingly drinkable. If you like malt whiskey's this beer is right up your alley."
"D: Medium drinkability. Not a bad beer but definitely not my favorite Stoutdont think it would crack the top 15."
"-UF"
"D: Unfortunately, this beer has let me down. Fortunately, I have come to subpar expect brews from Weyerbacher, so I wasn't too disapointed. Don't waste your money on this one."
"Overall, Heresy is a fantastic Imperial Stout, with quite a lot of nuisances."
"This one had been sitting in my ""cellar"" for about a year, so it was time to bring it out of hiding. Very dark, essentially black, with a chocolate brown head that showed some good retention and produced thick lacing. Aromas of vanilla, oak, smoke, and bourbon complemented the malty notes of milk chocolate, malted milk, and roasted barley quite well. Balanced hop flavour and bitterness with some chocolate and malted milk character. Drying wood/vanilla flavours and plenty of bourbon and alcohol in the finish. The malt really lingered for a long time. Full bodied and creamy with well-integrated, low carbonation. Very tasty and without the sharp edges that sometimes accompany barrel aging."
"Pours an opaque black, brown/red edges, medium brown head, nice lacing and retention. Smell is sweet, vanilla and chocolate, molasses, dark fruits and some toffee. Taste is chocolate, toffee and vanilla, oak, sweet finish, very flavourful. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation, very smooth. Nice imperial stout, very enjoyable, thanks DrJay!"
"Overall - Good stout, definitely worth a try if you have the option."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the Old Heathen. The whisky notes were phenomenal. I couldn't imagine a better take on a Russion Imperial Stout. I have seen this one before but put off buying it for some reason. The black beer has big flavors. Big malts, big hops and big whisky. This was a truly great beer. Find a bomber and share with a good buddy."
"The woody oak flavors really come out more as it warms in the second half of the glass, so let this one warm up. Mouthfeel is not thick at all, lots of carbonation, just below soda consistency, slightly astringent. Not bad, just on the lighter end of the Impy Stout spectrum. Points for the smell, points late in the game for the flavor, but I like these to be a little heavier."
"This is a good dark, rich beer to introduce newbie stout lovers to. The alcohol is not overpowering either even at 8.2%."
"Thoroughly drinkable at an appropriate temperature. This beer, maybe more than any other I've had, really needs to warm for 15 minutes or so out of the fridge."
"Very dark black. Solid. Frothy finger (long-lasting) of deep tan head, dotted with darker dots of yeast (?). Nose of cabernet vinous, oak (duh), cherries and plum, backed by bitter dark chocolate. Tastes of strong, vinous notes up front. Oak. Dark, bitter chocolate. Restrained sweetness of dark fruits and cherries is overwhelmed by the roasted chocolate and cabernet. Warming finish. Not bad. Better at room temp--more stout sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style."
"Opaque. Light tan head. Huge oak influence in the aroma giving hints of bourbon, vanilla, cream, cocoa, chocolate and roasted malt. Very complex flavor. Layers upon layers of flavor. Notes of bourbon soaked malts, vanilla, oak, roasted malt and chocolate. Im starting to enjoy these bourbon barrel aged beers. A lovely beer."
"This is a beauty to behold in a glass: a wonderful cascading head and a deep dark color. The smell is is strong and uniform, lacking complexity but imbued with malt and alcohol. The taste is strong but like the smell not overwhelming in sophistication: is it burnt malt, caramel, the oak? Not in the upper tier of imperial stouts but worthy of giving a go if you spot it on the shelves. Enjoy!"
"Purchased from The Caboose in VA with dirtylou on the way back from our Dogfish excursion last summer...cellared since then."
"Heresy leaves the 22oz bottle thanks to Kosher1337 for the trade. Smell is very complex with bourbon alcohol hitting you at the start, followed by dark chocolate and some fruity hints. First drink...surprising mouthfeel...alcohol isn't too present and taste of dark chocolate, coffee, and vanilla beans. Finishes with a very pleasant vanilla aftertaste. As it warms up it gets more complex and every drink leaves you wanting more. I wasn't expecting a lot from this beer, but it was a very pleasant surprise. It was incredibly drinkable for an Imperial Stout. This isn't the quality of a Bell's Expedition, or Brooklyn Black, but is definitely in the upper echelon Impy Stouts. Bravo to Weyerbacher."
"This is very drinkable."
"I'm really impressed with this beer. Most of Weyerbacher's oak aged beers don't turn out as well as they should, but this one is different. A heavy Imperial Stout with Milk Stout and Oatmeal Stout sweetness and creaminess. The grains contribute a solid roasted character, with chocolates, berries, cherries, and grapes. Black and as opaque as you get with a brown frothy foamstand. Balanced well and increadibly easy drinking. Milk and lactose flavors smooth the beer, but become a bit too dominant. Otherwise, a joy to drink."
"This is my third Weyerbacher beer, and although I enjoyed Blithering Idiot (if not for the clever name) and Insanity (because it's superb), I would recommend this Russian Imperial to anyone."
"A solid beer that I would not hesitate to drink again. I will say this however: If there were 10 RISs sitting in front of me though, and this was one of them, there would probably be 5 others that I would choose first."
"At 8% this beer drinks nicely, not too heavy, but warming enough. Snow falling Miles Davis ""Live at the Plaza", my wife...it's all good."
"Drinkability - intense stuff and a fine bargain at 5$/bomber. I expect this would age well for at least two to four years"
"I have little doubt that if Heresy reached my glass as its brewers intended, I'd like it at least as much, if not more, than Old Heathen. I love bourbon and applaud the use of bourbon barrels in most styles. Too bad that fate intervened and isn't allowing me to optimally experience what is probably a pretty good RIS. I'd love to have another crack at this one. Thanks to blitheringidiot for the final bottle of a great trade."
"Pitch black in color with quite the respectable tan head. Good aroma with quite the oakey notes going. Somewhat vanilla with a nice sherry tinge to it. Huge malty flavor. Very low bitterness whether roasted malt or hops. Theres a sherry/alcohol presence that is quite pleasing. Oak is very noticeable. Huge body and great oily mouthfeel. I love that when you can get it. Very enjoyable beer. Much better then Insanity from Weyerbacher. I know they are 2 different beers but both oak aged. I find this one far superior."
"Drinkability: Dam this is a very nice drinking beer. This is my favorite beer from weyerbacher. A dam fine drinking experience."
"drinkability: quite drinkable"
"Aroma was dark roasted barley malt and mild coffee/vanilla notes with a whiff of alcohol. Deep black with a beuatiful thick head. I really warmed up to this. At first it was strange because rather than bourbon it seemed to me to taste like a full chocolate/coffee infused Stout up front and then very wine like in the finish. Almost tasted like wine poured into an Impy. But I really warmed up to it and enjoyed it immensely."
"What would another year of aging produce?..."
"This one was yummy. Creamy body, 3/4"" head that held for a while, dark body with a faint red glow when held up to the light. I cant get over how much vanilla and exotic spice I tasted in this beer...so much so that ""creamy"" is the best description I can come up with...almost like coffee with a heavy dose of cream...oh and then comes the nice malt sweetness and medium dose of alcohol. Just the right amount for a heavy beer in a big bottle."
"I would suggest this to most Imperial lovers. I am very big into strong dark beers, so this was totally up my alley."
"($5.99 / 22 oz.)"
"Drinkability: Even though I enjoy this the least out of the three JB experiments (Prophecy and Insanity being the other one, and how I love the Insanity), it's still a very drinkabile beer. It took me about an hour and a half to finish the bottle as I was watching the NY Giants beat the Eagles in overtime (3rd time's a charm baby), and it was a long and pretty satisfying experience. With the Imperial Stout nature of the brew in addition to the JB barrels it's certainly a sipper, and taken like that it's a beer enjoyed as the bottle is down. I hope there are many more experiments such as these in brewing, because I'll be the first in line to see what else happens with the craziness."
"Good beer. As tasty as this beer is, it doesn't go down too well. It's fantastic, but I wouldn't want to drink too many."
"Pours a thick darkness in color with a nice creamy tan head. Head reduces to a skim layer atop the liquid. Aroma is strong in dark fruits and cream. Lots of creamy vanilla. Taste is also really creamy and rather smooth. Not as big and intense as I was thinking but more of a smooth RIS. Oak and bourbon and vanilla are all weak in here, I wouldn't have known this was oak aged except for the fact I read it on the bottle. There's a bit of some bitter cocoa in the finish. A good beer, definitely enjoyable and worth trying but it's not quite at the top of the class in respect to style."
"pours a very nice dark brown with a gorgeous tan foamy 2 in head that fizzles down a thin layer with some lacing on the sides of the glass. you can immediatley smell the oak and woods along with a bit of fruit and a little alcohol kick. a nice a pleasant taste , roasted nut, along with hops and of course the oak. a very nice smooth mouthfeel. i might limit myself to two of these"
"Tasty! The oak aging is apparent in the taste. Hints of vanilla hovering over a dark chocolatey malt base. A certain amount of hoppiness is present on the tip of the tongue. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. This is a delicious beer."
"dark brown with a good tan head. the smell is much improved over old heathen. there is a large oak character with some nice vanilla and whiskey notes in addition to the flavors and aromas of it's precursor. the chocolate is more pronounced in the smell and flavor here in addition to mild coffee aromas and flavors and dark fruits. somehow this version smells a little boozy even though it's aroma is more complex and strong here and i didn't smell any in the heathen. some nice butterscotch flavors are also newly present here. i wanna score the taste alittle higher but it doesn't deserve a 4.5 maybe a 4.25. a lightish mouthfeel with meduim carbonation. overall a big improvement over old heathen i complained of it being underwhelming in my review of it, but this beer improves in all the ways it should for the most part. this is a beer worthy of the imperial stout moniker."
"Another Malto trade, this beer was top shelf. Jet black with a tan head, I could smell the boozy old plum nose combined with the scent of oak. The beer is burnt malt and oak aged goodness wrapped in a velvet glove. The smoothness was off the charts for such a big beer. The complexity was added to by the oak aging yet no one flavour stood out over the others. Like Storm King, Rasputin and Stone Impy this is a near perfect stout."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer! Thanks to Higravity for the sample!"
"D - Going down nice and smooth. Can definitely put one of these down a little quicker than most stouts/sippers."
"First sip was a little dissapointing as I expected a richer, more tongue coating feel, however the flavour is quite nice. Very distict in it's caramel, yet sweet malt finish. Overall, though it could be a litter meaner up front I had no problem opening the second one right away..."
"I can finish this bomber with no coaxing. However, it's just not as smooth as other offerings of this style and it really boasts the alcohol."
"Dark, nearly pitch black. Thick tan foamy head. Great head retention, but not much lace. Strong roasty, oak, smoke, vanilla nose. Hints of bourbon. Good roasty character, dominated by the oak. Sweet and smoky. Oak character really comes out when it warms. Alcohol presence is somewhat noticable. Seems a bit thin for a stout of this magnitude. Very interesting, but maybe slightly overwhleming. Still, very good in small doses."
"Overall this one presented itself strongly but failed to follow through once it hit my lips. Oh well..."
"Notes: I like it somehow better thn base brew (Old Heathen Imperial Stout)"
"Heres a unique Jekyll (first half of the bottle) and Hyde (second half of the bottle) situation. If the bottom half could be bottled, this is a better product."
"Body is big chewy, and very smooth with a slick and creamy texture. Great balance and no hint of it's strength, except for that bourbon-laced reminder. A fantastic beer from one of my hometown favorite brewers."
"As the beer warms a bit, I get more and more of a buttery flavour. This beer has less and less to recommend it as I drink. Still going to slog through the bomber though."
"update: it's now about 20mins. after first reviewing this beer and i'm shocked that it's only 8%abv. drinkers beware!"
"22 ounce bottle."
"Many thanks to Brewfan for sending me the best stout I've had in recent memory"
"Drinkability is well try it hell have to try them all. For me this one looks good, even the aroma while not the best suggests better. Wouldn't buy this again or recommend expect for sampling a new brew."
"The is definitely drinkable, but it expected the oak aging to add a little more to it. A great brew nonetheless."
"Pours a one-finger brown head that fades slowly but doesn't leave much lace. Totally black color. Light carbonation and very heavy bodied. Nose is roasted coffee. Starts sweet but with a burnt coffee flavor, smooth finish. $5.85 for a 22 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma"
"It finishes sweet and smooth but quite thin for an imperial I thought. Not bad but not great."
"There are clear variations in this beer, maybe coming from barrel to barrel or batch to batch; but they just lend it that much more charm. Some bottles are more chocolatey, and some offer more vinous fruit. Some have more alcohol, and some have more wood.... it's all good! This is a really pleasant, easy to drink, very rich, and satiating brew that deserves far more mention than it gets! KUDOS!"
"Drinkability: Very good. I wouldn't mind it at all, I just like some others much more. I can't really taste any great flavor created by the oak aging."
"Black color with a foamy tan head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Smell is vanilla, and the bourbon from the oak barrels. Some roasted malt smell that comes out more in the taste. A little more hops bitterness on the aftertaste than you would expect. Very creamy heavy mouthfeel. The alchohol is a little too prominent for my taste. A very interesting beer that i would recomend is worth a try but not something i will seek out on a regular basis."
"2004 issue that was aged in my cellar for a year and consumed in June 2005. Pours a three-finger brown head of fluffy tiny bubbles. Pitch black liquid that is very very dark brown when held to light. Smells alcohol, dry grass, ashtray with hints of licorice and cumin. Hmmm...not very enticing. Yes, there's sweet malt and roast grains, but these other smells were quite noticable. Fortunately, it tastes quite good. Starts sweet with caramel and coffee, then a tang that could be black patent. Not a cherry sour like I know black patent can add to a beer, it's much smoother. Licorice was strong and chocolate was mild. Roast is present as a noticable base, not as a flavor that rises and falls. There is a nice caramel and toffee that sort of blends everything together. It tastes like that German candy Haribo Color-rado (it's a chocolate covered licorice). Thick mouthfeel and mildly carbonated."
"Mouthfeel- Very full mouthfeel. One of the thicker imperials I have had. Very smooth and low to medium carbonation. Another I would pay anything, well if anything was less than $10 a pint to try on cask."
"buttery vanillian aroma, whiskey like but without the harsh hot alcohol...also note this has sat in my fridge since it's release (mmm when was that?) the oaky vanillian whiskey notes dominate the aroma. smooth creamy and mellowed mouthfeel with a lucious viscous body...the whiskey aging definetly mellowed this beer and added some wonderful character. not much imperial stout character left in it but it picked up the whiskey notes well and there is a bit of young bit left in the aroma reminiscent of the what this was aged in...definetly worth trying and might be worth getting again."
"The taste is again very fruity at the start, along with more familiar coffeeish, toasty malt. Uber-ripe peach, musk, some tart flavors and an alcoholic undertone help to fill out an adequately carbonated mouthfeel.. taking over where the malt flavors trail off and adding depth and length to the stout. I don't recall having a stout that was this much fun (thoroughly enjoyable).. maybe a Guinness from a pristine tap."
"Bottle (courtesy of Hopdog): Poured a pitch-black color ale with a huge dark brown head with average retention. Aroma is overpowered by whisky with small traces of vanilla that are still discernable. Taste is also overpowered by the whisky aging and leaves little place to the rest of the beer. I couldnt find any chocolate/coffee taste that I usually like from Imperial Stout. Also, the warming alcohol feel really doesnt do it for me. Full body and rally good carbonation, which is bit surprising from an Imperial Stout. Too bad I didnt like that one and I probably should have started by the Old Heathen."
"Very drinkable for the sample size, though it would be hard to have more than one in a sitting. Then again, there would be no need to. This a great beer to be enjoyed by sipping its complicated flavors and enjoy each one alone and as they blend with each other. Very well done, I'll be picking this up again very soon."
"Pours an opaque black with no light penetration and a frothy tan colored head that leaves nice lacing, a menacing looking stout. Smell is breathtaking, big cocoa aroma with hints of coffee, currant, vanilla, oak and alcohol, very intriguing. The taste begins with many shades of fine chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak, a hint of diacetyl, and finishes dry, bitter and with a winey, alcoholic finish that warms. A very complex brew, the oak aging has really done this beer well. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with low carbonation but the drinkability is somewhat low because of the wine-like alcoholic finish."
"Very subtle chocolate tones. Almost an exact 2in of head. Appearance is good. Also subtle oak aromas. A smooth mouthfeel. Chocolate flavor, but with a twist; there is this interesting sweetness on the tip of my tongue, that oddly enough reminds me of a grape juice. This beer is very good; however all the flavors are very mild. Don't get me wrong this it this beers backbone! The mildness makes this beer that much more enjoyable. Best of all flavors are not too intense which makes this beer not only drinkable but also complex and well balanced."
"It's a great alternative to the morning cup o' coffee, but will cause mild stupidity if had on an empty stomach."
"Pours an opaque black with a nice head the colour of expresso froth. Aroma is of coffee, rich dark chocolate, vanilla, of course bourbon, and some wood notes. The taste is rich with chocolate and vanilla overtones. Not too sweet in fact finishes dryer than one would expect. The alcohol is noticable, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is thick, but not overly so. A bit viscous, but with enough carbonation to compensate. Drinkability is good. I would definitly buy another and another. Its funny I hate Hate Hate bourbon, but every bourbon aged beer I try I love"
"Overall, this beer was impressive. Many high alc. % beers I have had in the past dissapoint. But Heresy has a perfect blend of taste & depth in alchol %. I could only drink a couple of these in a sitting, because they are naturally strong. But I would certainly look forward to having those few, any day of the week."
"Pours out an onyx black, viscuous and thick. Smell is sweetish, but with the usual bitter coffee and chocolate overtones. Taste is complex, with the chocolate and malt in front, the bitter roasted coffee and slight hop flavor in there. As if fades, there's a vanilla/bourbon whiskey quality that lingers in the background that is quite pleasant. Loved the mouthfeel, creamy and rich. Another delicious example of the style. Recommended."
"Old Heathen is much better when those oak barrels turn it into Heresy."
"Not a bad try by the 'bacher brewers. Certainly not the best Russian I've had but I put quite a bit away when I did have it. It was had at a local beer festival and was the last brew that I sampled. It was offered on tap and was a bit warm. Most of the other brewers were pulling out and this was pretty much all that was left. I did like the chocolaty coffee, malty, oaky taste that Weyerbacher achieved. Definetly not a 'true' Russian but a pretty good variation of one. It was really creamy with a little bitter finish to it. This stout would make a nice compliment to a dessert or a good steak but I can't see making a full session of this one. Average and worth a try."
"pitch black with a pretty decent foamy head. Aroma reeks of bourbon, along with some vanilla and spicy alcohol.Taste is equally heavy on the bourbon (nice) while infusing some dark fruit, coffe, and vanilla beans in there, along with some rather unwelcome alcohol. Mouthfeel is slick and actually a bit dry in the finish. The barrels really make an impact here..nice. drinkability is good for an imp stout. Dominion Oak Barrel on steroids...very nice"
"A very dark black (ink) beer. Has a large brown head. The smell of alcohol and whiskey permiates the aroma. With hints of coffee and vanilla hidden in the background. The flavor starts out with anoticable vanilla note. Followed by some roasted malt bitterness. Then the alcohol and whiskey characters kick in. All ending in a coffee and licorice finish."
"Drinkability: Definitely no shortage of character here, but its a bit rougher than I remembered from before, and rougher than I think an imperial stout should be. Definitely worth a try, but I doubt Ill seek out this beer again."
"I don't know how they do it... first Insanity, now Heresy... but keep them coming, Weyerbacher!"
"Beer is good. Happy BIG 8.0 % beering."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a wonderful beer. It's just about perfect. Thank God for Weyerbacher, they really do have some great beers, and this is one of them. One of the best Stouts you'll ever have."
"Pours a dark brown or black into a tulip glass, leaving a 1 inch tan head w/ lots of edge lacing on the glass and a nice surface layer after dissipating just a bit. Aromas are lots of chocolate and bourbon. The oaken barrel smell comes through also. I also get some slight caramels on the nose; it kinda reminds me of a Werther's Original candy. Taste is brown roasted malts w/ some chocolate flavors up front and some bourbon tones on the finish along with the overall alcohol feel. Nice balance between the sweetness and the alcohol. Feel is great! The carbonation is well balanced with a full-bodied brew and the alcohol throughout. Awesome in my opinion. Drinkability is nice. Full-bodied and tough to ""slug"" but a great great brew!"
"Drinkability is good. Somewhat less that I expected as far as complexity, yet it was refreshingly drinkable."
"Decent stout with a bourbon like flavour, syrup rather than thick flavour, a tad sour. Black, roasty smell, not too creamy. First taste is wood. Then some chocolate, and roast, bit of vanilla and spot of coffee, sugar. Well carbonated. Medium mouthfeel. Slightly less in a tasting a few weeks later."
"Drinkability - Definitely a tasty beer that is more complicated than it's younger brother, Old Heathen. Would serve better as an apiritif, digestif, or as an after dinner drink than an every day drinker. I was given a case as a gift and I expect to hold on to half of it for more experiences in the next few years."
"Weyerbacher is really making a name for itself in my book."
"Very interesting beer. Worth a try certainly."
"Knocked off my feet by the nose on this beer. Usually that is what I find least impressive about any beer. But this beer's aroma just makes you think youcrawled into the oak barrel it was aged in. I know it is not there, but I was also thinking there could've been some raspberries just in the aroma. It poured a rich and deep chocolate brown in color, with two inches of head on it. Lace would form, but then slide down the glass. The flavor is rich in toffee, coffee and chocolate. A touch of oatmeal and raisins. And something else, almost dried apples. The mouthfeel is also a little dry. After my 22oz bottle I was craving another."
"I liked the brewery's base imperial stout more than this one. Heresy is well balanced, and very drinkable, but the oak aging only adds a fresh sawdust wood component here. Some whisky barrel oak wood would have made this a bit more interesting."
"This one is very interesting and very well done. I don't think the oak or the alcohol dominated which was what I was afraid of initially. Very drinkable due to it's complexity. I will definitely be back."
"An outstanding innovation for the Russian Imperial Stout class."
"Very drinkable not overpowering in any one aspect."
"Deep black almost light absorbing in its intensity with a thin tan head. A draping of lace is left down the side of the glass as I tip it to drink. The nose has a light roasted malt aroma with a very bright alcohol character (I mean this in a good way). It also has chocolate and something more cherry, or black cherry. Is this coming from the oak-aging? The taste delivers a definite sweetness up front. Cherries, I detected in the nose along with a richer chocolaty taste. The roasted malt is much more subtle than I expected, and the alcohol character doesnt show up until late, late in the finish. This has a rich, velvety mouth feel (love that in my stouts). Great drinkability. This oak-aging really brings a great character to this beer."
"I'll pass on this one from now on."
"The mouthfeel is quite smooth. Not overly carbonated. Quite nice."
"Pours a very dark color with very little head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma was mostly bourbon and vanilla. Some cherries in there as well. The flavor had a strong bourbon presence along with hints of vanilla and chocolate. Very well-done. I enjoyed this one a lot. Nice body and drinkability was ok."
"The beer poured a nice black color with a small head that fell to ring the beer. The nose was all about bourbon. Chocolate, vanilla, sweet cherry all hit me very strong. The flavor was much the same as the nose, lots of bourbon, vanilla with chocolate more in the background. The feel was thick and creamy. Very full feeling. Drinkability was good. I really like bourbon, but this was maybe a touch too strong. Overall, this was a great beer."
"22oz. bomber poured into a snifter. It pours a jet black color with one finger of tan head. No lacing left on the glass. The smell hits you with a good dose of bourbon. Lots of charred oak and vanilla. The taste is malty with more bourbon and vanilla, and even a hint of chocolate. A little bit of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is super thick, but is still very smooth. The drinkability is pretty nice for 8%. A nice stout."
"Relaxed with this one after decorating our home for the holidays. From a 22 ounce bottle, it pours a thick, heavy black. My first thought was that it was reminiscent of draining motor oil. A thin, ¼ inch head initially forms, but quickly fades into small wispy patches. The aroma has strong chocolate, cherry, alcohol, wood, and pepper smells. Its not quite as intense an aroma as Id expected, but its undoubtedly complex, full, and interesting. The taste is, however, a delight. Chocolate and intense hops with a touch of alcohol warming. The mouthfeel is smooth, slightly slippery/oily, creamy, and thick. Its terrifically enjoyable."
"Drinkability & Notes: Flavorful yet the oak character is mild to the point of being hidden, regardless this was an enjoyable beer."
"Oily black color in the glass but lets a bit of light through in the pour. Thick and frothy head that lasts almost the entire glass. Decent lacing as well. The aroma smells strongly of Merlot or Shiraz, with coffee and malt too. Rich bodied and kind of sharp on the tongue. Malt, sherry, fruit and coffee are the predominant flavors. The finish is roasty and vinous. I like Old Heathen pretty well but honestly this barrel-aged iteration doesnt really seem to add too much."
"Thanks to BlueEcho for providing this interesting brew. It poured a dark, earthy black with red hints to its meniscus. There was a bit of an oily bnrown head, but that has passed away with sipping and contemplation. The aroma is alcoholic with strong chocolate undercurrents. It's quite an intense aroma for a 7% brew. The flavors are more complex. Initially there's a sharp hop bite with some cherry and vanilla notes. The flavors attenuate bringing out chocolate flavors, with some scattered oak and coffee notes. The lingering finish is reminiscent of fine dark chocolate. It's quite delightful, but I'm a sucker for chocolate. The mouthfeel is peculiar. It's quite watery, but the unfermented sugars impart a bizarre texture in the finish. Other than that, its a delightful and drinkable brew."
"A very dark brew, with an airy head on pouring, which disappeared rapidly. There seems to be some oilyness or other haze on the surface. Aromas include strong oak and alcohol notes, as well as some roasted chocolate or coffee. The first flavors to hit my tounge were of cherry, vanilla, and chocolate, with supporting tastes of oak and malt. Light to moderate mouth feel: lots of space initially but leaves a coating on the palate. Overall, a good beer but not exceptional."
"Pours a deep dark brown with some reddish hues. Nice soft light brown head. Lot of caramel, vanilla and chocolate tones. Smells awesome. WOW! The palate is amazing. Chocolate, vanilla, smels like coffee ice cream with chocolate sauce. The oaky tannins do show up in the nose. Like a red wine aged in new oak barrels. Creamy, rich finish. Mouthfeel is rich and coating, with a slightly bitter, charred wood finish. Much better than some other barrel aged beers where all you taste is the bourbon and alcohol. Very well done and a good balance of the stout and the oak. Hope this is available in a regular basis, as I would love to get some more of this. Try this one for sure!"
"Aroma, Holy Bourbon! smells like a bottle of maker's mark. Also hints of caramel, vanilla, and toffee. Very big alcohol hits too. First sip, very smooth and creamy texture, nice gentle rolling carbonation. Flavor is bourbon, toffee sweet and some strong caramel and vanilla mixing with some chocolate malt as well. This is a very smooth beer that is easy to drink even though the advertised nose makes you think sipper. QUite a good beer now, wonder how the other bottle will fare in a year???"
"Burnt, burnt, burnt -- there's a lot of charred remains in this beer. Lots of black malt, burnt dark chocolate sauce, vanilla through mid-palate, and some notes of strong liqueor. This has a lot going on, and the alcohol plays a dominant role. But I don't know that I've ever had such a burnt flavored beer -- that really sticks out in my mind."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head is dense and seemingly long-lasting, with bits of foamy lacing left here and there. Aroma reminds me of cake batter, for what its worth. So I guess that's strong vanilla notes, with touches of grains and alcohol. is strongly of buttery toasted caramel, overpoweringly so, leaving little room for other notes to present themselves. Flavor is pretty powerfully of vanilla, dark fruits, dark malts, and alcohol. nutty caramel malts, with a slight sour and/or fruity underlying taste that I didn't expect. Mouthfeel is good, and the drinkability's a but lower, with the strong flavors just limiting the experience a bit. Check this one out for the vanilla..."
"Huge puffy two fingers of tan head on this one. Smells like a strong red wine to me, alcohol and chocolate malts as well. Real funky. Smooth cappucino taste, with malts up the wazoo and a very subtle alcohol taste. Definate silky red wine feel to it too with a touch of bitterness. So smooth in the mouth, not thick or chewy like some stouts. Very drinkable mainly because of it's consistency, but indeed a challenge to put down a bunch of this stuff. Definately scores points for being unique."
" Alot going on with complex brew. I seem to enjoy a brew that favors a stong alcohol flair.Thisone backed by the oak is smooth and easy, aiding its drinkability."
"Not a beer I would seek out again, though worth a try for stout lovers nevertheless."
"This beer poured a jet-black inky color that when held to the light showed an outline of cocoa brown all around the edges, and as thick and dense to not allow any light to pass through. With several pours the average created a tiny foam head that was cocoa brown in color somewhat thin, slightly creamy and sticky at times, but not long lasting. With a vigorous pour, I noticed the head as a thick and rich and a few inches tall, with medium sized carbonation bubbles packed somewhat densely, but not long lasting either as it also fell to nothing less then a ring on the edges of the glass. At times I noticed some lace trying to form, but nothing much then a mere small group of carbonation bubbles trying to hold on. Also noticeable was that this beer seemed to be fairly carbonated. The aromas that it gave off were at first of a bourbon/whisky-esk note, not overly powerful but definitely noticeable, it blended with aromas of cocoa powder, fresh cut/split vanilla bean, the wooden oak barrel it was aged in (this was noticeable all through the nose), a wistershire sauce, some dark fruits, caramel, earth tones near the end, oat grains, dark malts and then it finished up with the warmth of alcohol tingling the nose. The first sip was surprisingly sweet with tones of alcohol and bourbon. But after the second tasting I noticed that it still had some sweet tones but all the flavors came forth: alcohol bourbon, sweet chocolate, caramel, fresh vanilla, a dry wood  the oak barrel, earth tones, slate and ash and coal where noticeable all through out, near the middle to back of the swallow more chocolates dark malts, dark sweet fruits and finally ended with dry cocoa, ash and alcohol flavors. One think noticeable was that the bourbon was all through out the taste. After each swallow I was left with warmth of alcohol. The body was medium to slightly heavy at times as it warmed up even more. It was smooth and creamy overall. I tried this beer first directly from the case that was sitting out on the floor of the distributor room temperature and was wowed. I stuck the case in the fridge when I got home and tried one at the cooler temp and was not impressed, it tasted like the Weyerbacher Imperial Stout, good but not what I was looking for, so I determined that room temperature was the way to go to bring out all the flavors that were supposed to be there. Over all I liked this beer, a good sipping beer, and a good experiment from the brewery and brewer. I cant wait for the next oak barrel series with one of there other beers. I would drink again on a cold day. Also I would like to add that I rather liked the label, and the name as well. Seems to fit."
"i will definately have another as this is a unquie brew that deserves praise."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin for me and and possibly a bit too carbonated. I enjoy my impy's with a bit thicker body. Drinkability is good. Quite an enjoyable brew...but it's more of a brew that I'd drink one of every now and again. If you like bourbon or even if you just like impy stouts, I recommend checking this one out. Thanks to blitheringidiot for the bottle!"
"Heresy. A suitable name for a method of maturation that is still just being explored by American brewers. Weyerbacher explores it well, and captures all the loud complexities and subtle nuances that oak barrel aging has to offer beer."
"An interesting blend of chocolate, coffee, & bourbon. Wonderfull depth of vanilla flavour opens up as it warms. Medium body, articficial feeling carbonation."
"Drinkability: This stuff is just ok. Interesting at best due to its bourbon-like qualities but I probably wouldn't have it again. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be tried at least once by all BAs though."
"the more I drink of this, the more I like it. Doesn't blow me oway, but that's okay..."
"This stout by Weyerbacher has a very distinct whiskey smell that is much stronger than its actual presence in the flavor. Low carbonation gives the pour a very shallow head. It has a lot of dark chocolate characteristic with a slightly smoky finish from the oak barrel aging. This beer should definately be served in small servings and would pair nicely with a black forest torte for a desert course. Overall, it is worth the pricetag, especially for the uniqueness of the oak barrel aging and the whiskey notes that it imparts."
"Smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability is low, this is a strong, heavy brew meant for sipping. Great name for a brew, one of my favorites to date."
"There is a nice roasted chocolate malt flavor as well as rich coffee. There is a touch of molasses that is noticeable as well as some dark cherries. There is a little citrus hop flavor that comes through in a quiet manner but quickly fades and then leaves you w/ the prior flavors. Heresy is another good brew by Weyerbacher with a very distinct and enjoyable flavor."
"I thought that the Old Heathen was surprisingly drinkable given the 8%abv, but the Heresy has the opposite effect; The alcohol character makes this guy seem a lot heavier than its abv. Worth a try if you're into this style; but it's a slow sipper."
"This review is from the 12 oz bottled version, though having this from the tap was a wee bit better. This brew is extremely thick, deep and viscous, black with a thin tan head that quickly recedes to a thin ring sticking to the edges of the glass. Flavor pales in complexity to the aroma; vanilla, burboun whiskey, chocolate, toffee, taffy all present in the nose. A slightly off woody flavor encompasses each sip, blending with the domination of burnt maltiness and the subtle vanilla and alcohol. The draught version seemed to be fuller and better balanced. One that I would have again either way though...good, but not exceptional."
"I have to admit that Im a complete sucker for bourbon or whiskey aged Imperial stouts. Its perhaps the greatest combination of flavors in the alcoholic world, but this one is a bit different. Instead of smelling of the liquor and having that interesting vanilla flavor/aroma as a sideproduct, this bad boy tastes like it was aged in an oak cask once used to make vanilla extract with the whiskey being a side note. Theres also a LOT of oak involved in the flavor. This is much better than the plain Old Heathen. Chocolate dominates the malt."
"Black pour, honest tan head for a beer of this magnitude, leaving a nice cover after a few minutes. Big aroma, fruity, chocolatey with obvious bourbon and oak notes. I dont recognize the melon bubble-gum characteristics of the old heathen, but its fruitier than most, grapeish somewhat. Sweet palate full of vanilla and tartish woody, minty and roasty notes. It doesnt really have anything to set it apart from other barrel-aged imperials Ive had, but theyre all pretty good, arent they? Not so big bodied, lets call it medium bodied and carbonation is restrained. It doesnt have the grace of movements nor intensity of a speedway, but its also a good deal cheaper and a great value + easy to drink for the style."
"Bomber bottle. Pours thick and gooey, rich and thick. Nose of burnt fruit, figs,malt,licorish. Full bodied and filling. Dark tan head, lovely tiny bubble film and classy,intricate lacing. Notes of figs,raisins,heaps of malt and mellow hops. Fine, rich after dinner brew. Mellow and satisfying finish. This stuff is tasty and very pleasant now, Might be a great one to put away and mature for even more mellowness."
"This came out looking like some used motor oil with an excellent tall brown head of rocky foam sitting atop. A very appetizing looking imperial stout to say the least. There was scattered lace left around the glass as this was consumed. Scents of chocolate, Coffee, roasted malt and a light alcohol rose from the snifter. A bit of oak in the nose to add to the mix makes this an all around good smelling brew. Taste has most of the same elements as the nose with dark chocolate and a roasted malt flavor being dominant. The alcohol was only detected after this had warmed up a bit. Mouthfeel was good and creamy with a full body. Pretty good drinkability as well with this being a tasty brew and no characteristics that would keep me from revisiting this. This just might be my favorite new beer from Weyerbacher, too bad it isnt available locally. Thanks to Cornboy for the trade."
"Drinkability: Not good. One little glass was more than enough, and might have been too much in the first place."
"I expected some sort of balancing of flavors to occur, but instead found the tastes and aromas to be quite separate and distinct."
"This brew is a love-hate for me. There is so much that makes it great, but for some. Looks great when it pours out deep and black, Smells full and rich in so many ways. The problem is the oak shines through over the other flavors, it detracts some for me. I mean the Oak is a nice addition, but to much can kill. I wanted more malt and chocolate, and the abv shined through more then I would like. Good, but not something to go nuts over. Nice though"
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy dark brown color that slowly fades. The aroma is perfect. It has a very rich and malty scent that boasts of chocolate malts and a creamy finish. It smells like chocolate frosting. The taste is great as well. It has a smooth chocolate flavor with a sweet creamy finish. It is quite complex and extremely tastey. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine imperial stout. It has it all; a good drinker."
"What a beautifully blended brew. Poured a deep, deep caramel with a chunky head. Smells were rich,,,caramel, oak and alcohol presence. Taste was rich..essences of caramel, vanilla, alcohol and oak ...a beautiful blend. Mouthfeel is full-bodied....well-rounded...don''t guzzle...just enjoy. For the ABV very drinkable...highly recommended."
"Before I even crack this bottle open and review it, I have to say that I donnot drink liquor. I don't care for it, Jagermeister is as far as I seem to go when it comes to booze. But I'm doing this like all of my reviews, objectively. OK, that out of the way, it pours an opaque darkest brown color with a short-lived light to medium brown head. Roasty malts, black patent, bourbon and chocolate coated dark cherry aromas. Pretty intriguing, smells like the illegitimate offspring of a Manhattan and an imperial stout. It has the roasty qualities of Old Heathen like chocolate, coffee and caramel, but the sweetness of the residual bourbon from the barrels adds and interesting twist and extra dimension to the overall experience. The bourbon taste is not overwhelming, but its presence is surely noticable. Not bad. Carbonation is decent and drinkability is fair. I would have rather split it with a friend than to tackle this one by myself."
"The body of the beer was purely opaque black with shades of brown. The head was miserly and died away in a very short time. The aroma of powdered cocoa and vanilla was very strong and blocked out all other smells. The taste was a lot sweeter than I anticipated. It was full of vanilla, chocolate, raisin and pear flavors, followed by a distinct oak aftertaste. The hop bitterness was minimal, and the alcohol was quite well covered. The beer felt a bit weaker than an Imperial Stout should. It was approachable and complex, but lacked the boldness that should be the hallmark of an Imperial Stout. A tasty treat, thanks to Lupe and BIF 10."
"The taste is very complex with a definite taste of the bourbon and oak but not to the point of overwhelming the beer. There are hints of molasses, coffee, and chocolate along with the sweetness of the malt. This is very full-bodied and rich in the mouth, almost thick. I found this to be a real hit from Weyerbacher. Can't wait to get another bottle."
"What the hell did I just buy? I had high hopes for Heresy based on some of the buzz I have heard about it combined with my like of Weyerbacher products. The moment you pop the top, the smell of bourbon hits your face. That was not a good start for me. I quickly remember that I am not a fan of bourbon. The stout pours a pitch black color with a quickly dissipating head. It certainly looks like an Imperial Stout but the smell of bourbon and oak are too strong for me. I can detect some roasted malt aroma hiding in there somewhere. The first sip hits you with that strong bourbon taste with some sweetness behind it and it wasnt getting any better for me from there. I bought a 12oz bottle that I split with my girlfriend and that was too much for me. I had a real hard time finishing this one. If you are a bourbon fan, than this stout is for you. As far as I am concerned, I will stick with the Old Heathen."
"Tasted in my Hoegaarden Grand Cru tulip goblet. Whisky cocoa and alcohol warmness in the nose. Sticky quite thick milk chocolate colored head. Black opeque look in the glass. Inital whisky woody taste, then the brews dries on the finish with powdered unsweetened cocoa and bitterness. The mouth is a little thin IMHO. It is a nice beer and is interesting but does not live up to its possible potential."
"Thanks also to garthwaite for getting this out to Seattle. Garthwaite mailed it, skyhand brought it, RoyalT poured it, and cschwaz drank it. What a team!"
"Backwash: Sorry to resort (again) to a wine analogy, but this beer is much like a characterless bulk Chardonnay from Australia or California thats been oaked within an inch of its life! Now some Chardonnays can withstand a lot of oak (e.g. Beringer Private Reserve), but they need to be able to stand up to the wood. This doesnt do that. And worse, it has to contend with both the wood AND the bourbon. Supposedly this is Old Heathen aged in barrels used for both Jack Daniels (sour mash) and Jim Beam (bourbon). Im not a huge fan of Old Heathen to begin with, and it certainly doesnt improve here. I think it would be a lot better if the the oak and bourbon influences were reduced a bit (diluted with more regular Old Heathen and perhaps some plain oak barrels). Im a huge bourbon fan (less so JD), but this doesnt work very well. Perhaps some age will marry this better, but I cant recommend it for now. If you must, I'd recommend you add a nip of your favorite bourbon to your favorite stout."
"Appearance: Pitch black big thick tan head very impressive appearance leaves thick broad bands of lacing. Aroma: Fusel alcohol tones can be picked up in the orgy of deep dark chocolate smokey wood from the whiskey barrel aging in both Jim and Jack barrels very complex and big. Taste: A wave of soft milk chocolate with the whiskey barrel aging adding a complexity to this Imperial Stout that is just amazing. Smokey with hints of oak some strong espresso from dark roasts very big brew but enjoyable at the same time. Mouthfeel: Not as thick as I was anticipating medium bodied creamy textured very nice even carbonation making this a smooth sipper all the way. Drinkability: Overall I'm impressed with this Weyerbacher creation sometimes they don't do it for me but this one is truly innovative and delicious. I could definitely go for another because this brew balances all of the complex flavors involved so nicely higher abv but that's expected with a barrel aged imperial stout very nice brew."
"Overall, this an amazing beer that you will almost certainly enjoy if you like stouts and/or bourbon."
"The taste is wonderfully rich and complex...while you do get some of the whiskey in the palate, it's still definitely and wholeheartedly a stout. The alcohol isn't predominate or overpowering. Just nice layers of chocolate, coffee, molassas, and...whiskey. As a nice afterthought. Overall, thoroughly enjoyable, and highly, highly drinkable. Yum!"
"On tap at the Grey Lodge in Philly. Beautifully dark and luscious with a creamy khaki head that reduced down to a little ring and thin covering. Scents of portwine and sherry, yummmm.... Wonderfully creamy but not heavy, not too rich at all. Served at the perfect temperature. Very minor amount of carbination. It just feels so good and smooth, almost like a cask conditioned. Dark and coffee flavors, but no burnt flavors. Great flavor without being overpowering. Beautiful oakiness. More of a vanilla extract flavor than of vanilla beans, most likely due to the 8% alcohol. This is such a great freaking stout and man is this just so easy to drink!"
"this one pours an awesome, black as night colour with a thick deep tan head. no complaints in the appearance department here. the smell is nice, though the alcohol can be a bit overpowering at times. whiskey, malt and chocolate prevail here along with the afformentioned alcohol smell and subtle oak notes. since beer is my alcoholic drink of choice 99% of the time, i haven't had bourbon in quite some time, and, needless to say, i had forgotten my distaste for it. that said, the flavour balance here is quite nice, being pretty much 50/50 bourbon/stout, meaning you've got the super strong alcohol flavour mixed with the chocolate and malt and other various flavours of the lovely old heathen, and in the finish, i'm finally picking up the vanilla flavour that others have noted. the mouthfeel is both tingly and creamy at the same time. very different and interesting. if you like bourbon, this is definitely a beer for you. if you're like me and aren't into the stuff, i'd suggest you use your $4.50 or so on something else. overall, a good beer, but not for me."
"Weyerbacher can be hit-or-miss sometimes. This is a home run."
"The taste is rich with roasted nutty flavors. The alcohol peeks through, but on the whole, is well hidden. The texture and body is a tad light. I think a little more body would be an improvement. Not to say that this isnt smooth  it is. Smooth and mellow. Finishes with a nice oak accent and a touch of roasted bitter sharpness. The bourbon barrel aging is surely evident. Which is good. It doesnt leave you guessing what that elusive flavor you might be detecting is. I think its just perfect in this beer. Like a fine bourbon, aging has taken their Old Heathen stout and turned it into something extraordinary. A great beer."
"If you like, I mean REALLY like, bourbon- this is your beer. If you are looking for any hint of stout flavors, you will want to pass on this one. I kind of liked the overpowering flavor at first, but about halfway through the 22 oz bottle I was sick of it. I wanted a beer. I had a hard time finishing this one. I would recommend splitting one with two or three friends."
"This is an incredibly rich beer from an olfactory standpoint. I sensed vanilla and pipe tobacco on the nose, which can best be summed up as organic or aromatic. It is also reminiscent of silage, for which you must be a farmer to understand. It is all of the spent grain and detritus from a harvest that is left to ferment in a silo before being fed to the animals. NOT an unplaeasnt smell, however, just sweet and earthy. The beer, itself, poured like motor oil - thick, viscous stuff that cried out to be tasted. It put me in mind of maple syrup in terms of the color. It had a smooth finish with an oaky aftertaste with a lingering flavor of bourbon on the tongue and in the mouth."
"On a side note, I have two more bottles, and am hoping that age will mellow these out a lot! Probably won't try it again for another year."
"The mouthfeel was smooth with a touch of a creamy texture, and ended smooth. The tastebuds had roasted malts and chocolate lingering for a bit after swallowing. Nicely drinkable and the alcohol isn't overpowering with this imperial stout."
"All in all I LOVED this stout, I would recommend it to anyone. My friend Hector dining with me took a tentative taste, and being inexperienced with stouts he was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it, as he usually prefers ales and pilsners. He even asked for an additional taste a short time later! :)"
"Overall - If you can get your hands on it, go grab a case, six, whatever. This is an absolute MUST TRY. An excellent brew that hopefully will get some to stop hating on Weyerbacher."
"Wow, another winner in the Weyerbacher range! That's right folks, it has happened again. Out of the 20+ Weyerbacher beers that I have had, this is definately one of the three very awesome ones (The other two being the regular old heathen and the rasp. imperial stout) Apparantly Old Heathen is a very good beer, and one that can get better with additional tweaking. This barrel aged version of Old Heathen is a dark black colour, that is nearly opaque. Their are slightly burnt bloody edges to this beer as well. The head is tan and lasts for quite some time. It really is a nice presentation. The aroma is of bourbon, vanilla, oak, roasted malts, heavy cream, chocolate, and mild espresso. The taste follows suit, with all of the previously mentioned flavors blending into something quite creamy, smooth, and wonderful. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and the drinkability is very, very good. Congratulations Weyerbacher!"
"Poured with a minimal tan head over black colored liquid. Nose is very heavy on the Jack Daniels/bourbon thing, some roasty chocolate lies behind that. The taste was very mouthcoating with slick, oily chocolate, oakiness, more bourbon smoothness with a touch of malty sweetness...heavy on the palate. Finished silky smooth and chocolatey, a superb dessert beer but be forewarned: if your not into bourbon overtones this may not be your cup of tea."
"Zum wohl!"
"The Ben and Jerry's Brownie Batter ice cream and glass of water I had nearby two bottles of this beer tasted more like a oak-aged stout than these supposed ones did. I tried to enjoy this beer, twice, I swear."
