"As you might guess I really like this stuff, maybe as much as some of the 4.75s I gave under the old system. Find this, cellar this , drink this!"

"Not the same animal as CCB's Hunapuh, but probably the finest baseline RIS on the planet. Outstanding beer. This is what a Russian Imperial Stout should taste like."

"Overall: I have had a lot of stouts, this is a very good one, on par with some of the best, but its not the best I have had and considering the difficulty obtaining it, I would say its worth seeking out if you are interested otherwise there are a lot of great options out there these days. I would love to try a barrel aged version of this, I imagine it would be amazing!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good RIS for the cold winter months. Being named for a Soviet hero is just appropriate for their cold weather climate and how stunningly thick and bitter this beer is."

"Pours from the bottle the color and viscosity of motor oil, with a nice finger of mocha head. Smells of cocoa, dark fruit and warm spices. It tastes much as it smells. Chocolate, cinnamon, plum and cherry. Maybe a touch of coffee. The alcohol is hidden well, only providing a little warmth. Slightly bitter finish. Medium mouth that coats the tongue well. Just a really well-made stout."
""
""
"Excellent. Very unique Russian imperial stout.  Nice Notes of dark roast coffee and tobacco"
"Slightly dry aftertaste."
""
"O: This is everything a stout should be one of the most beautiful and rich examples it's roasty slightly coffee tasting thick lush on the mouth it's a delight to drink.  This is a beg borrow or steal kind of stout do yourself a favor find it."
"750 mL bottle from a Sat., 12/20/2014 Better Beer Authority Bottle Share (thanks, Richard H..), unknown vintage (2013?), poured into a BBA snifter glass, drank over 15 minutes"
"Soy sauce and rancid green beans on the nose. Soy sauce and hot asphalt on the pallet. Hope this is an off bottle, will revisit again."

"Shared a bomber with a friend.  Pours black, almost a purple and completely opaque.  No head.  Smell is fresh espresso and bittersweet cocoa.  Faint hint of brown sugar.  Mouth feel is full and rich like a fresh cup of mocha coffee.  Taste is so complex yet balanced.  Toffee, coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, molasses and maybe a hint of tobacco.  Perfect balance.  Incredibly delicious!"

"Overall: This is a big stout with a huge amount of both bitter and sweet. I wouldn't exactly call it balanced but it packs a ton of flavor and is fairly drinkable. An enjoyable, big experience. (4.25)"
"Bottom Line: Great RIS, defining the style."

"This beer is just amazing"
""
""

"Thick, rich and chewy. Viscous and frothy. Sweet, with burnt notes at the back end. The bitterness lingers a bit - too much? Bah, no matter. Just about as good as a RIS gets. World class. Got to be in my top five for the style."

"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 7/11/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark brown head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, tobacco, light char/smoke, raisin, prune, and roast/smoke earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of big dark/roasted malt and moderate dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, tobacco, light char/smoke, raisin, prune, and roast/smoke earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, tobacco, light char/smoke, raisin, prune, and roast/smoke earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and moderate dark fruit flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible imperial stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An incredibly amazing offering."
""
"It is a well balanced delicious beer."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is jet black with a ruby edging, with no head.  Nose of bourbon, coffee, earthy notes, molasses, and booze.  Flavors are smooth coffee and chocolate, with a solid booze undertone, char notes, and rich molasses.  Wow! Velvety smooth body, with a rich, bittersweet, smooth aftertaste.  The finish is slick, with a solid linger.  Huge, but drinkable."

"Picked up a couple bottles of MZ 2014 and decided to drink one now and cellar the other bottle.  I had high expectations for this RIS being a big fan of Cigar City but was underwhelmed.  Although it has a nice jet black color and layer of tannish foam the aroma did not appeal to me.  Smells very boozy and I pick up some notes of licorice and tobacco but they are overpowered by the boozy smell.  The taste again was very boozy which didn't allow me to fully appreciate the chocolate, tobacco and licorice flavors.  I also found the bitterness to be too much (I like hoppy beers so it's not that I don't like a bitter beer in general).  Again, it overpowers the other flavors and doesn't do much for the balance.  I'm going to cellar my second bottle for a year or two and maybe all the flavors will come together and offer a completely different/better beer."

"I was really looking forward to trying the 2013 Zhukov. I opened the bottle and noticed a strange aroma, but when I poured it it looked delicious. I took another whiff and wow this smelled horrible. The taste was just as bad. I'm so disappointed but I hope I get to try this again."

"O- Nice RIS. I wish I could have gotten a bottle to age and see if the sweetness dies down a bit"
"The 2014 is way better than 2013. Had a pint while waiting for the bottle release at Cigar City on August 4th, 2014. The 2013 has a ""bread"" taste to it. This year its much more crisp and refreshing. Hard to believe that there were 200+ people in line for this when last year on release day I waited in a 3 person line."

"Pours a nice dark beer. Doesn't form much of a head, yet some bubbles form. Smells like coffee. Taste is a bit hard to pinpoint, probably my first CCB beer. It has a very nice body, and has that cognac taste of imperial stouts. Very nice."

""
"Overall, Cigar City has created a beer with no faults. It's literally a perfect beer; so good there's nothing to even nitpick about."
"The beer pours with a beautiful mocha head, but otherwise its inky black. Nose of dark chocolate and raisins. It unfolds in a complex and perfectly balanced set of flavors: Maraschino cherries, cocoa, raisins and espresso. The mouthfeel is perfect. This is all around one of the best beers I've tasted. Cheers to Cigar City."

"Pours midnight black with an almost black head , smells of toasted malts and chocolate , thick tasting beer , almost like taking a bite instead of a drink. Overall this is one of the best Non BA stouts I have ever had , glad I have more put back and will be tracking more down"

"This beer pours fabulously thick and dark, and coats the glass amazingly. Big chocolate and molasses aromas. The flavor is a little boozy, a little funky, and a little smoky, with lots of molasses and some more chocolate malt. I tend to prefer coffee and vanilla notes over molasses, but I still enjoyed this, and it is no doubt a fantastic imperial stout. World-class."

"Mouthfeel is great, no doubt a full bodied pretty heavy beer, a nice long lingering flavor. Nice moderate carbonation level, small bubbles tickle your mouth most of the way through. Silky smooth with a nice bitter finish that isn't too try or too gritty. Nice flavorful beer that's excellent the whole way through. A crazy good sipper that's super decadent, but drinkable enough for any stout lover to enjoy on their own, but I'd recommend sharing, even though I'm being selfish right now and not!"

"This is what an imperial stout should taste like.. perfectly balanced, rich, complex, flavorful. Doesn't need a barrel or a boat load of crazy ingredients to make it world class."
"Overall a great beer but not my favorite IS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's my favorite beer for a reason... It's the top of the line in my opinion for what a RIS should be. Just great and next year I will probably buy a case instead of 2 bottles so it lasts me until the next year. I even trade for this beer when I run out because I love it that much. It's the epitome of what CCB is known for in stouts."

"Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout from Cigar City was something that I picked up at Yankee Spirits in Sturbridge, Ma based solely on the BA rating card place in front it on the store shelf. I trust the BA ratings and in this case they were right on. Tremendous stout to say the lease, and a total surprise that a beer this good could come from Florida. Have it again since my first taste and still rate it as one of best stouts that i have had. My buddy was in Florida recently and I told he had to go to Cigar City and have a Marshal Zhukov. He did, and he liked it so much he went again the next day to have it again. Great beer if you like stouts. Right up there with Goose Bourbon County, KBS and Old Rasputin."

"Pours black as pitch, light cannot penetrate. Looks like motor oil in the glass! The head was thin and dark, dark brown. Chocolate, dark fruit, licorice on the nose, nice aroma. Sweet up front with hints of anise and licorice. Dark chocolate follows with a great dark fruit, slightly bitter finish. Thick mouthfeel with no carbonation to speak of. Overall, this may well be the greatest non-BA Russian Imperial Stout I've ever had!"

"wow. an extremely impressive stout here, one of the best ive ever had. who needs a barrel when you've got Zhukov? luxurious pour, velvety dark chocolate color with a rising bubbly and thick mocha head. so so dark on the malt. its short of being burnt, but its chocolaty and a touch smoky in the nose, and more earthy and mineral heavy in the flavor. in certain high end espressos, the connoisseurs tell you to look for blueberry and other fruit notes. I get that here, amidst the coffee notes, some dark fruits as well, very nice, subtle complexity. chocolate too is robust, not sweet but bitter and raw. the darkness of this is lovely, so deep and rich, but im finding it a lot more drinkable than I should at 11% abv. my friends left right after we cracked a 750 of this, and im having no trouble at all doing the heavy lifting here. full bodied but not filling. im enjoying it more and more as it warms. this is a world class example of the style, and proof of the fact that we don't need to put every stout out there in a bourbon barrel to make it special. brilliant stuff from cigar city."

"Pour is deep, viscous black with a frothy white head and great lacing. Big leather, roasty, black licorice, pruney, raisins, caramelly, anise, and brown sugary aroma. Taste is deep dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso, anise, black licorice, earthy, a touch of grass, leather, and char with a roasted bitter finish. Thick oily mouthfeel with soft carbonation. Rich, decadent and very smooth for 11%. Nice!"

"Very dark three finger thick head on a jet black body. Initially after the pour it's hard to find the head - body transition, an interesting finding. The head stays forever it seems gradually releasing aroma of sweet and dark chocolate, roasted malt, oak/rum, brown sugar and vanilla.Flavor follows with a very complex and dynamic character. Opening with cola, milk chocolate and cream moving to dark chocolate and roasted malts finishing with vanilla and coffe, a great beer. Full, thick body coating the palate and light carbonation. This one lives up to the hype and expectation. A must try."

"This is truly an outstanding beer - hands down the most impressive imperial stout that has not been barrel aged or aged with extra ingredients. It has less espresso and more dark fruits than anticipated - kind of like a baltic porter/imperial stout blend. When comparing it to hunahpu it is very difficult because they are two completely different beasts - there are great aspects of this beer that did not shine through Huna. If I could, I would have both of these beers in the cellar at all times."

"Thanks to a generous BA for this awesome extra! Pours as one of the darkest beers I've seen in a long time. Motor oil black with a DARK mocha-colored head. Scent is packed heavy with chocolate, coffee, and more chocolate. Chocolate cake with a hint of dark fruits, and rich, roasted coffee. Lots of roasted malt. Taste is just as it smells, and man is this beer rich! I thought Speedway Stout was a rich imperial stout that was available regularly, but apparently Florida has some other stuff going on. : ) Mouthfeel is FULL BODIED and rich with a bit of chalkiness. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is top notch! Rich and complex. Not much more you could ask for in an RIS. FANTASTIC beer!"

"O - Incredibly rich dark chocolate flavor, some woody/smokeyness."
""
"Pours a dark brown, opaque color with a dark brown head. Aroma of roasted malt, whiskey like alcohol and wood. I'm the taste, dark roast coffee, dark fruits, dark chocolate and alcohol. Palate coating dark chocolates with some intense citrus hops in a die hard fashion. Coffee, smoke, charcoal and earthy at that. Faint vanilla like hint. Warming booze. Full bodied feel, smooth, with an even carbonation. Overall this is a great big stout."

"Awesome Beer. Pours dark black with a nice tan head. This thing is like a milkshake. Very thick. It is everything a RIS should be. It doesnt get much better than this. If you havent had this beer, get it immediately. Smells of coffee with a tiny hint of cherries as it warms up. I would recommend drinking this at room temperature. The characteristics come out a lot more."
""
"D - This was a fantastic stout. Sweeter then most but not cloying. I have only had barrel aged versions, which have all been amazing...I can see why because the base beer is damn good. Solid stuff!"
""
""
"I've had this beer a few times, but never bothered to review it. I know, I'm a bad person. There's no doubt about it. This is a really good beer. I didn't know Marshal Zhukov personally, but I'm sure he would be proud to have this beer attached to his name. It's good in the bottles and really good on tap."

"I had this imperial stout and I feel in love with Stouts. I honestly had never had a stout besides Samuel smith oatmeal stout and Guinness but honestly I don't count those. It's all about IMPERIAL STOUTS. So I was told to try this by a very knowledgeable dude in the craft beer game so I tried it and fell in love dude. Great aged or out of the tap or in the bottle. If you are lucky enough to get your hands on this, please do yourself a favor. I've had this couple times on tap and in bottle and it's as good as the first time, every time.

"An outstanding Imperial Stout. Cigar City knows what they're doing.. well, we all knew that already. Zhukov is a strong, complex beer that will keep you warm and interested. I recommend trying this one at least once when you get the chance. Having tried a bunch of RIS's out there, I can confidently say that I prefer Marshal Zhukov to any of the acknowledged RIS heavyweights such as Darkness, Plead the Fifth, Dark Lord, Ten Fidy, Stone IRS etc. Now if Cigar City released a barrel-aged Marshall Zhukov in bottles.. the world would probably collapse on itself."

"The taste has dry chocolate, dried fruit, marshmallow, vanilla espresso, and milk chocolate. The taste and feel scream out creaminess with dry Graham cracker tones. There is so much going on yet this is a solid cohesive stout. Strong, thick and tasty it's a huge player."
"Pours a thick, viscous dark midnight black capped by by a dark brown one and half finger head. I'm always amazed by how Zhukov pours; this is one huge, thick RIS. Strong roasty malt, bakers chocolate, boozy alcohol, and dark fruit. One sip brings an explosion of flavor, charred dark chocolate malt, huge plum, prune, and black cherry notes, molasses which finishes with continued bold roasted malt, dark roast coffee/espresso, and warming alcohol. Ridiculously complex. The mouthfeel of this brew leaves nothing to be desired, huge and viscious, oily, velvety, creamy and silky. The most full-bodied brew that I've ever had and possibly the best mouthfeel of any brew I've had. As far as I'm concerned Marshal Zhukov is the one of the standards for Russian Imperial Stouts. Quite possibly the best brew I've ever had in the style."

"O: A big stout for sure. Really over powering in terms of thickness and sweetness, great if it is the only beer you plan on drinking."

"O - this is a great beer yet a pretty big one that will probably be unbelievable given 2-3 years in the cellar. I love complex tasting beers and each flavor plays beautifully off the other. The booziness is present but is balanced out pretty well so its not overwhelming or overpowering the rest of the beer. I'm really glad I had this and thank akuyper for sending it along in our trade. This is a beer that is definitely worth seeking out and trying and/or cellaring. Am very interested to see how this beer tastes after aging for a few years. I can see why it's so highly regarded."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Thick and oily is a great way to describe the way that this beer feels going down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- better than I expected from what I have heard about MZ. ,anyone the age mellowed the sweetness some, even though it is still very sweet for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall: This brew hit me the way in way that honestly I would be crazy to leave it alone on the shelf. And to think I already thought I had the best Russian Imperial Stout before this. Great beer, go spend a few bucks...Salud!"
"O: A nice RIS that's so smooth it goes down perilously easy, but it could perhaps stand a touch of carbonation or hop spice to accent the different, darker flavours that are (not) bubbling under the pitch-like surface."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up from a great trade with Mike! Thick, pitch black pour with an amazing creamy dark caramel colored two finger head with decent retention and crazy lacing. The nose is hugely roasty and subtly sweet with hints of espresso, molasses, dark chocolate, toffee, and booze. The taste is complex and is dominated by the roasted malt along with hints of strong bitter dark chocolate, espresso, wood, burnt coffee, licorice, and some subtle vanilla and dark fruits with just a touch of smoke. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and slightly oily with a bit of sweetness that is abruptly squashed by a lingering bitter finish. For a beer with such a beautiful head, it had a bit of a flat feel and could have used a touch more carbonation, but that's really being picky. I love the way it coats your mouth with flavor. Overall, this is a big rich bold beer that's really drinkable. First ever Cigar City beer, but definitely not the last!"

"think i may pass on this next time"

"O- I expected much more, given the reputation. Very disappointing beer"

"Let me start of by saying one of my top five breweries in the US. I had this beer in a 750ml bottle. This is a big bad beer and the name is fitting. A nice thick dark head. A nice rich dark chocolate smell. The taste is dark chocolate, malts and fruit with a bitterness at the very end. Well balanced and a touch of sweetness. The only problem I have with this beer is the mouthfeel. Too much alcohol burn. I would like at a lower ABV. Needs a year or two of aging."

"Freakin’ fantastic. This is right up my alley. The thicker the better when it comes to Imperial Stouts...I find Ten FIDY to be a little to thin for my tastes...this one delivers. So rich. So complex. Tons of espresso and chocolate as well as boatloads of overripe dark fruits. My only bottle...I will cherish and savor this one and hope to land more in the future."

""
""
""

""
""
""

"O- This was sweet yet delicious. Decadent and rich. Would love to try any of the variations of this beer, especially Hunahpu. Probably the most chocolate profile you'll see in an RIS and I like it. Love CCB."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I am very impressed with this beer but in mad at myself for not being able to wait longer to open as I know this would taste better with at least two years on it but alas I wi have to come back. That being said the chocolate and expresso flavor is some of the best I've ever had in a beer and is well balanced with the sweetness the dark fruit power should fade with age and that will make the better flavors come out more. So looking forward to coming back as enjoyed the hell out of this get it if you can"
""
"This is a damn fine beer. It's got just about everything I'm looking for in an imperial stout. For an 11%-er, the alcohol was hidden well, making this one dangerous. Sweet, roasty, and even bitter, this beer will put you on your ass. It's huge, it's powerful, it's not for sissies. Definitely rivals some of my other favorites, FIS and Ten FIDY. I wish this stuff were easier for me to acquire, I'd have it all the time. But maybe that's a good thing."

"From notes, 8/22/10. Good imperial stout but not really a standout. I still don’t really get all of the CCB hype. Pours black with a brown head. Looks pretty thick. Nice head retention. Solid chocolate/coffee/roast flavor. Taste is on the sweet side with a definite, lingering molasses note. Medium full body. Some hop bitterness helps curtail the sweetness. Good beer but doesn’t do enough to differentiate itself from the pack. As a year round beer (and depending on price), it’s very good, but among all >10% stouts, it’s not so memorable."

"Overall- Very interesting Russian Imperial stout. Lots of charecteristics of a BA stout with a very nice long toasty/roasty finish."
"O: Enjoyable brew. It is pretty sweet and I can see that being an issue for some when working through the 750 ml format. Being honest, I'm a fan of sweet beers but found myself becoming a bit fatigued in the palate by the end of the bottle. Would be happy to acquire another bottle somewhere down the road to see what age does to it."
""
""
""
""

"O - Look and feel nailed it. Smell and taste were also very good. Super complex, kick you in the face stout. Definitely one to share, as this one almost wears you out by the end. Very much looking for this one again."
""
""
"Overall: I love the balance of this. It is such a huge roast bomb but somehow everything is held together without any one aspect overpowering. This with the appearance and mouthfeel of this beer makes this without a doubt an A+ beer!!"

"The smoothest of mouthfeels with a better drinkability rating than it has a right to, this is simply marvelous."

"Overall: Marshal Zhukov is one hell of a beer and is easily one of the best un-barrel-aged imperial stouts I have had! I would highly recommend this for anyone who loves massive imperial stouts. I will certainly be trading for a whole lot more of this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Marshal Zhukov is a great representation of a RIS and one of many great beers from CCB. Definitely one of my favorites and I highly recommend it if you are a fan of the style."
""
""
""
"O - This one is up there with some of the best imperial stouts I have had. The only ones that dare to compare are Bells Expedition, North Coast Old Rasputin, and Stone Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
"This may or may not be the best-tasting RIS I have had. In a head-to-head, I still think I'd prefer Founders (Marshal Z is a little sweet and Founders has just the right amount of bitterness to suit my palate). Marshal Z however, is easily the most complex RIS I have had. I am really glad I have 2 more bottles as it will take at least another 1 or 2 sittings with this beer to even begin to expore all of its tantalizing pleasures. Thanks to Cigar City for brewing it, thanks to the folks in Florida for supporting this brewery, and thanks to Mposha for trading it."
""
"(O)- Not sure how old this particular bottle was, but I did enjoy the slightly different nuances this beer put out. Not overly complex for the style, but it fits the style well."
""
"O: okay, so I went back and upped the score for taste. It definitely got better as it warmed. Really glad I got to try this one. I think it says a lot that this beer fared so well in a week that included '08 bcbs and '07-'12 Abyss."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer has such presence. Its a huge roasty monstrosity of a stout, yet its never cloying or too alcoholic. It also has one of the best appearances and mouth feels I've experienced in a stout. Puts most barrel aged stouts to shame, this is the real deal!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn good."
"O - I asked Ryan for two bottles of this one because I was going to age the one that I didn't drink, but I'm not sure there are any flavors that need substantial toning down. Good beer, I'll certainly get it again if I'm ever in Florida."
""
"Overall: Evolves amazingly through the glass. Really great stuff. Thanks Dan for sharing."
""
""
""
"A top notch stout for sure."
"Thank You Cigar City, signed, Fan For Life - stouts4me."
""
"O- This is a damn impressive beer, one of the tastiest stouts I've had in the last few months. Everything you could want in a stout is here in a big way and it all works very well together. If you were fighting your way room-by-room through the burning ruins of the Reichstag this is the kind of beer you would want to be drinking."
""
""
""
"Overall: Real good but still haven't found one that tops DL."
""
""
""
"This beer is a BEAST, very thick and like a sweet dessert. Just a bit too sweet for me but I cant hate too hard. Brownies in the liquid phase."
""
"This is a massive and blatantly militant beer that could readily be construed as magnificently executed or somewhat overwhelming and unbalanced. However, what I feel is the most important thing to keep in mind: be amongst friends, you probably shouldn't drink this one by yourself."

""

"thick, rich, delicious, dry, sweet. just fantastic."
""
""
"O: One of my favorites. I'm not close enough to get it easily, but not far enough it's not easy to get. A great stout that fills all the voids you want in a good stout. Balanced and tasty, great roasty flavor with enough sweetness to make you enjoy it. Top rated beer for a reason.. Glad I have more on hand!"
"This is my second bottle and it pretty much is the same. I guess this beer is just not for me."
""
"A very fine stout. The alcohol is entirely hidden, which is scary. Maybe slightly sweeter than I'd like, but overall very good. Now if only it had some cinnamon, chili, vanilla, and cocoa mixed in..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Cigar City is a tease of a brewery that only distributes (to PA/DE/MD) the beers that I am not very interested in and none of the beers I want. Thank god for trading because Marshal Zhukov is excellent. This is one of the fullest stouts I have had in both flavor and mouthfeel. Easy drinking with great sweet and roasty balance. I got two, so I am really looking forward to opening the other in a few years. If you have access, grab this one. Up there with FBS and Pt5 among the best non-BA stouts, in my opinion."
"Overall I have been waiting over a year to crack this bottle and it didn't disappoint. There is a reason this is on the top 100 list. Thanks to Centenial for sending this my way. I would love to try a fresh bottle. Trade for, or pick this one up if you can."
"O: This is probably my favorite non-barrel aged and specially treated stout to date."
""
""
""
"Pours like motor oil with a nice mocha head. Smells of chocolate syrup, roasty notes. Taste is extremely sweet and very chocolaty, then mellows into bitter roast and ashiness. Thick and viscous as with all CCB stouts...man this is big. Espresso bitter finish. Mild carbonation keeps this thing thick. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall opinion is that this beer is great! Loads of flavor and mouthfeel. This is a fresh tasting and I will revisit a cellared bottle later"
""
""
"Could be the best RIS I have had. Definitely one of them. I need to find some more of this and see how it does with age."
"Cost: $15 for a 750 ml bottle."
"O - This is one my absolute favorite untreated examples of an RIS and is one of the few I've had that has been balanced so well when so fresh. Outstanding!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fantastic tasting RIS. A little thicker and stickier than I like but still good. The high IBU stated doesn't come through, so I can only assume the bottle is from last year. Drinks a little cleaner when consumed on the cold side."
""
"O - Aggressive flavor profile; this bottle is definitely meant for sharing. It feels more over the top than in balance, which is cool if it's your thing but it's a little much for me."
""
""
"O: 3.5"
"Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout pours a solid black. There's almost four fingers of foam so dark that I could barely tell it apart from the beer when the lights were low. Head retention is fantastic, I actually started getting impatient waiting for it to finish fading. Lacing is left in thick webbing. The nose is wonderfully intense, with rich dark chocolate and potent espresso leading the way. There's also a noticeable molasses aroma, but it's definitely playing third wheel to the other two. The flavor still features plenty of chocolate and espresso, but the molasses is a bit more prominent here. Frankly, I think I like it better in more of a supporting role. There is a nice earthy hop flourish just in time for the finish. The body is nice and chewy, but I don't know if it's too full, or if the carbonation is just too low, but the mouthfeel definitely comes off as a bit syrupy at times. While excellent all the way across the board, Marshal Zhukov is one of the better straight up imperial stouts (no barrels and/or flavorings) that I've had in a while."
" I bought the bottle and then stored in the refrigerator for several months, so that could have played a factor. This stuff is dark. One of the best imperial stouts I have ever tasted."
"Overall: This is an amazing stout and something I will actively seek out over and over, I can't imagine what Huna tastes like if this is there lower rated big stout. A real treat and I'm glad I have another bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Another homerun from Cigar City. One of the finest imperial stouts that I've had the pleasure of trying. I'm sure the year of aging didn't hurt anything and I'm looking forward to what the other one I have will taste like in another 6-12 months. If you can try this, you should. Fantastic. "
"Pours a thick black color with a huge dark chocolate mousse of a head that has exceptional retention and lacing. Smells of chocolate, caramel, licorice, dark fruits, vinous, brown sugar, spicy earthy hops. Well it smells wonderful, so far so good. The flavor is big and thick. Lots of Caramel chocolate and brown sugar up front. Then some licorice and fruits move in, some sweet some tart. A bit of earth and ash come in next before a long lingering bitter dark chocolate with just a touch of oxidation. Thick thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy silky sweet mouthfeel. Damn that a big thick beer! I'll bet that's sitting somewhere around 1.050 right now. Aside from being a bit on the sweet side this is one flavorful brew."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is big on the tobacco and burnt caramel. Some heavy fruit creeps in along with a distinctive roast character. Its big and thick, but I am surprised that I dont find this more enjoyable. I think the burnt sugar and molasses are a bit much for me. CCB is such an odd brewery for my palate...some of their beers that others dislike, I have loved and some of the consensus favorites I dont find appealing. Always an exciting ride though, so I wont be passing on any Cigar City offerings anytime soon."
"Very glad for the opportunity to try this one."
"Overall: A really good stout, overall, but definitely a sipper and something that you only want once in a while. I probably should have saved this for a cooler night as opposed to an evening in July... in Atlanta... but I'm glad I'm drinking it in the cool confines of the air conditioning anyway."
""
""
"O - Overall this beer is incredible. I've already gone into it, the beer is the perfect imperial stout. I need to try every variant, and every Hunahpu. This beer re-affirmed my adoration of Hunahpu's. WOW."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a deep, inky black color with a large brown head. The aroma has a ton of milk chocolate in it as well as some roasted malt and a little bit of cream. The flavor is similar, with a hint of light smoke and some very dark fruit up front (mainly prunes, plums and raisins), I also get a lot of chocolate and some very heavily roasted malt. Thick, creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation. An excellent imperial stout, proving once again that when it comes to big, bold stouts, Cigar City is one of the best."
""
""
"Wow, this one is all about the viscous appearance and thick(!!!) mouthfeel. Sets it apart. Thanks egrace84."
""
"[95/100]"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm trying my best to not let the disgusting glob of hair that I pulled out of my mouth (never saw it in the abyss) to affect the scores here, but that's a serious QC issue right there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe the deepest pour of any stout I have come across,jet black with a deep cocoa powder colored thick creamy head,just awesome.Deep molasses and coffee aromas really stand out when pouring,some roasted nut and chocolate round out an aggressive aroma profile.Thick and creamy feel to the beer makes it glide down to easy.Flavors of black strap molasses and chocolate start out on the palate wich is somewhat sweet but not overly so,French roast coffee and mild earthy tones keep the beer balanced and more quaffable,the alcohol is there but it didn't make it less drnkable.Wow this is a brash bad ass imperial stout,no wonder the high ratings,one of the best beers I have had this year...if not the best."
""
""
"O: A big syrupy RIS. Very heavy on the molasses which almost drowns out all that wonderful roasted malt unfortunately. I would have liked to have given it better scores for taste but the flavor was less stout that I expect, and quite unbalanced I felt. Will have to age one and see how I feel."
""
""
"O-Not as sweet as some RISs I've had but the roasty and coffee flavors are great. Now to track down a Hunaphu."
"O: Good stuff, hope to try this again and again in the future"
"Multiple aspects of this beer are simply unbelievable. This is something to make into beer, not a stand-alone product. You could probably eat this with a spoon."
"O - Just a top shelf Imperial Stout. I'd like to try the other varieties of this fine brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This transcends the levels of normality. We're talking about something that fringes on a solid. It's a beast and a half. So much char that a bottle would be impossible to drink alone. Bring your friends and be astounded."
"O: A great RIS - I am looking forward to aging one and trying it a bit down the road. I really wish I had regular access to this one year round as it would definitely keep me happy through the winters."
""
"O: I found this beer to be very good, just shy of another Cigar City stout, Hunahpu's."
"Overall, I'd drink this over Huna all day long. There is enough going on in this beer, and to me Huna pushes all those flavors over the edge. While you can't call this balanced, for a big stout everything sits well together."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A great stout and one I’d hope to have again."
""
""
""
"O- As previously stated, this is the best non-BA RIS I've had. The flavor is so incredibly complex and powerful that I almost doubt there were no additives (i.e. coffee) to this. I will definitely be seeking this out again."
"O: Overall, a great beer.  Really top notch.  Actually it's very similar to Hunahpu , except the Hunahpu flavor profile is slightly ( and I mean only slightly) better, and I actually like it more than rum barrel aged Hunahpu.  A great offering that I highly recommend trying if you can get it."
""
""
""
""
"This an outstanding beer, but I don't know that I'm going to be able to finish the bomber by myself. This thing is THICK. A lot of novice beer drinkers claim that drinking a Guiness is like having a milkshake...well this thing is actually close to it."
""
""
""
""
"I feel like this one can hang in there with almost any other example of this style. To me it was like going to San Diego and drinking fresh Pliny, Nelson, Kern River, etc. How to say which is best? They are all tremendous examples of American IPAs. Put this one up there with the KBS and the BCBS and the rest in my book. It’s like comparing Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, Dexter Gordon, Ben Webster, etc., etc. It’s not that one is better than the other, but rather, who are you in the mood for today?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was excellent, one of the best stouts, let alone beers I've ever had. I managed to stockpile a few as Cigar City is not sold in my state. Look forward to future bottles with more age on 'em."
"overall it was interesting, enjoyable in moderation. would like to try one with less age to it"
""
"O - A unique imperial stout. It's an in your face, bold imperial stout. But, the lingering sweetness throws me off."
""
""
""
""
"4.5 D: Really tasty beer. About as good as Hunahpu's."
""
"This is only the second beer I've tried from Cigar City, and I've enjoyed both. This is a very complex stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Moves toward a caramel, chocolate sundae topped with crushed pecans and dried Turkish figs, which makes it much better than average."
""
"O: This is a really solid russian imperial stout. I don't know if I could drink a whole bottle of this in one sitting, but it's delicious. I've loved come of CCB's beers and I've hated some of their beers. This one is in the former, rather than the later."
""
""
""
"O: I guess this is the base beer for ""Hunahpu's."" It exceeded my expectations in much the same way that ""Hunapuh's"" did."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Hats off to Cigar City on this brew. I still love my Founders and Goose Island stouts, but this one is a big plus for the best brewery south of the Mason Dixon. Having this makes me want to try a Hunahpu even more."
"Huge, sticky, black as can be, super duper sweet but with enough of a roasty and coffee finish to persuade you that there's some sort of ""balance."" Seriously though, so so sweet. Really mouth coating and gnarly viscous with hints of berries, cherries, licorice, chocolate, and smoke. If you like sweet and super viscous imperial stouts, try and find some of this."
"O - This is probably not only my favorite stout but also my favorite beer. Perhaps it's destiny that it's released the same month as my birthday. I'll be getting an entire case next year."
"O-Excellent! The perfect knockout punch after a long day of meetings and travel. This beer rocks! Tons of flavor, well controlled heat, rich flavors.4.5"
"The mouthfeel is thick and silky smooth with carbonation being moderate for the style. Overall it was a pretty good beer. I really liked the dark chocolate and roasty flavors but the fruity, sweet, tart, raspberry like flavors that I got just seemed out of place in it to me. Good beer but not great."
"O: A good Russian Imperial Stout here. A slightly off sourish sweetness on the mid hurts it a little bit. Not sure where that is coming from, could actually be hops. That being said, the other flavors are outstanding. One of the most chocolately RIS's I've had the pleasure of trying. A very good beer."
"O. Super good beer. Amazingly simple and pleasureful beer, chocolate in the right amounts, a great RIS and well made. I will be looking for a bottle of this in the future."

""
"Overall – One of the better RIS's Ive had. Although the taste is big and bold, it's still very drinkable and well balanced. I'd love to have a few bottles of this tucked away."
"Had a 2011 vintage in a tulip earlier this year. This review will be updated asap once I grab another bottle. Poured a black, thick, viscous beer. Smells sweet, lots of chocolate in this once some caramel as well. Really sweet… almost too sweet for me (and I usually love sweet chocolate bombs), this would be good barrel aged (hence the reason hunahpu is so popular). I need to try this again, but this was very chocolaty and sweet."
""
"Pours a deep deep dark black color with a nice cap of creamy mocha head, settles into a long lasting collar. Scent is filled with fantastic dark malts, bitter baking chocolate, fudge, dark roasted and freshly brewed coffee, dark pitted fruits, faint notes of vanilla and coconut. Taste follows suit, deeply layered flavor with each note standing out at particular points in the drinking experience, but none being too powerful to cover anything else up. Full bodied, thick, and coating, entire glass was left with brown tint after drinking. An excellent beer that I may have enjoyed slightly more than the aged versions - blasphemous? maybe..."
""
""
"Pours viscous and dark black with chocolate edges. Dark mocha head, fades to a collar, with some legs. Roast malt and coffee nose, minimal sweetness or chocolate, mildly hoppy. Flavor is sweeter than nose, with caramel, coffee, chocolate, toffee, and pine. Thicker side of medium body with low carbonation; coats the palate and lingers well through finish with minimal heat. Other than the nose, this is an impressive RIS."
""
""
"O - No complaints with this one. Really glad I got my hands on a bottle, and would definitely try another one."
""
""
""
""
"O: I was a bit let down by this one. The flavor is good but not very complex, and while the body is thick the carbonation is borderline watery. Hopefully this is just bottle variation, as fuller carbonation would be a drastic increase."
""
""
"O- Well, this is the most RIS-y RIS I've ever had, if that makes sense? Drinks much like a meal as there were 4 of us who had trouble finishing this because it was so heavy and filling. Not necessarily the best, it IS good, but damn it's bold. Roils definitely try again, maybe put a couple years on it though..."
""
""
"Remarkable. Darkest head I've seen. Brutally intense, but kinda balanced. Not 'drinkable,' but good. Everyone's favorite paradox."
""
""
""
"Overall; I don't know if it was just too much at the time, or if my palate has changed, but as Harrymel stated, it was somewhat of a chore to drink and I only had a third of the bottle. It's not that I didn't enjoy it, it was just too much and surprised me as I've drank nearly an entire bottle of Huna to myself and loved every sip..."
"I can't decide if this is a good beer, or simply a beer worth trying. It is certainly a beer with complexity and intrigue, but is it worth seeking? I dunno, I can't see myself wanting another bottle of this. There were two of us (thanks to pixieskid for sharing this one) and I had most of the bottle, and the last sips seemed like a chore. IMO, that should never be the case. I can say, however, that the beer tasted good, and looked lovely. The mouthfeel is sooo polarizing for me that I wonder if I would appreciate it again."
"O - The beer is very nice looking and has some nice aromas and well crafted flavors. My only complaint is the licorice. It doesn't seem as balanced as other RIS in that department. Other than that it has some nice roast and sweetness. Good beer."
""
"Thanks Dad Prost!"
"O: A very sweet stout, that tonight is hitting the spot. I'm not a huge fan of coffee and sugar, but with the chocolate and bit of hoppy bitterness make this really nice. Excellent dessert beer. The mouthfeel is almost exactly right, really thick, and sticky. Really a nice beer, lives up to it's reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: I'm really glad I finally got to try this one.. If I were still living in Florida, I would pick up a couple bottles every August when it's released."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A really good RIS. Perhaps a bit too sweet to enjoy in large amounts, but still, very good and enjoyable. Would def have again, if offered. I would like to try a bottle with some age on it to see if the sweetness dies down at all. Very good."
"Drink- This was a good treat. I am glad I decided to open this one up for everyone and it got rave reviews from the group. A solid, large, not overly complex but still very multi-faceted beer. I would love to have this one again."
""
""
"Overall a really nice Russian Imperial Stout, this Marshal Zhukov’s… I highly recommend sharing with comrades; it’s big, bold, heavy, and sweet. Definitely borders on overly rich and filling at times... I would really enjoy trying this barrel aged though!"
""
""
"O: This beer is one that needs to be sipped, but the taste is interesting enough to make you want to slowly savor."
""
"Thanks heatwave33! Guava Grove Saison up next!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A heavyweight of a beer. I really like it, but I can only recommend it to experienced beer drinkers because it is so intense. I had a sample fresh, but that was so small and so long ago that I am not sure what my aging had done."
"One of my fav beers. Ages well."
""
"Overall: I don't know if these kind of ""all the way"" stouts are my favorite, but they're great to sip on now and then. Hides its ABV beautifully, but delivers heavy flavor. Hard to not admire how fully this beer delivers for the true ""Big bold stout"" lover. I wouldn't put myself in that category, but I appreciate greatness when I experience it."
""
"This is a fantastic beer, smooth, round, creamy mouthfeel. Tastes like a mocha latte. Cream, burnt sugar, espresso and chocolate in the front and middle, and black fruits and earth through the finish. Delectable beer huge malts, perfect balance and amazing mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a rich black color with a thin head. Its` nose has brown sugar, coffee, molasses and roast. The taste is chocolate, black licorice, more coffee and all around sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvet like, quite nice. All in all, a very good RIS from the folks down south at Cigar City."
"Pours black with a mid-sized, creamy, tan head. Great retention. The aroma is a swirl of chocolate, and espresso with hints of vanilla and molasses. Full-bodied and very creamy with some carbonation. Sweet chocolate and bitter coffee flavor. Well-balanced. Lengthy, burnt, bitter finish. World class imperial stout!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, inky black with obviously low carbonation, thick and syrupy with a very thin mocha ring and swirl of haze. Big, delicious aromas of dark malt, molasses, chocolate, raisins, and some booze. Just smells big and nasty! Taste follows the nose closely, lots of dark malt, chocolate, raisins, and just a touch of soy sauce. Incredibly dark and ""roasty", typical of a big RIS. Mouthfeel is big and viscous with low carbonation. The lack of carbonation doesn't really bother me so much with this particular beer, but a touch more wouldn't be a bad thing. Overall a really nice RIS, but nothing I haven't seen before."
"O: Cigar City has nailed this one right on the nose, my favorite Russian Stout so far in my limited array into the RIS arena."
"Overall: Definitely one of the finer imperial stouts that I've had. Someone at our tasting commented that Zhukov's is the base beer for Hunahpu's. I can definitely see a resemblance, minus the pepper of course. I'll be trying to get this again the next chance I have!"
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, don't be turned off by the weird tasting notes I described. That's what makes craft beer, craft beer. Give it a shot!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the best I've had from Cigar City, and definitely a top tier Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"The look and feel of this beer is incredible. It actually coats the glass and turns it a different color that stays until it’s rinsed off. A fairly unique flavor is good in a small dose means it’s definitely a great beer for an 8 – 10oz pour. Any more than that and the herbal quality really takes over. This is typical of the malty CCB beers that I’ve tasted. I’d say it’s great to share or have a small taste of it but any more than that and it begins to be disappointing. Really a pretty enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm impressed with this beer. It's a thick one and a slow sipper that carries its booze well."
""
""
"Overall one of my favorite RIS to date. Great all the way through and can't wait to see how this does with some age!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Comes across as an imperial sweet stout. If you like sweet stouts, you'll likely like this, but I found it overpoweringly molasses dominated. It is rare I have a RIS where I don't get any roasted notes..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall better than I was expecting. Makes me want to go out and trade for a Hunaphus. And a Nielsborhium while I'm at it."

""
""

""
""
"So impressed with this beer. It's like a bedtime snack or breakfast drink b4 a tailgate for those of us who would rather sip on something nice instead of housing light beers. Do it the right way."
"This bottle was the 2010 vintage. This one pours a blackest of black, motor oil sludge in consistency with absolutely no head or activity. It smells of rich and smooth milk and dark chocolates, featuring both sweet and bitter malt characters with a good amount of coffee. The sweetness is almost Baltic-esque. The flavors are heavy on chocolates, all types of chocolates. Initially I got a good amount of milk chocolate, followed by coffee. It is quickly followed by a dark chocolate bitterness and plenty of roasted malts. It's just really sweet, which takes away from the overall balance. It drinks exceptionally smooth, as one should expect. Overall it's a nice RIS but it is on the sweet side. I can see where Nielsborium got it's sugar from and I can see the base of Hunahpu as well. It's a solid beer, worthy of barrel aging and new additions, but alone it's nothing too special."
""
""
"Fantastic, a really solid beer. The look of this beer was great and the taste was even better than the aroma. The only thing that brings this down is drinkability, this is a big, quite sweet beer and was a struggle to finish."
""
"Very thick, viscous, almost oily feel on the tongue, decent carbonation. A really nice imperial stout, although it made me yearn for Hunahpu's."

"Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout by Cigar City Brewing is an outstanding example of an Imperial Russian Stout. It is tremendously rich and creamy in taste - rather sweet on the tongue. The flavor is immense, but not over powering to the senses. It reminds me of Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream and people in Central Ohio will understand what I am talking about. One of the best Imperial Russian Stouts that I have had the pleasure of tasting recently."

"O- A great RIS, not too sweet and highly complex. Hope to find it on the shelves again soon."
"O- Pure drinking pleasure for RIS fan. This would be a go to RIS if it was more widely available."
"This is a pretty crazy beer and a fittingly epic one for a milestone review. It is a great brew to savor and let warm as I slowly sip it on this cold Northern Michigan night. I cannot proclaim this to be my favorite Imperial stout ever, but it is a fine example and I give CC full props for making something that stands out amongst the crowd."
"not my favorite. just a little sweet for me. i wouldnt want to drink anything more than a 2 oz pour of this. -_- not sure what to do with this whole bottle now."
"This beer was something I had been looking forward to tryin for a while. Finally opened a bottle with some friends last night and was blown away by how beautiful the beer was. The blackness of this beer is great. The head is very dark brown and creamy thick. The bubbles struggle to come to the top of the beer. The smell is of molasses and coffee, there is a ton of dark malts that give off a burnt aroma also. The taste of the beer is very nice, I love the bitter sweetness that the beer has. It's sweet, roasted and dry. The mouthfeel is thick and very oily. Overall this beer was a real gem. I liked this quite a bit. I'd love to have this one again sometime."
"Overall impression is that this is solid. The flavor profile is a little one-dimensional, but outside of that, I have few complaints."
"Poured from bottle into tulip. Completely black, with thin chocolate head that finishes with just a ring. Nose has lots of toffee, espresso, alcohol, and dark malt. Taste has a good amount of dark chocolate, coffee, salty toffee, dark fruits, and slight earthy hops. Mouthfeel is good, coats the inside well with the chocolate, heavy body with calm carbonation. Overall, very grateful to have tried this, nice with the cold weather."
"O= I've had Hunahpu and it was mind blowing. I tell people that it is the best RIS I've ever had. This is just as amazing. A step down in complexity but still the best base beer a RIS could be and a hell of a beer. Super drinkable for such a big thick thing and amazingly smooth."
"This is a no nonsense RIS here. Lots of big flavors. A little sweet for my liking but a pretty well done beer in the end."
"Well, I prefer more coffee and bitterness in my stouts. But fans of big, chewy, viscous fruity stouts will be very happy with this one."
"O - pretty wel balanced for 11.5 abv and such a heavy body"
"D - Very tasty. Would drink even after it is a good idea."
"O: This is right up there with Bourbon County as the heaviest stout I've ever drank. Very good brew and loved the chocolate."
"D – Not an easy one to work through on your own. This was the first beer we ticked off the lengthy list of ~ 30 bottles and I felt that 3-4 ounces would have been ideal. Overall, I think it is judged a bit harsher than it deserves and serves at a great base beer for other CC endeavors (e.g. Hunahpu’s)."
"Great beer. Easily one of the best looking and feeling beers Ive had. Cigar City stouts are top top notch."
"O_A very impressive beer. The alcohol is present but in no way hot. This hits the various notes of the sytle without falling into any of the common traps. Very well done."
"I truly enjoy the complexity of this brew and feel it is among the best russian imperial stouts that I've had. The alcohol is well hidden and I will enjoy finishing the rest of this 750ml. Thank you TCHopCraver for bringing this one back from Tampa!"
"I really loved this. As far as non-bal aged stouts go, this is right near the top for me. This is decadent, and yet it still comes across as restrained. Though in general I prefer more sweetness in Russian Imperial Stouts, Marshal Zhukov’s absolutely crushes it."
"This overall is just a great, if not the best, imperial stout for my money on the market, glad i got about another dozen bottles here around the house!"
"This beer looks fantastic. Pitch black with a brownish mocha colored head. The oily consistancy clings to the glass in a glossy fasion. The nose is full of milk chocolate and roasted malt. The booze is a bit present but no way near as much as the other characteristics. The taste is chocolaty, roasty, some dark fruit, and more chocolate. Deep full flavors here. Fucking fantastic. The mouthfeel is also blowing me away. Viscous oil like liquid sticks to my palate and pastes the flavors. Overall, this is a beast stout that is full bodied and massively flavored. Bravo CCB. Looking forward to this awaiting Hunahpu's"
"O: A. I really liked this one a lot. It's up there for my on the non-BA RIS that I have had. Can't wait to try the Hunahpu's and some of the BA variations of this one."
"wonderful beer, could use some aging though."
"Super rich, complex, enjoyable imperial stout. Defninite warming sipper to share on a cold night."
"Pours jet black with a beautiful tan/medium brown head. Awesome lacing. Smell is inviting with immediate bittersweet chocolat, coffee, and a little booze. Taste definitely delivers on these but with a dark fruit sweetness, maybe plum? Very impressive imp stout from Cigar City."
"Poured pretty black and left a small head that quickly dissipated. The aroma was coffee, chocolate, plums, cherries, black currant, and a hint of rubbing alcohol. The taste was just like the smell. Sweet dark fruits, coffee, and chocolate dominated. Pretty smooth going down but there is a hint of alcohol. Overall, a great RIS. The alcohol taste is noticeable and probably the only thing wrong with this beer, but at 11.5% what do you expect?"
"O- One of the greatest Imperial Stouts I've ever had, could drink this every day. Cigar City, I fucking love you"
"O: great beer, only wish it was less expensive and more available. It was $12 or $15 at the brewery, and I have not seen it elsewhere."
"This has some really good elements, but the molassess sweetness didn't resonate too well with me. A very good beer, I can appreciate that, but not one of my favorites in the style."
"I find this beer to be a toss up of some good things and bad things without ever swinging terribly far in either direction. For whatever reason, the 11% abv doesn't strike me as such; it's not hot and, to be honest, it isn't even warming. Even still, this beer is a bit much, even for me. I finished a good 3/4ths of the bottle but wanted to cut my caloric losses at that point."
"O- This beer was enjoyable, I have yet to come across a CCB beer that was a disappointment, I would love to revisit this beer some time down the road."
"Overall Im glad I have a few more bottles of this laying around. It is a great beer. I enjoyed every sip from first to last. This one is world class."
"O: This beer doesn't really come together for me. It's big and bold, but in a muddled and indistinct way, and there's some peculiar notes that I find off-putting (green pepper?). Definitely not one of my top choices of the style."
"and you know what's really cool? Jeffo also brought over a Barrel Aged Marshal Zhukov."
"Overall: Damn good this is! One of the best Imperial Stouts I have ever enjyoed, no doubt. From the looks to the last drop, this is truly outstanding. Worth the price of admission and then some! The alcohol is the only aspect of this beer that gets on the way of sheer enjoyment. Boozy, it requires sipping. I took over 90' to finish this..."
"Overall I enjoyed it and recommend it."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I love it from the bottle, but the draft was just phenomenal. If you ever see it on draft, make sure you try it."
"O: This beer is simply phenomenal. I wonder what age will do to it, but I have to figure the coffee would step back the the chocolate would take an even larger part of the beer, if not thin out a bit. Very, very good fresh."
"O: This beer has me interested. I'd definitely love to try variations of it, as I think that this beer could be moved around to be mind blowing, but as it is something is missing."
"Rich, very full-bodied. Extremely light effervescence. Thick almost to the point of being cloying but not quite getting there, thankfully. Smooth, this brew slides down your throat like liquid velvet. Unexpectedly, there was no warming from this 11% abv beer."
"O- This is a solid stout. I did get a little overzealous and try it before allowing it to warm and would not recommend drinking this too cold; it is much better at fifty degrees, or so. I would love to get some more of this sometime in the near future!"
"wow. Thanks to Retail1LO for sending this my way. I definitely like this one better than the Parabola I traded for it (though thats no slouch either!) gotta get my hands on more of this. As well as more Cigar City beers. Judging only by this example, they may have worked out the carbonation/quality assurance kinks they had previously."
"This is a delicious beer with strong notes of roasted coffee bean and bitter African cocoa. Very sticky and sweet while having potent bitterness and ethanol to counterbalance. When the beer is allowed to warm, it's even better with stronger sweetness and a warmer mouthfeel. This beer is worth trying, but hard to come by! I would love CCB distribution in NY!"
"O - I really like this beer. It is unique in that I think it hits the middle ground of two categories of RIS: thick/sweet and thick/hoppy. It stands out among most peers. Balance isn't perfect, but it is good. Of course, I'm comparing it to other ""fresh"" bottles of RIS to be fair. $12? Really? I'd buy as case, annually, if I lived in Tampa. I think the fact that this is available on the shelves holds it back on many people's scales, but I think it would fare very well in a blind taste test."
"Overall: A bit sweet but very good. I thought everything blended together quite well. I would definitely have this one again."
"Pours a thick pitch black with a huge 3 inch intensely dark khaki head that settles into a dome of foam. A nice latticework of lace slowly clings to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of rich dark chocolate, cocoa powder, subdued espresso/coffee, cinnamon, and some roasted malt. Taste is of dark roasted malt, bittersweet baker's chocolate, roasted espresso/coffee beans, and some molasses flavors. There is a roasty and hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer is extremely thick and creamy in the mouth. The ABV is hidden pretty well in the smell and taste. Overall, this is a good RIS that is very rich and makes for a slow sipper. I am glad I finally got to try one of these."
"For me, this was not what I expected, and in all the worst ways. There are so many six and four packs of this style that are more affordable than a single bottle of this and taste much better, in my opinion."
"Perhaps I was jaded by the outstanding complexity in the Hunahpu's but this just didn't live up to my expectations. It was a nice sipper with the right elements, but it was a bit too sweet and unbalanced. Perhaps some time in the bottle will do this beer justice but as it stands now, I'm not the biggest fan."
"One of the better RIS I have had in some time. Recommended with gusto."
"O: This beer is strange because it achieves a huge, sweet maltiness with toffee and roasted notes throughout and yet it has a rather prominent fruity hop profile that would normally just balance everything out. Yet it is extremely sweet and bitter at the same time. The appearance and mouthfeel are extremely impressive. This is one beautiful looking beer! Very deep, rich, sweet and complex yet I'm not overly excited about the fruity hop profile."
"A delicious chocolate stout I can't wait to have again, though it's too sweet to become one of my favorites."
"O: Best qualities are the taste and the mouthfeel; this beer is an example of how to set the bar high...really high for Imperial Stouts. It was a pleasure enjoying this beer from start to finish, it's the perfect ""dessert"" beer if you ask me. God bless CCB."
"just noticed this is my first ALL 5 BEER!!!"
"O – Excellent stout. Its got a great complex taste. Leaves you wanting more. Was an easy drinker considering the ABV. Glad I bought a few of these."
"O - An excellent RIS. Aside from the slight carbonation issue, not much to complain about here."
"Great beer, epic heartiness! Yet another impressive brew from Cigar City."
"O-i'm glad i shared this one. its one powerful stout! it starts out so great and mysterious but the more you drink it, the more the complexity seems to dull. its definitely a classic, and i look forward to my next bottle!"
"Overall: Very good dessert beer"
"O - Very good. Up there witht the best imperial stouts."
"O: One of the top 3 non-BA stouts I have had. CCB deserves the acclaim it gets for the stouts they produce."
"Pours thick and completely black with a very dark brown head. The smell seems muted the only thing really coming through is a sort of burnt malt scent. The taste on the otherhand is very pleasant like a sort of mocha iced coffee with a slight warming alcohol sensation. Mouthfeel is what a good imperial stout should be thick and coating with just enough carbonation. Overall a very good sipper, glad I got a few to age."
"An excellent beer. Now at first I was wanting to move to Florida because of the beaches but I remembered Cigar City and now there are two big reasons."
"Worth every bit of attention that this beer receives, the taste and mouthfeel is where this beer shines. A little thick, almost treacly feel that really allows you to pick up on all the tastes that this beer has to offer. Will be searching it out in the future!"
"2011 vintage. Poured from 750 ml bottle into an efes snifter. Tudor brown head, decent retention. Oily, clear lacing slides down the glass. Aroma consists of roasted malt, coffee, slight alcohol, even a touch of bacony smoke. Taste includes coffee, faint chocolate, slight underlying sweet malt and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is very, very thick and viscous. Certainly more amazing upon warming. Spectacular."
"O-So happy to have had this beer, the taste was out of this world. But i just could not finish it. It was to heavy, even for me, and i love big stouts. I probably would have given it a higher rating if it wasn't so heavy. But i cannot wait for next years batch. Another unique fabulous beer by CCB."
"O- I think this is one of my top 10 fav stouts, for sure. Perfect balance of roast, chocolate, and a surprising herb presence that blends beautifully in this brew. Must get MORE!"
"Overall this is a good tasting beer but the heavy chewiness in the body and roasted bitter, charred malt flavors are just too dominant for my tastes. I would prefer some more balanced milk chocolate flavors but I guess that is more the American Stout category as opposed to the RIS category here. Better than I remember, but my small sample at the bar was enough as I would struggle to finish the 750ml that this is typically bottled in. Maybe I am just over the Russian Imperial Stout category or my tastes have just shifted away from enjoying these huge chewy beast beers."
"The mouthfeel? This is the biggest, thickest stout ever. Ten Fidy doesn't have shit on this. It'll coat your mouth for minutes after you take a sip. The light, but still noticeable carbonation helps this go down very easily. The drinkability is very good for the high ABV and the thickness, only the smallest hint of alcohol is available. This is the batch of Zhukov's to make anyone a believer. This is one of the best big stouts I've ever had. Be on the lookout for the 2011 bottles. If you see them, get as many as you can. It'll be absolutely worth it."
"O - Not a bad beer, on the sweet side. I prefer an earlier bottle I had that was much more roasty qualities, but the last few bottles I've had tasted more like this one."
"O - Quite a tasty beer. Not quite a sipper like so many other RISs (this is a good thing!)"
"Overall: I was really looking forward to tring this beer when i returned from Florida a few week ago. Picked up a bottle of this at Kickback Gastropub in Jacksonville. This beer was a really well made beer, but the bitterness was almost over the top to me. Maybe a little bit of sweetness to help this beer along. Doing a side by side with Hanahpu that is the beer that is up next."
"This is pretty decent. Solid brewing, but it just isn't intense all across the board as I had hoped. It does make a good base beer for Cigar City style experiments though."
"O: I really didn't know how this would hold up after having Hunahpu's but it really didn't seem any less special or inadequate at all. I can without a doubt tell this is the base beer with the chili's and cinnamon being the main difference. This stout sets the bar so high and I can't wait for it to come out again. Killer beer!"
"Thanks again Steve."
"O-- 11.5% ABV??? Really? Felt and tasted like 8%. Very nicely hidden. Rich and thick but very drinkable and enjoyable. Long back story with this beer but has held up very well and aged very well. Probably better without the hop presence. Much bigger and enjoyable without it to me. 750 ML might be a bit much though."
"This is a very full bodied, thick brew that is only exaggerated in it's smooth viscous feel due to it's low level of carbonation. It is very complex and enjoyable. A kiss of alcohol warms you up in this brew and seemingly evaporates from the tongue. This is a very well made brew. The carbonation could be turned up a few notches but all in all this is a solid brew. It's no wonder I enjoy the one-offs of this beer so much, this is an awesome foundation to start with and start tweaking flavors."
"D - Little carbonation, but thick and mouth coating."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Despite the head that formed on the pour, this beer has a surprisingly low amount of carbonation. It is heavy bodied and very viscous, but comes close to being flat. I don't think I care for it too much. Overall, I enjoyed the beer but wouldn't go out of my way for it again. A bit more time in the cellar would have done this one some good."
"644"
"Notes: This bad boy is super thick, sweet and cloying. Would like a little more carbonation though. Mouthfeel suffers because of the lack of bubbles. I like it, but it's a BIG f---ing beer! FFO Dark Lord, BCBS, D.O.R.I.S., etc."
"O- A good representation of the style. I wish my bottle had a little more carbonation. It was almost to much to finish my glass. This is definitely one to share."
"Overall this is a decent beer. The zero carb really throws the taste/mouthfeel characteristic off and while it is good it falls into a region of one and done for me. FIx the no head carbonation mouthfeel problem and this would be an ""A" brew."
"This was from a trade a while back and I have since turned down purchasing additional bottles that were available. Overall I think I made the right choice. This is good, not great and I am especially partial to having an overly roasted ashy finish and flavor in my stouts."
"Overall, this was a solid and interesting example of the style. I actually enjoyed the whole 750ml bottle myself over the course of an almost 5 hour period so I had the beer at various temps and as it warmed it brought out new flavors and/or highlighted some of the existing ones. I definitely wish I had another bottle as I'd like to lay one of these down and revisit it down the road."
"One of the best."
"Overall -- This was a delicious beer. The roast/sweet interplay reminded me of a rich desert paired with coffee. Decadent, lots of depth, but man, that mouthfeel is difficult to get over, though looking over a lot of the other reviews. However, after browsing through some of the reviews perhaps I'm the only one? By the last 3-4 oz of my pour it became a labor to get through it was so syrupy. Regardless, good stuff. Consider sharing this with 3-4 friends."
"Rather slick and improves a bit in flavor with warming. Still the carbonation issue, surely not unique to my bottle, beats this beer down significantly."
"O: A bit of a disappointment for me, overly sweet and this sweetness is too prominent in the flavor profile for me. I had been looking forward to trying this beer for a long time. This is from the batch that I had heard there were carbonation issues with some of the bottles, and it seems like this could be a bottle affected by it(although never having had this beer before I cannot be sure). I don't know if I drank this a few months earlier if the sweetness wouldn't have been as intense, of if the carbonation may have been slightly higher, but I wish I would have tried it earlier. Not a terrible beer, but I wish I had about 6 ounces of it and not the 2/3rds of a bottle that I do. Would like to try again sometime to see if the over sweetness that I am getting out of this beer and lack of carbonation are a fluke, or if that is just how this beer is. That being said, it really doesn't taste like 11% and I am soldiering on and putting it down a little quicker than most other beers of this strength, maybe just because I want to move on to something else."
"Overall one of the most flavorful stouts I have ever had. Sweet flavors make for a delicious beer that delivers in lots of ways. The only gripe I have is the appearance. Definitely will be searching for more of this beer"
"M/D: Rich and carbonated. This is a pretty thick beer, it was very drinkable, but it seemed like something was missing in the taste."
"O - Glad I got a few of these when I did. Hope they become available again as I'll buy up a bunch more. Great stout that makes for a great time."
"Small head which comes alive a little bit with a very rough pour. Roasted malt, caramel, coffee and chocolate in the nose. Alcohol hits a bit more with the taste as well as the characteristics of the nose. Pretty smooth, a tad thin to be picky, and a little heat. Drinks very well and is another solid stout from Cigar City."
"Just one minor trouble spot in the design of this otherwise exceptional beer."
"Pours muddy black with dark tan/brown head. Thick lacing is left behind and forms a moving crust to the glass. Smell is cocoa, chocolate, sweet malt, berries, and what I can only describe as licorice-like. Taste is chocolate, bitter coffee, roast malt, truffle. Carbonation is medium, mouthfeel is creamy without being thick, if that is possible- almost a too thin of a body here, sort of light and airy. No alcohol presence, and drinks smooth. There is some flavor that keeps popping up here, that I can't quite put my finger on, and it is driving me nuts. Very good beer overall, and I would seek this one out to try again some day."
"Big and tasty."
"Drinkability: By far, the most drinkable Russian Imperial Stout I've ever had. It is a very sweet brew, which is not particularly my favourite. It looks and feels excellent, though."
"D: Very much a sippin' beer, an excellent night cap, but very hard to imagine having a 2nd pour. Highly recommended for anyone who likes over the top RISs."
"A bit of a chore for me to finish the whole bottle, took me about two hours actually."
"Overall, a really nice, balanced impressive stout. I loved the blend of flavors and the balance. The one negative was the lack of carbonation and it did not hurt it as much as I thought it would. I will definitely seek this out again. This batch was definitely near its peak in terms of age in my opinion."
"D: The lack of carbonation greatly distracted from this beer and I simply could not enjoy it. I would hesitate to even call it a sipper as it offered little to invite you back for another sip."
"Pours a Jet black with hints of red around the edges of beer. No head whatsoever remind me of coffee with no bubbles. Smeels of slight tobacco and roasted malts nothing else really going on. I did like the slitty smoky taste and roosted malts with a bit of a coffee finish. I did like the fact Zuhkov was very thick, rich and creamy. Definitely a sipper for me. I preferred this RIS then his offspring Hunaphu's."
"This beer poured pretty darn flat, which I must say is not impressive off of the bat from a beer that I've been so excited to try. The aromatics I got were coffee, smoke and bourbon. The flavors were vastly improved on the aromatic, to which I blame the lack of head. It was a sweet tasting beer with chocolate, grape, smoke and caramel all combined into a very tasty melange. The mouthfeel probably was helped by the lack of head, because this beer went down very smooth and very creamy. The drinkability of this beer was good, I would hope that not all the bottles were with as little carbonation as was this one."
"D - not bad. Tastes good, isn't too overpowering."
"D. Very good. Doesn't stand out against a lot of the beers we've had, but a very solid beer."
"D-crazy drinkable. Wow."
"Pours pitch black. No head what so ever. One bubble actually. Vry thick. Smells malty and sweet. Tastes fairly nondescript. Just a ton of malty sweetness. Some light fruitiness on the tongue. Lots of earthiness own the tongue a bit of roast. Very basic but solid. Thick mouthfeel but not very well carbonated."
"D: Tasty as hell, this is something that could be enjoyed with some nice aged cheese, or maybe a cigar. This is a sipping beer that will for sure sneak up on you. Wonderful."
"Overall, Zhukov is a beer like no other that I have tried. It is far from my favorite, but it is definitely worth a try. I can see this being some BAs absolute favorite beer ever. It is very well-crafted, but it won't score a ton of points with everyone. Nice work from Cigar City."
"The body, though low in carbonation, is still pleasant. So smooth and creamy. This is really thick stuff! I'd like a bit more bubble play, but this is alright. If this beer were any less ""big," I'd have more of a complaint. The flavor profile mirrors the nose quite. Lots of dark chocolate, wine, mild booziness, licorice, and heavily roasted coffee beans. I lowered the drink-ability on this one, as the alcohol burn just gets to me after awhile, and this is more pronounced as this beer warms. Still, this was one heck of a weekend-starter. Great beer to sip by the fire, or as CP enjoyed it, with a pipe."
"~Peculiar"
"From this point forward, when someone asks what is my favorite RIS, this will be part of the conversation."
"The uber-low carbonation didn't help, but damn this was one huge, sweet, tolling beer. The flavors are decent but found this to be too sweet. I enjoyed Hunahpu's alot more, but now I really gotta try it again knowing this is the base beer..."
"Cheers..."
"The body needs some bubbles... It is very full and thick. The beer is insanely drinkable for the ABV. If the carbonation issues get worked put, this will be a top rung contender."
"Cigar City is on the right track with Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout, an RIS that means serious business. If they can get the carbonation kinks worked out, this big black ale has a chance to be... wait for it... legendary beer. Thanks to ktrillionaire for the opportunity."
"Nice beer but it tastes a little too smoky to me. I realize it is just a personal preference but I like my imperial stouts leaning more towards vanilla/chocolate/coffee. Definitely worth a try though."
"O: An absolutely brilliant brew. This is the first full sized serving I've had of a Cigar City beer, and it did not dissapoint. I do wonder why it was bottled in a 750ml, as it is a much bigger serving then any one human should have in a night."
"Drinkability: If this had the proper level of carbonation, it would be up there with the heavy hitters of the stout world. As is, it was ok, and all of us sort of lamented what could have been."
"(750ml bottle courtesy of markwise and shared at Mike's sours/saisons tasting). Pours black with chocolate head. No carbonation and oil-like. Aroma of chocolate and soy. Taste is sweet with some roasty bitterness. Medium bodied with slick texture. Finish is smooth and roasty. This is a really good RIS. Thanks Mark!"
"D: Very drinkable for a stout of this magnitude. Another excellent stout from Cigar City!"
"d - I thought this one was a great RIS. Tried it right before a Hunahpu and it's pretty similiar and equally enjoyable. I thought the alcohol was a little more prominent in MZ and Hunahpu had that spice for the peppers and more vanilla, but can't go wrong with either. Would love to have again."
"SkÅL!"
"I hope to try this again with proper carbonation. Seems like an impressive big daddy stout when enjoyed as intended. I will standby for another taste."
"For an off the shelf beer, Zhukov's is absolutely incredible. The flavors and mouthfeel are amazingly well-integrated, and it feels like drinking velvet. It exceeded our expectations."
"All in all, this seems like my first middle of the road brew from CC. Everything I've had from them has either been great or a letdown. This one is just decent. Most I've had were great from them. This one is good if you like roasty, huge, heavy, and thick stouts. I do like these types of stouts, but this one does not seem to pull it off as well as some others. Need to crack another Hunahpu soon. That's a stout thick like this, but well, VERY WELL, done."
"I really love CCB and RIS's, but this one was a bit of a disappointment. I just expected more. It certainly isn't a bad beer at all, so maybe my expectations were set too high by Hunahpu. (OK, I know Hunahpu is a American Double and not an RIS, but I LOVED that beer, so my stout expectations for CCB were high)"
"Had on tap at Good Time's pub with a steak sandwhich. Brew arrived in a tulip-ish glass (same as the DFH signature without a logo). Brew was gorgeous with the normal deep dark ominous black and a tall finger and a half deep tan (almost brown) head. Brew smelled of chocolate and roasted malts. Tasted even better than I remembered and left a nice little buzz. Aside from the nose, nice hints of vanilla and cream. Smooth and creamy, but rather rich and thick."
"D: Drinks way better than the abv would lead you to believe. Very nice!"
"The simple fact is that this thing is a beast. This doesn't want your money. It just wants to kick your ass for the simple pleasure of it."
"super thick without being sweet. really a nice beer."
"As drinkable as a RIS can be. I'd like a little more hop bitterness to balance the malt sweetness, but this is an awesome take on the style."
"Overall: Great beer. Glad to be drinking this on a cold winter's night. Lots of complex things going on here - seek it out. I've never tried their barrel versions of this brew so I might have to now."
"Overall,I was very unimpressed. Thick,malty,non carbonated liquid mess. Certainly glad I tried it,but I really can't recommend it. There are so many better options out there worth your dollar."
"Impressive beer. Any beer which can overcome a complete lack of carbonation and still score very high is worthy of the praise it receives. The alcohol is hidden rather well. Certainly a sipper but every sip is enjoyable. Pairs very well with homemade roasted cinnamon and cayenne dark chocolate truffles."
"Taste, a sipper for sure, thick, chewy, not a lot of any component jumping out other than chewiness. No coffee, a decent amount of chocolate. Don't taste any vanilla or wood. Just tons and tons of roasted malt, maybe some oatmeal to round all this out into a tasty concoction. If I could pick this up for $10 all the time, you can bet it would be always on hand."
"Reviewed on 1/16/2010. Bottle. Pours a viscous black with a small dark tan-reddish head. Aroma of alcohol, dark chocolate, roasted malt. Flavor of tons of roasted malt and some bitter chocolate in the finish. Rich and decadent. The 11% makes itself well-known but overall, this was quite a tasty beer!"
"Drinkability is pretty good, I enjoyed it though a bit more carbonation would have made an improvement to me."
"D - I like this a lot. To be critical, I'd say maybe it is a bit too sweet for my liking, but not by much. Definitely not a Dark Lord caliber syrupy sweetness by any stretch. Not sure tasting this next to the Hunahpu's did this any favors. The spice additions to the Hunahpu's from the MZ base beer really brought out the flavors nicely and dried it out too giving it much better balance."
"D: This is one hell of a solid beer! I've already lined up a trade for another one and plan on enjoying that as well. Do yourself a favor and try it if you can because there aren't many like it. Good on you for this creation Cigar City. 4/5"
"Poured from a 750 into a wine glass. Thick black motor oil. Very glad this was split among 8 of us or so. This stained the glass for sure. Smells like straight up booze with some dark chocolate and licorice in there. Tastes incredible especially as it warms up. There are some subtle cocoa notes as well as a hint of coffee towards the end. It is sure a sipper. It feels so thick and chewy in the mouth it is a meal in itself. This is a delicious beer but it is really hard to get down unless you take real small sips but nonetheless very memorable."
"Opened the bottle and a slight hiss. Knew there was not going to be that much carbonation from the reviews so it was expected. Poured into a pint glass, and could not see any light threw it at all. Overall felt like I was pouring oil out of a can. The smell is definitely wonderful, very chocolaty. Now the best part about this brew is the taste, at first it tastes like a chocolate milkshake with the bitterness settling in after you gulp it down. There is also a strong coffee aftertaste which is really nice. because of the low carbonation it is very difficult to drink the whole liter as it is so thick, that is this beers only downside. SIP this beer, as the ABV will sneak up on you as I was feeling really good after the whole bottle!"
"O - This definitely ranks with Speedway as one of my favorite heavy stouts. I love the fact that it's made in the town that I just moved to, and it's available pretty much all the time. At $10, the price is pretty good, too. Certain other breweries in the northeast and midwest would charge $15-20 for this."
"This is an enjoyable sipper from Cigar City. This one 750ml will keep me busy for most of tonight. Would be a great brew to split among friends."
"simple and well balanced between sweetness and bitterness split the 750 and glad i did very rich"
"And if November colds don't get in the way."
"While not the most complex RIS out there, this doesn't have to be, thanks to the robustness, power, and most importantly balance of all of those huge flavors that are involved here. It's no wonder that this makes a perfect base for all of the different varieties that they put out of this beer. Just a well crafted Russian Imperial Stout with the alcohol content being right where I like it."
"This has to be among the best beers I have ever tried. I cannot wait to get my hands on some more."
"D: Hmmm...not sure when I'll try it again, but great beer."
"Nice work CCB."
"Pours black as night with a good mocha head. Head recedes quickly without leaving behind much lace. The nose is incredible with a wondrous balance of coffee, chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. A good dose of booze to blend things up. The taste is equally decadent with all the flavors in harmony. Good, smooth feel with a bit of heat. Drinks incredibly well and this will be a big cellaring candidate for me."
"This is one serious Stout!"
"D: Good sipping beer but the flavors dominate everything even after you finish. So this is a one and down brew."
"I'm very impressed with this beer."
"D: Damn good, something implacable in the mouth and nose here, but really really good."
"Drain poured this one... Maybe a bad bottle but as is, a big disappointment..."
"Poured this into my snifter. It pours a jet black opaqueness with a thin reddish tan head that simmers quickly to leave a nice ring. Smell is of roast malt, molasses, and caramel. Taste is of creamy, strong coffee with a slight sweetness. Mouthfeel feels like a coat of velvet throughout the mouth. Low carbonation. Drinkability is quite high for me due to the excellent flavor. I have been quite impressed with Cigar City. Try one!"
"D: Fantastic, will make a great winter warmer"
"Holy crap. Not my favorite style but this is the greatest stout I've ever had. Awesome."
"D - Excellent for such a huge beer. I could keep topping off this glass all night. World class for sure."
"D - Definitely a sipper; half of a 750 was perfect."
"A faint hiss as I popped the cap. The rich, chocolatey smell immediate wafted and filled the room. Poured thick, viscous, and somewhat oil-like. No head to speak of, no bubbles, just a black heavy mass in the glass. No light passes through, save a tiny bit at the edge of the glass. Would be more impressive with a dense tan head, but the viscosity makes up for it I suppose... Anyway, the aroma is impressive. A nice blend of roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate (if you follow Lindt's chocolate, this is closer to the 80% cocoa bar), a faint tint of black currants, and a touch of black patent malt. This is an assertive stout, yet presents itself elegantly. The first sip reveals such complexity, yet reminds to to sit back, not worry about it and simply enjoy the beer. Sweet and fruity in the forefront, with the roastiness and cocoa character following closely. The finish is extended with much coffee and touches of vanilla, followed by a lightly astringent and almost charcoal-like texture. Alcohol warmth and dryness follows. Although no head is apparent, the beer is certainly carbonated, albeit very mild. I enjoy that texture with an intensely rich beer as such. A very nice sipper. I can see this working very well with many different desserts or with a chocolatey cigar. Even as a stand-alone dessert beer. Good job, Cigar City. This is a different beer than the last time I tried it and I'm glad I'm reviewing it this time."
"D: This brew will disappear before you know it. 11.50% ABV is hidden like a ninja. High drinkability."
"Mouthfeel was VERY smooth and creamy. Very thick and generously coating. It's got to be the thickest beer I've ever encountered so far and I loved it. Much respect to the Marshal."
"Completely opaque, motor oil-like pour with a miniscule brown head. Aroma notes of espresso, kahlua, toffee, and dark chocolate dominate the nose. The flavors are of unsweetened mocha, bitter espresso, toffee, and burnt molasses. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel, with a bitter finish that only shows the warmth from the high abv towards the end. Although it drank extremely well for the style, it may still be a bit much for novice beer drinkers. This is a beer meant to be savored, and that it should be. Once again, another fine offering from a brewery that doesn't get enough attention due to the overall lack of a craft beer scene in the South."
"Drinkability is suitably high, thanks to the absolutely delicious taste and superb mouthfeel. The ABV is hidden very well, making this a very dangerous brew. Definitely one of my new favorite Russian Imperial Stouts. I just wish it was more readily available around here. Thanks to infi for sharing this great brew with me."
"OVERALL: A big, bold, and demanding beer. The Marshal can certainly battle it out with the other big stouts, and perhaps claim victory in the end. Though a touch more carbonation would help bring it over the hump, this big stout is really drinkable and I really enjoyed every sip of it. I'm glad I have a few more for down the road. The Marshal and I will battle it out again. Thanks a lot for hooking me up with my first ever Want 50belair."
"I had a glass of this at George Keeley's on Manhattan's upper west side. This is one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts I had. Very dark color with a very dark head. Aroma is amazingly malty with the smell of dark roasts, alcohol and yumminess. The 11.5 aby really packs a punch so be careful. I'll have this again."
"D--Well, nearly 12 percent, pretty heavy duty. Definite sipper, but a beer that gets my highest recommendation for the style!"
"Drinkability: Good, satisfying, and soothing. This beer is going to pay for itself by lowering my blood pressure several points."
"Alcohol is present but not overwhelming, there is a lingering coffee aftertaste that is holding it back but not bad on the drinkability scale."
"This is a serious beer, black, really no head and very little carb. Looks like motor oil. Smells like rich dark roasted malt, vanilla, coffee, crazy dried cherries, raisins and faint notes of alcohol. Tastes the same. Chocolate, coffee, lots of vanilla, oaty, leathery fruits. Really thick and heavy, slightly cloying to me. A little hot from the alcohol and a little sharp. Is it drinkable, yeah...would I want another tomorrow, no."
"D - well, you aren't going to sit down and drink a bottle by yourself...or if you do, you won't remember the second half. It's a great sipper. Needs to be cold out, because this will warm you up."
"D- Great RIS, goes down nice and easy and local, glad they're distributing bombers to me area now"
"So far this was my favorite offering from Cigar City and I intend to cellar a bottle as per the brewers instructions. I suspect the taste will be even better in a few months."
"Thanks to rtratzlaff for the hookup from the employee stash at Cigar City. 12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a deep motor oil like opaque black with a thin dark tan head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is loads of roasted malts and dark chocolate with some molasses and espresso. The taste is a very sharp kick of heavily roasted malts with bitter bakers cocoa and some espresso and molasses, citrus hops come through a bit as the beer warms. The beer is a bit on the heavy side with its 11.5% abv certainly showing, but this is a very enjoyable sipper. This is a very enjoyable Imperial Stout, one I would certainly love to have again."
"Cigar City may be the first great Florida brewery (although I am also a big fan of St. Somewhere). I've had several of their beers now, and other than the Jai Alai, they all have a similar taste profile. Somewhat smokey, espresso like flavors. This one is very well balanced, even a bit on the sweet side. Dark as motor oil, very little head. ABV does not overwhelm, and the beer gets better by the sip. Already one of my favorite imperials. I have yet to have a Cigar City beer I didn't like, and I hope to make it to the brewery at some point."
"A totally opaque black brew with a decent brown head and lots of lacing. The aroma is full of deep nut coffee and buttery toast, somewhat mild but heavenly. The flavor brings thick molasses grassy hop that finishes with an ashy smoke. Unreal. Thick with minor carbonation and tart apricot highlights. Charcoal works it's way to the top with fruity overtones of watermelon and apricot with lots of buttery edges. Reasonably drinkable for such a sturdy brew but naturally a bit too much alcohol for proper sessioning. The feel is smooth and invites slow but steady enjoyment. This was one of the better Imperial stouts I've had the pleasure of drinking. Cigar City has thoroughly impressed me thus far."
"(...Then again, I was at the brewery, where everything tastes better!)"
"D- this is rich and smooth in all caps, underlined, bold, italics, and quotated. The flavor is out of this world and has the bonus of staying with you a long time. I've read this is the base for Hunahpu's. Now I know why Hunahpu's is considered the 11th best beer on the planet. I'm damn proud this stuff is make in my neck of the woods!"
"Nothing worth securing, an above average beer, but a clearly below average RIS."
"This roasty beast is a sipper that leaves my snifter an oily coated ruinous mess."
"Not as sweet as I thought it would be, but very good none-the-less! Huge chocolate notes, semi-thick malts, only a slight sharpness from hops rests in the background. Mouthfeel is creamy, milky, semi-thick body. A wonderful heat/burn in the mouth and down the throat from the big ABV. I really, really want to try the BA version of this! Carbonation is pretty low, but perfect for the style. Another solid and tasty beer from Cigar City!"
"Excellent beer and a great first impression from Cigar CIty brewery. Can't wait to try the brown ale I have next."
"Mouthfeel is heavy bodied, dense and oily with a low, smooth carbonation."
"Drinkability is damn good. This is a massively rich RIS, yet it's really smooth and enjoyable as hell. As much as I like to cellar beer, I can't really see a compelling reason to sit on this on for much longer other then to experiment, as it's drinking excellent now. The tail end of ski season here in Oregon, I'm glad I didn't wait 6 months for next season."
"D: well like Hunahpu's, this is a one of a kind stout. Not quite as much unique character as Hunahpu's, but you can see it is clearly a well made big beer. It smells like it could be overwhelmingly sweet, but once it hits the palate, the roasty notes take precedence. Great Brew!"
"Pretty damn drinkable with no hint of alcohol. This will sneak up on you if you're not paying attention."
"When I think of Soviet Russia, darkness comes to mind. A sky so dismal they're begging to see the glorious sun of Highland Scotland, bitter winters, the eternal dread of the oprichniki: they all seem bright compared with the darkness currently sitting in my snifter. Motor oil, chocolate syrup, and pitch could be used as a comparative image, but they all fall short. This is Russian darkness at its finest. Even the finger-thick foamy head is dark, the second-darkest head I've yet seen (I can't really remember the darkest, but I know there was something darker than this one). Just as the Russian people could not escape the gloom of the Soviet bootheel, light cannot escape from this brew. I know I've gone a bit overboard in discussing the look here, but I was amazed by the bleakness oozing thickly from the bottle during the pour. Now, as distinctively Russian as the appearance is, I'm not sure how Russian the smell comes off as being. Heavy doses of chocolate and anise are joined by rabbit punches of black cherries, coffee, and tobacco. I'm sure you can come by these in Russia, but they're not recognized as Russian things. You know what I mean? Upon drinking, the good Marshal himself lets his troops loose: Whole divisions of bitter chocolate, brigades of tobacco and cran-black cherry, and skirmishing squads of leather, figs, burnt toast, molasses, and nutmeg. The victory is quick and one-sided, a Russian version of Austerlitz. The occupation then begins, and these troops make sure they bring every nook and cranny of the tongue under complete control. Despite this lingering and brutal occupation, a dearth of active carbonation, and a healthy, semi-perceived alcoholic content, the drinkability is dangerously high here. I just can't seem to get enough of that grinning soldier on the bottle and the brew that bears his name."
"F: Finish is pretty dry and gets really bitter. There is a nice combination of dry charred earthy scorched malts that adds a bunch of bitterness and a little minerality, as well as chewy earthy hops. A nice hop finish really. A touch of lingering sticky sweetness, and lots of lingering roast and coffee. Lots of lingering malts as well. Some bitterness and minerality on the back of the tongue as well. It really coats the mouth and sticks around. A touch of warming booze, but being 11.5% it hides it really well. I like this one, but it's hard to drink an entire 750ml by myself. I would like some smaller sizes or have to share with a friend next time."
"D - Marshal Zhukov is definitely one intensely bold RIS with complex flavors and aromas. While this wasn't one of my favorite Cigar City releases, I still appreciate the deviation from the typical chocolate and coffee-infused stouts out there."
"D-huge RIS, great flavors and complexity, everything really works well. Lots of chocolate and very rich brew. Enough roasted maltiness to hold up with a good balance of sweetness. Alcohol is extremely well hidden."
"D:: Awesome beer. Really nice. The bottle was on the pricey side but at least it was good."
"I got this as a gift from my cousin. I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter. It pours a viscous, jet black with a moderate tan head. It has a roasty chocolate aroma, with coffee and molasses hints. It has a nice roasty coffee/chocolate flavor up front. It is slightly sweet with vanilla notes in the finsih. The finish lingers on for a while. This is a well carbonated, full bodied brew that hides its ABV well. A very good RIS that is worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: An incredibly well-balanced example of the style; kudos to Cigar City"
"D- I was at the brewery at 1050 AM waiting for them to open the doors. I had 3 snifters full for breakfast. I could have kept going well into dinner!!!! I may have needed help walking, but I seriously could have polished off another 3 snifters!"
"Tried again at the South Sound gathering compliments of BA Piclee. I believe original review above was due to infection. This beer was phenom. One the biggest hearty RIS I have had. Big espresso, lots of charred notes, cocoa, and I even detected some smoked meats at times."
"Overall impression: Nice beer. Seems to be a good candidate for aging (although I do wonder what that strange flavor was)."
"D – This brew is absolutely nuts, the raw rugged real deal."
"Very smooth and drinkable!"
"D: Tough to take larger sips of this beer. Some of the flavor can be overwhelming if taken in high doses. Just a bit too burnt and bitter for a RIS in my eyes."
"Drinkability is quite nice. This one impressed me, as most Cigar City brews have. These guys just know their shit."
"Rich and extracted. A shock to the taste buds. Bold favors of chocolate covered espresso beans and burned fruit. Big alcohol warmth. Woodsy with a roasty charred dryness that hits the mouth hard. Black coffee and dried herbs on the finish. A big beer that demands attention."
"this is the least balanced of the three. the bitterness is a couple notches too high, as i prefer my stouts sweet and decadent. however, if youre into those more hop-forward stouts, you may find this one quite to your liking."
"Be careful not to pour too aggressively or you'll get half a glass of head, all dark brown and mostly foam but also with a few islands of larger popping bubbles, thick and gobby streaks of lacing. Pure black in color liquid, that's all you can say, not a star in the sky. Cappuccino, milk chocolate, licorice blow through your nostrils like wet paper, the smokiness is more like incense than wood smoke, light touch of plum and cherry fruit, there's an underlying leafiness, like plant oils on your fingers, otherwise hops a vocal backseat driver. Full-bodied enough that you have to gulp to get it going down your throat, as expected from the pour, the carbonation has a large billowing effect, making it foam up and close to out of your mouth. Less milky here, the roast more pronounced in the coffee bean, dark chocolate flavors, close to bitter. Flutter of caramel, butterscotch. The cherry fruit deepens here, more red than black. Again the hops don't distinguish themselves through individual flavors, more both a tactile bite and oiliness which cements the whole onto your palate. Monochromatic, as all exemplary steamrollers are. You can't wash it out of your mouth with a hose."
"Pours a used motor oil black color with the most darkest brown head that I have seen to date. The head is dense and clingy which resulted in some nice sticky lacing. The aroma is of nice bakers chocolate, almost to a tee. Nice milk chocolate and mocha to boot. A nice big and roasty malt flavor. Good choclate and coffee flavor. Bitter chocolate dominates, followed by a strong roasted coffee. Nice and earthy. The brew is big and chewy, yet exceptionaly smooth. Abv is well hidden. I'm not a big fan of imperial stouts but this is a gem. Great great great roasted malt flavor. Nice caramel sweetness, good coffee presence. Seek this sucker out. It is good!"
"D: I actually got a bit bored through only 8 ounces of this. I know it's great, but frankly, the smoke overtook it for me. Chocolate and coffee are good, but I would have preferred a stronger third pop there."
"Overall one of my new favorites. I cannot even imagine what Hunaphus will bring if this one is as good as this, I am just beyond impressed."
"Pitch black; so dark the falling pour is opaque. A rich thick dark brown head fades fairly slowly leaving a nice amount of Belgian lacing behind. The aroma is rich and pungent highly roasted chocolate malt with a hint of dark fruit oily molasses alcohol. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied silky smooth and oily thick with an excellent coating viscosity that really complements the intense roasted malt and baker's chocolate flavors. A bitter element of the charcoal chocolate lingers nicely. A really excellent sipper."
"Overall, this is only my second beer from CCB, but I have not been impressed whatsoever. It was dressed for the part and had a pretty decent aroma, but just really fell apart in the other three areas. Hopefully they can prove me wrong down the road."
"d: Not subtle at all, but it was damn delicious. I've really enjoyed the CC I've been lucky enough to try so far."
"Bottle courtesy bret27. Pours an absurd black color with one of the darkest brown heads imaginable. Dark chocolate aroma, woody and hugely roasty. Flavor is roasted insanity, darkest chocolate and coffee grounds. Almost charred/ashy, a little dark fruitiness. Earthy woody hops, massively bitter. Astringent on the tongue. This one really assaults the palate. It's good, very good, but so robust it's hard to get through."
"A good imperial stout that reminds me of 3F Dark Lord because of the big sweetness. Very good stuff."
"D: I have another bottle in the cellar that I'm pretty excited about. Highly recommended. This is one of the best in the style."
"Overall, this is a solid RIS with lots of nice flavors that mix together. This is a sipper for me and I am glad I am sharing this with a few other BAs. I definitely recommend this one for the season."
"Overall this was an exceptional experience and certainly an Imperial Stout that can easily hold its own. Great flavors, exceptional appearance and mouthfeel, and an overall polished RIS. Thanks again Kevin! Highly Recommended."
"Overall: Good but not amazing. The reason I have to give this stout serious props is because it is basically the base recipe for all their stouts, some of which are mind-blowing. Marshal Z is the backbone of this operation. He does the heavy lifting for cigar city I believe."
"The palate opens big and bitter with a burnt grain bitterness, roast, bitter chocolate and a little cream. Some licorice character is noticeable too. Roasty and bitter on the finish, this is solid. Big and full in body with low carbonation, this beer is really good, but a little bit goes a long way."
"Overall I was a bit disappointed with this one right out of the bottle, but once it has a chance to warm it gains complexity and comes into its own. Worth a shot."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a very dark brown color head with great retention and some good lacing. Aroma is very complex with a mix of black chocolate, coffee and some nice roasted malt with loads of other complex flavors that are very hard to describe. Taste is also a very complex and enjoyable mix between some black chocolate with light lactic sugar and some coffee notes, Body is very full with great carbonation and I thought I smell a little bit of phenolic alcohol. I am glad to have tried this one and makes we want to try some more beers form this brewer."
"This beer pours a thick black body with a thin dark brown head. Roasty Malt wafts from your glass and a slight hint of alcohol reminds you how much artillery the Marshal is packing. The flavor begins with a nice roasted malt, into a bitter dark chocolate, then a hint of toffee on the finish. The body is very chewy and creamy with a slight nip at the end from the alcohol. The thin head that began disappears with each sip. Overall an excellent offering from Cigar City and now one of my favorite imperial stouts."
"drinkability: amazing, best stout and one of the best beers I have eve had. I compared this side by side with a BORIS and it blew it away. Not even close."
"4/4/4/4/4"
"D: Not a bad beer. I guess my expectations were a bit high for this one, but the flavors were a bit underwhelming, unfortunately. Still a good RIS, but not the best."
"Chewy viscous mouthfeel with a very prominent roasty character and tons of sweet silky chocolate maltiness. Lots of deep roasted cofee/espresso bean flavor up front and dry earthy hops with some pine character. This is countered by a silky dark and milky chocolate presence mid palate and a lot of rosted malt, molasses and burnt toast flavor. More roasty espresso and coffe bean presence in the finish. I thought that this beer would be a bit sweeter but it is very dry, bitter and roasty and the hop profile is much more dominant than I would have liked. This beer is a bit rough when fresh but I feel the flavor will improve greatly with age. ABV is very well masked. It's hard to believe it's 11%."
"Overall,"
"I was not impressed with this beer after all the hype about these beers being so good I guess I expected more. Bitter flavors and over roasted grains and not really giving a good example of the style compared to other RIS's . I was trying to find some of the flavors described on the bottle and had a hard time pulling them out. I would love to try the Hunapaus when it comes out but at this point its going to half to be pretty damn good to win me back over. This one was average at best."
"Time to drink finally. The beer was served a little too cold so I held the bowl of the glass in my hand for several minutes enjoying the aroma. Mouthfeel is good, big bodied despite the high ABV, lots of flavors that completely coat the mouth. The alcohol is not as obvious in the beer as it was in the aroma, the flavor is dominated by a strong sweetness (that the alcohol may be contributing to) in the front of a good full malt character and then an avalanche of roasted espresso and coffee in the back of the mouth. Beer continues to surprise by not having an aftertaste. The coffee flavor is present and lingers but there is not secondary flavors. This is a world class beer and one of the, if not the best, Russian Imperial Stout I have ever had. I'm sure the oak and cedar aged versions are even more complex and amazing."
"Poured a pitch black cola body with a tan head and a roasted chocolate smell as well as coffee, some toasted/burnt malt as well. A thick, slightly smooth body with loads of coffee malt taste along with hints of toffee and bitter chocolate. Dryness eminates from the coffee malts as well as ABV peeking through, in a good way, and is a great beer to sip on."
"Creamy body is delicately carbonated. Lasting finish. Well balanced stout."
"Kuhnhenn Winter Soltice BA/RB tasting party. Thick RIS, thick chocolate. Pours dark brown with some head. Great tasting, with some complexity beyond the bittersweet chocolate . A little chocolate in the aroma. Contained roast. Drying.Best consumed as a dessert."
"Completely jet black with a gorgeous deep tan head on top. Poster child of a RIS. Roasted and somewhat burnt coffee aroma. Deep, deep roasted flavor. Has a distinct burnt graininess to it. Ever so slight tinge of alcohol come thru the roasted flavor. Very nice espresso notes going on. Long lingering licorice flavor. The roasted/licorice flavor goes on and on. Extremely full mouthfeel. Liquid pudding in a glass. Finish tends to be somewhat dry/astringent but thats really only comes from the huge grainy like quality. Simply an awesome beer. Well balanced and enjoyable. A meal in a glass for sure."
"Very well balanced not overly sweet from the malts, not overly bitter, just right in my book, and not the least bit watery, again it has a very creamy thick mouthfeel. What a great beer."
"2011 version. Pours pitch black with dense creamy looking three fingers worth of dark brown head. Settles slowly to a half inch and leaves a sheet of thin lace down the glass, staining the glass brownish yellow. Smell: yeasty pumpernickel with carroway, dark cocoa, espresso, herbal and earthy. Taste: dark brown sugar, bready, some molasses, black currant, herbal and slightly citric (acidic) hopping, espresso and anise finish. Full bodied - thick with an exceptionally creamy feel. Missed this one(‘s carbonation) last year and happy to have it back. Same rating as 2009."
"Thanks again to Bhalter8 for hooking this one up. Out of the bottle and into the glass it pours like used motor oil, thick viscous and black as night. The head is almost two fingers of burnt chocolate looking foam. This is a dark beer. The nose is roasted malts, nuts? and booze. The taste is sweet, malty sugary goodness. Light chocolate and toffee, pretty dry in the finish with a hint of coffee. Full body. Very rich and very thick. Maybe too rich to finish a whole 750ml bottle alone. This one is a beast fresh, but it seems like it could stand the test of time with the best of them."
"Poured jet black into a snifter, forming a nice 2 finger head. As the other reviews have said this beer is jet black, one of the blackest beers I've seen. Honestly looks as delicious as a stout can be. Smells like dark chocolate with some light fruitiness behind, very faint though. The dominant taste is the dark chocolate with the coffee flavor enhancing it, especially in the back end which stays strong for a couple of minutes, very pleasant. My favorite part of the beer is the mouthfeel; the taste is awesome but the beer is so damn creamy, it's like liquid velvet. The 11.5% is totally masked, booze taste at all. I recommend this to any stout lover and hell this is ranked among the best beers I've had."
"The first thing one notices is the deep dark pitch of black it pours. Almost heavy in apperance like molasses, which interestingly it has strong hints of. Has a beautiful rich, creamy head. The body is complex with subtle hints of molasses, chocolate, chicory, coffee and even dried fruits. Goes donw nice and smootgh, no fighting needed. Almsot wish it was not an 11% beer because would really enjoy several glasses of it ona cold winter's night."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is great for a beer of this strength. I could drink quite a lot of this. Overall, this is one of the best examples of an RIS I have had. Another great brew from the guys at Cigar City. Skal."
"Drinkability- This is the first true IRS I've had in quite a while and it was very tasty. It's very intense and pretty over the top. I can't wait to see what happens to the other I have stowed away in a couple years. Nice little alcohol punch too, feelin' good. Thanks much guys!"
"This beer is borderline perfect. I am delighted to unexpectedly have another one in the basement (thanks mully) which I will hold onto for a while. Although I cannot see how aging this would make it any better."
"Poured into a chalice a thick black color, nice carbonation, very nice thick/creamy dark tan one-finger head, with some very nice thick/creamy sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with lots of chocolate/toffee, and a nice touch of coffee, vanilla, slight dark fruits. The taste is very nice, malty, slightly sweet, slightly bitter, with lots of chocolate/toffee, and some coffee, nice touch of vanilla, also some slight dark fruits. Full/medium body, the ABV is hidden pretty well. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from CC. Thanks Diego!"
"Aromas of roasty malts, chocolate, and coffee come thru. The smell of the piney hops hide behind it all. Love the color and aroma on this one. The roasted malt has a nice balanced mix with the chocolate and coffee that come thru. The piney/citrus bitterness comes thru on the back end. Overall pretty darn drinkable. Not to heavy but it is full bodied, nice and rich, smooth, and its fair share of carbonation."
"The taste is, unsurprisingly, massively roasty and charred, with quite a bit of tartness and acidity from the enormous amount of dark malt. Cherries, burnt bread, tar, charcoal. This is intense, but it's surprisingly tasty. While it's not something I'd care to drink often or in quantities larger than 3 ounces, it's a pretty decent little beer. Condolences to Overlord for drinking an entire bottle solo."
"Wish I could have split the bottle with someone. Good, but a bit much."
"This is a huge beer all the way around - gorgeous looking and with a complex taste that I think will improve with time as the flavors start to meld together."
"Bottle from Kingdom Liquors. Poured a black color with an average frothy brown head that mostly diminished with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy roasted coffee, chocolate and alcohol aroma. Medium to heavy toasted chocolate malt flavor with a heavy dark bittersweet and small alcohol bite finish of moderate to long duration. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. This is a standout beer."
"Drinkability: For an 11.5% abv beer, I'm nearly tempted to put this at a 4.5. I'm amazed by the lack of alcohol presence in this brew - even though you feel it once it hits, this one sneaks up on you as good as it does in any brew. Regardless of the reason, this brew is otherwise solid - flavorful, full, and somewhat balanced (though if you don't like char and heavy, heavy roast, steer clear). I also hear it's not even the best of the Cigar City RIS offerings. As it's the first I've had, however (not only my first CC RIS, my first CC! Glad to see they're getting big distribution in FL now), I'll have to go with both a ""recommended"" and a ""I can't wait to visit my grandmother again."""
"Full bodied with an upper level of carbonation and a sticky, chewy, and syrupy mouthfeel."
"Oh yeah, does anyone else notice a lot of Communist themes in Cigar City's beers? If this was the 1950's, Joe McCarthy would definitely not approve."
"Drinkabilty: Full bodied with an 11.50% abv holds this delicious brew back in this category."
"Oily up front, very viscous. Really soft on the lips, velvety. Bitter...chocolate & hoppy. Throw in some cold brewed coffee too. Plum, raisin, fig and strawberry...yowzers. Strong bitter chocolate oil. Astringent tobacco bitterness, somehow a little tart on the finish. Long lasting bitter, dry & tannic. Mouth feels like I just smoked a mild cigar."
"Another great, huge beer from ccb."
"This stout was actually more impressive than it was likable, however I still enjoyed it quite a bit. If there was a bit more complexity in the flavor profile--perhaps the addition of a dark fruit or chocolate character--this could be a world class beer. The base is there, but I don't feel like it is complete. Still, worth acquiring and sharing with a couple buddies."
"Drinkability is actually totally solid. If I really liked the beer's other aspects, I could definitely see myself putting down a fair bit of this stuff. Easy to drink for the style. But really, I doubt that I would spend the money on a bottle of this again - the market is inundated with better imperial stouts."
"This is an exceptional beer. No other way to say it. Tons of flavor, very robust, and the alcohol is exceptionally well hidden given the strength. Incredibly fruity as well. I'm glad I picked this up; it is outstanding. Seek it out."
"Drinkability: I would have this again but on another day. I recommend this to someone who wants a coffee open as malts and piney hops finish the brew."
"Marshal is a black imperial stout oh yes he is. Black with a oil slickness, thick with no light able to peek through. A nice tight off white head with slimy lacing. Smells of deep roasted malt with chocolate and more malt. Tastes consist of the same with dark sweet chocolate and some coffee with some hops to go with it. Dark fruit with some alcohol but not intruding. Roasted malt with some underlining toffee. This is pretty well bodied and nicely carbed, not dead in the water. A nice slick feel with some bitterness in the end. Glad I got a chance to try this brew."
"The beer pours a blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing. This beer looks pretty impressive, appearing almost viscuous like. The nose on this beer is impressive, with considerable coffee, dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla. Both on the nose and palate, this is really a pretty nice beer. On the palate, the beer is moderately sweet, with chocolate, coffee, stewed prunes and dark fruit. There is also a hint of hoppy bitterness in the finish, which enhances drinkability in this beer. The sweetness and light hoppy bitterness is well balanced in this beer. Mouthfeel is soft and fairly plush, with a fairly long finish. Alcohol is noticeable, but is not obtrusive or intrusive. This is really a pretty nice beer."
"Highly recommend!"
"D: Not the best interpretation of an RIS. The flavors are there, but the way its executed is not. Glad I tried it, but wouldn't seek it out again."
"D- Overall, this is yet another fantastic beer from Cigar City. I can't wait to try this again with some more age on it! "
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, syrupy, sticky, sweet, and roasty."
"D: I plan on enjoying this one for a long period of time while splitting the bottle."
"Overall this is a fine RIS and another good beer from Cigar City. It's a seasonal release, so get one while you can."
"Just cracked a fresh 2011 bottle. Any carbonation issue noticed in the 2010 version have definitely been addressed this year. CCB stepped up this brew. Marshal Z pours with a billowing black head, and a creamy mouthfeel that I would give a 4.5. Flavor notes of chocolate are also stepped up. Man this is a tasty brew."
"This will improve with aging as the flavors meld."
"This is a fantastic RIS when it is fresh and will only improve with age."
"D: I really did dig this one, it will only get better with time im sure."
"D: Good. I think this is one that will get even better with age."
"D - Drinkability is practically nonexistent; this is a huge, thick mess of a beer. It is obviously complex, but the alcohol is so rough that it obscures the character of the beer. I would guess that this has the potential to turn into something great, but it seems like it will take at least a year or two of aging for this beer to come together."
"These notes are based on an immature sample batch before it was aged on roasted cedar and bottle conditioned to near perfection. But at this stage it wasn't perfect. I'll append these notes when a sample of the properly conditioned release is available. It pours murky dark brown and is on the lower end of the carbonation scale (if such a thing exists). The aroma has roasty notes and just a hint of chocolate. It really lacks some depth. The taste is much the same with semi sweet medium to highly roasted malts, faint caramel and just a touch of chocolate. There appears to be little depth or complexity in the flavor as was the case in the aroma and shows the need for proper aging and conditioning. It was tasty like this but just barely more than one dimensional."
