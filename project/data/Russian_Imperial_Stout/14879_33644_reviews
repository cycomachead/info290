"Wasn't blended in well enough."
""
"Overall, a very good Imperial Oatmeal Stout and worth getting when you can. The taste is more chocolate than roast with a much creamier feel to it."
"Above average.  All blends well together but I can't pick out anything that puts this above some other RIS's.  Had the barrel aged version on tap which was much more memorable."

"Just took my first sip.  it's a decent imperial.  I poured it into a snifter and it's as dark as abused motor oil.  Great aroma...taste pretty much agrees with aroma.  Lots of roasted malts, some coffee and some chocolate.  Light carbonation. The only turn off for me is the amount of alcohol that I'm sometimes picking up on the front.  It masks all of the things that I love about imperials.  I'm going to let one sit for a while and see if it softens."
"Taste-Burnt dark malt, charred dark fruit, boozy and warming"
""
"Very nice RIS with big flavors all around."
"I'm not getting next to any smell on this...maybe it was served too cold? But it tastes like dark chocolate and a touch of cherries. It doesn't  taste like it's 9.4% abv though, interesting brew"
""
"Solid and very easy to drink. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good pour, nice and dark, with solid head. Nice coffee flavor, strong aftertaste."
""
"Complex, well balanced RIS. Would have liked it to be creamier in feel."
"Light roasted coffee, cocoa & some hazlenut on the nose, and those flavors follow through along with some semi-sweet dark chocolate and very distant burnt fruit.  That said it is a surprisingly smooth brew considering most of the elements at play. The oatmeal gives a thinner mouthfeel but that compliments the flavor profile.  Excellent beer."

"Amazing Oatmeal Stout.  Amazing Balance. Full bodied and deep roasted...Alcohol is well hidden.  Great beer!"
""
""
"Definitely the best oatmeal stout I've ever encountered. It's got a silky mouthfeel and a roasty aroma. I was quite surprised with how this almost tasted barrel-aged. Very well-integrated flavors."

"Different than D.O.R.I.S. but just as powerful.  This is my favorite oatmeal stout that I've ever tasted.  It is slightly bitter but mostly sweet, with an emphasis on a cream flavor, I'm assuming because of the oatmeal.  It''s not super oily but has a decent thickness to it.  The bitterness is the first flavor to hit you, and has a mixture of coffee, cocoa, and malts.  This quickly morphs into a sweet creamy stout though and you can really taste the oatmeal.  Excellent beer, buy it if you come across it."
"Really sweet up front with lots of fruity flavors followed by the oatmeal cloaked in milk chocolate and coffee."

"Pours black as a starless night.  Very good head, especially for 9.4% alcohol.  Retention is slightly below normal, as is lacing.  The nose is rather subdued, chocolate and coffee are noted over a light alcohol base.  As it warms, chocolate comes more forward as does vanilla, dark fruit and roast.  Light full body with a creamy texture.  Slightly above normal carbonation with effervescence in the middle and finish.  The flavor profile is intense, complex, but is not well balanced.  The alcohol is not hidden well enough.  It begins with a rush of coffee that quickly yields to a rich dark chocolate with notes of vanilla.  A bit of effervescence in the middle brings out the mild roast and hop bitterness.  The bitterness is citric in nature and fades into light dark fruit, mostly fig, notes with a bit of char and smoke.  Throughout alcohol is in the background, but as the flavors fade in the finish, it predominates.  Take the alcohol content down a bit, and this becomes outstanding.  As is, it's very good."

"Poured motor oil thick and dark. Very little head, and receded to nothing. Smell was big coffee, chocolate mad dark roasted malt. Flavor was chocolatey up front with the coffee on the back end with some light caramel and toffee notes. Mouthfeel was pretty thick with a bit of alcohol burn, very little carbonation - quite nice. This is a very good beer, might have to try the barrel aged version soon!"

"Overall: It was a surprisingly cool fourth of July. After a night of pyrotechnics, I sit alone in complete silence on my porch as I analyze this beer. I could not have asked for a much better one. It's thick, bold, and velvety; Everything you'd want in a RIS. The only thing I can nit pick about is the presence of alcohol which takes away from the aroma and taste a little bit. But on a cold winter day that could be complimenting. I could see this aging beautifully. Reminds me a lot of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Went perfectly with my Sarris chocolate bar. Not the best RIS I've had, but not too far behind either. A sipper of a beer. I'm looking forward to having this come winter. Holds its own next to the likes of Founders and Expedition. Highly recommended. Cheers!"

"The taste is sweet, roasty, thick and malty, with some hops too. It has a bit of creaminess too. The aftertaste is very sweet, but the burp is wonderful. This is a great stout from right in my backyard."
"O - I've been sitting on this bottle for a couple of months now and I am really glad I cracked it. I am not a stout fan in general but this one was very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is very big and the flavor is quite pleasant."
"O-nice mouthfeel and flavor make for enjoyable sipping"

"What I would really like to try is BA Boris but still hard for me to justify @$18.00 a bomber. After having Boris, though, I may find it easier to open up the wallet going forward."

"Overall: One of the best RIS that I have ever had. Comes off a little thin, but still packed with a lot of flavor and balance. Great choice for my 900th review."

"Bottle is a couple of years old. Bottlecap darkly discolored under the seal, but seal still intact. Pretty intense sweet & sour nose. Tres tasty. Good balance between sweet & roasty, so that every sip and swish brings different tastes. Not a lot of bitterness, which is right up my alley. One of the better RIS's I've had."

"Big let down. Maybe the most watery stout ever. Not much flavor either. I don't get what went wrong here. I sipped it, tasted little. Let it warm to room temp and still got a watery, boozy miss that only got a hair more flavor and body..."

"O - This is a delicious Russian Imperial Stout. Highly recommended."

"Pours extremely dark from the bottle, opaque black in the glass. A luscious, dark brown head settles on top. Smells of heavy, chocolaty malt upfront with some dark fruity esters tagging along. Roasted malt and some nutty coffee joins a soft molasses and burnt sugar sweetness. Bold roasted malt flavor, semi-sweet chocolate, a little vanilla, and oats. The overall richness is kept in check, which is a good thing. Some coffee and fig. Mmmm...tastiness. Super creamy, plush mouthfeel, heavy, and chewy. I look forward to trying a fresher bottle sometime, as this one has been around a couple years, and I'm definitely interested in the variants as well."
"Very dark brown, totally opaque, and clings to the glass. Head is nice and fluffy initially, then turns to a thin, bubbly ring around the glass. Aroma is deeply chocolatey at first, then opens up with some vanilla, caramel drizzle, soft alcohol, prunes, very faint candy orange, oatmeal cookies, and again very chocolatey. Taste is big. A lot of flavor in one sip... Chocolate liquor, oatmeal, molasses, charcoal comes to mind, figs, caramel, more chocolate. So much going on, harmoniously though. This is a sipper. Body is super heavy, thick and blankety. Smooth, broken up only by some piney bitterness. Carbonation is mellow underneath. A big beer with a lot of pleasant qualities, meant for slow absorption."

"Solid chocolatelly big BA stout, great balance and taste. Almost has a chocolate and maple taste. Whisky takes a back seat but stays prevalent. May not be the most complex BA stout, but the maple/chocolate sure shines enough to put a smile on my face and crave for more~"
""
""
""
""
"Overall near the top of my non-BA stout lists. Jet black pour with some mocha head that dissipates quick leaving thin ring around the glass but has nice sticking power with spotty legs after sips that maintains hold all along the side of the glass. Has a nice smell but a distinct dark fruit/vanilla aroma that slightly over powers the roasted dark chocolate. Can't put my finger on it but reminds me of prune. Taste amazingly roast and chocolatey in a non-sweet form that has a creamy feel"
""
""

"Overall this is a complex delicious brew that is worth seeking out."

"Looks like motor oil. Held up to several lights, this beer is absolutely opaque. IKEA black-brown, very slight orange-bronze head when poured, ... really, this looks like motor oil. Under several different conditions and settings, I could not detect any light shining through. But, it tastes like pure, unfiltered and uncompromised heaven. This is an outstanding stout. Balanced, smooth, almost chewy as it slides down your throat. I chilled this one too much. As a result, the nose was closed and the taste was like a shout without the nuances and subtleties you find in normal speech. After 20 minutes of exposure to room temperature (68 degrees), the aromas burst from this extraordinarily well made beer, and the complexities in the taste became apparent. Caramel, subtle molasses, caramel again. Subtle, nothing overwhelming, nothing dominates the flavor or the aroma. A perfectly balanced stout to warm your insides on a delightfully crisp autumn evening in Cincinnati."

"O: I can tell it's been in the bottle for a while because all the flavors seemed to have mellowed out to create a very delicious stout that does not overpower nor does it disappoint. Wait...now that it's warmed up significantly...it's lost a lot of the great flavors it had when it was sort of cold. Too boozy and has aromas and flavors of soy sauce and other acidic qualities. Too bad, really. Still enough stout in this beer to be alright, though."

"Good, but not great by any means...and Raul has no problem saying that. Thang is light like Laura Flynn Boyle and it needs to be barrel aged. Thang feels like that hot cheerleader that is rushed to prom as a Junior: one more year and, baby, you are golden."

"Overall this is a tasty brew. Very high abv and you can tell after the first swig- Drink it slowly and enjoy it."

"A delicious imperial stout at a very reasonable price -- that alone should get you to buy a few of these; one for now, one for later (such as I have done). If you are new to craft beer, this might be a nice ""bridge"" beer to bring you to the darker and heavier side of the stout world. At the same time, seasoned veterans of stout drinking should find this spot on for full-flavor enjoyment. Beautiful by itself but might breathe fresh life into cheesecake or pannacotta."

"Overall, a solid enjoyable RIS, nothing special to the point of being on anyone's top 10 lists, but for $9 and available year round this is a very solid option. Definitely one of the blackest stouts I've seen in a while."

"O: this is one delicious beer, and probably better than the barreled version for all but the taste. Not really easy to drink, but that's to be expected with a RIS. Would happily buy it again if it weren't as much as a 4-pack of Old Rasputin."
""

"I've always enjoyed the Hoppin Frog BORIS & DORIS and consider BORIS one of the best year-round available Russian imperial stouts that I can find in Georgia but it's on the pricey side (typically $10+ for a bomber). This one was a happy extra in a trade a few months ago and it's always a pleasure to drink."
""
"O: What a great beer! Every time I have it, I think “it’s been way too long since last I drank this.” It’s complex, but not obnoxious. It’s huge, yet delicate—it’s just very well balanced. I’m going to torch off a crème brulée right now to pair with the rest of this fantastic brew. (Heck—a “BORIS float” made with good vanilla ice cream would also be perfectly appropriate.)"
"A great one from Hoppin' Frog, want to try all the BA variants of this that I can."

"T: Lays a smooth layer of roasted malt and coffee down on your tongue right away. The mouthfeel is pretty velvety from the oats, so it really makes this beer mouth coating. Some fudge, cola and dark chocolate come in to play before a finish of burnt raisin, heavily roasted malt, and some slightly acidic dark roasted coffee. Maybe just a hint of earthy hops in the finish as well. Glad I finally got to try this one. Maybe I'm getting spoiled by all the monster stouts I've been drinking lately, but this one just didn't feel big enough for me. If they had beefed this up another 2-3%, I think it would have been perfect. As is, it's still one of the better versions of the style I've had and a really great beer."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Almost tudor brown head, moderate retention on a black body, clear, oily lacing. Aroma includes notes of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, slight alcohol and slight caramel, hint of vanilla cream. Taste follows the aromas closely with a nice thick mouthfeel. Warming on tasting but the alcohol is hidden quite well. No off flavors and quite a delicious monster."

"The problem with this beer isn't that its a good beer - it is actually quite good, the problem is that there are many other, cheaper beers that do it a lot better. This one was a pretty steep price to pay for a good, dark, strong ABV oatmeal stout but in comparison to Sam Smith's, Rouge or Wolavers Oatmeal Stouts they all do it a lot better and Wolavers and Sam Smiths do it for a reduced price."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a very traditional RIS not too sweet or too roasty, maybe could use a bit more balance since to me it's very bitter. To me though not worth the price of admission, hell for two dollars cheaper I could have got a Stone RIS... shit."

"this is an outstanding stout, and wonderfully enough can be found off the shelf. a year in the cellar did this one some good, but honestly, it's just as good fresh."

"Taste was one of the best balanced stouts I have had. It had chocolate, sweetness, bitterness(not much) and malt balance. Really easy to drink and the mouth feel was just right. This is a heavy bodied beer with medium carbonation. One of the best stouts I have tried."

"O: This is one helluva beer. Great RIS but with a strong oatmeal character, making it oh so smooth and creamy. A little age may have mellowed it out even more. Flavors are well integrated and smooth. Beer goes down amazingly easy for a 9.4% RIS. I really enjoyed this one. Only reason I can't give it top marks is because of the relatively simple flavors (not as complex as some big RISes can be) and plain, mellow aroma."

""
"The beer has a substantial and thick mouth. Just a great beer that I will purchase again."
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours very dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Slight spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a nice amount of alcohol legs. Aromas of big dark chocolate, oatmeal, roasted malt, toast, coffee, toffee, molasses, vanilla, light char, dark bread, and light earthy hop spiciness. Fantastic aromas with huge complexity and balance of roasted malty notes. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, oatmeal, caramel, toast, coffee, toffee, molasses, vanilla, dark bread, light char, and light earthy hop spiciness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toffee, molasses, vanilla, dark bread, light char, earth, and light earthy spiciness on the finish for a while. Fantastic flavor complexity and balance of roasted flavors; with a nice malt/roasted bitterness balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a thick, creamy, and slick mouthfeel that is excellent. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Russian imperial stout! Huge complexity and balance of highly robust roasted flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. An incredibly enjoyable offering; one of the best RIS I have had for sure."
""

"Pours nearly pitch black with a dark beige two finger fluffy head. Dark fruits, berries and chocolate on the nose. Smooth dark fruits, smooth coffee and chocolate notes that are never bitter-almost like a mocha latte but much more subtle. Likewise, regarding the roasted grain and malt. The roastiness is there, but smooth, absolutely no bitterness. Finishes with underlying warming alcohol. Creamy and velvetly full-bodied, exceptional mouthfeel. Excellent variation on an RIS. A perfect example of how a ""big beer"" can subtlely deliver a very high level of complexity."

"Pure black color, but sadly no head formation. Aroma is somewhat mild, but I do get the normal RIS notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and even a light cherry/raspberry fruit. Big flavor with a really big blast of alcohol heat in the finish. Mouthfeel is disappointing; not only is it somewhat thin for the style, but I’m not getting any of the creamy/silkiness you normally get when oats are added to the mash. I was really looking forward to that component of the beer. Those complaints aside, the flavor was still good and I enjoyed the beer. It just didn’t live up to the hype and my expectations."

"A very tasty big stout. I find it to be a bit too sweet, and not complex enough, to really wow me. But it's tasty. A little like drinking chocolate milk. Chocolate milk that gets you drunk."

"O: This is a very well balanced stout with a big, malt-forward flavor and just right hoppiness. Be careful though: it goes down easily so don't get ahead of yourself..."
"Overall a nice beer, but too roasty and bitter for me. The other aspects of the beer are very good however."

"Got this bottle at Gainesville HOB and took it home. Pours pitch black with almost no head. Aroma of rich chocolate, roastiness, and hops. Heavy roasty chocolate flavor with a little bite going down. Finishes with slight currant then explodes with another burst of chocolate. The black currants and sweetness are much higher than the DORIS. Thick mouthfeel. Hearty oatmeal presence and rather easy drinking."
"22oz bottle. Pours a viscous black color with 1/4 inch of medium brown head. Lots of sticky brown lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, dark chocolate, cinammon, and black coffee. The taste is of bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts,vanilla, and some burnt coffee. Hints of cinammon at the end. Very malty and roasty taste. Nice warming alcohol presence. Rich and heavy mouthfeel. Overall, this is big stout worth having again."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. With the intense mix of booze, vanilla, creaminess, char, and fruit, one might surmise, by smell alone, that this was a barrel-aged beer. The depth is certainly there, and the nose is extraordinary with the buttery, creamy, milky sweetness to it. The taste and feel follow nicely, but this thin up slightly towards the end. The taste remained solid throughout, but tended to stray from the aroma in all of its saltiness, and general robustness and uniqueness. Still, this was a delicious beverage, making us even more excited for the real barrel-aged version, as well as the beastly D.O.R.I.S."
"A powerhouse Russian imperial stout! Bold flavors, nicely balanced, outstanding complexity...well worth the plunge into its dark, inviting depths..."
""
""
"Overall this is very delicious. Roasty and dark coffee notes. Still not my favorite form Hoppin' Frog but a very delicious Imperial Stout. Well done."
""
"Overall: Excellent stout. This was my first offering from HF after a friend from the area suggested them. I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a darker, heavier stout that's on the sweet side, but not too sweet. Definitely a sipping stout and I made it last."

"O - Boris is one Mac daddy of a oatmeal stout with a more robust choc presence than many in the style this beer is fairly complex and a touch bitter and would serve great as a nice dessert beer."

"Overall. Great tasting, big stout. A bit of a sipper to say the least."
""
""
""
"What a peculiar stout. For someone who has been drinking a good deal of stouts lately BORIS completely colored out of the lines and changed the way I look at stout potential. The flavor is sharp as a knife and gets more and more pungent as the tasting goes on. Surprisingly, the sweetness of the oatmeal is not used to cut the alcohol which instead makes the flavor profile come off as a very harsh raisin. It looks just beautiful however, which was the most impressive part of this stout. Frankly this beer is better for just a tasting as the flavors tire out the palate towards the end making it not nearly as enjoyable as it was towards the start. BORIS is necessary to try due to the creativity displayed, and I am sure I will have it again no matter the finish."

"Call me an amateur, or a band wagoner, or what have you but I simply cannot fault this beer. If I nicked it half a point anywhere, it would be just because I dont want to rate something all 5's, but if a beer exceeds all of my expectations, why doesnt it deserve all 5's? This one does. If you like BIG, rich, sipping beers that warm your soul, this is an absolute experience for you."
"O- It's well done, and very tasty, but there are others I'd certainly rather turn to. (Stone IRS comes to mind)"

"Very nice. I have the BA Boris ""on ice"". Can't wait for that one."

""
"O: This is a bold, tasty RIS with a solid profile of flavors. Nice touches of bitterness and dryness. I picked a bottle of this up at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, Ohio, while visiting friends in the area in June. Unfortunately, along with the rest of the Hoppin' Frog line, it's not available in my state. Should've grabbed at least another bottle."

"O - I'd be interested to try this one on tap. The best comparison I can think of is Bell's Expeditioner's Stout, which isn't a great compliment."
""
"a much more drinkable, and frankly more likable stout than the destroyer they make. this one still has all the viscosity and alcohol kick, just in slightly less offensive form. it pours impossibly dark, syrupy thick, with a small cocoa colored head on top. its got powerful aromas of dark chocolate and heavy roasted coffee. its also got a lot of booze, so the nose tells me. it almost stings to breath this in deeply. the flavor is very intense, nothing subtle about this beer at all, it really hits you in the face. bitter coffee and unsweetened chocolate are the most obvious flavors, but the residual sugar from the oat addition is also quite bold. the feel is majorly thick, and a whole bomber to the head could kill the inexperienced. a definitely slow sipper that evolves as it warms. its sticky in the mouth, leaving a lot behind, and the alcohol is warming. a great fireside brew in the winter. perhaps a bit too much for this time of year, but this is a monument to what is possible in the big stout category, a massive beer for those so inclined."
""
""
"Picked this up in Buffalo. Pours a jet black with caramel brown head. Tastes of roasted chocolate with the oatmeal and almost raisin like finish. Pretty smooth mouthfeel overall and the big booze with this beer doesn't come through in the taste. A pretty good stout overall."
"Overall, it's pretty awesome. Lots of nose and layers of rich flavors make this beer a great drinker. I'm really looking forward to trying D.O.R.I.S.!"

"Tis is frickin fantastic. Reminds me of Brooklyn chocolate stout but bigger and creamier. This may be mynfavorite RIS because I love the chocolate in stout and when dark fruits are barely there. A+. I will definitely seek more of this!!!"

"Overall this is a solid Imperial Stout but with the inference that this is an Oatmeal Imperial Stout, I was left wanting more. I enjoyed this more than the barrel aged version as that totally stripped the Oatmeal Stout theme."

"Pours black with a dark mocha head that quickly recedes. Alright lacing. A rich, roasty aroma of dark chocolate, roasted barley, some oats and a some alcohol. Flavor follows suit; a very sweet but rich oatmeal stout. A nice thick hit of sweet and bitter chocolate alongside some roastiness and mild coffee notes with a hit of alcohol showing itself. A thick, creamy mouthfeel that is quite awesome. Overall, a bit too sweet an oatmeal stout for my personal tastes. That said, its good for what it is and still an enjoyable brew."
""
"Medium-heavy in the mouth. Tannic and coppery on the tongue."
""
"O: Unimpressive to be honest. I thoroughly enjoyed the BA BORIS in the past, so I decided to give this one a try. I love hops, but the hops are completely off in this one creating an unbalanced aspect. I find myself only noticing chocolate, coffee and hops."
"O - Such a rich beer, I didn't do it justice."
""
""
"O: This did not live up to the hype. It is incredibly delicious and spot on for style. I would still prefer a TenFidy which has the same flavors yet more potent or a Yeti that is on the same line as Boris just a bit more complex. Still I would recommend this stout and will be drinking more of Hopping Frog in the future."

"A great, all-around beer. Pours a jet black color and reeks of roastiness. Taste is full bodied with notes of chocolate, nuts, whiskey, roasted malts, and oatmeal. A bit strong, but a great blend of flavors that finishes smooth. One of the better oatmeal stouts I have tried and worth seeking out."
"i never need to try this again, obviously."
""
"O:	Amazing. Not just one of the best non-barrel aged, readily available stouts out there, it is simply one of the best brews out there, period. Hoppin’ Frog has a real winner here. I feel so lucky that, even in Peoria, IL, that I can somehow get this one year-round. Fabulous. Comes in just ahead of Oskar Blues Ten Fidy and just shy of the barrel aged Old Raspy for me. Also, believe it or not, this standard version is better than the barrel aged version, too."

"Overall this was a tasty little treart with a lot more of the whiskey barrel elements to it than I expect and it makes this beer as good as it is IMO"

"Pours a pitch black color with small-medium dark brown head. Scent is more dark fruit forward than I was expecting. A bit of raisin with some date and plum, also some molasses. More dark fruit with some chocolate and coffee. Taste is sweet toffee at first, immediately followed by a ton of dark fruit character. Kinda like a cross between an imperial stout and a Belgian quad. Nice vanilla with smooth chocolate and strong coffee finish. Drinkability is high. Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth. Overall, this was not what I was expecting, but a great take on an imperial stout."
""

"O - Satisfying, rich, and nice. I might favor a little more complexity in other areas such as char or wood notes, but it's still distinct. I might buy it again."
""

"O- This was definitely a quality RIS all around with a nice slight oatmeal flavor. Nice complexity while still tasting great. Right up there with some of the better ones, however definitely not my favorite. For the price ($12) this was definitely worth it, however there are some even cheaper ones out there that are even better: Stone RIS ($8), Ten Fidy ($16/4-pack), and Speedway (~$15). Definitely recommended to try, however I might go with some others before trying this one again."

"22 oz bomber pours an opaque black with lovely tan head and lacing. Aromas are mild cocoa, dark coffee, and charcoal. Flavor is complex cocoa, coffee, dark fruit, smoke, and a little licorice. Very smooth mouthfeel with dry finish. Overall a very nice RIS!"

"O= This is a beer I would buy often if it were avalible. It's just a solid well made imperial stout that is very drinkable for what it is and keeps you interested without being overly complex."

"originally reviewed on: 06-25-2010"
"Overall - Nothing stands out as spectacular in this beer, but everything really works well together. Oatmeal gives it good body and the rich chocolate gives it a wonderful flavor, really despite the booze. I look forward to the variations on this beer."
""
""
""
"Overall (3.5): This beer feels like it could be great. Maybe it needs to be fresher. Maybe it really benefits from barrel aging. But right now, at about one year on the bottle (at my best estimate), it’s relatively smooth and subdued but not necessarily for the better. I’m not into the harshness of a lot of Russian Imperials, so the “Imperial Oatmeal” idea really speaks to me, but I think there are better examples out there. Good beer, above average, but not a stunner."

"Viscous black with a thin brown head. Aroma is rich, creamy oat/malt. Taste is amazing decadent chocolate, oats, dark malt, silky expresso, dry and char/ leather tobacco, and a bitter chocolate finish. Some near dried fruit or cherry notes in the trailing alcohol finish. Good beer!"

"As it stands, this is a fine RIS but the flavors don't stand out as particularly interesting or special, though they are pleasant in their own regard. The alcohol and residual sweetness stand out far too much, maybe some age will help. Almost cloying."

"Damn, this is a good beer! I so regret breaking that bottle. And it was an extra from the one-and-only Buckeyenation from an IP trade. This stout may not be all barrel aged Belgian vanilla bean anise chocolate coffee bourbon (am I forgetting anything) triple fermented orange peel bretanomyces ... but it's good. Really good. I will get some more BORIS the next time I have a chance! And I left so many on the shelves back east..."
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter, unknown freshness. This pours a semi thick pitch black motor oil color with a smaller mocha colored head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of dark roasted malts, coco, dark chocolate, espresso. The feel is thick and creamy. The taste is great super bitter, lots of dark roasted malts, espresso, dark chocolate. Excellent stout."

"Excellent R.I.S. Everytime I see this one on tap I am forced to get a sample or a pint. So tasty!."
"Pitch black sludge with an edge of coffee clarity. Fizzy medium brown head that fades to a ring within a minute. Nose is massive. Who knew oats could take such a dominating role in a beer? Supported with sweet cream, coffee and chocolates. On the tongue, the coffee plays a more apparent part. The oats are still at work though. Tastes like an oatmeal carbonated cold press - spiked, not stirred. A tasty beer."

"O: An incredibly well balanced, deliciously drinkable imperial oatmeal stout. Went down lovely."
"O- One of the better imperial oatmeals out there. Complex and robust. This bad boy has later after layer of flavor and they almost all hit the mark. That said, it needs to be dialed in just a notch and it would give beers like FBS a good run for their money. If the hop bite was toned down a bit, body tuned up, this could be one of the best imperial stouts period. The more I drink the more I feel like this beer wants to be great, it just can't quite get there."
"Pours black with a chocolate color head. Aroma of bakers chocolate, mocha, and a bit of vanilla mixed with alcohol. Flavor beings with unsweetened chocolate, before moving to sweeter marshmallow and vanilla notes. Toasted cereal, molasses and mocha follow before a roasty finish. Silky smooth. Very cohesive flavor. Finishing a bomber of this won't be a problem."
""
""
""
"Served up this bad boy in two Hopleaf tulip glasses. Pours dark black, with very little head and minimal lacing. Not a lot of corbonation but it works for me. Smells roasty and sweet. Tastes great, definitely not too overbearing and I can probably finish a bomber without feeling too heavy or burdened with a sugar overload. This is a good buy for the quantity, quality, taste and ABV (10 bills). I actually prefer it over the barrel aged version. If you see it, scoop it up and see why everyone is digging on Hoppin Frog."
""
"O: overall quiet a good RIS. Complex palate profile, relatively good drinkability, and a pleasant but unique scent for a stout. I’ve had better RIS’s, but this one is certainly still enjoyable. Worth a try, esp if you are a fan of the style."
"D: Unabashedly boozy, sweet, & very rich. This is a big one – a crusher. There is no doubt that BORIS is hefty - it almost seems barrel aged, but probably isn’t. Robustness & heft slow you down a bit, but incredibly interesting, evolving, and rich flavor keeps bringing you back for more. This beer is a joy to savor."
"O: The oats in the mash add the perfect complement of smoothness and sweetness to the imperial stout style. With 60 IBUs, the hop balance is absolutely perfect. At a deceiving 9.4% abv, this is one of the most well balanced and drinkable RIS's I've had so far. A definite winner."
"O: very delicious, and dangerously drinkable for the ABV, Just a very good beer."
""
"D - While it doesn't smell or taste boozy to me, it's fairly hot on the way down. Despite the richness and heat of the alcohol, this is quite drinkable. I can't stop sipping just to get that luscious feel."
""
"D-Overall this was a solid brew. I enjoyed the different flavors it brought to the table but i can think of many RIS that i like better than this.. This is only my 2nd brew from them so id like to try more. Overall this is a solid RIS and at 9.99$ a bottle a def. pick up if ur craving a RIS"

Not as commanding a Russian Imperial Stout in terms of boldness of flavors as something like Firestone Walker's Parabola. Guess this is pretty good stuff though based on the beers I am comparing it to!"

"Pours a pitch black with a foamy, thin tan head. Kind of a mellow but pleasant smell. Mostly light coffee and sweet caramel malt. Bitterness hints up front, which turns into coffee, roasted malts, and light chocolate. they blend well to give it a very nice sweetness. Finish is relatively smooth but leaves a very profound coffee taste on the back of the tongue. ABV is hidden well. But this sat around for about a year, so it ages well."
"Crazy complex – sweet over roast with hops working in the background. Big, well-constructed and balanced. Well-named; as serious as they come."

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a crystal wine glass- pours a very dark brown/charcoal bordering on black; impenetrable by light except around the edges. There was almost no head when poured; it retains a trace amount of foam and lacing. The smell is faint- at first it smells only slightly of dark malt but I noticed a hint of oatmeal after a few seconds. It tastes of dark malt and molasses up front and then the slight bitterness of coffee towards the end. Only as an aftertaste did I notice any sign of the 9.4 percent abv. This brew is thick and syrupy but with a nice light carbonation to keep it drinkable. This is an excellent Imperial stout and definitely worth a try."
"This is my first Hoppin' Frog experience. There's nothing bad about this beer, but at the same time I don't find anything great about it."
""
"This is simply an outstanding beer. It has a huge flavor with no booziness or unwanted sweetness. Easily one of the better RISs I've had. It is very reminiscent of Old Rasputin in that it has a lot of character, but is quite a bit smoother, creamier, and better balanced. I can't wait to crack open my bottles of DORIS and barrel-aged BORIS."
"O: I loved that the beer was drier than others of this variety, but still felt the flavors could have been more robust."
""

"I did not perceive much in the way of oatmeal character in the malt, but this beer nicely fits the Russian Imperial Stout category. Dense, inky black pour. A bit of sweet roasted malt in the nose. Mouthfeel is dense, a bit syrupy, but thins toward the finish. Deep roasted malt, with no burnt character. Some bourbon notes, even though this is not a barrel-aged version. A bit of black pepper at the finish. Surprisingly drinkable."

"A completely black beer with a thin mocha head. BORIS is a thick, almost to the point of sludgy beer with a roasted malt taste with a noticeable but background hop presences. The oatmeal comes into play as a slight cookie taste. Overall it's a great beer that worthy of a try."

"O: B.O.R.I.S. the Crusher is not a bad stout, but it is not great either. As a matter of fact, I consider this beer to be extremely overrated. Like most American craft breweries these days, Hoppin' Frog seems to have forgotten that not all ales need to be heavily hopped. The high hop bitterness of this beer distracts from the great roasted malt and oatmeal flavors it initially displays, making it seem a bit muddled and off-kilter. If the hops had been reigned in a bit, this would be a fantastic imperial stout, but as is, it's merely okay."

"BORIS pours pitch black with a little bit of head which recedes quickly. There is no lacing, but this is a pretty big beer, and I am not super surprised by the appearance. The aroma is very roasty with little else going on in the aroma. Not bad, actually pretty nice, just doesn't jump out at me. Taste is also very roasty with a bit of coco with a touch of hot alcohol. Not much, but enough to notice. I am also noticing a touch of sweetness which is a nice balance to the roasted barley. Mouthfeel is very good. Thick, but not overly so and it is very smooth. Good level of carbonation as well. Definitely the best part about this beer. Overall, this is a very nice beer that is well brewed, but is not anything outstanding. Definitely liked it though."

"Not bad, not great. Not worth the price. Can't understand why a 22 oz. Bomber of beer made 1 state away is $9.99 locally and the much tastier, higher ABV, Duck Rabbit Rabid Duck Imperial Stout made in North Carolina is $1 more for a 6 pack of bottles. This is not a bad beer, just an overpriced one. Color is as any Imperial should be. Head is almost non existant. No lacing noted. Sweet chocolate, dark fruit and coffee are the overriding flavors. Does not do a good job of hiding the alcohol. This is its weakness and makes it much less drinkable than others. Average American Imperial."

"Overall this beer is pretty good. Not sure how it compares fresh but aged for a year its smooth and highly drinkable for a imperial stout. Halfway through the bottle as the glass warmed, the hops came through more and cut into some of the sweetness, preventing palate fatigue. Not the best stout in the world but I'd gladly stock this in my fridge any day."

"O- Heck of a beer and definitely my favorite RIS to date. I'm glad I live close to Akron so I can get more of this easily. I'll be looking for the barrel aged variety."

"A stellar imperial stout and worthy of the 2008 BABF gold medal. If they upped the body a hair this might be hands down the best Russian Imperial on the market and at 10 a bomber it is sadly priced competitively with the likes of Stone."

"O - This is one of my very favorite stouts, highly recommend this and doubt one would be very disappointed."
"O- Beautiful looking, great smelling, tasty stout. The mouthfeel needs some reworking however. I would like to try the barrel offerings, but I can't imagine the body holding up. I see this beer everywhere and glad I finally picked one up to try."
"Too Intense. I feel defeated. Where's my teddy bear?"
"Overall: An excellent imperial oatmeal stout. One of my favorite beers and one I go back to again and again."
"O - this is a fine RIS. a little too boozy for me to absolutely love it but its an excellent beer."
"O - A very good stout and well worth purchasing. I am definitely going to it buy again if I run into it. Even my wife found it delicious."
"O - Very smooth, very drinkable, great stout. I would have liked to see more oatmeal flavor in it though."
"Poured into a tulip glass. No foam at all. Small carmel colored ring forms around the edge. Color is black in the glass. No light comes through at all. The scent is roasted malt, dark chocolate and a little hop. Very nice. First sip while cold is intense coffee and chocolate. Smooth heavy mouthfeel with surprising carbonation. As it warms up you get a little more carmel sweetness in both the smell and taste. Still lots of dark chocolate. This is great beer. Definitely something to try if you haven't."
"A little two-dimensional between the cocoa and roasty malt, but a solid stout to be sure."
"Note: Drink it paired with something. I drank the first half pint alone -the ph and carbonation take over the palate, mucking with the finish in particular. I drank the rest of the bomber with a well paired appetizer . . . boom! This thing comes alive! Put hair on my chest."
"O: Very good overall, BORIS is definitely going to be a repeat buy if I can find it again."
"O - This has good drinkability. It is most definitely a sipper, but it is a great RIS. Overall, I really enjoyed the flavor, and the mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth. I recommend trying this one. I would buy it again."
"Overall I was really let down. I had heard good things about this beer and I love the genre but this disappointed me. This is the second beer that I didn't enjoy by this brewer. Fearful ee just don't see eye to eye (or eye to liver)."
"O: Definitely something off with this bottle. It was just shy of flat and clearly smells like varnish. Can't apologize for hating this so much. Ends in a drain pour after 3 sips."
"D: A tad on the syrupy sweet side but with a great hop presence and slightly hot exhalation. Overall a very classy stoot that is well balanced for such awesome big intense robust flavors. I can see why all the accolades."
"Overall: Yea, I know the overall is higher than the any of the other scores. This one warrants it. Better than the sum of it's parts."
"Overall Impression- Can't get much better for a Russian Imperial Stout! The only two I've come across that match this one are the Parabola & the Abyss. After enjoying this w/ my cousin, I had to bring back 2 bottles of this to share with friends! I'm going to be sitting on the other one to see how it ages. The flavor of this one did have a minor flaw, but I could pick it out this time around... I say you get this for yourself (If you can find!) and tell me it. Everything else was beyond perfect! A+++ Hoppin Frog!"
"Poured from bottle into pint glass courtesy of jeddsp. Wow. What a tantalizing product. Slowly rolling out the bottle I found a thick dark flow, topped eloquently by a creamy, chocolate crown. Gorgeous. Head lingered a while to boot. Right up front on the nose there is a good mass of chocolate and booze, then behind, the oat and grain. In the mouth it warms, clinging with effervesence, coating the orafice with dark chocolates and fresh oats. The alcohol hides well in the flavor, but is apparent. Good hints of coffee compliment the warm nature. Nice voluptuous body makes this a wonderful beverage. Excellent tick. Competes strongly with the d.o.r.I.s. the destroyer."
"O- A solid brew. No weaknesses at all, aside from not standing out from most solid imperial stouts."
"Thick, opaque black appearance, almost zero head and no retention. Aroma is chocolate coffee, oatmeal, and roasted notes. Nice smell. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very enjoyable. Taste starts with chocolate, coffee, oatmeal with hints of leather, tobacco, and vanilla before finishing with a chalky bitterness. Overall, a barebones RIS but maybe I expected too much given friends recommendations and the rating on this site. The flavors are balanced nicely and complement each other minus the finish, which I don't think matched up to the rest of the present flavors. Didn't find much to distinguish it from the rest of the pack which is a bummer because I really wanted to like it. Just ok."
"A"
"O: I really like this beer. I picked up two in anticipation of liking it, as well as three other offerings from Hopping Frog. Looks like I chose wisely."
"mouthfeel - a bit thin for an imperial oatmeal in my opinion. carbonation is great. this is the biggest let down of the almost perfect drink for me."
"O: This is one of the better non-barrel aged Russian Imperial Stouts I've had to date. After 4 months in the cellar there is a slight bitter finish that is more coffee like than hoppy. It's great well balanced beer as is, but I bet this will continue to improve with age."
"Smooth full bodied mouthfeel. Ridiculously smooth. Like velvet. So drinkable yet you obviously have to take your time with it given the intense flavor and high abv. This one beer will put you on your ass. Definitely a repeat buy and this is my second time trying it."
"Way more hoppy than expected -- ruins what could have been an exceptional beer in my opinion. I can taste some interesting flavors in the background but have a difficult time enjoying them with the hop pucker coming on so strongly. For reasons unclear to me, the Barrel Aged version seems less hoppy and more enjoyable."
"Overall a great beer.... Thanks to HippityHop24 for the trade... CHEERS!!!"
"i like this beer alot. i think a will cook with this beer. i nice beef braise, served over buttery egg noodles, with a warm pint of this beer."
"D: This is a good beer, it has good flavor and is well balanced. In my opinion DORIS is far and away a better beer, but as far as RIS's go, its above average but not quite in the elite category."
"O-Very strong beer,hits you directly in the head after just one glass. You could easily drink it like a wine on some winter months or with some good food."
"IBU: 60"
"Overall, a nicely balanced, rich, and enjoyable sipper."
"Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Glad I finally drank this one."
"Overall - Overall a great Russian Imperial Stout. I don't get much, if any, of the hop additions as the bottle mentions, but I'll just take their word for it. This is probably one of the nicer RISs that I've had the pleasure of trying. Still not quite my favorite but good nonetheless. I'm quite excited to try the Barrel Aged version. Thank you very much kevinv for this beer as an extra in our trade! Really enjoyed it!"
"D ~ Delectable Stout. A sipper for sure, but one you enjoy sipping rather than grow weary of. This is a good one to drink 6-8 oz of & cap up with a rubber cork to be saved for later. It opened up quite a bit."
"O - I was really impressed with this beer and am glad i have another from a previous visit to NY that i was too afraid to open since i was certain i would really like it and not be able to find one for a while. Glad i waited cause the expectation was worth it. One of the best RIS's available."
"O-I really enjoyed this one and I will seek it out again. Nothing extremely complex, but it definitely kept me coming back for more."
"O: I love this stout. An excellent RIS, this will definitely have me looking for more hoppin frog."
"Definitely a stupendous stout! Johnny Boy, hook it up!"
"Pretty damn tasty, huge chocolate and dark fruit. Lots of ancillary stout flavors going on; anise, cardamom, walnuts, black licorice, cocoa nibs...very complex. So smooth and the oats really add to a silky mouthfeel. Awesome beer, I will be more than happy to perpetually have this on my wants list. I really want to try the barrel aged version now."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, with an average amount of carbonation. Leaves a thick film on the inside of your mouth with each sip. Overall, this is a great brew! Another wonderful RIS with a full body and extremely complex flavors. Not the best stout I've ever experienced but still very enjoyable."
"O - A very nice bodacious stout. Makes an excellent dessert item for me right now! I'd easily buy more of these."
"Overall - I was blown away by this one. An incredibly complex beer. It reminds me a lot of The Abyss. Not QUITE to that, but extremely delicious in it's own right. Def. one of the best RIS out there. Cheers"
"O - I wonder if the barrel aged is more smooth... Not worth seeking especially for the price(10.99). There are much better stouts."
"Pretty all right, on the whole, but didn't live up to the hype."
"O: A nice beer that is highly gulpable, despite the high ABV."
"Mouthfeel is good and slick, with a viscous feel that sits well on the tongue. No carbonation at all, and that's much appreciated. On the whole, a great stout all around. I'll have to have it fresh to catch up on the coffee, but it's good to know that it's still retained some excellent qualities given a few years on it."
"This is a fantastic rendition of the Russian Imperial Stout style. For coffee lovers it is very drinkable with savory flavors. As it is warming up a bit to room temperature, the smokiness is easy up and more bittersweet chocolate flavors are coming out. Also, the first sip was almost like tannins on the side of my tongue, now it is more mellow. Hoppin’ Frog, hold your gold medal high!"
"3/25/2011"
"O- This is a nice brew that falls just short of the best in the style. Still, really enjoyable and highly recommended. Pick it up if you haven't tried it yet."
"This big stout pours as a motor oil thick looking brew with a black as night color. The head is thick and brown, with a strong retention of lacing down the glass. The smell of the beer has a big roasted malt aroma with some chocolate, oatmeal and a light hop quality in there too. The taste of the beer is big and chocolatey, it's roasted with some coffee in there. The other flavors on some very mild oatmeal come through in the aftertaste. Finishes on a dry burnt taste. The mouthfeel is thick and oily with some carbonation in there. Overall it's a hefty stout, it's got a ton of body to it and loads of flavor. Very good stuff though."
"A decent oatmeal RIS, though I was surprised to find this wasn't brewed with any coffee as the flavor profile reminded me a bit of Mikeller's Beer Geek Breakfast."
"O: Great beer that i would love to have again. It was very interesting to get some dark fruit notes out of the beer- somthing i havn't seen yet in a imperial stout. Very smooth beer that would be great on a nice cold evening."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The 9+% alcohol is well integrated and as the brew warms maybe becomes a touch distracting. I almost forgot that I had this brew and a recent taste of the new Royale offering reminded me that I need to have a taste of the base brew. This is a pretty solid example but perhaps a bit dated at this point. For as much as I enjoyed the Royale version, it is my intension to get out there and snag a fresh bottle of Boris and the normal barrel aged version."
"Tastes are fully deep dark dark chocolate, soy sauce, French toast, smoke, smog, booze, engine fuel, (milk of) magnesium, plum skins, hops, graham crackers, tree leaves, dark fruits, week-old coffee, cough medicine, and kilned malt. Quite the journey, maaaan."
"O - Just great! Wonderful complexity and consistent throughout the entire bomber."
"O/D - A nice sipping beer, incredibly smooth and generally unobtrusive to the palette. ABV is high, but not obvious. Somewhat filling at times."
"Overall: When the other aspects of this review are so great, what else can I add? B.O.R.I.S. has a dark, malty whallop, a thick body, a bass-line of hop bitterness, and the high alcohol content is very well-concealed. It's definitely not a brew that one would necessarily want to drink all night, but neither are its best bretheren from other breweries. I know the Dark Lords of the world must be great and all (I'm still trying to get my hands on one), but how much better can it get than this??? We're definitely splitting hairs at some point. I can thankfully walk into any of my three favorite liquor stores in my area and buy this whenever I want!"
"Overall: I preferred this one to the BA version. The enjoyed the aroma of the BA version more but the flavor and the mouthfeel of the non-BA version was better in my opinion."
"It's a perfectly delicious Oatmeal Imperial Stout, and totally sexy pouring out of the bottle. Smells good, tastes good. It's thick, viscous, and luscious. But the best part: I love the way it slinks across my tongue."
"O- A really good IRS. I didn't get all that much of the oatmeal quality as expected. Perhaps some age would help bring that out and also reduce some of the alcohol burn felt. At $10.50 a bomber a bit on the steeper side for the quality."
"O. A slow drinker. Between the alcohol feel/content and the definite full body on this bad boy, you want to take your time to enjoy this beer. Not that that is a bad thing, as the flavor will keep you happy the whole way through."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch dark tan head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Tiny spots of lacing dot the glass on the drink down. Smells strongly of dark fruits with some milder dark chocolate and toasted oat aromas. A slight hint of soy sauce comes about as the beer warms. Taste is more stout forward than the smell. Rich dark chocolate, toasted oats, with a cookie dough aftertaste. Very nice. Low carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good RIS with some nice oat qualities. I have been wanting to try this one for a long time and I am glad I finally got the chance."
"I'm pretty happy I got to finally try this one and I need to thank liamt07 for sending it my way"
"O - OK - middle of the tasting group so far. Not bad, not amazing. I recalled really liking this beer last time I had it, and we inserted this as a ""control stout"" into our tasting of mostly well hyped imperial stouts. Going in, we thought we might end up ranking this one very high in the group. Found that I was a bit let down and it didn't hold up to my memories. Body was a bit thin, not much roast/chocolate/coffee - fairly simple and low in complexity compared to the group."
"O: Overall I thought it was an alright beer. I probably wouldn't get it again if looking for an oatmeal stout or a stout of any kind. After being aged it would probably be a lot nicer, but there are many beers out there that taste much better straight from the beer store, out of my fridge, and into a glass."
"O - Good beer. This bottle was about 2 years old, so it may have reaped benefit from the time mellowing; then again, it could've lost a distinctive hoppy punch, just as likely."
"O: A solid RIS, but not my favorite. From what I have seen a bit pricey as well, even though I got this one in a BIF. If I found it for the right price I would certainly get it again though."
"A decent imperial that's worth a try. It's a tad bit too bitter to mark next to my favorites in this genre, but a worthy purchase nonetheless."
"Overall this is a very easy drinking and excellent example of an Imperial Stout. Those of you out there that enjoy your Imperial Stouts should not hesitate to try this brew. Enjoy!!!"
"The main attraction I have to this beer is the balance. All the flavors flow nicely together with nothing overpowering. Better head retention and lacing would have helped this beer, but the aromas, flavors, and mouthfeel make this beer outstanding."
"O: I really like this stout, smooth yet robust flavor. Very good sippin stout."
"Verdict: Superior Imperial Stout - World Class and a must find."
"O - Fantastic stout I will definitely be revisiting in the future. 9.4% alcohol by volume could have fooled me. Instead of a port for dessert give me B.O.R.I.S"
"O- I was very impressed with this one, did a side-by-side with the barrel aged version, they were both good, but I may actually prefer this one."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. A nice tasting RIS, but not incredibly complex. At $8.99 a bomber, I think I'd rather take a 4-pack of Old Rasputin over this, but I feel this has the better mouthfeel than Old Rasputin."
"Overall an awesome tasting Imperial Stout which has the flavors blending so well that the heavy alcohol odor barely shows itself in the taste."
"O. My first Hoppin Frog - call me impressed. This is a big beer that still drinks easily given its ABV and size. Makes for a nice sipper on a cool spring evening. I wish I had access to this around here."
"Cheers..."
"All in all, a solid example of a Russian Imperial, however there really isn't much sweetness to call it an oatmeal stout. That really is why I gave it the score that I did. Maybe it should be called B.R.I.S. But isn't that the Jewish ceremony where a baby boy is circumcised?"
"O- maybe because i just had a nice serpent stout but this seemed a little lackluster. Hopefully the barrel aged is better"
"O: I had moderate expectations going into this, mainly due to the hoppy nature of this beer. I'm very glad to say this blew away my expectations. I know I don't dislike hops in Stouts, I just hadn't found a hoppy stout I liked yet, now I have. I just love the citrus hops in the background to balance things out and add a little depth, with the astringency kept to a minimum. There's absolutely none of the ""chewying on grass root"" finish in this I've grown to dislike in some hoppy stouts. If you like coffee, chocolate, and citrus, you'll love this beer."
"O: A solid effort and an enjoyable beer, but firmly in 'B List' territory."
"O: Overall B.O.R.I.S The Crusher isn't for the average beer drinker or the weak, It's depth of flavors open up nicely as it warms , Very solid RIS that I will be seeking out again."
"Less booze and a little bit less hops and this one could rock. The malt base is pretty good. I'm guessing plenty of people love this the way it is, but it isn't quite there for me yet. Although BORIS is Certainly a pretty good beer."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin for a stout like this. Good offering."
"D-This is a pretty good beer, but the alcohol is a little obvious for my taste. I might try this one again."
"O: This was pretty lacking, but I had pretty high expectations - the basic flavors were there, but they didn't seem to work together so well, the negative flavors and alcohol burn detracted from them, and the mouthfeel was really pretty thin. By no means a bad beer, but nothing too special either."
"O: Really solid and possibly even better than the barrel aged version."
"O- This is a good stout and I am glad I have another bottle try, hopefully it has a head. I have to say this is not a complex stout but a nice sweeter/chocolaty stout."
"D: The flaws in this one are very nitpicky as I am very impressed. I can't wait to try the other variations!"
"Pours a pitch blackish-brown. A bold, dark tan head laces the glass, yes. Smell is excellent, dark-roasted espresso coffee and oatmeal cookies. Taste is excellent as well, an almost harmonious blend of coffee, dark chocolate, and oats. A perfectly suitable hop backbone and bitter/sweet aftertaste all the while. I'd drink a few, and that's about all I could drink. My favorite RIS I've sampled so far. Great beer."
"This is one formidable stout. Lookout staple stout brewers, these guys are seriously out for blood. When I want an oatmeal stout, I will buy this again without question."
"Rich, smooth, full-bodied, very light effervescence. Even better warm. This is a truly great beer. Enjoy."
"This is a great beer. I like oatmeal stouts to be a bit smoother feeling, but that's my only complaint here."
"Overall, this is pretty drinkable and very tasty. Although quite thick, B.O.R.I.S it is very tasty and well balanced throughout with a pretty well hidden ABV. A great representation of the style IMO."
"O- I must qualify my changing of review. Recently returning to enjoying more of the classic micro style of all beers. I know everyones pushing the limits, but taste has a lot to do with final impresions. Sometime IMPERIAL just means to much. I like flavor but when a pallette is overwhelmed at what point does it stop being able to continuously enjoy the beverage in hand."
"O: Considering its strength, the beer is very drinkable because the alcohol is well masked from the taste. Nonetheless, the robust flavors make this beer a good sipper and the full-bodied nature makes it feel quite filling."
"One of the first Imperial stouts that really made an impression. Solidly above its peers"
"BORIS is a beauty and one of the better big beers out there, though the best in the world work out the subtleties to be world-class."
"pours typical black stout color with frothy brown head. thick lacing. smells of faint roasted malt. slight chocolate notes. taste is of bitter dark chocolate, with very little sweetness. the alcohol is hot in the flavor as well. mouthfeel is nice and smooth. drinkability, well, I was disappointed in this one. It's highly rated (and maybe mine is too fresh) but the bitterness and bite from the alcohol make this a mediocre offering."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is viscous and jet black with a dark chocolate colored, thin, dense head. Smells of chocolate, dark malt, and booze. The beer has a smooth start of subtle chocolate notes followed quickly by a bitter blast of coffee. Slightly malty and syrupy finish with smooth and coffee flavored aftertaste, and a boozy highlight. Strong flavors make a decent winter warmer, but not a high volume consumption."
"O- Not sure if it was suppose to have the red fruit element or not but, it was very good. Overall a very smooth beer that has a good amount of fruit characteristic for a stout"
"Overall a very good beer, but best to share this one with a friend. It's just so rich that it's hard to drink the whole bottle. I'm thinking it would be perfect after dinner."
"D-This would age beautifully, but is drinking really well now."
"Overall, I'm enjoying this Imperial Stout, and loving the name. Recently I've had both this and Beer Geek Breakfast and have decided that oats are definitely a good addition to any imperial stout. Something about the oats adds a certain quality of smoothness and creaminess that I don't always detect in non-oated stouts."
"at 9.4%...i can drink a bomber alone....but that is it..the alcohol is well blended and not obvious..."
"D: It goes down easily and I feel as if I could go for another."
"I actually really like this beer. I'm not a huge coffee person, so the chocolate is nice, and I like how it's balanced out. It may still be a tad pricier than I'd prefer, but it's a nice beverage and I'm glad to have it."
"Pours dark brown with no head the speak of. Smells dark malty and roasted. Coffee on the nose coupled with some sweet malts. Tastes a bit overpowering. The bitterness from the hops and roasted coffee flavours are overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and not particularly carbonated and the beer suffers from the added bitterness. Honestly im not that impressed with this beer especially compared to Doris. Might improve with some age..."
"D-very drinkable. Nice brew"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a dark milk chocolate, 2-finger head with nice lacing. Licorice black, opaque espresso body. Slightly alcoholic aroma and usual suspects of deep, rich malt roast and mix of floral/grassy hops. Creamy, sweet oatmeal-raisin cookie with even some prune/plum tones. Alcohol is definitely there but well-blended with sugar and nice chicory finish. This coats well and takes balance of all in excess - natural sweetness, hop bitterness and solid chocolatey, coffee malt. This was a pleasure to savor and now one of my favorite oatmeal-inspired Russian Imperial Stouts."
"Drinkability is very high for an imperial stout, with only a mild alcohol presence. My glass was emptied pretty quickly, and I could easily drink a bomber or more of this."
"Drinkability is good though at 9+% ABV I have to go easy with it. It's a very nice sipping stout that I would like to try again."
"I had my eye on this beer for a while. I'd heard good things about it and jumped on a chance to buy a bottle when I saw it at a local store. Am I ever glad that I did! I can definitely see myself getting another bottle of this in the future. If you like stouts, and especially an imperial stout, I would go out and try to find one of these. I give it 9 out of 10."
"D- Very easy to sip on this one and I will seek out more to enjoy again!"
"D - I had a hard time with the bitterness in this beer."
"D: If this was sold around here, I would absolutely have a few around at all times. Very good beer."
"this beer pours pitch black with a thin tan head even though it was poured vigorously. the smell s of roasted malt, hint of chocolate and the abv is a little aparent in the nose. the taste is fairly similar to the smell, the roasted burnt malt character comes through nicely, but the abv is more apparent than would be expected for the style. even though the alcohol heat is apparent the beer is still very drinkable."
"D-this is definitely a sipper and its not my stout of choice. the tastes do stay well but a whole bomber of this is just too much."
"D: This is a top notch RIS without following the herd. Truly unique, yet, recognizable as an RIS. This is a must have for any who can get their hands on it."
"(D)- Very disappointed with this one. The very off-putting peanut flavor could be the beginnings of an infection, but I cannot be sure. This must be a fluke, because this seems to get rave reviews, but I am not seeing it with what is in front of me. I will re-review to be sure in the future."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours deep brown with a nice caramel head. Great lacing with thousands of tiny bubbles clinging to the glass. Rich aroma of some kind of good coffee and bitter chocolate. An almost vinous note also, which I really love in a big stout. Flavor is heavy, some hops up front, dark fruits, that vinous touch, and creamy and lush in the finish. Very impressive, especially because this is not my favorite style by any stretch. The bottle becomes a little bit heavy and burdensome after time."
"D-This is a very good RIS, but not quite capable of sharing the accolades of the very finest of this great style. That said, I am disappointed this bomber is depleted and I can't buy this in Oregon"
"Pretty good mix of flavors and feel. I'd have again, another winner for drinkability from Hoppin' Frog."
"D - This beer lives up to the hype: A big imperial stout that's dangerously drinkable. You can barely tell you're drinking a 9% ABV beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - I wasn't so impressed when I had this beer the first time around, but I drank it straight from the cellar this time and I believe the proper temperature makes this beer shine; I could chug it constantly..."
"Cellar-aged version released by Hoppin' Frog. Had during Hobo Tasting #2 with mikesgroove. Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit snifter. Poured pitch black with a minimal brown head that subsided to no head to speak of slowly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, sweet malt, chocolate, and dark fruit. The flavor was of roasted malt, sweet malt, chocolate, dark fruit, and cream. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a complete transformation of the regular brew. It has been in my cellar for a little over a year and there is no clue how long it was in storage before I bought it, but this thing was nice. As Mike stated, the alcohol burn was completely gone which allowed the dark fruits to open up in all their beauty that I had never experienced on this brew before. Definitely became a more complex and tasty brew with time. This brew really shocked me. An absolute MUST try if you can find the version to save yourself some time, or you can just throw a few in your own cellar and wait. Trust me, it is worth it!"
"D - I had a new holland the poet earlier that tastes like sour, band-aid and copper penny so I thought this may be a bad luck day for stouts so I was tempted to go with a quad, but I saw Boris sitting as the first stout next to my quads and took it as a sign. Glad I did. Not the best, but this is worth picking up as a go to for when your tops aren't around. I'll be picking more of this up - definitely recommended."
"D - Fantastic stout. Definitely worth seeking out. It took an hour or so to finish the 22oz bomber, and afterwards I felt like I'd eaten a four course meal, but I would definitely like to enjoy another sometime soon."
"D: The bitter burnt flavor lingers much longer than it should. It was still there two glasses of water later. I know that that is part of the higher hopping rate at work, but its really not that much hoppier than Old Raspy. I wanted to love this beer and understand why others do. For me, its just not on the same level as other great RIS's."
"The CPJ"
"I really enjoy drinking this one. It is a perfect blend for the rocky road cake treat dessert I will be tasting soon."
"Very good and interesting beer. Not overwhelming in any sense. Its bigness is well hidden. Mellow and easy drinker."
"Pitch black in color; essentially no head aside from a few brown hued bubbles here and there. Chocolate malt dominates the aroma with some roasted malt as well. Aroma is a bit subdued and underwhelming. Plenty of chocolate in the flavor, accompanied by more roasted malts, coffee flavors and a nice bitterness. A lasting rich, dark-roasted coffee aftertaste. Sweet with a full, chewy mouthfeel. Tasty, definitely shows the full body and sweetness of an oatmeal stout with the flavor and complexity of an RIS. Just had a few shortcomings I couldn't overlook."
"One of my faves. I'm glad to see Ohio brewing some insane stouts. I'm always down for some B.O.R.I.S. Highly recommended! Go get this one right now.."
"T- Great beer, not like other imperial stouts, definitely will be having this again."
"A fantastic Imperial Stout. Dunno why I waited so long to try this as I had a feeling I'd love it and I indeed do. Can't wait to crack open the barrel-aged version I have sitting in the cellar!"
"D: all around a very pleasant drinking experience. Leaves me feeling feel so this is one I would reserve for a night cap or as a dessert - not the brew to start of a night of activity."
"Pours pitch black, minimal whisp of a brown head that doesn't last. Lacing makes a purdy design, kinda like an orange cross-section. Smells like chocolate up front, some vanilla and oak in the back, minimal coffee, slight anise, but mostly chocolate. Taste is more complex; sweet malt up front that quickly changes to chocolate and coffee with a nice bitterness that cuts the sweet. Dark stone fruits covered in chocolate, dates, and dark bread. Mouthfeel is spot on for me, not cloyingly sweet and thick, but just about right- it could be a tad thicker. Carbonation is small but plentiful and carries this beer wonderfully."
"Drink- I'm all for this beer. I'm now super anxious to try the B.A. version for X-mas eve."
"D - Much better than the BA version."
"Appearance is a deep dark brown with a one finger head that quickly dissipates down to a thin lace. Minimal lacing as it goes down. Smells of dark rich chocolate, and slight alcohol notes. Taste is of toasty malt with mocha. Oats give it a nice aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very creamy. Drinkability I think was quite high for a big beer."
"D- My friend and I usually split a bomber over the course of an hour while playing guitar. We finished this in under 20 minutes -- that is to say, this is extremely drinkable, especially for the ABV."
"Bottle. Pours beautiful black color with a lovely, foamy head. Aroma is of coffee, dark fruit and brown sugar. Flavor is coffee, chocolate with lingering hoppiness at the end, liquorish like. Smooth, full body. Wonderful Imperial Stout. One of my favorate."
"Overall - A supremely good stout but a 650ml bottle of this is way too much in one sitting... recommended..."
"Impressive wafting roasty aromas and tastes. Chocolate, coffee, roasty malts, balanced well with some hop character and dark caramel malts. Full body with lower carbonation."
"Overall, a very nice imperial stout. Reminds me a bit of the Yeti, but I believe sweeter and more bitter. Some age might make this awesome."
"I prefer the barrel aged version slightly over this one but it's still very good."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The body is close to heavy, but not exceptionally so. Carbonation is low and it feels pretty creamy in the mouth. This is one hell of a stout. I can see how it does so well at G.A.B.F. I bought the barrel-aged version as well, which I am very excited about."
"Fairly easy drinker for a big beer."
"D: Definetly one of the better oatmeal stouts out there. Its not too heavy, but still nice and rich. A perfect sipper if you're into chocolate stouts."
"o - overall just a great beer. time does nice for this one...one of my favs. 4.5"
"I get a little pissy when I see the tag on Hoppin Frog beers and I've been burned by their prune-tastic IPA's in the past. But this entry is a winner and by memory only, better than the barrel version. There will be verification."
"Pours a dark black color with an off-white foam head. Has an arome of chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. Has a smooth stout taste with notes of chocolate and coffee. Very smooth brew. Nice bitters on the back end. Very Subdued. A very delicious Imperial Stout."
"Really great, sadly it's just a tad on the expensive side for a beer I'd get often (if only it was even distributed in Maine)."
"Excellent beer. Pours black with a deep chocolate colored head that appears out of no where. Well retained, with a nice smell of milk chocolate and raisins. As it warms up, the coffee comes through. The same can be said for the taste. Not much of the oatmeal comes through in flavor, but is great in the head retention. Smooth and velvety, with just enough carbonation to keep the texture perfect. The alcohol is masked excellently in this beer."
"T-really great, not like other imperial stouts I have had due to the major silkiness of it."
"Drinkabilty - Well, this 22oz'er is nice for a sitting, i can leave it sit and sip on it. But its strong and bold, you cant treat this like a regular stout, so one and done for me. Fantastic, will be buying again."
"Taste is great. So creamy from the oatmeal, with dark and milk chocolate and coffee being the driving flavors. A bit of caramel, toffee, and dark fruits are there too. Mouthfeel is perfect. Creamy, viscous, smooth. Just a bit of carbonation that makes it feel velvety."
"Overall, this is a good example of a Russian Imperial Stout, and my bomber is going pretty quickly. Complex, flavorful, and a good-lookin' beer too. B.O.R.I.S. was a good choice for a 200th review."
"Drinkability: This is pretty much a no-brainer if you see it. I imagine it could be laid down, but as I said before, I really don't think it has to be. A rich, balanced, bold, nuanced version of the style that's completely worth the time and effort to track down and sip. This is only my second Hoppin' Frog brew, but I'll be on the lookout for everything I can find from now on."
"22 oz. bomber I snagged at Julio's. Poured into a balloon glass, it's a deep, dark, sexy shade with a small head but good lacing. Nice burnt coffee and dark chocolate in the nose. Taste is just the right balance of coffee notes, chocolate notes, and roasted malt notes, plus a wee bit of hop presence in the back. A little boozy, but I didn't mind that while watching Sunday football. It actually made me yell at the TV less, which rarely happens. This is a great all-around stout. Maybe not as stellar as Stone IRS, but right up there."
"Overall, as soon as I found out BORIS hit Florida I asked Chris at Florida Wine and Spirits to order some. He hooked it up and I am now a happy BA. Thanks Chris!"
"D- This beer was good. In fact it was the whole bomber good. The higher ABV though limits it to just about that...a bomber. Hoppin Frog is a brewery that I always seem to forget about but make fantastic beer from what I have had."
"I like it and would definitely buy this one again."
"MF/D- So creamy you could walk on it. Excellent body that just coats your mouth. Other than the 9.4%, extremely drinkable."
"D - Tasty, smooth, rather easy drinking for a big beer. Pretty good, although the BA version ups the ante for this series for sure."
"Too smooth, rich and perfectly carbonated. Reminiscent of the oatmeal bourbon and chocolate cookies I had eaten earlier in the day. Phenomenol flavor, and so drinkable. There is a hint of dark fruit in there, but not too much. Drank this warm and the flavors were perfectly aligned."
"Hoppin' Frog is one of my favorite brewers thanks to this awesome brew."
"SkÅL!"
"D: Yeah ... this thing is phenomenal."
"D -- This went down pretty easily, which is mildly alarming at 9.4 percent abv. I definitely will buy this beer again."
"Notes - Overall this is a good beer but it didn't blow my socks off. I would have another but wouldn't rush to the store to buy one."
"Drinkability: One word comes to mind when I think back fondly to this beer: THICK. This beer is great and lives up to the hype! Big and heavy ABV does knock it down a bit, but this is a great beer for a cooler/cold night and I will definitely be picking some up to age for a bit, but don't let it fool you, it could be enjoyed anytime."
"D - Great for any occasion, could drink this on a regular basis."
"$7.90/De Vines/22 oz"
"Pours a thick black color with a very dark brown head. Aromas of espresso, roasted malt and dark chocolate. Thick and chewy body, with dark brown sugar, freshly brewed coffee with cream, dark raisins and baker's chocolate. Good, but a pedestrian imperial stout in my opinion."
"D: Very, very easy to make this one disappear."
"For wahtever reason, i found the flavors lacking in such a big beer, maybe it was the amount of oatmeal? Not sure, but i was definitely expecting more."
"M- Full bodied and very smooth. Hoppin Frog never fails on the mouthfeel of their stouts."
"D- fantastic RIS. Worthy of all the love it gets. The flavors aren't big enough to knock you on your ass, but they are definitely there. And they are awesome"
"I'm in love with B.O.R.I.S."
"Drinkability is fantastic! Its among the easiest drinking big stouts I've ever had! No gumminess to speak of, I was able to down a whole bomber by myself in under an hour! 4/5"
"D: You can just barely detect that its 9.4% in the finish, other than that, it drinks very good for a RIS. Wish I had this in my fridge all the time or at least be more readily available."
"Drinkability-Very drinkable, quite tasty."
"D: Goes down fairly easy for such a big beer but the apparent nature of the alcohol hurts a bit."
"D: A good, but not great, beer. I really enjoy oatmeal and imperial stouts. I was hoping for a little more."
"OVERALL: Great stuff! I really enjoyed this. Compared to a fresh bottle, this one was much less sweet and the flavors meshed together much better. The palate was also softer and more appealing. A year of age has certainly done this brew well. Unlike the young bottle, I had no problem finishing this one by myself. A more persistent head would help the scores on this one, but that doesn't detract from the experience whatsoever. If you're sitting on a bottle that's about a year old, this is a great time to pop it open."
"Pours an opaque black colour with hints of brown. Almost no head. This looks very thick. Smell is huge of roasted malt, oatmeal, vanilla and sweet raisins. Flavour has a kick of bitterness to join the roasted flavours. Very delicious. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Hard to drink a lot of this with the abv, but I'm having no issue polishing off this bomber after my first ever 10km run. One of the better imperial stouts I've had."
"Drinkability: Superbly drinkable."
"I like this it poured dark and chocolaty and is really nice. Again it is in the top bears for a reason a must have."
"D: This is an excellent RIS, very much worth seeking out if you like the style. I could easily see making this a regular habit if the price was right, not to mention availability in KY."
"Pours a truly midnight black, with a dark brown head and red highlights. Gorgeous, I know this is gonna crush me. Finger or so of head settles to an extremely thin layer with a collar. Aroma is of vanilla, molasses, roasted maltiness and a whiff of booze. Taste is fairly similar, leading with some roasty and boozy mouth and becomes an intricate mix of chocolate, molasses, a touch of coffee and alcohol that glides slickly over the tongue. Maybe a touch of dark fruits in the finish here, ends slightly dry also. This mouthfeel is unreal, like velvet on the tongue. Drinkability is quite high as well, alcohol is not completely hidden but is intricately woven amongst the other elements of this beer. An excellent beer, truly."
"Good beer and rather enjoyable. BORIS did not live up to my expectations, I had hoped for much more. I would drink this one again, just not on the top of my list."
"D: For the style, it's near perfection. The ABV is high, but not as high as many other RISs. With drinkability being relative to octane level - I could drink this all day!"
"Kind of disappointed as the beer fades, doesn't really linger as long as thought it would, but still good!"
"Notes: I could do wthout the long sweet aftertaste, but overall i lovethis beer."
"The beer is a deep, dark black color with a thin brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thin but dense lace on the glass. The aroma is of coffee, chocolate, oats, dark malts and a touch of dark fruit. The taste is full of roasted coffee & oats, smoky malts, dark chocolate, toasted oats some dark fruit and an ever-so-slight alcohol burn. The beer has a very mild hops presence but it's stronger than you would expect in the style. The after-taste is bitter-sweet. Very smooth with a little crispness, medium-to-heavy body, light-to-medium carbonation, sticky finish."
"First impresion is alcohol burn, followed by a roast, bready flavor. not as much coffee or chocolate flavors as I would expect. There is a lingering alcohol burn. While this beer is very viscous, I am not tasting a corresponding amount of intense flavor to back it up... a bit too boozy for my preference. This is by no means bad, just a little unbalanced. I'd like to see some more roasted flavor, or a nice hoppiness to round this beer away from the alcohol."
"Palate is smooth, full, and creamy. A very good RIS overall. Better than the -bal aged version in my opinion - tried them side-by-side."
"D - Fairly easy to drink, just not sure if I'd want to. It was certainly smooth and creamy, but I just found this to be too hoppy for my taste. I like my stouts roasty and chocolately and the like. Other reviews mention nothing about the hop level, so perhaps I'll have to revisit this to see if it was an off bottle. Disappointing."
"D - An excellent IS. I enjoyed every drop of this one."
"Sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"D: Love this beer. No need to say anything else."
"D - Very easy to drink for a strong stout, but watch out... You'll feel the effects of BORIS if you don't take your time drinking this one. Definitely a sipper, but it's hard to sip a beer that tastes this good."
"Glad I got to split this with my brother two days before his wedding. The dark fruit taste wasn't my favorite, probably won't be having again."
"Black pour with minimal head. Lots of chocolate aroma, molasses, and a fair amount of alcohol. Lots of chocolate flavor upfront, oats lending to a nice smoothness of flavors and a very bitter coffee finish. Medium-thin body, lots of alcohol warming, dry finish."
"D: Alcohol is well masked and though the bitter coffee and over the top oat maltiness can be somewhat cumbersone, this is still a damn drinkable and delicious brew"
"Not sure how many of these I can pound down. After half a glass I'm making stupid Spoonerisms in my beer review and have a strong desire to visit Vietnam due to a show I'm watching on Travel Channel. Yeah, this is good beer, but I'm glad I don't have to drink another. I'd be on the roof yelling stuff at the neighbor about figs and getting shades on their second floor bathroom. Frankly, I looked at the word ""roof"" a few times and it looked funny to me. Could be a long night and a rough morning as I am now rooting around the beer fridge for something else. :)"
"The high abv and richness of this beer make it hard to drink quickly. Nevertheless, I found it extremely enjoyable and look forward to drinking this again, preferably where I can split the bottle with a friend or two!"
"Drinkability - Very pleasant to drink, however at the end of the bottle I was feeling...well, nice :) Two bombers of this stuff would probably be my limit. But the ABV is really the only thing that would keep me from drinking this over a long period of time."
"Notes: Hmmm, nice quality brew, but it is not half as outstanding as the hype would have one believe. Since this is relatively newly distributed to the area it will pick up on the novelty but on a regular basis it will have a tough competition from some other regular distributed brews on an equal or superior footing."
"Drinkability: Very good sipper. Not a beer that I could throw back 3 or more glasses of in a night. Even with a sub 10% abv, this one matches up fairly well with the heavy hitters."
"Body is pitch black. Tan head recedes to a thin film. Aroma is heavily reminiscent of coffee beans and dark chocolate. Flavors are quite complex with notes of coffee, chocolate, and licorice. Hints of dark fruits in the aftertaste. In all, a well-done stout worth going out of your way for."
"Thanks to stacecom via reddit. Delicious imperial stout. B.O.R.I.S. pours black with brown highlighting the very edges of the glass. The most negative thing that I can say about this beer is that there's almost no head. You can swirl one up - it's very dark even for a stout, a medium brown - but it dissipates quickly. The aroma is rich with roast and chocolate. There's just a ton of malt packed into this one. Vanilla bean, caramel and molasses round things out. This beer would be a great base for a beer float. The taste is also quite good. It's sweet with a warming finish. Roasty notes persist in the aftertaste. The feel is smooth and soft as a dog's ear. I like the low carbonation and it's definitely worth the lack of a head. It's a very easy beer to drink; my bomber is going fast. I would love to have this beer available in my area, and I'm very happy to have a second bottle in the cellar."
"Can't wait to try the other bottles I am going to let age even longer."
"O - amazing. This beer doesn't get enough talk, and it deserves all of it's praises."
"This is a thick-tasting beer, rich and full in the mouth. I have other Hopping Frog beers already in the cellar (they're easy pickings around here, given that it is an Akron brewery), otherwise I'd get another the next time I was out."
"D: This was a fantastically crafted beer with lots of flavors all blended and balanced perfectly. It hid the alcohol very well, so it was dangerously easy to drink. But the thickness and complexity made it better for sipping. This Hoppin' Frog met the hype; definitely recommended."
"A good RIS, but not really my preferred approach to the style."
"D - surprisingly drinkable for an imperial stout... i could have another."
"D: One of the best, most drinkable beers of the style."
"I've been wating to try this bad boy for some time. It begins. The pour results in a thick, viscous tar pit filling my snifter, topped by a half-finger of dark brown foam, which sinks into the dinosaurs' abyss fairly quickly. The nose comprises dark coffee (complete with a light hint of olfactory bitterness), roasted and toasted malts, and charred wheat. Something seems off here, but I can't put my finger on it. Are the malts too blackened? I dunno, but it's something like that. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate syrup, coffee, blackened oats, and a slightly bitter aftertaste. A step above the nose, fer sure. The body is pretty thick 'n' chewy, but not too, with a moderate carbonation (higher than I expected, but, again, not too much so) and a decent oral coating. Overall, I see this as a solid stout, but not among the better ones. Still definitely worth a shot, though."
"Very impressive beer, must try the barrel-aged version ASAP!"
"Thick and viscous body, almost like a syrup. but goes down very smooth. An interesting taste overall (sweet, sour, dry), and it is hard to find the 9.4% alcohol. A word of warning: take your time with this one. It will sneak up on you. Makes a great dessert beer."
"Drinkability is very high. I didn't have any problems finishing this bottle. That being said, I don't think I could have more than two pints should I be lucky enough to find it on tap somewhere. One bottle did nicely."
"This beer is an excellent example of the style and a true pleasure to enjoy. Great beer!"
"This beer is quite good. Yes, that just about sums it up. Poured extremely dark, pretty much pitch black with a tannish head. Retained for a while, no lace. This is an incredibly chocolatey beer with bits of cocoa powder, earthy bitterness, more chocolate, and roastiness. Maybe a touch of leather as well. Silky smooth and velvety. I'd drink this all day."
"Overall great beer."
"I stand by my high, hype-affirming ratings for DL and BCBCS, but this is easily in that league, and I can't wait to see how the barrel-aged version stacks up."
"Note: Even though it looked like syrup with little head, the carbonation was actually pretty good. This was not as toasted as I expected (flavor wise) but it was a really good beer."
"Not my favorite but there is nothing bad about this beer really. I bought this while I was out of state and probably would save my money or buy something else if given the chance again. Not bad but doesn't stand out to me. Good beer but not great. Rather have a Stone IRS any day."
"Been wanting to have this beer for a while, besides it being thin for the style, tasty brew that i'd have again."
"D - Good stout...heard it's great with some age on it."
"d - A very nice RIS. I thought the smell was great and taste was quite enjoyable as well. Would definitely have again."
"o - very smooth drinking beer. sweet and chocolaty, but not over powering as its balanced by a slight bitterness on the end."
"B.O.R.I.S. is as good as any of the great Stouts I've had. It's complex, well-balanced, flavorful, and versatile. Despite it's darkness and high-gravity, it would work as well on a hot day (in moderation) as it would after a winter dinner."
"A very well-made RIS, BORIS is worthy seeking out. Despite not tasting the variety of flavors which many beers of the style impart, the combo of fresh coffee and sweet chocolate made this memorable for me. Now on to the barrel-aged version..."
"Very nice drinkability. The oats add some awesome smoothness. Very nice. Also, the oats make the chocolate flavors more on the milk chocolate than dark chocolate side which is really awesome."
"Pours a luscious opaque sable that is just one red tomcat whisker above black, with a fine-bubbled chocolaty head that sticks around for a bit - most inviting! Rich, oily aroma has a strong tone of quality roast coffee with a hint of brown sugar and a touch of sweet chocolate. Lip-smacking flavor fills the mouth with fine coffee, chocolate and molasses as well as a nice but not overly fierce alcohol bite. Sublime texture is smooth yet edgy and quite tingly, leaving a lively and slightly sweet finish. The Crusher indeed!"
"D: A truly unique amped-up oatmeal stout. The price tag is somewhat off-putting as I can think of a lot of beers I can pay under $5.50 for 12oz and enjoy as much if not more. Still, it is an outstanding beer with a good flavor niche."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Dark, dark, black in color with very little tan lacing but no head. Smooth chocolate, roasted malt and oats are the major flavors. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery for a russian imperial stout. Alcohol is well hidden. Very drinkable."
"B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher Oatmeal Imperial Stout pours just about opaque black with a dark brown head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is nice, a bit fruity. The flavor is intense, malty roast and dark fruit are most noticeable. You can definitely taste the alcohol. The mouthfeel is quite nice, the oatmeal does give a bit of silkiness. A very nice beer."
"D - B.O.R.I.S. is definitely one of the best of its kind in America, no doubt about it. Goes down quite easily for being an almost 10% monster! However, I will say that I enjoyed this slightly more from the bottle than on tap, although I never reviewed the bottle version. I'll have to get on that... pronto!"
"Pours black with chocolate-brown fringes, but there is literally no head, even in the Duvel tulip that can normally create an outrageous head on anything. The aroma is a welcoming blend of earthy sweetness and roasted malt. The flavor seems to be predominantly dark chocolate, though. And not ""dark chocolate"" in the sense of what Hershey's considers dark chocolate to be, either. Straight-up gourmet, 70% pure cocoa, who-pays-this-much-for-a-candy-bar dark chocolate. The texture is likewise decadent, being somehow both silky and creamy. The high alcohol is only barely detectible, which combined with the luxurious flavor makes BORIS highly drinkable."
"D: With the less-viscous body, it's more drinkable. Definitely a tradeoff I've noticed quite often lately with some of the imperial stouts."
"Very well crafted stout, and a solid example of the style."
"Once again richbrew feeds me another great impy. Poured from 22oz bottle to snifter on 4/3. Black in color with a thin mocha head. Oily all the way. Smells of chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, and light alcohol. Taste follows smell to the T. Full bodied and low carbonation. Very bloody delish!"
"D: I could have a couple pints of this with out it getting to old. definitely one of the better stouts I have had"
"This beer pours a deep dark impenetrable brown that one would expect from this style. The head is a nice tan color, but loosely packed and does not leave the greatest lacing. The aroma is very roasty but also has a nice malty sweetness to it, and a tinge of citrus hops. Very intense nose on this one with bittersweet chocolate, licorice and coffee notes in there as well. The flavor is similar with a nice deep roasty stout flavor balanced with plenty of sweetness from dark malts. Dark dried fruits, burnt sugar, chocolate and licorice flavors are evident, as are some piney hop notes and a bit of booziness. This also has a bit of that black patent astringency thing going on. This is a big chewy stout with a full mouthfeel to be sure, but not as full or chewy as the best in the class. The finish is a nice balance between sweet and dry that leaves a pleasant lingering taste on my tongue. If I have one complaint about this beer, it is that for being an oatmeal stout, it seemed to be lacking that silky smoothness. Still a great beer and a nicely drinkable RIS."
"D = This is pretty easy drinking for the style. The bitterness and sweetness are both present and well balanced, a good drinking imperial stout."
"D: quite the easy one to drink. I dont see any problem finishing the whole beer. no hotness from alcohol and the creamy finish just lets me keep sippin away. Quite enjoyable i must say"
"I received a bottle of this fine stout from a friend as a gift. There was a sticker on the bottle indicating that the bottle had been cellered for a year. The brew pours a dark coffee color out of the bottle. The head was rather minimal and the weakest aspect of the tasty delight. The smell is a nice mixture of toffee and coffee with hints of the alcohol within. The taste is coffee and really no alcohol...ooops...just a very very slight alcohol hit...barely perceptible. A very nice smooth flavor and feel. A lovely beer. Seek out and enjoy!!!"
"Drinkability: A very nice oatmeal stout with great flavor. The ABV is well hidden. I would like to drink this again sometime."
"I might not consider this ""refreshing"" on this warm spring afternoon, but little alcohol is noticeable except with big whiffs. A joy to drink."
"Very solid"
"Pours flat black with almost no carbonation & only about 1/2"" of nice tan, coffee colored head, which kind of lingers for a bit. The aroma is unbelievably delightful with strong scents of oatmeal & coffee with the slightest scent of vanilla, almost as if it had been aged in a bourbon barrel. The taste is just as delicious as the aroma. A pleasantly smooth bitterness of oatmeal, chocolate, & a hint of coffee, balanced well by a slight vanilla undertone. The mouthfeel is almost as orgasmic as the taste. INCREDIBLY SMOOTH & creamy with just the right amount of carbonation to contribute some bite to the brew. This brew drinks unbelievably well, especially considering its 9.4%. Overall a magnificent brew. No question its in my top 5 easily. Have to give a big thanks to my mom for picking this up for me while she was in NC. What a great woman!"
"D: Simply good. The price of 9-10 dollars a bomber, however, is not justified, in my opinion. Much better RIS's out there."
"Good, but very thick and heavy with nothing to distinguish itself as a top representative of the category."
"D - with the high ABV i dont see myself needing to drink many of these, but am definitely capable of"
"Taste is very good (way better than the Dark Lord I just had)., It's rich and smoother and very mellow. It's super easy to drink for such a big RIS. It's light on the sweetness and really sharp. Awesome beer that's very well balanced."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a slight tan head. The aroma is the biggest let down. I didn't get a real strong aroma at all from it. The taste is quite flat as well in my opinion as there really isn't too much there. Dark roast malt. The mouthfeel is medium. The drinkability is fairly low for me. We had 4 guys splitting a bottle and no one really wanted to finish it off. One thing to say is that the abv is well hidden as it did not seem boozy to me."
"D: This is not as drinkable as Rasputin, but it is pretty damn drinkable. I finished the 22 oz with no complaints."
"Overall, not a very solid RIS imo. The barrel aging helps this beer a lot. This beer is not something I want a lot of. I would rather drink the BA version."
"M: Light (for a RIS) and smooth. Low carbonation (but not flat)."
"Just a little rough around the edges, along with a lot of big bold flavors slow down the consumption of this beer. A warming sipper."
"Drinks phenomenally. Great all around RIS. Recommended."
"This is a great beer. I am going to have to get some more soon! It is also worth noting that the BA version was very different. The whiskey was intense, which was tasty on its own accord, but this beer stands on its own without the barrel aged aspects."
"M/D - Very thick oily mouthfeel that is a bit juicy, in the sense of the way a berry sort of explodes in your mouth after taking a bight. Great beer altogether!"
"Overall a real nice RIS. A touch hot in the flavor but not too off putting. Rather drinkable."
"Drinkability is very good, an awesome RIS that has developed well with some light cellar time, very smooth and satisfying. Great beer."
"Overall, a solid Imperial Oatmeal stout. Glad I got a chance to try this one...now I have an excuse to crack one of my multiple Barrel Aged BORIS!"
"D - This is a big, flavorful beer yet it's still quite easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This 22 ounce bottle is the perfect amount for me...I think. I could probably drink a couple if I had the time, and money, but I would rather not judge imperial stouts on drinkability. In my opinion, if you can drink a bottle (whatever size) of this style of beer without getting alcohol poisoning, it's drinkable."
"D-High abv obviously makes it a sipper. Fairly smooth though, and could probably do two of these bombers on a Saturday night."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"D= 4.5 this is one of those really rare beers that you could drink everyday for your entire life and not get tired of it. Great beer and it holds a flame against some of the greats, but is shadowed by its big brother the bourbon barrel Boris which is a life beer."
"D: Right now, it is about 30 degrees F outside and the beer has warmed me up very nicely. Great beer overall!"
"D: Warming and smooth. Very nice beer on a cold winter night."
"Hoppin' Frog's Boris the Crusher beer was all that it was said to be. But it was very expensive and very hard to find. I got lucky and found a store on Addison St. in the Wrigleyville Chicago area that carried it. The hunt was worth the time and the effort. Great Beer!"
"D: it is not as high as others i have had but is still up there."
"I quite enjoyed this, and would definitely have it again; I found it to be a particularly good example of an imperial stout which has those rich coffee and chocolate flavors and scents, but presents them more subtly than would a specifically coffee or chocolate stout. It is an ideal dessert beer, rich and delicious."
"The beer goes down smooth, as one would expect from an Oatmeal imperial (though it's not as smooth as the Stone version that I had the previous day). Mouthfeel is medium for the style, with carbonation a bit high. A very nice RIS overall that I'd be happy to have again, though it might not be my first choice if I could choose any stout in the world."
"D: not as easy to drink as, say, Oat from Southern Tier, but a bit above average on the whole. A thoroughly enjoyable drink!"
"D - I would order this regularly, but only one a night."
"Pretty damn expensive, but worth the price tag, especially on tap"
"A+ beer."
"D- This brew is packed with a lot of BIG flavor and this hybrid seems to line up better with the coffee imperial stouts than the IRS's- though this brew does contain some distinctive IRS character. The ABV is pretty well hidden under the big flavor of this brew. It is a good imperial stout overall and I like the idea of an IRS/oatmeal hybrid. Optimally, for me this brew would have a little bit less roasted malt character and more balance. The ABV is pretty well hidden under the big flavor of this brew."
"A very drinkable beer. The ABV is well hidden in the complex flavors. Super example of the style!"
"I have passed this beer up on so many occasions,not today.Poured into a snifter a jet black,I mean black as an oil slick,a deep mocha colored head atop.A mix of druit and bitter chocolate in the nose,sweet alcohol comes thru as it warms,even a hint of roasted nut,very nice.Flavors are big and sweeter with molasses and alcohol dipped dark fruit taking center stage,a nice bitter chocolate and raw earthiness comes in late making it just well rounded.A beer worth the hype,its everything that I was was hoping for."
"D: Enjoying right now. Wondering how it compares The Dark Lord in the basement"
"Over all I was very impressed with this brew and would you should definately crack it now. i would love to see what happens in a year or two as well. A very decent example of an imperial oatmeal stout, actually it might be one of the only ones I've had."
"D: Good stout offering from Hoppin' Frog. BA'd is next."
"D-this is actually a very drinkable RIS. the booze shows up but not too much at all. it is so smooth and the lighter body actually works with the lighter flavors. not a huge beast i fall in love with but still quite tasty!"
"So incredibly easy to drink. It basically pours itself down your throat. Rich and sweet enough to practically be a dessert. I would drink this once a week if I could."
"D-A very drinkable and solid stout, not as good as some of the best, but one of the better ones out there. Get Ye some...."
"M/D: Thick and syrupy with only slight carbonation. Finish is dry and lingering. Thick and a bit too boozy even after a year, I would put this away for a little longer next time."
"D: Alcohol content makes this one tough to drink a great deal but I enjoy it more than most."
"For a beer of its size, it goes down easily. The only real limiting factor I find is the chocolatey sweetness. I don't know that this is my absolute favorite RIS, but it's certainly distinctive enough to warrant seeking it out."
"This is liquid desert. I cannot wait to give the BA version a go."
"Pours black from my bomber to a pint glass.The head dissipates quickly some light lace remains,lots of roasted malt coffee and oatmeal,reminds me of a bowl of oatmeal with tons of brown sugar,nice alcohol finish,but not at all overpowering,highly drinkable,solid RIS"
"D: Very drinkable, I didn't even feel the alcohol, all of the flavors blended together and with that classic oatmeal stout mouthfeel, it was easy going down. Too bad I only had 1 bomber!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Prickly on the tip of the tongue, the bubbles pull back immediately and spread out, laying a large canvas for the rich flavors to unfurl in the mouth. This is a huge, complex, immaculate example of a RIS that must be experienced at least once."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable brew for the abv. Would recommend and drink again."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable, despite sweetness and fairly high abv. Pretty tasty. Reminds me of Ten FIDY from oskar blues quite a bit."
"drinkability: possilbly an unfiar assestment. I will try again. I have another bottle for later."
"Pours black with a small brown head. The aroma is roasted malt, dark fruit (figs) and milk chocolate. Overall, a little less aroma than I expected. The flavor is roasted, almost burnt malt, as well as some coffee and chocolate. You get a little bit of vanilla as well as some bitterness at the end of the taste. Very creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Overall this beer was an excellent Oatmeal Imperial Stout that was a pleasure to drink. I must say that if given the option to choose either this of the BA version, I would have to give the slight edge to the BA based upon a slightly more complex flavor profile. By itself though, this is another exceptional offering from Hoppin' Frog and thanks again to Jared for this one. Highly Recommended."
"Pours an impressive opaque black with very dark brown edges, but virtually non-existent head at proper temp w/ aggressive pour. Smell: dark chocolate, plum, roasty with a little coffee and burnt characteristics, earthy hops, whiff of wood smoke. Taste: upfront it's big time dark chocolate and prune juice, followed by roasted with a slight coffee and borderline burnt flavors (black malt), decently hopped too: citrus, earthy. Mouthfeel: a nice mix of syrupy and creamy, turns out there was just enough carbonation despite the lack of head... not quite as full as I'd expect though. Very enjoyable and easy drinking without a hint of booze. Thanks to Hoppin' Frog for coming to FL!"
"D: This is what a RIS should be. I found this easy to get through a bomber, but that's probably where I'd stop as the ABV caught up to me at the end. Sip and enjoy. I'll be looking to pick up another bottle to age"
"Pours an opaque black color topped with a thin and lacy brown head. From the head flows a deep dark chocolate and roasted coffee aroma. The viscous body with low carbonation is a velvety drink. It is sweet with tastes of coffee and chocolate. The sweetness and chocolate become emphasized in the finish which fades gracefully with just a touch of warming alcohol at the end."
"This was one big, bad stout. This was a fresh one so it was a bit hot and boozy. But I think with a year or so on this one it will be amazing."
"what can you say about this beer? well except sit down when you drink it. it was a cold winter night in between whiffle ball innings, and me and a buddy decided to split this epic brew. smells of burnt marshmallows and roasty dark chocolate. can't wait to try the bourbon barrel."
"Without any barrel-aging voodoo, this developed a really complex aroma and flavor. I would like to enjoy this beer again someday. One of the better examples of the style that I have had."
"D/ if you like whiskey you like this beer good imperial stout a winter warmer."
"Taste is really strong. Medium body (not as thick as I expected) and there is a strong alvalache of roast flavor in the back of the mouth. Strong coffee taste almost makes the beer crunchy. I can taste the alcohol (I believe this was bottled in 2009 but I can't say for sure). Overall its a very big stout. Strong and flavorful. Its all a little much to take in at once. I did enjoy this beer. The flavors skew toward the sweet as the beer warms."
"All in all, this brew was a pleasant surprise. I'm very happy I got to try this brew. This is an awesome example of a stout for people looking for the best of the genre that is easily attainable. Highly recommended!"
"This beer pours a thick and deep black with a brown head. I definitely pick up notes of chocolate and coffee, some roasted malt, and with hints of alcohol. I can taste the coffee and alcohol, but I can also pick up a little hop at the end. It is a nice Imperial with good balance."
"D - I think even addressing whether I would drink this one again is a ridiculous question. I love that this RIS downplays the hop bite and instead really focuses on providing a complex profile of maltiness. An absolute treasure."
"This one has been pushed towards the back of the fridge (where it's been for about half a year) so I thought I would bust it out and review for my one year anniversary of being on beer advocate. Into a pint glass it pours pitch black with a small dark tan head. The head fades to almost nothing but it slightly there. No lacing to be found. The smell right off is really chocolatey followed by some roasted malts. There is also a small hint of coffee buried underneath as well. For the taste it's mainly chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee followed by alcohol. There is another underlying taste I can't quiet put my finger on, maybe it's the oats. A nice thick creamy mouthfeel. A bit higher ABV on this one which usually isn't noticeable to me but on this one it is though it still isn't a problem at least it's nice on this cold night. And I could do another bomber afterward if I had one. Overall it's really good. My first beer from Hoppin Frog and one of my favorite styles. I'll probably pick another bomber of this up sometime soon."
"drinkability - very good yet high priced might get one a year"
"Drinkability is good and the abv is well hidden. Very tasty stout that I enjoyed."
"Black as night with a pretty modest brown cover with very little lacing. The aroma brings a malty coffee marriage of sweet and bitter. There's a hamlike quality as well, mellow and meaty. The first sip is an intense licorice rhubarb and malt with coffee bean bitterness. Not really getting a lot of oatmeal, more winelike with pretty notable alcohol but not bad. Seems to go very well with cheese but I wouldn't call this a classic session brew. However, it is a flavorful stout, pretty heavy duty feel and a bit of a meal. Generally nice when in the mood for something to sink your teeth into."
"Not a standard-setting RIS by a long shot, but good. All around reminds me of a less smoky Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Nowhere near one of the greats, but good and relatively available."
"Drinkability...for what it is it's tastes great but I think too much might kill you. This is a seriously high gravity beer. And perfect for a cold, blustery December night. Except that I have half a bomber to finish. And I'm not sure I can..."
"Bomber aged well over a year. Pours black with a large, thick, nearly charred oak colored head. Decent retention and some lacing left behind after dwindling down to a ring of a fine bubbles around the edge of the glass. Aromas of dark fruits (prunes, figs, raisin) mesh with earthy and herbal tobacco leaves. Layers of roastiness and chocolate liqueur also waft up. The taste brings the same load of succulent dark fruits up front, plus some concord grapes. Some of the herbal and tobacco notes add complexity on the midpalate before the finish brings out a bittersweet cocoa, cookies and biscuits, and some warming and herbal liqueur. Full bodied, slick, with a moderate yet fine carbonation. The taste both intense and outstanding, with remarkable drinkability for such a full flavored brew. One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts on the market, and better than most of the hyped up limited releases."
"I'm fortunate enough to have this at my disposal at all times! A local favorite, and probably one of my all-time favorite brews."
"A delicious, mellow, roasted treat. Not much of a head on the black brown opaque fluid. What there is is tight and firm, dark tan in color. Smell is roasty and sweet with malt and oats, chocolate and toasted coconut. A superb light banana like fruitiness. Taste is full of mocha and mild chocolate. Coffee bitterness fuses with roasted oats to form a rich luxurious bed for the sweeter flavors to play out. Caramel and burnt sugar flow gently underneath. That faint banana again. Finish is smooth and mellow with a firm hop bittering that moves into a delicious dark bready malt lingering. It keeps the coffee and oats on the palate. Feel is full and thick with a superb carbonation that keeps it lively on your tongue. A very easy going sipper. There is no trace of the alcohol and it goes down like a much lighter beer."
"Wow! The first thing you notice is an intense caramelly sweetness that luckily ISN'T marked by diacetyl. It balances with a wonderful roasty oatness that lingers in your mouth with slight coffee notes. I should also mention that the head is a GORGEOUS dark tan."
"M/D- this is some seriously thick stuff. so creamy and delicous. an ample amount of carbonation for the style helps remind you it's a beer. Can't give it perfect scores in the drinkability. this is a BIG stout. one that needs to be sipped. it is deliciou,s though."
"Taste is roasted with notes of chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel is not as bog as I expected. Off course it is a big beer but drinkability is OK. The roasted malt adds a molasses and grainy taste. The big body of this beer inhibits the hops to glow. I can taste a nice US hoppiness. A piney and a little citric taste."
"J"
"Dark brown, almost black with a thick creamy finger of cocoa colored foam that leaves nice lace on the glass. The nose is dark chocolate, dark fruit and anise. The flavors are much like the smell rich chocolatey fudge and black licorice with a touch of citric hop and coffee like bitterness struggling to the surface. The mouthfeel is velvet smooth with mild carbonation. An easy sipping RIS for sure, I dig it."
"Overall impression: Pretty enjoyable. I think it would be improved by replacing some of the chocolate malts with more of the burnt variety to counteract the sweetness and fruitiness a bit."
"Saying it is a lovely Stout is being a bit simple, but we think this review breaks it down enough. Even if you are not big on Stouts give this one a shot."
"Cheers!"
"loved it - cant wait to try the BA version...but will go back to this as a staple RIS many times."
"The beer is perfectly carbonated for the style, the flavors are well balanced and the alcohol is not present at all. This is a great example of a RIS, and I will be seeking it out in the future."
"D: at 9.4% in a 22oz bottle, difficult to have too many of these, but B.O.R.I.S. is incredibly drinkable. a good representation of the RIS style."
"Notes: A treat to have on tap at Fat Head's last night. Bravo!"
"Drinkability: This is wonderful stuff, and I'd love another, but its overpriced, and that may stop me from buying another. Thats a shame."
"Mouthfeel is all full-bodied with low carbonation. This really drinks creamily and smoothly - perfect for a stout. The oatmeal really adds a nice dimension of chewiness that I always look for in imperial stouts. Drinkability is very high, albeit slow. Definitely suitable for the cold weather and a winter warmer. I was very happy to be able to find this beer and it didn't let me down. Well worth the money."
"D - This is a very easy to drink RIS abv is well hidden and has a good taste make this a beer thats worth getting your hands on"
"nose has alot of dark fruit,milk and dark chocolate,coffee.nose is the same,really smooth.good beer.gonna be an every so often beer for me,i'd rather pick up a more affordable RIS."
"Pours a deep dark black with very little head. Smell is a complex blend - chocolate covered cherrys (chocolate, cherry and cream), coffee, prune, raisin, vanilla, anise, smoke. Taste follows smell with a robust chocolate and fruity flavor (above mentioned cherry, prune, raisin). Background has vanilla, anise, herbal notes, hints of earth and wood. Nice resiny piney hop flavor in the back end. Slightly noticeable booze. Would have enjoyed a more robust malt presence, or tuned down fruit and herbalness. Full bodied yet smooth, oily and coating, warming, decent carbonation. Very good RIS which sits on the bold and assertive side of complex, some of the malt charachter does get lost in the shuffle."
"Nothing special in the look but it was average for a good beer. Black with a darker beige head. Nose suggested oatmeal stout right away with sweet vanilla and oats mixed with chocolate. Some bitterness in the taste, becomes more creamy and mellows as it warms. Does not remind me of a Russian Imperial Stout, but an Oatmeal Imperial Stout. Lot's of oatmeal in this with some mild vanilla bean. Very sweet beer with slight booze in the finish."
"Awesome beer! Loved every sip of it and regret splitting it with a friend."
"MF&D - the feel for an ris is perfect, it is just as thick as it can be without infringing onto american double territory. this is a most good feelign brew, but the flavours could be honed a bit."
"D- Overall, BORIS is a good RIS that is definitely worth a try but there are many others that I would choose over this one."
"Cheers!!!"
"For such a highly acclaimed beverage, I'm disappointed. Maybe my Southern style sorely swings with Hoppin' Frog, but I've yet to really love one. All I've had come in big ol' bottles and, understandably, you expect more from those. I'm glad I tried it only to know it, but I will not be selecting another."
"This is a complex RIS with the interesting hoppiness and crispness. It is a bit more burnt/bitter than I expected, but that helped completely cover the ABV."
"D - This was a great example of a great, big Oatmeal Imperial Stout, not as good as the Oak Aged Yeti, but close"
"This brew is about as drinkable as you can get for the style and the 9.4% ABV. This is a very very good beer."
"Pitch black pour with small but dense tawny head. Smells of molasses sweetness and alcohol with slight toasty smell behind and the faintest hop character underneath. Strong alcohol and treacly tang on the front of tongue. Almost lactose sweetness throughout. Sweetness fades to soft toasted flavors on the back of tongue and through the mouth. Alcohol warmth lingers in throat. Medium bodied with little lacing. A solid Imperial stout, though a bit raisiny to be a personal favorite."
"D - Freakin' delicious. Every sip and every quaff is different and unique. Just about the perfect brew to sip slowly with some Chopin playing in the background. Beers as big, bold, and stout (no pun intended) as this deserve to be enjoyed on their own - so I'll offer no food pairings this time. This brew is absolutely worth the hype that it gets in the craft beer community!"
"D - After all I have heard about it, I am surprised to find myself a bit disappointed in this one. The sweetness is excessive and overwhelming and really sticks on the palate in an unpleasant way. The flavor itself is nice, but lacks in roast character or even chocolate, instead relying on fruity caramel notes that are, admittedly, fairly enjoyable, if a bit out of character. I hate to complain about a beer being out of style, since nitpicking style guidelines really misses the point of enjoying beer, but for what it is worth this strikes me as closer to a Baltic porter than an Imperial Stout. Whatever you want to call it, this is cloyingly sweet and hard to drink and it doesn't quite have the complexity to make up for what it lacks in drinkability. It is a good beer, but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype. Worth a try, but I probably won't be coming back to it in the future."
"5.0 D: One hell of a brew. I could easily put down a few of these since it's really flavorful, but have no off flavors at all."
"This is the third of three Hoppin' Frog beers I bought, seeing as they are new in Florida. My overall opinion is their beers are way overpriced."
"Drinkability: This beer straddles the line between drinkably sweet and overly sweet. The toasted grains and oats balance the sweetness nicely, and the hop addition helps as well. This is a quality beer, and I'm really glad I got the chance to try this hearty brew!"
"D: My first Hoppin' Frog brew and I was very pleased with the brew, a good bday choice. My only complaint is that it was a bit too sweet and lacked a good of balance with the hops. Still this was a rock solid brew and a yummmy RIS. If you're looking for something original try this one, but to be honest, there's probably better RIS's more easily available."
"I'll finish this, but I won't have another. For those who like cherry and licorice flavors, or like your RISes on the sweet end, this might be worth a try. For those who prefer roastier, more bitter RISes, find a beer-loving friend to taste this with if you simply must try it."
"D: A damn fine beer, and I cannot wait to taste it's barrel aged brother."
"it was good. a very special, rich, fulll, tasty mf beer. Pat, Roger, Tim said mmm mm good. Got this bottle at Sam's in Chi a few months ago. Poured with a tan head and some lace. Color was an opaque black. Aroma was chocolate, roasted malt, toffee, dark ripe fruit, toffee. good. Body is nice with good carbonation. Finsih was easy. Not really a session beer tho."
"D - The ABV is very well hidden, and the mouthfeel is superb. Combined with the more than adequete flavor this is an excellent, and fairly easy to obtain, RIS. Just watch out for the mounting bitterness!"
"This is a great Imperial Oatmeal stout and far better than the -bal aged version. Highly recommended."
"D - beer orgasm. let me rest and I'll have another. be gentle with me. In a recent forum, someone asked what was the last beer that wowed you. This is it!"
"This beer was received from BA alleykatking as part of BIF Race 2009. I chose a Duvel Tulip for pouring this into, and the beer was a little bit more carbonated than I had anticipated, which resulted in some fizzy noise, and a two finger thick head atop the pitch black body. The smell was sweet and malty with not a lot of coffee or roast grains. The taste followed the smell closely as well, with berry like sweetness and alcohol warmth, and not a lot of astringency. I liked how the oats added smoothness to the mouthfeel. This was possibly one of the most approachable RIS style beers I have sampled, that was not dumbed down for the sake of drinkability. Good stuff."
"D- For the price and availability (in Ohio) this is one great RIS. Full flavored and highly drinkable."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is a little lower due to the viscosity and ABV. Overall BORIS is a good Impy Stout. The sourness I got in the middle I could do without, but all in all this is a fine beer. Skal."
"Smooth imperial stout without much complexity."
"This was an excellent RIS. I'll probably leave the other one in the cellar for awhile and see waht happens."
"This one has been down in the cellar for a little over a year. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. B.O.R.I.S. appears an opaque deep brown color with at least two fingers of creamy ecru colored foam. Flavors and aromas are dominated by notes of bittersweet and milk chocolates, dark roasted grain, plenty of sweet malt, mocha, earthy and the slightest wisp of smoke. Quite smooth, as most oatmeal stouts are, with a rich body. Alcohol is still present, but not overpowering. A very satisfying stout."
"It's got all of the features I like in an Imperial Stout, coffee, chocolate, maltyness, a balanced hop character. And nothing is overwhelming; all of the different aspects of the beer are in harmony with each other and create a delicious brew. Great mouthfeel and wonderful drinkability. This beer kicks butt."
"D: This is a really good stout. Heavy and fat in character, yet surprisingly easy to drink. Complex and balanced - in short, very tasty."
"Holy $#!% is all I can say. What a great beer! And the price is reasonable, too! This is way better than many beers I've paid twice as much for. This is definitely getting a spot in the regular rotation."
"It pours with the absence of all light with very little head, vigorous pour (who cares). The aroma was not overpowering, of choco-coffee. As for taste, I rate it a bit ahead of Speedway stout, chocolate, coffee (not overwelming), and don't ask me where this comes from, but I'm getting grapes too. Someone mentioned that it looks like motor oil... well it feels that way too. Overall, top-notch. I will buy, share and drink again."
"No style can compete with the smoothness of an oatmeal stout, even if it's an imperial/double version. The velvet characteristics show well, mixed with assertive hops and a strong malt presence. Complex. Recommended."
"D: I am thoroughly enjoying this beer, and glad I have another bottle in the cellar along with the BA version"
"The flavour on this stout is great, as is the aroma which announces it, but I can't help but be somewhat disappointed by the lighter than hoped for body and the complete lack of head."
"I am impressed with the flavors but, in light of other world-class stouts, it can't quite compare. The body lets it down and it seems a little more raw, though just as complex. A very nice stout. Thanks Rob!"
"Drinkability: This is one of the finer stouts that I have had the privilege of drinking. Robust in flavor, yet smooth in texture. This is one tasty beer that I will look forward to drinking again. Cheers!"
"Pours just perfect - nice and gooey, big poofey tan head with sweet lacing left in its wake. Smells chocolatey, lightly toasted without being a full-on roast bomb. Not much taste of oats in this one, but it is still a full-bodied, smooth imperial stout. Very chocolatey, lightly roasted, and pretty low on bitterness. No massive overhopping, which I love. A hint of coffee, but nowhere near prominent. Big thick mouthfeel, this is one you can still taste long after it is gone. A pretty well balanced package, flavor and drinkability. I'll have to remember this one."
"there is some alcohol fruitiness and sweetness, but very drinkable for such a big beer."
"D - I found this to be a rather enjoyable stout. Alcohol is hidden for the most part. I wouldn't be inclined to drink more than one at a time, but it certainly makes for a killer after work treat."
"D- A good session beer. It did give me the burps a little, but it was geat otherwise."
"Would drink again and recommend."
"Good stuff - hope to sample the barrel aged at some point"
"D: I am quoted $10 for this in trades. I don't really feel a bomber is worth that price, but this is a pretty decent stout and I'm happy to have had it."
"D - Balanced, good drinking."
"The taste is very complex with a ligtht chocolate taste on the front end and black coffee bitter strong finish. I think its a little too bitter for my liking."
"Very good beer. Turning into one of my favorite styles!"
"Very drinkable and a beer that totally hides the ABV. I do like this beer, but don't rate it amongst my favorite Imperial Stouts. While good, not worth twice as much as a Stone Russian Imperial."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, melds with the flavor impressively well. I could drink this all night, delicious sipper that I have to pull myself away from to avoid supreme inebriation. Damn fine beverage."
"Poured from a bomber acquired from Halftime Bev. in Poughkeepsie months ago (other HF still available, not this one), I poured it into a pint glass that I have no idea where the hell it came from (Coors Light and NYGiants logo??!!?) thick and dark, thin brown lacing that quickly disappears, smells of I dont know? smoked licorice? Similiar in nose to Old Rasputin, and tastes similiar as well. A bit oily, but overall an outstanding beer, and any fan of the style must try one."
"Drinkability: the sticker on the bottle says its a GABF Gold Medal winner 2008 for Imperial Stouts. it certainly deserves the prize cause this beer is awesome."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is slightly prickly. Body could be a little smoother I think. Drinkability is about as good as it gets for what is a huge, in your face beer. The alcohol character, although welcome, does hinder the drinkability at times. Overall, a fantastic beer."
"Poured a lovely black in to the glass with a pretty good head formation. Being that this brew is an oatmeal RIS I honestly did not expect big flavors or aromas...I was happily wrong. The aroma is the first thing that tiped me off, Big waves of roasted coffee comes powering threw with chocolate in the background. Flavors are very strong in this brew again with the Coffee, chocolate and I would have to say mollasses. Brew is very smooth with very little alcohol coming threw, but that amount helped push the other flavors threw very well. Afterwards this big brew hit's the spot and does not leave you feeling woopy. Great brew that I will pick up when I come accross it in my travels."
"Not an especially domineering brew, despite the name. Nicely balanced, quite strong breakfast stout, though lacking some complexity or intensity (of flavors) for the style. Still, a very enjoyable beer overall, worth seeking out."
"Another beer from my Chicago haul. A tasty imperial stout, it was nice that the booze in the smell was well hidden in the taste. Definitely worth the purchase."
"Overall a superior RIS."
"Pours a super dark black color with brown coming through the edges. It has a big brown head that leaves good stick lace. The nose is mainly of molasses and it has less burrnt and roasted characters than I expect with RIS's. The taste has a nice higly roasted and burnt fla or to it. Very to style. Very creamy, which I suppose is from the oatmeal. Heavy body. Finished sweet with lingering roastiness. It doesn't taste too young...I wonder how age would affect this beer."
"The only problem with this beer is that for $1 more I can get a six pack of Siberian Night."
"D- Very smooth, complex and rich."
"22oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass a nice opaque black with a thin tan quickly diminishing head. Aroma is loads of bitter cocoa and roasted malts. The taste is a nice blend of cocoa and roasted malts with hints of espresso and molasses. The beer is fairly heavy bodied with plenty of warming alcohol. This is an enjoyable Imperial Stout, but there are better ones out there."
"Dark stout with a creamy beige head, minimal retention. Smooth, easy mouthfeel. Nose of coffee, chocolate and toffee..One of the better stouts available out there. Just the creamiest, smoothest stouts to enjoy. Taste is so similar to the nose, roasted coffee, warn=m chocolate and a touch of toffee. Highly recommend this pretty stout!"
"wow... talk about overrated... or maybe it's just this batch. i remember this from a tasting a couple years back, and it definitely wasn't like this..."
"Beers like this is the reason I love Imperial Stouts. It is big in flavor, body, and aroma. This gets my highest recommendation and is worth seeking out. Great Stuff."
"Overall, a ridiculously tasty adult beverage. Seemed subdued at first, but I have a tendency to rush it. Once I gave it a little room to breathe, it warmed up to me in a hurry. It's like they took all the best parts of all the stout styles, and combined them into one ultimate bizarro stout. The only thing missing are some oysters! Big thank you to BA user tburkhart for helping me get ahold of this tasty Eurasian amphibian. Cheers!"
"An excellent stout worth checking out!"
"Bottle Pours a deep black with a decent tan head. The head lasts well and laces nicely. Has a great aroma of chocolate, coffee, alcohol, and malts. Has a light carbonation. The flavor is very good. The alcohol is very hidden. Blending is excellent. Has a hearty flavor of chocolate and malts. This is a thick beer that sicke to the ribs. Has a full body. The finish is very good and the aftertaste lingers for full apriciation of this beer. Very well done."
"22oz bomber from the Liquor Shoppe in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours an opaque black body with a thin film of tan head. Dark chocolate, coffee, dates, a touch of vanilla. Dark chocolate, coffee, burnt malt, caramel, some oatmeal. Full-bodied with moderate carbonation. While it's definitely a sipper, one sip definitely invites another and this beer was gone way too soon. Phenomenal. One of the best big stouts I've ever had. Awesome."
"Pours nearly opaque black into pint glass, with minimal tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smell is tasty, with burnt grain, oatmeal and slight coffee hints. Taste is very good, with the oatmeal coming through strongly and syrupy. I also taste chocolate and a little booze. Feels very nice in the mouth, thick and well carbonated. A little heavy to be really drinkable, a trait that is signature in RISs, but tremendously so for the style. Would purchase much of if it were consistently available."
"D - Certainly not a beer I'd ever turn down! Just wish it was easier to obtain.Even with the higher abv. its pretty easy to sip away. I almost feel guilty cuz this beer is too much fun."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability- Okay, I know that my review probably didn't sound like a ringing endorsement but I've had this beer so many times that I know it's good. I think I'm just picking out the faults. It's so tasty and so solid I appreciate every drop of this I've ever tasted. Great beer by a damn fine brewery. A must try."
"This is tasty but not that great. I still prefer other RIS which have more flavor."
"Drinkability: This is one of my favorites in the style. The taste is awesome. It is like eating a big delicious cookie. I will search for this again and would gladly have several if not for the high abv"
"Mouthfeel has the classic oatmeal stout silkyness, light but full bodied."
"Poured black with not much head and no lacing. Smell and taste were dark fruits and a good roastiness to balance the sweetness, and a hop finish. Velvety smooth on the mouth with perfect carbonation levels. A bomber of this would be perfect for a night of sipping. Great beer."
"Excellent brew. I'll find this one again!"
"B.O.R.I.S. is a killer name for a Russian Imperial stout. Too bad the beer itself can't stand toe-to-toe with the greats. It's still worth a purchase and I will still buy a bomber or two whenever I make it back to the Buckeye State."
"Tasty beer, very drinkable. Seek this one out."
"It's about right in the mouth and I suppose I'd drink another if given one but I won't seek it out."
"Felt thick and earthy in the mouth, but it was pleasant to drink and my pint glass emptied rather quick."
"Served in a snifter. Opaque black with a thin caramel-beige head and collar. Rich malt aroma with notes of molasses, coffee, alcohol, and sweet cocoa. Full bodied with a rich, heavy texture, smooth and creamy. Very low carbonation. Big flavours - bitter, roasty, bittersweet chocolate, roast coffee, low esters. Some baked raisin with molasses (Boston brown bread) but not sweet, and a nutty note (pecan?). Awesome! Alcohol is noticeable but not hot. Bits of foam remain on the glass at the finish. Substantial and satisfying beer."
"The mouthfeel's thick, like most RIS. I have yet to experience the oily slickness that so many attribute to oatmeal stouts -- might be there, but I just don't recognize it. Bottom line: this is deliciious & I want more."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and rather heavy. Quite a chewy drinking experience that is rather filling. A bit stout through and through that is smoothed out by the oats. A damn tasty beer here I'm glad I was able to try."
"I've been wanting to try this for awhile now. I was so excited to get it that I had to immediately review it. I poured into a Bud Light Cleveland Caveliers glass to a brown head with very little carbonation. The chocolate and bready, roasted malts come to the forefront. It tastes great. I don't know if it's $9 a bomber great, but great nevertheless. I am a Siberian Night fan but I think this is a nudge better. Being a simple man of humble means I will have to stick with Siberian Night. But someday I will try some Founders Breakfast Stout and curse my meanial job. Oh well, I'm enjoying this for now."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, not too try. A hint of carbonation. Overall it's a nice RIS, but too sweet for my palate. I prefer more roasted, bitter flavors. But that's just me. This fellow is certainly worth a try. If only for the awesome frog on the bottle."
"Vigorous pour of this black oily elixir yields about a centimeter of head that just falls into nothing but a little ring...Smell is chocolaty and boozy. Chocolaty taste as well, like a boozy gouache or a heavy dark chocolate liquor. Heavy bitter and roasted flavors as well. Slight astringency. Silky, chewy, thick mouthfeel. It really just seems like the thought behind this was something like ""lets see how EXTREME we can make this!!!"" but without much effort to really produce something drinkable. I have been hanging onto this bomber for about a month for a good night to drink it and...disappointed. At the price they are charging, not worth it at all. It will surely get you a hell of a buzz though, since the only option is to buy it in a bomber. Thanks, but at this price point, I will happily stick to my KBS."
"Eh, this beer just never came together for me. Pours soft, thick looking, not much head to speak of despite me trying to build one up. Yes, there is lots of flavor in this beer. Chocolate cake, dark fruits, a touch of coffee maybe, but it never really gets deep. And despite my initial impression on the pour this beer doesn't really have a lot of body to it to hold everything together. At times it kind of tasted like flavored sugar water, unfortunately. Was hoping for more but this just seemed like a confused beer to me."
"Flavor is quite good. I thought I was going to be disappointed by this beer but was not. Coffee and oats. Some chocolate. Light spruce-ness to balance out the sweet. Body is a bit of a downer. I thought it'd be thicker after seeing it pour. A tad thinner than I thought it was going to be and what I was hoping for. Still a good beer altogether."
"D. Well balanced stout. Highly drinkable for almost 10%"
"Pours black with little head. The lacing dissipates quickly, seeming flat. The smell is a nice mixture of fruit and roasted coffee. The taste starts off of dark chocolate and espresso, then turns more nutty and fruity - i get hints of almond and raisins. The mouthfeel is superb, very thick and delicious with mellow carbonation. It finishes smooth, with a little hop bitterness and warmth from the alcohol. Overall, a very nice imperial stout - but amidst so much hype, it fell a little short."
"Seek this beer out if you enjoy big stouts. You will not be disappointed."
"Overall a very good beer that I am glad I got to try."
"The bottom of my glass came all too soon, and I felt ""crushed""...sorry. Great brew, look foward to future Hoppin Frog brews. Prost!"
"Overall a very good RIS not as big or complex as some I have had but makes up for it in drinkability and mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Absolutely phenomenal beer. This is an RIS I will absolutely seek out again. Incredibly smooth, yet very well balanced. Obviously a sipper, and it's so thick and chewy it can be tough to finish a bottle. This is the epitome of a dessert beer, and one best shared with friends."
"Gets to just about one finger of thick brown cream, full mixture of bubble sizes, above average lacing, more sheets than sticky streaks. Pitch black, no real color to the liquid, of course completely opaque. Black licorice, creamed coffee, hazelnuts, bittersweet dark chocolate, black grape to raisin, cherry fruit scents, caramelized brown sugar, very dense thus hard to really get full effect, witch hazel and spiced oatmeal break the surface before it's all gone. Full-bodied is not quite adequate, it's a damn brick in the mouth, you almost feel like you have to spoon it into your mouth and then swallow hard to get it down. Heavy roast to the coffee, chocolate flavors, caramel and brown sugar too, still too heavy to truly be as sweet as it should be. Grape, cherry, plum fruit flavors only flirt with dried fruit characteristics. The carbonation is near unnoticeable. The licorice comes out at the finish along with a bit of floral mist and mint. Dry, concentrated and obviously built to ""crush," however, even a 22oz bomber is somewhat tiring to finish."
"drinkability - Easy drinking, one of the best RIS i have had. wish to have it again."
"Overall: Very drinkable for style and ABV, flavors really develop as it warms, nice subtle flavors, very nice mouthfeel that keeps me wanting more."
"Alcohol is almost non-existent and this is highly drinkable."
"D: Oh, yes sir this is a really damned good Imperial Oatmeal Stout. I had to get past that look that really had me worried, but it more than delights in everyother category. This brew is smooth and easy drinking, and for such a big beer, it actually doesn't sit too heavy. I could easily entertain another bomber of this tonight. That aroma, taste, and feel are worth killing for. If you have the chance, get some. Do whatever it takes."
"Overall, a little disappointing given the extreme hype on this website around this beer."
"D: Overall drinkability was good, a beer that was certainly big on style and substance, one that deserves to be sipped and savored. Boozy, thick and viscose one should be enough to satisfy. The beer does get progressively smoother to drink while the alcohol is quite noticeable upon warming."
"D: A great sipper. Another that gets pretty nice as it warms."
"This was a big beer and did not disappoint me, it had a ton of different bold flavors going on and it was definitely worth drinking. This is a brew I will only be drinking from time to time and not on a regular basis."
"The mouthfeel is almost the best part of the ale. Full and velvety. Absolutely one of the best Imperial Oatmeat Stouts I have ever drank. Than you Hoppin' Frog."
"Overall: The mouth feel is rich and creamy. The body is super thick, need to cut it with a butter knife. The finish is medium full. Okay, this beer has a hell of a wallop. There is some serious flavors in this beer. The oatmeal lends to a nice creamy mouth feel. They say it is an Oatmeal Imperial Stout, and BA says it is a RIS. I think that it is a cross. The hops it not very present in the beer, I think that it was intended that way. This is a great and a seriously full body beer not for the faint of heart. I loved it."
"Appearance is where this beer lacked as it poured with no head! I tried to finish the pour vigorously but that did nothing. Body was super dark black. Aroma was of malts and oats. Flavor is full of oatmeal, chocolate and malty goodness. Probably the richest oatmeal stout i have had to date.This is super smooth and thick to the mouth."
"Drinkability - This one had potential for being an outstanding RIS. The oatmeal addition seemed to smooth over the frequent rough edges present in many RIS's. I can see why it did well (i.e. Gold medal) at the 2008 G.A.B.F. Yep, I'll put this in my RIS rotation."
"Bottle at 52 F. Poured a black color with an average creamy brown head that mostly lasted and produced good lacing. Moderate roasted chocolate aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture. Good complex roasted flavor with a medium burnt bittersweet finish of long duration. Good complex brew."
"Very nice beer. Let this one warm before drinking."
"Final thoughts: A few months ago when this beer first hit NJ I wasn't sure if this was worth aging and I'm still not sure. It's capable of going the long haul but I'm not sure if it is worth the wait. Whatever you choose this beer is very yummy."
"Overall this beer definitely delivered on the mouthfeel, but I was a bit let down in the aroma and flavor departments - though I must say my expectations were high. Certainly worth a shot for you to judge for yourself."
"D - Quite the memorable Oatmeal Stout... Impressive in all facets... Hides the 9.4% ABV well, which could be dangerous... Goes down very easy... I would highly recommend and seek out again in the future..."
"Drinkability- Despite the high 9.4 ABV, i'd say drinkability is moderately high. This is one extremely well-balanced stout that i'll definitely pick up again."
"Extremely drinkable, I will track this one down again."
"Personally, I wish this was a bit lighter on the alcohol. It feels stronger than 9.40%, but I don't consider it a knock on the beer. It's a personal preference and looking at the bigger picture, Hoppin' Frog has something good here. I'd love to try their other offerings, even though if I have another RIS again, it's pretty unlikely that I'd reach for this. Not an easy choice with so many stellar choices out there!"
"D: This one is a bit of a sipper due to its thickness and full body. However, there are many RIS beers that are much more aggressive than this one. For the style, its an easy drinker."
"D: yum yum yum. But for me, the taste is too sweet to have more than, say, two of these, despite the more complex/rounded nature implied in the nose. Fans of this style will find a real winner here."
"Notes - As good as was billed."
"The drink is creamy, silky, and full-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation to lighten things up a bit. Quite delicious and very drinkable for style."
"Drinkability is suprisingly high. Good flavor profiles and well concealed alcohol make for a pretty damn good stout."
"Pours pitch black with a thin, maybe a cm or so, brown head, which leaves a little lacing here and there. Looks pretty standard for the style. The smell seems to be overpowered with alcohol, with a bid of roastiness. Kind of like bad coffee, mixed in with the smell of black patent malt. Not a bad smell, but seems a bit harsh for an oatmeal stout. I kind of expected to smell more sweetness. The taste is much better than the smell suggests. There's immediately the oatmeal taste, I mean not like a bowl of oatmeal, but like beer oatmeal, if you know the taste. The taste kind of has the old, low quality coffee taste from the smell, which I guess comes from a low dose of roasted barley. I would like to taste a bit more. I can also notice this oiliness, which I think comes from black patent malt, which is pleasant in low doses. I can also get this chocolate taste, kind of toned down, but I think its at the right level with the oatmeal added. If I could make any suggestions, it would be to substitute some roast barley for the black patent, and I'll hold off a higher rating for that. The mouthfeel, as you would expect from an oatmeal stout, is spot on. So smooth and creamy. with just the right amount of sweetness. This doesn't even need carbonation, but its delightful. And I'm sure I could drink this for hours. I just kept reaching back, and nothing slowed me down."
"D-Definitely a contemplative sipping beer. Perhaps two huge and warm (alcoholic) for me. I had a Bomber and could not finish it. A smaller amount, sipped slowly from a snifter, paired with a nice cigar might be a delightful combination, though."
"Drinkability: This one is certainly a sipper. While the beer is amazingly flavorful, there might be a little too much going on here; it doesn't meld well. The booze is a little too forward right now, maybe in a year it would be a better drink?"
"For any fans of the style this is a must-try. It definitely places on my (as well as Beer Advocate's) list of top RIS and Double Stouts. Actually, I'm struggling to think of a better, more enjoyable drinking Imperial Stout. It's like a roasty, rich beer with creamy dark chocolate and hop filling. I don't think beers like this can get any better, all hail BORIS!!!"
"Aged 18 months in biegaman's cellar, thanks for sharing. Opaque shiny black with short tan head leaving a ring and wispy, large bubbles on the side surface. Held in a bright light, there are miniscule bubbles shooting up the side of the glass almost invisible to the naked eye in the jet black beer. There is a distinct chocolate smell along with sweet, candied dark fruit and more chocolate, a bit of fresh leather aroma. Taste is rich and nicely blended, ABV hardly noticed, layers of chocolate like a tiramisu dessert with a gentle bitterness and a long lingering, satisfying finish. I imagine that the hops have settled with time and the overall balance is remarkably satisfying, this conjures up memories of the Founders Breakfast Stout I enjoyed a bit over a year ago. Nicely done, an oatmeal imperial stout to savour, thanks again, Jan."
"	I knew I was pretty much up a creek when I bought this bad boy tonight...I picked a bomber off the shelf and asked the clerk if he would recommend it. ""You taking a lunch break"" was his response. When I got it home I popped open the cap and dumped about half of it into my standard tasting glass; a 22 oz. crystal snifter. The head that was created was rich and creamy, like the froth from a freshly stirred glass of chocolate milk. Over the next few minutes it slowly dissipated, but left a thin film of carbonation across the top of the beverage. The color was jet black, the negative of light, absolute darkness. No life was able to penetrate its absolute darkness. The aroma was heavy, loaded with dark roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, and very few hops. Ditto's for the taste. There is such a malty sweetness in the beer that almost all of the hops are cancelled out. I've had very malty beers that were brewed with lager yeast and malty beers brewed with ale yeast, and I can say that I love the ale yeast. It's something about the yeast characteristic that draws me to this ale. Very robust and assertive, unlike a bock which has a like yeast profile and uber malts to back it up. Communism does suck the Almighty Big One, but this beer is truly a grand gift from the Czars."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours jet black with a thin tan head. The nose has coffee, anise and dark chocolate. The flavor is sweet and pleasantly bitter at the same time. Coffee and chocolate notes dominate, the finish is slightly bitter and it lingers. A full creamy mouthfeel makes this sipper very enjoyable."
"22 ounce bottle served in a snifter. Pours Hershey Syrup brown and forms an oily black mass with a cocoa power brown head that faded disappointingly quick. Aroma of chocolate cover black cherries, a ton of fresh dark roasted coffee beans, tobacco spit, and salty and smokey notes. Giant flavor. Very roasted, charcoal, lots cocoa. Big Bitter Bitch. Thick mouthfeel, and leaves a nice oily film on my tongue. Each drink leaves a sticky film on my top lip and my mustache."
"Only improves as it warms, as well. I always get the blues when I think about how I can't get Dark Lord or The Abyss in Jersey... but I'm not sure how much better it gets than this brew."
"Smooth yet chewy mouthfeel. It is a joy to let sit on the tongue. Oh man this is good stuff. This one is staying on the want list. Blipped Soul Crusher by White Zombie for this one."
"A great job from what I hear is a very small brewery in Akron. Well done!!"
"Very high drinkability, the beers starts strong and grows on you throughout the session."
"Serving type: 22oz bottle"
"This is unbelievably enjoyable. I can't remember being so impressed with a RIS since I first tried Old Rasputin. This is terrific; expensive but worth it."
"D - This is a interesting take on an RIS. It really tastes like an oatmeal stout that has been cranked up."
"This poured a beautiful jet black with a nice tan foam halo around the edge. Leaves pretty nice thin lacing around the glass. The nose is of coffee and bitter chocolates. Perhaps a bit of earthy hop to it as well. The taste is bitter coffee and roasted malts. There is a nice soft bitter chocolate taste as well. A minor alcohol whisp while bitter hop and chocolate compunded with a nice smooth creamy oat flavor create a nice finish. Mouthfeel is very nice a creamy. This is defintely a sipper for a cold night. Overall this is pretty damn good. Its not your typical outmeal stout. Its almost more RIS than oat. Whatever it is....its good!"
"Drinkability - St. Ambroise is still the king of the Oatmeal stouts, but if you are looking for something closer to a hopped up version of an RIS with some oatmeal thrown in, you've found your brew."
"After 3/4 of the bomber I realized that I probably wouldn't want more than what was left in the bottle. Drinkability is decent, but nothing to write home about."
"This is a sipping beer and one is enough for me at a single sitting."
"Pours jet black with burnt amber edges when held up to a light. There was a very small, khaki colored head that dissipated very quickly. The smell was average for an imperial stout- creamy milk chocolate and roasted malt, but nothing stood out too much. There was one point in the sip that did have a nice roasted bitterness, but transitioned into an almost cloyingly sweet finish. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy. Drinkability was average. It's a sipper."
"Future outlook: Not a favorite, but it's decent and local-ish, so I'll probably give it another chance sooner or later."
"D: I did enjoy this quite a bit and it would go marvelously with some pancakes/waffles. It overpowered the omelette I had alongside a bit but this is definitely up there in terms of RISs that I have had."
"d: a really nice imperial oatmeal stout; roasted and strong with light hops"
"The hype is deserved, and then some. An awesome brew! The light booze in the aroma is covered in the taste. It has a deceptively drinkable character. A great beer!"
"It's hard to get a big body with this much ABV."
"D: I found it to be pretty drinkable. I can't say that I'll be rushing out for another one of these when I have other favorites that I enjoy more. Piney hops and licorice are two things that don't do it for me. So, it is a nice beer that I would recommend trying but, it wasn't for me."
"Drinkability: very high could easily put them down"
"this brew pours up black with a nice brown head. the nose is oats and roasted malts, a very pungent aroma. the taste is oats, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee. its full bodied, has a sweet finish. Definately a winner..."
"Pour some Hershey's syrup on your oatmeal tomorrow morning!"
"Black/brown pour with ruby tones. Barely present brown bubbles. Roasty aromas of malt, coffee, grains. Initial taste is roast malt, roasted oat and quite a bit of coffee. As it warms it mellows a bit and hits the mocha and port like flavors. Very smooth mouthfeel, not quite creamy. A big beer, full bodied for sure. Not over run with alcohol or bitterness. The oat sets this apart a bit from the typical RIS. If it was available to me other than mail order, would definetely buy again. Would like to see what some age does to this also. May have to make my way through Akron on the way home to Michigan."
"Notes: A great brew from Ohio that I wish were available here in Michigan. I don't know of the price, but I'm sure I'd revisit it from time to time... and one I'll buy on every Toledo beer run."
"D - Good. It's not my favorite RIS, but I'll drink it. I wish it came in smaller bottles however. Putting down 22.9oz of a thick beer doesn't make the stomach feel so great."
"EDIT: When refilling the glass I literally threw the beer into the glass and a nice rich, thick, khaki brown colored cloud formed over the beer and sank slowly. I apologize to BORIS for I don't want him to show up and kick down my door. Really nice coffee frappe (milk shake for non-new Englanders) colored head."
"Needs more carbonation, because it tastes quite flat. It is otherwise a quite tasty brew....and certainly warms you up on a 20F day."
"Overall I was not impressed with Boris from a bottle, just too much coffee flavors that seemed one dimensional to me. But from the tap, wow this is a different beer and so much better. Matt Capone talked me into trying it as I expressed to him that I was not a fan of it from bottle. Boy was I glad he did. Bottom line, from fresh draft this is a top notch impy stout that you should seek out. Still shaking my head how good this was."
"Overall, a really good beer that I highly recommend. Mine was a little hot so looking forward to getting another and aging for 6 months to try again. My first Hoppin' Frog but eager to try some more from them."
"This is worth the $10 price tag. I will definitely be drinking this again."
"HV"
"D- Definitely a nice blend of the smoothness of oats, chocolate accents and the largess of a true RIS."
"the high abv really works for me with this beer"
"D: As soon as you open the bottle, and until the last drop, this is as good as it gets. I'm very lucky to be from the Akron area to have this excellent beer any time. I've had some excellent stouts, but nothing comes close to what this has to offer."
"ours pitch black with a ark chocolate brown head. Beautiful roasty aroma of coffee, toffee, dark chocolate, sugar cane, oatmeal and hazelnut. Flavor has simialr attributes as its aroma. Very malty with lots of oatmeal, chocolate, roasted coffee, toffee, sugar cane, alcohol and caramel. Very smooth with a burnt, bittry dry finish. Amazing!"
"3.7/5"
"D: An awesome, well balanced and flavorful beer. Very drinkable for it's thickness and 9.4% abv. Can't wait to get some more. Glad to see this one in NJ."
"Mouth is viscous but not overwhelmingly so. It is smooth and has a nice thickness that swallows nicely. Good amount of carbonation. It is delicious."
"This is a very good RIS but nothing too unique. Well executed for the style."
"This beer does a decent job of hiding it's 9.4% alcohol. The flavor is well balanced and with the smooth mouthfeel it makes this beer quite drinkable."
"The thickness, booze, and rich chocolate and cherry really make you put the brakes on. This is one to sip and enjoy. With that in mind, this guy is exactly what you are looking for."
"This beer pours black as freakin night! No light is shining through this bad boy. Small sticky brown head with some crazy red highlights to it. Very nice. Coffee, brown sugar sweetened oatmeal and sweet chocolate malt in the nose, standard but very inviting. A big whiff reveals sweet hops and the slightest hint of alcohol that just gets me more interested. This beer has absolutely fantastic body to it. Just chewy enough without becoming cloying and ""heavy", slick and smooth as all hell. The taste is explosive as well. Big blast of chocolate and a pleasant and welcomed nutty-ness begins it right upfront, then some creamy coffee notes and ripe fruits invade next, followed by a slight hop bite and its subtle bitterness balanced by a bready, pie crust like, finish. Wonderful after taste of ripe cherries, smoke and sweet chocolate malts. Fantastic, without a doubt a well made beer. This beer was everything i hoped it would be and more. A 22oz bomber is an ideal serving size for a beer as tasty as this. Dont let the 9.4% ABV scare you this ones a paper tiger when it comes to an alcohol burn. Well done. I hope to try many more from Hoppin' Frog!"
"Thanks to SkinnyElvis for this Halloween '08 treat!"
"Better head and nose on this beer and it would be one of my highest rated beers out there, but the flavor profile to me was awesome and I will be buying this beer again."
"D= I tried this one based solely on the good reviews it has received here on BA and I was not disappointed. Very good and highly drinkable RIS here. Can't wait to get some more!"
"Drinkability: great for flavor but less for the high alcohol levels. One bottle will suffice in a single session."
"Great drinkability I savored every drop from this bomber for brunch. A great way to start of a nice New England fall day"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for the style. Actually I'd say this is one of the most approachable RIS's for a newbie."
"The nose has hints of the addition of cheap fruit syrup and the taste is the same. Too sweet. Am I just not getting it?"
"Poured an opaque black color with a medium sized, tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malts, smoke, and vanilla beans. Taste of more roasted and chocolate malts, dried fruits, cherry, with an alcoholic backbone. This exhibited a creamy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Whew. This one's good. It's chocolately and really wholesome, has a lot of other pleasant notes, and a well-hidden (and not too unreasonable for the style) abv%. The bitter chocolately notes are a little pungent in the mouth, but the nose is out of this world, the mouthfeel great, and everything melds really well. Recommended."
"Great beer, I thoroughly enjoyed this."
"D: Great price for an amazingly well-crafted and solid brew. DON'T judge a beer by it's label, this is a badass brew."
"pour black and thick like cream. opaque with little to no head. would like to see a bit more with this aggressive pour. chocolate milk foam. tight with no lace. smell is malt and molasses. taste has that same backbone. nice bitter hop with a light sweetness all matched with the alcohol and density giving it a liquor candy syrup aspect. sweeter than some but balanced. oat is lightly smoked with a woody nature. great beer... would recommend. really comes through and is consistent as it gets warmer."
"This beer pours very think and dark with little to no head and some lacing. The smell is large with lots of toasted malts and sweetness. The taste threw me for a loop, but it grew on me fast, it had sourness, a large toasted malt base. The flavor that threw me for a loop seemed to be cherries and for a 9.4% abv you get non of it which is nice. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy but the carbonation level seemed a little low, I would love to try this beer on nitro! A very mystifying and drinkable brew that I will come back to now that its available in New York"
"Stoke up the fire & warm up with this bad boy. The oatmeal gives the brew a nice smoothness. Kinda hides some of the ""rough"" characteristics of a big stout."
"Pours jet black with a dark mocha head that dissipates quickly but leaves a little lacing on the way down. Aroma of Coffee roast chocolate and brown sugar. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, dried fruit, a little alcohol. Has a roast bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste forever. The mouthfeel is oily yet creamy as hell. Thick syrupy body, light carbonation. This is a damn fine imperial oatmeal stout, I can't believe it took me so long to try this."
"D- Very nicely done, and easy to drink. I wish this was sold out here in the PNW, I would definately have to buy some."
"Very drinkable. The man knows his stouts."
"Drinkability: This is the most drinkable R.I.S. I've ever encountered. Flavor is complex and subtle, allowing the imbiber to discover different nuances in smell and flavor throughout the session. Normally, I'm more of a punch-you-in-the-face R.I.S. fan, but this was a great change-up. Watch out for the ABV - it has already caught me off-guard!"
"Wow this is a fantastic beer. I did not expect this. Pours black with the darkest brown head I ever saw. Smells cool, refreshing, with lots of chocolate and coffee - fruits underneath too. Taste is phenomenal - very rich chocolate. Taste lingers in the mouth for a while after each sip. Man this beer is thick, syrupy - just how I love my beer. Alcohol is blended well - its hard to tell its as strong as it really is. Man I wish I could get some more of this! My folks were passing by a store near the brewery in Ohio on a trip and new I liked stouts - so they got it, not knowing how good it would be. Highly recommended."
"Overall: unique tasting treasure"
"Had this for dinner last night. Black, labrea tarpit-like appearance. Tons of roasted malt in the smell, as well as the usual coffee and chocolate. Same with the taste, which also includes, as advertised, oatmeal goodness. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy, with light to medium carbonation. I really enjoyed this one."
"A fantastic beer. Up there with the other great RIS I've had the fortune to try, like Stone & Santa's Little Helper"
"Pours a slow/thick black, brownish highlights when held up to light, tiny mocha-colored head rises and fades pretty quickly. So much dark chocolate in the nose, dark fruit notes, and some faint alcohol fumes rising out of the glass. Taste is chocolatey as hell, roasty, some espresso, slightly charred around the edges, slight alcohol burn on the lips. Moutfheel is perfect, creamy, just-right carbonation, and tons of lingering espresso aftertaste. Love this one....B.O.R.I.S. rocks!"
"it pours black and a hard pour gets one finger of dark creamy head. the smell is mild and sweet, almost like a milk stout. medium body that is very smooth and a little creamy. full flavored with a sweetness like coffee and chocolate and the oatmeal gives a nice smoothness to it. the aftertaste is very pleasant of coffee notes."
"D- for a beer with a high abv., this was quite tasty. thoroughly enjoyed my first experience with a RIS."
"Definitely worth a try."
"Recommended..."
"Fuller mouthfeel. This one is one to sip. Enjoyable flavors, and warming alcohol will make this a winter visitor to my fridge. Not exactly something I'd want to chug with burgers, and one big bottle will do it for the night for me."
"Very good stuff. I was hesitant to try it after trying their IPA and being thoroughly disgusted but I finally caved and bought this one up. Glad I did, it's deserving of it's place in the top beers."
"VERY nice beer!"
"Drinkability - A very good beer overall."
"this is as black as satens hart, thick and lushous. i taste sweet carmel notes and strong alcohal in the begining, the middle is one of strong darkley roasted oatmeal and the first hint of hops. the end is nice coffie and pungent floral hops and smooth alcohal. this is a beer that improves as it warms! i need to get more of this one for sure."
"mouth feel is rich and creamy. this beer is incredibly smooth. full bodied. i seriously just cant get enough of this. i would drink this beer again in the drop of a hat. pity is doesn't come out to California. :("
"D - Excellent brew, highly recommended."
"Pours jet black with a small tan head. In the aroma, sweet oatmeall sweetness and a small alcohol note. In the taste, roasty oatmeal sweetness. A smooth and big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry chocolate aftertaste. Big flavor, roasty malt and delicious."
"Overall, a pleasant RIS and one that highlights very nicely the use of oatmeal. Recommended."
"D: Very good. Went down easily for a bomber of 9+% ABV."
"D - One of the best Imperial Stouts I've ever had."
"D: Overall, I'd gladly return to this brew, although it's got serious competition from the likes of Founders Breakfast Stout (regular and Kentucky), Stones Russian Imperial Stout, and Bell's Expedition."
"D: Solid.."
"A friend split this with me which was good because I could not finish the 22 on my own, but what I had I enjoyed."
"D: An excellent sipper, a great beer, if a bit expensive but well worth the price."
"There are some great beers that come from Ohio and this ranks up there with the best. Here's to them and the Ohio State Buckeyes!"
"Packed with huge Imperial Stout flavor yet remaining extremely smooth and drinkable, I think that this is one criminally underrated Stout. I remember being really impressed when I first had a bottle of this (well over a year ago) and I'm glad to see that my opinion of it has held fast."
"The beer smells really chocolaty and sweet. The beer is extremely black with a small head, and it goes to a ring. The beer is really chocolaty and sweet. A slight bit of alcohol comes through as well. Extremely balanced. The beer is creamy and thick. The beer is super easy to drink as well."
"Drinkability is decent but there are so many better recipes out there. Oatmeal stouts don't lend well to being amped up. This one has no technical brewing defects, just doesn't taste that good. The nice burnt malt note and strong coffee are the redeeming features."
"Overall, a decent brew from Hoppin' Frog, but there are better out there."
"Poured a deep, deep brown with small brown head. Nose was so good. Plenty of smooth milk chocolate, roasted malts and ton of oats. Taste was very smooth with the ABV almost hidden behind so much flavor. Coacoa, oats and a good roastiness. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy. Best damn Oatmeal Imp Stout I ever had. Seriously!"
"Drinkability would be high if I could get this whenever I wanted!"
"Pours a one finger tan head that fades quickly, leaving some lace. Black as midnight. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted chocolate nose. Flavor is sweet roasted chocolate and coffee. Bitterness stays in background. High ABV is hidden. Decent oatmeal stout. $10.45 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"WOW!! Be careful with this one. It pours like the finest motor oil available. Super-dark, super-rich with little head. This bomber will leave you bombed by the end if your not careful. Great chocolate, oatmeal, and slight alcohol taste upfront. I detected a nice, clean, coffee, roasted malt and molassas-like finish. While there isn't much of a head, it drinks rather creamy. If you are looking for a Big, I mean Big beer. This one is for you. It was worth the wait, as it took a while for me to locate a bottle. Drink responsibly...this one could hit you like a hammer as the alcohol seems more prevelant as the beer opens. What a great imperial."
"Bit more carbonation and I would give a 5 for drinkability. This is an incredibily well balanced Imperial Oatmeal Stout."
"This beer pours thick and pitch black with a one finger head that disappears quickly. The smell is one of this beers high points - Huge chocolate, malt and hints of alcohol. The taste is bitter chocolate and oatmeal with the alcohol being very upfront. I love the thick full bodied and silky mouthfeel. The alcohol comes out more as this beer warmed so im glad I didnt wait to start drinking this beer especially since its a bomber. Drinkability is good - the bomber was all I needed."
"M/D - Full bodied and incredibly smooth. Very good oatmeal stout. Very big beer which makes this a sipper, but damn tasty."
"D: 9.4% RIS and it drinks like a low ABV oatmeal stout. I haven't had this in a long time and I have no idea why. I'm glad I realized I hadn't reviewed it."
"Drinkability: One of these days, I'll have to try this head to head with Breakfast Stout; it's mighty competitive"
"D- finishing this was about as easy as it gets. especially for something this potent. very smooth, enjoyable, and well balanced. this one exceeded expectations and im sure ill try it again. recommended."
"Very, very good beer. The flavor seems to only improve with warming and repeated contemplation. Perhaps the most drinkable beer of its type...not sure why. Maybe it's the superb balance or relatively sensible ABV. Whatever the case, B.O.R.I.S. = B.A.D.A.S.S."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque brown about two shades away from black. Quarter-inch mocha-colored head dissipated into a thin slick of tiny effervescing bubbles; lacing was almost non-existent during the tasting. Very sweet nose consisting of brown sugar, chocolate, toffee. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of some dark fruit detectable as the brew warmed and a pronounced hops bitterness indicated at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and slightly viscous with a subtle carbonation to add some additional character. Alcohol was fairly well-hidden, but presented slightly as it warmed. I've been wanting to try this for a while, and I was not disappointed. This is an excellent brew that is widely accessible."
"D:Frickin awesome!!!! This is easily one of the best oatmeal stouts i have ever had. Insanely smooth and complex."
"poured out black as night which was expected. The head had a brown lacing to it. Dark malts and coffee were right up front on the smell, with oat overtones coming through as it warmed. Coffee was in the taste too with a little bit of hops to even it out. Very good brew in my opinion with a heavy mouthfeel."
"This is one of the very best Imperial Stouts available year round and is absolutely deserving of a purchase. Please go buy this beer and support Hoppin' Frog for making an incredible product."
"World class for sure!"
"D: A damn good stout. Would love to try this again with some snow on the ground but it was damn good even in July. Had this as a dessert beer and it went really well. Would grab this again if I saw it."
"A deliciously balanced mix of dark fruits, coffee, dark roasted malt and traces of smoke, with some hops at the end to bring it back, and though the alcohol doesn't get in the way of the flavor, the warmth it provides going down is extremely pleasant. Full bodied and smooth overall but with just a touch of sharpness. Great beer."
"D: This is a very drinkable RIS and, while it's not the most complex version I've had, it's an extremely good stout and I would seek this one out."
"Highly recommended. One of the better imperial stouts I've had in recent memory."
"Hoppin' Frog says that B.O.R.I.S. (Bodacious Oatmeal Russian Imperial Stout) the crusher, its Oatmeal-Imperial Stout, ""...will crush you like no other!"" Consider me crushed. This is the last of the good number of Hoppin' Frog brews I grabbed on a trip to Philadelphia a couple months back. Ohio's Hoppin' Frog beers are rating pretty high for me at this point, their one misstep being the ""Golden Fraug"" I reviewed a little while back. The BORIS, which is a gigantic beer in a Brew Dog style session beer's clothing is not one to be taken lightly. This is a straight up mind eraser of a beer that has a good amount of bitterness to balance out the insanity of the normal pantheon of ""dark"" flavors - coffee, smoke, chocolate, and the kinds of fruits you find in dried form in a typical geriatric kitchen cupboard. The body is very nice and it pours black as ink with a chocolatey looking head, not unlike another Brew Dog favorite, Oskar's Ten Fiddy, and it has the right amount of carbonation, which is key to this style. Not exactly the perfect beer for a hot summer day, but turned out to be pretty perfect for a cool summer night after a long day of work."
"The body is thick, not massive, with a fine carbonation, slightly warming alcohol, and velvety smooth texture. In all, its a highly drinkable, highly enjoyable impy stout."
"This is an elite Imperial Stout no doubt. Dark, creamy, and delicious!!"
"Ok, I've had a few more sips and the sweet aspect of this Stout is a bit more pronounced(maybe because it's warming up? I took it straight out of the fridge) and actually, quite welcome. I love what is going on here so I'll have to give a big salute to Hoppin' Frog for brewing it and again, to Kevin for sending it my way. I have *another* bottle to enjoy but I'm going to drink it fresh as well so no cellaring for this baby. ;^)"
"An interesting beer. An imperial stout with traces of oatmeal stout. It works, but at the same time, I'm not sure if it does. The oatmeal sort of feels like it doesn't belong in the imperial stout, or maybe I'm just too used to imperials a certain. Anyway... a good beer none the less."
"D - Delicious."
"B.O.R.I.S. is a well blended, easy to drink heavy Imperial stout that is too smooth for its own good. Recommended, but drink with caution -- the frog means business."
"D - very nice!"
"Hats off again to shbobdb. Wish I could get this in Colorado! If it's available where you live, go get some today."
"D - Good Brew. Lots of oatmeal that makes the beer a tad bland, but is true to the style. Would love more of this beer."
"Another excellent imperial stout. It seems like it must be an easy style to brew since good ones are all over the place. I think I will save my second bottle to see how this beer changes after a year."
"This beer is rated among the best and there are no questions why. This beer has all the strength, complexity, pleasantries, and balance that it takes to be great. While low on esters, this beer delivers a whollop of espresso and raw cocoa up front and never relinquishes. Nutty flavors along with the light caramels, toffees, and a hint of cherries woven late into the alcohol warmth give the beer its charm without muddling. Very rich, viscous, and downright chewy textured, but smoothed to a velvety touch by more than just a little bit of oats. These round the beer out perfectly. Set among a backdrop of motor-oil looking liquid, this beer proves worthy of greatness. Very drinkable for such power and flavor. Its the best stout I've had in a long, long time."
"Ovr: I've been drinking a lot of oatmeal stouts recently, Devil Over a Barrel, and KBS, and this is right up there with all of those. Definitely heavier than all of them, and more full bodied. Great great great beer."
"Very drinkable no problem putting down a bomber on a warm night"
"D: wonderful RIS! I will definitely drink this again, but it is a sipping beer."
"Pours a deep dark brown nearly lightless with a pure black center. Thin 1/2 pinky of burnt orange head has little retention and leaves thin spotty lacing and an oily residue. Smells of chocolate, oat, coffee, grapefruit, and a hint of alcohol. Taste starts out with dark chocolate and toffee. Dark fruits like plum and raisins follow along with some roasted oat flavor. Finish is bitter and roasty with lots of coffee expression as well as a touch of citrus hops. Thick and full bodied, smooth and creamy with low carbonation. A good balance and a great transition from sweet to bitter, not overly crazy with different flavors popping out at inappropriate times. An excellent RIS that is fairly low in ABV and easy enough to obtain that I can dive into one of these anytime I feel the RIS urge."
"This could not be an everyday beer for me. But as an Imperial Stout, this would be close to my favorite."
"D- Is very great here. Not over filling like some RIS. Very enjoyable."
"Pours dark brown with a small thick hear. Aroma of chocolate, oats and hops. Taste is similar, with additional notes if licorice and molasses. Very thich, oily mouthfeel. Tastes like a meal. Reletively low carbonation. Strong bitter ending. Really nice beer."
"Its been enjoyable cooler seasons with this and Troegs ImpOatSt."
"Its pretty damn drinkable too. At 9.4% it is a little hot and could use age. Either way its still a good stout!"
"D- what can I say. Its a sipper for me but there's nothing wrong with that. Don't imagine it was designed for quaffing."
"D - A great oatmeal Imperial Stout, just fantastic to sip. The strength is a bit limiting and I recommend savoring this for at 9.4% it is like a meal in a glass. The overall drinkability for me is excellent since there really aren't many beers that match the quality and layered maltiness in the oatmeal accented stout world. The booziness is expected, but subtle for the strength, A must try!"
"Heard a lot hype about this one and I agree with the majority of it, one of the better oatmeal stouts I have tasted, definitely one of the stronger ones, could possibly make a serious black and tan if you are into those, would definitely drink again, recommended"
"Very easy to drink."
"Sweet and sticky and a little cloying. Overall, this was a little too sweet for me. I can see how people like it but it just was too cloying to me. I do love the coffee and chocolate flavors but the alcoholic burn and heat ond other factors make this one just an average RIS in my book."
"This beer would proudly tango any dairy laiden dessert, however can march into the world venison, and aged steak quite nicley. I would also thing certain cajun seafood dishes would meet their match with this guy."
"Drinkability: Man, that's one yummy frog. Very drinkable, very tasty."
"Pours deep black/dark brown with a motor oil like constituency. Almost no head. Average lacing. Slightly under carbonated with a sweet smells of coffee and roasted malts. Smokey, chocolaty, coffee with hint of tobacco. It finishes sweet the bitter. This is a world class beer!"
"D-If it were in a smaller bottle, could definitely have a 6-er and feel alright."
"jet black, thick pour with a beautiful rich chocolate head that dissapates quickly. Smells very roasty, malty, hoppy? Very warm roasted malt, with coffee hints. Flavor that lasts very long on the tongue. I get a little licorice after warming. Wow lots of very nicely blended flavors, with almost no clue of 9.4 ABV. Very easy to drink. When I poured my second glass I poured it from about 15 inches from the glass. This created a huge head that had an incredible reverse cascading head that left a thick creamy foam that was like ice cream. unbeliablely incredibly wonderful! highly recommended"
"I'm very fond of the taste, rich with malt but more--licorice, caramel, hazelnut coffee--bold and smooth. Its creamy smooth, mellifluous coating only adds to the delight that B.O.R.I.S. the RIS provides. Though the high ABV (9.4 %) does catch up to the drinker with this, it is really terrific beer. I can't believe it's taken me so long to try these excellent offerings from Hoppin' Frog. I'll frequently return to enjoy their wares, readily available in the Midwest. B.O.R.I.S. deserves ample attention from any aficionado of RIS. This won't disappoint."
"Drinks through the roof for the style & ABV. I like this one a lot! Recommended"
"From bottle (as they are now distributed to IL, woo hoo!): Black in color with a moderately thick head of tight brown bubbles. The aromas are on the sweet side with scents of oats, Valrhona chocolate, coffee, aniseed and Christmas spices. The palate is dense and concentrated with the chocolate & coffee from the nose showing in the front follwed by a sweet midpalate of brown sugar and oats. The finish lingers on and on but picks up some bitter hops to balance the sweetness of the midplate. A very nicely balanced beer that is both complex and layered while also being quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: Superb. Drinks like any old stout. It's just a lot better than most without being too boozy, too hoppy, or just too damned big."
"Smells woodsy with roasted malt, big coffee notes, a hint of chocolate and ... not much oatmeal, actually. The taste introduces the oatmeal, which actually adds kind of an ""old wood"" or stale flavor which is offset by a huge roasted malt and coffee/chocolate backbone. Very flavorful, very robust. Thanks to RoyMunson!"
"This ended my night at Moan and Dove awesomely. A slight head formed when formed but it quickly dissipates. Very, very dark colors with brown-color lacing. The aromas were rich in earthy mocha, dark chocolate flavors. Taste-wise, this was like a delicious coffee frappe: strong in mocha, caramel, coffee, espresso dimensions. Like I said, the drink definitely was frappe-like, making it more dessert than drink. I highly suggest then having this as your final drink of the night because it is so good."
"D- i have to restrain myself a little on this one, all of its complexities could make me drink faster while trying to ponder the subtleties, resulting in another empty glass. they call this one 'the crusher' for a reason..."
"black with clear mahogony highlights when held to the light and a really nice looking creamy brown head and lacing. molasses, dark dried fruits, coffee, and a bit of booziness in the nose. big chocolatey sweet malts in the mouth get balanced out by some sharp roastiness and an underlying herbal/piney bitterness. slick, viscous, and full-bodied, but not too big as some beers of this style can be. very creamy carbonation. definitely a complex sipping beer."
"This was definitely an intense beer, albeit not quite as extreme as I anticipated. Definitely a flavorful and interesting offering nevertheless. However, at $11 a bottle I must say it was rather pricey."
"Bottle. WOW! I have previously tried 2 other Hoppin' Frog beers, that while not bad, did nothing to impress me in this day and age of beer geeks being spoiled with an abundance of spectacular brews. This beer is the one to impress said beer geek. There are many solid RIS on the market, this is right up there with the elite. Pours a deep, deep brown with a light brown head that began thick and full and disippated into a nice tan 1/8"" layer, but with no real lacing to speak of. Aroma is strong with dark chocolate and roasted malts, with a little burnt sugar smell in the background. The flavor is HUGE! It has a serious dark chocolate thing going on, bittersweet, with a sweetish creamy undertone. The balance between the creamy sweetness and roasty bitterness is outstanding. The mouthfeel is tremendous. I have had too many stouts of late that have great flavor with a mouthfeel that is too thin. Not so with B.O.R.I.S., huge, huge, huge, so thick and full. I can't wait to get some more of this!"
"Strong though."
"It took a beer like this to remind me how much I love stouts after spending the winter drinking mostly hop-laden brews and Belgian ales."
"Very nice - best example of the Imperial-Oatmeal I've had so far, and not as boozy. Recommended. Thanks out to ahatcher78!"
"Overall, I highly recommend this beer. Exceptionally easy to drink and one of the best that I've tried."
"22 oz bottle. Pours opaque black with 2 cm of dark tan head that lasted a while. Aroma of roasted malt with a hint of cherries. Initial flavor includes chocolate, grains, and a hint of something sweet, maybe cherry. Flavor ends with some dryer components from the hops and oatmeal. Light carbonation, medium body, some lacing, and noted alcohol towards the end of the taste. High drinkability, very tasty, and have had it before and will continue to keep it in my stout rotation."
"Pours midnight black with a tan head that settles to a ring that sticks around. Smells a trifle sweet with aromas of plums, chocolate covered cherries, a bit of spicebox scent, and perhaps some licorice. A bit vinous as well and quite a bit of sweet malt. The roastiness is very much in the background. The taste is delicious. Still a bit sweet, with some of the same elements that are in the aroma, especially the chocolate and spice, but there is a good deal more roastiness and there is a delicious silky finish from the oatmeal. Mouthfeel is equally silky and smooth. Quite drinkable, and oh so easy to suck down, regardless of the abv."
"Damn fine imperial stout. I'm glad this is available in PA now."
"D - This is a kick ass brew! Not a session brew by any means, this is a world class sipping beer that is sweet and bitter at the same time. This would be sinful with a box of chocolates, but if there is any thing wrong with this beer, it's the sweetness that become a bit overbearing at times."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium to full bodied. Carbonation is excellent. Extremely smooth and drinkable. I could drink a bomber or two despite its strength. It goes down that easy. Overall, this is an excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"A full-flavored, intense Imperial Stout. A nice offering from a brewery I've never even heard of before. Hopefully I can sample some of their other offerings in the future."
"Pours deep black with good dark tan head. The nose smells of good hops and oats. taste follows with great roasty malt flavors, good solid oatmeal presence and a wonderful hop character on this finish. The hop character in this one is about perfect, similar to TenFidy in that way. Not too bitter and not overmalty either. Mouthfeel is a touch thin on this one, but still quite good. Drinkability gets highest marks here as the abv is completely hidden. If it wasn't for the intensity of the flavors here you would never think this was imperial. This is one hell of a brew, great job to the boys at hoppin frog! Thanks again to Mike."
"Super black color with a dark brown head that quickly dissolved into a ring of bubbles. It smells like dark chocolate cake, yum. Interesting flavors that remind me of Stone IRS, dark fruity, nice beer. The mouthfeel is bubbly. the drinkability is obviously hampered by the ABV and the carbonation."
"Drink ability: Every now and then beer. I would like to sit on one for another year or two and then give it a go."
"Very tasty but I would really only be able to handle one glass .. maybe a bomber .. Simply too lush ... This is definitely a special occasion beer for me, even if I had ready access."
"Thanks Tony! Good call!"
"Wow, this one far exceeded my expectations despite it's already high marks. Let me tell you - this ain't no Guinness nor should anyone mistake it for such, but I'd definitely prefer a B.O.R.I.S. for St. Patrick's Day."
"Pours a solid dark black with a nice sized creamy but somewhat short lived tan head into a snifter. Smell was big and of oatmeal sweetness, dark roasted malt and I got a big fire roasted marshmallow gooeyness out of it as well. Taste was also fantastic, very nice roasty character with oatmeal creaminess and chewiness making an obvious presence. Very full mouthfeel, and on the sweeter side of an imperial stout, which I tend to like. I got a big marshmallow like character in the taste as well and overall this was an amazing beer. The hint of alcohol that shows as it warms was pretty mild and unobtrusive."
"D: Full flavored, balanced and rich. Smooth and creamy with a pleasant warm and clean finish. Wonderful, powerful, complex stout...a joy to drink."
"Came to me with a one finger dark mocha head atop a dark black brew. Smelled fairly sweeter than others I have had of the style. There was a lot of sweet malts and a sweeter chocolate than most. There was also coffee and some dark fruit flavors. The taste was again very sweet with more of a creamy milk chocolate rather than mild dark chocolate. There were hints of coffee and vanilla as well as some licorice and lactose. This was a very well balanced imperial stout that had a good creamy mouthfeel and just the right carbonation. This brew went down smooth but I think I just drinking it fairly quickly because they were bringing out my Heavyweight Perkuno's Hammer. Overall though I could drink this all night and will definitely be picking up a bottle or two next week."
"D: Everything works in concert to help keep the alcohol from getting too far out of hand. That being said, my cheeks and ears were pretty warm as I finished my glass of this. Good stuff and very enjoyable."
"Overall: Thanks Tayner for the try. This is one beer that I have wanted to try for sometime and I enjoyed it. Tons of big bold flavors make it a winner. It is not the best RIS in the world but will hold its own against the big boys. Thanks for sharing this true Ohio gem."
"d: This is a fantastic beer that I would love to have on a regular basis. I don't let price influence my drinkability score, but I must write the following. This stuff is over $70 a case for 12 bombers. Stoudt's Fat Dog is every bit as good and at a little more than half the price. I am glad I tried a bottle but I won't pay for more."
"The flavors and aromas here are very strong but not overpowering, making for a pleasant drinking experience. Highly recommended."
"It's busy and complex, but it's also artfully blended into a thick, rich, ichorous brew. Sweet and bitter are glued fetchingly together with stripe of oaty happiness. It's the crisp mix that helps make the ABV a willing accomplice in the journey to fine drinkability and impending inebriation. Dark as night, it's a froggy delight, not to mention a croaking good time."
"There are too many rich creamy RISs out there that do not have the alcohol bite to put this on the top of my list. I would not recommend this particular one."
"Pretty good stout, just not a great one. I will have to try more of this brewery's offerings."
"Very well done."
"Drinkability: high"
"Notes - Nice stuff. Not the best imperial stout around, but definitely a good one."
"Easy to drink and damn tasty. This is my first sample from Hoppin Frog and I am impressed."
"Pours a oily jet black with just a bit of a dark mocha head that didn't stick around. Left oily dregs on the side of the glass. Aroma is roasted almost smoky malts up front with vanilla and almost a (call me crazy) banana pudding finish. Taste is big on the roasted flavors, bourbon, vanilla with a bit of cherry. Mouthfeel is full but dry and tasty. Not a whole lot of carbonation. This is very drinkable. I wish I could get some more."
"For the high ABV and dark drink the drinkability is amazing. So smooth and can't taste the alcohol going down. Great balance and taste all the way through."
"This is a pleasure to savor-a perfect nightcap. Or a meal. Awesome."
"D- Great and delicious, everything I was hopping for from this beer."
"BORIS poured black as oil and produced a nice brown head. It had some great banana esters and a solid, creamy body. Generally, it was a delicious beer and I wish it was more readily available on the west coast. It is on the level of great local San Diego offerings like Speedway Stout and Old Viscosity."
"For those of us who know the history of this brew, and know Fred Karm's original recipe for Thirsty Dog's Siberian Night realize how contract brewing in Frederick brewing keeping the brand alive can kill what the beer was all about. Now enters Hoppin' Frog and all is right in the world. Appears pitch black motor oil that absolutely absorbs every band of the visible light spectrum where everything fades to black. Head is a dark brown mocha hue, forms thick. With my first gulp of the brew head is left evenly all around my Southern Tier pint glass. Aromatics bring out deep roasted malts with coffee and dark chocolate and the oatmeal adds that layer of cereal grain softness to the mix, while herbal hops flow as well. Sweet decadent creamy burnt marshmallows with singe of alcohol tickling the ol' nares. Flavor a rolling wave of oatmeal and roasted malt sweet and roasted malt bitterness. Creamy sweet syrup added to a bowl of plain oatmeal, with cocoa powder and flame roasted marshmallow added to the mix that's what this beer tastes like. After your first few sips you think where's the hops because in flavor only minimal herbal balancing hop flavor survives the malt trip, but by the third or fourth sip the hop burps arrive and you realize where those sixty international bitterness units are hiding. Huge yet perfectly balanced beer sweet and creamy yet roasty and hoppy, the ying and yang of all dark beers. Mouthfeel is huge creamy borderline custard at times, carbonation rolls sluggishly trying to move that high gravity around, you can tell when you watch the pour. It takes awhile for the head to form even after a vigorous pour. Drinkability is effortless even after 22oz I could have another glass. I learned this after having it on tap before it arrive in Pittsburgh. I made a beer run up to Boardman, OH to visit Ron Bush at his Diamond Bar where Boris was flowing. A couple glasses later had me owned by this brew, my second meeting with this fine brew came at Smokin' Joe's in the South Side after a Pirate's game, needles to say I tried to make this brew a session beer....I know I know...respect beer. By the way thanks to Valley Wine Cellar I can now by it in the city where I live for $7.99 a bottle, that's value."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" purply dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head recedes slowly, with average to good lace. Aroma is dark roasty malts with an undercurrent of alcohol. Taste follows the nose, rich and creamy, with the alcohol bringing it on at the close. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is excellent. I'll be back for more."
"Thanks go out to Rblwthacoz for the bottle."
"Cherers!"
"Poured aggressively, an opaque darkness with a full finger dark tan foamy head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty lacing patterns. IMO the smell is great. I get an almost syrupy dark chocolate over a vanilla-cherry alcohol that reminds me of an oak treated product. At the bottom of that chocolaty goodness is the roast oat aroma. Lightly carbonated, a tang of alcohol, the mouth feel is medium light, but what i am really drawn to is the 'coating' effect that is unforgettable; like my favorite Double Stouts. Full flavored, the oat chocolate oak treated-like taste is outside the box. There is a wonderful complexity to the flavor combinations that lingers appropriately and invoke involuntary lip smacking reflexes. You could say that its heavy, but i don't find the ABV distracting...at all. RIBIT!"
"Yeah it's big and it's big and chocolaty, but I didn't find this to be a particularly outstanding. It appeared pitch black with a tan head in my pint glass. The aroma is a mix of cocoa and burnt grains. The oats contribute to a very smooth flavor, but I'm thrown off by the feel and balance between what seems to be citrus hops and chocolate malts. They just aren't working. It makes for a less than ideal feel, but this beer is still very drinkable for it's size and weight."
"The body is big but smooth but limited. There was some watery/wispy flavors that I would off set by. This really is a big deterrent overall in the beer. Maybe its young but there are some rough edges with the astringent, velvet and bitterness that I didn't agree with. I would like to try this again but maybe we some age."
"Spectacular beer. One of those ones that you would kill to have available locally."
"My dream: Bourbon aged version..."
"This bad boy pours a deep, dark, mystical black color with a deep tan head. Very nice head for style. Rich malty nose...nuts, dried fruits, alcohol. Alcohol hit upfront...then nice rich malts, plenty of roast malts, chocolate, a hint of figs, and alcohol fire. A nice hop balance. Hop flavors fight in the middle of the mouth - bittering provides excellent balance to all the malty goodness. WELL DONE!!!!"
"Poured an very dark brown with no light shining through. Thick brown head. Aromas of roasted coffee and malt. Taste was very nice. Hints of coffee, with a dark cocoa bitterness. Alcohol well hidden. Slightly warming finish. Overall, a very nice beer and I would definitely drink again."
"Pours pitch black and thick with a smaller dark tan head that forms and falls to nothing. No lacing. Malty tones on the nose. Extremely slight amount of roasted edge to it. Flavor is extremely smooth. Unbelievably smooth. Thick malts accented by mild oat. Sweet tone almost like a molasses that's more smooth and sweet than thick and bitter with a biting edge. Man, oh man. Very mild amount of alcohol biting on the back side. On the aftertaste I feel it burning just a slight bit as well. Feel is thick on liquid and carries a low, but smooth enough carbonation. Is this easy to drink? You better believe it. Truly exceptional. I wish I had a case of this instead of just this one bottle."
"Not a bad Stout but I think it could have used more hop balance to stand up to the sweetness. A lot of people are going to like this beer, it's not quite what I had in mind but it is still pretty good... Thanks to ClockworkOrange for the bottle..."
"Drinkability is great if you have this available too you it should be in your fridge. I know it would be in mine. Damn fine brew many thanks to merlin48 for this wonderful treat. Perfect dessert brew, don't know if I am just in the mood for an RIS, but really enjoying myself now."
"This is the first oatmeal stoat that I was able to notice an oatmeal flavor."
"Pours inky black with barely visible burgundy highlights. Looks viscous like syrup. Small head of light brown foam. Huge aroma that is mostly dark fruit  prunes, raisins, figs over a sweet chocolate maltiness. Flavor is outstanding. If youre a fan of sweet stouts this is among the best  sweet robust chocolate malt with plenty of fruity esters with a dry bitter finish, lots of stuff going on here in the flavor department. It has a great slick mouthfeel that is back up by just the right amount of carbonation. If youre a fan of huge tasting Russian imperial stouts then you are going to love this."
"Drinkability: This beer could compete with Speedway Stout for the magnitude of flavor. It is highly drinkable and would be an excellent dessert pairing. I only paid $6.25 for a 22 ounce bottle, so I feel like I got a good deal. You can't find a better beer for the money. No problem drinking a bottle or so. Seek it out."
"Much thanks to BuckeyeNation for providing!"
"Beautiful black color-poured into a DFH snifter-great slight tan head. Deep, deep roasted aroma-somewhat port like. Slight vinuous aroma. Inky, deep flavor. Strong roasted taste as it warms. Flavor continues to improve. An at first perceived harshness is balanced against a stiff, malty and full bodied, deep licorice taste. Velvety and slick mouthfeel. I wasnt impressed at first but over 30 minutes this has really turned into a great, great beer. Killer stuff."
"This beer poured as black as night with no light getting through. It formed a dark tan foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee and black strap molasses. The flavor was of malt, coffee and dark fruit, The body is medium and slightly oily and the finish is slightly burnt, yet sweet. A nice stout."
"D - I didn't really pick up any oatmeal stout qualities in taste, just mouthfeel. Very drinkable even though the abv hits like a brick."
"Possibly the best Oatmeal stout around. The Oats compliment everything very well. Great balance and very drinkable"
"Great beer that EVERYONE needs to try.I am gonna get one for my cellar."
"Had this on my recent trip to Ohio at vintage estate in Boardman , a must if your in the area. Poured into a chalice, pours a dark black with a bit of a dark head that leaves a ring around the glass, typical for this type of stout. Smell was amazing dark chocolate burnt figs and grapes, sweet smell of alcohol. Taste was amazing I can taste strong coffee, hints of roasted malt and toffee, chocolate and a bit of a velvet german cake in there, Simply awesome stuff. Overall this was one fine damn offering, I am glad to have had this on draft awesome beer at an awesome place."
"Overall- Whoo boy, strong flavors and alc. in this 1! Would've scored higher but I didn't detect much smell from the bottle or my Special Samual Adams glass."
"Pours that good ol' black with a deep brown head that leaves quickly, but leaves a cool coating of bubbles on the glass after each sip. The aroma makes me think of blackened oats. with some burnt grapes and currents in the middle. With soe creamed coffee and a dash of alcohol. The taste starts with some coffee and oats up front. Lots of blackened fruits. Maybe even chocolate covered black cherries. Dark chocolate that would explain he bitterness with a little softened black licorice. The palate is pretty dark, yet warm and inviting mixed with some sweet bitterness."
"Pitch black in appearance. Brown head dissipates quickly. Minimal brown lacing around the edges of my glass. Smells of wet camp fire, chocolate brownies, sweet dark fruits, a hint of maple syrup and roasted burnt malt. The taste is incredible! So much going on. Rich chocolate, raisins, sweet roast malt, and some bitter hops at the end. Mouth feel is thick and smooth then becomes sticky. Low carbonation. This RIS coats your teeth and your glass! Overall drinkability is great. Hardly detected the high ABV. A bomber to myself went down quite easily. Highly recommended!"
"D: Very nice. However, could tell it was 9.4% ABV, but not in the taste, just the effects."
"A tasty mix of flavors and easy to drink."
"Pours a deep and opaque black, like night, thick brown head, nice lacing and great retention, looks pretty badass. Smell is alcohol, chocolate and coffee roast, some oats, licorice, cherries, quite nice, very rich. Taste is vanilla, chocolate and coffee roast, oats, dark fruits, alcohol, touch of licorice and toffee. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, very warm, but pretty smooth. Nicely done but you really get the 9.4%. Thanks again Nate!"
"D: Wow, totally enjoyable. (For me) it is a little better toward room temperature than cold."
"Basically black in color with a nice frothy tan head that lasts for a while. Very rich roasted smell. Coffee and chocolate are huge here, along with a grassy hop and faint nutty undertone. Taste is much of the same. One of the most robust roasted Stouts I've tried for sure. Oatmeal comes through more in the taste than I noticed in the nose. Mouthfeel is rich and full with no alcohol present at all. Drinkability is good with the only setback being that this one is almost too full of roasted flavor. I really enjoyed this and will seek it out in the future."
"An outstanding beer, and I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it out."
"The mouthfeel is very thick and decadent with a heavy syrupiness and low carbonation. Formidable and satisfying on the palate. Certainly a must try, and one of my favorite selections from one of my favorite styles."
"This is a very fine tasting beer. It would have been near perfect and much more drinkable if it had a bit more co2."
"I drank this one at cellar tempature. A vigorous pour gets a beautiful rsult. Thick oil black body hosts a one inch milk chocolate colored head. Looks like I might need a spoon for this one. Nice chocolate cola nose is vibrant and hosts notes of minerals and alchol. At first sip you get wonderful up front dark cacao chocolate. Roasty burnt malt highlights a tingley mouthfeel. Alchol is slightly noticeable on the tongue and on the belly. Ends with a slightly soured bitter that is indective of good dark chocolate finish. Drinks well even as it warms. For those who like thier stouts on the more bitter side."
"D: Something to sip and savor - one of my new favorite RISs. A rich and complex ale worthy of high praise, one I'm very glad to have tried and will look forward to enjoying again. Very highly recommended. Thank you to jpm30 for sending a while ago..."
"D---This is a terrific beer. I had it on tap along with the Founders Breakfast stout at the same time, yeah, lucky me huh? I have to say that the Hoppin Frog took the Pepsi challenge and stood up quite nicely. This is a must try for anyone who loves this style of beer..."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a rich roasted and chocolate malt scent that is sweet and dessert like with a nice subtle roasted malt aroma. The taste is great as well. It has a wonderfully warm black and chocolate malt flavor. It's rich and powerful, yet highly enjoyable. This is a meal of a beer. It has a complex palate that resinates in the finish. The mouthfeel is great. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous beer. It's bold and flavorful as well as enjoyable. Nice work!"
"Ive been looking forward to trying Hoppin Frog since I learned of their existence. Through a stroke of luck there is a store in my area (From The Vine of course) that now carries them. As usual I went right to my favorite style first. This beer turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Pours thoroughly black with a medium thick and foamy head that lasts awhile. Nice patchy lacing. Big roasted malt aroma that has touches of chocolate and coffee as well. Rich body with a really flavorful with a roasty character. Lots of malt, chocolate, nuts and coffee flavors. Sweet touches of vanilla as well, and a bit of an alcohol presence. The finish is long and tasty with hops and sweet malt. An admirable offering from a new brewer!"
"drinkability is good. well balanced and very good. as it warms the alcohol comes out a bit more, but mostly as a little bit of warmth and isn't at all unpleasant. great stuff."
"D: This is a good beer all around. I do question why they put strong beers in bigger bottles though. This is the equivalent of almost 4 regular beers worth of alcohol."
"This beer is absolutely delicious. Be extremely careful, it is very potent, too. I could drink 100 of these in a sitting if I could walk upright. Nice chocolatey malts, poured nice tan head, but disapated quickly. Different than most imperial stouts because the bitterness is NOT overwhelming. It's dry, sweet, and clean. Some coffee flavors but they do not dominate. Very smooth beer and very underrated!"
"B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher now has a space in my top ten favorite beers, and it will become a regular in my purchases. I'm also pleased to be able to support an Ohio brewery."
"Pours from the bottle like I just struck oil. A dark chocolate mousse head forms in slow motion, this is some 10W30. Smells of dark chocolate covered cherries with a hint of expresso. Big roasted malt and ground coffee taste. Finishes with the chocolate covered cherry taste. Full in the mouth with some carbonation. Between warming effect and taste, the A.B.V. is noticeable. A sipper no doubt. Quite a delight this one, a must try."
"Cheers!"
"Outstanding RIS, oatmeal stout, beer thanks to Aofoxxy. I left one glass for 24 hours for my buddy and he thougt it was good even then."
"Pours a rich dark color with a dark tan colored bubbly head. Head quickly died down to leave the black as night colored stout in my glass. Smell brings out the toasted malt, and coffee aromas. The taste is where I really loved this one. Smooth, rich, creamy, cocoa and toasted malt that I really enjoyed. Mouth is medium bodied and smooth and made for a very enjoyable drink. I actually went back and got a second. I was very impressed with this one!"
"Pours very dark, very thick and with little to no foam, no matter how high I poured the bottle from to try and create some. The aroma is just like a well crafted RIS should smell like: roasted and chocolate malts, coffee and vanilla notes, very clean and intense. Time to taste this bad boy. Its a deceptive beer Ill say. Deceptive in the way that it shows hardly any carbonation and yet once you take a sip of this your mouth tingles from it. Its a BIG beer. The coffee is intense and also the chocolate and roasted malts, but the only drawback is that the alcohol is noticeable enough to worry me if Ill be able to finish this bomber while Im getting sleepy. As the beer warms up the alcohol seems to overpower in the aroma. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety only a bit too much carbonation. The more I sip it the more I get the alcohol in the taste and aroma which reminds me more and more of liquor, which I find that hard to tolerate now. The biggest drawback of this beer, for my taste is the strong alcohol presence. This beer is just not for me, but at least I got to try it."
"Another pretty good beer from Hoppin' Frog, a brewery I'm coming to like more and more. If you're in to really rich stouts then this would be the one for you. I'm looking forward to revisiting this beer during the winter, perhaps an aged bottle as I feel this beer could benefit from some rounding of the rough edges."
"Mouthfeel was very thick, syrupy, but quite smooth on the palate. A little to syrupy for me, and the flavors were just not balanced and harmonious to make me love it."
"A pitch black color, with a dark brown colored head forming, about an inch thick. Visually this beer looks thick, almost like oil. The scent of sweet malt, with chocolate and coffee fragrances, plus the sweet fragrance of oatmeal. That is followed by a dried fruit, mostly currants and raisons, there is the slightest twinge of alchol at the end. The malt and oatmeal starts at the front, then a coffee bitterness hits midway, then it has a bit of a citrus twange at the back of the palate. The oil look is deceiving, when it hits the mouth it is a lighter feel at the front and rolls to the back, gain weight to its texture along the way. There is a bit of warming feel of alchol at the end. This a very, very good beer, the usual suspects one would find in imperial stout, but the edition of oatmeal makes it sweeter and smoother. This just beckons one to drink this beer, a great sipping beer."
"Reminds me of chocolate syrup, thin dark head matching the dark beer appearance, but thick taste and mouth consistency. Not just a nice chocolate but a good dark belgium chocolate with caramel, not to sweet, with a little coffee after taste. Wants to be drunk slowly and enjoyed."
"Poured into a chalice a deep black color, some carbonation, tiny fizzy tannish head, some oil slicks were left behind. The nose is malty, roasted, slightly oaked, tons of toffee/coffee/caramel. The taste is malty/roasted, big big toffee/coffee/caramel flavour, YUMMY! The alcohol is hidden pretty well, a slight dry/bitter finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome RIS, highly recommended. I will have to try some of the other offerings from this brewery."
"All 4.5's for this one.... I must leave room at the top for another beer to come along and dethrone this one..."
"Pours an absolute midnight black with a fluffy two finger brown head that definitely takes its time to die down to a nice layer that lasts throughout. Stickiness is amazing, all over the sides of the glass. Smell, now this is how an Imperial Stout should smell. Sweet toasted oat is what mostly dominates the nose followed by a milk chocolate mixed with brown sugar. A nice roasted nut smell and a tiny hint of alcohol seem to tingle the nose as well. Taste is a bit of a shock. Lots of smokey, pitch black french roast coffee off the tongue first thing followed by a very woody/caramel malt. Finish and aftertaste is a bit sweeter, luckily, with a nice oatmeal and sugar flavor. I really didn't expect the taste of this one to be so smokey. Mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied with minimal carbonation. Big warming sensation while it slides down the throat. Warming comes from the alcohol but it isn't overwhelming by any means. Somewhat tough to finish a bomber by myself, I recommend sharing with a friend."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily for a beer with 9.40% ABV, not as filling as most stouts, excellent representation of style, this is a damn good beer that you could either knock back 2-3 bombers if you’re looking to pound a big stout or just sit back and sip slowly."
"Bottle courtesy of nlmartin, thanks again!"
"Pretty much black with a thin, dark brown head. The fine bubbles showed fair retention and some lacing. Looked pretty thick from the pour. Roasty coffee aroma, rich maltiness, caramel, nuts, chocolate, vinous fruit, and mild alcohol - quite nice. Relatively low bitterness when balanced against the huge caramel character. Roasted coffee flavours sat on the back of the palate, and notes of sour cherry and dark chocolate filled out the middle. Kind of doughy with mild alcohol flavour throughout. Full/heavy bodied with low carbonation, quite creamy and palate coating. A little slick with a bit of of tannin dryness. Very tasty. Well balanced alcohol and solid flavours make this a smooth and easy drink."
"Very good Impy Stout. I would definately buy this again. This will be a regular beer for me once the weather cools."
"from mcallister for my anny bombing"
"Yes! Hoppin' Frog is in South Bend! Pours really dark, black. Walnut colored head. Odor is chocolately, fruity and boozy. Smells fairly inviting and like it has the ability to make me drunk. Taste is a big smack of bitter chocolate and even more bitter coffee. a little harsh, probably a little young. Somewhat of a plummy, pruney taste as well. Velvety and full-bodied and thick. Yeah, its a bit harsh and overly bitter for how i like my RIS, but it might even out a bit with age."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Nearly jet black, opaque, chocolate milk colored head. Hearty aroma of chocolate, oats and roated malts. Huge flavors, like a liquid dessert. Chocolate, dark roasted malts, some coffee. Very sweet at first, but just enough hop bitterness catches up and ends up being well balanced. This brew has layers. Feel is silky smooth, full body, slightly dry finish. Good drinkability despite girth and high abv. Overall, a deliciously heavy beer with bold flavors that ends up just slightly too sweet for Imp Stout perfection."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip. This Imperial stout poured a thick, opaque black color with a one finger thick dark tan head that slowly faded away, leaving behind some excellent lace. The aroma consisted of creamy dark chocolate, vanilla, and some faint molasses notes. A very big, robust aroma. Beautiful!!! The flavor did not disappoint. Very roasty and chocolatey. There are also notes of coffee and spices. The mouthfeel was definately full-bodied and a bit oily. Very minimal carbonation. A very impressive Imperial stout from Hoppin Frog. Highly recommended!"
"Thanks to eyebrews for the recommendation. I would have never thought to pick this up on my beer run to Toledo without him."
"Well this isn't among the best of the RIS, a good try but it just doesn't hide the alcohol very well, even if you compare it to a gross offender like DFH WWS. Not a bad beer but I still prefer Stone RIS to this."
"Good drinkability. This is a big beer, no doubt, but its super tasty and how I like my stouts with its huge roasted and dark character. A bit biting though and while the alcohol is pretty well hidden its effects on the stomach are felt quickly. I would drink this often if it was available to me. A must try."
"Drinkability - a fine imperial stout and a spiffy value to boot."
"Great take on a RIS...love the addition of Oatmeal..makes it very smooth and mellow even fresh."
"D: Im totally digging this brew. Really, really good. Massively complex with awesome dimension."
"Truly a massive beer. Everything's here but the kitchen sink. Ultimately it's not to my taste - I like to preserve my palate for more than just a few sips. But Stone fans and others who want more of everything will enjoy this over-the-top stout."
"One bomber of this is quite a treat in one sitting. Couldn't see having more than that at a time. Deinitely one to share..."
"An excellent big stout here. Best new stout I've sampled in a long while."
"Thick, full body with medium-light carbonation. Very creamy mouthfeel. Nice and smooth, the thickness isn't overwhelming and this is a pleasure to drink."
"Very good RIS all around. Worthy of the high marks it's received. Will definitely try to pick up a few more bombers on my next trip back east."
"Bottle courtesy of Jdoolin: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium dark brown foamy head with limited retention but some nice lacing. Aroma of light chocolate with some subtle coffee notes is quite enjoyable. Taste of black chocolate is sublime with some nice roasted malt and some nice coffee subtle notes. Body is quite full with some medium to low carbonation. Alcohol was not noticeable with some medium sweetness. Cant find much negative on this beer except a bit lacking in complexity to overtake some of my favourite from this style."
"Taste is, as expected, stouty. Malt chocolate notes with some plum and raisin. Malts are well-balanced with a good hop note. Mouthfeel gives a big, thick body, creamy with a light carbonation level. Very easily drinkable for the high ABV. Complexity and flavor make this a fantastic RIS."
"Another hat off for the brew, sent in the Simply Beer BIF from Mike (mcallister)"
"Overall this beer is dangerously drinkable. I don't think I've ever had an ""oatmeal"" Imperial, but I like it."
"Pretty drinkable as far as imperial stouts go, owing to the weirdly light body. I'd be open to try this again and dissect it a little more if the opportunity presents itself."
"D: The high alcohol and big taste is quite enjoyable, but one bottle is all I could handle."
"Thick, full, and robust body gave my throat a kick as it went down. Roasted malt flavors start this out followed sweet caramel and nestle cocoa powder. Oatmeal adds to the smoothness of the body. Coffee beans are subtle, but contribute to the bitterness. Dark fruit notes take on a spiciness and are noticeable in the aftertaste. Finishes quite dry with a good bitterness. A nice imperial stout with an interesting oatmeal twist. High abv goes almost unnoticed. Pick it up if you can."
"D:I enjoyed it but it's definitely nothing special. I have had better RIS and better oatmeal stouts in my day.."
"D- It's ok. Nothing great IMO."
"Drinkability: If you drink the beer cold, you really don't have a problem with it. If you let it sit there to warm up, you're going to be sorry. All the roasted and dark flavors will be there, but you're really going to feel the burn, alcohol burn that is. If you like big chewy alcoholic beers, then this Hoppin' Frog is for you! Will this beer crush like you like the label stated? Not really. It will be the alcohol burn that will do you in and not its dark and roasted flavors."
"Poured from a Hoppin' Frog bomber into pint glasses. The beer was thick and black with a poofy tan & wet head. The aroma was coffee and burnt malts, the flavor was smooth dark sweet malts. Very thick and rich, but still a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Real nice, my first and only imperial oatmeal stout."
"Overall a very good brew and my first from Hoppin' Frog. A very well crafted and well thought-out beer and a perfect example of an RIS."
"Highly recommended."
"Aquired this brew in a trade with mcallister. Thanks for sending me some great beer! Served at cellar temperature into a pint glass. Poured a very deep oily black color that no light could pass through. About two good fingers of tight, thick, bubbly dark brown head formed. Head had pretty good retention. Smell: Wonderful aromas of strong roasted coffee beans, sweet milk chocolate, notes of toffee and caramel rose from the glass. Awesome nose on this one. Taste: Tons of flavor here. Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and some spicey black licorice. All balanced out just about perfectly. Delicious. Mouthfeel was full and thick, with little carbonation. Pretty creamy and complex. I could drink this all day long. Great offering from Hoppin' Frog."
"D: Dunkin' Donuts ought to just serve this, because it's pretty much the greatest iced mocha coffee ever, only it's beer. I almost wish it wasn't 9.4% ABV so I could drink it all night, every night."
"This beer is extremely dark. There is a big mocha colored head that left sticky lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet with a lot of chocolate. It smells a bit like a cappuccino. The taste is not as good as the aroma. It just doesn't taste ""stout"" enough. There is a bit of a Hershey Bar flavor, and some prune or plum like fruitiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, but thin and weak for a stout, much less an imperial stout. The drinkability is better than average. It is pretty strong too!"
"Eric"
"Poured a thick black as night liquid with a huge cream colored head that just did not go down. Very milkshake looking in consistency and took a very long time to settle. I knew immediatly I was about to get my butt kicked by this one. Perfect looking stout. Smell was very sweet, with hints of milk and sugar intermixing with the big players which were coffee and chocolate. Hints of alcohol as well, which at 9.2%abv does not shock me in the least. Had a very dessert like look and smell to it, getting very excited to try this one. Taste was very thick, milkshake like consistency. Big creamy and very smooth going down, definatly made this a dessert beer. Taste again was very sweet, roasted coffee with milk and sugar. Flavors of caramel and chocolate, very rich. Slight warming from the alcohol, but not too bad at all. Very filling and just very very good all around, thats all that really needs to be said. Nice long lingering dry finish capped it off beautifully. This was really a treat and I would never turn it down anywhere at anytime. Really great and I hope to be able to try it again one day."
"22 oz. bottle, 9.4% ABV, 60 IBU. Pitch black in color, no highlights at all. Thick dark tan head settles down quickly to a thin ring. Roasty, chocolate, espresso aroma. A large amount of sweetness is present in this beer. Lots of chocolate, warming alcohol. Some dark fruit and vinous flavors approach near the end. A little silky. Lingering bitterness on the palate. Lower amount of carbonation. Seems a bit thin for the size of this brew. Nicely done by this newer brewery. Certainly worth trying."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The roasted, and chared flavors of this beer is very evident. The finish is earthy and bitter. The beer has a silky smoothness to the mouth. The body of this beer is definately full. This is a very solid Russian Imperial Stout. The beer has been a frequent visitor to my beer glass. I would definately suggest you try this RIS if you like big stouts."
"Finally found some Hoppin' Frog beers in town! Very excited to see it. BORIS stands for Bodacious Oatmeal Russian Imperial Stout. 9.4% ABV, label says 60 IBUs. I drank a 22 oz. bomber of this all by myself - talk about a good night. Pours like motor oil. It's an opaque black with a thick, reddish head. Great retention. Smells sweet: dark toasted malt, oats, caramel, syrup, dark chocolate. Tastes of the dark malt, chocolate, caramel, twinge of alcohol. Very nicely balanced - slightly hoppy finish - the bitterness balances the thick sweetness of it. Mouthfeel is full-bodied to the max. Thick beyond thick. Like drinking a rich chocolate milk. It was a wonderful beer - great example of the style - wonderful for slow sipping on a cold winter's evening."
"This stout has the look and feel of a top-notch imperial stout. The beer clinges to the glass after you take a drink. It's thick and chewy in the mouth. The only thing keeping it from elite status, is the sharp finish. Don't let this little review keep you from drink this. Boris has much to offer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is thick in the mouth, full bodied with little carbonation. Exactly what one expects. I also enjoy the warming sensation of the alcohol as this beer slides down the throat. This is a good beer, but at $7.00 for a bomber its a bit pricey. I probably won't be buying it again anytime soon. Its good but not that good."
"Wow, after my second bottled sampling of this beer, I feel I should rate it. This is the best Imperial Stout ive had in awhile and im esprecially impressed by how good this is at its bright, young age. The color is dark, the darkest beer Ive seen in awhile. Tremendous body. Fairly nice nose. Amazing flavor of chocolate and coffee, but there is also an inordinate, but graceful amount of fruit flavor going on. A really, really good beer!"
"A smooth RIS for sure, a little less alcohol presense would do wonders for the drinkability."
"Fore is tobacco ash, smoke, burnt and roasted malt, black chocolate and bitter burnt malts along with bitter hops. Its fairly brutish. Id prefer some fruit or even mildly sweet chocolate or cream notes. That being said I could see how this would be mothers milk to some palates. Its just not to mine. Its still decent and you can feel the influence of oatmeal in the very creamy mouthfeel."
"the taste is sweeter, but not cloying. NW hop flavor, and the oatmeal evens it all out. this is a tasty brew: well-stacked, well-hopped, well-roasted. all in a nice manageable package"
"Overall impression: A big, full bodied, and chewy beer. A tad underattenuated a bit one-dimensional which makes me wonder if this should be classified as an RIS. Still, it's a good effort overall. I hope this brewery keeps improving."
"Mouthfeel is rich, syrupy, sugary, fruity, with cocoa powder and light chalkiness."
"Smooth and airy, very easy to sip, tempered a bit, again, by some heat from the alcohol that lingers in the mouth and throat. But it is a nice heat, and overall a very nice brew."
"The beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch or so dark brown frothy head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. It smells like roasted malt, coffee, oats and chocolate, very nice. The flavor is good, it tastes like bitter chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit and coffee, and it has a good bitter finish with some alcohol warming too. Mouthfeel is full, it's thick and very smooth. Drinkability is great too, this stout is very easy to drink. Almost as soon as I'm done with my last drink of the beer, I'm ready for another one. I was waiting to get my hands on this beer for a while now, and I'm pretty impressed. Easily one of the best beers I've tried lately, I'd recommend it to anyone. I'll definitely buy more of this."
"I'm floored by Hoppin' Frog. Glad they've showed up. I'll be trying more of their beers from now on."
"~UBS"
"This an absolute must try. I wish they didn't price themselves out of my ""regular"" drinking budget, because there's always something more out there for me to try. This I would go back to if it were cheaper."
"Moutfeel is thick, and chewy. Like velvet on the tongue. Leaves a layer of resiny goodness behind. This beer is so big it would be hard to drink in abundance."
"D: A very nice heavy oatmeal stout. Very similar to Stoudt's Fat Dog Imperial Oatmeal Stout. High alcohol content limits the amount per serving but this beer is dangerously good because it leaves wanting another swig. Good luck to Hoppin Frog! Keep them coming!"
"Kudos to Hoppin Frog for making a solid imperial stout and even more kudos for opening a brewery in my home state of Ohio. We still need a lot more. I'm going to keep my eye on this brewery. If the first lineup they release has an impy this strong, I can't wait to see what they do next."
"D- This beer has a big complex flavor but it is not heavy but the finish makes it light and smooth while still remaining dark black in flavor and smell."
"Overall: A Great Russian Imperial Stout. Very drinkable, be careful though, this one will sneak up on you. I think that the oatmeal provides for a creaminess that you usually don't get from this style of beer. This is now my favorite big stout that I can get in these parts."
"A strong stout lover will love this strong stout. I do. It's big and bold and strong. If you like dark roast coffee, strong and black, I'd bet you'd like this beer."
"Being a hop head this is not normally my beer of choice. This is the best beer Ive had in recent memory!!"
"D: I love it when brewers step outside the box, and I love it even more when their beer is this good. A wonderful brew."
