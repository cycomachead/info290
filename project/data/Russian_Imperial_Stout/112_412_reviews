"I much prefer a sweeter imperial stout (say, Founders Imperial) to a more coffee forward one (like, say, FBS). Old Rasputin falls toward the FBS side.  Strong coffee/roast notes, much lacing, became more enjoyable as it warmed.  A bit of a hop presence if I'm not mistaken.  A solid beer, but there are more enjoyable options out there IMHO."

""
""
"boozy, delicious, affordable, drink with dark chocolate"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, if you like dark beers, this is a significant one to at least try, even if it is too dark for one's taste in the end. For myself, it has rapidly become a favourite. An incredible, luxurious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite beer at my local watering hole great beer on draft"
""
""
"Never fails, very good for the classy sipper who enjoys the taste of craft beer. There are better but like I said, never fails."
""
""
"Man, this is good. That crazy bastard that inspired the name should be proud. The booze is masterfully masked, it's hard to find fault in this brew. When I have customers looking for an Imperial Stout, I direct them to this with no reservations."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a very good beer. Probably not my favorite Russian Imperial Stout, I think there are some better ones out there. In particular, this one was a little too hoppy for me. I want straight massive malty flavor, and for me, any hoppiness in a stout takes away from that. Anyway, definitely worth a try for all stout/imperial stout lovers."
"A very nice Russian Imperial Stout.  The smell is nice a bold.  You get a smoky coffee odor and hints of chocolate.  The big taste has so much going on!  The smoky roasted coffee with chocolate malts and a nice dry mixture of hops.  This is a winner!"
""
"Overall  Another in the robust, leaning to the hoppy side imperial stout. Good job achieving its stylistic aim."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly drinkable. The chocolate flavor works here. And not boozy at all."
"Excellent stout and great beer to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I got a pint of this on tap in San Francisco. The aroma was very satisfying, and paired strongly with the soft foam head that sweetened my first sip. It wasn't too bitter, or overly heavy for a stout, and the dark brown/almost black color was complimented by the continual foaming of the head even after I had finished the first third of the beer. I was very satisfied, and would definitely recommend this beer."
"Perfect head and lacing. Medium bodied with medium flavor. Slight hint of carbonation. Very enjoyable. Frustrating that it is relatively unusual that a solid RIS is available year-round. Might not grab this when certain other ones are in season, but a good one this is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"IMO a perfect blend of coffee, chocolate, and an oatmealish sort of midrange that makes this beer incredibly balanced and drinkable. Warm, boozy feel only adds to how awesome this beer is. I could probably drink a keg in a sitting if only my stomach would allow it."
""

""
""
""
""
"One of the best beers on the planet. I recently had the bourbon barrel aged versions, so good. I sipped and savored. Thick and viscous, great mouth feel, good malt hop balance, chocolate notes, and coffee hints. So good."
""
""
"A perfect stout.  Really a beautiful thing."
""
""
""
"alcohol tasting; mouth feel only adequate"
"Bottle. Started at 56d.  Looked good, but smell and taste were strong alcohol.  Not distinguishing chocolate or coffee to me.  Alcohol tended to dominate.  Mouthfeel is on thinner side, maybe medium.  Creaminess and more thickness would have helped perhaps.  My friend loves this beer and picks up chocolate from it.  I did not and was disappointed based on ratings it has received.  I would much prefer the flavorful and much more balanced Courage or Samuel Smith Imperial Stouts."
""
"An excellent stout.  Aromas are great.  A good hit of alcohol at the end of a sip.  Smooth and almost creamy like an oatmeal stout.  Good job"
""
"Pours very black - black enough to stop the winter sun - with a creamy, two-finger tan colored head. Strong dark-roasted coffee aroma and taste, finishing with notes of bitter cocoa and rye. No doubt their malt is kilned. Alcohol is well hidden by a caramelized, peppery, herbal bouquet. Subtle hints of sour fruit are in there somewhere. A very nuanced stout. Feels just like it looks: full-bodied and viscous with a mere touch of astringency. I can't find anything wrong with this beer. It has a legitimate claim to best in class."
"overall: just a very delicious stout"
"Tremendously enjoyable Imperial Stout. Delicious with that malty, chocolaty taste, great head, wonderful lacing, one to keep in the rotation."
""
""
""
"Wowie zowie, that was good. I wonder how it would taste on tap"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice sweet caramel smell. Good mouth feel. Taste similar to dragons milk but not as complex."
""
""
"Keg of old Rasputin drank (updates)"
"Big, dark, complex, with excellent balance of flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Really nice beer, good balance of flavor, bitter and sweet. Taste and smell are a little dominated by the alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautifully dark opaque black.  Solid stout flavor, not too boozey with a slight bitter finish that lingers.  Fantastic mouth feel"
""
""
""
""
""
"This one was definitely a very nice imperial stout from North Coast but at the same time it wasn't one that managed to blow me away or indeed to live up to the heights of some of the other American brewed imperial stouts that I've tried over the last few months. The beer was highly drinkable despite the strength, although some alcohol was noticeable throughout; an enjoyable beer but just not my favourite of the style."
""
""
""
"Licorice, coffee and chocolate on the nose. Rich coffee, chocolate and dark fruit flavour. No hot alcohol flavours. Excellent"
""
""
"All in all, I would recommend this to anyone who is in for a surprise...and wants to get a buzz."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, alcohol is front and center. Surprised by how prominent this flavor is over oats, dark chocolate, and other notes. A very bitter stout with soapy/carbonated mouthfeel and strong, strong alcohol warmth. Unfortunately, not a stout I would recommend or have again anytime soon :/"
""
"Looked almost like squid ink in the bottle - very impressive indeed. It had a nice bitter coffee, burnt sugary quality in it's aroma. And the smell was very indicative of the taste. Nice, bitter, deep, and full. The mouthfeel was surprisingly bright, considering it's richness. Very well done."
""
"LOVE this beer, the look was black as coal with an awesome tan foam head, taste was incredible, and it went down so easy.  Love everything about it and will buy it many more times in the future."
""
""
"Very surprised by this one! Awesome stuff. Not the biggest RIS fan, but this was fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with huge billowing brown head that held well.  Smells of dates, raisin bread, and chocolate.  Up front it tastes of sweet chocolate and bread pudding.  Has an obvious alcohol taste following with a touch of carbonation and a zing from the alcohol.  Has a bitter aftertaste that leaves the palette begging for another drink."
""
""
""
"Awesome stout second only to Ten Fidy and Dragon's Milk"
"Served at 60 degrees. Slow stiff pour. Frothy, dough like head. An unusually strong tangy flavor of co2 slightly off putting but nice sturdy beer."
"Pours like old motor oil with foamy head that dissipates quickly - splotchy lacing  Lite molasses  nose, Strong coffee taste with moderate bitterness - big flavors all working well, Great non-slimy mouth feel - ok carbonation, Overall a good example of this often overlooked style - not for everyone but I'll take another one"
""
"Top class! There are though better Imperial stouts out there, but I really enjoyed drinking this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the seven wonders of Northern California..."
"Amazing brew.  One to always keep on hand."
"Tasty, but inferior to Narwhal. Dammit."
""
""
""
""
"Had it in a bottle,  no one knows how old it is. Heard it's great on draft."
""
""
"Glass- Snifter"
"Overall - very impressed with this one. i found it nicely complex."
""
"I was expecting a lot more complexity, but really, I think it's kind of bland. I've tasted stouts with a lot more flavor than this, and I've also had stouts that have a much harder alcohol bit than this.  To the reviewers going on about the ""kick in the mouth"" alcohol experience....I really don't experience that, personally.  This is a typical stout.  Maybe some people are just used to drinking light beers?"
""
""
"Yum. Lunch in a glass. This is creamy, hearty, and infinitely enjoyable. The roasted malts dominate the flavor, but everything that is happening here comes together in a wonderful way."
""
""
""
""
"Apparently I'm the only person on the entire first page that's rating this below a 4.0. I certainly buy this on occasion but I don't see the ""world-class"" aspect of it. A bit TOO dry and strong for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fabulous product. If you're up for analogy...Old Rasputin : Guinness :: Vietnamese iced coffee : chocolate milk. It's like a gift from heaven. The description ""jet-black"" is apt both in its positive full-bodied/rich aspects and the mild negative of being a tad oily/boozy. You can buy this at World Market for a very reasonable price considering the premium quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice bitter chocolate, coffee, and yummmmmm. Super easy to drink despite the 9% alc. I'll get again. :)"
"This is certainly one of the great American stouts by reputation, and it lives up to the reputation in my tasting. I have a few more American stouts on my agenda, and then a Guinness Extra for reference."
""

"I bought a 4pk planning on drinking one now and cellaring the other three for a year or two. Its really delicious fresh though, so should I even bother cellaring the other three? I don't think I can go wrong either way. It lived up to its 96 rating."
"Pours black. Smells like roasted toasted malt. Bitter up front. A little bit of chocolate. Super malty. It isn't overpowering in any department. Gets better as it warms up a bit. Good solid balanced beer."
""
"A nice overall Russian Imperial"
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is a great Russian imperial stout. I highly enjoy this and will be picking this up again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"One of my favorite russian imperial stouts."
""
""
"This beer looks amazing. Held up to a light, it's dark as can be. The thick head, with its copper color, contrasts beautifully. Caramel and chocolate aromas and some others I can't quite pin. Plenty to think about with each sip. Mouth feel is nice and creamy, which complements the chocolate flavors. It's like a lightly carbonated mudslide. I give a 4 instead of 5 on taste because I feel it's a tad too bitter. I like bitter but with the chocolate creaminess my tongue goes looking for sweetness, which makes the bitterness come as a shock. Overall, though, I find this a really great beer that keeps my senses engaged from start to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body: Full body with a sweetness at start and great balanced of the bitterness that rounds up the taste.  Just a little carbonation - Perfect!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't pretend to be a connoisseur, but I've had many ales, lagers, pilseners, stouts, porters etc. over the years and OR gets my vote for ""best  overall"" generally available."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm a noob to stouts, but learning fast, just don't love this one as much as so many do.  Sudsy brass head that contrasts nicely to the black body.  It looks fantastic.  I find it a bit thin in the mouth, mostly charred and hoppy.  Plenty of black coffee but I don't find the sweetness and malt.  A very good beer, not world class to me, but I'll definitely give it another shot as I've loved North Coast thus far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Dark brown with tan head dissolving to a lace. Slightly sweet aroma backed by pronounced coffee and molasses. Tastes pretty much like it smells. It starts with a light sweetness on the tip of the tongue, followed by a pronounced coffee and molasses flavor. Slight hint of dark chocolate. Carbonation gives it a balanced feel."

"Note to Self: Ranked #21 best Russian Imperial Stout when I had it"
""
""
""
"Russian Imperial Stouts are my favorite style and this one was just meh to me."
""
"Cery heavy. Love the bitterness. Good thing i had this brew for this ohio winter. Made me feel like rasputin himself."
""
"The perfect chocolate taste in my first stout"
""
""
""
"Excellent beer."

"Price Point - $10.99/4 pack 12 oz bottles"

"Smooth and extremely drinkable stout"
"Great beer, dark, creamy, excellent..."
""
""
""
""
"Good, full body. Great finish"
"Overall a fine beer with rich, traditional stout flavors.  Would drink it again anytime I am looking for a good, strong stout."
""
"In comparison to Narwahl,  not as smooth good caramel taste. Still pretty good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite beer. Dark, but beautiful. Like many Russian Imperial Stouts, it's high in alcohol content. That being said, it's awesome. For a craft beer, it's fairly priced. Definitely worth a try if you haven't!"
""
"Overall: Complex and delicious, I understand why this beer has such a faithful following, and I would definitely purchase this cold weather sipper again. ABV well hidden by the complex flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent from visual, aroma, to mouthfeel and taste.  Bench mark for Imperial stouts."
""
""
""
"O: This is my first Russian Imperial, and I think it is very good. Look forward to trying many more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Old Ras in a glass is always a good call"
""
"Overall: Definitely opens up a lot as it warms - aromas were very stifled at fridge temp. Recommend serving at cellar temp. An all-around winner - no surprises, just a very well-rounded smooth-drinking imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"This has always been an extremely enjoyable beer to sip and savor, and although this is the first time I’ve reviewed it formally, I have been drinking this beer for a decade and have always thought it was an excellent stout. A high recommendation, go get some and enjoy it."
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with a finger width brown foamy head.  No head retention but maintains moderate lacing on the side of the glass.  Aroma of roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate.  You can really taste the dark chocolate malty flavor.  Very smooth, silky taste.  Ends with a bitter coffee taste.  The bitterness retains in the aftertaste.  It is soapy.  A very, very good stout.  One of my favorites."
""
"O: Delicious. Definitely worth trying if your a fan of the style."
""
"It was delicious and creamy. Way better then the bottle. I love this beer of tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with a thick tan head. Smells of dark roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate and some booziness. Head has a nice creamy texture, tastes of coffee, chocolate, dark roast and burnt malts, molasses and a little hop pine.  Heavy body, light carbonation and a coffee/burnt malt aftertaste."
""
"Very opaque dark pour with thin, clingy brown head. Aroma is heavily roasted and coffee notes. Incredibly smooth with barely noticible alcohol - remarkable given the content. Instead, flavors are strongly parrallel to aromas - again with coffee and roasted maltiness. This is delicious. One of my favorites amongst my favorite style."
""
""
"V - Quite hard to find and expensive, but must be experienced at least once within your life time."
""
"""Wow", my literal response to the first sip. Sweet chocolaty flavours erupt upon the palate, giving way to coffee and char. Only after swallowing do the hoppy, bitter flavours that I personally prefer in a breq emerge. It may take a few sips for the true cacao flavours of this one to emerge. I may have to bring this one back to WV with me."
"The alcohol taste is overpowering in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"Unbalanced and overrated. I bet the BA version is outstanding though"
""
""
"Pours a motor oil chocolate brown, very deep. Head is amazing, like the top of a rootbeer float, tan and chunky. Lacing is some of the most amazing I have seen, it is thick and glues itself to the sides of the glass!!. Aroma is of malt, roasted coffee, spice and a hint of chocolate. Taste is bold, with burnt malt/coffee being predominant. Could have used with a little more roast and less burnt. Alcohol is pretty well hidden for a 9% ABV. The undertones of coffee, spice and light chocolate would have been better if it wasn't for the overwhelming burnt bitterness. Ok, I guess it wants to be more, and I am trying, once I get the bitterness off my palate.."

"one of my favorite beers and by far the best imperial stout out there, this beer is very underrated"
""
""
""
"Velvety milk-like mouthfeel, medium coffee flavor with well balanced burnt malt...bitterness doesnt linger...a rich smooth stout with weight and flavor but doesnt knock you over like some"
""
""
"I will be picking this one up again."
""
""
"Not very full bodied. Good taste but feel was off."
""
""
""
""
"The head has an incredible creamyness akin to the feel of a rootbeer float. Coffee and chocolate flavors, with a smoothness and satisfying aftertaste. One of my favorites."
""
"so close to perfect. It's dark and complex, bitter, good mouth feel. Some day I would like to make a beer very similar to this one. I don't expect anyone to improve upon it. Oddly enough I don't like anything else I've had from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
"A bit to strong of a bite in the beginning very pleasant flavors in the middle  coffee, hops, something else I cant put my finger on, the after taste is almost unpleasantly bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
"First taste was poured from draft (nitro) a couple weeks ago, and while it was very good I just don't prefer the flat feeling of a nitro beer so I held off on rating until I could try the original version. I enjoy the feel of carbonation. I later found it again, regular draft, and it was absolutely delicious. I would go so far as to say it's of the best year-round Russian Imperial Stouts I've had to date. A must try if you have not already."
""
"My favorite beer on the planet PERIOD......  Everything about this beer is top notch. I was fortunate enough to work for a distribution company that carried North Coast products. One taste of Rasputin and I was hooked. My only issue is that it only comes in 4 packs :)"
"Overall: Great stout. Best if you enjoy a combination strong malts & coffee, with a little bitterness from the hops. I will buy this again."
""
"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Snifter. 12/30/14."
"Nice thick oatmeal head onto a dark opaque brown nearly black. Nice lacing. I have had this on nitro as well as from bottle, as it is here. At first I felt I picked up almost a marshmallow/caramel aroma on the nose but that dissipated; It's a nice chocolate/coffee with only a hint of smoke. Everything is relatively subtle for a big beer like this; not overly sweet or smokey or boozy. Pretty much spot on for what you want in a impy stout."
""
""
""
"on nitro, remember liking this more"
""
""
"Overall:  Lives up to the hype, in my estimation (such as that is).  The relatively high ABV kinda sneaks up on you - you don't notice it at all for the first half a glass, but you definitely don't want to chug one before heading off to do anything requiring good coordination!"
""
""
""
"I'm sure this beer isn't really that bad in other people's opinions and I understand why. It has a good taste, and smell just seems to have an overwhelming taste of hops and as someone who isn't a fan of hops that killed my rating."
"This beer was absolutely splendid and a great example of an imperial stout having a thick, lowly carbonated mouthfeel, and a taste and smell full of coffee and dark cocoa notes.  Though I did detect some dark fruit in the nose, possibly fig or plums, cocoa and coffee dominated on the palate, which worked well with the mouthfeel, if I tasted this blindly, I could easily believe it to be an oatmeal stout, all in all an exceptional stout, highly recommended."
"Distracted by so many other imperial stouts (and because I live in a primarily warm climate) I haven't had Old Rasputin in several years until this cold and drizzly night and boy, has he not changed a bit. A big, dark chocolate bar of a beer that will knock you flat if you aren't paying attention. The head is still beautiful and thick and smells like the best cup of coffee you wish you could have after you finished."
""
""
"sweet elixir..."
""
""
"Smell of deep chocolate, mocha and smooth oats all blended together.  Khaki head that looks like it could float a quarter on top.   The mouth feel is unbelievable for a beer with this much ABV and a RIS.  Smooth as smooth can get.  Taste is superb and very subtle alcohol.  By far one of the best RIS I have had...so glad I finally tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm only giving this 4.75's because its not THE best stout I've ever had, but it's pretty close. I wish I could give it 4.99 stars. It has a nice dark head, and a delicious complex flavor that never lets you down. We always have some in our fridge!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Always my go to imperial stout..black as motor oil nice amount of carbonation and tastes like a chocolate espresso bomb...at 9 bucks a 4 pack its almost always in my fridge.."
""
""
""
"My favorite beer. Rich, dark imperial stout, bitter with hints of coffee & chocolate. So dark brown  that you can't see through it if held up to a bright light. Great stuff."
""
""
"Very dark almost oil black color, just a little brown in it. Very dark coffee taste. Love it. Bitter taste is strong at the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer.  A bit of alcohol on the finish, but it is a imperial stout.  Deep brown/black color.  Thick beer. Taste of coffee, chocolate and malt."
""
""
""
"Lots of roasted malts in this one, leaves you with some bitterness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure how I managed to join Beeradvocate in 2010, and am only getting around to drinking this fantastic brew just now. Oh well, I enjoyed it on tap this evening, and it was quite delightful. I have elected to forgo my normal review narrative, because frankly, it's all been said. This is a beer truly deserving of it's world class rating. I'd be interested in aging this one, or giving the barrel aged version a go. Glad to recommend this brew. Cheers!"
"Normal look for a stout.  Strong roasted sweet smell.  Great toasty malt taste with a dark chocolate taste.  Medium heavy body with the same amount of carbonation and creamy.  Great russian imperial stout"
""
""
"Called Old Rasputin"
""
""
"This has a power punch of an aroma on it, with a great big rummy-booze kick that blends with the dark chocolate, and a touch of a smooth French roast. It’s big and bold on the palate as well, with some of that dark chocolate and rounded roasty goodness. And so accessible."

""
""
"My first Old Rasputin and didn't know what to expect.  I had this at a little Mexican restaurant in Staunton, VA (a hidden gem in my opinion) with lunch, but will definitely try this beer again; highly recommended.  This beer was extremely easy drinking given the 9% ABV"

"Easily found everywhere in MI and what a treat that is. If you're entering the stout game, begin here. Excellent beer, great price, great availability (in MI, not sure about elsewhere). The 98 is a good representation of this beer."

"O - Old Raspy delivers a robust RIS experience, without barrels.  It uses fairly robust hopping, to great effect, and avoids the mistake of some hoppy stouts by fully integrating the hop into the stout elements of roasted malts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - high quality brew, though I have a few others higher on my list."
""
""
""

"Old Rasputin is one of my go-to beers and one of the (several) reasons I first fell in love with North Coast. A potent, heady, mysteriously drinkable warmer."

"12 oz bottle.Poured a very dark brown.Smell is a light coffee unsweetened chocolate.Light licorice.Taste is coffee and some bitterness.It wasn`t bad but I would not say it was better than say Ten-Fidy or Imperial Russian Stout from Stone.But it worth a try. World class I just don`t see it."

"O: [4.00] Very night flavor profile with chocolate and smoke.  The 9% ABV is well hidden.  The mouthfeel was the only thing that wasn't in the great range is is a little more carbonated and prickly than I expected.  Overall this is a really good beer.  Well crafted and nice to sip on."

"Appearance. Oil dark with thick small beaded tan head..          aroma.  Dark fruit  sweet molasses.                                                    Taste .    Very sweet up front followed by very slight bitter fruit and leave a the palate with a Kona coffee taste.                                               Overall. This beer is now in my solid rotation which is a few select  beers ..This made me fall back in love with      American craft beer after a long Belgium stretch"

"I've had this beer many times.  When it is available on nitro, it's really hard for me to choose anything else.  It pours nearly pure black with a tan head.  The retention and lacing are excellent.  The aroma is delicious - coffee and cocoa with floral hops adding complexity.  The flavor lives up the nose.   It's an explosion of coffee and cocoa malts with a great hop presence that balances the sweet malt.  It finishes with a mild bitterness of coffee and floral hops.  Really complex flavors.  The body is  medium-full with a real smooth creaminess on nitro.  I'm a huge fan of this beer."

""
""

"Pours almost jet black, with the slightest dark brown hue.  The head rises quickly, frothing into a dark tan.  The aromas are overwhelming in a great way: cocoa, roasted malts, and coffee come through the strongest.  The malts smoothly hit the palate first, followed by the balanced hops and malts.  An oaky finish has a tinge of a tobacco taste, followed briefly by notes of espresso and dark chocolate.  Truly an exceptional beer!  Although it sounds counter intuitive with the coffee/espresso flavors, this is a great bedtime brew.  The best RIS out there, IMHO."

"Fantastically well structured and largely well balanced. Lots of intense flavors that work well together to produce an overall pleasurable drinking experience. It's certainly not a quaffing beer; this one is just right for sipping and savoring."
"Forgive me North Coast but blending this in a Black & Tan w/ something like an Stones Arrogant Bastard is a present day highway to hell. Perilous adventures await."
"Overall - This is exactly what I'd expect in a Russian imperial stout save for the coppery character, which seems like it might be a glassware problem or something. Old Rasputin is to the Russian imperial stout as Sierra Nevada is to the pale ale; it's just a great representation of the style."

"The brothers say, ""not for the faint of heart", but for this style, remarkably easy drinking, as all the wood, chocolate, coffee, etc is mitigated by an overall delicate refinement, belied by the chunky head clearly visible through the dark bottle.  Really, the overriding aftertaste is something of fruit, though the bitterness is pronounced as well, the hops probably preserving the taste, as it tastes like it was bottled yesterday.  But the bitterness as with everything is perfectly calibrated, not too much, not too little.  So much more refined and unobtrusive, than say Guinness,  but ironically more intense than Guinness (how does that work).  Hard to fathom how something this perfectly calibrated originated in America."
""
""
"I really believe this beer is one of the best hybrids of availability, cost, and flavor in the stout class. It tends to be easy to find, and it is also usually one of the cheaper options among the legitimate stouts. I often find myself reaching for a pack of Old Rasputin to pair with traditional meat and potatoes type meals, and I will continue to do so as long as they keep brewing this excellent Russian Imperial Stout."

"A joyful cup of coffee, this one. Like many of this ilk, it does better with some temperature control: improves as it warms. Malts develop well, not too sweet. Bitterness is appropriate for the roast. Higher ABV masked by the depth of flavor, thus caveat emptor."

"Bottle poured into glass.  The best lacing I have ever seen.  Completely surrounds the glass and retained throughout.  The head is super thick and creamy, it is a brown color.  The beer itself is black. The aroma knocks you back with strong roasted malt, burnt, coffee.  The taste is fantastic from start to finish.  Powerful roasted malt, coffee, molasses, caramel.  Creamy and chewy in the mouth.  Full bodied, complex but balanced sweetness and bitterness.  One of the best beers I have ever had, and possibly the best Russian Imperial Stout."

"This is a tremendous imperial stout. That being said, it is a little lacking in the hoppiness that characterizes most of these beer types, and it could use a little more of that. Otherwise, it's all quite solid. It pours pitch black with a small tan head that sticks around for quite a long time. It smells mostly like chocolate. The taste is similar. The overwhelming flavor in this beer is of chocolate. The mouthfeel is a little sticky and smooth, very pleasant. Overall, this is a world-class RIS that I would highly recommend to anyone."

"12 oz bottle, poured in a chalice glass.  Pitch black, hardly any amber under the light.  Smells strongly of alcohol, but the taste is smooth.  No coffee taste here.  A trace of floral and spices combined with a chocolate roasted malt flavor and a smokey, bitter finish with a pleasant aftertaste.  One of the better stouts I've tasted.    Top notch."

"This is one of my favorite beers overall, and probably my favorite by appearance. Poured into a nonic pint glass, giving me a deep midnight black color with a lovely, two finger, tan-colored head that lasted until the beer was about halfway gone. Had quite a prevalent espresso aroma and taste with some very light hints of hazelnut and licorice. Being a 9%, the alcohol was present in the taste, but definitely not overwhelming, giving it a pleasant, warming feel down the throat. Definitely a highly respectable, top-ranking beer."

"The appearance is the most memorable aspect of this beer for me. Especially on tap, it really exemplifies what I feel an imperial stout should look like. The body is black as night and the head is beautiful and creamy, with a tint of dark red/purple. That tint in the foam is one of the most telling signs for me. Loved this beer: dark, creamy, malty, and delicious. One of my top five beers currently. Highly recommended for any and all stout lovers."

"One of the better examples of this style, Old Rasputin is one of the best price/quality beers around. While I have been underwhelmed by the rest of North Coast's offerings, this beer is truly excellent. Deep, dark colors and an appropriate bloom and lacing. Notes of chocolate, raisins, and prune are present but not overwhelming. Definite notes of iron, but pleasantly used. I have had it on tap and in the bottle several times. Gives KBS and Bourbon County a run for their money."

"First time trying old Rasputin. Poured very dark brown though not black with tan head that died fairly quickly leaving a lot of lacing. Great aroma of coffee and leather. Mouthfeel is perfect, crisp. This is a really well balanced stout. Taste definitely has chocolate and coffee notes but mostly just delicious malts. Not over poweringly anything but delicious beer."

"Pours a beautiful dark black with brown highlights. Hefty head of mocha chocolate color, can't wait to drink it. The smell is of a heavy roast from the malt, a touch of chocolate, some dark fruits, and a bit of char. You get all this chocolate, the heavy roast switches to blackened charred and smoked meats, raisins, and ends with a sweet wash almost like maple syrup or brown sugar. Great super medium mouthfeel. Letting it just lay on your palate giving off the flavors and your ready to drink."

"Heard a lot of good things about this beer, and it did not disappoint. The appearance is near-perfect. The beer is night-black with an off-white head of about two-finger widths. It leaves a nice lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is robust, full of chocolate and roasted barely. The taste is equally robust. At first sip, the overwhelming taste was of dark chocolate, but as I drank it, roasted coffee came to the forefront. There is just a hint of alcohol, but nothing that would suggest the 9% abv. There was also a certain sweetness that I lingered on the tongue along with a mild hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was rich and creamy with a modest carbonation. Overall, this beer is outstanding on every level."

"overall: Old Rasputin is a nice, big imperial stout. I usually don't drink beers this big, and was surprised by how long it took to finish a bottle. The flavors are well balanced and it's not gonna wreck your palate, but having two in a short time period will definitely knock you off your donkey. Not exactly a beer you'd have at a party, but it's good sipping during a movie or reading a book (it will take half the movie to finish)."

"Pours pitch black with a magnificent head. Lacing and retention are also outstanding. The nose is sweet dark chocolate, roast and hints of dark fruit and smoke. Almost full bodied with a very smooth, almost creamy, texture. Borderline normal carbonation level with just a touch of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is well balanced and a bit complex, but not as complex as FIS or Wulver. It begins with sweet dark chocolate which flows into a roast and hop bitterness. The middle has a molasses note. The finish is smooth and leaves you with an alcoholic burn at the back of the throat that lingers quite long. Less hops would allow the dark fruit flavor to materialize and add to complexity."

"I have not tried very many examples of this type of stout because it has just not been generally available in my area. It would definitely not be my first choice in terms of a stout- I think I prefer the sweeter types. It's definitely a big beer, not meant to be guzzled down, and with some bitterness that may be overwhelming at first. I can certainly imagine some 19th century imperial Russkis quaffing this stuff down though..."

"On nitro-tap at The Engine Room. Pours a dark brownish black color with a huge creamy head over an inch thick lots of lacing. The aroma is lots of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Earthy.The taste is dark chocolate and bitter black coffee at first followed by the roasted malts and some hints of smoke. More bitter dark chocolate towards the end with nice roasted notes. Moderate alcohol presence. Velvety and creamy mouthfeel from the nitro. Overall, outstanding Russian Imperial Stout."

"I have to say, I love beer that fills the pallet. If I can see through it, I may not want to try it if I'm not familiar with it. My first experience with Imperial Stout was not a pleasant one. It was harsh and bitter. I shied away from such things until I discovered Old Rasputin. It's not harsh at all. I fills the pallet with all the flavors and notes I enjoy. It's not a beginners beer by any means. You have to really love the fullness and complexity that comes with such brews. It's not something I could drink one after the other for extended periods, but prefer to alternate between this and 90 Minute Imperial IPA from Dogfish Head."

"A truly unique and amazing imperial stout. The sharp taste is a perfect balance of alcohol, coffee and hops. This beer is at or near 40 deg (Black) with a perfectly thick head. This beer is probably one of the most drinkable and enjoyable imperial stouts you will ever have the pleasure of drinking. Now let me get back to my sixer :)."

"Served in a glass, it pours a nice black beer. Has a bit of a foamy head. Smell is not very strong, but you get coffee and malts. Taste is straightforward, dark imperial stout. It is a bit more bitter than the usual stouts, with coffee and malts. Mouthfeel is light."

"This is my third offering in a tasting of Russian Imperial Stouts. This one pours a deep near black mahogany with a large and thick tan head that gives way to a nice film and substantial lacing. The nose is lighter than expected with the expected notes of coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, and dark caramel. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but lighter than the pour and nose make one expect. It is medium bodied and coats the mouth in a most enjoyable and satisfying way without being thick and sticky. The flavor is a wonderful blend of dark cacao, roasted coffee, and sweet caramely malts. This is a damn well crafted beer and it is very understandable why it is one of the benchmarks of the style. This is the first of my four way tasting that I feel is perfect now and doesn't need any age on it."

"Overall, not one of my favorite stouts. I guess it's because I prefer my stouts to have more of a chocolate or coffee taste to them. The Old Rasputin Stout reminded me more of a stout mixed with a nice Belgian Ale. It's still tasty, and the high alcohol content will give you a nice buzz. But I just didn't care for the fruit / raisin notes."

"An OK brew but too aggressive and unbalanced and not malty enough to be a great stout IMHO. This brewery can produce some intriguing beers (Pranqster) but this one is too over the top. A better example of this style would be Zywiec Porter. Sometimes less *is* more."
""
""
""
""
""
"The overall impression is a great balance between big, roasted malt, moderately high hop bitterness and ethanol."

"Overall: This was my first from North Coast Brewing, and a good choice to get my 'foot in the door'. To any die-hard fans of Imperial Stouts: make this a staple in your collection. Personally, I may need to revisit this one after a while because while it is good, I was not entirely impressed - particularly in terms of flavor/mouthfeel. But as stated above, if you love Imperial Stouts: get it and enjoy!"

"This is a textbook perfect example of a RIS. Dark and beautiful in color, nice beige head, amazing smell, perfect mouthfeel. I loved the coffee notes and the dryness, perfectly hopped with what I assume to be KEG (something english for sure). My only negative is that it was a little boozy for 9%, where I have tasted smoother stouts with a higher ABV. Regardless, that's just a personal preference and this is an absolutely amazing representation of the RIS style."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: All the flavors and aromas are there, I just wish they were kicked up a few notches, and I would like this even more. That put aside, Old Raspy is still one of my favorite year around offerings!"
""
"Pours black with a large, lively, khaki-colored head comprised of large bubbles. Good retention and generous lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, raw cocoa, oat, vanilla, and some campfire smoke. There are hints of cane sugar and plum. It tastes of roasted marshmallow (emphasis on the roast), chocolate, oat, vanilla, smoked malt, and some vanilla. The finish seems to be a subtle battle between sugar and grain notes. Mouthfeel is superb; thick and roasty with a palate-coating viscosity. A rich, moist finish. Overall, this is an excellent RIS that is made superb by its availability and affordability."

"Wow. What a great beer. Dark, heavy stout that's not overpowering. As dark as the come with a thick coffee color head. I used a tulip glass that released the aromas of hops and coffee. The flavors coat your mouth with hops coffee and cream with just a hint of chocolate. I may have a new favorite stout!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from nitro bottle into pint glass. Dark black with a brownish tan head. Smells like chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is thick and pleasent. Taste is Coffee, chocolate and a warming alcohol presence to finish it off. One of my favorite stouts, a great beer for a cold winter night."
""
"O: I probably have to try the regular bottle or tap to see for certain. Given some of the Imperial Stouts I've had, this is missing some bite. However, in my experience one can question how the nitro affected it. That said, I could probably get in trouble drinking a few of these down quickly and smoothly."

"Poured into...a steel mug while camping. I have drunk it from the bottle, in a tulip glass, and from a water glass. It is consistent in that it stays one of my favorite beers, and probably the best stout I have ever drunk. Pours dark and rich. Very boozy, has a deep flavor of coffee, chocolate, and stout. Pretty much the king of stouts...try it for yourself."

"Overall this is renowned for it's great price point and year-round availability. Definitely the best RIS that is year-round, present everywhere, and $10/4pack. It doesn't compare to the world-class RIS's that I've had the pleasure of drinking, but I would drink this any day of the week with a smile on my face, and save some time and money while I was at it. Pick up a 4-pack with no reservations."
""
"O - Delicious as always. I love the strong bitterness i get from the coffee and dark chocolate and the mild alcohol warmth that comes on at the end. It isn't too intense, but just right. One of my favorite RIS. I get it every year around my birthday to cellar so i can do a nice vertical on my bday. This beer is both delicious fresh, and aged for a couple years."
"Будем здоровы"
""
"O - Another eye-opening imperial stout. My second this week. At one time I held off on this beer due to 4-pack quantity and perceived high price. Those reasons have since been swept away. Truly a delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark with a thin brown head. Most of the darker beers I've tried had very intense flavors of dark fruits and overpowering aromas, so I was surprised that this one wasn't so strong at first. The bitterness is very obvious but not unpleasant, and as you sip you can taste more coffee and dark bread flavors. Mouthfeel is not too thick, good for the taste. Definitely recommended."

"O: Really like this beer a lot. It's complexity is what sets it apart. The flavored change dramatically 3 times."
"O- This is an amazing beer! It is supremely complex and exceptionally balanced. Each smell and taste is a touch different than the last. I'm so overwhelmed by details, I'm having problems finding words. One thing I can say is that I tried this when I first got into craft and didn't dig it at all. To those just starting out, if you try it and don't like it, please give it another try 1-2 years down the road. You'll be impressed."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Aggressive pour gives a beautiful creamy head. Smell: Roasty, chocolate, coffee, malt. Not very boozy smelling but it's there. Taste: You can taste it before it even touches your mouth. Much like you'd expect from the smell. Roasted malt, coffee, chocolate up front. The booze comes in towards the end. The alcohol burn left behind is just right. It's rated up there with one of my favorite stouts."

"Mouthfeel - Full bodied creamy beer with light bubbles. Excellent on the palate - 5.0"
"Overall, this is one of the best RISs: great flavor, nice aroma, perfect lingering mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"A standard among stouts, Old Raspy doesn't disappoint. It's not thick and rich and chocolatey like some of the in vogue stouts, and it doesn't have a bourbon bite. That said, it embodies the basics of what a solid stout should: dark malty character, burnt coffee bite. I look forward to having the rest of the pack with some age on them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Since this RIS seems a touch one-dimensional to me--essentially a roasted mixed nut iced coffee, I'm happy to drink it as or with dessert in cooler months. But, despite the reputation, I don't think this particular brew stands alone as a superior representative of the style. It's very good, but doesn't make my day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the best stout I've had in a while -- I found myself wanting to spend more time decoding the various scents. I'd stock up on this -- if you can find it."
""
""
""
""
"Final results: Definitely one of my favorite imperial stouts. I love how it does not have a burnt flavor and instead the malt has a ""grilled"" like character. the coffee and chocolate work beautifully although the roastiness is the star. Definitely would drink again but too many beers out there that I need to try. Not hoppy but just enough hops so that there isn't too much sweetness. A plus for me."
""
"I've had this beer a handful of times. On tap, in bottle, on nitro. Every time I know ordering that it's a classic but I am continually impressed. If you like stouts this is a must try. North Coast sets the bar and sets it high with this one. Smooth smooooth drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rating: 9.6"
"O: After engaging in some debauchery with old Rasputin, I can say I’m up for round two. This is an excellent stout for wintertime drinkin’. This was recommended to me by a rando in my local beer distributor, and I’m glad I took him up on it. A must try as far as imperial stouts are concerned. Until we meet again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A very good imperial stout, but not quite as full bodied and full flavored as some other imperial stouts. Yet, this still has a lot going for it such as its balance between chocolate and coffee, its drinkability (no alcohol noticeable), and the price point ($9). (89/100)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I do not enjoy Stouts, but this is close to a perfect example of an Imperial Stout. Chocolate, Coffee, Nuttiness, and bitterness close to 70% Cocoa Dark Chocolate. Creamy feel in the mouth. It is smooth with a bite. If you enjoy Stouts this is for you. Try it with Oysters. If you are like me and do not like stouts, just eat the oysters."

"If I could afford it, I would drink this every single day. Easily my favorite beer of all time.Bread read, raisins, chocolate, coffee, spices, and the perfect boozy finish are enough to make this beer seem like a staple food. The only other brew I could compare to Old Rasputin is Sierra Nevada Narwhal. But since that one is harder to find, I stick by my claim of this being the best beer in the world."

"I am not usually a stout fan. I told my friend at the liquor store to get me something i have never tried, as i always do. He came back with my growler telling me it was Old Rasputin. Apparently being a a Russian Imperial Stout to my dismay. I was SOOOO wrong. This beer was so complex. It had a wonderfully aromatic head, leaving a fine dotted lacing along the sides of my glass. The taste was dark espresso, milk chocolate, and almost burnt tasting malt. By burnt i mean a smokey taste. I found myself entranced by the the beer settling back through the head after a sip. You could watch the almost black liquid fall through the caramel head making fine swirls. Being 9% ABV was defiantly a plus as well. I don't like a beer unless it knocks me on my ass. Well, overall i will defiantly be getting this again, and maybe changing my opinion on stouts as a whole."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"I am surprised at the varying tastes/appearance etc... of Imperial Russian Stouts. This experience was definitely a good one. A very good rich stout that pour nice and dark with very little head. There is very little fragrance with this pour so the taste will need to make or break this review. Well, it made it. A very tasty stout that does not linger too long in the mouth. Very drink-able and well worth the purchase."

""
"Brew pours a pitch-black in color. with a good 2-finger foamy beige head. Lots of sticky lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted malts with a hint of toffee and coffee for the most part. The taste is about the same with a stronger alcohol slightly hoppy dark espresso finish with a hint of cocoa BUT didn't last at all. NOT really sweet either though. A good sipping brew and NOT a chugging one. Medium+-bodied with perfect carbonation. A tasty brew overall"

"Very nice on a cool fall/winter evening or as a night cap."
"Nice dark stout. Nice dark color and the taste is neutral. Only the slightest of sweetness. Good flavor with just the right amount of carbonation. Enjoyed this. Nothing really stood out as being exceptional to me except that the high ABV really gives you a nice wack."
"Poured completely black with a nice tan head. Smelled roasty, almost smokey. Tasted great. Lots of dark malt notes, well balanced slightly bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is lacking compared to the rest of the characteristics of this beer. It was a bit syrupy imho. The 9% abc was well hidden as well. I will be buying this one again soon."

"I'll start off by saying that I am a huge fan of super dark beers, and that I know that it is not everyone's favorite type. That being said, this is one of my favorites. Especially for a beer that is easy to acquire year round here in CT. The pour is great with pitch black liquid and a nice brown head. The profiles of coffee and dark chocolate are very strong and give a great aftertaste. I love pairing this beer with red meats, although I drink this alone quite a bit. North Coast is a great brewery with an eclectic selection but this will probably remain as my favorite of theirs for some time."

"Old Rasputin on tap at Zeitgeist. smell of coffee and roasty malt, taste is super creamy with a thorough bitterness and dark malt with toffee sweetness toward the end, great balance and drinkability. This is so creamy and smooth for the strength, no perceptible alcohol just a rich full bodied stout, light creamy carbonation and lots of rich roasty flavor. Keeps a creamy head till the end. Not much bad to say about this beer, tons of rich balanced flavor, great character. Would definitely have again."
""
""
"Like I said, pretty new to stouts. I like this beer especially on a day like today, raw and cold. I'll certainly go for this again and it seems to have opened me up to more than the ipa/dipa that are usually my go to's"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good, always enjoy these, but the time definitely changed this beer. Whisky-like characteristics are emphasized a lot more, and the roasted malt notes have been subdued in favour of a powerful boozy bitterness. A dangerous beer."

"Looking at this beer, for what it is (an imperial stout) - I have had no better example of the type. The alcohol is noticable, and gives quite the kick to the balls on the initial sip- but the flavor of it is rounded out with complexity, showing malts (perfectly balanced in the beer), spices, and chocolate. The flavor is SO complex and dense I am at a loss for descriptions trying to do it justice. Add to this the silky, creamy goodness that makes you want to keep sipping. The creaminess on this beer is so remarkable, that I can't think of anything I have ever had that compares. The only detraction might be that its heavy in notcing the alcohol in the flavor- but its an imperial stout, so this beer ends up being everything it should be."
""
""
""
"O - Phenomenal and highly recommended. Can't wait to try barrel-aged version."
"O- Lovely brew to have any time in the winter. It's fairly straightforward, yet with delightful complexity that continues to invite you for another sip."

"Overall - This is one of the pioneers of the style, and it's not lacking in flavor or complexity. Still, there are a better RIS out there now. As an intro to the style, this is a great place to start."

""

"O- A great lighter RIS. At 9% the alcohol is not overwhelming but the big roast and dark chocolate flavors are there. This is a great beer in that it is very easy to find as well as being all year and at a very reasonable price for a RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely a drinker an excellent representation of the style."
""
"Notes: Poured from a 12 oz bottle. 4-pack of 12oz bought for $8.99 in Oregon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent Imperial Stout. It's a classic for a reason."
"Very well done, was lucky enough to enjoy this in front of the fireplace on chilly night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great looking bottle. Bought it using the beer advocate rating system. Pours very beautifully. Has a sweet chocolaty and caramel element in the smell. As far as taste; very smooth, velvety. The high alchohol content is very well hidden. A new favorite indeed!"
""
""
"Overall: 5 This is simply indescribable. There are too many strong flavors combining and re-combining for me to adequately describe them here. I just put short snippets of what I could, but it's simply the best stout there is. A drink that must be savored, slowly letting your mind wander to wherever the flavors take you. It's incredible. If you like stouts, this is the best one there is. A must-try."
""
""
"Overall - It is an amazing Russian Stout, if it where cheaper I would get it more."
""
""
"Pitch black with a thick, creamy, ugly brown head. By ugly I mean beautiful, of course. Aroma is smoked wood, roasted coffee, vanilla, chocolate, burnt sugar--and maybe I'm just fantasizing here, in a Rasputin trance, but I pick up a faint, savory aroma that reminds me of bacon in the oven. Thick and syrupy with an acidic bite at the end that whispers ""sip some more, sip some more!"" Smokey, sweet, burnt, complex, chocolate, wood, hints of spice even (nutmeg & cinnamon). This has been and continues to be my go-to Imperial Stout. Others might be stronger but none hit me the way Old Rasputin does, even after all these years. Seems like a lot of people agree."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorites, I call it ""Old Reliable"" just for fun. I am reviewing this for the serving type ""on-tap", however I have had it bottled as well, and it never let's me down in either form. Very rich flavor, with a smooth after taste (not pruny tasting). Highly recommended for all, even if you don't care for Stouts."

"It’s a classic and it's awesome. One of the best Russian Imperials out there, and maybe one of the first to receive widespread acclaim and distribution in the North American beer market."

" I wanted something to chew on tonight, and got it with this fine malt. All I can picture is this brew coming out of a old dark stained sticky cask on a whaling ship. I believe I have taken a hour to finish this pint. It lingers on the tongue like a cigar from the night before, in a good way. Spectacular."

"Sampled at the Farmers Cabinet in Philly. Off nitro this beer is untouchable. Massive two finger head blends slowly and beautifully. I've had it from a standard tap and a bottle but nitro is a whole other experience. Body is silky smooth and creamy. I've encountered lots of beer and very few can be considered perfect; this is one that can. A+"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel on this beer is fantastic, super smooth and full bodied. It's delicious even cold. Hides the alcohol very well with a mild bitterness . I wish this is what all imperial stouts tasted like. Just a comforting beer you want to keep drinking."

""
""
""

"Great after dinner with cheese."

"Just an amazing beer- especially considering the price ($8.99 where I am) and year-round availability. Black as Rasputin's heart with a lovely tan head. Foamier than most RIS. No strong scent - just mild hints of caramel and coffee. These two flavors are distinct in the taste though. Serve this puppy pretty warm - cold it tastes boozy but at 50-55 degrees that goes away and the beer is silky smooth. I do like a few other RIS's more but this is the best year-round version. A true classic."

"Overall this is a bold and powerful stout with a great blend of flavors. If you love chocolate then give this a try. Be warned, the alcohol taste might make your hair stand on end but I can't fault this brew too much for that."
""
""
""
""

"O: One of the best RISes out there and perhaps the best value of them all. Wonderfully complex flavors without any fluff. No barrel aging, no adjuncts. Just various roasted malt characteristics all flung together in a surprisingly balanced manner. Aging has mellowed this, zero alcohol is present and the flavors are all well integrated and smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wonderful appearance and inviting aroma. Taste is just a little harsh on the palate at first but smooths as the beer warms. The alcohol isn't masked much. Still, a nice palette of flavors makes for a complex beer. Great RIS for the price point."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured into a pint glass."
""

""

"This review will be far from the norm, and doesn't reflect bad on the beer, but my own taste. I do respect this beer for its amazing scores, style, complexity... But with all that being said; I couldn't finish my glass. I tried this beer at the Yardouse with a friend. I hate bitterness, I like smooth, complex, deep, slight hops, lots of malt, type beers. Aboslutely way to bitter for me. I try and finish every beer, even if I don't like it, because I want to be sure I don't like it. I left half of a pint glass with this and the Yardhouse bartender gave me a refund. Not MY cup of tea."
"O- Fantastic beer for the price, I picked up a couple packs after my first taste, this one will be a regular in my beer fridge. Very glad I picked it up and most defiantly recommend to everyone that likes dark beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a dark coffee color and, once in the glass, shows opaque black with a persistent and frothy beige head with nice lacing and variation in bubble size. Arresting aromas of coffee, chocolate, and baking spice; it trends a bit on the sweet side and maybe could use a little more roasted malt in the background but that's gilding the lily. The aromas carry through to the palate with more malt presence there, which gives some grip to this and prevents it from being flabby or cloying. Nice effervescence and somehow an easy to handle medium bodied mouth feel despite the intense aroma and flavor. Delicious."

"i saw the word 'wow' in more than one review and i agree completely. took me a while to get around to trying this but it will definitely be on my regulars list from now on. understand, i only gave this beer a 4.75 b/c i don't believe the 'perfect' beer exists...but this is VERY close. i am typically an ale guy but really like the stouts. as far as i'm concerned this moved past my favorite ales. just an overall satisfying experience. northcoast has got something going on for sure...i was already a fan of brother thelonious."

"Overall: This has quickly become my go to Imperial Stout. This is my first beer from North Coast, but if Old Rasputin is any indication, I will happily be buying more from them in the future. (4.25)"
"O - 4.50 - Great go to imperial stout. If I was going to introduce friends to the genre of Imperial Stouts I would start with this. The best Imperial Stouts I've had would be Stone's Espresso RUssian Imperial Stout and Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, and this doesn't make it up to their level, but it is a great value for the price! At 7.99/4 pack for a 9% ABV Russian Imperial Stout this is completely worth it."
""
""
"I found myself savoring each sip and let it warm on my palate before swallowing. This was an experience for me. I am new to RIS, Is there any better than this??? Time will tell...going to the store tomorrow to pick up some more...MY #1 FAVORITE for now:) Thanks North Coast Brewing Co. for making my first RIS. A definite bar has been set."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep black. No light penetrating through this even when held up to the sky. Slight head, that rather quickly dissipates, leaving some lacing around the glass. Nice aroma, predominantly coffee. Taste is pretty much along the same lines. Not a bad beer but I was a bit disappointed having seen the high score before picking this bottle up. Might be a great choice, if you're a connoisseur of the style, but for me it's just blah. Had better, had worse."
""
""
"After some time (about 30 minutes) I taste some orange. The beer retains itself well and is still silky with no signs of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep blackish brown with a creamy head. Loads of lacing in the glass. Big aroma of coffee and chocolate. The taste is spot-on the same, with some dark fruit joining in. Nice bit of bitterness on the finish. Nice thick, oily mouth. This is everything a stout should be, and one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Full bodied, but easy drinking for ris."
""
"O: This is considered a standard for Imperial Stouts for a reason. Very dark and straightforward, thick palate in both taste and mouthfeel yet easy to drink. You can smell an opened bottle from across the room. Can't go wrong with a pack of this."

"This is a beautiful product. I first came across it by accident, while looking for a different impy stout. This stood out because of the name, the artwork and it was $3 less for 4-pack (almost an aberration in MA). I'm much more than $3 richer for it now. This is about as close to a 5 as a regular beer gets (the only distraction is a somewhat boozy nose, and not because of the vessel). I keep going back to the well after that serendipitous moment and it tastes better every time."

"O- this thing is perfection. Hides it big ABV behind a delicious wall of flavors."

"O - This is a classic Stout that is a definite big beer sipper. An intense flavor explosion that last in your mouth. I recommend this one for all stout lovers and is must try fro any beer connoisseur. I think I liked this more when it was fresh but definitely nice to age. Try this one Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Poured perfectly opaque. Black with a fantastic creamy ,mocha colored head that fell off too slow and left rocky crags before a rich collar and cap. Excellent retention that you would expect from a stout and beautiful thick, sticky lace. Nose is genuine stout with roasted coffee some dark fruits and a good measure of alcohol.A bit of chocolate to tempt you. Smoky and inviting. Taste is heavenly. Chocolate, coffee malt, roasted, smoky, hints of vanilla and a delightful bitter. Not too thin, and drinks creamy and smooth. The alcohol is on the palate but it’s welcome. It’s a little boozy and who would mind with a flavor like this. Grand, with an aftertaste that boasts of it’s malt character and strength. Sweet and smoky like a fire on a cold night, burnt a little and some dark chocolate too. Fine and excellent."

"O - For the price this is an awesome RIS. It is a sipper though, its so heavy and syrupy yet so good. I think this may become a regular in my fridge.Gets better when it approaches room tempurature."

"This is an amazing, standard-setting sort of Russian imperial stout. It may be one of the most common and widely available beers in it's style, but there is nothing ""common"" about Old Rasputin's character (either the beer or the historical figure)."

"Probably my favorite beer. Great taste, nice, dark, rich, light hop, coffee/chocolate taste. Awesome name, awesome brewery. Really high aclohol content. I would reccomend this beer to anyone, and I do all the time. Have quickly converted all my friends to it. Pretty expensive but worth every penny."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not really my stout of preference, although nothing too negative. What threw me off was the overly bitter and alcoholic flavor which offset the chocolate. Would have liked aroma and taste to have been more prominent."

"Poured into pokal. Jet black, nothing showing through; thick tan head that leaves tons of lacing. Smells of yeast and malt, and a bit of chocolate. Taste is bitter chocolate up front, and tons of bitter coffee on the back end. Alcohol also present. A powerful stout, and very delicious. Mouthfeel is full."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"its opaque- the way a stout should be. black as a witch's soul. smells rich, with a smokey sweetness. the taste, also is rich with a strong bitter that isnt too over powering...its right on target. this beer actually went great with my lazy, rainy sunday afternoon."

"O - While not as roaring bold and complex as other RIS ive had, this brew has a nice clarity in development and i enjoy the way the flavors unfold as its consumed. Worth getting excited over."
"O: yeah wow. I'm converted. this is no doubt the best beer I've ever had. And the reviews say this is above average. What's top shelf taste like?? I'm in for life with the RIS."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty good RIS. There is a lot of hype about this one, but it isn't the best thing I have ever had. It is inexpensive (under $8 for a 4 pack) so it is worth the try. Everyone's palate is different! cheers!"

"Find it my children. Find it good."
"Overall: One of the best stout's ive ever had, I would rank it right up there with Founder's Breakfast Stout and my local Liberty Street Brewing's Emperor Norton. So smooth and heavy, and every flavor note you would expect in a world class stout; chocolate, coffee, bready... This one one beer you should try, even if you're not a fan of the style, it is a solid representation of a perfect Russian Imperial Stout."

"This and ""Celebrator"" are the two finest beers known to man. Rasputin is pitch black. You would think you're about to down pure oil if the smell didn't hit your nose just before the liquid gold hits your mouth. It smells of smokey chocolate, hops and alcohol. This beer tastes very creamy, very complex. If my kid is ever diagnosed with a terminal disease and we get to go somewhere via the ""make a wish"" foundation, I'm gonna demand to see what the heck they're doing at Lost Coast with this brew. ....not really, of course. I'll let my kid go to Disney World or something. But I'll always wonder."

""
""
" (albeit a little faster ""last"" than on this visit), an exceptional brew! 4.5"
"Overall: Even through the stout it's not as intense as I thought it would be (and as described on the bottle); it tasted good. I definitely would not mind having it again."

"O - Nose leads you to believe this might be a roasty beer. While it does have some roast, not as much as thought. I find this to be an excellent brew. While i personally don't like the roast beers - it had just a touch more than I like and it could be a bit sweeter. Appearance, while poured vigorously,was spectacular. Mouth is excellent. I do wish the nose was better. Overall, very good."
""
"I had this on Nitro about a month ago at Nobi Public House in Clear Lake, reviewing from notes. The pour on this was simply amazing. It had about an inch of head that was so thick I could sit a quarter on it without sinking and remained for the duration of my glass. Dark black in color with that awesome mocha head that lingered. Not much on the nose but the taste was of chocolate and mild coffee hints. Easily one of, if not the thickest stouts I'v ever had. Anytime I see this on Nitro, I will have a glass."
""
""
""
""
"O: sorry, Old Rasputin. you had the great misfortunate of being second in a two RIS line-up tonight and you followed ten fidy. in all fairness, this is a solid brew, but pales in comparison in terms of looks (esp. the pour), smell, taste, and defintely the mouthfeel. old rasputin tastes more like a regular everyday stout than a Russian Imperial."
""
""
""
""
"The foam just stays still the entire time you drink it. It's like nothing I've ever seen a beer do. I tilted the glass, and it just stayed one blob! It smells like chocolate or coffee. But the more important thing, the taste: it's great! A bit bitter, but smoother than any other ale I've had."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"I liked it so much I dont have any more to sip and make additional comments. Only bought a single in a mix-a-sixpack. Will buy a 4? or 6? pack next time I see it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Rarely does a beer live up to its hype, but Old Rasputin totally did for me. My only regret is that I wasn't able to have it on tap for my first time, as I'm sure that would only amplify the already awesome quality of this beer. Very highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
"O - Enjoyed it. I think I'd absolutely love it on draft, and will look to do so in the near future. For a bottled imperial, I was mildly impressed."

""
""
""

"O- an awesome stout, one of my new favorites. Alcohol is masked well and the taste is not overbearing. The balance of sweetness an bitterness is one of almost perfection, I'm utterly in love with this beer. Get one."

""
""

"O: I can't believe it took me this long to try this classic. A very good stout that I will come back to."
""
""
""
"This is an EXCELLENT every day drinking Stout! I always have a few in the door to the refrigerator as a nice treat at the end of the day. The 12oz offering also lets me enjoy one without feeling lightheaded due to the high alcohol content."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - Try it... if you like RIS then you must try old rasputin. If you want to branch away from hop-bombs and get in to the stout game then you MUST try old rasputin.. it is definitely a staple RIS that you can base other stouts off of. In texas, it is highly available.. try this beer!!"

"This is a very good beer. Looks good in the glass and had a nice creamy head that laced all the way down. I was a little disappointed with the aroma and mouth feel as I found them to be a little weak and thin for the style. Overall I thought this was a good, solid beer that everyone should try, but did not quite live up to the hype in my opinion."

""

"Overall-I guess I would have to say I'm underwhelmed by this beer, it has everything a RIS needs but doesn't go beyond the normal. It is available year round and at a very attractive price. However, I don't think I would go out of my way to purchase this again. 4"

"O: Really nice Imp Stout. This was one of the first beers that got me into the style. I'm glad I went back to try it again. Would drink again/10."

"North Coast Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout ---4/5."
""
""
""
"A very approachable dark RIS with a thick head, dark cocoa, roasted malt flavors, and a touch of dark fruit. Creamy and full-bodied with a velvety texture. Alcohol fairly well-hidden. Available year-round and compares favorably to some more hyped-up limited release stouts."

""

"Sto lat North Coast (get yer Polish dictionary handy here)."
""
""
""
""
""

"Had it on nitro a few days ago. You can read all the other reviews about how solid this beer is but if you have a chane to drink this nitro, do it. To think that such a thick beer could be so velvety and smooth. This stout is a benchmark for stouts and fortunately available all the time but its really perfect for nitro."
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
"Overall: A pretty good RIS, above average for the style. It would be nice if it had a better nose and wasn't as bitter to fit the style which would make it an even better brew. As it is, its year-round availability and price point makes it a very worthwhile purchase for anybody craving a shelf RIS. (4)"

"O: Fantastic, the best example of a RIS I've ever had. also very affordable for the RIS category. This beer is a treat as much as it is a beer that I could enjoy everyday."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer has a lighter mouthfeel and more carbonation than many RIS's that I have tried. Also not as malty/sweet, which is perfect for my taste!"

""

"Poured very dark into a snifter. Very robust, strong, deep roasted malt character with slight hop aromas in the malt. Thick dark head.. perfectly carbonated. The mouthfeel is creamy but balanced. Roasty yet clean. The taste was malty.. chocolate notes.. coffee notes.. strong but pleasant. Easily one of the most drinkable imperials i have had. Perfection. I give this beer an overall 5/5.. why? Legacy is a part indeed yet taste.. style.. and everything about this beer was exceptional to me. Cheers mates"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a tumbler pint glass. Had a very dark appearance with a creamy, 2 finger head that was coffee colored, almost had a hint of grey. The lace was beautiful and formed a nice latticework all the way down until the last sip. The nose was oaky and burnt with some undertones of some kind of nut, I couldn't quite tell. The flavor was dark,dark chocolaty with strong notes of coffee. MF was thick but very smooth. This is the best stout I've ever had, and definitely in the top 2 beers I've ever had in my entire life. An overall blissful experience from the appearance all the way to the last sip. I enjoyed it at a little less than room temp (60 degrees F)."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall very enjoyable. Not my favorite. I would drink a Ten FIDY first, but I still enjoy this one. Given its availability and reasonable price, definitely one to keep around."

"O-Pretty good. I would take a couple others over this if I were stranded on an island, but all in all pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer just paints the picture of sitting in front of a warm fire on a cold winter night. Would be good to enjoy with a strong cigar. If you want to try out a RIS at a very reasonable price, get yourself a 4 pack of the Old Rasputin"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Final Thoughts: For the price (<$9.00 a four-pack) it's a phenomenal deal. I might pick a couple more bottles up to cellar. Wish they would sell a barrel-aged version. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer doesn't overdue it. What it does is gives you a very clean, simple, high-quality tasting RIS. It doesn't try to push the limits, which is low risk, but it gets it right. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my go-to stouts. I can usually find it in most supermarkets and bottle shops and it is consistently delicious! Pours deeply opaque with the slightest tinge of red. Pours with a thick sturdy head with tons of lacing. Looks absolutely gorgeous in the glass. Roasted malts, coffee, baker's chocolate, raisin. The alcohol is not so apparent in the smell but in taste you definitely get a nice shot of heat. Surprisingly on the sweeter side but exceptionally well balanced."

"Overall: This is a good brew...it’s hard for me to say it’s the best imperial stout I’ve ever had, kinda feels like a run-of-the-mill upper level stout in smell, flavor and mouthfeel quite comparable to say Left Hand’s Fade to Black (which I love)…with that said, it definitely is an upper eschelon brew that deserves all the kudos it receives from beer aficionados…a very drinkable brew that I would consider sessionable, 1, 2 or even 3 would be a very happy night and one that would warm the belly as an indoor fire would warm the face…highly recommended, I’m excited to see how this beer after a year or more in my cellar will evolve…(4.25/5)"

"O - Solid shelf RIS, a real classic."
""
"At $6.99/four pack at Total Wines this beer is a steal. An excellent beer."
"O-It has been a year or two since my last Raspy, and the beer is mostly as I remember it: a decent, widely available RIS, but nothing I would seek out. This beer doesn't have the same complexities as Ten Fidy or Narwhal, but if you are fan of the classic, roasted, mildly bitter malt flavor, look no further. I suppose this brew earns points for being true to the classic style. This is not a bad beer, but it has been out-paced by the competition."
"A distinctive RIS. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Amazing! Easily one of the best beers I've ever tasted. It's a very flavorful and complex beer. It is also very balanced with the flavors yet still allowing for the distinct flavors to come out with the taste."
""

"O: Though this really is a very solid beer, the taste is a little on the boozy side compared to, say, Narwhal which I tend to like a bit more."

"O: Decent babies first RIS, though the mouthfeel is severely lacking. 10 yrs ago I'm sure this was a beast, but now it has the mouthfeel of coca cola. Had the BA version on tap and holy shit is that thin as hell, this isn't much different but least its affordable. Decent but nothing to write home about in my opinion."

"O- a great Russian Imperial Stout that packs a ton of roasted flavors, but has some nice sweet malt and toffee to meld with the stronger flavors. At 9% this is a warmer, but the alcohol does not take away at all from the brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably the best looking no gimmick RIS i've seen. Dark dark brown with reddish highlights. Thick prominent head that fades very slowly and leaves a light covering and lots of lace. The nose is light coffee, bigger chocolate but not quite as big as I expected. Still this is one good smelling brew with the chocolate taking me to a shop that has just opened its wares. Taste is somewhat the reverse with more coffee than chocolate. Hops are a star in this show and they will not take a back seat to anyone. Rich and smooth latte flows into an herbal and dry citrusy bittering. Finish is rather clean and quite dry. Chocolate malt notes underpin the charcoal infused java flavors. While clean the finish leaves some grapefruit and bitter black coffee. Feel is somewhat crisp with a tingly carbonation and rather chewy construction and heft. A great brew period and always welcome."

"My friend gave me a few bottles of beer for Christmas and I started with the darkest first. Great tasting beer, one I would have again and again, just not on the same day. Maybe some people are different but one is enough for me. It poured jet black and had a fairly thick head. It tasted real heavy on the first sip so I knew I was in for a treat. The beer did leave a taste in my mouth but so does a good cigar. Definitely a winter sitting by the fire beer."

"Almost pitch black when held up to the light, its topped off with a thick light brown head and simply stays put and eventually develops into an even layer of bubbles surrounded by some really good lacing. Coffee, roasted malts, chocolate and brown sugar come through, caramel and butter aromas are hidden and the smell is masked by a general scent of mild sweetness. Crisp when it hits your tongue, it’s bitter over all and has a medium-to-heavy mouth feel. The roasted malts are well evident in the aftertaste and on the side of your mouth; mild chocolate flavors are present throughout, not a bad stout at all. The aftertaste lingers on for a while, this is when you can taste the alcohol, it’s not bad. More flavors start coming out as it warms up, mild prunes, raisins; the malts now take a back seat."

"O: Excellent Imperial Stout. Doesn't get much better than this."

"I'm a little disappointed actually. It's only slightly better than Guinness Extra Stout. I always catch a kind of eggy scent off stouts which I dislike. The head was impressive and the color pitch black--benighted, I would say. Others compliment the alcohol kick, but I didn't sense much of it. Malt is big but not much sweetness, which is good. Burnt. This is my first review of a stout so I may need to return and revise. Maybe my batch was old? Not unpleasant just not what I had hoped."

"Appearance is dark brown to black with an ivory colored head - at least a full finger on a 12 oz pour. Great lacing. Smell is heavy chocolate malts - nice and sweet. Taste is as close to a dark chocolate bar in a beer - all over the front, middle and finish - although surprisingly not too over the top. Still dry and controlled on the end."

"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body weight, with medium levels of carbonation. The result is a beer with enough carbonation to slowly propel this across the palate in an appropriate fashion for an imperial stout. Ethanol heat and burn is definitely felt across the entire palate, but is less detracting here than elsewhere. Substantial stickiness across the palate after each sip."

"Wow, a truly complex beer, and very true to it's style. This RIS is unique enough to stand out and that's what has allowed it to make a name for itself. Nice, noticeable bitterness and herbal hop presence which goes unnoticed in so many brews of this style - very refreshing for a change of pace. Slow sipper at 9.0% ABV, but the alcohol plays well with the palate and never gets overbearing. Bottom line: if you like RIS's - stock up on this."
"I’ve always seen this beer in the stores and I finally pulled the trigger tonight. It was basically what I expected, which is an average Russian Imperial Stout. And that’s coming from a guy who probably overrates all RIS’s. EDIT: This grew on my as it went down. I upped a couple of ratings."

"Deep black color with a large dark brown head. The aroma was a beautiful mix of espresso, chocolate, bitter hops, and roasted grain,some alcohol crept in. The flavor was intense woody/charcoal, chocolate, coffee, roasted grain, tobacco, hops bitterness. The feel was surprisingly crisp and bubbly that made this beer feel not as big as it is.

"This is a beer that I've had many many times before, but never got around to writing a review for it. All around one of my favorite RIS. Pours a deep dark red with some mild khaki color head. Smell is great, but a tad benign compared to other heavy stouts. Malt, chocolate syrup, and vanilla. Huge toasted flavor, with lots of malt and milk chocolate. Good balance of sweet and bitter. Just a hint of alcohol. Little thinner in the mouth that one may expect, but also means it's not overly sticky. Overall, a great beer that's widely available. One of my favorites."

"Old Raspy: review long time coming. Smell of burnt raisins, chocolate malts, . Poured jet black, and a generous amount of carmel colored head. More carbonated than would be expected. What a brew, when it comes to the taste. Roasty malts, but a backbone of hops on this one: an inverse of the IPAs that predominate. This is a complex character: strong stout roasty flavor, but not too boozy. This review is from the bottle: must have from nitro tap!"
""
""
"O - Overall, this is a great RIS, and a great beer for the time of year, especially here in Michigan"
""
"Overall, one of my favorite, if not my favorite russian imperial so far. Rich and flavorful. Must try."
""
""
"O - It’s just such a unique beer. I’m used to the imperial stout having that nice chocolate/coffee flavor going on, and even a little bit of hops like with the yeti imperial stout, but the hops in this compliment the beer in such an incredible way owing to their sheer overwhelming presence. But it works. Inexplicably it totally works, and the flavors come together and play off of one another to make one of the best beers out there. I’ve been told it’s North Coast’s best beer. Well I haven’t tried all of them yet but I’m inclined to agree. It’d be tough to beat this."
"It is expensive but well worth the price."
""
"Poured a deep, deep black into a tulip glass. Small amount of cherry bronze head that dissipates slowly. Aroma reminds me of chocolate cake with booze. Taste is relatively malty, coffee, and ultimately leads to an alcohol-y aftertaste. Overall a great, strong stout that is easily available. Goes great with a strong, hearty stew or curry. Definitely a go-to."

"O- This is a big stout that packs a punch and has some booziness, but at the same time is incredibly drinkable"
"Now that's what I'm talkin' about. This stuff is what it's all about. It pours as black as my ex-girlfriend's heart with a beautiful two finger head the color of the nougat inside of a three musketeers bar and leaves elaborate lacing inside the snifter that I poured it into. Smell is mainly coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is a satisying fullness without being thick. Taste is robust. A strong coffee taste dominates, but there is also roasted nuts, dark chocolate and being a high ABV, some alcohol on the finish. This is what a RIS should be, a standard of excellence."

"Poured into a pint glass it gave a syrupy look into a dark black hue. Beautiful tan head with a coffee scent. What was interesting was the chocolate notes that came after sniffing it several times. The taste was a pure pleasure with soft roasted coffee and a hint of chocolate, much like the scent. This is everything I want in a stout but the last tastes were overwhelmed with an alcohol taste. Two sips close to perfection!"

"been months since I've had one. I love it more than ever. Every lick of the lips I get a nice bitter taste. The balance is unreal. It's so clean, so good.

"Overall – This is on fantastic brew. Its one I have had many times and will continue to go back to. Overall nicely roasty with good flavor transitions, a great smell and feel as well as a pleasant warming feel."

"Pours a very dark brown. A dense, root beer colored head with darker brown marbling sits atop a thick, opaque liquid. Sorghum, chocolate, and date comprise the aroma. Viscous, creamy mouthfeel balanced by some carbonation and hop burn. Imperial comes to mind with the first pull. Dark, ripe fruit, perhaps a little cherry, notes of chocolate. Ample coffee bitterness at the finish. This is a very good beer."

"Priced like one would expect for this much flavor but a little high for every day. Over $10.00 for a four pack."
""
"WOW !!.... Just poured a bottle into a pint glass, and the head was plentiful.... I take a nice deep smell of the deep, dark chocolate and almost coffee scent before I took my first sip.... I must say that the taste matches or exceeds the dark chocolate and coffee notes.... The ""tears"" or ""legs"" of this stout speak a bunch for themselves.... They trail and leave many compliments to the glass.... The mouthfeel or aftertaste lingers and is quite wonderful.... I've had quite a few beers out the North Coast Brewery, and liked the majority of them.... This one may be amongst my favorites, though."

"Old Rasputin stands as being the creamiest imperial stout in my experience thus far. It's quite interesting - the alcohol is noticeable and there is a touch of hops in there as well, but the foamy head and rich body come closer to a Young's stout than, say, the Stone Imperial Stout. And indeed, there is a chocolate profile which makes for a tasty, tasty beer. The only downside for me was the lack of strength of smell. I got some whiffs of malt and chocolate, but it didn't knock me back. I'll blame it on the glassware choice of the bar (regular pint glass) and not dock too much for it."

"O: An excellent beer, that's very easy to drink for such a big and dark style. Nothing here stands out in the plethora of ""barrel aged"" and ""specialty"" imperial stouts, but I can't find anything wrong with it either.

"The flavor had loads of cocoa and a slight bit of coffee. Lots of roasted malt and unfortunately, a decent amount of alcohol.

"Smooth beer. Medium to heavy bodied, the carbonation isn't noticeable other than as an assistant in the task of helping move this along. Not that I want it to go to fast. Coats the tongue very well."

"Very dark amber pour, almost no head. fine lacing. Rich complex smells of dark chocolate, bourbon, a hint of mint, and caramel. Taste is beautifully complex, multilayered. First notes of chocolate and bourbon, then a bit of leather, light tobacco, mellowing to caramel. Tastes like KBS's brother. As a result I like it just about the same! Its a little more mellow, though, which in some ways I like more, though on the other hand KBS is more rich."
"O: Bottom line - at $8.99 for a 12 oz 4-pack, this is a gem in the rough!! Appearance, smell, taste and mouthfeel are above average. This brew is in a league of its own; everything that is better than what's harder to find year round and more expensive, but damn near comparable in every other department."
"O: excellent.. a great Russian Imperial Stout, one of the best of the style IMO. Multiple strong flavors balance well- no one flavor overpowers the others (including the alcohol content). Great nose and visually appealing, overall a great presentation which is followed through with solid taste."
""
"O:  This is one of my favorite RIS because it's quite delicious and it's hands down cheaper than anything else. You couldn't ask for a better deal than this. The flavors and aroma speak for themselves and deliver a complex yet elegant beer that is sure to please. "

"This beer on nitro is soo smooth so I gave it a 5 for mouthfeel. Its smooth without being too airy. Overall, great brew and I probably gave it a bigger number due to the nitro tap."
"Pours a very dark, can't-see-light-through-it-dark-Cola kind of way, with fine, dark and persistent head with moderate lacing. Nose is dark, substantial, sweet, aged with moderate alcohol presence and roasted malt (need I tell?). Taste is strong, cooked, char-like coffee, dark chocolate, some dried fruit and plum-like flavors, and ethanol prominence, but well balanced with a bitterness that is decidedly not really a hoppy kind of bitterness after all. Taste profile does not modulate considerably over time. Mouth-feel is meal-like, substantive and filling. Pleasant overall, but I'm not so much big on the style, thinking I need to have a more refined taste in cheese to go along with this steak-of-a-beer-like brew."

"overall very good, very satisfying, but i like siberian night a little better."
"O - first off Old Rasputin is a damn good beer and really good RIS. One of the older players in this heavily BA category, it still holds itself well against the young bucks. It is very solid for the style if fairly unremarkable. Dont mistake this as average, of which it certainly isnt. Old Rasputin just doesnt knock your socks off in any particular way. But, considering its large distribution area, year round availability, relatively cheap price point and is considerably better than MOST breweries RIS, you could do far far worse."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours opaque black with a tall, creamy brown head. The head dissipates slowly. Plenty of sticky lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. Poured into a pint glass. Pours opaque black with a tall, creamy brown head. The head dissipates slowly. Plenty of sticky lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. Dark roasted barley malt, bitter chocolate, anise, dark fruits, dark coffee, some hops, and some alcohol round out the flavors. It has a nice, dark roasted flavor overall. The flavors are bold and well balanced. There is a bitter aftertaste. It should be noted that the alcohol taste is not strong despite this beer being 9% ABV. The body is full with adequate carbonation. This beer is smooth and the drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer and remains one of my favorite examples of this style.

"A truly classic Russian imperial stout. It is the standard to which I hold all others. It's not the best around by any means but it's readily available enough that if a stout isn't at least this good, it has no business in my cellar. If you're a stout fan and for some reason you haven't tried this one, it's past time you get out there and give it a try. Like most Russian imperial stouts, Old Rasputin is great fresh and even better with some age on it."

"Served on Nitro at The Pantry on 4/23/13. Poured into a standard shaker :(. Pours black as coal with nice big creamy khaki colored head. No light can escape this black hole of a beer. It leaves reams of thick creamy head on the glass with some light lacing as well. The nitro gives this beer a more evened out nose but also pulls away from some of the aromatics. It still smells great with a smoky coffee and fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. There is a hint of alcohol on the nose but not overwhelming. The taste is very nice. I love what a nitro does to a good stout. The beer is slightly sweet with some bitter malt flavor melding well with some well placed hop bitterness that takes a slightly woody taste. The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. Very slight alcohol burn. I really like this beer and I think the nitro is a different experience for an already world class beer."

""
""
""

""
"O: This beer is very enjoyable and has really nice complexity in both the smell and the taste. The higher ABV is pretty well hidden in the smell and taste but lightly present in the mouthfeel as the beer warms. It has been a couple of years since I have had this beer but it definitely lived up to my memories. I will happily have this one again."

"Pours seal brown with a bountiful mocha head composed of fairly large bubbles. Plenty of lacing lingers as the head recedes. Aroma is very present; a bountiful blend of chocolate, alchol, and hops. Roasted malt and bitter hops are at the forefront flavor-wise, with some chocolate and coffee playing more of a complementary role. Alcoholic warmth comes through in the finish, along with lingering bitterness. This is actually a little hoppier than I prefer a stout to be, but not surprising for a west coast offering. Either way, the bitterness is not outrageous, and it still leaves enough room for the lovely roasted malt to be appreciated. There's also a good amount of carbonation that lends a velvety texture to the brew. The thickness here is about right for a RIS, and the lingering stickiness gets my stamp of approval as well. Old Rasputin is certainly a tasty beer, though the slightly excessive bitterness keeps it from quite living up to the gorgeous presentation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I love imperial stouts (perhaps too much), and more often than not I am disappointed by what I find. However, if I am disappointed by one beer, I can always get some Old Rasputin to put a smile back on my face. This beer isn't overly complex, but it is executed very well. Highly recommended."
""
"Old Rasputin has become a benchmark for the Russian Imperial stout style since it its introduction in the late 80's. And that benchmark holds - this is one of the best examples of the style i've had in quite some time. From the near textbook appearance to the intense and deliciously complex flavor, this beer does everything well. It's a keeper that I hope to have around often. Glad to have finally tried it."
""
"O - This to me is the benchmark RIS. Every time I have one it's extremely enjoyable and insanely easy drinking."
""
"O/D - Nice but lacking depth. Don't get me wrong though, this was a good Impy Stout and really easy to drink. Just left me wanting more as I felt like it had the potential for greatness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a staple in my fridge. Roasty is what comes to mind as far as flavor and aroma. The price is a bonus here and I always appreciate it when imperial stouts are offered in 12 oz. bottles. I give North Coast a lot of credit for making a top notch RIS with wide distribution and a reasonable cost. Good stuff."
""
""
"O..Wish I had not waited so long to try this incredible Russian Imperial Stout. Looking forward to having this one again soon!"
"I like this beer. Its smoky like a boy scout’s campfire, carries a lighter ABV for an imperial stout but still plenty of alcohol, and it fits the style well."
""

""
""

"Not my favorite but a good example of a russian imperial stout. Bonus words."

"Seriously though, its great to see this style of beer available here now. Just a shame about the price."
"Nice, heavy beer. An enjoyable sipper for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious and complex, hints of hops and tonnes of malt, would be great sipping cause the flavours just keep getting better as the brew warms."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an exceptional Imperial Stout with a ton of flavor and a smooth drinkability..."
""
""
"This is a great beer: serve warm!"
"Pound for pound one of the best stouts around. A great after dinner brew, or whenever the mood strikes. My only regret is I have but one bottle to drink..."

"OK, I couldn't save any of 4-pack and there may be a new McHaggis on the way, I highly recommend this beer."

"O - This is nothing short of a fantastic RIS. If you are into the roasted flavors of a coffee stout and are atune to some sweetness, this is a no-brainer."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 6/3/2011. Been a while since I first rated this one(9/2010). Pours almost pitch black color with some brown around the edges with an impressive 2 finger dense tan head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some very nice soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, pine, herbal hop, caramel, biscuit, molasses, and slight dark fruit. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity and strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, pine, biscuit, caramel, coffee, molasses, toffee, herbal hop, charred malt, and slight citrus. Nice sized spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, charred malt, pine, herbal hops, and caramel and the finish for a while. Nice balance of hop flavors with roasted malt flavors. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Quite smooth to drink, but is still definitely a sipper. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Russian imperial stout, and an absolute classic in the style. Very robust and smooth; and extremely enjoyable to sip on."

"O: Truly a quality, easily accessible example of style, but it didn't quite live up to my high expectations for having it on nitro."
"One of the best stouts. It's sweet, as I prefer, but countered well by the heavy bitterness. Great for a cool spring night."

""

""

"I can see why this is so popular. Roasted malts balanced by a pleasant bitterness, with tones of complexity to boot. It also warms nicely, which allows the chocolate and coffee flavors to bloom. The bottle I had wasn't especially creamy, to my disappointment. I think I'll revisit Old Rasputin with the hope the I'll get a better bottle, but this is how I feel about it for now."
""
"O: A solid Russian Imperial Stout. Very roasty with great milk and dark chocolate flavor, but a bit too bitter for my liking. If it was a bit sweeter, it'd be phenomenal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best stouts I've tried. I only wish it were easier to find - it's lack of ubiquity is astonishing given its status in the beer world as the archetypal RIS."
""
""
""
""
"O: Outstanding RIS, so much complexity and flavors goin on and the 9 abv goes almost unoticed."
"Overall= Fantastic stout that tastes great and delivers a powerful buzz, 10-14 dollars a 4 pack, will definitely buy again."

"O: Rock solid lower ABV (by today's ultra high ABV examples that seem to be all the 'world's best beers') RIS that delvers a nice balance between flavours."
""
""
"Overall a great beer. I was reluctant to try it because usually imperials have too much ABV for me but this one did a great job of working in compliment with it. A must try."
""
""
""
""
"O - An excellent imperial stout. Offers an array of rich, complex flavors. This beer is meant to be savored. Awesome label too."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours opaque black with a bubbly light brown head. Good retention, good lacing. Aromas are dark chocolate, piny hops, and anise; slightly boozy. Tastes are rich and complex with notes of unsweetened dark chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, pine, anise, and is slightly roasty with the pungent, piny hops lingering on the palate right through past the bitter finish. Mouth-feel is full-bodied and rather oily. Alcohol is well concealed. Overall, a favorite Russian Imperial Stout of mine: good quality, it's readily available year-round, good price point, and it's consistent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very complex in a pleasant way. Burnt caramel, hops, coffee notes, and a somewhat ""woody-earthy"" quality. One of the best all around RIS you can buy. The quality from this brewer is very constent; I have never had a ""bad"" lot from this company. This brew always lives up to its great reputation. Very reasonably priced at about 9 bucks per 4 pack."
"Overall, the alcohol just ruins everything for me here. It's in the smell, the mouthfeel, and the taste. Doesn't leave much room leftover for taste ... I know my viewpoint clashes with nearly every BA out there, but that's why it's MY viewpoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was a great beer. If you are a stout-lover, I highly recommend this one. Very, very tasty and hides the alcohol extremely well. I'd love to come back to this one."
"It is hard to turn down this beer. A wonderful stout at a great price point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The RIS style is inundated with ridiculously thick, absurdly ridiculous monsters. This is not one of them, and it isn't supposed to be. It's a good for what it is, but I am not a huge fan of the hops and overall lack of depth of the malts. This does work well in cooking chili, however."
""
"Regardless, it's good stuff."
""
""
""
"O- An awesome beer. It's everything you could want in a Russian Imperial Stout. I love the fact that it's big and strong, but there's not a hot alcohol flavor and that the roast flavors are present, but the beer avoids being too harsh. It's a drinkable version that I'd come back to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: First time having this stout and it was very tasty...definitely a sipper that is best enjoyed while hanging out and relaxing...overall a very complex stout with a number of different flavors hitting you throughout"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very good imperial stout, I just wish the alcohol was hidden more to let the other flavors predominate, though at 9% that's hard to do."
"Conclusion: I always imagined this to be a well rounded American version of this classic style, and it turns out to be exactly that. Worth the hype? Yes. Are there even better options out there? Yes."
""
"Overall: It's good, but it's not the best on the market for the money. Nice char notes and some hop notes make things interesting. Decent, but that's as far as it goes."
"O: This is a beer that screams ""serve me at the right temperature!"" Having it too cold will cause it to become far too bitter and hard to drink. Letting it warm up gives it a chance to show off some of its complexities. The fact that it's easy to find and a great value in the RIS world (got this 4 pack at $8.99, and I've seen it as low as $6.99 in VA) makes it panacea for those who don't/can't chase distribution trucks just to have a shot at purchasing KBS."
""
""
"Overall: Straight up, get this F'n beer. If you like stouts or someone who appreciates real beer, you will definitely not be disappointed. Salud!"
"Overall - To put it simply: Amazing. This is one time where I cannot find anything truly wrong with this beer! It's got a excellent look, smell and taste. To top it all off, it's incredibly easy to drink! I'll go ahead and say that this one of the best beers I have ever had and the best Russian Imperial Stout I have ever had!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A classic, straight forward Russian Imperial. There's nothing fancy about this one, and sip after sip becomes a bit of a menacing chore, though a chore that's enjoyable in a masochistic sense. It's a beer that feels stronger than the 9% label would have you believe. I consider Old Rasputin to be the standard by which all RIS's should be judged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black, like motor oil, viscous, with a dark brown head. Smells of strong chocolates, bitter earthy roasted malt, and more chocolate. Taste follows with heavy chocolate but not too sweet, balanced by a beautifully balanced roasted bitter finish. Great medium-heavy mouthfeel and not too syrupy. Excellent and easy to find."
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer didn't disappoint! It's very close to perfection; the only thing I didn't fully enjoy was the almost-extreme level of roastiness, which starts showing after the beer warms up. All in all, this is a true classic and an excellent example of the style. Must-try, if you like stouts and chocolate; stay away, if you can't stand bitter and roasty beers."
"Bravo!"

"Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout - The bottle says: “Brewed in the tradition of the 18th century English brewers who supplied the Russian court of Catherine the Great. Old Rasputin develops a cult following wherever it goes. It’s a rich, intense brew with big, complex flavors and a warming finish."

""
""
""
"Thick creamy head to it’s oily core it’s a joy to drink. A nice burnt chocolate/coffee flavor greets the nose. Rich, oily mouthful like a chaw of chewing tobaccoo but such a nice tangy flavor. The beer finishes rich and malty with a wonderful mix of hoppy goodness."

""
""
"I have drank a ton of this served from a bottle but had the chance to drink this on tap/nitro driven at winos in Bowling green Ky. Really tasty as always with the added smoothness from the nitro. Nice dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate/coffee and no real noticeable alcohol presence. Which is surprising given the fact that this beer is no slouch coming in at 9% ABV. Just a good solid RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the prettiest beer I have ever seen and definitely the best RIS I have had a chance to drink. In the dark world I think I prefer Founder's Breakfast Stout, but when compared to Old Rasputin the coffee, oatmeal, and chocolate almost come off as gimmicky. Old Rasputin is a legend and must have."
"Excellent beer!"
"Mouthfeel: This is one the easiest drinking stouts that I have had in a while the creaminess to the beer makes it so easy to drink that a person could get in a lot of trouble with a smooth beer like this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Amazingly smooth for such a delicious richness! Even a more skeptical craft beer consumer would give this one an easy A!"
""
""

"Such a quality RIS that is easily attainable and distinctive in taste profile. The gem among bitter, roasty, smoky RIS's."
""
"O: Being that the imperial stout is my new favorite style of beer, I have to say this is one the best I've tried so far. It is more mellow than some of the others I tried, and is a bit more heavy on the coffee flavors. I will definitely be coming back for more. In fact, I think I'll have another right now."
"O: Potent beer milkshake."
""
""

"Overall - Quite a unique imperial stout by North Coast. I was surprised by the intensity of the dark chocolate and cherry flavours. Well balanced and very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Fantastic Imperial stout. One of my favorites but still not as good as The Abyss."
""
"Man this beer is what a Russian Imperial stout should be. Taste outstanding. looks dark as night. Feels the way it should and it smells similar to dark coffee / dark chocolate. The flavor is full on roasted goodness. Why pass this one up? Just get it."
"A must try on nitro."
""
""
""
"Holding on to this bottle was a bit of an experiment and I would say it turned out great! I'm gonna have to grab another four pack to replace this bottle."
""
""
""
"Had this on tap at the Brickhouse a few months back, reviewing from chicken-scratch on the back of a receipt. Served in a pint glass with a one finger light tan head. Body of the beer is black, though I think a deep brown would be a better descriptor, as it's not truly a jet black. Aroma is of dark sweet malts, roasted malts, chocolate, caramel. When I sip the beer I get flavors of dark chocolate, roasted notes, bitterness, malt sweetness. Body is not as thick as expected considering the smell and the high ABV. I am generally not an RIS kind of guy, but this was one of the first imperial stouts I have enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer was dark black and produced a tan mocha head. Very malty flavor. I get a small hint of coffee or chocolate maybe, but not sure. Either way, there is a sweet taste with a little bit of a bitter bite. There is also a hint of the alcohol (which is otherwise very well-masked at 9%). I have not had many of these imperial stouts, but this is probably the best I have had so far. Very drinkable for how heavy it is, but I probably still couldn't have more than a couple."
"O: Great taste, feel. I would drink this anytime. One of the best stouts I've ever had."
""
"Smokey smell comes out right away to me and then I get the chocolate and caramel smell. Taste of dark chocloate, malts, smoke. Flavor is bitter but not overwhelming. Strong but good. It's been a while since I've had this and I plan on trying again because I think my rating will increase."
""
"Notes: A total classic. Very nice on it's own, but could beat up anything else you are eating/drinking."
"O: What looked and smelled promising really failed to deliver. If this is what the Russians were drinking in 1917, it's no wonder they revolted! If I'm in the mood for an imperial stout, I'll pay a pretty penny for Samuel Smith's offering; but I couldn't get more than 25% of this one down before pouring it into the compost bin -- I'll be returning the bottle to the store for a refund!"
""
""
""
"youwza! what a great beer...pourned into a pint glass. smell was choclolaty,with some mocha/coffee. some roasted grains. the color and head at extremly attractive...frothy lighter brown chocolate head, that left beind some cooll lacing. mouthfeel is robust, light carbonation toasty flavors all over the place. taste is great, i caught coffee roast grains, some smal fruit rind inbetween the first taste, to the last. some bitterness behind thats bind everything nicely. a.b.v is not to crazy but good where it is. great beer, great stout. very very enjoyable!"

""
""
""

""
""
""
"O- Wonderful beer. What hath North Coast wrought?"
""
""
"O: A moderately big, full flavored RIS that is balanced, a pleasure to drink and a good value."
""
""
""
"Pour an inky black with coffee-coloured head and decent lacing. Mouthfeel is pleasant, not nearly as oily or viscous as might be expected by the 9% ABV. Aroma of roasted malts and barrel tannins is followed by the well balanced, smoky taste. The barrel focused finish remains a true highlight."
""
"O: A fantastic RIS. It became more sweet and syrupy as it warmed up. I would definitely recommend this beer."
""
""
"Overall, Old Rasputin has everything that a standard imperial stout has, but is smoother. It's less alcoholic than most in it's style, which makes it more enjoyable. It also doesn't have an extremely heavy molasses or sugary sweet syrup taste, so that's what I like about it. No where near my favorite beer, but it's damn tasty."
"O - Does it live up to the hype? That, lads and ladies, is up to the drinker. In my opinion, the bottle lived up, whereas the tap did not. Anyways, both were great choices; drinkable, flavorful, nice ABV and cleverly masked. Recommended."
""
"North Coast Brewing Old Rasputin Imperial Russian Stout: This brew is highly regarded by Beer Advocate reviewers, so when I saw it in a store it was hard to pass up. No surprise that it is pitch black with a thin near brown head. There is a good aroma to this stout with molasses and bready notes. If you try this beer be ready for an intense experience. The flavor is big and brawny. Get ready for hints (or hits) of coffee grinds, unsweetened bakers chocolate, blackstrap molasses and toasted black bread. The aftertaste is long with some bitter coming through. This is not your starter stout, and I would recommend for those not familiar with stouts to work your way up to the Old Rasputin with some more mellow offerings. This is an overwhelming beer!"

"Overall: Amazing beer that is a very great intro to and example of the style. Recommended for any beer lover."

"M - Light carbonation. Intense flavor but goes down smooth. Very good beer."
""
""

"O - With a name like Old Rasputin, you know this beer is going to bring some serious flavor and heat. The complexity of the flavor was very enjoyable and robust and, in combination with the alcohol warmth, made for a nice beer to knock the chill off. I understand why this beer is so popular as it's a great representation of the RIS style."

Time for a taste. Oh gosh! So much complexity after such a weak nose. Crazy! Chocolate, espresso, caramel, liquorish, mulled over with carbonation, with a tart bittering hop finish that I just love! Fantastique!"

"One of the beers that lives up to the hype, the mysterious Cyrillic and the mad monk on the label. The half inch head was formed by millions of miniscule bubbles. The smooth potency of the flavor makes it stand out. I am an Edmund Fitzgerald fan, and this stout is so much better. My first North Coast brew, so I will have to sample more via the great selection/make your own six at Andersons."
"O: Solid stout, highly drinkable and enjoyable. A bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth it to treat yourself with this if you're a fan of dark, roasty, malty, full bodied stouts and porters. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this beer."

"O: A good stout to have on a cold night. 9% ABV and the price per bottle(1.99/per in a 4 pack) make this an incredibly good deal for such a highly alcoholic, and well made beer. A"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm still young, but this is the best stout I've tasted to date. Amazing stuff and great for the price."
""
"O - This bottle isn't dated, but was a bit dusty on the shelf. Hard to say if this affects the review. A bit too much burn at the back end for me. I've had other RIS's that disguise this better. The burn hides the roast and sweetness that come though in the nose. Everything else about this beer was top notch."
""
""
""
"DOA"
""
""
""
"Never had one of these before and I'm very impressed."

"a drinkability that belies the 9%, even though you can taste it. Smoothe and well balanced with good carbonation levels. This does not necessarily make it a sessionable beer per se, but it is certainly drinkable for a big RIS. Definitely worth picking up a four pack."
"Absolutely one of my favorite stout offerings out there, especially when the weather gets cold. Every time I have it, it becomes more inviting and less intimidating to drink, and I while I think I prefer it fresher (more hoppiness all around), it's still very good when slightly aged. A timeless classic, although definitely not for everybody. Just an amazing beer!"
"THEE Russian Imperial Stout!! But with all the other Breweries that have copied this style since and that have barrel aged it, Well it should be barrel age really, it smoothes it out a bit and adds refinement to what is a strong hearty beer not for the timid or faint of heart! If you Don't like Thick Stouts don't buy this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
"Overall a solid RIS. I would consider this a good RIS staple because of the price and accessiblity. Dries out as it warms up, as where I would have liked it to stay slightly sweet. Will enjoy again I'm sure."
"O - For the easy-to-get stouts, this is pretty good, especially given the price. It's a bit hot fresh, but aged would probably be much better."
""
"O- This is a very good RIS,but imo not an exceptional one. I enjoy this beer and have had it several times. Its a very good beer with a very reasonable price tag and a wide distribution. All of these factors keep Old Rasputin in my beer fridge, its just not the best beer in the fridge."
""
""
"O- without counting the value into review, this one is still a great solid RIS. I plan on getting plenty of this to age and experiment with as it is so cost effective. Buy in bulk and buy often."
""
"Not my favorite but good for sure. Good for sipping."
""
""

"Get this beer and drink it. Strong alcohol, black colour, and formidable bitterness are all staples of this style. F**k yeah."

"O-well worth the wait, both for the year that it sat and for me to get back to reviewing..."
""
"Perhaps there are more recent, unique takes on this style with bourbon barrel aging and vanilla overtones but this beer represents the standard for Russian Imperial Stout. One of my fravorite all time beers. Never had an off bottle."

""

""

"O: I have had this several times and it just seems to get better and better the more I have it. The taste is top notch and few compare. One of the best quality to price beers you can possibly get on the market."

""
"Poured into snifter glass. Black in color and opaque, with a dense mocha colored head, almost gone in a few minutes leaving small spots of scattered lacing. Smell is black chocolate up front, with faint booze and cream. Taste starts with a bitter and burnt explosion, finished by subtle sweet chocolate and alcohol lingering. Entirely drinkable and creamy."

"o- pretty awesome RIS. Definitely lives up to its reputation."
"I didn't hate this beer. I do like Imperial Stouts and they are especially good this time of year as I am reviewing this beer 2 days before Christmas. That said, there are many other Russian Imperial Stouts I would pick over this one."
""
"Overall- I am very pleased with this one. I bought it on the recommendation of the store clerk and I am glad I did. Complex and robust but not overpowering. I am going to recommend this to all my stout drinking friends."
""
""
"O - This is one amazing stout, and one of the more complex I have tasted. The extra hopping really adds something that many stouts are missing in my opinion. If you truly enjoy big, slightly boozy blasts of dark/burnt/bitter flavors, this one is for you! Highly recommended."

"This poured dark as midnight with a nice soft thick head that stuck to the sides of the glass. I tastes hints of chocolate and coffee. The feel was creamy and smooth this went down very easy and at 9% i didnt taste any alcohol in the finish. I drank this with a smoked pork chop sandwich that i thought went well together. If you see this on tap i recommend giving it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Generally I like all beers, but I am mostly an IPA man. My fave of all time being Herculese Double IPA. But I must say- this is THE best Russian Stout I have ever tasted. It's not a session beer by any means, but worthy of a taste. Extremely well crafted and tasty."

"Overall, this is still a good beer two years later, though it may be a bit past it's prime. This is the last beer of a 4 pack that I have had over the past 2 years and it shows that the beer is probably best within the first 15 or so months of bottling. As I said, still a very good beer even at 2 years, but it's heading downhill. That being said, the scores from this bottle should give an idea of how good it is when it's fresher."

"well hidden alcohol for an imperial. pours deep brown like dark chocolate and mildly carbonated with a mocha head only half an inch thick. smells imperial. strong, roasty, and complex. powerful taste just a little bitter from the roast. genuine russian imperial, probably the definitiion of the style, all grainy and boozey. yummm, but i coudnt drink the whole four pack, no chance"

"I don't know if I've been so pleasantly surprised by a dark....and I do mean DARK beer, ever in my life. It had that nifty rich head, which is a walnut color and it sat thick and tidy on top of the brew. The color was as black as night and very smooth feeling for something I was expecting to be heavy and syrupy. The powerful coffee opener was magical, there was NO BITTER BITE at the tail end. I was entranced. I broke out some organic white chocolate bark from Baltimore with almonds and blueberries it. The pairing was incredible. I don't get this excited about beers. I can't wait to carry it at the bar!!!"

" it's unique, complex, fits the style, strong, creamy, smells amazing, inexpensive, the bottle looks cool. What more should I expect in a beer? Should I rate this lower because of a beer that I haven't tried and will probably have to drive for 13 hours and stand in line for a day to obtain? This is totally worth the 3 block walk for me."

"I first tried this beer a year ago, and it instantly became one of my favorites. A year later, and it still lives up to my taste. Solid, a really beautiful beer with a unique take on the Imperial Stout."

"Overall (4.0): Not a bad RIS by any means—kind of a benchmark in a lot of ways. It’s not the most interesting or most complex RIS in terms of taste, but it does seem to nail some elements rather well, suggesting to me that North Coast dialed in on a very dependable RIS recipe a long time ago. Good for them, because this works. Not surprisingly, this seems like a great candidate for cask and barrel treatments."
"An excellent everyday imperial stout. Always affordable and available; perhaps a bit thinner and hoppier than I like this style to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For me this beer is the standard for the genre. Old Rasputan Russian Imperial Stout is the bar by which others are measured against. A must-try, and the perfect beer for late-fall when the leaves are gone and the wind bites a bit more each day."
""
""
""
""

"Easily one of the best imperial stout's I've ever had. Enjoyed out of a nitro tap, Old Rasputin has perfectly balanced flavors of bitter dark chocolate and coffee, as well as a surprisingly high alcohol content of 9%. Pours deep black with a creamy brown head, the low carbonation allows for full enjoyment of this delectable stout. Gentle mouthfeel and strong flavors that leave little to be desired. Can't think of a RIS I'd rather sip on a cold winter night than old rasputin"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I already knew this, but taking the time to be critical reaffirms how much I love this beer. They're two different animals, but the only Russian Imperial that equals this is Samuel Smith's. This is the standard bearer for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a complex, roasty, bitter and delicous brew, and is incredible for the $7.99 per four pack price point."
"Aged 2 years and even better than fresh."
""

"(11/11) '09 Vintage: Outrageously drinkable with a couple years on it. Throw a 4-pack in your cellar, you won't regret it (wish I put in more)."

"I have enjoyed this world class stout for a while. Not sure why I never reviewed, but figured now was as good of a time as any. It is the epitome of a stout in the color, pour, head. Dark in the bottom, lighter on top. full of chocolate and coffe in the nose and that translates into the taste. Add in caramel, lots of citrus hops to the chocolate and coffee. The hops almost make me pucker at times. love how easy this is to drink, cant make out the 9.0 abv til it hits me."
""
"Strong notes of licorice and spice--but two of the myriad flavors that spike your palate. Overall, this is a knock-out beer, exploding with flavor, and pretty intense with its 9%+ alcohol content. Hard to imagine a beer gourmond not loving this beer unless you're not keen on stouts. Few rivals to this baby, a real delight."

"Dark as night. Lower carbonation level due to the high alcohol content. Chocolate aroma with hints of licorice. Incredible flavour!! Coffee at first, with a smooth sweet chocolate middle, then a little warming with a gentle chocolate finish. The alcohol certaintly does not overpower. Mouthfeel is perfect, not too thin, but not too syrupy. Overall this is sweeter than other imperial stouts that I have tried, but with good balance. This truly is one of the world’s great beers! Thanks to Brian for serving me this remarkable beer."

"O: Good beer for a cold night. I would recommend."
"character as they're overpowered by the roasty notes. I think this one smells and looks much better than it tastes and feels. Personally, I think there's better RIS on the market. Glad to have tried it though. A fine beer to try and sample."
"O - This beer started off so well with the appearance and smell then just went way south with the taste. Not balanced at all. This may be my first drain pour and I can't believe it's on such a highly rated beer as this. I'm thinking I must have picked up a bad bottle or something. This beer is a hot, alcoholic mess. So disappointed. Glad I only picked up a single!"
" This is a one and done beer.. This is my first Imperial Stout and I didn't really like it that much"
"O: Wow, I've actually gotten by living in California for 3 years and I've never tried this. It was way better than I thought it would be. I really enjoyed the hop bitterness they through in paired with the decadent brownie flavors."
"smells like roasted cocoa beans, head like rocky sea foam, feels like velvet across my tongue and tastes like an unsweetened, dark chocolate brownie with powdered sugar on top. I will stock more of these in my cellar when I get my allowance."
"One of my all-time favorites. Poured into a pint glass, I had no trouble making a ridiculous perfectly foamy tan head that sat upon the black sea of liquid. Lacing is great and you have a sudsy film floating around the whole time your drinking, which might not be as long as you might expect with a strong brew like this. It has a very strong, roasted character. It smells almost woodsy or yeasty. There is coffee in there somewhere, perhaps even espresso? It has a decent hop bite too. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming for me. Definitely a sipper, it's just overwhelming with flavor and so damn heavy. It really stays on the tongue too. By far my favorite I've had by this brewery. I am going to try my hand at brewing a clone of this later this week. Looking at the grain bill, I can see why it is such an intense beer."
"While Old Rasputin is great out of the bottle and the regular tap, nitro-tap puts it on another level."
"Fine beer. It leaves a hoppy-acrid linger at the back of my palate that not other beer will match for a long time to come."
"O - This is a good overall beer. Nice flavors and silky body. Excellent depth to the aroma. A little less of the piney, bitter hops would improve it in my eyes, but other than that it is a great beer."
"Body-Thick, creamy, heavy and syrupy, incredibly smooth and rich, luscious texture. Somehow a decent amount of effervescence. This is an incredible beer, I love this stuff and would get it again in a heartbeat."
"O: if you have not had had this beer on nitro then you have not had a stout. This is beer should be placed among the elite."
"I'm not usually one for Nitro beers, but I was feeling adventurous and decided to give an old classic a try. Pours black with a typically thick, dense, stable slab of a head on top that leaves much lacing on the glass. Nearly no aroma at first, but then a semi-sweet chocolate aroma emerges with an increased dark fruitiness as it warms. Tasty from the start...I think maybe a bigger stout like this is what I need from a nitro tap. Lots of chocolaty roast and a gentle creamy sweetness. Feels a little less than full bodied this way, but still obviously very smooth and floaty in the mouth. Whereas most nitro I come across is rather mild and bland, this is not...it works! It also reminds me that I need to revisit this widely available, great stout more often."
"Addendum: This tastes very similar to Deschutes Black Butte porter (which is also very good) with more booze. Similar hop profile. Booze booze and more booze, and some licorice. Not very complex. Where's the beef? Give me control of the brewery and I could produce one hell of an inviting stout. Why can't these guys do the same?"
"Pours a motor oil black, with a weak looking 1 finger head, lots of slime and sticky bubbles. Big hops on the nose, followed by bitter coffee bean, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla milk chocolate, toasted malts. Chocolatety mayhem in my mouth right now, coffee/espresso, nice alcohol warming bitter coffee bean finish . Full bodied, creamy, smooth. Overall this beer was great, this beer aged well and tasted less like a coffee milk shake (as i thought it did fresh) and more like a great RIS. Very complex, rich and inviting."
"O: Make no mistake, this is a RIS. Some stouts/porters can be a bit lighter or a bit sweeter...this is neither. A very good beer and, though I haven't explored RIS-es a lot as of yet, I definitely think it's a winner. This was the first from a four pack-I look forward to the rest!"
"Overall: This is a sipper for sure with the higher ABV. I'm glad I tried it but my ""go-to"" RIS is still Brooklyn Black Chocolate. I would still say it's a ""must try"" for fans of the RIS style but I prefer my Imperial Stouts with a little less hop bite."
"Poured into a 16 oz snifter. Pours a slick black, with a 3 inch sticky mocha head, tons of lacing. Smell coffee, chocolate, some pine, and a hint of alcohol. Taste is all that, more piney hops than the smell would lead on. Body isn't the biggest, but nice. Perfect amount of life, helps it's dribkability. Temperature is so important to allow this beers flavors to completely shine, close to 55 is best. Lives up to the hype, most reviews I have ever noticed for this style."
"A nice hop forward stout that is nice on a cold night."
"O - Wonderful readily available RIS. A great go to for those cold nights (or early mornings). For what its worth I do not notice alot of chocolate, but my friend who hates chocolate thinks its very potent and avoids it just for a heads up."
"Old Rasputin truly is black gold. This beer is also one of the best values in my collection at 9 bucks for a four pack, compared to 14 - 15 for anything else that's similar in quality and size. Very highly recommended."
"O: Wow, flavor is awesome, drink it alone!"
"This is delicious, powerhouse beer making at it's finest. Dark chocolate flavors abound and the mouthfeel is sublime. I can't really say I've had a better stout. Creamy, smooth, exceptionally rich, and the aftertaste that seems to linger forever is better than anything I've had in this style of beer. Let it warm up a bit and it only gets better. Perfect companions: a nice maduro cigar and a shot of fine whisky. It gets no better."
"Since its an imperial, it could have a stronger roast profile, but no need to nitpick."
"O: One of the better Russian Imperial Stouts that I've had. Very easy to drink."
"Overall- I really enjoy this RIS. It is a brew that everyone should try it once. It's very well brewed with not many surprises, but you know exactly what you are going to get every time."
"O: Outstanding brew with no shyness to it. The alcohol presence does not hide itself but does not hijack this beer. It is very drinkable and enjoyable. I will turn to this one again and again."
"Overall: Great beer, one of my favorites. Have had it many times and draught is best. It is the model of a RIS, and holds up well to extended aging."
"Cheers and enjoy"
"D: I could drink it often and bottle after bottle, but of course I'd get into trouble that way. 3.5 because of the potential trouble."
"A really good beer that is meant to be enjoyed over time."
"Overall: A very solid beer. Outstanding coffee flavor with substantial chocolate as well. A very well balanced beer, especially considering abv, which is hardly noticeable."
"Overall, this brew is a great all around stout. One I have everyday access to and one that I will continue to purchase."
"Drinkability – This beer surprised me. It’s a well above average Russian imperial stout, and is extremely drinkable. The 9%abv is very well hidden."
"-Overall 4.0: Excellent stout. These ""Imperial"" or ""Russian Imperial"" stouts all have a relatively high alcohol content, but this is balanced by a depth of flavor and a drinkability not common in other high-alcohol brews. Really, these could be viewed as ""dark triples," due to the amount of ingredients that go into each beer. ""Old Rasputin"" is highly recommended. If you can find this beer, it is worth the monetary investment."
"Pours black and thick. Substantial tan head that forms of a billion tiny bubbles then morphs into a very slow fading creamy foam. Paints the inside of the glass as it recedes. Smells of roasted malts, some chocolate, hint of licorice. Mouthful is rich and thick - a real milkshake of a beer. Carbonation really hits just right for this beer. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, espresso beans, and dry baking chocolate. Finishes a little sweet w a kick of black licorice and some alcohol. Packs a wallop as far as stouts go - meaning a lot of the classic imperial stout flavors are here in strong showing. Really a well made beer. I know my home brew attempts at imperial stouts just can not get to this level."
"Overall: Very taste, great beer very rich powerful flavors, now when I think of how an RIS should taste it will be like this."
"O-Overall this is a solid brew. Decent smell and flavor. Definitely need to take your time with this one at 9% ABV. Sip this one slow."
"Pours a dark black with a large lasting head. Smells roasted with hints of chocolate and maybe some coffee. Tastes great, not my favorite RIS, but certainly amazing for the price. The flavor really blends well together in the mouthful and there’s a small alcohol taste that comes in during the mouthful but doesn’t affect the taste that much. Not the best RIS I’ve had but a very solid beer that is easy to pick up and relatively affordable. Certainly work keeping around."
"O - You gotta love Trader Joe's. ""A" beers right next to the ""why bothers"". It's all good and the high ABV revs this beer up that much more."
"This is a wonderful beer. I'm looking forward to adding this as a regular staple and exploring other RIS's as well."
"Old Rasputin is one of my favorite brews; I really enjoy Russian Imperial Stouts, but I always take time for an Old Rasputin. The mouthfeel is heavy, but very wonderful on a winter's night or a fall evening with friends by a fire. The taste is of burnt malt, some hops, and coffee/espresso. This jet-black beer is always welcome in my fridge or cellar."
"Overall: My first imperial stout so I don't have much to compare it to, but this beer is outstanding no matter how you look at it."
"Overall: This beer lives up to its reputation. Its a solid beer! Drank the 12th anniversary Rasputin last night and it was only fitting to follow it up with the non-barrel aged vesion tonite for comparison. Value priced for a big stout too!"
"O - A very good RIS with big flavor. This is what you think of when you think of a stout."
"Near jet black, ring of tan head, no lace to speak of. Smell is of big roasty malts, coffee, bakers chocolate, molasses, light dark sugary sweetness. Taste is of big roasted malts, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, long roasted finish, coffee grinds in aftertaste, light alcohol at points. Med-high carbonation, smooth and creamy, rich feel, would be perfect if the carbonation was toned down a bit. Really solid and hard to find faults in this, solid RIS."
"Overall this is an exceptional stout, overlooked in today's saturated dark beer craft world because of it continuous availability, but a real treat to find on draft at a local bar in my town."
"Thick as molasses as it pours, fills the glass as a deep black ruby with a thick tan 3 finger head, very good retention and lacing throughout. Surprised to at how hop forward the aroma is. Floral, blackberry, chocolate, oaky, earthy, boozy, caramel maltiness. Bitter hop bite up front, chocolate, roasted caramel, molasses, brown sugar, boozy, woody, chalky, smokey on the tongue. Very smooth finish for all the flavor, good full body, but does not overload the palate. Light warming down the hatch. Let this one warm up a bit, wonderful served at cellar temps, flavors really coming pouring out. Love it."
"O - I wish I knew the age on this, but since I don't I'll just have to pick up one or two 4-packs so I can try a bottle every 3 months or so. One of the better wide-spread RIS out there I have had."
"O- A shining example of a good Russian Imperial Stout. This is a real treat and a shame that my local wholesaler doesnt carry it. Very well-priced, as I can get this CA beer here in singles here in PA for about $3 a bottle."
"O: A big beer that does not disappoint. I can certainly see how this beer has gained it's cult status. I would recommend this to anyone who's into big stouts and would buy it again."
"Mouthfeel: Not too heavy, not too light. clean, but hearty. There's a tingle on the tongue for a while afterwords."
"Sampled on October 8, 2011. The pour is remarkably black with a decent, silky tan head. The aroma is mildly malted and pleasantly hopped with a bit of licorice and a scent that makes me think of a wooden barrel. The body is medium to bold. The flavor has a mellower than usual malty taste for a Russian Imperial with a vibrant bitter but dry hopped ending. All the good things that people say about this one are true."
"O - A very tasty stout, very enjoyable."
"O: A perfect cold weather beer. Its got a great boozy warmness to it. Flavor evolves as beer warms which keeps taste buds interested. Taste lingers for a long time. One of the best brews I've ever had. A must try."
"Taste is like the nose, burnt malt, but with a nice balance of hops in there that gives this drink a unique flavor to it beyond the standard russian imperial stout. Full, thick body, gas like - not the best stout body I've head, but a formidable competitor. Overall a great drink that is best paired with a great meal."
"Overall Drinkability - I want to give this beer all 5's, but since I'm rating it in style, it has some pretty stiff competition."
"In the short amount of time I've been exploring Imperial Stouts I can easily say that this the best I've come across so far. I'm happy to give it my highest recommendation."
"Overall- this is a truly excellent beer. A first-class representative of the style."
"Enjoying more than one of these is easy, if not dangerous because of the well hidden abv."
"O: Why buy any other Impy Stout? This is 7.99 a four pack, and it stands tall with all the limited, and the expensive. Old Rasputin: truly a dangerous brew."
"the way this beer sits on your palate is phenomenal. Roasted malts and some bitterness from the hops comes first followed by a chocolate/coffee aftertaste and the real weight of the hops. Very well balanced and a challenging mouthfeel for those who aren't used to imperial stouts. heavy but well balanced; like a good broadsword"
"O: Not my first Old Rasputin and not my last. This is my staple Russian Imperial Stout, not the best one I've had (Marshal Zhukov is out of this world from Cigar City:), but one that is readily available which gets brownie points. If you add a touch of Rogue's Chocolate Stout and a shot of espresso to Old Rasputin you will thank me for the recommendation."
"O – Delicious, big, complex, and well balanced. Could use a shade more integration between the flavors, but this is still one the best beers I’ve ever had on tap."
"o - this is seriously the epitome of a stout. highly recommended in all regards!"
"Overall - This is an all around fantastic beer. I honestly cannot find much wrong with it."
"This beer has a lot of hype, with having such a large following I had to cave in and try it. Poured into a snifter from a bottle, beautiful black body with a stunning imperial stout head. First sip..boom lots of carbination almost too much almost burned my mouth, I didnt like that so I let it sit for a few minutes to warm up and still too much carbination which I did not enjoy at all kind of killed it for me. Good beer just too much carb definitely a lot of other Imperials out there that are better. Check out Moylans Imperial its a lot more satisfying."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. I started drinking this fairly soon after it came out of the fridge. I started rating it and it really wasn't doing much for me, and the scores reflected it. I started to wonder how much of that was a result of it being too cold. So I've been letting it warm up, and giving it little nips every few minutes. It's starting to come around. I think I might take the rest of the six pack out of the fridge and just keep it at room temp. This had a nice, luscious, two finger crown at the top. The head seemed more fizzy than creamy. The nose is pretty faint. I all but inhaled beer through my nose trying to extract some kinda discernible characteristic, but I couldn't. It doesn't smell bad, so much as it just doesn't smell. The first thing I notice with the taste is the booze. The 9% is in your face, and not even remotely hidden. Some slight coffee notes, but mostly just...booze. When it was cold, the mouthfeel was very carbonated and really unpleasant. As it's warmed, it's gotten much creamier and coats the mouth with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Over all, I just don't get the fuss. I have three bottles left with which to form a different opinion, however. If it changes, I'll be back to edit..but right now, this just really isn't my thing."
" D ~ A solid stout for a very reasonable price. I could see this moving into six pack over the next few years. Purchased often."
"O: I had some high hopes for this one, but I believe I'm glad I only picked up a single of this one rather than a 4 pack. The beer itself is pretty good, the smell, and look of it are good, but I dont like the fact that it hangs with you after the fact. It reminds me of a black licorice type taste hanging around."
"O: This is one powerful beer, great by all means but powerful. I had a genetics test today… let me tell you this was the perfect thing after that test."
"Overall: An excellent RIS. One of my favorite beers. Hard to beat given the price and year round availability."
"O- good beer. Pretty easy going down for 9% and not much alcohol taste. This is a very solid stout"
"and easy to drink."
"O - An exceptional stout, a little too thin, but one I could drink all of the time."
"What an outstanding readily available brew!"
"O: very nice RIS, not my favorite, but perfect for a social gathering. will come back to this RIS."
"O- a delicious easy to drink and tasty RIS"
"O: I love this beer, it really is easy to drink and one i can see myself going back to over and over again. Fantastic brew and one i'm happy to recommend to others."
"Pours opaque black, with a cap of rich mocha brown head. There is a coffee, vanilla, roasted malt and a hint of alcohol in the nose. Taste is slightly chocolate, espresso, roasty malt, dark fruit and subtle vanilla. Very well balanced with a hoppy bitterness that matches the sweet elements. Creamy carbonation and a medium heavy body is very nice for the style. The ABV comes through at the end. It's warming. Also a subtle bitterness is re-established. Very pleasant finish."
"I tend to use this beer as an indicator of how far I've come in my conversion to good beer - I tried this a few years back and declared it undrinkable. Now it's something I crave with all the strong complex flavors. I'm sure it's a path most of us have been on - Cheers!"
"Overall - I have not had many imperial stouts YET - that will change after this incredible experience. Old Rasputin was Fantastic on tap, Highly Recommend, already looking forward to meeting up with friends at Slyce while enjoying pints of this in the coming fall/winter months."
"Dr: Very drinkable for its high ABV, but the alcohol is noticeable to its detriment. It's a high quality brew that I quite fancy, and I'd love to try it on draught, but it's not without its flaws."
"O-tons of flavor and a very big beer. Delicious and great example of the style."
"Notes: Nice opportunity to revisit it on tap… One of those invitational brews that stays up there, always worth a revisit. And for what it is the price-quality ratio of this serving is fantastic."
"Overall: Once again, this is a complex, flavorful stout. I was expecting it to be good, but not this good."
"O - An excellent beer! Outstanding nose, wonderful, dynamic flavor profile, and just an all-around quality example for the style."
"O: A solid stout. Big flavors, good balance and it uses the alcohol to enhance the beer, rather than just hiding it completely. It is certainly sweet, but not cloyingly so. Definitely a sipper."
"O: This is one damn fine RIS. I'm glad I revisited this after a long time, I didn't know what I was missing. The nose could use some work, but the taste is phenomenal. Will definitely buy again."
"O: an amazing offering for the style, this beer is downright yummy and perfect as a dessert beer. It feels smooth and it's full of taste making it a complete imperial stout that should be tried by any beer fan."
"Pours a pitch black with a huge chocolate colored head that seems to sit on top of the body of the beer for awhile. As the head diminishes thick lacing coats the sides of the glass. Smell notes of dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, and coffee. Taste chocolate, light coffee, a warm touch of alcohol. Carbonation is superb, but the beer seems a bit thin for a RIS. This beer is a great example of a RIS. Glad this is available year around."
"Solid beer. Good taste and satisfies that imperial stout urge on a budget."
"Overall: This is one of the most consistent and affordable Imperial Russian Stouts out there. In addition, it is available in 12OZ bottles! I had this beer at room temperature and I loved it! It’s no barrel aged stout but then again a 12OZ bottle of Old Raspy is only 1/6 the price of many of the popular imperial IRS bombers!"
"You really can’t ask for a whole lot more from an RIS. This is just flat out delicious! Despite the strength of this stout, or maybe because of it, I find it very easy to drink several of these back to back. It’s so good! As seems the norm for me, I feel the sweet spot temp wise is 55 degrees, when everything starts to explode from the glass. If you are a fan of RIS, this is one to search for, IMO."
"I look forward to drinking the other 3."
"Enjoy!"
"Old Rasputin pours black as onyx and is completely opaque with a huge, rocky, dark beige head. The flavor is massive and complex. Lots of roasted and bitter notes with a little bit of expected coffee and chocolate. I also got some dark fruits, like currants. The finish is long, lingering, dry, and woody."
"O - What an excellent balance of hops and dark roasted malt, in this lively RIS! Delicious."
"O - A very good RIS. One of the best for it's price."
"O - I think I want to see what the rest of this 4-pack will taste like in another year. If I can wait that long..."
"O: This was one of the first beers to really pull me into the craft beer world. It has a cult following for a reason and at $8 or less a four pack it is a great bargain. I do wish there was some medium between out of the bottle and on nitro though."
"One of the best R.I.S. I have had the pleasure of drinking. A classic beer for sure."
"O: Great beer, that is readily available. Highly recommended"
"Overall, I like this beer. I live in Memphis, so I'll wait until winter to try it again, but it's a really good beer."
"Overall: Very nice aroma. One of the best imperial stouts I have had. Excellent all the way around."
"Overall, a truly fantastic beer and a gem of an imperial stout. Can't go wrong with this one."
"Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout is an experience for sure. And while I prefer a crisper, hoppier beer this certainly got my attention and has 'warmed' me up to stouts that much more."
"O - I haven't had many Russian Imperial Stouts to compare with but this is by far my favorite"
"THE Imperial Stout brewers should look up to, respect, and admire."
"Overall: Old Raspy simply knocks your socks off. It's like good sex: overwhelming, caught up in the moment, with a nice lingering feeling afterwards that you've just had one of the finest creations on earth."
"This is the second time I have had this beer. I don't drink stouts too often but the bar was featuring it. The pour was done well as the bartender gave it a litle rest prior to filling the pint to the top. The foam appeared and dissipated in about a minute. Color was quite dark. Flavors of coffee and chocolate. Well balanced. More importantly - the aroma and taste was consistent with the last time I've had it. Had this with the dessert and found it to be a good pairing."
"O - Great stout. Just the way a RIS should be."
"O: Very nice drink. Probably my 3rd favorite stout. I would defiantly recommend and buy. Yeti and the stone Russian Imperial stout are on my top, but this is still a damn good beer. Defiantly pick this one up."
"O: Great rendition of the style, definitively one of the top three I have had..just wish it was little creamier and full bodied. Needs maybe another .5% Abv...but still nothing to rag about here"
"This is a really good RIS."
"D - As mentioned, this beer is my introduction into RIS's, and I definitely enjoyed my first. I must admit I'm not too fond of overly-hoppy beers, and I had my doubts on this one after the hoppy aroma, but the flavor turned out to be very well balanced and carefully crafted. Deceptively easy to drink too, making this one a bit of a sipper for a guy like me. This one really is a monster, but a tasty one at that. I'm happy to have three more bottles sitting around."
"Overall a good showing for the style and for North Coast Brewing Co."
"What I really like about Old Rasputin is its purity, simplicity. This is a rock-solid, clean, straightforward RIS that exemplifies the style."
"Again , I enjoy sweet stouts, like Murphy's, so make your judgements accordingly!!"
"O- My first nitro experience and I'm really impressed. This beer retains all of the great flavors of a Russian Imperial stout but the feel on this brew is really incredible."
"O – Overall this was a great beer. I’m really enjoying the imperial stouts in general but this is one of the best examples. If someone is looking to try an imperial stout for the first time this would be one of my top suggestions."
"Overall: This brew kicks my ass. I'm a IPA/APA drinker and so I love hops. But I also love artisan dark roasts of coffee. This is the necrobaby of these two worlds for me. I've been converted to the cult of Rasputin. Old Rasputin RIS will always have a special place in my fridge or in my collection. It is a beer-drinkers treasure and every drop should be savored. I believe that I could session this beer. Not because I'm going to be drinking more than 3-4 pints of it, but because it demands respect and that you cherish its company while it is there. This isn't your one night stand; wham, bam, thank you mam-- this is a beer that deserves to be cherished and treated like the gem that it is. This brew and I have a long life together. Cheers mate!"
"Overall- I've got to say this is one of my favorite beers. Affordable given other options and very drinkable. Excellent during winter and excellent for night in."
"pours from bottle to pint glass black as can be, an aggressive pour results in too much head flowing over the glass. smells of malts, roasted coffee and dark fruits. taste is amazing, more roasted coffee and caramel malts with a slight bittterness and burn from booze. mouthfeel is thick rich and creamy. lots of carbonation. overall one of my faves that i cant believe i havn't reviewed yet."
"O: For the barleywine fan in your life, Old Rasputin is almost as good as it gets. The nitro-tap presentation here adds another dimension of complexity and enjoyment to the mix. Dangerously drinkable at 9% ABV, this stout is a favorite to have on hand during the cold winter months but is a treat for a dreary summer evening as well."
"O - Always pleased when I pop open this beer. Intense beer. Great sipper."
"O: An indisputably high quality IS. Very, very rich."
"very good beer!! MUST TRY!!!"
"D/O: There is just a HINT of alcohol in this. Not nearly as noticable as something like Yeti or Mokah, but it still can be seen, and for me it's just a touch detracting from its drinkability/overall."
"O-Just a fantastic brew for being year round and in 4 packs... well balanced and for being 9% you cant even taste the alcohol but has a nice warming sensation going down...i would drink a 4 pack every week if i could...oh wait i can..."
"O - It's great and it's the cheapest RIS I've been able to find, which makes it a great choice when I'm in the mood for this style."
"overall i dont have a lot to add. this beer is what i will be dreaming of tonight. i think that old rasputin should outshine rasputin himself in the history books."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I drank one and poured me another one right after so it has to be a good beer one way or the other. I loved the hoppiness that comes with it. The rest of the flavors are a bit to clean and sterile for my likings. I guess I just like my Imperial Stouts to be dirty!"
"O: a lot like the bottle, more of a feel in the mouth and more to the nose, still an awesome beer that can not be overlooked."
"This is one not to be missed if you're looking to dip your toes into an IRS."
"This was a gift from a close friend to celebrate/mourn his moving away. I will definitely be seeking this out again, a great find."
"O - This RIS is awesome at its price point, but it is fairly average compared to some of the big name stouts out there, despite their high cost."
"O: Overall, quite a good RIS. Its different, with the light body and high hop presence, but I really enjoyed the taste, and for the price (under $3 for a 12oz) you really can’t go wrong."
"It was a real treat to find this on tap at Von Trier on North Avenue in Milwaukee, as I've rarely seen it around town. In some ways it lived up to the hype surrounding it, but in others it was a bit disappointing. It has more hops than most beers of this style, but that isn't really a detraction for me. I disliked the fact that too much alcohol was showing through and producing that medicinal or cough syrup effect. But, otherwise, it was a very smooth and complex stout that was engaging on every level."
"Remarkably drinkable."
"Overall: This beer is delicious. Dark , roasted and bitter. Just the way I like them. Top-notch and outstanding quality to price ratio. I highly recommend for experienced and sophisticated palette who love dark beer."
"O- This was really great on nitro, much better than on regular tap or bottle. It really made it a lot creamier and balanced out the stronger coffee and alcohol notes."
"Better as it warms. Creamy mouthfeel, alcohol well hidden."
"mouthfeel - creamy and smooth. the mouthfeel is almost a 5. best part of the beer."
"Overall - Well, I had heard so many friends call this one a ""classic"" brew. It didn't quite live up to the hype. It's just a well done, albeit basic, RIS. Probably a good candidate for introducing a greenhorn to this style. The smokiness and drinkability might make me reach for it again on occasion, especially to warm up with during the winter months. It makes me think about starting to smoke cigars for some reason..."
"A great standby RIS or a new one if you've not tried it... pours a midnight black oily substgance with a thin dirty looking layer of head...less than half a finger.... smells and tastes of dark roasted malts with hints of dark chocolate mixed with the slightest presence of coffee grains... a somewhat thick, smooth drinking substance that opens up and provides more character as it warms up.... when in doubt, old rasputin is the way to go!"
"Mouthfeel is relatively thick, as would be expected, but still may be a bit thin for the style. This is a very enjoyable beer - I think it might be a good example for neophytes to very strong dark beers. If you're a greenhorn and are looking to expand your beer-drinking, check this one out."
"This is an easy beer to drink, it is on the heavy side with a decent amount of carbonation but the alcohol is balanced in very well. Overall this is a fantastic beer and I am going to make sure that I have a few bottles in the house at all times. Its great to be able to get a solid RIS at a great price on a regular basis."
"O: Delicious, on-point porter."
"O- Its probably one of the best 7.99 4 packs of imperial stout you can get. Really My rating should be a little higher, I just remember this being a little taster before."
"Overall, a very good RIS. I'd like to try this w/ a year on it to ease off the burn. Even two years out. Prosit!"
"In a mediocre approach to this, I can best describe this beer by applying it to the ""King of Stouts"" in the manner that Budweiser is the ""King of Beers."" I can imagine Old Rasputin is what happens when the flavor of Guinness Foreign Extra meets the feel of Guinness Draught. But that's way to simple. Old Rasputin has an amazing full-bodied thick and creamy mouth that just isn't present in any other stout I've ever encountered. Somehow, the best of many worlds is what you get with Old Rasputin. Nevertheless, the taste packed an unpleasant bitterness on the swallow that I judged to be an imperfection and I was also disappointed with the alcohol, not that it was present, but rather its location on the palate. These of course are personal peculiarities that others may in fact love. I'd like to try this beer again however, exceptionally paired."
"Overall: Let me start off by saying fresh I do not care for this beer at all so I decided to age a couple for 1 1/2 years and it was the best decision I could have made. The flavor profile is so much nicer and the alcohol burn is gone. I really really enjoyed this beer so much that I actually cracked another one and put some vanilla bean ice cream in it and made a beer float and it was absolutely amazing."
"The menacing picture of Rasputin on the bottle is an appropriate start to this intimidating beer. Appearance is completely black; totally opaque with a big dark tan head. Chocolate scents are strong, with a slight alcohol smell on the nose as well. The chocolate carries into the taste, but is really overpowered by the hops - perhaps a bit too much. There is a grape or fig taste lingering in the background, with a surge of bitterness in the finish. Not quite what I was expecting. Mouthfeel is full-bodied. A good beer overall, but a very bold and heavy one that I'd not drink on a regular basis."
"M - Smooth with a slight oily feel and low carbonation."
"OVERALL: Make no mistake about it, this is a tasty and enjoyable beer. It’s just not a tasty and enjoyable imperial stout. This is an extremely hoppy brew, but it’s extremely hoppy at the expense of being extremely stout. If you like hoppy stout-like beers, this is definitely one worth tracking down. As far as imperial stout beer is concerned, however, this one is certainly lacking some of the patented flavors that define the style. This is certainly a brew I’ll have again, but not if I’m craving an imperial stout. Thanks for doing the legwork on this one Doops!"
"O: A very good Russian Imperial. If your not into the sweet chocolate IS's than this is definitely up your alley. Original post: (I was pretty disappointed with this beer. Maybe I just don't have the taste for Imperial Stouts yet. Loved the one Oatmeal Stout I tried. Got a Great Divide Yeti I'm gonna give a shot. Maybe I'll develop a taste for it.)"
"A Great example of why this is my favorite style of beer. Excellent when paired with the right food, but also a spectacular brew by itself. Will enjoy many more over the coming years. Glad this is available locally for only 8.99 a four pack."
"D - excellent dessert beer"
"A nice beer that I frequently go to when I'm in the mood for a nice, chocolatey stout."
"Be careful. Rasputin is a clever monk, and he'll creep up on you before you anticipate it."
"The body is on the lighter side and has a semi-dry finish."
"Overall, I love this beer. I still think it would make my top 5 all time favorites and at only $9 for a 4 pack, its price is hard to beat."
"O - Very impressed with this beer. On the smoother side of the IRS spectrum (from what I've had), and it works very well."
"Got this in a 4pak, last one on the shelf in a RARE find! Cost me $10 for the 4pak. Hell of a price for an amazing beer. I will be looking to get this one again and again."
"Overall I thought this was a very good RIS. Old Rasputin seems to live up to all the hype very easily and is pretty much all the things a good RIS should be. As it stands now this has to be one of the better RIS's I have had but Founder's Imperial Stout remains my favorite of this style, but Old Rasputin came pretty close. Everything was pretty spot on for it's style and the only thing I would have changed would be a little milder bitterness but I am sure six months to one year in the cellar could take care of that. This may become one of my go to RIS's, it is just so much more available then Founders Imperial Stout. If you are a fan of stouts then this is a must try, it sets a nice standard for RIS's. This beer made for a good first impression from North Coast and I now see why this beer gets so many high regards, combined with price and availability it makes for one damn fine brew, can't wait to see what else North Coast is working with."
"Easy to get around me, and still the one i gravitate towards"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, this is a classic hoppy Russian Imperial Stout. Full-bodied, full alcohol, big, bold, black and hairy."
"This beer is my favorite RIS to date. I love it for its awesome flavor, its great drinkability, and its price and availability. I always have a couple on hand. Highly recommended!"
"Overall - Tasty beer with an understandable reason why this beer gets a good amount of respect."
"Carbonation could be a little bit higher. Body feels nicely syrupy."
"O - I'm drinking this by itself, but it would go great with a big meal. Despite the high abv it's quite easy drinking ... perhaps a bit dangerous. Definitely a beer that I'll be buying again."
"If you are looking to jump from the Guinness-train and embark on a solo adventure into the dark world of imperial stouts - hitch a ride on this bad boy."
"Creamy pour from the bottle to my Sam Adams glass. A good three finger head of rich, tight foam, light brown, and delivering a moderate clinging lace. The color matches a 38 on the SRM beer color chart. Looks black until you hold it up to a strong light, then the reddish, dark brown color appears. Smell is a jack hammer of thick intense fragrances of dark chocolate, French brewed coffee, maple syrup, toffee, caramel, lime, and malt. The taste is very complex, with flavors of malt, dark chocolate, molasses, toffee, caramel, plum, and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, with a creamy sensation, and a prickly texture of carbonation. A great beer for a one time drinking session. I would like to have another at a latter date."
"I had anxiously awaited my first shot at this brew. Served on-tap at New Albanian Brewery. Poured a deep black with a two-finger head that was khaki-colored. Head retained very nicely and gripped to every inch of the glass. Aroma was somewhat hoppy but chocolate and coffee blasted through. Taste was much like the aroma, being dominated by chocolate and coffee with some nice hops up front. This brew masked the 9% very well. Medium-bodied and very smooth from start to finish. I typically am a hop-bomb IPA drinker and haven't experienced too many RIS but I was pleasantly surprised with this brew. Definitely will keep me coming back for more in the future. A must-try."
"Old Rasputin was one of the beers back in the day that turned me onto stouts. The alcohol is masked quite well. Rasputin tastes strong but not boozy. It's definitely a hopped up stout. The hops are more dominate than a lot of imperial stouts. The hop bitterness helps cut the richness a bit. This is one tasty complex brew. All these years later it's still standing strong."
"O: This is great on nitro and the creaminess makes it very easy to drink."
"O A classic RIS. Solid beer. Cheers!"
"A very to-the-book, English style Russian Imperial Stout. Far less hoppy than many of its American counterparts, and in my opinion, better for it. I would like a little more sweetness and malty richness, but otherwise, there is little to criticize."
"O: Very good beer. If you love imperial stouts, they don't get much better."
"O: Good beer but could be better balanced. For beers with this high level of alcohol, I prefer ones that are somewhat sneakier and smoother and do a better job of masking the alcohol."
"Overall - The bitterness is its only flaw. Otherwise, a fantastic RIS. Amazing that it is this good and this easy to come by."
"O- Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite in the style. Maybe not the best, but it's up there. Do yourself a favor if you like RIS, and pick this one up- it's exceptional."
"Pretty tasty brew. Its not as complex and dynamic as I would like, but I'm definitely starting to pick up different things as it warms. Particularly, the alcohol."
"The mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth. Thick, heavy bodied and lesser carbonation than the bottled version. Overall, the nitro makes it beautiful in the glass, makes it go down smoother and makes it slightly more easy to drink. The tastes are less outstanding but still good. Again, still a great brew."
"O- Very impressed how well this beer does on nitro. Will definitely have again and again."
"I'm not too far into stout territory but this beer is fantastic, exceptional example of the style. Don't make the mistake of serving this too cold."
"Overall, i can see why this is ranked by many as the top year-round RIS. Complex, drinkable, interesting, well balanced brew. Hats off to Palais Imports for bringing this to Australia."
"Wow, I knew what this was going to look like after having it from the bottle a few times before. The Nitro just sets this brew off right from the start. It's got the deep black stout look to it. With a wonderfully thick creamy tan head that leaves a fantastic lacing down the glass. The smell has some pine on the nose with a deep roasted aroma following after. The taste is explosive, it's hoppy and has a masterful chocolate taste. The finish is dry and smoother than just about any beer I've ever had. The mouthfeel is creamy, heavy and silky smooth. Overall I never wanna have this from a bottle again. If you see this on Nitro it's a must have!"
"Strong malt and coffee smell. Chocolates and roasted malts as well in the nose. a lot of chocolates that are quite bitter in the taste . Tons of carbonation. This is very think and chewy beer, a bit hard to drink a lot at a time, took me almost 30 minutes to finish one. This is a crazy beer with alot to offer and plays games on the palette."
"O: Sampled this on tap at The Alibi Room in Vancouver. I normally hate anything nitro but this had a good mouthfeel and the taste wasn’t watered down either. I would however like to try this not with nitro to see the difference."
"O: Delicious and not overpowering. 4.5"
"Overall: A top notch brew, I had to get it when I saw it on tap."
"A solid RIS, which I admit is not my favorite style. Still, this beer has tons of character and flavor to keep things interesting."
"Overall - A distinct taste that's affordable and available; a great introduction to RIS that I will definitely revisit!"
"overall, definitely a solid imperial stout, with the slight twist of a strong hop presence."
"This beer pours nearly pitch black with a 1 finger tan head. the smell is roasted malt and cocoa. the taste follws suit with a wonderful hints of dark chocolate and a good roasted malt profile. the mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with appropriate carbonation to style. overall this beer is by far the best deal when price and availability are taken into account for a russian imperial stout."
"A wonderful example of IRS. Top value!"
"Very good stout. Probably a notch below my favorite Guiness Foreign Extra Stout. The look is black with brown head that dissapates. Smells like dark chocolate, cigar and toasted bread. The taste is thick and similar to the smell-dark chocolate tobacco, but with a nice hop bitterness that is very balanced."
"D - Good drink, makes a fantastic RIS; can't go wrong with this one; North Coast is definitely a leader in the field of micro brewing; deservedly so"
"O- By far the best beer for the money that I've found thus far. Has a very distinctive and refined taste and smell. It's not perfect, but this is one of my favorite beers, and in my opinion it deserves great affection."
"Definately one brew thats been on my list for a little bit and finally get to knock it off and it pours a dark as night black hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a two finger creamy coffee laced head and heaps of lacing,the smell is oak,strong black liquorice,strong mocha malts and dark fruity hops,it has a lucious creamy full bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and starts off with tastes of creamy cappicino,bitter mocha,dark bitter belgian chocolate and finished with a dark fruity hoppy bitterness that really warms you up and the alcohol is really only sensed with the finishing warmness and on a cold night like tonight in the hills its truly appreciated the only downfall from tasting this is that i dont have another one therefore the next brew has alot to top cheers."
"Wow. This is a heavy hitter- the intense tastes and a heavy mouthfeel make for a beer I typically would only want one of, but I found myself desiring more after I finished the 12oz bottle. Very complex, but tasty. Definitely will be looking forward to having this one again, as well as some other offerings from Lost Coast."
"O: Overall, this is a wonderful yearly RIS. Not much to say about this other than it's really very tasty and easy to obtain. Well done. If only the mouthfeel were a bit thicker this would be nearly perfect."
"O-A great imperial stout, satisfying on every measure. Tons of flavor without anything overwhelming, highly recommended."
"O: overall is a very complex and heavy style stout that I think does justice to russian imperial stout. one my most favorite beers and I will be buying this regularly."
"Poured into a DFH Signature glass from a 12oz bottle. This beer pours black with a large lingering tan head that leaves lots of lacing. Noticeable aromas of roasted malt,chocolate,coffee,cherries,and anise rise from the glass. Strong roasted flavors,coffee,dark chocolate,with hints of dark fruits and plums. This beer also has a deep bitter component with a rich character. The only real knock on this beer is that the mouthfeel was a bit thin for an Imperial stout,if it was more viscous it would be an A+ beer to me. Any alcohol flavor is well hidden among the well balanced complexities and the great bitter coffee/licorice finish."
"Narrative: NOBODY BUT NO BODY KICKS OLD RAZZIE OUT OF THE ROLLER RINK. Ok, keep your cool, you know that you are a smoothe debonaire guy, but how can those girls fail to see your individual aplomb and flair? It just isnt right! You have your velvet chocolate coat, your smoothe ways, your bitter discountenance but they all seem to write you off for guys in Pele Pele Jeans and southpole shirts. Where did you go wrong? Maybe it was the fencing lessons, maybe it was talking to every girl in the roller rink. Razzie you spread yourself too thin. How could I have been so stupid? Well, there's only one thing these size 11's needs and thats a sick game of redlight green light. Time to narrow the scope and impart some chocolately velvety goodness to the masses."
"Overall an awesome beer, especially for something with such high alcohol. I'm loving the darker beers in general nowadays."
"O - Not much to go with here. Age this and enjoy!"
"Overall - One of the best stouts I've ever had I wish more stouts tasted like this. Big props to the brewery on this I haven't liked a stout this much since SS oatmeal stout. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"note: as beer warms, i get more of a red liquorice type taste.."
"O - An impressive beer. But not as refined as I was expecting. Maybe a little aging will do it some favours."
"Overall, this was a good stout. I think with a thicker body that this beer could be amazing but what can you do? Not mad that I have 2 more in my fridge, but not dying to crack them open either"
"D/O: Before imperial stouts were cool, there was North Coast's Old Rasputin. I remember the first time I tried it during Winter 2001-2002--when craft beer meant Sierra Nevada pale ale, Alaskan amber, Widmer wheat, or whatever stout I could get at the local brewpubs--and it was shocking to the senses. I may have thought that no beer should taste as this does. Now the beer endures, and it offers an honest look at how my palate has changed in a decade. Now (and especially on nitro-tap) it is a mellow and even old-fashioned take on the style, with a drinkability that is off the charts compared to its contemporaries. While some strong members of the porter-styles seem to struggle to separate roasty from smoky qualities, this is all roast and no smoke. It is chocolatey at the front-end, with a small finish that leaves room for that dessert such a beer is expected to accompany so well."
"Had this out of a bottle poured into a pint glass. First thing that stands out is the awesome look to the pour as the tan/brown head forms out the the opaque black beer. Ended up with about 2 fingers of creamy head. It fell back fairly quickly leaving a sticky lacking on the glass. The aroma was heavy with roasted malt, with hints of coffee and chocolate. Didn't catch any alcohol though from the 9% abv. Very smooth and creamy, with a nice balance of sweetness and chocolate, with bitterness from coffee and strong roasted malt flavors. Finishes cleanly with a slight lingering sweetness. While I didn't catch any in the nose, there is definitely a slightly warming alcohol present as you drink. Nothing overpowering or unpleasant though. Fairly light carbonation fits nicely with the rich full bodied beer. Overall I am impressed. One of the first true stouts I've tried and the introduction was well done. Might be setting the bar pretty high for the style"
"A very good stout, along the lines of Guinness' extra. Plus Rasputin is on the bottle. Pours a dark brown-black with a finger of tan head that recedes to a fine layer of lace. Heavy dark malt aroma, chocolate and coffee notes. Roasty taste of dark malts, coffee, dark chocolate, with hints of licorice, tobacco, raisins, and brown sugar. A bite of bitterness and alcohol in the finish. Smooth, strong, and a very tasty drink."
"O - The best Imperial Stout I've had thus far and will probably be the litmus tests for future tastings within the style. Good stuff."
"And the taste? Wow! Liquid heaven. Very complex, and oh, so smooth, like a velvet hammer. This stuff could kill you. I taste hops, roasted malts, and then rich, dark chocolate before the long, sweet finish. This beer is not for everyone: Big Boys only need apply. It's one of my absolute favorites; it just doesn't get any better than this."
"Looks good, smells fine but taste is where this one really shines. The best way I can describe it is Abyss Light. Licorice, molasses, a roasted quality that isn't over the top. Not too syrupy. Maybe a touch over-carbed but combined with the medium body, it makes it about as sessionable as an RIS can be."
"O - overall i thought this beer brewed well for its genera. I'm not going to go out and by cases of it but I wouldn't turn it down"
"This beer has earned its legendary status. It's probably the finest imperial stout I can get my hands on (at least until I make it to Dark Lords Day)."
"O - Very good stout, one of the better ones you can find in Delaware on a regular basis."
"Near black with a thick, beige head that leaves a thick sheet of lacing all over the glass. The aroma is of heavy roast, slightly charred, with subtle chocolates. The flavor is slightly smoky, with chocolate notes. The finish brings an interesting combination of charred roast and hop bitterness. A classic beer and a tasty stout. I will always go back to this brew."
"I've had a few 4-packs of Old Rasputin before and they've consistently been excellent stouts. Highly recommended."
"Old Rasputin was nearly black in color. It had a large brown head with good retention and sheets of lace. The smell was coffee, chocolate, and dried fruit. The taste was chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and hops. The finish was dry with a good bitterness and lingering roasted malt flavor. The mouthfeel was excellent with a full body and gentle carbonation giving it a silky and creamy texture. Overall this is an excellent Russian Imperial stout and highly recommended."
"O - A very good beer. I plan to cellar the rest of them and return in a year's time to check on their maturity."
"This is an awesome beer! I love Stout and I drink this beer when I am in a very good mood. Today I found it very very very cheap then the normal price I found. Nice smooth drinking imperial stout. Great taste and very easy finish stout. I found this at Trader Joe's at a very good price. Try it!"
"This is an awesome stout that is perfectly put together. Nothing about this stout is over the edge in flavor. Drinking a few bottles of this in one sitting is not a problem at all. Goes down smooth and tastes even smoother."
"O: A very nice stout that I think I chilled a bit too much for the start. The flavors came out more pronounced after being glassed for about 5 minutes. Definitely worth a try."
"Na Zdorovie!"
"D: This drinks quite nice. I like the hop presence. The hops and alcohol are enough to make you sip and savor this brew, no matter how bad you want to keep drinking it. This has become my go-to Russian Imperial Stout. Outstanding value."
"O: Once the initial kick of the spiciness fades, the flavors mellow and reveal themselves in sequence. A fantastic brew that truly deserves its classic status. An unbelievable bargain, to boot, makes this a no-brainer as a stout staple in everyone's beer fridge. Quite possibly my favorite brew to date; I enjoy finishing the evening with this masterpiece."
"Moderate amount of alcohol burn is noticeable, but doesn't take away from the overall excellent character of the beer. If anything, it's a nice reminder of the abv and that I shouldn't ask for a million pours."
"Taste-dark roasted coffee and malt,figs, faint smoke, hopleaf and tobacco. Rich and complex meld of semi-sweet, roastiness and hops. Sip slowly and with respect to the strength. Is that a blessing or a curse from the Mad Monk on the label? Judging from this excellent Russian Imperial, it is a blessing indeed!"
"If you like Imperial Stouts, or want to try something that will put your taste buds on a fun ride this excellent beer is highly recommended."
"O: Overall, a solid imperial stout and a nice value for its price. It's lacking in complexity, though, with the roasted malts and hops creating a bitterness that masks any subtleties."
"O: Great quick pint this day. The beer is a bit different out of the bottle, Co2 draft, and nitro. Old Raspy is the staple and standard of the RIS for me, as it was the first I can remember that woke me up to just how simple the dry irish style of Guinness is in contrast, and how much more of a Stout, the RIS is."
"O: Loyal to the style, this beer is worth trying. Solid flavor blend with no real drawback other than a limited nose."
"Great value and an excellent example of the style, but not stellar."
"O - Dangerously easy to drink. At 9% this one will sneak up on you quickly. A very enjoyable RIS that is one of the better American made versions available. Priced at $4 at Frisco, I am very happy."
"3.5-4-4.5-3.5-4.5 = A-"
"Very dark, black as night; a nice brown rocky head with good retention. Highly roasted malt aromas and alcoholic to the nose. Smooth, potent and espresso like with a high burnt malt and hop bitterness that finishes on the sweet side to say the least. Very complex, and true to its style. I love this beer and always enjoy it at the end of hard day's night!"
"Overall: Slightly disappointed by this beer...I'm not a fan of sour, especially in an RIS...but the sourness doesn't completely destroy the taste. I'd rather have a Stone."
"I love this beer. 12 ounce bottle poured slowly into a pint glass, so no real head (I like it that way, hence the gentle pour). Lacing is pretty good despite the gentle pour. Breathing in the scent, one knows what imperial stouts should be. Strong malt and coffee/caramel aromas that the tastes match. A bit on the heavy side, but it IS an imperial stout and it should be. It lingers on the tongue and in the mouth with a hearty feel. Definitely a recommendable beer to anyone who likes stronger flavors and thoroughly solid beers."
"Age it and it will be great!"
"Very good overall and the label is cool too."
"A good feeling beer thats tart and bitter with warming alcohol deep into the aftertaste of this brew. A good well made beer."
"O - Nice beer, especially at this price. Will have to pick up a four pack."
"D: Erred a bit on the boozy side for my taste."
"O - one of my personal favorite russian imperial stouts that i have had to this day. it just seems to never get old and always seems to end up back in my fridge."
"O: This is a monster! How I forgot. Dark and heavy with great burnt malt and hop profile. It excels for me in a world of syrupy RIS' that have gone over the top sweet. A welcome relief. How lucky that I can get it all the time."
"O: Wow. I am very pleased and impressed. I am becoming a bigger and bigger Imperial Stout fan and this is serving to continue that trend. Dynamite beer."
"O: This is a big beer. Its biggest elements, however, can substantially diminish its complexity. Still, a very nice RIS. I would love to have this on-tap sometime."
"Medium-high body"
"O: This beer has more hops and carbonation than your average RIS, making it somewhat unique, but the smell is better than the taste"
"D: Great flavors combine well for an excellent tasting brew. I couldn't drink much more than this one at a time because of the heft and alcohol. This beer got better as the time went on... very nice. I may look for another to store away for a year or so and see what I get."
"Overall it's a one trick kind of thing in a way and not complex but jesus it is done so well on nitro. Exceptional drinking right here this is like adult playtime right here, small children and small tastes need not apply. Pure win plain and simple!"
"This is one damned good beer."
"I would be hard pressed to find a better best buy than this one."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a good thick head of chocolate colored foam. Has a strong scent of roasted malts and hops. The taste was heavy and long lasting. I was really surprised to see some foam stick around til the very end. Definetly a must try!"
"O- Really good complex beer that you can get year round"
"Overall a very drinkable RIS. Probably would not buy again but at the same time I would not turn one down. The bitterness is the only real thing that is turning me off about it."
"Overall this is a great beer. It might not be the best RIS but it is an excellent representation of the style and fairly easy to find at a reasonable price which makes it a great go to stout."
"Overall: Year round Russian Imperial Stout at about $10 a 4 pack after tax. I will gladly get this any time. I wish I bought it more but always get caught in the seasonal stout assault and lose a lot of my desire for stouts come spring and summer. This is my go to stout in the summer when the craving does hit. Available everywhere I go. Buy it, you will not be disappointed if you like big stouts."
"My first RIS and I loved it would def recommend! May be a bit intense for an amateur beer drinker and those that do not have a great love for stouts."
"O- Quit delicious, very smooth, easy to drink for an Imperial Stout, really solid."
"With such an afforable and just price, I will be picking this brew up again in the future, just not going out of my way to seek it out."
"Overall. Great RIS. Pretty easy drinker considering the fullness of body and flavour."
"O: Above average imperial stout, but no real robust dominant flavors that jump out at you. Pretty good all around besides the strong alcohol in the nose."
"O - Overall a very delicious beer. Incredible for something so widely available and relatively inexpensive. The value and availability make this the go-to ""everyday"" beer in the RIS style, but it's not diminished in any way. It is simultaneously really easy to get and impossibly complex and delicious."
"A slow sipper meant to be savored and a great value to boot, under $8 for four of these bottles. Pleasant all around and a good portal into the world of RIS."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours nearly pitch black with three fingers of lumpy, toasted brown foam. Very nice lacing and good visible carbonation. Nose is rich and sweet with notes of coffee, cocoa, a little caramel, and some alcohol. Thick like chocolate milk on the palate with excellent carbonation. Not much hop character. The malt isn't overbearing, allowing dark chocolate flavors to play on the palate and become more pronounced in the finish. Very easy to drink for 9% abv. The mouthfeel and palate are very well rounded so you don't feel super weighed down. Still, its obvious why they only sell it in 4-packs. Its a big brew meant for moderation and special occasions. Happy Friday to me :)"
" I would certainly be into this again and would definately love to get a hold of it in a growler from a nitro tap. This isn't in my top 5 of Imperial Stouts but it is a very nice selection for those of you wanting an enjoyable beer. Enjoy!!!"
"Overall: An exceptional stout across the board."
"well done North Coast."
"Overall, this is a hell of a value, and I will be picking it up regularly."
"D- Because of how smooth it is for an RIS, this one can easily be enjoyed one delicious sip at a time. Exquisite creaminess. One of the richest and boldest RIS's one can find. It still amazes and pleases me that this is available year round."
"O- This is a sipper for sure, 9% ABV, and finishes clean, rich and warm. Its like being wrapped in a soft blanket on a chily spring night. No flowers here just GREAT BEER!"
"Smells complex with dark fruity notes and chocolate, taste follows with malt sweetness, maintaining great balance. Feels great and over all this experience was good, but nothing like on tap. on tap it's out of this world."
"A simple yet complex RIS. Consistent and delicious, not to mention affordable."
"O: This is a very enjoyable Imperial Stout. I have the feeling this beer ages very well and maybe helps out the sugar to come out a little bit more. But still, this beer has a lot of character and isn't your typical Imperial Stout. Drinkability is really good also."
"This is a darn good imperial stout. It's fruity and hoppy, but still well-balanced, and the thick but light mouthfeel is really nice. The alcohol is completely invisible. Likely to become a staple."
"D- 3.5 Truthfully, I don't think I could do more than one of these bad boys. It is a bear of a beer. It means business. I think its flavors are intense and it is clearly powerful at 9% ABV. However, I wish it were a bit more intricate. I'm glad I tried it though, and it may be better for you if you're a fan of the style in general."
"Overall a very good stout. I like it."
"For an RIS, it drinks relatively easiy. The slightly lower ABV hides well and it's not really overbearing on the palate. Is it enjoyable? Yes. Is it safe? Yes. Is it too safe? Perhaps. Next to Founder's IS, this is the most standard-smelling and tasting imperial stout that I've tried, but it doesn't really shine in any particular category. FIS offers considerably more in complexity and flavor. The best quality for Raspy is in the smell; I'm really enjoying that milk chocolate aroma. It's a very nice entry into the style and I ought to have tried it earlier. Bonus points for absolute ease in finding this all over the place."
"Food Pairing: Grilled Foods, Beef, Spiced Pork, Curry, Full Body Cheeses, Lamb, Seitan, Ham, Spicy Cold Cuts, Chocolate, Pumpkin"
"Overall a solid imperial stout. Nice mix of hops and malts That really balance nicely to create an interesting and tasty brew."
"overall- good, could be thicker, not sweet fairly pure stout , not overly complex"
"overall a great beer, i'll now have to invest in another sixer and age it."
"D - at a high ABV and full bodied mouthfeel, with a challenging (but very good!) flavor, I wouldn't want to drink more than one or MAYBE two on the coldest of winter nights, but this is a very enjoyable beer and one I've been wanting to try for a long time. I've had one other beer from this brewery which I really enjoyed - I'll have to try some of their other lineup."
"O: I was really impressed by this one. I had it on tap a few weeks ago and was underwhelmed. Perhaps my palate was a bit off that night."
"overall - I am not sure if it is this batch but it does not have that much flavor. It does seem like mine were pretty damn potent and above 9% ABV. Not sure if that is even possible. I just found this stout, good for a nice buzz but the flavors just were not there. I probably wouldn't buy it again. I have had another beer (Belgian golden ale) from North Coast called the ""Pranqster"" and that one is delicious."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one (and the hundred or so I've had before). I had yet to sit down and actually grade it so I'm a little surprised at my score, but I would definitely recommend this one."
"O: Great way to finish the day."
"Holy smokes this is a nice stout! Poured brownish-black in color with a small dark tan head. A mellow alcohol and fruity notes make a soft aroma. This is one full-bodied stout starting with roasted coffee and creamy malt flavors. Very smooth overall and the alcohol isn't as apparent in the taste as in the aroma. At 9% this is very drinkable on this cold rainy afternoon. If not for a lingering bitter aftertaste I would have rated it higher."
"O- A fantastic IRS... I've had better, I've most certainly had worse... but at under $9 a 4-pack, it's a steal!!!"
"O: A really great beer, a go to in the style for sure, especially at the price. I got this bottle at a place that does a $10 happy hour for a burger and your choice of beers, so I consider that to be an amazing deal."
"A 12 0z bottle (from Pinnochios) into a snifter poured black with a large three-finger, mocha-colored head. Lacing was heavy and lasting. Nose was roasted malt, chocolate, nuttiness and some alcohol. Taste shows the malt and nuttiness, some coffee, caramel, and a nice hop kick to provide a really nice and complex journey. Finish is on the dry and pleasantly bitter side. Mouthfeel is medium and a little syrupy with lively carbonation. This is delicious and, even though it is not my favorite style, I will be back!"
"O= not cheap stuff at like US$5.99 a bottle. Definitely worth the try though and if you can find it readily and affordibly availahle and you're in the mood, a definite session til you drop into a stupor from the 9%ABV."
"Overall: This is one of the best high ABV beer's I have ever had. It shines both in malt and hop characteristics. This is the best desert beer i've ever had that doubles as a party beer. I could drink a few Old Raspy's without regrets."
"O- I am not a humongous stout fan, but this one performs quite well in my books."
"Overall: A great example of a Russian Imperial Stout that's widely available."
"All in all, nitro has done some interesting things to one of my old standbys. The hops are definitely accentuated, turning this into a surprisingly rounded and balanced RIS. Which I like... although i almost miss the heavy coffee, chocolate, and rich malt that i'm used to."
"O - Overall this is a really great RIS that is almost always available, never a bad choice."
"Not my favorite style, but a well done beer none the less"
"Overall a great example of a RIS. Very complex as some of the taste seems to come in combination, as well as the aromas. It's a ""man""ly brew and not for the weak. My fav RIS"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This Russian Imperial Stout pours motor oil black. Nicely carbonated and great thick brown head. The stout has an average amount of lacing. The stout has an aroma of burnt malt, chocolate, and expresso. The aroma is outstanding! The taste is complex you get the malty burnt taste which gives way to chocolate and expresso. This beer tastes exactly like it smells! Great! There is also a nice afterthought of bitter hops and has a nice warm finish. The warming effects of the 9% alcohol cap off each sip. Awesome beer, Simply Awesome! Can't wait to try more offerings from North Coast Brewing!"
"O - Good robust stout. Standard warm, rich flavored RIS. Roasty, rich and warm on the way down."
"There are winners and losers of this variety. Ladies and gents this is a winner. And a bargain too. Under 10 bones a four pack is a no brainer. Seek it out."
"I could drink this all night, although at 9% ABV that may not be for the best. All in all, an excellent RIS."
"O - Great example of a RIS, and on of the best pairings of beer/food, after a mesquite barbeque pork loin. Very delightful."
"Fantastic!!"
"This beer is black with a very small tan head. The glass has quite a bit of tan lacing on the side. The smell is of burnt caramel, chocolate, toast, dark fruit. The taste is very complex, dark fruit sweetness, roasted malt, coffee bitterness. It feels good in the mouth with a good amount of carbonation and a rich heaviness. It is a beer that one drinks slowly because of its strength and richness. It may be my favorite beer."
"D - Too big to be really drinkable. A good imperial stout, but the taste wasn't my favorite and the amount of alcohol made this a special occasion beer."
"Notes: Overall it's a classic well made and well balanced example of an Imperial Stout."
"Definitely one of the go-to imperial stouts out there; affordable and easy to find."
"I'll take the bottled version any day, but Old Rasputin is still thoroughly enjoyable in the the nitrogen format."
"D: Though the roasted flavors last a little too long, the beer is a pleasure to drink, giving you a unique and challenging taste for your palette."
"A fairly bitter aftertaste is left in the mouth but it is pleasant and warming, not annoying. While the taste rivals any other stout I've ever had as the best, the mouthfeel of Old Rasputin is so smooth and creamy that it literally feels like I'm drinking silk. It makes the beer in the end, because the taste, smell and appearance of this beer are all great, but the mouthfeel makes the beer special. Drinkability is relatively high for how strong a beer this is. Overall this is a beer that I will buy again and again when I'm in a stout mood."
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers. My favorite style is quadrupel but I definitely love a Russian Imperial Stout like this one. Lets see if the Dogfish Head World Wide Stout that I have chilling in my fridge for next weekend can impress me as well."
"D- A beer to enjoy for sure. No need to rush this one but it doesn't mean I don't want to. For a good stout that's widely available, this one fits the bill."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle deep, dark brown, almost black color with a one finger tan head that dissipates into a heavy collar. Can't get a read on the carbonation that may be going on in the near blackness. Aroma is a rich, thick smell of roasted, toasty malt. There is a hint of coffee and smoke, and it's a pleasantly sweet aroma. 1st sip is a thick, rich, creamy shot of dark unsweetened chocolate, black unsweetened coffee, smoky peat, bitter hops, and alcohol! There's a lot for the tastebuds to process here! Mouthfeel is also thick, rich, & creamy. This beer is stout in every sense of the word! As for drinkability, these are so potent I think 2, maybe 3 is all I could do in one sitting, but that's not meant to be a negative. This ain't some weak-ass lager for playing quarters with! Overall, a fantastic sensory experience! Sip, savor, and enjoy!"
"A great smooth RIS."
"Drinkability: Other than the alcohol content creeping up on you I would say have quite a few of these."
"Pours black coffee with a dark foam that shrinks down to a small surface cover. Faint smell, coffee, sherry, little burn in the belly. Not to much sweetness, but not too bitter. Very mellow for the alcohol content. Nice sipping beer. My friends really liked it as well."
"Overall-Very drinkable beer. What makes this beer taste even better is b/c your getting a bargain, 799 a 4pk. Great beer to keep in your fridge without breaking the bank."
"A great brew to enjoy. Cheers!"
"Such a great beer. This one looks, smells, and finishes among the top beers you'll ever have. As with all the most worthy stouts (at least for me), it's all about the finish and Old Rasputin does not disappoint. It's medium-bodied taste hangs pleasantly in the palette for quite awhile. My only wish would be a more full taste. Regardless, this beer will be enjoyed at my house for a long time to come."
"drinkability; such a powerfully flavorful drink, without overwhelming the palate, quite an easy drink that sits perfect with me."
"Drinkability - Man!!! This is really a great brew. I've been hearing and reading a lot about Old Rasputin and it doesn't disappoint. It's rich, bold and smooth. The alcohol is there for the first few sips, but then becomes practically non-existant. This beer is easy and enjoyable to drink. The high ABV may deter some, but all around it's a really good beer and worth a try."
"Drinkability: Very good beer overall. Great balance, especially with so much going on here. Will definitely be buying this again."
"D: Hugely drinkable, not filling or overly sweet. Highly recommended."
"black as the devils backside, this russian imperial stout is freaking delicious. light hazelnut top with a distinct chocolate flavor accompanied by a rich coffee aroma. interesting how both the coffee and chocolate are in balance with eachother, while maintaining their boundries. delicious"
"D - Very drinkable. Lots of flavors that are really nicely balanced and fairly complex, but it does not drink super heavy."
"D - Wow, this is a stellar stout. Everything works so well with another. The ABV is hidden big time thanks to the coffee qualities of this stout. Very tasty."
"For me, I don't drink stouts too often. Usually like to have a nice meaty meal, which is something I don't have too often. But when I wanna have a stout, especially a RIS, this is an absolute go-to beer. Fantastic. Could drink this often."
"I could have another. Seems to get a little heavy but nonetheless a very tasty beer."
"Black with a nice mocha creamy foam. The nose is all stout, coffee, cola, molasses. The taste is not quite up to the nose but has a nice roasty malt and espresso flavour. There is a slightly sour note and its creamy, dry and has a smokey charred finish. This is a decent stout but there is no way that this is 9%. The ABV is very well hidden."
"D: Overall, this is an excellent beer. I really enjoy this stout!"
"I think this might have been the first RIS I ever had, and I've drank a lot of it since then. This is a lovely example of the style, and a fantastic beer."
"M&D- A full flavored and textured brew. I nice malt addition."
"All in all, an excellent RIS with great drinkability. My only complaint is the mildness of the flavor. It was almost like drinking a 1% chocolate milk. I have heard claims that this beer ages well and I am definitely interested in seeing how this would affect it."
"D - Drinkability is high. For anyone looking to get into Russian Imperial Stouts, I wouldn't recommend anything else besides this. It scores high for me on all facets, and for the price point it can't be beat. This will be a regular staple for me when looking for a solid representation in the style."
"Pitch black with a light brown creamy head that is very inviting. I have to be a little lenient on the aroma because some is lost when a beer is served via nitrogen. All I can discern is roasted malts with a slight licorice edge. The flavor is somewhat muted with burnt malt, chocolate, and a slight metallic flavor. The nitrogen thins out what would normally be a substantial body. I usually feel that what is lost in putting a beer on nitro is made up for with the creaminess that is imparted. In the case of Old Rasputin, I really would stick to drinking it with normal CO2. While tasty, not as good as the original."
"On the whole, this beer is a warming, strong ale that I am happy to say protects me from the Ithaca cold!"
"Drinkability: Definitely good, but like most RISs, the weight and ABV pull it down a bit. Definitely a great beer for a cold night and ultimately, it's kind of one of the defining beers of the style."
"D: Highly drinkable, in small quantities. This may be the best beer I have yet to put in my mouth, but I will struggle to finish 12oz. It is no session beer; at 9% ABV, but it is a very very special drink. I just really love this beer!"
"Very respectable. It would get higher marks form me but the mustiness is a little off-putting."
"D: I could drink more of this, but it's not something I would drink one after another. It's very strong and would go well by itself as a sipper or with something with a robust flavor like smoked cheese and sausage."
"D: overall a very good RIS that is pretty easy to find at most bottle shops. ive read that this is a good one to put away for some time and it will really enhance some nuances in the flavor so get some and do just that, i know i will."
"D: Ok....regardless of the mouthfeel this beer is fantastic. I have a growler full tonight and it's going to be polished off. Great offering."
"D- Great for the style, one of the most drinkable RIS out there."
"D: Very drinkable. Alcohol is present, but not overpowering. Would definitely purchase again."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, hops cut it a bit, long, lingering bitterness. Fantastic drinkability, alcohol just disappears. Big, brash hop presence is just a bit dominant, but overall, a hard one not to like. Doesn't have the smooth, rich body I'd look for, but this one is aggressive and brash."
"D-Very good beer. Has a stong boozy taste but the other flavors come through so it balences quite nicely. Would get this again"
"Just delicious!"
"Has a medium mouthfeel and a nice drinkibility. This is a nice stout that I would recommend."
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable. I wish I had tried this earlier in the winter. The wonderful smell with the beautiful presentation, not to mention the price makes this beer a winner. To be honest, I think this stout is definitely an improvement over an espresso with bourbon poured in it."
"D- This beer must be enjoyed slowly and consciously in order to get the full experience. Maybe one or two on a lazy cold night . Wonderful experience !"
"D: Fantastic beer. Not surprised in it's level of appreciation on this site. Fantastic."
"Pours pitch black, small lacing. Smell is minimal, a little smoky. Taste is syrupy, malty, smoky, a little chocolate. Feels very heavy, and heavy on the alcohol making it not very drinkable. This is one of those beers you can only have a few of. Overall a good IPA, a little overrated IMO."
"D - Solid stout. Stays true to the style. As drinkable as it gets for 9% abv."
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, fairly creamy and a bit dry on the palate. Nice, pleasant drinking, the alcohol is warm but not over the top. I definitely prefer this beer with some age on it, but fresh is still pretty tasty as well."
"Drink and overall: Wonderful RIS. Highly recommend to others. Especially for the price. The 9% ABV doesn't show itself, rather plays a little hide and seek."
"D: A well balanced RIS and goes down easy. A welcomed slight alcohol warmth. Great cold weather stout."
"Verdict: I enjoyed this. It was very complex and flavorful. It's worth getting. Here's to the next 100. A (4.35)"
"A good, but not grrreat! winter beer, and a pleasant way to finish off a we-got-a-babysitter-and-went-to-see-""The King's Speech"" date with my wife. Dark as a moonless night, and a decent aroma of coffee (albeit somewhat old coffee) and chocolate with a peculiar scent of lavender, which seems totally out of place but added a nice tilt to the beer. The bitterness is, relatively speaking, rather low but still elbows the malt and chocolate to the side. And then there's the ginormous head that never really goes away and is so puffy and thick that it made me want to lay my head into it and take a nap. With a dry finish and a come-from-behind alcohol smack, this is a good winter beer but somehow comes up short-- it lacks the complexity I prefer at this ABV. Good for the price."
"D: I don't crave another one, which given the alcohol is not that bad a thing, but this doesn't make my best of style...."
"D: As far as the style...very good. A great sipper."
"Overall: A fantastic representation of a Russian Imperial Stout by the people at North Coast. This beer delivers a knock out punch to the taste buds and sits a bit heavy on the stomach and induces what can best be described as a beer coma."
"Overall - A great beer, highly recommend it."
"Each sip is extremely creamy; the body explodes and releases in the mouth. Initially, the flavors are those of sweet but dark coffee malts and raisins. Later, the body settles and shows its massive roasted malt content with some buttering hops along for the ride. Around this time you notice that the beer packs quite an alcoholic punch, but definitely takes a back seat to the grain content. This dark, malty rush gives way to the yeast-laden dark chocolate from the aroma which lingers before the bitterness of the roasted malts returns to the tongue. Fortunately, sweet mocha accompanies the finish, making this an intense but drinkable beer. Of course, if you are new to stouts, you might want to try something less devious instead."
"D: This is an excellent RIS that I would certainly give as a starter into the RIS style. Well done North Coast to produce this beer so well year after year."
"Thin for it's flavor. Creamy with a bit of bite in the carbonation."
"D: As any Russian Imperial Stout, one or two bottles may be enough. Delightful and enjoyable to the palate."
"D- I like this not my normal go to beer I can see this being a great beer in my rotation."
"A very well-crafted stout. I had an Imperial Stout before and was not impressed but this brew definitely redeemed the style in my books. I wish I had some of this during the blizzard we had recently here in Chicago because this feels like a great beer to have in the cold. Highly recommended!"
"Total = 4.33"
"Very dry RIS and hoppy. Different from the numbers of cloying sweet stouts, a nice change. Can't wait to see what age does to this."
"glassware: imperial pint"
"D- Love the fact that you can get this beer anywhere, and at an affordable price. I'm a little wimpy when it comes to heavy roasted malts, this is on the border but was very easy drinking for me."
"Probably one of the best RIS I've had, great complex flavor, lots to taste with every sip. I will definitely look for this again."
"Old Rasputin is one of my favorite beers. It pours a dark black with a one finger tan head that settles into a ring of lace. Aromas of chocolate, coffee malt a slight hint of licorice, and a little bit of fruitiness. This beer is a full frontal assault on the taste buds and successfully accomplishes the mission. The taste is full of roasted malt, a bit of mocha sweetness with a slight amount of hop bitterness at the end. Full bodied flavor with medium carbonation. Watch out the 9% abv will sneak up and hit you in the ass! This beer is not for everyone. It has very strong and bold flavors. If you are a stout fan, I have yet to find a better example of a beer in this class and this is a MUST try."
"D- oh yea. as long as i dont comatose from the ABV i can drink this all night"
"D- Usually stouts are filling after 1 or 2, but I had 3 and could have enjoyed more if I had more time."
"There was a creamy and highly carbonated feel in the mouth after taking a swig of this, with a dry finish. This was a solid and highly drinkable RIS."
"D: Oh why is this my last one??!! This needs to be in the fridge at all times!!"
"This is an excellent example of a well crafted Russian imperial. Extremely tasty and complex. Hoppier than most others I have tried."
"D- a pretty good RIS, and it's availability make it nice also. I enjoy drinking this, and I'm sure I'll be into more of it before I leave this wretched island in this awful backward state that I'm currently stuck in (big island of hawaii if you were wondering)"
"Poured into a tulip glass, the color is a dark black body with a tan brown head, great lacing. It has a great roasted malt & earthy aroma. The taste is a pretty strong coffee & roasted malt blend. But what really makes this a refined beer is that this RIS has only a hint of alcohol in the smell. A full-bodied, smooth imperial stout. Definitely another classic, I simply love this beer."
"A beautiful rendition of an Imperial Stout. Much appreciated for the winter time. This has been a exceptionally cold one."
"Drinkability for an imperial stout is pretty good, I'll be getting this again."
"D: I love my share of RIS, and this one does not disappoint. Lower end of the abv spectrum in terms of the style, plus it tastes great"
"A nice texture and a refreshingly and surprisingly light RIS."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black but with a ruby tint. Massive, foamy brown head that leaves lots of sticky lacing on the glass. A very elegant yet supple-looking beer. Aroma is rich with roasted malts, dark fruits and chocolate. Taste is similar, but also with a slight burnt or smoky taste to it, but not too bitter. Good balance of hops and malt, has a nice sweetness that isn't overpowering. Has an average level of carbonation and healthy medium-thick mouthfeel. The 9% abv is more noticeable to me as the beer warms, leaving a lingering alcohol warmth in the aftertaste. Still despite being a sipping beer for me, I think other BA's could go through two or three with no problem, it's a delicious beer that would go well with a dessert or hearty meat dish. This is better than Storm King, IMO because it isn't too bitter or burnt-tasting, focusing on rich malt flavor. I would like to try this again, perhaps with a fresher bottle or on-tap. Highly recommended!"
"D: While still a great beer, the beginning of the glass is more enjoyable than the end as sweetness begins to overpower the palate, making me interested in changing things up when this glass is done. Nonetheless, a beer to return to again and again."
"Enjoyed this on tap at the Black Dog in Urbana, IL, which is highly recommended: see my Beerfly review."
"CHEERS!!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy like a milkshake, and never gets too sticky or anything like that. Drinkability is phenomenal for being 9% abv, as the alcohol is only slightly evident as part of that coffee kick at the end. This measures up to just about any other stout out there."
"D - There's so much going on with each sip that it hides the alcohol very well, and makes it such a drinkable beer. The chocolate makes it such a sweet beer, like a dessert. And the creamy mouthfeel makes it even more inviting. I bet this beer wouldn't be bad on nitro."
"Old Rasputin should, as probably does, serve as a benchmark for all RIS on the market. It is one of the most drinkable stouts I have enjoyed and has all of the positive markers we beer enthusiasts enjoy. It pours dark, with a head to match. The aroma is of dark roast coffee, chocolate, hint of anise, smoke. It is smooth and rich in the mouth. The taste is sublime, without being overwhelming, and although it's a stout, care was taken to preserve a hop finish. I know most Americans enjoy their beer cold, but PLEASE, drink Old Rasputin as close to room temperature as you can tolerate. It's the only way to experience all of the complexity this beer truely has to offer."
"If you appreciate complex stouts that still retain some semblance of a beer and are not so thick, winey, and boozy as some, you'll keep a share of this on hand year round just like I do. Props to NC for a great and enjoyable potable. Great work!"
"For BA readers, be warned. There are stronger brews out there. But none that hide the alcohol behind so much flavor. To those who enjoy a very stout stout..this is one of my favorites."
"I don't think I could drink more then 2 of these on a very ambitious night. But definitely a good tasting beer."
"D: I have always loved the Old Rasputin, but the nitro offering is a great improvement. The bottled version is slightly hoppier than it should be, and the nitro both mutes this, and enhances the mouthfeel. Overall, this is a must have if you ever see it at your local pub."
"9% ABV makes it even better, nicely masked and fun to drink."
"D= This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. The higher carbonation keeps it refreshing and the 9%ABV is well masked, making this a dangerous stout that went down remarkably fast. Now if I only had a platter of raw oysters..."
"Fairly easy drinking for a RIS, but at 9% ABV, one should use caution."
"D - For the style this is pretty drinkable. Compared to most other styles, though, this is a doozie."
"This is a fantastic powerful RIS. Nice big flavours, perfect for sipping on cold winter nights. The hops play a prominent role and mesh nicely with the malt profile to create many layers of complexity. It's going to be hard to age the rest of these for very long!"
"Final thought - I love this beer. Can't say anything bad about it"
"D-Alcohol is masked well, makes for easy drinking."
"Incredibly smooth and delicious. The alcohol content gives the beer a faintly hot finish but it does not take away from the beer in any imaginable way. Carbonation is very low and this one is viscous on the tongue. This one is about a year old so the hops have faded quite a bit which I find is quite beneficial to this beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer for stout lovers. If you love chocolate and you are a stout fan than this is a must for you. One of the Allstrom brothers also said barley wine drinkers would like this, but can't make my own opinion on that since I only tasted one barley wine."
"D- If I didn't want to age the others longer, I'd keep 'em coming!!!"
"Drinkability: very good, but drinking more than one or two could be quite the task due to how big this stout is and the fact that the bitter finish wrecks your pallette."
"Old Rasputin pours black with some dark brown visible around the edges of my chalice and a quarter-inch tan head that quickly breaks up. This looks very developed with strong retention. There are roasty and sweet smells of coffee and chocolate. I'm impressed by the extremely well-balanced and complex taste due to the kick of the hops blending in so nicely with the roasty profile. Medium carbonation and an easy sipper for 9% abv. so look out. This is no joke of a Russian Imperial Stout and it is the perfect winter night brew."
" Creamy and tight carbonation make every sip a pleasure, what a nice stout."
"I poured this one a little on the cold side so as it warmed up, the flavors intensified. Deeply satisfying brew."
"D- Fairly drinkable considering the bitterness. Leaves a really solid aftertaste as well. Possibly a bit too full to be entirely drinkable, but at the same time it's one of the best things it has going for it. More of a sipper. Has some residual alcohol heat."
"Old Rasputin is definitely one of the top Imperial Stouts. Well crafted, tasty, highly recommended!"
"(D)- Dangerously drinkable for the style in this form. I could have had this all day during the game. Rich and malty with a creamy smooth center. I love this beer out of the bottle, but Nitro tap might be even better."
"It is sub-freezing in Wilmington, our room is like a meat locker, I half-expect to see a side of beef in the wardrobe, but this remarkable brew is cosseting in its warmth. I'd very much like another. My glass cries out for renewal, but the cupboard is bare, the bottle empty, Old Rasputin vanquished, no more. A pity. But the delight lingers, as will the memory. And thanks to the wonderful North Coast Brewing Company, a memory that may be renewed."
"what a great stout. ive been wanting to review ole raspy for some time. poured into a brooklyn pint. served at somewhere around 50-55 degrees. the body is black as jet. held to light not much shines through; i tried. somewhat bourbony, ruby edges. really appealing and one of the better looking imperial stouts out there. nice coffee tan head. smells are aggressive. sweet and smokey, with a roasted coffee aroma; also some burnt toffee and caramel. hops are definitely in the mix as well. the taste is outstanding for the style. its hoppy, but it plays nicely with a heavy dose of roasty caramel malts. nice bitterness on different planes. very rich. the sweetness is there but certainly termpered; im getting some raisin and caramel. the finish is bittersweet and has a lingering alcohol burning warmth with some reassuring hop accompaniment. does taste more aggressive up front than on the back end, where it tames out, as if the word tame could accurately apply here. mouthfeel on this one is dynamite. perfectly carbonated, delicately smooth yet still sharp as a tack. the drinkability scores quite high, for the style of course its wonderful, and at 9% abv its not that tasking."
"SABOR:Es muy marcado el sabor a caramelo y chocolate, el LARGO se persive una sensación muy peculiar a caffe la cual también es muy típico del estilo Stout, la malta tostado chocolate le da un sabor muy agradable y el Lupulo y la fermentación un excelente amargor y cuerpo"
"D - very drinkable and cheap, like milk! Really!"
"This is really a gem of a beer, perfect for wintertime sipping. Frighteningly I can and will session this beer. Now all I need is a fireplace."
"Poured pitch black, no light could penetrate this. Moderately brown head, with a couple fingers of head leaving behind some reasonable retention and some nice lacing. Aroma is complex, all kinds of chocolate, rich dark fruits, some vanilla sweetness and a slight suggestion of the alcohol. Taste has less chocolate in the nose and a more prominent coffee flavour. Some bitterness as a result of this, with more rich dark fruits in the finish. Great interplay between the bitterness and sweetness. Great mouthfeel and no sense of the alcohol, rapid drinkability allowing me to yearn for more bottles of this!"
"D- Quite. Makes me want to stroke my beard."
"This is a great beer. Great after a nice meal. Really awesome flavor and feel. Truly a wonderful brew"
"It's good from the bottle too."
"D-A great sipper but also just smooth enough to overdue it."
"FourthBeer potential: AVERAGE, as there are plenty of more complex stouts out there. As the bottle says, though, Сердечный друг не родится вдруг, implying this has potential to grow on you."
"Pours a nice thick two finger head that daes into thick webbed lacing that adornes the snifter. A sexy beer, definitly one of the best ive seen. The beers color is pitch black, their is no tints of red or light that comes through. The nose is of dark chocolate, some vanilla, hops, and ample malt sweetness. The taste is about the same as the smell with a very creamy mouthfeel. One of the best bangs for your buck."
"What a fantastic beer; absolutely LOVE the mixture of roasty malts and drying hops; great stuff."
"Nice opaque pour, big blooming tan head, creamy medium body, lots of coffee, chocolate, dried figs, and a ton of roast. Super long, dry, roasty finish, and a big hit of acidity ala Guinness Foreign Extra Stout.. Terrific stuff that is thankfully available all year long!"
"It is totally drinkable, my co-workers really enjoyed this one, it is just not the one for me"
"I am really regretting that I had not tried this beer for so long. It has a lot to offer and is a great example of the style. I especially appreciate that it is hoppy, but not overly so like say a fresh Storm King. This really allows the roasted malt to show through while still giving it that little something extra. This is definitely recommended and is a great winter brew."
"D: Very. I recommend it."
"Extremely drinkable - I recommend drinking it slowly as to enjoy all of it's complex flavors."
"Very thick mouthfeel that lingers on the palate. This beer has 8.9% alcohol, but it is not apparent in the taste because it is so smooth. The alcohol is only slightly noticeable in the aftertaste."
"One final note, I love it when big beers come in 12oz bottles instead of exclusively coming in bombers. It makes it much easiest to enjoy a beer when I at home without my beer drinking buddies. Plus it almost always a better value. I'll be buying this beer again."
"d- extremely drinkable. quite dry and no cloying sweetness whatsoever."
"d 4.5 a classic. and a good base for the addition of other flavors if desired."
"Drink- 9% isn't noticable at all. A great way to end the day and such a value for a beer as well. Good things come in small packages. What a great 12oz bottle."
"The CPJ"
"Pours an excellent deep black with wonderful tan head and very nice lacing. Excellent deep malty scent with wonderfully huge roasted grain aromas and a slight hint of chocolate. Excellent taste, with a huge malt kick, wonderful roasted grains, a small chocolate hit at the end, and a nice hit of hops that comes through just a bit at the end as well; no alcohol tinge, either, which was a huge bonus. Went down entirely too smooth for such a high ABV brew."
"Bottle poured into dimple glass. Pours a pitch black viscous with a thick chocolate head. Quite a bit of lacing. Aroma is of roast chocolate, coffee, licorice, dark fruits, and quite phenolic. Flavor is sweet chocolate, roast coffee, caramel, and phenols. Palate is full bodied viscous; extremely smooth. Finish is bittersweet chocolate and a little too phenolic. I can't say it's my favorite RIS."
"... and I don't even like Russian Imperial Stout. This one will spoil you for all others."
"D- A couple of these no problem. Would love it on Nitro tap i would assume."
"O: In my humble and unimportant opinion, Old Rasputin in the perfect interpretation of a Russian Imperial Stout. It takes the already awesome style and throws aggressive hopping into the mix. It's in your face with flavors from start to finish. A perfect way to end a night OR start a day."
"Mouthfeel is full but not heavy or cloying. The drinkability is perfect. Amazing in every way. Stupendous."
"Ultimately, a favorite but not a regular. I would say, better suited for the winter months."
"Drinkability: Awsome beer! Very complex, rich and robust."
"I was expecting more from this beer -- the writeup at the store claimed very high marks from BA. I found it to be bitter and somewhat harsh. There is a bit of sweetness, but it's overshadowed by other, more powerful taste sensations. On a positive note, it pours with a very nice head ... disappearing after a minute or so as expected."
"On a side note, I am glad that this one has held up against my palate as I've grown over the past two years as a craft beer drinker. Cheers!"
"mouthfeel is spot on and can't be separated from the tasting experience. 9%abv? can't tell. therefore quite drinkable and a session brew for anarchists and scalawags and aficionados of intrigue. tarot. duels. subterfuge..."
"This might be one of my favorite beers. Period."
"Then again, I did sorta just blow through this glass right now. Hmm. Something has to do with the way he's holding his hand on his forehead."
"I just tried this for the first time last night and was satisifed...for the most part...Into a goblet glass, it revealed a solid black color under a dark beige creamy head. It carried a sweet nose of dark roasted malt with a strong note of cocoa and faint hint of dark berry fruit. A crisp and bright upfront feel leads to a dark roasted earthy cocoa dominated center into a slowly resonating echo of an espresso bean finish. There are finishing notes of earthy dark fruit, perhaps fig, and dark chocolate. An overall good beer in my book. I'd be interested though to experience this with perhaps a less carbonated feel and was hoping for the creamier feel I'd tried in previous I.R.S."
"This beer pours a black color with a 2 finger tan thick and sticky head. The aroma contains some burnt malt characteristics with a flowery hoppy smell as well. The aromas with burnt malty characteristics including coffee and chocolate and then moves to a hoppy bitterness which is stronger than I expected. The mouthfeel leaves a little harshness on the top of your mouth, but nothing bad. Overall a great beer!"
"I've had it on tap and from a 12oz bottle. I always prefer the bottle."
"The first time I had this beer I was just getting into craft brews and I drain poured this one. Now that I am a little more versed in beer I can appreciate it a lot better."
"FANTASTIC BREW OF THIS STYLE!!!"
"Taste is smooth and full and sweet. Very very chocolatey.  This is a really well balanced RIS. Sweet as hell, yet a lot of good bitterness from the hops and they work really well together. Aftertaste has very strong coffee notes that didn't come out in the beginning, not until it warmed down a little bit did it make itself know."
"D - Very drinkable. The alcohol is misleading because I could not taste it at all."
"A wonderfully well-balanced beer, full of flavor, roasted malts with a slight smokey sweet taste. For a modernized Imperial Stout it is the perfect example. North Coast Brewing has done a wonderful job on this style of brew and is one of many perfect reflections of an old world taste able to be shared with the modern world."
"Overall - This is a great strong, manly, beer to store away in your cellar and pull a few out some day when a good friend or family member is over to share."
"D- After several sessions of these I now understand what all the hype was about. For a 9% beer I am torn bewtween worried or delighted at how easily this beer goes down."
"Overall a really nice beer. Could've used some tweaks here or there. Really just ended up being a really alcoholic robust porter to me. Nothing that would identify it as a RIS. Still makes for a great beer to drink."
"out of a nitro tap flavors are kind of mellowed out of the bottle they are much bolder which is awesome"
"As if it had not been established that this is a really good beer! Really tasty and smooth (especially with the year+ on it), pretty complex, and a great value."
"Drinkability- This is a solid brew, but its definitly a sipper. Hopefully the alcohol bit will go away with some time in the cellar."
"The mouthfeel is fairly thick and lightly carbonated, it feels good going down. The drinkability is also quite high, especially for the ABV. I think this was a great choice for my first RIS. This is a great, drinkable beer that should appeal to just about anyone."
"D/M: smooth across the pallet, incredibly complex, little carbonation tingle, drinks beatufully and with the perfect level of heaviness"
"All in all a very good beer."
"Pours a dark black with huge tan foamy head. Wonderful lacing all the way down. Nose is very inviting, theres the roasted maltsand a hint of piney hops. Strong and bold malt taste upfront. Some coffee and dark chocolate flavours and a bitter/dry warming finish. Finally a stout with the body it should have! Doesnt feel watery, heavy and chewy mouthfeel: excellent. This is one great stout. I'll definately be on the lookout for more next time."
"Drinkability -- Having this on nitro-tap deserves a second review. Beyond the smooth and creamy body, the chocolate notes are pushed far into the forefront. Great stuff. This beer makes me sad that Guinness and Murphy's are the only stouts that use nitro widgets. Just ain't fair, I tell you..."
"D -- Definitely worth a try, a well constructed brew."
"Old Rasputin is a bold, flavorful, heavy-handed, powerhouse cold day or late evening sipper. It leaves a very strong impression."
"overall, this is the beer that defines the style for me; truly excellent stuff!"
"Notes - A great beer to start the New Year."
"Drinkability: Pretty smooth and goes down easy for the alcohol content."
"D- A great beer. Very true to the style. I have heard mentions of Imperial Stouts being akin to Dark Barleywines, and I agree wholeheartedly. This beer just keeps on giving throughout the glass. The flavor lingers Forever, and the nose has something different to enjoy before every sip. This is a perfect beer for hanging around a cold home, or if you are looking to enjoy just one beer for the evening. Highly recommended!"
"D- Very nice RIS that is nice and balanced. Not very sweet and I enjoy it a lot."
"D - Still very high. Even with the carb issues this is still one of my go to stouts. I was more disappointed in the pour than I was in the beer. I will have to re-review this one at a later time..."
"This is one of the most balanced and complex RIS I've ever had. There is a very strong hop presence along with strong coffee flavors. Overall, an outstanding beer."
"If you love dark, well balanced stouts, you will no doubt enjoy this. This is a classic that can be aged in your cellar or drank fresh."
"A very complex and enjoyable beer. This beer would be great with a chocolate cheesecake, or by its self on a cold winter night."
"Drinkability certainly is not restricted by its alcohol content. It's well mellowed and is unobtrusive in everything but the very finish where it warns you of what's to come if you have too much."
"Drinkability is high for a RIS. I could of had two."
"D: although it feels dry beer, it's also quite bitter. It is a good sipping beer."
"Drinkability: An awesome beer that's wonderful to enjoy on a cold winter night."
"This is a pretty drinkable RIS. It is not overkill to purchase and consume this by the four pack. A bottle or two would be great to accompany a meal (or dessert) or on its own. The fact that this beer is readily available year-round makes it a good go to RIS."
"d. its not just drinkable. its a must drink for me. this beer reminds me how good beer can taste, and continues to impress me as vividly as the first time i had it... blew my limited beer mind then, and still shines now."
"Awesome!"
"I poured a bottle into the snifter the head was VERY impressive and slowly goes down. The color is pitch black and i love black beers, took a wiff and it was very hoppy i gota grassy hop smell from it. the taste this time around was not over whelming at all it was very well balanced to me. Its not thick either nice an light with a high abv deffinately an all time fav in the winter"
"The head is chewy and endless. The taste is one you can drink more than one of. That says a lot for this style. Highly recommended."
"All in all, this is a great brew. I liked Old Raspty XII, but I think I like this one better! The taste is not as solid as the other categories, but not bad by any means. Definitely try if you like the style."
"D: The beer is delicious and the alcohol's presence is barely noticable, making this an incredibly drinkable RIS."
"Truly fantastic beer. Fully deserving of any accolades it receives."
"D - this is my recommendation for anyone wanting to try their first RIS. It isn't easy to rate a mouthfeel on a stout after you have had perfection from Founders Breakfast Stout but the ""Mad Monk"" does everything well. For the price, drinkability, and aroma; this beer deserves it's rating."
"D - Really good brew, the alcohol really creeps up on you though. Which isn't a bad thing. I would probably stop at two or three of these before quitting."
"This is a great imperial stout available at a great price. Imperial stouts are not my go to style but I enjoyed this regardless. I'd also be interested in trying this with a bit of age on it to see the boozy flavors mellowed out."
"D: amazing sipper! The booze will warm you with ease and the flavors will warm your soul."
"This beer feels like a dark chocolate smoothie that hides the 9% abv very well. I drank it up before finishing this review and definitely would get it again. Super stoutilicious and great for the cold winter months. Try the beer once, you will be sold on it as well as stouts in general. All other beers in its class will have to work that much harder to make an impression."
"time treated this well, this is really delicious. really no trace of the alcohol what so ever. i plan on aging some more of these."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its robust attitude. The aroma was dark and foreboding, but also inviting with its sweetness of hops. The taste is very much the same way, but is nicely balanced and complex. This is a delicious brew and, if you only have one or two of them, it becomes difficult to kill."
"I had the joy of having two of these at a nice restaurant with a good team of co-workers. Poured dark as coffee. Only 1/8"" of head but that head seemed immortal. Smell and taste are packed with chocolate and dark roasted malts. Just a delightful example of Russian Imperial Stout. Even one of the non-beer drinkers at the table begrudgingly tried it and agreed they really liked it."
"It is definitely a sipper and a must-have for any stout lover. Very highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Aside from how awesome it is to drink a beer whose namesake may or may not have brought down the Romanov dynasty, this is just a damn good beer. Very drinkable, even at 9%."
"Drink - This is a flavour packed full bodied beer that is a must try. It's extremely drinkable and perfect during the winter/colder months."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer. It is very complex, flavorful, and warming. Drink six of these and I will guarantee you will wake up with a headache (at least I will)."
"I recommend Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout. I may even try brewing a batch myself. :)"
"O: Not a bad RIS, certainly a great value, but a bit too bitter for my taste with too much leafy hop presence. A couple years on this could really do wonders."
"The drinkability of this bottle is tough to rate for me because I know I've had Rasputin before when it has been much less bitter and more drinkable. I think I need to start a campaign for all breweries to label when the beer was bottled. I have had too many disappointing bottles of beer because there is no bottling date on the label. For me, this was too roasty and hoppy, but I have had Rasputin when it is not that way. What's a beer drinker to do?"
"D - I expected a moderatley slow drink, but surprisingly the 9.0 ABV doesn't stand out. I find myself sadened that in the time it took to write the review I seem to have finished the beer. This 4-pack could go very quickly indeed."
"d: Bitter coffee aftertaste leaves you wanting another drink. Its warm and enticing flavor and feel are perfect for a cold winter night. A very hardy beer of sustenance."
"Drinkability is off the charts for something resting around 9% abv. This thing could easily pass for a porter in the 6% range. That is, until you've had a few..."
"This brew is a pretty good drink, especially for the ABV. Its not overly think, but creamy and goes down super easy. Its not a chugger by any means, but a great brew to take a gulps of. An amazing stout."
"Had a bottle at Downtown Bar & Grill Brooklyn for the first time in a while and just had to pick up a four pack today. One of my all time favorites. Would give 5's across the board but only the beer gods can create a perfect beer! Well done."
"D - Very good drinkability for the ABV. Not too thick, not too hot to take larger gulps, though not a beer I would want to go through too quickly. Fantastic overall beer, one of my favorite stouts."
"Notes: Excellent. This was one of my first favorites, and that still holds true. This beer has been around for a long time, and it still holds up to the competition."
"D: Very drinkable"
"D: Great RIS that has wonderful flavor, and a great aroma profile. This one is a must have if you have not had it before."
"Well they finally made a beer as black as the devil's soul and it's quite simply tops. It's 6 degrees outside tonight and the floor of my basement keeps Old Rasputin at the perfect drinking temperature. You can usually find a few of these in my fridge even in the summer, really wonderful. I love Samuel Smith's RIS and other examples of the style, but Old Rasp is the one I always seem to grab off the shelf."
"D: This is a solid RIS that retails at a better price than most, and it pairs very well with chocolate."
"As far as stouts go, this is pretty good. Hopped up but not too much for my taste. Hops are mild and spicy, but not overpowering. As for the malt, it has notes of anise, espresso, and mollases. Very well balanced as far as stouts go. Very drinkable, even if it's not my favorite."
"Easy to drink and very enjoyable. Definitely recommended."
"D - Bold, assertive RIS that's well balanced and drinks nicely. Especially good considering the price and availability."
"Old rasputin...a legendary beer, and not without good cause. Beer poured to one of the most wonderfully plump heads i've seen in a good while. A staple RIS, with history to boot. Hints of cocoa, smooth, with a somewhat bitter afterbite. Strongly recommend this strong stout to anyone that is lucky enough to find it!"
"this is a deliciously rich, drinkable beer"
"Holding that crazy punchy bitterness helped to give the beer a medium to full body mouthfeel and it felt like a heavy cream on my tongue. Even with a hopped up spicy carbonation, it managed to stay smooth throughout the drink and made plenty of room for a very dry finish. There was a lasting aftertaste, but it was a warm aftertaste filled by a 9%ABV. Quite a hearty beer and thus not for the faint of heart."
"For a brew of such high alcohol and so much flavor, this drinks surprisingly well. Obviously you couldn't session this without getting seriously crunk. It's drinkable enough that you could put one of these away dangerously fast, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice. This is a stout to be sipped and savored. Drinkability points are docked for the very noticeable high ABV but that is splitting hairs. I'd drink these all night if I were Superman."
"Overall this is a bold but enjoyable Russian Imperial. The ABV is present, but does not ruin the experience...though I wouldn't have more than two at a time (probably a great desert beer)."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper, but I know I'll be having more than one tonight."
"Too bad they named this great stout after an infamous fellow like Rasputin. They even put his ugly mug on the label."
"Pours dark mahogany almost black with a small brown head. Aroma of dark malts, cacao, caramel, burnt espresso. Taste is similar to aroma. Palate si full bodied with good carbonation, creamy and thick. Finish is dark malts, chocolate, caramel with just enough bitter hops to add balanace. Flavors become more pronounced as it warms up. Very rich and creamy. Very well done IS."
"Drinkability: While I really love this beer, I'am not likely to drink more than one of these. This is like dessert not only because of the sweet taste but because you are so full by time you finish the first one. A very filling beer!"
"A classic widely available RIS, a must try!"
"drinkability: Excellent beer to drink. Can't drink more then maybe 2 or you wont be able to drive home."
"From a bottle into a tulip glass. Essentially black. Tall, fluffy tan head, fades to a thin layer on the top of the beer. Slight metallic aroma. Coffee roast aroma, some low chocolate notes. Hop aroma is hidden by the roast malt. Incredible flavor. Complex mix of roast coffee, chocolate, and burnt malt. Slightly sweet up front, with a long, slow, build of hop bitterness. Low alcohol flavor belies the strength. Medium body makes this beer dangerously drinkable. One of my favorite ""go to"" high ABV beers."
"Pours a deep pitch black color with a mocha colored head and tons of residual lacing. Smells of malts, dark fruits, and roasted goodness. Tastes much the same with prunes, plums, roasted malts, a little smokiness, strong hops and some hints of coffee. Mouthfeel is very nice and drinkability is high."
"Cheers!"
"D - Normally with stronger brews like this, one would be enough for me. This, however, I could drink all night. The ABV is nicely hidden, it's full of flavour and nicely balanced between the chocolate and coffee malts. Very delicious, and I can understand why this one is so well rated."
"D- As others have said, this is not a session brew simply because of the alcohol content. The four pack it comes in is sufficient for 2 people to enjoy without losing sight of the high points of the beer. If I ever see this on tap, rest assured I will be buying a round for anyone with me."
"A lot of residual flavor, settles on the tongue, and after a few minuties, you feel prepared for another go. Alcohol is nonexistent throughout. Outstanding. Though, at 9% ABV I would leave this as a finisher, and not an all night affair."
"Slainte!"
"Besides the hidden 9% ABV, this one is SO drinkable. I can't even call this a sipper, it's so hard to not drink a lot."
"Poured from a bottle, out of a 4-pack. The stout produces a significant 1/4-1/2"" head, thin but prominent. Very opaque and dark beer to go along with creamy-tan head. Initial smell yields aromas of oak/nutty undertones, with a kind of musty coffee and chocolate theme. There was minimal forward taste, and the beer has a quick, sharp aftertaste. There is a smooth coffee flavor, that has a balanced bitterness throughout the beer, but the flavor is short-lived. It truly seems to skip from the initial flavor straight to aftertaste. It does leave a strong, thick residue on the glass, which goes well with the strength of a stout. Overall, a very drinkable beer."
"D - bitterness aside this is s great beer. Would go fantastically with a meaty stew or a turkey dinner. A hearty English style beer of this magnitude really needs some hearty pub food to go with it. Potatoes, sausage, tons of gravy."
"D- With a high ABV this is definitely not a session beer, but overall it makes for a beer that everyone should try at least once."
"Old Rasputin will make a man out of you (Rip Van Winkle, for one). Always pours with an explosive, swelling head, big and busty, and the perfect shade of ash and gravel. Scummy, sparkling lacing. The liquid is impenetrably black - a charred void. Black death. The aroma hits you instantaneously, even from a foot or more away. More of a Baltic Porter scent than a bitter, dry stout. What I get is dark chocolate cake dipped in dark chocolate, mellow espresso, grain just lightly singed, and wafting among these scents, a faint grassy/piney hop presence. Oh, and a clean, vodka-like alcohol aroma, more and more as it warms. Flavor-wise, I'm not sure what you can improve upon, considering the style and imagery conjured up by the namesake of the beer. Cold and black. A sultry bitterness - by way of hops, dark chocolate, and dark malt. Velvety smooth feel and vague molasses character, with surprisingly potent fruitiness and almost citrus hop flavors as it warms. While this doesn't need to warm up much to express its fabulous complexities, the alcohol makes itself quite apparent in the aftertaste and feel past a certain degree. Once in awhile, this can be somewhat off-putting. For the most part, you really want this though. Carbonation, at its levels, is ideal and maintains excitement on the tongue - never any cloying sweetness or heavy feeling. That, and the warm prick of ethyl, round out an expertly crafted brew. So difficult to put this into perspective...when you've had 2 or 3."
"Poured a deep, dark brown, nearly black, with a little tan head. Aromas of bitter dark chocolate, roasted malt and coffee. On the palate, full bodied, with flavors of dark chocolate, espresso, earthy hops and roasted malt."
"This beer is very drinkable and affordable. It certainly gives you more bang for your buck the the Surly Darkness which I so desired... I would say that I have become part of the ""cult following"" :D"
"Drinkability- Well like I said 2 maybe 3 and that is about it. These are so good that it is a beer that I like to take my time and savor every drop. I can never walk away from this beer it has been one of my all time favorites for a very long time. I would love to get a couple of these wax the necks over and lay them down for a year maybe two and see how it matures. Bottom line it is amazing try it."
"12 oz bottle. Pours black with a thick, brown, long lasting head. Aroma is of coffee, chocolate, dry fruit, molasses, and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma. Full, creamy, thick body. Long, espresso coffee finish. This is a classic, delicious brew."
"very high. probably the standard in Imperial Stouts. Not many things bad with this beer. It's nothing I'd spend my life savings on, but I can see myself grabbing a 4pack of this once a month. The price and availability make it very high as well."
"Goes down pretty easy for the abv. I really like that this is a highly rated beer that seems to be highly available."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down very smooth, and it leaves you wanting more after every sip. I love this beer, it is absolutely a great RIS. It is very drinkable, even with the 9% ABV. I definitely recommend this one, it is one of my favorite beers for sure. Great job North Coast. Cheers."
"Deserving of the high praise. And a pretty good deal too."
"D- A good stout. High abv, well masked, many unigue flavors. I feel llke this was modeled off of coffee and they threw in some flavors your not used to for a stout. They work good, but theres nothing thats ground breaking with this. Recommended, but not world class."
"A classic example of the style. Well made. This is big and bold and complex, but balanced."
"An exceptional beer."
"Overall: An excellent beer. Tasty and sweet, with a huge coffee and chocolate presence. This is a timeless classic and being amazingly cheap and available, there is no reason not to drink this. Recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-heavy and a bit chewy. Overall, this stout is one of the best widely available stouts, and you don't have to wait in line at 3am just to give it a try. Great everyday drinker."
"If I had 3 wishes in my life, a life supply of this dark black gold and a key to the north coast brewery would be one of them!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: Have wanted to try this for a while. I'm not a stout guy, but I love sampling all kinds of styles. This is one tasty stout. I like it better than most others that I have tried."
"Thank you Cheers wine and spirits in Chanhassen, MN for FINALLY stocking this. I have found my favorite imperial and I will be buying much more in the future!"
"D - If I didn't know better I could drink this as one of the only beers in my arsenal, and a pretty darn good deal at that! Just too big to be drinking all the time, but worth drinking one a day (keeps the doctor away, look how much Old Raspy himself went through haha)."
"This is my favorite russian imperial stout. It tastes incredible and goes down easy (especially on nitro). A little too easy. This beer tends to put the demon in me and the spirit of old Grigori Rasputin comes out in full effect. Dire consequences rapidly ensue."
"D: A smooth drink for a higher ABV, the alcohol is noticeable, but it is not overpowering. A very good stout to say the least."
"Poured almost black into a pint glass with a thick creamy head, great retention and clings to the glass. Smelled of dry roasted malts, some hop bitterness, and coffee. Taste smokey, roasted malts, chocolate with dry finish and warm alcohol. Incredibly smooth, clings to the mouth. Deceptively easy to drink, and pairs well with desert. Excellent beer."
"This is surprising drinkable for being so high in alcohol and IBU. It has a nice taste and like I said, it's very manly, but everything balances niceless to create a pleasant drinking experience."
"Overall this is one of the best I have had it ranks top not sure if I Old Rasputin or BBCS better at this point"
"D- Very high drinkability here. Well balanced flavor and incredibly smooth. Could be a sipper, but it's hard to put the glass down. The price is nice too."
"I'm standing in front of a warm woodstove sipping this slowly, 3 ounces to go. Aroma of dried black cherry says 'hello' and the hotness of alcohol actually diminishes a little! Much less carbonation by now (which is fine!) and this beer gets a little bit sweeter and the roasted malts seem more developed in just one sitting. I only wish I had a second one to sip on."
"You can smell roasted malts and there is a lingering nutty coffee aroma that is pretty subtle, nothing special here, but still solid. Flavor wise, it has a roasted coffee taste with some hints of brown sugar. The aftertaste is bitter and nutty. Its very smooth and creamy, but also pretty filling. Just enough carbonation to balance the smoothness and alcoholic kick this beer packs."
"This is without a doubt, one of if not the best stout(s) I've ever had."
"This bottle served as a coda to our Hallowe'en mini-tasting. It pours a nice onyx topped by a finger of light tan/dark ecru foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted rye bread, pumpernickel, and a light flash of molasses. The taste is nearly identical, though heavier on the roasted malts. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat thick and chewy feel. Overall, a very nice bit o' stout, one that drinks way the hell too easily for its (and my) own good."
"On nitro at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a deep opaque black with a nice frothy khaki head that lasts and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is a bit of roasted malts, not much else. The taste is a nice amount of smooth roasted malts along with bitter cocoa, molasses and some mild espresso. The beer is medium bodied with smooth carbonation and just a bit of alcohol presence. This is a great nitro brew, one I wish was more readily available."
"Overall: Old Rasp is just perfect with a grilled medium/medium rare T-bone or ribeye - any red meat with nice marbeling. Save some to have with a chocolate dessert and you've got yourself a perfect evening."
"D- Definitely a sipping beer. A good stout. Big, filling and thick. A good beer for cold weather. Strong on the back of the tounge with alcohol. Definitely have to drink it slow."
"Overall drinkability is good. Even if you're not usually one for stouts, it's definitely worth a taste. Works well as a stand-alone or dessert beer when one has lots of time to digest and dissect the different flavors."
"D: Very drinkable, I'd definitely have another one after this, but unfortunately, this was the last one."
"O: For the ABV, it is not apparent. Very well balance. A GREAT BEER and representation of the style."
"D - Very drinkable, this is a perfect cold weather drink."
"D: Very drinkable, to the point of being deceptive. It smells like alcohol, but it doesn't taste like alcohol, which can lead to drinking it too fast."
"Drink ability: It sips nice and easy."
"Ah, Mother Russia..."
"Overall- this is a very solid imperial stout. With a great low price tag, this should be in constant rotation. This bumps up the drinkability for me as well."
"Actually had the barrel aged many times before I tried this one. Pours a black color with a generous caramel colored head. Has an aroma of dark fruit and coffee, with hints of caramel and citrus. Sweet citrusy start. Then bitter. Velvety, malty chocolate finish. Great thick, creamy mouthfeel. Very tasty. One of the best out there."
"Yum. Pours black with brown edges. Light tan head that sticks around the edges and leaves the slightest bit of lacing. The aroma is more vanilla, toffee, and chocolate than expected. The flavor is great rich chocolate and vanilla with a nice balance of bittering hops. Toffee and burnt caramel flavors in the middle and ends with bitterness from hops and roasted malts. Thick and luxourious over the tongue. Dry with just a touch of hotness from booze, without being boozy. Very sipable for an RIS."
"Drinkability: It would be hard to drink more than three of these in a sitting, but I certainly would try. This is such a good beer at a reasonable price"
"Pours a dark black with a smallish light brown head. Smells of very dark roasts, a little bit of coffee, spices and nuts. Taste is of chocolate, delicious dark burnt malts and a bit bitter in the aftertaste. The taste is not as complex as some other stouts I have had, but the simplicity works for it. Excellent carbonation and smooth drinkability."
"Overall, this is a perfect beer for those little reward yourself moments (weekends, good days at work, bad days at work, etc)."
"D: Great for 9%, I've had some RIS's that were way less drinkable at this ABV. Great as a night cap."
"Pours dark, deep brown, almost black with a thin sandlewood colored head. Has a very deep, sweet smell of burnt malted grains and molasses with a hint of grapes and spices. The mouth feel is quite sticky from the sugars and very warm. The taste follows the smell and very pleasant with sweet, sugary, burnt grains and caramel and surprising peppery, spicey aftertaste. This is a fantastic beer, but probably a little too heavy for an everyday beer."
"D - very easy drinking. Scary easy at 9%. No trace of alcohol. And it is balanced so well."
"Very very good. My favorite easy to find RIS."
"Old Rasputin is a classic RIS that I needed to have. The appearance is light absorbing black hole with a tan to slightly darker head. The smell is intoxicating with roasted yet smooth malt notes, and a hint of slight chocolate/ coffee notes. The taste is very clean the roasted malt flavor is subdued, allowing a creamy coffee flavor to dominate at the back of my tongue. I detect some bitter hop flavors framing the malt masterpiece of this North Coast Beer. The mouthfeel is pleasant and substantial. I would really love to find a case of this beer and drink a few every month to remember how a RIS should taste!"
"EDIT: Bumping up the taste and mouthfeel dimensions as this beer really comes into its own as it warms. Sweeter and richer. Nice!"
"Superb stout!"
"Dryness knocks the drinkability of this brew down a notch. Still pretty damn good."
"Overall/notes: I've heard a lot about this beer, and all positive. Doesn't really disappoint! I once had this... It was a long time ago, before I had any sort of experience with stouts, and ""good"" beer was a relatively new experience. Couldn't stand it. Couple of years later, and here I am, drinking it down and enjoying the evening. Experiences like these are great reminders of how far my palette has come!"
"A superb imperial stout."
"Pours jet black, medium viscosity with a nice tan 2 finger hard that recedes to leave a tinge of lacing. The aroma has rich roasted malts, a slight marshmallow scrent with vanilla and cocoa powder. Flavor has espresso, milk chocolate, a hint of vanilla and some malted candy type flavors. Nice mouthfeel with a good palate coating component but a tad too high on the carbonation for me. Overall this is a g"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- Slightly to bitter for my liking. The roasted malt and coffee bean is strong, however that is just a piece of this brews complexity which makes for a delightful challenge on the palate."
"D: This is great for a readily available inexpensive imperial stout, great to cellar or even drink a couple in a night."
"Pours thick black with a nice light brown head. good lacing. light only gets through around the edges. aroma salty espresso and toffee with a hint of alcohol. Flavor sweet salted toffee with a hint of bitter espresso and some acidity. Beautiful transition into a great finish. Bitter espresso dry slightly acidic and salty with just a hint of sweetness and just enough alcohol to add a nice warm touch. Full bodied. Carbonation seemed to be just a little too much when i first opened this one but after fifteen minutes or so it settles down to a nice creamy texture. One of the first imperial stouts i had and still one of the best. I forgot how good this beer is."
"D- Such a nice drinking stout. No overpowering flavors, just a classic RIS. The only drawback is the 9% will leave you forgetting how awesome this beer is."
"Pours a dark amber brew with a full rich and creamy brown crown. Roasted malts, coffe and dark/sweet cocoa beans with a well hidden alchol scent. Strong overpowering roated malts taste, with some hints of coffe, cocoa beans and alchol towards the end. Very pronounced malts and alchol. Strong tasting brew, kicking you off with coffe, roasted malts, the cocoa beans finishing off with a dry and bitter aftertaste. Good drinkability but due to the abv% it should't be taken lightly. Heavy rich beer that becomes heavier as it warms up. A heavy hitter which is beer haven for the strong brews lovers."
"All in all, a terrific RIS. I'd beat a small child to get this on tap."
"T - I had to let this one warm up because I served it too cold...I'm glad i did and after I found out how the flavors changed...I let it warm up more...I milked this one out and then I was sad when it was gone...a great imperial stout with deep, complex flavors...the alcohol is very well hidden"
"Overall, the hops kill too much of the other flavors going on in this beer. The other three beers in the four pack will be going down to the cellar for at least a year."
"The scent is of a distinctly toasted, malty quality. A yeastiness also meets the nose. The big scent is followed up by an even bigger flavor. Thick malts, yeast, burnt coffee and an exceptionally sticky mouthfeel combine to create a hearty drinking experience. A treat not to be taken lightly, and not likely to be consumed in very large quantities."
"I rate this one in my current top 10 beers! AMAZING!!! So good, I will not buy another bottle of Stone!"
"Poured into a Duvel tulip the head erupts to the top of the glass and ceases just before overflowing. Black body with a light coffee colored head. Smells of chocolate coffee and a nuttiness, very attractive nose. The taste brings more to the table with the aforementioned smells brought to the tongue with the addition of a prominent charcoal flavor which adds a nice character to the beer. More medium bodied, I'd like something slightly more viscous. Very good."
"A great stout. Smooth and not overbearing in the slightest."
"I'm relatively new to the world of beer, but I've been keeping a ranking list for each new beer I try. I would definitely put this beer in my top 10 beers, and absolutely above all American beers I've tried thus far."
"d- I would take on at least two. I say this because they are delicious and worth it, and with 9% alc your palate might be destroyed too much to fully move on to another good beer."
"This beer pours a thick black that absorbs all of the light around it. The head is a darker tan foam that is ""float a bottlecap firm"" (I tried it). It leaves gorgeous lacing as it goes down. The aroma is a bit weaker than I anticipated, but it was pleasant nonetheless. The aromas were the traditional cocoa nibs and coffee with a hint of sweet caramel and bourbon in the back. The taste was most definitely of the sweet caramel and a bit slighter on the bourbon flavor. The chocolate comes through on the aftertaste and the coffee is hiding in there somewhere amongst the roasted flavors. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth but there is the bit of bitterness that hides in the back. Aside from the bitterness this is super drinkable. It goes down really easily for 9%. It is a definite recommendation."
"this one is pretty drinkable. it tastes a little ""bigger"" than most stouts as you'd expect but this wouldn't detract me from having more than a few in a sitting."
" is certainly a great part of the rotation."
"A must."
"Well done North Coast. Keep the price right and I will make this one of my go to RIS's."
"Great taste, nice finish, and not terribly heavy, just make sure the alcohol content doesn't catch up with you."
"D: So easy to drink, you will find a 9% surprise if you are not careful!"
"D: As drinkable as many 5% regular stouts."
"There's a touch more alcohol in this than I'd like and I could go for a touch more body, but it's certainly not needed. The carbonation in this is great."
"Super dark brown color that stops light coming through fairly efficiently. The head is dark tan and about a finger tall. Smells really good. Lots of burnt, roasted malts. I get lots of bitter chocolate. It's kinda like chocolate espresso. There's also a touch of anise that shows itself again in the taste. Taste really resembles the aroma. Chocolate seems a bit sweeter on the tongue than in the nose. There's an additional hint of cherries in the flavor. A bit too much carbonation and I'd rather see it slightly thicker, but that's getting a little nitpicky."
"Never disappointing, amazingly priced, this is a beer I will continue to drink. Never say die!"
"I wasn't disappointed at all in my decision to b uy this."
"Glad I tried this beer - the 4-pack won't last long."
"With the light body and toned down bitterness this is one of the easiest drinking RIPs I've ever had, which is dangerous...check out that abv and you'll know why. You really don't sense much of the alcohol in this."
"D: it drank pretty decent and have not been let down everytime I have this beer. overall a good stout offering from the north coast."
"Drinkabily - Dangerously high. For as strong as it is, man i can suck down 3-4 of them if not careful. There are other stronger and more intense russian stouts but not many as tastly and drinkable. A classic, try it out"
"Paid $8.99 for a 4-pack. Great value."
"The taste is pretty darn good. Defiantly one of the better Imperial Stouts out there. Its complex, but not too much. Subtle hints in chocolate are there and then gone and it leaves you with a warn alcohol taste. You get a great carbonation that makes this beer very drinkable."
"Served from tap into a 4oz tumbler. Poured black with a minimal light tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt and coffee beans. The flavor was of coffee, cream, and roasted malt. It was heavy on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this is a very nice brew. Goes down nice and smooth. Actually leaves a nice feel on the palate as well upon swallowing. This is a definite must try if you have not done so already."
"smooth, velvety moutfeel; moderately carbed. decent drinkability, as far as russian imperial stouts go. you won't find a better beer for your money."
"D-abv hits quickly. taste stays pretty well but gets a little bitterness to it, i enjoyed this all the way through, but more than one would be difficult to drink at a time."
"Overall, this was an excellent stout. I would highly recommend this to any fans of stouts."
"This is the kind of beer that inspires men to great heights of cheesiness."
"Overall: A great sipping beer and example of the style."
"Verdict? Great stout, this had a lot of hype behind it and for the most part it lived up to all I counts and was a divergence from my expectations which made this a whole lot more interesting to drink. This is the kind of beer that will get you through those cold winter nights in the kremlin."
"D-high in alcohol flavor but you do get the other layers underneath after a few sips."
"D: I love this beer and could easily have another but the ABV commands respect and restraint. A really delicious brew."
"I could have a couple of these beers but no more since the flavors are so strong that the only thing keeping this beer from being absolutely perfect is the drinkability. Truly a phenomenal beer, especially on tap."
"If you see Old Ras on tap, get it. No ifs ands or buts."
"D: What can I say that I haven't already: Even after all these years, this one embodies the RIS style to me."
"Syrupy black pour with one finger of espresso crema-colored head. Nose is immediate chocolate with dark fruit behind it. The taste and mouthfeel are full and thick from front to back. Chocolate-covered dark cherries come to mind in the taste with a sustained yet subtle presence of alcohol throughout. This is truly fantastic and goes down a little too easy. I think I will have another..."
"Overall: An awesome beer."
"Hard one to grade down, this. Had it on nitro-tap at Meridian Pint in DC when I recognized that it was probably the best thing available, and man was I right. Huge, delicious, creamy beer. Monster thick creamy white head on top of a near-black brew. Beer is huge chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, raisins, and a hint of coffee. Had this beer many a time, but nitro-tap might be the best available option. Will definitely be grabbing it again."
"Easy to find, I wonder why it took me years to come back and give this beer another go. Certainly worth the praise..."
"D - very rich in classic stout flavours, the slight sweetness is a nice feature, and the 9% ABV is very well hidden, one of the better imperials I've tried"
"Overall- i'm officially naming this brew ol' raspy. i will be fo sho buying a 4 pack again. and come on... 8.99 a four pack of some solid imperial stout. this brew you should surely tip your hat to."
"I'm very impressed with this and North Coast in general."
"Overall a damn fine creation from the talented folks at North Coast. Have another? Well thanks for asking - I will."
"great stout"
"Bottom line; a great no frills imperial stout that is highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Good but not great. I love this beer but I wouldn't have lots of it. The nitro presentation is my favorite- much better than a bottle (which is a little harsh) and regular draft."
"The Old Rasputin would be an enjoyable introduction to RIS style for people looking to graduate from regular stouts. A good tasting beer with an enjoyable aroma and mouth feel."
"D - This is a beautiful example of the RIS style. Very drinkable and a brew for North Coast to be proud of."
"D-This is delicious in moderation, best paired with a dessert, one of the best versions of this style"
"D- Wow, just a great beer. The 9% ABV is completely hidden in the taste, making this very easy to drink. It has great complexity but is not to the point were have one is enough. I feel that I could easily drinking a whole four pack in a night if I wanted. I have been been just walking by it for the past 3 or 4 months saying that I will try it soon, I will not be walking by it again!"
"If one were to want to impress dinner guests with an above average brew, this would be it."
"The North Coast Old Rasputin pours a pitch black in the mug with a very thick (almost like a chocolate milkshake) froth that cascades for almost 2 minutes! Needless to say, the beer had amazing head retention & beautiful lacing. The nose is pronounced, yet subtle & inviting with aromas of chocolate, mocha, vanilla, caramel, espresso, molasses, mild hop resin, & a mild alcohol sent that follows through on the palate. The beer has a full, yet extremely creamy body, smooth hop bitterness (more like a drying sensation), and long finish. In the past, I have thoroughly enjoyed this beer & must admit that this is one of my favorite beers. However, the beer gets even better from the nitro tap! Highest Recommendation!"
"Pors a pitch black with small tan head. Aroma has STRONG chocolate scent with hints of black licorice and espresso. Maybe a bit of vanilla and some toasted malts. Not much hop profile. This smells amazing. I've had this beer on many occasions and always loved it. Taste is very robust with chocolate and toffee. A bit of sweet vanilla and I'm getting some oak-like flavors. A bit of coffee as well. Great flavors...so well balanced. The mouthfeel is bit more crisp and light than a lot of IRSs...but still ver pleasant. I think it is this unique mouthfeel that makes this one of the most highly drinkable IRSs out there."
"EDIT - Each time I have this I like it less. I like my stouts on the less bitter side, I guess. I've got one stashed in the cellar for a year or more so that I can do a side by side with a fresh bottle and see if that helps it for me."
"M/D: The carbonation was moderate, but I didn't find it very thick and creamy. It seemed thin and watery. I didn't hate this beer, the texture just seemed a little strange."
"A really nice RIS. There's great flavour here and it isn't over the top. Just a simple, elegant beer."
"Overall it is a beer worth trying again and again."
"D - Wow. For this type of beer, it might be one of the most drinkable imperial stout. I leave room for a contender but I would have a very hard time passing this beer up if I see it on a menu or bar list."
"D: The alcohol is noticeable but fairly well masked, which doesn't make it too difficult to drink. This is a great beer to sip during the winter months."
"A: A hard pour results in a solid half inch of thick espresso like head that dropped very slowly and left tons of sticky foam on the inside of the glass, the color is dark brown to black, a strong swirl of the glass shows some viscosity as well as some legs - 4.50, S: The initial whiff includes tons of coffee and roasted grains, I also pick up a solid presence of dark fruits - possible dates or raisins, subtle ash and mocha latte - 4.00, T: Thick and rich, overloaded with prunes and dark molasses, there is an almost buttery sweetness that is moderated by a slight grainy ash flavor, solid hop bitterness, burnt grains and coffee as well as some cocoa beans, wonderful palate all around - 4.50, M: Mouth feel is velvety and thick, faint hint of grittiness in the depths - 4.25, D: A true classic and an exceptional example of the style, one of my favorites, very drinkable - 4.50"

"To date this is my favorite brew. I've yet to find a single beer/ale which compares in terms of flavor and overall awesomeness. Although this winter I will be trying the Abyss, so Rasputin's top seat my be in danger."
"D: May have mentioned this before, but I love this beer! I can sit back and sip it all day. Ridiculously drinkable RIS. A good one to have on a crisp afternoon... superb."
"M/D - Heavy body, great carbonation, awesome flavor profile/palate transition. too easy to drink and no alcohol feel/flavor."
"D: An amazing stout. The finish lasts forever!"
"Drinkability: While not quite the best, this is still the quintessential American-made RIS. A smooth and luxurious sipper."
"D: I love this brew and a 4 pack will go down in an evening. I have been drinking this one for a long time and just decided to post a review."
"D: Very drinkable for a RIS being 9% ABV. Its just so tasty and well balanced, the slightly warming of the alcohol is not a deterrent at all, if anything, it makes the drinkability better in this sort of stout. Great for the winter."
"D- As stouts go I would have not trouble drinking this one again."
"The drinkability of this beer is incredible. You really could have a few of these, though I didn't. Overall I'd put this up against many of the big Russian Stouts and say it would fare well. I'm curious if I kept some for a year how it would mellow."
"Dr. Very nice. Goes down easy despite the high ABV and sweet thickness. A good reason to chill only one bottle at a time."
"D - This is a great example of this style. While the beer has a fairly high ABV of 9%, It's very easy to drink and i find myself having to remember that this is a sipper, not a gulper (even though i want to). This beer is very accessible and cheap for me and that makes it one of my absolute favorite RIS's."
"D- A very very good beer. Certainly one that sticks to your ribs. It would be very hard to turn one of these guys down."
"I'll drink this one whenever I have a chance. Just a great Imperial Stout."
"D:Very easy to drink for a RIS and a good example of the style. Could defitinly take down more than one of these. If you are looking for a real treat try to pick up the 11th or 12th anniversary editions of this brew"
"Final Notes: A simply amazing beer that would make for a great winter's night out by the campfire or the fireplace. Will stand up to the heartiest foods. Not for the faint of heart."
"D - Solid. Definitely a drinkable stout."
"D- this is a monster of a stout yet its always super drinkable, on nitro this is a revelation. One of the best brew I've ever had on nitro."
"D-I adored the anniversary stout, and like this, but it feels a bit off balance, like it needs some age to mellow out. Decent beer, but I'll steer straight for the Ten Fidy before buying another pack of this."
"D: Not a beer you are going to want to drink all night, nor is it intended to be. If you could only have one beer however or are looking for one to start or end a session you can't go wrong with this one."
"Notes: Very enjoyable stout. A surprising amount of hops come out. Very strong roasted and burnt malt taste. A great stout, especially given the price."
"Can't recommend this one enough for someone who wants a late night treat."
"D: a very thick filling beer that i'm set with just one or two of these."
"D- very drinkable. Currently my favourite russian imperial stout. Very solid drink. Big fan."
"Very good; not particularly complex but the whole seems greater than the sum of its parts, as it were. I imagine this ages well. Recommended."
"Very drinkable beer even with the 9.0 ABV. One of my favorite beers at any time."
"This was overall an excellent beer from opening it to drinking it. I could definitely enjoy several of these. However, I am still sipping on the one that I am using to write this review."
"On tap at Als served in a nonic. Appears black in color with a thick creamy tan head that retains very well and sticks in thick patches about the glass. Nose is full of dark grains smelling of coffee and dark chocolate with a blend of hops and dark skinned fruity sweetness. The alcohol becomes a bit more noticeable as it warms. Taste includes a mixture of alcohol, roasty grain and slightly citrusy hop bitterness upfront that blends through a medium creamy smooth body with more flavors of dark grainy sweetness. The roasted grains suggest black coffee, dark chocolate and dark skinned fruits much like the aroma indicated. There is a pleasant lingering bitterness from the darkly roasted grain coupled with the flavor and warmth of alcohol. This is a brew I enjoy regularly from a bottle and on nitro it is even more drinkable and creamy in the feel."
"Verdict - This is one of my favorite stouts. I tried this beer in December I believe, and a group of guys I know were drinking it so I thought I'd do the same. Well, the guys had a few more, and these Flying Saucer regulars staggered over to Barnes and Noble across the street where they sat in comfort and sobered up before driving home. This beer is strong. Drink with caution."
"The aromas carry straight through to the palate with strong roasty flavors like sweet coffee and dark chocolate flavors, there is a caramel and toffee sweetness up front also with resounding hop finish. Mouthfeel is heavy, full, silky, and lingering."
"If I have to drink a Russian Imperial, and Blackout isn't on the shelves, this will be my go to. Well done."
"The beer pours absolute black, with an absolutely massive tan head that paints the glass with lacing. Stunning beer. The nose is a little weak, bitter coffee with just a hint of chocolate that only becomes apparent as the beer warms some more. As I sip my opinion of the beer improves, the dark coffee flavor is still most prevalent while dark chocolate makes a little more noise than in the nose and there's also a slight warming sensation from the alcohol. Great mouthfeel on this beer as the body is nice and big and chewy, while the carbonation is suitably low. Old Rasputin is a very good beer, phenomenal in some aspects, but where it really matters most it falls just a little bit short of world class."
"Overall: A great imperial stout. A beer that I will be buying again."
"I love this simplistic approach to an old style beer. I guess that's what makes it so popular and the first RIS for most people to venture into."
"This is easily the best stout-for-your-buck on the market."
"While the Rasputin has a fairly high ABV of 9%, It's delicious enough to drink a lot of. So you gotta be careful not to guzzle too many of these down. This is a great imperial stout, definitely one of my favorites so far."
"However, judging from what I know about Rasputin, this seems like the kind of thing he would drink by the barrelful atleast ten times a day. So I suppose mission accomplished, Comrades."
"Serving type: bottle"
"4.25O: A very good beer, but I'm not sure the changes in flavour advocate ageing. Most of the spice and bitterness has absented itself in favour of slow, mellow sweetness. I probably prefer a fresh bottling, but I might age another one because it changed character significantly more than the Expedition Stout after cellaring."
"D - I doubt I could drink this all night at 9%, but it's perfect for both the colder months and as a pairing with dessert (or by itself!)."
"D: Definately enjoyed, but couldn't drink more then 1 at a time. Would love to drink this with ribs or a steak for sure! Not good in the hot summer heat."
"A wonderful stout that I've enjoyed many times."
"This is an excellent stout. It has it all. The appearance off the draft is decadent. The smell, taste, feel and drinkability embody an imperial stout. It also drinks very smooth for being a huge beer. It has a true stout flavor without added flavors of other coffee or chocolate stouts. This is the real deal."
"D - Very well done and will be drunk again."
"Overall I give this beer the highest marks. If you are looking for a delicious stout this is a great option."
"Food pairing: Mexican porchetta (slow-roasted pork shoulder, wrapped around aromatics)"
"D- Very solid RIS. Good flavor but nothing overpowering. Could drink a few of these easily."
"D: An amazing beer. very well balanced. easy to drink. i would buy this one again. but i would like to try the old Rasputin XII. happy i got this one tho!"
"It's a pretty nice beer. Definitely some substance to it."
"Cheers..."
"The drinkability is good. And though I could easily, It would go against my better judgement to drink more than 1-2."
"Pours a very dark brown with thick tan head. As head settles down, it has a thin layer that stays, leaving lots of lacing. Smells of roasted coffee malt and some citrus hops. Taste starts off with coffee and hop bitterness, but then there is some brown sugar sweetness. Quite creamy mouthfeel. A great RIS. I have the XII as well and now I can't wait to try it."
"D - Easily drinkable, again, watch the ABV, you could easily down a couple of these like they were black & tans! End of the pint glass was like a frothy milkshake. Enjoyable Stout, nice complex flavor. The malts, coffee and chocolate create a good balance of harsh and sweet, the light hops are refreshing."
"Overall: Really well done. I may be drinking this one a little early and getting too much alcohol and astringency. Can't wait to age it and try again."
"Drinkability is a tad low. I like this beer a lot but I don't need or want a lot of it. One is enough for sure."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. No light penetrating through this beer. Smell is of malts and chocolate. Taste is complex, roasted malts, chocolate, a touch of coffee, a little bit of bitterness. Feels creamy in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall a good quality beer."
"One of my all-time faves, let's see if it holds up....Pours a deep, rich black with a velvety-smooth haed of tannish foam. Pours about a finger wide then receeds to a 1/8th inch or so of persistent head. Leaves nice lace. Aroma is huge and robust. Deep chocolate notes, some slightly metallic notes, some other stuff I can't rightly place. Maybe a touch of bourbon. Flavor is dramatic. Nothing hits you immediately, but quickly a blast of flavor attacks. Complex, somewhat bitter but not too bitter. Somewhat sweet, but not too sweet. It's kinda like a Charleston Chew that's been frozen and dipped in espresso flavored syrup. This is incredible beer. The bitterness is sharp, but dissipates into a long, wonderful hop finish. Clearly one of the World's finest ales, without a doubt. Excellently priced, too. This was $1.69/12oz. bottle. You can't call yourself a true beer enthusiast until you've tried and loved this."
"Decent amount of carbonation for a stout, but overall it is smooth and creamy. It looks more syrupy during the pour than it feels to taste, but it is unmistakably thick. A world-class Imperial Stout!"
"Overall, a good stout with a broad appeal, but perhaps not exactly what you're looking for if you're out for an epiphany."
"All in all, this is a great beer that is very drinkable...pretty much the standard for a Russian Imperial Stout."
"Notes: Awesome, delicious beer. Extremely drinkable."
"D: While this is a very well made beer, I think I would only want to drink it again if I was in the mood for it. I don't think the middle of summer was the best time of year for me to try it, but maybe I would want a beer like this when the weather was cold."
"Overall: Excellent stout. This would be a great beer on a cold winter evening. I'm enjoying it late in the afternoon on a hot summer day (inside) and I'm enjoying it thoroughly. This is a must try."
"An exceptional example to all brewers of how to blend coffee with beer while doing credit to each. For an IPA man i found this to be right up my alley. Welcome bitterness, and the darkness is not overwhelmingly sweet or malty. Poured more head than i expected, and the darkness of the beer rivals none"
"At first I heard many good reviews on this wonderul beer and never had the chance until now. I am glad I had the chance to taste this great drink. From begining to end this is a smooth and rich in flavorful beer. The taste of the hops and fruit flavors were a mouthful but not as a punch to the gut but pleasent like."
"On tap at lion's pride. The chocolate flavors were more dominant and the mouthfeel a little more creamy. There was also nuts, licorice and dark fruits. Fresher and superior."
"M - Full-bodied and smoked feel."
"Dark black colored beer with a tan almost amber head and a thick 1-2"" head. Very fine and barely clings to the glass. Very sweet malty aroma. Full of coffee scents. Smells like some burnt chocolate in there too. Taste is very full of bitter coffee and toffee at first with a smooth burnt chocolate finish. There is a small gap in between where there is a kind of relaxing taste that is pretty unique and cool. Medium to heavy bodied with light carbonation. It's great for one drink but probably too heavy for two in one sitting, not to mention 9% ABV"
"Pours black as night with a light brown, two-finger head which leaves a nice frothy lacing. Pleasant creamy chocolate/coffee aroma with a little dark fruit and citrus/pine hops as well. Big roasted flavor. Sweet chocolate and roasted, bitter coffee up front. Pretty hopped up RIS with some pine and sweeter citrus rind. More roasted, dry, somewhat burnt malts on the finish. A very abrupt halt to the flavors after finish. Kind of like a really big Irish dry stout, but with the flavor amped up 10-fold. Creamy, thick mouthfeel."
"The beer pours black with a tan head. The aroma is roasted malt with some chocolate and alcohol. The flavor is awesome. I get notes of chocolate. roasted malt, alcohol and some piney hops, which contribute a medium level of bitterness. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This beer is really pleasant. Not the uber beer I was expecting, but balanced and accommodating in all regards. Another quality brew from North Coast."
"Pours a solid black with a thick, ultra creamy tan-brown head of about 2 inches. The head is persistent and settles in at 1.5 inches. The initial nose suggest dark roast, coffee, chocolate and chicory. The body is medium-full to full. The initial taste expounds on the coffee and chocolate notes with added sweet notes that suggest a confection. The middle notes are full, creamy and rich followed by a smooth lingering. The rich, sweet, roasted notes moderate the bitter hops which are noticeable but not overpowering. This is a multi-layered, rich, ale. The alcohol is evident and provides warmth in the finish. This is not a session beer despite the moreish tendencies. Nice, broad Belgian lace forms. Yes, I will return to it."
"D - Very good. Tasty RIS that I will get again."
"D- easy to drink but better to sip, a top RIS"
"This beer rates a solid A."
"D - it's a bit assaulting out of the bottle, amplifying some of its less pleasing aspects. It shines on nitro, but, for the price, it's about as good as you can get. The four-packs are great for sharing, but not something I can tackle by myself. Best served in the winter, sipped meticulously on a frigid, snowy evening."
"D - it is okay but only a couple."
"Drinkability: Wow. I haven't had this beer for years, but this definitely is a winner. I think it gets over looked for more hyped beers but this is a very smooth and enjoyable RIS that is dangerously smooth and drinkable."
"I in truth have never experienced a mouth feel that was so smooth that packed that amount of flavor, but the downfall with most dark beers is while they taste great, and may have a great mouth feel, you never really want to just drink them non stop."
"High marks on all categories."
"I never thought Raspy could be more drinkable, but off nitro it is."
"D: Probably too good for 9%."
"Drinkability: As I find myself staring at my final third, I can't help but remark about the drinkability of this brew. Many RIS tend to be heavy, thick, viscous sipping beers. This is not like those. It definitely has a pronounced mouthfeel. It's not too light, but it doesn't sit heavily in your stomach either. North Coast created a winner with this RIS, and it is one that I will continue to drink happily here in Kansas."
"This feels dense, creamy, a little slick, and has a warmth to the finish."
"D: It is pretty hefty but this an Imperial Stout, it's not made to session. For the ABV it's not upfront and in your face like it is with some other beers of this style. It is masked very well with the roast aroma and flavor, it sticks out where it should."
"O: Worth the price? Yes. I think a four pack was $9. Recommend? Yes. Search out? Maybe not, but a pick-up-while-it's-there beer. Buy again? I'm sure."
"D: Relatively heavy, I couldn't have more than 1 or two. It goes down ok for a high alcohol beer."
" The drinkability of this beer is scary, it goes down very smooth with a big flavor that is hard to put down. This is a very good Russian Stout,the best beer from North Coast Brewing. I will be buying this beer again and again."
"D: Highly. The alcohol is a ghost in this stout which deceives its 9% content. I know stouts are primarily a winter beer but this thing can be enjoyed in the summer too. As the beer warms it unleashes even more flavors."
"It's not too heavy, very smooth and dry. Warms as it goes down."
"Poured into a tulip. Appearance is black with a nice mocha colored head that is about an inch. The smell reveals a dark fruits; dates and a nice caramel smell lingers in the nostrils. I get a bit of bitterness and some nice roasted malts a cocoa flavors. Also dark fruits that I smelled. Certainly the dates coming to the tongue and some nice roasted malts. I wish it were a little more roasty. Not as full bodied as I expected and a little more carbonation than I expected as well. Nothing offensive though. The nine percent ABV is well hidden. This is a very drinkable RIS, it's not hot going down and the dark fruits make it very pleasent."
"This review, as shown in the ratings, is not meant to dismiss in any way the quality of this beer. It is extremely interesting . . . and in more ways than one delicious. Just not as balanced as some of my favorite stouts."
"D: Smooth feeling malty brew, very drinkable. High alcohol is hardly noticable."
"D- Drinkable-- like it a lot and the fullness of the flavor is pretty great but the mouthfeel just kinda kills it for me"
"Mouth feel and drinkability are both great. Overall, Old Raspy is excellent. I'm glad my pallet has matured enough to enjoy this great brew!"
"This is a beer I've been after for a while, and finally got my hands on it thanks to the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam. Pours jet black with a decent level of carbonation and a big creamy tan head that shows good retention. The aroma is hugely dark and heavy with intense notes of chocolate, coffee and dark forest fruits. The taste is dark and bitter from the start with flavours of the highest quality cocoa, strong bitter espresso and a earthy smokey peat. After a few sips it is really the coffee flavours that come through the strongest, providing a massively rich imperial stout. The feel is full bodied and silky smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a superb imperial stout, one of the best i have tasted. I wish this was easier to get hold of outside of the US."
"D: This beer was so smooth it went down with ease. I've always liked this beer out of the bottle, but nitro made it so much better. If I see this again, I will be ordering it."
"Overall: Overall the beer was very tasty. The flavors were complex but well balanced. I definitely recommend trying this beer."
"Not particularly drinkable, I definitely couldn't have more than one of these given the density and relatively high ABV%. While it lasted, was quite drinkable, but that was the end of the line."
"D: The most drinkable of stouts. The 9% ABV is totally hidden. Be careful with this beer!"
"D- This is a man's meal of a beer, good enough to drink a whole case, just on 24 different nights."
"Overall I was surprised at how much the nitro-tap changed this beer and even more surprised at how it positively affected it. Well worth a shot."
"It is not as opaque as I expected but nearly so. Deep reddish in colour with a tan head that will not go away so I can pour in the rest. The smell reminds me of walking through Central Market in the morning right after they got some fresh rye or Russian black bread done. Bout the same ingredients so... I love it when the heads are creamy, almost ice cream like. As part of them falls away to reveal the delicate insides of tasty cloud. The taste is more effervescent than I thought and man a lot going on. Well you have the fruity flavours from the malt. Deep roasty and a mix of more flavours than I can identify. Almost a plum, slight strawberry, bit of cherry and ten other things that I can't begin to emote. Leaves a taste of slightly overcooked toast and those lovely fruit flavours. I can see why this is a popular one."
"Drinkability: With a somewhat syrupy texture, high abv and a heavy, full body, Old Rasputin is a sipper to end a evening with. Greater ambition might result in an upset stomach."
"This is an excellent russian imperial stout. Complex but still well balanced with a very nice hoppy finish. The mouthfeel shows the beer to be slightly creamy. An excellent beer if you like this style."
"Impressions: Quite good, I love charry tastes in beer and this one certainly has that. Pretty well balanced."
"D: A brew that is an ideal sipper, but for the style, this is one that I could drink often, even could have a few in a row, cannot say the same for other IRSs. Great flavors that keep you coming back for another analysis."
"One of the best year round imperial stouts you can get."
"I'd greatly recommend this beer to all"
"The carbonation is a bit strong, but all in all it has a nice medium body, and is an incredibly drinkable and pleasant RIS."
"D: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, even though some of the elements surprised me. If I hadn't known this was 9% ABV, you wouldn't be able to convince me; the alcohol is hidden behind all the other flavors, and it goes down so smoothly. Other brewers need to try this and take note."
"Thanks to Market of Choice for selling this beer. I finally got to try this beer served in a snifter glass, and drank it in honor of the Man in Black from LOST. Smell was very clean, this beer is a dark brown. I felt that 9% alcohol really served it's purpose, and I don't think I could drink more than 2-3 of these beers in one sitting. However, I enjoyed this very much."
"This might be the best stout I've had."
"D: Great value for the money -- one of the most affordable and easily accessible big RIS on the market, but still delivers in quality."
"A perennial fave, Old Rasputin is one of the best in its class. For the money - $7.50 a 4pk - it doesn't get better. If you haven't had this yet, do so immediately."
"A thick mouthfeel and surprisingly drinkable for the upfront character."
"D-so good; hits all the marks for the style and it's not too heavy or alcohol dominant; it is pricey tho..."
"Nice after dinner beer."
"The mouthfeel is good and it is real drinkable for the high alcohol content. I definitely enjoyed this beer and would be happy to have it again."
"d- $7-8 bucks a 4pk makes this an appealing beer everytime I'm looking for an impy stout. its easy enough to drink to put a couple back in a session. what else do you want? seriously"
"D - a sipping/dessert beer. I may be able to handle 2-3 before I have to switch to something lighter."
"D: As far as RIS's go, this is one of my favorites. It never disappoints on the classic flavor of what a RIS should be. Absolutely delicious and more breweries should take some notes on this one. Alcohol hidden well, ridiculously huge roasty flavor, perfect RIS."
"This is one hell of a beer. I'm really glad I got another 3 waiting for me! Definately won't be sharing this one with my friends haha!"
" ~ Overall this is a very good beer. There are few stouts that can brag such a robust palate. If you haven't tried this stout, you need to."
"Overall this is a tasty stout, very refreshing, and has a nice amount of hops present. I can definitely see why this is so well regarded, and will be drinking this again in the future."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and thick all the way through, with the heavy roast notes playing a nice contrast. It's smooth all the way, with carbonation just a bit on the high side. This beer is on the low end abv-wise for Imperial Stouts, but it feels a bit higher. This beer paired well with a chocolate cake. The dry aspects made it a refreshing pairing while at the same time being very rich."
"Very drinkable beer only the high gravity limits the number I can drink."
"Ahhh... a perennial favourite! The colour is mahogany brown with no head. The aroma is sharply malty with anise , coffee ground and hops. On the palate, a creamy mouth feel with loads of dark chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, chewy licorice, strong coffee, biting hops, some phenolic notes and a helluva long finish!"
"drinkability - very complex, amazing mouthfeel on nitro, really smooths out the flavors"
"D: One glass per sitting is perfect. Very drinkable for an Imperial Stout."
"D: A fantastic deal; I often find 4-packs under $8 and this most recent one cost $6. Great quality, fantastic pricing. It's great to revisit it and enjoy a staple for once. These days, it is outclassed by bigger, heavier interpretations of the style. But those beers also tend to be significantly more expensive, and not so much more enjoyable that this ceases to be a good deal."
"I can see why this sits on the top 5 of the most reviewed beers on this site and still retains such a high rating. Complex, very flavourful, and oh so easy to drink. I'd say this is my favourite RIS to date with Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout close behind. Worth EVERY penny."
"I am just starting to get into the RIS style and thought this would be a good beer to start with. The darkness of this beer is impressive being black hole like. When you take a deep inhale of this elixir you get a breath of roasted malts that is very inviting and intriguing. The mouthfeel of this beer is thick and chewy making it a slow slipper. The taste starts out witha lsoght sweet note then the roated malts take over which is a good thing(thats what these beers are all about). Enjoy this in the winter by a fireplace at the end of the evening and you will get the full enjoyment of this brew."
"JUst when I think the market is flooded with too many micro Impys, along comes a big full bodied version with a viscous mouth feel hugely complex. One if the better American Imperial Russian stouts."
"For a RIS, the drinkability is as crazy as old Rasputin himself. So smooth. If I didn't know its ABV, I would say it was sessionable but obviously this one would kick your ass if you tried."
"D - Well I might have a snifter or 2 after a long day. I did expect a bit more complexity for sure, I don't recommend drinking this straight out of the fridge because there's more flavors to enjoy when it's around room temp. Pretty good, not sure if I'd buy it again but I definitely recommend it. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is low on this one. This beer is alcoholic on first impression but as the temperature rises, the dark chocolate and alcohol seem to mix rather nicely making for a smooth, enjoyable stout."
"This is a damn good RIS though not my favorite."
"Poured from a stubby bottle with no freshness date, into a pint glass. Poured very dark brown with tan head that stayed around for a while. Strong scents of over cooked barley, dark chocolate and coffee. Strong coffee flavors some cocoa. Nice roasted after taste. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth. Alcohol is well hidden. Drinkable nature would be limited to one for me because of the strong flavor. Very nice sipper."
"Could have 2 or 3 before switching to something else. Will definitely have this again."
"D - Something between a sipper and a swigger. Compelling and warmly inviting, this is an easy brew to enjoy."
"D: Amazing beer that is highly drinkable. Despite its rich flavors and high alcohol content you could easier polish off a few in an evening. Highly recommended."
"D Very drinkable despite the high alcohol content. I could see myself sipping on 2-3 of these on a quiet night at home with a movie."
"At Jameson Tavern in Freeport, ME this famous brew is near pitch black with a modest light brown head and similar lacing. The aroma says chocolatey herbal hop and some alcohol. The flavor offers charcoal raisin and prune hop bite. There's brown bread molasses and wine-like qualities that hint at a barleywine. Near full bodied but for a fairly intense beer it's drinkable."
"In short, I think this beer has something for everyone. Whatever you have a preference for you'll find a litlle bit in here combined with other good flavors and aromas and feels all relatively balanced and smooth drinking. I think this accounts for it's overall crowd pleasing nature. And I say that with the utmost respect."
"I've been waiting to try this brew for a while and have to say I'm disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high, or the bottle needed to mellow a bit. Overall, the unbalanced alcohol taste and smell left me wishing I cellared the bottle. But will give this another chance."
"Drinkability: Despite the high alcohol I think I could go for another. Went well with a meal (Italian seasoned beef and noodles) and I know it would go well with a dessert as well."
"D - Great! Can I have another one?"
"drinkability - for what it is, i could drink alot more in one session."
"D - I'm don't think I'd have more than one of these in a session. The first half of the beer went down pretty quick, but the carbonation bloat and burnt flavors got a little overwhelming after that. Think I'll stick to the nitro from now on."
"At this price for a growler (2 for 1 at Half Time) it is the best buy on the planet. At regular price I may revisit, maybe not. Right now there are superb, and better, stouts out there."
"D-one of the best of this style, perfect for a rainy day"
"D - Surely no session beer, but it accels for the style, and is quite wonderful. I will seek this out in the future, and surely never pass when given a chanc to have it on nitro."
"D- 2-3 is enough but could drink more."
"I keep giving this beer chances, but honestly this is not very good. Probably will not buy from the bottle again. On draft it is a pretty nice beer though. There is not much skill in this beer."
"Thick body, right carbonation and really easy to drink. Did get a hint of the alcohol as I got to the end. I think that this beer would probably work best at the end of a meal; it would certainly be difficult to drink more than two in any one setting. Overall, great beer."
"Notes-Honestly, I find this beer a tad overrated; I like it, but it doesn't blow me away or anything. It's main selling point, at least to me, is it's surprising drinkability. I also think it could benefit considerably from turning down the hops and turning up the chocolate malt."
"Dark black pour, ruby highlight, thick frothy tan head. Strong chocolate aroma. Quite a bit of alcohol on the nose and a fair amount of dark roasted coffee with some smoky hops. Very chocolaty flavor with a fair amount of burnt coffee beans. The alcohol is very noticeable. Body is full and creamy with more notable alcohol warming. As this one warmed up more I'm finding the body and the malts a tad bit thin for an Imperial Stout. I would almost compare this more to a good Baltic Porter. I know I'm nitpicking on that issue, but I couldn't think of any other way to make note of my observation."
"taste. A big chocolate/coffe taste that only gets better as it warms. Has some burnt malt bitterness that balances the overall sweetness of this beer. this great beer."
"Overall a great beer, and i will be drinking this again!"
"D - A classic, one of the best RIS I've tasted, and at 9% ABV it is deceptively drinkable. Highly recommended for stout lovers."
"Recently I have been feeling like the on-tap version was underwhelming, because I expect this stuff to be stellar; I guess it has been a few years since I've really had a few of the bottles, and I was wrong, the bottles are definitely inferior to the tap."
"One of the best RIS I've had, right up alongside Southampton. Highly recommended."
"releases."
"D: ABV hidden well. Could not tell if it was 6% or 10%. Thats scary. I wouldn't call it a session beer, but, 2 of these slid pretty easy."
"pretty drinkable considering the alcohol content, but not sessionable. two of these and you're likely done for the night. a pretty solid beer but not one that i feel lives up to it's reputation. i can think of a few other RIS that i would rather have than this one - bell's expedition, stone, founders..."
"Pretty drinkable for the style and ABV, just wish I had picked this up back in December."
"D: very good beer! I could definitely drink 2-3 easy. definitely not a 6 pack beer but for what it is, it is very good and well crafted."
"Rating by Tommy from BrewFanatics.com"
"As the bros said in their review this is the perfect chill beer. Very drinkable stout."
"D- Very high, considering. WHile not overly complex, this still deserves the time to sip and ponder, really take into account what this is and just how good it is. Great RIS, one of my favorite non-seasonal RISs. A real winter classic, get a bunch for your next snowstorm!"
"D- The moderately coarse carbonation makes this a little less drinkable than it would be otherwise... still drinks well though."
"Old Rasputin is a solid beer, though nothing amazing. I can't see myself ever craving it, but I can definitely imagine sitting down with one and occasionally thinking, ""Ah, this is just what I needed."" It's a solid, no nonsense RIS. The mouthfeel is a little off, but it's not that big a deal. All told, it has a great balance of hops and spot-on ""big stout"" malt notes. A good deal for the price at which it's usually sold, definitely."
"D - I need this. Now. All frickin night. Sex in my mouth please. 5.0"
"Note: factoring in the bottle price, this beer is exceptional!"
"From the beginning, it has the perfect color for an imperial stout, with a deep, dark opaque black/brown color and a fluffy mocha-colored cap. The aroma is likewise a terrific example of what an imperial stout should smell like, with notes of dark bittersweet chocolate and heavily roasted malts. The flavor is also packed with dark chocolate, malts that are roasted to the point of charring, and a dark caramel sweetness. The body is a bit thin, but it is smooth and warming. Overall, not intriguing or different, but it is a well-constructed, flavorful, and enjoyable example of the style."
"D - This is a very smooth, drinkable beer, but you could not have many before it catches up to you."
"overall: well crafted great beer for the money and its very consistent and it is great fresh and great with age too"
"Overall, a nice beer. Not in my top 10 RIS' but a steal at $7.99 a 4 pack. Hit's the style on the head but doesn't do anything outstanding. An average RIS."
"Pairs beautifully with chocolate chip cookies or vanilla ice cream."
"Burnt taste, massive. A little hoppy. Coffee dominates, choco comes after that. Good bitterness, yet thick and slick. Minimal alcohol presence relatively speaking. Gets easier to drink throughout, great price compared to all the other ""to the extreme special release"" IS out there. Take a lesson boys, this is how you bring the best product at the best price to the consumer."
"Pours a deep dark black with little tan head and awesome lacing. Smells like an evil chocolate coffee and tastes the same. Amazing coffee and malt tastes here, feels heavy in the mouth with a nice even carbonation. I love this beer, but after a pint or 2 that would be about it. It's perfect to sip at the end of the day, after dinner, just before you go to bed."
"Drinking a 5-year old bottle - one from the same 4-pack as this original review awesomely enough! I still love me some Old Rasputin. Pretty much the classic American RIS with no barrels or adjuncts needed. Based on aging experiments, I'd say this beer is probably best enjoyed on the fresher side, but 4-packs are pretty inexpensive, so if you're into cellaring I say go for it. This 5-year old bottle is still nicely carbonated, tamed, retains decent depth and is super smooth, goes down extremely easy. Wish I had a fresh bottle to compare but this is a nice treat."
"D_Drinks very well."
"Wow, I'm really impressed with old Rasputin. Its been a while since I've had stones' Russian imperial but if memory serves this ranks up there."
"D- I will be revisiting this well rounded stout. I look forward to the Oak aged 12."
"D- Before I knew it, I looked down to see this beer already gone, and wanting much more. My wallet could take a beating if this was on tap regularly."
"D- This is a very good...ok it's a greast year around beer that I can't get enough of. Good beer within the style and would recommend to anyone!"
"Overall, I've had this beer many times and every time it's excellent. Not only is this RIS well crafted, but North Coast has the quality control down pat. Never a bad bottle. Even with the large surge in new RIS's and special release RIS's hitting the market, Rasputin still manages to hold it's own; and for the price it is often a better beer. Old Raspy will always be a classic. Never say die."
"D - Fairly decent for a RIS, more than two might get you into some trouble though."
"Highly recommended for all you stout heads!"
"Full bodied and really smooth. Nice roast character at the back some sweetness up front. Coffee and roast. Finishes cleanly but there is a lingering bitterness. Nice palate connectivity, carbonation adds body but not any sourness. Overall its a wonderful beer. As far as availability and price, its hard to miss out on Old Raspy."
"Cheers!"
"At first sight I couldn't imagine why anyone would want to pay nearly ten dollars for a four pack of 12 oz bottles of this beer. However, after taking home some Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout, I was pleasantly surprised by this North Coast Brew. It had a very nutty and dark smell with very low carbonation. I really enjoyed drinking this beer and after finishing all of them, I quickly realized why they only come in a four pack. As an NC native, I drink a lot of Duck Rabbit Milk Stout and I found Old Rasputin to be kind of a heavier thicker version of duck rabbit. I wonder if it comes on tap and if so where can I get some???"
"D: Super flavorful, incredible mouthfeel, great aromatics, a super solid imperial stout available everywhere at a great price."
"Pours black with a thumb wide tan head. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Despite my stuffy nose, I smell some beautiful roasted coffee and chocolate. First sip gets me just that: coffee with some bitter dark chocolate mixed in. Its quite wonderful. It tastes absolutely delicious! I only got a 4 pack of this, and its going to be gone by the end of the night. I'm definitely going to grab this again, and share it with some of my other stout loving friends."
"D: Very nice RIS. Good sipper or drinker. This is a great go-to big beer when you're looking for a big beer without the big hops of a DIPA or sweetness of a BW. Price is right and good availability."
"Overall I really really enjoyed this beer. It is probably best enjoyed with a nice sweet desert. I had this for the first time with some potato chips, but trust me, if I had some cheesecake it would have paired perfectly!"
"A very good value beer, easy to drink and a regular for me..."
"I poured it straight from the fridge, very cold and for this too cold so I'm letting it sit for a bit, I reccomend it. Taste is great, very rich and it's god lots of deep nutty and rich smokey flavors. Burnt coffee and toast are there. Mouthfeel is very rich and full, super creamy one of the best stouts ive had. Much better than the much priced big brother XII"
"D/M- awesome classic beer to relax with and just take it all in."
"Nose and palette say Vanilla, maple syrup, roasted malt, roasted malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate is also very prominent, and the tip of my tongue is tingling from a decent amount of hops, which along with a steady amount of carbination give this a pretty great mouthfeel. not the thickest but still quite oily. I'd reach for another."
"From the first pour. Chocolate light brown head that disolves leaving a clean line throughout. Great drink all the way through. With a mild sweet hint of chocolate that melts away with a good sharp finish after every drink. Smooth all the way through. 9%, you can taste it. With this amount of ABV it is a cool kick back beer, and something to enjoy any time. Room temp. for sure."
"Old Rasputin poured black, with a good sized head. I found the smell to be a bit offensive, smelling like stale bread and cheese, however that did not take away from the taste. It had a great ""stout"" taste, no extra flavors (which isnt really a bad thing), just a very strong ""stout"" taste. It was easy to drink even though it was a heavier beer, only real downside to this beer was the price, but a very good buy."
"the beer is very drinkable, and smooth on the palate. although a few of these might put you in the drunk tank for the night."
"Now I'm a fledgling beer reviewer, so don't be too hard on me. I judge a beer mostly on taste and that's why Old Rasputin gets so many high marks from me. The smell of this stuff is great too. I can't resist taking a wiff when I crack open a bottle. The taste is complex, full, chocolatey, hint of strong black coffee. Finish a tad dry, but the suggestion of sweet in the beginning more than compensates for this. Mouthfeel wonderful, might be the high APV that gives it a wee bit of listerine intensity. I can drink these all day long. As an enjoyer of stouts, this beer strikes me as highly drinkable though not everyone will share this opinion. It is worth note that after about three or four bottles you can look at the label and almost see Rasputin working his wicked magics upon you. All and all this is a stellar beer, one of my personal faves that no fan of stouts should pass up without giving it a try. High APV always a plus in my book too. 9% Hot diggity! Will warm you in the winter for sure."
"Overall, very drinkable i think. I'd definitely have another."
"Overall, I'm happy to have found this one and consider it to be a very good stout."
"D- A good sipper. I don't think I would drink more then 2 in a row. Abv wouldn't allow me to have to many anyways."
"D - This beer is big and filling with a high ABV. I would get this again."
"I didn't enjoy Old Rasputin, to the point where I almost wasn't even going to bother reviewing it. Obviously, it's a highly regarded beer on here, but it wasn't for me. The taste is what turned me off. It is very bitter. The high alcohol content is not hidden at all, like you will see in other beers. I found the drinkability to be extremely low. This is a beer I probably won't try again."
"D - Four pack anyone? As one of the oldest imperial company's I ever had this beer is a keeper. Will squeeze in a bottle every now and again."
"D - This is a one (or at most 2) serving experience. Too heavy for an extended session."
"This is almost like an imperial porter instead of a stout. The mouthfeel is lighter than what I come to think of when I thik of a RIS. Recommended if you can get it. Ten Fidy is still my favorite though."
"This is a classic, suberb beer. It is dangerously drinkable. You don't feel the 9% until it is too late. A wonderful treat of a beer, probably well paired with a rich cigar, a rich desert, or on a bitter cold day. Thumbs up and cheers to North Coast for unleashing this wonderful ale on the world."
"Its drinkable and warming with good flavors but it doesn't beg you to take another sip. The mouthfeel does not work well with the flavors."
"D= 5.0 I could sip on this beer all night. World class outstanding beer! North coast did it again"
"Overall Impression: At one time this was my favorite R.I.S. What can I say, it still kicks ass!"
"D - Goes down easy especially for a RIS, but there are alot better choices in the style than this, but it is a good price for the quality."
"D - I kinda wish it were a lower ABV that way I could have a few more without worrying about my liver. Great beer."
"Verdict: Old Rasputin may not be the biggest Russian Imperial Stout out there, but it's solid, balanced well, very drinkable, and thoroughly enjoyable. While I usually don't mention price, it's well-worth mentioning that this is a terrific value."
"Again, just a great RIS not to be missed."
"Overall, an exceptional beer and an outstanding example of the style. Technically, this beer is brewed with the utmost tender loving care."
"D - A great RIS. good to sip on, but wouldn't want to drink more than one or two in a session"
"D: Bold and hardy brew that defies it's own name by being a highly drinkable stout. Putting back three or four of these would not be a problem, especially in the colder winter months."
"Do to it being sucha great stout the drinkability suffers a little but it makes up for it with flavor and it creamy mouth feel."
"Always a classic, but seems like age hasn't helped it (besides the nose). Now I need a fresh one."
"D: Each sip leaves me craving more. Period. End of story."
"D- Very drinkable... Could take down a few of these bottles possibly all four before it filled me up. Overall a veryyy good brew and highly recommended."
"Smell was actually rather weak, but a slight chocolate scent, very pleasant. The taste is rather brilliant, this is a very balanced beer with little alcohol taste, especially for a 9% beer. Slight chocolate flavor to it, much like the scent. Feels great in the mouth, slightly thick and lingers for a bit. This beer is highly drinkable, I could gladly enjoy two or more."
"This is a great beer, but powerful. Consume with caution. I thoroughly enjoyed this, but one is satisfying."
"North Coast has done a good job with this, I will definitely be hunting for this again."
"This is a relaxing sipper that can just be enjoyed, while providing the complexity need for you to stay hooked."
"Notes: This beer is driven by dry espresso flavors that are simply delicious. However its not too dry so as to hurt drinkability. The roast flavors, bitterness, and sweetness all work to enhance one another and is very delicious."
"D: Alcohol starts to kick in quick with the Imperial, as it should. Goes down very easy for the style."
"The beer is far less complex than the XII, which makes me reflect on how beautiful that beer really was. But at this price, this is a sensational RIS that makes no mistakes. I will buy a lot of this, especially as Peche Mortel is all gone and Brooklyn Brewery Chocolate Imperial Stout is harder to come by in BC recently..."
"Is there alcohol in this RIS? Couldn't taste it at all. I drank 3 of them right off. Felt the effects in the morning. Ouch."
"Mouthfeel is medium, definitely not thin, but not syrupy either. Just right imo. You don't really notice the alcohol so much in the taste, but it sneaks up on you a little bit and leaves you with a nice warm relaxed feeling."
"Overall this is one of my favorite stouts and probably my favorite stout that is released year round. mmmm"
"If the Czarina had been drinkin' Old Raspy instead of listening to his quacky advice on Hematology, history would have been much different. Poured into my Great Lakes BC pint glass, and allowed to sit for about 10 minutes to warm up. Zippo head, and black. Smells like 2 day old coffee grounds, which personally, I find appealling. Very smooth, no aftertaste, faint burnt something-or-other taste. Paid about $44 for a case."
"*sidenote: i didn't catch much of a ""dark fruit"" or really much of anything but that traditional tofee malt taste. Maybe in the backend of the taste there was just a hint, but certainly not much"
"M/D- Very moutfilling. coats ur palate very well and is smooth finishing in comparison to some RI's i've had. All around great beer."
"Given the availability and price, there is no reason not to have some of this in your fridge. I can't believe it took me so long to try this beer."
"Pours pretty much black, and very dense. nice deep tan two finger head. Head leaves great lacing down the glass. Smells very nice, with a great blend of chocolate, toffe, and a bit of a dark fruity smell. Taste follows suit, but with a bit more complexity. the fruit in the aroma is more prominent in the flavor, and some coffee is noticeable. I loved this stout, a fantastic brew."
"The granddaddy of Imperial stouts."
"Drinkability: Pretty rough, but really flavorful. This took awhile to get through, but I'll definitely be ordering it again."
"D - Very enjoyable RIS. This is definitely one to reach for."
"This RI stout is fantastic. The drinkability is probably higher than almost any RIS or IS or IPA I've had, or should I say any beer of 8.1%+. I like the bitterness and tang which separates it from most RI's, there is a crisper finish to me and a hint of welcome metallic tones. It almost seems like someone added a few tablespoons of Newcastle to this one. Additionally, there's a bit of sweetness which comes in the form of distinctive carmel. The texture in the mouth is a bit less viscous than the Stone, my permanent reference point, but also a bit less round and unified. Again one could say mouthfeel is heading towards Newcastle or even Guiness ever so slightly (and just slight enough). Besides that rare nutty-metallic tang, Rasputin has lovely dark malty flavors with the coffee/chocolate/toffee somewhere and just enough herbal notes to round it off. It's rare that a beer can avoid overdoing the hoppy and floral tones to my liking while still including them, and this one does it to perfection. If you're a fan of floral tones, I've noticed those flavors are more pronounced as you approach room temperature, where the beer seems more oily and chewy."
"Overall I this has to be one of the best fairly wide distributed Imperial Stouts on the market. Highly recommended."
"Overall I call this a benchmark for RIS. There are better ones out there with other flavors, and techniques added but as far as a standard I'd say this is your beer. Drink this and enjoy some fondue with apples and sausage."
"Full bodied, really thick and almost syrupy. Super rich and delicious. Its so smooth and drinkable though. This beer is like an amazing desert. If you like stouts, there is no way you should ever pass this up."
"A very good RIS and a great bargain in an RIS to boot. Highly recomended!"
"What more can be said about Old Raspy, a beer that has over 2000 reviews now? It's a classic RIS, and probably the best RIS for the price. Cannot beat $8.59 for a 4 pack."
"NEVER SAY DIE! the guy behind the counter practically told me old rasputin's life story when buying this. very entertaining. North coast and Indiana broke up momentarily which sucked for about six months, but things are back up again i can enjoy the old rasp and red seal year round again. Pours opaque black sabbath, dear lord. one finger sand colored head with fantastic lacing. smells sexy, potent, and strong, like perfection. Heavenly nutmeg, coffee, candy, and love. The mouthfeel is the best part. creamy and delicious. very very drinkable for only 8.99 a four pack."
"Great beer. I want more. More ice cream, too!"
"M/D: Pretty drinkable stout with a very smooth mouthfeel - super creamy."
"D: I like this beer but the higher ABV would probably keep me from having more than a few at a time. I could see this one going well with a nice steak dinner."
"This beer is for the sip not the chug. Enjoy one of these and move on to something else. Two would be too much flavor."
"Old Rasputin disappeared from my glass much more quickly than a stout this big should, which qualifies it as dangerously drinkable."
"D- drinkable, yes, but not excessively so. I've had RISs that were smoother; Old Rasputin's mouthfeel and taste make me rather savour this one. Not a session beer for me, but one of my favorites."
"Rasputin is super smooth, creamy, and incredibly thick. You're almost chewing it. The carbonation is a tad high for the style, unfortunately, which stops it from being perfect. Still, easily one of the most, if not THE most drinkable RIS I've sampled. I'll certainly be conferring with the old Russian mystic again."
"I'm reviewing the nitro version although i have had way more of it bottles and regular draft. Had this at the green frog in the 'ham. First thing i noticed was how smooth it was. Damn i could drink a lot of this stuff! Way smoother than the bottles. Still had all the taste and complexity of the bottle version, just way easier to drink. I just love the tobacco flavor of old ras, i don't know why. One of my favorites of all time, hands down..."
"One of the R.I.S. that i get excited about seeing in my glass... or rather, not:)"
"Mouthfeel was slightly syrupy and did a good job of coating the palate. Drinkability was good as the alcohol is subdued but it creeps up on you."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability is great for a beer of this type. I could easily have a couple more, provided I have an entire night to drink it in. The alcohol is masked well enough and the beer itself is so tasty that it'd be easy to just keep going. This is quite a tasty brew, something I look forward to having again."
"D - I could drink a couple of these back to back to back easily. It is a good stout that does not overpower the palate with a nice chocolaty taste."
"Drink up my friends, this is a beer to fill your fridge, share with friends, and cherish until it is no longer with us."
"While this is thick and vicious you hardly taste the alcohol at all. Quite drinkable considering how big this brew is."
"Raspy's the quintessential Russian Imperial stout. It's also easy to come by which is a plus. I had this with porterhouse steak, which was delicious to say the least."
"Old Rasputin is my quintessential Russian Imperial Stout. It defines the style and does it with flying colors. Not to mention at 3-4 dollars a pop and widely available, does it get more well-rounded than Raspy? I don't think so."
"a VERY enjoyable beer. one of the top picks for the night."
"Overall, this is a solid, flavorful RIS that not only brings good looks to the table, it has the flavor to back it up. The drinkability takes a slight hit because of the 9%, but other than that this is a damn tasty stout that is easy to appreciate."
"Just fabulous. Absolutely fabulous. It's pretty. It's tasty. It smells good. If it could walk and talk and have sex with me, I'd marry it. Rasputin and Storm King are my winter Stout staples. An almost perfectly balanced Stout. Just dry and hoppy enough and sweet and malty enough at the same time. Velvety on the tongue without being cloying and viscous. I love this beer!"
"D- Awesome, I can share a few with my pals, no problem !"
"D - As I continue to drink it, the alcohol becomes more prevalent. Still remarkably smooth for a 9% ABV. Couldn't drink more than one, but that is par for the course with imperial stouts in general."
"Drinkability: Not awful, but I didn't like this one as much as i would have expected to."
"Pours black as coal with a tiny head,smells of coffee and roasted malts a small bite of cocoa,This is a well balanced stout lots of malt and hop character,just the right amount of alcohol on the exhale,easy drinker readily available and fair priced make this a cornerstone in my fridge"
"d - Overall I really liked it. It was a lot smoother than I was expecting and considering the high ABV, it goes down real easy. Would definitely buy again."
"Generally not a stout fan, but this is a very good example of one. Not something I would drink all night, but good for an occasional indulgement."
"There is no date on the bottle so I can't say whether this is fresh or not but I'll certainly be saving a couple bottles for aging."
"O: The second example of this style that I've ever had and already a favorite."
"D: A very drinkable RIS, this one will not rock the boat."
"D- Excellent beer and a treat to drink even with the high ABV."
"D: I think I like the flavor of the bottled version just a bit more, but this is an extraordinary stout no matter how you drink it. If you have the opportunity to try this on draft, do it! One of the best Russian Imperials out there."
"single picked up somewhere along the way - had this one for about a year now"
"Side Notes: I'm not a huge fan of the style but this is a great beer, and reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a good Imperial Stout."
"Serving- 12oz bottle."
"Buy Again? If I can find it again, definitely."
"a great Russian Imperial Stout. a perfect example of the style. up there with Victory's Storm King as my favorite US brewed RIS. i need to try more of North Coast's offerings"
"Rich, creamy, and smooth mouthfeel. A bit of alcohol bite, and an excellent overall Russian Imperial Stout."
"I love that I can go down to the store and get this beer almost anytime. It's beautiful and full of coffee and cigar flavors that you can savor."
"unique RIS in the sense its more hoppy than others, but its very good."
"A very fine RIS - would certainly buy again!"
"This is just amazing, one of the best beers I have ever had."
"Verdict: Overall it's really good, but due to the heavy feeling of the beer, a 4-pack of Old Rasputin could probably last me a week instead of a night. Some beers beg you to finish them all in one sitting, but patience seems to be a virtue with the few Russian Imperial Stouts I've tried."
"Value: I paid around $2.79 for a single 12oz bottle which I'd say is a bargain."
"Overall - Delicious. I'm sure I'll buy it again in the future!"
"D-very tasty RIS, nothing that blows me away but extremely consisntent and for the price, not bad!! Especially driving to Vintage Estates in Ohio where it is $2.25 a bottle."
"The feel is thick and creamy. Medium to full body, with some nice crispness from the carbonation."
"D: I could drink another with no problem, however, the alcohol is creeping up in the finish as well as the hops.. Overall this is one of the classics."
"My only complaint is that I didn't have enough."
"I have probably purchased this beer 6-7 times and have been impressed by it every time. Surely there are more elite stouts out there that I have not yet found but it may just bet hat this has everything that I look for in a stout. It has a rich flavor with a slight dark chocolate taste that resonates on your tongue for quite a while after finishing. IT isn't quite sweet but it isn't overly bitter either. Overall a great stout and I will definitely keep it on the grocery list."
"Drinkability- extremely drinkable I could easily whip through a 4 pack of this with no sweat at all, I dont think I could get tired of this beer in one nite, I hadnt visited this one in a long time and I regret having not, delicous and a very nice value in this current era of raising beer prices, a winner in my book"
"Mouthfeel is milkshake thick, carb (nitro) is perfect. Drinkability is unheard of for this kind of business."
"Overall a great RIS, and probably one of the best values of the style at $8.99/4-pack. I would place it slightly behind Stone's IRS or Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, but I still highly recommend it!"
"Extremely tasty and drinkable. You feel the alcohol more than you can taste it. This brew was highly recommended at Tiffany's Wine & Spirits. It's an impressive RIS that reminds me of Bells Expedition Stout. I want to go back to Tiffany's to buy another single bottle to cellar."
"D: More drinkable than I recalled. Wonder if it has to do with it having a year of cellaring on it?"
"a very nice imperial stout"
"Overall this is a good RIS, nothing mindblowing but a good example of the style."
"Very good Russian Imperial Stout! A must try...this will be a regular beer at my house!"
"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter, this looks real good. Black with a light brown head, body is as near opaque as I've ever seen in a beer: there's no light coming through and there is minimal lacing. Smells like coffee, smells sweet. Really tastes like a coffee, has that bitter coffee acidity on the back of the tongue. Leads to a chocolatey burp. This beer stands up nicely to and complements well my dad's Christmas English Toffee. 9.0% is well hidden, I feel like I could put down quite a few of these."
"A clean, rich, strong, yet subtle brew - highly drinkable especially considering the robust ABV and IBU."
"Drinkability- Finishing one makes me want another."
"Taste is simply perfect for the style. Lots of chocolate, coffee and plenty of earthy hops. Just the right amount of hop balance really. Very creamy and smooth in the mouth and not a hint of the high ABV. This beer always sneaks up on me when I have it on tap. So easy to toss back a pint and not even realize how much alcohol it has. I'm glad to be enjoying this one at home, but I think the draft version is slightly better. I can't help but think if I had never had this on tap then I would probably rate the bottle version perfect."
"This was my first RIS I ever tasted. Since then the style has become one of my most favorites and this beer has become one of my staples. You should try it on nitro tap!"
"D-If this beer was 5% abv, I could drink this all day and night. But low and behold, it's 9% abv, so I might be able to have 2 in a night. But I love just sippin this sniffer glass full of OR RIS. Perfect RIS indeed. WOW...."
"When the weather gets cold, there are few beers I enjoy more than Old Rasputin. Big, bold, & intense, but drinkable and balanced. Chocolate & coffee are the dominant flavors - notes of vanilla & black licorice are present as well. A perfect after dinner beer & with 9% ABV the warming qualities make it an ideal winter libation. Highest recommendation."
"Overall good, but probably better out of the bottle with some conditioning."
"I'm wondering if my glass was dirty, cause if so this may have been a rare A+ looks average but well ahead in all other departments. doesn't cost a fortune either here in Alberta making it just that much better, drink, think, repeat"
"D - Dangerously drinkable for 9%. A bit warming from the alcohol. Keeps me warm on these cold winter nights."
"D- An awesome RIS; a great sipper on a cold day."
"Most certainly one of the best known and most loved RIS, as evidenced by the 2000+ reviews before this one. One of the beers that got me into the craft scene. Dark as night, rich, immensely complex, it doesn't get much better than this for the style. Chances are, you've had it before, but if you haven't, I highly recommend it."
"overall, get this beer in the cold months anytime you can...you'll thank me and the others on here..."
"D: Rasputin delivers a huge collection of flavors, all in great balance with each other, and still somehow never overwhelms. If I had one, I could probably enjoy a full 4-pack, assuming it wouldn't knock me out first. Brilliant."
"Full bodied and firm, but shows hints of softness. Alcohol is well hidden at 9%. A well-made beer, and while far enough down my list of top imperial stouts, this proves to be a great value."
"Notes: It has Rasputin on the bottle what more do you need. This great beer and is a corner stone in the world of Russian Imperial Stouts."
"Drinkability: Definitely a beer brewed for sipping. This is full of flavor and is delightful to drink."
"Drinkability: A great stout!! As tasty and complex as you could expect. The high alcohol content makes this potent stuff, so I'd probably only have one at a time. Nevertheless, this is one of the best beers I've had."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. This beer pours black in color, only slight highlights of dark brown while pouring it. There is a tan colored head, similar to a cola head just less fizzy. It goes away only after a few minutes. I didn't expect to see much lacing to it, but it has a different sort of stick to it. It's almost like a syrupy consistency that every so slowly slides back down to the liquid on each sip you take. The aroma has quite a bit going on and in my opinion is much better from the bottle than on tap. As most RIS's there is a great deal of chocolate in the smell as well as the roasted malts and some roasted coffee too. The hops really stand out in the smell however, and are probably the most dominant feature. It took me several sips before I noticed how strong the hop taste was. Initially you taste the dark chocolate and roasted coffee. It's well malted too, but overpowered by the coffee and chocolate. After the 3rd sip or so, the hops again become a more dominant feature of the flavor. It's still a very tasty beer, a great combination of all the ingredients. The mouthfeel was good, but after awhile, the hops leave your moth just the slightest bit too dry. Its still full bodied while at the same time being a little silky, but it's still certainly more dry than it needs to be. This is still a very drinkable RIS, or beer in general. Consensus...I think I like it a little better from the bottle, but I'd never turn either down!"
"12/5/2009: Consumed after a Founders Breakfast Stout, and the contrast is substantial. Much sweeter and boozier with a more traditional dark malt sweetness with a more bitter chocolate component with a light bourbon note. Not much different than the fresh OR."
"Pours a dark brown color with a decent tan color head. Aromas of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and bitter espresso. Great taste, the bitterness is perfectly balanced in this. Very warming from the alcohol but not too overwelming. Very chewy mouthfeel. An extremely tasty Imperial Stout, highly recommended!"
"I love this brew. I prefer it with some age on it, but wanted to review it fresh."
"D - An outstanding Imperial Stout, and definitely not an all day beer. Something to kick back and relax on a special occasion, like thanksgiving or christmas! A great beer for those that love chocolate/espresso and don't mind a beer that bites back."
"D. Average drinkability. It is pretty heavy and I couldn't see myself having many more than one at a sitting. Also the abv would get you if you had too many."
"Very, very good RIS...challenging the Stone RIS as my favorite ""everyday"" RIS.."
"D: Great beer that has a close to perfect balance."
"Defintely one of my top favorites and by far my favorite stout."
"i don't know if the beer is to blame. the keg seemed a bit older."
"O: Very drinkable. American masterpiece"
"Priceless"
"A truly excellent Stout. The flavor is exceptional. I am sincerely impressed with this one, and glad it is available year round. I love Stouts, and the funny thing is, I have seen it on the shelves many times and thought ""maybe next time",but I finally decided to try it and now I am a big fan. If you are in the mood for an awesome Stout, (regardless of price or availability)do yourself a favor and try Old Rasputin. You will be glad you did."
"D: For a 9% RIS this beer is the bomb for its ability to be consumed; God, I love this beer for its flavor, accessibility, and price; it doesn't get any better than this when you consider those three things."
"Poured nearly black with a small tan head that all but disappeared shortly. Not much lacing on the glass. Excellent aroma of caramel, chocolate and roasted malts. Taste has a lot of coffee and bitter chocolate coming through. Nicely carbonated and a nice creamy mouthfeel as well.Excellent RIS, especially for the price and availability. I've purchased this one many times and will continue to do so."
"Cant say enough about this beer. It is great in a bottle and stellar fresh on tap."
"12oz bottle pours a dark black with a decent amount of foam. Smells of dark malts/espresso coffee thats consistent in other imperial stouts. Taste is similiar and the right amount of thickness. Full bodied and packs solid flavour. Quite easy to drink as the abv% wasn't noticed at all. Glad I got to try this one, just wishing I grabbed a second bottle. Very nice stout."
"Notes: Great RIS, wish it was a little cheaper. Although I paid less for it than the ten fidy, and it is far superior to the ten fidy. I bought a single, I can get it cheaper in 4 packs. Will probably be doing that tomorrow night. I would definitely suggest trying this. I haven't tried any of the top ten RIS on here, but I would easily put it at the top of my list."
"Taste is sweet at first, and a slight burnt bitterness at finishing. I could not detect and alcohol burn whatsoever. It drinks supremely easy, thus beware it hits you at the end when you're at your third bottle."
"Forgot to write, if you ever get a chance to have this on Nitro...DO IT! Had it that way on Darkness Eve at Stub & Herbs it was awesome!"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is thick, creamy, the color of oil, and has a 3 in chocolate brown head that leaves stickiness all down the glass as you drink it down. The aroma is complex with sweet raisin, prune, some chocolate, and coffee. The taste is just as complex with a front of chocolate and coffee. There is a bitterness that follow this brew and the finish is smooth dark roasted chocolate. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than expected, but is smooth, even with the frothy head. This is more than exceptional, this is close to the standard that a Russian Imperial Stout should be."
"Drinkability:This thing was sipped and enjoyed thoroughly. Really good stout for the price. Great availability. This will definitely be a regular in my fridge."
"D - A hopped-up, nicely done RIS with plenty of flavor. A very good all around brew."
"D: Not sure I would call any RIS sessionable, but this one is great. Better price point than the Brooklyn BCS which I recently had, and I like this one much more to boot."
"Thanks for sharing Derek! Much appreciated. Opaque black, finger if mocha head. Minute lacing. Dark, bitter chocolate aroma profile, roasted coffee beans, anise, with a mild hop presence. Licorice, toffee chocolate, bitters, milky, smooth mouthfeel. High medium body, silky mouthfeel, with great balance. Highly drinkable. Thanks again Hyde!"
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a fantastic beer."
"There's alot of hype around barrel aged stouts right now. This showcases the fact that you can have a really well made, accessible, RIS without all the hype."
"A solid RIS. Its what a stout aspires to be."
"This is one of my favorites and I'm surprised I had never reviewed this one. You can't beat its great taste and a four pack usually runs around $7."
"D: Just dove in, but it really seems like something you could have two of for sure. Wouldn't suggest drinking more than probably two since the alcohol level is pretty high (9 or 10%)."
"12 oz bottle to glass. Looks like molasses, head is a foamy version of same. Really liked the nose, coffee meets juicy fruit, I thought that was the best part. Huge, rich flavors, coffee and chocolate, sweet, but carbonation seemed flat (although it still had a huge head several minutes in) and was unbalanced in the alcohol, just too much for the flavors to contain. Got tiresome to drink, sort of like work to get through this, although the overall power was impressive."
"D: Very drinkable beer even with the high abv as all the flavors and aromas blended very well for a really good beer. Adding the nitro-tap to it doesn't hurt either."
"Drinkability is tough to rate on this. It's delicious and you'll frequently find yourself sipping away on a glass of this, but it's heavy and full-bodied, so you're not exactly going to be chugging this or going back for seconds and thirds."
"Drinkability- very nice, I will definitely drink more of it."
"Easy to drink and interesting, not a style I have on a regular basis, but most enjoyable."
"Overall - Delicious, intensely flavored beer with an incredibly smooth mouthfeel."
"D - this a a wonderful brew! very satisfying and very well rounded. it's not too sweet, and not to bitter. thick enough and strong enough. it's a great, great beer and worthy of it's reputation. Cheers!"
"All in all an excellent benchmark RIS and will continue to find its way into my fridge."
"Pours pitch black with a decent tan head with some lacing. Nice big warm cocoa smell. It's taste has quite a bit of cocoa flavor to it with bittersweet malty taste and a slightly smokey finish. It has a nice big body and goes down smoothly. Enjoying this beer very much."
"(I did like this, but am in awe of its strength. This is one to respect, for sure. And enjoy, AND bless the beer-gods for.)"
"D: just an awesome pour. Very drinkable for all this beer packs."
"Excellent beer. Strong. As I noted, the 9% ABV is not well hidden, but it never takes away from the flavor. This is really good, quality beer."
"http://twitpic.com/nmkjz"
"Given the fact I paid something like two bucks for a bottle of this instead of $6-10 for most other imperial stouts it is hard to find a leg to genuinely criticize the beer. It is good product for a more ""every day"" imperial stout. If I absolutely crave an imperial stout I could go for one of these, but it is not something I reach for much."
"= one thing i've always loved about Old Raspy is the creamy sour milk and chocolate taste, without the soy sauce taste ubiquitous in many RIS. sometimes i love the soy sauce taste (see Sam Adams Imperial) and sometimes i don't. Old Raspy has a great blend of flavors without overdoing it."
"Pours pitch black oil colored with a nice dark tan, creamy two fingered head. Head starts to fizz out right away but not extremely quickly. I would say it has medium retention and creaminess. Leaves nice thick lacing on my glass. Smells of nice dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate with a nice sweetness (oatmeal?) overlapping it all. The alcohol bite to the nose only adds to this great balance of smell, a nice strong one too. Tastes mainly of dark roasted malts, sweets and chocolate. There is an alcohol bite here that grows enormously as the beer warms up. It started out balanced in but becomes a tiny bit off-balance over time. This does not ruin the taste at all, still a great dose of roasted malts in here. Mouthfeel here is nice and thick, creamy with perfect carbonation for the taste. The alcohol warming does not really take over this beer. Very nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is great here, good taste, great price for an RIS, the alcohol might get to be a bit too much after a while but I will continue to buy this and it is so worth it for the quality of this beer."
"Had this on nitro at Novare Res in Portland, ME, poured into a 16oz shaker pint. A very tight one finger head the color of coffee ice cream on top of a pitch black body, the head dies verry slowly down to a half finger and remains, the lacing left behind throughout is more like sheeting. The nose is of sweet toffee, roasty malt, and cocoa powder. The flavor is more fo the same, with a nice touch of espresso, a raisiny sweetness, followed by a bitter cocoa/espresso finish, there is also a hint of earth in there somewhere. The mouthfeel is superb, very creamy, nice and thick but not syrupy, very smooth. Drinkability is great for what this is, by no means a session beer but it is not intended to be, a perfect dessert beer."
"This beer is a real powder keg, a cascade of flavour. Tasting it is a bit like being punched in the face, without the pain of course. There are many lovely roasted tones, and a great deal of strong coffee and dark chocolate in the flavour. I feel that this is really the way an excellent Imperial Stout should taste like. Despite the flavour, it is rather easy to quaff this brew, and it is really the quintessential beer to kick back and relax with, especially during a cold winter day when the darkness outside reflects the colour in your glass."
"Old Rasputin is definitely Ol' Reliable for the RIS style. Covers all aspects of the style and very tasty. I'm pretty anxious to try the XII and see how much more can be added to an already great stout."
"D-- Very bueno. One of the best RIS's I have ever had. Very drinkable and 2 is easily drinkable."
"Drinkability is very good! It goes down quite smooth and has a wonderful taste. I could have several of these but I think it be better enjoyed one at a time. This is the best RIS I have had so far. Just wonderful!"
"Drinkability- Looses points in this category because of its heaviness. Good news: high abv means you wouldn't want to be knocking these back all night."
"However, I still find it to be a very nice beer. Nice roastiness without tasting too burnt...not enough body to really make me happy but at least its not thin....awesome drinkability for a 9% beer. This is a beer that is perfect for beginners and still very good for veterans."
"D: I personally find this to be one of the more drinkable beers in the RIS style, but that doesn't make it a beer you're going to drink 6 of. A great beer and I've decided to finally put some away to age, even though I love it fresh."
"Old Rasputin is about as drinkable as a Russian Imperial Stout gets; its bold flavors are always enjoyable, particularly on colder days."
"The feel of this beer is pretty light for a heavy dark beer. A good drinking beer that goes down really well."
"This is not a sipping beer for experienced RIS drinkers. Its relative light body and minimal bitterness make for a remarkably sessionable Imperial Stout. There is an associated danger with this brew however, that 9% ABV is not a joke."
"Holy Crap. This is black as night. I am no expert on finding the little nuances, so I can only tell you my first instincts. But it is big and smoky. Dark chocolate hits the pallat. Very smooth taste in the middle, but the surrounding flavor is very thick and rocky if that makes any sense. The picture of Rasputin on the bottle seems to be laughing at me, daring me to take another sip. I like it."
"This is a standby for a lot of folks including myself. When I want an RIS and want to spend $2, Old Raspy is there, like a non-pretentious gradeschool friend. Black pour, small/medium head, some lacing, and the nose is roasted malts and coffee. The flavor is much more of the same with espresso dominating. On nitro tap the punch is relaxed and the mouthfeel is foamy goodness."
"I think this one is about 6 months old. Not aged much but still better now than when I got it 6 months ago. Would love to try this after 2-3 years. I think this is a good gateway brew for getting into RIS."
"D: at 7.99 a 4pk, this is one of the more affordable imperial stouts (which happens to be my favorite style) so I find myself with this in the fridge quite often. I normally only have one in an evening as it is a very hearty brew, but I never have problem drinking it."
"D: In spite of the abv, I could really get into this one. If you like Russian Imperial Stouts, you should definitely give this a try...you won't be disappointed."
"D- The alcohol peaks through a little too much for my liking but I still enjoyed this beer. Also it is pretty strong so I wouldn't have more than 1 in a sitting."
"Cheers!"
"D - Is this beer really 9%? Dammit, that must be why this is such a glowing review."
"A good, big beer, this is made for sipping slowly. I've found it pairs quite nicely with warm, homemade chocolate chip cookies."
"D- really good RIS. has a lot of flavors for a stout. very enjoyable"
"finally got hold of another great beer, they are hard to come by where i live."
"D: Unlike other of this style, the alcohol content is masked very well making this easier to drink more of. The complexity of flavours are perfectly balanced creating a solid beer."
"Enjoy!!!!"
"The drinkability is pretty good, about as good as can be expected from such a big beer. Very nice."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer, but I have had far better RIS. This one seems to be a syrupy mess. I will easily get this again because it is decent and the price is low."
"D. This one goes down smooth. Old Rasputin is a full rich beer, so im not sure I would want more than one in a sitting. That being said it is definitely one to keep coming back to. I would say that this is one of the best examples of the style."
"so drinkable not too heavy for as full and flavorful as it is."
"Old Rasputin...In my circle the name says it all. Nice thick, black/brown body with about every shade of brown visible in the head. A large head emerges after the pour smelling of roasted malt, espresso, milk chocolate and dark chocolate and vanilla bean. As the head fizzles slowly, thick chunks of milk chocolate mousse lace appear at the sides of the glass and craters are formed at the zenith. The taste is magnificent: graham cracker, molasses, espresso, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, hot fudge syrup and light toffee. All flavors complement the roasty black malt backbone. Very thick and chewy as a top notch RIS should be. Luxurious mouthfeel. Very invigorating as it fulfills all expectations. Simply put, still the RIS all others are judged by."
"I enjoyed this beer in a mug at a slightly chilled temperate, maybe about 58 degrees."
"D: Very drinkable and the evolution of this brew warrants a second go around."
"Bottle version is my least favorite but, having said that, I'll drink the bottle version any time! Very nice beer!"
"The smell was intense and dark, but inviting. I would like to try this out of a bottle rather than from a tap to see if there is a noticeable difference in taste. Worth trying if you enjoy stouts."
"D- For a darker beer it has a lot going on, could very well be sessionable but at 9%abv, watch out"
"Very strong earthy flavor that goes down very smooth. Very little lingering burnt aftertaste which makes this beer very drinkable. I really enjoyed drinking this beer for the first time."
"D - Could drink this over and over as is a really nice stout not to turn down !"
"One of the most drinkable Russian imperial stouts out there. Despite having a high ABV %, the alcohol is unnoticeable. The roastedness never detracts from the drinkability. With a lot of different flavors coming out from cold to room temperature, this beer is a sipper."
"Pours like motor oil with a light-tan head. It goes away fairly quickly but there's a decent amount of lace for a higher ABV beer. Aromas of roasted coffee and the darkest chocolate imaginable. Very pleasant but not as aromatic as it could have been. There's a ton of depth in the flavor with the roasted notes taking the forefront. The coffee/bittersweet chocolate flavor starts with a dark cherry fruit flavor peaking through in the middle. It was very subtle but it was there. The finish came on nicely with a roasted coffee bitterness. Nice, chewy mouthfeel that made me feel like there was ground up coffee and cocoa powder floating in the beer. One of the most delicious stouts I've had to date. A definite must try and something I'll drink again."
"One of the best RISs around."
"D: Damn...this is really incredible. An amazing beer, and available all year long. If you haven't tried it...what's taking so long?!"
"Rich, bold and delicious, am I wrong in still being a bit underwhelmed? This is a fine beer, but considering its following and the hype surrounding it, I was expecting something completely mind-blowing, which I did not quite get. What I did find was an all around tasty, drinkable stout that I will gladly keep around as a dependable standby now that I've figured out where to find it in my area."
"Exceptional drinkability for a RIS, not 100% sessionable, but complex enough to make it a 5.0 if you pace yourself and respect this big bold brew!"
"Totally worth all the hype that this beer gets. This Russian Imperial Stout is a must try. Very dark in color, almost black smells of dark chocolate. Has a slight hop bitterness to as well. Very drinkable even though the 9% abv. A very good beer to sip and appreciate"
"Heavy, silky mouthfeel. Definitely a sipper. Low carbonation and smooth finish, leaving just enough flavor in the mouth. Very drinkable, even with the high ABV. Delicious!"
"Drinkability: Its quite drinkable. For having 9% abv this one goes down smooth, I don't know if I would session with this beast, but it's definitely tasty. It would be interesting to try with café food."
"Overall: A very rich and complex RIS that is extremely balanced and would be a great brew to accompany dessert, maybe even replace it. Throw on a little whip cream and you have a highly enjoyable adult 'cremé de putin'"
"This got poured from a 12oz. bottle and the head is great, sticks around forever. Black as night and a pretty good aroma. It has alot of chocolate, malt and alcohol. Drinks easy but two or three is enough... maybe. All in all this is a good beer for any time of the year."
"d: i'm not sure where i've been hiding all this time, but this is a superbly drinkable stout that i will get my hands on as much as possible. highly recommended, sout lovers hit the jackpot with this one!"
"Good foamy mouthfeel, and decent drinkability except for the ABV. Like I said, decent stout."
"A pretty stellar RIS, the chocolate, malt, fruit, and booze all playing nice like there was no revolution in sight, just yer typical drunken dalliances with the tsarina. Oh yes, old Grigori would indeed be proud."
"D-For a big beer, it is surprisingly drinkable."
"Overall, a great, rich, complex, balanced RIS. A classic in my book."
"MD: Great drinkability for a RIS at 9%. nice smoothness to it, which makes the mouthfeel great."
"D- Very strong and bitter but very drinkable!! One really good beer that I would definitely recommend!"
"Overall: A very delicious and creamy beverage. A real special find."
"Pours a solid black with a huge fluffy tan head that sticks around forever. Smells of roasted malt dark fruits chocolate, toffee, and a touch of alcohol. Spicy earthy hop in the aroma as well. Taste is heavy coffee, espresso, chocolate, and dark fruits. Leaves a slight ash and slight alcohol in the finish along with a lingering roasted bitterness. Medium to thick body and finishes a bit dry for my taste. Creamy smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation. This one tastes and smells great, but I found it to be a little light in body. 9% alcohol is well hidden and this is a dangerously drinkable stout."
"Nice big stout without being fancy."
"This stout will def. be a welcomed edition into my beer fridge."
"I can, and will again, drink this all night"
"Mouthfeel is full, smooth, and creamy."
"Served in a tulip. Poured one shade shy of black with a quarter inch tan-colored head that dissipates into a skim with a solid band around the edges. Nose was very mild and subdued - some malt, some brown sugar and a hint of hops. Taste reveals chocolate malt, brown sugar, molasses, black licorice and a definite hops presence. Mouthfeel was just shy of medium-bodied, but a bit too much carbonation for the style - I like my RIS's lightly carbonated and oily/viscous. Alcohol is well-hidden on this beer, but a little too much hops in the mix for my liking. Nonetheless, a solid, readily available offering."
"Thumbs up."
"D - Average-plus for the style."
"D: With such intense flavor, it might be a little too much for sessioning, but I'd still give it a try ;-)"
"Due to the overwhelming hops flavors and bitterness the drinkability was relativily poor."
"Quite a drinkable RIS, however I would prefer a little more boldness in the flavor."
"I remember having the first of the 6-pack of this over 6 months ago and it was a bit harsh at the time, but I believe it has improved some with age. I believe this bottle, the last, was roughly 1 year old. Highly recommended! Even the burps I get from this are appetizing."
"Definitely one you'd like to sip and savor. Full bodied and thick, but not chewy."
"First there is a sweet taste of roasted malts and a creamy flavor...and if I'm not crazy a bit of hop bitterness lingers along with it. Just after the initial hit I get a fruity base of plums and maybe cherries. The entire profile is really well balanced and complex, in addition to being just really damn tasty. I still feel like there is a RIS out there I might like more for one reason or another but until then this is great. The mouth feel is full and just right. Also, I tasted little alcohol in this, which is an awesome benefit to such a great tasting beer."
"J"
"Jet black with a thick tan head that last all the way to the bottom of the glass. Hints of coffee and carmelized malts in the aroma. The flavor is much of the same, with a toffee upper pallate middle. The alcohol is noticeable, but well balanced. On the sweet side, but not as much as, say Lefthand Milk Stout. There's a big mouthfeel to this one. Toasty, coffee and dark chocolate finish in the back and upper palatte. Of the 70 beers I've review thus far, this is the closest I've had to perfect."
"Drinkability: Upon the first few sips, I did not care for this one and I felt the alcohol was too noticeable. However, as I finished my glass, this grew on me with each passing drink and now, I'm a fan."
"Overall, a great beer with complex roasted malts and a hop bitterness, i really enjoyed this beer. Definitely gonna enjoy one of these come colder winter time."
"Drinkability: A sipper. If it were less astringent, it would be much more drinkable."
"Overall, this beer is the hop-lovers stout. I'm not saying it's all hops. This is a true Russian Imperial! It just announces its U.S. roots with the delicious hop textures."
"An excellent brew! I highly recommend it especially for a later in the evening drink. Something I would stock up a bit on for the winter."
"D - very heavy. Having just one of these to sip is good enough for me. The astringent cherry taste can be a bit strong at times and can carry into the finish."
"Smell and taste are similar, but taste is a bit stronger. There is a very malty coffee up front, some tobacco, and a hint of bitter chocolate. Some slight dark fruit as well. Mouthfeel is good as well, medium to heavy body. Goes down much smoother than any other RIS I have had."
"D - Well brewed RIS w/ nitro usage I actually enjoyed. I am not normally a fan of the Nitro, but in this stout it is fantastic, Old Rasputin is a top -notch ale any way you cut it."
"Drink: The strong alcohol content and flavor keeps this from being any more than a sip and enjoy."
"Definitely a keeper."
"Drinkability: Very little in the way of flaws make this a great example of what I believe an Imperial Stout should taste like."
"This is a standby for good reason."
"D: this one definitely lived up to the hype. Complex and befitting of the RIS style I can't wait to have another."
"I love the label with depiction of Rasputin and transliterated Russian text. Makes me think of snow and winter."
"D: Very good taste, very doable, but the abv limits its true drinkability. But for the style, very good."
"one of the best RIS's, and one of the best stouts overall."
"Pours out quite thick, though not as close to motor oil as some recent imperial stouts I've seen. Hints of ruby red peek from around the edges of my glass, and the darkish tan head is light a frothy, lasting well but leaving little lacing. Nose is obviously well-hopped, with citrus and fruit notes hovering over the menacingly dark chocolate. Treacle and plum sit in the mix as well, fabulously complex and alluring. Taste is a minor step back, as the hops step forward and the vinous character takes a distinct back seat to the slam of coffee and chocolate. Still there is a nice note of tobacco in the mix, which keeps it lively and interesting. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, not overpowering though, and drinkability is solid. Very good stout, has everything you're looking for without necessarily being at the very top rank in its category."
"smells like a chocolate expresso. Lots of coco, roasted malt, coffee. main up front aroma is the chocolate though. tastes very roasted coffee malts. full bodied, very creamy and chewey. Almost like a coffee chocolate milk shake. very rich and enjoyable. giving stone IRS a run for its money, but i think stone still has the lead in my heart."
"D- Wow, drank half a glass...great sipping beer, dark and whicked...in a great way...deep and balanced...very very nice beer. Drinkable if you are going to have 1..."
"D - Goes down pretty easily, but couldn't do a whole lot of these."
"Not much else can be said for this beer. For my own purposes thogh here's what I think. Poured into an imperial pint glass it's dark brown nearly black in color. The head is about 1 inch thick that is tan in color. The aroma is chocolate and coffee. Roast malt with a fresh baked preztle hint to it. The flavor is a delicious blend of coffee and chocolate. Hints of bready malt shine through as well. A moderate hop bite sneaks in at the end. I feel it has a medium body to full body that never feels heavy considering the style. This is one of the most drinkable RIS I've ever had. It's not cloyingly sweet or thick and syrupy like this style tends to lean towards. I could see downing a few of these. Although the higher ABV might have a thing to say in my descision."
"This is a freaking stellar RIS. Big coffee presence that finishes with a bitter dark chocolate twang. There is absolutely nothing harsh about this. The roasted characteristics are mellow and very subtle. This is one of the most drinkable big dark beers I've ever had. I will make sure this is most always in my fridge from here on out. Great beer."
"This may be, for all its amazing qualities, the least drinkable great beer. The flavor is so intense and sharp that drinking it is truly a chore. It is the difference for me between Old Rasputin being the finest beer I have had in my life, to it being a great beer that I rarely find myself purchasing."
"Ok, this brew has awesome atmosphere. Beautiful dark brown pour, with a nice little foamy head. Nose is full, complex, and very pleasing. A real treasure trove of components. Flavor is likewise full and pleasing, although more simple. Nice balance though. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"I love this beer."
"poured into a snifter,pitch black with a nice tan head.nose is dark fruit,roasted coffee,a bit of earthiness,slight alcohol,and dark chocolate.taste is very similar to the nose,with up front bitter chocolate,a bit of carmelized sugar,coffee,and more dark chocolate and slight warming alcohol in the finish.mouthfeel is ever so slightly thin in comparison to other RIS i've had, but this is still very good."
"Taste is fantastic. Goes down very easy, despite its being 9%abv, and the chocolate undertones and rich grains really make this one a treat. The coffee infusion is present in the aftertaste. It's a cult classic for a reason and remains one of the best RIS' of all time."
"Drinkability - Don't think I could have more than two of these in a sitting but at 9% abv that should create a quite nice feeling for me. Overall quite drinkable and again, not a session beer but I can't wait to enjoy this when the California nights turn a bit colder during fall. For now I have to settle for the summer heat outside."
"Drinkability: average for the style"
"D - Fantastic RIS indeed, and especially smooth and drinkable on nitro. Yum! Subtle yet complex in all of its delicious, velvety smooth glory."
"Thick syrupy mouthfeel, not as potent as abyss or dark lord, but it's up there. A good slow sipper of a beer."
"I look forward to exploring other RIS's and Double Stouts. Till we meet again, Ol' Rasputin..."
"great beer over all, perfect to pair with dinner, or just count as a dinner. At 9 abv it does the trick, even me a semi experienced beer man was feeling it after just one. bought at a rays supermarket in bend oregon for only 1.80 bottle which I was pretty happy with. Definately worth the money, and will buy again."
"This is a remarkable beer. Perfect for after dinner. Leave room though, this one is kinda filling. Very satisfying."
"Now you know why it says never die on the box."
"This is truly a great stout, one of the best IMHO...if you like a strong heavy stout."
" I would, and do, drink this beer often. This is by far the best stout available in Hawaii!"
"D: Rather quaffable considering the ABV and body. This is definitely one to age, considering the sharp hoppiness when it's young."
"Final thoughts: This is one, if not the most, favorite stout of mine. I love how rich, thick and dark it is. Some hop character and chocolate as well as fruits like fig and banana. It's really complex, an experience in itself."
"D- Moderate to moderately high, filling, but oh so good. One of my more memorable beers. Nitro and Old Raspy are like peanut butter and jelly."
"Drinkability: Simply put, this is just an outstanding RIS. In these times of super rare, over-hyped beers, I almost forget about great beers like this. It's relatively easy to find and the price for a four pack is a steal. I've been drinking this beer for years and plan on drinking it for many more years to come. A classic; don't just buy a single, you're going to want more. Cheers!"
"It's a silky, magnificent brew that always delights the senses and never offends. It's not a beer you could drink one after the other, but it's one that is always worth having in the fridge. Old Rasputin is in a word, essential."
"Drinkability: One of the easiest drinking imperial stouts I've ever had. Very smooth and tasty with no single flavor dominating the other. I will absolutely pick myself up some more of this."
"The body is wonderfully full, smooth, textured and coats the tongue like a well-worn jacket. Easily drinkable, this is one of the big stouts I have several of in a row. Truly a world-class brew, if this is not available locally it's certainly worth much effort to obtain it by whatever means at your disposal."
"Notes: Seek out the nitro-tap for a full experience."
"Like all RIS, this is not meant for quaffing or casual imbibing but rather to be sipped and savoured. This is a very good example of the style and in league with the big boys. A must try."
"This is a fine beer. Pretty good, but not doing anything special for me. Quite disappointed with the body. Otherwise, it's a very good bang for your buck, but it's not the worst idea to spend a few more bucks."
"Tried this one a few times and I like it a lot. Not as great as some say it is but a very good imperial stout. I'm not sure what the difference between a Russian Imperial Stout and and American Imperial stout is (I think american has more hops) but this is one you should get if you can find it. Also, comes in 12oz bottles so if you don't like it you don't have as much to worry about."
"This a damn fine Russian Imperial Stout - one of the finest I have had. A drinkable, delicious tasting brew. The alcohol presence is there but is blended rather nicely. Very nice brew - a sipper and savor brew, not a session type. Damn fine."
"Drinkability - good for a beer this big, but not something you'd want more than one (or possibly two) of in a sitting."
"D: Good beer, not exceptional. I had one and it certainly didn't stand on it's own."
"D - as stated previously, this is my first RIS. I think I could go for another 12 oz. before it's time to switch it up. that said, this is definately a sipper, and a damn good one at that!"
"Flavors of bitter chocolate and roasted grains hit me first. I took the first sip cold, but as this beer warms it develops nicely, losing some of the bitterness over time. The smell develops as it warms, too. From now on I will cool this beer to just under room temperature and end it."
"It gets to you quick, through, and you'll know you've been struck by this dark-souled russian when you least expect it. not a session beer, not a kind-tasting belgian, this beer is a monster you'll find yourself hunting down again and again."
"A fantastic RIS. One that will surely find its way into my fridge on many occasions because of its wonderful flavors and supremely reasonable price point ($7.99 for a 4pk)."
"Poured out darkly with a small, tan head that didn't last long (which is OK by me). I only got mild coffee aromas out of it. The taste was nice, strong coffee, but not overpowering. Ranks right up there with Speedway stout, but for different reasons. Heavy, oily feel; great for a stout. Warmed up nicely and I got a nutty chocolate flavor at the end that was worth waiting for. Next time, I'll serve this a bit warmer."
"D- Pretty good overall and definitely worth the money. Cheap and easily accessible RIS with a nice flavor."
"d: average for a RIS, it's not cloying or too hot, but way over bitter. Aging would do this beer wonders."
"D: For being such a full-bodied, full-flavored brew, they go down pretty easy. A great RIS."
"Bottle Pours a good black with a creamy lasting light brown head. The head produces great lacing. Has a great aroma of chocolate, mocha, coffee and hints of alcohol. Has a good carbonation. The flavors are excellent. Very well blended and the alcohol is well hidden. Nice mix of sweet chocolate and tart coffee. Has a thick texture. A bold solid finish with a real good aftertaste. Had this one on vacation and it is awesome."
"In my mind this is the premier American version of this style. Anyone who can suggest a good rival, please let me know."
"A little bitter for me, but those who love hops will love this one"
"Fairly common and widely available, this is one that almost anybody can enjoy. There are better Imperial Stouts available, but this is always a solid performer and well worth the money. Highly recommended."
"Having this beer fresh on tap makes a world of difference. The hops were still a bit alive and the interplay between bitter and sweet was great. The sweet maltiness came through with hints of chocolate, caramel and coffee. There is a pleasing viscous thickness to this beer like molasses that really adds to the sweetness of the malts. Very drinkable. Appearance is jet black with a dark brown head that quickly dissipates. Definitely must have again."
"This is one exceptional beer. Being a newcomer to ""better beer"" I'm just now finding Russian Imperial Stouts. Of the stouts I've tried this has to be the best. It pours thick and black. The taste is incredible. The mouth feel is very light and smooth, but this is one drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: For the style, it's up there. Much, much more drinkable as far as having more than one goes, and I could certainly enjoy more than one of these in a row, and for this style, that's saying something. Lighter than the Stone Imperial Stout and the BBXXI as far as dark and complex brews go, but this does improve the drinkability as well as it goes down much more smoothly and drinks like a champ."
"D - Not as ""dessert beer"" sweet as many other attempts at the style, which is a refreshing change. Very enjoyable and definitely a beer I'd have again from time to time."
"Although I neglected to review it then, this was delicious fresh. It strikes me as a bit softer and fruitier with a year of cellaring on it and is still quite a delicious RIS."
"D: Goes down as easily as such a weighty beer can."
"Drinkability: I love this beer but its best had as a dessert perhaps with chocolate or ice cream."
"A very fine stout."
"Mouthfeel: Thinner than what I usually like from imperial stouts, but it helps the beer to go down smooth."
"This is not what I was expecting in a stout. I never thought it would be this hoppy, this is kind of like a stout for someone that likes IPAs. It has the bitterness of the IPA and the thickness of a stout. This is not my style of beer. I really don't see myself going for another one of these. It's not a bad beer, just not to my tastes."
"It's tasty for sure. This is definitely what I like in an imperial stout. It's hard to go wrong with this. The drinkability will suffer a bit due to the high ABV and the aforementioned astringency, but it shines overall."
"D - Very drinkable for the ABVs and not too overpowering."
"Drinkablilty: It gets a perfect mark from me because its an excellent RIS, but its value is incredible, and its available at my grocery store in Virginia."
"D- I don't think I could drink more than one of these, but I do think I may buy some more."
"Solid imperial stout, but I'm going out on a limb to say it's a bit overrated, especially given this site's adoration for the RIS style."
"Drinkability: This is an outstanding beer but it's like rich chocolate, you can only handle so much at one time. I'm sure I could manage to hold quite a bit though if I put my mind to it."
"Very very easy to drink. A top-notch RIS!!"
"Good drinkability a hardy beer but gentle and not overly boozy. Definitely a bargain for the quality. This is a beer that will remain a staple in my fridge."
"Drinkability: Dangerous. I could drink it all night. I would not drink this on a farm."
"O. My go to Stout. The nitrification at the brewery enhances the amazingness of this beer."
"Drinkability- This one was pretty strong. Good stuff, but this is definitely an occasional beer for me."
"Looks like motor oil. Tastes like something chard. Doesn't give off as strong of an alcohol smell as it should. Slides down smooth with a little carbonation bite at the end. Not a session beer but those usually aren't as fun. A must try for any stout fan."
" very difficult to stop."
"At 9% I wouldn't WANT to drink a lot of these in one sitting, but it's good enough to."
"Drinkability: Goes down smooth, tiny tight nitrogen bubbles help make this very much not filling."
"D- One of the best ever! A classic and well worth the praise."
"D - The 9% ABV is not all that apparent as you're drinking. As tempting as it was to have more than one, this is not really a session beer and I moved on to something slightly less robust."
"D- Pretty high for a RIS. I think the alcohol would catch up to me after a few of these."
"The taste is simlar, rich fermented prunes and currants stewed with bvlackstrap molasses, along with dark toast, dark chocolate, singed leaves, peppery-anise spice. It has solid sweetness but it's not too sweet or thick and has just enough spicey bitterness and alcoholic spicey warmh to balance, with lingering, mellow spicey bitterness. The alcohol is noticeable but smooth."
"Drinkability- You wouldnt know it was 9% unless you read the label. Alcohol is hidden very well. This is very rich and definately a slow sipping beer. Left me wanting another!"
"Taste is a touch more bitter than I like in the style. It's got a bit of a sting to it, and the bitter sticks around longer than the aforementioned sweet caramel malt and other swirling accompanying flavors. Most prominent note is something like roasted espresso beans. It's tasty, but not what I'd hold up as an exemplar of the style. If you like your sweet paired with bitter, though, it might be just for you."
"D - One a night for me is enough! Great beer!"
"Drinkability: Delicious. Won't become part of my everyday rotation but I'll definitely have again!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours pitch black with a one finger light tan head. The head stays around for quite some time and leaves some lacing down the glass. Smells faintly of coffee, roasted malts, smells pretty good. Taste is good. Roasted malts hit first followed by chocolate and ends with a mellow coffee taste and an aftertaste of coffee. For a decently high ABV beer this one hides the alcohol pretty good. Easily drinkable. A really great RIS, not the best I've had but I still enjoy it a lot."
"It's near-perfect. Wouldn't have it with a meal because I would lose interest in my food."
"Overall, one of the best stouts I have ever had. Rasputin knows how t do it because the alcohol is very well disguised but tis is some great beer to sip on at night and put you to a peaceful slumber"
"- Super good, and super drinkable... flavor digs into the tongue and doesn't let go for awhile... overall one of the most drinkable RIS's I have tried."
"Overall, I have to say that I really liked this beer. Worthy of the hype, especially for the price. I think I'll be stopping by for another couple 4-packs."
"Drinkability - Highly drinkable and highly recommended."
"This is a great RIS. Not too complex, and thoroughly forthcoming. Smooth as silk."
"I opened the bottle and immediately was greeted by a wonderful smell of bread and alcohol. I poured the beer into a glass. There was a lot of head (around 3 fingers). The beer was very thick and dark. When I held it up to the light, not much passed through. The head foam was very stiff. The beer had a high enough viscosity to cling to the sides of the glass when swirled a bit. The initial taste had hints of sweet fruitiness, but was quickly replaced with a nice strong bitter taste of malt. There was a hint of an aftertaste that I could do without. Overall, the stout was very drinkable. This is one of the thickest, darkest stouts I have ever seen. I liked the style of the label as well."
"This is an extremely unique beer and a real treat. The higher than normal ABV means you probably can't drink a whole bunch, but man is it worth finding and trying. This is one full bodied and tasty beer."
"this is probably one of favorite beers that is produced though out the year and is available almost any where in the country"
"mouthfeel and drinkability are superb. much smoother and thin than other russian imperial stouts. incomparable to other commercially availabe beers of the style."
"Pours a solid black color with a brown head that forms very good and needs no help. Aroma is strong for a dark stout with chocolate and coffe back ground which I would have to attribute to the great head formation and carbonation. Taste was great and was not over bearing but was a an excellent RIS for me with out the prominent coffe flavor. Chocolate, dark fruits, and roasted coffe and malts power this brews flavor for me. Coffee came was in the background for me. Everything is very balanced and the Alcohol is well hidden and may sneak up on you with out noticing. I have to say that the carbonation is very strong and almost a bit to strong. Excellent brew and will continue to purchase."
"Drinkability is still high."
"D- This has to be as drinkable as any 9% RIS can be. It's a sipper, but is delightful."
"D- A really drinkable stout. Great all around beer."
"D= great brew. Could be a littlesmoother really great overall though sort of reminds me of why I started drinking good beer."
"Close to two finger head on the pour, rich brown color, dissipates into a thin layer across the surface but the lacing is super-sticky and longlasting. Easily reaches blackness in color, no real change in hue to be found, opaque, like duh. Bitter chocolate and coffee bean, nuts and cherry, plum fruit fill up the nose, has a distinct mineral and grass element to it which gives it an erect bearing, overall roasted feel gives it lift and an agreeable verve. Medium to full-bodied, prickly carbonation disperses the weight nicely. Black licorice, dark chocolate, coffee bean and brazil nuts give it some breadth. The hops give it a sour twist and slight grain, straw flavoring, floral at turns. Carbonation also brings out a little minerally edge. Has more of a cleansing feel than you'll find in most RIPs. Not pushy through the finish, a decided good thing."
"drinkability: One of the top imperial stouts out there. Loved and will drink again"
"Drinkability is remarkable for a beer of such strength. The roasted flavours dominate but are a hallmark of the style. It's a creamy, chocolatey melange that pleases me to no end. A very nice treat to cap off a night."
"Overall, a really good but not outstanding RIS. Not sure if I got a bad sample so will try again to be sure. Do give high recommend. Need to resample to set the rotation but unless better it would only be an occasional and that would mainly be since it's one of the few good RIS that I can get here in 12oz bottles."
"D - Good beer that deserves time for sipping and warming for nuances to be pulled out. Hard drinkability but a very good sipper."
"It would be hard to drink a lot of this at one sitting due to the strength, but this is another of what I have termed a reward beer. Too good to just drink casually ,this one is one to savor and enjoy as a special treat."
"Pours a deep black, but light still comes through in the edges as a translucent brown. I like my RIS to be pitch black :) Smells of toffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and a hint of bacon grease. Taste is superb, super heavy in roasty notes and chocolate mocha. Feels thick and full, drinkability is high."
"Drinkability - Yes."
"overall solid ris that is priced right and i hope it says that way"
"This is one hell of an impressive brew!"
"Pours absolutely midnight black with a one inch mocha head that moderately dissipates into a thin layer around glass. The Aroma is filled with dark chocolate and roasted malts with some light coffee scent in there as well. The flavor has an upfront roastiness with some chocolate and some dried fruits has the flavors linger and ends with a nice bitterness. This is a heavy bodied beer that coats your mouth with every sip. Every time I get the chance to have this beer its always a good night."
"top notch...one of the best..."
"D - Robust and absolutely delicious; great for sipping. I would serve it alongside something equally hearty, like steak, beef stew, pot roast or venison."
"D - This is an excellent beer, but extremely flavorful, and at 9% drinking more than one or two a night may not be the best idea. On the other hand...."
"D- Drinks excellent for an RIS like this."
"More chocolate on the tongue and with a long lingering roasted malt finish, including a nice freshly grated chocolate texture. Medium bodied in the feel and has a slightly slick finish, though smoother than from the bottle. High carbonation of the bottle isn't present here, allowing for a smoother feel and better retention of the nitro induced carbonation."
"12oz bottle. Almost black, dark brown with a scant brown head. Aroma has powerful licorice and roasted malts. The flavor is big and roasty with coffee bitterness; quite dry in the finish, and the hops blend in and don't overwhelm the balance. Full palate with fizzy carbonation. Very drinkable for an imperial, but intense and rich, dry and bitter. Goes nicely with chocolate desserts. (3.8) Rerate: This is damn good on tap. More dark chocolate and less hop bitterness, though still balanced nicely and very drinkable."
"Feels nice and smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down nice and easy without a hint of alcohol."
"Pours a nice bold head which retained well. The midnight black appearance is just what I had expected in a stout. The nose has hints of chocolate, espresso , and blackberry. This is such a smooth stout. Has a nice creamy texture to it. It tastes as it smells, rich chocolate and coffee notes. Sweet in the front, smooth on the way down with a ever so slight bitter finish. I advise everyone to try this one. Will become a regular on my shelf. This is a don't miss brew."
"drinkability - Nice drinking beer , recommend a try."
"D=very good and very drinkable, easily have more than 2 at a session."
"Mouthfeel is as smooth as Belgian chocolate. I am amazed that the ABV is as high as it is, yet it has such a smooth character and good drinkability for this type. I usually refer to this group as the beers that eat like a meal, but Old Rasputin like its namesake could give advice on how to make a fine Russian Imperial Stout. Well done!"
"Flavor is superb, especially when you realize this isn't a super-heavy imperial stout. Lots bittersweet chocolate, roast, and hints of tanginess and wood. Deliciously malty with a well-balanced sweetness. Dark fruit. Mouthfeel is very smooth, not nearly as heavy as some imperial stouts. Carbonation is perfect, medium low. One of the most drinkable imperial stouts I've ever had, and Rasputin doesn't even skimp on the flavor."
"D: Alcohol hidden very well. Watch out it will sneak up on you. Super smooth, ultra drinkable RIS."
"D- Took me a bit to come around on this one but now that I have I must admit it is quite the tasty RIS. The key I believe is to get this one up to at least 50 degrees before drinking it. The flavors really start to pop once it gets warmer."
"3.5 D: Not my favorite RIS, but worth a drink."
"D: Pretty drinkable. A very, very good introduction to the style, and one I plan on offering to many other beginners."
"Notes: Significantly less creamy than the nitro-tap experience I've gotten used to lately. A great beer, but seriously bitter and drier feeling in the bottle."
"Pours very dark, but still I can see some ruby hints around the edges, may be lighter/different in color than the average RIS. The head is kind of thin (<1cm) and dense, which leaves bits of lacing down as I drink. The smell is filled with sweetness, but deep in there are dried fruits (maybe from some esters or the black patent), the roasted barley - coffee type smell, and a light nose of chocolate. I can imagine a better smell, in terms of complexity, this one is about normal, but because its so intense, the smell is very much more inviting. The taste is very complex, and includes all of the usual suspects. The first sip has this dark, overripe plum taste, almost a hint of slick dark tartness, but with a pleasant sweetness. Then comes the coffee flavor, just flavor - no bitterness, and the sweetness still lingers, up until the last bite of chocolate. A roastiness fills as it goes down, again with the dried fruits, but overall pleasant. The mouthfeel is nice, pretty full, but kind of slick, this one fits the bill in terms out mouthfeel, but isn't a standout. An easy drinker for sure, I mean, you have to sip, but easy, good for the style. Recommended for an easily accessible RIS."
"I can imagine cellaring this beer and it will only grow. Some bottle time on this would be nice."
"Pours a four finger light brown head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Totally black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Roasted coffee nose. Flavor is nearly sweet coffee, with a burnt coffee finish, not bad but not enough beef for a RIS. $2.50 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"D. Quite a good beer, due to the overbearing (In a good way) style not one I'd drink more than one or two. Would recommend to anyone as a very good beer."
"Cheers!"
"I used to drink this a lot on tap at the Map Room in Chicago. It was not until recently when I moved to a neighborhood that lacks good beer selection in every store that I realized how much I truly love this beer. By chance a liquor store near me that has a paltry craft beer selection happens to carry this. The appearance is ""none more black"" even held up to the light BLACK! There is a medium tan head which quickly goes away. It smells mostly of coffee and dark chocolate, maybe a little burnt caramel and oak. The taste is everything in the smell, add a little dried fruit and hop bite. Mouth feel is silky and a little sticky with enough hops to balance it out to not be ""sticky sweet"" I could pretty much drink this beer until the high alcohol knocked me out, it is not difficult to drink at all."
"Pours black with a tan head into a tulip. Milk chocolate, roasted nuts, and a little hint of alcohol on the nose. Taste is sweet chocolate with a little kick of alcohol, I really like this one. Mouthfeel is rich and thick, perfect for this RIS. I had another glass right after the first, so I will def revisit this one often."
"Excellent smooth mouthfeel. Very well rounded and balanced RIS overall. Definitely one I will be going back to."
"D- Goes down smooth. Definitely a good sipper and enjoyable stout. Well-crafted beer."
"Nice smooth mouthfeel and easy to drink. I love the flavors in this IRS...I also like its bottle."
"For my money, I put this one right behind Sam Smith's RIS, and ahead of Victory's Storm King RIS. Seek and enjoy!"
"On edit: Mouthfeel in some bottles has a biting carbonation that needs some mellowing out before flavors start coming through."
"My first Russian Imperial Stout, and I will be trying more of the style."
"a great beer. especially for the price and availibility."
"i love stouts and this one enforced the love and lust for more delectables that you can't see through."
"This is a verygood Russian Imperial Stout. I recommend to any fan of the style."
"d- I only bought one and wish I had bought more. Only MGDs left in the fridge. Oh well, in this economy a $6 six pack of MGDs seem to beat out a $10 four pack of Old Rasputin. I'm glad I can try at least one."
"Only drink 1 or 2 of these in a session."
"Notes: This was my first russian imperial stout. And it was not at all what I expected. I had heard they were sweet. But I certainly didn't pick that up."
"I loved this beer. Plus the glass looks great."
"The latest in my foray into Russian Imerpial Stouts, trying to discover why they so dominate the ""best beers in the world"" lists. It pours pitch black with a medium tan head that is dense and creamy and leaves one of the densest lacings I've seen. Smell is musty wood, leather, raisins, and oranges. The taste is surprisingly sweet, and not at all acrid or burnt as so many others I have tried. It tastes of coffee, soft malt, leather, and a pleasant chalkiness. The mouthfeel is a good balance of carbonation and chewiness. The drinkability is limited by the bitter finish. This fades nicely through the aftertaste, but it is a bit intense for a while. Probably the best of the style I've tried, but I suppose I'm just not a true believer."
"12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adam's Perfect Pint glass. This RIS poured a dark black with a 1 1/2 finger mocha head that lasted forever. It smelled of roasted malts, chocolate and a faint smell of coffee. The taste is dominated by bitter chocolate up front. That quickly changes to a creamy roasted malt/coffee finish. This beers seems to stay on your tongue for a while. This is an awesome RIS and a bargain at its price. Everyone should search this beer out if it is available in their area."
"This beer's got some good flavors but some of them need to be more pronounced. I would even scale this back a bit and up the body and it'd be a great porter."
"D: solid flavor, hard to taste the alcohol content, and the short side of creaminess helps the easy to drink factor"
"A big bold beer, but I think it's a little too over-the-top (in flavor, mouthfeel, and ABV), to be extremely drinkable."
"This is a nice example of the style that seems to fit even on a warm April night. If this were available locally, it would be a staple of the fridge."
"Drinkability...I can drink this beer each and every winter night! Obviously b/c of the dark malt and heavy/creamy mouthfeel, this is not a summer (think 90F and 70% RH) beer. But on those cold Northern NY nights, this work of art will chase those winter blues away!"
"Picked up a single at the Beer Stop in West Hazleton. Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my shaker glass. Appears a nearly opaque black color with an inch of tight ecru head. Minimal lacing sticks to the inside of my glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells and tastes of rich, dark roasted grains, caramelized malts, milk chocolate, bitter coca powder, fresh coffee beans, grassy hops, and molasses. Rich and full bodied with medium carbonation. Slight alcohol burn from start to finish. A really great RIS. It's year round availability is a plus as well."
"Beer is a syrupy, liquid black with a small chocolate brown head that disappears quickly. Smell is coffee, molasses, chocolate, and roasted malts. Taste is smooth, rich malts up front with a slightly bitter finish that's accompanied by hints of dark chocolate. Alcohol warms and lingers in the finish as well. Carbonation dances across the toungue and leaves you wanting more. Beer is sticky and chewy in the mouth. A great RIS but fell a bit short compared to the Stone I had last night."
"loking for a good stout ??? then skip this one . if you are looking for an exceptional stout then stop right here. pour it out and it looks like the black color in the sidebars you see on these pages. brown head with a long lasting lacing. burnt chocolate and roasted malts greet you nose. very little carbonation almost none to speak of. and what a great taste. you will not be disappointed with this selection"
"D: this is my first imperial stout and its a very good one. Not overpowering by any means."
"I Have to back up the general opinion on this one. One helluva stout!"
"Pours with a huge, billowing head. Jet black and hard to see through. The head is cloudy with huge bubbles. It smells very chocolate like, with a little roasted flavor and earth. When you sip it sweetness immediatly fills your mouth, and coats your tongue. Almost too sweet for my taste in Imperial stouts, but nonetheless delicious and drinkable. Mouthfeel is very smooth and goes down easy. Not too thick. It is very inviting and you could drink plenty of it if it weren't for the high abv."
"I would pair this with chocolate - either a rich, dense cake or some nice Belgian chocolates."
"D: A very pleasant and rich stout, but much heavier than what I normally imbibe. Couldn't see drinking more than a couple of these."
"D - so easy to drink, just the right qualities to exemplify a RIS"
"This was my first beer from the North Coast Brewing Co. I picked up on my way home from work on a Friday night. I was not disappointed. I could only get through two before the 9% took affect. GREAT APPEARANCE, STRONG RICH AROMA... excellent finish..."
"Definitely worth the 4 pack, looking forward to having the rest. Probably one of the best basic non espresso/oak/chocolate type of Imperial stouts I've had"
"Overall, this is one incredible RIS. The flavors are bold, yet, not overpowering. Highly recommend."
"The regular RIS is average by itself but the oak definitely kicked it up an interesting level. It was dry enough that I could have drank another, if only they hadn't run out so quickly... Good stuff."
"D - Very drinkable, I will have many more of these."
"D- The high ABV is a little detrimental to its drinkability, but I could probably drink more of these. A definite recommendation."
"Of the three RIS's that I have had (Old Rasp, Boulevard, Dark Lord), I find this one a nice equilibrium, the Boulevard a bit too thin, the Dark Lord, while delicious, was extremely thick, perhaps impeding on drinkability. Therefore, I put it at the top until I can get my hands on a bottle of Kate the Great."
"I could have a few of these a night. I will def gt one everytime i go there."
"Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite RIS's that I will continue to by on a regular basis. This one's well worth the price."
"D: by and far one of the best stouts in the business, I will never tire of this beer! This is my staple beer and I love being able to get it on tap close by, an angel pooping on your tongue!"
"D: For a RIS this is the most drinkable I have had. The relatively strong 9% abv is hidden very well. If the first one didn't leave its mark every time, it would be hard not to have 2 or 3 or...."
"Pours pitch black with a thick brown head that stick to the sides of the glass. Sweet chocolate roasted malt and fruit aromas. This may be gross but the smell reminded me of straight Skoal chew spit. Kind of unappetizing and I wish I hadn't have made that connection. However the flavor totally redeemed the beer and made up for the aroma. Chocolate cream and dark roast burnt coffee beans with just the right amount of slight hop bitterness at the finish. There is an unsweetened dark chocolate flavor that lingers. Incredibly tasty. Could not detect any alcohol warmth or flavor in this beer."
"D) A very good interpretation of Russian Imperial Stout"
"Just not a big fan of this beer."
"not a session beer but i could drink alot more of these beers and i will"
"Great Russian Imperial Stout flavor. I really enjoyed this one compared to other RIS because the alcohol taste was barely there unlike some others. This was very dark and thick, but I was still able to put a nice head on it when pouring. The taste was very chocolaty with nice coffee tones, and a nice smooth finish."
"D: This has got to be the coffee-est beer I've ever had that didn't actually have coffee in it. This is also the beer that taught me the importance of the proper serving temperature. When served cold, it's a decent stout. After it's warmed up, it's one of the best beers on Earth."
"Notes: At the time of my review this beer is sitting at number eighty-nine on the best of BA list just above Storm King, thus I was expecting something qualitatively similar to Storm King. Boy was I wrong. This beer is superior in every way, and is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts out there. It definitely deserves to be higher on the best of BA list, and right now only Stone's Imperial Russian Stout seems to be the equal of this beer in the RIS category. If you ever see this beer in the store do yourself a favor a pick up more than one. You won't be disappointed."
"Overall: Great mouthfeel, great carbonation which helps bring out the wonderful flavor over this heavy and silky bodied stout. Very drinkable for the style, the alcohol doesn't slow down and it's not overpowering at all. Very good beer."
"They may not all be easy to get your hands on, but there is no shortage of great Imperial Stouts. The bar for this style is set ridiculously high, arguably much higher than most other styles. Although Old Rasputin may no longer be recognized as one of the top, most decadent RIS it damn well should be. I've had my share of revered, highly sought after Imperial Stouts but I'd still claim this as one of my favourites. And probably always will."
"Drinkability was good but having more than one of these would have shot me for the night..."
"All told, a great example of this style, and henceforth a staple in my fridge."
"Drinkability: A decent brew. I expected more based upon word of mouth, but am left wanting more complexity. At least its not cloyingly sweet."
"Pours an inky black colored body, with a gray brown head, with some good lacing but not very lasting. Aroma has some alcohol and some dark malts, nuttiness. Malty taste and some dustiness. Somewhat hot. Some dark chocolate. Too much for me."
"D- Drinkable enough to pair with dinner and filling enough to solo as dessert"
"Poured into a mini tulip, it is an almost black liquid with a finger of dark tan head which is not resilient. The smell is not very strong despite being served just slightly chilled. Smells of vanilla coffee/espresso, caramel. Taste begins a bit sweet then some hop bitterness, roasted malts, coffee/espresso and finishes nice and bitter. The alcohol warmth was fairly prominent near the end of the glass as it warmed. Light carbonation and a medium to medium-heavy body. The drinkability is limited by the 9% ABV. Very good classical interpretation of the style."
"D: This brew has everything you could hope for in an Imperial Stout. Very good."
"Overall a heavy beer that I couldn't drink alot of but it is very tasty."
"Pours almost black and with a syrupy appearance. Dark brown head that fades quickly. The smell is overpowering. You know what you are in for. The first sip is heavily bitter and smooth in feel. more bitterness in the aftertaste with a hint of coffee and chocolate. An excellent beer. Not for stout beginners, but everything that a stout lover wants and loves about the style."
"An all-around delicious beer, and for the price, it absolutely can't be beat."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable and with the proper pacing and water intake the %9 wouldn't wreck me"
"D: A great sipper I finally got around to"
"Drinkability: A nice and complex RIS. Not my favorite in the style, but up there...I will have this again, but due to the noticeable high ABV--probaly would only have one or two in a sitting..Excellent RIS."
"D: Would get more of these in the future."
"I always love this Russian Imperial Stout. It's probably one of my favorites in this catagory."
"Solid beer, very affordable. Great stuff."
"The drinkability is off the chart. I don't know how to explain that you could actually have 2 or maybe even 3 of these beers and still ""live"" through the experience - try doing that with Ten Fidy or Stone. In short you should grab a 4 pack and start enjoying today!"
"This one is a definite must."
"As for drinkability, the balance is surprising given the complexity of the beer. Without any overly biting flavors like molasses, anice, chocolate or otherwise, the drink flows as smooth as silk. But the high alcohol content means drinker beware . . too much of a good thing can make Rassy a dull boy!"
"i love sipping one of these at the end of the evening - this is what one looks for in a russian impy stout - tasty alcoholic goodness feels like it goes down my gi tract like it goes down the sides of it's glass, slow and easy with a creamy coating - a perfect winter nitecap - real good stuff."
"This is still one of my favorite imperial stouts. I'd love to some day get ahold of the XI or the Anniversary Barrel-Aged."
"Very very creamy and smooth. Definitely a sipper, but something you want to keep sipping on. The alcohol does show itself, and has a friendly warming presence. What a great beer, I can't believe I passed it up on the shelves all those times. That definitely won't be happening again!"
"Good Stout and something I look foward too having again."
"D: An excellent beer. One of the best imperial stouts that I have had. A high ABV limits the amounts I have, but its great on a cold dark night!"
"D: I could sip this day and night. A real winner."
"One of the best RIS i've had this winter!!"
"An excellent RIS. I like this a lot but it as not as complex as the very best."
"D- Smooth, tasty. Incredible drinkability for the style."
"Decent RIS, but not one of my favorites."
"Bottle. Pours a murky blackness with a small head that's nice and dark as well. Aroma is nice and roasty and malty with a bit of dark fruitiness and sugar. Flavor is great - chocolate, coffee, tons of malt, and a pleasant small bitterness. Good thick mouthfeel. Everything you'd expect and want in an imperial stout."
"A wonderful example of the style, and the one that introduced me to Russian Imperial Stout to begin with, not to mention its being the first ""big beer"" I ever tried, and it was love at first sip. I always come back to this one, and it never disappoints."
"Easily one of my favorite beers of all time as well as the quintessential example of what a Russian imperial stout should be all about."
"D: nice beer overall but the ABV would keep me from having more than 1. If the taste were exceptional or the weight better hidden I might press onward, but that's not the case."
"D - I don't think I could handle 3-4 OR in a session. Too much going on with too much alcohol to contend with. Plus, I paid more than $3 a 12oz bottle for these things, which doesn't help the drinkability one bit."
"D: A good sipper, not one Id drink repeatedly."
"D: This is not a multi-drinking type of brew... Something this bold and strong should be savored... Take your time sit back and enjoy the beautiful brew...."
"Although the alcohol stands out, the beer has a great taste and is very smooth. A beer that is worth revisiting."
"Drinkablity is very good being a dark 10% ABV beer - I could drink a four pack of these."
"Drimkibility. this one takes a while. It is a good one to have after dinner and savor it for a while. it relaxes me... Might have something to do with the alcohol content:) Overall a great beer at a great price."
"The complete stout in a bottle. Thank you North Coast."
"D: Good brew overall, but didn't quite live up to the hype surrounding it. I enjoyed it but the hops were just way out of balance and sunk it for me. I've just had better RIS's, but this is pretty unique so give it a shot if you can get it."
"I used to hate dark beers, but recently I have discovered how great they can be. This is amazing. Great flavor. I will buy this again, and probably try more of this style."
"Had on tap at Union Brew House. Poured into a 10 oz. glass. Pours jet black with a thin, creamy tan head. Smells of bitter chocolate, burnt coffee and some burnt sugar. Taste is wonderful. Good amount of chocolate and coffee with a nice, smooth sugary, malty finish. Nice creamy mouthfeel, but not thick- rather thin and drinkable. Wonderful beer that I probably first tried 10 years ago and is still great today."
"Thick without feeling syrupy. Smooth and still creamy, and a little frothy. It strikes great balance and makes for one great beer."
"One of my favorite impy stouts, it is high time I finally review this thing. It pours a dark ebony with a thick creamy brown head that slowly diminishes.A small amount of lacing sticks around while I drink. The smell is of dark roasted malts, coffee and a slight hint of chocolate. The taste is very rich and dark with a mild alcohol warmth at the back of the throat. Moderate carbonation and a full-bodied feel that finishes with a slightly charred finish. All in all, a wonderful quaff to be enjoyed regularly."
"Great RIS in the same vein as Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. A BIG beer; not for the beginner."
"Slick and thick mouthfeel."
"Thick viscous feel, very drinkable for what it is."
"This is a drinkable RIS. Perfectly complex & strong."
"D: Predictably good. This would go great with some creme brulee.."
"D - very good, highly recommended. One of my favorite RISs out. 9.00% ABV doesn't taste like. Try one now or just have another if you've already had it."
"Cheers!"
"A bit too carbonated, kills the smoothness I desire, but a very, very good RIS."
"Drink: Very tasty, and pretty drinkable for having an elevated abv."
"Drinkability: Good. Not cloying at all and the finish doesn't overstay its welcome."
"Nikki"
"Notes: Very enjoyable. but not the most standoutish of RIS's."
"Please take my advice on this one - pour this after a full dinner and pair it with an Onyx Reserve Robusto. This full bodied maduro created with Dominican, Nicaraguan blend tobacco and Blackened Connecticut wrapper creates dark aromas and a roasted character that pairs impeccably well with the brew. A puff of the cigar and sip of the slick RIS will make for a memorable evening."
"D: I could kill a 4 pack of this by myself in a few hours. The 9% is hidden so well you're liable to be dancing on the coffee table with a lampshade on your head at 3 AM before you even realize that you've had enough. So smooth, pretty creamy, and really delicious. But it did leave me wanting... a little."
"D. Very drinkable almost dangerously so with a 9% abv, I'd likely finish this 4 pack and still be willing to drink another. Great beer would recommend."
"M/D - nicely carbonated and surprisingly light bodied. Easy drinking brew that I definitely plan on having again. I also mixed it with a Hopslam for a tasty treat."
"Pours a thick rich black with a beautiful tan head that rises 2 fingers and sticks around quite awhile. Smell is of bitter hop,deep dark roasted malt and slight booze. Taste is awsome! Has more of a bitter ""snap"" to it than most other IRS's I've tried. Finishes clean and dry making your mouth ready for the next sip. Let me just say this is hands-down the best IRS based on taste/price/availability that I have come across. $6.99 a four pack of 12oz bottles for an IRS this good is unheard of. Hats-off to North Coast!"
"Overall, an outstanding stout that is very nicely balanced and multi-dimensional."
"Pours a deep dark mahogany almost black with a big tan head. Fades pretty quickly. Smell burnt chocolate malt with a nice dose of hops. Taste is good with coffee and a bit of hops. Hoppy RIS not my favorite but it seems to work with this one. Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium to light carbonation. Nice cold evening sipper."
"Black and opaque as tar. Very viscous. Sticky dark brown head. Bready, toasted malts dominate the nose and become almost burnt in the mouth. Lots of dried, dark fruit. Terrific mouthfeel -- very rich -- but tough going down (a single 12oz bottle feels like more than enough beer). Definitely an overrated beer, but still a very good one; a great example of an RIS. Not as good as Storm King or Stone IRS, but still very good."
"Revisting my review from February 3, 2009 (above) four and a half months later: I kept around a bottle from the same batch and let it age in the fridge. This time I'm trying it in a wide-mouth Chimay glass. One thing which is immediately apparent this time is the deep, nutty, coffee aroma. I do find the beer a litlte more enjoyable than I recall, but I still think it's a very good, but not great, beer."
"Poured into a ""beer clean"" 10 oz pils glass. Poured a bit flat then generated a rich, thick, pillow or tan froth, head retention was excellent. The smell of the beer was nothing suprising, the normal smokey, toffee notes of most of this style. Allowed to warm up abit the flavor is ""phenominal"" and was very enjoyable. Was quite a bit more drinkable than I anticipated, with roasted black malt dominating the pallate, with some caramel/toffe notes swiming around and lingering on my tounge. Mouthfeel was rich & creamy, enticing another drink. Not quite as hoppy as Storm King, but somehow slightly creamier similar to, but not nearly as sweet as a Cream Stout. The alcoholic flavors were not present as in some beers of this magnitude. Honestly, I'm Stouts are not my favorite style as they are not as heavily hopped as I like, but the more of these fantastic examples I try the more I appreciate & enjoy them. A+ for this ""Satanic Saint""!"
"Very drinkable beer because of it's thin body, but not one that I necessarily want to drink more than one of at a time, just because it wasn't that outstanding."
"Overall, there are better stouts out there. And I'm sure many of them don't come with the same rarity and price tag. You're better off finding yourself a nice Young's or something of that nature."
"Mouthfeel is not as thick as some stouts but is still substantial. Drinkability is decent. I wouldn't want to drink a lot, but I could definitely have a couple."
"There's a reason this beer is a cult classic. An affordable treat that I would never say no to."
"I had this at Isaac Newton's.Poured from a bottle into a PILSNER GLASS ??? At Isaac Newton's in Newtown PA. I was befoudled as you are. Anyway poured coca cola color with nice caramel heading and awesome lacing.A nice smell of coffee and barley up front with a bitter chocolate smell in the end. Taste is much like the nose also very creamy with no bitter aftertaste. A very good stout indeed and highly recommended."
"Drinkability. This is a potent offering that drinks easy but certainly one that I need to pace myself with. I see myself finishing this off after a nice big meal as a desert. Taking my time, savoring the flavors and let the warmth it has to offer wash over me."
"eh... looked better than it ended up being for me. maybe needs some aging?"
"This one is a slow sipper, but it's still very drinkable considering the 9% ABV. Perhaps even a bit too drinkable."
"If it wasn't for the high abv, I would be pounding this day and night. Absolutely amazing stout, perhaps my favorite at this moment."
"Overall a little too easy to drink, the somewhat high ABV is what keeps this from being a 5 because it is really that easy to drink."
"Drinkability - Very much so. I was smitten at the first sip. Love at first drink? Can it be? I picked up a single at first just to try this and found myself grabbing a 4pak immediately on my next shopping trip. I don't know if it was his hand that hypnotized me when I was looking at the bottle or what happened exactly, but I will buy this over and over for the price, ABV and quality you get."
"D: Picked up a four pack for about nine dollars and considering bombers of other RIS's go for upwards of seven bucks I found this to be a very solid deal (especially for the quality). This was one of the first, non macro, beers I tried and it was nice to see it hold up so amazingly. For the price and availability (being in the PNW) this is highly recommended and beyond drinkable. Rasputin was a trip, his beard was a trip, and this beer is a trip."
"D - Not a session beer, by any means. Sit back by the fire on a cold night with a couple of buddies."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours jet black with a thin tan head and lots of lacing. A very fragrant brew, with hints of licorice, chocolate and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is slightly bitter with hints of chocolate and booze. The finish is bitter and even a bit acidic. It is a full bodied sipper and damn enjoyable."
"This beer tastes great with intense fruit, bread, red meat, sweet and spicy foods (but not just sweet or just spicy), and creamy saucy food. Don't try it with anything that isn't as balanced as this drink though."
"D - It's not a bad beer, but there are better Imperial stouts out there."
"D: Be careful with this one, 'cause it'll knock you on your ass. I can handle maybe two of these in a sitting, but it's almost a challenge. It's such a powerful beer that it can be tough to hve more than one sometimes."
"Very good, very easy to find, but as it warms the hops tend to overtake the other flavors making it more difficult to drink as I prefer hops take a backseat if any seat in my stouts."
"Drinkability: like I said above...very yummy! Try, definatly try this one..you'll be amased!"
"Overall a delicious beer and one of the better Imperial Stouts out there, imho, but the style is not of great drinkability to me."
"D- This is quite an aggressive stout, almost a meal in a bottle. I highly recommend trying this beer out."
"D: Minnesota winters beckon you to buy this thing. Very affordable, one big beer that appears to have lots of distribution. Will purchase another 4-pack sometime."
"Drinkability: This is one big imperial stout. A very good beer with a powerful and aggressive profile, pleasant aromas and nicely balanced flavors. Highly recommended."
"With that, it looks like it's time for me to refill my glass."
"D: Exceptional, no hint of alcohol anywhere in this beer. One of my favorite RISs, especially at price and availability. Comparable to Storm King, but I think I prefer this."
"Drinkability: I would have to say this isn't the most enjoyable nor tastiest RIS I have had. But I will point out that it is a very drinkable beer that I could solely enjoy for the evening, albeit it would be a short evening at 9%."
"In all, I guess this is quite drinkable if you enjoy a beer of this style on this caliber. I'm in my second and determining that this would be best accompanied with a rich dinner, but I am having no trouble sipping through this."
"D - Such a great sipping beer and nice to drink. It would be hard to drink more than two of these in one night as you have to sip and savor this or the alcohol will knock you out."
"D - This is the kind of beer that makes me feel like a beer virgin, all over again."
"D - For a 9% imperial stout it is very drinkable. A little sweet for more than one or two. That said this beer is probably not meant for too many more in one go."
"I don't know if I could find a more ""drinkable"" RIS. I really want to find this on draught now."
"D- favorite Imperial Stout, hands down. Certainly a beer for any dark beer lover or any beer drinker alike!"
"D - A pleasant robust experience that makes me appreciate the potential of this style. If possible I will want to keep this one on hand."
"overall, highly recommended! a great RIS that i overlooked for a long time... and do i regret that? yes."
"Overall: great RIS, I highly recommend it. If you live in the Boston area, get over to Deep Ellum, where they have it on nitro consistently."
"Absolutely amazing. Old Rasputin on Nitro is pretty much as good as it gets."
"Exceptionally smooth with a medium amount of carbonation. Highly drinkable but the alcohol can sneak up on you fast if you're not careful with this one. Overall this is a nicely balanced RIS and a great interpretation of the style."
"Pretty sure the ratings I'm giving this will make it my top rated beer. You know, maybe not my favorite ever, but as far as RIS and Stouts go - this is just leagues above anything else I've had."
"Drinkability - This beer is gonna take my taste buds round back of the middle school and get 'em pregnant."
"I saw this beer mention time and time again on the forums here at BA. When at my local Bevmo, I'd always bypass it for other selections. But, this recent experience will force me to always keep one or two at least in my cellar. I plan to share this beer with others that have not tasted it yet."
"MF&D - very smooth, and thick. Not as thick as it could be, but then again, who wants to drink syrup. nothing extraordinary to really note here."
"This may be jsut due to personal taste and all, I wouldn't go out of my way to pick it over say Founders breakfast or a Yeti or a stout such as those, however..."
"This one is really, really well made. Sweet without being cloying, well balanced, not trying to be grabbing you by the throat and screaming ""Imperial Stout Here! Bet you can't drink me!"". It's very well put together, easy to drink, satisfying, and just generally a very, very good beer. Highly recommended."
"4/4/4"
"This had a horrible bitter taste. The aftertaste was just terrible. I could not drink this and enjoy it at all! I was greatly disappointed. Apparently I just do not have the same taste buds as others who reviewed this but It was just awful tasting to me and I have tried many stouts."
"D - It has a moderately high drinkability. The higher ABV is quite welcome on a cold winter day."
"my favorite year-round beer."
"D: Stong and intense flavors mean that you will spend a little bit of time finishing this one. Very good."
"Pours jet black with a tan head that has a wonderful oil layer on top. Really nice looking brew. The smell is even better, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. The taste continues the trip to Chocolate town with hints of coffee and caramel to boot. This is an intense beer, you really take your time with it and one is probably plenty, but I really enjoyed it. I've never been a stout guy, but this is a couple in a row that I've enjoyed. I would definetly have this beer again, it would be a great dessert after a meal."
"Drinkability is exceptional. The alcohol warmth and kick at the finish designates this a sipper - but a damn good sipper at that. The best Russian Imperial I've had. This is a must try for any stout lover. It's just perfectly balanced, perfectly brewed, just perfect."
"Poured this into a snifter and it had a thick tan head. It smells strong of espresso and dark chocolate. It tastes just like it smells, strong espresso and dark chocolate. There is a hint of alcohol as it warms the back of the throat. This beer is thick and creamy almost like a meal in of itself. One of the most robust stouts I have tried to date."
"First impression: someone robbed a tin of 90% cocoa powder and poured it in here. It's like the superconcentrated intense chocolate experience of Weyerbacher XIII, except I don't have to choke it down. A little hop presence to balance out the chocolate/coffee, and that's it. Nice and coating without being overly cloying, and no crappy aftertaste to speak of, which is quite a feat when you consider the ABV and intense flavors. A great sessionable RIS."
"Oh so smooth. Pours nice and thick with a caramel colored head that dissipates fast. Smells like you would expect it to, roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is great, so nice and smooth, not too carbonated. Some alcohol taste present, but still very drinkable. Overall, this tastes like a very good RIS, but the quality lies in how well is drinks. One of my favorites. I got to go to the brewery in Fort Bragg CA, and had four of these with dinner...amazing."
"2007 vintage. Pours ebony black, minimal beige head and lacing. Nose- strong anise, slight roast. Taste- dry dark roast, some burnt malt, anise and moderate bittering hops which really show in the finish. Relatively light bodied for style, moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good given light body and lack of hotness. Nice RIS"
"Drikability For a Russian stout goes down pretty good. A little to rich to drink to fast, must be sipped, a very nice beer."
"One of the darkest pours I've ever seen, thick and heavy with a medium brown head. Massive hits of coffee beans and bitter chocolate with just a slight hint of the alcohol buried beneath it all. How I miss my youthful days when I used to regularly drink four of these a night. Probably the most pleasant drunk I've ever had. Your beer drinking life is not complete if you've never had this one. Also Rasputin's beard is a hero to mine, just saying."
"Note, had this on nitro-tap at Deep Ellum last week. It was even better in that format."
"Very thick fully bodied beer, that had a touch of bitterness coming right through. The smokey, dark taste was really impressive. I thought that I got some coffee flavor breaking through the beer, which made for a nice aftertaste."
"D, notes: Not sure I waited so long to try this classic. Very good. Despite its weight and full taste an easy to sip beer that does not sit in the gut."
"Drinkabilty is awesome. This is a big beer (9%) and it is really big on taste, but I could easily drink a couple in a night. The hardest part was stopping myself from getting too tipsy and waking up with a hangover. Highly recommended. You could easily spend double or triple what you would on this just to get a beer of lesser quality. One of the best beers I have ever had."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter on Christmas Eve. Poured a Very dark, opaque black with a thin tan head that faded fast but comes back strong with a swirl of the glass. smells of bitter chocolate, some prunes maybe, and a hint of caramel. Tastes of some bitter chocolate as well. very drinkable for a RIS. mouthfeel is fizzy rather than thick and creamy like other RIS I have had."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"Goes down easy for an RIS. Excellent beer."
"D - This is a nice easy drinking RIS versus the big chewey meals in a bottle. Simple but very nice."
"This is North Coast Brewing's signature beer!"
"This is one of my new favorites, my only request would be a little more bitterness or a second malt flavor to jump out other than just the dark chocolate. As is it is very drinkable and worth the price."
"Add a year to this beer....and holy crap is it amazing. I thought it was good before. Now...it may very well be my favorite stout. Just delicious! Screw Rasputin XII, it doesn't get much better than this. And when you consider this beer currently has 2044 reviews and still retains it's A grade, that really says something. Considering it's deliciousness and availability...this is a world class beer, without a doubt."
"This beer by name alone sounds very ominous, however I think it is one the best stouts available. This beer is definitely not for the weak, or for people who can't appreciate the style. This beer starts with a rich molasses pour, that is as black as black can get; great cascade into the dark tan/ light brown head. The smell is of rich black roasted malts, with hints of rye and oats. I know each person is different, some prefer to sip this beer; but I can't help but almost chug it, if that says anything about the drinkability. If you haven't had this beer you owe it to yourself to pick up a four pack, chill to proper temperature and enjoy!"
"12oz bottle. Pours black with a chocolate head. Decent carbonation. Aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate, syrup, and hops. Taste of hops, with a heavy roasted malt backbone. Notes of chocolate, dark fruits, syrup, and alcohol. Very dry finish, with a nice hop bitterness. Surprisingly medium mouthfeel, I was expecting something to chew on but exceptionally drinkable."
"Mmmm, very tasty and worthy of its reputation, but i would still put Brooklyn BCS and Ted Fidy in front of this particular brew."
"One of these bad boys usually satisfies but could easily be a 'session' sipper for the hardy. Great with chocolate, by a fire, or under the stars. Honestly, one of the best beers I've had. Dark and delicious."
"(rated Aug 7, 2007)"
"Another fine beer from Fort Bragg!"
"D - Alright RIS, body feels more like a Irish Dry to me though"
"Old Rasputin probably deserves its canonical spot as a point of constant comparison, a standard-bearer, for the style. It seems impossible to be displeased by it."
"Overall: A great beer to have on a cold winter night. Fantastic."
"D- A true beer for this time a year, i great sipper on a cold winter night"
"This is a highly drinkable beer, but everything seems just a little short of bold. It's just one or two points outside of extraordinary. I wouldn't turn it down if it were free, but there has to be something better from the genre."
"D: While I probably wouldn't want to drink more than one or two of these at a time, I enjoyed drinking this one all the way through. Overall this is a really good beer that I'll definitely drink again."
"Very solid beer, and again, one that it's easy to take for granted without the buzz of a seasonal release. Good stuff, and I'm glad to have found it on tap. I'm planning on grabbing a 4-pack or two to throw in the cellar and see what happens. Nice to see you again, old friend!"
"Overall: This a complex beer with a bitter hoppy finish. Wonderful Full body beer. Balanced for the most part."
"Overall: one of the best stouts Ive had. Only thing I didnt like that much was the hop profile. I dont think stouts should have flowery citrus hops. It doesnt fit, in my opinion."
"A very solid Imperial Stout. For better or worse, this shouls be the comparison for all other Imperial Stouts."
"tastes the same, but a little tamer than normal, first time i have ever had this beer on tap, and maybe its the nitro, but its not as intense, this is one of my favorite beers but i am a little disapointed in this version, its smooth and drinkable, but not old raspy i know and love."
"Great beer. Drink it. now."
"Put all of this together and Rasputin is a decent imperial stout, but personally I don't see it as balanced, complex or amazing as many others do. For those still trying to find their preference in the world of RIS's I would recommend trying Rasputin at least once to see if a more bitter stout is for you."
"Black pour, not much light or coloring even around the edges. Solid brown head. Roasty aromas, some red fruit and barrel aroma also. Fairly carbonated, but ends up being somewhat creamy. Roast/burnt malts, bakers chocolate, dark red fruit/port wine flavors. Med/full bodied. Finishes real clean and warm. The standout in the North Coast stable"
"An excellent beer. Pours like a 40-weight after driving 5,000 miles. Scent of coffee and chocolate, with just right amount of raisin and date. Taste is coffee and burnt malts, caramel anf vanilla. Long finish. This brew is almost like a combination of Stone's version mixed with Speedway Stout."
"D- Very drinkable, and tasty. I'm glad this is regularly released in my area."
"Recommended."
"I always noticed that this beer was highly rated on this website and now I see why.. it's freakin delicious. It was only $2.29 for a single and worth every penny. A nice brown head, lacing all the way down. Great chocolate and burnt type aromas. Very smooth and balanced, goes down way too easy. A great beer... definitely in my top 5."
"D - Very high! This is great, and it has aged well."
"This is definatly an after dinner beer. I can only handle 2 of these in one sitting."
"pours a gorgeous pitch black with a thick dark tan head which has excellent retention and leaves a good amount o sticky lacing on my glass. Smell is of rich, tasty dark chocolate with a touch of caramel and some coffee notes as well. Taste is of rich, chocolate and coffee with a bitter twang of hops in the background throughout. Little hints of dark fruit, plum and cherry on the mid palate and one of the smoothest, chocolaty, yet dry finish I have ever tasted. Wow, mouthfeel is full bodied and very creamy - again, what an incredibly creamy, dry finish - beautiful. This is my first time having this beer and I'm speechless - this is an amazing RIS that I will be cellaring and would not hesitate for a second to purchase again. True class."
"But all in all, for the price a great go to RIS."
"Pours a dark black color with a thick, frothy coffee/tan head. Aroma dominated by roasted chocolate maltiness and coffee. Very smooth and creamy quaffable beer that masks the high ABV very well. Dark roasted chocolate maltiness throughout with coffee, oatmeal, toffee and burnt toast notes. Excellent."
"one of my favorite RIS beats brooklyns any day and im a big fan of brooklyn"
"Overall: I enjoyed this brew. It has a very solid flavor to it and is relatively easy to drink. Personally I enjoy a little more dark fruit flavor to my imperial stouts but that by no means is to say I don't like Old Rasputin. I understand why this is such a highly rated beer. I will be picking this one up again."
"This Northern California brewed Russian Imperial Stout is one of my favorite beers. Old Rasputin is absolutely deliciously overwhelming with roasted malt and alcohol. It should really be poured into a glass first so the beautiful brown head can be enjoyed. Despite being 9% alcohol, this beer is surprisingly easy to drink."
"Goes down easy for an RIS. Excellent beer."
"The mouthfeel is almost creamy, definitely very smooth. Not the most drinkable Russian Imperial Stout I've had, but it's close. Maybe my palate has just matured in the last few months, or Old Rasputin needs a little aging, but I have definitely changed my mind about this beer. Try it if you can!"
"¡Salud!"
"This is a highly recommended beer. One of my favorites, especially since it comes in 12 ounce bottles and so many good stouts are 22 ouncers"
"No light getting through this thick dark dark brown stout. Smells of dark heavily roasted malts. Tastes of roasted espresso beans and bitter chocolate. For me, the mouthfeel and drinkability of this hearty meal are where it shines. So creamy smooth with enough carbonation to remind you that this is beer. Would you like another? Yes please."
"epilogue: i made a black and tan with this and pliny the elder. needless to say, i've put in an order for a new set of taste buds..."
"Pitch black with a fluffy, chunky, light brown head, thick lacing. Smell: sweet, dark fruit, roasted malts, milk chocolate, cocoa, black licorice, alcohol is well hidden in the background alongside grassy hops. Taste: roasted, caramel, burnt, chocolate flavors with hints of dark fruit and rich coffee, with a complimentary alcohol warmth. Sweetness is decently balanced with citric, grassy, earthy hops. Full bodied, slick, slightly syrupy/creamy (more so on nitro tap). A rich stout with well hidden alcohol, one of the more drinkable RIS around."
"A readily drinkable imperial Russian stout. And, given the fact that it's accessible in most major markets around the country, it's even more appealing. Totally accessible for beer geeks and neophytes alike in my opinion. A great intro to the style, and a wonderful example of what all imperial stouts should strive for."
"It was a terrific beer, until I took a sip. Then it became an ok beer for the style. Way too much carbonation, not thick and creamy either."
"Pours the color of used motor oil, nice fluffy brown head that settles slowly into a cap. The aroma is of dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, burnt wood, and a touch of grape sweetness. All big and bold. The flavor is of freshly ground coffee beans, roasted chocolate, some smoke/burnt wood, vanilla and rum notes, and bad vodka?. The feel is a bit harsh for my liking. The body is nice and chewy and there is a nice smoothness to it but there is also a raw booziness that I am not fond of. Not a red wine booziness but hard alcohol booziness. Like I mentioned before, kind of reminds me of bad vodka out of a plastic jug. Definitely a big and bold RIS, great roasted malt and chocolate malt flavors but the hard booziness is getting to me a bit."
"Excellent dark color with a tan head that gives off strong scents of chocolate, mocha and some malts. I particularly enjoyed this imperial stout, because even though the ABV is 9%, it is very difficult to recognize any traces of alcohol. It has a nice clean finish and doesn't leave any offensive after-tastes. I would definitely drink Old Rasputin again."
"Edit - I've had this beer more over the past year and im still not very impressed with it, will age some and try again"
"D: In the spirit of it being imperial, I felt like it was a very rich and high quality RIS. It was lovely and warming. Rasputin is a great label for it - it certainly had a mysterious aspect to it. I don't find this style highly drinkable, I like to have one once in a while. Having said that, it was an easy drink to put to rest. A fine brew that I'll happily pick up again in future."
"(Bottle) The"" pop"" sound from the bottle cap is very inviting and calming; there is carbonation! Some haze rising from the bottleneck seconds after. The pour is dark brown with some mahogany notes as well as a dark reddish hint. In the glass, the beer looks darn black. On top of everything, you get a one finger high, medium brown head. The first thing that hits you ones you sniff the beer is a massive, 50/50 blend of dark caramel and deluxe-ish, dark creamy chocolate. Higher, more burned tones of blackcurrant/tar-like liquorice, bitter cocoa, deep caramelized brown sugar and black coffee beans/aromatic espresso. The hop profile in this beer is becoming more extreme for every year. I have stored this beer for more then one year and the aroma hops is still full of citric/grapefruity and resiny notes. The alcohol is also impressive; not too sharp nor too aggressive, it just adds more elegance to the nose. A light dark fruitiness is lurking in the background. The roast is dry and the caramel is sweet - just perfect. The flavour is a mix of elegant roasted and burned malts with tones of dark chocolate, dark caramel, black coffee/espresso, liquorice, tar and asphalt. The hops bring obvious notes of citrus and resin, but there is also some room for earth and grass. The mouthfeel is round, smooth and light silky with a soft, easy carbonation. A dark fruity touch of prunes and dry raisins. The aftertaste is noting less the stellar with a touch of citrus, dry coffee/cocoa roast and a light sweet port hint. Medium to full bodied. This beer is has a perfect malt profile. The hops a bit too tart, still fantastic!"
"Drinkability: Just recently acquired a taste for beer, and this is one of my favorites so far."
"The beer pours pitch black. The head is light brown when first poured then settles to a off white colored foam. The smell is of roasted grain but all in all not much of a smell. The first taste is intense roasted flavors followed by a intense bitterness of hops.Neither one of the intense flavors in this beer are all that appealing to me. As I drink this beer the drinkability of this beer is decreasing with each sip. The beer is increadibly roasty at first then it transitions into a very bitter flavor from the hops and then it finishes with alcohol. The beer is intense in the mouth it is increadibly rough with the bittering hops. Overall the beer is a good night cap beer that is ggod to drink once in awhile. Compared to other RIPS it is slightly better than average. Worth trying and would buy again. I live in Portland Maine and buy this beer off tap at Novre Res and have to say off tp this beer is increadible. The flavors are subdued a lot and there is more of a balanced flavor. To end this review worth trying nothing amazing but is pretty good."
"I liked this beer. I could drink it all day, but I am scared of what my poop would look like the next day. It is the right time of year for it. It was smooth and mellow. Rocking you gently into drunkenness"
"Overall - great beer, my favorite Russian Imperial Stout so far. I'm glad it is in my local store now."
"Notes: The Old Rasputin provides a nice balance between the roasted chocolate and coffee malts, and the hop bitterness. Although it's a little too hoppy for my tastes, it's still a real winner in my book! And a great QPR beer as well (4-pack for only $7.99). For anyone who loves stouts, and especially Russian Imperial Stouts, this one should be on your short list of beers that you must indulge in."
"Pours a black coffee color into a pint glass, with a thin sandy-colored head which reduces to a thin ring and leaves wisps of lacing throughout the drink. Aroma is coffee, dark chocolate, roasted grain, espresso beans, a little bit of fruit. Mouthfeel is slick, chewy, coats the tongue, with good carbonation, good balance between medium-heavy body and medium carbonation. Taste is roasted grain up front, with coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, charred oak, and a dry finish. As it warms, wood flavor becomes more prevalent, as well as a little alcohol warmth, although not overpowering. Drinkability is high despite the 9% ABV because of how well it is hidden. Overall this is a great brew and I would try again."
"Drinkability. Absolutely drinkable. Check this out if you haven't already."
"this is my favorite RIS its easily accessible, reasonably priced, and delicious."
"This mouthfeel is, of course, full-bodied and it's also very rich and creamy with a good play on the tongue thanks to the carbonation and mild alcohol burn. The 9% ABV makes it hard to have too many of these but at least it's only a 12oz bottle. Sipping slowly and enjoying this beer, I could easily go for a few more on a cold night like tonight."
" I drank two of these bad boys from a mug while doing the last of my yard work for the year in the falling snow. My mission is to find more of this and soon. I deem this ""DA BOMB"""
"T&M-Taste is absolutely outstanding! Mocha seems to be the best explanation. Loads of bittersweet chocolate, Dark Roasted coffee with a semi sweet kind of finish. Mouthfeel is quite creamy, leaving a great balance of sweetness & bitterness all around. Drinkability is also quite nice. At 9% I could definitly not pound these, but drinking 2 of these consecutively wouldn't be a problem. IMO this a widely available world class beer that can certainly run with the big boys within it's category, a must try for anyone who enjoys a super high quality RIS."
"Overall - The only other Imperial Stout I've had was Yeti's Imperial Stout from Great Divide Brewing Company (another favorite around here, apparently), and this one is so much more approachable and drinkable. The alcohol is hidden well, and it sneaks up on you, so be careful. Awesoime brew."
"Overall, within my top 3 beers. Definitely the best RIS I've ever had."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass. BLACK! Perfect example of this style. One of the best! A must drink for the stout lover!! Wonderful nose appeal and equally as pleasant on the palate. Nice coffee chocolate flavors you would expect. Smooth upfront. Don't drink a dozen!!! Nice sipper!! Awesome brew!!!"
"This put the stout in stout. WOW!!! Very black beer with a nice, dark brown head that left nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Smelled mostly of coffee and dark malts. Taste started with strong coffee with a bit of alcohol, followed by lots of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. This is a very good, strong, sipping beer. A few of these and you will be wrecked so watch out."
"this brew pours up black with a decent little light brown head. pretty decent lacing. the nose is sweet roasty malts, subtle coffee, hints of dark chocolate, a nice aroma but pretty much the average Imp Stout smell. Nothing too insane. the thing that I like about Rasputin is the grainy rough texture it has. This is truly a man's Stout that will easily put hair on your chest even if you're a woman. The taste is the same as the nose except it also has a little bit of an alcohol note and a good spicy hop balance. Both the alcohol notes and the hops give this beer a nice lil kick. Medium to full bodied, high spritzy carbo. A nice rough Stout..."
"D-Drinkable, in that it's a good beer, and it makes me want to have another one. Of course, being a little heavier could get in the way of enjoying too many in a sitting, but this is a very enjoyable beer to sip on during a cold winter evening."
"Overall, a great beer that I will certainly buy again the next time I am looking for a sipper, especially with the coming of the cold weather."
"I had the beer on tap at Brixie's bar in Brookfield,IL. (The bar turned me into a craft brew snobb, but that's for another date.) I found the beer to be black in appearence with a typical crawling stout head. On the initial sip I noticed a bitter hard alcoholish stout/ malty beginning iwth a choclatey milkshake like robust finish (hoppy). I give the beer an A."
"D- very good, need to pair this with a meal probably something fatty instead of drinking by itself. Very impressed with this brew. I will look for it again."
"D- Ok on drinkable its overall just an ok RIS much better on nitro then other version so make sure to try it if you get the chance."
"A bit overrated IMO. There are better RISs than this."
"Would love to find this on draft."
"Excellent example of the style, well done North Coast."
"Fantastic beer - one I guess I'll have to do more importing of to Iowa over the winter."
"Dark pour, close to black with ruby brown hues around the edges. Somewhat frothy tan head, not too dense and settles to a ring. Good smell of molasses, raisin, light roast and ash, and chocolate with a cocoa. Taste is pretty good. Much of what was noted in the nose but with a bit much bitterness. A bit heavy on the booze, especially for a lighter RIS. Mouth is more toward medium than full, not thin but the bitterness keeps it from being to creamy. One isn't a problem but two or more might be a task."
"Drank a couple and that was good enough. A little too heavy for a session beer, but nice for just a couple"
"Somewhat chewy and full, but not quite the best - very little carbonation, which is fine, but it might help cleanse the palate of the harsher aspects of the brew."
"D - Pretty good, but not my favorite. Could be a victim of raised expectations. Feels light for a RIS and flavour is solid but not mindblowing."
"This is a great example of an RIS and old standby. Highly recommended."
"D - An outstanding, enjoyable brew. Take your time with this one. What the hell, I might as well use the coffee analogy once more: drink this beer as you would a cup of coffee on a lazy morning."
"D - MORE NOW."
"Dark malt, raisin, chocolate smell. Very smooth roasted malt taste. Chocolate, coffee, etc Very very drinkable. Only slight taste of alcohol in a 9% ABV beer. Excellent beer, excellent stout."
"This is an excellent brew for this time of year, but probably a bit too much for the warmer months (especially here in Vegas). A couple of these will make you feel all warm and toasty inside."
"Shoot me now, I'll die happy."
"D - Is there a better brew for the winter? I doubt it."
"Future outlook: Possible that I would pick this up again for rare-occasion sipping, though not something that would rank prominently for regular imbibing."
"D: At 9% ABV, not exactly sessionable - but a great sipper that's appropriate for this time of year."
"Though the brew itself has a bit more of a carbonation texture than in other stouts I usually go for, which makes it a little less ""oily"" feeling I guess, there is still a nice creamy and full body to it."
"At a whopping 9% ABV, this is no doubt a sipping brew. Best enjoyed in a snifter glass, at cellar temp, with slow, thoughtful sips. I bought a single bottle of this to give it a try, and I am very glad I did. For the cold months approaching, I plan to buy more, as this is one of the ultimate winter splurges out there."
"D: pretty drinkable. only wish i had the extra cash to buy it more often."
"Drinkability: This is a delicious Russian Imperial Stout, and an ideal sipper. It's also great with a snack, or while playing a game of darts or pool. If you like this kind of beer, especially one with a heavy coffee taste, check this one out. Just remember there's no caffeine in it."
"Overall, I have enjoyed this beer for several years and have never rated it before. It is everything I would expect from a good imperial stout with great coffee and chocolate flavor."
"D-I am sad that I have not had this before but I will have it often from now on."
"D- Definite sipper, but great flavor will bring me back."
"If you like coffee definitely worth reaching for."
"thick, creamy and oh, did I say THICK! superior drinkability but watch out it will kick your ass!"
"Drinkability: This is big and heavy like a RIS should be. Don't drink a lot - just enjoy."
"Their is a nice alcohol taste at the forefront with a little hop bitterness than the espresso takes over. Then the chocolate and hops combine to give almost a semi sweet dark chocolate taste. Surprisingly their is a nice hop bitter aftertaste. Very nice RIS, perfect for a cold winter day."
"D - this is one delicious RIS, I would drink it whenever I could get it"
"Pours beautifully - nice and dark, almost black with a frothy tan head that settles to about 1/16"". Laces great too. Smells of dark chocolate, cream and a hint of coffee - sort of like Cool Whip splattered on Hershey's dark chocolate. Yummy. I get no hint of alcohol at this point - maybe some will poke out as it warms. The taste mirrors the smell with plenty of chocolate and coffee followed by a long, bitter finish that invites you back for more. The beer is very full bodied and somewhat sweet - making it more of a sipper than a quaffer. My only other RIS reference point is Sprecher's, which I find unbalanced and plodding on the palate. This beer is delicious and very drinkable. Throw in a great price (under $7 for a 4-pack) and I will be buying more!"
"Very well made and crafted. Friend of mine bought this me a year ago and it is one of the best imperial stouts I have every had."
"Pours a black color with a thick tan head that sticks around until the end. Smells of sweet malts. Tastes of roasted malts with some background nuttyness and chocolate. An extremely smooth beer with one of the best sweet aftertastes I've ever had. Wether you think youre a stout drinker or not you have to try this."
"Damn, this stuff is crazy drinkable."
"Pours a thick, midnight black with little head and little lacings. This stuff is thick. A strong malt smell of roasted, coffee, some chocolate, probably some other malts like bread or toasted could be in there. Incredibly smooth when you first sip it, the roasted and chocolate malts really kick in. Definitely a sipper. Full-bodied and slightly creamy (although you could slightly syrupy as well), this beer passes over the tongue leaving behind that malty goodness and finishes with a firm, dry backbite. If it weren't for the ABV I could drink this all day."
"Nice, big stout. Rather easy to drink but remember the alcohol, it creeps up on you."
"Drinkability is good. This is a great stout, no wonder its won so many medals. Goes down pretty easy too, considering the ABV."
"This beer was one of my early favorites after I started going online to look at reviews for beer. It's a dark, dark brown and has a head that's a bit lighter than ideal, but it still looks good. The nose is full of chocolate with some coffee, malt and other complexity. Chocolate comes through strongly in the flavor. There's really a lot going on, more than I'm able to describe accurately, anyway. There is some sweetness, a lot of malt, some coffee and some hoppiness. It's a good RIS, which puts it beyond my relatively undeveloped descriptive capabilities. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth with good carbonation. The drinkability is high, and the beer has a nice dry finish to complement its complex flavors. It's a really great stout with a lot going on and a smooth feel."
"Overall a very nice RIS. Not exactly terribly drinkable, but that's just in the nature of the style."
"But this is a very tasty, and very robust beer. Lots of character, lots of flavour - too heavy for more than one in a sitting, but worth waiting around for the occasional sip."
"Poured jet back with a small caramel colored head from a 1/6-barrel keg. Smells of beautiful deep roasted coffee, chocolate, and deep roasted malts. First sip is sweet chocolate and a ton of coffee - lovely and delicious. Complex and somewhat creamy, its backbone is not nearly as heavy or complex as a DL but it is creamy enough to make Old Rasputin one fine World Class RIS."
"Four packs of this were on sale for $6.99 so I picked one up. A high quality brew in a relatively inexpensive package. Not my favorite IS but pretty tasty too."
"This is a great beer. Great example of an imperial IPA. Will definitely try more of this style in the future. Best non-Guinness stout I've had"
"Drinkability is good considering the finish leaves you wanting another sip for the initial sweetness."
"This beer is great for the seasons to come: fall and winter. Have this one before you go to bed, for a great sleep. This beer comes in a four pack, and I recommend holding on to a few and see where the aging process takes it."
"This is a very good example of a Russian Imperial Stout. One of the best out there."
"Overall, a great beer and a great value."
"This a beast of a beer, the thickness and the texture coupled with the high ABV probably couldn't have too many of these in one sitting."
"An awesome Russian Imperial Stout. One of the best out there."
"This beer is considerably easy to drink. This is a beer best suited for sipping. Especially on a cold night, this would be the beer to sit with and enjoy the evening. Very easy to drink another one, and as it warms it does add to the taste to a slight degree, given the style of the beer. I would highly recommend."
"Overall, a top notch beer!"
"I can see why this is so popular; doesn't try to go too extreme in the RIS category, merely offers a finely-crafted, drinkable brew. Another well-rounded brew from North Coast."
"Old Ras has been one of my top fives for a while now and it was all the better being I hadn't had it in months. Excellent."
"This is a wonderful stout to kick back with though i couldnt drink more than 2 at a time. I prefer Stones RIS but this a very nice beer."
"Good brew and enjoyable to drink. Very drinkable for the style."
"Overall: I'm impressed by this Imperial Stout. We don't get many up here in Vancouver, but of the ones I've tried, this is 2nd only to Peche Mortel."
"I once had this bad boy on hand-pump at the Map Room in Chicago. Not sure I've every had a better beer. Ever."
"This is a wonder in a bottle. Drink it alone or with some chocolate desert. I am not the stout fan in my house, but this is definitely one worth trying."
"Drinkability: A great change-of-pace for this DIPA fan. Not a great session beer- better served as a sipper."
"This is one of my first experiences as i delve into the world of porters and stouts. This brew smells strong of espresso and dark chocolate and tastes of it as well. For being 9% abv, it hides it very well. all in all i'd reccomend it to those who want to enjoy an excellent stout."
"taste is smooth, milk and dark chocolate, touch of caramel, and coffee bean, ends a little bitter and somewhat dry."
"Drinkability, for a 9% ABV beverage, is outstanding. Aside from the fact that you're going to be drunk, you'll still be wanting to keep tasting it."
"This was just too bitter for me to drink as a standalone - I realize now that most ""craft"" beer drinkers are looking for super bitter beers, so I can see the popularity of this - but it is not for me. Would be a good accompaniment to a heavy meal that would mask the bitter flavor."
"This beer is the first imperial I ever had and it still remains my favorite. Old Rasputin is big, rich, chocolate, coffee, roasted goodness that never lets up. it's the perfect, kick back and slowly sip beer for me and I really don't say that often. So by far, if you're looking for a go big or go home kind of Russian, look no further."
"Pours a dark brown color with a very thick light tan head that settles fairly slowly. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy, along with some cocoa notes. Tate has some roasted coffee flavors, along with some oakey notes as well. Maybe even a faint bit of licorice ? Hmm... Mouthfeel is a tad bit light for such a flavorful brew. A very nice RIS. Would certainly be agreeable to having this again."
"Drinkability= First one going down really smooth, alcohol already warming half way through...Ill let you know later tonight ;)"
"A cult classic that is worthy of the tag!"
"This is definitely a stout-standing brew that pours a deep brown with a ""chocolate foam"" head that disipates rather quickly to a mere thin line and has sticky, on-the-move lacing. It smells of chocolate syrup with toasted/smokey notes and slight hints of a freshly rained on forest. The flavors are of toasted malts with chocolate tones and prevalant alcohol with a slight hoppy bitterness. Presents medium carbonation with a pleasant, lingering palate."
"	FINALLY THE RUSSIAN INPERIAL STOUT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!! When I saw this bad boy on the shelf I was ecstatic. I rushed home and poured a 12 oz. bottle into my prized tasting snifter. There was a creamy mocha colored head that slowly settled, with a good amount of lacing on the inside of the glass. The actual color of the beer was jet black, absolutely devoid of any light penetrating the brew itself. The aroma was amazing, dark chocolate notes along with roasted malts. The taste was absolutely exquisite. Very smooth, not a hint of alcohol, with tastes of chocolate malts, espresso, and a subtle hop background. This beer is definitely one to stock up on and enjoy throughout the cold winter months."
"D: I would love to try this beer again and share it with a stout fan. My dad would have been the perfect guy to share this one with."
"Prost!"
"Overall a pretty drinkable beer."
"D: Very very tasty, but probably not something you'd session, obviously. One of my favorites, for sure."
"Overall, a fantastic, complex ale that will knock your socks off with it's aroma/flavors as well as it's ABV. Not for the lighthearted, this is definitely something to be savored."
"Pours a thick jet black with some reddish purple hues in light with 1 finger of creamy tan head, good retention, nice lacing as well as some oily residue. Smells of chocolate, dark fruits, roasted malt, licorice, and coffee. Tastes of chocolate, roasted malt, raisins, figs, and cherries with a finish of anise, espresso, and a slight alcohol kick. Medium full in body, low in carbonation. Smooth and creamy with nice chocolate and roasted notes and a good bitterness. Dangerously easy to drink, more of a hearty dessert beer for me, but it can hold its own against any of the harder to find RIS."
"I've been drinking Old Rasputin for years. It's one of my favorite standby beers for long winter nights when I feel like drinking something dark and strong. The flavor is bursting with roasted goodness, yet it's still smooth and creamy with an easy drinkability. Strong aroma of fresh roasted grains, chocolate, coffee, and spice. NOt overly hopped like some stouts, but well balanced. And it's just as good during warm weather. Black as midnight. Great beer."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is nice, but the alcohol is on the high end and does limit this brew."
"All in all, fans of barleywine and malt with adore this brew. On the other hand, I dislike it."
"Poured a very thick and dark blackish hue with a deep tan head. Smelled of chocolate and maybe currants? The taste offers a sharp coffee-like bitterness that balanced the sweetness. Let it warm a little and of course it gets even better. This is becoming a go-to RIS for me as it's readily available, year-round no less. Some of the other breweries would do well to take a lesson from Northcoast and offer a pleasant RIS 12 months a year!"
"Find a place in the rotation for this one. It lives up to the mysterious nature of it's namesake. Perhaps best with a sirloin, or a strong flavored roast."
"Poured out of the bottle an opaque black through which no light would pass. Cascades into the glass too, damn! Voluminous, foamy, three finger head of brown bubbles displayed nice retention with very sticky bands of lacing like mocha garters all the way down my glass. Rich aromas of sweet malts, roasted malts, coffee and some alcohol. Flavors were also fearless, lots of freshly roasted coffee, roasted malt and a high hop bitterness. Some unsweetened chocolate appears as the brew warms and the 9% ALC becomes more apparent. Very smooth on the palate with a perfectly balanced malt/hop ratio and low carbonation helping to give this one a high drinkability. Bold and almost evil in character, this beer is everything a Russian Imperial should be and not for the faint of heart."
"Overall: good, but after Stone IRS what else is there?"
"i poured this little bottle of magic into a snifter. pours a thick black with a solid two finger burlap colored head that stayed thick for at least five minutes, i got a little floating island of head down to the bottom. nice lacing. the smell is great hints of coffee chocolate,brown sugar, molasses with a hint of alcohol. the flavor of this beer is great. i get hit by the chocolate, nice and bitter, i can feel a bit of the alcohol in the back of my mouth. full flavor. the subtle aftertaste lingers for quite some time. great mouthfeel. the beer is an easy drinker. with the scents and the variety of flavors on this beer i would say its a journey. i would love to cook with this sometime."
"I have had a lot of amazing russian imperial stouts over the last years and this one is closer to the top than the bottom. The best ive ever had usually have a tad more hop bite to balance out the deathly malt and chocolateiness."
"Amazing beer! This is a so called ""must try""."
"Four 12oz bottles for $9 from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours black, with a good head. Very good lacing. Rich nose of malts and hops. First taste is strong and warm, but the main taste is hurt by what feels like too much alcohol, so it goes down hot - and I typically have no problem with big beers. Tangy flavour. Nice lingering hop and malt aftertaste. Overall, I'm not actually enjoying this one too much. I will let its brothers age."
"Welcome to the darkest, most ominous beer ever made. Opaque color invites you to take a dive into this abyss and lose yourself in the black waters. Deep dark chocolate aroma with coffee notes. Dark chocolate lounges on the tongue with malty aftertaste that becomes even deeper and more intriguing than the initial flavor. Deep chocolate indulgence with 9% ABV that disguises itself as an ordinary stout. The soul of Rasputin has blessed this brew to make it extraordinary."
"M,D: The heaviness is balanced by nice active carbonation and the only thing leaving me from giving a five on drinkability is the bitterness. Excellent"
"I think this is a very drinkable Imperial Stout. I was expecting it to be harsh because there's no way to tell how old it is. However, that isn't the case. I better pick up some more to age while it's still available. As for personal preferences, it does have that creaminess in the mouthfeel that I desire and a good balance of roasted malt and hops. Excellent."
"A kingdom within a 12 oz serving. A plethora of generosity expressed through a robust, chocolate-expresso environment. Sweet syrup delivered crisp. An aroma to inebriate the senses, a behemoth of flavor. Bitter toward the rear; an invaluable balance to the grand, indulgent flavor provided up front. Spectacular! A beacon of light that illuminates Russian Imperial Stouts, the royalty of dark beer."
"D- There is 9% in here somewhere. Pairs great with dessert or an chocolate. Definitely a great, widely available russian impy."
"Drinkablity-Not as heavy as the color would indicate. But I think 2 wouild be more the enough. Alcohol is nicely hidden but noticable. Currently second fav RIS behing Stone."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the menacing color and creamy head of this beer. Very drinkable and enjoyable, but don't let the 9% ABV creep up and kick your ass."
"D- smooth, great taste, well balanced and without the burning that one would expect from something with 9% ABV. i could, and have, drink this one all night before i get sick of it. an obvious classic (i think its on BA top 100 list) that any stout lover should check out."
"If you havent tried it and love dark stouts this one is for you."
"Drinkability: I'm glad we got this beer back in south Louisiana. This is one of the best drinking stouts around. A blessing brought over from the west coast!"
"One of my all time favorites. This one was enjoyed during a huge saturday breakfast, and it makes me feel bad for all those poor suckers drinking coffee today."
"Should be a mainstay in everyone's fridge, fo sho!"
"Drinkability: I'm not finished with the first one but ooooh is it good and the stress of my day is melting away, a sipping brew, 2 of these will loosen up an evening for sure."
"D: Drinkable but I'm not sure I could drink more than one in a sitting due to the ABV and the overall thickness of the brew."
"Old Rasputin will always be especially special to me as it was not only the first craft beer I ever had, but also the first Imperial Stout I ever had, which is now my favorite style. This is the beer that got me hooked on beer, and it is still one of my all time favorites."
"Drinkability: Lower in abv% than other RISs, and pretty interesting. A well crafted beer, especially if you like the darker, more highly-toasted RISs."
"I will buy this again when I get outside MS."
"This is a special beer and I'm glad I picked up a 4 pack. They should age nicely."
"mouthfeel is thinner than most RIS, but makes up for it with the abundance of flavors, bitter, roasty and creamy with hot alcohol and hop finish, a very nice RIS :D"
"D - This is a big, intense brew, one certainly being enough. Finishing the glass might be a chore, though the flavors are very much in harmony with each other."
"Very enjoyable, but definitely a sipper. This is the perfect dessert beer!"
"With a pitch black pour and a good inch thick head, Old Rasputin looks mighty fine! Great lacing on the beer as well; the nose is pretty much loaded with dark chocolate malts. There is a great bittering chocolate taste and hints of coffee initially, while the beer ends with a bitterness from the hops and coffee. The bitterness is simply addicting, and is making me want to drink it. The alcohol is completely covered up! The beer is thick and slightly creamy, solid for a RIS. There is a lot of flavours in the beer, and it's definitely drinkable."
"Overall this is my favorite Imperial Stout."
"me oh my, why i waited so long to try this i have no idea, but i pity myself for not. pours as black as a december night, no light can pass through, a yummy brown thick head lingers around for while too. smell is awesome, very strong and potent some sweet malt aroma as well as a smokey flavor. taste is a like a smoke porter almost, has a bacony flavor to it, and who doens't love bacon. mouthfeel is perfect, i love thicker, more syrupy beers and this one has it, drinkability is lower just because of its potentancy"
"Poured on tap into a snifter. Light khaki head with a lot of lace. Tastes like saltwater toffee, coffee, chocolate, slight bitter hop. Full bodied and beautiful. Creamy and smooth. Just a slight alcohal bite. Very drinkable and would definately have again."
"My motto is the darker the better, and this time I have met my match. I have heard about Ol' Rasputin and as soon as I stumbled across this fine brew I purchased a couple. Drawn to the great name and label I was intrigued in the high alcohol content. Pours easily with a thin head. This beer is very aromatic and has a thick consistency. The flavor is wonderfully complex to say the least. I was very surprised to discover that the overall flavor hides the strong alcohol content really well. To date this is the best stout I have ever enjoyed. I Will definately keep a few of these in stock for my personal enjoyment. \Additional rating on 12-10-07 of (2) cellared bottles, exact age is uncertain. Opaque, rich brown pour with a 1"" thick lasting dark tan head and amazing lacing. Aromas of dark bitter chocolate, chilled coffee, and sharp hops. Alcohol is detectable to the nose. This beer is very full bodied and bitter-sweet. Thick and creamy with a light alcohol burn and smooth finish. Rich flavors of coffee, fudge, burnt and nutty malts. Large chocolate presence and a firm bitterness, the hop flavor really breaks through once the beer warms up some. One of the the first imperial stouts I sampled, and after a couple years it still remains high on the list."
"D - Love this one. Like to save'm for the right times."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours an opaque dark black body with over an inch of light brown head that slowly dissipates. Smells roasty, with strong baker's chocolate, caramel, and a tinge of citrussy hops. Tastes very roasty with dark chocolate, hints of caramel and toffee, and just enough grassy/citrussy hop flavor and bitterness to balance the malt. Hints of alcohol in both the mouthfeel and flavor. Rich creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. A solid flavorful RIS for sure. I'd love to see how it ages."
"Recommended for fans of stouts."
"Drinkability- If you like RISs, this is probably the best mass-produced one."
"The mouth isn't too heavy...but, it IS slick, full bodied & substantial. This is a MUST try if you like Russian Imperials. It has a great taste and good price too for the quality. cheers! drink this one ice cold."
"Glad I got the chance to try this. The alcohol was a little bit overpowering as it needed more of a balance. I'd buy this again. Let it age a bit and share with friends."
"D-More of a after dinner beer, not something I would sit down and have a couple of."
"The 9% ABV limits the drinkability (for me), but warrants a frequent visit."
"D-1 of these in a setting is more than enough, that being said, this is an explosion of the taste buds and should be consumed at a moderate rate. The quality and time invested is evident."
"Poured from bottle to glass. Smells choclatey. Rich black opaque appearance. Nice head that rings around the glass until the last sip. Nice bite at first but balanced with smooth mouthfeel. Nice chocolate malt aftertaste lingers. This beer is really put together well. I wish I were more versed in beer reviews, but I'm not, and can't possibly describe the other complexities contained within this one beer. There's a lot of good stuff goin on."
"D: Incredible drinkability, warm, luscious, full bodied and complex warming up to release a whole new layer of flavors and complexity."
"Poured out of a bottle into a glass. Had a pretty nice color and a great dark head. Tasted great and left a nice thick coating on the back of my throat (which I really like). Mouthfeel was awesome with a nice creaminess to it. As far as drinkability I give it a 2 thumbs up. I will definitley be bringing this one to the counter again."
"d: a great Istout"
"This beer is straight on for the style. Very well distributed, and priced competitively."
"Pricey. By all means, try it if you can find it."
"Drinkability is beyond great. You can down a few of these in one sitting, get a nice buzz and just be happy for the rest of the afternoon. It doesn't matter what season it is, this stuff is great any time of the year!"
"D - Nothing sublte about this stout... Overwhelming to the senses... A little to aggressive for my liking..."
"Good thing I take quick notes because this beer didn't stay in the glass very long. I'll be having many more of these!"
"All in all, an amazing beer experience."
"The look reminds me of a quote from the movie ""GO"" - ""Bitch was black as night!"" Ok, maybe it was the darkest brown imaginable, but dark nonetheless. Developed a three finger head that spilled over the top of the glass with an amazing cascading effect that would make any Guinness lover proud. Lacing is thick and chunky to the bottom. Aroma of coffee, a bit of chocorama, and some nice hop bitter character which was a pleasant surprise coming to the nose of such a dark ale. Taste off the bat was of bitter roasted malt, followed up by some strong espresso, a bit of sweet burnt caramel, and finished off with a nice dry chocolate tinge. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Full-bodied to say the least. Carbonation is excellent for such a thick brew."
"Sublime and drinkable as anything I have ever had, the glass was drained far too soon on this one."
"Great stout!"
"M&D: The mouthfeel is outstanding. Creamy and rich, with a perfect amount of carbonation. This is a very good RIS. 9% ABV is just right. Wouldn't session this, but sipping on a couple of these to end a night is just what the doctor ordered. Skal."
"Congrats to North Coast for a splendid offering!"
"Excellent beer to finish a meal, especially with a piece of dark chocolate."
"D: I wish I had bought more, I have about finished this one and it is my last. I could drink these the rest of my life."
"Yummy! Pours Very Dark with a dark brown head. Dry roast and coffee aroma. Nice sweetness with a little bitter hops kick. Complex initial taste has a strong dark fruit presence with bitter chocolate, coffee, and licorice. Head laces from top to bottom and the overall retension hints at a decent amount of hopping. I love the balance of this beer."
"D: The cleaner finish makes this one very drinkable for a RIS. I don't know that I would knock back a 4 pack of these in a sitting, but for the style it is remarkably drinkable."
"Great beer. I love the strong coffee presence in the flavor and the other subtleties that come along with it. Unlike many other Imperial Stouts, I can drink a couple of these. It's usually pretty cheap too."
"In the taste there is a lot more coffee than I had thought from the aroma. The roast also takes a front seat, while the sweet chocolate nose is lost in the taste. There is also some strong hop bitterness to it. The alcohol begins to come through on the end of it, and it has an extremely dry finish. The flavors really do not quite blend together as nicely as they should, but it is still excellent. The body is medium-full, and the carbonation works for it. Very good brew."
"D- A very good beer and very drinkable. Although you notice the alcohol it is well balanced by the malts. You could chalk me up for a few of these at a time."
"Drinkability- One of the most enjoyable RIS Ive ever had this one just melts in your mouth, definitly a repeat buy."
"Very complex stout. Pours almost black with a very frothy tan head that leaves substancial lacing. This is like silk in the mouth--almost like drinking cream. Except its beer. Aromas of caramel roasted malt on the nose. Very potent starts spanish espresso strong coffee with a definate burst of alcohol. Good carbonation tingles the throat. Background notes of very bitter chocolate. Bitterness lingers a bit. A sipping beer not for the faint of heart. A good beer to drink when you're lost in thought or just trying to tune out the outside world."
"Thanks North Coast!"
"This is the real deal when it comes to Russian Imperial Stouts being made in America."
"Thick sandy head, with dense bubbles float above an opaque mahoghany chalice of Old Rasputin. A great coffee roasted, toasted molasses smooth flavor and rich body, with a smoky aftertaste, define imperial stouts. Vanilla, oaky flavors give way to a spicy bitter finish as the beer warms. It becomes drier and maltier and tastier near the end. I love this beer, if you hadn't noticed."
"Overall very drinkable, I look forward to taking a trip up the coast and visiting this brewery later this summer."
"Overall, an excellent stout. Strong dark malt, chocolate flavors with a great bitter finish. My bottle started with oddly high carbonation, but after a few minutes the carbonation settled. Great taste though. Full body with a nice bitter finish. Well balanced and strong."
"D: This is a drinkable version of a Russian Imperial Stout. Most are too much, but his is just right with the mouthfeel and the flavor being not too rich, etc."
"Hooray Beer!"
"I will be drinking this again. Now I can say that I understand the hype surrounding this beer!"
"Nice and dark yet light in mouth feel. Chocolate + chocolate + more chocolate is super nice and roasty. Old Rasp Stout drinks like a cool cappichino. A bit heavy on the alcohol and light on the hopps, however a great....no....fantastic nutty Imperial Russian stout if you ask me;) I think that the only thing missing is a bit heavier mouth. When I say that it's ""light," what I'm really trying to say is that it's not very thick, but warm and thinner than I'd like to see from this Russian Imperial Stout. Delicious! Who could ask more of a fine beer that's ready to go out of Blackfoot, Idaho? NOTHING:)"
"Night Tripper, Czar, and Stone RIS tied for First. Siberian Night and Old Rasputin tied for 4th, and Ten FIDY and Expedition tied for 6th. Based on these results I've changed my numbers."
"This is an amazing beer that will stand up to food, or survive aging, like a fine port."
"D- I full flavored RIS. Though I wish the aroma was stronger, this one is a keeper."
"Poured out of the bottle a very very dark colour...wouldn't call is black...maybe deep chocolate, with a tan head that disappeared slowly. My nose predicted aromas of chocolate, coffee, caramel, and just a hint of hops. A superb blend from North Coast to make this Russian Imperial Stout one of the best."
"Old Rasputin on nitro is wickedly different from the bottle, and like the vile priest himself, sneaks up on you and gets under your skin. I had two pints before I knew what was happening. Taste at your own risk!"
"Overall, this is a very nice RIS. The nitrotap made it quite interesting. Not as complex in the malt profile as some I have had. This is definitely a staple in my beer collection."
"Such a good imperial, you can never go wrong with this beer. Had it the first time in Fort Myers. Srved it slighty chilled in my Samuel Smith pub glass. Poured a bittersweet choclate brown with a milk chocolate colored head that left some fine lacing. Aromas of roasted malts and baker's chocolate waft my nose. Taste has the alcohol edge in the finish with smokey, roasted chocolate malts in the front. A great after dinner quaff."
"The taste blew my mind. Jeez. This is exceptional. The hops were a pleasant surprise. What an amazing complexity! Thick and velvety smooth on the tongue this beer goes down way too easy for a 9%er. I could totally go for another right away! World Class."
"MF&D - Full bodied and sticky. A lip smacker after every sip. I think Rasputin has cast a spell on me. Pour some over vanilla ice cream, I did! Highly recommended."
"Pours near black on the pour with a nice half inch head. Smell is hops, roasted coffee and some dark malts. Taste is just way too much hops for my liking. Just not my style. I prefer my stouts on the unhoppy side. I appreciate it, but just not for me."
"The appearance is jet black. Period. The smell is complicated; chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, molasses, the whole nine yards. The smell is like a flower garden in hell. Figure it out. The taste is complex and mechanical like something from a Tim Burton movie but with a twinge of bitterness due to the high Abv%. Mouthfeel is thick and strong as it should be. Drinkability I'm going to have to say is not as high as other Stouts. Simply due to the sharpness and complexity, you just can't pound these down, you have to enjoy one or two of them and think about it for a while."
"Pours pitch black into a pint glass. The head is medium sized and tan in color. Smells of toasted grain. Taste is rich, molasses, espresso, and chocolate. There is an earthy hop presence as well. The beer is quite well balanced with the malt sweetness, and the bitterness from the specialty malts and hops. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels are a bit high though. The alcohol presence is minimal, this is quite a drinkable beer. One of the best tasting RIS's I have had, highly recommended."
"Had this on nitro tap at the Yard House PBG, FL. Poures an amazing motor oil black with a foamy frothy nitro head that stays the entire time, Beatiful looking beer. The smell was pretty intense with ints of malty molasses prunes and also a bit of chocolate in the nose. Taste was even better, roasted malt character that goes down very smooth with hints of oak in there as well. This is a damn fine stout one of the best that I have ever tried and just amazing on Nitro tap."
"Feels like someone stroking the back of my throat with a velvet finger. Goes down nicely, clearly a sipper, but one I could sip for a while. I wonder how it will go with my corn dogs."
"After looking at my empty glass, a large, sticky ring holds strong at the top of the glass and leaves some spider web like lacing. Real cool looking."
"drinkability: finishes nice and clean after the nice big toasty maltiness pretty damn good."
"Taste is very creamy with a good roasted malt presence, chocolate is more prevalent than the smell indicated which adds a good deal of sweetness, the alcohol is well hidden unlike some RIS's that I've had, good level of carbonation that's not too low or too high to ruin any creamy smoothness, easily my go-to RIS now that it's available in Maine."
"Wonderful example, even if it's a very big example. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability- Wow. Nitro tap is the way to go on this delicious elixer. I will be ordering this again before it's too late."
"Pronounced coffee smell and taste, like a smooth expresso with assertive hops. Has a reasonably light mouthfeel for a stout, and is not overly alcoholic in taste. Really smooths out a lot when it warms up."
"D-One of my faves especially around the holidays.Very well made,worth eleven bucks a 4-pack."
"D: I couldn't have more than one of these. Far too 'hot' to enjoy with the overwhelming sensation of alcohol. Definitely needs to mellow out a bit. Would like to revisit this beer after some down time, as it obviously has impressed many people. Not my favorite RIS by a longshot, though."
"This beer is unreal. One of the best stouts I have ever had. It's something I will reserve for special occasions."
"Nice work. Probably better for winter months than spring and summer. And the acidity lowers its drinkability, because that gets a little old. But it's a very good stout. And the alcohol is really well hidden, so watch out!"
"D - had this one at the end of the night and was hugely impressed by it. i can't wait to try it again."
"Black in color the beer poured a 1"" thick light brown head that dissipated slowly (and never completely). The nose had scents of roasted coffee, raisins and bitter chocolate. The palate was concentrated though light on its feet. While nice, similar to the nose, the palate was fairly simple. It did build nicely from the front palate into the midpalate and then lingered with a bitter chocolate flavor. Overall, it was very nice though rather simple."
"Notes: Normally I don't bother adding a 2nd review of a beer just because I get it from a different source (i.e., on-tap vs. the bottle). But having this on the nitro tap made for a substantially different experience and I was glad I'd brought pen and paper along to memorialize that experience. Truly excellent -- on more than one occasion I took a sip, shook my head and said something like ""damn, that is one excellent beer."" Kudos to the Lionheart for getting this. . . ."
"Fine brew from a fine brewer."
"D: Damn this was good. I am going to go back again this week for more. Yes I can stop whenever I want. Glad I got a small one though. The drinkability was off the charts and I would not be able to restrain myself. Thank god they had liquid gold from capt lawrence to ween me off this."
"I emptied mine into a Chimay glass, revealing a thick black brew with a tan head that dissipated to form what I could only describe as a nebula pattern, continually evolving due to a nucleus of constantly emerging bubbles. This beer is ALIVE. And alive with flavors, as well. Dark roasted malt, chocolate, hint of fruit, coffee; sweet and rich with a bitter, dry finish. A veritable meal in a glass."
"I like the style but not fond of the particular one. I do think it reflects the style's representation."
"A classic big stout that is thankfully available year round. Cheers!"
"Eric"
"As an imperial stout, this beer's alcohol content is appropriately high. The glass seemed to disappear much quicker than I anticipated. I would definitely have another, but two would be my limit for one session. I would most certainly have one tomorrow. However, more than two in one sitting would toss me over the edge. Any fan of this style can enjoy and respect this creation."
"Thought I'd try this highly rated brew and was dissapointed. Pours good and looks ok in the glass. Smell was too much coffee on the nose and the first sip confirmed the smell. Overpowering burnt coffee taste for me. Also the beer was too thick and as I find with American stouts, too fizzy. It's ok enough and I'd like to try it on tap (or aged), but why the A?"
"D: At first I thought it would be a little hard to swallow with the smell being so bad and the alcohol being very present but it really does mellow out and becomes a lot more drinkable as time goes on. I suggest watching out for the quick rising head and let it air out for about 5-10 minutes before you take your first sip."
"After trying many other russian imperial stouts I would have to say this one is worthy of an occassional buy, but doesn't stand out among the elites."
"D= As I said, this is one serious, killer beer. I wouldn't want more than 2 or maybe 3 in an evening, but its definitely worth the effort to find some of this!"
"""Never Say Die!"" Sez so on the four-pack. Incredible brew."
"Bottle has about 6 months in the cellar. Pours opaque dirty oil black with a carmel, tightly wound two fingers worth of pillowy head. Head holds nicely, leaving thick tracings of lace across the glass. Smell is dark chocolate, cherry syrup, buscuit, a bit of piney floral hop still coming through and some alcohol. Taste is cocoa powder, espresso, chocolate cake, a bit of grainy earth finish (this is most likely the death of the hops) with a hint of alcohol across the back of the throat. Fantastic! Creamy, coating mouthfeel. Love it fresh, seems to be aging very nicely!"
"D - Overall this is a very tasty beer. The aftertaste is a little too noticeable for my tastes, but it won't keep me from buying this again."
"D- Very easy to drink be careful."
"This beer is wonderful. It pours black with expresso brown head that dissipates quickly leaving a sticking lasing to my glass. Smell is of roasted malts, expresso, deep soil and black powder. Taste is similar to its smell of expresso (most prominent) and roasted malts and warming alcohol aftertaste. Love this brew anytime I'm craving a stout i go for Rasputin."
"It is a very smooth and drinkable beer; however, due to its thickness and high alcohol content, I do not think that I could drink very many of these in one sitting. Nonetheless, it is definitely one of the best stouts I have sampled thus far."
"D: If you like heavily hopped Imperials, this is your beer. I like them a little more balanced. Still a very nice representation of the style. After drinking this, I had one of the worst headaches I've ever experienced. And I only drank one."
"Note: Third time's the charm. Tonight (4/7/08) I had the third bottle out of the 4-pack. Really enjoyed it as a dessert beer. Aftertaste is fairly strong, smoky and bitter, but all-in-all, a very enjoyable brew. High ABV was just the right accompaniment to working on my tax returns."
"Poured from the bottle into my Stella Artois chalice. Pours a deep brown -almost black with a chocolate brown head. Smells like chocolate and coffee. Taste is quite good. Very well balanced between the chocolate and coffee. Hops and malts are very well balanced in this one. Mouthfeel is very creamy. Don't know if I could drink more than one of these at a time, but if I had to, I wouldn't be opposed to it. One of the better imperial stouts that I've had in a while."
"overall, wow i loved this, if it wasnt so expensive (about $2.50/bottle i believe) id have it in my fridge more often deffinatly a very solid brew"
"Drinkability: The beer was very large. A person would not feel tempted to consume much of this beer in one sitting. However, not much of this imperial stout is required to content a person's senses."
"Pours a jet inky black with a nice tan head that sticks to the side of the glass, your esophagus, and coats the intestines. Milk chocolate, espresso, and alcohol; put all of that in a pot and slow roast it and you're getting close to the nose on this one. Espresso oils are first and most prominent throughout. Chocolate sweetness makes an appearance and a balanced alcohol and hop bitter finish take you home. There is a lot to this beer and you can focus on something different every sip."
"This poured with a medium brown head and had a very nice chocolate scent. The texture was thick and heavy, as you would expect, but it wasn't overly strong or too heavy like Rogue's imperial stout. It had tons of bittersweet/dark chocolate flavor with a bit of hops in the aftertaste. The alcohol wasn't too apparent, and there actually wasn't much coffee in the flavor either. It was super smooth and overall very well balanced, which made this surprisingly easy to drink. A wonderful drink - maybe my favorite stout to date?"
"M/D - Rich, creamy, and smooth. Moderate carbonation. Very very good"
"From a 12oz bottle. Black as night, tan head that lingers forever. Thick and creamy. Smells and tastes of espresso, dark malts, chocolate, and some subtle hops. Pretty dry, thick and creamy. Definitely not for the faint of heart. Paid $2.50 for this sucker and would gladly pay again. Great for the winter time, but I could do this in the summer too!"
"D - Old Rasputin isn't for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed it. It's a good beer to sit down and invest yourself in. I don't think I could have more than a couple of these before I had to call it a night. It's a beer I would love to have again."
"This will become a favorite in the RIS style; easy to enjoy, and equally dangerous. The beer is much easier to take down than the legend of the individual."
"D- Oh, I could have one or seventy more."
"D: Yes please. Give me a cold evening, a fire, and 2 Rasputins. This is a treat that I could only enjoy once in a while."
"D - Drinkability is very good. North Coast hit it out of the park with this one. Recommended."
"A classic in my book."
"D - This is my ""if you had one beer to drink for the rest of your life"" beer. And for the 4 pack price at Wegmans in Princeton, NJ of $6.99 (it's now $7.99; glad I stocked up) it's a bargain."
"First tried this about a year ago before I started reviewing, and have been meaning to get back to it. Seriously glad I did, and I waited to damn long. Pours black with red hues. Has a good two-finger creamy tan head. Great retention and lacing. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes of caramel and toffee at the forefront followed by a slight hop bitterness that fits in perfectly. Being a neophyte, the complexity of the smell and taste is more than I can tackle description wise. Mouth-feel is sinewy, creamy and smooth. Probably the tastiest stout I've ever had. You can tell someone put some effort in this bad boy. Sprints head to head to the finish with the Rogue Shakespeare stout being edged out by a length."
"D - Dangerously drinkable, had I several more of these I'd be content. Amazing brew that honestly impressed me in every aspect. Reco."
"A superb west coast Imp. Russian Stout indeed"
"Overall a very nice RIS , highly recommended."
"Poured from a bottle, this is a very dark stout. It's as black as any I've ever had and the head that forms is a solid tan. The nose is mostly roasted malts and coffee with a bit of hops. The flavor is more of the same, but with greater intensity. The hops really come out in the aftertaste. I'd say this is one of the hoppier Imperial Russian Stouts that I've had. Surprisingly, at 9% ABV, there's no aroma or taste of alcohol. It's completely overwhelmed by the malt and hops. The mouthfeel isn't as thick as most Imperial Russian Stouts, which is neither a good or a bad thing. It just is. I'd rate the drinkability higher, but the hoppiness of this one gets to me after a while. I still recommend this one highly."
"D- Kind of filling, and after a few I wouldn't recommend driving. I'd say one is enough, but that one is oh so delicious."
"A fantastic brew, not quite the best RIS I've had(darkness...so far) but the mere fact that North Coast makes it widely available all year long hitches it up a notch."
"D = I really liked this and would definitely recommend it. Could not imagine drinking more than one though given the strong bitterness in the finish and the heavy feel of the drink not to even mention the ABV."
"D- Let me just put it out there that I am not a huge RIS fan. I like them from time to time, but they aren't my bread and butter. This seemed a lot less menacing than some of the other ones out there so i'd say this is a good one for people who are looking to get into the style."
"Drinkability: Typically, big, high ABV beers do not get high drinkability ratings for me. However, this one is an exception. I like malty beers and this one has what I like in spades. I was surprised to see this in Nebraska, and am happy that this RIS is a permanent part of the line up (usually I see this as a seasonal or one off beer)."
"I am going to have another!!"
"Side note: I had that at Bada Boomz in downtown Indianapolis. I originally asked for a Stone IRS (2004), which they had on their menu but were out of. The waitress gave me this instead and told me the bartender said it was pretty much the same thing. I was pretty pissed by that."
"You can kill the beer, but not the buzz it gives you. Great beer. Not as good as Red dawn, but good."
"A vision of loveliness, to be sure. Dark black coffee with a thin creamy head and slightly sticky brown sugar lacing forms as I sip from a fancy 12 oz. tumbler. I smell cinnamon...It's hidden, but it's there. Of course, I get a hint of coffee and powerful dose of molasses. The flavor is predominantly coming across on the back of my tongue as sweet, bitter, roasted and balanced accordingly. How drinkable? Too drinkable!"
"The flavor is full of malty goodness but it is a bit spoiled by a burnt and bitter aftertaste. Alcohol heat is also noted. Carbonation and the body are spot on leaving a creamy mouthfeel that is an awesome part of RISs. The ABV and cost hurt drinkability. A very good RIS but it is not my favorite."
"A very good beer and i have another one. i think i am going to age it for a year and come back and do an update on it."
"This beer is awesome. One of my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts. If you are new to this style I would recommend this beer, as it is true to style, and is also a most excellent beer. Careful though, at 9% it will eventually catch up with you."
"Man i could drink this all night but at 9% rasputin is a sneaky one that can creep up on you quick. Drink with caution my friends."
"Would come back to this one definitely after trying out some others."
"Drinkability - I was expecting a lot from this brew, and needless to say I was not disappointed. Drink with respect or Rasputin will put you to sleep."
"D - Excellent. Had to force myself to slow down."
"Finishes dry with a roasted coffee and caramel and hoppy aftertaste. Very impressive beer and pleasantly surpised by the amount of hops. Very nice and somewhat unique representation of the style. I think I'll have another. Cheers!!"
"Tastes like smoke flavor with some overly sweetened burned coffee thrown in."
"D - Close to ideal when it comes to affordable russian imperial stouts."
"One of these is fine for me. I probably won't rush out to buy this again soon, although it is a pretty good value compared to trying to track down the elusive RIS's. I could see myself picking this up if I happened to have a craving for espresso in beer. I would give the nitro-tap a try though. I suspect it would improve a bit."
"D: So tasty, it demands multiple servings. The ABV might be high but the nitro-tap makes it go down so smooth, you don't feel it until you realized you've finished the darn glass in record time."
"I love this stuff."
"D - This is a benchmark for the style IMO. I could (slowly) drink these all night. Warm and inviting and probable one of the best RIS I'm had. Highly recommended."
"D: Smooth sipping, though big enough to take at just one or two at a time. I'll be trying it out again."
"This beer poured pitch black with a big steady three-finger dark tan head that remained for the whole time I drank the beer. The smell is mostly roasted malts with some chocolate and coffee notes with the chocolate becoming more prominent as the beer warmed. This beer doesn't screw around, the taste starts off with sweet chocolate that's quickly dispersed by some bitter coffee taste and finished by a punch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and slippery with some warming from the alcohol. This is a very powerful beer, which means I couldn't imagine drinking more than one at a time but not for lack of quality."
"Had this on tap last night at Deep Ellum. I saw they had this on nitro tap, so I figured it was worth a re-visit. Pours with a huge frothy head, that unfortunately got so big that it spilled onto the table. The smell was what I expected, a symphony of roasted coffee and chocolate. The taste was even more delicious. I have had this beer before on tap, and I love it. But the nitro makes it that much more smoother and silky. Tastes like a chocolate imperial stout milkshake. Goes down way too fast for a 9% beer. One of my favorite RIS on the market. The nitro makes it that much better."
"D: note, do not session, might end up with headache, bloated stomach, and extreme dehydration...kidding...kind of"
"The beer poured an impenetrable blackness into a chalice with a thin, dark head. The smell was of roasted malt and alcoholic esters. Alcohol was the predominant flavor initially, with roasted malt in the middle and a nice lingering hop bitterness at the end. This is a full-bodied beer, with a great balance between the alcohol, malt, and hop components. Very drinkable."
"great chewy thick mouthfeel as expected with this type of beer, this is a pretty easy drinking RIS, overall a great beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied to thick. Carbonation is excellent and abv is perfect for this beer. It's extremely smooth and drinkable despite the 9% abv. Overall, this is damn fine beer. Highly recommended."
"IMO, Old Rasputin is one of the most underrated beers on the market right now. Just packed with all the flavors you would want in an RIS but in one hugely drinkable package. Plus you can usually find some fantastic prices on this at the store. For the money, one of the best beers on the market."
"Definitely a nice one. It could stand to have the bitterness dialed back a bit to let some of the malt shine through, but I can't complain too much."
"Thick, coffee ice cream-colored head that sticks around for a while. Espresso-dark and thick - coats the mug nicely. Mild, dry aroma with toasted-burnt but pleasant crispy malt. Taste is very dry with slight bitterness on the palate. Deep, dark roasted backbone that's very warming to the senses. Strong espresso roast tones. Slight metallic aftertaste (packaging?). No overly alcoholic flavor - this is very well balanced. This stuff coats the mouth - even though it's a little dry and bitter at times it's very thick and soothing. Very well-made to enjoy in moderation."
"D - I LOVE THIS BEER! So much character!! This is my first Imperial Stout, and I have to be honest, I was a little scared. The aroma almost made my knees shake. BUT, this is very drinkable and I'm enjoying every drop. I'll be picking up a sixer next time."
"A little bit disappointed by this one, good beer, but I find the reputation to be better than the actual product. Pours the standard Imperial black, with a large creamy head and excellent lacing (could see every sip taken). Aroma is strong malts with some light piney hops and even a bit of clove. Taste is of bitter coffee grounds. It has an exceptionally long after taste, with a slightly warming alcoholic finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation is flat. As for the super stouts I feel that this is a good product, but nothing compared to Great Divide's Yeti. Still good, and that is coming from a non-Stout drinker."
"Immediately amazed by the strong head that forms and the lively aroma; aroma is still strong with cocoa and coffee. Flavor is still robust, though certainly not to the degree of a fresh bottle. What strikes me of its difference is it seems a bit thinner in body (though still has good carbonation) and the finish has a bit of a metallic edge to it. But the finish isn't off-putting; in fact, it has a fairly assertive bitterness still. It's leaving thick lace curtains! Getting good chocolate and coffee flavor throughout. Maybe a hint of some woodiness too. I'm pretty impressed with how well this beer has held up and consider it a success."
"my 4th. or 5th. impy ; pours a cherry-coke black w/ a thick brown head which lasts a good bit leaving plenty of lacing in my nonic ; a strong smell of dark caramel, hops and nuts, some fruitiness detected as well ; a rich, malt filled delight w/ hops abound, a coffee-like note runs through the deep roasted/nutty/toasty malts, pleasingly balanced w/ floral hops, a bit of a date/prune type flavor at the finish ; rich med-full body well balanced w/ the flavor, moderate co2 level, enough to support the head and make the flavor last ; an excellent brew, after this one and storm king, i'm tempted to change my fav. style...."
"Drank it at Moan and Dove. It poured out deliciously dark looking and settled to a thin head. Sharp malts were definitely sensed almost with some hops. There was a beautiful sense of roasted flavors overall. The taste had a bitter and creamy attribute to it. It seemed a tiny bit off being so bitter but it was still really enjoyable. The drink was surprisingly thin for a Russian imperial stout. It also had a slightly crisp aftertaste! Overall this was a wonderfully relaxing drink for the evening."
"I sampled this brew out of a 12oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. It poured jet black with a thick frothy dark tan head. LOTS of lacing. Smells like a good RIS. Rich, roasty, and toasty. Taste has bittersweet chocolate notes. Lots of hop bitterness in this beer. Alcohol warms on the tail end. mouthfeel is rich and velvety. I would love to have another but try drinkin many at 9% and you may be in trouble."
"Never thought I'd say this, but this beer was too highly hopped for me. Nice dark espresso color and low carbonation, smelled of caramel malt, but could barely taste it. I love highly hopped beers (Stone's Ruination is a favorite) but not so much with the stouts and this could have been so much more if the malt could come forward a little."
"Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout Pours a dark, dense, brownish black. The smell is roasty and strong of malts. Taste is real good, reminiscent of a melted coffee been, chilled, expresso beer. Clearly a roasted malt with a medium dense mouthfeel. Overall this is beautifully balanced between its smoothness and bold taste. This is a great beer, and for what I've seen the greats beers priced at this is a steal."
"D - At 9.00% ABV, its more drinkable than World Wide Stout, but still not something you can drink on a daily basis. Good beer to complement a desert, although will likely overpower many meals."
"Tasted with 5 other imperial stouts. Pours black with large frothy brown head. The aroma has nice chocolate and coffee with a hint of caramel. The flavor is sweet to start with a bit of bitterness coming after. Nice creamy texture. The finish is a bit short. Easy to drink but not as complex as the best."
"D: I really want to like this beer but the chemical flavors are really off-putting. Tasting was comprised of a newly purchased bottle and one from my cellar. I'll have to give this beer a revisit."
"Sadly, this one isn't what I remembered it to be and it's not even among my top 10 or 15 RIS I've tasted. Tastes too rough, the alcohol is a bit intrusive and it could use a sweeter chocolate taste instead of the dry, dark and bitter taste."
"D- smooth, profound, and very easy to drink, one might go through a bottle so fast trying to decipher it's complexities that a minor dizzied feeling becomes recognizable. on that note, drink the whole 4 pack and i bet old rasputin will be comin for that ass."
"I couldnt even finish my one bottle. I am not sure why this is rated so high, but i think if i drank any more of this it would make me look like the old dude on the bottle."
"In the style, heavy on the espresso and chocolate, but not sweet, yet off-dry. Good mouth-coating density makes this a sipping beer for thoughtful reflection and a hunk of blue cheese."
"Flavor of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee with a great hop bitterness and flavor. Excellent mouthfeel and it also hid it's 9% alcohol well. Just a tremendous beer."
"D-I had this at a tasting, and it was one of my favorites of the evening. The flavors are pleasing, the balance is notable, and it is an all-around good stout."
"Taste is good, but a little raw for my liking. There's a distinct background note of rubber beneath the inital whack of lactic sourness and bitter roast that assaults the palate. Bitter cocoa and milk chocolate. Bittersweet with a schwack of flavour and a big alcohol burn going down. This is still a bit rough for my liking, very flavourful though. Body is heavy, but not too heavy, carbonation is zippy, and finish is dry and satisfying. This is a drinkable stout, is small quantites of course, but it goes down pretty well. This bottle is still a bit rough though, and I'll be cellaring my other bottle to see how it holds up."
"I'll definitely buy this one again and would love to try it on tap."
"Wow! poured out a nice delicious imperial-stout-black. Retains a small 1-finger head for a few minutes. Big aromas of chocolate, coffees, dark malts. Taste is delicious. Plain and simple-cocoas, coffees, burnt malts, alcohol on the finish gives it a biting finish that leaves your palate clean and ready for more. Drinkability is high, the slight alcohol burn lightens the mouthfeel. I forced myself to only have 1, but will return to this beer again."
"A wonderfully rich nose with a surprising hint of -- heather? A dark, hoppy taste gives way to some well-balanced sweetness. An all-around excellent Imperial Stout. No joke -- try it with a Krispy Kreme sour cream doughnut. No, really."
"A good solid beer from North Coast brewing. Well done."
"I would not recommend this for a session. It would be very long night."
"Drinkable sure, I'll be sipping this one for two hours :-)"
"A new stout favorite, for sure!"
"Wonderful Fruity smell with a nice coffee and chocolate nose. Poured into a Westmalle goblet this average looking RIS is thin and dark leaving a dark tan and thin head. The head, however light it is, remains throughout the drink and leaves very nice even lacing all the way down the glass. Strong coffee flavor with the slightest hint of chocolate it has a mouthfeel with a slightly bitter carbonated sting that coats your gullet like castor oil. Alcohol is a bit noticeable but not overpowering and perfectly acceptable at 9% ABV. This is more of a stout than imperial stout in my opinion. I dont see myself getting this one again, but Ill finish out the 4 pack and drink it under varying conditions before my final decision."
"Old Rasputin is a great goto Impy Stout and a great value.. everything one would want from a West coast RIS.. I have some in the cellar just to see how they age, but this brew is great fresh... no doubt one of my favorites."
"D: This a great example of the style. I am definately enjoying this as dessert."
"What a treat this beer was. Poured an extremely deep brown that was almost black with a nice off-white head that didnt hang around too long. Aroma was malty with notes of chocolate and coffee, but is nicely balanced with the hops. Mouthfeel is great and drinkability is pretty good for a beer of 9%abv. Great, great beer."
"Poured black with a light brown thick, foamy, sticky, lasting head. Lacing on glass. Dark bittersweet roasted coffee flavor. Feels creamy in the mouth, like a thin caramel sauce when sipped with the foamy head, but with a mild to medium carbonated bite. Aftertaste is a bitterness on the tongue kind of like a dry coating of bittersweet cocoa powder. Definitely a good beer, with rich, developed flavors."
"D: Great RIS. Easily one of the most ready to drink drinkable."
"This little number was no slouch and it lived up to all of my expectations. It's powerful, flavorful and delightfully nuanced: it's definitely become an all-time favorite and one most stouts should aspire to be more like."
"$3.75 for a bottle at Kennedys Irish Pub and Curry House (which is an extremely strange place). Pitch black pour, with a small mocha head. Malt, dark fruit and licorice in the nose. Huge roasted flavour with chocolate and espresso. The alcohol is a little too apparent for my liking. Huge full palate with perfect carbonation. We have a winner."
"Overall: In the world of RIS, this one just plain kicks ass. It has all of the body and flavor to represent the style with pride, a truly world class beer from North Coast. Very Highly Recommended (But you already knew that... Didn't you?)"
"THE Imperial Stout to beat if youre in Northern California. And while there are a few that approach the overall quality, taste, and experience (e.g. Mikkeller Black Hole) of this delicious imperial, none really match the value for money in this area. Wish it had a bit more head and lacing, but otherwise, the mouthfeel, the smooth blending of the (fairly high) alcohol, and above all the flavor and the aroma, make this a real winner. Have had it in bottles and on draught from Toronado. Biggest critique: how can I get it in 750 ml bottles for cellaring?"
"The Old Rasputin has a dark appearance - no clarity at all - with very little head evident. The smell was low key, sporting some hints of coffee especially. The taste, like other imperial stouts, had coffee and chocolate in it. However, the hops flavor was fairly strong and kind of overwhelmed the others. Mouthfeel was sharp and tingly. In general, this is a drinkable beer. I didn't like quite as much as Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, mainly due to the hops content."
"Drinkablity: Bold and satisfying brew with excellent craftsmanship."
"12 oz brown bottle purchased at Green's in Columbia, SC. Pours a absolutely beautiful jet black with thick dark tan head. The sweet aroma of roasted malt dominates with some alcohol pressence. This is by far the most impressive Imperial Stout I have ever seen or tasted. Taste is very smooth and balanced with expresso, coffee and chocolate notes. The carbonation is moderate. About as close to beer prefection as you can get."
"Note: One of the first ""true"" craft beers that I purchased in college. Bought because of the impressive alcohol content not knowing what I was getting in to. Had a difficult time finishing the 4-pack, but now it is one of my favorite RIS next to Stone."
"Copped this single 12oz short, stout, fat brew from Total Wine and More in West Orange... pours a motor-oil, jet-black color with modest tan head... smell is full of dark, burnt chocolate and espresso... taste is dominated by a cocoa-powder, dark chocolate, black coffee flavor that has an unappealing bitter-sweet aftertaste... the bitterness is very noticeable, and although the 9% ABV is somewhat well-masked behind a strong dark-chocolate flavor, the taste wasn't my favorite for this style... although not bad, wasn't my absolute favorite either... a strong, rich, dark, thick brew with an overwhelming flavor that pulls through noticeably... heard good things about this brew, and although it didn't disappoint, definitely wasn't my favorite represenation of the style... Good enough to recommend... Worth a try if you're a fan of the style..."
"This poured dark black with a nice head. It smelled of toffee, caramel, coffee, and malts. Old Rasputin tastes so smooth, it starts with chocolate and toffee and gives way to coffee after-tones. One of the best mouth-feels I had experienced. This stout was quite a treat, I can't believe it took me so long to finally try one."
"A classic example of the Russian Imperial Stout category. Pours with a dark, black as midnight body with a tannish head. Chocolate, roasted, and bitter malts combine with a hop presence that balances out the whole experience. Truly a beer that exemplifies the style and pairs well with sharp chedder or razorback. Seek out and consume."
"D: This is a great RIS. Very tasty, very balanced, and very drinkable."
"Pours jet black, with a small tan head. In the aroma, caramel, and coffee hints. In the taste, caramel, cocoa, and a roasty coffee flavor. A smooth, big body mouthfeel and a malty, dry coffee aftertaste. Big flavor and hides alcohol very well, smooth and very good."
"Old rasputin pours an impenetrable black with a good one finger light tan head. The nose is very hoppy, but clearly has some java tones. When tasted I am suprised at the strong hop presence. Uniquely hoppy, but still a good malt and dark background. A little bit of coffee flavors but mostly hops on the finish. Does leave a slight sugar coating on the lips. Mouthfeel is slightly thin but still quite good. Drinkability is lowered a bit but for hopheads it should be no problem. Great brew, I am leary to put this in the cellar but I will give a few of them a shot."
"Looks amazing. Straight up black, though turns brown at the edges when held up to a light. One and a half inch khaki head. Impressive lacing. Smell is overwhelmingly sweet chocolate. Amazing. There are also hints of coffee, caramel, and toffee, but they are a bit more subdued. There is also a strong hop presence. Taste - it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's rich and tasty. Huge flavor. Chocolate mostly, as the smell made quite clear. A meal in itself. Great, thick beer with enough carbonation to keep it lively. A great beer to sip and contemplate, read, or enjoy a chat with a close friend. Don't have too many of these. I did a double-take when I saw the ABV - it's very well hidden here. One of my favorites that I will keep coming back to often."
"Pours a dark color that very little light comes through, giving an almost purplish hue. Nose is malty and slightly sweet with a roasted coffee edge. Taste is thick with barely a touch of sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, but smooth. Even at 9%, it's very drinkable. Another smooth brew by North Coast."
"The alcohol is in the taste, but not as strong as it is in the nose. As it warms it is even less apparent. This stout is good. You get a little sweet on the tongue (I assume from the chocolate malts,) a little bitter in the finish, a great balance from the malts all the way through. Very slight carbonation to tickle the tongue and create a great mouthfeel. It warmed me right up on a cold December day as I watched a Flyers game. Definitely something that should be sought after by stout lovers."
"A classic example of a RIS IMO"
"Deep black with brown highlights. Great cascading head that leaves nice lacing. Intense roastiness on the nose as well as some coffee. This has everything a good imperial stout should have: chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, subtle alcohol warmth. A decent hop kick in the finish but it melds into a syrupy sweet chocolate note. Very full bodied, substantial carbonation, no alcohol taste. I'd say this is definitely a tier below the Stone IRSs and Storm Kings of the world, but it's still excellent and widely available to boot."
"Near perfect example of the style. Rich, thick and complex yet balanced and very downable."
"Well done on this beer."
"Like Guinness with a kick, a must try. This has all the smooth taste of a creamy stout with the after kick of bitterness like from arrogant bastards ale. Dark rich coffee flavor with a smokey chocolate hints. This is something to drink very slow and savor."
"This is an old classic and the first RIS that I ever tasted. Rock solid, one of my absolute favorites."
"Drinkability: This is divine. My new favorite for the season. I wish I had a dark chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, laced with vanilla highlights and a few black cherries to go along with this marvel of brewing science and technology. Even alone, each sip is so damn good it beckons you to take another soon. It's time to go back to the packy to buy their entire stock of this beer!"
"D: this is one of my go-to's, good punch and hits the hop craving in the back of my toungue. for a stout, it's lacking the robustness and dynamic layers of malt fruits that balance a beer this intensely hoppy, roasted and alcoholic. it's not inherently drinkable, but does play an enjoyable foil to a night of IPA."
"4.5/3/1/3.5/1"
"Poured into a snifter. Very black beer with a nice, dark brown head that left nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Smelled mostly of coffee and dark malts. Taste started with strong coffee with a bit of alcohol, followed by lots of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. This is a very good, strong, sipping beer."
"A very, very nice Russian Imperial Stout. I'm glad it wasn't one of those over-sweetened stouts that I've had before. Perfect for the upcoming winter season."
"D - Not impressed. It has good flavor but i don't like the finish."
"Yum! A jet black beer, thick looking with a nice creamy head. Smells like love. There's hints of malt and hops in the scent but its light and not overpowering. The taste is amazing for those who like dark beers. You have layers of flavor, malt and hops, even some chocolate hints. Very complex flavor and surprisingly lighter then it looks. The most interesting thing to me is that the flavor out weighs the bitterness in your mouth. All that dark goodness coats your mouth and blends very well. A big, complex beer with a lot going on. Excellent!! Just a little side note, if you do something dumb (like me) and spill some, clean it up quick because its very dark and is hard to get out of the carpet."
"D: Not my favorite of this style, but a solid brew. The flavor has a nice balance with the slight bitterness which in some ways makes it easier to drink. A bit overcarbonated for my taste. This may be more drinkable than other Imperials because the alcohol isn't as big and the flavor isn't as over the top. For me, though, if I'm gonna drink an RIS, I'd just as soon have the huge alcohol and huge flavor."
"Overall, this is a high quality Imperial Stout. Not my ultimate favorite but still excellent."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark almost opaque brown with a chocolate 1 finger head. The head only lasted a few minutes. Smell had hints of oakiness, along with very slight raspberry aromas hiding in the milk chocolate mocha scent. Taste was both dark wheat bread, and burnt chocolate at the same time. Slightly bitter in the mouth with a little acidity on the toungue that detracted from the mouthfeel. Overall was fairly drinkable, but the alcohol content did hit a little stronger than would have been expected."
"Overall this is a stout-lover's dream. Not for a weak stomach, because it has a hefty bitterness and high ABV that shamelessly displays itself in the taste, but it is just one hell of an enjoyable drink. I was planning to follow it up with a pint of Guinness but now I'm thinking it simply won't do my taste buds justice after this."
"D. Pretty strong, otherwise more drinkable."
"Jesus, God... Don't mess with this beer."
"I'm just not a fan of Imperial stouts so I'm just not inclined to rave about this beer. It pours about as black as mud, not much carbonation, some retention, some lacing. The head is dirty brown. The smell is thick, oily, molasses, cherry overtones, dark roasted coffee, and sweet malts. This beer is full bodied, strong, bitter, and not for the faint at heart. Perhaps I'm the faint at heart because I couldn't imagine drinking more than one. I can appreciate the style to a point, but then it is just a strong espresso, molasses, bitter and biting roasted malt brew that just stings in the mid section. On the very tail end, some sweet malts and cherry like flavors emerge, but not until I've been hit over the head by the mid section and beyond of just bitter and strong flavors. As the beer settles a bit, the more warming alcohol notes and the sweeter malts present themselves sooner. The aftertaste is a bit over the top for me as well. The mouthfeel is pronounced and thick, but what do you expect from a beer that pours like dirty oil."
"An excellent representation of this style. FKro."
"I loved this beer. I had to travel an hour west to get the last two bottles that the store had. It was worth the trip and I guarantee you that I'll make it again."
"Drink ability is a little lower due to its rich flavor [it hides the alcohol well] but that is NOT a bad thing! Rasputin makes for a GREAT nightcap."
"Overall this is an excellent stout. I am new to this style of beer, but no doubt hands down this is a favorite of mine. I'm a hop guy and I just loved the upfront hops in this beer. Well done North Coast, cheers to you. I see me drinking a lot of this beer in the future."
"D: Goes down so smooth and easy, this is incredible!"
"d: I'd like to always have some of these in stock. The price is not reflected in the score, but this is a world class beer for a bargain price of less than $2 a bottle."
"D - Is very high great taste I think this is the best beer that I've reviewed yet I think I'll have another after this one"
"Nice, but the aftertaste is slightly unbalanced, dry and hoppy, at least for me."
"Overall, a fantastic example of the style. Great right now, I'm betting it will be astounding with age."
"It was so good I just had to pull out a bottle today and review it again."
"D- a solid stout, very delicious"
"black, like strong coffee, with a cappuccino colored head that really is quite lovely; leaves lacing all the way down the glass and the head maintained the whole time. the taste really is what makes this a great buy and i was happy to find it. at first you get hit with a sweet chocolate taste and then after that one gets the taste of almost a deep burnt coffee that offsets the sweet that initially hits the tongue as i was sitting here typing this the burnt coffee taste has almost transformed into the deep cocoa taste of a deep deep chocolate; this mixed with just the right amount of carbonation that seems to fit the contrasts of tastes very well. I think the whole taste pattern also goes well with the amount of alcohol in the brew as the alcohol sort of hits and adds flavor to the lasting taste. moreover, it really does warm you and make you feel like you just enjoyed that cup of strong coffee."
"Very tasty, helping me bounce back strong from being under the weather yesterday. Easily one of the best stouts I've had, and right at and near the the top of Russian Imperials I've had the good fortune to have tried. Definitely a great find, more than worth the try, and don't make the mistake of buying just one. Get the pack. You won't be sorry."
"A Dark Black Stout that pours heavy with a two or three finger head leaving behind a dark tan lace. Bold flavor of dark roast coffee and semi sweet chocolate finishing with a slight alcohol bite. At 9% this beer should be enjoyed responsibly and drank slowly to experience all of the rich complex flavors. I usually drink one or two of these in a sitting and enjoy them alongside a good cigar and then finishing with my favorite dark chocolate. This is one of my favorite beers of all time and definitely my favorite Russian Imperial Stout. I recently spent painstaking hours translating the Cyrillic writing on the label and found that СЕРДЕЧНЫЙ ДРУГ НЕ РОДИТСЯ ВДРУГ means HEART FRIEND IS NOT BORNE SUDDENLY. I feel that this means that a dear friend is not made overnight, so I recommend that you never drink this beer alone but always try to share one with a friend in honor of the Old Man which had many enemies who tried killing him on several occasions and finally succeeded but not before he had his fill of women and brew. Sounds like a Brother I would have liked to hung out with."
"All the bitterness makes me think this is a fresh bottle. I'd like to see how this ages. I'll try to wait as long as I can but, realistically, I don't see myself holding out past the holidays."
"Big roasty coffeesque beer with a strong bright bitterness that rides through the thick body of the beer and leaves briskly finished that lingers with a bite"
"Just a good beer."
"In the aftertaste some hop bitterness notes, and also a root-like bitterness, and, maybe, artichoke."
"Dark, rich, mellow, smooth, flavorful, not overpowering but yet full of flavor... when it's placed in front of you take your time appreciating it in its glory."
"12 oz bottle, pours an opaque dark brown, with an ample tan head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is rich with molasses, coffee and some chocolate. Notable flavors are coffee, roasted malts, some black licorice and walnuts set in a bitter hoppy backdrop. mouthfeel was medium up front, but it filled-out and left a very full, creamy, satisfying aftertaste by finish. Big finish with mostly dark bitter chocolate flavors. Overall: this is stout the way stout was meant to be. Recommended"
"If you like Guinness, you will probably really like this offering - the high Ba rating attests to this. However, it is not for me. I gave this a 3.0 overall in deference to the style, but based on personal preference I would have gone lower. So there it is. If you like bitter, cooked coffee stouts like Guinness, this may be for you and I urge you to try it. If, like me, you like rounder stouts like Young's Oatmeal Stout or an imperial like Old Heathen, this North Coast offering may not be your cup of tea."
"."
"12 oz bottle into tulip glass. A: Thick and black as oil, thick tan head that retains very well. S: Burnt malts, chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, hops definitely present. T: Very strong bitter chocolate. The immediate taste is sweet caramel, cocoa, and coffee, it immediately turns bitter in a long finish. M: Thick, chewy. D: I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this is pretty great. The bitter chocolate note can be a bit overpowering, but all in all pretty drinkable. Barely noticed the high ABV."
"I can't even describe how much I love this beer. Hands down the best RIS I have had, and maybe the best stout in general."
"this is a really, really great imperial stout. what a beer for a dark, cold, winter night by the fire."
"For an Imperial Stout this beer had quite a head with a slightly subdued aroma. The mouthfeel is terrific and the flavor hid the 9% alcohol well."
"Overall. very good. I would rate this up there with the best of them. can't wait to try this with some good dark chocolate."
"The mouthfeel is full-bodied and quite creamy. Nice and smooth on the palate. Overall, this is a good beer, although I wish it were a tad sweeter, and the roasted malt/hop bitterness combo gets to be a bit wearing."
"D: Tastes even better on tap and a perfect after dinner drink. 1 of these as an after dinner treat or desert is the perfect application for this beer."
"Drinkability: Not sure how RIS and Drinkability will ever go hand in hand. This 9% ABV beer is ean excellent winter warmer. Strong and balanced. One maybe two in the evening and life will be grand."
"A masterpiece!"
"Impressive beer. I applaud North Coast for not dumbing this one down one bit. I'm still not a big fan of the style, but this is my favorite Russian Imperial Stout by a solid margin."
"Drinkability: The owner of Tops Liquor Store in Tempe, AZ suggested this as one of his favorites. I agree as this is a wonderful beer to recommend to others and one that makes the three thumbs up list if having more than a few at one sitting! A real gem!"
"A heavy, slick, almost oily mouthfeel. The drinkability is good if your into kicking back with a slow sipper. This one is definitly not for the faint of heart, and also definitly worth the price and effort."
"Drinkability: Very good RIS which does not fall into the trap of being too overwhelming in terms of thickness and/or ABV. Good complexity to the flavor makes this easy to drink a few of before they catch up with you."
"Pours a rich, deep, dark opaque black color with a cascading tan head that flows from the bottom to the top creating an illusion like a lava lamp. In my slowly deteriorating state I was memorized watching this take place. Smell is of roasted malt, milk chocolate, a cup of cappuccino too. Taste is of chocolate and smokeyness. This one is absolutely smooth and delicious. I only gave it a 4 for drink ability because it was so rich I had trouble toward the end of the glass. If it was only a 12 oz taste I might have had an easier time."
"Bottle poured jet black with an off white head (tan) which turned to a nice coating of lace . The aromas of dark chocolate and roasted malts filled my head thru the snifter. It was wonderfuly full and creamy on the palate . flavors of roasted malt , coco and coffee up front with a light hops finish . Complex is a very good word for this Imperial Stout for the price it is also a great bargin"
"The first thing I thought when I tasted this was wow! This is the stout I've been in search of for a long time. Pours an inky black that doesn't give up any light. Thick fine textured head with a malty, chocolate/vanilla aroma. Incredibly creamy mouthfeel with a rich, robust flavor. Hints of chocolate, vanilla and licorice show their presence here and there. Very complex and tasty. Hides the alchohol very well. Easy to drink and demanding of respect."
"D: A big ass beer. I love it, but I respect it more."
"d- i could have a couple of these in one sitting and from reading some other reviews i will def. be looking for this one on tap."
"From the draft into a pint glass in front of me at the bar. The beer was black as tar with a thick, rich, velvety, creamy, tan head. The beer was given to me with about 3-4 inches of head which settled down nicely. Absolutely a beautiful pour - looked like Guiness only this one has some taste. Very rich smell with hints of coffee, burnt malts, toffee - very complex. Rich chocolatey taste with a great creamy mouthfeel and a nice bit of alcoholic burn. Beautiful beer with a taste to match - great from the bottle - excellent from the tap. If you like stouts give this a try."
"This beer poured a dark thick black with a thick and creamy brown head. It smelled strongly of coffee chocolate and somewhat of alcohol. The flavor here is intense. Dark roasted coffee and dark unsweetened chocolate dominate, there is also a toasted sweetness like roasted marshmallows that are almost burnt(the best kind). The finish is smooth with a touch of alcohol. This is currently my favorite stout"
"WOW, this beer is amazing. It pours black and oil like (but slightly less than other RIS's). Has an amazing dark tan head that is fluffy and dense and leaves pretty good webbing. The smell is very complex with caramel, coffee, chocolate, burnt woods, and many other dark scents. The taste is even better, same flavors as listed above but more concentrated. Its absolutely amazing ,and pretty much beyond words that I can express right now. Amazing, one of my favorites."
"This is a fine brew. The funny thing is, to me it is an Imperial Guinness on tap, but an Imperial Stout from the bottle -- definitely different based on how you have it. Great brew. The only caveat, as others have mentioned, is the alcohol that sometimes comes to the forefront of this fine brew. Still recommended if you have never tried it on tap."
"Drinkability- Wow what an awesome beer. A great beer to drink when winter has arrived."
"Comment: For years I equated stouts with the bottles of Guinness my Irish friend would try to foist on me. Granted my palate was immature, but I never developed a taste. This stout was better than those lost to my memory but I did not enjoy it enough to become a regular stout consumer."
"Peace."
"peace"
"D - It was one of the very best beers I've had thus far along my journey and I have to believe having it on draft was the perfect way to go..this was so good I will seek it out again and again"
"A really overrated stout."
"Tastes amazing -- huge roast malt characteristics (a strongly choco-mocha), intense hopping. Would be a five if not for the booziness. Bit o' licorice? Why not? Thick and chewy, sticky and sweet, somewhat dry and bitter finish. Part of me wants to give this beer all fives, but it's real strong. I know that's what makes it ""Imperial"" (what with the not freezing on the way to the czar), but maybe somehow it could be incorporated better into the flavors? I don't know -- sometimes I'm drinking this and wonder if someone dropped a shot of Everclear in it without telling me. Regardless, the biggest, baddest Imperial I've ever had (though I've yet to try the World-Wide monster... maybe for Chanukkah?"
"A rich malty flavor, but there was a noticeable alcohol kick. The roasted malts really come through. The carbonation seemed a little rough, but ok. As for the drinkability, I would find it hard to have more than one or two of these at a sitting."
"Overall, I think this beer is worth trying, I think North Coast produced a winner in this stout, but only buy it if you are into stouts, which if you are reading this, is probably true."
"This is one big ass mofo on an imperial stout, one of the very best, a marvelous representative of the style."
"D - This is a beer to slowly sip and savour as the dark flavors only truly show themselves when the beer begins to warm. It is immensely enjoyable, though I would not want more than one in a sitting. The most remarkable aspect is the long, complex finish; it is reminiscent of a good cigar more than any other beer I have experienced. I had the last of the glass with a few pieces of dark, bittersweet chocolate; it was a nice match and had the interesting effect of bringing the hop character of the beer to the front."
"Really tasty beer. I'd love to taste their oak-aged version. Great RIS."
"Mouthfeel was full and nice without carbonation."
"NFL kick off 2007, Go Steelers!!"
"Taste is full of nice coffee, more burned or roast in the taste than in the smell. A distinct maltbitterness, which is not sharp determines most of this beer's character. The hops are overshadowed by the malty roast, so bitterness and hoppy notes are not really detectable. Somewhere I heard that some typical US hops are in this beer, but I can't seem to taste any citric hops. Body is pretty full and drinkability is not great, but really suits the beer style. A great beer."
"D. It has a high abv but doesn't make it apparent until you have finished a couple. One of the better imperial stouts. Very little hop characteristics. Nice and dry and complex."
"Good beer from North Coast Brewing"
"had on nitro-tap, served in a pint glass. appearance is a pitch black with a big creamy tan head. smells very good good, lots of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, and a bit of alcohol. tastes is very good, chocolate, coffee, and some malty sweetness, the high alcohol is covered up very well. mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy smooth. this is an excellent stout, one of my favorites."
"For a rather large beer, this has a nice drinkability. I may not want 2 in a row, but I could easily drink 2 over the course of an evening and the subsequent evenings. Definitely one for RIS fans to try if they somehow are not already familiar."
"D: for an RIS at 9 percent, it's plenty drinkable."
"drinkability is decent. for a 9% APV, this brew is rather drinkable. smooth in character and bold on the palate aren't usually condusive to a drinkable brew, but this one pulls it off nicely. cheers!"
"For some reason, I was almost positive I'd reviewed this one before. Pours an opaque deepest brown to black color with a decent light brown head. Good lacing. Complex aromas of roasted barley, chocolate malts, left-coasted hops, blackberry, and some bakers' chocolate. Full-on roastiness with hints of salty soy sauce and espresso. Some sweetness creeps in as it warms. High alpha hops provide a dry and bitey finish. Alcohol is completely hidden. Carbonation is at a good level to cut the thickness. Overall, a very nice RIS with loads of character. Again, I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this one maybe because it has a lasting, familiar character that draws the drinker back to it."
"Overall I'm not a big fan of Rasputin. It seems to be especially harsh for it's alcohol content. I also find that after about 2/3 of the way through the beer I wish I was done. The flavor profile isn't complex enough to carry me through."
"Pours extremely dark brown if not black with a little ruby when held to a light. Gynormous chocolate milk head that goes nowhere for a very long time. Laces throughout. Smells of roasted nuts, ground coffee, cocoa and a hint of alcohol and smoke. Though all the smells present themselves in the taste, the smoke and alcohol stand out more than I would like. Dont get me wrong, this is tasty but the complexity is not as much as I would like. Full in the mouth with a smooth as silk finish. Great sipper with a meal. An outstanding impy stout to say the least."
" Every sip so smooth, it have to be good."
"I haven't tried many Imperial Stouts, but this is the best I've had so far. This beer is not overly roasty, yet it still retains all of the stout character. Almost like a cranked up version of a really good oatmeal stout, very smooth, very balanced. Excellent."
"Drinkability: Not a session beer, but it goes down with a smooth finish. Its hefty and substantial, but not epic."
"DA: At 9% this one drinks rather easy, and is made even easier with it's great balance."
"D - This is supremely delicious. An after-dinner / cordial for sure, not even close to sessionability. Probably comparable to the Sam Smith's Imp. Stout."
"Drinkability is restricted to 'good' or one might embarrass themself."
"Has a light/airy feel for the style,very creamy has a juicy booziness. A sipper that goes down with ease. Not a beer i would drink more than one or two of,but enjoyable none the less."
"Peace off!"
"Esters of alcohol are there, the finish is a little sharp with a contradictory sweetness lingering on the tongue. Carbonation is low, mouth feel is enhanced when on blend. This is my choice for a RIS however The Yeti is right behind."
"This one pours dark as night and leaves a nice creamy head. The smell is very intoxicating hints of fruit, chocolate, and coffee. The taste was smooth but stayed on the top of my mouth with a bit of bitterness. After a couple of more drinks this one got a little more tamer as far as bitterness is concerned. I would not recommend this if you do not like strong stout beers this one wont be for you."
"I just popped open a second bottle with a slice of chocolate mocha cake, and a dollop of birthday cake ice cream.... Yummmm. North Coast you RULE! Gotta go buy some more, because I just put down both of my bottles in one sitting."
"If most stouts are as good as this, then I am a convert. Its a shame I tried it on a July night, because I am suddenly yearning for winter. A fabulous thing..."
"Drinkability: Typical of the higher ABV of most RIS... proceed with caution, but you can have as many of these as your body will allow. I will look for this again."
"This is one of those beers I have had lots of times, but never bothered to review. It poured into a mini Old Rasputin pint glass a dark brown, with ruby hues toward the bottom of the glass. Aroma was filled with milk chocolate, sweet bread and powdered sugar. Taste starts off rather sweet, with more of the milk chocolate coming through. Towards the end it becomes a bit more roasty and bitter, leaving a burnt coffee flavor on the palate. I would say the body of this beer is medium for an Imperial Stout. Alcohol does not seem prominent at all. A four pack of this brew did well for me. This is a great brew that is always reliable. Cheers"
"D- While I really enjoy this, it's primarily on an intellectual level. Not an everyday beer. The dryness of this beer is perhaps a little overwhelming."
"Beer is black as night coming out of the bottle with a nice dark oatmeal head more of a head than i expected from this black beer. Has a nice roasted caramel bouquet. On the first sip its all coffee and unsweetened chocolate but this melds with the bitter albeit piny aftertaste. A truly remarkable beer."
"D: This roughly half-pint was plenty for me. It tastes great and is a beer I would get again, but any more than a pint would take work, especially with a meal."
"D: Fairly heavy stout for me but very flavorfull and drinkability is good. A very good sipping beer."
"D- Quite good, especially for the 9%. I wouldn't drink it all the time, but if it was readily available... sigh. I'd be a happy man."
"Drinkability: Not necessarily sessionable, but as close as I've found in an imperial stout. Despite the high ABV, this is incredibly smooth and drinkable."
"Pours pitch black with some dark crimson to brown flecks. Very large, bubbly, light-brown head with a good amount of cream and lots of arced lacing. Aroma is warm and woozy: prunes, spruce resin, milk chocolate, cream, vanilla, some red wine, and lots of alcohol. Mouthfeel is juicy and creamy. Flavor is mildly sweet with chocolate and molasses backed by a somewhat milder acidic coffee / grass and a deep, rich hop spice. Notes of custard and dark fruit throughout. Deep roast with charcoal in the finish; burnt meaty aftertaste."
"Served in a Westy chalice and it looks beautiful. Smells and drinks with a mellow chocolate and roasted malt backbone. It's a nice flavor, but I can't pull a lot of depth from it. Still, it has a wonderful chocolate taste and makes for a great dessert beer and for a RIS it's relatively affordable."
"so 982 reviewers as of this writing. This is one rather nice imp stout. I picked up a couple of these on a beer run last weekend. I will not expand upon the many other review other than to say, hops were a bit sharper than expected and the abv was so smooth and hidden as to be a surprise. Wonderful beer! Highly recommended."
"Something good to drink on a chilly night. I like it, but I've had better RIS. Worth a try."
"First stout reviewed, not typically a fan but this was a treat. Received as a gift from an employee and was hesitant to drink due to it not normally being my style and the high alcohol content. Pours dark, virtually black, with nice thick, tan head. Head stays around and leaves great lace. Smell is of coffee mainly but some chocolate as well and a little bit of alochol (only a little). Looks good...smells good...taste...its good too. Very thick and creamy, low carbonation and strong coffee (cant pinpoint what kind as I'm not a coffee drinker) and nice taste of chocolate at the end, little bit of alcohol taste but its hidden beneath everything else. The most complex tasting beer I have ever reviewed. For being so strong and thick you hardly notice, great mouthfeel, great beer. Curious to try other examples of this style but I think I'll only be disappointed."
""
"D: A delicious tasty brew, worth its accolades. Not that expensive in this neck of the woods, and its even available at my local Vons. A classic brew, that is a good choice for RIS fans low on cash and looking for a thick warming dessert-type beer. Would think this would be the perfect complement to rich chocolate cake."
"Drinkability - A nice sipping beer to end the day. I really enjoyed this one. One of my top Russian Imperial Stouts."
"I enjoy this stout and for 2.50 its a steal!"
"The only real flaw here is that I just finished the 4-pack. Damn North Coast for not making it a 6-pack!"
"D- Can only handle one, being very thick, stout, filling. You want to drink it slow and savor it (I dare anyone to drink it fast,) which helps that the taste and aroma changes as the temperature changes. Unfortunately it gets TOO bitter toward room temperature."
"Wow, this is an excellent stout. It's powerful, a meal to itself, but doesn't punish. Extremely well balanced. I'll be coming back to this one."
"Thick and moderately heavy mouthfeel. Nice and smooth. Some natural carbonation and, again, a nice warmth."
"If the Russian Czars were around today, this might be the stout they would import. A beautifully crafted, delicious beer. Highly recommended."
"Notes: My fellow Beer Advocates this Russian Imperial stout is the Czar of Russian Imperial stouts. Tasting this masterpeice was like an adreniline rush. Na zdorovje"
"Quite drinkable. The 9% ABV is a real secret."
"Still I would recommend this beer to everyone, it puts all the other stouts I've tried to shame and has rekindled my intrest in this style"
"Outstanding Russian Imperial."
"Bottle, courtesy of gunnfryd, who supplied it to our tasting. The ABV was 9.0%. Served at room temperature - I would prefer it just a little cooler, but not cold. Pitch black colour, moderate head. Heavily roasty aroma and flavour, with notes of liquorice and coffee. A very robust and tasty imperial stout, but not too extreme."
"Given the choice, I'd prefer Victory Storm King, my favorite impy stout. But if Storm King is unavailable, this is a good second choice."
"Pours black with a big persistant tan head, nice lacing down the glass. Aroma is dark chocolate, coffee, some spicy hop freshness and a hint of alcohol. Starts with a touch of burnt malt, some nice underlying sweetness throughout. Hops make their presence felt in the finish. It just feels like everything is big and balanced in this beer- everything in perfect proportion. It manages to be huge, delicous, and nuanced without being totally overpowering. Nice full mouthfeel. I think this is exceptionally drinkable for the style. Perhaps my favorite imperial stout."
"Starts big, and finishes big, but is a very mellow character. True to its nature, dark and heady with lots of roasted malt to the nose and tongue. Alcohol is masked nicely, but one to be aware of because these will fool you into a hallucination or two if you aren't careful. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a Stone Russian IMP glass, black of course, brownish head, good retention. Smells wonderful, roasty malts, chocolate and hints of coffee. Tastes rich with a smooth fill, alcohol is not overly apparent. Lots going on here more for my novice palate. Good beer."
"This was one of the first Russian Imperial Stout, I had tried. I judge other RIS to this one. I was so shock and suprised by the flavor one the first sip."
"d- great example of what makes a RIS so tasty"
"Definitely Recommend"
"Short stubby brown 12oz bottle with Rasputin in grainy black and white waving a protection spell at the drinker. Let us hope it's not a hex spell. The first time I grabbed this was 1992 when I was in my ""I'll buy that because it's something I've never tried"" phase. I'm still in that phase it seems. Appearance is a perfect black brew with a little bit of light sneaking in at the edges and a beautiful tan head with lots of sticky retention. This is probably my favorite smelling imperial stout; mocha, malted milk and dark chocolate aromas dominate. Tastes are these same flavors but with an alcohol warmth and a hoppy balance. Old rasputin is creamier than most imperial stouts and has a thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is high for the style but this is still a sipping beer. One of my favorite west coast breweries, North Coast set the standard on imperial stouts with this now classic brew. I've never gotten a bad or skunked bottle in 15 years so if you see it here on the east coast it is a must try."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a thick deep brown with a good-sized tan head that slowly diminished. Leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and just a bit of alcohol. Taste is a mixture of coffee, chocolate, some vanilla, and a bit of earthy roasted malts. A bit of hops gives it a nice quick bitter finish. Lingering tastes of coffee and chocolate. Full bodied. Maybe a little bit too much carbonation for my tastes. Overall, this is a very well done beer. Maybe not the best of the imperial stouts, but definately worthy of a try."
"Overall: This is a highly rated imperial stout but obviously I was not as impressed as most people have been. Its a great looking stout to be sure, but its seriously aligned toward the bitter end of the spectrum, which to me overwhelms the underlying flavor complexity. Definitely allow this one to warm up for maximum viscosity and mellowness. Certainly worth a try; Im just not certain that it lives up to its reputation. Maybe Ill try another batch next year."
"This is a good imperial stout available year around, but I either prefer something with stronger flavor (Stone) or complexity (Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout)."
"Bought a four pack of these this winter and just finished my last one. Yummy. I always look forward to this beer. Poured it into a pint glass, absolutely black and abysmal, just perfect for the style. Smelled of burnt coffee and bbq'd meat (maybe that's casue I'm hungry). Tastes of chocolate and coffee, with a nice little bit of heat at the end, warms the belly nicely. Overall, a very nice beer. I've heard about the 10th anniversary release of some oak-aged rasputin, but alas, it has never showed in Eugene."
"Bought a 12 oz bottle to consume by myself. No bottling or best-by date on it. Poured into a brandy snifter - I don't know if this is the proper glassware, but I love how it opens up the flavors and warms it. Nice, oily black color, completely opaque, with a thin, tan head. Very good retention - left rings around the glass. Smells and tastes of all sorts of dark wonderfulness: cherries, dark roast coffee, some dark chocolate, raisins, red grapes. At times the aromas reminded me of a great red wine - a tad woody, smoky, and spicy. Lots of complexity all around, and the flavors and aromas changed as it warmed up in my hand. Thick, heavy mouthfeel - not too creamy - it fits the character well. Overall, a very drinkable beer - highly recommended. A wonderful, complex drink."
" Yes, I know that I'm not the most experienced when I come to this style, but I'd have to wholeheartedly say that this is worth the hype and a great introduction to this style for novices like me. The mouthfeel is enjoyable and solid, and there's not bitterness to be felt here. Just richly deep layers of flavor, and plenty to ponder between sips. No wonder this comes in 4-packs - I'm not quite sure that I could handle six of these!"
"drinkability is good. balanced and very enjoyable. glad i finally got to try this one. thanks again mark!"
"Pours opaque dark brown with not much of a lasting head, but good lace. The smell of this beer is astounding--I get a really clear licorice smell from it, which is great. The flavor is solid as well, sweet, smooth, creamy, almost reminds me of an Oreo cookie somehow. Really drinkable for this style--bitterness is in check, alcohol isn't even detectable!"
"I had this while at the Newport Beach Brewing Company. It was poured by from a bottle by my server (table side). The head disappeared almost immediately. The nose was roasted, slightly smokey, a little burnt. The mouthfeel wasnt as creamy as some stouts--but not thin or watery at all. This stout was not dry, rather a bit sticky and syrupy. The moderately strong alcohol (8.9%) was not noticeable at all. The taste was very nice. Many porters are too burnt for my taste, this one had a definitely detectable burnt flavor in the finish, but it only enhanced the total flavor of the beer for me. I really liked this one."
"I purchased this beer at store based on the glowing reviews that I have seen here. This is a mean beer and will leave you feeling loopy. Looks good and dark with a solid head. smell is strong as it should be. Tastes POW. Like coffee in a beer. Hops, lots of thngs going on here. At first I don't like it but it gets better and better. In fact its really good don't drink too many though or you will forget how to type."
"Really nice, leaves a whole bitterness in your mouth after each drink that gives the impression of a bittersweet chocolate coating rather than gripping hop lupulin. Easy to see why so many people use the word ""complex"" when describing this one."
"12 oz bottle that I've been sitting on for about six months. The color was dark black with a decent tan head. Smell was a little roasty. The taste was good with some roastiness also. The mouth-feel was not great as the beer seemed a little thin. I was planning on aging some of this but I am not sure it is worth it. Good RIS but not my favorite."
"Scores edited after going home and trying this beer with a little more energy."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a snifter. The beer pours an opaque black, forming a 1/4 inch mocha head, leaving medium rings of lace. The aroma is heavily consisted of roasted malts and coffee. The taste is just amazing!! Strong roasted malt bitterness, coffee, and good amount of chocolate sweetness. Alcohol is not detectible, suprisingly being 9%. Mouthfeel is thick and extremely smooth. No harsh finish associated with other RIS. Drinkability is high, except for the abv. I think drinking a few of these would do it for one night. This is thee best Russian Imperial Stout that I have had the pleasure of drinking. A bit expensive, but well worth the price."
"A very good beer especially given the style. This one is a good one to show new BAs. So much going on."
"Cocoa upfront on the taste... smooth sweetness in the middle and a bitter bite on the swallow... flavor meanders between the sweet and bitternes with a cutting alcohol burn. I dig it."
"poured very dark from the bottle with a tan head, good lacing. bouqet was impressive with the expected chocolate, espresso, toffee, and dark dried fruit notes. west coast hops also were present but subtle against these dominant aromas. a little sweet upfront but not for long as the astringent roasty flavors and subtle bittering of the hops rush in to make this beer a bit drier than i expected. alcohol warming somewhat noticeable at the end. full-bodied, naturally. i like my dark, heavy beers to present with a little more residual sweetness than this, however. still a very nice beer. not very sessionable due to the body/abv but quite tasty."
"Overall a very good beer. I was impressed. And not a bad RIS to start with if you have never experienced the style. Try pairing it with some dark chocolate after a hearty meal - it makes an excellent dessert."
"the dead of winter, but since it's spring, a good candidate for aging."
"D: The drinkability is decent, but the high ABV does limit it."
"Haven't had much of this style, but I was pleasantly surprised by it's drinkability. Very smooth, yet complex. The roasted, and slightly charred malts hit the nose, and the bite of hops and grain come through quickly in a syrupy mix. The first few sips were almost too much for me to handle, but as it warmed and as I got used to it, I was really enjoying it. To me, this seems to be a classic representative of its kind, and one that I would highly recommend."
"D- I always forget how good this is. I really don't give this enough credit. A must try for any Imperial Stout fan."
"Cheers"
"Heavy, full-bodied with a slight dryness at the end. Pretty minimal amount of carbonation, not even noticeable. The alcohol can be a little much at times, making its drinkability fall. I wouldn't suggest this to casual beer drinkers, but I would recommend it to anyone that has a taste for stouts or appreciates the style. Personally, I would drink this again, but I might choose another RIS over this."
"Poured out a near black opaque color with a creamy cappucino head. The nose offered some serious malts, chocolate, coffee, but also hops a plenty, grapefruit and piney. The taste is charcoal, mollasses, bbq, smoke, coffee, chocolate, and even a little sour cherry. lots of fun things going on here. Almost has too thin of a mouthfeel for a stout, more porter like with good tight carbonation. Very drinkable for a big, heavy, complicated beer like this."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable for a rather heavy stout, the 9% abv is masked mostly by delicious chewy hops, this brew could be a great post-dinner drink but the strong sweet malts makes it tough to drink several in one setting"
"The drinkability is vrey good, what a great brew. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"D: This was my first RIS and I loved it. This is a very drinkable beer and the 9% is hidden extremely well. It is smooth and well balanced. I can't wait to try some more (picking up some Stone RIS this weekend!)."
"12ozer that poured solid midnight black with a maroon tinge and a gigantic head that just wouldnt budge. The rosy aroma is of dark cherries and chocolate. The bitter chocolate manages to predominate the first swallow, but looming in the background is a tangle of alcohol, espresso and even some dry hop grassiness. This is a complex and interesting stout, worthy of its high ratings. (#2764, 3/31/2007)"
"This is not to drinkable right now. Take your time and sip one, and you'll have had enough. I imagine they don't go down much faster with age, but are more enjoyable. Time will tell...or hopefully, a beer fest has a vintage barrel so I won't have to wait so long, and will still have this somewhat fresh in my mind!"
"D: Good deal of alcohol warmth makes this a perfect winter sipping brew. I'd like to taste this beer side by side with Brooklyn and Storm King. In my opinion this beer deserves a place alongside those two in my fridge. Highly recommended."
"This is ofcourse a very good brew, but for some reasons my expactations were so high it might have hurt the tasting. Expected deeper taste."
"Overall, a solid brew. One that benefits from a warmer temp - the alcoholic punch interrupted the symphony, yet highlighted other moments. A good sipper and contemplator. One per night please."
"Overall a kickass beer. A classic from a great brewery. I love Russian Imperial Stouts but this is probably my favorite."
"Rasputin must have sent this one back from hell- this brew can kick some serious ass. Poured pitch black, thick and syrupy. Aromas dominated by roasted malts, alcoholic, medicinal coffee. Taste is overpowering at first- huge alcohols up front, then graduating to dark bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee and bitter cherry syrup. Finishes extremely dry, leaving an aftertaste of strong whisky and woody, earthy flavors. Haven't had anything like this before- certainly a sipping brew if there ever was one. I would have suspected the abv to be much higher, but i give the Rasputin higher marks for creating intense flavors and a fire-breathing quality without jacking up the alcohol content."
"(Addenda: at a much later date this beer continues to satisfy; but I did not note that the lacing is apparently painted on the glass, as it seems to remain forever.)"
"poured into a glass it has a large brown/almond colored head that slowly goes down. the beer itself is extremely dark, even when held up to light. There is a roasted coffee aroma, that for me is faint, but might be stronger than i can tell. The taste follows the aroma. There is a coffee taste, with a slight bitterness. The stout has a nice medium body that is nice on the finish. This stout is very smooth and easy to enjoy."
"This is my go to stout. Easy to find and the price for such a tasty Imp. Stout is unbeatable. A classic and for good reason."
"Drinkability is about what you'd expect for an imp, no surprises here."
"The Russian Imperial Stout pours a midnight black, nice dark khaki head. Decent lacing. Smell is strong roasted malts and coffee. Alcohol and hops in there as well. Some sweet chocolate. Taste is the roasted malts and chocolate. Some alcohol here as well. Good balance between the sweet and bitter.Mouthfeel starts full and finishes fairly dry. Very enjoyable. An extremely drinkable stout."
"Drinkability - I could never see myself having more than one unless I was horribly snowed in with nothing better to do with my time. That said its always a great one and done."
"This is a great beer and a very drinkable RIS. It's an American classic and the beer that brought this style back from the brink of extinction. Cheers to Rasputin for not dying easily! In fact, he's still very well alive an kicking..."
"D - This is a one and done brew. Very good, but high ABV makes it an occasional item."
"It pours pitch black in a glass. One smell from the beer brings lots of flaovrs to the nose. Fruity, piney, chocolate, raw cane sugar, and alcohol flavors run around freely. This stuff is extremely complex, but I assume thats the nature of RIS's. A light roasted bitterness sits on the tongue after every sip, reminding me it's still a stout, but a very beefed-up one. At less than $2 for the bottle, it didn't drain my wallet, and I got something new and exciting."
"Great beer, especially if you like RIS's. Give it a try!"
"Overall, this is an interesting brew that I wouldn't mind having again. The high alcohol level would rule it out as a session beer, but good for sipping."
"Taste is quite chocolatey and has a nice roasted maltiness to it. Feels smooth, yet full-bodied with a nice bitter coffee bite saved for the back of the tongue and throat. I'll be having this one again for sure, good taste & complexity. Drinks exceptionally well for a 9% RIS."
"I found this on sale for $1.79 at the Franklin Market of Choice in Eugene, OR. It pours out a dark, dark black color with very little shades of red-brown. It pours with a thick, tan bubbly/creamy head and lots and lots of lacing. The smell is very subtle but complex - chocolate and roasted malts dominate. I has a bubbly mouthfeel and starts out with a taste of chocolate and then finishes with a great chocolate and coffee blended taste that just keeps going. The complexity of the taste takes a few seconds to hit you after swallowing. An excellent RI stout - almost no taste of alcohol at all."
"This is just a really tasty imperial stout all around. Can't find fault with it. I think I'll have to make it a go-to."
"D - Pretty impressive stout, I couldn't drink more than two of these at a time, but I would get it again"
"Mouthfeel was zesty with mouthfilling carbonation."
"Dark chocolate in color with a light tan creamy head. Smell of roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate with a strong roasted malt flavor with a good carbonation leaving a hefty bitter aftertaste. It's a thick, creamy stout, a good one to have on hand if your feeling bold."
"This beer is black and has a nice tan/cream colored head  lacing is pretty in this beer. The aroma is sweet of malt and there is some spice that Im having trouble identifying. The taste is bold and bitter. There is plenty of malt and a slight sweetness. Coffee flavors and a hint of spice are present. This beer starts off quite intimidating, but mellows slightly as it warms and my palate adjusts. The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected  but is still on the full side. As for drinkability, this beer is a bit much for me to kick a few back in one sitting  but it is very good!"
"Poured very dark, as expected, with about a finger of light tan head. The effervescence was short-lived. Residual sweetness was minimal. The nose was much more smoky than I had expected. I had hoped for more roasted malt, coffee, and/or chocolate malt than realized. Overall this was an average beer - Rogue RIS was a far better representative - afaic..."
"I bought a four-pack of this in a big wine mega-store in Maryland. I've had this beer before on the west coast, but it has been a while. The beer poured coffee black, with a light brown head about one-half inch thick. It smelled of coffee and chocolate. It tasted great, but had a little alcohol burn in the aftertaste. It was a little fizzy, but that was a minor problem. I would like to drink this more often."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date - like it needs one. Pours a super duper dark brown, almost black with a 1 finger head decent longevity and very good lace. Smells of highly roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and some dried fruit. How do you describe the taste of this stuff. Heavy roasted malts with espresso like flavors, chocolate, dried fruits and alcohol in the finish. Almost like a dubble or triple but made with roasted malts. Smooth and creamy. Highly complex. Good stuff!!"
"Ive had the CZAR and now its time for RASPUTIN! Lets see who wins! Very black body with a small thin tan head that fells fast.Chocolate is the main smell I get out of it.There is some fruit smells under the chocolate.The taste is dynamite! The taste is fruit and expresso and damn good.I taste some bitter chocolate in the aftertaste.The mouthful is slick and thick and tasty,did I mention that already? I dont know if I could drink multiple of these cause of the abv content but it is pretty well hidden,let see when it warms.I think OLD RASPY won this war.I would say to the people who want to know what is compares between,its more bolder then Stormking but not as Czar.Very good indeed."
"I also have to rate the drinkability quite highly for a stout, though it is certainly best sipped rather than gulped. I would not have known it was 9% alcohol if I hadn't read it on this page."
"D: Not bad... Not bad at all. A very good tasting stout that I once thought to be over rated. Alcohol booziness gets there a tad bit in the end, which no doubt they intended it that way, but lowers my drinkability rating a .5."
"Drinkability: This is a wonderful stout. It's not something that I would introduce someone to the genre with, but it's something that people who enjoy stouts or porters will definitely enjoy."
"I simply cannot sip this beer - it screams a ""5" on drinkability, but if I drank as many now as I'd like, I'd be under the table talking to my shoe. Gotta knock this one a touch. I wouldn't mind if this beer was 6 or 7% - then I could drink a few of this deliciousness."
"Fantastic, fantastic beer. I wish all Russian Imperial Stouts could possess this smoothness and construction."
"Drinkability: One or two of these max in one sitting. I loved it but its very powerful in all aspects so I probably would max out at 2 in a session. Fantastic seasonal, perfect for a cold new england winter."
"Medium viscous body with a pleasantly coating wake that begs another dive into the huge flavors. Alcohol produces warmth and only a slight phenolic presence. Who's your daddy? Old Rasputin is, in case you've forgotten."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours very dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. The head doesn't stick around for too long, but the lacing is OK. The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. It tastes like coffee, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. The beer also has a good lingering bitter hoppy finish, with nice balance. Mouthfeel is medium/full, and it's creamy and has just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's nice and smooth. Alcohol is noticeable, but not bad. IMO, it's a good RIS, I'd recommend it to others to try."
"D: Dangerously drinkable for the high alcohol content. A very nice crisp and clean Imperial Stout. Recommended."
"D - I wouldn't want one every day, or even once a month. Once a year, for sure."
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. The head spilled all over the sides, oops. The head slowly settles into a sticky, heavily lacing, belgian dubbel-like cap. The beer is nearly black. I can tell from the foam on my hand that it is a very sticky brew. The smell is really fresh. I don't know how else to explain it. Green, not as in 'green beer', but floral with chlorophyll aromas. Well roasted malts with a touch of piny hops. The flavor is great. Bold, rich, smooth, and burnt. It tastes similar to storm king stout, but it has a much more creamy and smooth body. Very well balanced overall. I like the little bite at the end that comes out at the same time as the hops. It's hard to make a RIS that isn't rough around the edges, but they did it here."
"Overall: If you like stouts, you'll love this offering from North Coast."
"Notes - For about 2$ a 12oz bottle this is a good value as well."
"Drinkability: One of the most drinkable Russian Imperials, delicious and sweet, but not sticky or heavy. If anything, not as complex as some, but definitely more approachable."
"Very dark brown/black color - cannot see light through it. Head is less than an inch and doesn't last long. The taste is bitter as expected and the first couple of sips have a noticeable alcohol flavor. Very good beer with dark chocolate. If rating of 9% ABV is accurate then why do I fee so buzzed after sipping just one?! Two would put me over the top. This is a good beer if you love dark bitters (which I do)."
"Btw the russian text on the bottle means ""Good friends doesn't come easily (fast)""."
"Works together almost perfectly. Truly one of the great stouts, great American brews, great beers - and consistent over the years."
"I've read about much about this one, my favorite Beer pourveyor ($8) had a four pack and I picked it right up. This one jumps out right at you. The smells of coffee and chocolate hits you right away. The taste is a lively, for sure. Though the taste of alcohol is noticeable, but not detremental. Taste of rich malts that have a heavy accent of chocolate and oats. Mouthfeel is very pleasent for 9% ABV. Appearance is very dark, but with some very deep amber. This is a sipping beer, not for dinner and one to savor (it lingers in very good way). Something to relax with on cold winter nights. This reminds me of one other beer (and one of my all time favorites) Geary's Hampshire Ale. Great overall. Worth every penny."
"An amazingly glorious RIS in every sense of the style. Now I see how right my initial impressions were when I first tried this beer. Probably at the top of my list in this style to date. Fantastic!"
"This is probably one of the more heralded stouts brewed in the US, and I think with good reason. What makes it more unusual is that it's an imperial stout, which isn't that common. Very malty, giving it a powerful sweetness, and it has a deep roasted coffee flavor. It's got 8.9% ABV, but don't worry, you'll sober up when you see the picture of Rasputin on the label. Man, he is one creepy bastard. Look at Rasputin, and then turn the bottle one way or the other, and I swear, the eyes follow you...Not even John Ashcroft gives me the paranoid willies like this label (begin Tommy Chong-like rant against the government in 3, 2, 1...)."
"Poors Black with a thin tan head. You know you have a good stout when you cant see light through it when held up to a lamp. Anyway tastes a little sweet, chocolatey, some hints of coffee. Some alcohol sneeks through, but it really adds to the over all flavor, and is in no way overpowering. A grate body, and excelent drinkability."
"black liquid with creamy tan head. rich aroma character (cofee/malt). a bit of a ting on the palate but tasty... rich finish. this beer opened my palate to stouts beyond the sam adams/guiness portion of the varitey. there is so much more to stout! a must try."
"I was taking inventory of my cellar and came across 2 bottles of these. They have to be over a year old and I was suprised I've not reviewed it yet. This should be a staple for you to sip on cold evenings."
"This is a wonderful impy stout. It would have been nice to have this on a cold day, as I have before, but I was a little excited about the 65 degree weather here in NC today. Been a little cool lately. Definitely go out and get some of this."
"Unbelievable. Pours out black. Not brown, not deep amber, but black. Very thick foam head with staying power. Aroma is one of freshly baked dark bread. The outstanding quality of this ale is in its taste. The best comparison I can make is that it is like drinking a loaf of fresh rye bread. The rye really comes through, but with a smooth velvety texture. Any harsh bitterness of rye hops has been balanced away. You really need to sit and enjoy this one slowly. Its smoothness and balance provide a great mouthfeel. I selected a slightly lower grade for drinkability, because it is a heavy ale. Great wintertime drink."
"Dora thhe Explorer could not make a better find."
"Was going to give it a four, but i drank this one so quickly and effortlessly i had to bump it up another notch. Definitely sessionable, would love to sip on this all night long. The 9% alcohol is very well hid. Probably wouldnt use this to introduce someone to stouts, but would definitely recommend it to someone who appreciates stouts and porters and is looking for more. Ill definitely be grabbing this again, and the price was pretty reasonable too!"
"One is great, two and the world is happy, three...that's what my friend calls ""a fist in the eye"". Full flavored, dark and pure. Tasty alone or with a meal. Hamburgers are especially good with this beer. Truly a great beer, even if you only want one."
"Quite simply a fantastic beer. Looked great; black with a nice creamy head, just like a stout should. Smelled of strong hops with a background of roasty maltyness. The taste kicks you right in the mouth; tons of flavor in all departments. Hoppy, roasty, with some chocolate malt sweetness. It's very filling and would be hard to drink more then one, but the 9% abv is covered up very well. Probably the best stout i've ever had."
"Drinkability- Overall, I think the beer was pretty good. A couple drinks into this I was really enjoying it. Other than it being a hair overcarbonated for me, it's a solid Imperial Stout."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, rich, fulfilling with just the right amount of sweetness, roastiness, and bitters all working together to a finish that is chewy and delightful."
"After reading the low scoring reviews, I can understand why someone would hate Old Rasputin. But not a single ""hardcore"" Imperial Stout drinker will say that this is not a fantastic beer. Very full bodied, heavy, and complex. Burnt malt, coffee, and chocolate dominate the palate. Old Rasputin is, at least in the Chicago area, available at most liquor stores and Trader Joe's and is very reasonably priced ($6.99/4-pack). I always keep it stocked on my ""stout shelf"" (along with Victory Storm King)."
"D - So drinkable, especially for a beer this thick. Could even be a daily drinker."
"D - One of the most original tasting stouts out there. Price is also very reasonable at around 7.99 for a four pack."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable for an RIS, while still maintaining an RIS kick and complexity. I downed a 12 oz of this in under a half hour, which, for me, is hard to do with an RIS. Anyway, a fantastic RIS for those wanting to step up from ""lesser"" stouts, or for those wanting to maintain the RIS punch while not going for something as big as a Stone RIS, etc. - in other words, this is about as close as an RIS gets to being sessionable. Especially sessionable with an extra sharp, aged cheddar. Mm."
"As for the taste, hmmm.Big Flavors right off the bat. Roasted, caramel sweetness, The alcohol can definatly be tasted and this is warm going down, yummy. Coffee undertones as well as the tiniest hint of chocolate, I mean tiny but it is there. Very nicely carbonated, and thick. This is a definate sipper. The abv custs down on what you may be able to drink but not what you think you can! I could really drink this on every cold night. Big beer here folks, very nicely done!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass after allowing beer to rise to a temperature of about 50 degrees. Head was three fingers thick, faded after a couple of minutes. Very full flavor, I was impressed with how it had sweetness coming through in the midst of the coffee overtones. Speaking of, that's what this reminded me of: a well-made cup of black coffee, but with more going on, and no need for milk or sugar. I also mark this as part of my evolution as a beer drinker, because a few years ago I would not have been able to appreciate a stout of this caliber."
"Poured a dark black with slight ruby color when back lit. Nice creamy tanish off-white head. Massive lacing down the whole pint glass. Smells of alcohol esters mixed with a strong tone of roasted and chocolate malts. Slight hints of caramel and coffee flavors in the nose as well. Smooth rolling chocolate and roasted malt flavor. The alcohol taste is quite strong in the finish. Has a rather dry finish with a definite alcohol tone. Quite roasty and lots of bold malts in the mix. Nice full body and very drinkable. This one certainly has the making of a true imperial stout. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"This 9 percent stout poured into my snifter with a vengeance....dark molasses color, with a substantial, lingering cola colored head. This beer had a nose of dark chocolate, toffee, and traces of low alcohol tones. The heavy, complex taste of chocolaty roasted malts, warming alcohol, and meandering hints of dark ripened fruit, finished wonderfully with a subtle black coffee trail. The mouth feel was very substantial....probably the reason this beer comes in a four pack instead of a sixer...a heavy, heavy, brew. This beer paired very well with pieces of dark chocolate...Enjoy"
"D: Great, but strong. Good beer for occasions, but if I were to be drinking more than 2, Id have drink Red Seal"
"For the price and availability this is a great stout."
" Wavz"
"Extra full, lucious body, smooth as silk. Big ass drinkable beer. So clean."
"Color is an opaque black, through which no light passes. Head is tan, abundant, and perpetual. Aroma is malty and bourbon-y. Taste is of burned pizza crust and chocolate malt (and deliciousness!). Mouthfeel is full, and this beer definitely lingers in the mouth. Excellent all the way around."
"This is a fantastic RIS and a must try beer. No wonder so many BAs before me have found a way to get their hands on this brew."
"Drink-Ability: I had this one at the Flying Saucer in Charlotte NC and I highly recommend this great IRS"
"I didn't finish my 12 oz bottle. My mouth reviled at the taste and I had a hangover before I consumed 8 oz."
"Personally I think this is one of the premier stouts brewed in America. Use it to scare off your Bud Light swilling friends and then sit back and enjoy."
"A nice dark stout with a rich color and very pleasant, stouty smell. The taste is complex, but not heavy and without any bitterness. It sits nicely in the mouth and goes down smooth as velvet and strong as a truck. I highly recommend it to anybody who loves porters and stouts."
"I poured it in a brandy snifter. Gorgeous deep opaque robe. Tan head that took its little time to disappear. Nose was full of roasted malts and dark chocolate. Very rich on the palate with notes of chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Nice finish. Outstanding!!"
"pours out an opaque dark brown colour...beautiful. ruby tinted tan head appears and sticks frothfully. lots of lace. aroma of fuitcake and cherries...monster cookies, rum, port wine, etc. taste is oh so tasty and amazing with its layered toffee and caramel goodness and with its fig flavoured rum soaked fruit cake nuances. enough dark roasted features to satisfy. then comes the amazingly well balanced hoppiness...seems so integrated but defined. this has a lot of norhtwest hop character...but so definitely more baltic porter than imperial stout. this ranks right up there with the all time faves of style and celebrity. i can see why i was blown away when first reviewing this beer years ago...it still boggles the mind. full bodied, silky mouthfeel, and an alcohol warmth in the finish. damn tasty. drinkability rocks. i love it."
"Pitch black, with a gigantic brown head thats with you till the end. Smells of roasted oats and barley, with a sour component. Tastes of chocolate and espresso, initially very dry, but finishes sweet. If you appreciate a good stout, you should give this a try."
"D- you can taste the 9%, but didnt really feel. dangerously easy drinking here. yummy brew, i'd recommend to stout lovers"
"Dark, blinding black; lumpy tan head; massive, streaky tan lacing throughout. Cocoa, dark burnt malts and smokey almonds graze the nose. The initial sips are sweet chocolate, yeasty malts and light roast coffee beans. The body quickly turns creamy and slick. Caramel, brown sugar and dark roasted malts combine for a massively flavored full bodied beer! Velvet-like smoothness; oh so tender hints of left coast perfumy hops with a large smokey malt backbone and finish. Mild, warming notes of alcohol. A roof-raising, sessionable, well marketed RIS--do you need more?"
"Served slightly below room temperature in a pint glass. Poured a shiny, used motor oil like jet black. Left a frothy coffee brown colored head about three quarters of an inch high. Head slowly dissapeared into a brown gob in the center of the glass. Sweet aromas of chocolates, roasted coffee beans, and a touch of freshly baked cookies. Had a wonderful taste as well. Flavors of roasted chocolate malt, bitter roasted coffee beans, some dark chocolates, and vanilla extract. A small hint of well hidden alcohol and a little bit of carbonation. Mouthfeel was thick and full with an explosion of flavor. Also a pretty drinkable russian imperial stout."
"I had this beer after drinking a Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, and I think this one suffers a little in comparison. A black color with a fairly small head. Coffee, sweet chocolate aroma. An espresso taste, some chocolate. I thought it was a little on the sharp side. Still, a pretty enjoyable stout."
"This excellent stout pours a thick creamy black with light carbonation and a rich tan head that laces nicely. It has a hearty smell of roasted malt and toffee notes. No missing the alcohol. The taste is fantastic -- creamy and sweet with a nice alcohol punch. The aftertaste is pleasant. Very nice mouthfeel and very thick. Even at the high ABV it drinks well and it's easy to have a few before consciousness is sacrificed."
"Sláinte"
"Overall this is a really exciting and interesting imperial stout, and a great starting point with this style. Some may find it a bit too strong, either taste-wise or alcohol-wise, but if that doesn't scare you go ahead and try it!"
"Pours deep brown with coffee and plums in the nose. Slick mouthfeel with good carbonation. Minimal lacing on glass. Burnt roasted malts followed by dark chocolate and coffee with a pleasant bitter aftertaste. Exceptional. This is one of my 'go to' beers for the RIP style.."
"Drinkability: It's a high alcohol RIS, but I definitely wanted more when I finished the bottle."
"Entry is creamy and possesses a dry, chalky mouthfeel. Midtaste leads with hot unhidden alcohol before it settles in with a blanket of chocolate. The finish sports a fleeting hoppy note, more chocolate, and a warming glow."
"12 oz. bottle- color of India ink , small coffee color head - nose of chocolate (sweet and baking ), iodine , coffee , anis , dark fruit , mocha , and malts  taste of milk chocolate , vanilla , prunes, figs and coco  sweet chewy body- aftertaste anis, coffee, coco"
"Overall a great beer. I'd definitely buy it again. A great nightcap or first beer of the night."
""
"D - Despite the alcohol content and strong roasty burnt flavors, I believe that this is about the most drinkable stout ever. Give me more!"
"Body is medium full/full and is very drinkable to someone like myself. Would be a sharing beer for some due to the richness. Overall a great (easy drinking without sacrificing flavor) Russian Imperial Stout."
"Great appearance, good smelling, excellent taste and mouthfeel lead up to an imperial stout that is all too drinkable...especially when on tap and charged with nitrogen...love this stuff!"
"Drinkability - this is an excellent ale, with well hidden abv. Very hearty, and delicious. It's that abv that holds down sessionability, so it's a sipper to be enjoyed slowly with only a couple of servings at a given session - but do so often, I will."
"Poured into a tumbler at 5o degrees. Beer was black as night. Smell was dark roasted malty nutty smoke laced like wood fire smell. Head went away rather quick. I though this was a right strong stout a little bitter for my taste, but stout folks I think will like and shuld try it. I most likely will not purchase again though."
"The brew gets a little flat for carbonation quicklly which is to be expected but not a big change from beginning. As the beer warms I notice increase of chocolate and some hoppiness. This is an excellent Imperial. 2 or 3 of these would make for an interesting evening with good friends."
"Drinkability: An excellent Imperial Stout, but a little high in ABV to drink too many. But it is very drinkable because it is so tasty!"
" A very enjoyable stout. Getting down into the beer allows the nose to be engulfed in the delectable aromas wafting up from the brew before the wonderful flavor hits the lips. Enjoy this one as it warms up."
"This offering from North Coast pours a onyx color leaving a tan head that is thick and luxurious. The aroma is strong hop citrus and earthy licorise feel followed by a sweet chocolate essence. The taste starts syrupy bitter with herbal hops that are abundant in this gem. The taste continues with marshmallow, chocolate, coffee roasted beans come though this brew. The finish is bitter espresso, but that caramel cooked sugar sweetness helps balance this big bitter beer. Overall this is an outstaning stout one that should be in my fridge year round. I paired this baby with a gourmet chocolate chip cookie and it was delicious."
"Pours and inky opaque black with a brown head that disapates to a ring. Molasses, smoke, bitter dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, chewing tobacco, spicey hops and alcohol in the nose. Prunes, very bitter, chocolate grit. Light smoke. Rather thin. Higher carbonation for the style. Slick and oily. Very good."
"I love this beer from start to finish. It's a blessing that it is available year 'round. It smells of yeast/ fresh dough and roasted malts. Bitter chocolate, a little coffe. Tastes roasty, chocolate, hint of coffee and every once in a while - licorice. More hop bitters and more roast distinguishes this one from its British relative, but this has to bridge the gap as well as being an all around benchmark for the style."
"Wow. So that's a really good, even-handed Russian imperial stout that does its work without tasting like a bag of sugar. Beauty of a label, too, with the spooky little wave from the Mad Monk."
"This is a kick-ass, make-your-head-spin stout that is so smooth and supple that it qualifies as ""dangerously easy to drink."" Godspeed."
"Impressively rich and deep array of flavors at first taste. So strong is Old Rasputin that this effect is lost near the end as my tongue slips into submission. I really like the hop flavors, they are a nice touch. Definitely worth a retry."
"Pours very dark, faint garnett highlights when held up to light. Lots of tan head with plenty of lacy. Aroma is a wonderful blend of chocolate and toffee with some fruitiness. Taste is carmel like initially, with some fruitiness. Dark, roasted malts dominate the finish and the alcohol becomes evident. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. I like this one, but I wouldn't want more than one. In addition to the high alcohol, too much roasted malt bitterness accumulates to enjoy more than one."
"The artful blending of flavors makes reviewing it kind of a chore because it is difficult to dissect exactly what you taste, and it is so smooth you just want to gulp it down. In fact if I have one complaint of this brew, it is that for an Imperial Stout it is almost a little too smooth, lacking a certain ""oomph"" factor on the palate. All this combined with creamy, silky-smooth mouthfeel make this a dangerously drinkable Imp. Stout, and it would be all to easy to end up smashed, knocking these back like nothing."
"D: At 9%, you're going to want to be careful with this. But should I have the opportunity to put a few of these away, I definitely would. Tremendous representation of the RIS."
"Pours with a decent amount of head, especially for a RIS, and a black color. Smell is a delicious mix of rich, roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is sweet, malty, and roasted with coffee notes and a nice, balanced hop finish. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with solid carbonation. Nicely drinkable, especially for the style as it is ONLY 9% ABV and smooth."
"A pretty awesome stout. Not exactly my cup of tea but this was an enjoyable drinking experience and I would recommend this to anybody looking for something good or any fan os stouts."
"The body of this RIS is thick and full bodied and creamy just the way it should be. Carbonation levels are fairly low as benefits the style. I'll most likely buy this brew again. It is great to warm up with after coming in out of the cold and being pounded by the elements. Not something that I could sit around and drink all day, and it shouldn't be. I don't think that any RIS is meant to be that way. Definitely something to slowly savor. However, I also know that there are other RIS's that represent the style differently and I would definitely love to try those before I came back to this one, but I would not be adverse to another go-round with this brew."
"Poured out a dark brown with a red hue. Tan head that was large, left lacing. Aroma of chocolate, roast, coffee, malt. Flavors chocolate, smoke, roast, a twinge of metallic, with alcohol warming seem to mule kick you in the senses. Mouth feel is a creamy, frothy, medium/high bodied with a moderate carbonation level. Definitely worth a keg, or case. Nice on a cold winter night like this one."
"I've had this a few times, and tonight I decided on a formal review. The bartender served it beautifully. The head was gorgeous, like every nitro-tapped stout should have and the black color was quite nice. The smell was standard stoutish, but gave off more of a sweet coffee flavor than a bitter coffee flavor and that was rather enticing. The taste really developed the sweetness to bring a very nice balance to the beer. The mouthfeel was better than average, but probably because it was a nitro tap and added to the smoothness. It was drinkable in all respects, and I will keep getting it on occasion, but have a hard time going through a few pints in a sitting."
"d: incredibly smooth easy drinking almost too easy and inviting for a beer of this strength, but I mean that entirely in a complimentary sense. This RIS has all the most impressive qualities of the style, worth repeated trips back."
"Pours pitch black with a nice 2, maybe 3, finger brown head and lacing that lasts until the end. When held to the light there are mere hints of ruby at the edges. Smells first of a hint of hops then strongly of sweet chocolately roasted malts. Great taste with lots of flavors. The sweet roasted malts dominate but as with the smell I am able to detect a hint of hop bitterness. I am able to pick out some coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and some dried fruits. A pleasantly bitter dark chocolate flavor lingers in the finish. Despite clocking in at 9% ABV the alcohol is masked quite well. Mouthfeel is great. Good, solid body that is thick without being chewy. This brew is also creamy and somewhat dry, very nice. Drinkability is excellent. This is a great interpretation of the style. Great taste with fairly complex flavors make this a treat."
"I had this one in a bottle for the first time. We cant get beers over 6% in south carolina, so i had to snag a couple when i was up in charlotte nc. this beer has so much character i dont know where to start. its a wonderful beer that you want to sit back and enjoy every sip you take"
"Poured to an opaque black, with dark tan head that reduced slowly to a thin film and left good lacing. Aroma was very malty roasted nuts, with hints of chocolate, dark fruit and toffee. Maybe I was just hungry, but later in the drink, I swear I could also smell grilled, smoked steak. Taste was more of what was found in the aroma (less the steak), and the 9%alcohol blended in nicely to be a perfect complement to the malty sweetness, as the beer warmed . This all combined to leave a very tasty, pleasant, warming finish. This was all it was touted to be."
"This beer was a little overrated by other users IMO. I had not read any reviews on this beer before drinking it at the bar. It had a nice apperance. Everything else was decent and slightly above average. Nice chocolate maltiness, but the alcohol is too dominant and needs balance. It needs a little more hoppiness to it as well. This beer was ok, but I think I'd pass on it for a different RIS."
"D: A RIS you've got to get your hands on. Very tasty and amazingly smooth. Excellent mouthfeel makes you want to drink the whole four pack. High alcohol doesn't get in the way even though it's very noticeable."
"D: The drinkability is limited by the 9.0% abv. The flavors meld well together though, creating a deeply complex ale that is smooth without knocking one out."
"a highly enjoyable beer! pours black with some faint ruby highlights; has a huge tan head that vanishes over time. smell is a bit faint compared to some other imperial stouts, but it does smell nice -- warm chocolate, hops, maybe toasted almonds. taste is phenomenal! chocolate and coffee hit you first, with hints of fruitiness and tobacco next, and a very bitter, but controlled, hoppy finish. mouthfeel is quite crisp, for the style, but that's not a detraction. creamy and smooth in the finish. dangerously drinkable, as it's not as demanding as some other imperials."
"Mouthfeel is good, mouthwatering even. Drinkability is excellent for a 9% ABV Imperial Stout. This is one of the best, and probably the ""best buy"" of big stouts."
" The taste has really dried out. Slightest touch of oxidation, roasted and chocolate malt. Mouthfeel has thinned, but is still chewy. Highly drinkable."
"9% alc."
"This poured an almost black with a large, cocoa-colored head. It left a nice, interesting retention that clung to the glass for quite a while before slipping back into the mix. A nice taste that combined french roast coffee and chocolate. Exceptionally creamy and smooth taste with the chocolate again and more roasts, but not with an overpowering, burnt taste like many in this genre. A very nice mouthfeel with just the right touch of carbonation. Incredibly drinkable especially considering the alcohol and the fact that it is a strong, Russian Imperial Stout. Fantastic beer, I'll have to have more."
"This stout definitely leans to the dry side of the spectrum. However, it is balanced enough to be remarkably drinkable. The extent to which the alcohol is hidden is admirable as well. I think it would shine best with food, however."
"Harsh AND pleasant, hard to desrcibe but this is an aggressive imperial stout that I can some up in one word, quality. Feels like more than 9 ABV, If you have more than one, watch out you will feel it the next day."
"D - a very enjoyable beer, to say the least. i've had this both in the bottle and in a glass, and i must say that the latter is certainly preferable. old rasputin is truly helping me relax before bed."
"This is an amazing beer, expecially since I only paid $2 for it. The 9%ABV and 12oz size makes this beer great for ending the night without going to far. It's also fitting as a desert. Highly recommended."
"Very drinkable. Very enjoyable."
"One of the standards for Russian Imperial Stouts. There is a little pub in my hometown that serves this on nitro. What a treat that is... but it's hard to have just one!"
"Although I haven't reviewed a younger version of this beer, I have tasted it, and I would recommend cellaring it for at least a year."
"This beer holds it's own when compared to other stouts in it's league. Give this one a try if it is available to you. You will not be sorry!"
"The body is full but some of the milkiness brings it down a bit. Some phenolics are present, but not suprising with the high ABV. A viscous feel as well. Overall it's a good brew to clone and well worth to drink."
"d - nice warming sensation and easily drinkable. terrific winter beer and i'm looking forward to one of these after a while of cellaring. i had cellared this one for about six months."
"Creamy but somewhat syrupy full-bodied mouthfeel. This is probably the most drinkable RIS I've tasted too, since the flavors are so subdued and there is almost no bitter aftertaste."
"Medium-full body with light carbonation. Very smooth for an imperial stout. I look at Old Raspy as kind of a baby imperial stout. I could see myself drinking these as long as I was standing though. Too delicious and easy to drink."
"poured out a near opaque garnett ruby, with a big, frothy mocha cap. i poured it too cold and the first scent i get is mineral-like. there is great sticky lacing as i drink down... warmth brings out it's character. viscous and creamy on the palette and nearly as chewy as an oreo cookie... yet richer. big notes of toffee, coffee, 63% cocoa, vanilla and hints of anise and pepper make for a tasty beer. dangerously drinkable... i had three of them back to back once and it kicked my ass, especially the next day. approach with tasty discretion."
"If you could ever claim a beer can warm you up, this is the one. Complex dark oak flavor with nodes of coffee, chocolate, a bit of caramel, roasty malts, and yet the beer isn't sweet at all. The alcohol is hidden very well, making this a highly drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is full and chewy. This beer is thick, and here to warm you up. The perfect compliment to a cold winter night."
"Enjoy!"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and good. Just like it should be. I could easily make this the only beer I ever drink again, but who would want to do that. Overall you can't go wrong with this brew."
"Drinkable: There's lots of alcohol and the flavor profile is intense, but this is much more quaffable than it has any right to be."
"Awesome beer for cold nights in front of a fire. Next time I'm drinking it with a cigar, which I think will make for an awesome pairing."
"D: Very tasty, quite easy-to-drink, not as filling as other beers in the style, this is a beer that can be a sipper or a pounder, even if the ABV creeps up on you. I think this beer is an excellent representation of style and definitely one of the better RIS's that I've had."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer, and a great example for the Russian Imperial Stout (RIS? Why does IPA get an acronym and no one else does?). Very highly recommended, and right up there with the best ones I've tried (Stone and Samuel Smith)"
"I probably wouldnt drink more than a few of these but it is pretty drinkable."
"Bottle - poured with a nice thick, brown head which disipated over 10 minutes as it warmed from its over refridgerated temperature. This RIS had a big, full mouth feel and flavor. Specifically, what really stood out to me as I sipped it after a big steak was a really nice burnt malt flavor followed by a smooth dark chocolate linger. Unlike some in this class, there was really no strong sense of alcohol for its high ABV. While drinking several in an evening may not be in order, one or two will really work well after a steak or on a cold winter evening."
"D - Now: Easy to drink, definitely recommended if you are at a bar that serves it. Later: It will be like drinking thinned out fruity, chocolatey, roasted coffee infused caramel, which I personally would thoroughly enjoy."
"M: A wonderful full body. Excellent carbonation. A very drinkable stout."
"This is a seriously great imperial stout. I can't think of a better version."
"It's a syrupy and thick feel. Leaves a heavy residue on the tongue. It's a very good beer, but it's a one-and-done for this advocate. It's way too heavy for me to have more than one per night. Maybe one per month."
"This ain't your daddy's stout, that's for sure."
"A nice stout for desert after a meal."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" brown head over the barely translucent reddish dark brown brew. Head is down an uneven layer of bubbles pretty quick, with slow-falling lacing. Aroma is heavy, rich dark malts, chocolate and coffee doing battle, just what you expect and want in the style. Taste follows along in the same vein, but even better with the slow warm on the swallow. Mouthfeel is velvety, and drinkability is excellent. This one is ranked highly for a reason."
"Old Rasputin pours a virtually opaque espresso brown color. Its head; rich, foamy, and deep mocha in color, hangs tough for a few moments. Rich and viscous, it covers the inside of the glass with an unctuous coating. Essences of roasted chicory and hazelnuts soar from the glass. Well-roasted malts and vanillin are in attendance as well, as there are hints of some oak also; a nose reminiscent of Weyerbachers ""Prophesy"". The taste is creamy, soft and unctuous in the mouth. Profound flavors of roasted carob and coffee offset by slightly bittersweet chocolate round out the package here. Amazingly drinkable for a brew of such concentration and depth, the medium body, light bitterness, and very soft acids make this a brew to engorge one self with. An iconic textbook version of the style. Truly a taste sensation!"
"I finally got around to picking this one up and as soon as I tasted it I quickly got plenty more. This was a simply amazing stout with tons of character and complexity. It poured a straight black hue with a rocky brown head. Smelled of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and alcohol. It tasted great it was smooth with flovors of chocolate, coffee, smoked and burnt malt, hints of hops, even a sweet little finish. All around loved this beer."
"d= This was an excellent stout. Could easily drink more than one."
"Anyways, I only have one word to describe this: Excellent!"
"M: Medium body, char sticks around in the palate long after each sip. This one asserts its presence long after the glass is empty."
"Drinkability: One is enough, but that one is extremely satisfying. No one will ever mistake this for Coors."
"Very easy drinking for a RIS. Very good."
"D - A good cold weather, one-serving beer. One of my top RIS selections and an excellent representation of North Coast."
"This is a great beer that I would definitely try again. However, you will most likely not want more than one of these in a night."
"And Id be wrong! Oh, this viscous, delectable drink is every bit as good as I remember. Creamy & almost sweet at first, becoming bitter (but in the best sense of the word) after spreading across the palate. The malt presence is intense & the alcohol is certainly detectable, but every flavor works so well together that its hard not to love. To add to the sin-factor, I paired this with a little dark chocolate & have to say that I prefer the beer on its own. An exceptional brew whose only detractor is that it doesnt lend itself to all-night consumption (although at 9% ABV, that could be a very short night!)."
"Overall, this beer is like grabbing a handful of fruit and spice flavored dark chocolates and jamming them in your mouth. Excellent!"
"Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout pours jet black with a thin tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is dominated by dark chocolate. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel, the flavor has dark chocolate notes and coffee notes as well. The alcohol seems well hidden. Excellent beer, recommended."
"Minimal head and carbonation. Smell and taste place it high as being a drinkable brew. Though lack of carbonation has left me critical of some other stouts, it is a non-issue here as I really didn't miss it. Once again I seem to have made a proper choice in that I have a whole case of this to enjoy."
"Drinkability and other notes- This beer keeps you wanting more. The alcohol is very upfront, but it tastes excellent. I could see this beer possibly getting better with age."
"It tastes exceptionally smooth. Full hop character rises through strong roasted coffee and caramel flavor. I have trouble sipping this beer. It is like candy. The alcohol is present but I notice it more as it warms my stomach than in my mouth. I had planned on letting the other 3 bottles age but it will be a struggle."
"D- Something to slowly enjoy, have bought plenty of this beer and plan to buy plenty more"
"I may have met my match here though as I dozed off for a few minutes in the tub clutching my notepad! If Breckenridge Vanilla Stout is the high watermark then this is me undertow and drowning. The Beer Cave of American brews (so far!)!!!"
"Pours dark blackest coffee and a tan head with light high lights on edges. The head is mild and seems it will slowly fade except on the edges. Sents of coffee, caramel, dark chocolate and hops. The taste is robust, well balanced, coffee and chocolate present with a tinge of bitterness. The finish is little bitter, but only in the best way as in a great after taste. This is a nice beer, I would definitely buy it again."
"drinkability: one of the best russian imperial style stouts ive had."
"Yet another fantastic beer from North Coast. They almost never disappoint."
"Overall, I like this Russian Imperial Stout alot, especially at room temperature. While it is smooth to drink, it's quite intense and well balance w/ roasted elements, alcohol and body. Careful the ABV is 9% and will kick you in the ass."
"Quite a good beer in the style. A little to strong for an everyday beer. Would go very nice as an enjoyable beer with a cigar as an afer dinner drink. If looking for something in this style, don't pass this up."
"D- It was a very simple beer lacking complexity. Not to strong flavors. Not much going on with the beer at all. Smelled good though. Is drinkable but nothing special at all."
"This is a great return beer. But not a session beer."
"dangerously drinkable for this caliber of beer."
"D-about as good as an RIS can be. I wish I had another."
"Pours dark black with a creamy tan head that sticks all over the glass. Dark roasted malt aroma with a bit of cocoa, coffee and nuts. Taste is smooth with a lot of roasted malt, a bit of bitter chocolate, coffee and hops. There is a seemingly never ending bitterness to the finish. Overall, North Coast really did an excellent job with this RIS and should be commended."
"This is a very drinkable beer especially for an imperial stout. Definately worth picking up."
"D: This has quickly became one of my favorite beers of all time. I can drink it like water and I drink it very often. Very easy to drink for something of such high ABV. I really can't see it getting much better than this."
"I've been hearing about this beer for a while and I finally was lucky enough to find a fourpack at hyvee for 9 bucks. I went back a few days later and not a trace was left. It pours black. Not inky black like some others but dark enough. The amazing part is that you can see the bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass to the top! I don't know what is causing it and it's the firts time i've ever seen in it. Head retention is pretty good not that I care. It smells like the typical Imperial stout, burnt. It tastes pretty complex for suck a heavy beer. I can detect a bit of citrus and rose on the front of the toungue. Maybe a little bitter for my taste but still delicious. The picture of Rasputin on the front is great. I'm surprised I found this in august as i usually thing of imperial stout as a winter drink."
"Poured absolutely pitch black into the venerable old globe glass, with little head and a small amount of lacing. The smell is of dark chocolate and coffee with a matching, very dry taste and noticeable alcohol in the finish. The mouth feel is very heavy and silky. As enjoyable as this beer is, I dont think that I would tempt fate by having two, but this is easily a beer that one could have in place of a brandy and desert after a good meal."
"I looked forward to trying this beer. It poured black with only a small head that went down to mostly a ring around the glass. I held it up to a lamp and could not see any light coming through at all. It had a roasted smell similar to coffee beans. The taste started bitter and then turned to coffee and some bitter, dark chocolate. There is some alcohol in the aftertaste and it lasted a long time. The mouthfeel is the most interesting thing about this beer. It is smooth, oily and thick and coats the inside of your mouth. This is a slow sipper. It went down easier as it warmed up (and maybe as it warmed me up). Overall, this is an intense beer. The bitterness, heaviness and ABV keeps me from having too many. I'd like to try one that has aged to see if it smooths out a bit."
"D - Very drinkable. This is a very tasty RIS, North Coast is a very nice brewer."
"D- Very good sipper. Shouldn't drink fast. Very well-balanced flavors. Awesome beer."
"-Oelergud"
"For me, the perfect time for this beer is at night while I'm settling down and watching TV. It usually takes me about an hour to get through, as it's not the sort of thing that I could - or even want to - just pound down."
"Black, black body. There should be a word that expresses a darker color than black. This would be it. It's topped with a dark tan head, too. The head settles down into a skim but never completely disappears. The smell is dry, bitter bakers chocolate. But sweet, too. An excellent balance. Taste is huge. It all wraps itself up into a beery, chocolaty dream with 9% alcohol. Taste is smooth, but with a bit of alcohol harshness at the very last part of the swallow. This is a fine beer."
"notes- a very strong beer. not something i would make a session beer. a good brew to have every now and then im my opinion."
"I'm never really sure what to give a beer for its appearance as opposed to what I have seen in the past, but this beer most definitely deserves the top. After its poured there is absolutely no light that passes through it, even when the glass is tilted. Really Impressive. The smell has to be teased out but is mostly like sweet grains and dark malts. The taste is just phenomenal. Its big, but is really well mixed. There is a lot of traditional stout flavor, but lots of chicory on top of it. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both great, again with a big flavor that is really well balanced."
"The nose offers plenty of anticipation with prunes, molasses and prunes. Thick mouth. The beginning is smokey, earthy, toasted malts. Bittersweet chocolate notes. A little sharp tartness rounds out the hops balance. Towards the bottom some traces of woodsy oak, port wine, and even cherry come through. This beer I will definitly drink again, and probably North Coast's top beer."
"Overall: Although this beer is good, it is far from my favorite Imperial Stout. The aggressive flavor can sometimes be cloying. I will drink it again, but usually I buy it because of its great availability. It is slightly overrated."
"Not as heavy as some imperial stouts I've tried. Very good for sipping. I would probably rate this higher if the hops were a little less apparent."
"This has improved so much with a year in the cellar. Fresh, it was abusingly bitter, and, if I remember well, far too hoppy. That has all changed, and I have some more left!"
"D - It is a very good stout. It is very powerful in terms of ABV, which is a slight drawback. I wanted to have many more but two was my limit."
"D: For the alcohol content this is very drinkable, and not heavy as would be expected. This is one hell of a damn good beer. I will be getting this again, and as often as possible. I highly reccomend it."
"Very drinkable. I'm a sucker for anything with a long bitter finish and some complexity. If the body were a little heftier, this would be a 5 as well. I've enjoyed this beer for many years in bottles and on tap, and I think its still kickin."
"Drinkability: Maybe not the best thing to try in the middle of August, but this would be great to warm you up in the winter. I think the high ABV would preclude having too many, but there is a lot more here than just high alcohol level. Great beer."
"Drinkability: I could have about two then my stool would turn completely black."
"I could drink a couple of these at one sitting but wouldn't want to down a case of them."
"Yes, it tastes great also. Bitter and dry, this baby has a whole lot of roasted flavor going on. Coffee, chocolate, and alcohol blend together with other wondrous estery flavors to make a thoroughly delicious beer. Feels good on the tongue and in the back of the throat. Scarily drinkable for such a ""thick"" beer."
"I couldn't even finish it halfway. God I feel like a prick. Wasted such a good beer on a drain pour, but it was just undrinkable to the max. Overwhelming flavors topped with alcohol that seemed like there was 5 shots of rum in it. Maybe I'm not ready for a real beer, or the other beers I had earlier in the day maxed out my consumption for the day. I'll start with this next time because it was just beautiful beer. Darkest I've ever seen with a head that filled a hefe glass with just a 12 oz bottle. Suprised that the lacing wasn't that heavy. Very well done on the appearance, but drinkability? Horrid. Don't get me wrong, the taste is awesome in about 200 different ways, but blah! Feels like you have to choke it down, and that makes it completely un-enjoyable."
"This is an immensely enjoyable beer."
"Pours a black as midnight black, looking like overused motor oil. Great brown head that sticks around, leaving behind great lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, rasin sweetness, hints of alcohol...hard to stop smelling really. One of the best tasting Imperial Stouts I've ever had. Tastes of dark chocolate, coffee, malty sweetness, with a light hop dryness hitting you in the middle, ending off with an alcohol warming and lots of hop bitterness. The coffee/chocolate overtones staying with your palate long after each sip. Mouthfeel was pretty oily and thick, but not sludge like thick as would be expected from the appearance. Very pleasant creaminess and not too much carbonation. I've tried many Imperial Stouts as it is a favorite genre of mine, and Old Rasputin blows many out of the water. It's not that hard to find around where I live and the price isn't exhorbitant either. Northcoast should be proud of this exemplary brew."
"M&D - smooth and silky, very tasty, the only drawback is that the ABV is highish and the alcohol flavor is rather strong, but a great stout"
"Drinkability: best RIS i've had so far!"
"Dcant drink a lot of it due to the high ABV, but this is perfect for the style, I think. A great nightcap."
"An excellent Russian Imperial Stout, has a lot of compexity and depth. Rich, satisfying, and friendly on the palate. Definitely check this one out."
"Definitely a sipping beer."
"Overall. A great RIS and an incredible beer! A perfect sipper, yet Im drinking this quicker than I expected, I could probably finish it in about 30-40 minutes. Just great balance and great flavors. One excellent beer I am glad I can pick up in baton rouge."
"Medium high bitterness."
"But worth a try."
"Overall, a fine example of the style, and another fine beer from North Coast."
"Like I said, I have enjoyed other RIS's before, Sam Smith's is my fave, but I think Old Rasp is a little high on the ABV at 9%. It makes it too heavy more my taste buds to handle."
"Between this and Stone Russian Stout I am now a fan of the this style. The beer pours like black crude. Thick and dark with creamy tan head. Smelling immeditely after opening the bottle I definately get a smell of smoke, chocolate, and malt. The taste is slightly bitter at first but then goes on to sweet smokiness. Hints of smoked almonds and a bit of coco. You can definately taste the alcohol in the background. Moutfeel is not bad at all either. I prefer Stone Russian Stout by just a hair because the Russian Stout has just a tiny but more alcohol bite which I prefer. But don't get me wrong I would drink either happily. The drinkability is a tiny bit better with Old Rasputin but some of that might be because it comes in smaller bottles so its a little more cold then having a 22 of Stone sitting there getting warm."
"Its a drinkable beer; its a little intense."
"Overall, I was very impressed with this stout. I would recommend it to anyone. It's is probably the best RIS I've had so far for taste and smell."
"I poured this from the bottle into a glass and was really impressed with the deep black color, it has only a hint of ruby hues if you hold it up to a light. The head is a dark khaki tan that laces the glass nicely. The smell is really complex roasted and chocolate malts dominate. The first couple of sips present a bitterness that seems almost overwhelming but this soon mellows out once you become used to it and then you can really taste the chocolate malt flavors. Despite the high alcohol content the alcohol isn't that noticable but the beer does have a nice warming quality. I don't know if I would want to try drinking more than one in a sitting just because of the really powerful flavor but it is definitely one i'll buy again."
"This is a robust and balanced ale which Im glad to have acquired. Makes me want to try more of this style in a huge way."
"...not in this case"
"Not a big fan of the hoppy bitterness, but the coffee and chocolate flavors that jump out are delicious."
"D: So delicious, worthy of more than one. A sipping beer due to higher abv, but a beer I could (and did) have more than one of."
"I am glad this is now in Roots, because I will wish to have it at least once a month, very nice."
"I'll probably save the last couple bottles of my four-pack and let them age a bit. I have a feeling a little time will make this one a real treat."
"D - amazing brew, give it a try. Despite higher alcohol and full body, I could drink several of these in an evening and not tire of it."
"Looks delicious, dark black with a red-brown hue peeking out from the bottom of the glass, with a massive, bubly and creamy head that is comparable to the color of, say, wheat bread, for lack of a better comparative. Smells like an american variation on the grassy english ale aroma--more piney and resinous--but the aroma is rather gentle for an imperial stout. Hmm. More like a straght ahead stout. The taste is malty and focused, with a charred finish that tastes, again, mostly like a standard stout. This may have some time on it, in which case, considering style, this is how it would taste after reaching Russia. The expectedly intense hops have mellowed out I think, comparing it to when I had it fresh on tap months prior. The hops again are american, piney, and slightly floral even. Mouthfeel is medium and well- or possibly over- carbonated. Stout like in feel, not as heavy as anticipated, but not light either. Overall, I am not a fan of the hop profile here. Nor do I love the less than smooth, charred malts that acompany it in the finish. This is a very good beer, but it is not the best of style. Tastes more like an american stout than an imperial stout, but it somehow hides the 8% well. I love the label and russian phrases. North Coast is consistently good, despite brewing beers that don't personally appeal to my palate enough to be my pick as favorites given their style. Drinking this left me dreaming of Storm King, which I find delicious both on tap and in the bottle, while this was absolutely better on tap."
"Overall, a very nice example of Russian Imperial Stout. I will have this again and recommend it to others, esopecially stout fans. Great beer!"
"Drinkability - night cap beer!"
"Wish I had this a few months back during the cold weather. I'll have to revisit this next winter."
"Pours dark black with an almost purple tinge and 3 fingers of caramel-colored head. Smells of coffee, caramel, and grapes (reminds me of something like a shiraz from the wine world). Tastes unlike it smells. I taste wood and oak, although the coffee and caramel is still present. High marks for mouthfeel - it is creamy and lingers nicely. The alcohol is masked nicely - especially at first - but it becomes more present as the beer warms. Overall, a nice representation of the style but not astounding."
"I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who likes beer and coffee or beer and chocolate of any type. I warned my dad, who loves dark chocolate, that he'd better drink the bottle I offered him that night or else it was liable to disappear from the fridge. My willpower is such that the same bottle has just been reviewed."
"Bottom line: This is a world class sample of the style that is a *must* to try."
"i found marshmallows and smoke in the front, with burnt dark chocolate and dried dark fruits going down. halfway in, the dark-fruit character really took over, still laced with that nice bitter-burnt tingle. overall, really nicely balanced and totally enjoyable, but slow drinking with that thick-as-night mouthfeel...and one was plenty!"
"Finally reviewing this beer. This was one of my first better beers (before I was a BA) and I have tried it since both in the bottle and on-tap, and even have one aging, but somehow haven't reviewed it. 12 oz. stubby with no freshness date. It pours almost black with a quarter-inch of light brown head that reduces to a collar and doesn't leave much lacing. It smells of big, dark roasted malts, cocoa, chocolate, blackberry, and chocolate-covered cherries. It tastes like coffee, dark, unsweet chocolate, and lots of hops (green, piney, leafy, oily, maybe citric) that contribute a big bitterness. The beer has a good balance, with lots of malts and hops, on top of a medium to thick body that leaves a very long finish. A great beer that I will always come back to revisit."
"Quite nice, perhaps my favourite of the Imperial Stouts I've had. One more thank you to orrshow for giving me the bottle."
"Overall, the hype around this one is well deserved. At 9%, I know I can't drink as much as I'd like to, but this is a great sipping brew!"
"D: This beer definitely wants to travel in groups! One just won't do it. I don't know if I want this all night, but 2 after a hard day will definitely take the edge off. Overall Highly enjoyable, and a great way to end a tough day or a great meal."
" This very well may be the most drinkable RIS I have ever had. Drinks like a stout with half the ABV. I'm impressed."
"Mouthfeel is very dry and somewhat bitter. A terrific contrast to the RIS i've been sampling lately."
"Here is the biggest problem I could find with Old Rasputin. I drank this one side by side with the Raspberry Weyerbacher, which has currently taken over as the best reviewed beer in Backer2004's history to this point. It's just an outstanding beer when paired with white and dark chocolate but didn't complement as well as the aformentioned. Lovely deep dark color, nice mix of caramel and chocolate taste, rather easy to drink. Will definitely search for this one and try my own bottle."
"D: Massively complex. Abundantly tasty. A masterpiece of a beer."
"Pours black with a dark tan head, which was very small. Sweet chocolate and burnt aromas, this has a more powerful smell for a russian imperial stout. Taste is very powerful, sweeter than most, with a noticable alcohal flavor (not suprising considering the ABV). A bitter aftertaste leaves you wanting more. A good balance in flavor, not much carbonation which adds to the mouthfeel. I could have a couple of these after dinner or for a nice nightcap. This is not to pricey and is well worth trying. A great russian imperial stout to start out on, not to much ABV, but enough flavor to tell you if you like the style. Do yourself a favor and try this beer. Cheers!"
"Cheers."
"This poured a deep, oily black, without much color around the edges and a carmel colored head. The smell was pretty complex with lots of tones of malts, roasted to sweet, and a slight hop presence. The taste was the standout character of this beer for me. Very coffee and chocolaty, both bitter roast and sweet. It is very deep and creamy. The alcohol is apparent but not overpowering. Not the most drinkable, but a few can be fine."
"I always pick up some of this when I find it..unfortunately, I can't get it in my immediate area yet. Always mentioned among the great stouts, this is one that is certainly worth trying."
"It was very drinkable - a worthwhile and delicious treat!"
"Notes: excellent beer. Why is it on nitro? No reason, in my opinion this is just a way to market it as a guinness...I heard this many times throughout the night...bartender "" its similair to a guiness but slightly stronger"" ...ok."
"overall, this is my favorite imperial stout so far, it strikes a lovely balance of flavors as far as i'm concerned. definitely a must try beer."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I don't think it's on par with the ""top"" RISs, but very respectable nonetheless. I like that this is relatively affordable and easy to find."
"D: The combination of pleasant flavors and great mouthfeel combine to make this a very well balanced beer. This makes the beer very easy to drink. I don't typically think of stouts as a casual beer, but this one is a great reminder of how pleasant a dark beer can be."
"This will be my second of three planned reviews of this beer. My only problem with it, is that is has too much hop bitterness when fresh. It's almost like eating mouthfulls of grapefruit and chocolate pieces together and washing them down with coffee. Not exactly my idea of a tasty treat. So, what I have planned, is to rate this aged about 6 months, and then again in a year. So far, tonights session shows that Rasputin does, with time, improve. The 6 month old example poured the same colour as a fresh one, obviously. The smell, however, seemed noticeably sweeter. Lots of stewed fruit and loads of chocolate and caramel. The taste, while improved, still has that hop bitterness that I am trying to age away. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth and drinkability was a bit better than a fresh example. We'll see what 12 - 14 months worth of aging does to Rasputin around Christmas '06 or Jan. '07."
"Overall this is an excellent RIS. It's widely available, which gives you very little excuse to not try it."
"D- Drink slow to enjoy it. Very good Russian Imperial stout and I would definitely go and grab a few more."
"Very smooth and very flavourful."
"Very dark brown to almost black in color with a tan head that dissipates leaving some lacing. Nose is bursting with chocolate, coffee, maybe a hint of vanilla and cherry in there as well. Chocolate, espresso, and molasses with a hop bitterness in the end make up the taste. Mouthfeel has pretty low carbonation, maybe a little less would make it perfect, definately full bodied and thick. This beer is just wonderful, I definately need to get some more."
"Stouts are becoming more and more one of my favorite styles and the Rasputin is near the top of the list. This baby pours black. Big thick head that mostly diminishes. Big time strong coffee aroma and wonderful dark chocolate. Taste matches the smell, for the most part. Not much of an alcohol taste, but one can feel the warmth. This is right on style. I've had this on tap and in the bottle. This is great and relatively cheap and accessible RIS."
"D- This is an all around great stout and one of my favorites. With this session, I had it with a slice of DQ ice cream cake. Oh man, that's good. This is a great dessert beer by itself, but it added to the overall enjoyment. Now that my local beer store is carying North Coast beers, I will keep this on hand."
"The drinkability of this beer is great in my book. I would not want to drink more than 3 or so. But if you like the style, and don't mind a strong taste of alcohol, then this is an imperial stout to enjoy after a long day."
"Pitch black except for ruby hues at the edges. Thick tan head that recedes slowly, but lasts the whole way down. Lacing is very good. Smells strongly of roasted coffee and very dark chocolate, some caramel. Tastes very strongly of roasted coffee with hints of sweet caramel, but the chocolate from the smell is missing from the taste. Alcoholic bite right at the end that I like very much. Mouthfeel is right where it should be for a stout. The only thing really holding this brew back is it's drinkability. With an alcohol content of 9%, I can't see myself drinking more than 2 a night. Overall, one of my favorites. Even at 7 dollars a 4 pack, it's worth it."
"Good drinkability for an RIS, at only 9%. Definitely worth the price."
"D: Very nice. The bitterness, roast acidity and herbal nuances sweep this large, sweet beer down the pipes."
"A very drinkable 9.00% ABV beer."
"The pour gives way to what looks like it could be a mixture of cola and coffee. Nose is full of roastiness, and dark fruits like plums and raisins. There's a bit of tartness in the nose that I don't care for. Taste is layer upon layer of different kinds of chocolate, sweet chocolate, bakers choclate, and cocoa. This is offset by a bit of molasses and some tartness. The tartness seems a bit out of place. Mouthfeel is near perfect with light carbonation to welcome the liquid to the tongue. If this wasn't so strong I'd definitely session it. Kudos North Coast!"
"This beer is everything i expect from an imperial stout, very thick, rich, and tasty."
"12 ounce bottle. Old Rasputin pours out a nearly black color with a huge brown head. Strong aroma of coffee, molasses, chocolate, and fruit. The flavor is very roasty with bitter coffee. Chocolate, licorice, and peat. Finishes acidic, with noticable hop flavor. Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than expected, but it works well with this beer. Drinkability is quite good. If you're a fan of roasty stouts, this is definitely one to try."
"Wow - I had this a long time ago and did not remember or realize what a great beer it is. And a super bargain too! Cheers to North Coast."
" What can you say? This is pretty amazing. Go get some, no matter how much you have to shell out. If you like stout and you haven't tried this, you are not being all you can be as a stout drinker. What are you waiting for? Go get some.."
"Glad I've got the other three to look forward to."
"D: I had no problem drinking it I thought it was wonderful but it is not a beer for those just getting into the beer snobbery. It's a big powerful beer that must be handled with care."
"A 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass, a dark opaque black, slightly brown, with a small caramel colored head. The scent of chocolate and coffee are very nice aroma, that is followed by a twinge of hops. The taste starts with the chocolate and the sweetness of the malt. It ends with a slight coffee bitterness, with a touch of hops. In the mouth it is rich and full bodied, it has the texture of two percent milk and seemingly coats the tongue, which allows the the flavor to linger. This is a very good beer, there are many imperial stouts, this one may stands the closest to the style."
"M/D: Eh - not sure what to say here. A fine example of the style, but didn't leave me begging for more. Glad I had a 4-pack, but I am not rushing to buy more."
"The aroma is rich with coffee, vanilla, espresso and chocolate malts. No hop presence is evident, this is nothing but a rich flavorful malt The moutful is smoothe and slightly creamy. A small bitter tinge is evident but this is true imperial stout. All the flavors from the nose ar ethere and mesh together in such a mellow nice way. A couple of these is a meal in itself. A treat that should never been had in abundance so that you may really savor the souts very nature."
"I liked the beer, not my favorite of the dark ones but a pleasure nonetheless."
"It has a fairly dry finish. I rate this one highly drinkable. I am wishing that I had one more."
"This is a drinkable beer, but heavy, filling and a little long on ABV. Its good but I wouldnt want to have it very often, not more than one or two in a sitting, and I wouldnt want to drink them very fast. Certainly not an every day experience."
"Very dark brown letting no light through except on the edges. The head is very small, light tan, creamy and quickly diminishing to a ring. But still it leave some good rings of lacing early on. The smell is on the mild side for an imperial stout. Lots of darks bread accompanied by chocolate, light coffee and light molasses. The taste is of moderately sweet roasted (slightly burnt) malts supported by alcohol and some light herbal hops. More chocolate and more coffee than in the nose. The slightly astringent finish combined with the warming alcohol give your cheeks and tongue a bit of a tingle. It has a full body, slick texture and soft, low carbonation. As far as the style goes, this isnt a heavy-hitter. But again as far as the style goes, this is rather easy drinking. Nicely done. Id definitely drink this again if I ever find it again."
"I was dissapointed that they were only available in a 4-pack, and that was before I even got to try one... I'm headed back to the store."
"Recommended, but how much I'm not sure, as I've yet to try many russian imperial stouts."
"Da: The bitter, somewhat sticky finish takes away some degree of the drinkability for me. I love stouts and a nice long finish is always welcome, but here it is a bit exagerated."
"Drinkability: Unreal! You would never guess the alcohol in this one. Beware."
"If you haven't had this beer before... Try it: Today!"
"Pours a heavenly black heavy brew with a half inch bubble head that subsides to a thin covering. Aromas carry that dark roasted smell paired with some dark chocolate and a good deal of alcohol. Texture isn't all to heavy and high carbonation brings down the mouthfeel and drinkability a bit. I enjoy these heavier beers with a bit less. Anyway, flavors are particularly drying and hoppy towards the end with the carbonation and alcohol both making quite a sting. I really enjoy the roasted flavors, I just wish the bubbliness would be decreased as well as the body increase."
"drinkability - is great at first really cold, but it gets a bit too bitter and fuel-tasting after a while. this is one of the better RIS, but its good just every now and then"
"Poured nearly black with a minor head which refused to leave the surface. A dull coffee/chocolate smell with a hint of hops is present. The taste is quite the combination of flavors ranging from coffee to fruit. I noted a smooth chocolate start balanced with cherry/coffee/and dark roasted malts that finished with a clearly evident hop character. I would prefer more hops over the coffee, but still an enjoyable brew here. Very interesting combination, and a great start to the ""new to me"" world of imperial stouts."
"Nice appearance. Muted brown/black, with a great tan head and nice lacing. The smell is fairly hoppy, but with some some softness to them, and of course, very roasted malts and a very slight fruitiness. Excelent complex flavor, burnt malts, coffee, nice hops, and the lingering flavor of dry, bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel is slighly thick, but very velevety. No oiliness, but just dry enough to cut the thickness. This is a pretty freakin good imperial stout, but too complex and rich to drink much of."
"Excellent smooth mouthfeel though, and a pleasant bitter aftertaste with slight brown-sugary notes. Food note: Tastes great with some good pecan pie."
"Barely translucent dark brown with ruby-garnet highlights and a thick, frothy espresso crema head. Clean smelling aromas of chocolate and light roasted coffee; toasted grains and earthy piney hops. Dark coffee flavors predominate at first. Spicy pinecone hops mixed with an acidic vinous quality overtake during the middle. Bitter coffee finish, but hops ride it on through to the sour mineral aftertaste. Alcohol warms down the throat. Moderate body, a bit thin for the style, actually, and somewhat slick. Seems as if it could be dry, if the sour finish didn't get in the way. This acidity mellows somewhat at about mid-bottle. Much less interesting than I expected. Underwhelming, to say the least."
"Drinkability  Warms the belly. This is a very full RIS, you could not have more that two but it is very tasty and interesting."
"It does not drink like a 9% ale, like some 9% Belgians I've tasted that leave me with a headache forming. I'm ready for another."
"Drinkability: Obviously not a session beer, but not a bad bar price tag and certainly not over the top in price at the beer store. I like this beer very much and recommend it to anyone who likes stouts."
"There is a fabulous bar out in western Massachusetts that caries this on tap. It was served in a goblet and was a thick black color with a dark brown head. It smelled of roasted coffee, almonds, chocolate, and a hint of alcohol. This beer has a good heavy mouth feel with a mellow carbonation that gives it an almost creamy feel when you swallow. It has a thick chocolate malt taste with a few shots of espresso to boot. After I swallowed I noticed a bit of a sweet dull fruit finish to it, not overly hoppy for sure. This beer was a great experience, I would recommend it as a sipping beer to fully enjoy... and the 9.0 abv has a way of sneaking up on you if you over drink this brew. Enjoy!"
"I love the label on this beer. Could be the scariest looking guy I've ever seen on a beer bottle. The beer pours a nice black color with a smallish head that disappears quickly. The aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate and alcohol. This is a mighty fine tasting brew with a huge malty flavor and a nice hint of hops too. I would say this is one of the best Imperial Stouts out there. It's very drinkable indeed."
"The mouthfeel is too sticky and syrupy. Drinkability is about avg or a little better than avg for this style."
"Hints of charcoal, toffee, caramel, and chocolate emanate from this beauty and it coats the mouth with a wonderfully smooth malty sweetness that gives balance to the mouthfeel. I've found the beer to be less bitter from the bottle than it is when it's served on-tap which I found a bit odd, but I'm not complaining!! The finish is a bold coffee flavor at first but rounds out with a hint of creamy-sweetness. A great beer to sip or tip, but watch out though; with a 9% ABV its effects have tendency to sneak up on you!"
"D: I'm a little disapointed with this after first having it on draft. Overall, it is a solid stout at a fair price ($7.99/4-pack), however I don't find it exemplary when compared to its contemporaries."
"Very drinkable beer! Its sneaky though, you dont taste or even get a warming from the alcohol but it hit me pretty hard since I had not eaten in a great while. I got the full effect of the 9%! Even more prepared Id have to limit myself, this is an addictive beer."
"Overall: a huge, wonderful beer that will knock your socks off. Instead of Rasputin, call it the Big Jim Slade of beers."
"Beware the high ABV Old Rasputin...I swear, each bottle has an actual ""Little Old Rasputin"" who finds his way into your head, causing much confusion and havoc, especially if more than one or two gather there at the same time - which is to be expected, given the crazy old coot's rasputation, I mean, reputation and all...See, he's up to his old trick's again, that wily Old Rasputin..."
"A gentle pour produces a black beer with some dark ruby highlights around the edges near the glass. A virtually non-existent tan head clings to the side of the glass but disappears on it's way toward the middle. The aroma is pleasant with chocolate and roasted malts, as well as some raspberry overtones. Upon tasting it provides a dark chocolate - almost burnt - flavor with a slight alcohol finish. Bitter and a little bit hot in the mouth, this is definitely a sipping beer, but enjoyable and satisfying nonetheless."
"Pours an absolute opaque black with a thin tan head which laces the glass nicely. Equal amounts of roasted malty goodness and alcohol in nose, maybe some traces of sweetness as well. Again, roasted maltiness in taste with very strong coffee like flavours. Very sweet and alcoholic in taste. However, it is very smooth and drinkable. Definately full bodied and very rich. Overall, a very impressive brew. Very strong in both character and abv. One of my favourites in the style, although I am none too experienced with imperial stouts."
"Wow! I sampled this from a jockey box on nitro at a beer festival. Talk about a glass of pure love! The head was thick, dense, and creamy. I loved the floor show of bubbles cascading down the glass. Roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, this tasted absolutely wonderful. Rich mouthfeel that hit every single taste bud in my mouth. It's good in the bottle, but if you get a chance get it on tap!"
"Notes: I have yet to be impressed by an imperial stout. I have not tried the best ones, only Samuel Smith's and this one, but I much prefer barleywines. They balance out flavors and don't try to overload you on one. This is a nice after dinner beer, but I don't think I'll be buying it again any time soon. As far as I'm concerned, Shakespeare Stout is a good enough stout for me."
"D- Small bottle but lots and lots going for it. True to the style -- just right in my opinion. No 5's because I'm not knocked out of my chair, but very, very good. I'm rather sad that it's gone."
"What an excellent beer. Your really cannot say enough about it. pours pitch black with not a large head and not a great amount of lacing. Smell was of course roasted malts alittle bit of sourness. Thes taste was awesome. Ive had this beer a half dozen times and it gets better every time. Chocolate, coffee, i detected some hazelnut but that could just be my imagination running wild with how much i love this beer. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Full bodied with lost of flavor and it leaves a long lasting malt flavor in your mouth, most prominently on the back of your tongue. Though the abv is high and the mouthfeel is full bodied you can really have a couple of these in a row without breaking a sweat. The only problem is that the coating of your mouth is so extensive you might not want taste another beer after this one. But after it who cares. Petti out."
"Note: one of the best, if not the best Imperial Stouts I've had. A discovery like this is what keeps me excited about beers."
"This beer, from the bottle, might even surpass my other two favorite stouts--Alameda's Black Bear XX Nitro and Rogue's Shakespeare--although I have a hard time shaking my affection for Oregon breweries. All around, though, this is a terrific offering."
"M/D- Too smooth for the ultimate in roundness... the sheer strength of this beer calls for some balance in the mouthfeel, but it simply fades into obscurity. Strong but watery, any inkling of carbonation is what's lacking. This beer is satisfying, yet I definitely prefer the bottled offering. Unless this growler went flat in one day, I suggest the widely available four-pack bottles."
"Overall- a decent Stout by, by no means, a great one! Too sweet and too syrupy. If this could be mellowed just a little!"
"Any beer named Old Rasputin is off to a good start in my book. Pours out a velvety black with a thick, brown, whipped cream head on it.Let's put this to the nose: smells a bit like Irish coffee, mmmm, Daddy like. First sip, alcohol, chocolate and malts roasted into cinders. Complex, rich, and very satisfying. Will enjoy the rest of my four-pack."
"More of a dessert beer, one you won't drink more than two of without a heavy stomach and serious swimmy head afterwards. A great winter indulgence, and one to drink on the barely-chilled side."
"Poured into a wide-mouth wine glass from a shorty bottle ... Almost black mahogony color with a great chocolate-colored head ... imperial looking indeed. Nose is of cocoa, roasted coffee, espresso, and sweet malt. Almost no hop aromas in the nose. Taste is completely consistent with the aroma ... rich, sweet, and complex with dark malt ... almost black strap mollases flavors ... yet smooth and nutty in the finish. Thick, heavy body with little carbonation. A huge stout in the imperial style ... an acquired taste, which I have certainly acquired. Very strong, very rich, and very good. A superlative example of the style ... and east to get to boot!"
"another pickup by my wife on her latest trip to Trader Joes. Massive head, poured too cold so i let it sit 5 minutes to settle. brilliant lacing. totally opaque black/brown color. Roasty alcohol chocolate odor. smells so good i want to shotgun the bloody thing. oh man. this tastes as close to my all time favorite (Thunderhead Brew co. Russian Imperial Stout) as i've gotten. Complex, roasted chocolate malt flavor. some bitterness. not quite the best but still a 5 for taste. almost perfect mouthfeel. a bit fizzy but i'll cellar a couple to see if i can get some of the bitterness and fizziness down. could drink these all night till i pass out."
"Jet black with a large tan colored tightly bubbled head. Thick sticky lacing. TREMENDOUS coffee smell. Lots of roasted malt. Heavy roasted malt and ample alcohol taste. Jet black coffee taste. Slight hop balance in the finish. An overall great impy stout. This is a beer you should pick up if you get a chance."
"beer is very drinkable, best for a cold night, goes well with water crackers and munster."
"Easily one of my top three beers of all time. Hands down the best Imperial Stout I have ever had."
"medium mouthfeel with a medium carbonation; mouthfeel is slightly light and carbonation slightly high for the style. slight chocolate sweetness, then a wave of piney bitterness. hoppy bitterness is quite a contrast from the aroma. the combination of flavors is just a bit amiss. solid stout, but i've come to expect more from anything labeled as ""imperial," such as a little more complexity or nuance."
"Note: This beer is great out of the bottle but was a huge treat when I had it for the first time on tap."
"Poured a dark , dark choclaty brown/black. Head was light brown, slow to build, but impressive once it did. Nice sticky lacing was left as it went down. Aroma is of much coffee/ espresso , chocolate , dark fruit and malt. Nice! Taste is of the same qualities , with espresso being the strongest throughout ; also a nice hop bitterness and warming finish of alchohol. Wow this is very complex .... and Good! My first Russian Imperial Stout , definatly NOT my last. I only wish the weather was colder at the moment , down here in FL."
"Though this review is based on a bottle I had this on tap at some point. It was awesome. Real thick and full. Mmmm."
"This is one complex stout. It has such incredible depth, balance and complexity that drinking it is a bit of an adventure and a pleasing one at that!"
"That grapefruit bitterness really bugs me and will hinder the drinkability for me, but otherwise this is a fine stout. I wouldn't have any problem putting one down from time to time."
"drinkability: the closest thing to a session IRS. although I wouldn't session thise one, a four pack has lasted me a month, mixed in with other things. It's a solid beer, but not the best."
"This is still certainly a very solid beer, but man it's tough for any Imperial Stout to stand up to Victory's Storm King..."
"A great treat indeed. I will be buying this again. I cannot wait to try it on tap."
"Awesome. Not as thick as some Imperial Stouts, and perhaps for that reason, very drinkable (at 9%!)."
"Drinkability: Overall an excellent beer, but since this at a strong 9% ABV this is definitely not an everyday beer and only good once in a great while. A 4-pack is more than enough for me."
"Poured four 12-ounce bottles of Old Rasputin over the course of a week to give me some time to properly judge the contents. Dark black charcoal in color with a rich frothy light mocha head, which was thicker than I had anticipated. Moderate lacing around the glass. There was a subtle smokiness in the aroma after pouring; however, the smell of dark roasted malts and coffee abound afterwards. As for taste, a little bitter at first, which mellowed with time. A very good beer to sink your teeth into, real chewy. Didn't get that warm alcohol feeling while drinking this one like you do with some others, so I would say that the alcohol is pretty well hidden until you finish the bottle. For overall drinkability though, I would think some people would stop with one or two. At 9%ABV, it will hit you. Good thing, it comes only in 4-packs in my area."
"Poured a large frothy light-medium brown mostly lasting head. Aroma was extremely sweet  I detected dark cherry, ripened banana and a slight hint of citrus. Initially a light sweet taste with lively carbonation followed by moderate bitterness. The roasted malts really came through late in the finish with dark chocolate the predominant flavor. I really enjoyed the different aromas of this offering."
"This beer poured out a thick dark black. It had creamy tan colored head. The smell is sweet and malty. Hints of the alcohol come through. The taste is roasted grain with a big alcohol finish. The alcohol is not as overpowering as others of the style. The mouthfeel is decent but due to the higher ABV it is somewhat diminished. I could drink these again. I would not want to slam these down but an occasional one would hit the spot."
"D: Highly recommended, a perfect balance of flavors, nothing is overdone. I really like the sweetness of the malt, it's brief, making you come back for more..."
"d - A keeper. Could drink a lot of these."
"This is probabably the most drinkable Imperial Stout I have ever encountered. This makes my top 10 list."
"Pours motor oil black, with a thick, creamy brown head, wonderful lacing, great retention. Looks like a rich espresso. Roasted malt, alcoholic aromas. Taste is something else. Smooth, rich, creamy, espresso flavours, molasses and a heavy roasted and almost burnt flavour. Finishes dry, bitter and satisfying. Lots of complexity, flavour but still extremely easy to drink. Great body and mouthfeel. One of the best imp stouts I've had."
"Dark dark brown with tan head, very dark and mysterious. Smells deliiicious with chocolate filling my nostrils begging me to sip! And sip I do, and it is, in fact, also, delicious. Chocolately and caramely and espresso-y. A bitter finish completes the taste cycle. Mouthfeel is bubbly and fluffy, very clean and smooth. Very drinkable, though too sweet after a while. And did I mention how sneaky this is? At almost 9 percent, it's definitely sneaky."
"Drinkability: A pretty good stout, one that I would buy again but probably not on a regular basis. I could probably drink a few of these in a night."
"This has instantly become one of my favorite beers. I was a little unsure, as I am somewhat partial to milk/sweet stouts. However, if this example is any indication of what to expect, imperial stouts may just take their rightful place on the throne."
" This is one of the Best Russian Stout's that I Ihave had the pleasure to run across, and you will not be disapointed ."
"Buy, beg, panhandle, or steal for this beer. Buy out the whole shelves. I want to give it fives across the board. Do I dare? Do I dare? I dare! Utterly one of the best beers I have ever, ever had in my life. A life-changing experience!"
"I'd love to have a six pack of this beer, but it's not something I'd sit and pound consecutively. It's heavy, of course, and doesn't slide down like some other imperial stouts. A bomber would be nice, but I'm afraid I couldn't drink a less strong beer in that same evening. A great beer; it would be a joy to purchase it again."
"This is my first beer from North Coast Brewing Company and I look forward to trying their other offerings."
"This is the first RIS that I have the pleasure to taste. And I liked it alot. The best aspect is the chocolate mid palate. Other than that, the earthiness and undistinct nose offers no delite that an IPA might offer. But, if you have surpassed the blah-say of so many crafted brews, this will open your eyes."
"Purchased as a 4-pack for $8.00, a good deal. There are so many good stouts out there, I feel that this category is going to become a much more scrutinized category."
"Slàinte!"
"Very easy to drink."
"The flavor is deep and robust with dark bittersweet chocolate and some roasted malt. There is a bit of coffee and some dark fruit poking around in back as well. The coffee takes over on the finish and lingers very smooth and easy to drink. The alcohol is well hidden in this treat. Watch out if you have a few!"
"Pours a very dark plum; clear with burgundy highlights. The light brown head is dense and creamy, rising to nearly three fingers and retaining well. The lacing will coat the glass. Dark fruits in the nose like raisins and dates. Strong bakers chocolate aroma and some fusel vapors as it warms to room temp. A hint of coffee to top off the complex aroma; but not much in the way of hops or roasted notes. The roasted barley becomes very evident in the initial taste, with a slight black patent twang. Unsweetened chocolate and faint spicy hop aftertaste mellow out the strong sweet flavor. Dark fruity alcohol is apperent in the finish, but there is enough residual sweet to hide the fusels and retain a silky mouthfeel. The thick body and low carbonation highlight an excellent balance of bold flavor and smooth mouthfeel of this nearly perfect Russian Imperial stout."
"Poured into a tulip glass, pours a thick dark black with decent head that shrinks quickly to a thin film, and has remarkably thick brown sugar color lacing. Quite lovely. Aroma is beautiful. I don't usually find aromas that wonderful, but this is quite remarkable. Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, licorice and alocohol, perhaps a trace of brown sugar. Taste is just as great, with a complex mixture of the same hints from aroma, a potent blast of roasted malts and espresso-like aftertaste, finishes moderately thick, smooth and creamy. MF is really good, I actually get different feels from it down the glass, and the body is great. What a fantastic beer, a classic in my book."
"In the glass it is black as night with a nice sized head that falls back to next to nothing. Some chocolate in the flavor with mild malts, coffee. Not too much in the smell department. The taste is the upside of this beer. Bitter malt, coffee, espresso. Followed by the alcohol and soft hops. A very full bodied mouthfeel. I can sit down and enjoy a couple of these."
"Great winter-time beer that has been lapped by others in in hoppiness and abv, but not drinkability IMHO"
"The struggle is exhausting yet you can't help but thinking that you'll choose to cross paths again."
"Hands down, one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts I've ever had. This is one of my favorite styles of beer and this is up there with the best."
"12 oz. cool little labeled bottle. pours a dark black with just a hint of ruby red with a light tan head. smell is chocolate more over coffee. taste is nice. the chocolate and coffee balance each other out so one or the other doesn't dominate the taste. feels very nice and mellow in the mouth. a very nice brew. i'm not much of a stout drinker but this is by far my favorite stout."
"One of my favorite R.I.S's but the price makes it a little hard to justify when I can get a 6 pack of Storm King for the same price as 4 Old Rasputin. Try it, learn to love it."
"Almost pure black in color with just the slightest ruby notes around the edge. Very fine bubble tan head that drops to a thin film. Smell and taste of burnt chocolate with a plum note. Also some alchohol on the nose. The burnt chocolate gives it an almost smokey note. Smooth mouthfeel with a nice bitter aftertaste. A nice winter brew that will warm you up on the coldest night."
"An excellent beer, although it would be hard to drink a lot of these in a row."
"Great beer from a great company. Pranqster is also good."
"Sooo smooth. There is a sweetness up front followed by a chocolatey coffee flavor and a nice hoppiness to balance it out. There is a alcohol warming but is shown up by the sweetness in this beer. All of these flavors really compliment each other really well and better than alot of other Russian Imperial stouts I've tried. This is without a doubt an exceptional beer."
"First whiff was of chocolate coffee and alcohol. This was definitely a thinking man's beer, not one meant for chugging. I had it after a few erdinger's and it brought a welcome change to my palate. This beer is a bit too strong for me, I like my stouts a little smoother like rogue's shakespeare. Rasputin had a bit of a gamey taste to it, like uncooked rabbit and veal. It was a pleasure to drink this beer on tap, i like watching the bartender do the double pour. Bartender also told me this beer goes well as a half and half or black and tan mixer. I don't know about that, the complexity of this beer is unmatched, and i wouldn't want to sully it with Harp's or Bass."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is definitely pronounced in this 9% abv stout. It provides a warming sensation through one's throat and down into the belly. Very pleasant texture, and inviting enough for me to have a couple more."
"Pours a pitch black color topped by a creamy brown head that clings nicely to the glass. Rich aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, a touch of bitter hops, and a bit of a vinous character. Palate is deeply complex and somewhat earthy. Truly, it tastes as black as it looks: a huge malty backbone is met towards the finish with a good complement of bittering hops for a touch of balance. Notes of milk chocolate, oak, espresso, and a touch of molasses. Body is rich, velvety, and creamy, with very little of the oiliness that seems to permeate many Russian stouts. The alcohol packs a punch, for sure, but this is most certainly a beer to be savored (preferably with a Five Star chocolate-hazelnut bar). Once you start, you're in for the long haul. Enjoy."
"Pours out a rich black with ruby hues with a thin tan head that slowly dissipated to a thin layer of bubbles. Aromas are of roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, toasty malts, slight smoke, and marashino cherries. Taste is of sweet, dark chocolate chased with some strong, black coffee. There is some toasted malt in there as well as cherry candy and dried fruits. Finishes a bit smoky with pleasent astringent bitterness and a bit of a lactic acid twang. I detect a bit of citrus and pine in the hops very faintly, although these hops come out more in the burps. This beer really needs to sit a while before the mouthfeel is anywhere near decent. When its freshly poured and a bit too cool, it's thin and prickly, but just letting it sit a while and come closer to room temp., it becomes a bit fuller and mellows out a bit. Still, it could be better. Really drinkable RIS that has tons of flavor and a decent mouthfeel, once it warms up."
"Overall: Razzy was drugged, poisoned, beaten and shot, but only died after being wrapped in a carpet and thrown in the river. He grew from a womanizing peasant thief to a holy man helping the czars family with both the needs of a hemophilic son and the decisions for war with Austria. This is a beer that weirdly does it's namesake proud."
"Notes: A pretty sweet looking beer at first pour, definitly let it warm up and then linger in your mouth to obsorb the full flavour."
"Almost stark black with a fine sticky tan head. Looks very impressive...just like I expect beer to. Smells a little too sweet and hoppy for what an imperial stout should be. I like them meatier and full of roasted flavors. This is an interesting taste. As far as matching what I expect it is not. It is sweeter...almost milky. Very tasty, but lacks a lot of the rich roasted complexities I enjoy. It tastes like hops might overshadow the malts too much. It is a very full bodied beer. Almost a cake like texture to it. Alcohol just lightly warms the stomach and mouth. Excellent mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable beer. I would feel good sharing it with just about anyone."
"The beer pours a rich mahogony with a dark tan head. It has a full bodied aroma that is a wonderful mix of dark malt and fruits. The taste is a bold malt with a bit of bitter roastieness then has an alcohol burn for a finish. Not quite as sweet as I like my RIS, but a nice change of pace. The feel is appropriately heavy and quite smooth, even creamy. I will definately be back for more. I had a serious thirst for a RIS this summer and the store I went to only had this in stock. I have now enjoyed the first 3 from the 4pack and I think I'll set the other one down for a while. I'd like to see if the cherry aroma will show in the taste as it ages."
"Mouthfeel is a little thinner than most stouts, but I find this to be typical of Russian Imperials. Drinkability is good. The alcohol feeling on the stomach limits this."
"D: Maybe even a little below average."
"D - The drinkability of this beer increases with each sip. It gets smoother and better as it goes. I hate having the same beer one after another, but I could sure see it happening with this."
"D - A great one to sip and savor. The sweetness makes you want to sip this one really slowly and relax."
"I was drinking another Rasputin tonight and wanted to re-review. Actually, my review would still be 4.5 across the board. This is an excellent beer....not the best...I still like Stone more...but an excellent, EXCELLENT beer available every day of the week, at a reasonable price.. I'm changing drinkability because I'm pretty sure I could keep my clothes on and definately can drink more than one of these a night."
"Drinkability is good but is a little hindered by the strong alcohol taste and smell."
"Cheers!"
"cheers..."
"D- This is a nice big stoic beer that has lots of dark roasted layers. There is a nice creamy quality that makes it drink like a meal."
"--Joey"
"Very good RIStout. Great dessert beer, I enjoyed it with a slice of pumpkin pie and vanilla ice cream."
"Pours a very dark brown almost black. Tan head,nice lacing. Smell is of roasted coffee,and carmel. Mouthfeel is fairly thick,and rich. Taste is bittersweet, and smooth with a great finish. I was drinking the beer on a cold,snowy November night,and it sure warmed me up!"
"Seek this one out on tap. My apologies for the haphazardly written review. I was pretty inebriated at the time."
"Taste; Chocolate, coffee, a touch of vanilla, a little bitter at first from the roasted malts, but that smooths out alot as it warms up. Nice thick, rich and creamy mouthfeel. This is a really good stout, just wish I could go back and get some more."
"Big sipping beer. A little smaller than some Imp. Stouts but it's a classic take on the style."
" -cheers2beers-"
"This is one of the best beers I've had in a long time.BUY IT!!!"
"Drinkability is excellent. I bought the 4 pack and I'm ready to finish the first and start on the second. If you like stouts then you will like this brew."
"It was also not as biting in the mouthfeel as some other Imperials. It finished actually refreshing and as tasty as the first taste."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is fantastically thick and oily a pleasing full bodied beer. This will go down great when the deep freeze of winter is on."
"If Victor Kiam had still been around today and drunk this beer he would have forgotten all about his Remmington Microscreen and bought this company instead. Believe you me."
"suprised me with how much i liked it. will try again some evening infront of a fire."
"Cited as one of the best Russian imperial stouts.I definitely agree this beer is ""up there", though it's not outstanding IMO."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer. It is a bit milder than some of the American micro-brews version. It has a lot nuttier flavor and a whole lot more depth of malt character than most. The flavor is multilayered, so if you pay attention, you can taste at least three different beers in just this one."
"Drinkability is good. The smokiness would limit my ability to have more than a couple, but it will find a new regular place in my beer fridge rotation."
"Very drinkable for an RIS.... absolutely lovely brew, although I seem to remember it being slightly better out of the bottle."
"12 oz bottle, not dated, poured into a snifter. Pours an extremely deep brown, practically pitch black, absolutely opaque even when held up to the light. Retention is decent, as is lacing. Smell is somewhat subdued, but is a nice mix of baking chocolate, ameretto, and coffee. Taste is excellent, a very nice roasted expresso, rich bittersweet chocolate, a roasted malt base, and a finish with a slight taste of alcohol. Very rich and luscious. Thick chewy mouthfeel, leaving a dry, lingering finish. This is a suberb stout, the best tasting Imperial I've had, a really great beer I'm glad I got my hands on."
"Drinkability: The high alcohol content and richness of this beer make it something that demands to be drank slowly and deliberately, but the flavor is so enchanting that it wouldn't be hard to knock back more than a few of these between dinner and bedtime."
"Poured into a pint glass with a nice creamy tan head that stays the entire session. The color is opaque and nontransparent. The aroma is of roasted coffee beans and dark chocolate. The taste is as good or better than any RIS I have had to date (I do have 2 Stone RIS's in the fridge waiting to be unleashed). The roasted coffee and dark chocolate shine through as there is a touch of milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick and full. The drinkability is great for two and then your to full to drink another."
"Coffee and chocolate tastes dualing, with coffee getting the slight advantage. A little dry. Some roasted malt and nut flavors popping up here and there. The head's bubbles are precise and poppable, rather than creamy. There is a nice lingering aftertaste, but the flavors don't over stay their welcome. Despite its alcohol content and robust character, Old Rasputin doesn't fatigue the taste buds. You can have a few and enjoy each one more than the last...just remember that 8.9% will catch up on you quick. Old Rasputin is still a mystical favorite."
"There is a downside to this. The flavor is perhaps a bit too strong, and it is hard to drink this at anything faster than a snails pace. More than one (*maybe* two) of these is a bit too much for my palate to handle."
"What a beautiful beer! This Imperial Stout pours a beautiful black with a thin caramel head. The aromas are of chocolate and coffee. The flavors are surprisingly smooth for a beer of this ABV. It has a full mouthfeel with a long, dry finish of burnt toast. The hops are perfectly balanced with the dark roasted malts. BALANCE is the key! Take my advice though, dont have this with a sweet cookie for dessert ... match it with a piece for dark bitter chocolate. Excellent!"
"Pours out an oily black appearance with a light coating of tan foam across the top. Nose is filled with ripe, sweet fruity aroma and rich, velvety maltiness. First taste is slightly roasted malt with creamy cocoa and toffeeish notes. Lots of bitterness, but there's a lot of malt to pit it against. Dries out a bit at the end, with a modest acidity. Full-bodied, warming with a creamy, soft texture."
"Pours black with a rocky brown head. Smells strongly of dark chocolate underlined with liquorices root. A few alcoholic whiffs but that is expected for a beer thats 9 percent. While there is a hint of alcohol in the bouquet the palate is incredibly dry for a stout this strong; dominate flavors: coca, French-press dark roast coffee and sherry whit hints of oak and port. Viscous and chewy, this Siberian coats the mouth but is not too oily."
"This is one of my anytime beers. Always available, always enjoyable. For just under seven bucks, a four pack can spend a few days in my fridge. The 12oz size is nice, too. I don't think I've ever seen another RIS in this size, for this price. I can totally see the czars of old Russia lounging around, drinking this tasty brew out of huge goblets while serving girls spoon caviar into their mouths."
"Old Rasputin - does anybody remember the movie HBO did about the now dead Russian legend starring the bad guy from the original Die Hard movie? - poured with a finger of thick, off white head that retained mediocrely well and left some lacing down the side of the glass. The beer is the thick blackness of the empty theatres I had left behind at work: hiding and betraying no secrets, forever comlex. The aroma was thick was and heavy on roasted malts with a little alcohol peaking through. I took a sip, a big sip to be honest, of the syrupy, full bodied brew and allowed it to wash over my tongue. The flavor seemed to attack and hold my senses at bay: strong coffee flavors, with well roasted malts, and a alcohol finish. Old Rasputin and I sat around the family room and finished the evening in style. After finishing the beer, fully enjoyed, I wanted nothing less than another of the same exact beer and scolded myself for not purchasing more than a single bottle of this brew. I will be returning to this one as the seasons change and the temperature drops. A real treat, and dangerously drinkable as far as this style and this ABV goes."
"No freshness date. Litle yellow head and a black beer. Nose is very roasty, hoppy, chocolate and black prunes fruity. Nice carramellic sweet hint with it complete the great nose. Taste is strong, heavy, litle sweet, caramellic and IMO litle overdone on the roastmalt part.Makes it also overbittered in to many I guess but for me just fine. Edgy mouthfeel but well drinkable."
"This is the old standby Russian Imperial, $8.49 for a 4-pack, which is not bad for the style. Fresh it's a raw roast and hop monster, but aged I imagine the vanilla and other subtleties would come through more and create a smooth sea of complexities. Either way, excellent."
"This is an awesome beer. It has a very distinct taste thats good for sipping. However, the lasting roasted finish keeps me from wanting to immediately crack open another one."
"Thanks to the beer alcohol limit being raised in NC Old Rasputin is no available at Whole Foods, purchased a bottle for $2.50. Poured a midnight black color with a huge head. Rasberry and chocolate smell. Smooth taste was a big surprise, hints of chocolate and coffee flavor, a great heavy mouthfeel, alcohol aftertaste is noticable. Long lasting head with lacing. This is good stuff, I can't wait to share with my father next time he is in town."
"I first had this beer about 7 or 8 years ago and it was just my second Imperial stout after Sam Smith's Imperial that I'd ever had the chance to try. Now that I can buy this beer in NC, the anticipation of cracking this one open is exhilerating. The beer pours black, nearly opaque, with a 1 inch light brown head. I can detect a whiff of coffee, dark malt and hops. The initial taste is of chocolate,coffee, plums, dark fruit and hops. As the beer warms, the alcohol taste comes out more, but does not take anything away from the drinkability of this beer. I could easily drink several of these in one night. This beer is just as good as I remember it. Excellent."
"This is a lovely slow-sipping beer. I sipped it while Traffic's ""John Barleycorn"" was playing on the deck of the Sawmill Taproom."
"Notes: one of the best of its kind"
"Pours a very dark brown, though not opaque and lightens up a bit around the endges. Head is thin tan and isn't leaving a lot of lacing for me. Aroma is pretty nice, some dark espresso roastiness and bitter chocolate, with a slight touch of hops. Taste is fantastic. Very roasty, fairly dry (for an impy). Starts of full of roastiness, espresso and bitter chocolate, some slight fruit midway, then the hops emerge through the finish coupled with a slight alcoholic spicyness. It doesn't suffer from being too sweet like some impy's i've had do. It's very nice. Perhaps that's why the body is a bit thinner than expected, but that's a tradeoff I can make. A very very good stout. Alcohol is noticeable in the finish, but not a problem"
"Mouthfeel was ok, the aftertaste bitter. Not drinkable at all, IMO. I won't be reaching for Rasputin's face any time soon. Disappointing, as this is always considered a classic beer by most. It's definitelty too over the top for my tastes."
"There is some sweetness to found here, as well as some bittersweet chocolate and roasty/toasty elements. This full, rich beer is complemented by a very good mouthfeel. The nearly 9% ABV is expertly concealed by serious depth of flavor. Old Rasputin is a great brew at a great price. I will pay this one a visit again soon."
"Pours a nice toffee brown/ black with a bit of seriously brown head. The smell is a bit of a surprise- almost floral in addition to the usual caramel/ roast/ soy stuff. The taste is heavy on the acrid/ roasty/ burnt side with a hint of chocolate and italian roast coffee- flirts with being too much, but never really goes too far. Mouthfeel really stands out in this one- less body than some other impy stouts that lean towards the thick syrupy side- but that's perfect in this beer; nice to have one that doesn't feel immensley sticky. Alcohol's nicely balanced, too. The intense roastiness limits the drinkability somewhat, but I could certainly have at least one more..."
"This is really the best imperial stout value around. Available in six packs for a reasonable price, this beer constantly amazes me with its complexity and bigness. The real treat is the sinful chocolate notes packed with hops and burnt malt. Cellar age only increases the smoothness of all the flavours. A real contender for my favourite beer."
"For a strong brew this one goes down pretty nice considering that it has an almost liquor like feel to it. Stouts are not my favorite but are definately moving up because of brews like this one. A coupel of these will do you in good, thank God they only come in a 4 pack."
"and I have no fear of getting cold."
"Pours an opaque black with a nice tan head, very imposing looking. Aroma is expresso, coffee, chocolate, blackstrap molasses, citrusy and floral hops. Flavor is very complex and imposing; big coffee and chocolate flavors upfront followed by a blackstrap molasses sweetness that is balanced by a floral and citrus hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is huge with a big body and moderate carbonation and a bitter, slightly astringent finish. Alcohol notes are present, but balanced and drinkability is near the top for an imperial stout."
"My first Russian Imperal Stout. Poured out to a black coffee color with a nice, full brown foamy head that was well lived. Notes of lace were all about inside the glass. Aromas similar to whisky were first noted, as were indications of chocolate and coffee. Flavor was full and rich, with notes of molassas, cocoa and coffee, with some smokey elements to it as well. The big drawback for me with this beer was the alcohol. Way too present, as it almost overpowered the other flavors. Very hard to ignore. Full and thick mouthfeel was similar to what I would imagine having motor oil in your mouth being like. I guess i'd have another, but certainly not right after having one. Worth a try."
"Additional comments - I think this beer is well-balanced because no one ingredient is over-powering, but that also causes it to not be distinct and memorable."
"drinkability: good thing this stuff is available everywhere so there is no hope of running out"
"I really, really, really like this beer. I shot it, stabbed it, poisoned it, and drowned it, and it just won't go away; its flavor lingers on my tongue like a passionate kiss. The Mad Monk is a deep and evil black that's basically headless--something the Romanovs probably should have considered. It smells like roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. Taste is deliciously bitter, like coffee grounds, with some chocolate and toastedness. The kind of big beer I like, lacking in the grossly sweet prune/raisin character that I dislike. Nice full mouthfeel. This is my second one, and I'm pretty sure a third would render me incapable of operating the grill, so I'm stopping here."
"Overall, a nice imperial. It's a little unbalanced in the flavor with alcohol and bitterness - all the elements don't come together well and play nicely. It's good, but I've had better."
"Poured a dark brown color with a medium sized light tan head. This was not opaque and significantly lighter than the Sammy Smiths IS I just had. It did, however, leave nice lacing on the glass. It had a fruity aroma of chocolate, hints of caramel and whiskey. It had a taste of chocolate and malt, alcohol and a bitter chocolate and coffee aftertaste with some whiskey as well, some carbonation was noted. It had a full finish that coated the mouth."
"I love RIS's so my review might be biased, but I'll do my best to go by the guide lines. The appreance of this is black with a tan head, large frothy head and laces as I drink it. There is aromas of cherries, chocolate, molasses, bubble gum, wine and nail polish. The taste is of roasted nuts, oak, chocolate mocha and the bitterness of hops with whipped cream. The mouthfeel is light and smooth but warms up at the end because of the alcohol. Drinkability of this in comparison to other RIS's is that it's not the best, but it's still very tasty."
"Also, be warned, this beer is a heavy hitter. After a few bottles, you won't be contributing much to the conversation around you."
"Old Rasuptin Imperial Stout is quite an interesting brew. It pours a chocolaty black color with a thin, purplish-tan head. It is deep, dark and mysterious--perhaps much like the ellusive Rasputin himself. I love the smell of this beer. It mixes roasted coffee aromas, with the sweeter remnants of chocolate, caramel and toffee. Sweetness epitomized! There is also a nice, bold noticeable tinge of hops to the overall inhalation. It tastes like carmalized coffee with malt and a slight hops kick at the end of each swallow. Alcohol is noticeable, but barely. In the mouth, this beer is amazingly bold and full. It holds well, with low carbonation. There is also a nice biting aftertaste, allowing its overall substance to be reckoned with. On the whole this well documented Russian Imperial Stout does not disappoint. Not normally my favorite style, but this one is a keeper. It is a candied/coffied delight for the palate. Surprisingly easy to enjoy despite its nine percent abv."
"Alcohol was noticeable but not overwhelming."
"Warming."
"So, Papa Grigori, we meet at last. A seductive deep roast flavor rises from that first sip. I detect a not unexpected raisiny note to you, and then something that whispers in my ear, ""cherries."" For something in such a tiny bottle, your taste is big and strong, deep and dark, deep and dark. Am I aware of your stoutish bitterness, that cuts through the smoothness of your malts? Yes, I am, Papa Perhaps it is from the time the Romanov partisans tried to drown you in the Neva."
"The drinkablility is excellent for the 8.9 abv. and especially for a R.I. Stout."
"Overall drinkability is low only because of the aforementioned astringent quality to the taste as the beer warms, and the high alcohol. I drank this one over the course of about an hour and a half, and while I enjoyed it quite a bit, I don't think I could have easily drunk two. Very nice, highly enjoyable, but not a session beer at all."
"Drinkability is good definitely worth trying, but it wouldn't replace my favorites I try to keep on hand for the winter."
"Very well attenuated and controlled yeast character made this beer a Godfather of Stouts and continues to outlast newer Stouts with its restraint and boldness. Always a pleasure to see this beer in my glass."
"Drinkability - Would pair well with many foods, but the bitterness starts to accumulate making a full 12 oz a tad difficult to finish (although still very nice)."
"I haven't had this beer in five years. Last time it was almost too much, and it still is, but in an enjoyable way-- just like five years ago. It bludgeons you with roasted malts."
"The smell is rich, taste also rich. High is chocolate and coffee and is hard to describe except it does look like liquid charcoal with terrific head retention and traces all the way down the glass. Huge alcohol, undetectable and comes on late. The only drawback is, and I don't like this at all, is it comes in 4 packs, which is the only reason I never buy Sam Smith's beer, although it is excellent as well."
"overall: this is an excellent russian imperial stout, and probably my favorite right now. i'll need to explore this beer again when my palate is more developed. i may be able to rate it even higher."
"Pours black with a nice 3/4"" tan frothy head which has decent retention and minimal lacing. Smell is quite fruity actually, berries or cherries with an alcoholic bite. Very rich smelling bouquet. Taste follows suit and is quite fruity, in a deep roasted kind of way, with some sweet maltiness, some hop bitterness, and alcohol at the end. You can tell this is 9%, but it's not to the point of being hard to drink by any means. I could easily put back another, but would definitely start to feel it by then. Mouthfeel is nice for an RIS, smooth and creamy, yet refreshing. A very rich smelling and tasting imperial stout here, much fruitier than I was expecting, but a pleasant surprise. My favorite RIS to date."
"Totally black with clear, ruby highlights topped by a lace of medium brown head. Looks nice all the way down due to moderate lacing and good head retention for what's there. Vinous alcohol aroma, lots of roast coffee, dark chocolate and overall maltiness with a moderate hoppiness. The flavour starts malty sweet, bitterness appears at the mid-point along with chocolate and alcohol warmth. The finish is very roasted and dry, with bitterness contributed by the dark malts. Creamy, viscous texture, full bodied. The alcohol flavour melds well with the malt character, leaving you with a very drinkable stout."
"Pours a super opaque black, little bit of red on the edges, creamy dark brown head and lots of lace. Smells like dark roasted malt, hops, coffee and chocolate. Taste is sublime, lots of roasted coffee, hops, dark chocolate finish. Very thick and full, perfect mouthfeel and carbonation, amazing beer. Reminded me of Rogue Imperial Stout a lot but smoother. Thanks for the taste DrJay."
"Taste is just amazing. It's rich with lightly roasty malt flavors. Bittersweet chocolate. Some roasted coffee bean in the finish that becomes more pronounced as it warms. It's lightly sticky in the mouth and very full bodied. a lingering coffee bitterness. The balance of sweetness and bitterness is just fantastic. I love it. An old favorite I can't believe I hadn't reviewed yet."
"An automatic choice when you can find it on tap, but very filling. The 20 oz pint glass was perfect to enjoy this one, but having another was out of the question."
"Old Rasputin has a wonderful, thick, brown head and a rich, deep, black color. It has a strong, thick and creamy malt flavor that is both sweet and bitter, with a mild roasted/burnt aftertaste and a roasty aroma. This imperial stout has a full-bodied consistency with an alcoholic warmth that will bring a smile to your face and a nice warm glow to your cheeks on a cold winter night. It finishes with a big hop bitterness that lingers. Brussels lace stays on the sides of the glass right to the bottom. Old Rasputin is an excellent example of the imperial stout style."
"Beautiful brown that glistens with supple red highlights, but alas, the head is nonexistent. There is a scent of tart berries (blueberries and cranberries, I believe) and quite an array of hops on the nose. The alcohol is strong, but under it lies a serious chocolate scent with a twinge of licorice. The taste is LOADED with alcohol. Too much for my little tastebuds. The sweetness is still there under all of that alcohol and hops. But still. It's definitely not terribly offensive. Just....it tastes best at nearly room temp where the alcohol is more subdued."
"Pours a solid opaque black color, with a nice dark tan head. Good lacing through out the pint. Smells of caramel, chocolate, cream, and alcohol. The taste is of chocolate and roasted malt. The alcohol warms the throat as it passes into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied and dry. Overall, this is a very nice brew."
"I think these are meant to be had one at a time. So, I came back 2 days later for my second."
" Absolutely Outstanding!!!"
"just enjoying the last of my bottles. a sad day, but one i knew was coming eventually. i am enjoying reviewing my review almost as much as drinking the fabulous brew. the only adjustment to my previous score is to up the taste from 4.5 to 5.0. cheers to north coast for producing this fine ale, and please do continue. i will have to seek this out next time i am in the states."
"And pay attention, Mr. 9% will sneak up and kick ya in the sack."
"Drinkability could be higher, but at almost 9%, this is a delicious and highly drinkable beer. I wish I had it readily available here. Thanks again, axisjones (I was secretly hoping from the start that I'd recieve my BIF package from CA)."
"12 oz bottle picked up during travels sometime in 2004, cellared for about a year, and consumed in June 2005. Pours a half-finger brown head over a nearly clear dark brown/ruby red liquid. Smells or alcohol, cofee, chocolate and licorice. Not in my face alcohol, it's a gentle stingy alcohol that supports the other scents. Tastes thick dark sweet. Chocolate is strong and over the nice rich roasty. Like a chocolate coffee desert. The potent chocolate is almost like a syrupy chocolate, like you would pour over vanilla ice cream, but it's not a cheap chocolate. It's a really rich chocolate, like you would get from a reputable foreign producer The alcohol plays with it nicely to make a rummy taste that has raisin and plum characteristics. In later sips, as the beer warmed, a strong toffee made itself evident. The creamy thick mouthfeel really adds to the character of this beer. Carbonation is mild, but forms an interesting acrid sting that negotiates with the rich sweet and reinforces the tinge of alcohol burn."
"Very malty and thick in your mouth with great chocolate and coffee undertones. It's just so mellow and well balanced that you really can't find anything to complain about. Also, while hovering in the high alcohol region it makes you feel great after a single bottle. Love this beer. Not for the faint of pallet."
"note: Old Rasputin goes exceptionally well with the chocolate almond pistaccio biscotti's we had for desert."
"I would enjoy a couple of these, but since I am a true hophead at heart, I would not pick this for a session brew."
"Taste is classic stout. Delicious roasted malt coupled with bitter expresso/chocolate. Hops are warm up front, but then the brew tapers into an almost sweet finish. Bitter chocolate rides out until the end. The taste lingers after the drink. Nice. This brew is medium bodied, creamy, and very much at home on the palate. A must try for all stout lovers. Cheers."
"Drinkability: I wish I had gotten a growler of this when I had the chance, cause that would go down no problem."
"Overall utterly complex and a multi-layered tower of flavors. Strong but not heavy-handed. Bold but not brash. Big but graceful. I'm positive I'll detect many more flavors and nuances the next time a try this fine stout. Oh well, I'll endeavor to persivere."
"A real nice imperial stout, not Sam Smith's (my fave), but an interesting change of pace."
"North Coast continues to impress me with their solid representations of almost all the styles they do. For me they're up there with Rogue, Victory, DFH, Great Lakes, and Stone. I just wish they'd add some more style / variety to their line-up, so hopefully the coming years will provide that."
"somewhat ominous-appearing bottle. Poured a deep black almost opaque color. The head is puffy cream color and long-lasting. The first smell is a bit alcoholic for my pleasure, as is the first taste. However, as the beer warms the smell and taste become more to my liking. A good solid beer, but not the best"
"I think this beer gets by on reputation alone. It is as mild of the road Imperial Stout I have had. It has the oil color and profile one would think with very little tan-cream head. There are some hop notes in the nose but it is nothing but burnt wood shavings with out the smoke after that. It is just a roasted heavy body, mostly from the alcohol, stout that can't be called creamy, it is very acidic. It lacks the smoothness of a better stout and the fruitness that can hide in the beers is also not present. I am not impressed, but by the end I almost enjoy chewing on burnt wood, but then again maybe not."
"Old Rasputin is not as dark as many other Imperial stouts, with luminous dark mahogany highlights beneath its creamy yellowed-tan head. And it's head retention leaves a bit to be desired as well. It does leave some thin lace, however, which is nice. And what it lacks in appearance it makes up for in aroma. It's slightly vinous with some yeasty fruitiness coming through the maltiness, followed by a touch of dark chocolate, espresso, and a waft of hops. It's quite slick, and a touch creamy, across the palate with a full body and a restrained, natural carbonation. The yeasty fruitiness carries through into the flavor with notes of prunes, plums, and berries; all backed by a massive assult of malt that offers espresso, burnt black coffee, dark caramel, and the suggestion of molasses as well as a pinch of brown sugar. It finishes with some resinous hops and a drip of black licorice before fading into a long, very dry finish. Quite nice!"
"The flavour was grand. Nice chocolate syrup and cream flavours along with the coffee and bitter impressions make this a great tasting imp. There is a very pleasant roasted appeal to the taste. This coupled with the hop character make for a truly excellent taste amplifier for the choco-coffee expressions. Very nicely juggled components indeed. This stuff is really quite good. Warmth and sting are provided by the alcohol which meshes perfectly to the flavour framework. Utterly consumable. Very nice. Certainly not hard to kill, so the name is somewhat misleading : )"
"Ebony-colored liquid, nicely sheened, fills the glass and raises a noisy tan head, about 1"" deep, to the rim. Bubbles of various size crackle away and leave handsome pock marks in the head as it works its way down the glass, leaving a somewhat soapy cling. The aroma kicks off with big sniffs of cocoa and prunes that get pulled by a tarry woodiness into a bitterness of coffee-and-lemon. Here's an American-made Imperial Stout that recognizes that when it comes to hops, modesty can be a virtue. Baking-soda nosefeel is powdery and dry. Over a base of mellowly toasted cedar can be detected light--not burnt--fruit flavors of orange peel and melon rinds dipped in dark chocolate. Black coffee takes over, with black peppercorns rounding out the finish. The tastes distribute widely and fluidly through a dryish, clean, and softly carbonated mouthfeel that carries the bitterness all the way to the back of the throat. At no point could I detect the 9% alcohol level, except for my light daze at the end of the serving. Now this here is good beer."
"delicately balanced, a true achievement."
"A very pleasant imperial stout. Pours nice and dark into the glass, with a very nice tan and foamy head. The head retention was brief. But a bit of swirling easily recreates the head for enjoyment, with each raising. Smell is a wonderful mixture of malt sweetness, bitter hops, and alcohol. The taste is much more than pleasant. However, at very limited points the alcohol content is unmasked, something my palate prefers not to notice-but this does not detract from the wonders of this fine beverage. A enjoyable mouthfeel...a thick enough beverage. exceptional drinkability! Certainly worth seeking out and sampling. Enjoy!"
"Pours a smooth dark black color with a creamy head. Smells of toasted malt, hoppy bite, and alcohol. Tastes of bitter hops, alcohol, warmth, chewy, malty, and thick. Finishes with taste of alcohol and hoppy flavor. The alcohol hits quickly and stays a long time. Excellent beer."
"This is an easy drinking RIS, too. Easily one of the best you're going to find."
"Absolutely worth a drink if you like stouts."
"Pours a deep, dark brown--nearly black. Capped by a dense, creamy, cocoa brown head that laces the glass nicely. Beautiful. Aromas explode out of the tulip glass. Roaseted coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, and dark sugary fruit mix seamlessly with an assertive pine-accented hop component. A wonderful smelling beer! Rich, roasted malt flavors up front meld with some sweetish, overripe dark fuits. Light chocolate coffee notes pick up right before a big rush of bitter hops. Cascadey and delcious, they provide nice balance. Finish is hop bitter, with vinous notes, tannins, and some warming alcohol. An excellent, full-bodied stout, that's right up there with the best of them."
"Tastes of burnt coffee and black malt, with a pleasant bitterness and a dry finish. More carbonation than I expected, but it goes well with the flavor. The high alcohol content is not as evident as it was in the nose; I could not even discern the slightest alcohol flavor. Drinkability is understandably low - but really, one of these bad boys is all you need. A wonderfully complex and tasty stout. I will have to check out more beers from North Coast, as this was my first."
"During Rasputin's fateful last evening, the conspirators drugged, poisoned, beat and shot him. Yet the staretz survived all these and actually died by drowning when his body, wrapped in a carpet was thrown into the Moika Canal on the Neva River. As you wrap your self in its 8.9 abv rug of thick run of coffee, chocolate, dark-roasted malts and hop weave and throw yourself into its dark velvet fluid, enjoy your ultimate plunge into darkness and sinful bliss as you overthrow all other Russian imperials."
"It's so carmelly and fruity and malty.... Rich, sweet raspberry, milk chocolate ganache gives way to toasted malts all dark and smokey. The alcohol twists this all up into a robust bitterness with a metallic edge. A kind beer spliff."
"A fine (very American) stout, but I could wish for some more body."
"Really pleasant brew this rasputin. truly a masterpiece in a bottle, just missing some of that harshness and burned flavour (this is after all an imperial). Thats just being a pain in the ass though, wonderful brew, wonderful stout."
"The time warp was a wonderful excursion. Old Rasputin exceeds itself. The nose softens, the taste broadens and the sharp and/or high tones balance. All became bigger yet softened. What was initially a hoppy finish with a high squeal followed by a dry note with a metal element transformed. I found Rasputin to be balanced from nose to finish. The appropriate temp made for a most boastful review. This was a good brew."
"Light absorbing black color with a thin tan head. The head leaves an intricate lace pattern down the side of the glass. The aromas of roasted malt waft up from the glass. I catch hints of the malt from a good 2 ft away. It has espresso, and black cherry notes throughout the aroma. The flavor has a plesant hop bite up front. The malt kicks in immediately after. Coffee, chocolate. I dont catch the black cherry in the flavor. The level of bitterness and the alcohol give this an almost spicy character. Very bright, smooth mouth feel. A little too much alcohol to give it a high drinakbility, None the less a great beer."
"Was able to give this brew a try the other evening, my first experience with Old Rasputin. It pored to a pitch-black color allowing no light to filter through. Had a frothy dark tan head that was slow to break down leaving a nice amount of lacing through the first half of the brew. The aromas are of dark malts, coffee or espresso, dark fruit, chocolate and a few other things that seem to be hard to pinpoint. The taste is very warming as you do notice a nice slight alcohol flavor that goes perfect with the tastes of chocolate and coffee and has the right amount of hop at the end. This is a very good brew one to be enjoyed during the cold winter. Now with the accolades for this brew here is a little take away, I do feel that I have had better Imperial Stouts in the past but this is right up there!"
"Pours deep black with a tight tan head that holds well. Smell is alcohol, roasted malt, chocolate, and a bit of espresso. Flavor is very nice. The alcohol comes through, but so do the big roasted malts, and the aftertaste is full of chocolaty goodness. There's a hint of citrus rind on the tongue that rounds things out nicely. And again, each sip finishes with a big chocolate burst. Medium mouthfeel complements these flavors very nicely. Surprisingly drinkable for a stout its size; I think I really dig this one!"
"Near syrupy mouthfeel with large bubbles, big beer for sure. Pleasing to drink, and for a 9% beer it wasn't too much effort to finish a bottle."
"This is a big beer. Packed with character (and alcohol), it's not for the faint of heart. A first-rate sipping beer."
"I'm really impressed by what I have seen from this brewery. Rasputin was one of the more interesting characters in Russian history. Its very fitting that someone would chose to name a brew with such character after him."
"Drinkability  the smoothness and beautiful finish create a fabulous Russian Imperial Stout experience"
"Delicious, roasted malt flavor. Little hint of hops; for the high alcohol volume it really isn't an overwhelming part of the flavor. Picked up a taste of raisins too. Nice smooth mouthfeel, and not a huge aftertaste. This is a beer I could see drinking all night. This was my first experience with a Russian imperial; big difference from the Irish stouts I'm used to, but definitely a beer I'd drink again."
"Wish the bottle had a bottled date. It's the same as the one pictured on BA, but the words ""Old Rasputin"" are in black and not gold. It was also just delevered to the beer store that day, not sure how much that goes towards quality control, but at least it was not on a shelf for the past 9 months. The beer poured into the glass a midnight black in color. Light was not even making it around the edges of the beer. A finger-width head formed on top of the beer, then dissipated to ring the glass. Stringy lace would form in small amounts around the glass as well. The aroma is of malts and burnt toffee. Also, just a touch of smoke. The taste is chocolate, old coffee, and malt. Hops come through in the aftertaste. Alcohol is just slightly present in the mouthfeel, but not in such a bad way. The only problem I foresee with drinking this beer is that it is kind of overwhelming and you will lose your taste buds after too long."
"Overall impression: Wow .. very nice stout. This is highly drinkable for the style - great for a winter night. This would also make a fantastic companion to a nice strong cigar .. in fact, time to crack another and light up!"
"A nice evening sipper for sure. Didn't except to see the flavors to show so much muscle. A nice surprise."
"Notes: Tasty, a little solventy alcohol flavors, definitely needs some cellaring."
"An exceptional imperial stout. Pours almost like a viscous expresso with very little head out of the bottle. Smell is overwhelmingly 'chocolate' like with a slight coffee aroma. My first impression when sipping it is hops and lots of hops. I prefer my imperial stouts with a strong hop backbone to support the loads of roasted malts otherwise the alcohol presence is overwhelming and they tend to be on the 'sweet side'. In this case there is a great balance and the alcohol isn't as noticeable. Overall is very similar to Storm King Stout by Victory Brewing. I highly recommend this beer to any imperial stout fan."
"from the bottle. poured black with a nice brown head. aroma caramel, bitter sweet chocolate, malts, plums, raisins, and other dark fruits, with hints of alcohol. coffee. flavor a nice bitter sweet chocolate, caramels, malt, a nice bitter dryness to this sure glad I picked up a 4 pack."
" To BAs, as I drank this, I wondered about how it would mix with the Mad Elf? I think pretty good. I will also have this again with a nice spirit accompaniment. Any suggestions?"
"An enjoyable sipping beer for this time of year."
"I would recommend this beer. It is true to style and never is overbearing. Each sip showcases a different aspect of this fine beer."
"But it sure didn't taste like it had an ABV that high."
"absolutly wonderful and even more so since I got this for free!!"
"Pours out a nice black brew with a 2 finger tan head,head recedes pretty quickly.Looks pretty well carbonated.Taste,,very hoppy up front and nice hints of coffee come into play and round it out.Slightly bitter linger detracts a little from the taste. Nice alcohol warming feeling.Very good Imp stout, would definitely have again."
"I very much enjoy this stout; although it is my first imperial stout, it is one of the better beers I have tasted and I would eagerly order a case of it."
"Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A lovely, warming stout for the cold weather months; a big beer and not for the faint-hearted"
"On tap at Barley's Smokehouse. As much as I hate drinking a non-Barley's beer at Barley's, no way am I going to pass this up. Served in a snifter. Pours black as night with a dense beige head. Thin and quick lacing. Great roasty aroma with malt, and robust coffee. Rich body with a great balance of sweet malt and caramel, along with coffee and sneaky hops that poke through periodically. The alcohol is well-hidden too but you can tell it is there. The finish is long and lightly bitter coffee and chocolate. An excellent Imperial Stout that is exemplary of the style."
"Drinkability- The only drawback is that you can feel this one after you finish it. You can still have another, but two is almost too much. Always will be one of my favorites."
"Bender Factor: Not as I expected. This has had some rave reviews.Perhaps cellaring would improve this."
"Thank you bashiba for this lovely brewski."
"This beer leaves the bottle black, with just a hint of light that comes through if I tilt it and hold it to the light. The small head falls to ring the beer. The nose is full of chocolate and an almost fruity sweetness in there. The flavor full on chocolate. There is a nice bitter finish on this one as well. A solid beer. The feel is thick, almost syrupy. Yum. Drinkability is not bad at all either. This is a nice winter beer. I'll grab one of these when it gets really cold. Warm me up well."
"Overall Impression: When the world has beaten, berated, shot, stabbed and thrown you into a frozen river, this beer will revive you and help you overcome. It is one of my favorites (can you tell?) and was a gateway for my life as a BA. Drinkability is more along the lines of I want this beer again, later. An amazing beer I cant recommend strongly enough."
"Drinkability/notes: A superb winter beer, truly deserves to be sipped and savored in the manner of a liqueur. Perfectly suited to the darkest, coldest nights of winter."
"This is a truly a well crafted beer, highly recommended. This is hands down one of my favorites."
"Comments - This beer more or less rules. Run out and buy some. Now. At one point in my life, this was the most intense beer experience imaginabe. Today, it is not far off from that."
"Pours a very dark, almost reddish black and has a thin tan head that left quickly and leaves sporadic lace on my glass. It reeks of burnt malt, raisins and coffee. It smell like one terrific stout on steroids AKA a Imperial Stout. The flavor is very robust and is a good mix of dark malts and heavy hopping. Although a bit low on the alcohol for the style, this beer still packs a punch. That does not detract from this beers drinkability, because it is too good to pass up."
"Drinkabilty: Imperial Stouts are not as drinkable as your typical session beer, but within this style this is the most drinkable. Relatively low ABV and very high complexity beg me to come back."
"My wife noted that it didn't mix well with the left-over halloween candy-corns she was eating :-)"
"Old Rasputin is a mega hoppy stout, perhaps a tad too hoppy. It's definitely not for the faint of heart or the faint of palate. Proceed only if you enjoy immensely flavorful, luxurious stouts that could fairly constitute a meal in and of themselves. Old Raspy is North Coast's best beer, I do believe."
"The aroma is of strong coffee, a bitter smell. Very malty and toffee smelling as well. The taste is much like a bitter, strong coffee. It is not thick as some stouts I have tasted. The aftertaste is like a bitter dark chocolate. The one thing apparent in the taste is the strong alcohol flavor. At 9%, it is not surprising, although some beers are better at masking the alcohol flavor than others. This one does not hide it, thus the reason for the drinkability sliding down the scale a little."
"This is one of my new favorite beers."
"This is an interesting mix. Stout like with a huge alcohol overtone in the finish. Lots of chocolate. Some coffee. If you are into any of these aspects of a beer, you MUST try this. If you are NOT, but like to experiment, do give this a try anyway - it is worth experiencing even if it isn't your style."
"Drinkability for me was pretty good, although I could see the 9% catching up quick after about 2 or 3. Too bad it only comes in 4 packs."
"""Party at Joe's tonight? I'll bring Rasputin!"""
"old rasputin pours a deep mohogany with decent head that dissapates to ring at the edge of me goblet quickly. the smell is heavy of coffee and alcohol. at 8.9% it is definatly a warmer. taste is heavy chocolate/ coffee with astrong alcohol and hops in the finish. almost overwhelmingly so. it fits so well with the style. an excellent example. mouthfeel is thick with little carbonation, warming. drinkability is good. semi-sweet chocolate and strong hop flavors make for a terrific ruskie imperial stout. berzerker."
"For me this is a solid imperial stout. It has an enticing character but is not too powerful. Complexity develops as the beer warms which keeps me interested and wanting another."
"A classic Russian Stout ; )"
"Appeared nearly black with dark brown highlights if angled correctly; a half finger tan head which left a nice, thick lacing as I drank. Aroma was spice, chocolate and raisins with a hint of prune. Taste up front was sweet, burnt dark malts, spicy and tangy in the middle with a nice bitter coffee finish, coupled with a warming from the high ABV. Mouth was thick and a little syrupy, not as syrupy as I would've liked though. Carbonation covered the tongue nicely. Taste wasn't as complex and exciting as I would've expected for an imperial stout but nonetheless, still quite good and not to be overlooked."
"It is thick in the mouth and very satisfying almost like a meal. I finished the four-pack quickly and will be heading back for more of the dusty gem."
"black as all heck apperance with a nice smokey smell.very smooth considering the alcohol content.what else can i say but,its yummy!"
"A great, great beer from an amazing style of brewing. I have to say I felt the mouthfeel was slightly lacking compared to beers Ive had of the style that have totally blown my mind. None-the-less I look forward to having this one again and it is going great with the slowly cooling weather of the southern fall. Thanks again John."
"In the drinkablility department it is a little high on the ABV so lends itself to be enjoyed in moderation, but I still found myself disappointed I didn't have another in the fridge."
"Delicious imperial stout. The alcohol is well hidden and the flavors are mixed very well."
"The taste is complex as the aroma and almost as enjoyable. It rolls on the tongue lightly until it hits the back where the flavor kicks in fully. The roasted malt has a smokey character, bitter chocolate, espresso, and a kick of hop to round off the flavors. The finish is dominated by the high alcohol of this brew and is a lesser beer for it. The mouthfeel is not as smooth as I expect from this type of beer and is my largest complaint. Overall this is an enjoyable beer for those in a slow sipping mood and worth revisitting time and again."
"Drinkability: Smooth alcohol flavor that melds into a vanilla profile making one dream for another."
"Definitely a good choice for dessert or as a winter warmer but by far not my favorite."
"Not as thick as it looks. That being said, damn, this tastes good. Not quite the flavor level of the Founders' or Sammy Smith's Imperial Stouts, but delicious none the less. It has a bitternes and smokey character that few other beers have. Less solid of a body as those beers too. That, of course, still makes it thicker than carro syrup, but hey, let's keep this beer fighting against brews of the same weight class. Everyone should try this once, it's a good time."
"This beer is HUGE. The flavors are intensly amazing. The deep dark black that pours out immediately fills the air with a heavy dose of sweet and toffee-like aromas. This beer to me seems very complex...if you take just a small sip, the sweetness is very evident and somewhat single layered. With a larger sip, more layers seem to expose themselves and the high ABV becomes increasingly evident. In a sense, I would have to say that reviewing this intensely flavored stout could vary greatly by your drinking style. IMHO, this is one of the hardest beers to truly appreciate because of its power. Definately not a beer to waste on a friend who says ""sure I'll take one of those....I love the way Guiness tastes"""
"If I ever get my hands on another one of these, I'll definately slap a ""do not open before x-mas"" sticker on it."
"Old Raspy was served from a stubby 12 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was black (deep ruby edge accents with backlighting), and was topped by a thin but persistant light brown head. The nose yielded deep-roasted-choco-molasses aromas that were accompanied by enticing though subtle notes of sasparilla, vanilla, and toasted sesame oil. Little sign of esters in the nose. The taste consisted of a rich dark-roasted cocoa-chocolate malt profile that was joined by some nice sharp dark cherry and plum notes that helped cut through initial roastiness. A robust smokey cocoa-bitter dark chocolate flavor dominates the subtle fruitiness in the finish, which left some rather flat lingering dark chocolate notes. The flavors are tasty and rich as expected, but I was dissapointed in the lack of complexity and interesting accents. I thought the finish was a bit too ""smoky"" as well. The body was appropriately smooth and full for the style. Old Rasputin is a full-flavored and robust Russian imperial stout, but for me lacks some of the important details found in many other examples of the style."
"I've tasted this blind versus Bells, Rogue and other world class Imperial Stouts. It is always worthy of the competition, but not quite there with the best. Savoring the flavors by itself, its hard to imagine why. A great beer in every way."
"Bottle: Poured a dark black colored beer with almost no head. Aroma is comprised of a strong chocolate and coffee mix. The chocolate and coffee also hits you right at the first sip along with some roastiness. A bit too much bitterness at the end for my liking though. Carbonation is bit weak and body is strong which was expected. Overall, this is a very good drink but maybe not as much as some make it out to be"
"This is one fine, soul-warming beer, sure to ward off the cold on those winter days. I do believe that Mr. Rasputin and I are going to spend a lot of time together in the future."
"While I really enjoyed this beer, it didn't quite have the ""wow"" factor I might have expected. Still, if you kick back, pour an inch or two at a time into a good tasting glass and spend and hour or so with Rasputin, he'll be your buddy for life."
"The smell is malt; taste is malt and sweet. For a beer with 8.9% ABV It doesn't taste alcoholic, but does have a roasted coffee chocolate aftertaste with a smooth light mouthfeel."
"Highly drinkable stuff all year round, but I'd love to have a stock of this to soothe me in the winter time. I'm very impressed, the wait was worth it, but I want more now. Lucky are the people in Vancouver, where I had to go to pick some of this up here in Canada."
"Truly a masterful beer."
"Drinkability is alright but, because of the high octane, would only do it once in a while. Not a bad beer by any stretch, just not consumable often."
"I'm sitting her drinking one right now and all I can says is, WOW. This is one of the best stouts I have ever had the pleasure of drinking outside of fresh from the tap at a brewpub. An incredibly flavorful mix of coffee, chocolate, hops and more. The smell is intoxicating and just begs for you to savor it. I'm very glad I found this brew and I will be getting more soon. Cheers to North Coast Brewing Co. for brewing an incredible stout. I definetely recommend anyone who enjoys stout to run out and try this now!"
"tastes very much a coffee with what seems to me a hint of dark fruits. an alcohol pepperiness is quite apparent. the beer finishes with the same peppery flavour that eases into a strong hoppy bite. very enjoyable."
"Final Thought: Storm King is 9.1%, this is 8.9%, same ballpark, but the alcohol in the taste ruins the total picture... still sticking with Victory for a Domestic Imperial Stout."
"An absolute pleasure to drink - slowly."
"A little too big to drink more than one though."
"Drinkability suffers from the very noticeable alcohol, but I'll definitely buy another."
"Drinkability: Overall a very drinkable beer for such a strong alcohol tone towards the finish. Fits the style well and the malts help back up this beautiful beer."
"Wow this review is going to be all over the board. Old Rasputin pours a black hole dark that is chilling to look at, very nocturnal. The tan thick mocha head is amazing, by far the best head I have seen in sometime, the lacing coats the glass, almost feels like it becomes the glass. The smell is amazing, mocha caramel and hints of dark ghiradelli chocolates. Picked up cinnamon and toasted marshmellow characters as well. The taste was very dry and weak, the roasted malts were bland and dry, alcohol was easy to pick up on, the bitterness outweighed the sweetness a little to much. A full bodied stout and very dry. Nice to look at and warming on those chilly days, but a true stout will make you crave it all times of the year, this was not one of them."
"Pours black with ruby edges and a tan lacing. This is a good looking stout. Smells of prominent carmel and roasted malts lead to my anticipation. Tastes malty and has a hint of dried fruit to finish. A nice balance of malts and sweetness. This is another beer that makes me sad when I get to the bottom of the glass. This is a fantastic beer. I would highly recommend this brew to anyone. Drink it all if you can find it!"
"Not as smooth and creamy as I would like, but the flavors pack a wallup. Alcohol is there and lets you know it, accompanied by an unsweetened coffee ice cream flavor. This one needs to cellar a little while. A bit harsh now, though with potential."
"This was the first Imperial Stout I ever tried, had it a few years ago that turned me on to the style and havent had it since for some reason. So I decided to pick it up and see what I thought of it now. Pours an opaque black color with a decent tan head. Not much retention, but it does leave a bit of lacing. Aroma is brimming with dark chocolate and coffee flavors with a bit of sweetness in there as well. The flavor is a bit mild with chocolate and coffee being at the forefront and a bit of hop bitterness as well. The alcohol defiantly comes out the more this one warms. This has a full-bodied mouthfeel with light carbonation. Overall a good imperial stout but there are plenty out there that I would prefer."
"Completely black, except at the bottom of my glass where there is a brown glowing base through the murky beer. Big tan head that sticks to the sides of my glass in a cobweb pattern. Smells of bittersweet chocolate, espresso, raisins, and a tinge of alcohol. Flavor is just a kick to the teeth. Like drinking an extra strong cup of coffee, with a good amount of alcohol and hops bitterness thrown in for good measure. Very big beer, the best Imperial Stout I have had, tastes more like a stout than Sammy Smith's. I like this one, and would recommend it to any stout fan."
"Poured into a small goblet with minimal foaming. Opaque in color. Aroma of espresso. Starts with intense coffee and chocolate flavors, then more chocolate, almost burnt chocolate until a long bitter finish laced with alcohol. Mouthfeel and body are almost similar to a fuller bodied wine such as a cabernet. The most memorable character of this beer is its profound bitterness in the finish. I've had this on tap before and I think I enjoyed more off a tap than out of the bottle. It went especially well with some Mississippi Mudcake. On its own, and out of the bottle, it comes across as a bitter strong stout and bit brash. Still, a damn fine stout."
"Had 4.5 years later and certainly stands up over time. There are more ""big"" RIS but for a bitter coffee one, this is the classic."
"The taste at first is surprisingly milky and rich, followed by a burnt malt taste, then more sweet milk flavors. As the beer warms, most of these goes away, leaving me with oily burnt malts, perhaps some chocolate, and what I might even call peanut butter flavors! Towards the end of the glass, I got some nice hop notes that finished off the beer wonderfully. Throughout I got the typical (and enjoyable) imperial stout tingles on my tongue. Yum."
"This brew has a black body, with some reddish hues. Large brown foam head, leaves sheets of lace behind in its wake. The scent is big chocolate malt. The chocolate malts also dominate the taste, the wingers are some bitter hop and slight alcohol spice. Full creamy mouthfeel. This is a great big bold stout without any of the flavors being overpowering."
"Not the easiest beer in the world to drink, but worth every sip."
"drinkability is really high, as is the alcohol content... So prepare for a good night."
"Looks like I need to go back to the market and pick up the other 3 I left behind!"
"This is a great beer, will definitely be added to my list of favorites (especially since it's now available in FL...yay!)"
"Appearance is a dark brown with ruby hints behind it. Head is less than a finger and recedes very quickly to a tiny layer of foam. The smell is chocolatey spice, but it is also very alcoholic too. Very little hops or malts are evident. The taste is actually very sweet, and it actually tastes like a less tasteful stout with a shot of whisky in it, adding a heavy alcoholic and sweet taste to it. Besides that there are some fruity tones to it, but I really cant get by that initial sweet alcoholicness. The mouthfeel is medium body with plenty of carbonation, which is fine. However, I find this beer tasting way too alcoholic to me."
"Poured out of a stubby bottle with a picture of the Russian mystic on the label (I am assuming this is Rasputin, as I have never seen other pictures of him). When poured into my trusty goblet, the dark brown body is nearly completely opaque, but displays red highlights at the edges when held up against the light. The head is brown in color, massive in size (at least three inches), and has the consistency to stand up on its own above the rim of the glassware. This is one impressive looking beer indeed. The aroma is a mixture of medicinal alcohol, and powdered cocoa, and is relatively mild. The taste is like roasted cracked grain, bitter coffee, unsweetened dark chocolate, dark skinned dried fruits, and charred wood. Very pronounced hop bitterness and a very dry aftertaste are also present, as is the noticeable warming effect of the significant alcohol content. Mouthfeel is soft and soothing, but a bit thinner than what I anticipated. Very good representation of the style, but a bit less in your face than others like Victory Storm King Stout."
"Impenetrable, solid black color with a thin, lasting light brown head. Somewhat vinuous aroma, with heavy smells of coffee and chocolate. Taste is initially sweet: roasted and burnt malts. Very faint grain. Alcohol, which is hidden in the smell, comes forth in the mid-taste, and presents a pleasant warming.. Hop bitterness is strong and crisp. Finish is relatively dry. Soft and full mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable and complex beer. Theres a lot of interactive, well-balanced flavors in this beer. Its a pure treat."
"Picked up two singles at AJ's recently. Thick, dark brown brew poured a very generous head that surprisingly did not leave much lacing. The wife who poured the 1st one commented that she had to hit the bottom of the bottle to get everything out a la catsup. Smells of toasted malts and coffee. The taste complexity is interesting as it starts of smooth but quickly is taken over by the toasted malts finishing with a seemingly higher than usual (for a stout) hop somewhat sweet finish. Nice full mouthfeel. A very enjoyable brew which I plan on enjoying again."
"Drinkability is a little bit thin for an Impy Stout but very pleasant beer."
"A good Imperial Stout, however, it is not as well balanced as others in its class."
"Great way to finish my taxes and welcome the Springtime."
"Pours out a dark black with a medium brown head that remains with you and your beer till the very last drop. Sweet malty chocolate roastiness and dark espresso was the combination in the aroma. Taste was similar chocolate, roasted malt, plums and espresso/really dark coffee. Very good stuff had a sweet flavor but not overly sweet, as it warmed it smoothed out and the flavors came out a little more. Easy drinking brew very little carbonation and a medium to full bodied texture. This is all good here."
"Almost pitch-black in hue, when I held the glass to the light I could notice hints of ruby around the edges. The beige head reached a lifeless finger in height before swiftly fading to a sparse soapy collar. The subsequent lacing was very minimal and hardly noteworthy. The appearance is average and thus disappointing. The potency of the nose is small, it is too calm for a beer this big and far too quiet for how warm I allowed it to get before I poured it, anyway, the bouquet does have lovely aromas of chocolate, dates, raisins, a slight hint of coffee beans but more so espresso, and a kiss of vinous liquor. I found the detectable aromas to be very pleasant and quite welcoming. I am impressed with the flavors on the palate, upfront is a roasted malt bitterness, coffee beans, espresso, and bark. In the middle these flavors wane and allow a softer, more rounded chocolate covered dark-fruit to surface; the brandy/sherry-like alcohol swallow these flavors. As the finish begins the piney, slightly citrusy hops emerge; the aftertaste is roasted and hoppy. This is a very nice beverage; the mad monk is damn tasty! It does seem a little sugary as it sits on my tongue but this seems to be more of a mouthfeel concern than a taste issue. Medium-full in body, low but natural carbonation, I like the mouthfeel, it is nothing special but full enough for the style. The big alcohol content is scarcely noticeable; it provides more flavor than anything else. This is a very good Imperial Stout, I know this is a broken record, but I wish this was available locally. If it were, Id drink it regularly. As is, I will sip and savor my lonely 12-ounce bottle that I purchased in Loveland. Good stuff."
"ng"
"Drinkability: This is a good one, for sure. As with most things, I have others I would look to before this one. It is quite good, and quite roasty and bitter, if that's your thing. I could put back a couple, but it is a filling stout and the alcohol seems so much more strong than 8.9%. Go check it out."
"A complex brew, but with a bit too much emphasis on the alcohol. It seems to dominate the other flavors to a point where the overall effect is compromised. Good, not great."
"Overall a damn fine creation from the talented folks at North Coast. Have another? Well thanks for asking - I will."
"Dark.We are talking BLACK.Nice tan head of about an 1/8 inch that quickly receedes.Not as much aroma of some other Imperials.Slight coffee/licorice.WOW!!!Flavor makes up for not a lot of aroma.Roasted malt-not overly harsh.Anise.Licorice.Nice malty sweetness in the backround.No alchohol burn present.Inky/oily mouthfeel.The roasted malt comes across more than any hop bitterness.Quite a smooth and satisfying dish.Its nice to see such a flavorfull Imperial Stout at only 9%.Makes it so you can have a few if you like.Great,great beer."
"Blind Tasting, thanks Ecrvich It pours very dark brown, definitely not opaque with an off-white film that sticks to the glass rather well. Aroma is assertively malty which shows as bubblegum, melon, milk and candy flavours. Hop profile is rather chalky, dry and alcohol is not particularly well hidden. Fruity palate with watermelon, pepper. This is a complex beer with a sweet side that I love, but I just can't get myself to appreciate this astringent, chalky and roasty sour hoppiness and very obvious alcohol. It just doesn't work with me. Medim bodied with rather intense carbonation. Another beer that doesn't measure up to my expectations which I start to guess are simply to high."
"Surprised to find this at Casey's in Ann Arbor... Black used oil color in ""bar lighting"" with a tan head that sticks around for most of the party. Hints of dark chocolate and toasted nuts. You can smell some of the roasted bitterness for sure, though this is clearly not the hop monster many imperials are these days. Snappy bitterness is present throughout. But overtones of chocolate and vinous flavor swirl around atop the bitterness. The bitterness, of course, re-emerges at the finish supplemented by hops. I think this feels a bit thinner than it actually is for some reason. Quite easy and fun to drink for an imperial."
"Pours a jet black with a thick tan head that lasts throughout. Deep smells of strong roasted malts and bittering hops. The taste is of espresso and chocolate with a burnt flavor. Thick body with a crisp tastes of hops. Very smooth feel and the alcohol simply warms the stomach. The aftertaste is a lingering coffee and hop flavor that lasts. This beer is bold, complex, and delicious. This is a classic plain and simple."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick dark brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It is full of black and chocolate malts; very aromatic. The taste is good. It's quite complex and full of dark and roasted malts. It has a nice black/chocolate flavor. The moutheel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer; a fine imperial stout."
"Barely any carbonation noticeable. Goes down like a melted milkshake."
"A nightcap all the way to bed."
"It's almost opaque, very dark brown, and the head is thick and ample. Bakers chocolate seems to be the strongest part of the aroma, also slight hints of ripe dark fruits, and a bit of crisp hops....quite enjoyable. Enjoyably smooth on the palate...creamy, full of bakers chocolate and dark fruit flavors. Alcohol shows itself through the finish and into the aftertaste, adding a warming character to accentuate the crisp hops that also finish it off. One heluva stout here, easily drinkable for such a brute, and quite fulfilling."
"As time goes by I like stouts more and more and this is one of the best."
"I was looking forward to sampling this after hearing good things through this site. It poured with a very small tan head and an almost pitch black hue. I like the smell, sweet and smokey. The mouthfeel is quite silky while remaining quite syrupy as well. It's certainly heavy and the high alcohol content is obvious. I think the real treasure of the brew is the finish, in which you're hit with a smokey, cherry, and alcohol taste, in that order. This is a beer you have to sit back and enjoy. Wasn't quite as good as my expectations, but still good."
"This is a great overall stout. It pours to a classic dark, moderately carbonated state. It's got a solid, full-flavor taste, and a nice bitter chocolate aftertaste. Very drinkable considering the alcohol content and style. I can definitely see more of this in my future."
"Looks really good. It's got that classic black body and a head that sprang up out of nowhere to be the perfect size. I was interested by the aroma of this beer. It smells distinctly of cocoa, and I can't stress distinctly enough. I've never had a beer with the same smell. There's also some alcohol in the aroma. The taste was a little disappointing. The chocolatey aspect remained but was masked to some degree by the overt alcohol flavor. It was like some kind of strong chocolate liqueur. Still not a bad beer, it just need to settle down a bit."
"Anyways, if you are a fan of darker beers, stouts, porters, etc, I would say poney up the cash and buy a 4-pack of this, you will not regret it. If you are not much into the style, I would say this is the king of (relatively) available Imperial Stouts (well, in my opinion, perhaps it shares that title with Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout), so why not sample the best of the style?"
"Based on the ruby fringes (visible only with the lamp turned up to max), this seems to be a clear beer. That being said, this one is black enough to appear opaque. Topped off with a finger's worth of chocolate milk-like froth that reduces quickly to a thin but persistent and clingy layer of bronzy beige. Despite the ominous darkness, the smell is remarkably complex and pleasant. Roasted notes are lighter than expected and complemented very nicely by the scent of milk chocolate. Some bitterness up front followed by a creamy mouthfeel that succumbs again to the bitterness. A blast of alcohol warmth shows up and fades very slowly. As mentioned above, the mouthfeel is creamy, but it also maintains an astringency rather than the clingy fullness one might expect or desire from a potent stout. Roasted grains and chocolate are there as well, but again are balanced nicely by the assertive hops. This is more complex than I anticipated and is a nice change of pace among stouts."
"Drinkable for what it is, a Beer H-bomb."
"This stunningly black beer pours with a slick thickness. A nice creamy tan head billows up but flees before I can really take it in. Moderate lacing in the glass. Aroma is all roasted malts and a slight alcholic tang. Notes of licorice and chicory are fleeting but round out the smell nicely. Taste is sublime, especially at cellar temperature. A bitter roastiness makes a quick entrance and sticks to the mouth throughout. There are interesting notes of strong, real maple syrup, horehound and something almost camphoracious. The finish is sweet and smooooth. A lovely hop bitterness with some mineral notes lingers. Mouthfeel is akin to cooled-down hot chocolate. Certainly not refreshing, but one hell of a smooth Imperial stout. A true ""meal-in-a-bottle"" beer. Drinkability is fantastic one one hand, because of the unique flavors and smooth feel. Conversely, the high ABV makes it a serious sipping beer, which is detrimental in my opinion. This is an altogether stupendous beer, and I am not just saying that because it was brewed in my hometown!"
"12 oz bottle at cellar temp. Caramel , toasted malt and burnt fruit nose. Black, w/ a dark tan head. Tiny bubble head leaves a bit of lacing. Balance/complexity easy to tell this is a finely crafted creation. Heavy body, coating mouthfeel, a fine winter brew."
"Taste: Creamy mouthfeel, and loads of burnt, roasted malt. Sharp alcohol bite, with a burst of coffee flavors after the swallow. Very dry in the finish, with a slightly green hop flavor lingering in the end."
"Wow, Old Rasputin you taste great! Very well balanced and well hopped. Nice hop bitterness towards the finish and an onslaught of flavor just coats my entire mouth. This is the type of beer that will linger in my mouth for hours upon hours. Black licorice, roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, salt and more roasted malts were the dominant flavors. My only issue with Mr. Rasputin is that he seems a little thin in the mouth but he makes up for it in other ways. It's okay."
"Overall a wickedly tasty stout that goes down surprisingly smooth, and a regular in my fridge."
"Exceptionally compex and wonderfully warm. This is a very good beer."
"This is not nearly as drinkable as I'd like it to be. I think I will let the remaining beers age for a while before I try it again. The taste just didn't quite match the smell or the appearance. Hopefully time will give it some more character."
"One problem. I decided to review this as a porter other than a stout because it has qualities found in porters rather than stouts. I think it should be classified as an Imperial Porter."
"This one has a black cola-like coloring with a brownish/orange head. Immediately after opening the bottle, a strong chocolate smell emerges. The taste is intensely bitter, like baker's chocolate, but with noticeable amounts of alcoholic tone. Old Rasputin has a tannic mouthfeel, like sucking a teabag or coffee grounds. Not as creamy or as say, a porter or (non-Imperial) stout, but admittedly, the taste mellows out significantly after the first half. Not exactly what I'd call a session beer. This is more of an experience than just any beer."
"paid $5.99 for a 4 pack."
"Drinkability--Very true to the style. While I personally wouldn't repeatedly drink Imperial Stouts all night, this would be a top pick for this style."
"This is something the Russians obviously must not do half-assed, if this domestic offering is any gauge. This is thick, dark, full-bore flavor, never dancing, but rather plowing straight foward. The muli-layered bitterness is capably offset by a lesser but poignant underlying sweetness. The dense balance makes a grand impression, and despite the hefty ABV, more than one is virtually a certainty. I may not be a czar, but this down-to-earth elixir is welcome in my dacha anytime!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this offerering and I'm glad I bought 2. It lacks a little of the complexity of the Storm King, but it's a damn fine beer that can help warm you on frigid winter nights. It is easy to imagine yourself drinking a few of these in the royal Russian court listening to Rasputin spin tales."
"Rich roasty slightly metalic and sweet cocoa in the smell. Dark black opeque look medium sticky tan head. Quite a lively mouth and tongue.. also the brew is much lighter on the mouth than it looks. Initial black malt taste gives way to a a dry cocoa powder and expresso finish. A slight touch of metalic tin and sweetness is left on the tip of the tongue as well. Quite a roasty treat, it is a great night cap beer."
"All in all this was an excellent example of an Imperial Stout. I would defiantly try it again, hopefully on tap."
"I had this on-tap this evening and it was just great!! It came with a nice thick light-brown head that died down slowly leaving a small creamy head for the entire glass. It smelled of coffee, chocolate and a little alcohol. It tastes smooth and is inline with it's smell. There was some bitterness that really stuck to the tongue and throat. It felt creamy and smooth in the mouth with a small bite of alcohol in the throat. I could drink a few of these at my local pub. I doubt if this will be on tap again very soon in my future. I will have to try the bottled version to find out if it as good."
"This has to be the most easy to drink Imperial Stout I've ever had. It poured an almost opaque black with a awesome brown head that was so big I had to wait a few minutes for it to die down. The smell was of dark chocolate and hops. The taste was just about the same as the smell, with a perfect mix of coffee flavors in there. The thing I loved about this brew is that it was powerful but not overpowering. I could sit back and enjoy the whole 4 pack in one sitting, even though they are 8.9% a piece! Great beer!"
"Poured a nice deep smooth black with about an inch worth of head that dissipated slowly while drinking it. Sweet aroma with chocolate and candy like notes, possibly molasses.(?) Taste was very nice the choolate was accompanied by coffee and a roasted fruit I can't quite nail down. Barley carbonated, it's finish was smooth as glass, very good. Not the best but it's up there!"
"Poured a wonderful dark opaque brown with a tan head that had patchy lace all over the sides of my brand new 3 phils chalice. Smell was very sweet with huge molassas and brown sugar and some figish ester notes. Smelled similar to the brooklyn black chocolate. The taste was very dry and chalky with a slight metallic twang and bitter chocolate notes. There was little hops present, which surprised me coming from a west coast creation. Aftertaste left a sweet, dry red wine effect and a distinct roasted grain taste. Very minimal carbonation with small bubbles here and there. I would like to try a vertical to see how well this holds up. Not a bad Imperial, but I have had much better."
"The taste is incredible. Big waves of coffee, burnt malt, dark malt, licorice, and fig crash down on my tounge. The alcohol is well hidden and the finish is slightly dry. Just an incredible big, thick, chewy stout. Wish I could afford to drink it all the time."
"Paid $6.49 for a 4-pack of this stuff at a local store. Poured extremely dark and thick. Resembles other Imperial Stouts bu this one has a very disticnt smell and taste. Smelled very nutty, almost reminiscent of some porters I've had. Malts hit the nose right away. Nice sweet taste, the alcohol is present. However the nice coffee taste covers it up nicely. At 8.9%abv it does have a kick, but a four pack of these is great. Sipped them all ice and slow. If you like stouts give this one a shot."
"This was an excellent brew. I am totally in debt to the Vintage Cellar for letting me sample it. It was a very nice super dark brew with a beautiful head. It mad me want to cry. Well, not really, but if I was an unstable person I guess I would have. The smell was like most imperials, but with more substanance. It was really heavy on the malts, which is something I totally dig. This is the perfect cold weather brew."
"Although not bitter, so much as burnt. Like delicious slightly burnt whole wheat pizza crust. Aroma of licorice and contrastingly rich earth. Defininately maltier than hoppier, but the hops do make themselves known on the finish. Not oily, but slick. Not thick, but voluptous."
"Clear black beer with ruby highlights. Poured with a large head that fell back slowly. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, and hops. Flavor is huge and complex with chocolate, coffee, and hops. Bitterness is well done and lasts into bitter coffee chocolate finish. The body is spot on and drinkability is very good."
"The mouthfeel was somewhat dry, smooth, and creamy. The coffee, slight bitterness, and chocolate last on the tongue long into the aftertaste. Alcohol is very noticable in this compared to other imperial stouts, knocking down the drinkability one notch."
"Regardless a wonderful Imperial stout indeed!"
"I have to say this is the best imperial stout I have had so far,pours a deep borwn but not quite black with a light almond colored head,aroma is burnt with some rasin notes.The taste is a bombshell very buttery and rum-like with some light earthy tones,love the butteriness of this beer along with the rum flavor.A real complex brew that is pretty easy to drink for the alcohol content,what a real nice beer."
"The thing that struck me most about this beer was the strong presence of the alcohol, both in the taste and in the after effects. This is certainly a complex beer with a strong coffee and chocolate bitterness. The appearance is nearly black, a slight tinge of dark red is visible when held up to the light. The smell is potent and prepares the drinker for the flavor to come. This is definitely a well crafted beer that is full of flavor. However, I marked it down in some areas mainly because of personal tastes. I found it somewhat difficult to drink because of the strong almost burning presence of the alcohol. I have had other high alcohol beers before and not been put off by the alcohol, I am not sure why I was by this one. Overall it is definitely worth a try."
"This is a nice change of pace beer, a good imperial stout."
"I recently purchased this four pack so I am assuming it is pretty fresh. Doesn't appear to be bottle conditioned but I think that I will cellar the other 3 for awhile. Just to see how they do."
"Pours black, although not opaque black, but dark, dark ruby when held to light with a huge tan foam that sticks to the glass. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate and coffee, very sweet. Very rich and full taste. At first there is a bit of hop bitterness, then the malty sweetness, chocolate and coffee. Ends dry with an alcohol finish. Velvety mouthfeel. Wow, this one is for the ages. A great imperial stout and not at all overpowering. This beer can sneak up on you though."
"Among my favorite beers by North Coast, brewed an hours drive from my town back home. A good beer for relaxing, but not one to go all night on. Overall a fine imperial."
"I'm new to imperial stouts, but this one is very drinkable. Perfect companion to an open fireplace. Rasputin will leave you with a nice warm feeling, as you might expect from the abv."
"Not a bad stout, but lacks the fullness and breadth to be an imperial. An excellent stout overall, and many no doubt will overlook the thinness in deference to its amazing sweetness."
"Let me tell you something: If I ever wake up and realize I'm a hemophiliac, I'm jumpin' in the ol' Monte Carlo and zooming out to Half Time to buy another bottle of Old Rasputin. Na zdorovia, comrade!"
"A good Imperial Stout, though one that goes to your head quickly. Give it a try, if just for the ominous picture on the bottle."
"I'm not a strong brew fan, but the mouthfeel was equally impressive for its strength. True, it's a sipper, but warm and full-bodied. For what it is, very drinkable for the high abv. Everyone should try a bottle, and if you are really brave try two!"
"Pours with zero carbonation, and not as thick as expected. No head retention and has a dark brown body. Held to the light it has a ruby glow to it. Nice chocolatey aroma with notes of sweet candy and hops. Flavor follows in kind. Bitter dark chocolate gives way to a nice roasted malt flavor, followed by a crisp hop finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, but is somewhat spritzy and could be better. A damn fine Imperial, though honestly I expected a little more. Nonetheless, definitely worth seeking out, especially if you love beers of this delightful style."
"Appearance:Dark, opaque, the head is a dark brown and very retentive. Smell: Malt sweetness, roasted malts, and hops, in a pretty nice balance. Taste: Big roastiness in front, then, hops, then sweetness at the end...which is very odd, as sweetness is usually the first thing you taste. Works great, though! Mouthfeel is rich, thick and creamy, with a little residual dryness from the roasted malts. Obviously not something you would knock back many pints of it, but it still is easy to drink for an imperial stout."
"Had a beautiful dark color, a coffee chocolate aroma, initialy a smooth velvety feel in the mouth, but the CO2 started coming on strong. The first tastewas complex, fruit chocolate carmel, but then a big bitter alcohol taste started building in the back of my throat and became unpleasant. This is good stuff, but you probaly have to sip it slower than Scotch Whiskey"
"Pours thick & black with some ruby highlights when held up to the light. Nice frothy tan head that gave the ""waterfall"" effect upon pouring. Aroma is strong in the malt department. Very sweet, yet there are some hops to calm things down a bit. An alcohol bite clears up the sinuses. This is one beer that's full of taste. Starts off with a deep sweet maltiness, followed by some hop bitterness fighting back, ending with a nice roasted malt aftertaste. There is some fruitiness in there all the while just trying to make things even more interesting. Decent carbonation that gives way to a nice slick mouthfeel, with a quite sticky aftertaste. Very drinkable stout, and dangerous at that. I could drink this all night....and end up with a rough morning. Great Beer...'nuff said"
"Thick, oily and black, definite brown head, that is quite meringue like, tops this brew. A sweet roast malt aroma emanates from my glass, followed by a note of coffee. Quite thick, though not overly so. Strong malt presence, definite roast malt character as well. This beer is like chewing on a roast malt kernel, it has the same after taste and everything. Even though thick and malty the roast character lets this beer finish like it is quite dry. There is a bit of oiliness in this beer. The beer is very smooth, yet still carbonated. Almost a cola not to this as it first hits my mouth."
"This is a great Imperial. The head is surprisingly huge. Very dark brown color. Not much aroma detected. The taste is very similar to Storm King, only not as cloying. Dark fruits and roasted malts, with a nice hoppy aftertaste. Drinkability is high. I think I could have about three is one sitting. In summation, better than Storm King, not as good as Willy Shakes."
"Backwash: I have to say that I enjoyed this MUCH more than the Storm King. I found that it had better balance, allowing the perception of many different flavors. It has all of the flavor and is smoother. Perhaps the Storm King is a beer better sampled after aging (I have some from last year for comparison), while this is ready to go now. The lighter body and slight sweetness remind me of Perkuno's Hammer. I’d love to try some of the Millennium Edition, as it is described as being very thick. Unfortunately, I passed on the one bottle of it that I saw. I can imagine how something like this kept Rasputin alive under the ice of the Neva."
"First introduced to this one early on in my beer advocacy, feels good to return to an old friend. Appearance: Pours deep viscous black toned deep purple ruby highlights full tan two finger sized head perfect looking beer, oh so nice with perfect evenly laced foam. Aroma: Deep cocoa, espresso infused, undertones of alcohol infused fruit along with a great bready sweet malt tone this is one awesome imperial stout in my opinion it sets the bar. Taste: Wow complex swirling spiral of flavor alcohol infused fruit, doses of hardcore strong coffee notes, and dark chocolate playing the tie the flavors together predominantly bitter from the dark roasts there are some hops evident in the flavor. Creamy balanced mix of so many flavors works so well, gotta love the Ol' Raspy. Mouthfeel: Full bodied syrupy goodness of massive flavors this is one extraordinary beer, a must try. Drinkability: No questions as to it's placement on the top 50 beer list, this one does it so well remaining amazingly drinkable and flavorful is the key for an Imperial stout not cloying in anyway and you yearn for another one the glass is empty that's what it's all about."
"damn near opaque beer with just a tint of amber around the edges. the tan and amber head was strong and stout leaving a very impressive lace. scents of caramel, toffee, espresso, pumpernickel, rye and a half dozen roses.balanced scents, also the alcohol is evident and warming. a sweet start of caramel, coffee, espresso, molasses, a dark bready malt that brings a roasty sweetness before it dries up and gets a warm bitter, similiar to a cafe au lait. the mouthfeel was so creamy and rich, just a few bubbles making it so silky and oh how nice. what a hearty beer."
"this is one of the oddest reviews i'm probably ever gonna have to make, with my ratings all over the map, pretty much. this brew is made exceptionally well. it looks damn near perfect, with a dark as night pour and an awesome tan head that provides an equally awesome cascading effect. so far, a damn near perfect beer. smells of coffee, chocolate, roatsed malt with hints of fruitiness (raisins, perhaps?). nothing that blew me out of the water, but a good, solid smell nonetheless. the taste, while obviously appealing to most drinkers, just wasn't for me. i don't like coffee to begin withm and the coffee taste here simply overpowered all other tastes too much. the other dominant flavour here was the alcohol, which was surprising since the smell gave hardly any indication of, and at 8.9%, i figured it'd be all over the place with this one. it's a generally smooth brew overall, but i can't say that i'd be able to have any more than one at a time, and would probably only try this again on a rare occasion. i was surprisingly disappointed here...like i said, a well made brew, just not my cup of tea (or coffee, in this case)."
"Thanks Bruiser!"
"A great stout that probably is the flagship brew of North Coast Brewery. Pours a black/brown color with a dense foamy head reminding me of real whipped cream stirred in. Very thick mouthfeel that lingers on the palate. This beer has 8.9% alcohol, but it is not apparent in the taste because it is so smooth. The alcohol is only slightly noticeable in the aftertaste. A quality blend of toasted wheat bread and coffee notes with a lace that clings to the glass as well as the tongue. This is a very competitive stout overall."
"Mark"
"Well, if this is what Rasputin was drinking the night he was killed, it explains why he was so difficult to take down. Old Rasputin has a rugged, hard edge to it that cuts into its drinkability. Overall, not bad but I've had some I've liked better. I'll drink them instead."
"not sure about quanity but sure has the quality. a last beer of the nigh sit and watch tv listen to music beer. mmm mmm good."
"Mmmm...imperial stout...truly one of the great treats of the beer world. Though I sadly don't get to enjoy its unique pleasures enough, when I do it's a treat to be savored. North Coast truly makes an imperial stout up there with the best of them, and this is certainly one I'll have again."
"Thanks too Brent, I was finally able to consume this long sought after beverage. Just the look through the bottle let you knew, this is a beer not to be reckoned with. The old picture of the monk himself teases, just teases you to try and dare consume this liquid concoction. The beer pours a very dark black. The only thing blacker than this liquid is my ex girlfriend's heart. When held too the light, this beer shows a shimmer of blood ruby. Only problem in presentation? Next to no head. Just a little film of bubbles, which does last throughout drinking. Scent, oh the scent. The nostrils are kicked in the sinuses with roasted malts, dark chocolate, arabica coffee beans, bitter hops, raisins, plums, prunes, red grapes, and various spices from around the world. One could write an essay on the olfactory pleasure of this beer. Taste is very damn similar too smell, though hops were stronger in the tongue than on the nose. This is actually very hoppy tasting. Like an IPA turned stout. But that roast malt is still their, ever so powering, ever so warm. Coffee and chocolate entwine together in this erotic dance that would leave any man's scrotum with a case of rigomortis. The fruits act as a sweet song, which the coffee and chocolate dance too. Spices are the final touch, the decorations on the ballroom walls. Just beautiful, damn beautiful. The mouthfeel is hard too explain. It's strong, but neither thick nor syrupy. Though this is not flattering to the brew at all, it's like gasoline. Gasoline is like oil, both are fuel, but oil is thick and gasoline is not. I shall definitely be drinking this again, if I can find it again. A beer meant to be enjoyed like an old port or hand crafted cigar. Any more than one at a sitting is simply too much of a good thing."
"Usually I'm not a fan of Imperial Stouts, but this one looked cool and I was hooked into buying it for the looks and name. Pours a very dark color with a moderate sized tan head that dies off after a few minutes. Leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was burned malts and coffee/chocolate and some sort of spiciness (odd for an imperial stout?). This is a big beer. The flavor was majorly strong. Way too strong for my taste buds to accept. Tastes of alcohol, burned malts, slight spiciness, and maybe a little fruitiness. Didn't care much for it."
"If ever I can find good things to say about Rasputin, I will joyfully update and upgrade my ratings. But until then, this is just nasty."
"Tasted: 09/09/2003"
"Black color, medium head. Aroma is chocolate and roasted malts. Roasted malts, lightly hopped. Roasted malt flavor very pronounced, slightly dry taste as well. Big and Bold Stout. Finish is crisp and malty. Aftertaste is dry and there is a very slight metallic tinge. Very pleasant finish. NICE stout."
"Notes: By all means the equal of top notch Impy's like Victory's Storm King, Bear Republic's Big Black Bear and Stone's IS. Love the finish."
"This is one kick ass imperial!!! It is a 12oz bottle with a hypnotizing pic of Rasputin on the label. I had this one immediately after Stone's Imperial, and thought this one was at least as good, if not better. Jet black appearance, pretty much on par with other top imperials I've had. A very strong aroma consisting mainly of alcohol and burnt coffee. Tasted pretty much just as it smelled, and was a nice combination of the two (alcohol and coffee). I had no problems with a bottle of this, and I did want at least one more of these when I was finished! A must try for imperial lovers."
"A nice black Imperial stout body with a slightly tan head. It smelled like coffee and a little bit of chocolate. The taste was very smooth with light carbonation and a very heavy taste of coffee/espresso and a little bit of chocolate. I could see how the coffee taste could be overpowering for some. Im not a huge stout fan but I could actually drink a couple of these and have no problem. A brew that even Rasputin himself could be proud of."
"Translucent deep dark burgundy with a foamy tan head. I've never seen a prettier beer. Aroma is of chocolate, hazelnuts, raisins, and alcohol. My wife said it smells like a Swiss candy bar. Bold and aggressive flavors of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate and aged port. Nice finish with a strong mochaccino aftertaste. Thick and rich palate. This beer becomes increasingly bitter as the flavors build and is a long, slow, and pleasing sipper. Strongest elements are of espresso and port."
"Overall it's not a bad beer by any means. A classic Russian Imperial Stout. Extremely drinkable. But just a little too much of the coffee bitterness for me."
"Drinkability: Not very drinkable. Mostly because of the alcohol and the richness of the beer."
"Pours a deep dark brownish black sort of color. A very quickly diminishishing tannish head tops this beer. Deep dark roasted aromas and flavors, Chocolate, coffee,and a bit of caramel, toffee, and something deep and dark which I can't put a finger on. One solid beer, it may not look the best, but it tastes like heaven."
"Drinkability  IIf you like stout, youll like this offering from North Coast. I could suck these down all night."
"Wow! Old Rasputin himself is staring me down daring me to partake in this brew. Pours pitch black with a thick dimpled head that stays around and rings the glass for eternity. Smells of roasted malts some sweetness and the alcohol is in there as well. Taste, woa! Intense bitter, almost that of espresso, sweet maltiness is intense with a warming bite of bitter and alcohol for the finish. Basically all flavors are intense, but well balanced. Not for the faint of heart. A most excellent Imperial Stout!"
"Flavor is intense with a slightly metallic chocolate and roasted barley malt profile accompanied by a strong pine hop flavor with a sweet finish. Has tons of alcohol and this definetly adds to the body by increasing the length of time the flafors linger. Very drinkable but also very intensly flavored and alcoholic, would probably go very good with dessert."
"A very well thoughout stout. I just cannot say enough about it."
"Overall a very complex stout that leaves you with a smile and a glow. Not as balanced as I would have liked (seemed a little rough around the edges) but none the less a quality Imperial Stout worth the search."
"Drinking this only confirms the fact that imp. stouts are my favorite. This was a great brew. Professionally crafted for sure. Very complex. Dark color but not as dark as expedition and with a little more head on it. The aroma seemed faded and it was not extremely thick which was it's only downfall. Other than that this was a very complex brew. Had a definite licorice taste to it and very apparent hop bitterness. A coffee taste was there and it was of strongly burnt coffee at that. Milky chocolate mixed with the coffee. It finished with a bittersweet chocolatyness that might have been the most perfect finish I have experienced. Amazing!"
"12 oz is really an ideal serving, though a pair make for a full evening."
"Dark and foreboding, like its namesake. Smell is enticing, malty and robust, with the alcohol coming through. Taste is a wee bit hoppy for my taste in an imperial stout, just wasn't expecting it. Maybe a few more of these will change my opinion on that count. A remarkable brew for sure, just not exactly what I was expecting for the style..."
"Black in color with a big tan head. Aroma is roasty and very hoppy. Taste is of roasted coffee, but is hard to detect under the bitterness from the abundant hops. This is a very hoppy imperial stout. Very enjoyable though. Not very expensive for the quality of this beer. Possible one of the best values out there."
"-F"
"I had a bottle of this on my birthday at Tony Roma's in Kennewick, WA. It was easily the only decent thing I had there, and almost made up for the crappy service. This is a BIG beer, dark and mysterious looking in a glass. The smell is of roasted malt with coffee and dark chocolate. It tastes like it smells, with a little bit of a hop zing adding sharpness and keeping the drinker from being completely overwhelmed by the malt. This would probably go great after a meal and accompanied by a good cigar. I really enjoyed drinking it but would never have more than one per sitting, as its just too much."
"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black with a dark tan finger of foam. There is only a slight bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is rich in burnt malt and caramel. The taste has a bit of roasted coffee, with a bit of a hops finish to balance. There is also a slight alcohol taste present. The mouthfeel is pretty strong and heavy. The drinkability is also fair for this massive Russian Imperial."
"This one's powerful, starting with the scary illustration of the Russian cleric himself on the label. Pours a deep brown color, with flashes of ruby where the light gets through. Head is an inch high, light brown, big and frothy. Rich aroma of chocolate, toasted malt, and alcohol. Bitter coffee flavor greets the tongue, followed by a strong alcohol finish. Not much room left for other flavors. I'm half way through the glass, and the head remains, accompanied by wavy lacing down the sides of the glass. Not for the faint of heart."
"Clear, ink-black brew forms a tan head atop fine bubbles with poor retention and OK lacing. Aroma is extremely rich...roasted sharp grain, similar in ilk to Kalamazoo stout, espresso, black patent, and a nice touch of whiskey. There is a peculiar woody dryness to the aroma. Taste is phenomenal..this is especially silken and roasted, but not burnt and thin, with a very smooth and even hoppiness. The mouthfeel is full and chewy with a dense body. Bitterness and hop flavor are in perfect balance with the malts. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The alcohol is noted in vapor, but not so in taste. This is probably one of the best examples of Russian Imperial Stout that I've had. It gets better as it warms. This is one of those beers that deserves every GABF and WBC medal it's earned. This is an uncommonly good beer."
"Quite big and complex. Roasty, licorice aroma, with more hops in the aroma than i expected, quite aromatic. The palate is quite thick and roasty, with some licorice and raisins, with quite a few hops to finish, the finish is even a bit citric. Nice bitter finish. Flavours don't quite blend however."
"I feel like I just saw a disturbing, yet brilliant movie. I acknowledge the genius but I don't know how much I truly liked it. I don't think I did but I could be wrong...."
"Originally sampled on 15 June 2002. It pours a very dark brown. The taste is full of burnt coffee & chocolate flavors, but in my opinion, they are not as nice as other imperials, like Victory Storm King, Alesmith Speedway or Stone Russian Imperial. I think it was OK, nothing special"
"This is my first North Coast Beer, so I am not quite sure what to expect in the future."
"I gotta hand it to North Coast BC, this is a busy beer to drink, lots going on if you take the time to experience it."
"Thanks to Feloniousmonk for serving this up. YUM!!!"
"This beer is definitely something to behold. It pours beautifully with a nice head that sticks around for a while. The aroma is chocolate and alcohol. While the alcohol is present in the aroma, it is well masked in the taste. It is a strong brew, worthy of drinking slow and savoring every last drop. It finishes slightly bitter, and the strength of this beer is pretty great, so I don't think I'd want more than a couple at one sitting. It would be great in the evening to sip on while unwinding."
"Old Rasputin definitely has quite a kick to it. Unbelievably smooth for a beer with such a high alcohol content. Definitely a benchmark Imperial Stout to judge others by."
"When I first opened the bottle I took a little sniff. My first impression was chocolate and alcohol. Almost like a chocolate cordial. Dark chocolatey appearance small head that started to dissolve immediately. First sip was roasty tasting with bitter chocolate notes at the back. Wow this is a smooth Stout. A little on the bitter side but malt is seeming to wrestle for advantage. It's warming up now and I start to smell coffee or espresso. This is a great stout and deserving of it's wide praise. If it weren't for the bitterness I'd give it an even higher rating. Just my opinion."
"Wow! This is a really grand stout. Wanting to finally taste this bad boy, I popped the cap on its stubby little bottle. Immediately the nose of roasted aromas comes forth, beckoning me onward. The nose portends the roasted coffee and chocolate flavors that await the drinker. The pour created a huge dark beige head over an opaque black body. The head lasts and makes lots of nice lacing. Beautiful. Flavor is here in abundance giving the drinker a full force assault on the palate. Coffee. Check. Chocolate. Check. Prunes. Check. Hop bitterness. Check. This is a tour in flavors. Great stuff with great body and feel. Wow! High ABV holds down drinkability, and there's lots of bite in this brew."
"I actually drank this at room temperature, not waiting for it to chill. It poured nice and blackish, with chocolate colored bubbles. The taste was roasted malt, coffee, carmel. It had a bold taste, the ABV mixed well, not overwhelming. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"This Russian Imperial Stout is dark/rich tar in color with a nice tan head. The lace cascades down in spotty trails. The aroma is a multi-directional bombardment of coffee mocha, malt, hops and alcohol. The ample citrus and metallic hops are almost overwhelming. A hint of apples and sherry-like flavors weave in and out as does coffee & chocolate. Sweet! Strongly alcoholic and complex. Almost too much at once with little thought to balance...maybe that was the intention to begin with?"
"Drinkability: Good for what it is...a nice, basic Imperial stout. There are much better examples to be had, but I wouldn't mind this on a cold winter night in front of the fireplace. I did expect this one to be better though..."
"Feels good in the mouth, but the sweetness is a little too dominant in the aftertaste."
"Nearly black in color (really dark, dark, dark, dark amber) with a rather diminutive khaki color head. Sensational aroma that is noticeable from a relatively great distance as it is poured. Smells of roasted malt, and smells quite sweet. Taste is malty as first, followed by a bready and roasted malt flavor. Tastes somewhat sweet as well. The body is thinner than hoped for. The alcohol is evident but, by no means, is it a problem."
"Pours out blackish black with a nice big tan head. A very nice Imperial Stout. Burnt malts rule this brew like a tzar. Hop bitter balances out the malts. This is a potent brew and complex beyond my taste. Not the best Imperial Stout out there, but a damn good one!"
"The pour yielded a 1 inch off-white head that reduced to about a 1/2 inch and stayed.As It reduced it left a solid ban of sticky lace around my glass.The color is an opaque black.Alcohol is evident on the nose and in the taste almost right away.wheeew this is strong.Long very bitter finish.Full bodied with a thick mouthfeel.Alcohol makes the mouthfeel somewhat harsh..The alcohol and the strong hop bitterness seems to hide any real flavor here.Very creamy with a rolling texture.Hints of chocolate and coffee are noted on the taste.Very malty with a dry finish."
"Overall, this beer is quite the treat on tap. Very enjoyable."
"This beer poured a dark brown black color that when held to the light, some penetrated casting a ruby glow on the edges. The head was thick, rich and creamy resembling in all aspects, even the color of the inside of a Milky Way candy bar. It left a lace behind that was sheety and lacey in different spots of the inside of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly complex, changing with each degree of temperature. I nosed coffee, dark and roasted malts, caramel, chocolates, slight fruits, some burnt chocolate, wood ash and alcohol. All smells seemed to couple up with each other and accent each other very well. The tastes were just as complex as the aromas and seemed to get only better as it warmed. I tasted bitter hops, burnt and regular coffees, roasted malts, caramel (slight), chocolates, alcohols, flowers, wood ash and some slight dark fruits. The first sip had some bitter hops to it, then an explosion of flavors all through the middle and then ended the same way it started. This is one complex beer. Big, full, creamy, lovely, luxurious and fabulous. Lives up to its name and its history behind it. The Czars would be proud."
"Pour is a super dark black with slight hints of ruby at the edges, thick tan head that fades and leaves good lacing. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, and some hops (flowery, light perfume) in the end. Flavor starts with chocolate, middle the roasted malts show through, some hops towards the end. Alcohol barely shows through at the very end when it reaches it's warmest temp. Full bodied, long lasting taste. Truly outstanding."
"North Coast brings out yet another winner. A very good brew. It almost appears, to me, to be a porter-like brew. But this beer is so much more. It offers a porter-type body and consistency complete with malted aroma and flavor. There are hints of chocolate-like sweetness, but not too overbearing. If you can find it, please seek this one out. It is well worth it. Prost!"
"Overall, an overly hoppy version of the Imperial Stout. The more it opened the more malt attempted to balance the strong hops, but in the end the sharp onslaught of hoppy bitter, fruit, and salt won out. I love me a hoppy IPA, but in my opinion an Imperial should not stray too far from its malty base."
"For such a robust beer its actually quite alright for a quiet night in by the fire.."
"Missouri Import laws don't let any craft Cali brews in, save Pyramid and Sierra Nevada thanks to St. Louis based AB. Man, I miss this beer."
"I was shocked to find 2 of my friends that do not like a lot of hops, or stouts enjoy this brew. Who would have thought. You throw together 2 things people like and then they like it."
"Pours with a massive tan colored head that slowly settles over just-short-of-opaque dark, dark ruby liquid. The nose is chock full of aromas of chocolate, malt, some coffee, and hoppy goodness. The taste is a mind-blowing blend of bitter and milk chocolates, roasted maltiness, espresso, tobacco and hop bitterness that just assaults your palate. Some alcohol is tasted in the fabulously long and satisfying finish, on par with the best Imperial Stouts & recommended to the extreme!"
"Deep, dark brown with ruby highlights. Has a light brown head that settles. The aroma that hits me first is a strong milk chocolatey aroma, followed by the roasted malt with hints of coffee. I detect alcohol at the end. The flavor is roasty, with hints of coffee. It has a very alcoholic flavor like that of rum. It is oily/buttery in texture. It finished very dry with a burnt malt and hop bitterness that stays with you. A very good warming beer."

"Note: Finally found this on tap at Brew's Cafe in Granville, OH. Even better from the tap. I could even bump up the Taste and Mouthfeel. An excellent beer."
"I'm slowly coming to the end of my Imperial stout bottles available in MN. Old Rap is black with red streaks in the light, with a smallish tan head. The aroma is roasted malt first followed by cocoa and hints of dark fruits (raisins).Chocolate and roasted coffee flavors come forth with a little sweet malt and a touch of bitterness. The body is medium-full that is nice for the style and it finishes long and roasty.Not as complex as the best but a nice drink at the end of a long cold day."
"Holy smokes this is a great stout! Poured brownish-black in color with a small dark tan head. A mellow alcohol and fruity notes make a soft aroma. This is one full-bodied stout starting with roasted coffee and creamy malt flavors. Very smooth overall and the alcohol isn't as apparent in the taste as in the aroma. At 8.9% this is very drinkable on this cold rainy afternoon. Thanks Morris729 for the sample."
"Wow, what a beer! Poured a midnight black with an amazingly dense and creamy head. Fresh roasted coffee, dark chocolate and alcohol on the nose. The taste is of heavy hops, roasted barley and alcohol. An easy sippin' brew. I haven't tasted too many IS's, but this comes close to what I would call perfect."
"Aroma is most interesting with notes of coffee, nuts and brandy. It pours thick and is darkest brown with garnet edges...beautiful canyoned mocha head...Lace like sea-foam...Rich roastiness and subtle candy sweetness that is tempered with that warm brandy-like kick. Awfully smooth gong down...amusing Blackstrap tang hovers behind wisps of hop essence as a last remark. This is simply a superior product."
"Mmmm.... this is a stout I could even session drink. Nice."
"I can die now."
"Deep red, appearing black with a rapidly fading head of light brown. Aroma of dark roasted malt with undertones of chocolate. Strong flavor of burt coffee, and a bit of chocolate. Syrupy mouthfeel, and warming effect from a decent alcohol content mean this beer will leave its mark on you. Big, in your face kind of beer. Definitly worth trying a few. When I first tried it I was not as impressed, but it really grew on me."
"Pours a black ruby color with a creamy tan colored head that fades into a nice full lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts and grains, dark fruit, licorice, and some noticeable alcohol. A thick and full-bodied brew with tastes of roasted malts, burnt coffee, sweet raisins, and bitter dark chocolate. Sweet aftertaste seems to last forever (or at least until the next sip). A very nice brew, especially in the wintertime."
"A good IMP stout. I would let it warm a little next time i drank it, i think."
"An amazing beer, but only a good Imperial Stout when tasted side by side with Storm King and Brooklyn Black Chocolate. Instense, warming and full bodied (like it ought to be) it just wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. Check out my article on my mini Imperial Stout challenge which documents more fully my impression of this beer..."
"Interesting, in that the first one tastes a little powdery, without the ""bottom end"" that a great stout (such as Speedway or Expedition) has. However, by the time I'm halfway through the second one, it's a beauty. Has a bit of that powdered chocolate taste that you find in lighter stouts, but improves as you go (ABV, warming?). Not overly bitter or dry. Overall an excellent stout, but I have had better. Glad that it's available, and I like the brewery. I wish Speedway was local. For now, I prefer Yeti."
"Rasputin is probably best remembered for his dramatic exit. Having been deemed politically expendable, he was fed poisoned wine and tea cakes by his rivals. Surviving that, he was shot several times - whereupon he attacked his assailants. He finally succumbed when bound and stuffed through a hole in the ice to drown in the River Neva. Legends that attribute his tenacity to his appetite for Russian Imperial Stout are unproven."
"A fine libation from North Coast Brewing. Excellent!!!"
"Nostrovya!"
"This is a great accompaniament for any meal, particularly rich and spicy food. I'd compliment the finish, but it never stops! The flavor sticks in your mouth forever, it seems. One of the finest stouts in all the universe."
"Black as night with a dark tan head. Head was thick,retention was good, and lacing solid. Very nice roasty aroma, strong alcohol notes on the palate. A very complex big beer that mellowed me out just right. Not really my favorite style but I sure appreciated this big beer. I did like that the 8%ABV made this more drinkable than some of the 10% Imperials I have tried. Great brew!"
"I'll state it from the outset (as I have before), I have problems with beers that move to the ""cloying sweet"" taste, and this one does. Maybe it'll be something I accomodate in time, but for now it's a distraction. However, it doesn't take away from many other fine attributes of this beer. Very good head considering the abv, with nice lacing almost to the end. Really nice red/mahogany color when held to the light. Nice complex flavor and aroma that leans toward caramel as much, if not more than, roasted malt. It's the heavy fruitness that moves towards excessive sweetness that I struggle with, but I'm working on appreciating it. Very well hopped leaving a very long dry finish. And as others have said, a well hidden alcohol content. Mouthfeel was just a tad thin. Somehow I'll manage to get through the rest of my bottles."
"The beer pours as ""Dark as the inside of a cow", monumental and frothy chocolate head with tons of lace. The nose simply reeks of toasted grains, chocolate, and caramel. Big sweet malt start, top ""Don't get any fuller than this", finish is hop spicy, minimal acidity, droughty chocolate malt aftertaste. Just cannot remember having a better ""Imperial than this"". A must try for all ""Lovers of the Dark side", and if your a ""Stout"" lover, ""Baby your ship just came in""."
"This is one great Imperial Sweet roasted malt aroma, thick dark creamy head,black in color, nice taste of plums, chocolate and coffee, not over sweetness. just very tasty, I like this awesome brew, well done."
"Verry good drink whish they had it where I live. "" Mabey I'll Move""!"
"Pours opaque black with a slight reddish tinge. Small head indicates the low carbonation common in this style. Aroma is of chocolate and roasted character but a little short of perfect. Taste is on the bitter side. Some chocolate. I must say I enjoy Bell's Expedition Stout more it has some fig or prune tastes that add another layer of complexity to the mix. High alcohol is present and noticeable. I did enjoy this at night on the first day of our first snow that stuck. I did the the atmosphere right."
"I'm glad I picked up a four pack of this and re-evaluated this selection. I think it has ""cult"" status for a reason. It's a cold night here in VA, and a few of these will warm me up the way I like."
"I didn't give it a higher rating in appearance, because I like it when Imperial Stouts pour like syrup. This one poured just slightly thinner than expected. Excessively bitter to get a higher drinkability."
"My first Imperial & I purchased this as my first offering of ohio's new apv law. At 8.9% this was a great sample of things to come. This brew was stunning for me as soon as I cracked the cap. The scent and aroma take-over to kick-start the taste-buds. Pour this black, low carbon stout and get a half-inch head that settles to a film but has enough in it to lace well, thicker than one might expect.The taste of dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans with a not shy alcohol presence. The strength I think smooths this brew to the point of creamy. Enjoyed this-one on a cold rainy night.....Perfect!!"
"750 ml. Millennium Edition bottle. Pours jet black with a creamy, tan head. Hops, alcohol and coffee are present in the nose. Coffee-like taste presents itself along with a generous dose of hops, malt and alcohol. Mouthfeel is rather oily and fitting for the style. Quite smooth overall. This imperial stout certainly has its warming effects at 8.9% ABV. An impressive creation from North Coast."
"Dark dark dark brown, not black.  Roasted alcoholic nose.  Roasted malt flavor followed by a strong alcohol and hop bite.  A very good imperial, true to the form.  Storm King still is King of the Imperials."
"This beer pour almost black dark amber color. It formed a nice dark tan foamy heal that left some nice circular lace. The aroma was of malt and coffee. The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate. The body was a bit thinner than the few others I have tried. The finish was of a burnt bitter style."
"The beer is as bit rough on the tongue, but I'm not sure this is even a fault.  Coffee-like flavors of malt with a surprisingly high hop bitterness.  Alcohol warming sensation and a nice, sweet aftertaste.  Full bodied in the extreme.  Approach this beer with respect!"
"Pours a dark coffee color with deep garnet if held up to light, but who cares ;-)...and has a dirty tan head.  Smells of faint coffee and chocolate mildy roasted come through and blended nicely.  Taste of burnt coffee and a nice balance of hops tapers into a nice malty roast that is delicious!  Very nice balance of flavors that ends with a dry hoppy taste on the tail.  The mouthfeel is a medium body and just mildly creamy.  Awesome brew!  Cheers!"
"After a glass of Lion Stout...this has a warmer tone to the color of the head and warmer, woodier aromas as well. The liquid is suprisingly light in color. Raw cocoa and coffee beans, like kahlua, with a little green bean, pine nut, and cherry jam on the nose. Now licorice and cough syrup...Rich, round, sweet chocolate fudge. Burned chocolate cookies. A nice assertive bitterness on the medium-long finish."
"Approaching black in hue, w/ trace deep brilliant garnet when held to light. Dark tan head slowly settles into a tight lace leaving layer. Light chocolate and butterscotch, w/ mild roasted barley and nuttiness. Subdued vinous alcohol soaked dark fruit. Not as delectable in aroma compared to other imperials. Sharp roasted barley bitterness hits the palate initially, then is ensued by a wave of milk chocolate sweetness and prune like fruitiness. Mild sherry notes and black licorice emerge mid palate then are rendered abrupt by assertive hop bitterness. Hop flavor, although overshadowed by the malt profile, combines w/ the fruitiness to leave a pleasant citrus rind undertone. Fairly light in body for an imperial, but the dextrinous mouthfeel does not reflect that. Finishes w/ a slightly smoky, lingering bittersweet chocolate flavor. Old Rasputin is delicious, but falls a bit short aromawise. The rich malt character isn't represented in aroma. It lacks the complete package of richness, but is highly enjoyable nonetheless."
"After searching for this beer for 10 months, I finally got my hands on a 4-pack while on vacation.  It was worth the wait.  This is a wonderful Imperial Stout.  Nice dark color, almost black with a beautiful tan head.  The aromas from this beer are almost as good as the taste: coffee, chocolate, malt.  I savored each sip of each beer, spending almost an hour with each. The alcohol is noticable, but not overpowering.  But I wouldn't choose Old Rasputin for a night of drinking.  It's more of a beer for a relaxing evening.   If this beer is readily available in your area, drink it regularly.  If not, stock up when you find it.  I'm ready to make the 6 hour drive to get some more."

"Typical appearance for any rich stout or imperial stout. Deep black with dark tan head. Head wasn't very large, but not overly small either. Aroma is has the burnt chocolately aroma typical of the style, but it's in competition with the sharp citric peel of the hops. Seemed very balanced between the two. Some sweetness in the aroma as well. The flavor is lighter than I expected. There's a thin burnt bitterness and citrus peel flavor (although sharper like lemon or grapefruit than fuller orange peel flavor). This is all backed up by by the rich malt, but less so than Expedition or World Wide. It was also less sweet than those others. Not quite as overwhelming as the others and a bit more drinkable."
"Midnight black with a creamy tan head....the nose on this beer is outstanding...I just want to smell it and smell it and smell it, but I figured I'd better get around to drinking it too.  The nose is very heavy on the hops, with a wonderful blend of spicy, earthy, herbal hops..some chocolate on the nose too..  The hops shine through on the buds as well, but there is an excellent chocolate bite to it also...like dark semi-sweet chocolate..Body is thick, but not over thick like Bell's Expedition...this is pretty drinkable in my opinion...the only drawback to me is there is some alcohol taste evident..It finishes with the hop bite, but also with a smooth butterscotchy texture...I really like this one...rates right up there with the best.."
"Dark brown, almost black body.  Thick brown head, with excellent retention.  Aroma thick with roasted malt, raisin, and molasses with undertones of the 8.9% alcohol coming through.  Good flavor, roasted malt dominates with a nice bitter finish.  Alcohol apparent in flavor, but less so than in the smell.  Thick beer, but not really heavy or oily.  This is a good choice for an after dinner/late evening relaxation beer."
"Slightly thin pour (not as dense as a Bell's Expedition), nice dark brown head -- 1/4 inch. Very dark color but does let light through at the bottom of the pint glass. Nice fruity aroma, definite notes of vanilla. Full-bodied mouthfeel but not quite coating. Alcoholic, but not excessively so. Lots of bittersweet chocolate flavors, a little java and raisin. It can come off as showing excessive artificial blueberry flavors. Not as complex as Storm King. Partly bitter finish, not bad, mouthfeel brings down my drinkability score. Obviously a decent quality beer, just a definite step below some other Imperials. Nice smell."
"Big and bold. The taste lingers on. A favorite of mine. Introduce your friends to Rasputin. The alcohol doesn't over power the flavor!"
"Pours a black color, with a cardboard colored head. There is raisin, malt and alcohol aromas on the nose. All of the same on the palateheavy alcohol through out, raisins, bit of chocolate, and rum maybe. Very nice mouth feelOverall a very good imperial, balanced well."
"(12oz. bottle) Awesome black opaque liquid. Rocky tan head. A truly remarkable appearance.  A thin creamy layer of foam lasts, leaving residual lace. Huge aroma of chocolate, burnt molasses, ripe prunes and alcohol.  Perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness...doesn't possess that sticky sort of sweetness. Just of multitude of flavors happening here; chocolate malt, prunes/raisins, coffee with a welcome alcohol warming sensation in the belly. A delicious, outstanding treat."
"This beer grew on me. Pours deep dark black with maybe a hint of purple shade ? Nice big tan foamy head, faded into a thin head but fell down the glass nicely. Smells of roasted malt, toffee, coffee. Big roasted coffee taste, strong bitter finish that stays on your tongue.The taste expanded as the beer warmed, don't let the first sip, get you down.  The alcohol makes it taste thinner than other stouts. Cool bottle and label. I bought this based on other beer advocates reviews. It is very good."
"Pours jet black.  Medium brown head that dissipates quickly.  Beautiful roasty aroma.  Also get a bit of smoke on the nose.  There's some burnt malt tastes.  Very strong bitterness.  I love that in an Imperial.  The IBU must be approaching 100 in this brew.  Incredible malt load balances nicely with the hops.  A bit of alcohol dangles on the tongue nicely.  This is everything I look for in an Imperial Stout.  Not as viscous as Bell's Expedition, but tremendous in its own right.  One of my all time favorites.  This is in the elite category of microbrewed Imperials that I have tried (along with Bell's Expedition and Rogue)."
"Man, I really love Imperial Stouts and this is a real good one.  It is real dark with only the slightest hint of light getting through but kind of a thinish head.  For some reason I couldn't get a whole lot of aroma.  What I do get is dark chocolate and roasted malts with a slight hop undertone.  A different taste for an imperial stout but not one that I am necessarily against.  Huge amounts or dark chocolate and roasted malts start on the tongue.  This is then followed a nice cascade hop flavor.  The bitterness of the hops is nicely balanced with the sweetness of the chocolate and a faint dark fruit presence.  I can't find even the slightest hint of alcohol.  The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit tangy which leaves me wanting more of it.  I would have to say that the hops balance to the huge body of this beer makes it exceptionally drinkable.  This is one kick ass beer.  One of these days I am going to have to make a pilgrimage to California to see all these amazing breweries in person."
"Price-wise, though, this hits the spot, and its widespread availability is a bonus."
"This is a top-notch beer in my book, and damn near perfect. A very close second to Victory's Storm King, which is perfect."
"Pitch black, thick dark tan head.  Extremely rich roasted malt and alchohal aromatics.  Thick roasted malts, burnt chocolate, coffee flavors penetrate deeply on the palate.  Creamy and rich mouthfeel.  Complex and complete.  Probably should give a 2 or 3 for drinkability because it's so strong, but like Stone's Arrogant Bastard, I refuse.  This beer is one of a kind."
"Said a prayer to St. Stephen to ward off Rasputin.  Spicy malt/hop aroma, wonderful roasted malt flavor, sweet malt aftertaste with alcohol on the finish.  Worth $2.50 a bottle and I'm a cheapskate."
"This was a very pleasant surprise.  My wife (who can't drink beer) picked this up for me while out shopping.  The first few drinks seemed somewhat bitter and strongly alcoholic.  However, I stuck with it and really grew to like it.  A bit of sweetness came through after a few sips.  If it doesn't speak to you at first, give it a few minutes."
"One hell of a cult classic, certainly a kick back and relax beer. I love when winter comes so I can enjoy these beers ot their fullest."
"Now this is a stout.  Black as night with a firm brown head.  Flavors abound -- rum, raisins and a strong hit of alcohol.  A perfect nightcap in a brandy snifter."
"One hell of a good beer.  This is a top of the line imperial stout - it has plenty of kick and a deep full flavor."
"I had this on tap at their brewpub.  Alcohol was just the first thing you notice.  I could sit back all night and drink this, of course then I would never get up"
"For a Russian imperial, this stout was actually a little more mild than I expected.  Lots of chocolate, and a hint of vanilla in the finsih.  Tremendous depth of flavor.  The mouthfeel was surprisingly light for the heft of the beer."
"This is a wonderful beer, the mouth is flooded with so much flavor that you almost trip off line.  This is great on a winters night by a soft fire, some fine chocolate and the one you love.  One special brew, a true masterpiece."
"Great roastyness with an appropriate alcohol presece."
"Very alcoholic...I know thats what an imperial stout is all about , but for me it ruined the taste a bit...reminded me a lot of guinness with a kick...I'll stick with Mackeson"
"Very complex, and true to its style. Well worth the $3.00 (+/-) paid for the single bottle, and I'd definitely buy it again. Not a beer for the faint of heart, but rather barley wine lovers and chocolate fanatics."
