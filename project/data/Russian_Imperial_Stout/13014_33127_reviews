"EBF Sample -- not for me. Way too boozy for me, too hot on the finish with strong astringency. I was really looking forward to this one, but it fell flat. Look and smell were fine, but I didn't feel like it was well integrated with the bold flavors and interesting nuances I was hoping for. Will try again, but won't seek this one out."

"Tasted at Extreme beer fest. Awesome beer. Quite a treat, sweet, roasted maltiness, chocolate, balsamic vinegar, bitter middle and coffer finish."

"Shared at Hunahpuâ€™s day 2014 in the massive bottle share, poured into souvenir taster. Opaque black body with a resilient tan cap that leaves webbing all over the little glass. Aroma features roasted malt, coffee, raisin, unsweet chocolate, dried cherries, and a surprising bit of soy and citrus. Taste is roasty malt and dried fruit sweetness, coffee and cocoa bitterness. On the lower end of the full body spectrum, thick and creamy texture, soft but appropriate carbonation, warming boozy finish."

"This was the 2013 Chicago distribution when Surly came into the market.  Opened for a bottle share, smelled and looked great but the tastes really was not exceptional at all."

"O: A real treat. It's not my favorite Russian Imperial, but it's really damn good - and a very unique experience to drink. I'll look to get a younger bottle and drink it without aging to compare. Highly recommended."

"2012 vintage I have had every vintage of this brew. Every single one has been stellar. Do yourself a favor and find some. This is an awesome Russian Imperial Stout"

"O 4.75 - always has been a favorite beer of mine. Apparently they're now barrel aging it starting in 2014, but in my opinion it doesn't need to be. It's phenomenal the way it is. Maybe they should keep both options open."
""
""
""

"Better than the previous year and just barely beat out by BCBS '12 in my opinion.  Have a few bottles for trade.  Cheers!"

"Picked this up in a great trade with Evan!  2013 vintage.  Pitch black pour with a gorgeous two finger caramel-colored head with great retention and decent lacing.  The nose is dark and roasty with hints of cocoa, dark fruits, espresso, licorice, and a subtle vinous character.  The taste is earthy and vinous and pretty much mirrors the nose. Hints of cocoa, espresso, licorice, dark chocolate, black pepper, dark fruits, leather, tobacco, port wine, and smoke. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. Overall, definitely didn't live up to the hype.  Pretty average and overrated..."

"Bottom Line: 2013 Darkness is one heck of a beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Darkness pours a bold black color with a big tan head.  There is a weaker aroma, with sweet date aromas.  Their are big creamy flavors, big sweet and dry fruit flavors, nice noticeable warmth from the alcohol.  Big bold flavors.  Overall its a big bold beer, lots of fruit flavors, on the sweeter side."

"The beer in the front has roasted malt, chocolate, and slight coffee flavors. The mouthfeel throughout is actually only medium plus, without being as full as other imperial stouts. The beer also begins with a heavy amount of sweetness. On the finish, there is a heavy hoppiness. It's a bittering that is still tannic, earthy, and drying."

"Vaguely remember drinking this at Dark Lord Day 2014. While waiting in line to purchase my allottment of DL, a kind DLD go'er shared some Darkness. From what I remember, strong roasted, chocolate malts power through the nose and the taste had more body than most RIS' I've had prior. Delicious and I will try to seek out again for better review."

"O: Bold and full of complexity, this huge RIS lives up to the reputation. The sweetness isn't nearly as intense as Dark Lord and the hop character comes through slightly (even after a year in cold storage)."

"I love this beer! Poured 2013 (Brewcifer) vintage into a surly tulip glass. Moderate caramel head dissipated to thin layer of bubbles. The beer is very thick and viscous. The nose has complex scents of molasses, chocolate, roasted malts, licorice, and lingering vanilla. The taste follows the nose very well with pronounced dark chocolate, malt, and vanilla flavors accented by oak. Slight coffee bitterness, and even some hop flavors come through toward the end. Fantastic."

"Pours black as pitch with a huge two finger medium tan head. Excellent retention and plenty of lacing. Tons of dark fruit notes, dark chocolate, and boozy alcohol on the nose. Opens with dark chocolate, bold black cherries, and plum and prune notes. Molasses and raisins midpalate. Finishes with some dark roast coffee, boozy alcohol, piney hops, resin, and continued mixed dark fruit notes. Smooth and silky huge, full body with somewhat syrupy on the finish. Low to low/moderate carbonation. I've found every vintage of Darkness to be excellent and the 2013 vintage is no different. One of the better brews to be found in the style."

"2013 vintage (Brewcifer). Poured from a wax-topped bomber into a snifter, the beer is jet black, almost oily, with a thin, filmy, frothy half-inch head that settles into a filmy surface coating. Nose of black strap molasses, licorice, coffee, baker's chocolate, woody notes, and hints of vanilla. Flavors of rich, heavy molasses and smooth dark chocolate forward. Perfectly balanced. Oaky highlights, with vanilla notes, too. Roasted characteristics throughout, with coffee bitterness in and out of the palate, also. Very layered palate and deep throughout. Velvety smooth body, with a chocolate bitter and roasted aftertaste. Wow! The finish is slick, smooth, and fairly heavy on the linger of rich and heavy. Great beer! Wow!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich, thick, full-bodied with an appropriate heaviness, this beer hits the mark. It has just enough alcoholic heat to warm without thinning with a viscosity coating the tongue. The finish is semi-dry, some leafy hops and ultra-smooth chocolate easing the finish to linger beautifully."

"O - Outstanding and seek out."

"Pours pitch black with a thick mocha head. Great lacing.  So much happening on the nose - lots of dark chocolate, vanilla and stone fruit with hints of roasted malt and smoke. Outstanding aroma!  Palate follows the nose, dark chocolate, vanilla, cherries, and dark fruity notes. The malt and smoky notes are even more apparent on the tongue. Body is ridiculously smooth with a medium body and light carbonation. Overall, if there are any faults in this stout I can't discern them. This is not only the best non-BA stout I've had, it's the finest example of a Russian Imperial Stout I've had, period!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pitch black pour with a beautiful one finger head and perfect brown head with a sticky lace retention. So much chocolate and cherry in the aroma and taste. There's a beautiful coffee and caramel finish in the taste. Full body and low carbonation with a silky smooth finish. This beer is absolutely sublime. It's a chocolate coffee marshmallow dream. The 2 years created a perfect symmetry. Epic!"

"O-well-rounded stout, just a little on the sweet side for me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I just can't do these beers anymore. It is just a big diabetes bomb of sugar and alcohol. Seriously lacking in complexity and character to round out the malt and add balance."
"A few months later I had the opportunity to try 2010 and 2011 Darkness at a Rare Beer Fest. For me, the two year old 2011 was the best beer I have had to date at a rating of 4.9 and the 2010 might have just been slightly over the hill at 4.6."

"This is a great beer for sure. I tend to prefer BA stouts but this is a great sipping one as well. Drinks heavy and thick."

"Awesome job from Surly; I hope this one isn't too hard to get next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I can't think of a better RIS that I have had. This is an incredible beer, but the price may keep me from obtaining more than one a year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is amazing. all the flavors blend so great together I can not wait to see how this ages."
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: I always thought of Darkness as a rather unique and inventive take on the style as it was assertively bitter and always had a distinctive piney hop flavor to me, however this bottle changes everything. It's incredibly rich, smooth and balanced. The complexity is astounding and this is deserving of all accolades. Perhaps there is some truth to the notion that the recent distribution was slightly different than the release day batch, but whatever was in my bottle was superb and I want more."
""
""
""
""
"Very good RIS - not the best I have had, but certainly something worth getting a few bottles of."
""
""
"o: First time having Darkness. Worthy of the hype imo. Only ding might be the aroma which was rather subdued. Mouthfeel is top notch. No reason to age this as it was great fresh."
""

""
""

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is just under full, with an excellent level of carbonation. Overall, a very good non barrel aged stout. It gives up a bit of complexity but is very well put together, and has an excellent sweet/bitter balance. Definitely a recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A wonderful treat. Wish this wasn't such a rare gem. Not my favorite style, but enjoyed this beer with the best of them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really smooth and enjoyable to drink. A great balance of flavours and something that I would drink a lot if it was regularly available to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a great beer. What I especially enjoyed is how the roasted flavors managed to meld and balance the sweetness and fruit flavors. Unlike many RISs, this brew is not a complete char bomb or a soy sauce bomb, but a great balance between the two styles. The flavors are intense and complex. Perhaps the best non-barrel stout I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - more fruity (and less chocolate/coffee) than I expected from a RIS, also sweeter than expected, still quite delicious"
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious surprise in my last trade with Pintofbrown. Pretty damn amazing RIS which I feel the hype is deserved. Cheers!"
""
""
"World class beer. One draft is not enough! Cheers!"

"I have yet to open my 2013 but I did have a few bottles of the prior years. Very distinct in it's quality. Nose was great, mouthfeel was fantastic, and the flavor was over the top. Chocolate, raisin, coffee, hops, fruity, toasty and rich goodness. Warming alcohol, but little smell or flavor, not solvent-like other big RIS's. Just a great experience. I had my first few fresh, can't wait to open my 2013....don't know how long I can wait! Surly never fails to amuse me."
""
""
""
"Overall, I was very disappointed with the results. While I am now glad I traded away my older bottles, I was expecting something a little more 'badass' in terms of a vintage showdown. Oh well, maybe my bottle just didn't age properly. Either way, the fresh bottle was outstanding and on par with my favorite RIS...Stone RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"edit: some age makes this epic, just cracked a 2011, and was amazed how much more mature and integrated and evolved the beer was from the fresh version, it really is one of the best in the game, with a chocolate and raisin complex coming to the fore. improving a few scores to reflect that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Surly comes through once again with a fantastic stout that lives up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Going to call this one one of the better RIS's out there. Definitely beats Dark Lord in terms of one-day brewery-only release event beers."
""
""
"This is incredibly tasty and overall is very drinkable. Dark fruits and cherried are very present and it is overall sweet, but is balanced well. This isn't the roastiest stout, but it is one of my all time favorites."
""
""
"Over all It was a great beer, I can not wait to try this 2013 with a couple years on it, hopefully it will get a little sweeter."
""
""
""
"***I had CBS on Canada Day '13, and now I've had Darkness as my 666th beer... I am a beer nerd."
"2013 Brewcifer bottle, lucky to get 2 of these.  Unfortunately drank it out of Days Inn disposable coffee cup.  Shared with friends before Black Crowes concert.  I don't rate many beers but this one deserves praise.  Appearance is dark and chewy, difficult to say from Styrofoam cup.  Smells awesome, chocolate, raisins, hot spicy rum.  This tastes great and the best RIS I have ever had.  Can't wait to try the second bottle after it ages."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-I was really happy to try Darkness, any geek should be. I found myself having a distant respect for the beer rather than a full fledged lust for it. It's well crafted, unique and yummy but it didn't click with me like others have. I still really enjoyed this brew and would love to try an older vintage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I know I am buying into the hype, but this is a really, really good beer. Definitely a must try."

"We were able to find ours in a hole-in-the-wall liquor store in St. Paul. Only sold one per customer. Feeling lucky that we could enjoy this delicious beer--if you're lucky enough to find it, you should definitely pick it up! Not quite a perfect score, but darn good."

"would definitely get again"

"Final Thoughts: Had all but given up trying to get a bottle of Darkness. Pricy at $25 a bomber but worth it for a once a year release. Great example of the style. Would I drink it again? Yes."
"Really can't imagine a better RIS. I don't even think barrel aging would do this any benefit. It's just perfect the way it is. Only thing I could maybe point out is the sweetness, but compared to Dark Lord this is easy drinking in that regard. Smooth. Chocolate, toffee, roasty, smooth smooth smooth. I aged mine until it was over a year old. The abv at 10% is hardly noticeable. Well done Surly!"
""
""
""
"It's kind of rich to be drinking 24oz of it all at once, but the flavor is good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with a substantial mocha-colored head that dissipates pretty quickly. Nose is dried fruit, toffee and malt. Mouth is full and silky, with lots of candy-like sweetness up front, then some dates, raisins, chocolate, caramel, with a bittersweetness fading out on the back end. Alcohol is well hidden, with only a slightly detectable warmth near the finish."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is, you guessed it, perfect. Full bodied because the flavor lingers for awhile, but it tastes so good you wished it would last even longer. This beer is perfectly smooth, with a nice carbonation level and no bite from the alcohol or carbonation, slightly tickles the tongue though. Starts sweet with a nice clean, fresh bitter finish. Crazy drinkable, any stout lover or beer lover could finish off a bottle no problem. A sipper, but dangerous enough to drink faster than you might intend. Thanks N-Dawg for bringing this one to me! This beer really has all the perfect qualities one would want in a beer and blends them together."

"Overall this is one of my favorite imperial stouts, despite being a little too much on the sweet size."
""
"The taste was a typical imperial stout type of taste (fruit, malts, chocolate, roastiness) but the hops and roasted malts overpowered things for me a little bit. I could see this being very good with some age on it but the 2012 vintage with almost a year on it was a little too harsh for me."

"Its always a great thing when a beer lives up to the hype and this one did exactly that. I wasn't expecting the high levels of hops but I loved it, for a fresh big stout the booze is nearly invisible. This one could age for years but great fresh if you like a hop bomb"

"O- This was a great stout that I really enjoyed drinking however I'm not sure if I'd say its one of my favorites. The overall flavor could have been richer instead of the cocoa powder taste. I would love to compare a fresh version of this."

"Got in trade. 2012 version with a wereworlf and red wax cap. Pours deep black with a big frothy light brown head. Big hop aroma with plenty of roasty notes to go along with a bit of sweet molasses. Flavor is very much molasses with unexpextedly strong hop flavor. Wow the balance here is excellent. Cherry and fig mixed with bittersweet chocolate coming in. Medium mouthfeel with thickness that goes with the impy. Relatively easy drinking for the style. This is unique and really good!"

"O - A killer RIS that lives up to its reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: Had a chance to drink some of the 2007 and it to be less sweet and cloying than all the other vintages of this beer. The hops had faded, yes, but the sweet flavor was balanced by some alcohol qualities that made it much more palatable than the other vintages. Probably the best of vintage of this beer, but Darkness is still better as fresh as possible."
""
"Vintage 2011: This poured out as a deep black color with a brown head on top. There is a nice retention with a good lacing as well. The smell of the beer is of dark berries with deep roasted malts chocolate and subtle vanilla and soy. The taste is the beer is really nice, bold roasted malts, some smoke and bit of dark chocolate, there is a touch of saltiness in there too. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with a creamy body and subtle carbonation. Overall it's excellent. I had been curious how it would compare to Dark Lord and this is much better in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"This edition was strong on the nose and palate, I remember wincing on the first sip. Deep bitter cocoa and molasses with hints of vanilla and clove. It went down smooth and I was sad that my 2 oz pour was only. Rich coffee flavors with layers of toffee mirrored by sweet caramel and a tar-like drip...not perfect, but close enough."

"Enjoyed a 2012 vintage with a friend after letting it age for 2 months, this is the second best imperial stout I've ever had imo, only falling short to Abyss. Really excited about the 2011 I've got in the cellar, going to have to think of an excuse to open that some day. Cheers"

"O: 5 - I never though that I would try this beer considering that it is only released one day/year in Brooklyn Center, MN with very limited local distribution but thank goodness for the CBC 2013 in Washington D.C.; like all of Surly beers, this one lives up to the extreme hype and is overall the most complex RIS that I have ever tried; I have never tried Dark Lord or Marshal Zhukov but I cannot imagine it being better than this"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.25 - Good. The nose is fantastic and so I suppose there's just some disappointment when the body does not exactly follow suit. There's a round sweetness and a woody dry bitterness, which make an interesting pair, but it wants something more to elevate it, and a stiffer backbone to offset some of the sweetness. Still, it is somewhat unique. Probably not enough that I'd trade for it again, however. The hunt continues."
""
"Looked like a stout should: dark brown-black pour, with a small tan head that sank to a ringlet and left some splashes of lace on the glass. Aroma was typical as far as stouts go, dark roasty malts, some cocoa bitterness, with notes of herbal hops and anise. Same story on the palate, dark malts, dark chocolate, herbal hops, light woody notes, and a touch of dark fruits and licorice; slightly lingering resiny bitterness in the aftertaste. Good, but not very full in flavor like a good stout should be. I'm not really understanding the hype over this beer...you get about the same effect as you would from a Storm King, and I can get that off the shelf any day of the week. Not full-bodied, but on the heavier side of medium. A decent stout, but pretty standard overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"the beer pours jet black with a thin tan head. the nose is caramel, alcohol, bandaid (subtle) & sugar. the taste is definitely all chocolatey malt forward with booze. the mouhfeel is definitely full bodied rich chocolatey stout, but easy drinking and smooth, very slight bitterness. this beer is definitely an approachable, drinkable ris that most people would enjoy"

"Whoa, what a beer! Had this as part of a 30+ mini-whale share that I went to. It was the second beer I tried, and ended up being the best of the night for me. Appearance and mouthfeel are good, but smell and taste were both awesome! Definitely on the sweet side for a RIS, but still well-balanced. And it's surprisingly non-BA, as all those wonderful barrel flavors seem to come through as it warms. Would have this beer again, and again, and again."
""
""
""
""
""

"2012 Vintage shared thanks to Kevin R... Thanks! I liked this one even a bit more than the 2011 that Mike cracked with me earlier this year. Sweetness was evident, yet more controlled. Hoppier, with a better balance of ashy bitterness. More roasty, more drinkable, and even more enjoyable, even though I already like it in the first place. Great brew."

"Overall: This beer is amazing fresh and I certainly have some in my cellar for aging, can't wait to see how these develop. If this got the barrel aged treatment it might just be the best in beer in the world."

"M: Full bodied. Not crazy vicous."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer was everything I could have hoped it would be. After the first two categories, I thought this might be my first perfect 20/20. Unfortunately, it was not to be due to the slightly imbalanced taste and the almost complete absence of carbonation. Still, this is worth the hype. I cannot wait to try the bottle I currently have aging in the cellar. Things can only go up from here, as I assume it will level out the sweetness. 19/20"

"Overall, a superb beer. Lived up to my expectations, and might have even surpassed them a bit. Another excellent offering from Surly."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, not only is it an excellent stout to drink for as long as you can handle it, it seems to have held up quite well for over 3 years."
""
""
""
"I nearly cut my finger off trying to get that red plastic off of the top of the bottle. That wouldn't been a good way to start. Once I finally got the top popped, the beer klugged out of the opening like motor oil. It's nearly black as coal and just as opaque. Except for the bottom edge of the glass, which when enough light does pass through, glints of cola brown are noted. The Irish coffee (not the cocktail--actual coffee in Ireland) foam-colored head is a stubborn, sticky, foamy one that certainly contributes to the sexiness of the beer. The nose is nice, but, surprisingly, not strong. Chocolate liqueur, lactose, mild smoky notes, and ripe banana are all present. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Creamy, smooth, viscous, and delightful. It never really dries up either, not even on the finish. I love the flavor of this one! Milk chocolate out of the gate. Alcohol shows up about midway and keeps things warm even after the finish. But the alcohol doesn't take away from the beer. If anything it helps temper the sweetness. This is reminiscent of the chocolate bourbon balls my Grandma used to make around Christmas time, only quite a bit less boozy. My Grandma could get a little carried away on the bourbon in her recipe. Dark ripe fruit, somewhere between a sweet cheery and a date, emerges late. It amazes me that more aroma doesn't blast out of this thing given the big flavor. This is a really nice Imperial Stout. One of the best that I've ever had."
""
"O: Very interesting. Lots of big flavors, although fruit is not my favorite in a stout. Great beer though!"

"I'd like to end by offering a wholly subjective ranking of 2007-2012 Darkness, each of which I have had multiple times, and each of which I have had this past year. My order of preference is: 2007, 2009, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2008. Capsule reviews: 2007 was sublime. 2011 did not age well -- think soy sauce. 2008 was too sweet. 2009 was great fresh, as well as every year since. 2010 was super-drinkable fresh, and is still good, and 2012 is too young to know where it's headed."

"O: Beer like this donâ€™t come around to often; this is a stout the likes of which I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll find anywhere else. To be honest, it was hard to get acclimated to the Darkness at first (probably because of the hop presence), but I truly enjoyed every sip. This is worthy of a full day of celebration, for sure."

""
""

""
""
"O - I recall Darkness having one of the hoppiest aromas of any Russian Imperial Stout I've encountered while being sweeter than all get-out. Suffice it to say, age has done this beer an incredible favor; rounding out some of the rougher edges for an insanely crave-able, lustful, sinfully delicious stout. For every bottle you hoped would age well and failed, Darkness makes up for, rewarding your patience with big dividends. This chocolaty, roasted malt-rich brew exceeds expectations of greatness and completely satisfies."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really interesting RIS. It really throws out alot of big flavors and has alot of complexity in the malt profile of this beer. I appreciate that this beer is fairely different and unique from many other RIS in its respective beer style ""family"". I prefer less hops in my big stouts and this one is over run by piney hops on the back end of this beer. The hops distract too much from the malt profile in my opinion. The mouthfeel is simply amazing especially for a non-barrel aged beer."
"750mL 2010 vampire ed courtesy of beeranddogs. Pour pour is clear ruby to deep brown looking opaque black in the glass. A massive mocha head erupts with infinite retention and bit webby, sticky lace. Aroma isnâ€™t all the massive or even pleasant: salty olives, brine, lots of wood. As it warms the only thing that comes through is oxidized red apple slices. The taste is dry oak, spicy oak, slightly hot alcohol, sweet molasses and prunes. Palate is very soft, not too syrupy, ending somewhat chalky and powdery. Comes across as very basic and mediocre. How this is in the Top 100 and Midnight Sun Berserker is not baffles me. There are just so many better imperial stouts out there. 12/12/2010 6/5/7/4/13=3.5"
"I believe this was the first time I've had this outside of a festival setting - 12oz pour in a snifter, ebony body, light tan lace. Definitely sticky-sweet and less hopped than I recall from past years, but still not without some nice pine resin traces. Rich, decadent and very smooth. A good RIS, but one whose legacy seems to have faded..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink up, pussies. This one is best fresh."
"Overall: I would be willing to try it again if it comes in to my possession, but it will be drank immediately instead of giving it the opportunity to age and develop. Sometimes cellaring works well and you get a whole new product, and sometimes, you get disappointed. Sipper, with big alcohol, may be tough to get through the whole bottle on my own, but I'll figure out how to make do."
"Absolutely the sing most perfect beer. It is highly coveted and very tradeable. The artwork and collectability increases its value."
""
"O: my favorite non-barrel aged stout so far. Just amazing combination of flavors and smells made this stand out on a night when we had some amazing stouts."
""
""
"O: Its up there with Stone IRS but nothing too special. Its a great stout regardless."
"Overall an impressive imperial stout. I can't think of a non-barrel aged imperial stout with more going on that this."
"Overall: Have to say i'm a bit disappointed by this one. Compared to DL, this one is not as good. Flavors were good but for me, not worth the hype IMO. I'll take a DL instead."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: My first surly brew ever and I am too letdown to discuss the mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid, very solid. Great flavor, but the body ultimately falls a little short given the intense malts of the beer. I've tried it at beer fests and in a blind stout tasting. It comes out just over the middle of the pack. Incredible flavor."
"Slightly better than I remember. It's still overly sweet, but it's quite tasty overall. There is more smoke and tobacco than I remember. Maybe it's just more interesting than the first bottle. Scores upgraded slightly (taste and overall bumped up .25)."

"Bottle at Iceland super tasting â€™10 vampire bottle. Nice dark pour with a slight ruby tint, creamy tan head. Tons of licorice, molasses, port and dark fruits (plums) dominate the aroma. Very sweet taste, super fruity prune flavors, honey-molasses sweetness. Soft carbonation suits this one nicely, very silky and heavily bodied. One of my favourite IS."
"O: 4"
"O - A great non-barrel aged stout. There were times that I noticed barrel like qualities. Overall another great brew from Surly."
""
""
""
"M - Full body. Thick and viscous. Light carbonation."

""

"A somewhat hoppy, though balanced big stout. It's probably not worth the sticker price, all things considered, but always a fun bottle to share no matter the time or place."

"(originally reviewed: 06-07-2011)"
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is complex as hell. Thick roasted tries to come out, but the bitterness (reminiscent of coffee and extremely bitter dark chocolate) just takes over. Theres also subtle sweet dark fruits that really separate this from other RISs. Theres a creaminess as well that really balances out what could be a deep roasty, leathery, super sweet bomb. Its got a nice balance, and it feels nice. Almost like nitro."
""
""
"Overall: This beer reminds me more of a cda than a RIS. The flavors are all over the place and just do not mix well for me. Definitely not worth seeking out"
""
""
"O - Still a phenomenal beer (that I'd chose over Abyss and Darklord) but I'm afraid I'm just not a huge fan of this beer when its on the fresher side. The hops are present and I just wish the pine and citric notes would take a back seat to the rich chocolate and dark fruits. 4.0/5"
""
""
""
""
"O: Very impressed, probably my favorite non BA stout. It drinks so easy that it would get me in trouble if I had a lot of it. Definitely a beer I will try to get more of."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. Excellent beer"
"O: The age has toned down the hops a bit and let the other flavors really come forward. We drank this side by side with a 2011 and the newer bottle was a bit on the harsher side as far as the hops but the flavor was still really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting RIS. Very fruity, almost over-the-top compared to most. You don't even get any roasted malt until the second half of the taste. It is very tasty and I enjoyed it, but I tend to feel that the root of a great RIS is a major roasted malt aspect, and this one is more of a minority. Otherwise it is a complex, balanced and flavorful beer so I have to give it credit where credit is due. If you're a fan of sweet, fruity RISes, this one is for you."
"Overall it's a good beer but a little bit of a disappointment. I for some reason was hoping for a bit more, and more depth. Good flavor and characteristic but leaves a little more to be desired."
""
""
""
"Overall: Tonight's tasting pitted Darkness and Dark Lord against half a dozen competitors and found these two wax topped whale beers sadly lacking. Instead of standing in line at Darkness day, skip the line and grab a Furious or Bender to enjoy great Surly brews, and an Oskar Blues Ten FIDY for an awesome RIS in a can."
"O - Solid RIS from Surly. Has a good balance between the sweeter flavors, cocoa, and hops on the backend. Nice to get if I ever get a chance to make it out to Darkness Day"
"O: A beautiful beer: bitter yet semi-sweet, great mouthfeel and very tasty and enjoyable."
"Thanks DaftCaskBC for sharing this beauty!"
"Another hookup from Kiddwhiz! Poured from 2011 to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a deep dark black color with a finger's worth of tannish head, good retention and lacing. Looks thick. The nose is a very enjoyable roast mixed with dark fruits and sweet caramel tones. Smells great! The flavor follows suit with an impressive smooth creaminess. The roast and sweetness found in the nose are more pronounced and coupled with hints of bakers chocolate and dark fruits. Sweet but not overly so. Mildly bitter and hides the alcohol very well. Finishes smooth and creamy with a lingering roast and hint of the dark fruit, perhaps a touch dry. Overall, this is a fantastic brew! What a treat!"
"Overall: This beer lives up to it's hype. Better than I remember when I had the 2010 version. I'll definitely have another some time."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, really a great beer. Â Well worth the wait, and worth the hype. Â Not sure when I will get ahold of another one of these, but when I do I'll be sure to enjoy the hell out of it. Â "

"O-A wonderful RIS. Was a great way to celebrate. Makes me wish the grad school was in MN so I could go to Darkness Day every year."
""
"D/O: One heck of brew."
"Simply put Darkness is an outstanding beer. It really won me over with its consistency across all categories. You would be hard pressed to find a more well rounded version of the style."

"It pours black with a pretty significant brown head and nice lacing. The smell isn't quite what I expected, there is very little roast or coffee and instead the aroma is more sweet and chocolate with a little bit of alcohol. The taste is also much sweeter than I was hoping for. Chocolate is the primary flavor here and there even seems to be a hint of dark fruit. For my palate though, it's just a little too sweet and could've used some more roast to balance it out a little. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, not as full as your average RIS, but very smooth. I was really hoping that my second experience with Surly Darkness would be more impressive than the first, but this beer and I just aren't on the same page. It's not a bad beer, but I really don't understand why everyone goes crazy over it, it's too sweet and doesn't have a whole lot else going on."
""
""
""
"Pours with a nice short off white head that recedes to a small ring around the edge of the glass. Very very dark beer. No lacing. Aroma is a bit fruitier than I would have expected. Some roast and cocoa. Flavor goes fruitiness, coffee, then cocoa. There is a mild smokiness as well. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I would have expected for this beer. Was looking for a bit more body. Good carbonation though. Not too sweet, not too bitter, very enjoyable beer. Lived up to the hype for me."
""
"Overall though, it reminds me too much of CBS on tap but nowhere as impressive, and has that noticeable sugar sweetness which gets to me a bit. It's an impressive beer, but I just don't enjoy drinking this at all compared to others I've had."
"O: This rare Surly offering blows me away each time I have it. Really stands alone without the help of barrel aging. A must try for big beer lovers anywhere."
"pitch black with a coffee-and-cream colored head that held and left pretty lace. nose was chocolate cake, coffee, sweet chocolate covered malt balls, blueberry, blackberry, more dark fruit, a hint of booze and a healthy hoppiness. taste was nicely rounded with a strong sweetness that harmonized with and was balanced by coffee acridness and bitter hoppiness. dark fruit, malt and milky chocolate in the middle. full, velvety body. sticky and chewy at times it seemed as well. great beer. well done. couldn't pass up the opportunity to taste this one, and glad i didn't."
"D: this is one super sweet RIS, but super tasty. for only being the 2011 vintage, im surprised on how there is essentially no heat. great dessert beer or could be a great steak beer."

"Body is pitch black with a viscous appearance and a deep brown head that is darker than many other beers' body; minimal retention and moderate lacing, though not surprising. Aroma is of vanilla, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, faint roasted malt, date, raisin, and a touch of plum. Very well balanced. Tastes of vanilla, dark cherries, milk chocolate, caramel, cane sugar, and slight roasted malts. Surprisingly smooth and complex. Mouthfeel is thick in texture, but it goes down smoothly with a creamy finish that thinly coats the mouth. Overall, a great RIS. It has a lot going on flavor-wise, but does well to balance them into a single, cohesive offering. This was the highlight of the tasting."

"12/23/10. Huge thanks to DalzAle for this one! Shared at the QC get-together, I believe. Sweet raisins and dark fruits with licorice, dark candy sugar, a touch of booze, and plenty of chocolate. Sweet chocolate up front with plenty of coffee and dark fruits in there as well. Very nice!"

"I was, overall, very impressed and can definitely say that the hype around this beer is well founded. I don't think I'll be getting my hands on another bottle any time soon, but if I ever do, I hope it will be as enjoyable as this one was."

"O- Was this beer too aged? Maybe, I'm sure there are plenty of people that will enjoy this beer, I'm just not one of them. I want to try a fresh bottle to see differences"

"Overall this beer was pretty good. Been waiting acouple years to try this beer and glad I finally got my hands on it. As a big vampire fan was really stoked to get this vintage but at around 18 bucks a bottle, dont know if I'd trade for it again. Tasty stout though, glad I received it in a BIF"
"O- An impressive, forbidding beer with huge flavors. Definitely among the best of the Russian Imperial Stouts."

"split with DC - sick zombie painted bottle, red wax. been waiting a while to crack this one. poured into a tulip, pitch black and heavy, nice khaki head sits on top and does fall until disturbed. the aroma is of a soft sweet milk chocolate, sweet molasses, roasted malt and is warming. the taste is just absolutely on point, follows the nose with some dark chocolates that are just take over by the molasses and sugars but not cloying also don't get any fruit and maybe a molecule of coffee bean. as sweet as this is i am really enjoying it, i feel like it is clean and not messy although sweet is usually not my thing this is a great tasting RIS. the body is full and slick. creamy and soothing on the palate. i could easily drink the whole bottle. overall i am very happy i got to try and share this. very well made and fresh this beer drinks like is has been aged for a year. the only knock for me is there is just not a ""wow"" factor which is completely fine. i did not find it overly sweet as i have heard throughout. i most likely will not be seeking this again unless it just falls into place. nonetheless a great RIS. DARKNESS>DARKLORD"
"I acquired a 2010 750ml bottle (Vampire label). Poured into a tulip glass from the big bottle. Pours dark black with a dark brown thin head that lasts nicely throughout. Aromatics of chocolate, figs, raisin, dark tart which is exactly what the flavor suggests. Flavor also picks up notes of coffee. Sticky mouthfeel. Puckering smooth RIS!"

"Had Darkness on-tap at Darkness Day 2011. Lots of chocolate and dark fruits in the aroma. Some coffee. Extraordinary aroma. First taste was heavenly - tons of chocolate, fruit. I thought chocolate covered figs. Sticky sweetness overtook everything as I worked through each glass, however, and detracted quite a bit from the overall experience. Have some bottles aging in hopes that the sweetness gets a bit subdued. ""Did you expect it to be that sweet"" was the most common thing I overheard at DD this year."
""
""
"This was an amazing stout. I loved every bit of it. This beer was just a power house without being over the top with anything. If this beer was a linebacker, it would be Brian Urlacher. Just a bad mother fucker and knows it but doesn't have to go around telling everyone how good he is. Top notch for sure. Big thanks again to JR for sharing this bottle."

"Overall- The taste of this RIS is even better than the smell. And the hoppy character adds a nice little spin to the style. I would love to try this one aged for a year or two!"

"One of the bottles opened this New Years, pumped to try out the 2010 (Vampire) version. Poured into a snifter this beer was a deep black with no light coming through at all. Only about half a finger of a deep brown head. Some slight alcohol legs on the glass. Really getting strong roast presence in the aroma with some anise, chocolate, and molasses in the smell. The taste on this one is great. I was actually surprised to get some hop bitterness on this over year old bottle still to add some balance I don't always get in these big stouts. Again hints of caramel, breakfast blend type coffee, chocolate malt, and dark molasses in the taste. This beer was nice and smooth with a solid level of carbonation that made it fairly easy to drink for such a big beer. This is a great beer from Surly and one that I will continue to seek out."
"O: In all honesty, I'm not super impressed. There just seems to be something missing, and I can't put my finger on it. I sincerely remember last years version being better. I'm looking forward to seeing how this beer develops over time."
""
"Black. Void of light. Pours with a dark brown finger of head. Smells of char, roast, chocolate and an intense coffee. Tastes more chocolaty. Still some charred notes and roasted notes. Slight hops on the finish. Body is full, creamy and luscious. Finish is so clean and smooth it's scary."
""
""
"Sepia inky dark appeance with only slight carbonation with an unremarkable nose but followed by a velvety smooth, lushous abundance of pleasantly dark slightly bitter flavors pursued by a vague sweetness, not overbearing or fruity, just a pleasant finish to a highly sip-able beer perfected for a cold winter's night: boozy without burn, sweet and slightly dry."

"D: Overall, easily the best of the style I've ever had. One of the best beers I have ever had. One of only a handful of brews I have ever had a guttural moan involuntarily emerge from my lips upon nearly every delicious sip. I don't give 5's easily, Surly has earned them."
"Lived up to my expectations. This was one to savor, mostly because the alcohol was no joke either. There was a small touch of heat from it, but it wasn't too much"
""
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic brew from my home state brewery. I suggest others do a vert if they can, was surprising how much this brew changed over time."
"O-very good beer - worth the price maybe not - worth standing in line for 8 hours to get yes because you get to try so many others in line"

"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one with me! 2009 (Mummy) Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, alcohol, and subtle vanilla. The flavor was of roasted malt, dark chocolate, sweet alcohol, dark fruit, subtle vanilla, slight smoke, and very subtle molasses. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor and aroma on this one were quite complex and inviting. The booze was still present after all this time, but it was quite nice with the other notes in the flavor. I was really glad I got the chance to finally tick this one officially as I have only had very small samples in the past. A definite must try for any beer fan."

"I would like to start bu saying that I liked this more than I liked this year's version of Dark Lord. Had it on tap at Tribes and have never hsad it before. I won't stick to the formt of beer reviews but still get my point acrdoss. It was very sweet at first but the finish semmed a bit more roasty, wich reallu balanced it out for me, Iam srill not sure of i like dthis beer or not after a fw 'buzzed"" minutes to think abut it, I would give it B as a score. NOt bad but not anything to kill yorself tryin gto get. O'Malley!"

"O-Not a huge RIS fan, but this one has very good taste while also being drinkable. Enjoy having this on tap, but not likely to buy too many $18 bottles of this or any other RIS."
""
""
"Overall: A delicious RIS--don't get me wrong--but fell just a tad bit shy in the complexity department. A solid 4, maybe even 4.5. Not sure how well this one was treated over the past year (shipping/storage conditions), which may have had an impact. Looking forward to trying another 2010 in the future, and also 2011!"
""
""
"overall, a great complex imperial stout. im not certain it was worth the effort it took to get my hands on it, but it is certainly very good. glad I have a couple to age and see how good this can get."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I enjoyed this. I have been looking forward to this day for quite some time. I received a bottle of 2010 earlier this year but waited until today to try the 2011 I received from TIMMYJ21 a month or two ago. I expected the world from this but it didn't quite match up. Still really excellent and solid Russian Imperial Stout. Very proud to have this as my 250th review."
"Surly Darkness pours as pitch black as I'd expect. The cake-like caramel foam slowly builds itself up to nearly four fingers in height, threatening to spill out of the glass without ever actually doing so. Head retention is very good, but lacing is fairly spotty. The nose is pungent, and very enticing. The malt side of things is definitely tilted more towards dark chocolate, but is not without a bit of a coffee presence as well. There's also a fairly noticeable citrus aroma from the hops that fades in nicely behind the malts. As with the nose, rich dark chocolate forms the oundation for the flavor profile. A mild coffee flavor, as well as candied orange slices from the hops, also make their way here from the aroma. There's also a subtle minty note at the back end of each sip that really adds to the beer. The body is impressively rich and creamy, it drinks like it's 13-14% instead of just over 10%. At the same time, the carbonation is absolutely perfect. It's bubbly enough to allow the hops to be as prominent as I'm guessing they're intended to be, but it still lets the full bodied maltiness take center stage. I've been looking forward to trying Surly Darkness for a long while, and this is one beer that definitely lives up to the height. It's one of the best non barrel aged imperial stouts I've ever had."
"O- a truly awesome stout. I wish this stuff wasn't so rare (and expensive) seek it out if you want a good one!"
"Overall, I am not blown away by Darkness. Perhaps I would enjoy this beer more when fresh (considering how much I love fresh Goose Island Night Stalker)? What's here though, one year after this 2010 vintage was released, is a pretty delicious beer. It's not that complex; it's pretty much just sweetness. But it's a full-flavored, rich beer that is working pretty well for me right now as a celebratory beer."
""
""
"O/D- Really, really enjoying this. Alcohol is hidden much better in the taste than in the smell, making this drinkable with a subtle reminder. A real treat, I want this everyday."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good RIS. I'd like to sample it in a year and see how well it's aged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall an outstanding RIS. More please!"
""
""
"D - The hops aren't a bomb here, which I like. It's far more balanced than I expected and already well-developed. My sample wasn't nearly enough."
""
""
""
""
"Bravo to Omar & crew on brewing a stellar RIS!"
"Cost: $10 for a pint, $20 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
"O- This is a great beer I am very happy that I sought this one out. This is an easy drinking, sweet stout. I would love to get another to see what aging would do it."
"Overall a very good RIS from surly. Not the most complex beer within the style but a great beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Drinkability is fine. It's a well made RIS. Certainly not worth any great expense or hassle to acquire though. I traded mine with a local for some limited release HOTD, dollar for dollar, which was fair."
""
""
""
"Overall-- this is a quite an enjoyable little beer to sip with turkey in my belly and football on tv. Niiice."
"2011 vintage split with a buddy of mine. First thing that stuck out at me was how thin this poured. After all of the arguing about which is better between dark lord and darkness, I was expecting it to look thicker. Black in color, but thin. Nice nose, lots of malt, roasts and chocolate. Taste was sweet, coffee, loads of chocolate jumped out at me. Bitter taste as well. Mouthfeel was thin. It coated the mouth, but it was very thin. Also, the flavors really didn't linger. Overall, this was a very tasty beer that I would drink again in a heartbeat, however IMO there is absolutely no debate on which is better between this and DL."

"O: The smell on this was misleading...I was expecting a dry-ish, hoppy stout. Instead I got a full-flavored, chocolatey, fruity beast of a brew. Good for me. It's complex, creamy, and smooth. One of my favorite qualities in an imperial stout is the ability to bring dark fruit into the flavor profile and Darkness is one of the best I have found in that regard. I think this beer could only benefit from 6-12 months in the cellar, but it certainly drinks quite well now. Excellent job, Surly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Holy crap, I loved this beer! It was worth being put on the second tier waiting list in order to purchase it. It's a shame this isn't a year round beer because I know this would be a huge seller. Those who are looking for the one of the best Imperial Stouts around need look no further. With it's rich flavor and smoothness, Darkness is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts around!"

"11 - sampled this beer after having it multiple times over the weekend. Very tasty, I am waiting to have a bottle with just a bit of age on it. Tasted a little too sweet at such a young age, but the complexity of the beer was present. Made me extremely happpy I have several put away to enjoy later."

"I tried Darkness for the first time last night. I managed to score one bottle from the 2011 batch at my local liquor store. I had never understood what drove people to literally camp out in the Surly parking lot the night before the annual ""Day of Darkness"" release event to make sure they got a bottle, especially given the $17.99 price tag. Now I know. I found Darkness exceptional. The beer was deep brown to black in color, with a small, brown, frothy head. The initial taste clearly identified the beer as a stout. However, a deep, complex, malty sweetness quickly took over. There is a lot going on in this beer! I discovered new characteristics and levels of taste with each sip (chocolate, caramel, cream, coffee, smoke, vanilla). I am not a big stout drinker, but this beer really got my attention. I think it is one of those beers that transcends style. I am not sure I liked it enough to sleep in the Surly parking lot. Short of that, however, I will go out of my way to find more bottles in the future."

"Thanks Levi!"
"I've got nothing left to say. I was lucky to get this from a friend in Minnesota. Haven't had better, can't really imagine better either. The only drawback might be the drinkability. I don't think I could have more than a bomber, maybe less . . . but that's not what I want from this style anyhow. I'll say it again: amazing!"
"Overall this beer is pretty good. I saw it at a local bottle shop and never having vertured to ""Darkness Day"" at the brewery, I thought I'd find out what the hype was all about. I was not disappointed."
" Darkness has a taste of bitter cocoa which is familiar for Russian imperial because it has a lightly bitter nutty taste up front with some astringent coffee-like dark mallt elements and raisiny dried fruit aspect. There is a earthy woody and almost light anise taste which comes forward as it warms with mild burnt malt quality as it finishes. This is an extremely drinkable beer for the abv, I found myself having to regulate my gulps and respect the big stout for what it is. I enjoyed how easy it goes down with an almost burnt marshmallow-like caramel essence that bring out a bit of concentrated dark sugar flavor. I was extremely appreciative to Brad for sharing this with us a stout worth savoring"
"Overall a good beer but not as great as expected. Maybe it's meant to be had fresh at which point I'll alter the review but for now the only thing legendary about this beer is the label."
"Overall: An incredible Russian Imperial Stout. Very robust, complex, and tasty. A perfect blend of sweetness and bitterness. Well worth the hype. This is heaven.... or better yet hell in a bottle. :)"
"2. Had intended to enjoy this on International Stout Day, but changed my mind. However, having this on Guy Fawkes Day somehow works as well."
"Awesome beer. Totally awesome. Glad I was able to get my hands on it."
"Overall: An outstanding Porter! I can see what all the hype is about and why this is such a sought after brew. It is perfection for a stout. At 10.3% ABV it's definitely a sipping beer, and a great choice for a good fall or winter warmer. Will look for this again in the future, in bottle or on tap...any way I can get it!"
"Pours an opaque black with a 3 inch puffy dark khaki head that settles to a dense small cap. A latticework of lace lines the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, cocoa powder, and an alcohol aroma. Taste is of dark roasted malt, slightly sour dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate, and some roasted coffee bean flavors. A mild roasty bitterness lingers on the palate with each sip. There is a bit of a soy sauce quality in both the smell and taste but it's not at all unpleasant. This beer has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good RIS that deserves its status as a highly acclaimed beer. I am very happy I finally was able to snag one of these."
"O- I want this fresh before my final decision is made up, but as it stands, it was pretty disappointing. It was way more sweet than anything, somewhere between ItT and DL. Tone down the booze and sweetness, then I'm on board..."
"O - Great brew. Stands up to its competition of Darklord and Sexual Chocolate, but does not destroy them."
"O: Overall this is an excellent example of the style. Dark and rich with nice residual sweetness, and a robust dark chocolate component."
"Overall good, but not quite what I expected. Too much bitter briny roasty astringent soy sauce flavors, big and heavy as it should, but not quite as drinkable. Reminds me of fresh Dark Lord, but this has a year of aging on it. I'll let the rest age more and hopefully the soy sauce and briny qualities settle down."
"O- awesome. Previous years have gotten much better with age, though. I had the privilege of doing a side-by-side of 2010 and 2011 before Darkness Day and the 2010 blew the 2011 out of the water, IMO."
"D - I was pumped to see this one on tap as I haven't come close to trying it on tap before. This is more complex than I remembered it being last year but like I said it seems a bit rough now. I think time will do this one well and help calm this one down a bit. Definitely worth seeking out if you like big, complex stouts."
"Overall Impression- As it did warm up a bit for me, I should have waited longer for my first tasting of this... The Bourbon Oaked Darkness kicked this ones ass! Too bad it was only on-cask the day of the event. The darkness with still awesome and had a great amount of richness and booze to it, but not as powerful as their bourbon, oaked cask. I'm excited to see what this bottle does in a year or so!!"
" Overall u expect this to be great and u won't cry foul, u will enjoy each delicious mouthful."
"This beer rocks!!! In my opinion this is the best stout out there, that I've had the pleasure of tasting. I had it on fresh from a keg, aged from a keg, fresh from a bottle and aged from a bottle. Every way it is great!!! The beer pours a a deep dark black with a very dark frothy head, nothing see through about this beer. The smell is of coffe, chocolate roast, and some hops. The taste is amazing, everything you smell fills your mouth and coats. The finish of the beer is increibly smooth and the left over taste leaves you craving more. I'm glad I live in Minnesota and have a chance at this beer because it is the best!!!"
"Pours black with a nice brownish head. Looks really nice. The smell is dark chocolate, coffee, molasses. Yum. The taste is very dark roasted coffee, chocolate, roasted malts. There is a source of bitterness here (hops?) that provide a nice balance. Over time, this beer gets a bit sweeter as they fade a touch. Really comes together nicely. The body is big and smooth, with lower carbonation - mouthfeel is dead on. A really delicious beer. No alcohol, good balance and yet decadent. One of the best few of the hyped yearly released stouts."
"I have held on to this beer for over 3 years and I finally decided 'what the hell' and opened it. This is probably one of the top 3 or 4 beers that I have had the pleasure of trying."
"And another thing. It sure is nice to see a proper vampire on the label. Old dude is a fairly menacing looking sort. Now, he's no Nosferatu; that's one supremely creepy vampire. But an angry, red countenance and vapid, white eyes? Yeah, that's a proper vampire. None of that team glitter and team other guy bullshit."
"Thanks for this experience!"
"O: A big thank you to ThomasHardy for sharing this. I will be saying this a lot as he shared some awesome beers. Overall I really enjoyed the beer a lot. All the flavors were very well balanced and there was no heat which was a nice touch."
"O: Appearance and mouthfeel are the best parts of this beer, good but indistinct and lacking direction, sort of like ten-fidy and lagunitas imperial stout in sweetness"
"overall an awesome russian imperial stout. I am always up for darkness."
"mouthfeel - creamy like hell. love this. carbonation is dead on. body is thick. sugar is at a good level where its not getting cloying at all. mhmmm"
"O: Tremendous. Age was very kind to this one. I had high expectations and the were met, if not exceeded. This is an amazing beer that I would recommend trying at least once. Do what you need to do to track one down and you won't be disappointed. Surly continues to amaze me."
"Overall: Time has done very good things to this beer. After trying this one and the 2009 vintage, I'm not going to touch my 2010 for at least 2 years."
"O-I feel that this beer was just a little too dry and roasty. Out of the bigger stouts out there I feel that this one could use some more time to age before trying again. I would love to try it again but not fresh."
"O: this is my favorite beer. If i could i would drink this beer year round. i really enjoyed this beer. if you get a chance to buy do it. its so worth it."
"Drink- I was really impressed with this beer. It had a lot going on in the glass but wasn't overdone just a bit young. I feel I opened this one a bit young but I needed to bring something to Woodshop to compete with everyone else. I will try to land another older bottle."
"O: A great imperial stout, but probably towards the bottom of my ""hard to get imperial stouts"" list. At treat nonetheless."
"O: Darkness is damn near the perfect RIS. Insanely drinkable with no alcohol presence in nose, taste or mouthfeel. Surly, as usual, has brewed a masterpiece for the style."
"O- I have been disappointed in the past by beers with this amount of hype (Dark Lord, I'm looking at you), but this was exceptional in every way. What a treat to be able to try, and one of the best stouts that I've ever come across. Just outstanding at every level."
"O - Not my favorite imperial stout but very good."
"-GFunk"
"Overall - Reminiscent of a Dark Lord, but a little thinner. This is a beer I want to stock up on for sure."
"O- Very good- a little goes a long way, but the flavors are spot-on. I very much enjoyed this one. Lives up to my expectations."
"O: This right here is one of the best RIS that I've tasted. Smooth and not too sweet. This is beer that should be served to royalty. Can't wait to try this again."
"Overall, this was probably my favorite beer of the night. Everything just blended together pretty nicely into one of my favorite stouts. I'm pretty sure I'll get to revisit all of the others at some point, but this is probably the only chance I had with Darkness. It was an amazing one."
"thanks to chase2334 for hooking me up with this bottle...2010 vintage poured into my snifter and shared with drpdaddy....Wow...A beautiful black beer capped with an thin tan head..very inviting..my nose did not want to leave the glass, much like a warm shower on a cold morning..chocolate,chocolate,chocolate..smells like desert, with a nice hint of roasted malt, a wee bit of smoke..taste was fantastic..very smooth, no alchohol burn whatsoever,chocolate, with a substantle but creamy mouthfeel...surprisingly drinkable..I had to restrain myself...absolutely the smoothest,well-balanced and delicious impy stouts I have had so far..."
"O: A worthy stout, though it doesn't measure up to its own impressive looking bottle art."
"Big thanks to Blaine for sharing his 2010 bottle during our recent tasting at Willard's. The brew pours a visibly viscous bowling-ball black and is capped with a patchy brown-mocha head that recedes to an encircling wisp; the glass is marked with both legs and lace. The nose has a fair amount of hoppiness; while it is not intensely bitter, it shows a lot of specific hop character, centered in the herbal and lemon-citric range. After a bit the hop impact wanes and suggestions of brutally roasted coffee, 90% cocoa dark chocolate, and something akin to smoked date compote are noted; it is good but not mind-blowing. The flavor kicks it a notch higher in my estimation, with rich sweetness leading the way in the form of suggestions of dark chocolate, dates macerated in port, fig newtons, dark bread and prunes. There are elements at play to temper the sweetness, including hints of meaty smoke, some earthy and herbal hop character, and a fair dose of heavily roasted espresso. The feel is slick and creamy and works quite well. Overall, not world-class, but quite good, nearly exceptional."
"O - No one flavor is very strong but it all melds together pretty nicely. I think I expected something sweeter with stronger favors but I certainly can't say this beer disappointed. Its a great RIS and look forward to having again."
"Overall - it lives up to the hype some what and is a solid example of RIS"
"~shiver~"
"O- Iâ€™ve had this bottle sitting in my cellar for a while waiting for the right occasion to drink it, had it for the first time on tap at Mackenizies during MN craft beer week and was blown away. Itâ€™s safe to say I was not let down from the bottled version. Amazing stout, so rich and complex, one of the best RIS Iâ€™ve had, cannot wait to compare the 08 and 09 to this version."
"O- Don't waste your time and money. This is an unbalanced imperial brown ale. What's with the hype? Surly does make some good beers (Abrasive and Wet), but this is not one of them."
"Thanks for this beer Sean!"
"Overall, this is quite good. I do wish that I had the opportunity to try this fresh, as I am guessing the hops add a lot to this beer, particularly with respect to the nose. As it is, it's still quite a nice and unusual stout. Recommended."
"O- this really is one of the best RIS beers I have ever had, and maybe the best I've had period. I have seen the darkness, and it was indeed enlightening."
"overall this a superb RIS, no doubt about it. very, very well done. just wish it were easier to get a hold of."
"awesome! thats a pleasant surprise and I will now seek out some more. It was just way too enjoyable and drinkable. This box from John just seems to never stop. Good going!"
"Thanks to BOLTZ7555 for this one, 2009 vintage. I split this with friends over Easter, review from notes. The pour is viscous, jet black color, thin tan head. The aroma is full of chocolate, booze, coffee and oak. The flavor is like the nose, and it is very smooth for such a big beer. The beer is thick, and the big abv is not noticeable. A great beer, that I am very glad to have tried."
"â€™08. Pours as black as any stout Iâ€™ve seen with a thick syrupy pour and a deep dark brown head. Smells of sweet caramel and chocolate, vanilla, oak, tobacco, and licorice. Lots of tobacco on the palate with chocolate and coffee really coming through. Honey and vanilla with some nice dark fruits like raisins and plums coming through. This is very oily, with a very heavy mouth feel. Long bitter finish."
"Served in snifter."
"-i had tried a pour of the '09 vintage last year at Boonville Beerfest and I really wasn't very impressed at all. this on the other hand was very tasty. although, i would argue with anyone that wanted to call this an old ale due to its flavor profile, but still very good nonetheless"
"O: This is an all time favorite of mine and one of the first beers I had that changed my view of beer."
"Drinkablility--- I could drink a bunch of this. You would never know this is almost 11 percent- really easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"This was one helluva' beer. Savored well."
"Light carbonation and overall a very good Impy stout. I can see why this one gets the hype, just hope that they continue to produce it in numbers as large as they have been in order to quell all the profiteers."
"O: big fan of this local brew and I'm glad i have some more"
"Glad I jumped the gun on this brew as it is not what you would expect for a popular limited release RIS. This brew poured a extremly black color with the formation of a dark brown colored head. The head stuck around and graced the glass with lace, which I love. The aroma was not extremly powerfull but carried notes of a sweet malt and dark fruits. The taste was extremely interesting as I said above it is not what you would think. Most limited RIS have a extremely thick body with overly powerfull roast flavor, this brew did not. The brew carried a medium style body with a bit more carbonation then is usual with this style. Flavors jumped off the brew as balanced roast/sweet malt/Darkfruits. I was taken back as I was prepared to have my taste buds thrown back by the usual unbalanced nature of RIS. This brew was elegant and is incredibly deserving of its popularity. Will be looking for more bottles of next years release."
"O: To me, this is currently one of the top 3 non-barrel aged RIS/Double Stouts I've had the opportunity to try. Can't wait to trade for next year's version and try it all over again."
"O: Overall, a good beer. Not worth the hype or trading your cellar for, but still good. It's a bit sweeter than I prefer, but not cloyingly so."
"Poured into a bruery tulip, this thing is blacker than black, darkness is the right name alright. Bouts a 3 finger head that sticks around for a while. Lacing is excellent, very sticky. Aromas of dark chocolate, hops, coffee an alcohol is in the background. Tastes unbelievable! This follows the nose with more intensity. This is a thick and chewy impy stout. Darkness is what I would dream about in a Russian imperial stout. It's like raspy on crack, amazing beer!!!"
"O: Solid RIS."
"O- I was trying my hardest to drink this as slow as possible and savor every sip since it would be a while for me to enjoy this again. I've had the chance to have the '10 on-tap and an '09 bottle and gave the '10 a slight advantage. Amazing brew and wouldn't expect anything else from Surly."
"Mouthfeel is fluid and sticky, but thinner than you would think. Definitely not a thick, syrupy beer. Carbonation isn't really present in spite of the large head. Drinkability is tough to gauge - the start and finish don't really go together well, and it feels like a jolt to the system with each sip, but the beer is definitely tasty and well crafted. I thought the hiding of the abv was well done, as booze added to the sweetness present would have been unpleasant. Overall I wasn't blown away, and I much prefer Surly's IPAs, but this was a more than solid offering from a very impressive brewery."
"D -- Excellent brew. I've had other vintages in the past and they stack up equivalently but this is the first time I've thought about reviewing it, and I'm glad I did. Happy 100 to me!"
"This is a great stout. Itâ€™s large in stature and silky smooth and thick. It is, however, quite sweet and wrought with tobacco and soy sauce notes that get in the way of its roastiness. So, all things considered, this did not live up to what I expected from it."
"(22oz bottle courtesy of Alpar!). â€™09 edition with Mummy. Pours near black with tan head. Aroma has soy, dark chocolate and some dark pit fruit along with a bit of green hops. Taste is sweet malt with some faded hops (my preference is NOT hopped up RIS). Full bodied with an oily texture. Finish is dry. Very nice, smooth beer."
"O-Much simpler than I expected, but a very successful beer. It reveals itself slowly, and has a residual effect, building flavors upon flavors the longer you drink. Highly reccomended."
"I've patiently held on to this bottle of Darkness for quite some time. It's tough to tell exactly how it's evolved since I didn't try it fresh, but it is incredibly impressive beer after two and a half years in the bottle. The only slight knock I have is that dark fruit is just a little too strong in flavor. That holds it back a little, but that's nitpicking to the extreme. Darkness is incredible! Thanks a ton, Jamie! Looking forward to the 2009 bottle."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. The feel and taste are good, but was looking for something a little more given how talked up this beer is. I'd like to see a bit more complexity, but its a solid beer overall."
"O: I have just begun reviewing after many years of sampling and consuming beer, but this is currently my favorite beer I have the chance to experience. Received in beer trade from Great example of Imperial Stout and wowed me from first drink."
"I was always told this was a hoppy RIS. Maybe when it's fresh, but not the case here. Good thing, because more bitterness would have ruined it for me."
"Certainly worth trying and the age probably did good by me as I'm not big into the overly hoppy Imperial Stouts."
"D - quite drinkable. not too sweet or cloying, not too roasty, alcohol well blended. definitely recommended. with the body being so full but overall a little sweet this should age very nicely."
"D: A good beer and an enjoyable glass, even if the balance lies a bit too much in favor of the beer's intense, sweet fruit flavors. Alcohol is well hidden and the smoothness made the first half of my glass disappear quickly, though things were bordering on cloying for the second glass."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A little hard to swallow at times because of the ABV, but it is definitely a tasty beer. There is no mistaking that this is a Russian Imperial Stout. Filled with hints of dark fruit, honey, spices and chocolate."
"Grade: A- 4.08"
"I'm not quite sure if it was just this vintage or if something went wrong in this bottle but it tasted soured, but I don't think there were any reports of infection, so I'm just assuming this was how it was meant to be. I'd gladly taste another vintage to see what the heck was going on here. Thanks again though to whoever brought the bottle, not your fault, but just a let down for a beer I've almost traded a lot for -- or even dropped some $$ for on the 'bay."
"This beer is a work of art. Absolutely delicious."
"D - Extremely well balanced beer for everything going on in it. Was a absolute pleasure to drink and hope to get my hands on more than 1 bottle next year."
"D: Excellent beer that I see the draw of."
"D- The darkness is very delicious and dark just want to say i think very highly of surly beer because the come thru time and time again with soild and wounderful tasting product."
"D. Quite good. I'm surprised I like this as much as I do."
"D-very drinkable and awesome. My top want and would love to see this with age."
"Pours a dark dark brown with a lot of brown head. The head sticks around for quite a while. Smells sweet and hoppy. Some nice fruity citrus on the nose. Tastes really nice and hoppy. The hops melds really well with the malt profile. Lots of pine on the tongue and just a really smooth feel. Vry drinkable and incredibly well balanced. This one is so so good!"
"D - Although this beer gets a lot of press here on BA I feel that it is deserving. It is quite big in ABV and complexity of flavors but at the same time not overly sweet. Quite approachable and repeatable."
"Drinkability: Small amounts of alcohol and the mixture of sweetness to a roast like malt create a solid, genuine sense of acceptable drinkability."
"Pours black with a creamy brown head, it looks rich. Lots of lacings on the sides of the glass as I swirl it. Smells of roasted dark chocolate, sweet, but not overly. Tons of roasted malt, then creamy chocolate, dark cherry favor, and some traces of hops on the finish. The mouth is creamy as this beer is very well balanced. The flavor hides the alcohol perfectly. I would drink this beer again (it is a sipper) due to it's well balanced flavor. Not too dry, bitter or too sweet, this was an excellent RIS."
"Finally got a chance to try this beer. Split with good friends, this beer pours a deep dark brown near-black color with a dark brown head, very leggy in the glass on the sides. First whiff and I'm surprisingly hit with hops - bright and piney up front, giving way to nice molasses and deeply roasted barely aromas. Nice. Hops again right up front, pretty unique for a stout, but as the beer warms and you get used to it, this fades in favor of the more familiar stout-y flavors. Lots of deep tones of raisin, coffee, chocolate, leather, a nice subtle char and light smoky flavor in the finish. Great variety coming through. I think my favorite part may be the rich chewy mouthfeel that is somehow at the same time velvety smooth. I wish I had another to age - I bet it develops quite well and the hops die off a bit, but fresh it is certainly damn good and a really unique tasting stout. Very cool."
"Drinkability - For the half a glass I got, relatively so. It was a bit ""too"" warm for me once I was done, but if it had been a tad colder I think I would have enjoyed it that much more. I have one of these sitting in my cellar and can't wait to open it. Very good beer!"
"Overall- Great beer, the abv's go virtually unnoticed. Great balance and depth to this one. It truly is a world class Imperial Stout."
"drinkability is great - this makes my top ten list of impy stouts"
"D: Considering the hype, this one falls short for me. The sweetness is slightly overbearing and there's no balance. The alcohol is hidden which is a plus. Won't seek out again"
"D - Split the bottle with my husband and some neighbors - let's just say I would have licked the bottom of the glass if I could have. Overall a delicious beer that was worth the price (I paid a bit over retail...eek!) and the wait! By far one of the best I have tried!"
"3.5 D: Gave this a 3.5 because the taste was a borderline 3.5. This is easily the best hoppy imperial stout out there, but I'm not that big of a fan of that approach to stouts. I like big malty flavors and low hop contribution. Still, this is a pretty tasty and I think this will be damn good once the hops have time to fade."
"D - Leaves some alcohol burn, but does have a great taste that keeps you wanting more."
"Overall impression: A badass stout, definitely worth seeking out."
"Full syrupy body, lower carbonation, sticky and chewy. Drinks really smooth and easy with a delicious silky body. Darkness creates a nice mix of fruit and chocolate tempered by alcohol heat and slight hop bitterness."
"2010 vintage, courtesy of backfat (thanks Dave!).This beer poured a midnight, oily black that didn't allow any light to pass. It smells of deep, dark roasted malt and that's about it. The coffee is subtle, the rest of it was expected. I hoped this beer was the equivalent to Darklord but I was wrong. It is coffee, sweet, chocolate and roast. This is cloyingly sweet. The balance is questionable at best. God, I wanted so much more. It is very smooth though and drinks like a champ. It's drinkable, yet too sweet. The complexities aren't there."
"It poured a delicious black and had a pretty steady head on it. The taste was amazing, it had a nice fig, roast, and chocolate. The mouthfeel was quite thin but it did not take away anything from the beer. After being poured it smells of a really sweet dark chocolate w/ a slight fig and raisin. Overall for being 10.3% ABV, it is easily drinkable, almost way too easy. Darkness was probably one of the most amazing stouts I have tasted so far. I am amazed at how good the fig taste goes with the dark chocolate and roast. I wish I had a Fig Newton to try with it."
"All in all, so glad I got to try these. '08 was definitely my favorite. It was so BIG and intense and boozy blended with the strongest flavors. If you hunt one of these IMO, try to go for the '08. The '09 would be my second, and the '10 would be my last. Continue brewing great beer Surly."
"Poured into 3 ounce tasting glasses. Poured a very viscous black. Gave it a violent pour and it lead to a very faint, mocca head. It smelled immediately of cinnamon and raisins. The taste didnt hold any cinnamon but the raisins continued to shine, almost tasted like burnt raisins. Very sweet. The sweetness continued to shine and amplify with every sip. The barreling didn't really come through with this one for me, expected more oak. Mouthfeel is okay, very carbonated. I think a year of cellaring will make this one into a hell of a beast. Drinkability was nice, but again a little less carbonation and I could have drank a lot more. Looking forward to tasting some older vintages."
"Darkness is Spreading!! Black and unholy. Iniquitous roastiness, some vile smoke, depraved chocolate, nefarious hop bitterness, a corrupt nuttiness. It fills me with wickedness, my glass shudders from the weight of the moment. Omar, you are a sick man..Exceptionally drinkable. The year has been kind to this beer."
"loving it, but not difficult to drink by any means."
"This is the best stout I have ever had. A stellar concoction. Roasty, chocolatey, nutty, oaty, brown sugary, just flat out delicious. Love it every year. Each year is a littel different, but ut never disappoints. I am glad that I have two bottles sitting around. Can't do any better than this."
"Drinkability: Notthe most drinkable beer I've ever had. Alcohol and sweetness are a bit much. Give me a Kate over this any day!"
"D. Extremely drinkable. This is an excellent beer. Super smooth and very flavorful at the same time. Had a nice chocolate flavor for me that I really like. I was expecting a lot and I was not disappointed."
"I wouldn't give this too high. Just an above average RIS for me honestly. Combine it with the price, availability, the hype and the overall flavor, I doubt I'd be seeking this out again. I have a bottle of 2010 at home and I'll probably let that age for a year or so and see what a difference cellaring the beer does."
"removed the wax, decapped and filled my new darkness snifter. brew poured a deep dark ominous, yet slightly watery black. as the beer settled in my glass it embodied the name of the beer. a finger and a half of off white-acino looking head appeared on the surface. as the head dissipated it left thick foamy lacing on the glass. inviting and menacing! wonderful black malt with a solid amount of roast and a great hop to balance things out. some bitter coffee and chocolate notes on the nose as well. nice hoppy stout (actually kind of reminds me of hoppy stout from greenport harbor). a bit of char. really just a phenomenal beer. big bold and roasty with a slight amount of char on the feel. overall, one of my favorite stouts. great year after year."
"Full bodied, thick but not painfully so. Incredibly smooth and flavorful, all meld together perfectly..."
"D- Overall this is a great beer. I might just stick with the Old Raspy and not have to worry about the trade. Darkness is a great representation of a RIS. The hype train has grabbed on and won't let go."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is full. In spite of the full body the beer wears a wonder bra. The mouth feel is no where near as thick as I was hoping for. Made me wonder where all the curves went. Light carbonation breaks the body up a bit. Dam near a perfect beer! I love the roasted and fruit notes. Alcohol is present in all layers of the beers experience but for me only tends to accentuate the beers strong points."
"Okay, for 10.30%abv, this is dangerously smooth and drinkable. This is where Darkness shines for me. I'd love to have 4 to 6 bottles that could be consumed over the course of an evening."
"D - Very good beer, but not sure it quite lived up to the hype."
"I'd also love to see how it ages. Probably upside down or in a coffin or something."
"Was comparable to tenfidy also. Not my favorite RIS, but definitely solid. But I'd rather have coffee bender, abrasive, furious or wet. This would be no big deal if it was in a can."
"Serving type: bottle"
"M and D - Smooth, medium to full body, with decent carbonation, maybe a touch more than is usual for the style. A little syrupy but not cloying, this is one to sip and savor. Excellent brew."
"This was a bit of a let-down for me... I was looking for a life-changing event, but this was not it. Struck me as more of a black IPA, which is good. The carbonation made the really nice and robust flavor difficult to access, it kind of diluted the flavor or washed it away too quickly. As it warmed, the beer really has a unique and wonderful flavor, but some of the details are a bit off, in my opinion."
"(57th)"
"D: It's unfortunately a bit hard to rate this beer as objectively as I would like (my earlier find this evening is clouding my judgment). It is quite good, although a little bit more harsh than I would like. Another year in the bottle would have been interesting. It doesn't quite measure up to the hype, but don't get me wrong. I'd drink it again at the drop of a proverbial (or literal) hat."
"D: Don't get me wrong, this was an amazing beer and deserves a very high score. It's one of the better RIS I've had, but I was actually expecting a little more given all the hype around it. I would drink this as often as I could if I was able to, but I think even something like Ten FIDY in a four pack off the shelf is pretty damn comparable."
"D - It's a big beer, but fairly drinkable. This isn't necessarily a dessert beer as it isn't cloyingly sweet, could actually pair with a sweet bbq."
"I've never given a perfect score to any beer, not even an A+. I've always waited for that one beer that would destroy every sense of reality that I had to give out such an honor... but here it is... Surly Darkness.... and it does not disappoint."
"Nose initially reveals a nice roast, chocolate, coffee character blended with a fresh leafy hop kick, beautifully integrated. Then rich mocha, hints of smooth espresso (not the acrid stuff from Starbucks!), dark chocolate and milk chocolate, cocoa powder, clean earthy roasted malts, hint of molasses, vanilla. The mouthfeel on this is standout, so smooth and creamy without ever being syrupy, aided by just the right hop bite and dryness. Not too sweet, just so fine. Alcohol so well hidden. Perhaps not the most complex of the big beers but this is perhaps the most balanced, drinkable of the big RIS's I've had - which is a real talent. Thanks a ton Eric!"
"Jet black viscous pour with a mocha head that stays the course. Smooth aroma of chocolate and coffee with light vanilla. Relatively simple flavour has chocolate and medium coffee roast along with hints of smoke. While the flavour is very pleasant, there are a few things that really stand out for me in this brew. Firstly, its incredibly balanced. Secondly, the mouthfeel is exceptional - full and smooth. Finally, for its weight it might just be the most drinkable imperial I've come across."
"The taste was that of a thick, and powerful potion, with a middling bitter at the end. It was good, but not one to drink in mass quantities. It's one that I'll try again at the next release."
"D-Was good, not great. Expected more, was left wanting. It doesn't compare to some of the other great Imp Stouts wondering out there. Wish for a more balance smooth flavor with it also being more intense."
"Andy shared this one for his 100th tick! This one is the 2009 vintage poured into a tulip. The beer pours pitch black into a tulip with a big creamy looking tan head that sits atop the beer retaining itself very nicely. The aroma is very chocolatey initially with big roasty aromas lingering in the background with dark fruit and a bit of charred kind of smoke characteristics. The taste follows the smell pretty well. Really enjoyable roasty flavors with chocolate undertones. The beer is slightly sweet with a bit of hoppy bitterness in the finish. All around very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy. Light carbonation and a robust body make it great. Definitely an great one but at a big 10.3 this one hides the alcohol very well, but still ends up being a sipper."
"This is a really big, kind of sweet stout. A very good offering."
"Drinkability - simply amazing, want to keep on putting it down which is dangerous with the ~10% abv..."
"Overall I'd have to say this is not my favorit vintage but still very good. I miss the hops that the '08 version had. Again, a good beer, one I'll keep going back for"
"D---To the dome homeboy, to the dome..."
"An excellent brew that I'd gladly trade for again. Worth seeking out."
"Very imperssive and an absolute treat to have on draft. Yummm...."
"Lucky to find on tap at Firkin. Been waiting a long time to try this one. Not disappointed at all. Nose of chocolate, coffee,floral hops, mile esters. Taste of chocolate and roasty malts. Nuce, creamy mouthfeel. Firkin got a half barrel and it s half gone today. With the Surly shortage in I'll, better get this while you can."
"Drinkability- In a land of one and done RIS I might be able to session this one until I fell off my stool."
"This is a super smooth brew with a creamy full feel that is lightly carbonated. A pleasant alcohol warmth hits the back of the throat but not with the intensity you would expect from something with more than 10% abv. Once this brew warms it has some coffee bean quality that is also citrusy. This is a must try stout, awesome to try right now."
"Was worried about cracking this so soon but I am glad I did. Pours a black color with a caramel colored head. Has an aroma of roast, candy sugar, and cherry. Has a roasty caramel taste with some cherry notes throughout and a nice velvety chocolate finish. Gentle bitter hit. Creamy mouthfeel. For this hoplover, this beer is pefect to drink now as the gentle bitters add a bit to the complexity. As it ages the hops will fade and with the beer already being mellow, not sure how much aging will add."
"This is the perfect dessert drink. Was the perfect accompaniment to the molten chocolate cake I had at Cafe 28."
"Drinkablity -- Wow, this RIS is pretty damn good. Quite possibly the best of the Midwest (sorry, Dark Lord). Rich and with great depth of flavor, but not sticky, cloying or out of balance. Hops are great, the mouthfeel is even better. Seek this out on tap."
"Highly, dangerously, drinkable. Goes down smoothly."
"Who'd've thought that one of my personal whales would beach itself 'round here? Hey, I'm not gonna argue. Its pour verifies its name, as nothing but straight darkness sits in the glass, a finger-thick tan chapeau sitting jauntily on top. The nose comprises raisins, rum, blackened oats, figs, chocolate-covered strawberries, roasted malts, light molasses, and a very slight fusel scent streaming from the base. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, chocolate syrup, molasses, maple syrup, figs, oak, brown sugar, light orange flesh, and a touch of Belgian yeastiness. Honestly, the last two were a bit surprising, but definitely can't be considered detracting, as they add a refreshing complexity to a usually brutish style. The body is pretty hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, I was not at all disappointed by this, though the one thing I would note is that it's a tad lighter and fizzier than I expected. But this was a minor issue at best, smothered by the overall tastiness."
"I was so happy that this beer actually found its way to Illinois. This beer is as advertised...Darkness is spreading in my glass. It is adorned by a finger of sandy brown foam with some nice lacing on the glass as it goes down. The smell is of a weaker bourbon, there is a citrus hop aroma, a bit of caramel and what seems to me to be the essence of Belgian yeast. The flavor is bourbon, brown sugar, caramel, hints of vanilla and clove as well to help with the nice complexity of this beer. I found the mouthfeel to be a little too carbonated for me, but that didn't mean it wasn't good. The drinkability is really good. Though it may be high in ABV you really can't tell too much on the palate. It's a really well made beer and I hope to get it again someday."
"(D)- A solid RIS for sure. It was really nice to see that it was not overly rich, sweet, or viscous as I was expecting; rather, it is far more sessionable because of that. If I could, I would do a whole bottle of this on my own if I felt like it. The drinkability and mouthfeel are where this beer truly shines. In terms of flavor, however, it might need some more time to age."
"This was a really nice beer. I wish I could have tried some of the past years to put it up against but I'll take what I can get in trying the 2010 version. It was a great tasting brew and I think it lives up to the hype."
"IMHO better than the 09 & 10 Dark Lord, 09 Darkness, 09 Black Tuesday, and 10 KTG, but I'm a midwest homer so take it with a pinch."
"The aroma and taste go right into your head and assault your temples. I had a headache halfway through. I really wanted to like this beer more than I did... It is also way to expensive; I would not buy it again."
"D - This one lives up to the hype. A truly delicious RIS!"
"Drinkability: Definitely a well-crafted stout and one I could enjoy frequently, were it available more regularly. Well worth seeking out."
"A very good beer but not worth the hype and effort. But then, which other RIS's are as good? This one sure is outstanding."
"D: Overall my first 8 ounce snifter was much, much more drinkable than my second snifter. This wasn't due to fullness or inebriation, but rather I feel the dry hoppiness at the finish caused it to become much more of a slow, sipper over time. With that being said, I felt this was an excellent beer and was very drinkable. I would equate it somewhat to a Goose Island Nightstalker, though not quite as hoppy...more like a blend of Nightstalker and Darklord. The beer has wonderful balance. I would love to try it out of the bottle sometime."
"Oh the waiting was painful, this beer is amazing and I wanted to try it for years. 750 ml bottle thanks to footbalm, 2008 edition. Pours a pure black color with a large creamy brown head. The aroma was amazing; huge dark fruits, sweet molasses, caramel, chocolates and rich coffee. Sweet plums especially in the amazing nose. The flavor was amazing as well; initial dark fruits give way to a fizzy and bitter hops. The core of this beer though is a rich chocolate, roasted malt and super decadent coffee mix.The flavor is more than just balanced, you can detect tons of hops, tons of fruit and tons of sweetness. The mouthfeel is very creamy and full. The beer leaves a sludgy leg running down the glass. Amazing. One of the best things I've ever drank. Re-rate: had the 2009 edition at the massive Imperial Stout tasting in Boise. Just as good, rich fruits and aggressive flavors. Still, one of my favorites."
"The score is representative solely of the bottles as they tasted circa October 2010."
"Overall, Darkness is a good stout. It's like a mini-Dark Lord. Almost like Surly brewed Dark Lord's younger cousin. This is definitely one to age. It stands out from the other big stouts on the top 100. It lacks notes of espresso with a heavy chocolate base that I've come to love. It can improve with a year in a bourbon barrel; this stout tastes like it was made for it. This thing has a hop bill that makes it unique. Next bottle I trade for will definitely spend 2 years in the cellar."
"D: Can barely taste the alcohol. Had a couple of these at Pizza LucÃ© after 2 years of attempting to be around MN when it was released."
"A bit light and hoppy with the opening aroma. Pours about what you'd expect from a RIS, thick and black with a small tan head. Tastes as Surly describes, but a bit less flavorful than one might expect from such a prestigious and rare brew; it's fantastic but no Dark Lord. The palate is a bit thinner than the pour suggests, not the thick motor oil feel we expect from RIS's, but good none-the-less. Overall it's among the top of it's style, but might not be worth the hype, and for the price I think i'd rather have a couple Goose Island Nightstalker's."
"D: There is no bourbon, coffee, barrel-aging, or any other gimmicks in this brew. This is just good old-fashioned brewing. Extremely memorable!"
"D - While this is certainly a sipper, it's one I could drink all day. I don't know how they make such a sweet, high-alcohol beer this drinkable, I just know I enjoyed the heck out it."
"D: The sweetness got to me a little bit, but overall this is a very drinkable10.3% RIS."
"I could have one of these every day for the rest of my life and die a happy man. This is surely a top notch RIS and one that I will consume as much as possible. Worth all of the hype."
"I enjoyed the 2009, but I'd like to see how it has changed in 2010. If the sweetness dropped down a bit I would love it."
"Overall I think this lived up to the hype, it is truly an excellent beer."
"The 09 version is so much better than this, the 10 is just a big let down."
"HOLY COW. Had this on tap at Groveland Tap, and it was amazing. Pours a dark rich black with a nice creamy tan head, excellent lacing. Strong malt smell, amazing taste, thick and rich with a great bold body. Spectacular mouthfeel, thick and rich. Super drinkable. Really happy I picked up 2 bottles."
"drinkability: 5.0 - Not an over the top alcy bomb, and just has a finish that keeps you wanting more and more. Bravo Omar and Todd!!"
"D - A little low because it was hard to come by and not too sure if I would have another. Might have another year but for this year that is waht I am rating it."
"2007 was magnificent. Poured into a plastic cup but even that couldn't take away from this complete beer. Cant put it any other way - awesome."
"In total a great beer that I think probably benefited a good deal from cellaring a year. I had this a day after having a 09 dark lord and its amazing just how different two huge beers made in the same general style can be. Glad I finally got a hold of this one, but unless I move to minnesota for some reason, I don't anticipate going through the trouble of obtaining it again."
"Pours black with a tan head, about a quarter inch that fades into a ring at the edge. Amazing lacing for the style. Smell is bitter coffee and hops, licorice, milk. Taste is pretty fantastic. Sweet malt, sugary frosting, chocolate and hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is a heavy but perfect. Heavy with lots of lactose, light but fizzi carbonation. For the style, as drinkable as it gets."
"D - Even though its thick I can't stop drinking it. Very enjoyable. The sweetness suprises me. Good work, Surly!"
"I made my way through the chophouse, the spider web, the grim reaper, and the bloody black roses to my beer fridge. I took the bottle in hand, scurried to the bar and quickly placed it down. There was a strange energy surrounding the bottle. As I got closer to it I felt more and more empty inside. The mummy on the front had me begging Zapps to stay close and protect me. I grabbed Jlynn's heavy duty bottle opener of the orange dish. Stabbing at the bottle cutting through the wax left me out of breath. Finally I reached the cap and quickly pried it open before I was thrown backwards by an unkown force. Looking up at the bottle I could see spirits escaping which reminded me of the micronized Ghostbusters ghost trap. I broke out my proton pack and quickly secured them in the containment unit. Cautiously making my way back to the bottle I secured some tulips. I poured the thick sludge into my tulip and noticed a low carbonation level and the consistency of a Transylvanian Moat. A tan almost brown head jumped out of the moat like vampires of the night hunting for their prey. Finding myself in a trance like state I quickly looked away. I finally gathered the courage to take a sniff with my eyes closed. Roasted bat malts, plum witches dances around my noise hairs. After two years of lifting weights in my beer fridge the hops are still going strong. I picked up this evil liquid and took a sip. Feeling slightly possesed I could sense tons of different malts. The most impressive fruit profile of any stout I've ever had. So many flavors coming through. Despite the robust chocolaty coffee notes, the fruit dominated. What an interesting demon. Very low carbonation despite the exorcism. The demons sucked the bubbles out. As with any massive 10.3 ABV stout this one is a sipper. It's not meant to be chugged like a coors light. The drinkability is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is smooth as a witches broom handle. Unless I go to MN on darkness Day or trade another precious KTG this will probably be my only Darkness. What an impressive brewery. Very glad I got to try this one. Happy Halloween."
"Cheers!"
"Note: Although 60-some breweries were on hand...my friends found it was very hard to dislodge me from the Surly booth once I got a taste of Darkness 2010."
"All in all, massive disappointment. even though this bottle was from the most recent vintage, I didn't get any of the hops that others are mentioning. I wish I had, since it might have balanced this mess out. I don't imagine I'll be trying this one again. Took me almost 5 hours to finish the bottle, and I was sick to my gut afterwards. Yeck."
"Pours a deep dark black hue with a nice bubbly one finger head on my pour. Nice hoppy aromas right from the start. There were hints of roasted malts and chocolate along with bitter coffee. It had a somewhat green aroma beneath the roast. Tons of bitter hops noted. Beautifully roasted chocolaty malt does come through as does a hint of vanilla, a nice dose of smoke, and a touch of dark fruit. A slight alcohol burn lingers after each gulp. Full in body, rich and somewhat syrupy."
"d - I've been looking forward to this beer for quite a while and it did not disappoint. It had a complex, balanced smell I enjoyed a lot and a great mouthfeel. It was also hoppier than I expected. I think I enjoyed the 08 a little bit more than the 09, but both were great. Can't wait to have this one again."
"O - Wonderful RIS, the hoppyness starts to detract from the flavor. Need to cellar a few."
"Thoughts: Surly is one of the most talented brewies in the craft beer world. I have not had a ton of beers from them but everything I have had is amazing. They are quickly becoming one of my favorites. AND the awesome kick ass bottle art is just adding to it. THIS IS TRUE CRAFT BEER. CHEERS!"
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side but not as thick as say Dark Lord. Carbonation is moderate for the style. Drinkability is good, I really liked the flavors it had. It really has a chocolate covered , booze soaked, cherry flavor to it that I really enjoyed. Very drinkable and delicious beer overall."
"I drank the whole bottle by myself without any problems and could have drank another if I had more."
"ssshelpsss....itsssgotsssmesss..."
"A bit cloying, but the alcohol is well hidden. One bottle wasn't exactly easy to put down. Really similar to Chokolat which is much easier to trade for. It also gets a bit better after it warms."
"Pours jet black with a pinky fingers worth of tan head. Smells are chocolate, roasted malts, a lo of cocoa, dark fruits and booze! Tater are much like the nose, chocolate, cocoa, malt and booze and goddamn good! Mouthfeel is sticky and chewy, perfect. We could have easily split another bottle this was so good. Worth the hype."
"Overall if they were to tone down the sweetness on this one it would reach epic levels of enjoyability, the nose is right on."
"Overall: In terms of taste, completely overrated. Nobody from our 6 people group could finish the glass. Look, smell and mouthfeel close to perfect though. The brewers should contact the Narke brewery for a course in tasty, balanced RIS brewing! The worst one of the evening. Hopeless and hopless"
"This was a great choice for #400. It was a perfect beer to share with a friend. As I write more and more of these reviews, one thing is becoming apparent to me. Beer is a wonderful thing, but the most important thing in keeping a diary like this is being able to remember the good times you had sharing the beers you're documenting. That's when the power of this fascinating beverage is at it's peak."
"One finger light tan head, medium dissipation with some lacing. Dark brown opaque body, no visible carbonation. Big complex nose, there is a lot going on here, I picked up chocolate and cherry up front, a bit of coffee and caramel balanced against a stone fruit and bitter on the back end hop bill. Taste mirrors nose, pretty damn smooth, I picked up a milk chocolate cordial cherry taste with some bitterness on back end, not overwhelmingly so. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, a bit sticky. Didn't want to hoard the bottle, what I had was damn good, looking forward to having this again."
"A special thanks goes out to Shango42 for the unique opportunity to finally enjoy this beer. He gets my right arm if he ever requests it."
"Darkness hits the tongue with a powerful blend of roasted chocolate malts, sweet caramel and molasses, and tons of dark fruit (black cherry syrup, mandarin orange, and fig). Sweet, bordering on cloying, but the earthy hops, bitter chocolate and coffee close the deal and save the finish from becoming too sugary. Alcohol is all but a brief burn on the way going down...very well-hidden. Chewy, thick mouthfeel that coats the palate, yet has enough carbonation to keep the body from weighing and wearing down the tastebuds. All in all, a delectable, delicious brew from the good folks at Surly. There's a reason this beer is in the top 50. As if there was ever any doubt, consider the Darkness hype worthy."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large deep dirty brown color head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and black chocolate with some light liquorice and dry coffee notes is quite enjoyable. Taste is also a heavy mix between some roasted malt with light bitter notes with rich black chocolate notes and very subtle notes of liquorice and dry fruits. Sweetness is very well balanced and not nearly as cloying as Dark Lord. Body is full with good carbonation and warming notes are perceptible though nothing too heavy. Well done and still retaining some balance even though it is an extreme beer."
"Oh my wife just commented the label would make a great tattoo."
"O - this is a great beer. A hoppier imperial stout that has a lot more flavors to balance this beer out, well done. Should be seeked out for stout fans."
"2008 vintage. poured into my duvel tulip. its quite dark, shows some deep ruby notes as the glass is emptied. head dissipates over time. nose of light chocolates, maple, and aged malty notes. if there is booze in this its entirely covered by all the candy notes. taste is mostly of sugary malts and chocolate covered raisins, and even some berry fruits. however, its balanced by just enough bitter chocolate notes and perhaps even the remnants of what was once a well hopped beer. i can pick out a couple notes that are similar to the only other surly beer ive had (ill save you the details, but it wasn't a pleasant experience). must be a house yeast. this beer is incredibly complex on the palate but extraordinarily well balanced. everything is in check, unlike darklord. mouthfeel is very pleasant. carbonation is very fine but ample. spot on mouthfeel. so unbelievably drinkable for 10.3%."
"This is one hell of a RIS which I have to say is one of the few hyped beers that actually live up to its rep. Fantastic RIS I wish I could obtain more easily. Great part was everyone sharing it all agreed that it was a fantastic beer."
"This beer is totally worth the hype unlike some of the other ""dark"" beers that have been hyped up."
"D- This beer is worth all the praise. I would love to make it out to Darkness Day this year. I am glad I have a extra bottle in the cellar and got to try this one out. This beer is going to become one of my favorite."
"D: Didn't really love this one, I don't think i could finish a bottle off myself."
"Overall an amazing beer that is deserving of the hype, but I found it a bit sweeter than I would have liked. Next time I'm trying it fresh. I love the hops and hopefully they will shine a bit more. Still a super complex beer that I was super happy to try. Thanks NuBrewm!"
"I'd pair this beer with dessert or game meat like venison as the sweetness with really play with the savor aspect of the beer. If choosing dessert I'd go with something black forest cake that the bitterness would play well with this sweet beer!"
"D: Rich, sweet, and filling. This was a great beer, but I'm glad I had friends to share this with. Would love another to add to the cellar."
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, but could only handle drinking a 4-8oz. pour. The next time I crack one of these bad boys open, it will be w/ other BA friends."
"D- Overall- I REALLY like this beer. Its very good overall. The '08 and the '09 were very similar in overall profiles so I didn't comment on individual differences because I noticed few, if any. I'd still like to try this beer fresh when the hoppy notes tend to really shine. ABV was pretty well hidden here as well."
"DB- Obviously rare and probably decently expensive. For how many flavors and the great time I had drinking this I would say it's worth it. Very complex Barleywine-like RIS with a great balance of a many different flavors."
"I'm glad I split this because the sweetness may have killed it over time. Definitely not what I expected, I liked it but if it were a little more stout and a little less barleywine-tasting this I would've liked it more, still I love the chocolate/cherry here. A stout like no other."
"Thinner body but it's not bad. The carbonation was in the middle of all the stouts we sampled."
"Surly Darkness is a magnificent beer without a shadow of a doubt. It is an immensely bold and extremely complex stout, but what sets it apart for me is the uniqueness of the flavors. I can comfortably say that this is without a doubt completely unlike any RIS I've ever had. The way the hops are incorporated into the massive malt-profile is truly a work of art, and for that I take my hat off to the brewers at Surly."
"I've been looking forward to trying this for a long time, and I was still blown away. I easily prefer this to Dark Lord, and if it weren't for BCBCS, I'd say this is the best stout I've had. I'll be driving to Minnesota this fall, without a doubt."
"overall - great beer. This is VERY different than DL, much more hoppy and less intensive sweetness. Its somewhere inbetween DL and DORIS. Very drinkable though!"
"Would I buy more of it? - I was fortunate it enough to receive this bottle from a very generous beer loving friend in the Midwest. If I lived within a few hours of Surly I'd certainly make the pilgrimage each year just for the fun of it."
"Well Darkness exceeded my expectations and I had a smile on my face the whole time. I usually take my sweet time with big rizzes, but this was drank with the quickness, probably because it's not a overly gooey RIS. I wish I had more and can see why alot of people on this site hoard this beer, one that is not all that incredibly rare at this point, it's just damn fine stuff that demands some respect."
"Overall: The aroma and flavor of this beer provide an exclusive look into the complexities of dark fruit and sweet chocolate created by a well crafted Russian Imperial Stout. The alcohol provides a nice warming and spicy presence and the orange peel was a surprising twist. While I describe the beer as full bodied, I would expect this style to hold more of a chewy character. Instead you're presented with sticky sweetness that somewhat artificially fills the palate. By the end of my review the head had completely disappeared as well. Â  Â  Â "
"Overall a very tasty beer in small amounts but I couldn't drink alot at all. Very heavy and very malty. But I am glad I finally got to taste this beer."
"Mouthfeel was luxurious. Rich and silky smooth. Overall I would describe this beer as ripe fruit wrapped in velvet. Dangerously drinkable."
"07 vintage on tap. Poured very dark brown, thin tan head. Has a strong hop aroma. Tastes extremely hoppy with all sorts of nice stout goodness hiding behind the initial blast of hops. Chocolate, espresso, oatmeal, roasted malts, dark fruits. You can tell there is a completely different beer hiding under everything. Hop flavor was similar to furious, which to me is a good thing. Finished thick and oily, nice and creamy. alcohol goes unnoticed. I can only imagine what this will turn into as the hops drop back and everything else comes forward. One of the most complex beers I've ever tried."
"Pours thick, oily and black, so black no light passes through, with a nice mocha head. Big aromas on the nose: hops, chocolate, roast, coffee and licorice. The first taste brings a suggestion of hops, followed quickly by warming alcohol. Roasted malt, dark fruit and chocolate covered espresso beans. Finishes thick and rich, with a nice kick of alcohol heat. A very good beer."
"Glad i made the trip to enjoy this beer with some of my too seldom seen friends in the city."
"Overall a great beer, and one that I'd order again!"
"This is the new best beer I've ever had... by a decent margin."
"D- A little more time would've helped this one out. The alcohol was still very hot."
"D- with such a complex flavor profile and abv I wouldn't say its a session beer but damn if this is not easy going."
"After having this on cask at GTMW (one of hte first samples I grabbed) I'm bumping my scores up for this. It was truly sublime with some age on it."
"D: I need to attend Darkness Day to really test this beer's drinkability :)"
"Drinkability- With each passing year it seems Darkness becomes less of a style dominator. More of a Black IPA at this point. Hope Surly goes back to the 2007 recipe for 2010. I would take an Old Rasputin or Storm King over this."
"I'm not as huge of a fan of hoppy imperial stouts as others geeks, but I do like Darkness and its hoppy profile. Needless to say, I'm very happy to have called a bottle of it my own."
"This beer still reminds me of a well aged Stone RIS though."
"The beer is sweet and has a definite chocolate bitter / semisweet flavor to it. There is a nice maltiness to the beer that is really nice. Beer overall has a medium body and as it warms there is more caramel in the palate. Drinkability high and mouthfeel is high. I'd be interested in the other vintages."
"This beer was great fresh but with over a year on it the potential for this beer is really coming out."
"D - Yes. Indeed. 4.5"
"In short, Darkness and I have a love hate relationship, much like the re-launch of Doctor Who. '07 is Tennant, the 10th Doctor, arguably the best. '08 is Eccleston, the 9th Doctor, far too cheeky for its own good, and the '09 is Matt Smith, the 11th Doctor, there's promise, but right now it has some pretty big shoes to fill to be the best."
"D - Excellent imperial stout. Alcohol really isn't noticeable which is scary. Loving this stout...definitely lives up to its reputation. Excellent - highly recommended."
"D- Like I said with the mouthfeel, nice and sweet, but doesn't become cloying at all. Alcohol is completely masked and I could have probably finished the bomber no problem (but I split it with a friend because you can't just crush Darkness alone.)"
"D - Again, an interesting and innovative approach to the style. As of now the jury is still out, so I must seek this out again."
"Another great unique beer from Surly."
"D: Very good drinkability. There is a touch of booziness, but it still goes down fairly easy. Good balance, tasty. 4.5"
"D: 10.3% isnt exactly the biggest beer but this beer just disappears after every sip. super super smooth and lucious. bitterness compliments the big malts really well. i could down this whole bottle in 30 minutes"
"Overall a very good beer, I have been looking forward to trying this one for a while. I would drink this one again in a heart beat."
"D: Way high. One of the best RISs I've had. I liked better than Abyss and Oak Aged Yeti. Where's the alcohol? I'd track this down again and I'm glad I bought another bottle to share with friends and family in CA."
"The beer is thick, more carbonated than expected and has a nice dry finish from the hop profile. The alcohol is definitely present, but adds to the flavors more than it takes away. After one glass the alcohol becomes more apparent for sure, reminding me that this is a heavy-hitter. The flavors make this a beer I wish was more readily available, I would like to drink this more often."
"'09 pour at the Feb Portland BA tasting at Beer Mongers. This might be the most balanced RIS I've ever had. Hops are present in the nose and in the first part of the taste, with an amazing roaste, chocolate, and coffee synthesis immediately following. Incredibly unique and pleasurable. This absolutely delivers on the hype. Awesome beer."
"What a wonderful RIS...I'll say it again. Thick, yet creamy and smooth. Very little carbonation which is ideal for this beer. Alcohol is well hidden at times, and very warming at other times which I found intriguing."
"2009 is pretty much the same with more hop profile in the taste. hasn't really evolved in a year."
"Superb drinking experience...mouthcoating, masaaging the palate with a strikingbalance of full rich dark cocoa, chocolate, smooth malt and yet a lightness on the palate that makes you take sip after sip and want more, perhaps due to the euphoria of a near perfect beer. Many tahnks to tizzod for the beer trade."
"The drinkability on this beer decreases as it warms. While not overpowering, the alcohol creeps in as the bottle dwindles."
"Notes: Drank this side-by-side with the '09, but did not review that vintage. The intensity of the dark fruits and sugary sweetness in the '08 separated that year from the '09. Additionally, the '09 had a hop bitterness than was not present in the '08."
"Overall great beer, but I like the 09 a little better. The only score I would change would be to give the 08 a 4.0 for taste (A- overall). Very different flavors, but both good in their own way. Really enjoyed trying these side by side."
"4.5/5/4.5/4/4"
"When I ordered it, I was presented with a 10oz goblet of very dark brown beer, with a luxurious looking half inch of head. The smell is right away of toasted malt with dark chocolate, can't quite put my finger on some of the other flavors, but very complex. I was surprised when I tasted it, very thick and syrupy. I taste toasted malt right away, much like the smell. After that passes, I get an explosion of other flavors, chocolate, expresso, I might even taste some fig in there. It took me a few sips to get a grasp for all that was going on. Good taste, but a lot of toasted malt and a bit of alchohol taste are going on. I was not a big fan of the mouthfeel of this one. I'm all for thick imperial stouts, but somehow this one was much more syrupy than I liked, it felt a little to sticky sweet in my mouth. The drinkability is good enough. Some alchohol presense, and a bit syrupy, but it can't be all bad as I still had two and considered a third. Good beer, didn't live up to my expectations though."
"The first sips reveal dark roasted malts, quickly followed by a big citrus hops. The hops have tropical notes to them mango, peach, and alot of orange is coming through. It's almost like a big black IPA in terms of the hoppiness. It has a nice roasty finish that leaves me wanting another sip. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style smooth and creamy with the perfect amount of carbonation. There's not a hint of alcohol in this if not for a slight warming sensation I wouldn't know if it was there at all. I don't think I'll have a problem finishing this bottle at all. Very imteresting and complex beer. Glad I had the chance to try it."
"Overall, a truly exceptional RIS. One of the best beers I've ever had and a great example of the style. I'm really glad I have another one in the cellar and I'm excited to see how it ages. Great job Surly!"
"This is a top-notch RIS."
"2008 bottle. Lots of rich sweet yet bitter black strap molasses character with a shot of espresso. There's some milk chcoclate that comes out in the middle and it finishes with a long bitter black coffee finish. There was a hint of soy I didn't care much for though. The body is sticky and full with moderate carbonation."
"D: I don't know how but the hop character works amazingly well for this beer. Very well balanced and perfectly executed, this one was the highlight of the night for me. What keeps it from being a 5 for me here is that I feel like I gotta be ready for this one. However, there's no doubt the hype is deserving of this beer here."
"Trader's note: Thanks 2 beerhandy for hand delivering a bottle from Darkness Day."
"In all honesty, I didn't think I was going to like this beer. Even though it is so highly rated, I thought I would find it too much. It showed me a thing or two..."
"Had this beast a few times now, but this review is from a bottle. (which was a bit different from when I had it on tap, not as good IMO, but still awesome.) 2008 vintage. Pours a syrupy black into a tulip. Thin tan head. This one is dark! Smells of some ripe dark fruits and then the chocolate. Lots of chocolate. Taste is similar- lots of deep bitter chocolate with some light coffee aromas too. The winner here is the mouthfeel, though! A super-creamy delight. As close to a beer milkshake as you can get. This is outstanding. The alcohol is well hidden behind all the chocolate goodness, so it makes it very drinkable."
"One of the most interesting and unique (and pleasurable) beer experiences i've encountered. If you can get your hands on it, savor every drop! i want more! more I say!"
"D: D: The booze is hidden very well by the myriad of flavors that are present. I wish, however, that this was more RIS like and not basically a black DIPA."
"Overall this is has got to be one the best and most unique Imperial Stouts out there. Not one particular flavor or tone dominates another allowing for exceptional complexity and uniqueness. Thanks again to Chuck for being so generous and helpful in allowing this experience to take place. And let's not forget Kevin for providing the Darkness snifters to fully round out this experience. A Must Try."
"But the flavor - after the requisite toasty/roasty/chocolate and coffee notes - surprised me with hints of cherry and old pipes (tobacco). I was impressed. This is a fabulous addition to the family of American Imperial Stouts of the first order."
"D: This is a nearly perfect RIS; the alcohol is so well-masked; it is smooth, dark, creamy, and so damn delicious. Mmmm."
"Tremendous beer, very flavorful and very drinkable despite its strength and depth of flavor. Many many thanks to BuckeyeNation for sending this my way purely as a gift, happy new year my friend."
"More like a black DIPA (did I just make a new style?) than a RIS, but who really cares about conforming to style. This is a very interesting beer and fun to drink on a purely hedonistic level."
"D: One of the best beers I have ever tried. Alcohol does sneak up on you though."
"First off this is some dark stuff so the name fits. Black thick liquid with a small tanish head. Smells most delicios kinda chocolaty almost like the black death coffee we get at work. Taste has so much going on it is hard to nail it down every sip is something new from caramel to dark fruits to slight piney hops. Mouthfeel was nice smooth with a little bite I liked it, it was rough around the edges. As for drinkability man oh man all night if I could and didn't have to work in the morning. Well hidden 10 percent deffinatly a beer worth tracking down on tap."
"As good as any, joins a few other in setting the bar. Wicked smooth, rich, and complex. Just plain decadent. Wow. Yum. ...Thanks again to BuckeyeNation for making this experience possible."
"play on playa... this is it."
"Wow popped a bottle last night for GBS#169 and wow all I can say is try this beer. The flavors just keep coming. Creamy smooth desert stout with fudge chocolate goodness.Dark Lord bow down to the Darkness. This is hands down one of the best stouts I have ever tasted! Alcohol well hidden and dangerously drinkable. This is a must try for any beer connoisseur! 98 vintage.."
"This one pours almost black and totally opaque, with a one-inch tan head. Smells moderately of chocolate and coffee. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, molasses, and oreo cookie, the cookie part. A first-rate combination of flavor. Mouthfeel is outstanding, a creamy smooth feel, almost as if it was from a nitro tap. Very drinkable for a beer this big. This one walks with the big boyz."
"The flavor is pine resin hops with an upper moderate level of bitterness. I detect chocolate and a light roast, as well as some astringency. The hops are very aggressive, and they seem to clash with the traditional RIS flavors at every turn. This is a return to the hoppiness of the 2007 vintage, but the hops seem to clash here, where they melded nicely in the older vintage. What I have before me is a rather strange beer that isn't particularly drinkable or enjoyable, apart from the hoppy novelty factor."
"Creamy, thick and rich brew that went down fairly easy considering the high abv."
"Drinkability is good, very smooth and pleasant to slowly sip on."
"Overall, I would say this one was a great beer but didn't live up to the hype. Maybe it's better on tap? Not saying it's a bad beer but it's not mind blowingly good or anything. I enjoyed it though. Thanks Brad!"
"i was number 326th in line for this years darkness and i was there the year before also. Just the fact that i waited three and a half hours to get it makes it taste even better. It pours thick in the glass with little head at first then forms a thin layer that emits a lovely aroma of dark fruit, sweet malt and a little hops. The taste is bold and full of strong malt with raisins and a linger of chocolate. It is a very nice beer for a cold winter night just after a long day of snow boarding."
"As high as the alcohol is, it is amazing at how well it is hidden. Full bodied, rich, creamy, and nicely carbonated. Nicely drinkable for such a big beer. I wouldn't change a thing."
"D: As I said above, it's not the best imperial stout I've had, but I think it's solid. I expected it to be awful, and it turned out to exceed my expectations. I seemed to be the only one at the tasting who enjoyed it even this much, which surprised me. Normally I'm the Negative Nancy at these tastings."
"The mouthfeel is thick, resiny, and oily. Slightly chalky finish. Slight warming feeling from the alcohol. This beer is hurt by the overboard of hops for the drinkability. Overall it seemed like there was too much going on, but I'd like to see how this tastes with some age on it when those hops calm down."
"This beer lives up to the hype."
"Overall this is a very different stout than I'm used to because the floral and citrus notes are in the forefront right now with the stout flavors in the back. I'm going to give my 2nd bottle a year in the cellar and see how it develops."
"Drinkability: I really can't tell this is over 10% at all. Despite how thick it is, it is very easy to drink. Overall, not a typical RIS at all considering the lower roasted character and the citrus hops, but quite exceptional."
"D - Potent, but delicious. A good contemplative sipper."
"Tastes of sweet grapes, prune, bit of chocolate, and plenty of roasty and herbal elements. Earthy, sticky, cookielike, and doughy finish. Full bodied, a bit chewy, silky, medium carbonation. I had heard the 2009 was a return to ""hoppy goodness," but I actually prefer the 2008 version without so many herbal flavors in it."
"Surly is a local brewery that is known for its hop packing. I was less than thrilled with in my first experience (Furious for a non-IPA fan) but even that grew on me with it's complexity. Very solid brewery."
"D: I remember asking myself while I was drinking this, is this an A beer? I was able to finish the bomber myself over the course of the day, but wish that I had someone to share it with at times. I also was not super keen on the amount of hoppiness in this stout. Something I would surely have"
"The mouthfeel is silky smooth and extraordinarily well-carbonated. nice and thick as well."
"D: If it weren't so limited and so strong, I would drink this all night. The best Russian Imperial Stout I have ever tasted. I can't wait to see what they taste like in a few years."
"J"
"All in all a top notch stout that shows you can do big bold flavors without making it a flammable bourbon barrel aged brew. Reminds me of an amped up Victory Storm King Stout."
"D: Excellent, but not something to have too many of."
"Would I drink it again? Yes, I sure hope so."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I would love to try one with some age to see what happens as the hops fade."
"This is one of the better RISs out there, no doubt."
"D: Very good. Not the best RIS I've ever had, but I can see what the fuss is about. A very good, high quality beer that tastes great and drinks easily."
"D: Very satisfying, a tiny bit boozy as it warms. I would have to be in a special mood to get through 22oz of this... perhaps in my library, in front of a roaring fire, my pipe and slippers at hand, my faithful hound dozing by the hearth."
"D = This just wasn't all that drinkable for me. I enjoy both sweet imperial stouts and bitter imperial stouts. I really do not particularly care for extremely strong C hops flavors clouding up the issue though. I drank my glass, but really did not particularly want another one. I may see about trying this again if it has been aged some, but I do not think I will seek out a fresh bottle."
"D: I wish I could drink a lot more of this, this beer is ridiculously drinkable for its high abv. The sweetness is nicely balanced with the hoppy profile and it makes for an incredibly complex RIS. Can't wait to get my hands on a few bottles of this!"
"D - I wouldn't be able to drink much of this. Decent beer, not my cup of tea."
"As always an exception brew, not only local but nationally a great beer that must be tried...if you can get your hands on it."
"O: I prefer the taste because of the lower hop character (compared to the bottle), but I would still like to see more chocolate character. This remains a treat, and I felt very lucky that I managed to get this on tap to compare. Great beer, can't wait for 2010."
"D - Can't believe it's 10%+. Way too easy to drink, sessionable stout. Even those who have a hard time drinking stouts could get this one down with no problem."
"D- It's pretty easy drinking considering the ABV, although very much a sipper. The alcohol got to me after awhile. The taste really lingers on your palate for awhile after drinking it. Overall a great, unique beer and I'm glad I got the chance to try it."
"Drinkability: The combination of tasty flavours and citrusy hop resins make the alcohol almost unbeknownst to the consumer."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and smooth with a small bite of carbonation."
"Overall, a damn great beer. I love this RIS and glad I have more. If you like hoppy RISs this is the beer for you. I am very impressed with this years batch."
"M/D - This is thick and frothy beer. A great mouthfeel, but it is way to thick to be extremely drinkable. One bottle is going to take me a while to finish, but I'm enjoying every sip."
"Had this at Darkness Day 2009. The new vintage is less sweet and has a balanced finish. Not cloying like some of this ilk can be for me. It poured ink-black and had a substantial, dark-tan head. Carbonation is dead on. Rich, peaty flavor and characteristic sweetness nicely balanced by a hoppy finish. Exceptional brew. Best Darkness yet."
"I'm really hoping the syrupy sweetness really mellows out in the cellar because otherwise this will turn into a sugary mess. I'm still happy to have tried this year's vintage."
"the bottle pours a kind of stealth head: at first it seems to be making no head, so then I pour a bit harder, and we get a bit of progress; then the whole thing explodes with this slow moving, creeping foam. I think at the most it was three fingers, it retains well enough. the colour of the foam is a solid tan colour, and the texture is very creamy. the body is indeed dark, but some light does get through the bottom. the nose is simply malts with bitter hops, quite hoppy actually. the taste is quite like the nose: a very hoppy RIS with a huge malty keel. aside from the hops, it is pretty standard tasting for my palate. a bit of something sweet, like cherries, on the aftertaste. the feel is good, pretty thick, but not as much as dark lord."
"D: Almost unbelievably good. Very balanced. The composition is like a symphony - carefully orchestrated with everything at its proper place."
"Watch yo ABVz"
"had on tap at cafe 28 in a surly darkness goblet the pour was pitch black with a blackberry ring and a thin head it did have sticky lacing all around the goblet the smell was dark currants coffee toffee and dark fruits chocolate and vanilla bean..WOW the taste is all of the b4 mentioned but as it warmed it changed in complexity it became a delight to imbibe the chocolate and coffee and fruit and hops blended to an almost dessert RIS WOW again this is by far the one of the top RIS ever made smooth complex drinkable get and taste b4 its gone"
"Drinkability:I really liked this brew, ALOT more character to this than I even expected. I'll definitely be visiting this again."
"I would call the 10 the ""balanced version"""
"*originally reviewed on 10-08-2008"
"Drinkability: Would definitely have this again regardless of its popularity. I would recommend this to those who like a dark malt and roasted brew with subtle hints of black licorice and vanilla."
"On tap Darkness Day '09 at Surly then again with lunch at Stub and Herb's. Pours opaque with a shallow foamy dark brown head that fades slowly leaving stringy patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is timid. Some hints of dark chocolate, cherry and roasted malt. The taste has a nice complexity to it. A slight bitterness of dark chocolate and hops along with the roasted malt and a hint of cherry. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and smooth with a tanginess from the alcohol. The texture coats some but is not super dense or oily. It cleans up quicker than i anticipated that it would. A really nice drinker, the 10.3% ABV is well integrated."
"My original review was deleted due to the system crashing. I don't remember exactly what I said, but here are my general thoughts. I had the '08 a few months ago and wasn't necessarily liking it a whole lot. Thought it had a lot going for it but in the end was just too sweet. The '09 is a completely different beast though. Big and very hoppy, with the sweetness merely adding complexity rather than dominating. My original rating was a 3.9 B+, but I have updated it to reflect the '09"
"A great stout I would stand in line for it. The glass went down dam easy. I didn't get any hint of the alcohol seeing it was a 10%brew. I would gladly drink it again. big thanks to Packforever1976 for hooking me up"
"All in all, a great experience and I look forward to hopefully trying this one again. It is really good and thanks to Corey once again for his generous inclusion. I'll get you back, you wait."
"This is one of the most complex, flavorful and drinkable Imperial Stouts I've ever had and possibly one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of sampling. All I can say is WOW. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is amazing. This is a great brew and one I can't wait to have again. I can't wait for Darkness Day to purchase my limit in bottles. I would love to see how this is a couple years down the road, maybe even one day do a vertical. Surly does it again, but was there ever any doubt?"
"Very smooth to sip. A really well made beer worthy of the hype."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is great. This one is about a year old, and the flavors have melded perfectly. Would really like to compare this to a fresh bottle, but couldn't wait to pop it open. Just a great example of the style. Skal."
"Overall, really happy with this one. Definitely didn't disappoint. The mouthfeel was spot on and the taste was close behind. Highly recommended."
"D: Pretty damn good. Big tasty RIS here. Looking forward to the new batch."
"D - Well, the consistency is similar to oil, but the fact that it's so tasty increases the drinkability quite a bit."
"2008 Bottle was just like 2007 bottle except it had a lot more dank hops in the aroma and taste. This doesn't change my overall review. Solid brew."
"Poured a very dark brown/black with a tan head. Smelled of chocolate, toffee and coffee. The Taste was great! This stout is very drinkable. The chocolate malt doesn't over-power the beer. And the Coffee and toffee flavors round it out perfectly! Very easy across your tongue and I could put down a bottle of this for sure. Not too much at all!"
"D - Very easy to drink for the style. I will revisit in another six months or so to see how it's coming along. All in all, a great RIS, worthy of the rating and hype."
"This is the creamiest, smoothest mouthfeel that I have encompassed. Very interested to see what some more time will do to this. Glad I got the chance to try it. Interested to see where this goes."
"D-Could drink one of these every day and I would be in beertopic bliss. It sets the bar."
"Poured a deep black with decent carbonation and a small brown head. Nose is rather funky here. Dried fruits, alcohol, roastiness, cocoa. taste is dried fruits like prunes, raisines, figs and some cocoa with a subtle roasted malt. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected and I have no idea where th high ABV is? Not feeling this brew at all."
"This beer is just full of soul. No demonic connotation implied, but this thing has character. If you can get your hands on it, do so."
"1200th rating! Draft (08 version). Pours black with only a small ring of head. Aroma of sweet malt and some bitter hops as well. Rather indistinct aroma actually. Flavor is very sweet and malty, but not the roasted malt that I'm used to in imperial stouts. It was a very odd experience, and I thought this seemed more like an ASA to me. Overall it was alright, but certainly on the sweet side. I would like to try this again though."
"Overall, great great beer. I wish some of the subtle flavors had been a little more prominent, but overall it packs a punch both in flavor and ABV."
"D- easy enough to drink but i dont think i could have had more than two without wanting to switch to something else. nice to see this one on tap again in this area. it had been a while. not the greatest stout of the fest, but nothing to pass on either"
"Drinks pretty easy, didnt have a problem finishing this at 11AM. Could have had more of it too!!"
"This beer fills me with fantastic terrors I never knew before. I hope it raps and taps on my chamber door, forever more..."
"D- Complex, smooth and damn tasty."
"Pours a thick syrupy dark brown/black with 2 fingers of thick mocha tan head into a large snifter. Great retention and lacing. Smells of citrus hops, dark fruits, chocolate, anise, roasted malt, and leather. Tastes of pineapple, chocolate, and dark fruits like plums, figs, and raisins, cocoa powder, caramel, vanilla, roasted malt, leather, and anise with a hint of coffee and herbal in the finish. Full body with low carbonation. Thick and syrupy, sweet with lots of dark fruit and chocolate flavors. Smooth and creamy with a nice bitterness but not too potent. Pretty unique even amongst the other big Russian Imperial Stouts. Very drinkable and a great sipping treat."
"Truly a RIS. Up there with dl or speedway stout."
"O - Simply amazing. The most balanced and complete beer I have had. Thanks to Gregc for opening this. It was fantastic."
"75cl bottle shared by illidurit. Pitch black with a thick, dense tan head. The aroma is a burst of tropical pineapple hoppiness. There is some underlying chocolate malt as well, but the pineapple runs the show. The flavor has some bittersweet chocolate countered by tons of fruity mango and pineapple, finishing dry and hopy, but with a very smooth and restrained bitterness. Full and decadently smooth texture, but not overly thick or sticky. This is just an amazing stout. Awesome chocolate covered tropical fruit synergy."
"One to savor and enjoy slowly. You couldn't kill a bottle of this if you tried."
"D: Excellent beer, though not quite as drinkable as Dark Lord. Very, very deserving of its high place of honor. I cannot wait for this summer to get out to Minnesota and sample all the Surly I can find."
"Overall an amazing imperial stout from Surly. Im not sure which batch I like better, but they both are killer beers. If you like big thick monsterous viscous collosal ultra galactic beast stouts, this will be right up your alley. Thanks again to Aaron for hookin a brotha up with this oft desired brew."
"Poured into a chalice a deep black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, which leaves some nice oil slicks and some sticky lacing behind. The nose is sweet, malty, lots of chocolate/toffee, some roastyness, vanilla. The taste is pretty sweet, malty, very nice touch of chocolate/toffe, with some slight roasty note. Medium body, the ABV is hidden pretty well with this one. Very drinkable, this is an awesome brew, glad to finally get a chance to try it."
"2008 vintage, courtesy of DbHog (an awesome trader). Beer #5 in the ""Motha of all Stout Tastings."" Pours two shades shy of black with rubye highlights around the edges. Half inch mocha-colored cap embedded with ringlets - generous head recedes into a swirl. Glass was coated with delicate strands of lacing during the tasting. Nose is hoppy - enough said. Taste is really interesting and was difficult to tease out - a full malt bill mixed with citric acid, artificial sweetener, grapefruit and some booze towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slightly viscous. A complex and interesting beer, but a bit off-style in my opinion."
"Delicious beer and it's not hard for one to become two. The sweetness holds me back a bit, but still a damn good beer."
"M: velvety. mellow carbonation level. full bodied."
"Pitch black color with a cascading cocoa colored head. Tons of sticky lace and retention like mousse. Aroma is extremely hoppy with monstrous fresh cut pineapple notes. Not really any stout character, but it works. Flavor is decadent chocolate covered candied pineapple with a light roasted finish. Palate is very dry and smooth. Perfect carbonation. The body is not overly thick and there's not alcohol at all. Insane drinkability."
"Having said that, I treasure the opportunity to try Darkness. If you should get the chance, judge it on its own merits, and savor the moment. Skol."
"Great beer. I'm priviledged and grateful that I had the chance to try it."
"A fantastic RIS that I will seek out again in the future. I would be curious to see how age mellows the hops and changes this brew."
"This beer did not live up to the hype. There is something missing in the balance here. I don't mind a really hoppy stout, but the overt sweetness was too much. There needs to be more of a dry roasted character, and beyond that some more complexity. Again, this was alot like the Stone 11th Anniversary, althogh I would say that was balanced more perfectly than this. Worth a try, but otherwise overrated..."
"Appearance is well, I don't think it can get much better. Blacker than coffee, nice head and a bit of lacing. Smell and Taste are pretty similar. Lots of dark fruit, fig is most prominent, but side notes of cherries, raisins and plums. Taste is a bit more pronounced and a bit of the hops come through on the back end. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy- like drinking a cappucino. Drinkability is really good for the style."
"the palate is quite sweet... almost to cloying but the power of the hops make it a bit easier to enjoy. the flavor shares the characters of the aroma but also has some woodiness and a distinct savory note. there is a long lingering aftertaste of malted chocolate malted milk with pine needles in it. medium to medium/full bodied with a creamy almost oily mouth feel. pine-like and leafy hops keep it really easy to drink and bring it back from the brink of sticky...8/4/7/4/17/4.0"
"this beer is extremely well made. I couldn't manage more than one of these in a night. it is a silent ninja. sneaky mother fucker has kicked me in the face. well done sirs well done."
"For fear of nothing else coming close."
"Drinkability: Good, the 2011 batch was a big improvement over 2010."
"Big thanks again to Travis for giving me the chance to try my first Surly in a bottle. What a treat!"
"Goes down incredibly easy, and I have to say it was well worthwhile standing in that freezing line. Believe the hype."
"Black black black with a medium brown head that is small and only stays as a little fuzz. Laces medium well. Smells like mangos, chocolate syrup, and molasses. Bright, complex, and fun. Silky smooth body, sweet, stale coffee, and cocoa. A little heavy and sweet on the tongue, and the flavors fail to challenge me or stand out from others of this style. Overall this is an enjoyable beer, but it lacks that special something that makes it stand out from the rest. It's smoothness is pleasant, but is not what I look for in an imperial stout."
"Darkness seems to coat your mouth and throat with on the way down, and the mouthfeel is viscous and smooth. It would certainly be hard to polish off a lot of darkness in one short sitting, but when put into perspective of ones expectations for imperial stouts, this is an easy drinker. I only wish that I could have taken a little more time to enjoy darkness, but alas there were many fine beverages to sample at winterfest."
"Overall, a disappointment especially when factoring what I traded to get it. For me, it was WAY too sweet. Even after it really warmed up, it was still off the chart. It's only 4 months old so can't be over-aged and can't imagine further aging would cut the sweetness any more. No real hop presence as-is and that would fade over time. Really disappointed in this one. Love all the Surly's that I've had but this one is a miss for me. Still can't get over that it's because of being too sweet - like sugar water. If you'd said too raisiny or too much alcohol I'd have believed that but not this. May try another batch in the future but probably one and done for me unless a unique circumstance applies."
"The body is rather light for the depth and strength of the beer, and with a nice carbonation that creates a continuous agitation of flavors this has an overall soft and inviting feel. Well balanced and pleasing. The alcohol warmth slows down the drinking a bit but the flavors are so nice and the body so soft that this is definitely a keeper...if i could ever get another glass."
"Drinkability is a 4 instead of 5 because in my mind it is not intended as an all-nighter. This is a finishing beer. Like a fine port. The strong willed can put down a bottle and will feel the part. But for me it is a wonderful strong ale that is complex in all aspects."
"Overall, this is an extremely drinkable beer and one of my favorites from the night. I will continue my search for me and hope to make it to the Darkness event next time. This was at the top with Dark Lord at our event."
"The body is a bonus. Very thick and chewy. A lot of depth overall with a creamy texture. So do you buy the hype? Not really. The sweetness is a huge distraction and the finishing hops are too strong. But one thing I will give this beer though, it will age nicely. See you in a few years."
"2008 Three months old - Pours a beautiful pitch black that is completely opaque. A heavy two inch dark tan/caramel head proudly crowns this masterpiece. The large head very slowly and reluctantly recedes. Smells of chocolate, coffee, licorice, alcohol and hops complete the nose. Tastes of dark chocolate, coffee grinds, raisins, tobacco and ""licorice...yeah black licorice"" add to the amazing complexity. One of many amazing aspects of this beer is the mouthfeel which I can only describe as complete milkshake. An intense hop presence separates this puppy from the other top RIS's in the world. It does not get any better than this. Big, bold, beautiful...if this beer doesn't make your pecker hard, you are likely gay and need to go back to wine."
"Pours midnight black with plenty of brown head. Nose of soy sauce, and all of the hops that I have been told that are in this beer. The flavor is different to say the least. It starts of with some maple, then slips into a big date or fig finish. I get all the hops in the finish as well. Full body but it seems to be easily drinkable. Gosh...believe the hype."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer ... it's just not quite as good as I thought it would be, and though I try not to take off points for expectations, I may have in a few spots here. There's plenty of good here - it's big, it's bold, it's complex, it's pleasantly well-hopped, and the alcohol's well-hidden. On the other hand, the alcohol's pretty high, the aroma is a little lackluster, and it's pretty crazy sweet. The verdict: it's a winner. Is it worth $16? Probably. Would I try it again? Yes. If you get the chance to trade for it, should you? Definitely."
"D - This is a standout beer and one of the top rated active bottled beers by style."
"Dark and beautiful with a creamy tan head and very solid retention. Sticky chunks of lacing down the glass. Smell is interesting. Creamy dark chocolate with a touch of roast, along with an evident hop presence underneath. It brings forth a spicy scent. Pretty rich of molasses. Taste is just over-the-top sweet for my liking. Again, big time molasses and in an overwhelming fashion. Some dark fruits as well. A slight hint of roast and definite hops again attempt to find balance but just help to forget about the sweet for a second. In the mouth it's creamy and smooth, not too bad by any means. Sadly, this is not one that I enjoyed so much. I'm just glad it wasn't wasted, as I shared it with a couple people. Maybe after a year or more, this one would lose some of its sweetness and find a bit more balance. Cheers to Bill for sending yet another Surly brew my way!"
"This beer kind of gives new meaning to the phrase ""demon in a bottle", as this beastly beer possessed my soul from the get go and didn't let go until the last drop was drained from the glass. Powerful feeling and complex, this is up there in rarified top RIS status for me. I will say that this definitely came off as much sweeter than other top picks in the style but I didn't mind at all. There was enough bitterness to keep it in check, plus I really liked how this aspect differentiated it from some of the other top Imperial Stouts out there. This was awesome stuff that I'm really happy to have finally been able to sit down and enjoy a full bottle of it."
"Drinks a might bit, slow, the dryness & complexity slow me down some. Still, a very good RIS indeed. Well done Surly!"
"Notes: I really wanted to like this beer but it's an imperial stout in the vein of the sweeter ones - DWF WWS, Dark Horizon (both beers being superior) and in some respects, the Mikkeller Black. If you like these beers, you'll go apeshit over this but honestly, I'm not really a fan."
"Great beer and i am thrilled to have had the opportunity to try, now we just need a barrel aged version!!"
"M + D: Very rich and sticky... big molasses like consistency. To date, I don't believe I've come across something quite this thick. It can get quite sweet after a while, but it's certainly a very good flavour and aroma. Quite pleased with this one, and it moves away from a trend of a couple weaker offerings."
"I had this at the EBF last Feb and recall thinking it similar to Stone RIS (a solid compliment). Not at all the case from the bottle a couple months earlier. I'd like to try this straight from the source at release as I think the hops truly make this beer. Not quite as complex as I'd hoped but still top notch."
"Overall, a stellar imperial stout and another very fine effort from Surly. Well worth seeking this one out if nothing else than for its uniqueness amongst its peers in the imperial stout category."
"One of my top five beers to date. Fantastic. Almost perfection in a bottle. Close. Will re-review next November."
"Drinkability: New Year's eve, and it is time to break out this special occasion beer; for me, it lived up to the hype; unlike other hoppy stouts where the bitter flavors battle with the malt, in this beer, the blending of the contrasting flavors is unique"
"Overall: absolutely awesome"
"Farewell Darkness, it's been swell."
"Overall an incredible version of the style of RIS!"
"D: Every sip seems to tilt the flavors back and forth between slightly bitter fruitiness and sweeter malt/chocolate. Finish has a slight medicinal taste but overall the alcohol blends very nicely into the beer. An amazing RIS no doubt, but (while not the same beer) I still prefer something like The Abyss for example over this."
"Maybe a bit thin. Lower carbonation. Intesesting, but not my taste. Too much sweetness, with too much hop flavor."
"Drinkability is so high here because you cannot taste any alcohol or feel any in the back of the throat."
"My numbers seem critical even to me, but since 2.0 is ""not impressed"" and I'm definetely not impressed, i gave it a 2.5. I'm not down on Surly at all; I love their other offerings."
"Don't really like the huge hops and the out of whackiness. I will save my other bottles a few years and try again once the hops surrender some."
"This is EASILY my favorite beer that I have ever drank up to this point. I get giddy when I go somewhere and see it on the beer list. I hope they bottle more of this and ship it to Chicago next year. I have to give this all 5's until I can find something that proves me wrong."
"This badboy just went on my ""wants"" list. Yum."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. A little too sweet to drink a full bottle by yourself, but great to split with a friend. A great dessert beer."
"Black, nearly opaque, with dark brown edges. A fluffy brown cap appeared after the pour, producing sticky, clumpy lace all the way down the glass. Great aroma, a combination of floral and citrus hops (mostly grapefruit and orange) with roast and burnt malts. Notes of cocoa and dark chocolate, biscuit, and anise wafted in and out. Solid bitterness, more grapefruit hop character, with lots of chocolate, caramel, and toffee. Quite sweet overall. Plenty of dark malts gave it a moderate roast flavour. Full bodied, kind of on the heavy side, with lowish carbonation, very fine bubbles, creamy texture, alcohol warmth, and just a bit sticky. Super delicious and much more balanced than I was expecting."
"Overall: I was actually expecting this beer to be overhyped, but it definitely lived up to the world class standards presented here on BA. Not your typical RIS, to say the least, and displays a multi-faceted array of flavors that my palate got excited over. If I had to sum up this beer in a few words, it would be: Unique, smooth, and yummy! A smile beer and a must try. Cheers!"
"Edit (3/6/10): Remove Kate from top pick, 2010 was just as much of a cloyingly syrupy sweet mess."
"drinkability is good. nice balance and great depth, with a bit of lingering sweetness. excited to see how this one will change with time."
"the taste is simply WOW. very malty, very sweet and you can absolutely taste the alcohol (which is 10%+). there is the roasted malt taste and the earthy and woodsy tastes as well. Mouthfeel was surprising nice with a bit of a sharp alcohol taste."
"I've had this twice on tap now, and I still find it a bit curious, especially when compared to FFF Dark Lord. Dark Lord has a huge, huge viscous mouthfeel, somewhat like Bell's Expedition Stout. Darkness is not as thick or heavy, but it has a very looong, rich mouthfeel. You just can't gulp it. Each sip just keeps on going and going. As a homebrewer, I think that Dark Lord's weight is due to the heavy use of oats, crystal malt, and a high mash temperature. But as to what makes Darkness have such a long mouthfeel, I'm genuinely flummoxed."
"If this were available for $6.99 at BevMo, I'd say it were a tasty, unique beer. But considering the acclaim and rarity, I think it strays too far from the style."
"Overall: Seriously the best I have had in the last 3 years where I have tried hundreds of different beers. Wish I could get it easier!"
"I had this in bottle form, side-by-side against Sexual Chocolate, Dark Lord, and Kate the Great. In this contest Darkness came out the favorite for all 3 drinkers. The citrus flavors were the deciding factor, it seemed like this was a RIS with DIPA genes. I'll plan to attend future Darkness days to get as many bottles as I can."
"2010: May be my favorite of the last 3 years. Flavors all seem in the right place."
"Drinkability: Excellent melding of full flavors wrapped up in a dense, creamy body. I wasn't disappointed. Nice work, Surly."
"Overall: The very best RIS I have ever had. Do whatever you can to get your hands on this miraculous beer. I love Surly."
"Overall. Believe the hype. It's that fucking good. I try to share my beers with the girlfriend but I wound up taking down half her glass when she walked away from it. I should've never shared with her."
"D- It was very easy to drink and highly recommended. This has to be the most hoppy RIS ever made which made this one pretty interesting and different."
"D - Very balanced for such a large beer."
"Overall an exceptional RIS that's too sweet for me."
"d= very high except for the wicked buzz you get! amazing beer! this is the first of this style that i have ever had and i was very impressed! it had such a great surlys taste to it of just fresh beer! i love it so much!"
"opaque. wonderful head. chocolate color... thick with little bubbles lots of lace. very high sugar content sticky on the outside of the glass when dries. quite thick. molasses, raisins and toasted apple pie. palate is toasted malt apple caramel sweet. head keeps coming back on agitation. goes down like mead. light hop chive like finish. a wonderful blend of all of this styles capacity but i could see the sweetness being a turn off for some. this may also be an extremely fresh keg. i would really like to see this cellared to bring out the more subtle notes. and i would kill to have it from a cask."
"I still can't wrap my head around this brew - quite unique but simply fantastic!!"
"This was delicious, complex, and unique. Up there with the best of them."
"D: Gotta ding Darkness on the drinkability front. I strained to drink a third of this bottle, but pushed myself and got it done. Not sure why it's not offered in smaller bottles. Pretty ridiculous."
"D - The lighter body made this one too easy to drink, even at 10%+ ABV. Tasty."
"Pours dark and pretty thick like last years. The smell is a bit sweeter and the hops and smoke seems less than last years. The taste is much sweeter and creamier. Hops are still at a good level but not quite a potent as before which is probably an improvement. The smoky/meaty character is much lower but still in the back. I liked the stronger smoke =. The body is much creamier and smoother than from the bottle last year. Above average drinkability but not as good drinkable at Ktg. Very good."
"This has a complex flavour profile that would put many much more expensive wines to shame, yet we are drinking for a fraction of the cost."
"D: I could drink this until my body forced me to stop. The beer was gone before I really even felt like I got to know it. The balance that this beer displays makes drinking it so easy that you almost forget about how complex it is, a beer to pay attention to, seek out, and always try again. Fantastic."
"D-Complex and big bodied but compared to last years version I was a bit let down. I was hoping for the fresh hop/massive dark roasty malt bomb and this is not it. What happened? Nothing about this years offering really excited me. Good...but lacking."
"Caught up with this at the Blue Nile in Minny. Black with huge off-beige head. Hoppy RIS.Sourness in first sip. The bitterness builds up, flows over the sugary finish. Integrated coffee, sugar to make it coffee liquor acceptable?ABove average mouthfeel. Better as warms up, was served a bit on cold side."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. It was tasty, and the booziness was masked and incorporated well enough. Overall, I'm pretty pleased but slightly disappointed."
"Smell was very malty, with sweet chocolate aromas, some molasses and caramel, and dark fruit. Taste was also quite sweet, with chocolate and roasted malt flavors, lots of caramel and chocolate sweetness. Good amount of dark fruit, too, like maybe figs and plums. I found it to be maybe a tad too sweet, which took away from the drinkability for me. It was rich and full bodied, chewy and creamy. Overall a very good, very tasty beer. Glad I got to try this on tap."
"D - The alcohol is there, of course, but it doesn't feel like a 10.3% beer. It's a really nice beer and worth every penny, but I believe this vintage just seemed too young to really appreciate right off the bat. I have a bottle that I'll be cellaring, and I'm quite sure this review will improve after I enjoy that."
"D - A beer like this is sippin and kickin - not for session."
"D - Complex RIS with an interesting flavor profile. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this style. I tend to gravitate more toward oatmeal and coffee stouts, personally. I found this one to be slightly over-rated."
"D: To paraphrase, did I really shave me legs for this? I am underwhelmed and ranked this one behind the Coronado bourbon RIS, Dark Hollow and Full Sail Black Gold. Don't believe the hype!"
"Updated review based on 2010 vintage. In short, the 2010 vintage is great, but does not have the complexities that the 2008 had. It is incredibly milky, thick, and smooth, but does not have the toffee or hop elements the 2008 had. Great, but not as good as the 2008."
"In contrast, I had Black Albert the next day on tap and it was everything I hoped for."
"Thanks treyrab for sharing thos one with me!"
"D: The 11% is the only thing that keeps this from being a 5. I can't see myself finishing a whole one of these, not that I wouldn't want to!"
"Very drinkable for this style, nothing overpowers or is out of balance, but I perfectly balanced stout. Wish they delivered their cans to Chicagoland, maybe some day."
"Pours a complete onyx black with a powerful two finger dark brown head that remains for quite sometime. After a good five minutes or so and lots of clingy spiderweb lacing on the sides of the glass, a creamy layer of goodness rests atop the black hole underneath. Smell...whoa hops. Sticky pine, bitter pink grapefruit, and raw gritty earth up front in the nose. Underneath all those hops is the dark stuff. Coffee grinds, sweet molasses, and heavy roasted malts add to the complex aroma. So much going on in the nostrils, time for a sip. Taste begins with burnt caramel, candy sugar, and smokey dark chocolate. Some booze, figs, and oily hops midway. Not nearly as much hop flavor on the tongue than were in the smell, but they're still there. Finishes with a gooey brownie batter, raspberries, and spruce. Do I dare say there's too much going on for the taste buds to function? Perhaps. Big, bold, and chewy feel with a full body and subtle carbonation. The one problem I find with the mouthfeel is the powerful bittering hop sting. Overall the 10% abv is hidden quite well, but Darkness is still a sipper. Needless to say, this is a super complex, big ass beer and definitely one of a kind. Good? Of course. Exceptional? That may be a stretch. Surly continues to produce some crazy beers, what's next??? Thanks again Dan."
"Please don't fill up my inbox with nasty beermails! Maybe I got a bottle from the bottom of a barrel, you never know... For what it's worth, I LOVE Surly's other offerings, but if you were lucky enough to acquire or trade a couple of the 08's, drink one now if you want to make a comparison after aging it for some time, but I can't say it enough - this one definitely needs some time to mature and balance out. More reviews to come..."
"Oh, it's a sipper alright, but a damn fine one at that. One of the ultimate examples of balance in overabundance and utter depth. One of the best!"
"This is my second review of this beer its much better then the first version put out. They have really improved the taste, hence why its only getting a 4 for taste if they can improve this much in this short of time they can improve much more."
"Well, this may not be the best RIS I've had, but it is probably the most original. I'd heard it was hoppy, but I just had no idea. Big thanks again to Brian and Brent for opportunity to try this gem."
"The thing that surprised me most about this one besides the hops was just how drinkable it was. I could easily have had four more glasses of this stuff with no problems at all. I'm glad I had the chance to try it, I can only hope it's a beer that eventually gets some distribution."
"D= Though I cannot say that this has toppled my favorite beers in this style, it was a real joy to drink. I found this beer to be all about the matchup of complexity vs. subtlety. It was sweet without being cloying, bitter without being too dry, high alcohol but not too hot or astringent. A great beer and one I will gladly drink again!"
"Pours dark brown out of the bottle and appears black in the glass. Well looking tan head lasts well. Aroma is mainly awful, smells mainly of socks and super citrusy hops, no malt complexity. Flavor, however, is different and quite complex. Fully flavored with an incredible malt complexity. Sweet dark fruits, with layers of chocolate, roast and coffee character. Nice mouth feel. Very nice Imperial Stout."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mellow carbonation. Not nearly as thick as many imperial stout's at this ABV, but that makes it somewhat more drinkable as well. While this isn't my favorite RIS, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and the fact that it's quite hoppy as well. Glad I got a chance to sample this on tap."
"on tap at the bavarian lodge in lisle, this was pitch black with a nice creamy brown head and lasting lacing. smells and tastes of dark milk chocolate, espresso, and dark dried fruit. alcohol is well-hidden. huge malt sweetness with bitterness and roastiness providing balance. finishes semi-sweet. very thick, almost reminds me of a slightly lighter-bodied and less hoppy dark lord. sweet malts are so dense they leave a stickiness on your lips. surprisingly drinkable for such a big beer."
"The body is extraordinarily well-rounded and deep. Thick, smooth, and sumptuous the mouthfeel is truly exemplary. A long, lasting, and richly clinging finish is a fine finish to this highly drinkable stout. While I don't doubt that there are betters beers and that I have many comparably favored beers left to discover I have yet to come across a beer this refined and enjoyable."
"One of the best beers that has ever crossed my lips. I wish they would brew this year round."
"Mouth is great. Thick like bywuil"
"D- This is of course high alcohol but for a Russian Impy, this goes down WAY to smooth. Very drinkable for what it is."
"D-Drinkability on a beer like this is difficult. It's easy to drink, and I'll have another in the future, but I'd be hard-pressed to drink a couple pours of this in a sitting. It's an enjoyable beer all-around, and I'll certainly keep my eyes open for this on-tap while it lasts."
"Notes from and tasted on 1/5/07."
" This beer is Great. No doubt about it. It has some very complex characteristics. With each sip you get a different taste. Cherry, vanilla, chocolate, coffee...and hops."
"What a treat for my 250th review! I'm glad I was able to enjoy this with 2 other BAs who can appreciate this beer just as much."
"D- You need to sip on this one, but it is all things dark combined in this absolutely incredible brew."
"Pours pitch black with a small head, it would be more but the sever poured very gently. Leaves a good tan lacing all the way down the glass. It smells sweet, and of roasted and burnt malts, maybe even a little maple syrup. Taste is out the window, this thing taste too good to describe. It taste like it looks and smells, great. Chewy and smooth, it warms you as soon as it crosses your lips. This beer is a must for anyone who lives or is in the twin cities area, amazing, purely amazing."
"The body is creamy, thick and fizzy. Never quite come across a body like this in a bottled beer. Delicious. Tastes like something that could be healthy. I--if I didn't know this had alcohol in it I could almost see myself giving it to a kid."
"Its very drinkable and very dangerious! If possible I would drink this all the time! Now I only wonder what my 07 taste like???"
"In the end this is a beer that everyone should have the chance to try. It definitely pushes the envelope of beer, at least for me, but can be very overpowering. Surly makes some wonderfully inventive and downright delicious beer, but this is not one of my faves."
"Drinkability- Overall I can definitely see the reason why people love this brew. It's very unique and I haven't tasted anything like this before but it's just not for me. I don't mind a little sweetness in a nice big brew but I think Darkness is just plain cloying and hard to drink. This is all very disappointing too because the nose is pretty inviting and I've been waiting quite some time to sample this. Not Surly's best beer but glad to have to opportunity to try anyways!"
"Cheers to whoever the lucky party is!"
"Surly, you've made us proud. And it was well worth the wait."
" This stuff is so good it truly is sinful. All Hail Darkness..."
"T/M: Mouthfeel is wonderful, smooth and creamy. The thing about Darkness is that for a RIS, everything is so clean, so crisp, so drinkable, yet loaded with flavor. Starts off with the dark chocolate fading to cherry liquor, and a nice dose of hop spiciness comes through right at the end, just enough so you know it's there and balances the beer perfectly"
"I was surprised to taste that the hops 'still' had so much flavor. Thick and viscous in body, sticky hop and plumy chocolate. The bitter hops and bitter chocolate played so nicely together. The image of chocolate raisins dipped in hop lava kept racing through my brain as I slowly enjoyed this. My mouth filled with fumes of phenol and lovely hops. Definitely full bodied and full figured yet not cloying at all. Sticky, resinous hoppy finish that seemed to never end. Crazy drinkable...I could have enjoyed all of the 750mLs myself in 1 setting."
"This is subtle complex and it really grew on me as I worked my way through the beer; there is definitely lots of things going on in this beer and it is one of the better Imperial Stouts I have had in a while."
"Notes: My least favorite beer from Surly so far, I'm sorry to say. It's unique, and possibly even worth trying given the chance, but it's not worth all the hoopla."
"This brew really reminded me why I love Russian Imperial Stouts so much...Probably my all time #3 Imperial Stout after 2004 Dark Lord and 1983 Courage Russian Imperial"
"Overall, certainly a very good RIS, but I found Dark Lord superior to this one."
"Recommended."
"Taste is more chocolate, crazy vanilla, dark fruit/plums?/raisins?/figs?/berries?. Maybe a slight bit of burnt coffee. Also, a balancing amount of earthy hops. This surprised me more than anything else. Sensationally flavorful, rich thick mouthfeel, absolutely sublime."
"Dark Lord Imperial Stout, kneel before Darkness! All hail Darkness! The best American-made Russian Imperial Stout we've ever had!"
"out standing beer from surly and thanxs for the chance to try. not top ten but delicious"
"An ""A+"" rating from the Beerking!"
"Excellent beer. Very unique (and this is not an easy thing to be in the RIS category) with the delicious citric hop presence. I'd take a keg of this ;)"
"I hope to get a fresh bottle of this at the next release because I think that I might have missed some of the hop essence that makes this beer grand."
"Bottle #230. Pours black with a good size dark tan, light brown head that recedes slowly, with just a bit of lacing. Aroma is very citrusy and hoppy, oranges and tangerines, like a citrusy cotton candy. Some roasty, smoky and chocolatey notes as well, these are in the background but work extremely well with the hoppiness in the foreground. Taste is very similar to the aroma with the citrusy hops being the main player, but a very nice roasty and at times, rich chocolatey maltiness in the background. The flavors work very well together and alternate back and forth. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, very soft and full feeling, creamy carbonation is soft on the tongue, some light tingling and a bit of dryness towards the end from the hoppiness. Really, an outstanding and unique beer. I've had hoppy imperial stouts before, but this particular combination works very well together. Tastes as though it will continue to age very well, though it is extremely drinkable at present."
"Overall I would have to say this really lived up to the hype for me. It was a phenominal beer, much different then anything I had before it, and was a nice breath of fresh air in the category. I was impressed by the floral hoppiness that was brought into this, especially in the finish as it really hid the alcohol well and let you have a nice, and not super filling experience out of it. Overall would I like another bottle, absolutely! Would I travel to Minnesota to get it, if the wife would let me, in a heartbeat!"
"Thanks, bro."
"Pours dark black with a short lived tan head. Smell is chocolately, some faint cake like sweetness and some really roasty sharp, bitter hops in the nose. Some dryness. Taste is dry, roasty, and very hoppy for the style, and a bit more than I'd like. Somewhat of a meaty, roasty flavor too. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Very good, for sure, with no hint of the ABV, but not my favorite Imperial Stout."
"Pours a solid black with a good size tanish head that sticks with us for a while. Smell is the usual suspects, coffee, chocolate, a bit smokey, but with some grassy hop aroma in the distance. Taste is a bit hoppy with roast coffee, chocolate, some dried fruits. Full body, oily/creamy mouthfeel, ample carbonation. Left a slight ash aftertaste in my mouth. Great RIS I wish it were more widely available."
"D - Wuite Quaffable, like I said b4 just not my kind of beer."
"This beer was a treat compliments of Cashew70 at the Brick Store Pub. I had already had Kate the Great, Dark Lord, Speedway, the Abyss, and Ten Fidy among others and I was interested in how this stacked up. I'd previously enjoyed some of Surly's other beers on tap and had high expectations. Definitely a solid beer, but given how unbelievably difficult it is to obtain, I probably won't go to quite those lengths to procure some more, but I'm extremely glad I had a chance to taste it. Like the other great Russian Imperial Stouts, this one pours black as night with a tan head that sticks around. Maybe not quite as thick and rich looking a fresh Ten Fidy on tap, but very nice. The first aromas are of burntt roasted grains, followed by chocolate, coffee, and a nice dark but fresh fruitiness reminiscent of plums. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer is well integrated. The taste is also surprisingly fruity with more of that nice plumminess, big flavors of roasted grains and chocolatey malt, and a tad of soy sauce flavor, as well as a bit of fresh cream. The mouthfeel is not as massive as Dark Lord, or as thick, nor is it as creamy as Ten Fidy, in fact, there is a bit of slickness to to the mouth here. A very good, complex RIS. Not as massive as DL nor as creamy and luscious as Ten Fidy on tap, or as assertive as Speedway, nor as complex as Kate the Great. Stylistically, I would put his somewhere between the winey chameleon-like complexity of Kate the Great, and the massive onslaught of Dark Lord. Forr me it probably takes 4th place behind KTG, DL, and Ten Fidy on tap., but at this level I really think it's probably all about the direction one likes to see a beer go and one's personal taste."
"2008 vintage is a syrupy mess. Don't bother."
"Drinkability - awfully strong, but a stunning beer and an ideal sipper."
"Mouth feel was oily but at the same time there was a creamy lingering feel. Very nice carbonation for my preference on this style. Can't wait for next years."
"On tap: Dark in color with a roasted coffee and chocolate nose. This continues into a palate that I hoped carried a little more density. While a very nice beer I came out with the feeling that some barrel aging would smooth and fill out the midpalate."
"Oh yeah, was it better than Dark Lord? No. Dark Lord still holds the tarnished, sickly crown for this sort of thing."
"I truly am impressed. This is one of the great ones, worthy of it's ranking here. Now, I have to go find more!!!! It will be very interesting to see how it cellars."
"Amazing. I can't wait for my next - I'm hoping there'll be a Darkness pour at the upcoming Happy Gnome dinner in mid-April. That, & my wife and I will be arm-wrestling to see who watches the kids for the anticipated Halloween 2008 release."
"D - Excellent balance of sharp hoppiness and deep roasted maltiness make for a very unique and flavorful experience. More please."
"Had a 3 oz pour at Firkin Fest, Minneapolis. Very interesting overall, but I think it needs to age more. Appearance is black with a thick tan head and continuous bubbly lace. Smells big and hoppy - pine and citrus. Big sweet malt flavor with a little less hop overtone than expected from the smell. Aftertaste is malty with hint of bitterness. Mouthfeel is very syruppy coating your tongue and keeping the sweet maltiness around. Overall, I am not sure. I enjoyed it, but I don't know how much more than a 3 oz pour I would want. Interesting, but needs to age maybe to mellow out. I would love to try it again in 6 months."
"D: This ran the RIS gauntlet against aged Stone, aged Avery Czar, and Siberian Night. While an excellent & distinctive RIS, I think much of the hype comes from the limited availability. Don't get me wrong, its REALLY good, but it wasn't the favorite of the night."
"D: intense, but oh so drinkable, definitely worth it"
"D:Great rIS. Very smooth and complex. It seems like the taste comes in layers adding to the complexity. I could easily drink multiple(unfrotunately and fortunately franksandbeans has my other bottle)"
"Huge thanks to Lisalucy for the Chirstmas gift, for which she waited in line for five hours. Ah, I've raised her well. A delicious and decadent imperial stout, and yet surprisingly un-complex for the style. Malty, with molasses and chocolate notes. It was utterly lacking in that soy sauce-like quality that can detract from even the best imperial stouts, which made it smooth and drinkable and yet would have to be regarded as a by-product of that lack of complexity. Not the cascade of intensity I associate with the style, but a great beer nonetheless."
"A monsterous three inch head jumps to the top of the glass with its soft carmel colored thick bubbles. Fades very slowly leaving considerable lace behind. Body is the standard jet black beauty. Nose is shockingly hoppy up front for a big stout with hints of spicey soft malt in the backround. Enters the mouth thick and almost syrupy with a powdery coco feel. A nice balance of grassy mineral based hops quickly kicks in to even out and almost take over the flavor profile. This creates a thick milk chocolate like feel that sits on the back of the tongue followed by a long even bitter hop feel. Although this is more hoppy than what I would usually like in a stout, it is unique and very welcome. Very nicely drinkable. Alchol is well hidden. A great and worthy stout."
"This beer was much more drinkable than I expected and other comparable beers like Dark Lord. In all honesty, it tasted to me a lot like a less roasty and more approachable Leinenkugel Big Eddy RIS. Quite good, but I can't say I would stand in line 5 hours for it."
"This beer is good, but overhyped IMO. There are much better imperial stouts out there that eclipse Darkness in both complexity and drinkability. KtG, DL, and BCS are few that come out ahead IMO."
"This is a very nice RIS. It didn't ""win the night"" when lined up against a few other beers in this category. I'll admit to expecting...more."
"Doesn't get much better than this. Near perfect. Could drink this one all night."
"D: The hop aroma is out of style for this beer, but is interesting none the less. A bit more chocolate would have been nice but I'll see what happens with age."
"D: Very drinkable for the ABV. This beer was sampled VS some other RIS including Stone, Avery Czar, and Siberian Night and while it is a great beer I do not know if it is worth all of the hype. People at the tasting favored the Stone RIS with a year on it and I favored another with a few more years on it. The super limited availability I am sure has something to do with this. Great beer no doubt just don't mortgage your house to get it. That being said if you can get it reasonably definitely do so."
"I can't wait for next year! (not to mention all the other great beers from Surly in between)"
"This deserves all the hype that it has gotten and I feel honored to try a beer like this, especially after seeing how much it has sold in online auctions recently, I never would have been able to afford if it was not for this generous trader, awesome RIS that is very unique because of its in your face hoppiness, glad Surly bottled this masterpiece, I have not tasted a bad beer from them yet, Darkness was amazing and I hope to get some of next year's batch if it is available in bottles again, highly recommended if anybody wants to give up a bottle, fantastic drinking experience"
"I had Darkness on tap several times this year and enjoyed it much more. Maybe it was just my imagination but the hop bitterness from the bottle was much harsher (not in an enjoyable way) than on tap. The friend I shared it with has a bottle she is aging for at least a year and I think that bottle will be much tastier. It could use a good year in the bottle."
"In an effort to expose my family to good beer, I opened this for them, and was hoping that they would hate it. Totally selfish, I wanted the whole bottle. I could drink the entire thing easily. Get it. Drink it."
"I was fortunate to have three helpings of this sex in a snifter before it went dry in Chicago. I'm counting down the days until October 2008, when this comes back."
"This is only the second hoppy imperial stout I've ever had, and the other one (Storm King) isn't even in the same league. Drinkability is out of control, assuming you like hoppy stouts in the first place."
"Somehow..(for a Russian Imperial Stout from a brewery only a couple years old) Darkness seems refined..almost like it has been perfected over decades. An absolute delicacy in the world of craft beer."
"The mouthfeel is nice and full. This beer is extremely drinkable for a Russian Imperial Stout. It is not too sweet - in fact it is loaded with bitterness (this keg is probably young) and quite a treat for a hop lover. The alcohol is very well hidden. I had barrel-aged darkness at the Great Taste of the Midwest - and was not that impressed. This is much better."
"My first review- be kind. ;)"
"Poured into Darkness glasses bought at Darkness Day. Pours a great brown/tan head with a great lacing and great retention. Black in color letting no light in whatsoever. Smell is hoppy with a good coffee background. The first smell when putting glass to nose was chocolate, then the hoppy/roasty flavor balanced out. The mouthfeel was unbelievably smooth and full bodied. Overall, I loved it. Was a great experience from sitting in the cold to drinking it."
"D: The alcohol is practically non-existant and the aromas and flavors compliment each other expertly. This is a wonderful beer!"
"Deep midnight black in appearance. Extremely thick dense brown head. Mega sticky lacing that hung around the entire time. Laid back mild aromas of chocolate, malt, and a hint of piney hops. Taste of rich chocolate, sweet roasted malt, coffee, some burnt toast, and a touch of smoke. Every sip starts off very chocolaty and semi sweet, then finishes piney and ever so slightly bitter. NICE! Mouth feel is thick, extremely creamy, and sticky. This is the thickest brew I have ever experienced. Overall drinkability was incredible. Did not detect the high ABV whatsoever. A fantastic flavorful blend of chocolate and piney hops. A real gem to make out to the Chicagoland Burbs. Well done Surly Brewing Company! This RIS lives up to the hype. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable for such a big brew. Tasty from start to finish."
"On tap at Blue Nile, and followed up at Stub & HerbÂ’s following day. Presented in both cases in a goblet (Blue Nile being a really nice Surly goblet). Great looking beer- black as night as expected with a chocolate milk head. Nose is heaven- spicy roasty chocolate. Taste- waves of flavours- all the usual suspects in a great imperial stout- dark roasted coffee, dark and milk chocolate, hazlenuts; plus a wallop of hop bitterness. The hops were really well done, and I think IÂ’m lucky to have tried this fresh while the hops are still battling out with the malts. Adds a really nice dimension to the beer. The pineyness of the hops plays well with the decadent desert of the malts. Very smooth mouthfeel and absolutely no booze heat. Damn fine. If I didnÂ’t have these at the start of my drinking day, I could have had many but stopped at two. I canÂ’t think of any other imperial stouts that IÂ’ve enjoyed more. IÂ’m very happy I could time my trip to Minni and get my lips on this sucker. well done Surly- you never let me down."
"D-This beer is big and smooth. The hops really hold there own against the dark black malt making this a great beer for the cold months."
"Found this years to be a bit sweeter, not as much roast as the 07. Maybe a little less smooth. But still enjoyable!"
"i had the wonderful pleasure of attending a surly tasting last night and had one of the first tastes of the fresh tapped darkness. i have absolutely nothing bad to say about this beer. pitch black in color a dark caramel dense fluffy head. a practically perfect russian imperial stout. do be careful though it doesnt have the feel or taste of its over 10% abv. with only 25 barrels brewed if you get a chance to taste it is a must."
"D-I've heard so much about this beer that I started to believe that it was to good to be true.I was wrong.This is a great beer that given the opportunity to try this you can not pass this up.This is a very drinkable beer but becareful at 9.5% it can sneak up on you."
"A viscous and velvety mouthfeel, with somewhat low-level carbonation, that still manages to be effervescent. After three, i've reached my limit, but that's a testament to an easily drinkable RIS. Really fantastic, i'm glad Surly has landed in Chicago..."
"Overall, this is the best beer I have every had. Better than Westy, Dark Lord, KBS, you name it. I can think of no way to improve it. Man I wish this was easier to obtain. Hopefully the taps at Hopleaf last a while."
"Drinkability: This is perhaps the most suprising thing about this beer. It is one of the most drinkable imperial stouts I have ever had. It is so smooth and balanced, you would never know that it has such a high alcohol content. Just like the description says, I could drink this all night long. In fact I really want more of this one. I hope that some day they will release this in cans, so I can enjoy this one at home nightly."
"Finally I have tasted the Darkness from Surly. It is an excellent beer even though I don't typically seek out imperial stouts. The only thing to make this better was if it was canned for home consumption. I'm not sleeping in the parking lot for a growler!"
"Inky black. Big thick crop of dark brown foam on top. Great staying power too. Spotty patches of brown lace coat the glass as I drink. The aroma is thick with raw, resinous hops. (Very similar to the way Alpha Klaus smelled the very first time I had it years ago.) Also chocolate notes and roasted malts and heavily roasted coffee bean. The flavor exhibits great complexity and depth. Baker's chocolate. Black licorice and hop oils mingle nicely. Intense coffee flavors and mocha/java notes. Fruit nuances are dark in nature....black berry and boysenberry come to mind. And there's a huge bitterness. A big double punch of roasted bitterness and hop bitterness....love this raw ass bitterness. And throughout, there's a nice charred edge to round everything off. The body is medium-full to full. Somewhere in that range. This doesn't have that ""motor oil"" viscosity, but it really doesn't need it. This is damn impressive the way it is. It's lightly carbonated and the alcohol really isn't that noticeable. It seems to blend in with the bitterness and is hidden to an extent in that capacity. There's a nice oily/greasy feel after drinking which I find appealing. The taste lingers long after I'm done. This is very drinkable. Growler would be no problem."
"Served in a tulip glass, this pours an opaque jet black color, with a small brownish head and scattered lacing on the glass. The smell is fruity and chocolaty. The taste is intense, with a peaty earthiness, a fruity plum flavor, a hint of grapefruit hoppiness, and a toasty maltiness. The flavors burst forth, yet this exceptional brew is smooth and balanced. The alcohol content is 9.5%, yet it doesn't feature in the taste. For me, the style makes this a ""one and done"" beer, due to the intensity of the flavors and the high alcohol content. That said, if any Russian Imperial Stout could tempt me into a second glass, it would be this one. An exceptional effort from the brewers at Surly."
"I seriously have never enjoyed an Imperial more than this."
"If you can get your hands on this beer, try it! You won't be dissappointed."
"I had this on draught at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis, MN. Very dark in color with a caramel/tan head. Aroma of molasses, liqourice, and slight creamed coffee. More flavor revealed in every sip. Sweet cocoa chocolate flavor with some dark fruits also present. This was a real treat."
"Drinks very well, alcohol isn't detected. Nice feel. Great beer."
"I finally was able to try this one last night, I am not the biggest fans of stout's in general, but I can certainly sit and enjoy one from time to time, and enjoy is what I did. Nice thick dark black color with a tan head that slowly fades but leaves a nice lacing. aroma of sweet fruits and cocoa. Taste is more of an initial fruity hop feel with a sweet taste of fruity hops and carmel. Mouthfeel is extremely thick and chewy that coats my throat all the way down. I will definatly be enjoying another one of these sippers when the next batch comes out."
"The body is black with a pick-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps, magically self-forming head. ItÂ’s a small head, but it gets a nice dark mocha color before slowly fading out. The aroma holds some muted hints of acetone and perfumey alcohol along with dark fruit, chocolate, licorice, raisin and very faint burnt grain notes. Fore is chocolate, dark fruits (blueberry/cherry) and malt sweetness just before the finish. The finish holds dark chocolate, cooked dark fruits, cocoa powder, burnt malt and toasted/burnt grains. The mouthfeel is quite thick and very creamy and pleasing on the tongue. Very nice."
"Thanks to DarkerTheBetter for sharing this amazing beer. Sampled side by side with 2006 Dark Lord. Pours an opaque black with a thick, dark tan head about a finger thick. Smells of rich roasted coffee, bitter cocoa, and fruity hops. Initial taste is a huge hop blast followed by bittersweet chocolate, cappuccino, vanilla, molasses and yet more hops. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Coats the tongue. If this was the only RIS left on Earth, I would be completely content. Looking forward to drinking this again and soon. Cheers!"
"Again, the character of the hops so unique as to be something I have a tough time likening it to. It had a real shining lime zest and gin quality. High, thin and mercurial. These bold citrus oils danced over the brewing cauldron of darker flavors, complementing and intertwining magically. Then, the longest draw of a smack I could imagine. It kept going and morphing, with roads of Marcona almonds, toasted earth, light goat cheese rind and ground oak dust. From the sauna floor rose juniper branches and hints of sea oats. The real phenomenal effect of this beer was the ethereal combination of every desirable effect. Each aspect played off of every other one in near perfect harmonic balance. The aroma was different from the flavor and the hops had great interplay and the texture was just plain perfect. It reminded me much of the great singular and touchable quality of Westy 12, with all the individualisms and character of the worldÂ’s most perfect Imperial Stout. This is the solar center paradigm shift of Imperial Stouts for me."
"D: Delicious and quite original. Definitely stands out from the crowd. Its up there for the best imperial stouts but IÂ’m not quite sure its thee best. Not as luxurious as some of the others but jam packed with flavor. Delicious beer. Thanks again to JeffKrenner and his Â“mysteryÂ” source. I owe you guys big time."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is syrupy, lingering of chocolate, bitter, and mildly astringent."
"EDIT: So, I was at Cafe 28 today, very delicious brunch. Anyway, they still have Darkness on tap, and I had given this beer a 4.95, but after having it one last time (maybe), I've noticed that on tap, its even thicker, creamier, smellier, tastier, and wantier than ever. So, with out further adieu, 5."
"Amazingly thick and viscous mouthfeel and as full-bodied of a beer as I have ever had! Velvety smooth on the palate and dangerously drinkable. Complex and outstanding. Not just the best RIS made in MN (ha!) but one of the best I've had period."
"On a side note, I've had IPA's that aren't nearly as hoppy as this, and wouldn't mind getting to see the malty side of this beer that is hidden behind the hops. A very awesome beer, that would probably be better if the malt was allowed to shine a bit more. Great job Surly, this one is worth seeking out."
"Then the hops get you. Big citrus fruit flavor ranging from the acidic rind to more mellow, flowery tastes. I've never experienced this much hop flavor in a stout, this rocks. I just wish somehow I could get some more delicious malt flavor out of it. Whatever, this beer was great. I want more."
"On tap at Cafe Twenty Eight. Served in its very own Darkness goblet, which I hope is a sign it will be returning year after year. It arrived at my table as black as black can be. The head is thick, and brown. It never fully goes away, and leaves a half inch of foam in the bottom of the glass when all of the beer is gone. The aroma is of chocolate, vanilla, graham cracker, plums and other dark fruits. The taste is a perfect balance of roasted malt, chocolate, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, silky and nicely carbonated. I really like how it is so full bodied without being overly chewy and sticky. Overall, this is one of teh best beers I have ever had. I am sure I could not drink more than one or two of these at a time, but I could drink one a night for eternity and be very happy."
"This was a bit much for me, but I thought it was nice for the style."
"I love how thick this stout is up front and then how it finishes somewhat dry. The viscosity, bold flavors and alcoholic kick affects the drinkability of this stout, but it is a drink to be savored and served as my dessert at Cafe Twenty-Eight."
"Deep darkness in a tulip glass lulls one into a haze from one whiff of its very distinct dope aroma. I cracked a smile and started laughing as soon as it got close to my nose, surely love at first scent. Darkness also has a deep rainbow of flavors to back up its out of the ordering aroma and a mouthfeel thatÂ’s open to one more before we go."
"This is a very well done beer. Great for the style, and fantastically intricate. A sipper for sure, but I don't think I'd want too many of these on any given night. I'm glad I have help with this growler. Thanks again Omar and Al!"
"Had this on tap at the Blue Nile...I had it after a furious and some food so my palate was really saturated with flavors already. This brew is almost pitch black and has a really thick brownish head. This beer has so many complex smells and tastes that it is almost like an enigma. Espresso, coco-chocolate, dark fruits, balanced by a nice hoppiness. This has to be one of the best tasting beers I've ever had! This beer has the THICKEST and creamiest mouthfeel I have ever encountered in a beer, I'm serious. Its so thick that its almost like chocolate pudding. This is definitely not a session beer, but is best savored after a good meal. I really wish this wasn't a seasonal beer and was brewed all year round. Surly PLEASE give us more."
"This beer is a great example of the type. It has a great flavor and nice mouthfeel. I highly recommend this beer. Be careful though, it kicks like a mule with its high abv."
"Delicious! An Imperial Stout at it's finest and yet another fantastic offering from Surly."
"Dark, very dark and opaque to the eye as it is poured from the tap. Develops a dark tan head, tight, uniform, and very pleasing to the eye. The head along with the lace (""the stickiest of the icky"") rings the glass and never seems to let go. The hops are definitely here in the nose, but are blanketed by notes of fruit (ripening plums, Concorde grapes) and a mildly-pungent yeast. Just a touch of lactic sourness on first sip, alongside hop bitterness, notes of green apple and iodine. A rich, smooth, oatmeal stout-like quality pervades the mouthfeel, and carbonation is appropriate for the style. The yeast character remains consistent as this warms, and there are both vegetal and medicinal qualities here as well. Very well realized: the alcohol is boozy and warming yet unobtrusive, and the hops are biting yet not overly assertive, and are woven intricately into the aromatics. Malty and full-bodied yet by no means sweet in the cloying sense. Near the end of the glass (and as near to actual room temperature as I can get without busting out my handy thermometer) I'm getting cocoa, vanilla, and a touch of sour cherry. Final thoughts: while the alcohol is stated to be 9.5% ABV, it is extremely well hidden here and Darkness drinks a little bit ""lighter"" than a beer going nose to nose with 10%. A very complex brew and definitely a sipper: if I get the chance to do so, I'd like to try this neck and neck with the Le Coq from Belgium some day, as it brings to mind some fond memories and notes of comparison to that brew. Reviewed at Blue Nile."
"To answer feloniousmonk's question at the end of his review (see below) I was thinking probably some Black Sabbath?"
"And thank you for brewing this beer, to my knowledge the only Russian Imperial Stout from a Minnesota brewery, outside of the brewpubs."
"Beware: Darkness has set across the Land of Minnesota Beerdom. Close the door and lock it behind you. It's time for drinkin' some Darkness!"
"This was a great beer that was a definate sipper for sure. It was a warming beer perfect for Fall or Winter. It poured a jet black hue with a nice frothy brown head and stuck to the glass the whole way down. The roasted malt flavor with slight undertones of dark chocolate and burnt malts were great. This was a smooth and easily drinkable beer I hope to get my hands on this one again"
