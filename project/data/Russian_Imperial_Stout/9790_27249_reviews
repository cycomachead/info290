"Overall, this is a solid RIS. Great price point for a great beer. I will definitely pick this up again, delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"I tend to love dark beers. In particular the porters and stout and this is an excellent stout. Full body with a lot of flavor. Malty taste with a slight bitter in the finish."
""
"This is a very strong beer with a smooth feel and a strong smell. It has a nice bourbon taste with a candy like front taste and bitter back end. I give it high ratings overall! !"

"Good beer, very strong. Little bitter on back end."
"Aged 1+ years.  A solid imperial stout.  Warming, boozy, hot chocolate.  A fine, fine beer worth drinking many of (over time in small amounts).  Tastes as though it were BA, was it?"

"Pours pitch black with a thin mocha head. The head dies off pretty quickly but a small portion hangs on leaves some small lacing. The aroma has some big alcohol esters with hints of dark roasted malt. The taste takes it up, with some nice roasted malt, a hint of licorice, a little vanilla and oak. The body is just right, not too slick, not to thin, but not chewy, either. A great, full-flavor Russian Imperial stout."

""

""
""
"Overall, this was a really solid beer. Would I have it again? Yep."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Just a ton of roasted malt goodness in here. There are hints of dark coffee and tobacco and maybe just a trace of toffee, but this is mostly just heavily roasted malt. As it warms, the backend starts to feel a touch watery and I get a day old coffee flavor. A pretty tasty beer overall though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First sip, yep infected. Total sourness, incredibly bitter. Like sour milk. Took one more sip and down the drain it went. Was pretty excited to try a fairly high rated RIS but this was one of 3 beers I've had to dump."
""
""
""
""
"O- Wow, big split on this one as I like the aroma a lot but the weak mouthfeel and strange flavor make me not want to ever revisit it. Maybe if I had it on draft? Had high hopes for this one but it was a letdown."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Poured on-tap at the brewery and served in a nonic pint, the beer is jet black, with mahogany highlights, and a halo of white head. Nose of bourbon, molasses, smoke, bittersweet chocolate, and old-world fruit highlights of plum and date. Flavors of roast and bittersweet chocolate forward, with rich molasses and fig in the backbone, hints of smoke highlights, and a bittersweet coffee and chocolate linger. Smooth, robust, but still crisp and dry in the finish, with a roasted, rich, and bitter aftertaste, and a fruit and chocolate linger. Fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite impressive, mouthfeel aside. If this had the body of, say, Stone IRS, this could have been a bona-fide giant killer. As it stands right now, this is a really solid local gem, one that's well worth sampling."
""
""
"After having the opportunity to sample several Duck Rabbit selections, I've decided I need to make a trip to Farmville, NC. I live in Southeast Virginia, so it is going to happen. I think they have positioned themselves as a good brewery and might be flying under the radar to some extent."

"i had this immediately after a black tuesday, so my review may be skewed negatively in the shadow of one of the best stouts ever made, but this one didnt really do much for me. it has a couple years on it i think, and may not have aged as gracefully as originally anticipated. the pour is very dark, but oddly thin, not a lot of body on it by the way it looks. the nose and taste are both a little oxidized. we all agree that we smell and taste green olives, its briny and strange. there is a nice bitter roasty malt to this, and a warming alcohol strength, but the flavors in the middle are either aged away or not very dynamic. it drinks really heave for having a body on the lighter side, and the booze comes out a lot when its at room temperature. i will have to get a fresh bottle and revisit this another time, and it had a lot of variables working against it this time around. still, unimpressed by my first duck rabbit experience."
""
""
"Overall, I like this brew, pretty good taste and presence, nice booziness, there is a lingering taste that I can't pin point that seems to take away slightly."
""
""
"12oz. bottle: This one poured a dark, opaque brown color. Somewhat ""inky"". There was a small dark tan head and no lacing. Definitely some alcohol to the nose. Lots of other aroma: chocolate, roastiness, dark fruits, yet a bit subdued. Nothing really jumping to the forefront. The taste is good and a bit interesting. A lot of flavors coming together, but nothing really asserting itself. Faint dark fruits, chocolate, a hint of roastiness. No real sweetness to it. Interesting."
""
"So I opened a bottle with 2011 labeled, and let it warm for a while.. then proceeded to sip.. the first touch on my tongue was extreme bitterness. After another small light sip, I realized this was definitely infected.. probably the sourest nasty thing I have ever tried. Too bad, cause I hoped for a better stout like the other reviewers. It was an extra, so maybe figures it was infected.. too bad they couldn't bottle condition. Not much more to say.. again, this was a 2011 labeled bottle."
""
"MF – Medium-heavy body, some creaminess, minor slickness."
""
"Nothing great but nothing to be ashamed of either, not exactly what I look for in a big stout, has a strange sour tang but I don't pick up on and infection or anything like that, just a little odd"
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall , it is not as complex as many other of the style, but a solid brew and super easy to drink for 10% abv. I will definitely revisit Rabid Duck in the future."
""
"O - This beer is a little strange for me. I really don't like the flavor combos here. I'm not a big roast guy and the licorice definitely doesn't go with the roast. I have had this in bottles and felt the same way. This was sent on a whim. Next time, I will ask him what he is sending but he ships;-)"

""

""
""
"O - Solid imp stout, though not overwhelming. I'd be happy having this as an option locally."

"Poured a almost blackish with one finger brown head that slowly dies and leaves some lace on top of a mostly roasted, coffee like aroma, although there's some bread, toffee, dark chocolate as well but not much in terms of dark fruits. Taste and mouthfeel offer more on the aroma as the beer is smooth, medium bodied, but at times sticky like there's molasses in there (tastewise as well), and mostly this is like drinking a tamed stout as there is some heaviness and dryness thanks to roasted and coffee malts but it comes across more like java or coffee with a dash of chocolate (which sounds odd, I know). I did appreciate this beer for the light price and it works as a dessert sipper but not your textbook RIS (I will say I had no idea it was 10% either b/c it didn't come across as boozy)."
""
"Pours a nice full, two finger plus head of dark brown color, uneven surface but not really dimpled, good retention and never quite evaporates down to the surface, the lacing initially forms broad sheets but only average stick. The liquid is a standard black or just maybe the darkest brown imaginable, close to impossible to gauge the carbonation level visually. The nose is overloaded by toasted dark chocolate and mocha powder, supported by licorice, vanilla bean, café au lait and challah bread notes, good amount of mixed apricot, cherry, plum fruit, ends via a suggestion of leafy sous bois and earthiness. Full-bodied yet creamy enough that the weight melts off quickly. The carbonation is appropriate for a beer of its size and it doesn’t feel heavy. The chocolate once more dominates the rest. However, the almonds, coffee, vanilla, mint and cola bean ain’t shabby. No alcoholic burn and the roast and toast isn’t as potent as in the nose. Possesses good flow and the finish is tactfully succinct, which may not be desired by all. Here the plum, cherry, blackberry fruit tends to hang off to the side, not overly sweet. High level of drinkability, not going for the jugular in the “wow” department."
""
"Verdict: A decent RIS from The Duck-Rabit, perhaps this is quite young and needs more time to balance itself out. This beer is so roasty for my palate that it made it hard to finish more than about 4-5 ounces, the complexity is lacking and the balance is poor, but I will commend this beer for hiding all traces of alcohol."
"This beer is drinking wonderfully for being almost two years old. The appearance isn't spectacular and the mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I expect for an RIS, but otherwise a great stout in aroma and taste. Overall, just under outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with below average carbonation. This isn't a total failure, but having tart dark fruit in this beer is a mistake. I will give them credit for hiding the 10.00 % abv well."
""
"It does have a good thickness to it and it pretty smooth off a crisp bite up front. Something seems to fall off just a little at the end of each sip."

"O: A very good RIS from a local brewery. Ill will definatly be keeping an eye out for this one."
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent RIS worth getting at least once but there are better ones at a lower price."

"O: This is a very big beer with a bold flavor but one that is very enjoyable - this is a beer that you need to sip slowly. I could not have more than one of these during a session but it is one to definitely try (especially now that Duck-Rabbit has corrected their infection issues). Alcohol is very well hidden in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice imperial stout but not really complex in any extraordinary way. Bitterness , crispness and a citrusy edge to the profile are it's strong points."
""
""
"O - It's pretty decent but really oddly fruity, like an apa type twist. The fruityness is the main flavor (by far) that I get out of this beer."
"O- interesting flavor profile, different from most RIS, but enjoyable overall. The tart flavors are interesting."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is the first time I've had this beer from Duck Rabbit. First time I've ever seen it, in fact. For a Russian Imperial Stout, it's highly enjoyable! If one is to drink a few of these, I'd recommend some sort of meaty snack to accompany it- a burger, some beef jerky, something of the like. Strong, but delicious. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A fairly nice drier Russian Imperial. It is almost like a blend between and imperial stout and a black IPA in some ways, as it finishes with a decent bitter hop/roast taste(although not what would be need to be actually considered a true black IPA) . Its pretty nice and worth a try, although it is likely not one I would go to on any great occasion."
""
""
"Black with almost a finger of tan head that persists as a thin covering. Smells of dark chocolate, cocoa, dark plum, hints of molasses and leather. Tastes of bitter chocolate and treacle are expected, but there is a citrus hop flavor beneath the surface that surprises. The bitterness from the hops and slight astringency from the roasted malts combine for a very bitter finish with a drying impression. The nose gets a little boozy as it warms, but for 10% ABV the alcohol stays well-hidden throughout. Dangerously drinkable RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I finally caved and decided to read past reviews, and it has me wondering if I'm reviewing a partially-infected bottle. It's definitely still good, but I'm not sure this kind of flavor profile is what the brewer had intended. To be continued..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer. You could easily throw these down. At 10%, it would hit you fast."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"A delicious, (very) sweet, fruity stout. I think it's just a hair over the top, or I'd be giving it 5s in some of these categories."
""
""
""
"4.13/5.00"
"With that said, I actually quasi-enjoyed the first half of this beer. Almost tasted like it was supposed to be a sour stout. Dominating tastes of burnt malts followed by a sour kick. But half was all I could take before drain pouring the rest."
""
""
""
"One sip and you know it's infected. Charred, burnt malt is overrun by cherry tartness. Honestly, it kinda works! I happen to enjoy this particular infection, though I'd love to revisit a ""good"" bottle of Rabid Duck in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was an interesting beer, I can't say I hated it but it definitely wasn't my favorite flavor in the world. It definitely had a very strong soy sauce flavor that almost bordered on steak sauce flavor. Abv well hidden, decent mouthfeel. I can't say I would recommend this beer- you will probably either like it or hate it."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was silky with a modest amount of carbonation."
""
"O: Well, there's a little roasted malt and a whole lot of meat and soy sauce. Only other beer that I've had like this was Dark Lord as I already mentioned, which was just soy sauce. I'm not sure if it's a brewing mistake or an infection or just a really strange beer, though they were both RISes. Hmph. Avoid if you dislike drinking meat and soy sauce."
"A great imperial stout. Love it and the abv isn't noticed as much as you would expect. One to seek out again."
""
"D: forgive my french, but this is the second bottle in a row ive had from duck rabbit that tasted soy-like, the last being their black IPA both purchased from the same store (wegmans in downingtown, pa). i believe autolysed yeast is the culprit and im a little disappointed in duck rabbit not recalling these bottles if they could have. otherwise most things i have had from them are really solid. would love to try beer sans the chinese dumpster flavor."
""
""
"Full bodied and smooth, moderate carbonation, creamy and thick mouthfeel that’s just right for the style. Not the biggest or most extreme imperial stout but a damned good one. Very drinkable for the heft and ABV. I’m a Duck Rabbit fan and this beer certainly didn’t hurt that!"
""
"Overall: little too sweet and tangy up front. The booze are well hidden. Definitely very dynamic but the initial taste is a turn off for me and ruins the nice middle and finish."
""
"O - Hmm. Infected Rabid Duck? That's got a ring to it... Seriously though, I remember this beer being great at a tasting; I look forward to amending this review with a full-on, BeerFM style review. Good luck on scrubbing out the issue guys!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good solid imperial stout."
""
""
""
"D - Interesting, this is a dark and complex beer, but it has a fruity acidity that really brightens things up and gives it a drinkability that few beer of this style ever manage."
""
""
"Poured into snifter glass. Poured a deep black with a small tan head along with weak lacing throughout. Nice and thick viscosity though. Smells of leather, wood, booze, raisins, cocoa, and faint espresso. Mouth is silky smooth and creamy. Flavor is of rich dark chocolate, bitter black coffee, wine, some walnut bitterness, and finishes slightly charred and roasty. Moderate amount of carbonation complements smoothness very well. Perfect sipper mouth. I think all the other DR brews are pretty average at best, but this is the best bunch of them all."

"O - Duck Rabbit is one of those brewers that I look at every time I am at the beer store and respect, but rarely get. Today was the first time I saw the Rabid Duck. The picture of the duck with the sable hat brought back shades of George Costanza and I decided to grab one. I was very impressed by this beer and recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys RIS."
"O- I enjoyed this one quite a bit, enough that I grabbed a six pack to take with me on my move from Georgia to Colorado since I know I won't be able to get it anymore. Definitely worth a taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very enjoyable stout."
"I like this beer. The taste is complex with lots of flavored and it also has a compled feel to it. I would love to have another one of these to hold onto for a year or more to track the changes."
""
"Thanks to stimulus for this awesome extra! Pours a thick, pitch black color with a small-medium, dark tan/espresso colored head that quickly diminishes. Scent is heavy in the chocolate department. A ton of rich chocolate with hints of espresso and a lot of dark malt. Taste is initially dark malt with a hint of dark fruits. Then there is an interesting, tart flavor that I'm trying to put my finger on. Immediately switches to tasty biscotti and dark chocolate with just a hint of vanilla. Some lovely espresso notes as well. Mouthfeel is a little lighter than expected, and a bit...fizzy? Definitely not what I'm used to in a RIS. Drinkability is fairly high...ABV WELL-HIDDEN. Overall, this is not one of the best imperial/RI stouts I've had, but it is a tasty one and definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an intense beer. It has great flavor though a little creamy and to me off at times. It's definitely worth a try."
""
""
"O: This was a bit better than I expected and a solid RIS. The aromas and flavors are all great. If it wasn't for that off-putting bitterness on the finish this might have scored a bit higher."
""
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, soft and sticky on the tongue. This was a pretty solid imp stout, and they did a nice job of balancing the alcohol heat with dark fruit flavor."
"M: deep, dark, roasted malt with bitter dark chocolate finish"
""
""
""
""
""
"Sits light, and tastes like sweet cereal grains. Normally, I would hate on something so simple, but its very good. Goes down well."
"O - The alcohol is well hidden in this RIS...I enjoyed this one and all of it's dark chocolate flavors...the malts were nicely roasted and gave off a nice bitterness"
""
""
""
"Overall this is a top of the line RIS. It is probably one of the best I have had."
""
"While not the best RIS out there, this one is worth checking out if you like the style. It was quite good 4 months ago and better now- I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of this six pack evolves over the next 12-24 months. "
"O-- Quite complex beer. Quite nice. Good slow sipper that is thick and chewy, yet silky in spots."
""
"O: Fantastic brew that I will be seeking out again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rabid Duck is a solid example of a Russian Imperial Stout."
"O- Overall I was quite impressed with this brew. I've read a few reviews of fresh bottles that seem to suggest this beer has some flavors that clash a bit while still young. IMO age has only helped meld the flavor profile together in a very enjoyable way."
""
""
""
"I picked this up in brewery release 3.0, deep black pour with a thin tan head. The aroma is licorice, and dark fruit. The taste has dark fruit, black strap molasses, and a pleasant sour note, lingering finish. The beer is full, good carbonation, no noticeable booze. An enjoyable RIS, not sure what the sour tinge is so just a slight deduction."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The best beer I've ever had! I've spent some time searching for the best sweet stout I could find. I was ignoring the Imperials as I was looking for something with the perfect balance of sweet and hops. I never thought to look at Imperials. I've tried others only to be let down. I know this may not be the most traditional Russian Stout, but, to me, it certainly is the most tasty. It smells like caramel and hops. It's pitch black with a quickly dissipating head. It tastes like ripened fruit and chocolate. For 10% ABV, its an awesome session beer. I can't imagine all the money I wasted looking for this beer. It can't be done any better. Kudos Duck Rabbit."
"O: Instantly one of my favorite RISs. Right mix of sweetness and roastiness. Will look for more of this through trades."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. This is a rollercoaster for me. The aroma leaves something to be desired, but the flavor puts it right back on track, but then the mouthfeel is lacking. Even so, I think it drinks fairly easily overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably one of the best RIS's I've had in a while, comparable to some of the top ones."
"Mouthfeel is really good. I've had this on tap a few times and it seemed thicker, but this time it feels slightly lighter. Don't get confused, this is still a full bodied beer. Good carbonation level and insanely drinkable. I know I've mentioned an alcohol flavor a few times, but 10% is still masked pretty well. Duck-Rabbit you continue to please!"
"O: a great RIS, but I prefer them without the onslaught of hops in the flavor. I just don't get the pine/chocolate flavor combo. Other than that deviation from my preferences, this is a superb stout."
"O. Nice RIS, much more complex then the milk stout by duck rabbit. This RIS gets better with age."
"Overall, a good stout - but not something I'll seek out. A bit too much char for my taste. I'll stick w/ the baltic porter or milk stout."
"O: A solid RIS, a nice sipper over an evening, but still quite drinkable. Despite the warming feeling, the abv is hidden very well."
"Overall – A good beer. I could taste the alcohol a bit, and the beer was a bit too bitter and I would have liked to see just a hint more sweet chocolate shine through. I have another sitting in the cellar that I’ll open this winter."
"o - overall a bit of a let down. huge fan of the style and this beer misses a lot of the bold roastiness and general thickness that i look for in a RIS. too sweet for me."
"O - A really good beer! Complex, with an evolving profile that reveals itself further with each sip. A winner for sure!"
"definately a stout that I will seek out again and again"
"O- A solid beer. Of the three Duck Rabbit offerings that I've had, I'd have to rank this third though, behind their Baltic Porter and Milk Stout."
"D - solid RIS here. More sweet than most, but it worked well for me. The more I try from this brewery the more I want. Good stuff!"
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch puffy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark fruits, coffee grounds, and cocoa powder. Taste is of dark fruits, bitter coffee, and unsweetened chocolate. There is also a slight soy sauce aroma and taste as the beer warms up. A mild roasted bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good RIS with some solid aromas and flavors. I am glad I was able to get one of these."
"Pours jet balck with a tan-brownish head that sitcks around for a little while. Smells of coffee, brown sugar, and dark rasins. Taste is amazing its a full on coffee up front with a brilliant roasted malt aftertaste no sign on the 10%abv what so ever. Mouthfeel and carbonation are right where they belong. IMO this beer is at its prime it is hands down the best non BA russian imperial stout I have ever had to date, I highly sugest you seek this out."
"The feel is full and robust with soft carbonation. This one is pretty rock solid. A great RIS that really delivers what I want from the style. Well done I say."
"More roast comes through in the flavor, really nice character melded with dark fruits and caramel, just a touch ashy. Dark chocolate less in the flavor, roast gives a pleasant and quite pinching dry finish to complement a slightly sweet and round body - nails it for a RIS. Only real detraction is this slight metallic character, almost minerally which is especially noticable in the first half a dozen sips and then fades out. ABV is hidden with just a slight warming in the finish. Really classic character to this stout, well balanced between roasty and fruity, dry and sweet - a really well made interpretation that has nothing fancy but focuses on hitting all the right notes. Top notch"
"D: Well done Duck Rabbit, you've renewed yourself from the disaster the fruited baltic porter was in my eyes. While this one isn't a big roasty bomb like Old Raspy or other RIS's, its quite balanced and complex."
"O - A well balanced RIS to taste but the nose lacked a bit for me. Still a good drink!"
"O- With the overall ABV its a sipper but a smooth beer for an RIS. Very flavorful and not as carbonated as most stouts."
"overall, a good beer, but nothing really to set it apart from other Russian Imperial Stouts."
"O: This is an excellent RIS! The nutty flavors were a very welcomed surprise. It really helps it stand out from other Imperial Stouts."
"Can't imagine it being any better and was very tasty."
"o - very very good. id buy this often if i had access to it. not very many hardcore heady russian imperial stouts around southern cali. either that or i haven't found it yet. i need more of this in my life."
"I almost always grab a sixer of this stuff when I see it on the shelf."
"Overall this is a very good beer and good example of this style very much enjoyed it. It is though an almost perfect example of a very toned down high Russian Imperial. Really enjoyed it."
"O - Nice beer, not my favorite RIS, but can't complain about this one at all."
"O: This really is a nice beer, and I imagine it would benefit from a good year in the bottle, but alas, that is not my advantage to do so. Overall, however, I think I prefer their Milk-stout."
"O: probably the closest to my current location brewed RIS I've had, and is great."
"O: If this was available here, I would buy this numerous times. Really tasty and sweet but not sugar bomb sweet. Overall, a really good beer and I can't believe it's a 10% ABV. Nice job Duck-Rabbit!"
"O-Excellent with more head and body than I remember in the past brews."
"O - a very full flavored stout that is not otherwise challenging or bold. An easy recommendation."
"Rabid Duck pours an impenetrable black, with about two and a half fingers of mocha foam topping off the beer. Retention is a bit brief, and there's just a touch of lacing left around the glass. The nose is of slightly burnt espresso, and some seriously bitter dark chocolate. The flavor is carried by those same notes, and while it's not as bad as beers that have a straight roast flavor, this one tastes like it's leaning a bit heavy on the dark specialty grains. The surprisingly dry finish and lack of sweetness only accentuates this. Despite that, the body, while a bit less robust than I'd normally expect, is still comfortably full for the style. This is probably aided by the appropriately subdued carbonation that manages to keep itself out of the way. I usually enjoy Duck Rabbit's offerings, but their crack at an imperial stout was just a bit of a miss for me."
"HV"
"Looks: 4/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 3.5/5; Mouthfeel 3.5/5; Overall 3.5/5"
"O- Really nice RIS. Complex flavor and smell but not messy."
"This pours out as a really dark black color with creamy brown head that fades quickly. The lacing doesn't really exist. The smell of the beer is amped with molasses and dark chocolate. The taste had some big rich chocolate flavors with burnt malts and some bitter molasses in the back end. The mouthfeel is thick and oily. Overall I found this brew to be quite good. The alcohol was well hidden until it warmed up. I would drink this one again."
"O: This is a really nice beer. At no point in drinking this did the 10%ABV make itself noticed..well, maybe a little, but it didn't distract from the beer at all. Because of this, if drikability was still in place, I'd rate this a 4.5 or 5.0. Another winner from Duck Rabbit."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. I must thank McNuts for this one. I don't think this ones distribution is very large so I am very happy to have BA's like Keith. This is definitely not the greatest RIS out there but one that commands a chance."
"O - Overall, this is another great one from Duck-Rabbit. I'm lucky to have access to this small brewery and I feel they deserve a little more attention than they receive. This one is definitely worth seeking out. Cheers!"
"I would like to thank Tripphop for the great six pack of Rabid Duck; I have been waiting to try this for a couple years now. And with the first taste I wasnt wrong for waiting. This beer opens up with a lot of graham cracker, mocha, and a bit of roast. It also has a lot of nice sweet malt character to it that balances the roast in the beer. In the aroma you get a lot of graham cracker, sweet ginger, and a bittersweet dark chocolate. I am really impressed with this beer, because not only have a great taste and intoxicating aroma, it has a great foam stability for a stout. Even after the one finger head dissipates it keeps a nice layer of foam on the top of the beer. The mouthfeel is the best part, it coats the tongue and eases down the esophagus. Overall, this beer really beat my expectations and really surprised me. This beer is definitely worth trying, and trying again. I am going to age a few and see how the profile changes. Now, only if it was barrel aged it would be amazing, especially with the added oak, vanilla, and bourbon/whiskey components. Duck-Rabbit please do a Barrel-Aged Rabid Duck."
"O: Nice RIS; very reminiscent of Central Waters's offering. I really like the cocoa dominance, and this is a different flavor than chocolate for those that have tried ovaltine."
"As a side note, this review is for the 2011 edition. The 2010 edition with some age on it has some noticeable (yet still subtle) differences, but overall I'd rate the two about equally. Blending the two, however, actually enhanced it (I felt, anyway), so if you have access to both I'd give that a shot."
"Syrupy but full enough to get away with it. An RIS that doesn't make me want to hunt for more, but it's a great beer to drink."
"Overall, I'll be the first to admit my bipolar attitude towards balance in beer. While often overrated, it would be a welcome adjective to attach to this experience."
"I use to not be a big fan of this beer. I thought that it had a weird yeasty sour quality that I found strange. Well that's obviously been fixed and if they keep making the it this way it's certainly my favorite RIS in the state (yes, I like this better than Sexual Chocolate). I'll be getting more to throw in the cellar. Paul – please throw some of this in a barrel and let us see what it taste like. Please. I'll come to Farmville."
"O - I just couldn't finish this one. I wanted to and I wanted to like it but it was just way to syrupy sweet for me. Almost like cola syrup with some hops and dark fruits. Would not do this again."
"O: Overall, a good RIS and a good deal for $13 a sixer. Even fresh, there's no alcohol burn, and it has an interesting (in a good way) mix of sweet and roasted characters."
"Overall, this is one hell of an amazing RIS. It just might be #2 on my all time favorites, right behind Founders Breakfast Stout. Odd that my local bottle shop would start stocking this the week we get 95 degree heat and it isn't even June yet, but hey, I have central air."
"I love muddy, thick stouts...I prefer less coffee in my stouts, and this one didn't disappoint...thick, covering mouthfeel let me know I had a real beer in there...It was dense, and chewy and rather enjoyable. I couldn't drink this in August in DC, but would love one by the fire in November. Good brew."
"This had a lot of personal anticipation and hype as I’ve been hunting this for years and always managed to miss it. So very glad to finally get a hold of some and it is quite the treat. This is right there with their Baltic Porter as far as my favorite Duck-Rabbit brews. I really hope more rolls in as two bottles just won’t suffice (although I do have my doubts as to how well this will age based on past experiences with D-R)."
"Good beer. The taste would need a little more to make it exceptional, but it's still well crafted. Of all the stouts I've had that feature primarily strong roasted notes, this one may have done it the best of'em all with the nice, clean aftertaste."
"The CPJ"
"as this beer warms up, i'm warming up to it. i did finish the glass, and the more i drank the better it tasted. maybe it was the 10%abv, which seemed to well hidden at low temps, but came to the front as it warmed. but i liked it, the roasty woody flavors made it a good sipper for after dinner."
"Well, this is an odd beer. Not what I was expecting. It has sour hints in it, which I don't think I like, but all the other RIS components I like."
"This beer grew on me the more i sipped it, i think it just hit me from a weird angle at first, but once i stopped making it fit my mold i started to enjoy it, i'd drink it again for sure."
"This beer pours a nice deep brown to black. There was very little head formation and even less lacing. Nose was a mix of weak coffee, chocolate, some vanilla and soy (uh oh). Definitely a soy-metallic taste mixed in with the roasty chocolate/sweet malt flavour (which is actually very good). Mouth is thinner than you'd expect in a RIS. Overall this beer has good potential, just a few off flavours hurt."
"overall good but not great and really should have been drunk a year or two ago."
"Mouthfeel is smooth all the way down and little bite to report. Resin leaves a chocolat bourbon flavr in the mouth."
"D: For 10% abv, I found the heat to be quite subdued in this one. Sweet and drinkable."
"O/D- I'm glad to have tried it and would love to get more so I will leave it on my wants list as a hopeful extra!"
"D- Not sure how I feel about this beer. Not what I expected from a RIS at all. The balance and flavors just aren't there. That being said, it is different and still not bad. Maybe down the road I'll try this one again and see what I think after drinking a few more RIS's."
"This beer pours an opaque blackness from parts unknown. The head is a nice solid tan brown color. The nose of this beer is rather fruity in nature. Surprisingly there is almost a cranberry like nose along with hints of roasted malts. The sweetness of the cranberry comes through on the taste rather predominantly. There are notes of oats, figs, and cinnamon go along with it. But overall the yeast produced a much fruiter beer than I had anticipated. The mouthfeel was excessively thin for a beer of this style. It still drank like one hell of a fine beer. This was honestly one of the more unique RISs that I've ever consumed that actually worked as far as being tasty."
"One to savor over a period of time. Pretty good but not a classic."
"While not a real departure from the big RIS that so many are doing, all that roast intentional or not, keeps things interesting. This is one that I'm very glad to try, but don't really want to drink again."
"Drinkability: Alright, I guess. ABV is not noticeable, but man, this tastes nasty! Wouldn't try again. Glad I tried, though, and thanks again to plenum for the generous extra."
"D: Very sweet in flavor, maybe a little too sweet, but overall this is a good beer. Sweet upfront but balanced out with the roasted malts in the finish. I'm going to age the other one I have to see if it mellows out the sweetness a little."
"Overall, I am extremely glad I was able to try this beer but I don't think I would seek it out again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. It's not exactly a milkshake of a stout, but it's acceptable. The carbonation is fine and adds just enough for this to avoid being syrupy or sticky. I'm not a fan of this beer. The flavors didn't mesh and the elements that did stand out felt out of place. Certainly a huge mis-step after the tremendous Duck Rabbit Milk Stout."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drinkability:This is an excellent RIS, with great flavors. The lighter body makes it easy to drink a lot of."
"D: This had some of the same characteristics as the Alaskan Smoked Porter. Heck, I loved that beer.... and I loved this one too!"
"pretty full bodied. this beer reminds me alot of expedition stout just not as intense."
"D- Very smooth, flavorful, and pleasant. The licorice note turns me off slightly, but I'd buy this again."
"This is a great RIS. Plenty of flavor and a great mouthfeel with the abv just right on the palate, this is quite easy to drink and completely smooth."
"Chewy full body with lots of roasted malt flavor. Plenty of roasted coffee/espresso bean as well as some burnt toast, lactic cream, silky chocolate, oatmeal and licorice. Slightly acrid but also creamy with a well masked ABV, making this pretty quaffable. Bitter dry finish with sligt warmth. I know a lot of people who hate this beer but all of the bottles I've had were very good."
"D--Bitter roast flavor throws me off a bit, but still a very good version for the style."
"Hideously dark with a mountain of the foamy stuff. This beer reigns chocolate down on my mouth, too heavily so, in fact. Seems to be fairly well hopped, pretty bitter beyond just a chocolate bitter. Finishes dry, the sweetness of the malts is outweighed by the hop and chocolate bitter. It's a good beer, but it's just not working for me."
"D: Goes down quite easily, pretty tasty, somewhat filling, good kick, good representation of style. This hit the spot on this snowy New England evening."
"The taste is a bit too sweet and some of the black licorice flavors come out a little too strongly for me. There's some slight booze, but it works well with the espresso and roast notes. Body is heavy and viscous with good carbonation. Hard to believe this weighs in at 10%. Maybe it was the fact that they served it to me in a pint glass, but this beer was pretty quaffable."
"Drinkability is also disappointing, as can probably be deduced from the flavor and mouthfeel scores. A decent beer to sit around and sniff endlessly, so long as it comes nowhere near your mouth."
"Dark black color with one finger of mocha colored head that settled to a thin cap. Just a little spotty lacing is left on the glass. Intoxicating aroma of dark chocolate, ripe dark fruit, coffee, and alcohol. The alcohol presence is not that surprising considering the ABV. The taste falls short of the aroma. Bitter malt and alcohol makes up most of the flavor. However there are subtle hints of chocolate, tart fruit, and coffee. Plenty of alcohol warmth. Just too harsh to be considered one of the premier RIS. The body is where this beer completely disappears. Far too thin to carry the ABV. The low carbonation helps but it is not a satisfying drinking experience. Plus it tastes harsh and is too boozy. Only my second Duck-Rabbit beer. The beers seem to be good but get hurt by a couple of flaws. I have another bottle that is going to get tucked away for a few years."
"D - solid one here, and doing its job well on the first snowy night of the season. definitely quaffable, though (nicely) is not afraid to show its muscle (booze). another fine beer from a very fine brewery."
"D: Beautiful, supremely drinkable with or without the double-digit ABV."
"Poured from bottle into my SA Perfect Pint glass. Pours dark/pitch black in color with almost no head. A decent amount of carbonation. Scents of burnt bitter chocolate and some dried dark fruits. Strong flavors of cocoa, prune, toasted malts, no real hop flavors to speak of. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy. This is a nice beer to sip on, alcohol is pretty well hidden."
"Carbonation and hoppy bitterness nip the tongue, while alcohol warms the esophagus. A very flavorful stout but really comes off on the thin side. I'm curious to try Olde Rabbit's Foot now."
"Medium body and light carbonation. Creamy, but a little thin. Average drinkability, but the slightly off flavor makes it a little difficult to get excited about taking that next sip."
"D: Slow drinker, seem to pick up little intricacies with each sip. It is noticeably a heavy beer, and doesn't hesitate to let you know but the flavor profile is quite nice."
"Upon first opening this, I took a whiff straight from the bottle. WTF? Smell is strange, almost like garbage, which was really odd. Not knowing what to expect, I poured this thing into a pint glass, and it was quite dark, nearly black with just a touch of light coming through the edges. Luckily that smell I first detected went away as it was poured into the glass (shew) and opened up to some chocolate, sherry, and lightly oxidized notes. Taste is straightforward with the chocolate, roast is there, but it's more on the toasty side rather than the bitter charred side. There's light sourness/twang on the back end that makes this beer seem like it has a cherry-like flavor, but then is overtaken by a creamy, chocolaty finish. It's quite good, but there's something about the middle of this beer that's throwing me off. Mouthfeel is superb. Ultra creamy with low carbonation, but still enough there to produce delightful belches. This is an all around good beer, but something seems just a little off in certain aspects, but I enjoyed it overall."
"Overall I'm very happy to have tried this. I'm not sure the avaialbility but I would definately seek this out if i could get my hands on it."
"D - A letdown, overall. The D-R Milk Stout is better."
"drinkability: Smooth for a 10%. I've got a couple more to put back for a while. This one's 6 months old. The nose is noticeably better than the one I drank fresh. Here's hoping some more age will do the same for the taste."
"the taste is more of the nose. very smooth and balanced. an obviously big beer that is very drinkable."
"12 oz. bottle, best by 03 10 notched, and sampled October '09. Pours a thick, dark black, topped with a dark mocha head that reduces to almost nothing. Very aromatic, but rough around the edges, with lots of dark malts that contribute licorice, coffee and leather, blended with a bit of green hops and peppery alcohol which emerges later. Densely-packed with flavor, there are lots of dark malts which give bitter and acidic notes, along with chocolate, coffee and licorice. Light hop flavor to boot, and it has a medium body that finishes roasty and dry. This is a tasty brew, and the alcohol is well-hidden on the palate, but it needs to mellow a bit. I want to rate it more highly, but I feel with some aging it will naturally build up to a better score."
"In short, it is a very good RIS, but there are definitely others that I would turn to if given the choice."
"Its a tad bit better than your average RIS in flavor, but elsewhere it is a knock-out. I'd drink it again in hopes the next year is even better, but never the same year twice if it never improves on the flavors."
"Overall a wonderfully balanced and tasty RIS. I have yet to be dissapointed by anything created by Duck-Rabbit."
"D - Despite the odd flavor, this one is disappearing quickly. I'd pick this up again, if only it were more available around here."
"Overall the aroma was more enjoyable than the flavor but still a pretty tasty brew."
"Served from tap into a 4oz tumbler. Pours pretty much black with a slight red hue with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, subtle coffee bean, and vanilla. The flavor was of roasted malt, subtle coffee, a nice alcohol sting, and subtle hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was better on tap than it was in the bottle in my previous review. I suggest if you haven't had this one before that you try to get your hands on it as you will likely not be disappointed."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Not awesome, but good. Definitely try if you have access, but not worth hunting."
"Quite pleasant. Typically good from this brewery. When are you coming to NJ? Not a session beer, but a deeply flavorful stout."
"D: I'd have to say average for an RIS (which is great for a one-off sipper, but not for extended drinking)."
"12oz bottle, pours black with a medium cappuccino head that fades to a creamy ring. Fairly roasty nose with some nice charred, ashy qualities. Quite roasty flavor, coffee bean dust and unsweetened dark chocolate. A bit overly bitter on the finish. Nice and creamy in the mouth. Pretty nice, if the finish were smoother or more interesting this would be quite a bit better. Thanks ShadesofGrey!"
"D - Exceptional for a big ass stout like this. Although it could be a tad less warming, as the alcohol is really the only thing interfering with the rest of the beer, but just barely. It is a fine line between pleasant and over the top."
"overall this is hands down one of the best of the style, i never shy away from this whenever i can get it. really just a delight."
"Pours a very black color with a touch of oil like viscosity that leaves a film on the glass. Huge fluffy mocha colored head that recedes down to a pleasant collar after a few sips. The aroma is equally impressive with notes of chocolate, marshmallow and peanut butter. Really delicate vanilla aromas of malted barley and cocoa powder. The flavor is complex and has a very deep dark fruitiness that lends itself to chocolate and espresso notes. The booze stings just a touch on the aftertaste but this is being drank around 60 degrees. Very nice and creamy otherwise. Mouthfeel has a dry finish with an alcoholic bite but is masked well by the dark chocolate flavors. This is over carbonated for the style and does show in it's huge head. For this it's uncharacteristic of the style and my preference. Drinkability is above average and gets my vote As a great Russian imperial stout. If you can find it, it's a must."
"I've got a few bottles, I think i'll let them sit awhile and check back in on them in a few months."
"Overall impression: Bold flavor profile, but it doesn't quite click with me. This could be a good candidate for aging, though; I may pick up a few to experiment with next time I see it."
"Stay thirsty my friends."
"Black with a light tan head...Aroma is sweet chocolate with some black licorice...Taste is off to me, lightly sweet to start chocolate which is ok but the finish is off to me. Its bitter but an off bitter, a medicinal bitter, chalky, just off and basically ruins it to me."
"D- Good, nice flavors and loads of scents coming through but the heavier body, slight alcohol burn and more than expected carbonation bring this score down."
"D: I enjoyed it, but it's not the kind of beer I'd be able to drink more than one of in one sitting. I am glad I have five more bottles in my possession though!"
"D: Awesome. Equivalent to Old Raspy."
"D: Good to very good, though the burnt aspect could be a bit distracting."
"This is full bodied, thick, creamy, coating and delicious! Very good drinkability for this big beer!"
"D-For 10% ABV,the alcohol is well-hidden.This brew is big and filling but I could easily see myself drinking a few of these."
"D: Could have another one of these without a problem."
"A very drinkable and unique beer for its style."
"d - I thought this was a great RIS. I thought it was well balanced and looked, smelled, and finished great. Would love to try again."
"D: Very nice beer with nothing to keep you from enjoying as many as you might like to have."
"The beer pours a blackish brown color with considerable creamy, tannish brown head. Retention is excellent, and there is considerable lacing. Frankly, appearance-wise, it doesn't get much better than this in a RIS. The nose is impressive, primarily due to the rich intensity of the aroma profile. I get a considerable amount of coffee, chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. In fact, the aroma really reminds me of a baby version of the Bourbon County Stout from Goose Island. Flavors generally replicate the nose, except the chocolate flavor leans towards dark chocolate, and the light hoppy bitterness seems to give the beer something of coffee ground flavor component. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner then I was expecting given the flavor profile, but nevertheless, it's still pretty full, rich and long. Drinkability is pretty good for a 10% beer, though needless to say, with a beer this rich and boozy, it's slow going working through my cheater pint. Regardless, this is a very fine beer, and one I was very happy to have the opportunity to try."
"Drinkability: Something that I can see myself drinking on a cold winters night watching a log fire. Considering this is summer, didn't get me in the beginning. Something I can see myself enjoying again but not at this particular occasion, but I do recommend to anyone interested in RIS. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is pretty great. Considering the abv it goes down quite easy and is nice and tasty. A good example for of the style for sure. I would certainly have it again and its worth a try if you see it."
"D - Very drinkable for an RIS. Doesn't taste like 10%. Luckily it's easy to find around NC."
"D: The beer does a relatively good job of hiding the alcohol. There's no way I could drink more than one of these in a sitting but it makes for a good sipper."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is a very strong RIS. One that I'm sad to say is not available anywhere near Kansas. The one downside to this beer is its lack of balance, but as some really love the malty sweetness of an RIS, that's not necessarily a bad thing because it's done so well in this case."
"D - Not cracking open the second bottle tonight... and there are four of us."
"Flavor is pretty good. Almost average at first, but once it warms a bit...loads of heavy roasted malts and coffee notes. Again, a very small vanilla hint torwards the end of each sip. Mouthfeel is medium body, creamy and smooth mouthfeel, and booze warmth isn't bad at all...doesn't drink hot for a 10% RIS. A very good beer, but nothing extreme really jumps out at me. Regardless, I'd definitely have this again."
"Overall, a decent RIS. I am really glad I finally got to try this one. I think all the DR products are legit and this is no excuse. Very roasted. It could be a little more complex, but still fairly decent. Relatively drinkable as well!"
"Jumped on this guy the second I saw it listed as being on tap at ChurchKey. Pours a deep opaque black with about a finger of tan foamy head. The lacing that will eventually form is very nice. The smell is of dark malts (grainier than usual), coffee, chocolate, and even a hint of vanilla bean. The taste is pretty similar, with notes of light coffee, slightly bitter cocoa, faint tobacco, and those dark malts from the nose, though they're wheatier here than before. Up 'til now, things have gone according to the usual RIS plot. Where things deviate is in the mouthfeel. Usually these dark beasts are thick, chewy, even crunchy, and coat the mouth very thickly. This guy is decidedly lighter than usual, more toward a light medium than anything heavy; the low carbonation is pretty normal, and there is some coating, but not as much as one would expect. Still, despite this unexpected variance on the style, the overall brew is very tasty and very drinkable."
"2.0 D: I wasn't expecting this to be the mess that it is. I love burnt roasty flavors, but this is too much without anything to put it in check."
"Despite that the bottle tells me no refill (sad face) and drink by 04/2009, this is delicious now. I really think this is an aging style beer, and I have no idea how Duck Rabbit can think otherwise. It's still even a little heavy and could use more time to settle a bit. At 10% and probably an OG of like 1.120, and despite not really having a boozy taste, it is really heavy and a little hot. I will try to save my others and really enjoy them in a few years' time."
"Is this drinkable, yeah, but nothing I would go out of my way for."
"D- Man I wish I had another of these. The alcohol makes no attempt at hiding but I love that about this beer. Its big, its mean, and I love it."
"I'd say that this is a good Imperial Stout but not a great one."
"Taste is very smooth, mouthfeel is supper crisp and warm, makes it super drinkable for an RIS. There's lots of coffee with light chocolate bitterness on the finish."
"Impression: This stout ain't for the finger food crowd. Bigggg, insane, flavors here! Howdaydooodat?"
"All told, the reason I made it through 6oz of this was so that I could give it a proper review. If it showed up at a tasting, I'd have poured it out a lot sooner."
"D: largadeer told me this is the worst imperial stout he's ever tasted. Personally, I don't see it; it's below average, but nothing outrageous. I wouldn't have it again."
"EDIT: I did consume a fresh one on 7/28/10 that was marked best by March 2011 and it was much better. I averaged the reviews together."
"D-Pretty high for me. I really enjoyed this one"
"D - I like this as o one, maybe two a night out... but not as a only drink of the night."
"M/D: Slightly thin mouthfeel and texture, which is surprising due to the style and the high ABV. The lack of carbonation isn't upsetting, nor is it surprising after the pour. Even so, this beer is enjoyable, and the vanilla is a really nice touch in the finish."
"Consumed: 2/1/2010"
"D: Drinkability is not as high as some of my favorites in the style, but a solid beer nevertheless."
"This one is nicely drinkable. As far as RIS's go, I'd probably put this one close to Old Rasputin, in the drinkability category. It's not quite that level, but it's close."
"O - this beer is great. It is definately something I will seekout again. I like this stout when compared to other stouts in the same class such as old Rasputin. Duck rabbit has a winner here."
"The initial flavor actually contains more hops than I smelled, but in addition to that there is the aforementioned fruit with tons more roasted malt than I smelled, almost to the point of it tasting somewhat burnt at the end. There seems to be a kind of blackberry tartness involved in the palate as well. There is a bit of heat at the end, but it's nothing that's not subtle. Awesome RIS, would always buy for its awesome and simple refinement."
"M-"
"Mouthfeel is on the heavier side and slightly creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, a very delicious stout that hides the abv very well."
"A great drinking beer. I wish this was available locally for me. Another beer I would love to age and also pair with food. Maybe in a dessert of some kind."
"Pretty decent stout but nothing amazing that I would consider trying again."
"I can tell this is a beer crafted with care and top quality ingredients, but it's just not for me."
"D: all I have to say is that I wish this one was available to me locally. It reminds me of this year's Darkness without as much sweetness. Very drinkable for how big it is and the alcohol is very well hidden. This one is a winner."
"All in all, this is a good stout that is easily attainable and a good representation of the style. It's on par with a Storm King or Samuel Smith but if I'm looking to get multiple bottles of a 12oz stout, I'm going for Expedition, Founders Imperial or Plead the 5th."
"Edit: I may be way off base... but if this is NOT what Rabid Duck is supposed to taste like.. I will renounce this review upon further batches .. but right now... I am just not enjoying it."
"D: A great take on the RIS style, really like the diversity of this kind of beer. A perfect night cap and very enjoyable. Recommend."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, I was thinking it was going to be fuller based on the thick pour. I guess it still has enough body to satisfy though. This is pretty easy drinking for such a full flavored, high ABV stout. I recommend this highly to anyone looking for a readily available RIS. Definitely beats out Old Rasputin and Storm King in my book."
"M/D - It has a medium-heavy body, low volumes of carbonation with small bubbles (clean beer) and is very smooth and creamy on the palate. No trace of alcohol flavor/burn even with 10% alcohol and it equates to a very nice sipper. As usual tastes better as it warms up a little bit!"
"Vintage - This bottle is from the Winter of 2008."
"D: I could definitely do a few of these. The alcohol was well hidden and I found it to have a rich flavor but not over the top. Certainly enjoyable. I haven't been let down by Duck-Rabbit yet."
"The beer is a deep black color, with a short brown head that faded slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. The aroma is loaded with creamy chocolate and dark roasted malts along with a faint touch of hops. The taste is starts with a strong bitter-sweet bite of dark chocolate and some dark fruit in the background. The malt character is just as hearty as any RIS out there and the hops presence is exactly as mild as you would expect to fit in with the style. The after-taste is bitter-sweet. Crisp and smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky. Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's a good beer, but there are other big stouts that I would choose first."
"Completely opaque black color with a creamy head the color of brown sugar. Milk chocolate and light roast coffee in the nose. Wonderful taste of chocolate, coffee, and a balancing acidity. This is a great RIS that doesn't leave you feeling dominated. This beer isn't trying to be extreme, but instead aims at a near perfect example of the style."
"Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. Thanks to Rogueone for sharing. This beer pours a flat black color with a thin brown head that recedes slowly. Stringy lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and toffee at first, followed by coffee and dark fruit. Rich body with flavors of chocolate, coffee, plum and malt. The finish is malty with notes of dark berry. Enjoyable all around."
"It was worth a try. Not a bad beer, but not a great one, either."
"Not my favorite Duck Rabbit to date..."
"This poured opaque black with moderate dark tan head. It smelled like milk chocolate with roasted coffee and burnt barley and some alcohol. It tasted like bitter chocolate and burnt coffee, with a bit of sour cherry and soy. It was thick with some carbonation, and had a dry bitter aftertaste. Overall this was an interesting beer with a weird sweet and sour flavor. It smelled good and had very nice body, but the strange flavor made this somewhat difficult for me to drink. It wasn't a bad beer, but it also isn't one I really care to drink again. I doubt it would improve with age either. Just not for me."
"D: Not sure I'd want this again, unless this happens to be a bad bottle and it usually tastes different."
"The thin character allows for increased drinkability... a very solid beer."
"Pours a great deep black color with slight garnet tinges, and has wonderful head and some nice lacing. Excellent deep scent, a great chocolate undertone, but with a hint of alcohol, too. Great deep taste, nice roasted grains with a great chocolate flavor and a warming alcohol taste at the end. Wonderfully smooth, althoug I'd have been a little happier with less of the alcohol flavor."
"It's big and bad with depth. Undoubtedly I'm a homer, and this is the best beer in the Carolinas. Even for a Russian Imperial, it's a complex beverage, and I suppose that detracts somewhat from drinkability. For a double-digit ABV RIS, however, it's one of few of which I'd have two."
"D - I've been slightly underwhelmed by Duck Rabbit since they recently entered the PA market a few months back... All there beers have be good, but didn't leave up to my elevated expectations... Rabid Duck delivers where the others fell short... It's aggressive and assertive... This is what I expect from the self proclaimed ""dark beer specialists."""
"Drinkability: I like this beer quite a bit actually and if I come across it again, I will likely pick a couple more up - I wouldn't mind letting one sit for about a year to see what might happen as I feel it's just a tad warm, but still very drinkable despite the big ABV (although I wouldn't attempt more than one in a sitting)... A nice way to unwind and relax after a 15 hour day."
"D: This is great.. it hides the alcohol pretty well, and isn't quite the punch in the face that other RIS's can be. Fairly well balanced, and delicious. BRING THIS TO OHIO!! This beer is dangerous. I am sure I am spiking the average here. but damn this is a nice beer, well crafted and tasty as hell."
"I got this beer several months ago and have been looking forward to try it---it didn't let me down! This tasted like a 'raspberry-chocolate' dessert infused with booze! I imagine that aging this would mellow out the alcohol and really improve it! A great beer from a brewery that I'm growing to love! Go Heels!! (Did that for you, Seth! Now send more!)"
"Because of the initial sweetness and the alcohol presence, I couldn't see myself drinking too many of these. I would certainly have this one again."
"This is a drinkable RIS. The appearance is a bit forgettable, but the smell & taste make up for it."
"Thanks to Leftmindedrighty for the trade. This is a dessert beer if I've ever had one. After having a few lighter beers I figured I'd finish with this. Pours pitch black with a tall light brown head. This beer is like a complex dark chocolate bar - the good, super-dark stuff. The aroma is chocolate syrup and graham cracker, while the flavor and feel is a mix of sweet and bitter cocoa with notes of citrus that almost make it tart. Pretty good RIS here."
"I can't wait to revisit this when it gets colder outside."
"Enjoyable stout. Nose was good, complex, rich and interesting. nice viscosity and some burnt drying bitters on the finish. Lighter in style and the alc was there but not in your face. nice sipper. got in trade as an extra and it was cool to try. not sure how much it cost. not sure i'd go back for more."
"Pours close to black with tints of redwood and a tan head. Nose has dark malts, cherries, chocolate, coffee, molasses and floral hops. Taste also quite sweet with lots of dark pitted fruit. Also some roasted malt, cocoa, bitter hops and espresso. Full body is well carbonated. Tasty stuff from the duck."
"Drinkability: Not high at all - in fact I might not finish this one. It is definitely unbalanced, and the smokiness almost pushes it to rauchbier standards. Definitely not for the faint of palate."
"The first sip tastes of roasted coffee and finishes with better chocolate. There is a bit of harshness due to the bitter chocolate. This is definately a sipper, I dont know if i could have more than one as it sits pretty heavy in the belly."
"Drinkability: Perhaps this was from a bad batch or it had been stored poorly before I got it, but this was really disappointing; I have had this beer previously and do not recall the carbonation and char flavors that marred this particular example; I'll try this another time and amend my review if it merits it"
"Pours black with dark tan head made up of fine bubbles and decent retention. The aroma has huge roasty notes followed by licorice, cardamom pods, burnt sugar, and dark fruit. Taste is of licorice and bittersweet chocolate, heavily roasted malts. Very full flavored with big roasty and herbal qualities. Full bodied with a style-sensible medium level of carbonation. An intense, tasty brew."
"Very nice big stout that hides its alcohol content very well."
"I think all the other DR brews (with the exception of Paul's Day Off) are pretty average at best, but this is miles ahead of them. Great beer."
"Drinkability is solid all around excellent version of the style. A perfect portion size, I'm okay with an occasional visit to 12 ounces of this brew, it's nice not having to commit to a bomber of some of the bigger beer styles."
"12 oz bottle. Pours black with a creamy beige head. Stays thick and leaves nice lacing. Strong smell of sweet coffee and some mocha. A bit of cherry/tanginess. Bitter roasted coffee ground taste with some tanginess. Some cocoa. Dry, bitter finish. Medium body with medium carbonation. Quite bitter; really a sipper. Unremarkable as far as RISs go."
"Drinkability: Overall a very solid brew, and one that makes me want to continue trying the other DR beers I can get my hands on. It's a big one, so be aware, but a good one."
"D- probably couldn't do more than 1 a night, but for style it's pretty good."
"D - Definitely a sipper. Different then most RIS, but a pretty good example."
"Pours a jet black with a one finger tan lace and a nice cling to the glass. This beer smells of predominately coffee and cocoa but there is also a hint of hazelnut. The hazelnut has a small presence that lends itself at the end. The taste is a combination of the cocoa and coffee flavors. I can't really get a sense of any hazelnut in the taste. Good strong combination of flavors that blend well together and form this beer. For its ABV this beer hides it. It is because of that that this beer could be dangerous if consumed in mass quanities. I have had other Duck-Rabbit offerings and have enjoyed all of them. I always mean to get a bottle of this and compare it to the other RIS and I think it holds up well comparitively."
"Wow what a stout, where do I start. Poured black and thick with a deep brown head. The nose was full of roasted malt, to me tending to be more of the coffee side then chocolate,also a smell of the 10% ABV. The taste was much like the nose, dark roasted malt flavors and alcohol. This beer is thick, it is like drinking dinner, and that's not a bad thing. Overall if your lookin for an Imp Stout this is a good one but I don't know if I could handle more then two."
"Good drinkability. Pretty boozy, but not too bad for a 10%ABV. This was my first beer from Duck Rabbit, and I look forward to trying a few more."
"D - This is a very tasty beer. The flavors are awesome. This is a RIS, so the alcohol is not hidden, and I'm not sure that it should be. This beer fits the style very well. Would like a tad more carbonation, but that is a very minor complaint. This is a one and done though at 10% abv. Curious as to how well this would age."
"Drinkability: This is a very large RIS. While the flavor is good, it's not exactly what I was looking for. I could imagine others loving this beer, but not me. Worth a try."
"Just pulled this one from the cellar earlier today and put it in the fridge. It's been down there for at least a year. Poured into a standard shaker ""pint"" glass, the stout appears a nearly opaque dark brown color with about two fingers of ecru foam. The head leaves a thin lace in it's wake. Smells of molasses, floral hops, dark caramel, milk chocolate, and alcohol. Tastes of prunes, molasses, slightly sour, cocoa powder, raisins, figs. The alcohol is not as obvious in the taste as it was in the aroma. Quite dry and bitter going into the finish. Slightly better than medium in body with adequate carbonation for an RIS."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slow fading rich head.Aroma is dominated by the chocolate.Taste is coffee,cocoa,smoked malts and alcohol.This is still a dangerously smooth beer even with the high alcohol.A very enjoyable brew.I recommend and would buy again."
"D: Suffers a bit from the excessive alcohol."
"All in all, this is a really good imperial stout. Very flavorful and it reminds me a bit of Expedition with the harshness of it."
"D: This beer is a bit harsh because of the high alcohol flavor and acridness of the molasses contribution. Not bad, but not a favorite RIS."
"D: Pretty damn good. For a high ABV beer I could definitely have another..."
"almost viscous and smooth, but marred once again by the acidity, which also just doesn't blend too well with the mild to moderate carbonation."
"D: As Moe Szyslak would say, ""it's not without its charm."" I wouldn't make it a go-to RIS, but it's a decent example of the style at a reasonable price."
"Overall, while this is much better than the milk stout, and a fairly good RIS, there are similiarly priced offerings that I much prefer, such as Great Lakes Blackout. Beef up the body and maybe a little more in the taste, we have a big winner."
"Bottle Pours a good hazy amber with a small tan head. The head last fairly well for being thin. Lacing is good. Aroma is honey and a big presence of alcohol. Almost has a whiskey like aroma. Has a light carbonation. A good mouthfeel. The flavor is well blended and the alcohol aroma doen't hold up the alcohol is well hidden. Has a full body. A real good finish and a good aftertaste. This is a good beer, a touch strong but a good beer."
"All in all, this is definitely a solid RIS in my book. Possibly my favorite Duck-Rabbit I've tried thus far. That being said, definitely not my favorite RIS, as the flavors with sour notes and boozy notes just don't quite do it for me. Maybe with more age it might mellow into something a bit more enjoyable, but it just wasn't quite at the top tier of the RIS category as I'd hoped. still solid and most definitely worth seeking out."
"A sipper however, drinkability is good. A very tasty RIS"
"Drinkability is quite good for a 10% ABV but this is really a beer to sip and see what you find. This is no run-of-the-mill RIS. I wish I had a couple more to sit on until the fall."
"D- Savor or indulge. Potayto/potahto."
"Mouthfeel is nice, with the lively bourbon and roastey flavors hitting the tastebuds in the right spots. It really is a very good example of the style, but I was expecting it to make its presence felt. Instead, it merely does its job."
"A good beer, especially for the price. I would like to try one with some age on it to see if the flavors meld together more. Something is missing with this beer and I feel it may be the hops or perhaps the type of hops that would help balance out the roasted notes in the beer. Again, still not a bad offering and a pretty good beer."
"Overall a pretty tasty beer, especially for the price. Not my favorite in this style, but a nice moderate change of pace. Will buy again for enjoyment and to support NC breweries."
"Tastes rich herbal hop on dark grains and decent hop bitter. OMG, yum. Nice intensity and balanced roast, black patent sour, ashy dry, and hoppy dry. Nice supprot malt sweet. Grassy blackberry hop flavor (Northern Brewer?). Clean alcohol has a gentle hand. Carbonation contributes with its own sting. Esters are mild, and the little I get could actually be from hop flavor. Thick body with fine carbonation poking through the dextrinous mouthfeel. Acid in my belly rises as heartburn...aicd from dark grains or maybe infected?"
"Be that as it may, this is one very solid RIS and wouldn't turn it down for nothings. It drinks down quite quickly."
"D- This stuff is good and damn drinkable for 10%. it's pretty much perfect and I could of drank more. I may need to find some on my next time down."
"D: It's a tasty beer. Not the top RIS I've had but the drinkability is higher than a Dark Lord. Interesting how it comes in 6-packs too, that's rare with RIS's."
"Fairly drinkable. The ABV seemed to be hidden in the flavors. More prevalent as it warmed. This didn't blow me away, but a fine example of a RIS. I would have again."
"D - definitely one of the best imperial stouts I've ever had. I'm glad I got a second bottle in that trade. As stated above, if you enjoy Nøgne Ø Imperial Stout, then this a beer for you."
"D- This one was easy to drink but not as ""imperial"" as most I have had. Not a bad offering and I wouldn't mind having it again if given the chance."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth, but thin for an Imperial Stout."
"Despite that lactic character, this profile of dark fruits, almonds, coffee and dark chocolate certainly worked for me; I thoroughly enjoyed the beer. This brewery's logo and name is lifted from an ambiguous figure drawing which the brain can see as either a rabbit or a duck, often depending on the time of year. Similarly, this beer can be seen as either really good or great; tonight I perceive the former but that answer, too, could change on any given day."
"D = Good at first but is so strongly flavored it gets a little bit cloying. I look forward to having this again, but at the same time I might be tempted to rate the drinkability higher if it only came in a nip bottle."
"Good but prefer imperial stouts with a little more sweetness."
"Gotta love the 12oz RIS. Great beer in a perfect portion. This one has some good complexity. It's also on the hoppier side of the RIS style, or at least the hops are more easily detected. Recommended."
"Recommended. A nice imperial stout (especially once warm enough) that seems to age for at least a couple years quite nicely."
"not what you expect or want from the style."
"J"
"D - Slightly to much of a dry bitterness, but a great dark chocolate flavor."
"D - Definitely a sipping beer but very enjoyable."
"Pours a pitch black and shiny color. There's a big brown fluffy head that stays around a while with some good lacing. Looks spot on. Nice. The smell is really great. A nice roasty backbone with some sweet notes. Not a strong whiff of alcohol, good balance in the smell. The taste doesn't quite meet my expectations. A good balance, not a strong alcohol presence. Too much black patent malt in this one, and also a bit estery. It gives it a kind of oily, slick feel and kills every bit of sweetness. I hate to be to poetic, but its kind of purple velvet in liquid form. You do get a taste of the roasted malts, and its drinkable and enjoable, but the taste isn't exactly for me. It's like a nice experiment that ought to be improved upon in the future. There are certainly nice qualities here."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's a good beer, but there are other big stouts that I would choose first."
"D - Overall, a nice example of the RIS style. Missing some of the complexity I find in higher-rated versions. Still, I'm looking forward to the other bottles I received."
"The power of this thing brings along the requirement to sip and savor. Wondering what it would taste like after a few months downstairs...or out of the tap..."
"Pours very black with a brown head. Reddish tones around the edges. An impressive looking brew. Strong burnt aroma with dark fuits. Strong roast coffee, slight mocha, port wine flavors. A fair amount of carbonation and certainly full bodied. A slightly fruitier take on the style than I prefer, but still excellent and worth trying."
"Overall, this was a very nice Impy stout worth trying. As for me, I would've like to have had more coffee flavor, but none the less, it's very drinkable."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgian globe. This beer pours a pitch oily black with just a hint of a dark brown head that quickly disappeared. The aroma of this beer is really chocolaty with coffee, roasted malts, and cherries. The flavor is chocolaty, a little bit of smoke, roasted malts, a bit of booze and an odd salty flavor. The mouthfeel is pretty average for Russian Imperial Stout. It's pretty smooth but nothing crazy. This is a beer I would really like to try again with some age on it. I think it could really smooth out some of its rough edges and odd flavors."
"D - Pretty solid RIS but I think some more age would really help this one out and help it mature despite the age already on it."
"Thanks again Grant, this is a delicious desert to the omelet I just cooked."
"Pours a solid black with a thin tan head that dissipates to a cap. Smell is vinous, with some roast, some chocolate and some dried dark fruits. Tastes of dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, and lots of dark fruits, a lactose sweetness and a slight ash and bitter roast in the aftertaste. Body is medium, Mouthfeel is oily/creamy, low but ample carbonation. Decent brew, not the best RIS I've had, but not the worst either. There is a sweetness in this brew that turns me off."
"My first Duck Rabbit is a positive experience! Go get some."
"D- not the most interesting RIS. one would be enough. not sure i would seek this one out again, but i thank yesac for the bottle."
"Body is medium to chewy, but not quite full. Easy to drink for the style, but it lacks that added punch to take it to the top tier."
"Mouthfeel is good and thick, carb. a little lacking, which is fine for the style. This is a very drinkable RIS, but not the top of the heap for me."
"Overall, pretty disappointed. Maybe these will get a little better with age. Definitely will be back to review this one in time."
"I picked up 2 bottles (1 for me + 1 ""on speculation"" as part of a trade) in Raleigh last week. I'd been looking forward to it, but too bad it turned out to be a little bit of a disappointment. The beer was dark opaque black with almost no head, despite a vigorous pour. The smell is a roasted malt type of RIS, definitely not what you'd call a hopped one. The taste was a little better, a little bit of fruit esters mixed with the roasted malts. Almost similar to Blackout Stout but only in spirit, it really wasn't near as fruity as Blackout. I'd say the body's good too, thicker than average. Adding it all up this is a solid RIS but not as amazing as I'd hoped from this brewery which focuses on dark beers. It might be my least favorite of the Duck-Rabbits I've tried so far."
"A spectacular offering from Duck Rabbit! Poured up black as ink allowing absolutely no light to pass when held up to a lamp. A finger thick medium brown foamy head rests on top. Smell is terrific. Unsweetened bakers chocolate, barrel aged dark rum, and used coffee grounds. Starts off delightfully bitter really showcasing the unsweetend bakers chocolate. Finishes moderately dry. The alcohol is certainly detectable, but the 10% is well concealed. If I were handed a pint of this and didn't know what it was, I would guess the abv to be in the high 7's, low 8's perhaps. Mouthfeel is heavy and *almost* oily, but not quite. In fact, if I could improve upon one aspect of this stout, I would want it oilier / thicker. When it comes to high abv super-heavy stouts, especially when it's starting to get chilly at night, they cannot be too heavy, imo. Outside of that, this is an absolutely brilliant stout!"
"The last of all the Duck Rabbit beer styles i've tried. I love this brewery. As the label states the ""dark beer specialists"" a title earned. Wish these beers were avalible in my area is my only complaint with this brewery."
"D - This is a very good RIS that is almost port-like."
"I hope to see a lot more of this beer in my near future!"
"Drinkability: Definitely going to be buying another bottle of this, if only to verify that this one wasn't quite up to snuff - I know Duck Rabbit's new, so I can forgive a little quality control issue every once in a while (since everything else I've had from them in solid), and I'm sure that a proper bottle of this will be much better. Expect this review to be updated! That all out of the way, the alcohol on this one is reasonable, though a little on the high side, though all the proper, expected, tasty notes are present. Give it a shot."
"I'm glad I got to try something special from this small brewery specializing in ""dark"" beers."
"D- I could drink lots more of this for sure."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - A great RIS, gives you everything you've come to expect from the style. Well worth seeking out."
"D - A little sweet to drink many of these."
"D= A damn fine beer from a brewery that seems to be an up-and-comer. Though I cannot easily get this beer, I would definitely drink more of it should some become available."
"One neat thing about strong stouts is that the flavor seems to change over the course of the session (and this one is no different) which adds to drinkability! Still, at 10% ABV, you probably should not overdo this one."
"Not something I would buy again, but if it was on tap at Trappeze, I would definitely give it a shot."
"Body and carbonation could stand to be a bit more substantial. Good clean finish with a pleasant warmth from the booze."
"D: very drinkable for 10%; kinda scary"
"Definitely worth seeking out."
"Overall this is an interesting beer. I've never tasted an RIS with this type of ending note. It's good, but not great, but either way it's worth a shot."
"Pours jet black with a tan head. In the aroma, chocolate, roasty malt and a huge coffee presence. In the taste, roasty coffee, and just a hint of chocolate. A smooth and big bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry coffee, small hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. Nice big flavor, and hide alcohol quite well."
"Mouthfeel is quite big, however there's a tingly carbonation that I get with each sip that takes away from the viscous, creaminess I usually enjoy in an imperial stout. It's not as heavy as I expected, but it still drinks like a meal. Overall, a tasty brew to have as a night cap on a chilly evening in Illinois. I would grab this one again if I had access to it. Cheers to Duck Rabbit and to Pop The Cap for making this 10% brew a legal reality!"
"D : It's easy to drink but the alcohol detracts from it. I'd definitely like to try some aged."
"Overall a decently drinkable beer. It's nice to sip, and has plenty of character. The taste does grow on me, but it's too bitter, overwhelming what seems from the smell to be a nicely complex rich deep Imperial Stout. Had a bottle of this stuff a while back and I remember thinking it was a lot better than this one."
"Beers goes down easy, considering the style, not too thick, robust taste though. A fantastic beer!"
"Full-bodied with a slick and oily mouthfeel. Definitely a sipper. Enjoyably complex, but very strong, and one bottle is definitely enough."
"This Imperial Stout pored in to my Portsmouth tulip glass came out a black as black can be color, with a small tan heading. Nose contains a mix of dark and milk chocolate, some bitter coffee bean, molasses chew, and a hint of must. Taste has dark burnt chicory in it, molasses and soy sauce (seems like it would pair very well with barbecue). Alcohol adds a bit of mild fruit beneath the smoky barbecue aspect of it. Body is not bad at all, but doesn't quite measure up to the strong flavors present in this beer. To me, if the tastes are that strong, so should the girth of the beer, body and alcohol wise. Drinkability is lowered slightly by some of the strong numbing flavors, but is still very respectable. This is my first beer from the guys at Duck Rabbit, and I am not disappointed. While it didn't quite deliver on all fronts, it is a fine stout that is more than worth a purchase. Thanks to Todd to introducing me to this brewery. Hopefully there will be more tastings in the future. Cheers"
"Unsubtle but utterly delicious, Rabid Duck's 10% is felt and tasted, so it's a slow night-capping sipper if anything. One of Duck-Rabbit's best (and one of the beer names for any beer, anywhere). Duck-Rabbit have more than earned their reputation as a ""dark beer specialist""."
"darker and grittier as it warms. More chocolatey, richer, more complex...bigger, better...dark, deep, and dry...nice stuff. Brilliant, really. I'm liking. Seriously."
"D: Pretty good."
"Pours nearly midnight black, with some dark brown highlights around the edges, tiny tan head rises, minimal lacing. Smell is big-time dark chocolate, and loads of dark fruits. Taste is extremely interesting on this one. I feel like I'm getting a ton of raspberries... tastes like raspberries covered in melted dark chocolate, some raisin and fig in there as well. Mouthfeel strikes me as a little thin for the style, but there's plenty of spicy, mouth-warming alcohol in the mix. Some surprising tastes in this one, but certainly well worth seeking out."
"Thanks to ThirstyBird for the opportunity to try this one. Served in my DFH snifter. Best by 07/09 notched on the label. Poured an opaque brown, just shy of black. Quarter inch tan-colored head quickly dispersed into foam and ringlets as it eventually coalesced into a band around the edges; only spots of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is big, sweet and malty. I picked up coffee, chocolate, dark fruit and brown sugar. Taste is consistent with nose; dark fruit really comes out in the mouth and there is even a bit of tartness that is revealed. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium-bodied and is silky smooth with a little effervescence in the background. Drinkability is good, but not great. Flavors push the fringes of the style, but alcohol is fairly well-hidden. Fruit flavors are a little too big, however, and overwhelms the palate. Elements remind me of an RIS, Baltic Porter and Export Stout. Interesting interpretation nonetheless."
"D - This is a pretty good RIS It easy to drink tastes good and is pretty smooth going down the alcohol is hidden well in this beer too its worth trying sometime."
"Interesting take on a RIS by Duck Rabbit, going very heavy with the dark fruit character. It works well though, bouncing off the thick sweetness that is also heavily featured. A sipper for sure but a steady one at that, have one now and save the rest for winter."
"D - This is big and bold, and 12 oz might be a bit much. Still very good though."
"D: The bitterness seems a bit high on this one but its relatively well balanced. Mixed in with the high ABV and its far from a session beer. However, it is relatively easy to drink compared to others in the style."
"The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery does non-big beer pretty well. Although I haven't been blown away by anything in their lineup, most of them have been solid. Barleywine and Rabid Duck aren't so special. Hopefully, it's nothing that a whole heapin' lot of tinkering can't fix."
"After thinking about this whole review process, I wonder if it's en vogue to just assume that the Imperial Russian's are all decent. I've been confused by the praise of more than a few RIS', including Ten Fidy, Jah-va (not a good beer, to me, at ALL), and now this one. Maybe the best of this variety is world-class, I agree, but let's not get excited with a ""small batch"" RIS just because. Let's make those beers prove themselves. Just my own 2 cents."
"The body finishes sweet with a lot of esters. Good carbonation. Overall more of an American Imp Stout but has some hints of Belgian Dark Strong really changes this beer. I would love to try to this after a few years, should be great."
"overall, wow this is a very good brew i wish i could get it around here"
"I love NC but we don't exactly stand out on the beer map... this beer is awesome though and I'm glad I can get it and store it away for a special occasions."
"d: Thanks to WeisGuy for the extra. Very nice RIS from the south."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Flavor is good. Alcohol is fairly high, however well hidden. Combines to be quite a drinkable brew."
"Buy Buy Buy. Beautiful beer. I don't like coffee, and this is less coffee than most RIS."
"Drinkability/final thoughts- Overall this is an excellent example of the style. I really like the faint traces of smoke. I do have to admit that this beer started at a disadvantage for me as I just had some Kate the Great last week, but I was still not disappointed. A great beer that I'll be excited to try again after some aging."
"D: This is a heavy brew, perfect for a dessert brew. It will overwhelm and challenge the palate. This is probably the best brew I have had from Duck Rabbit. Pretty damned balanced and well rounded. Absolutely a great example of the style. Makes daddy happy."
"Pours a thick black, no head really to show for this pour. Aroma is more of a coffee almost a chocolate or molasses smell there. Surprisingly the taste isn't at all over powering. You don't really get anything at first but then malt sneaks up on you to let you know they are around. Taste is really a malty coffee taste. It is mild though unlike most Imperial Russian Stouts this one is rather tame. I get very little after taste with this beer. It definitely ranks up there as one my favorites"
"Overall: This is rich, dark and delicious with a lot of character and certainly a ton of aging potential. This beer will be much better with a year on it I can say that for certain and could age for a much, much longer time than that. Seeing as it comes in packs buy one and drink one of these every 6 months and go on the journey."
"Overall: Damn delicious. Given the (inconceivable) opportunity, I'd absolutely drink it daily. Yes, really."
"T + M + D: A bit of a puckery bitter cocoa powder, roast malts, a touch of caramel, espresso. A creamy and full mouthfeel - something I often expect from the style, but continue to love when I get it. This reminds me quite a bit of Ten FIDY, and I'd go so far as to recommend it to fans of that. Likewise, as I felt about the Ten FIDY, it can get a little big after a while, but that seems to be the point."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Sweet and slightly creamy upfront. Flavors of black cherry and molasses follow but are soon overtaken by a sharp acrid bitterness. The body is slightly thin for the style though carbonation is spot-on. A dry finish pronounces the burnt flavors even more - this is a harsh brew with an acidic kick."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth with a lick of oiliness that coats your palate making the flavors linger. Low carbonation add to the smoothness and ease of drinking. Not good at 10% ABV... or is it?"
"This comes out of the tap a rich, opaque sable with a dark tan head. Aroma is strong, like smoky or roast coffee with a hint of sweet chocolate. The rich, smoky, coffee-ish flavor has an undertone of chocolate and a whisper of sweetness. This delightfully smooth stout fairly dances on the tongue and is a joy to drink."
"A pretty decent, moderately orignial, stout with some tangy fruitiness to it."
"This is what I like in an RIS. Highly recommended."
"The Rabid Duck sported a label with the Duck-Rabbit donning a Russian fur hat. The pour looked more dark brown than the inky blackness typical of other RIS beers. The brown head over the body was quite thin. The smell was a little too mild for what this was. I detected coffee, cocoa, and toffee in the nose. The taste was where this seasonal release started to come into its own. The level of roasty and hop bitterness detected in the first sip was completely unexpected based on the smell. This was followed by a lot of coffee and bitter chocolate. The finish was astringent and grainy. Quite dry for the style with not much in the way of fruit or residual sugars. The alcohol was apparent due to the warmth but not blatant. Quite a bit thicker feeling in the mouth than it looked. Quite American in character with a heavy West Coast style hop profile. This should be one of the prime candidates for aging, and I can't wait a few years to get some verticals going."
"First sip reveals fine yet tingly carbonation and an average body with slightly oily texture. Flavor is heavy on malts with raisins, baker's chocolate, roasted malt, again almost smokey, and warming booze on the finish. The booze lingers and makes the beer a definite sipper. No hidden alcohol here. But for the style I expect a little kick. A pretty tasty beer, but not for the faint-hearted."
"D: A sipper, and I wouldn't want more than one/day, but I'd be happy to open another one tomorrow."
"Smooth and creamy with fluffy carbonation. Great drinkability."
"D: This one could definitely use a little bit of aging. The flavors all seem to be there, but it's not as drinkable as I would like and I think it would improve over time."
"definately an interesting take on russian imperials, this is my first duck rabbit brew and it most certainly won't be the last."
"I am so thrilled to have gotten some Duck Rabbit brews via Beer Powerball. If this is any indication, I am going to be begging for more."
"This is a good beer, but there are many other RIS's that I prefer. I loved the first Duck Rabbit brew that I had (their Brown Ale), but this one let me down a little."
"D: very nice brew, shockingly from NC. very tasty and worthy of a try."
"Drinkability - a fine sipper from DR, gets better with age!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is low, but it works well in this instance. Mouthfeel is relatively smooth. At 10% abv, it's a big beer. I'd definitely be limiting myself to one per sitting. That being said, it's a fine tasting beer that's quite drinkable. Hmmm. Rabbit? Duck? I'm not sure. But, the rabid characterization I'll agree with. This is a good beer. Certainly one I recommend if you happen to bump into it."
"Milk chocolate and dark fruit sweetness lead it off. Notes of toffee, coffee, and smoky peat malt mix in. Turns very bitter and almost astringent soon after and lasts through the long finish. Herbal and coffee bitterness is very intense and a little too much for the malt sweetness up front. Slightly boozy and warming. Some fruit sweetness comes through in the finish. Full bodied, chewy feel. Not bad, but a little unbalanced and might need some time to settle down a little!"
"Pours a rich dark black color with a thin layer of light brown colored head that is awfully bubbly, and thick. Smell is of rich malty notes with chocolate, toffee, some anise, and dried fruits. Taste is very malty sweet with a lot cocoa. Plenty of warming feeling and a full, rich, chewy mouth feel. Nice brew, but I think I like their baltic porter a little better."
"Pours black, minimal head. Classic bold bitter RIS though only average mouthfeel, and extra coconut chocolate in there for sweetening and drinkability. A little oily as well. A nice RIS for sure, but a bit disapointed in relation to the ratings. I think this part of the world need get used to a wider sampling of what an RIS is."
"P.S. Love the graphic on the label. That's a keeper."
"A bit too sweet and boozy, but drinkable with slow, slow sipping. Not the most complex or drinkable (even considering the abv level). An aggressive RIS."
"D_This one is alright but it really isn't doing it for me. Still it is a good one to try and not bad by any means. Nice pairing with some dry aged white cheddar though"
"D - my notes say ""w00t!"" and I'm sticking to that! A great RIS from Duck Rabbit. Would certainly drink again and buy or order if available. Definitely give it a shot"
"Ridiculously pitch-black, with a thick dark brown head that lasts for quite some time. Nose is sweet brown sugar, lots of toasty malts, and slight soy sauce. Taste is sweet, heavily roasted malts. Mouthfeel is RIS-ey. Drinkability is ok, except for the ABV. A very solid RIS!"
"Drinkability- As much as I loved the nose on this one (maybe just because it was different), I really wasn't impressed by the taste. It was just too off the charts for me as an RIS, flavor wise. I didn't like the different sourness (I fear change) that took place before the rather nice aftertaste. Worth a try but not really my cup of tea. Big thanks again to Toby for the opportunity!"
"The mouthfeel isn't as full bodied as I hoped it would be. Also, it was overly carbonated for my liking, as far as an RIS goes. Thee have been in my cellar since June of '07, and I will see how they change with some more age under their cap."
"Anyway this is a good beer and I appreciate its unrepeated profile."
"I'd drink it again but one a sitting is enough. I was very impressed with this brewery I would love to try more of their brews"
"M/D: Full body, carbonation felt on the tongue. This one is a sipper. Very full with enough alcohol character to let you know what you are getting into. Still, a very nice beer."
"D: Definitely a sipper. This had been aged just a bit but the alcohol was still present and a huge body will make the drink last. A nice beer that I'll look for during my next summer vacation down south. Would love to see have 1-3 years would do."
"This one was very dark with thin brown edges and ruby highlights. It poured with a fizzy, dark brown head that formed a thick ring and left a little chunky lacing on the glass. The aroma was boozy, licorice, and chocolate at first, followed by some toffee and mild roastiness. The bitterness was a little bit sharp and centered on the back of the palate. It had a pleasant sweet caramel flavour with notes of licorice, sour cherry, semisweet chocolate, and roast throughout. The sour cherry and roast, along with a bit of alcohol, really lingered. The carbonation was on the coarse side, but the texture was still alright - a bit creamy with a full body. This is pretty good stuff right now, but it seems like it might improve with a little bit of age. If the flavours mellowed and melded a bit, this would be incredible stuff."
"Appears black in the glass with a light mocha colored head that retains pretty well. Roasted charcoal aromas paired with some earthy hoppiness, booze, and vinous smells. Taste begins quite ashy and earthy, maybe a bit vegetal too. It does transform into sweeter caramel flavors as it sits on the tongue, with a roasty finish, but doesn't start off good and finishes rather weak. I think I also got some lactose and cherry flavored Tootsie-Pop flavors too. Nice thick, full body, but it is too carbonated, which takes a way a little. This just seemed to be missing a lot for me, maybe I'll need to visit this one again sometime."
"Pours to a thick motor oil black body hosting a rocky two finger milk chocolate colored head with nice staying power. Nose is very sweet with tones of smokey malt, spicey alchol and lots of dark over ripe fruit. Enters the mouth with a scattered sour feel but quickly yeilds to a long burnt bitter. Some sour dark fruit notes are there that resemble plum and grape skin in the underripe form. Almost as if it were brewed with sour cherries. The sour and bitter really battle on the mouthfeel. I dont know if this was the desired effect of the brewing or just a result, but drinkability isnt nearly as high as many other Impy stouts."
"A damn fine RIS. I'd like another."
"Pretty drinkable for such a big rich beer, but sip this one. Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for sending it north."
"Overall a great RIS and very nice for the style."
"Drinkability is ok a decent stout that probably will get better with time as many of the style do. Want to thank Enola for letting finally try this one."
"drinkability - Loved this, was looking forward to drinking some stuff from Duck Rabbit. Would buy this again, real nice drinker here."
"This beer is from the 2006 bottling and a year has definitely improved it. My first one slapped me around pretty seriously, but after a year, the flavors have melded together in a very satisfying way. This RIS and the Baltic porter are my two favorite Duck Rabbit beers. The people who run this brewery are nice folks and beers like this one are evidence that their success is well deserved."
"First impression is not as favorable as the look and smell but it is still nice. Full or dark roasted maltyness, smokiness and some bakers chocolate bitterness. Also some plums and other dark fruits. Very full big beer. The 10% shows itself with some nice warming. Almost a sipper but very enjoyable. Best of the bunch from Duck Rabbit so far by a mile. I have the barleywine left to review but it will have to be very good to outdo this one."
"Recieved this beer from brouche, in the No B.S. BIF Ultra (thank you). Served at cellar temperature in a snifter, from a twelve ounce brown bottle. Three full fingers of thick, tight, bubbly coffee brown head formed, and stuck around almost all the way through. Generous amounts of lace clung to the sides of the glass. Awesome nose on this brew. Thick chocolate aromas dominated, some roasty/toasty notes, and just a hint of freshly brewed coffee. So far so good. Taste was on point as well. Very bitter up front with some thick coffee flavors, tons of semi-sweet chocolate, some nice roasted malt flavors, and a little bit of hops and smoke in the background. Finishes a little boozy but is pretty smooth. Has a thick, full bodied, almost chewey mouthfeel. Drinkability is great despite the high ABV."
"D: This is a rather enjoyable RIS due to its complexity, and mainly because the alcohol presence is sharp, yet complementary to the flavors. What I mean to say is that this beer's transitions are quite fluid, as opposed to some others of the style I have tried. Big, bold, yet it all comes together quite nicely."
"Adam I can't thank you enough, man do you send the good shit!"
"Bottom line: Another RIS that is worth seeking out. Buy it locally, or trade for it. You should not be disappointed."
"Drinkability: Some stouts, you just feel compelled to revisit to drink and enjoy every waking moment of the day. I totally understand if Rabid Duck was that for many (many) people. I dunno. I just wasn't taken with it."
"Pours a thick dark, syrupy black color, tan head settles fairly quickly. Sweet and hoppy aroma, light hints of coffee and chocolate. Coffee & chocolate comes thru even bolder in the taste, complemented by a hint of vanilla. Very nice. Mouthfeel is very full bodied, thick and syrupy. A strong, big & bold RIS. 10% abv can kind of sneak up on you, so i'd probably stop after one bottle of this."
"Thanks for the brew, received courtesy of the CEO / Old farters BIF from unclejedi"
"Feel free to just sit and sniff this one. If the charcoal ever fades from your palate, that is. Actually, I paired this one with an aged sharp cheddar which made it far more drinkable."
"Drinkability: Too big and heavy to have more than one of. Very good to sit with and take your time."
"Pours dark with a finger of mocha head which quickly dissipates and leaves behind a nice ring and thin layer of foam. The aroma is roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, toffee, dark fruits, cherry, and alcohol. You can tell from the aroma that this will be a big and heavy hitter. Taste has loads of roasted malts as well as coffee, chocolate and alcohol is quite present also. As the beer warms up a bit I also detect some dark fruits like prunes, raisins as well as chocolate covered cherries. Mouthfeel and carbonation are quite good, maybe a little less carbonation would help as I feel my tongue getting a little numb. Enjoyed this one a bit more once I let it warm up."
"Pours an opaque black with a big chocolate milk head that dies much quicker than I thought it would and laces sheets around the glass. Smells of big roasty malt, ground coffee, a hint of alcohol that reminds me of a cherry/rum chocolate. Tastes earthy, alcohol, chocolate, ground coffee and fig. Full in the mouth with lively carbonation on the tongue. Though alcohol is present, the ABV is well hidden. A sipper for sure. Another tasty brew from duck rabbit!"
"M&D - a decent beer, well brewed, and nice flavors, just a bit to acidic, enough to make me pucker as i sip it, but the flavors are intense, accurate, and highly palatable, wish i lived closer to this brewery, so far they're 2 for 2"
"Drinkability- Dark smoked beer fans will really enjoy this one. Overall I really liked it, but it was a bit too over the top for me. Had a alcohol bite to it as well, which I failed to mention in the taste category. I imagined a light version of WW Stout when I was drinking this."
"Mouthfeel-Alcohol is very present but it dissipates as the rich dark and roasted malts linger on the finish. Gets sweeter as well. I get a little sour taste like a milk stout- good not bad. This mellowed a bit as it warmed up. Actually quite drinkable for 10%. I was up late cooking stuff for a wedding shower and this gave me sustenance. Duck Rabbit makes choice brews and this ranks up there."
"Drinks easy for the ABV, a lovely IMP stout & a positive result of the cap popping in NC! Highly recommended"
"Poured into a chalice a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tannish head, which then left some nice slicks and sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose was malty, oaky, slightly roasted, some bourbon, and a good dose of toffee, caramel. The taste is malty, a nice blast of toffee/oak/roast at first sip, then there is a nice slightly dry, toffee/burnt oak finish. The ABV is hidden pretty well, nice warming feel. Medium body, nicely balanced brew. Very drinkable, a very nice/tasty RIS from DR, highly recommended."
"As most know, the best Imperial Stouts dont peek until at least the 1 year mark and I have a feeling this will be really great at that point. Im glad I have a number of bottles.."
"OK drinkable but I am probably spoiled from getting Stone RIS pretty much any time I want it. A good RIS on the coffee end of the spectrum, but not a great one. Great looks and OK flavor this is worth a try but not top of the class."
"Surprised to pick this up for less than $2 a bottle at a local BP store. Looks like I grabbed some from the last six pack of the year there. Pours nice opaque color with a creamy brown head. Little carbonation and the lacing doe snot stick to the glass. Lots of burnt malts most present. Medium body and a bit on the difficult side to consume when it's 90 degrees outside. Still nice to see the first (?) Russian Imperial Stout made in NC."
"Drinkability is good. It's definitely an above average RIS. Not quite up to snuff with some others in the style. But it's still a quality brew, from a good brewery."
"recall in an RIS, hence it's one I'd have only occasionally were it available to me (thanks to grynder33 for forwarding this one). A sipper, of course, and one that took me some time to finish, but one I'd recommend as a quality example of an awesome style."
"As the beer warms up, the vegetal character in the finish lets up just a touch, not enough to not be noticeable though. Regardless the beer is still too acridly roasted, with notes of burnt grain-husk bitterness, and a burn malt driven acidity, both of which also come to a head in the finish."
"Pours a deep dark black, red edges, huge crazy brown head, fills the glass, leaves some nice lacing, solid layer. Smell is very sweet, very malty, lots of licorice, cherries, some chocolate, apples, bit of sourness, pretty intense. Taste is intense as well, huge licorice hit, lots of cherry, chocolate roast, bit of alcohol, more chocolate in the finish, bit of sourness, but very smooth. Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick, with low carbonation, very rich beer. Thanks Russ!"
"Flavor is exquisitely complex and true to the style. Lots of dark caramel and dark chocolate in the malts. Heavy and dark fruits such as cherries, figs and prunes. Even something akin to a grape. Thick and vinuous mouthfeel. And none of this masks the heat. This beer will definitely balance down in time and mellow out a bit in my opinion."
"D: Lots of potential, but this one is too hot right now. If the alcohol settles a bit with some age, this is going to be quite tasty."
"Very dry and slightly bitter RIS...lacks some of the dimension found in many others. Average at best."
"The body is fairly large with a fairly dry and roasty feel. The carbonation is a bit crisper than I would care for in this style, but it does seem to make the flavors a little more sharp. A sipper for sure, but I don't think I would object to drink more than one of these in a night if given the option. Reminds me a lot of my first attempt at a homebrew Imperial Stout if I would have been patient enough to let more of the sweetness ferment out, and perhaps added a little licorice and anise to the mix."
"Man this is a monster tannic beer. Very bitter hops on the lengthy finish. Alcohol shows through in the mouth but not in a bad way. Bone dry creation with dark fruits and 90% cocoa/dark chocolate slapping your tongue on the mid-palate. Haven't taken another sip for a few minutes and the finish is still lingering. What depth with very complex tight wound flavors. Same black currant, plumy flavors as the nose showed. Without any sign of red cherry however. A bit of an herbal quality on the finish as well. Very good beer but so tannic right now it would be hard to drink many. Would love to see what this can do in a few years. A somewhat unpleasant aspirin flavor is showing on the finish now as I drink this."
"D: At 10%, this is no quaffing brew. In moderation though the flavors are intense and will not disappoint. Nice one from the dark beer specialists."
"D  This is a very good RIS, and while I recommend itthe bold flavor might make this not the easiest beer in the world to drink steadily."
"D- I am not a fan of this at all. It is to rough around the edges and rich in the malt department. I prefer a bit more hops in there to help balance it a bit and if you want to make it that rich you need to add in something like molasses or something to break it up."
"Baltic Porter still remains my favorite from Duck-Rabid but this is a contender."
"What I really liked was the mouthfeel. Smooth, a bit of velvet, nice. Definitely bumps up drinkability. This didn't last long. Very nice."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol is balanced pretty well, but it's still a pretty big beer. great to split with a friend on a quite brew day though. my first duck-rabbit experience has definitely been a god one. thanks again larry!"
"Jet black color-ever so slight tan head and some great lacing as it goes down the glass. Muted roast aroma. Licorice and a mild espresso flavor dominate. Very nice grainy flavor. Great lingering bittersweet chocolate taste. Body is right on for style and the grainy sort of flavor really carries over to the mouthfeel. This is a damn fine beer. Re-reviewing here as I am much more impressed this time round. Might be a fresher bottle who knows. Sure wish I could get these beers locally."
"Bottle courtesy of Moejuck: Poured a deep black color stout with a small dirty brown color head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma of coffee is quite dominating with some weird dry hops. Taste is a mix between some dry coffee, some bitter roasted malt and a dry ending with some hops. Body is quite full with some low carbonation and no alcohol was discernable. I thought the taste was just way too dry to be enjoyable and would have appreciated some sweetness to balance this thing out. Quite glad I got the chance to try this but cant say I truly enjoyed the experience."
"Overall this is a very interesting and complex RIS. However, I think some of the licorice flavor overstays it's welcome."
"Cheers."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, slightly astringent with a touch of grainy tartness, with plenty of nuts and ripe fruit lingering on until the bitter finish."
" Drinkability - easy to drink, lots of rich and robust malt flavor, very well hidden alcohol, easily one of my favorite Duck-Rabbit brews."
"-Hides it's alcohol fairly well."
"Pours black with a tan to pumpkin pie orange colored head that slowly recedes. Aroma is strong of roasted barley with a fair amount of smokiness, burnt wood. A malty sweetness smells nice and chocolately and mixes with the roastiness in a cola like aroma. Nice cola and more subtle chocolate sweet maltiness roll over the tongue. A roasted flavor mixes with an acidic tanginess towards the finish. There is anise flavor throughout the taste. Heavy in body, smooth and rich up front with a tanginess and drying finish. Alcohol is nearly unnoticeable, incredibly balanced. A very good imp stout, it's best quality to me is that there quite a few flavors and aromas going on, but not one seems to dominate. Instead they all seem somewhat subtle and blend together very well."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a good medium brown head that lasts for a while and leaves some pretty decent lacing as well. The smell is winey and with a touch of soy sauce, but there are also rum soaked raisins there. The taste is very nice. More rum, bitter chocolate, a touch of light coffee, and some roasted grain. A little thin on the mouthfeel, and could be creamier, but the lingering bitterness helps give it structure, and the alcohoilis well hidden. Pretty drinkable, but its a big beer and fairly intense."
"Pours a very dark brown with plenty of froth on top. Smell is of dark chocolate, roasted malt and cherries. Yeah, I think there is some definite cherry, fruit notes coming through moreso in the taste now. A different twist on an Imperial stout, but Im digging it. Mouthfeel is full, thick and non-cloying. This is a very solid imperial stout that is able to separate itself from the others via its distinct taste. Would love to try again."
"Finally got around to reviewing this beer. Very nice offering from Duck Rabbit. I have a feeling this would get even better with some age. Unique fruitiness and sweetness for an RIS - very different from any other RIS I've tried."
"I received this 12oz bottle in a trade with some kind soul here on BA (can't remember whom). This poured a dark black with a tan head. The smell was roasty and not much else. The taste had roasty notes, charred notes, and was thick. I was expecting a little more given how great the Baltic Porter is. The alcohol was well hidden in this one making it easy to drink."
"Acquired as part of a trade with drunkmonk; appreciate the opportunity!!"
"Taste has some nice nutty flavors: chestnut, almond & walnut. Chocolate present as well. Has a thick smoothness to it with a nice bitter coffee/semi-sweet chocolate bite. Overall, it's complex, flavorful and a solid beer. If I were more of a dark beer lover, I'd be rating this higher."
"This is an impressive brew with turbo kicked in. I am very glad to have come across this and will gaurd the remaining stash. Thanks Weisguy for the easy trade and opportunity!"
"Great offering from Duck-Rabbit which is becoming NC's best brewery with some awsome seasonals and a nice base of regular offerings."
"This is a good beer, but I couldn't drink more than one at a time. As it warms, the alcohol burning really comes through, so I'd suggest drinking this one rather quickly, at a cool temperature that hasn't warmed to room temp yet."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite RIS, but solid."
"The taste is a different story, with heavy alcohol draping itself all over the sip and aftertaste. Nice chocolate and espresso flavors and resonant hopping keeps your eyes wide open in spite of yourself. High bitterness battles deep malt throghout the aftertaste. This is manageable thanks to a thick, syrupy mouthfeel that coats and soothes. It's as good as I was expecting but a little intensely alcoholic and flavorful for multiples. Wow. Looking forward to their next concoction here in NC."
"D - Very drinkable for a big stout. The alcohol presence never overwhelms and the body lends to easy drinking. I enjoy drinking it and can't wait to open one in about 6 months to see where it's going."
"Pours a deep brown black with light tan head that quickly diminishes. Some lacing on the glass. Smell could be stronger but pleasant burnt malts and espresso. Taste is exceptional, espresso with its associated bitterness and oil feel. Little going on in the way of chocolate. Nice long finish with some bitter hops and a bit more chocolate coming through as the beer warms. Duck-Rabbits really dark beers are highly enjoyable."
"Finally got my hands on some of this stuff after missing out last year due to availability problems. A reliable source told me DR has stepped up production of it's limited release beers. The beer poured totally black with a nice 1 inch tan head. Aroma was quite roasty and coffeeish, very espresso-like with some bitter hops mixed in. Taste was excellent. Lots of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, dark rum and burnt flavors along with a bitter hoppy finish. Warming alcohol was there, but it didn't detract from the drinkability at all. Mouthfeel was thick and rich, the way an Imperial Stout is supposed to be. Excellent offering from the ""dark beer specialists""."
"D - Yes sir, may I have another?"
"This is one hell of a stout. Very rich dark-coffee roasts in the smell and taste. Creamy texture leads to a thick appearance with good retention and a smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol comes through in the taste a bit, but is well hidden considering the percentage. A pleasant burn on the way down and a nice over-all warming complexity. A perfect, day-ending treat."
"Poured into a pint glass a dark opaque beer with a thick light brown head that resembles cappuccino. The aroma is similar to many other Imp. Stouts with chocolate, espresso, and roasted malt characteristics. The taste is a wonderful blend of all of those flavors. Dark chocolate lingers on the tongue even after the beer has been swallowed. This beer contains a wonderful bitterness that hides the alcohol very well, great bitter chocolate dominates the mouthfeel. The Duck-Rabbit seasonals so far have never failed to impress. This has quickly become one of my favorite Imperial Stouts."
"Damn good. Nice to have such a great local Imperial Stout."
"Definitely something to look forward to."
"12 oz bottle. This brew pours a siniser deep deep brown color, only signifying that it is not black through a weak crimson highlite at the bottom of the glass. A half finger of dark tan head falls to a very spotty coat over top. Only a few stray bubbles are seen streaming upwards through the liquid. This is a good looking beer. The aroma is intense. I get huge notes of blackstrap molasses, with a touch of soy sauce, backed by a solid foundation of dark chocolate and a touch or roast. This one is still a little cold, so I will see what it does as it warms up. After letting it sit for a while, the chocolate notes sweeten up and come through a lot stronger, displacing the molasses as top dog. The first sip brings a big strong chocolate covered espresso bean combination of chocolate and coffee. The hop is a bit piney, but blends really well with deep roast and chocolate sweetness to really nail the coffee flavor in there. A touch of soy hits right after swallowing the beer, but then things move to a very smooth chocolate after taste, with a slight bitterness clinging on. This is really tasty beer. Mouthfeel on this one is where things are a little interesting. it is well to the thick end of moderate, but with a touch of slickness and a light to moderate carbonation that really makes this one feel a lot less robust than I feel it needs to be. I want this beer to be chewy. That said, I don't think it detracts from the overall experience more than a little. There is no clue in the aroma or flavor that this is a monsterous 10%, leaving it very clean and easy drinking. This one is just full of aroma and flavor. I think the flavors really blend well together and make one hell of a good beer. Awesome."
"World class."
"p.s. anyone cellaring this currently should drink within the next 12 months as i can't see this beer improving much more, and it will likely decline after that period."
"Very well-balanced. Extremely flavorful. A winner from a under-the-radar brewery. Well done!"
"Boy, this beer packs a punch. A very dark beer with a fair amount of head. The smell was of malt with a hint of the alcohol. The taste was very good for this style. It has a mildly sweet taste. The mouthfeel was smooth with a deffinate alcohol presence. I could drink these again. This beer sold fast so surely it will be brewed again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" dark brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades reasonably slowly, with average lacing, commensurate with the style. Aroma is hearty dark malts, with alcohol apparent. Taste is bitter coofee and sweet chocolate malts working together, ending with a warming swallow, in which the coffee bitter lasts. Mouthfeel is creamy, and drinkability is good for the style. Another nice dark brew from Duck-Rabbit, who'da thunk it?"
"Drinkability: An extremely enjoyable stout, a great sipper, smooth, rich, strong, and balanced."
"Body is big, creamy, and goes down like silk. Texture is thick and oily, very mouth coating. Just a hint of the 10%, quite a nice sipper. Wish I could find more of this, it disappeared off the shelves way too quickly."
"Mouthfeel is smooth as silk, moderately heavy. Full-bodied, pleasant and highly drinkable for the style. This one's a winner from an otherwise unnoticed brewery, it could stand with the best in the US. I could definitely session a few."
" Very drinkable for a 10% brew... unfortunately the thickness (which I love) makes it difficult to stomach more than a few of these over the course of a night. However, all in all, D-R's best offering in my opinion. Very nice work."
"Super drinkable, especially for a 10%ABV beer. A damn fine impy..."
"This is really a delicious Russian Imperial Stout. It pours out a beautiful black beer with a lush reddish brown head that stays firm to the glass and never disappears. The smell is roasted with lots of coffee like aroma. Very traditional to the style. The taste is great. A lot of brewers try to put too much hops in this great style, and this beer has the perfect amount of hops. Just enough to balance out and sweeten up the chocolaty roasts I taste, and yet it doesn't overshadow. A very floral and roasted taste. Mouthfeel is pretty typical of the style. Thick enough to notice and separate it from some other beers. An excellent beer to chew on for awhile if you can take it. No alcohol to discourage the palate, and only a slight warming of the esophagus."
"The aroma is intense. Very concentrated dark roasted chocolate, molasses and cocoa. Pours deep black from the 12 oz bottle and settle down to a thumb thick dark brown head that is mostly creamy with a few dispersed bubbles. Dark burnt chocolate in the fore. Quite rich and thick like dark chocolate brownies. Hints of quality espresso and a flavor that approaches marzipan..that isnt quite the flavor, but it something almond/nutty and sweet. Its flipping delicious whatever it is. Also get some fig/date notes and a strong coffee/esspresso finish. Damn nice brew. So glad NC popped the cap if this is the beer they are going to put out"
"Mouthfeel is oily but feels a bit thin, probably medium in body overall, like most russian impy stouts. Coats well and the flavor really hangs in there. Drinkability is good, the in your face flavor could become overwhelming. A very good brew and a awesome first shot by the ""dark beer specialists""."
"drinkability: quite drinkable but very rich"
"The long awaited high gravity brew from Farmville does not disappoint - The hops are evident upon opening and it pours a thick viscous almost jet black - The nose is of dark roasted coffee with nuances of bitter chocolate - This is definitely a beer drinkers beer - Look forward to trying it with a good brownie"
"10-08-07: Still good but certainly downhill. Harsh on the tongue, seems to have lost some malt and become more roasty and rough...with a souring aftertaste. A little muddy. Aroma has held up better, but is still a touch behind what it was."
"Purchased a bottle at Whole Foods for $1.75, think it rang up wrong to my benefit. Pours a midnight black color with am immpressive 3 fingure head that last throughout the drink, also tons of lacing. Immdiate sweet smell of chocolate and liquor. Sweet toasted malt chocolate tatste, with a slight alchohol finish, not as powerful finish as the 10% hinted. Good mouthfeel and balance. In my opion the best brew by Duck Rabbit. Keep up the good work over there in Farmville."
"Been looking forward to this one for a while now. Pours thick black with amocha colored head that quickly drops to a collar. Smells of molasses, maraschino cherry, with nice stab of deep roast. Tastes very nice. Flavors are very well melded. Starts off sweet with sweetened roast and molasses, moves into dark fruits, raisiny, cherry, then it immediately gets roastier and earthier, and a bit spicy as its dries. Lots of roast through the finish, with some definite grain bitterness as well as hops, yet still completely smooth. Mouthfeel is oily, chewy, moderate to low carbonation, viscous, but not overly so. I like it. Alcohol is present in some very pleasant alcohol spiciness but nowhere else. This is very drinkable, and one of my favorite imperials thus far as it fits a lot of the characteristics i enjoy in a RIS, particularly the drying finish. This also happens to flesh out wonderfully as it warms."
"Pours a dark, impenetrable black topped by a creamy two-finger tan head. Rich aroma of dark roasted malt, grassy hops, and light peaty smoke. Palate is dominated by a blend of rich chocolate and sweet caramel malts, balanced by a touch of grassy hops. Notes of peat, cracked black pepper, and dark fruit peek out on the finish. Body is nice and creamy, holding the flavor well. I have to say, Duck-Rabbit is fast becoming one of my favorite breweries anywhere, much less in North Carolina."
"Nice to try a new offering from DR,poured and opaque black with a tight mocha colored head,big roasted malt aromas and French roast coffee a touch of dark fruit and the alcohol seemed to creep in a little as it warmed.I found this to be quite earthy for and Impy stout quite good but Iam not sure if thats on for the style,anyways dark roasted coffee and raw earthiness mainly in the finish dominate here just a tad of dark fruit.Alcohol becomes more evident as it warmed all in all not bad,thanks to hoppedup for sharing last night."
"Glad to see this beer in NC! A sipping beer for sure. Worth trying. I'll set a couple of these in a corner of my basement and try them around Halloween, 2006."
"Pours jetblack like motor oil with a milk chocolate head that dissapates quickly. Heavy roasted malts, chocolate, and burnt coffee aromas, mmm. Very slight hop flavor to start, then a strong takeover of roasted malts, coffee and some nutty undertones. This leaves with a bitter dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is surprisingly oily and lighter than what it appears when pouring. As already noted, this beer gets much more complex and smoother as it warm's. This beer has definate ""velvet hammer"" potential, as the alcohol (10%) is surprisingly well hidden. An excellent beer and proud to say from NC. Go get you some."
"12 ounce bottle, part of a sixer purchased at Whole Foods - Raleigh. Best before 11 06."
