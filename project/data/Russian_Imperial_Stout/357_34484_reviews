"O - ABV to taste, this beer is killer. Really digging just the straight forward tastes I'm getting from it. A BA or coffee version has to be killer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black with a quickly dissipating head. Smells of dark chocolate and roast malts. Burnt malts, oatmeal, boozy edge, cocoa nibs, molasses. Heavy body, light carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel, chocolate and char aftertaste."

"O - This beer has some really good flavors and feel, but it is a little short of outstanding for me because of the amount of bitterness. I think the coffee profile is way short of Founders Breakfast Stout, so that surprised me. Almost comes across as hoppy like a Victory Storm King. Still very good though."
"Fabulous beer. Wish I could get it more often."

"Burnt, bitter, not sweet. This is good, but nothing you haven't had a million times before. Worth a try, but don't hunt down too hard."
""
""
"The flavor delivers that same classic stout but with a nice balanced assertiveness. This has nice coffee, embers, charred oats, chocolate malts, dryness and roast. The feel is not particularly viscous and lightly dry."

"16.9 oz. (500 mL) bottle from a Sat., 12/20/2014 Better Beer Authority Bottle Share (thanks, GMRFx), 2013 vintage (orange wax), poured into a White Labs snifter glass, drank over 15 minutes"

""

"Robust dark malt flavor but as sweet as many a milk stout.  Lingering flavor of dark roasted malts with little burnt quality."

"Overall - Something about it reminds me a bit of a milk stout. But still, the flavours are fantastic. It has a quality chocolate flavour that I also get from Speedway stout or even Hunapuh. Very easy to drink and great balance. Only fault is maybe the mouthfeel."
""
""
""

"Overall, a tasty and well done stout. I'd love to find the other variants someday."

"O - Easily the best non-flavored and non barrel-aged RIS I've ever had. So much going on here. Feels bigger than the 8.5% abv and so robust. Will seek this out again. The force is strong with this stout."

"This is a fine Stout to enjoy while reading on a wet autumn day. While it lacks the intensity I seek from this style, I imagine it would be enhanced by chocolate-covered coffee beans."

""

"M: smooth, thick, sticky coating finish"

"Beer is subjective and I don't boast that I know more than anyone else, but for my opinion, this is the best beer I've ever had. It's black as ink with a coffee head that will last long after the sun burns out. The smell is laced with coffee and dark chocolate notes. The taste is amazing with coffee and sweetness from the malt coming in at different times during the taste. It's complex, yet without being overbearing. The mouthfeel is pure velvet and coats your throat down to your stomach. This is the beer that I compare all other stouts to."
"Could use some refinement, but this is an Imperial beer, so who am I to argue the finer, more delicate points of taste?"
""
""
""
"Taste has a nice chocolate presence, like the sludge at the bottom of a cup of chocolate milk. Fair amount of blackberry fruitiness and still a formidable finish of old world hops. Mouthfeel is nice and viscous...smooth and low carbonation...silky even. Very nice brew here...always happy to get this one in a box!"
"Viscous and thick in the glass. More chocolate and dark malt goodness. What can be said? World class Imperial stout."

"This isn't a dessert stout; it really reminds me of FBS. It's a little understated by comparison. That's more to my liking; it may not be to yours."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not overly complex, but what's there is really nice. Flavor profile reminds me more of a milk stout than an RIS."

"Poured fairly thin with decent amount of head. Smell was coffee, dark chocolate, and malts notes mostly. Mouth-feel was very thin, I was expecting more viscous for a stout. Tasted chocolate and coffee notes with some dark fruits. Let down my expectations a bit, I think this one definitely needs the bourbon-barrel to add some character and depth. There are so many other great ones out there, but worth a try to have once. I look forward to the barrel-aged version down the line. This one is a B- overall."
""
""
""

"O-A great RIS, been wanting to try it for a while and it lived up to my expectations. A really good beer."

"An absolute pleasure to experience."
""
""
""
"O: Easily hit the top 10 beers I've had. Might be one of the best stouts I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. This one does not have a lot of hype but maybe it should."
""
""
""
"Overall: I wanted to love this one due to the badass bottle and overall hype, and it certainly is awesome, but the alcohol was a bit prevalent and I found it to be quite one dimensional."

"O: This beer is defined by its ability to balance many ingredients and extreme flavors. I'll be buying more of this."
""
""
""
"O: A rainbow of dark malt flavors, well executed and pleasantly balanced. Sometimes when you use too many grains the flavors end up muddied and muted like mixing to many paints it ends up dull and grey; that is so not the case here this beer is rich and flavorful."
""
""
"A big winner from NEBCO. They are doing great things. I'd love to try some of the variants of this one."
""
"This beer lacks the smoothness that I find in other imperial stouts, despite having a below average alcohol by volume. For me, the taste fell short and I am left underwhelmed."
""
""
""
""
""
"a really fantastic stout, no frills about this one, no coffee, cocoa nibs, nothing but an authentic imperial stout here. the pour is real dark, almost black, but tinted cherrywood red when held to intense light. an inch of white head is permanently fixed to the surface. sort of an understated smell, in a meticulously refined way. its dark and bitter of course, but its also got some subtle earthy notes, like damp tree bark, and a touch of black licorice. the flavor is super roasty, as dark as you can go before getting that bitter char taste. here is where some coffee essences can be observed, but its a parallel of roasting, not necessarily of a real coffee addition. there is a little sweetness towards the finish that brings to mind butterscotch oatmeal cookies, one of my most favorite desserts. full body, standard carbonation, cloudlike soft and moist texture that really makes it dangerously easy to drink. I also love that the abv isn't through the roof. it allows for more intake, and thus more reflection. overall this is an outstanding stout, a great illustration of the style, and a beer that I may never have gotten to try if it weren't for a great trade with thebrewo. cheers for this!"

"O- This is really nice. The orange peel and citrus really comes out as it warms up. Espresso, dark cocoa powder, brownies, with plenty of dark dried fruit and black coffee. It drinks fantastic now, but I can't wait to see what happens to this with some time on it."
""
""
""
"O: Solid stuff. It grew on me after some initial hesitance."
""
""
""
"the beer pours a rich looking black with a thin halo of tan head. the nose is distinct with a big hoppy/boozy nose and very little roast/caramel. the taste is slightly roasty, but predominantly earthy bitter chocolate. the mouthfeel is relatively full bodied and sweet, but certainly not cloying, slightly bitter and a touch of cardboard. this is a tasty stout with good balance and relatively tame sweetness. good beer that's worth trying, but doesn't overpower."
""
""
""
"O - Cool bottle but the beer is off as it has too much copper for a RIS"
""
""
"O: NEBCO continues to crush it this year. Well done boys."
""
""
""
"Overall: I have wanted to try this for a long time now. It did not dissapoint and i would say that this beer is better than what the average review says it is. Its a memorable stout for sure! Love the label too! NEBCO has a real winner here. No wonder it has been so difficult to get my hand on a bottle of this!"
""
""
"O - Wow I want some more right now. Really I do."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- In the mold of a true RIS with the influences of american double stout, a fantastic must try."
""
""
"Straight-up black pour, with a small bubbly head that receded to a thin, wispy layer, leaving a few dots of lace on the glass. Lots of roast in the aroma, dark malts and cocoa, herbal, and surprisingly some piney hops notes. More of the same in the taste, roasty dark malts and unsweetened cocoa, anise, a somewhat awkward pine hop presence, solventy grain alcohol. Fairly strong bitterness overall. Hmm. Body was medium and somewhat thinned out. This beer didn't really do much for me. It was pretty basic and uninteresting, like an average homebrew. Not bad, but not great."

"A very solid brew, but IST is another example of a brew not worth all the hype it receives, especially at ^$20/bottle. Recommended, but don't buy into the hype.."

"2012 bottled poured into a snifter yields a solid black body under a well maintained khaki colored head. Aroma is quite impressive and complex with notes of earthy and sweet notes of chocolate, coffee, nut, graham cracker and vanilla. A smooth and silky malty mouthfeel glides over the palate with resonating earthy hops, pungent cocoa, dark fruit, and perhaps tobacco flavors that harmonize nicely into a dry finish. I see a fully loaded beef cheeseburger pairing in this brew's future on my table..."
"Roasted malt and coffee bitterness up front. Swells with dark fruit, semi-sweet chocolate, and rum raisins. Peaty, with Sumatran funk and bitterness comes through, along with licorice and some molasses. More roasted bitterness in the finish with plenty of lingering sweet peaty malt and chocolate. Slightly warming, but very drinkable. Full bodied with a lush, velvety feel. Very nice, especially once it hits cellar temperature."

""
"Non-blind comments: This was vintage 2011"
""
""
"Pours jet black, like oil, with thick head of brown foam. Sits a top like a foam cap. Coffee rich roasted nose. Dark chocolate too. Powerful. Smooth creamy taste, with loads of dark chocolate, hint of coffee. The bitter is buried deep in the back. Mouthfeel is quite smooth. Soft, even. Top notch. Phenominal."
""
"Overall this is an good beer. The steep price tag of this one may keep me from trying it again. I can't see myself spending $20 for another bottle for this coming release. I know it's cheaper at other stores but I have buyers remorse for this one. Maybe if I see it on draft coming up I'll get a taste to see if it's worth it."
""
"O: I find this perfectly serviceable, but I'm not sure it would merit any more attention than Old Rasputin if it weren't for the label controversy."
""
"O: I honestly thought it was going to be a lot better from all the hype it has gotten over the years. It was just an OK RIS, nothing special."
""
"O: Very solid stout. Not my favorite, but it's quite good and subtlely unique."
""
""
"O: very good beer, but the carbonation kills it. Not sure if it was intentional or not. Overall still work seeking - maybe some age on this one would do it some good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium-full mouthfeel with a perfect amount of carbonation. The carbonation really makes the mouthfeel. Overall, a good stout, but not something I was super impressed with. When I try this next I'd like to try it fresher to see if some of the flavors come out more."
""
""
"o: One of my favorite imperial stouts. Enjoyed these during Episode 3, and the beers continued to get more epic as the story did the same."
"Vintage 2011. Thanks to Celtic001 for this bottle! Bottle poured into a tall chalice. Pours a deep foreboding black, with a thick, lustrous mocha head. The nose is a bounty of coffee, roasted embers, bakers chocolate. The big downfall to this one though is the feel. This is an over-carbonated mess. Harsh bubbles scald the palate. Way overdone. This is a much more roasted beer than anticipated. Smoke, charred wood, some mild cocoa-like flavors. Not a lot of sweetness to help balance this one out. Meh. This one was disappointing to say the least. Not worthy of the hype for me anyways. Glad I tried it though."
""
"Seriously, though... the only bad thing about this beer is that it it gone now :("
""
""
""
"O - Creamy smooth and solid. Lighter body but that doesn't hurt it here."
""
""
"IST is a good stout that's about on par with Founders Imperial Stout. Nothing crazy going on here: it's just a well-made RIS."
""
"O- very good RIS. Big chocolate, roast and coffee notes that you want in a RIS."
""
"O : I would drink again, gladly. It is a very solid offering, and while I would like to see some more nuances it does what it does well so cannot knock it for that. Wish it was easier to get around here."
"Dark brown in colour, brown with a finger or two of brown head. Good retention and some lace. Nose is quite hoppy initially, with a substantial dose of roast, a bit of acidity, espresso, alcohol and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is about the same, incredibly roasty, almost charred, coffee, black licorice. Hops are still present. Thick body, with a good bit of carbonation and drying. A really nice imperial stout, roastiness was really substantial."

"2012 vintage. Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is jet black with a low profile, dense, creamy chocolate milk colored head. Aromas are creamy, with a mocha blending leaning slightly on the bitter side. Flavors are supersmooth, with a healthy underlying kick from the ABV. Bitter and dark roasted coffee throughout, with some dark, bittersweet chocolate overtones and earthy, roasted highlights. There is a subtle sweetness that jumps in at the end of the palate...seems like a tangy caramel. The body remains smooth throughout, but is light enough to be drinkable. Another solid boozey bite in the aftertaste, as well as a roasty and bitter blend. The finish is smooth and bitter at the same time; creamy, yet sharp. Very dynamic, solidly brewed RIS. Delicious!"
""
"This is an excellent beer. For a beer this big that has so much flavor it's very straightforward. The chocolate and roasted notes are extremely well balanced. Just a really good beer."
""
""
"Poured from bottle into CBS Snifter. Pours a vicious pitch black color. Comes out of the bottle with the thickness of motor oil. As it falls into the glass, a dark tan head bubbles up like bubbles from a tar pit. Just thick looking. Some head retains, not much though. Absolutely no light gets through the glass. One of the thicker Imp stouts I've ever seen, kind of reminds me of the pour I got out of CCB Zhukov. Smell- Dark chocolate, some graininess, ovaltine, mocha coffee. Smells great. Taste- WHOA. Dark fruits, Aggressive bitterness, the thickness of this coats my mouth with a super rich thick bitter dark chocolate. This is delicious, super complex, well made RIS. So flavorful, so thick, just perfect. This beer is a home run. I'm just hoping my Astros give those pansies from Dallas a tough game tonight (not looking good at the moment) to match the greatness of this beer."
"O- I was happy when my buddy brought this up to me for my birthday last night. It was nice to check this one off the list. A nice stout. I would not buy this, but if someone offered me some I would certainly drink it again. There are better stouts out there, especially with the price/availability factored in."
"o- very tasty! i see why this guys gain so much popularity, its a up there with good ris. the 750 disappeared a lot easier than i thought it would. almost as good as founders ris. huge thanks to evan for the chance!"
""
""
""
"This is certainly better than some Russian Imperials of the style, but the most memorable thing about this beer is it's name (aka Stout Pooper). It's better than I remember from drinking this in the past, but it's not epic."
"Overall: I tried this in a massive stout rating and it was incredibly underwhelming. Now that I've tried it in isolation, I know that's the case. Everything that should be in this beer is, but it's been dialed down. Makes for an incredibly easy drinking take on the style, but ultimately falls short."
"An interesting take on the style."
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful silky black with a soft light mocha foam. I'm not usually impressed by a stout's look, but this one is pretty to me. Cocoa, leather, alcohol, licorice and hints of graham. Flavor is bready with a rye tone and some more graham and dark, dark chocolate. A bit of oxidation is evident, but not to the demise, rather a slight compliment to the beer. Body is very thin for the style, almost empty with a subdued (due decorum) carb and an off dry finish. Nice beer, but not worth seeking out again for me."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is a splendid RIS. Very chocolatey. Dark 85% cocoa type chocolate. Not too much else though, just lots of chocolate. This is a very, very hyped up beer and for me a bit too overhyped. Still though, I've got a few bottles of this stuff for a reason."
"O: Certainly wasn't what I was expecting from this beer. Rather one dimensional and just not that impressive."
""
"Overall: I actually really enjoyed this. The only place where I was dissapointed was in the smell."
"Overall - I find it hard to find redeeming qualities to this one. There's nothing offensive about it, but it's painfully average. Why do people like this so much?"
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip. Pours a slick black, with a three inch dark tan head, that leaves rings of lace. Smell is roasted coffee, smoke, leather, and tobacco. Taste is all of that with lots of smoke, leather, and licorice that lingers awhile. Not my favorite flavors from a Imperial stout. Body is medium, enough carbonation, a little dry, and drinkable enough. This a good stout, but not my favorite flavors. Wish it was chewier also."
"O-I did not know what to expect from this beer. I had read about it, got a hankering and then got it during a trade expansion(thanks alpinebryant). It turned awesome. Seriously a great imperial stout. Not to over the top and takes a lot of great elements and brings it to an easy drinking but dangerous RIS!"
""
""
""
""
""
"But, still a very enjoyable and excellent stout."
"Pours black with a fairly dark brown head. No doubt this is a quality RIS by the darkness of the head. Aroma of roasted malts, molasses and sweet coco. Big roasted malt flavor to start, coffee too. Settles into a sweeter blend of flavors. Syrupy chocolate, molasses, cream and fudge. Hints of earthy hops, licorice, and ever so tiny notes of alcohol on the finish. Tasty blend of flavors, has all of the roastyness, the sweetness and the more unique RIS flavors that you'd come to expect from a good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good RIS, good tasting, nice smelling, and a good mouthfeel. I will look for other New England Brewing Cos beers."
""
""
"O: Pretty standard RIS with good flavors and decent aromas. Nothing super fancy though."
""
"O: Really disappointed in this. Wanted to like it, just didn't."
""
""
""
"O: Well balanced RIS. Chocolate is probably the heaviest factor but it smooths everything out nicely. Surprisingly boozy and just a touch thin detracts slightly, I bet after a year or two I could see 4.5s for mouthfeel and overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better RIS's out there. Delicious!"
"overall the flavors weren't as big as i expected and hoped for, but its still a very nice stout and enjoyable. seems like one you could drink over and over again"
""
""
""
""
"O- a great ris, which I feel deffinatly gets better with aged, deffinatly glad I still have one of last years squirreled away."
""
""
""
"O: A- not as much as I was expecting but very tasty."
""
""
""
"Very good. Not mind blowing like I'd hoped.Â "
"Overall, I am kinda over big boy stouts like this one, and I thought I was going to hate this but I actually enjoyed my small pour decently. 4 oz is all I really needed as this beer is packed with massive roast, char and dark chocolate flavors. Not for the faint of heart and worth a go if you like extremely dark roasty stouts."
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body, creamy. Light carbonation."
"To be hounest, this is not one of the better stouts i had. Taste and smell are a bit above normal. This stout is a good beer to begin with when you are new on the stout front!"
"O: a pretty decent imperial stout. Nice and robust without being sweet at all. It lacks some complexity, but is still good."
""
"O - It is a good stout, but not excellent."
""
"2010 vintage. Gotta love those glasses, baby. This stuff pours a straight onyx topped by a finger or so of dark tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate powder, light brown sugar, and toasted caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, with the usual stout notes of roast and chocolate coming to the fore, taking charge without o'erwhelming everything else. The body is a light heavy, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth and lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice impy stout. That's all I can say. I think I was expecting something exceptional, though, and got something only really good. I hope that makes sense..."
"Overall, a rather unique stout. I'd have thought the hops would have become more muddled by this point, but they were still actively lending a good amount of flavor to the mix. Certainly enjoyed this one."
"Overall this is a great stout and I am certainly happy that I picked up a few of these to sit on for awhile. Love the balanced yet rich flavor, and who dosen't love the bottles they come in? Everyone should seek this out!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- a must have in your life time. Just a brilliant stout."
""
"O-Another very tasty beverage. Great blend of flavors for 9.2% ABV. 4.5"
""
""
""
"O: A beer worthy of its SciFi reference. Should of had the beer in the movie instead of Jar Jar!"
"Solid stout with no bells and whistles; just really good."
"Overall: I wish this was a year-round kind of beer that was available to me all the time. Really, great from cracking the cap to finish, the only thing that would slow me down on this one is the weight and higher ABV, but I'm not going to have a problem finishing the 750 all by my lonesome. Cheers to an amazing beer!"
""
"O- I really liked this fresh, but with age on it it seemed to tone down the carbonation levels and the amount of bitterness. It's said they changed the recipe (not sure in what ways) but I prefer this over the new/fresh 2011 batch."
""
""
"I've had IST only on a few other occasions, and those were the 2010 vintage. Â I don't remember being this impressed. Â This is a very solid stout. Â The flavors are just right and the mouthfeel is killer. Â Best non-barrel aged stout I've had in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Delicious brew, big sweetness and flavor cover up the alcohol in this very well, with very little if any booziness detected."
""
"This is a special-release stout (acquired through trade) that is blended of seven different malts and Northern Brewer hops. Pours black with a two-finger tan head that dissipates quick. Faint aromatics of coffee and cocoa nibs and probably were all I could detect. Taste was flattish and made me wonder if this is better fresh? I could pick up light notes of coffee, toffee, and maybe roasted chocolate. Full bodied with decent carbonation. Highly disappointed brew. The label was probably the best thing going for this beer."
"Although there was slight disagreement among we all concluded it was unique and best as a desert beer."

"Just not good... Very sad about this beer."
"Overall: I enjoyed the aroma and taste but felt the mouthfeel was a little thin. I don't think I would go through the trouble of hunting down a bottle."
"The temperature started warm and only became warmer from there; some of the rougher edges started to become tamed. Overall, this one is pretty good. I wonder if it would have been better if opened sooner."
"O: Overall, I would say they over did it on the roast barley, carafa III, and black patent. It just was undrinkable. I had to pour out my glass, this was like kissing a chain smoker! I dont know what they were thinking while tasting this, but who knows maybe there was too much of roasted barley added in the mash. I am usually generous with my ratings but with this one I couldnt do it. Maybe this was just a bad batch because I know I am in the dissenter position."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It has a rich, creamy smooth feel and a hidden alcohol inclusion that only shows itself as it warms. Very roasty and super enjoyable. I don't know how much the recipe for this brew changes from year to year but I can firmly state that I fully enjoyed this with ~2 years of age on it. This past years seemed much more fruited with alcohol and hops. I really enjoyed this darker, more roasted edition of the trooper. Well done."
"overall impression: had this the first time on draft at Stoutfest in Worchester. this bottle was excellent as well. something I would certainly seek out again."
"Finally popped open one of my 2006 bottles of this coveted brew and was not disappointed. The color was a deep black mahogany with just a hint of translucence at the edges. Thick and dark, it produces a modest head that holds in a milk chocolate colored ring while the lacing is only fair. The aroma is sweet licorice and malt with a vague ham hint that is intoxicating. Definitely with an accent on sweet. The flavor incorporates these same elements with a definitive addition of chocolate coffee and sharp lemon on the front/middle of your tongue. Delicious. This is a heavy bodied brew but is exceptionally smooth and a bit satiny. The flavor invites considerable swilling but the constitution of this vintage brew keeps it as a flavor treat only. Booziness is really not significant in my assessment. I've had the 2008 before and this older sample was no disappointment. Once again, this proves to be one of the better imperial stouts around."
"Overall impression: Good imperial stout, slightly lacking in the ""oomph"" department."
"Pours black and thick. Head was very rich and creamy, light brown, left nice lace after dissipating to a nice bubbly, creamy film. Aroma has bits of roasted malts, cocoa and chocolate, a hint of coffee and marshmallow. Big chocolaty taste, which is a personal favorite. Nice roasted notes and a hint of char. Sweetness is pronounce, but balanced with bittersweet notes. No real alcohol taste or aroma, lending a nice drinkability. Body is full, creamy and coating. It's not chewy, but it's nice."
"O - Very good representation of the style. Nothing that's going to knock your socks off but something you will thoroughly enjoy from start to finish."
"O: This could have used a touch more time to calm down on the bitterness, for my tastes anyway. Then again, this could have been a much more forgettable beer after letting it fade more. Very good stout nonetheless. This got me ramped up for stout season."
"Overall - I would definitely have again. What an amazing Connecticut brewed beer. Can't wait for the colder months to arrive so I can fully enjoy this!"
"O-Very good beer. Well made and extremely drinkable. Only issue is the fact that its not that innovative. But would love to have it again."
"O - Can't say I was impressed by the 2010 vintage with a few months on it. This fresh bottle is fantastic though! Roasty and sweet, it really is hard to describe this beer but its uniquely NEBCO. Really glad the bottle size and price went down as the gouging got pretty insane last year. 4.0/5"
"D/O - Drinkability is high. Honestly this beer is much different than I would've expected, but in a very good way. I think the balance (or perhaps the lack thereof) of hops in this beer is a welcome change, which I don't want to be misconstrued as me advocating that the way to make a beer good is by throwing hops at it. It's just that it's nice to see a fresh aspect every now and then, especially when given to styles which are quite popular."
"Very good. I will look forward to this every year."
"A gorgeous-looking, great-smelling, fine-tasting beer that's a little tough to drink a lot of. And though I didn't let financial considerations factor into my actual ratings, it is worth noting that for the price of this bottle I could have purchased two bottles of Stone IRS. That does sting just a little bit."
"Overall, this is an amazing Imperial Stout, bountiful with enough darkness to suck black holes into its event horizon. This is the stout you're looking for."
"While the complexity wasnâ€™t quite there to get this up with some of the top Imperial Stouts out there, I still rather enjoyed this. It made great use of its ABV, with warm spicy flavors and a beefy attitude that kept me interested. I wouldnâ€™t bank the farm to acquire a bottle or anything but I sure wouldnâ€™t turn one down either. This is good one."
"O - I really didn't care for this beer that much. Average at best, and something I'd never try to get again."
"O- A nice treat that could have scored better had it been as complex as some other RIS's I've had. Some more time in the cellar could have served this beer nicely."
"A bit thinner than I would prefer, and the tannic harshness does make it a bit of a chore to drink for enjoyment. I would like to try this in a few years once it has time to mellow out a little, because it is just too rough around the edges at this point."
"Pouring a thick, inky black with a thick, dark brown head that recedes slowly leaving nice lacing, this is a good looking stout. The nose is fantastic. Rich, dark chocolate, creamy and bitter with a mellow coffee, a pleasing roasty bitterness and a mild yeasty spice reminiscent of anise, this beer has aged gracefully. There's even a hint of fruity tartness, not unlike a mild cherry character, that works wonderfully. These flavors are replicated on the palate, opening with the blend of dark chocolate, mildly sweet, some coffee and roast. Again, there's some fruit character here, a blend of the oxidative dark fruit character that's moderate, and just that hint of tartness. The spice appears mid-palate, working well with the chocolate, and lingers on into the finish. Medium-full in body, this beer is mildly carbonated, yielding a smooth, creamy mouthfeel with some wonderful flavors on the finish. A graceful beer, the only complaint I have with it is the price - $10 for a 12oz beer is a bit much, but oh well, I would gladly drink it again."
"D - very tasty and enjoyable, wish I knew what it tasted like fresh to compare"
" The flavor is so malty yet layered with lots of different elements, sure there is the malt flavor which is pretty nice and caramel saturated, but the yeast gives a nice gentle fruitiness underneath the sweet elements and mild roasted tinges. The flavor has a good toasted grain tinge and accents of hops and alcohol buoy the overall Imperial quality of the stout, I will say again this is so well crafted it gives the impression of a mid strength not a high gravity stout. The smooth cocoa element is what stands out to me with some woody elements and gentle alcohol in the finish w/ some pine notes from the hops. The beer finishes semi-dry. I think Imperial Stout Trooper deserves all the praise it gets it is such a splendid Imperial Stout it is a great example of the style. New England Crafted a great brew, thanks Stakem for sharing this delicious beer!"
"(22oz bottle via trade). Pours black with 2 finger chocolate head. Aroma has roasted malts, dark chocolate, wood. Taste is bitter with flavors following aromas. Full bodied with sticky texture. Bitter finish. Could be a little sweeter for my tastes. Quite bitter."
"O: Good, but not amazing. I was hoping for a bit more, but I liked it nonetheless. Look forward to trying it again in a few months to see if anything changes."
"A decent, well balanced, but rather one-note (and somewhat weak flavored) stout - we'll see if age helps my earlier batch."
"the CPJ"
"Overall a decent stout. The smell was its best attribute."
"Honestly, I'm really disappointed in this one. I think much of the allure to this beer is the branding and the fact that it's out of reach for most of the country. If this were sitting on shelves all over, it wouldn't get as much praise. Unfortunately, it just doesn't stand up with the other RIS on the market -- there are far better."
"Overall this is a great stout but I think it gets more attention then needed. Don't get me wrong its good but I was expecting more. One of the great thins is that it is light in the mouthfeel and has a slightly subdued leaving this quite drinkable and refreshing."
"Drinkability â€“ Big. Intense. Bold. One for sipping, one for celebrating, and one for true enjoyment. Such a fantastic beer. Itâ€™s on the expensive side and is difficult to find, but is worth the effort."
"O- Solid Stout, was let down with the overall taste of the beer. Very mellow and subtle tastes that came out, alcohol was very hidden, easy drinkability, solid but not great."
"Pours an opaque deep black with a quarter inch of dark creamy tan head with good retention of lacing. Aroma is of coffee, roasted nuts, barley, some vanilla, and slightly earthy. Mouthfeel is rich, creamy. Taste is of coffee, oats, roasted nuts, vanilla, some chocolate, and slight booziness. Overall, a very tasty rich stout."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch dark khaki head that fades to a spotty cap of bubbles. Thin rings of foamy rings coat the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, and some citrus zest hops. Taste is roasted malts, dark chocolate, and some citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a slight alcohol taste as well. Medium bitterness on the palate after each sip. Lower carbonation level makes for a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good stout and my first from NEBCO. I would get this one again if I had the chance. Very nice roast and chocolate flavors with this beer."
"Although a little bit overly dry and roasty for what I prefer- this is a nice beer. Definitely an imperial in every aspect of the word- especially the part where the troopers take over your palate and blast shit up until the salivary jedi can neutralize the balance of the force (flavor) and allow you to venture into the darkside again."
"O: Pretty good overall. Not a top of the line RIS, but certainly not bad. I was expecting a bunch of alcohol in the taste, but it wasn't there. Continued to be good as it warmed."
"I had this last weekend with BigDub, got it at an in-person trade at Dark Lord day, partly because I wanted the bottle as I'm a little bit of a Star Wars geek, but certainly hoped it was worth the Dark Lord I traded for it. I think overall it was good, but not had too much chocolate/coffee flavors in it for my liking. The color was deep black and it was pretty thick. I prefer my Russian Imperials with a bit more hop bite. Overall this is a solid imperial stout, but in my opinion a little overpriced/hyped for what you get."
"O: Nice, worth the try. I believe there is a little over hype on this but would give it a solid performance."
"O: a little over hyped in my opinion. a good beer, but nothing amazing."
"O: A very well done and nice stout, though the prices I have heard on it seem a bit steep for this. The alcohol is not noticeable at all."
"Not a bad beer by ANY stretch, but it was hyped up so much that i think it was a bit of a let down. Wouldnt turn it down though..."
"D: This is a slow drinker for sure but I'd say the drinkability is pretty high for such a big stout. If this were more easily available, I could see myself polishing off a few bottles of this with no problem."
"I could get very used to this beer and will definitely be seeking out more. This is probably the best chocolate beer I've ever had - even though I don't believe it is billed as such."
"Iâ€™m impressed, but Iâ€™m not wowed. Imperial Stout Trooper has a smooth, well integrated flavor and is drinkable, though not as incredible as some would say."
"A high ABV hits drinkability, but this is a very good beer."
"O- A RIS worthy enough for Darth Vader himself, not Yoda status though. A bit steep at $20 a bottle, but a good purchase. Worth a try and would possibly buy again. A very solid RIS, but there are similar for less."
"4.0 D: A solid, no frills imperial stout. A bit roastier that what I prefer (or rather not sweet enough), but definitely a well brewed beer."
"overall this is a stellar beer. falls short of world class (and perhaps of the hype as well), but very well made. would love to get my hands on a BA edition."
"Pours black with a good sized cocoa head. Looks good. Smell is light chocolate and roasted malts, maybe molasses. The taste is just monster hops. Way over the top with the hops, totally washing out the chocolate, coffee and roasted flavors. I've had less hoppy black IPAs. The balance of the hops and the base beer is not as finely crafted as say Darkness. The mouthfeel is nice, carbonated and not overly sweet like some RIS's. Basically, I didn't like this beer. They either covered over a bland base beer with mega hops, or they totally ruined a good base beer by over hopping it. Either way, I found it to be frustrating. A big saving grace is the complete lack of alcohol in the flavor."
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color stout with a nice thick brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt with light coffee notes and light black chocolate. Taste is an underwhelming taste of light roasted notes with light black chocolate and light dry coffee. Body is quite full though average for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Good but I guess I might have caught in hype and was expecting a lot more complexity from this one."
"I have heard a lot about this beer here on BA and never really thought to seek it out, but I'm very happy to have been able to try this. It's a great beer, a little off balance with the sweetness to bitterness levels, but with a beer like this, it's not a bad thing and works well to its advantage."
"O: This is a really enjoyable RIS with a great mouthfeel, but I feel it falls short compared to the cream of the crop. I had this a couple days ago practically side by side with Founders Imperial Stout and with a BORIS just a few days before that. It just doesn't match the complexity and depth of those other brews. I've heard a ton of hype around this beer, it just doesn't stack up. A delicious beer, but a not world class IMHO."
"Everything I was hoping for."
"O - such a good beer and so glad i ran over to redbones to grab this bad boy."
"o - Overall this is good. I had a bit higher expectations for this one, but solid. Mostly malty and roasty...touch of smokiness to it, kind of a one trick pony."
"(D)- A great stout. Smooth and sweet with a nicely integrated bitter roasted profile. Not overly strong or boozy; a great fit for the style and an enjoyable one at that."
"Overall this was a really good RIS, but not a great RIS. I may be a little tough on this category ever since I have had the enjoyment of Stone IRS and Deschutes Abyss. Maybe I'm wrong but the bar stands. Thanks to masterhomebrewer for the chance to drink this."
"O - Great beer. smell and appearance were top notch, flavor backed it up for the most part, not a ton of hops."
"Overall a really nice beer. The roast is just enough to not overtake the malt sweetness. Some nice complex malt flavors and a dry finish. All good things here, a great way to celebrate the end of our Stone in MN release party."
"Thanks to steve8robin for this in the BA secret santa '10. The bottle was an '09. I poured into a snifter. The pour is jet black with a moderate tan head, light lacing. The aroma is heavy on coffee, there is light chocolate, light alcohol. The flavor is terrific. Lots of chocolate balanced with the sweetness of chocolate. The finish has lingering coffee with a light alcohol finish. The body is full, carbonation good. A fantastic RIS. Definitely seek this one out."
"A great imperial stout. Not the best I ever had but a very good example of the style. Glad I have another bottle to age."
"holds up with the best of them"
"Drink- I liked it. Flavorful, roasty and nice coffee/espresso notes. The hops like I said gave it a change of pace as well."
"Overall a definate step up from some more mass produced imperial stouts such as storm king, ten fidy, and old rasputin"
"D- This was really good. I thought I remembered the fresh bottle being much more hoppy, thing is I think I liked this much better."
"D - Quite delicious brew with a ok ABV. Might be highly drinkable because its not too sweet or sticky."
"D: This is a very easy drink with a nice balance of slight sweetness and bold roasted malts. The alcohol is noticeable, but not enough to take away from the flavors. I'd like to see what some age does to this beer, although it's pretty smooth, I feel aging will do it well."
"D: OK. I'm a little underwhelmed with this one."
"Of course, your mileage may vary."
"The carbonation is just slightly more prickly than creamy, but it is a refined carbonation. Some warming, but not in a bad way at all. Drinks just fine, a nice example of the style. Worth the try."
"D - Pretty good. I liked this one for what it is but it left me wanting something more. I feel like I have had this beer multiple times before, yet this is the first time I have had it."
"Poured at cellar temp into a snifter with a mocha colored head that was fairly typical of a RIS. Body was as pitch black as Vader's mask, no hints of light made it through even the edges of this beer. The smell was chocolatey and sweet with a bit of rich and roasted coffee. A fair amount of floral hops in the nose accompanied by faint spicy molasses notes. The taste is just incredible as I was led to believe. Begins with semi-sweet chocolate and molasses flavors, hints of vanilla come through in the flavor profile. Fades to a roasted french vanilla coffee flavor with a nutty (hazelnut?) flavor lingering on my taste buds. Heavy is the word I would choose to describe the feel of this beer. Coating and viscous with a rich and silky feel to it and little carbonation. Drinks incredibly easy and I wish this were around more often, as I would by this by the case every chance I got."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head above the totally opaque dark brown/black brew. Head recedes ever so slowly, with plenty of lasting dark lace. Aroma is rich bittersweet chocolate, with an alcoholic undercurrent. Taste follows the nose, but finds some hop bitterness coming on throughout, and the mixture of flavors lingers in the mouth. Not much alcohol in the flavor, seems to be hidden well here. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, easy over the tongue, and drinkability is stunningly beautiful for the style. Wow."
"D. Ok, but not something I'd seek out."
"D-very drinkable. Amazing how drinkable these stouts are"
"Pours dark brown wih a decent amount of brown head. Te head sticks around for quite a while. Smells roasted and chocolatey. Tastes dry and not very sweet. A bit of chocolate And some nice bitterness but it's so dry. Mouthfeel suffers because of this. Fairly drinkable but overall not really that good. No better than stone IRS or old Rasputin for sure which are much easier to acquire."
"D - I don't know how I feel about this one. I feel similar to how I felt about Darkness - really solid beer, but I was hoping for just a bit more out of this one. The loads of dark chocolates made this a really good beer but it was a little one dimensional. Very much worth the effort of tracking down."
"D - Very drinkable. The 9.2% abv really doesn't show and the beer stays really pleasant. The flavor is really nice and very well balanced, and the aroma is very inviting."
"Overall a very likable and drinkable beer, though I don't exactly get all the hype. I still want to peg this as a heavily malted Black IPA rather than a RIS. Cool label (and story behind it) though."
"D: It's a seriously decent beer, but I've had other russian imperial stouts that are better. I'm in agreement with some of the other posters that this beer falls a little short of the hype. It's delicious, and I'd love to have a second bottle around to cellar for awhile, but my expectations were of ""world-class"" proportions. Regardless of hype, I still really enjoyed this beer."
"I enjoyed this brew at a Rare Stout night tasting, thanks to CampusCrew and the other generous BAs. This is a fine made imperial stout for sure, but not one of the standouts as we expected during our 20+ bottle tasting. This seems a bit overly hyped, I have wanted to try it for a long while, and it did not live up to the hype - taste wise - but the label rocks! A fine stout indeed, just not a standout as expected. I think a label can create a lot of attention indeed."
"drinkability: we had a rare sout party is this was one of the selectons. This was probably one of the weakest of the night. We had some good ones!"
"From the 750 ml. bottle with white stretchy-plastic wrapping around the bottle cap. Sampled on February 13, 2011. It pours very dark brown until it gathers in the glass where it seems to become oily black with a nice one inch head. The aromas boast roasted malts and coffee. The body is silky smooth on the tongue and comes in at around medium weight. The taste begins with a sweet maltiness along with some kind of dark cherry intermingling in a distant but noticeable way. It ends vaguely dry. An excellent beer for sure and true to the style."
"D - I liked it but one glass was enough"
"This is a tasty and very good imperial stout, but I'm surprised at the 4.3 average across so many reviews. That type of rating implies greatness, and while this is very good I don't think it comes terribly close to being great at all. It's different, not boozy and not sweet, and those darker, more bitter and smoky flavors are a nice change of pace. They also wear on the palate though, and this is not super drinkable, even by imperial stout standards. A good beer, but it doesn't quite sing to me."
"As I said before, this beer only got better with each gulp. I would drink it more often, but since its not available in Texas that won't be a possibility!"
"It's as drinkable as any other Russian Imperial Stout. Although it my be a little heavy duty to drink all night long, I sure wouldn't mind trying."
"Aside from the awesome name and bottle art, I wasn't too impressed by this one especially given all the hype. I have another bottle and am gonna age it to see if some time makes this one a little better"
"An alright beer overall but nothing close to great. Two of the three of us drank very slowly as if dreading the next drop. Perhaps the Dark Side of the Force is still strong in this one; Forcefully keeping us at bay so that others may drink this beer instead..."
"This one definitley lived up to its name."
"a good example of the style a little thin mouthfell, but a good beer over all"
"Very impressive beer. Flavors are well balanced, mouthfeel is on point and highly enjoyable to drink. The 750ml is going down far too easy. Definitely one to seek out, I doubt you will be disappointed."
"This brew poured a very oil black color in the glass with no light puring threw. Was a great start off, though the head came up a bit thin with a slight chocolate hue to it. The aroma was a sweet roasty smell that came threw with minimal power. The taste was a slightly roasted profile with a strong sweetness to it in the background. For my tastes this brew was not very balanced and even powerfull flavors were not up to par. I enjoyed this brew and would have it again, though would not seek it out. Would love to see what this brew could do with a year or two on it."
"Massive thanks to Lunch for sharing this one at Sexual Chocolate '11 during our private tasting session! Served from bottle into a sampler snifter. Poured pitch black with a minimal light tan head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, roasted malt, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. I had the pleasure of having this one back-to-back with the BA version and definitely enjoyed this one MUCH more than the BA version. Very good and balanced flavor going on in this one. Nice aroma to match as well. A definite must try!"
"Pours a deep black brown color with a thin tan head and a ton of lacing. Smells of figs and dates and chocolate and a little coffee. Tastes of figs, dates, and raisins, chocolate, and a little touch of coffee. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is not too bad."
"M: Thick"
"Dark, rich and awesome. I don't like too much dark fruit in my RISs and there is none to be found here. Huzzah! Bittersweet chocolate chips blends well with the roast malt for a big, roasty RIS. Licorice. Northern Brewer hopping comes through as satisfying hoppy burps. Mouthfeel is creamy but I'd like it thicker."
"D: This is a slow drinker for sure but I'd say the drinkability is pretty high for such a big stout. If this were more easily available, I could see myself polishing off a few bottles of this with no problem."
"drinks great. plenty of flavor, just enough booze warmth to let you know its there without being detrimental. a bit pricey, but one I'll buy every year if I can find it."
"D: Nice drinker, I really like the interesting hop profile on this stout."
"d - A very nice, easy to drink RIS. It was a hoppier stout than I was expecting, especially in the nose, as some pine comes through, but I still really liked it. Glad I have a bottle of this; going to hold onto it for a bit and see how it ages."
"Drinkability:A nice and dry RIS that is very enjoyable to drink, but perhaps not as good as the hype. I could definitely have a couple of glasses, but will not go out of my way for this one. A very good beer none the less."
"overall, good. i was not blown away but i enjoyed it. granted, it is like 2 years old now. i like that this is a 12oz bottle. very perfect. not so hyped on the 750ml."
"Chewy full body with luscious, silky chocolate malt flavor along with hints of toffee, lactic cream, hazelnut, oatmeal and slightly smokey, roasted coffee bean. The creamy flavor makes this beer incredibly smooth and in combination with the viscous chocolate notes, results n an incredibly quaffable, delicious, well crafted beer. ABV very well masked with faint warmth toward the finish."
"Drinkability: This is a tasty and highly drinkable stout. I'm glad that I finally had a chance to try it, but I have to admit this beer has left me underwhelmed. The beer is smooth and drinks easy, and there's no hint of the ABV. Unfortunately, there's really no hint of any big flavors either. It's good, and I will probably seek out more in the future, but if I miss out on it I won't be all that upset."
"Best part is that it is a strong showing from a local brewery, worthy of comparison with other big stouts out there."
"Pour produces a pitch black colored body with a large, ""milk shake"" frothyness of brown head. Aroma just bursts notes of roasted barley, sweet chocolate, and a noticeable earthy hop. Grains smell fresh and this fresh roast aspect makes for an attractive overall aroma makeup. Upon first sip, immediately noticeable is the mouthfeel. The body is so thick and creamy, it can be felt on the lips and on the palate. Flavor at center is very roasty, coffee notes given off from the roasted barley. There are some woody aspects in the center, but the finish rounds out with a hell of a lot of sweetness. Earthy hop counterbalance cuts through the thick malt sugars at the finish, leaving some grainyness that mixes well with the roasted malts. Finish leaves an impressive flavor of enhanced chocolate flavor while the thick stout disapates from the palate. Overall, this beer is a knockout, and ABV is well hidden making the beer quite drinkable (though very filling!)."
"Very happy to have this available as a local brew. This beer is an incredibly opaque black with a slowly developing brown head. Smell is actually a little sweet along with the burnt aspect. Taste is incredible. Sweeter than you might expect (almost milk stout-ish), with elements of coffee, chocolate, and just the right amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and clingy in a totally great way. Very drinkable for such a big beer; a pleasure to enjoy this one tonight!"
"I have begun to try some of the big-time stouts available in my area and this one sits right near the top with me. Very delicious, right down my alley in terms of the style."
"While NEBCO's Imperial Stout Trooper is definitely one of the better RISs around, I don't think I'd pay $16~ for it that often. If big stouts are your favorite kind of beer though, it's at the very least a must try."
"Considering the weight and abv, this guy is definitely a sipper and I enjoyed every sip. This is a well made RIS and I can surely see why it earns top tier consideration."
"D: Very drinkable, I'll certainly be keeping an eye out in the store for this one. Might even knock on the breweries door asking for this in growler form."
"SkÃ…L!"
"Awesome bottle/artwork! Pours an inky black with a tremendous, creamy, light brown head that goes nowhere. Great lacing. Smells of rip dark fruits, roasty, char, raisins, molasses. Taste follows with sweet rip dark fruits at first which then completely turns to a heavy roastiness and charred flavors. Fantastic. Mouthfeel is creamy, not really heavy, and finishes dry and roasty. Very drinkable."
"The drinkability is very high. I split the growler between myself and family on Christmas. Each one that tried it, loved it. From a fellow craft beer enthusiast(brother), to a regular drinker/borderline alchoholic(father), and someone that hardly ever drinks beer(Bro's GF).. it was a hit."
"poured into spiegelau tulip. the beer is a deep black color with light brown head. head has strong staying power and nice lacing. smells is of sweet chocolate and a light hint of coffee. slight aroma of hops when i take deep whiffs. the taste is more of the chocolate from the aroma and slight hint of bitterness. mouthfeel is medium-bodied. definitely a nice, drinkable RIS. it's not as big as some and as a result, goes down a lot easier. a very solid offering from NEBCO. My only quibble would be with the cost, but it's a small brewery from close to home so I'm not going to complain too much. I have two more bottles so I'll be interested to see how this changes over time."
"750mL bottle. Pours a brackish dark brown color with a small, brown frothy head. Nice amount of sticky lacing. Aromas of dark, bitter chocolate, roasted malts and some coffee/cappuccino. Taste is a nice big hit of dark, bittersweet chocolate upfront. Surprising amount of hop flavor to it. A bit of a mocha finish to it. Overall, this beer has a lot of flavor and a nice amount of hops as well. A bit pricey but the perfect Russian Imperial to drink during the winter."
"D- High. Great stuff. I will be popping bottles of this fresh, the hop/coffee/chocolate bitterness is really the bee's knees. Well done, NEBCO."
"Had several samples at the brewery and then the growler the same night. This beer is stupendous. I was only able to split a bottle last year (while I was sick) and had a hazy memory of the beer. This years batch blew me away. Right up there with the Abyss in my mind. One of my top favorite beers ever."
"I got my bottles filled at the brewery in front of my eyes. The NEBCO guys and gals are some of the nicest and most grounded in the business. Big respect."
"Comments: Sometimes simple is better. This tastes like a Russian Imperial Stout should taste. At a time when other breweries are trying to do so many different things to stand out, I say Amen to NEBCO for keeping the RIS real and not trying to do too much with it. There is no need to reinvent the wheel when it tastes this good. Major kudos on the new label art."
"Nice to get the holidays going with a good local beer. Happy to have had a growler rather than a bottle which will be snatched up shortly next week!"
"""Drink it. It's good."" - NEBCo"
"D- This beer wasn't over the top but well made which made it a easy drinker. The ABV is well hidden making this almost dangerous. I am enjoying everything that New England is putting out and this is no exception. I would suggest this beer as it is a easy drinker without being over the top."
"Taste is exceptional. A lot of flavor, but not too much to be overpowering. A touch of bitterness, but it is well ballanced. Though the alcohol is not overpoweing, there is some deffinite heat on the way down."
"Drinkability: Mellow, roasty, and very smooth. Nothing to write home about, but enjoyable."
"Drinkability: With the domination of the more subtle flavors by the roasty char and hoppy bitterness, this beer lacks some of the balance I seek in a hoppier style stout"
"Yum."
"Thanks to classy mpetersen for setting me up with this treat in an early trade of mine. Can't hang on to it anymore, I'm excited for this one. And after a string of disappointing stouts recently, I'm banking on this to be decent. Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a tulip. First of all this beer start with a strong foot forward for a simply very cool bottle design. Bonus Points. The actual beer looks nice too! It pours black with about an inch of creamy looking mocha colored head. Nice retention and thin lacing. I'm impressed. Ah! A big roasty RIS, I've been dying for one. This has a big aroma of roasted malts that have a bit of a smokey aroma, followed by dark fruits, cocoa and what I can only place as leather. I can faintly smell alcohol, but I think I'm a drug dog when it comes to smelling it and it's not overpowering anything. This really smells great, I'm impressed once again. The taste is mirroring the smell mostly. Big dark roasted malts, a bit of cocoa and bitter coffee finishing with a slight syrupy sweetness and dark fruits. It ends with a slightly smokey and earthiness as well. The mouthfeel is silky and thick with subtle carbonation kicking in to nicely liven up the brew. One of the more drinkable and enjoyable Russian Imperial Stouts in my opinion. I'll certainly seek this out again."
"Bottle. Images of Darth Vader comes to mind when I grab this bottle. Pours a dark brown/black color with a 1/2 finger tan head. Lots of aromas going on in the nose including coffee, vanilla, and sweet malts. Medium mouthfeel. Very well balanced flavor. Sweet dark chocolate, vanilla, some dark roast coffee with some bitter aftertaste. I know there was a lot of hype around this beer due to the Storm Trooper label not being used but this really is a good beer. May the force be with you."
"Overall, big thanks to portia99 for hooking this baby up!. I would put this stout on the order of Stone RIS for those who can't get it. I'd love to see more of this and lay one down, however at 8.5% I'm not sure how much this guy would improve."
"Bomber shared by photomike. Pours black with some mahogany corners to it. Nice creamy tan head. Aroma is a little faint, meandering chocolate and coffee notes, somewhat burnt. Chocolate mousse flavor with strong coffee notes, some syrup, and medium roast. Solid, unflawed taste profile here, good but unspectacular. The palate shines here -- rich but not too inky; dry but hefty."
"OVERALL: A high quality, medium strength imperial stout. It's not quite as big as others in the style obviously, but it's certainly tasty and is definitely a beauty pageant contestant. The finish, however, was unfortunately a little too astringent. Fix that up a little and you'd have a fantastic mouth-feel as well. Despite the slight flaw, this was an easy imperial stout to drink down and I would love the chance to have it again. Thanks again for the trade NYC!"
"Overall, pretty nice imp stout. I like this better than the BA version. The mouthfeel was a lot better."
"D: The bottle is probably the best part of this beer, but it's still a nice, easy drinking RIS. The alcohol is barely detectable."
"Well balanced beer, worth seeking out."
"This is a great drinking stout. It has a reputation and lives up to it! Highly recommended if you can get it!"
"D: NEBC puts out alot of great beers, and this one is no different. Big malt character that you expect from an RIS, but the aroma was a little too light. Either way, an outstanding brew. It's too bad we won't be able to get the awesome Star Wars graphics anymore. It's easily the coolest looking beer bottle I've seen. Hats off to NEBC."
"Yummy!"
"edit: came back and adjusted the taste score upwards, big rich chocolate flavors came out as this beer approached room temperature"
"D: Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this one. I enjoyed the roastiness of it, but there wasn't really anything else going on."
"The brew drank real well and was a wonderful finish to a night of superb sampling Thanks again Craig and Sarah"
"D- Pretty drinkable for an RIS, but not one of the bigger ones at only 8.5%, but the booze isn't too bad in the finish."
"In the end it lived up to the hype. I enjoyed it for what it was. Not to mention it might have one of the best labels I have ever seen on a beer."
"Overall this was my favorite of the tasting. I really like it more than Kate, Darkness or KBS."
"Jet black in color with a minimal, cocoa tinged head. Quite hoppy aroma with a blend of chocolate and roasted grains. Very solid flavor-quite a lot of hops in there but not overly done like I find Storm King, among others. Nice cocoa notes. Somewhat of a mellow licorice taste. Good mouthfeel-hesitate to call it thin but it is ""lighter"" then most RIS. Dangerously drinkable-maybe the lower abv has something to do with it. A damn good RIS overall. Could almsot call it ""sessionable"" as far as RIS go."
"D: Very easy to drink. This is an enjoyable imperial stout that I would be happy to have again."
"Pours a deep, dark black color, capped off with a good-sized medium tan head. Aromas of roasted malt, coffee, milk chocolate and burnt brown sugar. Tastes rather thin, somewhat unimpressive, with flavors of coffee, molasses and dark fruit. Not a bad beer at all, but still somewhat of a letdown after all the hype."
"Overall I really don't know why this is in the top 100. I've had other stouts that deserve the spot more. This was good but not worth the hype. Oh well, glad I finally tried it."
"D- Very easy to drink and enjoyable. Great taste and balance. I would drink this one any time."
"the drinkability is great, it's got a finely balanced bigness, that many beers go for, but few attain. this beer doesn't break any new ground, but it's an expertly crafted example of it's style."
"The beer pours dark brown to black with a decent-sized brown head. The aroma is roasted malt along with coffee and chocolate. The flavor is more of the same with chocolate standing out more than the coffee or malts. Creamy mouthfeel, which is the best part of the beer. Low carbonation. Not sure what I was expecting, but I was a little disappointed. A very good beer, but I expected a little more."
"Bottle vintage 2008. Pours black with brown edges, moderate dark brown head with good retention. Coats the sides of the glass when agitated. Aroma of red licorice, anise, chocolate, grapes, and oatmeal. Tastes of grape drank, cocoa, chocolate malts, finish has cookie and more cocoa. Feels silky but not chrewy with a creamy lower carbonation that is nice. Overall this is real good, though a lot more vinous than expected."
"Imperial stout trooper pours syrupy pitch black with a small thick dark brown. No light getting through this one at all...I think the reviews of this one have seen enough corny star wars jokes so I will refrain. Moving on. Not quite as big of an aroma as I would have expected. Bitter chocolate, assorted starbucks coffee flavored beverages, roasted malt, and an earthy/woodiness. Unlike the less than powerful aroma the taste is the opposite. Tons of flavor, this one isn't messing around. Lots of chocolate and coffee, some smoke, and more of those assorted Starbucks beverages (frappucinos and the like). Its full bodied...Drinkability suffered a bit for me. I don't know why but it took me a long time to put down my helping. I was ready to be done with out after my 7-9 oz pour. Overall a great stout, but unfortunately not a real standout for me. I'm not left thinking how badly I wish we could get this in Michigan. Certainly won't trade for this again and if I came across some I might pass it over in order to try something new."
"Overall a very nice RIS. Not exactly a world beater like I had hoped with a top 100 beer but a very drinkable stout nonetheless."
"D - Pretty solid imperial stout with low alcohol involvement but an overall feeling of booze. So roasted it's ridiculous but awesome that we drank this beer while listening to the theme."
"J"
"Pretty good stout that I have been wanting to try for a long time, a little disappointed though and thought it would be better. I recommend to try this once, but its nothing spectacular that stands out."
"There is a lot of coffee / roast in the back of the mouth. Makes the beer pretty bitter. There is no carbonation in the mouth but the beer is medium bodied. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is good."
"D - Wow. This is fantastic. Give me another or two please. 5.0"
"A nice drinking stout. Would gladly drink it again, but wouldn't go out of my way based on how easily obtainable other stouts like Old Raspy are in my area."
"D â€“ I wouldnâ€™t seek to drink another one of these, though I would like to have one just to keep it for the Star Wars factor."
"I'm keeping my extra bottle around for a while."
"I'm glad I cracked open one of my bottles, but I'm even more content that I have one left in my cellar! Though we wont see this label again, hopefully NEB will continue to brew this recipe, unchanged."
"D-this is some easy drinking. It is a little thinner than I prefer and pretty straight forward in terms of taste. doesn't really bring the complexity or body of the top stouts; but it isn't bad."
"Bottle pours oily black with chocolate tan head. Aroma is dark roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and mild hops. Heavy mouthfeel that coats the inside of my mouth. Flavor is upfront dark roasted malt, caramel, coffee, chocolate, and finishes with sweet dark roast. Overall this stands up to some of the best stouts. Just doesn't have all the dimensions of the best of the best. Is 2 to 3 dimensional. Very nice brew."
"I had really hopes for this stout but I was disappointed. The best thing about this is the bottle, being the Star Wars fan that I am. But the beer itself is tasty but a little simplistic."
"D: Highly drinkable. I do not think this is best stout I've had but it's way up there. I enjoyed it a lot and it is exquisitely drinkable."
"Big thanks goes out to Tim of TheKingsOfHop from BeerAdvocate for cracking this open and letting me sample it. Out of a bottle this famous beer was a nearly black hue with one finger of dark tan head. The retention was decent, though not impressive, and it left good lacing in streaks. The aroma was full of rich, roasted malt notes, some dark fruits, some boozy alcohol, hints of nuts and mild chocolate. The flavors were excellent, I was all about this one! I tasted lots of dark malt and roasted coffee up front, the bitterness of which was balanced by semi-sweet chocolate like Nestle morsels. As it warmed I tasted hints of vanilla and licorice as well as some well-hidden booze. The mouthfeel was very smooth and rich, the body full and the carbonation perfect. Very fulfilling and highly enjoyable."
"sourness and biting carbonation hamper the drinkability. Having never had this beer, I'm not fully sure if this is how it should taste."
"Poured a dark coffee color with a good-sized dark tan head. Aromas of coffee, dark sugars, a bit of burnt toast, chocolate, and traces of vanilla. The taste complements the nose, with everything shining through with a nice balance. Mouthfeel was fairly thick, but somehow not quite thick enough for the beer behind it. Not too much alcohol presence, but not very much was expected given that the abv is in the low end of the range for the style. Drinkability is quite nice, and I'm glad I got to try this one."
"D: What a wonderful brew that lives up to the hype in my opinion. A very easy to drink RIS. Not over the top complex, just very well put together. I have another bottle to age - can't wait to see how this tastes in a couple of years"
"d- sooo drinkable, not filling at all for an ris, no alcohol noticiable at all,"
"F: Semi dry actually, mostly from the bitter earthy dry roasted char from the crazy roasted malt flavors and bitter black patent malt. The bitter earthy ""stout"" taste seems to linger with it, and a little more chocolate and dark fruit come out late on the finish. The taste also sticks with me for hours after I'm done drinking as it seems to have filled all the pours in my mouth and acted like concrete to just settle and never leave. It's a delicious beer that lives up to the hype. I can only imagine how smooth it'll be after a couple years of aging."
"D- A great beer. Strong aroma and strong taste."
"D = Very, very easy to drink and down-right dangerous. This is my favorite stout hands down. Glad to have a few bottles. The Trooper is dead. Long live the Trooper!"
"Had the pleasure of finding this brew on tap the Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Received from draft in a twelve ounce pub glass. The dark atmosphere made it hard to get a good look at the color and opacity but from what I could tell it was jet black, allowing no light to pierce it. A short wispy, mocha colored head was fading away as I was handed the beer. It was served to me at a pleasantly warm temperature...glad they know what they are doing there. I can clearly smell coffee, followed by bitter chocolate and burnt maltiness. Faint hops and alcohol in there as well. Nothing too complex coming from this beer. The taste is what you would imagine from the smell; coffee and bitter chocolate with a slight hop and alcohol at the end helping to give it a smooth finish. Some pleasant fruit notes emerge from the darkness. It is very drinkable, evidenced by the three glasses I quickly drank. The body however was lacking. Maybe this is a tap issue? Most reviews I have read from the bottle say the body is great, but to me it was thin on the palate. I would have expected it to be more viscous, creamy and rich. Don't get me wrong, this was a great beer that I am really glad to have tried, but still not the best stout I have ever had and I was expecting a little more complexity from it."
"Overall an excellent RIS that lives up to the hype. I just traded for 2 bottles of the current release so I plan on aging them as I feel this beer will age well. Also this is the last year for the name, so it's kind of cool to have a bottle that will never be made again."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick and creamy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding! It has a rich, black and roasted malt scent along with some mild chocolate notes. It has that beautiful, bitter, black malt character. The taste is very good. It's damn smooth with a stiff patent malt flavor. It's bitter and bold with a nice roasted/chocolate character. The hops are quite noticeable and really integrate well with the black malt character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great beer. The hype was justified. Major thanks to my friend Arpit for the opportunity to try this gem."
"The 8.50%abv is hidden inside of this one, amazingly well. It is so easy to drink. I'd like to have an endless supply of this around, so that I could drink it everyday...because I would."
"D: A really good RIS, the anticipated led me to have big expectations. They weren't shattered, but not entirely exceeded. The balance flavors and mouthfeel of this beer are a treat."
"Cheers!"
"D: Between the mouthfeel and the flavor packed into this brew, a truly superb effort from NEBC. I enjoyed this with some Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies and savored every second."
"Not as thick in the mouth as I thought it would be, but tasty. Mostly just espresso/bitter...and loads of dark chocolate and malty. Booze isn't detectable at all. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste but maintains a sweetness on the lips. Very, very good stout!"
"Drinkability is ridiculous for the style. Poor man's Kate the Great is definitely a fitting description here. Not that poor of a man though. This is a solid one."
"Overall, glad I finally got the opportunity to try this one. As stated above, the flavors were not that complex, but that was a good thing. Lots of cohesion and just a sessionable imperial stout, if one ever existed."
"This is a great beer and probably the best stout if not one of from the East coast. Smooth drinkability and almost chocolate milk like at times. This has great chocolate malty balance the blends perfectly with other grains in this beer to deliver a pleasurable drinking experience. I can't get past how creamy this beer is and is without a doubt one of the better stouts I have had the pleasure to have tried. Awesome! Highly recommend.."
"Thick and full-bodied, verging on creamy. This beer hits a great balance between the sweet malts and hoppy bitterness."
"Pours pitch black into a snifter at the Armsby Abbey in Worcester. One finger light cocoa colored head with good retention. Head is creamy with small bubbles and after it dissipates a small cloud coats the top of the beer. Thick lacing coats the glass as I drink this one down. Smell blasts me with coffee initially and then huge roasty malts. Earthy hops are also in the mix. I also get a burnt sugar/caramel malt scent too. This is a pretty standard RIS smell, nothing really jumps out at me. A bit more strength on the smell would be nice. Taste is gigantically roasty malts. They coat the sides of my tongue while earthy hops hit the middle. I like the earthy hops and how they work but I think they are a bit generic for a hop taste. Cant get the coffee in the taste but the roasted malts are good enough to satisfy me. I burp out fresh hops. Mouthfeel is silky smooth medium thick bodied with lower carbonation. This level of gas suits the tastes very well. Alcohol is pretty non-existant in the taste and MF. Huge coat of hops stays on the tongue after sipping. Drinkability is nice. The taste is worth the price I paid for this on-tap. It is not too over the top for an RIS and is a great example of the style. The roasty flavors are what I look for in an RIS, no cocoa/coffee take over here. The hops are the only thing here that may be overdone/a bit generic. No real off flavors, I can't wait to try this one aged from the bottle (the hops die down and this may become perfect)."
"Rather than detracting, the carbonation, coupled with the relatively low sweetness, inviting flavors, and pleasant aftertaste, make this a surprisingly drinkable brew. I could easily go through several of these, and in fact drank nearly the entire 750 in one sitting, without even realizing it. It's too bad that this great beer is so hard to find."
"Awesome drinkability. Well hidden alcohol, tons of flavor and slides down so easy. I also love the fact that this comes in 12 oz. bottles. Perfect for those nights when you don't want or need 22 oz. of a RIS. Lives up to all of the hype."
"Enjoying a 2010 750ml right now, excellent. Everything listed above with some hints of smoke, molasses and licorice. Not much of a hop presence, this is all about those beautiful stouty malts. Not a hint of the ABV which seems to have been changed from 8.5% to 9.2%. Extremely drinkable. Pricey but worth it as a special occasion beer."
"D - Pretty smooth imperial stout. A little bit on the boozy side, but it is pretty fresh...might smooth out with a little bit of age on it. Seems higher in alcohol than 8.5%. Still on the sipper side of things, as one would expect from an RIS, but pretty nice."
"Huge thanks to irishct15 for throwing this in as an extra. Pours like used motor oil, very very thick. Absolutely blacker than black with one of the darkest heads I've ever seen on a beer. Not a very large head though. Really nice nose. Lots of dark roasted malts, along with chocolate and hints of coffee. Some sweet dark fruit aromas blend everything together nicely. Taste just as good as it smells. Lots of dark fruit sweetness hit the tongue followed by a delicious roasty finish. Dark chocolate and coffee also making themselves known. Can't really detect any alcohol at all. Has a very rich and creamy mouthfeel that is just perfect. Can't think of a better beer to sip on a cold winter night."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer and worth it even without the name. Since I work in a pretty nerdy environment, I expect to get a lot of complements on the beer bottle while it sits on my wall. Pair the bottle art with the name and the excellent taste, this is a beer I will be trying to get a case of next year."
"Outstanding!"
"Rob, feel free to use this review on the label of the next batch.Bring on the bourbon!"
"This is definitely one of the best of its style and deserves the hype that it's getting, and remember, this one was not served in optimal conditions either."
"d- this stuff slides down your throat so easily, all the tastes blend together in this brew and they are balanced so wonderfully. this stuff is world class."
"Poured from a 750 into my glass the color of over used motor oil, blacker than black. The smell slowly came forth as the beer warmed. smelled of coffee, chocolate, hops, and touch of smoke. Nice dark chocolaty taste up front followed by bit of an espresso and light smoke flavor. Smooth as baby's bottom across my tongue. I sat and enjoyed this over a few hours and still wanted another bottle once i was finished."
"I have to give the drinkability a good rating because I kept wanting more and was not overfull after drinking 22oz of it."
"All in all this brew was very good. Didn't live up perfectly to the hype, but after a year or 2 of aging, I can see this one being pefectly amazing. I recommend aging before cracking this. This a great brew for people that enjoy very strong hops upfront with flavors buried on the backend. Short of perfect, but still very good."
"Very well done New England! I can't believe a beer this good is brewed so close to me! You deserve serious kudos for creating this fabulous stout!"
"drinkability: good"
"Overall, an excellent brew and so glad I got a chance to try it. I'm sort of torn between wishing I had regular access to this and content with my situation now. On one hand, I would love to try this again and again, but on the other, I enjoy having a positive balance in my bank account."
"It was great to see this one still around when I grabbed it in Lexington today. Poured straight in to a tulip glass, this beer is pitch black in color, and has a fairly large tan heading. In the nose I get cake batter, extreme chocolate, licorice. In the taste I get some chocolate, a large amount of alcohol, some black currant, cola, molasses, more alcohol, overall very complex. As another reviewer mentioned, alcohol wise it feels much stronger than the 8.50% that is listed. The body on the other hand comes off as much lighter than expected when considering the large flavors going on with it. I am really enjoying taking my time with this one, and sipping it slowly. I have the admit that the first time I tried this brew a couple years ago, I was not the least bit impressed. This time around I am very impressed. It definitely ranks for me amongst the best of the New England Imperial Stouts. One final thought: Do you think Star Wars fanatics are seeking this beer out as a collector's item? Would not surprise me. Cheers"
"Had this beer on cask at the real ae fetival in CT this year. It had been aged for 42 weeks in oak whisky barrels. I cant begin to say how wonderful thi beer was. The aroma was a sensual mix of coffe, chocolate, and vanilla. The taste was smooth and silky with a nice sweet balance of roasted malt and hops. It finished smooth and creamy. The oak and whisky came through in the middle and added to the warming senation of the alcohol. If I ever get a chance to try this beer in that way again I will consider myself lucky."
"The body is full with thickness and lingering sweetness. Astringency is there but not over the top. Some fusel/heat notes are a bit of a distraction. A great name and an excellent beer to boor."
"But now's your chance. hold steady, you have one shot. It will either be over for him, or you must dread the ripping, thrashing death that awaits you. Wait until just the right moment... you cannot miss."
"Appreciated super-extra, thanks dave (drmeadows). Pours a fairly thick black body with dark brown head, that foams up to a large bubbly head. Aroma, after it airs out, is roasty and chocolate, attractive. Drinks above-average, smooth, with good chocolate and roast. A superior RIS among many good RIS out there,glad I tried. The booziness seems higher than listed. Much licorice in there as well."
"Chocolate milkshake and tobacco flavors are prevalent, along with a touch of raisin. This is a serious RIS. Velvety smooth and dangerously drinkable for something I know will destroy my soul if I continue!"
"D: Even with lower ABV, this is definitely a sipper. The big and rich smoky and smoked meat character can take a bit of effort to work through."
"Drinks fairly easy, a good take on the style, but not upper echelon IMO, was still happy to try it"
"D - One of the easier-to-drink RIS I've had. The smoothness of the body and the hidden alcohol help the drinkability on this."
"Drinkability: So good I had to go back the next day to have another, definitely worth a try and I can't wait till my next chance to have this."
"D: This brew was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to have it again. Definitely worth the hype and if I have to say so myself, no question that this is on par with Dark Lord, the stuff worthy of a cult following."
"Thanks Conneticutpoet!"
"D - Other than the body of this Imperial Stout, I was extremely impressed with this beer, too bad I do not have more to age and taste each year, I can only see this one getting much better"
"Poured a deep black with little caronation and small brown head. Nose was faint with some roasted malt, coffee and cocoa coming through but not very robust at all. Taste had a funky sourness to it, notoverpowering but I did notice it but diminshed as it got warmer. Cocoa, roasted malt, some dark fruits as well. A big sweetness, bog on mouthfeel and a hardy beer. Got totry it thanks to Far333."
"D - A nice RIS, but somehow feels bigger than 8.5%. The slight over-carbonation is forgivable in the 6oz pour I had, but might have got a little irritating over a full bottle. I think a bomber would be too much of a good thing here."
"Drinkability: This was one of the most drinkable imperials I've had to date, though not something to have on a frequent basis. The very smooth taste definitely let the alcohol sneak up on you."
"Drinkability gets good marks for two reasons. First, it went down quite easily... REALLY makes me with is was less than $10 a bottle, or at least bottled in bombers rather than a 12 oz. Second, the ABV was not noticeable in the taste at ALL. Much like World Wide Stout, that was simply wonderful."
"ok, so the flavor could have been more robust. but the masking of the alcohol makes this amazingly drinkable for an 8.5% ABV stout."
"Drinkability: This reminds me very much of Kentucky Breakfast Stout, without the barrel aging, but it's not nearly as complex. To be honest, I really struggled with this beer. I wanted to like it a little more than I did, looking for places I could bump the score up half a point, but there just really wasn't anywhere it was appropriate, and I ended up focusing on what I didn't like as much about this beer more than on what I liked. To be sure, I liked this beer a little more than my score indicated (hence the 0.5 bump in the drinkability), but I feel like: 1) it could be a lot more than it is; and 2) it's just as complex as many beers that it's similar to and reminds me of. That being said, 8.5% abv isn't nearly as fierce as many of those ""similar"" brews, which also enhances the drinkability somewhat. Recommended? Definitely. A solid beer? Most definitely. Could it be more? Absolutely."
"Poured into a tulip style glass, comes out very dark in color, almost black, it's very thick, you can tell while you're pouring it. There was a dark brown head that fades pretty quickly, not much lacing to it. You can tell there's some lacing, but it falls down to the liquid after a couple of seconds. Smell is good, nice chocolate aroma followed by some roasted malts, very nice. One of the more tasty Russian Imperial Stouts I've had in quite awhile. Has again a nice smooth chocolate taste, almost like a fudge. Mouthfeel was pretty good, not too much of a carbonation at all and it's pretty smooth. Very drinkable for a Russian Imperial Stout, like stated before pretty smooth. I really enjoyed this I plan on getting it again."
"Drinkability: Glad it was not a bomber."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied with strong carbonation."
"Smell and taste are similar, lots of bitter chocolate, slight coffee and some toffee and fruit on the back end. Mouthfeel is about what should be expected, creamy with mild carbonation. Drinkability is fantastic for a RIS."
"Very drinkable. Love this beer"
"What a great beer, tons of flavor offerings, easy to drink, well balanced, and all around delicious."
"The flavor is of roasted malt with coffee and bitter dark chocolate notes. A little astringency is present, as well as vanilla. I get dark fruits in the flavor and a little molasses. The finish is dry and roasted with a touch of sweetness."
"Very thick mouth feel, it's almost syrupy but it isn't sweet at all, it's just so thick, smooth and almost creamy. The taste is just as you'd expect dark coffee and maybe a hint of dark chocolate. Really solid stout, amazing name and one of the coolest bottles I've ever seen! Seek it out!"
"Slightly thin, but there is a nice creamy feel to it. Slight warming from alcohol. Very nice."
"D: I really struggled with whether or not this deserved a 5 in this category. As far as RIS's go, this is incredibly drinkable. I have to keep myself in check to not chug, gotta savor this one because it is the only on I have. Everything works in this beer. My only gripe is that the nose and flavor could be a bit more hefty and robust. It seems that this beer does just enough the flavor and aroma category, but it could be amazing. It has the canvas but broader strokes could have been used in the final painting. Still a great beer but it could be skyrocketed into the realm of amazing. Still a great experience."
"GREAT BEER!!"
"D: pretty drinkable, with the 8.5% well-masked the velvety texture really helps this beer go down easily"
"First of all this beer gets some serious ""points"" (not included in my score) for packaging. The description of this beer, ""brewed in a galaxy not too far away"" is a nice touch. Pours pitch black thick like motor oils similar to other big RIS with an almost non-existent fizzy off-white head that disappears within seconds. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate and big espresso. The taste is smooth and creamy with chocolate, chalky cocoa and espresso. The mouthfeel is high in carbonation begins a little rough before getting smoother. Drinkability is good for the high abv, i had no problem finishing the bottle. Overall a solid RIS that I was fortunate enough to try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Not overly heavy which is nice as it makes it easier to enjoy. This here is a tasty imperial stout that doesn't go overboard on ABV, making it something I can actually drink and enjoy on a weeknight. Thanks to warriorsoul for the hookup."
"The problem with this beer is that i was so good and drinkable that i could have many many more and there isnt that much to go around."
"D. I think that the 8.5 alochol is hidden and balanced."
"Excellent beer. I can see why this one is lodged in the top 100. Would love to try it again with some age on it."
"A great beer overall and definitely one of the best beers that I've had from a Connecticut brewery."
"D: Quite drinkable, a very nice version of what is my favorite beer style. Extremely smooth, balanced and flavored to near-perfection, this is an RIS I""d love to have again. Recommended and quite well done, all hype aside."
"D: Given the ABV this might be one of the most drinkable stouts my palate has had the pleasure of tasting!"
"D - This is a good RIS."
"D - I could see myself having more than one."
"Imperial Stout Trooper's a hell of a good beer. I like it a lot. It's got a really nice flavor, but doesn't quite reach the upper echelon of the RIS world. There's nothing overtly wrong with it, but it lacks that something special it needs to reach the next level. It probably wouldn't be tough to get there. A stronger coffee flavor or a bigger hop presence would probably do the trick. It's tough to pick on it too much. It's a damn good beer. I'd love to give some extra points for the kickass label on the bottle, but that doesn't factor into the score. All in all, it's a very good beer that's worth seeking out. Top 100? Nah, not quite. But, it is very, very good. Find a bottle...if you're up for a round with the Dark Side of the Force."
"I Will have this beer again."
"D - Too heavy handed on the flavor and I don't really care for the smoky charred aspect. Nice, but one is enough."
"Truly a fantastic beer and I look forward to more"
"Got this in a trade from Ineedabeerhere. I'd been wanting to taste this for a while, so I was really glad to have this opportunity. Thanks! This beer is quite, quite good and I think lives up to the hype. I'd put it up there near the top for RISs. Pours viscous and absolutely black with a fairly thin head even after a hard pour. What head there is is chocolate brown- one of the darker I've seen. It smells nutty and quite chocolatey, with a powdery dark cocoa aroma as well as some cream, licorice, and even some spicy hops on the finish. Very nice. The taste is beautiful. Extremely smooth, almost syrupy, but only slightly sweet. Wonderful, rich cocoa notes dominate followed by some licorice notes, a touch of coffee and vanilla. Really well balanced, and very nice. A slight dustiness on the finish. Wonderful mouthfeel, that is silky and thick, and creamy but not overly sweet or unctuous. A tiny bit powdery, but to me that just heightens the interest and gives the tongue some purchase. Very, very nice and in fact perhaps a bit better than I expected."
"Overall, I'm glad I as able to try this, but it is not my favorite in the class."
"Near opaque mocha pour, pitch black in the glass with a short-lived dark brown head. Looks oily and viscous. Big chocolate malt aroma, little bit of burnt bread, caramel and vanilla. Similar flavor; chocolatey up front, but well-attenuated. Chewy without being cloying. The balance between sweetness and bitterness is excellent, making for a rich but surprisingly drinkable imperial stout. Bitter, roasty, borderline burnt finish that's balanced with just a touch of molasses. This is a great example of a traditional, no-frills imperial stout."
"A well crafted brew from a great brewery close to home!"
"Bottom line: Stout Trooper ranks amongst the best of the style that I've tried and it comes from my wonder years state of Connecticut. Another big thanks goes out to Wasatch!"
"How is this beer not in the BA Top 100. Really makes me think the BA formula is crap, whether the bros care what i think or not. This is definitely a world-class RIS, and I'm sure it would be in the Top 20 on BA at the very least, possibly Top 10, if it were more widely available. I was very lucky to be given a chance to try this one and I plan on keeping my second bottle for some time to come - possibly forever because I love the label so much! Thanks again, Chris. You is da man."
"Drinkability: A definite sipper, as there's too much going on in this one to drink it quickly. It's also very different and more complex than most imperial stouts. Best savored slowly over a long period of time. I'm glad I got the opportunity to try this one."
"Drinkability: Tasty. Should you ever decide to live your beer-drinking life to the fullest, then grab up a bottle of the Imperial Stout Trooper and enjoy."
"mouth has a slight boozy presence but this is a very drinkable beer. I am very happy that jason was nice enough to send this along out of the kindness of his heart. :)"
"Overall: A feel that a lot of RIS's try to impress you with their big and robust flavors, instead of creating a more balanced type of beer. I'm not saying that I don't like beers like the Dark Lord, Bourbon County, or Kate...but this beer takes the more subtle course in it's being...which is a nice change of pace. A must try. Cheers!"
"my only real complaint is for the price that's a small bottle of beer. glad to have tried it though."
"D - The mouthfeel makes this one go down easy, but this beer has definitely blasted my palate."
"Finally got my hands on a couple of these bad boys at Firehouse 12 in New Haven last night (very cool place, by the way). This is one of the best imperial stouts I've had - very original character. Lots of dark chocolate and bourbon, a little licorice. It was served a little cold for my tastes, so I didn't get a real idea of what the feel would be like at ideal temperature. Once I finished the first one, I immediately ordered another. I'll be picking up a bunch of these for sure."
"Medium carbonation, feels thin at first but the carbonation rescues the beer in the finish."
"One of the top 3 stouts I have had the opportunity to taste."
"2010 vintage opened 2/15/15 and served in a tulip.  Still some carbonation - pours with a dense, half inch, mocha-colored head that slowly recedes.  Roasty notes, some char and a slightly vinous character.  flavors have definitely mellowed - not bad, but not as much cocoa and just starting to oxidize.  Vinous quality in the nose is also detectable in the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel hasn't changed all that substantially.  Definitely past its prime, but it's still held up admirably despite being 5 years old."
"D - Very good RIS with an amazing mouthfeel. I would imagine this is the kind of beer that Dark Vader would enjoy. If not, then I find his lack of faith disturbing."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Pours pitch black with a beautiful dark caramel colored head that quickly recedes. Smells heavenly with coffee and burnt malts dominating the nose with some tobacco notes also present. First sip is amazing in its flavor and mouthfeel. Dark chocolate, coffee, black licorice, vanilla, raisins and light tobacco all blend well making a balanced but very complex brew. This is very special. It is great to have a super hyped beer that is truly worth of all the attention. World Class!"
"Thanks to SteveO1231 I got 2 of these beers in CT several weeks ago. Now that I've had one I can see why it's hyped (but I can't see it as being worth the coin it commands). The beer was dark brown-black with dark mocha foam. The smell is strong RIS, roasted malt and dark fruits, a little coffee and hints of alcohol. The taste was wicked and rich, roasty but still sweet, very filling. This is a thick RIS but nothing near Dark Lord or Darkness viscosity, more like Mephistopheles. Very good, but couldn't it be made for half the price?"
"D: As big as this beer seems, the booziness never gets in the way and even on an empty stomach I didn't feel the effects of its' abv. Fantastic!"
"This is a very good RIS, but I'm not sure it quite competes with the big boys, with the KBS's, Abyss's, Dark Lord and Speedways of the world. Regardless, this is still a very fine, very easy to enjoy beer."
"Gets my salivary glands going, coats the mouth. Could easily put away a few of these, but that's not really the point, is it? A good example of the style, not really sure I see what all the fuss is about, but I definitely enjoyed it."
"When I look at the spectrum of RISs I've tried, this one just doesn't stick out for me. I'm sure some will be nuts about it, but the toast emphasis just didn't do it for me. I should note that this is extremely well put together, so my hat's off to the brewer, as I said, this one just isn't for me."
"D - A tasty imperial stout. Heavy on the chocolate."
"First noticed a thick dark brown head staying with me until about half the pint was gone. (I drank this very slowly because of how strong it was and because I didn't want it to end) The color bared a close resemblance to motor oil. In the aroma I sensed many notes of chocolate as well as a bitterness. I could detect the alcohol but it was a positive, adding to the warmness of the beer. Then comes the flavour exploding in my mouth with all the malt, caramel, and hop undertone goodness coming through. Mouthfeel is rich creamy goodness, really fills your palate. Drinkability is amazing for the style. Favorite beer from my favorite style."
"A shame I will probably not get another opportunity to try this."
"Loved it!"
"I have to say that I wasn't expecting a great beer given the gimmicky bottle, but what I got was a fantastic textbook RIS. It's not the most complex or original beer in the style, but it really nails the style for me. Fantastic."
"Pours a midnight black, some lighter brown highlights when held to light, and a beautiful two-finger mocha-colored head that fades slow, and leaves lots of lace. Dark chocolate aroma, black coffee & espresso notes. Flavors follow right along, nicely charred edges, and some milk chocolate notes mixed in with the dark. Slight heat from the alcohol, spicy on the lips, a little more actively carbonated than I'd expect, but still somewhat chewy/creamy. Yeah, this is the goods."
"A nice beer, great nose, very enjoyable. Gets a little rough around the edges, but still a very tasty stout."
"D - A rather subtle stout, a pleasure to savor slowly."
"D: Very drinkable. Better than I thought it would be. Probably a tad overrated. The label is amazing though."
"This one was pretty good, though I was hoping it would be better. Wish I had another one so I could age it and see how it changes."
"Even mouthfeel, perhaps just a bit on the thin side, even carbonation. Very drinkable, great sipper. Gimme a big fat maduro cigar."
"Drinkability- This is the best RIS I have ever had in my life. I wish I had more. I have never been so taken with a beer before. Too bad the price is a bit high. Would I buy it again? YUP. I hope others get an opportunity at this one, as it is one of the best. I can only hope the KTG I have on monday lives up to the hype as this one has."
"It's a sipper. It's enjoyable. Is it world class? No. Is it over-hyped and over-priced? Yes. Glad I tried it but I wouldn't blow $9 on this again. Now, barrell-aged, that's a whole different story."
"Picked this up in a trade thanks to ralflord. Pretty much black with a creamy tan head. I'm drinking this too late so don't have time to let it warm up enough. As a result, I can't smell a whole lot, but what's there is chocoate and typical dark roasted malt notes. Taste is more of the same plus some hop bitterness lurking in the background. Doesn't taste overly complex to me, but nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and medium carbonation. Pretty drinkable, but nothing exceptional here. I've read that these are 8 or 9 bucks a bottle. If so, it's too much in my opinion. Cool looking bottle though."
"Pours a solid black with a thinnish tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells of chocolate syrup, dark chocolate, a faint bit of hops in the back. Taste is chocolate syrup, some milk chocolate, and a bit of caramel. Hop or roast bitterness linger in the finish. Body is medium, mouthfeel is heavy and oily, carbonation is low. Definitely a sipper. The chocolate is nice, but I would have liked a bit more roast. A bit more body would have helped this one as well."
"Glad I got to try this on cask as it was a unique experience."
"I have no idea what the ABV% here is and I can't even guess. It is either relatively low or really well hidden. These things coupled with a tasty beer makes this one really drinkable."
"12 ounce bottle that pours dark brown. This beer appears to be water thin. There is a decent brown head. The aroma presents light chocolate, char, and cooked sugar aromas. The flavor is mostly cocoa. Pretty hoppy and sugary. Thin body with lots of carbonation. Seems fairly run of the mill to me."
"This is mid-range to me between a true session stout and a classic RIS. It LOOKS like winter. As Ron Hawkins' amp used to say in masking tape on the front, ""Clean enough to be healthy, dirty enough to be happy."""
"Dark body with thin off white head. Good rich sweet chocolate aroma. A ton of aroma for a beer. Starting to thin a bit in the flavor but still good chocolate. Some sweetness and leaves a nice malty aftertaste. Light body for a stout but medium at a minimum. Can't wait for this to release again."
"This RIS makes me want to seek out some of the other offerings from New England Brewing Company. i see they come in cans, even better."
"At nearly $9 per bottle, Imperial Stout Trooper is well worth the investment, given its relative rareness and masterful local brewing. Gives Old Rasputin a good run for its money, though it's not as good a value. Still, I keep loving what these local homebrew heroes keep coming out with."
"Thick and creamy and somewhat tannic from the roasted malt. A big very good imperial stout."
"This pours near black wih a thin espresso head. The nose is very chocolatey with roasty malts and aged hops. The taste is also a nice blend between the chocolate and big malts. Full body passes well over the palate. A well balanced beer that is right up there with the best."
"D-Nice. This is better than expected. Quite complex with lots of dark, dry, astringent notes. Why is this retired? Please bring it back!"
"D: The stout tastes heavy, boozy and warm. This was a good one to split."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a well-made, flavorful and highly drinkable RIS and is one of the best that I've had in its style."
"D: Not a huge pour as this one was shared, but it would be a great one to sit back with an entire bottle just to enjoy."
"Very well done, and very good."
"Big thanks to naproxen for this unbelievably delicious treat!"
"Taste: Molasses and rich chocolate flavors are the centerpiece of this brew, fruity esters phase in and out with an underlying mellow bitterness from the hops and roasted malt. Roasted grain becomes more evident mid-palate to balance and then blossoms into the finish, which is surprisingly clean for such a big stout. Roasted grains take hold of the palate, chocolate and coffee linger."
"The taste is bitter sweet, strong alcohol but soothing, it continues with a dark bitter chocolate, caramel, mouthfeel that is balanced by a spicy, peppery, hop bitterness. Wow this is a great stout one I hope will return or shall I say ""Strike back""."
"Amazing brew... This one needs to be revived..."
"Taste starts out with a roasted kick, then the dark fruit aspect hits the sides of the tongue to spice things up which then melds to a mild bitter coffee aftertaste, very creamy and smooth throughout, above average carbonation for the style but it works well."
"The dark side rules!"
"Pours out motor oil black with a chocolate milk head that dies to a ring. Smells roasty with a hint of almond, maple and caramel. Wow, tastes very very roasty, I love it. Coffee ground like bitterness, some caramel and chocolate. A little thin in the mouth. Nicely drinkable. Fun beer to celebrate with on Easter after giving up beer for Lent."
"My only issue with this beer is the weak aroma, however it does intensify a bit as the beer warms. I wish I bought more than one and it was more readily available. P.S. Love the label!"
"Pours black, probably the darkest beer I have ever drank. The head is a nice darker shade of brown, with average retention, the lacing being pretty weak was the only thing holding it back. The smell is rich with dark roasted malts with fresh coffee bitter chocolate, and some hints of oak. The flavor is so smooth, with lots of the dark malts hints of vanilla and coffee, with a bit of a hop bite that gives way to a lingering burnt malt flavor, the alcohol is almost completely hidden. The mouthfeel is creamy but light, especially considering the probable alcohol content, and this one is so drinkable. Its a complete and utter shame this is probably the only one I will ever have."
"Pours pitch black with a tan head. Nose is mild. Malts and very mild coffee. Flavor has a noticeable sweet character but its just smooth as silk. Great balances. Very smooth liquid feel and a low but appreciable carbonation. This is a great RIS. So easy to drink."
"Extremely impressive."
"Pours a super deep and opaque black, thin brown head forms, settles down to a solid collar, leaves some lace spots. Smell is nice, chocolate, roast, cherries, alcohol, toffee, sherry, vanilla, more chocolate, pretty intense, great. Taste is chocolate, licorice, sherry, very fruity, roast, toffee, some spice, cocoa, nuts, really complex. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, low carbonation, smooth, very nice. great RIS, thanks for this one Russ!"
"Drinkability- is through the roof for the style especially. The gentle balance of the hops versus the hop slam of other large RIS really helps out here. This is an exceptional beer that I hope to be lucky enough to find some more of."
"Seek one out."
"Drinkability is good. This is a nice example of the style. Not quite up to snuff with some of my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts, but this is still a high quality brew that I am glad I got a chance to drink."
"Delicious blending of chocolate, vanilla (love that vanilla!) molasses, a bit of coffee (but not too much) and tart/roasted cherries. Just wonderful in every respect. Perfectly carbonated, great chewy mouthfeel."
"Overall I thought this was very good. I would not put it up in the call of an Older Viscosity, or the Abyss, but aside from those it was excellent and I could easily see myself having this one again. Now I did not mention it in the appearance, but this has to be the coolest bottle I have ever seen. I am a huge Star Wars geek and this one just made my night. One of the few bottles that I will be keeping around for a while. I would say if you can get this one, definitely check it out, it is worth it, a very high quality stout that was remarkably smooth and consistent."
"Drinks well. One is satisfying while two might be wasted on a tongue that has already done battle with a very good beer."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer, but was surprised, i think i was expecting more. Paid $7 i think back in the day and just opened it up now."
"Aroma of hot cocoa, vanilla and hot alcohol. Taste started out with notes of bittersweet chocolate, melting into a creamy marshmellow middle. Next came the espresso notes ending with a big alcohol coating. Subtle, creamy loveliness yet hot at the same time. Maybe that's why it's The Imperial Stout Trooper? I liked this one...alot."
"The alcohol sneaks up, but for style is so drinkable because of the luscious taste and rich, silky feel. Try pairing with dark chocolate - It's a real treat!"
"Very mild mannered RIS. Flavor and smell could be more complex but this wonÂ’t trash your sense of taste for the night either."
"Drinkability- The mouthfeel alone make this brew worth trying. It's really good but that being said, I think I expected something more along the lines of Bells Java Stout. The fruitiness is rather surprising along with how the coffee isn't the main focus. Big thanks to BeerTruth and gpcollen1 for this tasty beverage!"
"This is how a beer should look in a glass, two finger rich dark chocolate brown head sits on top of a thick jet black body. nose is full of meaty, roasty malt with hints of sweetness. Smokey feel is dominate on the nose. Syrupy sweetness is up front on the tongue at first sip. Zesty richness is carried by the malt smokieness. Does thin out a bit on the back of the palate with a slight bitter sour battle. Very thick mouthfeel that carries hints of coffee bitterness. Chocolatey feel overall adds to the drinkability. A very good stout that will probably age well for one or two years."
"drinkability is excellent. well balanced. nice depth and complexity. a very fine stout. thanks mark!"
"Excellent RIS...one of the best I've had recently. I'm giving the taste a 4.5, but it's more of a 4.75. Well worth seeking a bottle of this out!"
"Dark black with ruby edges, and a small head of panna cotta, whipped meringue, espresso foam. Aromas are familiar to us all. An imperial stout all the way. Dark roasted malts, various incarnations of dark/dried fruits, heavy wines (durif?), slight booze, and coffee. Taste is awesome with some nice dark fruits, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and again a sort of heavy red wine vinous character as well. Mouthfeel is thick, but honestly it did not help to cut the slight booziness that I mentioned earlier. This knocks the drinkability down one notch as well. Still, as it stands this is a killer example of a northeast brewed imperial stout."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a thick, oily looking very dark (almost black) brown. There was just a touch of a brown head on it, but it didnÂ’t last but a few moments. Mainly roasted coffee aroma, with a bit of sweet chocolate also. The aroma is a touch milder than I expected. Maybe a touch of vanilla as it warms. A bit silky on the tongue. The taste is complex. Yes, there is a roasted coffee and hint of chocolate, but there is also a lot more going on in there. Some sweetness, definitely some fruits in the mix, but blending nicely together. A very nice brew."
"I wasn't disappointed. It is simply and delicious if you just drink. Lots of chocolate goodness. It is complex and delicious if you choose to experience it. Chocolate, coffee, hops, creamy, malt."
"Poured into a chalice a thick black color, nice carbonation, small brown head, some oil slicks and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, chocolate/toffee, roasted, maybe some vanilla. The taste is fabulous, malty, nice touch of roastyness, and slightly vanilla (sweetness). The finish is slightly dry, the alcohol is hidden very well. Full body. Very Drinkable, this is another awesome RIS people should seek out, Highly Recommended. Glad to have 2 more bottles left."
"Overall a very good beer though very overpriced at almost 8 bucks, having said that it's a tasty treat worth trying and is surprising easy to put down for the abv."
"As for drinkability, I found this beer quite tough. The roasted character and the intense alcohol presence (I would estimate this beer to be around 11% ABV) were both a bit overwhelming (as was the $8 price tag)."
"The Force is Strong with This One."
"D: Quite."
"I was presented with a bottle this weekend, apparently this is no longer brewed and finding any stragglers is a task. Anywho, I was impressed right off the bat with the extreme blackness of this beer, even the milky head was the darkest brown ive seen. Absolutely delicious and dark, I almost felt like I was chewing at some points but I like that in an Imperial Stout. +10 points for the label."
"from gpcollen1 in the original Anniversary bombing"
"Imperial Stout Trooper leaves its awesome bottle in an inky black stream on its way into my glass. This beer is darker than the dark side completely opaque black with an orange brown head, the head is darker than many brown ales, very imposing in the glass. The smell is maybe one of this beers few shortcomings. I'm getting chocolate and black coffee/espresso maybe a bit of vanilla and a good deal of alcohol, there maybe some figs and plums hidden in there as well I would have liked some of the dark fruit to be out front more. The taste is very coffee like a little sweet I'm getting some bitter chocolates and also a little bitter tangyness from hops this subsides as the beer warms. There is a little alcoholic warmth but most of the actual alcohol flavor is nicely masked not much in the way of roasted burnt malt bitterness. At first this was a bit too prickly on the tongue for my taste but as it warms some of the carbonation subsides and leaves a wonderfully smooth beer with just enough bubbles to keep things moving, the finish is a bit warm and dry but very satisfying leading perfectly into the next sip. I was really excited when I was able to find this at the store. It is great to see such amazing beer brewed right here in Connecticut two thumbs way up to NEBC and please brew this one again!"
"How can you not love this bottle!! Pours an thick, oily, pitch black with a huge dark brown three finger head that takes a bit to die down, but settles to a nice thin layer. Stickiness is ok, not as good as I thought it should be for the style. Smell is somewhat weak, but what is there includes dark fruits, dark chocolate, and fresh black coffee. Tiny hint of alcohol in the nose. For some reason there seems to be a musty smell too, not very enjoyable. Taste is all about the coffee/espresso. So smooth and creamy on the tongue with a sweet caramel aftertaste. Midway through there was a very surprising hop tingle. I don't know what the abv is, but I can't taste any of it. Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied with very little carbonation. Great sipping brew, get your hands on it if you get the opportunity."
"Notes: A nice and strong imperial stout. Well balanced and overall very tasty."
"Thank you NEBC!"
"Thanks jaxon53 for the beer and giving me the muse to write such a nerdy review!"
"Drinkability - Wow. The challenge and reward is to hold a mouthful long enough to fully consider it. Thanks AMP!"
"And by the way, the bottle is awesome, and the guys down at the brewery are pretty cool too, if you get a chance to meet them. Personally, i think it's the best beer they've put out. Nice job with this one."
"A hefty Imperial Stout more memorable for its unique hop presence than anything else. A pleasant, local offering that's worth a try."
"Pours black, ruby red around the edges, a nice pumpkin pie colored head dissipates quickly. Aroma is strong on the roastiness, some twangy sour acidity mixes with a hint of booziness, a very subtle and soft powdered chocolate sweetness is also evident. Roast malts also dominate in the taste some soft sweet chocoalte at the front of the tongue blends with a tanginess and bitterness at the back. Finishes with a drying bitterness leaving a roast and smoky aftertaste and a hint of alcohol. Alcohol is fairly balanced and only slightly noticeable. Soft medium to heavy body, slightly oily, is cut by a tingling bitter bite before the dry finish. Very nice roasty and slightly smoky stout. Thanks cooperrip for the opportunity."
"D - Very easy to drink, not exactly a session brew by any means, but nonetheless a damn fine brew."
"Thanks again to cooperrip for a great DL day and for this in trade. One 12 oz bottle poured it into my brand new Three Floyds nonic glass. Head rose about an inch, now lingers a good two centimeters off the surface. Its milk chocolate colored with hints of gold. The body is pitch black and completely opaque. The aroma is big and grandiose with tones of roasted barley, notes of unmalted barley and oats. I canÂ’t really discern a specific hop presence over the intense roasted malt aromas, meaning I can smell a subtle hop presence, but I canÂ’t say what for sure. I get the usual (but very welcome) dry roasted coffee with both salty and smoky almost leathery notes, also hints of chocolate and earth. The flavor is equally as robust as the aroma with a malt forward coffee like flavor to start, balanced by a tasty bitterness shaped by that great dry roasted character, reminiscent of dry roast coffee beans cover in bitter dark chocolate. Alcohol is present really only in subtle and welcome alcohol warmth, just right for the style. The mouthfeel is very chewy and thick, yet still extremely quaffable. Although it is almost summer this is still delicious, but I can only imagine how great this would be in the dead of winter. They really should, just man up and make this stuff annually. Very drinkable I wish it wasnÂ’t so expensive though. And I just gotta mention the sweet graffic of the storm trooper such a cool name and a cool image. Well worth the experience."
"Beef Notes: I hunted this down after having it on tap and leaving the bar amazed. I might have rated it higher if I didn't experience it on tap first, but it is still an incredible beer. Grab it if you see it because there's not many of these in the world."
"First sip has all the makings of a nice stick stout. The retention of the head has all the makings of a fuzzy soft cappuccino head. Dark fruit notes are very present and fade well into a bitter coffee flavor that's mostly noticed on Sunday mornings upon waking up. A tad smoky with spicy undertones that almost shock the taste buds and finish with an apparent sourness. Interesting balance on this brew, which is almost quite perfect. Sweet caramel balances out the bitterness. Rich and thick with a full bodied mouth feel though extremely smooth. Very nice and extremely drinkable especially with the low abv. Another fantastic offering from nebco, but at that price for a 12oz., I'm not sure if I'd buy it again. Too bad it doesn't come in 22ozer's as I'd reconsider."
"taste is dark, sweet, very gonzo-imperial-porter-like in flavor, but a strange aftertaste is detected, possibly recognizable due to the temperature. Continued sipping made this less and less noticeable. Very tasty otherwise, sweet and semi-smooth with some charred taste, very complex...bitter chocolate and an explosion of flavors.. Not overly hoppy, multiple hop types going on here for sure...hard to pinpoint, some citrus and floral notes. Mouthfeel is full but not overkill. Not an alcobomb but very warming, this beer is especially good for style, not my favorite, but glad I snagged some and am hoping to see it offered again. Nicely done NEBco."
"Overall, I will have 2 of the 3 that sulldaddy got me, that is, if I can ""handle"" the Evil Empire! Yummy!"
"I am very, very impressed by this beer. Great complexity, huge flavors, but it's all done with finesse. Definitely worth the hunt to find some."
"Heard nothing but good things about this one. Served at cellar temperature in a snifter. Poured a deep oily black color. Probably the blackest I've seen. About one inch of dark, coffee brown head rose from the glass. Somewhat thick and tight. Decent head retention. Smell: Tons of chocolate up front, some bitter roasted coffee, and a toasted maltiness, with no alcohol present in the nose. Some toffee/caramel aromas were also noted. Taste: mostly of bitter coffee and sweet chocolate with a touch of vanilla, caramel with a sweet malty backbone. A small hop presence, moderate carbination and a smooth, warm, slightly bitter alcohol finish. Not boozey at all. Mouthfeel is full, thick, and pretty complex. Drinkability is great. Great bottle and worth the money."
"split a 12 oz bottle with a friend. Looks like any good RIS should. Black,thin tan head that lasts throughout the experience. The smell is great, roasty, toasty coffee and cocoa,maybe a hint of alcohol but not too much. The taste is wonderful, just like it smells. Burnt coffee and chocolate with a nice hoppy bite underneath the huge roasty backbone. The mouthfeel was pleasant. I like my RIS's a bit deeper and denser than this particular impy stout but this beer has a long,lingering aftertaste that does satisfy. I guess the drinkability is good for the style. I could easily drink a couple bottles myself. One of the better imperial stouts on the east coast. cool bottle as well."
"M&D - smooth, thick, syrupy, and rich on the palate, a wonderfully thick impy stout, a great beer, the cost is a bit of a turnoff, but a great beer, from my neck of the woods, will have to visit this brewery soon, if possible, if you can get this, get it. if not ask nicely and i will trade you some."
"This his how I like my RIS's. It's a shame that this is so limited. Ranks up there."
"On top of being one of the coolest bottles out there, this is by far the best beer I have had in many many months and I trully hope t hat New England comes out with this one again. Pours a deep creamy think ungodly black beer with just the right amount of head. The maltiness is delicious and you can not taste any alcohol. At $7 a bottle is is a little expensive however after having one I feel I got a bargain, George Lucas be dammned."
"Pours a jet black motor oil with a giant tan chocolate milk like foamy head. The head leaves fantastic lacing making this beer a sight to behold. The smell is strong with expresso beans,coffee,chocolate,and dark fruit. The taste is strong with chocolate,coffee,cocoa,dark fruit,and a creamy mix of milk and alcohol. The m/f is heavy and very creamy. This is like pouring motor oil down your throat. Very impressive and a classic beer from a small brewery that you should check out."
"Cheers."
"This is my new favorite RIS...too bad it's limited. First had it on cask at the Real Ale Fest.in New Haven, CT....I hesitated before buying a bottle because of the price ( $6.99 for a 12 oz.), but I don't regret it now....money well spent...hopefully there's some left that I can get and age. Nice going NEB...please make more of this ! It's just too damn good to be a one time brew."
