4.52,3.7,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Tastes of smooth milk chocolate, with an outstandingly creamy, mouthfeel, brownies and fudge, along molasses and nougat, blending together very smoothly and convincing. These flavors get successfully balanced by calming, earthy, slightly toasted malts. The chocolate then gets a alcoholic Bourbon note to it, just as in the nose, with hot wood blending extremely well into the rich chocolate qualities of the beer. This reveals molasses, wood and a well wrapped up rich chocolate character. The beers incredible chocolate richness gets joined by a hot, boozy peak in the finish with caramel and a well fitting, lower carbonation, and a hot dryness.","aleigator","0"

A little bit of burn from the alcohol, but not too bad. I'm sure with age this balances out nicely.","aleckpa","Dec 29, 2014"

4.35,-0.2,,,,,,"I like Sexual Chocolate, the regular one, it's a good, solid beer. The barrel aged version raises the bar exponentially. It smooths out the licorice notes and adds tremendous depth. The barrel aging is more a compliment to the base than the main component as it is in so many other heavy handed barrel aged beers these days. If you see this beer anywhere, take it and drink it.","joe1510","Sep 09, 2014"
4.5,3.2,,,,,,"Poured on-tap at the brewery on the release day.  The beer was served in a snifter, and it pours a jet black coloring, with a tan halo of head.  Nose of chocolate, booze, vanilla, oak, and coffee.  Extremely rich.  Flavors are heavy booze and coffee forward, with a blast of bittersweet chocolate, wood spice, and roasted notes.  Heavy and velvety, with a bittersweet cocoa nib aftertaste.  All chocolate, with hints of bourbon here and there.  Perfectly balanced and huge.  Roasted and rich chocolate linger on a smooth finish.  Great beer!","GarthDanielson","Sep 08, 2014"

Nose starts with mellow vanilla, some harsh barrel notes, and a bit of oxidization present which brings on some sherry like notes. Dark chocolate and roasted malt is present beneath the barrel. The taste is smooth and starts with dark chocolate. Next comevanilla and charred oak with more oxidization. Dark fruits come out. Tons of flavor here that is very well balanced. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall, a nice beer that pack a flavorful punch. The oxidization is a slight drawback, but still a tasty brew.","homebrew311","May 20, 2014"

Stout-like appearance, black and opaque, with a nice cap of dark brown head that retained as a ringlet, leaving a few streaks on the glass, dabbed with light lacing. Roasty dark malts in the aroma, dark chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. In the taste, good blend of bourbon/vanilla/coconut sweetness and chocolaty/malty roastiness, with neither really taking dominance, lesser notes of coffee, cocoa bitterness, and toasted oak, slight hop presence in the finish. Medium-full body, smooth, not too hot, quite drinkable. I didn't really think this was too distinctive in the world of barrel-aged stouts, but what it was, was a good and tasty beer overall. A major improvement over the rather lack-luster regular version.","Rifugium","Jan 23, 2014"

Boozy in the middle as well, with a good bit of accentuating barrel flavors. I know this was aged in Pappy 20 barrels, and it shows. The bourbon ALMOST takes over the original beer, but it needed to. The base was SO bitter that it needed to mellow out, and it did beautifully. The base malty bitterness has turned into a beauty of a malt. It would be a 5.0 in terms of taste, but BA Blackout takes that. Its just not as sweet and balanced.","VncentLIFE","Sep 08, 2012"

3.98,-8.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Black with a dense, dark brown head with good retention. The nose has a nice milk chocolate character with coconut, vanilla, and bourbon. Apparently the bourbon was intense, but what really stood out for me was the excellent SC chocolate character. The palate opens with bourbon, plenty of cocoa and chocolate, with plenty of milk chocolate as well. Medium-light in body, this is too dry, with the thinness of the base beer, and the accompanying powdery dryness reminiscent of cocoa powder not really standing up to a fairly intense barrel character. Moderately tannic on the finish, this is solid, but I don't think it's an improvement on the base beer.","DefenCorps","Sep 14, 2011"
3.84,-11.9,3,4,4,3,4,"OVERALL: This is definitely a great barrel aged imperial stout. It is not, however, a great barrel aged Sexual Chocolate. If that makes any sense. The great story the base beer told, what with the sweet and roasted beginning and the bitter, chocolate overloaded finish, just gets totally drowned out here by the bold and albeit wonderful flavors of the PvW barrel. They could have put any base stout into the barrels and it would have turned out the same, so they should have bottled more of the base beer and got it into more hands. Nevertheless, if you’re a fan of PvW barrels, you will love this beer. I loved it for sure, but wish it had been more of a barrel aged Sexual Chocolate. This was an awesome beer night though, so thanks heaps for making this happen Doops. Thanks to John again as well.","Jeffo","Sep 09, 2011"

Poured pitch black with a two finger light brown head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, wood, vanilla, and sweet alcohol. The flvor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, wood, dark fruit, sweet alcohol, caramel, and vanilla. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew without a doubt. I am really impressed how well this one carried across in the bottle as compared to tap. Probably one of my favorite BA Stouts I have had to-date. While this one is not the most robust RIS out there the flavors make up for this by being perfectly blended and enjoyable to keep you coming back over and over. This bottle did not last long between the group that evening. So good that my guest kept the bottle to remember it by... The mouthfeel was a little thin though, but meh, you can't win them all I suppose. Get this on your palate if you have not already.

Eric said it best when he said ""it's good, but even if this were available at the Total Wine down the street, I'm not sure I'd go back to get another"". A disappointment, both in hype and in style.

I really like how the bourbon is strong but not so strong to cover or obscure the base stout, it accentuates it well. There is slight cocoa elements with a bitter accent to the light caramel and roasted elements with some sweetness and creamy tinges in the flavor a slight dry woody astringency carries through the mellow cocoa which is slightly bitter and combines with the hop spice in the finish. Overall I was well pleased with the taste as I sipped this over and over it was great to taste side by side with the original since you got the pleasure of tasting how much the barrel aging can add in only a 4 month period of time, it doesn't really need any additional time in the cellar IMO, it is great and I consider this a top notch barrel aged beer.","Slatetank","Jul 20, 2011"

3.5,-19.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3,"Pours a very dark, black, with little head. The nose is very dark chocolate and some acrid burnt something or other along with the oak. The tannic quality of the oak and some sort of charred malt or baker's chocolate is ruining the flavor for me. Not enough of a sweetness to balance the bitterness. All of the group I was with apparently had this beer before and remember it to have been better. Regardless, there is some chocolate, oak, roasted malt and some mild bourbon/vanilla character. Big rich mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation. I might be overstating it above, but this beer lacked that 'chocolate punch' the name would seem to imply, going with more of an acrid, bitter (not hoppy bitter) character from the barrel or overroasted malts or dark chocolate or something. The sweetness mentioned in other reviews was not present for this bottle, but would have been welcome. Didn't work for me, but maybe fresh its better.","seeswo","Jul 17, 2011"

Smell is sweet bourbon on top of the chocolate malty goodness of the base beer, really nice. Sweet dark fig, almost…the bourbon sweetness is really nice. OH WOW. This is by far one of the finest bourbon barrel aged beers that I have ever tried.

I don't think I'll have the chance to drink ""too much"" of this one again, but you bet your ass I could. this stuff is great.","Freethyhops","Sep 27, 2010"
4.62,6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Beer is medium bodied, bigger body than the regular sexual chocolate. Its sweet with a vanilla oakiness to the back of it. The bitterness is minimal, there is some mild sweetness and of course nice chocolate. The liquor character of this beer is quite forward but its not hot. Its the kind of big ass stout you could drink all night on a cold winter night. Its truly an amazingly well balanced beer. Again, its sweet without being cloying, its not TOO heavy, its not thin, its bourbon but not hot, for as young as this beer is its amazingly good. I may need to get some of this.","drabmuh","Sep 26, 2010"

4.8,10.1,5,5,4.5,5,5,"d - I loved this RIS; I enjoyed every aspect of it a lot. We tried a few great barrel aged stouts (BA Blackout, Ivan the Terrible) and I thought this was by far the best one. I find normal Sexual Chocolate a very good beer and thought this blew it away. Loved everything about it; would love to try again sometime.","mdfb79","Sep 20, 2010"
4.58,5,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Finally getting around to actually drinking and reviewing this bad boy. Poured from the bottle into my Portsmouth balloon glass. A hard pour reveals a lovely black body with a huge billowing khaki head that sticks around for quite awhile. Leaves some lacing along the glass. Smells absolutely exquisite. A nice balance of sweet bakers chocolate and bourbon. This one isn't a bourbon bomb at all, but rather achieves a nice balance with the bourbon integrating perfectly with the other aromas. Taste as good as it smells. Dark chocolate, sweet dark fruits, and a light roasted malt flavor as well. All the while being balanced perfectly with the bourbon. You can definitely taste the bourbon but none of the normall ""hotness"" you get with it. Very nice job of barrel aging here. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel that coats the tongue nicely. With the perfect amount of carbonation. Although this is a big barrel aged beer its never overly sweet or cloying, and the alcohol doesn't get in the way at all making this one dangerously drinkable. A definite home run from Foothills.","scifan","Sep 20, 2010"

So happy to have made it to Winston-Salem on release day, can't wait to see if we can do it again next year!","jsanford","Aug 29, 2010"
4.44,1.8,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Black pour with coffee brown highlights that I may have just been imagining. Slight ring around the top of the glass where a head might once have briefly sat. Rich smells of straight alcohol becomes more palatable as the beer has a chance to warm up a bit. Dark chocolate syrup, bosco, fills the air. The alchol heat is still present, but more identifiable as bourbon. And underneath it all, the roastyness of a stout. Taste is not as sweet as the nose would imply. The chocolate is more of a dark syrup than the milk chocolate taste of a Young's Double Chocolate. This is quite hot. The bourbon is aggressive and gives each sip a slight afterburn. Mouthfeel is nice, but I have had better - Speedway and Ten Fidy come to mind immediately. Drinkability is good, but not great. Again, this is a hot flavorful monster, and it drank slow. This was fine stuff, and I can only hope the bottles drink as well as the keg.","Onibubba","Aug 29, 2010"
4.52,3.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Low carbonation and very, very smooth. Alcohol is well hidden as one could easily polish off a few pints of this in a session. This is the real deal and a perfect example of how barrel aging can take a good beer and make it incredible.","rudylaw","Aug 29, 2010"
4.67,7.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I think I like this a tad better than the regular version (I usually prefer original versions over barrel-aged ones). The fact that the bourbon isn't intrusive, and that the extra special treatment makes everything glow a bit brighter, it's clearly a very special version of an already special beer. Rock on, Foothills.","Metalmonk","Aug 29, 2010"

4.46,2.3,4.5,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,"D: The first time I had Sexual Chocolate, I was very disappointed and I immediately thought that it needed something else. Perhaps this barrel aging was it because this beer is far superior to the regular version. More robust, more complex, smoother, and simply more drinkable. Not all big beers do well after sitting in the barrels, but this is definitely one of them!","SpeedwayJim","Apr 23, 2010"
4.82,10.6,4,4.5,5,5,5,"First glass served on-tap at the bottle release! This batch is aged in W.L. Weller barells. Served a deep opaque black with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a bit of oak in front of roasted malts and smooth cocoa. The taste is a wonderful blend of oak and Bourbon in front of bitter cocoa and roasted malts. The beer is very smooth, and easy drinking with its alcohol quite well hidden, bit it is still a real sipper. While I was hoping this release would be Pappy Van Winkle aged, this is almost as good, hands down one the best beers I've ever had.","atsprings","Oct 05, 2009"

4.97,14,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Unfuckingbelievable! Poured in my Double Bastard glass. Nice rusty brown, root beerish color. Tiny bubbles danced about with virtually no head. Smell was incredible. Light chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and bourbon. The bourbon was mized in nicely, did not overwhelm the beer. Taste was equally great. It mimiced the smells almost exactly, with an expectional balance. Man, do I love BA beers, especially Stouts aged in bourbon/whiskey. This beer got better as it warmed up, and was very easy to drink after awhile, which with it's high abv can cause problems. Definitely on my top 5 beer list. Pursue this incredible beer with the utmost of vigilance.","ralflord","Aug 16, 2009"
