I wasn't at all prepared for the blast of dark fruitiness that hit my taste buds at first sip. It's almost overwhelming, but disguises the booze so nicely and differentiates this one from others. It has a really pleasant and mild finish that makes it easy to drink. Overall, a great experience.","Zaso","Feb 12, 2015"
4.34,1.4,4,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,"Overall, what an experience!!  To be in his presence at last is such a lovely thing.  You hear the rumors, but even after assessing his aroma, you aren’t satisfied that they may be true.  The nose is sweet, yes, but not overly cloyingly so.  It has the fruit, the coffee, and sugariness, but they blend to a harmonious end.  Then, you sip.  The sugars hit your teeth, and you reel backwards.  At first, it is admittedly shocking, but the more you give into it, the more it warms you, drawing you in.  You begin to appreciate the cloy for what it is, and by the end of the glass you are stuporously happy.  Still, you find yourself yearning, reaching for balance in the world through the foggy darkness.  You beg for each and every one of those fifteen perfect to dive in and pull you from the sugary muck.  They only come as rumbles from the depths of the gullet; they do not ride across the top, where you wish them to be found.  We are sad to see him depart, and as our only vintage we have no basis of comparison, but perhaps a younger beast would help quell some of his uncharacteristic sweetness.  Rest easy Dark Lord, and thank you.","TheBrewo","Feb 10, 2015"

I smell molasses, raisins, and SWEETNESS!  It's over powering. Next the taste. It hits the tongue and yuck! What is going on here? Sweetness up front so big that whatever happens afterwards doesn't really matter. Tastes like some put some PEZ in my beer. Id pour it if I hadn't chased this one down.

I was expecting it to be more bitter with ‘darker’ aromas, but this beer is sticky sweet.  The taste is even more so, massive malt bill here and the flavor holds true with an overpowering yet complex sweetness.  Lots of different flavors there of rich toasted malt, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, some soy sauce and tobacco, surprisingly complex for such a rich, sweet beer. The mouthfeel is awesome, so rich and creamy, silky smooth (maybe a touch cloying, but not overly).","mtomlins","Sep 16, 2014"

Sweet on the front of the palate, chocolate covered cherries comes to mind. Slightly soy sauce on the finish, but not unpleasant. Very full bodied with no carbonation. Very viscous and creamy.  Overall a very pleasing Russian Imperial Stout, better than I expected.","JohnG190","Aug 20, 2014"

4.88,14,4.75,4.75,5,5,4.75,"Traded for a bottle of 2014, had tried small samples of past vintages at tasting events, but was glad to have an entire bottle to sample. Color is deep black, with a very thin mocha head. Smell is deep, sweet, indulgent chocolate/vanilla combo with slight dark fruit and a hint of alcohol. The taste is incredible, really complex, with the sweetness dominating and just a bit of bitterness. More sweet, rich chocolate and vanilla with some caramel mixed in, and a bit of bitterness from the coffee. Surprisingly, the coffee flavors are not overly apparent, and serve more to balance out the intense sweetness of the beer. The high ABV is really well hidden, hardly any noticeable alcohol. The mouthfeel is perfect, so smooth and rounded. Love love love this beer, if you don't love sweet beer this may not be for you, but I found it wonderfully complex and drinkable, each sip was fantastic. Excited to trade for another and possibly make a trip to Three Floyd's for Dark Lord Day next year.","Thepleasantimbiber","Aug 05, 2014"

Would love to know how this one tastes fresh, with the inclusion of coffee, but I can't really complain, because I can't help but feel that the coffee would overcome what has become a subtly complex beer, with lots of sweet and savory notes over the course of the glass. Very happy to have been able to try it, but given how limited it is, not sure I'll go out of my way to seek it out again.","LambicPentameter","Apr 13, 2014"

I assume if I had had this before Black Tuesday I would appreciate the sweetness a bit more. But a beer of this size needs barrel aging to curb the overbearing depth of malt. My bottle was slightly oxidized so I docked it more based on that. I'll see if the demand of a BA DL dies down and try my luck then.","PlinyBeMiney","Mar 11, 2014"

It smells great- no green apples, though it does got a straight up sugary sweetness but you can get a lot of complexity in it- coffee, port wine, dark fruits, milk chocolates, cocoa- which is very good. Flavour-wise, its the same- dark chocolate and black coffee bitterness, dark fruits, milk chocolate, sugar and molasses contributing a lot to the sweetness of the beer. And the mouthfeel is very good as any Dark Lord can be. No heat in this, even as it warms up. Not that hard to drink. Overall, with a year and half on it, its done very well. Its still sweet, but very manageable and complex. Its a very good imperial stout, its also overhyped but in my opinion, its a very good and unique RIS that shouldn't be confused with the best but should still be appreciated.","Stevedore","Dec 08, 2013"

It tastes like they threw a ton of ingredients into a brew kettle and forgot to ferment it. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad beer, I've had much worse. As far as Imperial Stouts go though I've had much better and those were far more accessable. Lots of dark fruits, it almost tastes like a blend of a Quad and a RIS, leaning more toward the Quad. This is a 2012 bottle, the 3rd I've had, I also had some on tap at DLD when I picked this up. I have 4 more bottles, I'll probably drink one every 6 months, we'll see if and how it develops. If you've never had it it's worth trying. That being said I wouldn't suggest going out of your way or spending a lot to get it, chances are you have much better Stouts already waiting for you at your local bottle shop.","ausch30","Oct 31, 2013"

The sweetness is a little odd to me – and at the end of the day it’s all about balance and I just feel like a certain aspect of the flavor was a little much. But again, that’s being hyper-critical as this beer is massive/unique, and I’d love to try another bottle.","DRBiser","Aug 20, 2013"

Aroma of sweet roasted malts, raisins, molasses, chocolate syrup, candy sugar, and a hint of alcohol smell. Flavor is sweet molasses up front, sweet powder sugar, a bit of dark fruit, a little bitter chocolate on the finish. Nearly no trace of the 15% abv. Sweet sweet stuff. Super velvety smooth mouthfeel and very thick. Only other stouts that have had this mouthfeel come from CCB (Hunapuh, Marshal Z). Plenty of carbonation to keep it from feeling syrupy. I was expecting more on the chocolate side, but this balances sweet molasses with dark fruits prominently. The best part to me of this decedent stout is the mouthfeel. So glad I finally got a taste of this. I can see how this would blend nicely with bourbon and vanilla. ISO now I guess...","BMMillsy","Jun 23, 2013"

I had a lot of fun at DLD for other reasons, but the outcome is definitely disappointing. However, with that said, this does get a high-ish overall score from me because no matter how cloying and grating the drinking experience of this beer is, it's easily one of the most memorable I've had, for better or for worse. It's by far my new favorite crappy beer, because as awful and unbalanced as it may be, it's a lot of fun to drink and is the most intimidating in the style - which is probably exactly what FFF is going for. If you want to see how an imperial stout *shouldn't* be made, but still want one to sample what could be THE hyperbole of craft beer, give this a shot. It definitely is worthy of discussion alone, whatever the hell it is.","magictacosinus","Jun 16, 2013"

Three Floyds has a reputation for pushing the envelope, and I think it fell right off the table on this one. It is still a very good beer, but it is not worth jumping through the hoops that you must to get it. Try it, but do not trade your left arm for it.","THANAT0PSIS","May 17, 2013"

It isn't overly sweet, it's crazy smooth, and all of the flavors I'd want in a stout are present. I wouldn't go after years 2009-2012 just from what I've heard, but this vintage is absolutely worth seeking out.

Then again, it was split 5-ways - I might be saying something else had I finished the entire 22 oz. bottle on my own. Though I typically prefer my RISs to have a heavy bitter offset from a huge hop addition, Dark Lord showed almost no hop character at all and was still pretty enjoyable to me. Vanilla, cocoa, caramel, molasses, dark fruits, oak... This is a great beer; though it may be too sweet to drink a bunch of, Dark Lord is awesome in small pours.","tectactoe","Feb 03, 2013"

Loads of roasted malt flavor in a wonderful balance of chocolate, roast and coffee. Great thick and creamy feel - really incredible. Flavor is medium sweet without even a hint of stickiness. Not quite my very favorite imperial stout but very close and I could see a different version or a bottle with some age on it winning me over entirely. Edit: Later vintages have seemed sweeter. I'm not sure if I was just really in the mood for a sweet beer that day or 2010 was excellent fresh.","popery","Jan 26, 2013"

Aromas are boozy, roasted barley, dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, cherry, and blackberry perhaps. Initially it's sweet and syrupy with notes of dark chocolate, raspberry, blackberry, cherry, cocoa, roasted barley, vanilla, molasses, espresso, booze. Full flavored with maximum complexity. Unbelievably good! Mouth-feel is thick & chewy, full-full bodied, viscous, and very smooth. Overall, definitely an upper echelon RIS. One of the best out there, if not the best.

This was my first time having the '12 but I thought it was drinking still a little bit on the sweet side but fairly nice (everyone else said it tasted better then when they had it when it first came out). After this we also opened up every year down to '08. Aging it definitely made the beer more smooth and mellowed the sweetness a little bit to make it more drinkable. You can definitely tell a difference between the years and this ages with the best of them. My favorites were the '09 and '11. Personally I highly recommend this beer and I think it is one of the best examples of a RIS. If you don't like sweet beers or sippers I would maybe stay away.","jaasen64","Oct 28, 2012"

Anyways, I think my friend Paul (azdback) put it pretty well when describing this beer as ""A must try but IMO not the holy grail."" I found the combination of whatever they used in this that resulted in soy sauce notes that come out a bit more as it warms to be what didn't take this RIS to the upper tier of its class for me. Still complex, unique, and good in it's own right, just not holy grail quality, at least not this vintage currently. Perhaps it's much better with substantial age. Anyways, again a big thanks to Matt for this bottle! It has been something I've been wanting to try since I got into craft beer and heard about this beer. And I'm quite glad I did get to try it. Not so glad I didn't split this with another person though. Seriously, the mouthfeel is big and awesome but this is a tough one to tackle solo even for me.","matttttYCE","Sep 15, 2012"

Flavor is extremely thick with malts, touches of molasses and chocolate (just a hint, ya know). Pronounced bitterness in a stout-ish kinda way. I really feel like this whole thing just rests on how thick the liquid is. If for nothing else (as if you really need a reason to try and get one of these), it's worth it just to experience how thick this is. I can almost chew on it. Almost.

I agree with a lot I reviews on this beer. It does have a motor oil consistency going down. It is dark as night with a light head and carbonation. Tastes like cofffee , chocolate, and the alcohol content is very well hidden. I live 40 minute from the brewery and am currently moving to California. I will definitely be flying back next year for my 4 beer allotment.","menkros","Jun 03, 2012"

Its resonant vinous aroma has been described as cherries, sweet malt, molasses, burnt currants, plus with a port wine alcohol overtow. Mochachino notes burned within. Motor oil consistency, hellishly smooth yet divinely burnt and vinous. The first sip coats your palate with a palatial charred fruit and chocolate blanket.

Aroma is dark fruit, plum, raisin, molasses, mild pine, maple syrup, toffee, and caramal. Taste is very sweet. Candi sugar, dates, raisins, molasses, toasted malts, raw earth in the back of your mouth, dark baking syrup, faint grass, and roasted barley. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. There is hardly any evidence of alcohol, which is amazing for a 15%abv. Awesome beer. So complex and amazing.

I'm guessing all that contribute to losing any coffee flavor, if it had any. It's licorice swizzled molasses with a bitter dark chocolate aftertaste. I can't compare it with any other DL because the age makes such a difference. Overall, I love it.

Scent is VERY VERY sweet...with some off-putting soy sauce aromas. I also pick up some lovely chocolate and brandy aromas, along with molasses and dark malt. Slight vanilla. Taste is...WOW...disappointing to say the least. Overly sweet...a ton of sugar, burnt sugar and malt. Lots of toffee with candied dark fruits and more sweetness. Slight soy sauce flavor. Mouthfeel is very thick, like motor oil, and hardly any carbonation. Drinkability is fair...but can only have a small serving of this. Overall, this was not nearly as good as I was hoping for. It's not too often that I go against the hype, but this was just not a good beer IMO. The sweetness is overpowering and just makes for a bad experience.

The smell is roasted grain, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and caramel, surprisingly no alcohol. The first sip confirms that this is a thick beer, full bodied with medium-low carbonation. Not as sweet as I was expecting and definitely not as boozy as I was expecting. Molasses, chocolate, roasted grains and caramel are the predominate flavors. Mostly roasty. Its still pretty sweet, but not as bad as I thought it would be.

3.77,-11.9,2.5,3,4.5,3,4,"Three Floyds Dark Lord pours a black so complete that I think the lights flickered when I popped the cap off. The light tan head can't quite reach two fingers in height, before the foam quickly dies away and leaves a largely clean glass behind. The nose is a little weak (although switching to a snifter for the second half of the bottle did help), and it's a little bit different from what one normally finds in a Russian Imperial Stout. Rather than chocolate and/or coffee, the aroma is redolent of molasses, licorice, and cherries and currants. The flavor doesn't have that same dull edge to it, and also manages to incorporate some more traditional imperial stout elements. A brief flash of dark chocolate opens things up for a molasses/licorice/brown sugar middle that really serves as th centerpiece of the beer. A mild coffee note then slides into dark fruity finish (those same cherries and currants). It's varied and complex, and if the roasty grain flavors were a little more prominent, I'd say it was perfect. The mouthfeel here is one of, if not the chewiest I've ever encountered. The body is as rich and viscous as it gets, and carbonation is barely, if at all appreciable. It's just too heavy and syrupy in the end to be good. Darklord is one of the tastiest stouts I've ever enountered, and is especialy smooth alcohol-wise for a relatively fresh 15% stout. The brewing process could stand to be tightened up though, as from a couple technical standpoints this beer falters a little bit.","axeman9182","Jan 23, 2012"

4.45,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"So here we are, Christmas 2011… 786 days after receipt of this bottle, a gift the night before my wedding from one of my groomsmen, I prepare to drink my first sips of Dark Lord. This is the 2007 bottling, picked up by my friend at Dark Lord Day 2007, which took place April 28th. So, it’s been 1702 days since it was picked up, or about 4.66 years. The cap opens with a small pffft, not surprising, though I’m concerned since it’s wax-dipped (silver) so I expected no oxidative damage or air leakage. The head starts about ¼"" thick, and it is vocal, snapping and crackling like a cindering log. It’s got a coagulated blood red hue to the deep brown color. Ok, maybe more mahogany, but the ruddy hues are unexpected. The beer coats the side of the glass in a brown, tobacco-juice like layer, and has a cola-like appearance. The coating layer is like looking through vintage negatives… The beer is not pitch black, it’s a dark brown, but it looks like coke at the edges. The smell is, of course, deeply malty. Reminds me a bit of bourbon, but without the booze. Some serious mash… Cherry undertones, and lots of port and madeira wine taking charge of the nose. Plums are in there, as are some of the strongest, “freshest” raisin notes I’ve ever picked up from a beer. Fresh out of the box CA-raisins. Really prominent. Fig newton filling pretty robust as well. I get a bit of box board, and paper, hopefully that isn’t an oxidation issue. I get almost no alcohol notes, which is just nuts at 13%+ABV. Ah, as it warms, and I swirl, the booze does get coaxed out. But much deeper and below the surface than anticipated. Slight burnt note, some chocolate, almost no coffee. It’s big-time madeira style. Crazy. Oh wow, first sip down… it is thick! Very thick. I can feel the weight of it hit my stomach. My word, this is nice. Extraordinarily mellow, considering how big and bold a beer this is. Chocolate comes out quite a bit on the palate, more so than I would have expected from the nose. There are no burnt notes, nothing scorched, just thick, almost milky chocolate and cocoa. A bit of mocha flavor as well. Lots of molasses in the fade. Suggestions of black licorice and a splash of vanilla emerge, but its amazingly port- and madeira-like. It’s rich without being sweet or at all cloying. Coats my front teeth in a way that makes me fear they’ll be permanently stained. But the good Lord has blessed me with the opportunity to try this beer, and I’ll embrace the risk. Finishes with a bit of charcoal and chalky dryness, which is a nice shift as the palate is dried out after all the rich maltiness, and, well, 'refreshed' is not the right word, but 'readied' for the next sip sounds about right. A very nice experience. Wish I had tried it fresh and had something to baseline it against, but it is quite a nice beer at nearly 5 years old and a very rewarding experience. Merry Christmas to me!!","AdvocateFan","Dec 25, 2011"

4.41,3,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I had this as a part of a small tasting thrown for a friend. It was poured into a tasting snifter it produced a great dark mocha colored head with about a finger and a half width. The smell has improved with some age when fresh it smelled hot and sticky sweet, that has mellowed very well the coffee comes threw a little more. Huge coffee flavor, some chocolate, dark fruit flavor like fig. The mouth feel has also thinned a little an some of that sticky sweetness has mellowed, it still coats your entire mouth and stays there. Overall this is one of my favorite beers I guess you can call me a homer but I am so happy FFF brews in my state.","phisigben","Dec 06, 2011"

Maybe this is meant to be aged, but most truly great RIS I've had are still awesome when fresh.

The smell doesn't really bring anything of note to the table. Taste is obnoxiously sweet, no coffee flavors at all, no flavor of any kind, just a sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, not too sticky, but the sweetness is all I can think about. Overall I was not impressed with this version. I liked it on tap at the release party but it has only gotten worse from there. I'm not sure if this is legal but I poured out about half of my glass.

This was, pretty much from the serious beginnings of my BA days, the one beer I really wanted to try, along with Westy 12. It may be a matter of me building this up in my mind beyond reasonable expectation. I don't mind the sweetness at all, though it's too much to drink an entire bottle without splitting it between 2-3 people. But, for me, there's not a real depth of flavor and, while the booziness is remarkably restrained, the flavors aren't particularly inspiring. The brownie/chocolate notes are nice, but the iron/molasses notes are a bit prominent after awhile. All in all, it's not a bad beer, but I now know that I won't go spend several hours driving to Munster and another couple of hours in line to get another one of these. Much better stouts out there, and way closer to home. Again though, huge thanks for the opportunity!","BedetheVenerable","Oct 22, 2011"

The taste is fantastic. So much to process. Sweetness that seems to suggest chocolate, vanilla, molasses. Unlike many stouts, the roast is hidden. For that, I think this beer stands out a bit to me. Some licorice in there too. Yum. The booze will get you if you drink too fast but it certainly does not overtake the beer. It is well hidden, which is impressive for 15%.

Small spots of lace slowly drip back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is prominently of dark dried fruits (prunes, raisins) and alcohol with some subdued chocolate (chocolate liqueur) and even more fleeting coffee aromas. Taste is extremely rich again with the dark dried fruits soaked in liqueur flavor being foremost. I am also getting some molasses and soy sauce flavors. There is a slight chocolate and coffee essence in the taste but these take a back seat to all other flavors. This beer has a very low level of carbonation with a thick and sticky mouthfeel. A noticeable alcohol burn hits the back of the throat with each sip. Overall, this is a good RIS but it is much different than I was expecting this beer to be. A very heavy emphasis on the dark fruits puts the other smells and flavors on the back burner. This is a very rich sipping beer that I took my time with and enjoyed.

I can say this for the beer, it carries a high degree of baggage, and it is difficult for me to be satisfied with a beer that carries sooo much clout and then deviates from it's own description of the beer.

4.49,4.9,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Narrative: Among the most challenging items on a daily basis that faced J.P. Cacoaworth was how to close the daily deal. Each day when he walked into his spacious corner office he took a hot snifter of bourbon and ruminated over the idea of closing the deal. Sometimes J.P. was as sweet as a candyman, providing settlement documents with a sticky panache. Sometimes he put the heat on and pressured the other party in by hectoring their better sense. He was a calm master of his trade, patience and full of sweet heat. Some would say that aluminum siding can sell itself, but they likely have not met the petulant master of faux wood coverings. “WELL IF THEY THINK THAT THEY CANT GET MOUNTING BRACKETS FROM ME FOR FREE, THEY HAVE NOT MET THE HATEFUL GOD OF WINDOW COVERINGS AND I WILL FLY DOWN ON MY BLACKENED CHARIOT OF RAGE AND IMPART FIREY SWEETNESS ONTO THEIR CUL DE SAC.” Today was a sweet day.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jun 23, 2011"

Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with a half inch brown head that didn't stay around for too long. Small amount of lacing left on the glass. Very sweet and rich aroma, it smells like dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla and some molasses. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it's very sweet. It tastes like roasted malt, dark fruit (cherries), milk and dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, molasses and a bit of charred/burnt malt. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's viscous and coating with low carbonation. It's very smooth and extremely easy to drink. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, it certainly doesn't seem like it's 15% ABV.

Everything that was in the nose, plus some dark fruity flavors, was lost behind a curtain of sweetness. It was not the easiest beer to get down.

Tasted the brew once cold and then gradually at room temperature for optimal tasting experience. The Dark Lord lives up to it’s name on the pour. The heavy bodied stout pours opaque black slowly out of the bottle and fills the glass with complete darkness that allows absolutely no light to come through. The glass is topped with a thin dark creamy head that dissipates quickly and with extremely light lacing that holds it's own throughout the session. Vinous aroma packed with sweet burnt molasses, currants, plums, dark cherries, vanilla, sugar-infused oak, toffee, sweet toasty malts, and maybe a hint of port wine alcohol undertow. Mochachino notes buried within. Motor oil consistency, hellishly smooth yet divinely burnt with amazing flavors and aroma throughout. Alcohol burn wiggles its way down your throat with a thick body. I cannot make comment on the carbonation as the brew is extremely dark. Man, this is a DANGEROUSLY good Russian Imperial Stout with the high ABV of 15% so well hidden. This is definitely one of the best 3F beers I've had next to the Dreadnaught! I can see why this is highly sought-after.

A small light chocolate head leaves a ring at the edge of the glass after it dissipates quite quickly. Not very mach lacing at all left on the glass. The aroma has a very strong roastiness to it. Also huge molasses and some licorice as well and a little bit of coffee. There is also a quite strange metallic copperlike aroma that comes through pretty strong as well. Light alcohol noticeable on the nose as well. The initial taste is really sweet with the copper note coming through as well as the molasses and licorice. This transitions into some coffee. The finish is strong roastiness as well as a bit of booze with a pretty decent bitterness. Full bodied. Low carbonation. Syrupy. I don't really see this beer is that highly regarded. I found it to be way too sweet and syrupy. The strange copper note was not enjoyable either. It does do a good job of hiding the 15% alcohol, but overall I just did not find this beer that enjoyable.

Dark chocolate, molasses, caramel, raisins, raspberries, licorice, and dry flavors too like a chocolate espresso and brown sugar oatmeal. Molasses and dark chocolate big time though.

The smell is dark malts, dark fruits; namely dark cherries and a bitter espresso and sweet bakers chocolate. The smell and the taste are much in the same. It starts with roasty malts and sweet cocoa flavor. Finishing nicely with a slight flavor is dark fruits and a slightly bitter coffee flavor and a touch of oak. This is very nicely complex. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. It kicks nicely at the end with subtle carbonation that livens up the flavors. I would never guess this is fifteen percent by the smell and taste.

Putting all that aside, this is a wonderfully well-crafted beer. Even relatively young, this Russian imperial stout already drinks with the smooth character of a nicely aged beer.

Nice heavy/medium mouthfeel. The flavors at this point are nicely balanced and compliment each other very well. Chocolate, dark roast, woody, dark fruit, some vanilla, it's all there and is pretty nice tasting.

Upon first smell I would have to say that there is a lot of stuff in here. Perhaps if we'd let this vintage it would have settled down a bit. Oddly my first whiff was of cherries, unfortunately the kind found it syrup rather than fresh off the tree. Other smells included: Chocolate, Bourbon, Raisin, bit of Coffee and perhaps hazelnut just for spice. The flavor is quite sweet and the intensity of the alcohol really gets the tongue, but the cherry is there on the tip of the tongue followed by a smooth creamy chocolate taste and a bit o' coffee to wash it all down. This is a damn tasty brew, it's a shame none of us have the patience to age it for a couple of years.

The nose comprises walnuts, dark chocolate, molasses, maple syrup, alcohol, caramel, brown sugar, black cherries, and a hint of oak. A buddy of mine claims he smells death in there as well, but the last time that hooded fuck came 'round...well, the less said about that, the better we all will be. The taste holds notes of chocolate syrup, maple syrup, Maraschino cherries (syrup and all, baby), coffee, cinnamon sticks. Lagavulin, cough syrup (damn, there's a lot o' syrup in here...), and some figs. The sweetness is ramped up a bit, as is the semi-tartness of the fruit. The body is pretty hefty, with a very light carbonation and a pretty chewy feel. Overall, a very nice, beastly stout, worthy of some of the hype, but not necessarily all of it.

4.57,6.8,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"2006 Vintage. Pours black as pitch- no hint of color when held to light. No reverse cascading head, but forms a solid two fingers of wet sand colored heavy fizz that shrinks to a thin cap relatively quickly- but expected given the ABV. Lacing is also expectedly scarce. The aroma of blackstrap molasses, baking chocolate, and roasted malt are abundant even not near the glass. Some brown sugar and background smoky, charred scents with fleeting whiff of clean alchol- no hop aroma to speak of but a very effervescent and vibrant bouquet. The flavor comes in a powerful but not overwhleming series of waves. First very deeply roasted crystal malt with dark caramel and turbinado sweetness. Then rich dark chocolate and roasted barley flavor. Finally a snap of lowland coffee and raisny/date fruitiness that slowly melts away leaving a surisingly light aftertaste with hints of soft english earthy hop flavor for a balanced bitterness. The alcohol feels noexistent save for whispers of booze when exhaling after a deep sip- very well concealed. Ghostly alcohol and hop presence manage to balance a beer that is obviously meant to be over the top malty and sweet. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected as well- heavy for sure due to lack of carbonation- but its 4 1/2 years old and 15% ABV. Drinkablity is high simply because the aftertaste is not overpowering or cloyingly sweet- not because you would want another bomber. Perhaps a little past its prime but for a warm sipping beer it is still fantastic. This is worth the wait and price, and truly stands as the Czar of Imperials.","PBRstreetgang","Aug 04, 2010"

But as one that has sampled several top IS's, this beer lives up to its hype and high regard. Starts sweet with the dark fruit. Then creamy with a pinch of carbonation in the middle. The coffee is very subdued but gives it that spice right after the creaminess subsides. Then the gentle bitters carry you to the finish. The finish is excellent. The velvety chocolate lingers on the tongue while residue from the dark fruit is still present. Notes of vanilla on the finish as well. The creaminess of this brew is what really makes it so special.

While world-class any day of the week, when aged for a year or more this one will surely astound your senses. If you can find a trade (or better yet make it to Muenster, IN for Dark Lord Day), trading anything excluding a Westy would be a good deal.","Hopfist","Feb 07, 2010"

It is New Years Eve, 2009 and I am sipping from a 2008 DL whilest enjoying a roaring fire in my living room in snowy New England. It doesnt get any better than this. The brew: pours thick, oily and dark into my stemmed Leffe Goblet. Having a weak sniffer, I need a big nose (no pun intended) to know i've got something special and I'm so not dissapointed. Dark fruit, raisens, prunes, currents, heavy dark chocolate and molasses all explode from the glass. Deep, dark chocolate, and maybe a hint of coffee with dark molasses sugar. As goes the nose, so goes the taste. Massive and complex, the dark fruit and chocolate bursts all over the pallate and the tongue is coated like heavy maple syrup, only balanced and sweet. This legendary brew boasts complexity like a super computer, yet is so smooth and pleasant to drink. No hop bitterness nor should any be expected, but the alcohol slowly navagates its way past your tongue and down, down, down in a warming yet very evident way. Very viscous and chewy, the mouthfeel is so very warm and inviting. Everything about this brew is warming. I am so fortunate to enjoy something this special in such a special setting.

Still, there is enough there that it is enjoyable. The taste is big and burly, but again there really isn't much complexity. There is lots of roasted malt, and oily chocolate, and more than enough hops. In fact the hops here just aren't sitting well with me. They seem to be taking away too much from the malt profile. The mouthfeel if very full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and an slick, oily texture that is almost slimy. I really don't like this mouthfeel.

4.97,16.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Poured as dark as night like 10W-30 motor oil w/ a thin ring of light brown carbonation on the outer edges of the brew. No lacing to speak of. The nose was of roasted coffee, chocolate, molasses, figs, plums, and charred fruit. The charred fruit in the middle was what amazed me the most - like it should not have been there, but fit perfectly! The taste was on point w/ the nose, coating the palate w/ charred fruits and sweetness up front, and finishing w/ Belgian dark chocolate and espresso beans. Imagine making a Black and Tan w/ an English Barleywine and a Russian Imperial Stout and you should be able to get an accurate picture of the taste of this brew. Mouthfeel? This was by far the chewiest brew I have ever sampled. Like the smoothest silky puree imaginable. Despite the chewiness and I mean chewiness, this brew tasted so amazing that like Lionel Ritchie says ""All Night Long!"" Well deserving of all the hype and accolades, this brew did not disappoint. Cheers to Three Floyds for this creation! I almost gave this brew a perfect score, and my tasing partner and I both agreed that this was as close to perfection and beer heaven as we had both been!

4.7,9.8,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Dark Lord has been such an amazing beer to follow over the years. The hype surrounding it, acquiring it, the fact that Dark Lord Day has become an annual pilgrimmage for me and my friends from all over the world, I have a hard time saying that this is not one of those charmed, magical beers that will always be considered among the greatest in the world. Due to such hype, it has also become a beer many love to hate. Regardless, when compared in class next to its peers it is a distinctive, singular example of Russian Imperial Stout. Is it overdone? Of course, when compared to Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout. Whereas, say World Wide Stout, it seems quite balanced. I personally love it, even in blind tastings...the rich, velvety mouthfeel makes me stop in wonder. This beer, though rarely makes it out of the beergeek circles. I love to see non-beergeek reactions to it. Especially, the wine crowd always finds it immediately delicious, if not at least incredibly intriguing. I have taken many notes on the Dark Lord in all its incarnations and read all the reviews, but nothing really prepares the uninitiated for its overwhelming power and weight. It makes the so-called ""big beers"" seem little. So, it is sentimental for me. A friend that I always anticipate the visit each year. In fact, a recent discussion I was involved in all agreed that Dark Lord should only be for Dark Lord Day. It has been sad to watch the Ebay phenomena. It was sad to see the behavior of those skipping lines last year and all the disappointment. You have to remind yourself, this is just beer. When I attend beer tastings, it almost always the first bottle popped and first bottle finished. If someone doesn't bring it, people remark that the ""big guns"" didn't come out. Dark Lord has become a cornerstone of the BA community. But what makes this so special that it receives this kind of adulation? That is the point of my review. 2008 is my favorite, followed by 2010, 2006, 2007, and in a distant last, 2009.","Steamhead","May 14, 2009"

The flavor is intensely coffee packed, dark chocolate laden, and fruit filled, while also being hoppy and pretty bitter. This stuff is just so thick, I can't even describe it. Definitely the thickest beer I've ever had. Honestly, the verdict is out on whether beer should even be this thick, but I have to give it a 5 just for accomplishing that. Definitely unique and intense stuff. It is hugely rich and sweet, yet seems to pull off a pretty good balancing act. Big thanks to Tom for pulling this out.

This beer was so much hyped, I was afraid I would be facing a letdown. But not at all. I could smell this beer all night. What a wonderful smell! Not fortunate to have a snifter in my beer glass collection yet, I poured the first half into a Samuel Smith pint glass and the remainder in a Sam Adams sensory glass. The pour went much better in the Samuel Smith pint glass as a nice two inch frothy head appeared there, while a smaller head formed on the beer poured into the SA sensory glass.. This is my introduction to Russian Imperial Stouts and what an introduction. First taste and I get a little alcohol burn from the 13.0 % ABV, but not as harsh as the 10.0 % ABV for a Bell's Hopslam. Go figure. Still, this beer might need six months to a year for aging -- but, really, who can wait that long. This is really a masterful brew from Three Floyds. Smell, for me, is the best part about this. I go back and forth, between glasses, to smell and find the best smells coming from the pint glass. Taste is something I cannot put into words. This is something you must experience for yourself. Believe the hype. I don't see the low ratings for this Three Floyds offering because it lives up to the hype for me, at least.

You get some deep brown and dark amber highlights in the glass. Seeing this in the glass just makes the mouth water. The liquid coats the glass but not as much as a Bourbon County Stout. A bourbon booze aroma comes out huge in the first sniff. The coffee notes are hidden by the chocolate and some dried fruits like plum and raspberry come out as it warms up. Very sweet and boozy all around. The alcohol hits you up front right away for a moment but then this dried fruit tartness washes it away. The sweet chocolate, molasses and vanilla quickly then take over the mouth. As it finishes there is a nice coffee bitter. But again in the taste the coffee isn't as pronounced as I was looking for, but don't get me wrong this is a complex and balanced beer.

The smell is a lot of raisin, lactose, burnt malt, seems sweet for an RIS. The taste is extremely complex. Alcohol, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, raisins, wood, smoke, again a little lactose. The mouthfeel may be the most remarkable feature of this beer. The viscosity is similar to whole milk.

5,16.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Pours a deep black profuse sludge as if the Dark Lord himself has awakened from a slumber of centuries past. Already I can smell the scent of deep roasted malts, coffee, smoked embers, and nutmeg. The lacing clinging to the walls of my glass, but sliding ever so smoothly into the depths of midnight, where light ceases and something a bit abnormal begins. The first sip; smooth, chewy and thick. Perhaps this Lord of Darkness plays well with others? A robust hit of roasted chocolate careens my palate confused as to what it wishes to unleash next. A rush of sweet molasses and plum forces its boldness upon my senses. As the ferocity of the sip hits my palate a hint of nutmeg and cherries sneaks in through the back with hops infused in the grain. A strong but short burst of burnt and smoked woodiness ends atop the alcohol, clearly there can be no more. But the taste lingers and finally rests into a roasted smoked chocolate embrace. It's enough to want to follow the Dark Lord into the underbelly, into the darkside, into the grave. And after sampling the elixir of this Demigod, I must pledge my loyalty to he who is the master of the blackest of nights, the overseer of the underworld of sludge, and the purveyor of all that is ""not normal"".

I do think it is perfectly drinkable in terms of its unique velvety texture and its impressive balance of complex flavors, always leaving you wanting another sip, and sad when it's all gone.

Possibly a hint of smoke mixes in as alcohol takes a turn before and during the finish that gives a nice warming feel but certainly not overpowering.

Leaves a lingering coffee, woody, semi-sweet chocolate aftertaste. This thing feels amazing on the tongue. Every thick, but smooth. Extremely drinkable for 13%. First taste of this was a punch in the face. Totally wasn't expecting what I got, but it turned out to be amazing. At first the flavors seemed puzzling, but fit very nicely together.

4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"2008 vintage courtesy of Session1979. Beer #1 served during the 'Motha of All Stout Tastings' on 4.17.09. Pours pitch black with the consistency of 10WD30 motor oil-a real glass coater. Pour reveals a thin, tan-colored head that quickly dissipates into a skim, with a tight band around the perimeter of the glass. A thick ring of lacing formed and was retained during the tasting. Nose suggests dark malts, molasses, caramel and chocolate. Taste follows nose, but dark fruit and brandy also comes out in the mouth. In terms of mouthfeel, this is the densest beer I've ever had. The first time I have ever experienced such a full-bodied beer. Minimal carbonation, silky, chewy and buttery, all at the same time; it's like drinking syrup. To say Dark Lord is a huge beer is an understatement, and it really defied my expectations. Alcohol was very will hidden, but this is definitely a sharer. Well shared amongst four friends.","Jwale73","Apr 18, 2009"
4.67,9.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Jett black pour, like motor oil or black syrup. Small brown lace forms for just a minute, then vanishes. Small oil pach lace remains in it's wake. Nose is full of sweet molasses, raisin, licorice, black currant fruits, mixed with charred malts and chocolate undertones. Very sweet aromas. Thick lush full on body. Huge roasted and charred malts lead in but not acrid in any way. Coffee, chocolate and burnt fruits follow thru mid palate. Small amount of bitterness on the end, with a spicy alcohol kick. This warms all the way down. Finish is long and complex, leaving a melange of coffee, roast, hops,dried fruits, and ethanol spice. A world class sipper for sure.","drunkmonk","Apr 17, 2009"

Personally, this one leans more towards my favorite 'Doubles'. The smell is aggressive and rich with a ton of depth and complexity. The sweet rich substantive characteristics of molasses, licorice and dark fruit dominate the nose and it is complimented by the full bodied, lightly carbonated, creamy yet almost oily character of the mouth feel in the way that it lingers appropriately. Full flavored, the taste is as complex and as deep as the nose. Molasses, licorice, roasted malt, ja-mocha and slightly fruity. A classic ""sipper", the 13% ABV is genuinely part of the experience, but somehow buried beneath the intensity of the flavors and textures. Seriously 'way beyond' my expectations.","jjayjaye","Apr 09, 2009"

Hops are detectible. The taste is instantly toffee. It's a nice intro because if you haven't heard about how huge this beer is the smell warned you that you're in for it. A splash of ripe fruit, dark raisins, and prunes then, like cat Vs train, it hits you. Thick, very thick molasses, huge roasted toffee, and a little hops with some coffee notes to help you through. It's an amazingly deep taste of dark fruit, however, you can also concentrate on the lighter toffee, coffee and hoppy notes to experience it in a completely different way. It's very rich and fades with a coffee tinge. The alcohol is dangerously undetectable. There is also a craft/homebrew feel to it. I'm not sure if that is coming through in the taste, the smell, or if my mind is simply projecting it. Extremely complex and quite remarkable. Per Matt it's ""scrumdiddlyumptious"" and I can hear the whistle fading in the distance...","jgap","Feb 20, 2009"

Even the sweeet elements have a slightly charred edge to them helping cut any cloying nature. Long, long finish and a thick, viscous, creamy mouthfeel. I truly enjoyed this experience.

I do like how the 05 and 06 vintage has been aging, they have a stronger coffee and dark chocolate flavor with a better harmony of flavors. The 08 was quite good fresh and should age well for at least 3 years before getting deeper soy sauce notes, a little is ok but too much of it turns into a mess of a beer which was the 07 in my opinion. There were some flavors I liked in the 07 but the initial flavors seemed out of sync. The 09 is also quite a syrupy, sweet, vanilla bomb.

Bottom of bottle has a chocolate syrup type sediment, which oddly enough, made an evil face in my glass, must be the Dark Lord himself. Smells of burnt embers, milk chocolate, baking cocoa, coffee, and dark fruits. Lots of flavors going on here. Taste starts off like a creamy chocolate milkshake with some black cherries and a touch of semi-sweet chocolate on top, but just as you're sitting down to a nice dessert milkshake, you're reminded that you're drinking pure evil, and with an assault of coffee and espresso, you're brought back to reality. Lots of heat as it comes to room temperature. Creamy and smooth, any fuller in body and it would break the glass. Only downside, the alcohol presence as it warms takes away from some of the taste. One of the best beers out there, and while some may say it's overhyped, it deserves its honors.

I don't think there is such a thing. It is the best RIS I have had, but I have not had Kate or Darkness or Black Albert.

For how wide the snifter is, the one finger dark tan head is very impressive although it does die down a bit quicker than I had hoped. Good, thick stickiness left on the sides after tilting the glass from side to side. First smell I get is mostly dark fruits. Big fig, raisin, and date aromas with a strong roasted barley background. Lots of molasses, caramel malt, and brown sugar sweetness in the nose as well. Unfortunately there is a fairly strong alcohol presence, but with all the other wonderful smells going on with this brew I can't complain. I was expecting more in terms of smokiness with this one, but the sweetness definitely dominates the nose overall. Well then, I guess the charred aspect comes into play with the flavor. Up front is a strong smokey sting combined with an almost raspberry like sweetness. Big dark chocolate malt and roasted barley midway through. There is a slight hop bite hidden, but noticable. Aftertaste is wood-like with a carmelized almond flavor, very pleasant. Huge thick and chewy mouthfeel, just how it should be. For how in your face the alcohol was in the nose, the lack of it on the tongue is quite nice. Damn good RIS, I look forward to seeing how it compares to Kate.","BeerTruth","Jan 04, 2008"

Aromas of dark chocolate covered cherries, tootsie rolls, burnt marshmallows, hint of black liquorish, booze and strong roasted malt. Big bold flavors of rich chocolate, coffee, dark cherries, burnt brown sugar, deep roasted malt, and a hint of booze. Very complex in taste. Mouth feel is thick and fudgey. Low carbonation. This dark brew is extremely dense and sticky. Coated my glass with a brownish film. A 22 oz serving was a bit much for me. Drinkability wasnt as good toward the end.

4.97,16.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Since I joined this site, this has always been the number one beer I have wanted to try. Now I finally have a bottle sitting in front of me thanks to akorsak. I was originally planning on opening this tomorrow night for new years, but since I will be working, now is good enough for me. Had some trouble peeling the silver wax from the top of the bottle. Once I finally pried the cap off, I poured it in to my Rapscallion sniffer glass at I would say slightly colder than cellar temperature. Comes out of the bottle very thick, and lush looking. Not much head to be spoken of, but there was a nice ring around the sides of the glass, and some beautiful red hues on the side. In the smell was a whole range of different aromas. The most dominant was rich fudge, then some slightly bitter coffee, some fruity alcohol notes, and a distinct raisin character. Taste had it all...Notes of port, cherries covered in dark chocolate, fudge, molasses, caramel, and a slight metallic twang in the finish. I was surprised to not find much coffee in the flavor, as I understand that they use coffee in this brew. Many reviews have stated that this beer is incredibly viscous and almost like motor oil. I would say it has more of a slick mouthfeel that coats the palate, and leaves a nice bitter, and like I mentioned before, somewhat metallic aftertaste. I liked the fact that this is a big stout, but not necessarily a meal in a bottle like many others. The drinkability on this one is what impressed me most of all. Where the fuck is the alcohol? I mean, I can feel it after having one small glass, but it is nowhere to be found in the flavor or body. That being said, this is dangerous stuff, as it goes down smooth and far too easy. Okay, so I guess my final verdict is that this is indeed the best beer I have had to date. Every iota of hype surrounding this beer is well deserved. Now all I have to do is convince a few of my friends to make the trek with me in the Spring to make it out to Dark Lord Day 08. Cheers and Happy New Year!","jamie2dope","Dec 30, 2007"

It was pitch black even against a light. It had just a tiny hint of head and that was gone in a blink of an eye. The aroma was strong on alcohol and dark fruits at first. Got some strong smoke after a couple minutes but then that faded into the back. By the end, alcohol was the most dominant. The taste was also dominated by alcohol. Very reminiscent of cough medicine. There was some sweetness at the start of each drink but then the alcohol overpowered it. I've had several RIS lately and really liked several but this one is too much. For me, they need to scale back the alcohol taste and add back in some more traditional RIS flavors. For me, this one is overhyped and not worth recommending unless you can easily get it.

The roasitness is met with a slight bitter cocoa nose that backs up the roastiness and lets it mellow slightly. The cocoa is chocolaty, but it's a really good bitter chocolate. Something I can find in good, good dark chocolate. It's definitely not as mellowed out yet, but still very very good. The dark fruit, like the ash taste comes out more and more with the bitter flavor ending on the tongue. Yet again, mouthfeel is great, silky smooth and wonderful.

Taste is rich chocolate and acrid coffee to starts, fruitiness in the middle that lingers, and then gives way to the alcohol character, which is remarkably built into the brew. The numbing of the tongue tells you that you drank something substantial, but the burn just isn't there. Nice.

Sweet malt and molasses, with a splash of hops, though they are fading, followed by port wine with a lingering soft roastiness. Vanilla seems to also join in the cornucopia of flavors, as well as others I'm sure I'm not able to name. Carbonation is very much on the low side; body is as thick as they come.

Smells like brandy, soy sauce, cherries, some yeast, hot chocolate. Quite complex and more fruity than anything else. Taste is just what i look for in a RIS. A complex mish-mash of flavors. Molten chocolate covered cherries, other dark berries, truffles, brandy, bourbon, vanilla. Finish has an alcohol warming and a slight coffee roastiness that's quite well blended. Excellent. Mouthfeel is thick, as advertised. I could drink this all the time but i can't for many many reasons. Yeah, its a freaking great beer, no joke.","aforbes10","May 18, 2007"

The flavor is darkly sweet and somewhat fruity, balanced more by the roasted grains than any hops bitterness. I knocked down the drinkablity not so much because of the beer itself (I expect a super-RIS to be quickly sating) but because of the decision to package this beer in 22 oz. bombers.

Aroma of honey and sweet malt is overwhelming and somewhat interesting. Taste is way sweeter then expected with some alcohol hint. Body is full and has a creamy and oily texture like I have never seen or tasted before. Low carbonation is to be expected but the alcohol really comes out and I didnt enjoy this part. Some subtle vanilla and roasted malt were noticeable but were for most part covered by sweetness which kind of got gross after half a glass. This beer kind of reminded me of Avery Meph with the dominating sweetness and alcohol.

An inch high whipped mocha head rises to the surface and sets up in the glass, clinging to it with an oily, almost bacon greasy ring. Damn, this is some crazy looking stuff. Aroma isnt over the top, but Im definitely picking up some big roasty malts, bittersweet chocolate and molasses . The coffee seems to hit more in the taste, along with some caramelized raisins, vanilla and rich maple syrup/molasses. Theres definitely a lot going on here. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and full bodied without next to zero hotness. An impressive stout for sure. Does it live up to the hype? Partially. But I think you can pick up some other impy stouts with 90% of the quality/characteristics of this one for far less $ and difficulty.

Taking over and coating it more and more with every sip. A very well put together beer that has many o flavors going on. Some very smooth chocolate and high end coffee.

It pours a sinister black color with absolutely no light coming through. The very minimal head falls to nothing. This one looks like darkness. The aroma is very nice, with a forceful dark fruity fig, a mild alcohol and a sweet chocolate all in excellent balance. The flavor is strong in the fruity fig with a coffee bitter and very mild chocolate in the aftertaste. As it sits on my tongue, the fruit hits again followed by a nice pine hop. Balance is fantastic. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth with no carbonation. It has a light syrupy character, but it is mild enough that it works well. Overall, this beer is very nice. It blows the 2006 out of the water, hands down. I'm excited to see the bottled version in a few months.","kmpitz2","Mar 03, 2007"

Sweet chocolate flavor hits the tongue first, followed by a apple wine like flavor that slowly grows and finishes slightly tangy, with some anise, some warming alcohol, and some coffee flavor. Every once in a while I get a strange fishy, somewhat salty aftertaste as well. The beer is very soft and silky smooth, the body at some points feels very heavy but at others feels medium.

Taste is just as complex as the smell, even more so. Rich dark chocolate and roasted coffee, more dark fruits, ripe cherries and figs, sweet molasses round out the bittering dark chocolate and malt flavors. Deliciously bitter aftertaste couples with an appreciative alcohol burn that comes and goes sip by sip, leaves one waiting for the next taste. Very quaffable brew, delectable and sinfully decadent. Mouthfeel is definitely full bodied as they come, heavy and viscous like used motor oil from a cold engine. Carbonation is practically nonexistent under the weight of this super-thick stout, just a light tingle present on the tongue.

Rich and full-bodied, this nectar was made for an almost agonizingly slow drink. Great array of flavors from malt, cocoa, espresso to bitter hops and peppery alcohol.

Alcohol is high enough to burn a little. The flavor is almost perfect, but there is just a little too much sweetness. A bitter roastiness comes in at the finish, but overall this is a sweet beer.

That's—that's like you're falling down a hill of flavor and then you climb it back up again, from the valley of the alcohol, into the sweet, and then into the bittersweet, and then into the wine.

Intense, and tasty. It's so sugary my lip stuck to the glass. There it goes again. It's a sipper, but that's a no brainer. Slick, but not too thick.

The labeling and packaging with the melted wax is a great presentation. The beer poured a dense midnight black color, just like motor oil, with a brown right around the ends of the glass. The aroma is toasted and a bit sweet, molasses. Very impressive nose. The taste has a nice tough of toasted, but not overly done, coffee and a powerful sweet taste. At times the sweetness was the dominant force in this one but this is still a very fine brew. With a bit of aging, I get this thing would mellow out a bit and would be even more impressive.","ggaughan","May 21, 2006"

Poured with a cascading head, loved watching it bubble up to the surface, a dark brown head sat atop, but fizzled away to nothing in very little time. The nose was strong in a cold, espresso smell, with dark chocolate, and alcohol soaked fruits. The initial flavor on the tongue is of dark roasted chocolate covered espresso beans, with a mild hop bite, alcohol follows the sips down the throat. After letting it warm up, more fruitiness comes into the picture, as you start to get an almost rum covered cherry flavor, a black cherry. After the beer became room temperature, the vanilla comes into play, and makes this beer extremely easy to drink. Last years was a bit easier on the palate to drink, but the complexities that made me put an additional half an hour into this beer makes me wonder at the possibilies of how this beer will taste with a few months put on it, or even another year or two.","HoboAGoGo","May 02, 2006"

The dark brown head was fairly dense, with plenty of fine bubbles, and produced some spotty lace. Decent retention too. Very malty and roasty aroma, backed up by some sharp chocolate and (relatively) mild hops. The flavour starts out with a dry roastiness and rich, chocolate sweetness that is balanced nicely by solid bitterness. Some sour cherry notes kick in part way through, followed by licorice and a slight acidity (seemingly due to the quantity of dark malts). This was a thick beer - and it looked viscous even during the pour. Excellent on the palate, very creamy, carbonation was a little on the low side, and it finished with a light warmth.

Burnt coffee, is what I taste first. Sweet roasted malts, molasses, dark chocolate and dark fruits come next. Very complex, but easy to drink for such a big beer. Big, rich, thick and creamy all descibe the mouthfeel. You really don't notice the alcohol, after a few sips. Another one of those beers that tastes better as it warms.

Nothing wrong with that, I expected like most other imperials stouts that the potent smell would be over the top. Maybe after a year or so it has been subdued. I'm smelling a very balanced roasted malt and sweet alcohol. But both are balanced with an awesome chocolate coco powder smell. Taste is fairly balanced. The outstanding flavor is a sweetness at the end, yeah thats right, the end. This is a very outstanding ""time line beer"" I mean in that over the 2 seconds each flavor comes and goes at it's intended time and doesnt step on the toes of the other flavors. Roasted malt, to alcohol, to hops, all very balanced and smooth, then comes the sweet chocolate back on the front of the tongue and another round of slightly bitter hops.

Bottle was shared with David and fellow BA Londonporter, which is a great way to share and talk about the brew.

Roasted coffee and chocolate aromas issue forth, along with plums, figs and a bit of smoke. The alcohol buried within is hidden fairly well but does come forward, particularly as it warms. Chocolate, coffee, molasses, and dark fruits greet the palate. Deliciously complex with its initial sweetness balanced by a dry and slightly bitter finish.

Close behind lurks cherries, dates, prunes and to a lesser extent, a tartness in the range of soy sauce, yeast, and earthiness. Taste brings about an abundance of flavors; most notibly chocolate covered cherries and bourbon balls. Others include bittersweet chocolate, coffee, prunes, dates, figs, berries, caramel, vanilla, cream, hops, and alcohol. These flavors are not what makes this beer great. What does is that it is aged to perfection. Flavors extend forever and reveal themselves constantly and subtlely because of its mellow maturity and the fusion of ingredients. I could drink a thousand of these and always find new flavors. Because of the maturation, this one isn't as thick or as heavy as expected, but not as abrasive either.

Impy stouts normally aren't all that carbonated and this was no exception but why put this claim on the bottle label?!?! Taste is mildly acrid with some burnt fruit flavors and maybe some coffee/mochachino flavors. The finish is acrid and burnt, not my definintion of flavorful.

Smells like coffee, with a slight slight alcohol underton, very roasty and you can smell the bitterness from the malts. The taste is like fine espresso, very nice and bitter coffee, the monster 13% ABV camoflaged in the flavour. Very roasty bitter and dry, and not very sweet like most imperial stouts I've had. The mouthfeel was insanely thick and coating, but this beer was very smooth and creamy for how big it is. I would not be able to drink a whole bottle but what I had was enough to know this is definately a world class beer, can't wait to open my other bottle.","Viggo","May 26, 2005"

5,16.8,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer pours a black so dark that I think it actually makes the room a little darker. It pours as thick as motor oil. The head is very dark brown. The head is very thick and creamy looking. It fades very slowly. I have been looking at it for about 5 minutes, and it still has almost the same amount of head as when I first filled the glass. It leaves laces so thick, I can not see through them. This beer smells strongly of alcohol. After the wave of alcohol, coffee aroma is present. It also smells strongly of roasted malts. Hints of chocolate are also present. As for hops, there is a slight aroma, but it is almost totally masked by stronger aromas. The first sip of this beer makes all the work, and expense I went to trying to get it all worth while. It tastes very strongly of coffee and chocolate. It is quite bitter, but very well balanced. It is very malty. The alcohol tates is a little harder to make out, but it warms my throat as it goes down. This beer is very thick and creamy. It is a very full bodied beer. It sits heavy on the palate, leaving a coffeelike aftertaste. Due to the rather high alcohol content, and the very aggressive flavor, this beer might not be the best session beer for some. I personally think I could drink it all night, or at least untill the alcohol got to me. I think this beer is amazing. I wish it was not so hard to come by. I would like to thank both goodbyeohio, and mentor for supplying me with this great beer. In a few months I will drink my other bottle and compare it. I just hope I can wait that long.","OStrungT","May 21, 2005"

4.65,8.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,4,"Well I have waited a long time to try this beer, and this brewery sure made me pay for it, but then Dreadnaught should have given me a clue. This beer poured dark as a black hole with no light penatrating it's heavy mass and just probably sucking it in. It formed a reverse cascading (aka Guiness) like foamy dark brown head that refused to leave and coated my Expedition snifter solidly with lace. The aroma was heavy on the malt, with sharp hits of expresso coffee, dark chocolate and and plums. The flavor was heavy malt, dark chocolate with a lighter touch of expresso coffee. The body on this this one is quite thick and creamy while the finish is bittersweet. The alcohol is well hidden and tends to finally make its apparence like a brick wall in the dark. This is a amazing brew, but I doubt I will pay for it again at it's current cost, considering I can get Expedition in my area cheaper.

The smell is rich and full of dark roasted malt with just a bit of sweetness. Even some dark fruit present. Lingering espresso as well. The taste is very intense. The amount of burnt malt that comes through at first is off the scale. It's fucking huge! Lots of coffee, chocolate, and candied plums.

This beer pours a darkest of dark color with a tall and thick brown (mocha) head that has great retention and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. Very attractive and also a bit daunting. The aroma is all about coffee. Lots and lots of coffee/expresso. Maybe a slightest hint of alcohol, but minimal. Some slight chocolate in there as well, but mostly coffee. The flavor kicks you in the face. Strong presence of coffee and chocolate with hints of dark fruit and molasses. Big, big taste. The body is huge. Tons and tons of body, but it manages to avoid the oily syrup feel (which is great). Soooo thick. Awesome. Just awesome. The alcohol is very well hidden in this darkness.

3.72,-13.1,4.5,2.5,4.5,4.5,3,"No sludge bottle. No head to cover this tar black oil body. Who cares about head anyway, lets not bother with such futile details. Restrained aroma, hypothesis that the huge body keeps it from expressing, but its still lacking in the department. You have to fight to get a not so exciting vinous alcohol nose, though you would never expect 13%. Slight fruity hints when warming, mild cocoa, even milder roastiness. Who cares about aroma anyway? Lets not bother with such futile details. There it comes, the palate baby, the mouthfeel! Heavy, oily, thicker than syrup, fuller than 35% cream, neglectable carbo is just fitting perfectly with that beast. Chocolate cream. Easily the thickest beer in the universe as I imagine it. Taste comprises of extreme molasses. Big honey/maple sweetness. Excessive sweetness in fact, this never aimed to be balance and it isnt. It remains rather sustained and with nice subtle nuance for a 13% beer with no in your face flavours, it just wants to be heavy. Well contained hoppiness (flower, herbs, grapefruit), chocolatey. It doesnt taste fully fermented ultimately, but again, this has to be an effect from the mouthfeel. It just tastes incredibly sweet and without much of the fruitiness Id like in an impy. Cloying finish, unique. 1 yr certainly did it good because as it is now, it tastes like malt syrup mixed with molasses. Extremely challenging and pleasant beer to try, but in small quantities.

4.85,13.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Black. There is not sissy hue to this beer. There is no color depth, just a soulless black tar abyss. When I held my glass to a light I played God and created an eclipse. The pour was impressive, it exited the bottle like motor oil after 6,000 miles. Even though a head didnt really form this beer is still awesome in appearance; only a few foamy pockets, like small islands of brunette bubbles, formed in the middle of the dark liquid. There was a thin collar too. No subsequent lacing. Even though this beer sat in by glass lifeless it still looked most daunting! Served a tickle warmer than cellar temperature. Even at this warmth the nose was a little standoffish for me. Now, with that said, the aromas that were presented were magical. There were huge roasty qualities that were perfectly rounded into form by a cornucopia of other smells. Im impressed there was just a trace of alcohol, incredible considering the lofty abv. I guest Three Floyds is *that* much better than Avery (but I knew that!). Fruits are deep, dark, tropical with raisins, dates, grapes, and caramel covered apples. Port wine. Brandy. Candied sugar that is burnt around the edges. Assertive hops with Pacific Northwest bloodlines. Acidic. Astringent. Weak hint of coffee. Molasses. Winey. Burnt. Freaking awesome! There is an amazing amount of depth; especially considering the potency is moderate. Inviting, duh. The first sip of this motherfucker brought moisture to my eyes. Goddamn, I needed a moment to compose my thoughts. I was hoping the beer would be good. I was praying it wouldnt be an alcoholic bomb. It wasnt. How could another Imperial Stout ever top this beer? It can. It is blasphemy to think otherwise. The palate is rich, chewy, and fairly sweet but far from cloying even though there seems to be about four types of sugar in the mix. Brown sugar and candied sugar just to name the most prevalent. Molasses. Burnt sugar. Toffee. Caramel apples. Hints of chocolate covered raisins. Figs. Assorted spices. Aggressive American hops bitterness that plays so gleefully with the astringency of the roast. Espresso. Soft acidity at the back that melts into some marmalade-like fruitiness, at the finish is the only warmth from the alcohol. Some spice too. The aftertaste has a clean ale/hoppy thing going on, all I can say is it reminds me of a Rogue beer. I dont know how to describe this feel but it is a good thing! Overall the palate is a gem. Perfection really. I love the hop burps too! Full bodied. Low carbonation. Thick, heavy but not sluggish mouthfeel, surprisingly smooth actually. Flawless. Amazing. I have had about a half dozen beers that have truly amazed me. Dark Lord is now added to the list. Is this the best Imperial Stout Ive ever had? Yes. Is it the best beer Ive ever had? Yes but it is tied with a couple others. It is truly amazing. Every sip was like suckling a Goddess teat. I wish I had about fifty bottles in the cellar but, alas, I had one bomber.

It is pitch black almost verging on sucking in all surrounding. The head starts impressively before falling into a cap of bubbles and leaving not lacing but a film over any portion of the glass that it comes in contact with. Aroma is of chocolate covered berries, molasses and roasted malts. The flavor is tremendous standing out much more than the scent with chocolate, roasted coffee and dark fruits blending for a complex palette experience. A slight coffee bitter aftertaste is also present as well as a slightly sour taste as it warmed. Mouthfeel is ridiculous I have had nothing as thick as this ever and it is amazing. It coats the entire mouth and sits heavy on the tongue, very nice. Drinkability is also excellent there is no sign of the 13% anywhere in this monster.

Had a bit of a brown head that didnt last very long. It smelled good but not much. It didnt give off enough of an aroma, that's why I had to dock points. It smelled a bit like fresh coffee, then old coffee, and slightly vinous. It tasted absolutely perfect! So much going on, and in such a great blend. Chocolate fudge syrup, roasted coffee, cherry wine, a hint of chocolate covered Belgian waffles that you get in Belgium, with an aftertaste thats similar to the aftertaste of strong coffee. Pretty sweet but too much so, with a bitter end. There really isn't more than a teeny hint of alcohol in the taste. I guess there's just too much other stuff going on. Mouthfeel is THICK. Well in the beginning of the bottle it is just regular syrupy thick, and as you get down to the bottom, well it almost gets to be too much. It's a bit ridiculous. Like pudding that's not quite set yet, real thick but still drinkable. I got the absolute end of the bottle and I really did have to chew. That was a little disturbing, but kind of cool at the same time. Drinkability, well, I know this is it now, but I want more, lots more! It's so drinkable.

Well, here we are about to break through the layer of red triple dipped wax to break the seal of the beastly brew. The bottle depicts in comic book fashion a demon possessed viking crushing skulls and what not, but either way I'm guessing he's the Dark Lord. Let's see what he has to offer my senses. Appearance on this one goes as follows, in the pour this maybe the thickest textured brew I have ever poured the addition of molasses may have something to do with that. Color spectrum yep it's dark simply engulfs all visible light waves leaves behind a resilient line of thin moccha tan head that with my first sip starts to leave trickles of lace. Aromatics contained in this nectar are deep thunderous colliding waves dark chocolate, wine like fruit notes arising from the trenches of this beer, along with an espresso barrel aged like finish hop presence is evident and as it warms this is even more so for 13%abv it's not burning any nose hairs, which is a good thing. If nothing else about this beer grabs ahold of you, the flavor is sure to. Massive unparalleled possibly brings another style about redefining the Imperial Stout category for me, brings huge staggering amount of slightly burnt dark roasted malts to the palate the molasses is evident with alcohol infused fruit namingly tart cherry notes screaming out while blending perfectly in this orgy of flavor. A definite strong coffe presence is welcoming and eye opening at the same time, just burped up a load of hops bringing about another wonderful aspect of this beer. Three Floyd's have done it again the Dreadnaught stands as my favorite Imperial IPA this may just take the throne as my all time favorite Imperial Stout. Mouthfeel is chewy yes a beer can be chewy, don't believe me try this one it says it all. Once again the molasses takes the reigns adding to this full bodied beers complexity on the palate tame carbonation wouldn't want it any other way, after pouring in the final yeast sediment from the bottle the texture becomes thicker which is hard to believe. Drinkability couldn't believe that a beer this massive could be so tasty and drinkable in a 22 ounce portion, I don't know what has me completely sold on this beer but it's amazing. Complex as all hell with a huge mouthfeel, aromatics are mesmorizing, and the taste is orchestrated to perfection.

3.76,-12.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"I must admit that with this intense fresh hop flavor, I am not sure that I want to hold on to the rest of these for a long time, though the 4 inches of sludge at the bottom of this bottle (even after a month of sitting) say that I need to move these to my lagering fridge for quite a bit. The fresh hop flavor is quite good right now, and it is so dominant that I can not even guess how this beer will continue to age. I have a feeling that in a year or two this will be a totally and unexpectedly different beer from what it is now. I have no doubt that the Dark Lord will age gracefully for the next 10 or even 20 years, but will it be better than it is now. Oh well only time will tell, I will just have to hang on to a couple over the years.","Gueuzedude","Apr 11, 2004"

4.11,-4,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Served on cask at The Map Room in Chicago. Perhaps the thickest beer I've ever sampled. Pitch black, wish I would have had a small flashlight to view with. Carbonation was nil, as was head, which was not unexpected.Smells of heavily roasted malt, hints of coffee and chocolate. Very sweet, I have a feeling the low carbonation of the cask really hid any hop bitterness that may have been there. Given the sweetness I experienced, was surprised to read here that this beer is 13% ABV. Little perceivable alcohol presence.","truthbrew","Mar 09, 2004"
4.36,1.9,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"OK, on to the Dark Lord. I had heard so many things about this one that I almost shit when I heared they had an aged growler of it for me to try. It poured a small head of dark brown fine to large sized bubbles. It has a mild coffee molasses aroma. The body of this brew is something to behold. It is dark, thick and I mean thick! 70,000 mile old motor oil thick and black as a black hole in space. It has a very strong coffee flavor that was suprisingly smooth initially then finished with a lingering burning sensation from the alcohol. It is definately in a class of its own! Truly a masterpiece! All hail the Dark Lord!","TheDM","Jul 27, 2003"
4.7,9.8,4,4,5,5,5,"Originally Sampled on 14 December 2002. This baby is thick, malty, w/ tastes of cocoa powder & chocolate on the palate. Dark Lord has a wonderfully soft mouthfeel. You can easily spend lots of time sipping this one. I just wish that Three Floyds would bottle it.","jcalabre","May 20, 2003"
4.78,11.7,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I write only to confirm that it is true. This beer is the reason I roadtripped down to Three Floyds around Christmas and I was not disappointed. This is by far the thickest, most viscous beer I have ever seen. To say it rivals motor oil is to speak truth. This is week old coffee, sludge -- delicious, malty sludge. Drinkable this beer may not be, at least beyond a few ounces. But those few ounces are a true marvel. I'm sure the flavors were wonderful -- but the mouthfeel is the main event here and all my mind will allow me to remember.","Andy","Jan 28, 2003"
4.9,14.5,5,5,5,5,4.5,"OIL, if you are looking for something thick, your can't get thicker than this. it is so thick it is chewy. over the holidays, my brother, our friend sue, and i took a short trip down to indiana from chicago to go to three floyds. good time. kinda weird atmosphere though, imagine snow outside and cold, everyone inside the brewery, not the brew pub or restaraunt, but the brewery in coat and hats and gloves, drinking great beer. self guided tour. fun indeed, but back to the beer. ok this beast was malt malt malt. hints of chocolate and carmel, but not much else. poured with amazing thick brown head that did not depleate at all. no alcohol flavor and the tiniest hint of hop bitter. the mouthfeel as i said before was like drinking oil. the only downside to this beer would be the drinkablity. i had two and was so worked out that i was ready for a nap. if you get a chance to have this amazing stout, DO NOT pass it up.","Myk","Jan 04, 2003"
5,16.8,5,5,5,5,5,"When poured into the glass from the big glass, it was black, black and powerful as the name, and thick like a bottle of 10W 40. When held up to a high intensity light I noticed that the black wasn’t actually black, but a blood brown black. Dense was the color. The head seemed to bubble up towards the end, like the dark lord rising from the black primordial beginnings, its color was a medium brown color, thick but not deep. As I stuck my finger into it to see if it was as sticky as it looked, I swear I felt a pulling sensation. It was sticky but left no lace on the side of the glass. The aroma was intense! I nosed cherries, sweet malt (molasses), tobacco (like skoal or coppenhagen), wichester sauce and as I stirred it, the alcohol peaked its nose up at me and whispered “I’m here too”. The taste was thick and creamy. If there was carbonation I missed it. Not flat, just thick. I noticed flavors of sweet molasses, spices, port wine, fruit (cherries) as it warmed I also noticed hints of chocolate and more cherries and alcohol. Like many beers of this type this only got better as it warmed, warmed from the fires it was born from, stirred and created from the Dark One himself. Truly one of the greatest brews made. I felt different after only consuming 2 ½ pints of this potion, different like I was possessed. The wife said that she was either going to call a priest for a exorcism or take me straight to church because of the look on my face. It was an experience all its own. Thank You 3 Floyds for this beer. Thank you","Jarod","Jan 02, 2003"
