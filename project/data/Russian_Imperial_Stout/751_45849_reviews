"Does everything well except hold a head."

"The barrel properties are prominent at first with woodsy oak and bourbon. The middle palate serves that barrel sweetness of coconut and vanilla while it ends with chocolate, caramel and toffee. This is truly decadent and absolutely delicious."

"Ultimately, I would place this in the upper echelon of barrel aged stouts, and that is really saying something, considering the fine examples of such I have already experienced and reviewed."

"O: I would certainly try this one again, and it is priced very well for being a huge bourbon barrel stout. I would hope the beer is carbonated next time which could really improve my scores on this one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, for as much as I anticipated this, I'm disappointed. This needs improvement in several areas. My other bottle will be happily donated to a friend who didn't get a bottle from the latest release, and here's hoping that future releases improve."
""

"The beer pours a rich (but relatively thin looking) black with a thin tan head that laces. The nose is fruity and boozy, some bourbon vanilla, and relatively little sweetness or chocolate. The same fruitiness is present in the taste, but with a bit more grain, caramel sweetness and tobacco-y bitterness to help round things out. The mouthfeel is fruity, medium bodied, slightly dry, has adequate carbonation and caramelized sugars competing against the potent, burning booziness. This is an interesting beer, great flavors without a thick body, and it really highlights the bourbon stout without making it tough to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full mouthfeel but a bit stickier on the finish than I would prefer but nice."
""
""
"Overall for a brew that is nearly 14% this is one of the easiest drinking high octane BBS that i have experienced. This is my first time trying it as i was never able to find it in the past. Glad i picked up two of them!"
"I would certainly drink this again, although we followed this beer with the Oak-Aged Yeti which costs about six bucks less and is a bit better, so for the price, this beer may not make the cut despite being damn good."
""
"With its balanced flavor profile and lighter bodied mouthfeel, this 2010 vintage of Ivan the Terrible may not have been one of the more extreme imperial stouts I have ever sampled, but it was tasty, drinkable and quite enjoyable nonetheless. I would love to see how the more recent vintages with higher ABVs compare to this."
""
"It may be slightly oxidized but is still enjoyable. A well made barrel aged stout from a small Montana brewery. An unexpected surprise."
""
""
""
""

"O: Very very solid. One of the richest and most potent out there. Very good."

"A friend picked this up from the brewery for me! An aggressive pour yields a pitch black body with a nice one finger caramel-colored head with decent retention and lacing. The nose is really nice with loads of cocoa and dark chocolate initially, and big bourbon notes as it warms. Also getting some wood, leather, and dark fruit. The taste follows the nose with tons of mocha and chocolate, perfectly complemented by some really nice roasty malt and oaky bourbon notes. As it warms the dark fruit emerges along with hints of brown bread, vanilla, espresso, leather, and tobacco. The mouthfeel is absolutely smooth as silk with minimal carbonation and a velvet finish. The 13.8% ABV is nowhere to be found. It's not boozey at all and there's almost no heat for such a big beer. The bourbon character is as close to perfect as I can remember in an Imperial Stout. Overall, this is a huge and pleasant surprise. This beer is every bit as good as any of the big names in this category. My first beer from Big Sky, but not my last! A really impressive offering!!!"

"one of the most unique Russian imperials out there, worth the hype. this one has the feel of a light and delicate porter, the most well hidden abv ive seen in years. dark and creamy pour, Hershey brown with all kinds of lacey cream head. lots of appeal and character. smoky smell a little bit, plenty of cocoa and dark malt, but a lightness to it that defies the style. semisweet taste, like the tollhouse chips, less bitter, but equally mild. complexity is not lacking, but neither is drinkability, which I think is what makes this stout special. how can a beer seem so light, so easy down, and so basic, but yet so decadent and rich and impressive. its a balancing act here between huge beer and every day drink, in a way that nobody else has really achieved. a special brew to say the least. the lightness of this will blow your mind, and when you realize its 10% abv plus, you will simply be floored. I was, and it takes a lot to do that to me these days. on tap at hops and pie for a very fair price too."
""
"O-This is a well-balanced and drinkable RIS. The alcohol is integrated nicely and the balance of flavors is pretty impressive. In a world of barrel-aged this and coffee-infused that, it is nice to drink a beer like this every now and again to remind you that an RIS that is put together correctly can be a pleasure to drink."

"O: solid bourbon barrel aged stout and thoroughly enjoyable. Cannot thank Match1112 enough for this one. truly a terrific BA."

"O: Everything a stout should be and more. This one rang the bell. Got even better as it warmed. Sip slowly and be awed. Terribly good."

"O: Really nice beer. I'd drink this again if given the opportunity."
""
""
"Finally getting to try some Ivan the Terrible, and, surprise to me, it's at South Loop's little in-house bar. Gotta love having days off during the week, right? This stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a small finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises chocolate powder, roasted malts, a hint of molasses, and a kiss of coffee. Straight impy stout fumes here, people. The taste brings in more of the same, with the chocolate taking more of a syrup character and some very mild bourbon peeking in at times. The body is a straight medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, though a touch thin (we're not talking Eclipse-style thinness, but it definitely ain't chewy), this is a solid impy stout. It's not quite as great as it's been advertised over the years, but I'd glady have more if given the opportunity."

"O: very good BA stout but I think that this could use some more aging. Not in the same league as Parabola, Abyss, BCBS, etc. but still quite good."

"Poured into a snifter, really smooth chocolate, rich oak, and plenty of bourbon boozy taste. I love this beer from big sky its hard to find bombers of stuff in Illinois. My first review so sorry if its unorganized. Overall a good bourbon imperial stout I would definitely recommend to others. I would say its comparable to our goose island bcs."

"O: Excellent fantastic RIS. Creamy and smooth that's not over powering on the wood or the Bourbon. Overall one of the best RIS on the market and nice random find for me in the store. Going back to see if I can snag another bottle!"

"This is a top notch bourbon barrel beer. Big Sky, with their ipa, trout slayer, slow elk, cowboy coffee and Ivan are all underappreciated beers. Now their kriek, ugh, that's an abomination, but you gotta like those odds!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - If I had to chose between this and say a BCS or a KBS, I would take those every time. But, this was a unique barrel aged imperial stout with a nice mouth feel and nose, so if you're a fan of the style and you see one, I would check it out."

"O- good RIS. Not a ton of barrel characteristics which is why I didn't rate it higher, but nice dark fruit notes that add some complexity to this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome RIS. Huge variety of flavors making this one very complex. Surprisingly good balance of flavors though the bourbon and chocolate dominate overall - which I don't mind. Quite fresh and boozy, bordering on harsh but what do you expect from a just-bottled 12.2% bourbon barreled RIS? I bet this would be amazing if it mellowed for a few years in the basement. Not to say that it's not already amazing, it's just the nature of the beast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: definitely good as I thought it was going to be, a bit surprised on the tobacco character in it but it was still very good. Finally conquered this elusive beer."
""
""
""
"Hot damn. Fantastic."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with light lactose and deep creamy black chocolate note is pretty much perfect. Light bourbon and vanilla notes are also perceptible. Taste is pretty much a perfect mix between some bourbon with creamy black chocolate notes, light lactose and light dry roasted malt notes. Body is full with perfect nice creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Wow, what a surprise this one was with perfect balance and not too much barrel-aging."
""
"O: Overall just not as impressive as I remember this 2010 version being. Still a solid BA stout but nothing earth-shattering here now."
"O: This drank like it was 8%. So incredibly smooth and velvety with just the right amount of carbonation. The barrel flavors were definitely on the light side which added to the drinkability obviously. I'd like to know how many months this spent in the barrel, but either way it was a flavorful and had just enough restraint in the booze department to make it very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark, charred, ashy all around. The barrels take a backseat which is somewhat disappointing. Some vanilla, yeah; but not nearly as creamy and sweet as I hoped/wanted it to be. Medium to high carbonation on a medium body. Good but definitely not great in my humble opinion."
""
"An excellent stout. Wonderfully creamy and complex. Nice chocolate and malt flavours. Well integrated oak. It has been a while since I've had a nice Bourbon Barrelled Stout and I'm loving it."
""
""
"Excellent RIS. Impressively approachable, in contrast with the more hulking RISs (not that I'm at all averse to them). Feels a little ironic to rate this highly for being unlike what I expect from a RIS, but whatever. A great beer, only lacks the high-end wow-factor."
"O: Very good. Another superior BBA RIS. I enjoyed a second one! Dangerously drinkable."
""
""
"Overall: I wish I could get a hold of this, as I would love to start a vertical. Great smell, better tastes, solid, super solid, body makes for a great drinking experience; would be an excellent dessert accompaniment or as a dessert on its own; the ABV and weight make it a sipper, but with as much as it has going for it, I'll sip it all night long and into the morning."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Lucifer snifter. Pours a dark, dark black with a chocolate colored head and nice lacing. Delicious bourbon and toasted malt aroma with a hint of chocolate. Intense oak and bourbon and dark and toasted malts. Vanilla, coffee and more oak middle and finish. Kinda boozy, which which lowers the score and should improve with aging. Medium bodied with some creaminess. On second taste, the alcohol is so firey and overwhelming, I down graded this one by a point. I hope it mellows with age. The positive elements are excellent, but it's covered with a pure alcohol burn. 2012 update: I was lucky enough to stumble on a fresh bottle of the current Ivan. The aroma and taste is similar, but the booziness noted in the earlier review is well covered by the flavor in this version. A nicely balanced and well made RIS, that I will revisit whenever it's made; score for taste adjusted upward."
"D - overall, this is a pretty nice barrel aged RIS. Personally, I think this is a nice example of barrel aged beer, however due to the bottle count being low I think this demands a little more than its worth. That being sad, I am glad I landed a bottle and would try to get again off the shelf if the opportunity presents itself in the future."
"Poured into tulip, served at Binnys south loop. Apperance is inky black with dark brown head. Opaque. The nose is full of rich chocolate and delicate vanilla. The bourbon is much tamer than the bottled version, mellow vanilla with sturdy oak coming through. Taste is full of rich dark chocolate and mellow vanilla. The mouthfeel is hefty with mild carbonation. Overall, the tap version is a step down from the bottled version, the barrel character is tough to pick up. Great stout nonetheless."
"O: Really nice, but I wish the barrel character gave a little more bourbon/vanilla rather than just solid oak."
"overall: solid stuff - but not something to shell out high dollar for a 750"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good bourbon barrel stout, perfect for a rainy Seattle evening. Maybe a little uneven, unbalanced. The strong bourbon taste could have used the counterbalance of an even darker, roastier malt. Still, very tasty, definitely a sipper. Think I'll age my other bottle for a while, see what develops."
""
""
"D-this is a delicious RIS with a good complexity. the oak is done well, present but not dominant. tons of roasted malty goodness with a nice light sweetness in the back. great feel and good carb, not too heavy but definitely big."
"O - Very enjoyable. This doesn't hit you over the head with anything, but is a well integrated bourbon barrel aged stout. Glad I got to try this."
"O: This is classic American RIS to a T. Very well made, not mind-blowing, but I can see why it's highly regarded."
""
"O – This was a great beer. As it warmed up it got even better. I can’t believe it but I can confidently say my first 10oz pour of this beer catapulted it into my top 10. Will definitely be seeking it out to try in the future. 4.5"
"Highly recommended brew! One of the most underrated stouts I've had. Awesome! It could be thicker, but it would lose some of it's appeal, it's a great afternoon drinker."

"Pours black as black with a shout of flowing bourbon aroma. Nice fizzy dark tan head stays put. Initially notice a deep aroma of milk chocolate and cocoa. This baby is showing big promise. Wood, bourbon, vinegar and dark fruits (plums, raisins, grapes) are also noticed. Tastes big and malty with a profound dark fruitiness, oak, spice and weak black coffee. Big and boozy but smooth as silk. One of the best beers have had in a very long time, and now I wish I wouldn't have opened it, but hey, somehow I feel there are more great beers to be had."
""
""
"O: Fantastic brew that I will definitely be seeking again in the future."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, wood, vanilla, and bourbon. Taste with the same with a woody finish and a slight alcohol kick with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barrel aged stout but I like the way it smells more than the taste."
"The American Stout signatures of dryness and hops are well displayed, but the smooth chocolate and milky taste and textures work wonderfully in this beer. The 65 ibus are kept in check by the wonderfully varying malt flavors for ultimate complexity and roundness."
"O - All things considered this one is very good. It has plenty of flavor, good overall balance and is pretty easy to drink. One of the better stouts I have had on the day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had a couple very good BA stouts lately, and this may be the best. Just incredible flavor profile kept hitting with different aspects of it's complex profile. Flavors are well integrated and balanced, wish I could get more."
"O: I don't know what happened with the feel of this beer, but it really took away from the entirety of the experience. If you can look past it's flaws, Ivan's an above average BA RIS. Here's to hoping that the later vintages have better quality control and balance."
""
"The body of this beer is actually a touch lighter than I would have liked; more malt richness would have supported the Bourbon Barrel notes better (despite the Bourbon character really not being over the top in this beer). Not bad, but I wish it was a touch richer and maltier."
""
"Overall I thought it had some really great flavors to it. The bold chocolate was complimented very well with the bourbon and vanilla. The thin mouthfeel and lower carbonation hurts it some, but overall I thought it was a very smooth and flavorful beer."

"O - An excellent RIS that is drinking perfectly with two years of age on it. I'm glad I waited to review this one until now, because this one surpassed my expectations. Recommend!"
"D - A very well-executed barrel-aged Imperial Stout. I'm glad I have a bottle of this specific vintage as it seems to be in peak form right now. Reminds me of the best BCS vintages a bit. Really easy to drink, and one of the few beers of this ilk that belongs in a 750ml bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm really enjoying how well the bourbon plays off the sweetness of the beer. I would dare to call this a good introductory bourbon aged stout because it doesn't punch you in the face like some do (which isn't a bad thing either). I was very pleased with this offering from Big Sky and look forward to it in the future."

"Overall: I really loved this beer! Great barrel aged stout that lives the hype! It is unique and memorable because of the smooth taste, nice mouthfeel from the moderate carbonation, and great complexity. This beer has aged well and is drinking fantastically right now. I was wowed by this beer!"
"Overall: This is a really nice beer. It held up well against several of the more hyped offerings we opened up. The sweetness and vanilla notes were just at the right level. I would definitely have another."
""
"This is a medium to full bodied brew that really boasts a lively level of carbonation. It flirts with having just a bit too much fizz in the mouth. If you try to swirl it around, it quickly turns to nothing but froth in the mouth. Luckily, I would rather have it over-carbed than under since some swirling can help ease the bubbles out of solution. Regardless, this was a solid brew. It is something I would certainly enjoy again. Really no complaints here other than it really focuses a lot on the dark fruity aspects which I think for my taste was a bit much. The alcohol is masterfully integrated for 10%. It is there totally in flavor but does not carry with it the expected burn. Really well done offering."
""
""
""
""
"Full body, decent carbonation, sticky and chewy on the mouth. A damn good barrel aged stout, I hope I get to try this again sometime soon."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is definitely top 5 Stouts/Barrel-aged stouts I have ever had. This beer is once again a winner for me because it fits the criteria that I love which is balance. The barrel doesn't overpower but is definitely still a strong presence. The drinkability is off the charts in that I could finish the whole 750ml if I wanted/had to. Highly recommended and worth seeking out."
"We cracked open a 2010 vintage bottle (limited edition #3087 of 3800) poured into a tulip glass. What a special treat! Poured dark black-brown with a frothy medium creamy off-white head with sticky lacing that lasted throughout. The aroma and flavor balances well between esters of dried fruit and roasted cocoa with a slight oaky bourbon presence. There was subtle coffee notes throughout and some alcohol heat. Some vanilla was detected. Smooth and silky bodied beer with a nice finish. Excellent brew!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer but it did not rock my world. I was actually expecting a little more flavor from this beer. At the same time, it does a decent job of hiding its 10% status... no easy feet!"
"o - overall, very solid imperial stout. this is a tough night for this beer to be a standout, but on another night with a clear palette i might have felt more highly about this one. don't get me wrong, great beer, but in an evening of kate, bt, hunah, cbs, etc this beer was towards the bottom of the list of favs."
""
""
""
"A truly wonderful example, and nearly perfect within style. This was the only beer I sought out multiple times during the Stone Pour It Black event. If I had known better, I would have had less Mikkeller and more Ivan the Terrible, that's for sure!"

"Big thanks to jedwards for breaking this one out. 750ml bottle. 2009 vintage, bottle 2264 of 3000. Pours an inky black with a quarter inch, khaki-colored head embedded with ringlets. Head eventually settles into a creamy cap; arcs and spots of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Great nose - dark malt dominates; however, buttery bourbon notes are revealed as the brew warms. The flavor profile really opens up as the glass warmed between my hands - milk chocolate, a little wood, brown sugar and a slight roasted/charred character. Mouthfeel is medium-light, albeit a bit thin, with an easy, even carbonation. There's also a slight acidic tang as well as some residual heat. Overall, this is an exceptional RIS with a great balance. I actually think this beer might be better with a little less time on it, but age didn't really negatively impact it as whole."
"O: a very good beer. This beer was better than I expected. The bourbon is present, but not overwhelming. It still tastes like a stout after the barrel treatment. I love the body of this beer, too. It's creamy, but has a surprising amount of carbonation that somehow works very well with everything else. Definitely one of the better bbal beers out there."
"overall: way above par."
"Overall - Disappointing, considering the ratings. Tastes good, but not up to the standards of the best stouts. Either other reviewers are tasting other flavors I'm missing or they're tasting the bottle count."
"Decent at best, I think I'd prefer a Palo Santo on all fronts."
"O: Good beer. I've had it at tastings, as well as by itself, and it holds up fairly well either way even against some stronger RIS."
"O- Myself and person I shared with thought this was an overhyped disappointment. Not disgusting, but not something I will actively seek out again..."
"Pour black into my tulip glass. Good carbonation, and excellent lacing on this beer. Very dark and impossible to see through. Very good looking RIS. Nose is that of bourbon, vanilla, oak, roasted malt, coffee, some hops in the background. Taste is the same profile as the nose, with the bourbon really coming out as the beer warms. Fantastic tasting brew! Feel is on the smooth/creamy side for the style, but still amazing. Overall, this is an amazing beer- glad I got to try it."
"O - The cork broke while opening so I had to use a wine opener, it made me nervouse, but all is good. A wonderful RIS, and I hope to score more in the future."
"O: I don't say this too much about a brew of this style and octane, but given the rather light and fluffy nature of this one, I could honestly drink an entire bottle of this stuff. I will most certainly have Ivan again...."
"Appearance is great. Still a nice, thick, creamy head. Good legs, issue is that the color could pour a bit more black. The aroma difference is that the malts seem to be a bit more aggressive than the last review. Based on my previous description of the taste, it should have been a 4.0. The current taste shows some bready malts mixed with the dark fruit, vanilla, light oak on the finish. I taste a little cork, which may be my fault for laying it down. There is no booze. It is incredibly smooth and pleasant. It is a 4.5 at this point. Mouthfeel has improved as well. Thicker feel on the palate. Upgrade to 4.0 going on 4.5. Overall, it is just shy of a 4.5. Updated review would be 4.5/4.0/4.5/4.0/4.0."
"O: This is really a top-tier example of the style."
"2 years seems to be the sweet spot for aging Ivans - at least for me. I plan to continue to stock this beer in my cellar."
"The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and coating."
"Drink- Overall, Ivan crushed it. This was a very good beer with well rounded flavors and a great bourbon/oak touch. I waited a while to have this one and it didn't disappoint at all. Would love to get another bottle."
"O: Damn good. Drinkable and balanced while also being full-flavored. Not as much of a bite as I'd like, but that's a matter of preference. I'd highly recommend this to anyone."
"Ivan the Terrible? Ivan the Awesome more like."
"Overall: One heck of a barrel-aged imperial stout! The coconut notes are wonderful. The beer is smooth with fruity sweetness, and overall complexity from the both the beer itself, and from the oak barrels. Very highly recommended!"
"O- Very impressed, I’ve been holding onto this beer for a while and finally decided enough was enough. Really enjoyed this now I only wish I would of opened this with a friend to share the goodness."
"Aroma is a pretty awesome chocolate and bourbon mash up. Flavor is also a nicely bourbon barrel influenced stout. Much better than the last incarnation I had and for $12.99 this is kind of a deal given the way pricing has gone."
"-GFunk"
"Mouthfeel/Overall: The body really disappoints me. Pretty light....high carbonation. A far cry from creamy and full. It does improve somewhat as it warms, but it's still below average. Overall this beer is on the cusp of something great, but not quite there. I really liked the barrel treatment, and the dark fruit notes were quite different and refreshing. Definitely a must try, but not quite world class. I wish I had access to previous versions, but I guess I'll have another shot at it next year."
"O: A bit of a let down based on the hype. Its good, but the fruit flavor and wine like qualities aren't typically what I am looking for in the style. Would love to try it again to see if there was just something a little off about this bottle."
"In comparison to other Russian Imperial Stouts, this is definitely a good one but it doesn't match up to other breweries. The beer itself had a weird combination of roast, wood and fruit that I think perhaps was unintentional but it definitely came through big."
"Overall, this is a fine stout that makes me really happy to be moving to Missoula soon."
"O- A very solid brew that I'd recommend to everyone to try, and can't wait to try it again myself."
"I had this at a recent store tasting, a 2011 batch into a small plastic cup. After a couple swirls the sides have a sheen on them like a coating of oil. The aroma is stong, smells of bourbon and oak dominate. The color is dark black with a small amount of tan / carmel colored head. Even a sampler is a sipper. Roasted malt, hints of chocolate and vanilla, but the bourbon and oak dominate, can't say much about the hops, and the alcohol is noticed at the end. This is one heck of an RIS, and from what I've tasted should be right up there with the best of them, and considering it's limited production, I'm surprised it's not, although maybe that's why too since it's hard to get."
"Smells bourbony and chocolatey. There is a wonderful sweetness on the nose and the tongue. Vry wonderful dark chocolate on the tongue, a subtle bitterness with some vanilla and a nice subtle oak."
"The complexity of the flavor sort of overshadows the texture of this beer, and I find it a bit too thick for the balance. A phenomenal brew overall, as one might gather from my rambling earlier. I hope to be able to try this one again, because it is awesome."
"It's a decent example of the style. Received it in a trade and it's been sitting in my fridge for months. Not bad."
"Overall this is one that lived up to the hype. I'd love to try this again sometime."
"O - This is a great beer, 'nuff said."
"Bottle. From the latest release. Poured into a snifter glass a dark brown/black color with a thin light tan head. The aroma is made up of the usual IS characteristics of; dark chocolate, molasses, a touch of leather, and some oak earthiness. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Sweet vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, and dark fruit round out the flavors. Very smooth and balanced is the best that I can describe this. It didn’t necessarily stand out in a bad or good way with all the other beers we tried this night. Just a solid well done IS."
"O-Another great barrel aged beer. Glad I got the chance to try this one. Fresh it was a tad hot bourbon did not dominate but was stronger, the '10 had mellowed out and thus had perfect balance."
"The mouth is weaker than I'd have hoped for such a big beer. Thin at times, and the carbonation becomes a little spritzy in the absence of a full body. I'd love this one to be a bit heavier. The bourbon is wonderfully integrated in this beer. Sweet vanilla tannins washed out with bitter dark chocolate and heavy roasted malts. Booze character is mild here. Surprising really. Wonderfully executed. I really dig this beer. A bit thicker and this one is one of the best."
"Had this beer at a recent tasting. This beer pours a dark black color with a decent tan head. the smell is roasty with hiints of bourbon and chocolate. the taste was fairly disappointing as the bourbon was barely there, and there was an off flavor that I could not put my finger on. the mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with good carbonation. overall I was not as impressed with this beer as i was expecting."
"Small sample at Hill farmstead gathering. I really liked this stout. The usual american imperial stout (chocolate, coffee and hops) but there was an awesome malt fruity profile (blackberry, plums, figs and dark cherries). Full bodied and solid overall."
"O: Ivan has always been a well received beer on BA, but I never thought it’d be nearly as good as it was. Incredible balance, the flavors complement each other perfectly, and the barrel aging is subtle yet adds an incredible depth that I’ve never experienced with any other beer. Unbelievably good. I personally couldn’t care what this one looked and smelled like after tasting it."
"O- Nice deep range of flavors. Great balance as well. It's sweet, but with enough bitterness to balance it out. Very active carbonation, which I found to be a plus. The alcohol becomes more assertive as it warms up. An excellent beer all around. Easily one of my favorites."
"O - Certainly a quality beer. This review was for a 2010 vintage and this was bottle number 2250 out of just 3800 so Ivan is not abundantly available to all. I'm glad I had this and was by no means disappointed... it's just not that common of a beer and so for the difficulty in obtaining I'm not necessarily wanting to spend the effort/costs in obtaining another one. For all that ""want"" this beer I suggest in continuing your search for landing it as it was certainly worth having, but don't expect to be floored by it as many RISs out there are equally as good."
"But don't let the Russians see this. I told them it was exceptional (and truthfully, it kind of is...)"
"Poured into a Bruery snifter. I'll comment on the appearance at the end. Smell is dark fruit, roasted malts, vanilla, oak, and a touch of coffee/chocolate. The flavor is the big combination of the dark fruit, bourbon and the roasted flavor of the malts and coffee. Lesser so is the specific vanilla and oak. The nose and the flavor come together pretty well to make a quite nice -bal imperial stout. The mouthfeel and appearance will be bundled together in failure. Slurping its way out of the bottle was something that could be best described as a beer oyster, plopping its way into the glass. The shape and texture were of an oyster, with a brownish color. After snagging and poking this thing, I decided to give it a taste - sugarless chocolate and bland cocoa, basically. It was really gross to see this thing plop into a glass and it was relieving to find out that it was an ingredient in the beer and not something else. Either way, it is impossible to positively rank the mouthfeel and appearance given the cocoa oyster we received."
"Poured into an imperial nonic near jet black,you had to hold it up to bright light to get a little ruddy hue at the bottom of the glass to get thru the pitch blackness.Toasted bourbon barrel hits upfront in the nose than some vanilla and alcohol dipped dark fruit,the roast is a bit subdued but its rich in the nose.Toasty with big bourbon notes on the palate but it doesnt overpower,lingering dark fruit and dark roast coffee does show thru.A little sharp in the mouthfeel,this beer would be off the charts with a fuller feel.A really good if not great imperial stout,so close...so close."
"A highly recomended stout. Actually very easy to drink. Thanks a bunch Jeff for sharing this beer with me."
"O- This beer was a beast. By the end of the my part of the beer it seemed like my palate was hurting. A little more lively carbonation would have done wonders for this beer. The ABV does show a little in the front of the beer and by the ending it was crushing. The alcohol heat warmed the belly making this beer a nice wintertime drink. I will be looking for this beer in the future but want to make sure I let this one sit a bit before cracking open."
"Moderate carbonation and a thick, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Sweet molasses up front followed by vanilla bourbon notes and slightly bitter dark cocoa and licorice on the finish. Reminded me quite a bit of The Abyss from Deschutes (which is not a bad thing!) with just a little more sweetness. Maybe not as complex as some other imperial stouts, but really enjoyable nonetheless."
"Overall this is a pretty good RIS, not the best I've ever had, and the bourbon might have been a bit much for the style but still a great beer overall though."
"Had during a recent Goose Island Bourbon County Tasting in Charlotte with marine1975, boodingo, CarolinaKevin, HopDiggityDawg, and GehenHerzog at Mike Brawley's house with Budweiser sign blazing! Big thanks to GehenHerzog for sharing this one with the group as a supplement to the Bourbon County series! Served from bottle into a Southern Tier tulip. Poured pitch black with a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, wood, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice RIS. Seemed to fit right in with the Bourbon Counties we were sampling that night. Big alcohol up-front but mellowed out upon warming slightly. I wouldn't call this one easy drinking due to this but still quite enjoyable. This one had a bottle number and I didn't write it down!?!? Ahhh!!! Maybe that's why I couldn't tasty any rarity in this one. Oh well, maybe next time... This one is a definite must try if you haven't had it and worth seeking out. Glad I got to tick this one."
"O- A very solid brew that I'd recommend to everyone to try."
"d: a sipper but actually quite easy to drink keeps your interest through; glad I got to try this. Solid brew."
"Bottle pours pitch black with tan head. Aroma is vanilla, wood, roasty malts, and bourbon. Flavors followed the nose exactly. More wood, roasty malt, some espresso, bourbon, vanilla. Smooth roasty malts balanced nicely with vanilla and bourbon. Thick brew. I really liked this one."
"D- Cliche: dangerously drinkable. Not too thick as to slow you down while enjoying a bottle to yourself, this is something that I could drink several bottles of throughout a dark winter night!"
"Pours black with a small light head that leaves some lace. The aroma is cocoa and raw roasted grain with some apple and a bit of bourbon. The flavor is roasty and plenty bitter with some dark fruit and woody tones. The bourbon and vanilla are well featured but not overdone, which makes this a pretty nice version of a bourboned RIS."
"(D)- A very easy drinking and enjoyable stout. Rich and sweet, but carries a nice smoothness as well. Good stuff. Will look forward to see what time will do to this."
"2010 Vintage Bottle 1767 of 3800. Thanks to my buddy Phil for sharing this. Pours a lovely black color with hints of dark brown when held up to light. Medium sized tannish brown had that disappears quickly. Scent is heavy with dark fruits, bourbon, and chocolate. Smells absolutely amazing. Taste is just like the nose would lead me to believe. I was not disappointed in the slightest bit. Lovely complex blend of dark fruit, chocolate, oak, vanilla, and bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth...creamy. Drinkability is high on this one. I have one in my cellar, and not sure if I should age it much longer considering how well it's drinking right now."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable beer, it is a shame this is only released in small quantities."
"Overall great beer and only complaint is I wish it had a thicker body."
"Drink and overall: Overall? Awesome! Drinkable? You bet. 10% ABV is not apparent, and actually suits this RIS very well. I would HIGHLY recommend this beer to anyone, but it seems as though these are hard to come by. We were lucky to find two bottles."
"Drinkability is good. Even with the higher than normal carbonation for the style and messy finish, I'm still enjoying the glass in front of me. Gets fairly quaffable as the carbonation drops off and it rises to room temp. Ivan is better than the average BA RIS, but their are others that are still another level or two above this. Worth checking out if you like the style and have easy access to it."
"I wish I had more of this. So much more."
"D: Hmm, wasnt all I hoped for but not terrible. Did anyone else seem to get a infected bottle? Everyone at the small tasting I had agreed that it was infected in the nose especially, though it didnt seem to affect the taste."
"Drink is decent, drinks well, a bit creamy and a bit sticky, and light booze."
"This was a 2010 bottle poured in my favorite Duvel tulip. Recommend this beer - hands down a new favorite."
"Side note: toughest cage to get off ever...it was wound so damn tight I hurt my fingers getting it off."
"D: This beer is outstanding. I can't see the beer having better presence beyond being fresh. I have about a case sitting around the house - I've already traded too much of it away. This beer is outstanding."
"Thanks Bill for the chance to try this one. Poured from a 750ml bottle into a oint glass at room temp. Pours dark brown, near black with atan head. Nose is roasty with some very faint barrel notes. Needs more barrels. Medium body. Not quite what I was expecting, but a decent stout."
"The reveal: Big Sky Ivan the Terrible!! Sick! I wasnt really thinking stout, its so sweet and fruity. This is bottle 3554/3800."
"D-- Well tempered is all I can say. The aging of this has made this an excellent BA beer. Still get the tones of the bourbon but much more subdued and a lot of other flavors come out. Feel guilty opening this up! Only flashes of the ABV but otherwise well hidden. Good body and good character. Have to show a lot of patience in cellaring the 2010 version!!"
"My first beer from big sky brewing but i can say it wont be my last. Great job and excellant beer."
"Overall I am very impressed with this beer. Sweet and chocolatty, nice wood and barrel flavor"
"2010- Black as satan's heart, impenetrable crude. The oak is on top of the smell, followed by the malt. First taste is the oak balanced with a coffee flavor. This is followed by chocolate and berry notes, very pleasant. The mouth on is medium to full. I could drink this forever."
"I was very impressed with this beer, and wish I had grabbed another bottle or two. The ABV stays very well hidden throughout the life of the bottle."
"Cheers!"
"Won't be looking for more, but a solid offering."
"Wanted some chocolate, or dark fruits, or roasted grain, or even burnt grain. It is too plain in terms of flavors, but what it does have it does well."
"Overall is a really good beer that only gets better as it warms up. Would do well with some aging or trying on older vintage of this for sure. Not the best in the world but still damn good!"
"It poured a beautiful deep dark brown with a loose head a light shade of khaki. First sip seemed shockingly thin following the Central Waters - BBS. Second sip and I was taken aback by it's wild sweetness; I got lost in it. Loads of sugary dried figs and vanilla came swimming at me hinting at it's three months spend aging in a bourbon barrel. The bourbon itself was hiding in there, but very shyly. It finished with slight touch of roasted coffee beans hanging on for dear life through a sugar avalanche."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Viscou chewy body that is surprisingly hop forward that adds a very slight bitterness and depth to this already incredibly complex beer. There is a very prominent bourbon presence up front but it is slowly countered mid-palate by a viscous, silky, luscious chocolate malt presence. Hints if dark chooclate, licorice, roasted coffee bean and toffee. The barrel adds a good bit of earthy oak and a prominent vanilla flavor. There is some slight heat toward the end of the sip and warmth in the chest but overall the ABav is excellent masked makng this complex, flavorful beer very quaffable."
"Overall: Very very good. Smooth, easy, tasty. Bit of a kick with the alcohol, but it works. Nice."
"Drinkability:This is a very tasty beer, and I'm looking forward to getting one with some age on it to smooth out the hot alcohol."
"This beer really impressed me. Normally I prefer everything except for barleywines fresh, but this aged beer is great the way it is. 4 bucks a glass? Yes please."
"Drinkability: One of the top Bourbon barrel aged stouts out there; great complexity and balance"
"EDIT: Just had the 2010 batch, bottle 3494 of 3800. Flavor and aroma were milder than I remembered, carbonation much higher, and, consequently, the body far too light for the style. Not nearly as solid as the 2009 batch. Disappointing for sure."
"D - This was a very fun beer to drink. I distinctly remember just having a good time with it, more than focusing on good descriptors and writing notes. The time of the evening, as well as my EtOH consumption, both truly shine through in any review when I start talking about dark chocolate covered lemons (wtf)..."
"Too easy to drink. It's definitely boozy, but the sweetness makes it go down easy. I could probably finish an entire bottle myself. That said, I have a second bottle for aging, but I can't imagine this beer improving much. I'll drink the second bottle soon, this time paired with some vanilla ice cream. Yum."
"The palate opens moderately sweet with a little caramel, a little sugar, some licorice. A little vanilla is present as well. Again, a port-like sweetness and fruitiness is present, there's raisins and a little oxidation is present. Roasted malt character is low. Mildly sweet on the finish with also a little cola, there's a rather low but perceptible bourbon and oak character. Soft and creamy carbonation is present, this feels wonderful on the palate. Excellent stuff, I do wish there were a little more roast present."
"The beer pours a blackish brown with very good head retention and lacing. The nose is pretty incredible, showcasing dark chocolate, licorise, vanilla, light coffee and malt balls. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, but with some licorise and a touch of hoppy bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is long, soft and creamy, with almost a cask condtioning softness. Drinkability is pretty good, though you can tell the abv. is up there a bit. Regardless, this is very well made RIS from Big Sky brewing. Impressive."
"Drinks really well for a beer this big. Has to go into my list of favorite beers. If you like GIBCS, this will be right up your alley. I am only now regretting buying one last year. I highly recommend this one and will have no problem drinking this whole bottle with my wife. Awesome beer."
"D: For a -bal aged imperial stout, this is about as easy drinking as it gets. A nice beer to sip while enjoying today's earlier successes."
"D: Sweet sweet warmth from the high abv. There is tons of snow outside and freezing temperatures, give me another bottle."
"The flavor is big and thick, burnt sugar and bourbon start off with the sweetness lingering before encountering some bitter dark grains, leveling off into a finish with the dates and more alcohol. My god it is outstanding. The flavors twist and turn as they play with each other, so drinkable, so terrible. Ivan, you are a man after my own heart!"
"Cheers!"
"D - outstanding beer here. exceptional use of bourbon barrel aging in a stout, adding another dimension without detracting from the others. sipper due to big flavors (and alcohol) yet quite the enjoyable one."
"Overall, a decent beer. It is warming which I like. The barrels are a bit subtle. I dig it, but it could have used less cocoa notes."
"A clamoring of flavors kind of melt into one. Vanilla and caramel seem to make dark, smooth chocolate. The coffee and some hops give it a bit of earthiness. Smoked meat and some woodiness. These are all bold flavors without aggressiveness. Very easy drinking for the size and abv. Would be (is) a great winter beer."
"But this one on the morning before my wedding. bottle number 145 out of 3000. Been waiting for a good time to drink it and I can't think of a better moment than monday night pakcers vs. bears. So here goes!! Great head retention and pours jet black. Aroma hints of the bourbon casking. Alcohol apparent on the tail end of the swig. All in all a beautifully balanced oak aged ris."
"D: A pleasure to drink. I'm thankful for the opportunity to try it for the first time. I hope to have it again."
"d - I thought this was a great RIS; one of the better ones I have had. It smelt amazing and taste and felt really good as well. I'm hoping they brew more of this because I'd love to get another bottle."
"Drinkability: A pretty excellent beer, though not without its flaws. This tastes like a small craft brewery beer, though, and you gotta love that - an authentic RIS, made with American toasty malts and English hops, with a not-too-overpowering barrel presence ... what's not to like? This one's definitely a treat though (not that you could, Big Sky, but don't put it in 6-packs!) - it made a good #1100, and I'd be happy to have it again from time to time ... maybe paired with some robust, creamy cheese or some dark Belgian chocolate ... but not too often. I think this would be a true world class beer if it were tweaked ever so slightly, particularly the carbonation."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and low heat--wouldn't expect it to be this good at this ABV--though at the same time it is also very obvious that it is a 10%. The fact that I can drink this on such an oppressively hot day speaks volumes."
"D: I would defiantly have this beer again. It was a very soothing drink on a cooler night outdoors at the start of fall. With that being said, I feel the drinkability is somewhat limited by the sweetness."
"Had this one at a tasting a while back at schmittymack's and never got around to entering it. Poured this one with a few other imperial stouts, including Darkness, Dark Lord and Black Tuesday. Even still, it more than held its own. Poured a deep, dark black color, with a bit of mocha colored foam. Big aromas of roasted malt, espresso, dark chocolate, toffee and vanilla. On the the palate, more roast, along with more of the bourbon character, vanilla and oak. A very good stout."
"D: I'm accustomed to nose hair curling booziness that seems to go hand in hand with this style. This, however, was an exercise in restraint and layers. I can't wait to try this again..."
"4.0 D: Definitely a decent brew for stout fans and an excellent brew if you really like bourbon. This is, indeed, the best tasting bourbon has ever been in a beer for me. However, I prefer a big powerful stout that the bourbon just can't keep up with (GI BCS comes to mind). If I ever want a good bourbon fix though, I'll seek out this beer."
"D: In both the nose and taste, this beer reminded me of the 50/50 Eclipse (Elijah Craig) and even BA Blackout. I prefer both to this beer, but it's in the same conversation. As far as barrel-aged imperial stouts go, this one is solid but not top-tier."
"A"
"The mouth feel on this is very nice. Proper carbonation, smooth, almost like velvet. Sweet, medium bodied, and a pleasure to drink. The alcohol is detectable, but not overbearing. A very nice beer."
"The beer is medium bodied and seems at times a little thin on the palate. There is some of the flavors that were in the aroma but its not quite as good as the smell would lead you to believe. Its a good beer and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It may have been slated for failure when we tried it next to Parabola but it still held its own."
"This is an excellent beer."
"D- This is a good RIS overall. Doesn't compare to my favorites of the style thought. Was very happy to have the opportunity to try this!"
"Whiskey, caramel and chocolate hit the palate up front. It's medium-bodied, not extremely viscous but quite sweet and dessert-like. There's a lot of nuance behind the dominant flavors of caramel and chocolate; subtle anise, vanilla bean, roasted grain. Some mellow, pleasant heat lingers in the finish. Unexpectedly great, this holds its own against some of the better imperial stouts out there."
"Only tag is that it could use more roast, but one of the best beers I have had in quite some time. Was waiting to have this for my 500th review, but it's beer so who cares when."
"Incredibly drinkable and I feel like I could put away a whole 750 mL if given the chance. I now understand why I like the Bottleworks XI so much."
"D: A very nice beer that epitomizes subtlety in bourbon barrel treatment. A real find that people should try to seek out."
"D - Too hot, had Parabola at 13% earlier and it was much easier to drink than this."
"Tasting with AgentZero...I drank this from a 750ml bottle into my Rochefort glass...The beer is dark black with some really nice head. At least two fingers of light tan head, decent retention and lacing...The aroma is super sweet on the front, tons of caramel, vanilla and bourbon. Light alcoholic finish...The taste is super sweet, almost to sweet to be very drinkable. Tons of vanilla and bourbon, not enough coffee or body or bitterness...Sweet and easy to crush, but would you want to??"
"Overall a very good beer, an easier to drink version of Goose Island BCS, mouthfeel was a little too thin for my tastes and that is pretty much the only knock against this beer..."
"Consumed: 5/23/2010"
"Pretty darn good. Mouthfeel could use just a tad more body, but nicely viscous."
"D: Incredibly drinkable. I don't know when the last time was that I had a barrel-aged beer drink so smoothly. Almost reminds me of BA Speedway in that regard. Something I'd love to get my hands on more of."
"D: A sipper for sure, but a very well made Bourbon Barrel Stout. For a 10% beer, it went down very smooth and with very little alcohol burn. I wish I could get this beer in my area - it's very good!"
"The nose on the tap version is every bit as magical as the bottle I advocated a few months back. The beer reeks of bourbon and dark chocolate. It's like a dark chocolate bourbon brown sugar cookie. A light roasted malt presence is perceivable. Notes of vanilla linger in the background with caramel and a little oak. The flavor is boozy bourbon chocolate with a restrained roast and a light caramel presence. Every bit as awesome as it was from the bottle. The carbonation is at a moderate level and the mouthfeel is thick, sticky, and silky with alcohol warming. This beer is great."
"This is a very solid -bal aged RIS. I'm trying not to pump this style (which is my favorite) up too much these days though, and while this was a very good example, it wasn't quite an outstanding one, so an A- sounds about right."
"D - For a 10% beer, this went down so smooth and so velvety. I could not taste any alcoholic warmth at all. 5.0"
"Bottle 1,173 of 3,000. The beer pours black with a brown head. The aroma is great and very complex. I get notes of dark fruit, alcohol, vanilla, chocolate and some light whiskey notes. The flavor is brown sugar, caramel, toffee, vanilla, chocolate and coffee. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is an excellent beer."
"I split this with a friend and a 750 ml bottle was poured into standard pint glasses. Jet black in color with a thin tan head. The aroma is full of sweet bourbon, oak and vanilla. The flavor is sweet and full of rich malt, then the bourbon and oak flavors kick in. They are rounded out by a pleasant amount of chocolate. The bourbon lingers for a while on the finish. The beer is full bodied and has a creamy mouth feel to it. One of the better RIS I have enjoyed. Thanks to Dunt for this one."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this brew! If this had been a touch more viscose it would be world-class. Will be seeking out more bottles of this brew."
"Drinkability is pretty damn good for 10%. This beer is of very high quality. Very close to breaking into the realm of the absolute top imperial stouts."
"Poured a jet black with with good carbonation and a nice fluffy brown head. Nose is bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, wood, bourbon and booze, light smell of oats as well. Taste is roasted malt, oats, vanilla, oak, bourbon, well balanced for such a complex, big beer. Taste is best of the best and defines a Barrel aged RIS. I have had some good ones and Ivan the Terrible slain them all in every way. Mouthfeel is booze, vanilla, bourbon, cocoa, tobacco. Drinkability. Hell yeah. Nothing better IMHO. Musty try and worth the price."
"HUGE. Smackdown. Poured a nice tan foamy fothy head with lots of lace. Color is an opaque brownish black. Aroma is a volatile mix of fermented malt, tar, grapes, oak, walnut, acorns, treacle. Flavor's the same but much more full. Body is luscious with perfect carbonation. Very sweet finish with a little dark malt bitterness and hop. Not a session."
"D - Unbelievably drinkable. I am stocking up to see how this ages. Not many beers get this kind of rating from me, but this does. This stuff is delicious!"
"Pours an opaque darkness with an absolutely HUGE stiff tan head that fades slowly in 3D, like an ice cream sundae. The smell is AMAZING...primarily bourbon over malted chocolate and dark fruits. The mouth feel is adequately carbonated, moderately thin..meaning that there isn't a true coating texture, ULTRA-smooth sipping qualities kicking major butt!! I NEED MORE! Full flavored, the bourbon barrel aging has the leading role supported nicely by raisins and fig over a more subtle chocolate character. Calling all bourbon enthusiasts..you NEED this! The 10% ABV is showcased really well. Many thanks Pops!! Highly recommended!"
"2009 - Bottle 167 of 3000. Pours a dark brown which becomes absolutely black in the glass, small tan head that was gone quickly but kept a nice cap for some time. Great aroma wafting up from the glass! Chocolate dominates the nose, followed by some dark fruits (raisins), charred grains, and just a hint of woody barrel and bourbon. Wow! This beer tastes amazing. Chocolaty deliciousness through and through, hints of coffee in the background, and wonderfully sweet, but nowhere near cloying, inviting dark caramel/burnt sugar middle, rounded out by barrel-aged vanilla goodness. Bourbon is there, but not in huge amounts. So perfectly balanced between the sweetness and the roast, and the alcohol is barely noticeable. Silky, smooth, low carbonation. I just can't get enough of this beer. I don't know how long this sat in the barrels, but Big Sky somehow found the sweet spot when aging this delectable brew for us. I'm very impressed as Big Sky typically doesn't do it for me. But this beer just blew me away. The balance is incredible, and I can't believe how easy it is to drink at 10%. Well done, Big Sky. Well done indeed."
"Pitch black beer with a dense, tightly packed brown head. Hefty amounts of lace are dropped down as I drink. This smells really good. Chocolate, java, roast, coffee bean, bourbon, oak, vanilla bean.... Easy 5.0 here. Body is medium to medium-full. Beer is quite smooth and luxurious. Definite alcohol presence and the spiciness associated with it. Flavor is a lot of roast and chocolate and bourbon. Great combo. The alcohol smooths out a little as it warms, but is evident throughout the whole drink. Awesome beer overall."
"Drinkable by gallons! So damn smooth and easy going its gone before ya know it. But that 10% would meet you before half way and destroy many brain cells. But yummyness sometimes supersedes responsibiliy..."
"d- this one is a sipper for sure, but definitely a real treat. not overpowering and not boring, very complex and interesting."
"On the first taste, the palate is coated with dark Baker's chocolate and vinous, port-like tannins. Lots of fudge and vanilla bean with a hint of heat from the barrel-aging. Incredibly smooth and subtle for a 10% Russian Imperial Stout. Mouthfeel is creamy and chewy, with a viscously thick finish. Never syrupy, and packs just the right amount of roast and bitterness from earthy hops to keep it drinkable. An overall fantastic beer. After being completely ""wow-ed"" by Ivan two times straight, my mission is clear: I need more!"
"D: I really enjoyed my nip of this. Would have this again in a heartbeat. One of the best examples of a bourbon aged stout I have ever had hands down."
"D- the bottle was shared between three and it didn't take anybody especially long to finish their glass. I say a great $15 dollars well spent. a great beer from one of my favorite places to do some snowboarding. I'd jump at any bottles I see again, either to drink or spread the love."
"Excellent beer that takes the notion of a barrel-aged RIS & does some cool things with it. Guess I'll be getting at least one more of the 2009 version, I'd like to try this fresh now!"
"drinkability is great this 750ml bottle went down prety fast"
"Drinkability is moderate at best. It is quite tasty, but the alcohol is also quite notable."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied, smooth and oily with a touch of carbonation, wonderful."
"All in all this is my favorite Barrel Aged Russian Imperial Stout, I have other stouts that I think are better, but this in my opinion is the epitome of balance between the aging in the barrel, and the stout itself."
"Pretty nice beer."
"This is a great beer, easy to sit back and relax with. The flavors were perfect for savoring with some great conversation I would grab a bottle of this If I saw it again without thinking"
"Drinks very easy for the style & ABV. Ivan isn't terrible at all, but needs to grow some more depth to achieve greatness"
"D- at 10%, this tasty beer went down very easily!"
"D: This beer is very good, but one bottle is enough. Have it with dessert, as it is sweet and will accompany just about anything after dinner."
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy... velvety and silky. Perfect. Good on you Big Sky... you made an affordable, delicious and near perfect BA RIS!"
"I just ordered a case through my local Terra Organica, and I really hope they come through for me, because not having a few of these to cellar would be very sad, indeed."
"Each sip begs for another. Ten percent hidden well in the taste. This is an extremely well executed bourbon stout, and one that encourages drinking rather than limits with overpowering alcohol content."
"Bottle number 320 of 3000. This beer pours a thick used motor oil black color. The head is one inch of dark tan colored foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of is very strong. Roasted malt, alcohol, bitter chocolate, burnt malt, graham cracker, wood, and licorice. It is a very interesting aroma. The taste is full of all the things the aroma is, but everything is magnified a bit. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one of the best RIS I have had I a long while. I will certainly go out of my way to drink this beer again."
"Huge vanilla and toasted coconut notes in the aroma. Sweet and chocolatey. Very sweet and rich, but not to a cloying degree. Light bodied yet rich with a long lingering aftertaste. Sweetish vanilla & chocolate, perfectly blended with a mellow bourbon. Never a harsh alcohol element, very smooth and integrated. Woody tobacco, mellow bourbon finish. The best part is the long aftertaste that has savory elements of bourbon and RIS. Super creamy feel, one to savor over a long time."
"D: Lower ABV and reasonably easy drinking."
"I wouldn't categorize this as a RIS, belongs in the barrel aged group. Not a lot of RIS coming through in this, but excellent none the less. I'm going to have to pick up a few bottles to age, if I can make it through the winter without opening another one."
"This is an excellent, well-balanced imperial stout- one of my favorites so far, and a great beer for my first review."
"Big Sky Brewing doesn't get enough love. Their IPA is all kinds of delicious and is the single best beer available locally. Ivan The Terrible Imperial Stout is outstanding as well and is one of the best (and most drinkable) bourbon barrel stouts to have crossed my path."
"D - Woosh! Ivan the Terrible is anything but. I found this to be an amazing RIS full of complex flavors and aromas while simultaneously retaining its drinkability."
"D: I knew that I should have purchased two bottles. Deuane's reaction to seeing the bottle made it worth the while though. A great barrel aged stout."
"This is a very good impy stout and extremely drinkable. It's definitely on the sweeter side of things with the chocolate playing a major role and the bourbon staying largely out of te way. Very drinkable for the style and recommended overall."
"Pours thick dark chocolate. Bittersweet chocolate aroma mostly. Above average mouthfeel of course and its chocolate and coffee. On the sweet side, drinkable to a point. Bourbon in the secondary, not slight rather significant.Good though not th best RIS I have had."
"Without a doubt, one of the best RIS that I've ever had the privilege to have... Nothing but awesome things to say"
"Reviewed on 06/05/2009. Bottle at PPRBSG09. This beer pours brown with a tan head. The aroma is of burnt malt and pretzels. Flavor is overwhelmingly bourbon and sweet malt. Basically it's just a big mess of bourbon and malt. Yeah, it is pretty terrible..."
"Out of hand-numbered bottle # 356 of 1152 this RIS was an opaque black color. The head was a full three-fingers of dark tan foam that retained excellently as a cap and left lacing in sticky curtains. Impressive looking! The aroma was dry and complex, wood, nuts, roasted malt, chocolate malt. The flavors were equally complex and on-point, a notable sweetness of molasses, lots of chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, dark fruit esters, hints of smoke and a pleasant bitterness on the finish. As it warmed the dark fruit esters became better pronounced and really paired nicely with all the chocolate it presented. I was actually blown away by how enjoyable the palate was; if I'd known what a gem it was I would have mined more out of Santa Fe where I found it! The mouthfeel was rich and silky, the body full and the carbonation delicate. One of the best RISs I've had and a joy to drink one of the first bottles of this ever produced."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus tan head, with lots of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some slight hops, oaky, fruity, nice bourbon notes. The taste is sweet, malty, slight hop note, oaky, very nice touch of bourbon, got alittle figs/raisins/plums going on here. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is one fine tasty RIS, highly recommended."
"This was a great imperial stout, my bottle said 8.75% ABV but that could have been a typo, it took me a while to track this down and after being unsuccessful in trading for it, I found for sale online happily, now I just wish I would have bought more than one bottle, would like to drink again, especially with some age, curious to see how the bottle conditioning alters things, recommended"
"Full bodied with complimenting carbonation, the alcohol stand right out but never dominates the overall expirience. I truly feel a few years age on this brew will make it incredible and put it up high in the top ten for it's class and style. A big bold barrel-aged monster to be reckoned with. Super job Big Sky! And another big thanks to travisd13 for making this trade one to remember...cheers!"
"A bit thin, with a lower amount of carbonation. A little warming from alcohol. Pretty nice."
"Pours a beautiful brownish red with simply gorgeous one finger quickly receding tan head. Smells of licorice and rum cake dominate the roasted malts. First sip is yeasty and bitter, very fruity with pears and raisins leading the way. The bottle conditioning leads to a wonderful creamy mouthfeel."
"This beer is superb, the aroma is lacking, as is any head retention and lace. But overall, this is a fantastic ris!"
"Drinkability: There was a time, if you can scarcely believe it, that I had little faith in Big Sky's offerings. In fact, it was any day prior to 3/28/09. But I was blown away by this one, it is one very tasty, highly enjoyable barrel-aged Imperial Stout that would pair remarkably well with Sergei Eisenstein's films on the subject, provided you have those Criterion disks conveniently lying around."
"Nice bourbon and oak flavors. Vanilla woodiness really comes through. Wood tannins linger on the finish. Cocoa, slightly roasty quality, hints of leather and blackberry. Mouth is a little thin for my liking which actually helps drinkability. A very nice beer."
"Aromas of vanilla, bourbon, woody, roasty, and some chocolate. Tastes of vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar, dark fruits, chocolate, and ligher wood. Definitely bourbon in both aromas and tastes (for me that's not necessarily bad)."
"The body is very creamy. This really makes the caramel notes really come out. Carbonation is light but almost like a nitro feel in the body. Overall I think the whiskey notes are a bit over the top and would have liked to see more astringency. But this should age very very nicely."
"D - Pretty damn easy to drink and extremely enjoyable. I can't wait to put some time on this and let it mellow some."
"Huge thanks to Matt and the people at Big Sky who listened to me bitch about not getting this in... and a huge props to jjanega08 for appeasing an over aggressive trader :-) gracias Jozef."
"A very delicious and drinkable beer, wish it was available more often."
"Overall really, go find this one. One of the best RIS I have had ever, let alone lately. I would say you have to find this one."
"Bottle number 929"
"Drinkability? I put this one on the ""dangerously drinkable"" department. I can't believe how easy this one goes down and all I'm doing is taking small sips but they're very frequent sips. Delicious! Awesome job here Big Sky Brewing!"
"Pours dark brown with a solid black body in the glass. Natural carbonation adds to the appearance of the ale, producing a long lasting foamy tan head. Snickers bar aroma with notes of chocolate, caramel, nougat, nuts, bourbon, vanilla, coconut and wood. Flavor is well balanced, sweet, richly flavored. Finish is a touch short though. A nice ale all around."
"7/4/7/4/15/3.7"
"On tap at Stub & Herbs in beer haven Minneapolis this past weekend. Served in a nifty half pint, beer was a smoky ebony with minimal head, light mocha lacing. Nose was not overpowering, anise, dark chocolate. Taste- not all that thick, medium bodied, relatively dry and well attenuated. Moderate roastiness and overally just easy drinking for a RIS."
"Limited release barrel aged beer. Hand numbered bottles, only 1152 bottles were released. Very big Russian Imperial Stout, lots of vanilla aroma and flavor from the barrel. Very drinkable, one that would be great with a big cigar. Nice head. Goes down smooth. If you can find it get it. About $10 a bottle and well worth every penny."
