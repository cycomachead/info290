"O: I feel like I've just drunk a milkshake. Amazingly creamy. A superb beer."
""
"Overall:  Nothing traditional here.  At last, something not too sweet.  People in the US are addicted to sugar.  This is not what to expect from what is currently going around the US as a Russian Imperial Stout.  This is down to earth and not overly built.  It tastes raw, like something made in the 1800s.  I dig it."

"Bottle. Brewed May 2011.  Started at 54 degrees.  Poured like a dark brown espresso, not much head, could have been my fault.  Smelled terrific.  Nice blend of malt, coffee and chocolate.  There was no one dominant flavor for me.  I thought it came together nicely with malt and coffee more present, a hint of chocolate.  I didn't get fruit, but something was managing the bitterness very well.  Medium body.  Would have preferred a little more creaminess, but still a great beer."

"On tap at Sunset, a great treat."
""
"Amazing beer. Absolutely delicious right off the shelf. This sample was 2012 vintage. Worthy of the name Imperial."
"Very thick black pour, good lacing despite ABV. Flavor is espresso, bit of cherry and burnt chocolate. Major roasted bitterness in the finish but doesn't impede on the drinkability. Nice gem."
""
""
"O: I think this beer is a touch oxidized the underlying beer is quite good but I'm getting a little green apple taste very faint but it's there.  I think this beer would be amazing fresher"

""
""
"Didn't taste anything like what a RIS should. Completely disappointed since this beer came so highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Coffee, bitter dark chocolate and some nice smokieness. Thick, creamy and really solid."
""
"You guys are such liars! This beer is mediocre at best.  For a RIS I was very disappointed. Where was the strong finish. Where was the expresso with pear overtones. There was nothing great or even close to outstanding about this beer"
"Dark black body. Big aroma of toastyness and sweets. Taste is mostly molasses. A little too much for my liking. It’s ok."
"With an extremely balanced amount of dark fruit and chocolate to contrast the coffee tastes and aromas, Wells and Young create a perfect example of an Imperial Russian Stout."
""
"Overall, I'm glad I was able to try this. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to lovers of the style."
""
"It's like a great mass of melodies intertwining. Without a single discord they come together, to form this enormous, harmonious symphony . It is really, truly a pleasure for the taste buds. Just needs a bit more strings ;)"

"O: Pumped to have found this brew in Chiang Mai.  A classic.  Smooth, well done.  History in a cup.  Aside from that, the heavens did not open, but I will enjoy sipping the rest of this tonight, Dec 21st, 2014 in Chiang Mai, Thailand."

"O: Its like 6.99 and its a 10oz or something, its worth it. Its quite enjoyable and it's been around for some time. I highly recommend drinking this beer or getting your distributor to sell them."

"Overall: An incredible beer that clearly lives up to its reputation. Each sip tastes like you are indulging in every item on the desert tray in a grand feast. Cannot recommend enough."

"This is vintage 2013 and its good until 12-09-26. The nose is chocolate, dark dried fruit with a touch of fruit cake. It pours deep chestnut under a finely bubbled tan head. The palate begins with rich chocolate backed by light coffee that blossoms into dark dried fruit and then fruit cake and hints of molasses. It dries on the finish with a slight astringency and a suggestion of chalk. The carbonation is very fine and soft - almost nitro quality. The body is chewy and the beer is slightly warming. Everything is very well balanced. An outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brewed using a traditional recipe, this is a classic Russian imperial stout and probably the blueprint from which most modern imperial stouts were derived."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Luxurious and silky English stout brewed with both real chocolate and chocolate roasted malts. Flavors of Espresso, Molasses with smoky finish.  Brewed first for empress Catherine the Great in 1795."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent drinkability. Perfect Russian Imperial Stout"
""

"Notes: 2012 vintage. An excellent example of an imperial Russian stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Decent stuff but by no means does this live up to the hype. The sour note is a bit off, but you can see the potential for a very good stout hidden in there somewhere. Dark fruit flavours played well with the rest, but this just didn't do what most say it does."
""

"O. This is alright. Probably truer to the style from hundreds of years ago, but things evolve for a reason and the modern RIS has made this obsolete. Plenty of nice chocolate notes here, but the ashtray flavors dominate on the finish and leave a bad taste in the mouth. This is just OK...nothing more."
"OK – this is drinkable but not desirable – if this is as originally brewed in 1795 as the label says then I don’t see how RISs became popular. It is singularly lacing in flavor other than the initial weak bitter chocolate taste. Lacing is poor, head is small, and aroma is weak. To add insult to injury, it comes in a 9.3 oz bottle – might as well by on an airplane."

"Courage Imperial Russian Stout is a beer supposedly designed for aging, but my three-year-old bottle was a hot, acrid mess. I would love to try another vintage to see if this beer lives up to its heralded reputation."
""
"This had to have been a bad bottle/batch i had."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"The dark burnt malts kick in on the taste upon first sip and then the espresso, chocolate notes follow. Then the pear-like meaty fruitiness expresses itself and bringing up the rear is a dry but acrid bitterness. Form 10% ABV the alcohol is well masked. I wish I had more than one of these to drink. It has a 2016 expiration date so I bet it ages beautifully."
""
""
"First bottle of liquid of liquid Courage I've tried. Imperial made for the Tsars of olde. Very delicious and should not be passed on if you have the chance."
"OVERALL: It's a shame we don't see this beer more often in Colorado, but it truly is a wonderful Russian Imperial Stout. The intensity of the fruit and the subtle hint of tartness serve to set this beer apart from the rest. It may not be the Russian Imperial Stout I'm used to, but it is undoubtedly delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer to age."
"This took the edge off of a day spent filling in for someone else at work rather nicely. It would be equally at home after dinner or before going off to bed. The price (which I don’t specifically remember but recall it was rather high for the small bottle size) would keep me from regularly picking this up, but it would make a nice, occasional reward for good behavior."

"The beer is smooth with a medium plus to full mouthfeel. The beer is restrained and well crafted. Incredible attempt at the style."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a jet black with a small off-white head. Aroma is malts and sweet fruit. Flavor has a strong dose of sweet fruit mixed with roasted malts. There is also a touch of coffee and chocolate, and the smokiness helps balance these flavors out. This has a nice full body a goes down smooth. It is one of the best beers I have had. Everything about it is just pure joy - from the rich aroma to the complex and well-balanced flavors. I will have to get some more bottles to age."

""
"A classic well done."
""
""
"A historic, legendary brew that lives up to the hype. I hope to see this again, and I hope to try some aged versions at some point."
"Overall: Very good brew, has a sour bitter and absolutely complex feel...little pricey but then again it's also a little rare. Grab a glass and indulge. Salud!"

"Courage tied for our 8th highest average score of the 12 brews tasted at 4.06."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thick, heavy, almost chewy. Overall, this is very good."
""
""
""
"A very good beer, very different from the American RIS' less sweet and more dark fruits. I'm not sure I'd pick this over ten fidy but an excellent beer non the less."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of a Russian Imperial Stout, it wasn't as bold and roasty as some of my favorite American brewed RIS's but it still had that great mouthfeel I would expect and I thought it represented the style nicely. This beer had ok drinkability, it was a little smooth, rich, creamy, filling, a little boozy, and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, one of these small bottles is the perfect size for me and I don't think I would want to have another one in a row and I think it makes for a nice beer to have on a cold and snowy winter night. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, I thought it was very nice and it's just what I look for in a good RIS. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad and it was fairly complex, but it was very sweet and the roasted malts could have stuck out a little more. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was fun to try, but for over $6 for a small 9oz bottle, it's just too pricey for me and I would much rather have a Founders Imperial Stout, especially for the price. I would recommend this to anyone who like RIS's. All in all I enjoyed this beer, but it isn't my favorite of the style, Founders Imperial Stout still holds that title and I think this beer lacks the refinement that Founders Imperial Stout has and it's for sure more drinkable. Good job guys, I'm glad I gave this one a try."

"This RIS dominates on all levels. The flavors are complex and deliver new experiences with every sip, especially that long and lingering dark fruit finish. So enjoyable and surprising. The mouth feel makes the beer a real pleasure to drink. I am going to eagerly seek this one out again once I drink down more of my inventory."
""
""
"O- Really impressed with this beer. I think it's aged a bit at the brewery before bottling but not sure if in barrels or for how long. Very surprised at the pronounced dark fruit, cherry flavors considering there is no adjuncts that I'm aware of. Wish this wasn't as expensive as some barrel aged stouts though."

"Bottle from BucketBoy almost two years ago. This has been sitting in my on-deck fridge for that long. I guess that fridge isn't being used as intended. Anyway, thanks! Snifter. Black with a billowing light brown head with impressive retention. Lacing forms thick sheets on the sides. Fine looking beer. Lots of chocolate and roast in the aroma, with blackstrap molasses, licorice, and a bit of coffee. Some earthy, woodsy notes as well. The flavor is quite roasty and dry with a moderate level of earthy bitterness. Strong chocolate profile with evident coffee, molasses, and licorice. The bitter/roast combo borders on acridity but just manages to avoid that pitfall. Alcohol is really well hidden. The body is full. Upper moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is chewy, sticky, and silky. A good, well balanced Russian Imperial Stout."

"*-Overall this is freaking awesome! This like an imperial version of Young's Double Chocolate Stout. Great stuff to have with a cigar or by the fire as a winter warmer. THIS IS THE BOMB!"
""
""
"O - A great example of the style and perfectly executed - this beer is a benchmark. A definite try."
"Considering how well this beer is supposed to hold up with time, there is a lot of oxidation in only two years. Other than that, this beer is amazing. However, at the price it goes for, I don't think I will be trying this one again."
"Overall, it's an amazing beer. It's darned near perfect for the style and one of the best beers I've had regardless of style. Easy to drink and with the high ABV, it can sneak up on you."

"A wonderful beer, and an education for anybody who loves stouts! Beautiful."
""
"O- Yes, this beer is great everything I want out of a beer"
"Overall, a really good RIS. Nice stuff."
"I would recommend giving this one a go."
""
""
""
""
"O: If this was rarer, people would be all about it. Its very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall great flavors and aromas from this one, but the body leaves something to be desired."
""
"Overall: a very rich and satisfying beer. I like the sophistication of the flavor."
"An utterly black beer, this brew is a moderately sweet, heavy, classic example of the style. Not overly hopped, yet still bitter, it has some fruit notes in the smell and foretaste. Lots of malt and huge roasted notes. Coffee, chocolate, and raisins. It has a thick, but not quite syrupy character. This is a fine beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The bottle says it is 2012 vintage so it has been aged less than a year. There were some really nice molasses, licorice, and fruity tones to this beer. Parts of it were good, but most of the taste is nothing but a strong taste of alcohol. I haven't had this before, aged or otherwise, but it was way too hot for me. Maybe if I saw another bottle for sale, I'd buy it and age it for 3-5 years, but as it was, I just wasn't impressed for what you pay for it."
"Overall: Really surprised that this RIS is so robust. Took me back a little bit at first. I am not a huge fan of black licorice in my dark beers so I didnt love it, but it was still surprisingly an enjoyable beer for me despite the unpleasantries of the black licorice notes. I think that this beer has really nice cellar potential; if I were to run into a bottle of this again I would drink one with somewhere between 3-5 years on it."

"275 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 9/19/2024. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy tan head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light char, coffee, dark bread, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, char, coffee, dark bread, light raisin, licorice, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, char, coffee, dark bread, licorice, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Excellent balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt flavors with light fruitiness; with big robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, fairly chalky, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish; very smooth to sip on for 10%. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial stout! Great balance and complexity of big dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pours a pitch black color with a thin creamy tan head. Lacing clings to the glass quite well. Aromas of some oatmeal and freshly broken chocolate bar. Taste begins with a very slight hint of vinegar, then a lucious dark chocolate flavor, then some toasted bread. An herbal, resinous hoppy flavor finishes the flavor, along with some wood aged character and pine. Mouthfeel is extremely rich. Overall a superb Russian Imperial Stout. One of the best I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The dark rich black malt flavor is full but lagered clean with a little bitterness and just a bit of sweetness that enhances the malt flavor. This is a classic and I loved every drop."
""
"O: I'm really enjoying this beer. I was a little doubtful when fruity character dominated the nose that it would be a good beer that just wasn't as much my thing, but I'm happy with this one. In a world of many imperial stouts, I don't know that I can see myself making efforts to revisit this one, but the long history of the brew is certainly cool, and this is absolutely a good beer."
"Medium to full bodied with average carbonation. The alcohol is very well hidden, and I would not have guessed 10.00 % abv. I would have guessed lower, maybe around 8.00 % abv. Very nicely made. Too bad this beer appears to be heading for retirement."
"The beer was cola black that produced a nice tan head that was well retained.  It gave off a coffee aroma, which followed through to the taste, which was also accompanied by a slight alcohol taste and chocolate.  The beer had a good thick feel to it.  I would be very interested to try this on tap in the UK."
""
"Beefy flavour with loads of date syrup, black olives, espresso, etc. Dark chocolate. Everything you'd expect from a Russian imperial stout. That's it. Nearly perfect, nearly boring. Typic. Very good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: So glad I had the opportunity to try this beer as it shows off quite a different dimension for the RIS style than I have had before; I still like the powerful, big American versions very much, but this is a different pathway"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Courage's fine effort at a warm, hearty stout certainly lived up to the hype I had witnessed. This beer, whilst packaged in a peculiarly small bottle, contains all the character one would expect from a large 750ml bottle. This is imperial stout at its most unique, balanced and flavorsome. It could potentially even reach the dizzy heights of five-dom after a few years of maturation."
""
" This taste is familiar yet fresh with dark currant flavors and subtle dark sugar and molasses taste with some vinous and sweet toffee flavors side by side with slight toasted malt, cocoa and a pine-like hop echo with mild dark cocoa essence and very light alcohol. The great thing about this russian imperial stout is how drinkable it is. I have tried the original courage and this bottle which is over 2 years old still has a vibrant fresh taste even though it has some age. I love how the yeast fruitiness mixes with the rich malt and the alcohol does not even really makes an appearance til it nears cellar temp. I love this and would recommend it to anyone interested in a traditional Imperial Stout"
""
""

"Enjoyed this more after a year or so of holding onto it. Less licorice dominated and more integrated with the chocolate. A lovely beer that is fun to drink and something i need to remind myself never to pass up when i see it in the shops. Exudes quality. Good value, even taking into account the smaller bottle size."
""
"O: really good stuff. It's well balanced and deft of hand. I want to buy more and age it for the long haul."
""
""
"Bottle No. 042140"
"A good traditional RIS. I imagine more of the dark fruit flavors would come out as it ages."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Great RIS. Great balance and complexity."
""
"Overall a quality representation of the style from an American point of view. The 10% alcohol strength is well hidden and makes this somewhat smooth if you can overcome the extreme licorice flavor and metalic aftertaste. Over priced IMO."
"O: Decent, more than decent really. Its a good RIS, with no trace of the 10% anywhere, and solid roasty, malty characters."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: very satisfying, well-made"
"Pretty solid offering for the style, pretty much hits all the right notes. While the hop content is certainly present it still doesn't prevent this RIS from being a bit cloying at first, however it still manages to take the palate on a bit of a ride through some different terrain when all is said and done. Based on that I have to keep reminding myself this is an English rendition, which makes pretty much par for the course in that light."
""

"A great imperial stout, pretty much spot on benchmark quality."
""
"O: more rustic than expected, and with the high ABV more apparent. Good but not world-class."
"Wish that there had been a bit more hea initially, although low head retention is considered within the style for RIS."
"This beer poured out as a deep black color with a brown foamy head on top. There is a moderate lacing and pretty good retention as well. The smell of the beer is rich and roasted with a sweet berry aroma coming off of it also. The taste is chocolatey with a roasted malt and coffee, there is also a strange fruity flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and very rich. Moderate carbonation and smooth. Overall this is a very good Russian Imperial Stout. Very rich and very enjoyable. Worth checking out!"
""
""
""
"Sorry I'm not doing a full review with the right paces and all of the bits in the right order, but I wanted to make sure it was known that this is still out there!"
""
""
"Pours black with tons of yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle (I left almost all of it in the bottle), tan colored head fades quickly to nothing leaving some lacing on the glass on its way down. Much more appealing aroma with rich, sweet, decadent dark chocolate and malt, faint anise, smoky roast, and booze. Very sweet and rich, with both dark chocolate & baker's chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, smoke, roast, booze, there actually is pear on the finish as the bottle states. Smooth, chewy, and full bodied mouth-feel. Overall, I poured it and thought it was going to be a disappointment, but I standcorrected - it was a world-class quality Russian Imperial Stout!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy reddish brown... dark brown in the glass. One of those fancy DFH glasses that turns any beer into a billowing hefe... oh wait, this one manages not even a full fingers of light brown foam. Settles quickly leaving a thin ring and spotty lacing. Zhukov stains the glass brown. I believe that's progress. Smell: toasted buttered brown bread, and raisin-esque dark fruit. Mild earthiness. Taste: french roast coffee, buttered toasted raisin bread, note of dark chocolate. imo, American versions of this style really long surpassed Brit revivals. This is ok, but I'd have been just as ok never trying it."
"O: Great stout, it's a concentrated punch of flavor. Even with all that flavor it's not too robust to enjoy. The whopping 10% alcohol is covered nicely here. One of the better stouts out there. 10% is just a tad high for my taste, but I wouldn't have known otherwise. This beer gets good overall marks for its uniqueness and bold, full flavor."
""
""
"I know this is one of those beers that has a claim to be the first of its style. Whether or not that's true, this should be measured against the best of them. It's simply a delight to drink."
""
""
"O: very damn tasty, rich, and quaffable! and I'm a bit surprised. has a ""benchmark"" quality to it....seems well worth the money/novelty"
"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours black with a thick, tan head that dissipates slowly. There are some visible bubbles collecting on the underside of the head. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head recedes. There are aromas of dark roasted malts, dark fruits, coffee, alcohol, and chocolate. The roasted malts are very forward in the flavor, bringing some roastiness and smokiness to the palate. I also get the coffee and chocolate notes. The dark fruit flavors are also there, but the other flavors are the star of this show and the fruit plays on the back end. The alcohol can also be tasted as well and there's plenty of roast in the aftertaste. The body is full with moderate carbonation. This is an excellent beer."
""
"O- ""O" is what I felt when I drank this beer! This is a very well balanced, great tasting, very fragrant beer. Hurry up and try it this year before all 210,000 of them are gone! And if you can, pick some up to hold on to as I could see this beer aging really well."
"It definitely tastes like an original article. Fruity flavors are becoming more prominent through and through, halfway into the bottle. More chocolate, more coffee, more of everything you want from an Imperial Stout, with less of the hops you get from American versions, and much less sweetness. This is almost perfect, actually. Too bad it's so small, rare, and expensive. Alas and alack."
""
""
"A very well done RIS, big bold flavors without becoming overwhelming."
"Overall, probably the best RIS I have had. Extremely complex flavors and an absolutely amazing mouthfeel with alcohol being extremely well hidden. A definite world class beer."
"Overall. A very nice beer with nice flavours going on in. Big but goes down pretty easy. Nice stuff, I'll buy it again."
"Overall a solid imperial stout. I'm hard-pressed to find any flaws here. Just a tasty, rich, complex beer in a conveniently small-format bottle. What's not to like?"
""
"This may not be the same experience as the '93 that I had, but this is certainly a beer in better shape. Really liked the aroma, and I would possibly be interested in trying one of these beers many years from now."
"Overall a real impessive brew, and real enjoyable. Probably not as big or as bold as some people might like, but stands up with the rest easily, and can knock down plenty of others too."
"275 ml bottle, 2012 vintage, bottle #053469. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like dark fruit, dark bread, molasses, chocolate, and some coffee. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some woodiness, toffee, and a bit of anise noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, and I'd like to try this again in the future."

"	Overall Impression: fantastic, this is fit for royalty; huge bold flavors; very rich, almost a meal in itself; this will keep you warm!; I love it and cannot wait to try one after it’s been in the cellar awhile"
""
"O: An excellent example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Well made, subtle, and very drinkable."
"Very complex and delicious. The roast takes a backseat and lets the raw heavy malt play out with the yeast. Very raw, bold flavors delicately interweaved together. Wish it came in a bigger bottle."
""
""
"Had this beer once before and it was just as great as I remembered. Makes me wonder why I don't get this more often. Truly a fine example of a Russian imperial stout done right."
""
"This is really a great beer. Just plain tasty with abundant character all around. Different than a lot of the other RIS’s on the marketplace now."
""
"O: So smooth and silky, very easy drinkability despite its 10%abv which i thought drank more like a 5-6% with hardly any interference. Insanely silky goodness that i found disappearing more quickly from the glass then i like (especially since i only had one). Clearly top of class with its exceptionally smooth execution."
""
""
""
"overall, eh.... darn good for the style, but the style is a difficult one for me to appreciate although i continue to try it. i love trying the higher abv brews and i do like the differences. i like the beer but i need to change it up a little after one of these. maybe a couple of these in succession with a good bourbon would be in order . . . . . i give it a 4.5 overall because i believe it's a great product, a nice taste for the style and the abv, and i like the flavor i'm getting from it."
"for 5 bucks I'm going to throw a few away for aging, strange the bottle says it can be kept for up to 13 years, seems random and unlucky"
""
""
"I poured from a 275 ml bottle, 2012, into a snifter. The pour is inky black, light tan head. The aroma is more fruity than expected, notes of coffee and chocolate. The flavor is rich with chocolate, coffee, and some fruity notes. The finish lingers with a mix of chocolate and fruit. The beer is smooth, light carbonation, no dicernable booze. Interesting beer, IMO it should improve with some age on it."
""
"D - Nicely made, it has a really nice balance of dark fruit and chocolate malt with almost no coffee like roasted character. Spicy and very seasonally appropriate for winter."
"Overall: full flavored, excellent balance and nice dark chocolate flavors which I really enjoy in this style."
""
"Crammed with lots of taste. Not bad at all :)"
"D: nice to have an english version of a style that has become highly americanized. dry while managing to have plenty of flavor. a very enjoyable RIS."
"This one is way too young now. I have tasted an 18 year old bottle of Courage Russian Imperial Stout from 1993, and that was a much more interesting experience. I really hope this one will age as well as the previous vintages."
""
""
"An interesting, and heady affair, to be sure, but kind of lacking the gravitas of those New World upstarts, unfortunately. The sly tugging of the booze, while not actually hot, does soon aggravate to a certain degree, even over such a small serving size. Quite nice to try, sure, but probably meant for a more reserved, Old World stout aficionado, than this otherwise biased camper."
"Damn, that was a great brew!"

"Medium-full body; medium carbonation; reasonably smooth overall feel. Worth a try for sure; this beer has a reputation for being a great cellar candidate but I couldn't resist drinking mine after only about a year in the bottle. Will return in the future and take another look, I think."

"Note: 2010 vintage"
"O: The classic example of the style (Russian Imperial Stout)... Very enjoyable, with well hidden alcohol that makes it pretty easy to drink. Nice complexity to both the flavor and the aroma."
""
"You kind of have to take this one for what it is, and not what you'd want it to be (present day). There is something about this beer that definitely strikes me as an old world version of the style. Which makes sense, since this is an older recipe and basically what they were going for. Intense in its own way, but of course nowhere near a Dark Lord or anything like that. An interesting ris worth trying out to see what it used to be like."

"Pours a dark roast coffee black with a finger or two layer of medium tan foam. Bittersweet chocolate, light charcoal smoke, and a touch of fruitiness round out the initial aromas with a cinnamon stick spiciness coming through as the beer stands. Roasty malts and scantly sweetened cocoa entice the palette first before bitter chocolate takes over. Smoky, dry with a bit of blackberry on the backend. Thick mouthfeel seems appropriate for beer of this caliber and is akin to a well-pulled espresso shot. Well-crafted in every aspect, one to sip slowly. I'll definitely be picking up some for the cellar next time I see it."
""
""
"O: One of my favorite imperial stouts. I'm going to have to go back to the package store and get the remaining 3 bottles to age and see if another year makes any improvements."
""
"O: I've heard a lot about this beer and just happened to stumble across it at the bottleshop today. This beer, for me, is a perfect example of the style. Everything that I want in a R.I.S is in this beer. The Courage Imperial Russian Stout is worthy of all the hype and respect that it gets. If you haven't tried this then seek it out. I recommend getting a few bottles for the cellar, I know that tomorrow I'll be heading back to the bottleshop to pick up a couple more for sure."
""
"O: This beer is delightful and packs a punch. The bottle is only 9.3 US ounces, but this is more than enough for a taste on this strong ale!"
""
""
"Overall - Wonderful example of the style. Surprised to find a true English RIS exhibiting such American characteristics. Maybe I'm just confused as to what I should be expecting. It's extremely hoppy, but on the bittering end at least. I'd go for it a little more if it weren't as palate-crushing, but I suppose it needs all of those hops to survive the long journey to Catherine the Great."
""
"Pours black in color with a finger or two of khaki head. Nice dark fruit aromas which offset the roasted malt aroma. Dark chocolate, plenty of coffee, and a hint of licorice. Some nice burnt sugar notes and just a touch of smoke. The flavor is fairly sweet, but still a good roast and coffee character. Some dark chocolate, a touch of toasted nuts, molasses, mild licorice, and some dark fruit sweetness. A well balanced Imperial Stout."

"Overall: A world class stout. Recently revived after several years of retirement, this Russian Imperial stout can be aged for many years with little ill affect. For the purposes of this review this bottle was aged for over a year."
""
"Heavy hitter. Poured at a good temperature with a super size tan, foamy, frothy, fluffy head that settle very slowly and some lace. Color is a very dark, almost opaque, but clear amber brown with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, dark, ripe fruit, yeast, wine. Flavor's like nose with subtle sweetness, soft carbonic tang, roast/yeast/hop bitter and a little clashing between some of those qualities. Body is soft and full; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, long, and quite boozy. Big beer. Neat that Courage is able to come back with a beer like this."
"This is a tremendously respected beer that defies style, prescription, or expectation. It's effortless and gentlemanly personality exudes the notion of tall, dark, and handsome."
"Taste is a little on the hot side right now, I definitely will look for a couple of these for the cellar. The potential is there but does not seem fully integrated yet. Lots of raspberry and figs with a burnt sugar malt with a fair amount of chocolate and roast. Mouthfeel is a little on the thinner side of impy stouts and the sweetness is pretty low. It opens up more as it warms, and gets better. I like it quite a bit now and like the cellaring potential even more."
""
""
""

"Pours pitch black with a beige half finger head, considerable lacing present. Aromas of roasted malt with espresso undertones dominate accented with pleasant inviting booziness. Creamy, smooth, and full-bodied the flavors of roasted malt, espresso, dark fruit, all accented with notes of apricot, pear, and apple. Very complex and satisfying this brew justifies its historic status."
"Side note: after the tasting had mostly concluded, we poured out the last 1/4"" in the bottle to see what was left. There were some chunks, and a very slight brettanomyces profile (VERY SLIGHT), and that may have contributed to the lively carbonation."
"O: Superb example of the style: big and roasty, with nice fruit to provide some complexity."
"A beer this legendary is often a let down, but that's not the case here. This beer excels in almost every category, but is a standard bearer in the nose & mouthfeel. Excellent. Love to see this one show up locally."
"This beer pours black with a fairly sizable head for the style, that quickly drops down to a decent foam on top of the brew. The aroma is rich and roasty, with toffee, dark chocolate, burnt coffee, and a nice, mineral earthy quality. The taste is also very good, it comes on strong with the coffee flavors at first, but then gives way to a great mix of fruit and roasted malt. The fruits aren't dark like in most RISes, these are bright fruits that are quite delicious and make this a unique drinking experience. The mouthfeel is lighter than the average RIS, but it works great with the fruit flavors. The drinkability is exceptional, it doesn't feel anywhere close to 10%. Overall, this is an amazing and unique imperial stout. The fruit flavors that this beer has fresh are really quite unique. I wish I had another to put away for longer."
""
"Pours a four-fingered light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Light chocolate nose and flavor is chocolate, sweetness then burnt chocolate finish. High ABV is hidden. $7.49 for a 275ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
"I found this to be average at best, but I will try again, perhaps it was a bad bottle."
""
"The 2012 bottling found its way my way, and I found it a much better tasting-beer than the previous bottling I tried (2010? 2011?), and I have adjusted my review/scores accordingly. My previous bottling date had some astringency and seemed a little thin. The 2012 was a fuller and more rewarding drink - outstanding."
""
""
"A nice treat that I'm glad I got to have..."
"O - a great, unexpected find. I was told this was quite limited in this area, a nice big stout that apparently will age nicely, so I'll look for a couple more to put away for a bit."
""
""
""
"Overall: A good strong stout with excellent flavors. I will have to return when I don't have holes in my mouth from having my wisdom teeth removed."
""
"3.0 D: Earthy, ""farmhousy"" RIS. Not a big fan, but it might interest those looking for a ""natural tasting RIS," whatever that means."
"I've been wanting to try this beer for years and was glad to finally see a new batch. It's very enjoyable stuff, but I wouldn't say it's worth drinking more than once at $7 for a 9.3 oz bottle."
"Again, there is hope for Courage if aged for a sufficient period of time."
"Notes: Dam this one freaking amazing almost an adreniline rush. Cheers."

"DOA"
"The flavors on the palate are stunning. Heavily roasted with plenty of grainy bitterness along with an herbal, minty hop character up front. The palate expresses, in order of strength (to my palate, at least) dark chocolate (70%, mildly sweetened), coffee (a nice creamy espresso), smoke (smoldering briquette)and peat. The peat lingers on into the finish, lending an aggressive but refined smoke note. The mid-palate is surprisingly fruity as wellAll sweetness that's present does exhibit a bitter side as well (burnt sugar, black licorice, buckwheat honey-like grainy character). Medium-full in body with moderate carbonation, this beer has a wonderful finish, with the aforementioned bitterness and sweetness, along with some char, a moderate fruit character and a touch of alcohol. Pretty excellent stuff IMO, I will have to buy a few more to cellar, despite the price."
"Overall pretty good, quite big and probably needs a couple years to settle the large overroasted malt flavors, but nice chocolate, nice bitterness, dry finish, quite a bit beer, much bigger than I expected from a U.K. beer."
""
"O: A bit more balanced and smoother than it's American brothers. It's what I would expect a Russian Imperial Stout to taste like. It's not oak aged or brewed with chocolate or coffee....it's pure RIS. Love it."
"Just to the right of medium bodied. Almost creamy. A nice sipper not overly bitter. Just a faint warming. Old school without being acrid or overly hoppy."
""
"Pours a very dark brown/black color with a thick light brown head. Pours beautifully into a glass and expands like a mushroom cloud. Heavy scents of cocoa, caramel malts, and burnt sugars. Taste is bold and full of flavor. I think this is as about as close to a “perfect beer” as I have ever had. Great robust taste with complex ingredients that compliment each other perfectly. Smooth as silk texture with sweet after taste. A fantastic sipping beer!"
""
"O - I found it to have aged remarkably well. I think the slight sourness that adds some fruity components to the flavor may be off-putting to some. I, however, enjoy it a lot. It has developed very well and held its ground. I had a sample of one from the 70's not too long ago and remember having a similar experience."
" If you love IRS or RIS you simply must try this one."
"This one pours like a delightful imperial stout. A little lightish on the pour, but as it collects in the glass, it takes on the black opaque appearance that I know and love. Velvety, creamy looking head of the dark brown persuasion, excellent retention and heavy lacing. The smell of this thing is deep and dark with a healthy dose of hop bite. Plenty of baker's chocolate and dark fruit along with a hint of molasses. The herbal bite at the end is swift and strong. The taste is similar to the smell. Very robust in the malt department with bitter chocolate and some dark fruit sweetness. The hops are tame but definitely make an appearance to smooth out the intense malts. The mouthfeel is creamy and heavy with low carbonation. Overall, this is a damned good imperial stout. A bit on the spendy side @ $7 for a 10oz bottle, but I'm glad I gave it a go."

"Big thanks to NewBrewBB for the birthday surprise. 275ml bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. 19/09/24 indicated on the bottle. Brewed in May 2011 indicated on the label on the neck of the bottle. Pours slightly darker than cola with a loose, dense, half-inch, khaki-colored head that exhibits excellent retention. Thick arcs of lacing are exposed on the tilt side of the glass with each sip. Nose reveals cocoa, a trace of char, dark fruit, brewer's licorice and a suggestion of ethanol towards the back. Taste follows nose; however, there actually seems to be some slight oxidation present in the flavor profile as well as a hint of soy sauce behind the char. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an even carbonation that falls just short of lively. There's also some residual acidity at the finish. Overall, I have to say that I was a bit let down by this beer, especially given the $7.95 price tag. I don't even think this is a beer that will stand cellaring. Pretty much a swing and a miss for me."
""
"Fight btw. dark & light, good & evil, tasty but challenging at times."
"O: Been wanting this for a while. Perfect for the winter season, it would be more of my ""go to"" beer however it is a bit pricey per bottle to stock up on it at $7.99, so I can only buy a few at a time. I wish it was the same cost as Old Rasp."
""
"O: An interesting RIS. A bit thin and a bit subtle on the smell, but wow did they hit the taste just right. Really showcases the malt bill and doesn't require any additional flavors or barrel aging to make it delicious."
"O- A very tasty stout, the fruity aspect is interesting and done pretty well."
""
"A nice array of flavours but too sweet and boozy for me."
""
"This went down the hatch very easy like and I was surprised at the depth of this RIS. Im not a huge RIZZ guy, but I can appreciate the nuances of this beer. I have another bottle and it's taking a ten year dirt nap. I'll update then."
"This is very welcoming and warming. A nice imperial stout, and obviously has roots as one of the original. Something I enjoy and would recommend."
"(D)- This one has been on my want list for quite some time now. Very happy it was brought back out of retirement. I look forward to seeing how this ages in the coming years. A great stout that I think can definitely improve with time."
"O: Great beer that is balanced and delicious. Perfect cold weather beer as it hits very well on all the roasted flavors, and after half the beer, I feel the warming sensation from the 10% alc, although I can’t detect the alcohol except through my nose. A great example of what a RIS should be."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"D - Did not perceive much heat, so ABV well hidden. A nice beer."
"Shame it's so expensive for such a small bottle...wouldn't mind drinking more of it! Can't justify it, though. Glad to give it a try and look forward to having it another time."
""
"O- An elegant, gorgeously structured stout that has earned its reputation as a classic. A proven winner in the cellar."
""
"While I was happy to try this classic, it fell just a little short of my high expectations. But it still ends up a good beer, and a good nightcap to my long day."
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours very dark brown, appearing black. Nice two finger light brown head with medium bubbles and massive lacing. Good aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, sweet dark fruit. Flavor is exceptionally well integrated, with slight dark malts to start, but other flavors opening up in the middle. Roasted and sweet malt, dark fruit, bitter coffee and chocolate. Finishes with coffee and a well tuned hop bite. Excellent heavy, creamy body is noticeable from the very first taste. A very nice, complex and well done imperial stout. These guys have obviously have kept the craft of imperial stout making alive. Exceptional."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap. Thin foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, dark fruit, bittersweet chocolate, and some alcohol. There is a distinct cinnamon aroma that comes out as the beer warms. Taste is of dark malt, dark fruit, cocoa powder, and roasted coffee beans. There is a mild roasty bitterness and alcohol warming in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a lower level carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good RIS with a nice historic element to it. I am very happy I was able to find a bottle of this after reading it was coming to the US."
""
"overall - good, but not sure why it's considered a classic."
""
"Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this. No, it's not a bad beer (in fact I can see why others love it), but it's amazingly bland for a 10% ABV beer in this style. I understand the push behind it, but it's not a particularly interesting RIS for me."
"D - Tragically, I think the 275ml serving size is a bit too small. I savored this for roughly a half-hour, but would have gladly appreciated another few ounces. I'm curious how the brett manifests over time, as it's already quite present. In any case, I'm glad they've resurrected this beer as it's quite unique and unlike almost anything I've had in recent memory."
"Overall – An interesting stout. Heavy in the dark fruits…more so than I have experienced in others. Honestly, not my favorite RIS."
""
""
"Hey there! Took me by surprise! Seriously! This is one amazing RIS! Great heat, delicate complexities, unfettered brand."
"A very nice RIS, Wells & Young have reignited the flame. This one will age nicely, there are still a few semi-rough edges to smooth out"
"This is a really good RIS. The nose was lacking just a bit but the flavors were really bold. Definitely a beer that seems like it would benefit from some age."
""
"pours beautiful, huge creamy mocha head, what a beer should look like. tastes huge chocolate malt bomb, incredible roast with perfect bitterness. yes a little smoke, amazing fruity finish. strong, smooth, rich, satisfying. the one was enough, but i could have had several. only drawback is the price."
""
"Poured into a snifter a deep cola brown with deep ruby hue,roasted malt,bitter chocolate,and alcohol soaked fruit in the nose.Rich tasting with a decent amount of booziness,highly roasted with chocolate undertones.A great imperial stout from an old school brewery in England,nice job here."
"Creamy and smooth milk chocolatey feel, pleasant residual mild hop bitterness in the background. Definite sipper, very smooth and easy drinking in small sips. Slight nuance of fruity plum in the aftertaste. Cocoa nibs and mild char. Rich and exceptionally smooth as mentioned before. Residual chocolate and dry ashy elements. Pretty nice stuff, glad it's seeing a new revival."
"Taste falters a bit, partly due to the drinkability and feel. Flavors are black fruit and red plum. Leather here and there. Soft raisin and hints of melon. But there is something thin going on here. Just when I think it's going to be thick and chewy, it dissipates. Tannin on the end. Bites without a dryness. Alcohol is high. Hoping age will make this beer better than good."
""
"O: Fantastic stuff, this beer incorporates an incredible depth of flavor. I will be buying as much as I can find and cellaring for as long as it stays good. 3-10+ years and I'm guessing it may go well further."
"Pours a very dark brown with a good light tan head and a nice cap and collar. The nose carries a good dose of chocolate and mild roast. A bit of malt sweetness then comes through in the flavor. Very nice for an English version of an RIS. Good creaminess throughout the feel. Quite chewy. Moderate alcohol. Winner of a beer."
"Poured from bottle into snifter glass. Pours a deep brown-black body along with a thick khaki head that leaves behind a nice coating of lacing throughout. Aromas of cocoa powder, espresso, roasted malts, lightly fruity hops, and some caramel. Flavors of cococa, espresso, and a dose of roasted malts. The hop presence provides a pinch of bitterness which was somewhat off putting for me. Smooth mouthfeel and evenly carbonated. Semi-dry finish. Lightly bitter in the finish. I can understand the British character here, but I do not see why this beer should be rated so high here. I've had numerous RIS brews worthy of much higher marks. Otherwise, a solid RIS for those looking for a nogstalic British character."

"An amazing Imperial Stout. By far the most complex and unique stout that I have ever had. Too bad it's pretty expensive."
"O: A nice imperial stout that is clearly British in character. Glad this has been revived and I hope it's offered for many years to come."
"Conclusion: I truly wonder if this is how the original Courage RIS tasted. If so, it was a groundbreaking beer in its day, and is still an excellent one now. I am very happy to see this brewed again, now all I need is for Thomas Hardy's Ale to be resurrected and will never ask for another beer-related miracle again! Sometime I will get a few more of these and let them age."
"Pours a dark brown with a one finger cocoa head. Great lacing for a 10% abv brew. Excellent nose with molasses, hops, dark fruit, caramel and slight alcohol present. Very balanced and aromatic nose. Taste follows the nose profile, with the exception of the hops.... Which are way out front on this beer. Feel is full with a big hops bite on this beer. Relatively dry finish for the style. Overall, a good beer- glad I got to try this one. Cheers!"
"o - Overall a very nice RIS. Very roasty and the taste has some nice vanilla to it as well. Would like to have it again."
""
""
""
"Beer is quite drinkable, for a 10% beer you'd never guess it, not a hint of alcohol or heat in the entire thing, medium bodied with a thinner finish, mild sweetness and bitterness on the finish, mostly from the roast. This is the re-release of this beer, as is my understanding, a very solid RIS. I enjoyed it and would have it again."
"The beer appears dark mahogany with a substantial beige head that leaves copious lacing on the tumbler. The aroma brings roast, dark fruit, malt, raisins, toffee. Nice flavor. The finish brings a healthy amount of hop bitterness. Prominent dark fruit with a strong hop presence in both the aroma and flavor. Unusual for the style and really delicious. Glad I was able to acquire some of this."
""
"A black abyss signalling black, dried fruits over rich, roasted malts in the nose. The light brown head lingers on and on while the taste of sweet, burnt bitterness infused with a welcoming alcohol warmth satisfies the palate. Yeah, baby! This is one mean, mutha of an imperial stout."
"O: Overall a very nice beer. Looks awesome in the glass. Falls a bit short of other imperial stouts but still a very solid offering. I'd try this again but the price is kind of high at $6.50 for 9.3 oz. Definitely glad I got to try this though. 4.5"
"O - One of the best RIS's I have tried to date, if you see it, buy two and cellar one, as it will get better with age. Awesome beer. So pleased that they decided to brew it again, It is a true classic."
"D: Very drinkable, but just a little underwhelming.  It's really neat to get to try this, but it wasn't quite as balanced as I was hoping it would be.  A bit of booze on the back end and a little sweeter than I would have liked.  Overall, though, it's a nice treat.  "

"Overall this is a great beer and I can see why it is considered a classic. I'm glad I bought more then one as this is something I can see my self drinking on a regular basis."
"Pours dark brown but looks black in the glass. A large very frothy tan head tops the beer, takes up 1/3 of the pour and just refuses to recede. Light smells all around. Coffee, roasted malts, and a chalky chocolate aroma comprise the nose. First sip is much more flavorful than the weak aroma indicated. Coffee leads the charge with chocolate that again is slightly chalky. There are some black licorice, vanilla, and dark fruits present too. Very well balanced. What really stands out is the mouthfeel. It is milkshake creamy and is truly amazing. I have not read Catherine the Great’s review but I hope she appreciated it in 1795 as much as I did in 2011."
"O: I was not impressed at all by the aroma, but the taste is quite nice. The aroma did seem to open up after a while. Not excellent, but a decent imperial stout."
"CHEERio! Beertracker"
"Poured from a 275 ml bottle into a tulip glass, 2011 version with a date of 9-19-24(?), I do know if this is a best before date or best after, but I doubt I hold onto a bottle for 12 years. This pours a little thinner than expected, but its a hazy yeast filled almost black color with a massive tan head (i had to wait several times for it to go down). The smells are of dark roasted malts, espresso, a little sweet dark fruit, and some alcohol. The feel is medium, a little thinner than some other irs, but still a tad creamy. The taste is pretty great, plenty of bitter hops and malts combined with a little sweetness and then a nice peppery finish, I'll probably get a couple more to save."
"Wonderful to see bottles of this in Atlanta. A beer I've been wanting to try for a long while. I wondered whether I'd be disappointed after the long wait, but no, this beer is superb. Pours an extremely dark brown, almost black, unless held up to the light. Short coffee crema colored head, but the head clings to the side of the glass in a sheet, not just rings. Smells of Christmas pudding cooked in a coal fired oven- slightly sooty and redolent of fruit and brandied cake. Dry and intense in flavor, tightly wound. Nice lingering, ashy bitterness with dry fruit notes, licorice, espresso, and bitter chocolate. Superb, and surprisingly bracing and dry with a bit of alcohol bite that is nevertheless integrated with the beer in the sense that it underscores the other flavors instead of dominating. A huge beer, and a great pleasure to drink."
"O-This is definately a brew that would age well and im glad ive got more than the one and look forward to seeing how it ages and if you find definately buy more than the one cheers."
"Nice to hold some brewing history in my hands, even if it isn't from the original re-brewers (read: not Wells/Young). It pours a straight onyx topped by a tall finger of dusty tan foam. The nose comprises dark chocolate, roasted malts, light molasses, and a touch of darkly-roasted coffee. Pretty dern British, so to speak (as far as stouts go). The taste brings in more of the same, with a touch of clove lying near the bottom of things. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a light carbonation and a creamy, smooth feel. Overall, this is a great-tasting stout that drinks way the hell too easily for anyone's own good. If this is anything like the older stuff, I will work my ass off to get a vintage bottle..."

"Overall this is an absolutely fantastic beer, probably the best non BA stout that I have had to date. Extreemly well balanced and complexed. Soo glad that they brought this one back and that I got to try it."
"**Tobacco notes open up as this beer warms. It just gets better and better."
"Worthy of it's reputation."
"Smoky aroma has a chocolate undertone and hints of molasses and coffee. It pours a rich, warm sable just a whisker above black and with a very thick, somewhat fluffy tan head that hangs around for a little bit. Flavor has elements of roast quality coffee, molasses and chocolate with a hint of licorice. There is some subtle sweetness and bitterness that balance each other nicely. Full-bodied texture is quite fizzy and a little syrupy - doesn't get any better. A truly worthy RIS."
"Getting to enjoy a glass of Courage Imperial Russian Stout was treat. I can definitely see what Katherine The Great saw in this fine brew."
""
"O: This was just a great beer. I wish I could find this beer more often and cellar a few. This is amazing"
"overall - hopefully ill get to try one about my age to compare, hah."
"93 Vintage bottle at Falling Rock this past Saturday during GABF. Had one along with Bardwashrind. Enjoyable brew. Pours a serious dark brown with a tan foamy head. Nose of cocoa, caramel, and dark fruits. Taste is similar to the nose with figs and dark chocolates wandering throughout each sip. Slightly sweet fig flavors on the backend. Light carbonation and oily mouthfeel. A nice stout for sure. Glad I got to try this one."
"Mouthfeel takes a hit for thinness, though it's not at all watery and would be difficult to have it be much thicker and work with the wine elements. This beer is a masterpiece. My only regret is that there's one less bottle in the world."
"I feel that this bottle wasn't aged as well as the 1983 vintage I had at Kulminator in 2008, although I liked the nose better."
"1993 vint. poured carefully into snifter. No head whatsoever. Tart, dried fruit up front with hint of sweet chocolat and molasses coming through. Soy and toasted oakiness on the way down as the booze warms the finish. Not much experience with beers half as old as myself but I really enjoyed the complexity of this treasure."
"An extremely interesting brew. I've always wanted to try something older than me, and this one has me beat by seven years! Not only has it held up well, but its actually a very pleasurable example of the style, and its neat to see a traditional take along the lines of the A LeCoq stout. Worth the expense."
"What can I say? I'm going to do my best to seek out more as this is one of the finest drinking experiences I've *ever* had. I'd LOVE to see Wells and Young's bring this beer back!"
"This beer is simply overwhelming. The drinkability is only hurt by the fact that I could only ever have one in one sitting."
"A hefty price to pay for such a rare treat...worth it."
"M = Full bodied,excellent mouthcoating, light carbonation but present."
"A classic, a true classic. Yes it is past its best. But it's still great. Damn you wells and youngs for retiring this beer."
"Notes from and tasted on 5/6/05"
"D: Production stopped in '93 (I believe). Definitely worth a taste, if you can get it. Very smooth beer, however may have been more prime 5 or so years ago."
"Chiii...rist. The vinegary-ness of the aroma is gone and completely overridden with thick bitter dark chocolate and fudge. Unbelievably malty and creamy thick mouthfeel. I've only had one other beer with malt sustance like this and it was Kuhnhenn (add any K-henn beer and there it be). Oxidation lends to a layer of dark fruit and then the same brandy grape, sherry flavors that prevail in the nose. Prune, black cherry, blackberry, mollasses, earth, manure, and leather and on and on. Immensely complex and very good. Would have loved to tried this 10 years ago."
"Aroma is heavy with wine/port like smells. A slight chocolate and some band aid in there too. Taste is port or sherry, salty with a bitter aftertaste that doesn't quit. Quite a unique experience. This beer has stood up well, but was obviously better years ago. Definitely a sipper."
"One of the much coveted and hard to get beers around. I was pretty pleased to be able to get my hands on 3 different vintages. Cracking open this one, I am getting strong vinous aged aromas fizzing out and also the familiar dark fruits namely dates, plums and raisins. But wait a minute.. this is a stout right? I do not get the roasted malts and stuff instead those aromas are typical of an aged strong ale. The taste starts off with a bitter note and ok now I think I can pick up slight hints of roasted malts but they are just too subtle. The dates, plums and raisins were showing up but without the familiar sweetness in most aged strong ale. There is a slightly sourish and vinous tartness throughout and the finishing was fairly dry and bitter. I am not really picking up familiar stout tastes in general and this taste is not bad but the tartness and sourness is a little on the strong side. Bitterness was significant but still within bounds. The after taste was rasiny and dates; not really lasting though I have some nice aromas on the nose as well. The mouthfeel was fairly thick with syrupy, watery smoothness and practically no carbonation. Drinkability slightly lowered due to the slightly high sour and tartness. Not really impressed but let's see what the other 2 vintages I have can offer."
"I'd have loved to try this while it was still in production, and whoever made the decision at Scottish Courage to stop production should be shot. Magnificent, but I can't help but reflect with incredible sadness upon the dwindling supply of this stuff in the world today, and the gradually declining quality of most of the bottles left. Get it now, it won't be here much longer."
"1983 bootle which was given to me as a gift from a fellow BA. Extremely unique in every way. Oldest beer I've had to date. Poured a deep dark brown, almost black with little head and not much lacing. The smell is powerful and complex as is the taste. Bitter chocolate, rasins, molasses, alcohol, coffee and a very pronounced red wine taste help make this easily the most complex beer I've had. Once you try it you won't soon forget it. Thanks Smalls!"
"If you have the chance, do not pass the opportunity to sample this great beer. Simply my favorite of all time. Cheers!"
"After 5.5 years had a fresh bottle(so cognac ageing not there yet as only year old) courtesy of Gary. Very creamy, light chocolate and roast. Very good, and uncomparable to the US versions."
" Tastes pretty oxidized. There are remnants of what I am sure was a great beer, but this bottle has turned. Somewhat chalky finish. Bad drinkability. Now that my review is finished, I am dumping the rest."
"Overall - Unfortunately this bottle was slightly past it's prime - maybe 2 or 3 years ago it would have been at its peak but this one just seemed a bit washed out... bland even. Glad i tried it though - especially to breath in the amazing aromas..."
"Flavor is big malt with molassess and chocolate dominant but also some soy sauce on the finish. Also a smoky, peaty, roasty lingering finish is present. SImilar to a glass of scotch. The brew is easy drinking with no hint of the ABV anywhere. Quite a nice score on the last weekend of a good beer bar. If you see it try it!"
"Drinkability: With this ABV and price tag ($45 for a 170 mL bottle), the drinkability is tough. As I stated though, I would have loved to have tried this 2 years ago."
"I have never had anything like it, and quite possibly never will again. At 12+ years old, it is afaik the oldest beer I have ever drunk as well."
"Body is medium, very slick and smooth mouthfeel, with a slippery, viscous texture."
"1989. Ebony pour, calm, still. Extremely oxidized nose, woody, vinous. Very complex fruitiness, plenty of grapes, marshmallow sweet aspects, mushroomy vegetal damp earth undertones. Very salty, soy-lkike. Sourish vinous palate, once again very salty, very woody, intense vegetal aspects. Surprisingly still some hops in there, powerful smoky oxidized finish. Medium bodied, rather slick. Interesting, I dont think this is one of the great vintages, but Id love to try one with less oxidation."
"A great drinking experience."
"1989 bottle  drank in 2004: Very dark beer with no head or carbonation. Aroma is mostly comprised of alcohol and a subtle smell of coffee. Taste can be described as a mix between roasted malts, coffee, subtle chocolate and ends with some bitterness and a warm alcohol taste. Very intriguing beer, it almost feel like a mix between an old ale (Gales Prize Old Ale) and a Russian Imperial Stout without extreme hops (Sam Smith Russian Stout) without any carbonation but with a good warming feeling from the alcohol as you drink this. I feel lucky I had the chance to taste this but a vertical tasting of this beer would be paradise"
"A Huge Thanks to fellow BA and Yorkshireman BSF for this one, delivered whilst we shared a brew at the Doncaster Beer Festival during my Easter trip to England. I am truly indebted to you for this master libation. Thank You, Thank You Sir; it has matured extremely well, no thanks in part to your master cellarmanship. I owe you a few Gallons of Timothy Taylors Landlord next year!!!"
"Lovely. Aged and molded. The flavor profile mainly consists of chocolate, cocoa and coffee. Dark fruits as well with notes of purple grapes, red apples and maple."
"A 1983 vintage I scored off ebay-'Not for consumption"" my ass!!!Great sounds of carbonation when I opened it.Poured jet black with a very slight head that remains all the way down.Extremely vinuous aroma.Plenty of black currant and raisens going on.Theres a slight metallic odor-while not unpleasant its right there in front.Some great port like flavor-a slight sourness throughout.Very grape like.Very bright and lively mouthfeel.Even with the sourness its quite smooth.Overall a fantastic beer.Even after 21 years its still quite something to behold.If you can find a bottle treat youself."
"1983 vintage sampled at the Kulminator in Antwerpen, Belgium. $4:-) From the mangled bottle pours forth one insanely good beer! Deeply dark and opaque with no hints of light showing through! A HUGE head of tan foam, that leaves excellent lacing, even after 21 years in the cellar. The aromas are heavenly, as this is the ultimate imperial stout. The aromas are all across the board and consist of currants, dark chocolate, pure cocoa, strong french coffee, pure unadulterated alcohol vapors, deeply roasted malts, lightly medicinal (orval-like) hops and more! The taste is so rich, so deep, and so endless, that it is hard to describe. The first thing that hits tongue is the deep coffee flavor, than the chocolate and malts come in with a one-two punch, than the hops and other herbal flavors come and linger on your tongue for an eternity. 21 years old and this is not oxidized one freaking bit. This beer is so old, that IT can legally drink itself in the states! The mouthfeel is so thick, creamy, and smooth, with no loss of texture after all of these years, and the drinkability is simply amazing. 10%+, you HAVE to be kidding me. Wow, i've always loved imperial stouts, and I thought that I have had some of the best imperial stouts out there....than, I had this. This is without a doubt the perfect imperial stout (and one of the oldest recipes is used as well). A classic amongst classics, and perhaps the best beer that I have ever had in my life...(it gives the St. Lamvinus a run for it's money, and this one was only $4!!!)You simply have to find a way to try a well-cellared example of this beer. I see them on eBay ocassionaly, so perhaps it is worth a try. If not, do have one when you get to the little piece of heaven that is the Kulminator in Antwerp. No wait, don't have any, save it all for me...PLEASE!"
"Gravity cask GBBF 2003- present vintage, this is definitely worth the bloody price. So rich and chocolatey, rich, yet smooth, very long finish. Really good stuff. wasn't as vinous, and salty as the 1985 bottle i had gad a week or so earlier. Less porty aged characters aswell. probably one of my favourite beers of the GBBF in 2003, extra special that it was on cask aswell, very exciting."
"This was a 6-pack of the 1983 picked up from the Kulminator in Antwerp, for $7! Thick black and wonderful looking, even after all these years. Tasted of sherry, burnt caramel, and raisin. Very full mouth feel, yet you could tell that the body has thinned noticeably with age. This beer has held up very well, despite being obviously oxidized. This in my opinion just added to the character and complexity of this beer."
"It is with sadness that I write this review. It doesn't appear that the '93 Courage Imperial will be able to age for 10 years. Hopefully, my bottle was an exception and there are still some quality bottles left. The appearance and aroma were fine, as I remember them from previous tastings, but the flavor has deteriorated greatly. The unique ""burnt currant"" has been replaced by a more acidic note. The complexity of flavor has dwindled into a single, basic flavor. There's not much left at all."
"Our pile of samples still had dust on them ... from like 10+ years ago."
