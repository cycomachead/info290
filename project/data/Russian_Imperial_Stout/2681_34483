Its far from a subjective perfect, but it is damn good. For anyone interested, the 2009 can I tasted from a few months back was among the tastiest non-BA imperial stouts I've ever tried. With just 18 months in the cellar, this one pours a deep, dark black with the viscosity of freshly changed motor oil cycled through a 30-year-old Buick for a few days. The nose reminds me of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. At this point I'm reminded of how much the head lingers and contributes to the heavy lacing, presumably due to the heavy body. Flavor-wise, there's a good amount of sweetness, with baking spices, honey and brown sugar at the forefront. There's also some chocolate, some coffee and some lingering floral hops. I couldn't drink this exclusively, nor could I drink it all day, but for an occassional treat, it really hits the spot.","HowardTheDuck","Mar 30, 2015"

Tastes sweet up front with a tangy, smoky malt with a hint of coffee, dark chocolate, and a bit leathery and smoke. Hops balance the sweetness with a pleasant mid note bite. Full bodies, creamy, a bit syrupy but not unpleasant – sweet finish. Overall a great winter warmer, meant to be sipped and savored. I was really surprised by how good it was, and I will make this a go to for warming up on a cold day.","ThaneMcC","Mar 07, 2015"

On the nose there's lots of Roasty Malt notes, Coffee, Chocolate and a light bit of Alcohol in the background. How does this beer taste? Where do I start?! Smokey flavours, Raisins, Roasty Coffee and Chocolate notes, Light toffee and a touch of sarsaparilla and molasses on the finish.

Trying Ten Fidy today was tie with Heady for being the most profound moment of my beer drinking experience.  Amazing beer!  Jet Black, toasty smell.  The taste and feel are what catapults this to the stratosphere - taste is creamy, chocolate, coffee.  The feel is like well carbonated motor oil that coats the mouth goes down ridiculously smooth for 10.5%!?!?!  There is no hint of alcohol at all.  Truly a glorious beer.

I am a hophead but open minded. The first time I had this beer wasn't expecting too much, esp from a can, and I wasn't well versed yet in Oskar Blues beers. Then bam!  Eyes opened, eyebrows raised and taken aback! Holy crap, what the heck is this???  Dark, deep robust, all the favors others describe. Dark look, nice pour, strong but smooth dark stout taste. This immediately became one of my top 5.  Amazingly well made beer, like liquid oil bliss in a can. I've had others of similar style, but this one stands out. I have since become a huge fan of Oskar Blues, almost all their beers are well made for each style. You gotta try this beer, even if strong beers are not your style, but, as with any beer per the style, keep an open mind. If you know beers well, you will appreciate how well this beer is made.","hotpauko","Jan 14, 2015"

Coffee notes comes out as this beer warms, with a rich, deep thick mouthfeel making for a very satisfying, sticky finish.

So thick and dark you cannot tell the carbonation level, but the head retention suggests fairly active. Smells of oatmeal, brandy, and decadent dark chocolate. On the nose, coffee and cream. Mid-palate some acidic coffee-- Ethiopian and Kona. Back palate deep cocoa and cooking chocolate-- heavy, deep, and bitter but not overwhelming. Tartness plays well against malty bread notes. Deep toffee. Vanilla. Some pepper and cream. So much going on. Every sip is another level. This is brilliance. This is the work of the Beer Gods. I'm finding hops and esters. Some raisins. A little brandy. Some oak and some smoke. The rabbit hole is deep. The alcohol is subtle. The smoothest stout at this ABV. Then the ABV hits your brain. Warm fuzz. Warm chest. I could go on. There is no point. Buy it. Experience it. Then put it on BA. 4.5 out of 5. Excellent. Recommended.","digitalflood","Dec 31, 2014"

This is Stout and dark beer season and that is a good thing.  Ten Fidy is a true treat of roasted chocolatey goodness.  The smell is amazing, but not quite as good as the taste.  Lots of roast, chocolate, molasses, coffee and a hop presence that cuts through this like a spotlight on a dark night.  It looks like a glass full of black paint with a nice rich brown head that leads to some very full lacing.  The mouthfeel is thick, just what I want from a stout.  You can tell that there is alcohol, but it's partially hidden behind the rich smoky flavors.  The dark night just got a little warmer.  This is very complex and best of all, very enjoyable.","SFNC","Nov 08, 2014"

4.75,8.4,,,,,,"This is my favorite Imperial Stout.  Its appearance is stunning - PITCH black and with a beautiful dark khaki head.  It has a HUGE amount of all the flavors and aromas that you expect from an Imperial Stout - dark chocolate, coffee, earthy hops on the finish.  Ten FIDY balances these flavors extremely well.  What sets this beer apart for me is the mouthfeel and the alcohol burn.  It has a thick, velvety mouthfeel that has no equal in my experience.  The alcohol is hidden by the huge malt bill, but you can feel it burn ever so slightly.  Ten FIDY has absolutely mastered this understated burn; it's tantalizing and entices you to keep sipping it.  I often take 2 or more hours to get through 12 ounces; it's worth it to savor it as long as you can.","2014LM2X1","Oct 13, 2014"

The taste is big, with lots of black licorice, coffee, slight cocoa flavor, raisins, with some piney bitterness. The alcohol was also present in the taste, not surprising for a 10.5% beer.

The taste is pretty pleasing, this is a robust and flavorful stout make no mistake about it that this beer will take over your palette in a very good way. There are definitely noticeable chocolate, coffee and caramel flavors in this beer and they are blended just right. This is a complex beer that drinks very well. The can indicates a 10.5% ABV yet the taste is smooth and slightly sweet,I liken this to a ""velvet hammer"" or a robustly mellow hit to the taste buds, if that's even possible...yes it is! Excellent beer, I will definitely drink it again. If you like stouts it would almost be criminal not to try this one. Two thumbs up as this beer definitely pushes the envelope. The folks in Colorado at Oskar Blues have a winner on their hands, I'll definitely be tossing more of these back...Long Live Ten Fidy Imperial Stout.","JDOHare","Oct 07, 2014"

Dark as night yet not super thick and offensive as some stouts can be.  Tasted it at a brew event last night and out of the at least 20 beers (8 stouts) I tried, this was the best by far.  It kicked my ass and I loved every second of it.  The Oskar Blues rep gave me a generous pour and I went right back for more.  Heavy malty chocolate flavor with a sweet smoke behind it.  Slight hints of dark fruit and hops.  Excellent mouth feel; no sourness or bitterness.  A+ beer all the way.  If you have the chance to try this handcrafted beauty, please your tastebuds and do it!","BeerSnobRobinson","Oct 02, 2014"

Smell is of roasted grain, dark chocolate, espresso, toffee, oak, and some smokey charred earthiness.  Taste is amazing, so complex.  Big wave of sweet and bitter chocolate, toasted grain, smoke, anise, espresso in the finish and that lingers with an oaky earthy edge.  Creamy and thick as can be, leaves the palate coated.  This is just an amazing stout all the way through.  I enjoyed this one aged exactly one year to the day.  Canned 9/19/13 and drank 9/19/14.  Still one of my favorite beers of all time and a pricey indulgence I'll spend my money on from time to time.","HopBomb515","Sep 19, 2014"

4.75,8.4,,,,,,"Another imperial stout.  I have a stout problem.  Pours to a dark solid dark brown, almost dark black cherry.  Full finger of draft brown head.  Aromas of chocolate and coffee.  Smell complex layers malt.  Taste biscuit layers of dark roasted malts.  Chocolate and coffee again.  Good European coffee.  Italian.  Hides the potency and alcohol really well.  Like an American breakfast stout on steroids.  Really clean and smooth.  Like a twenty something year old seriously on his game in a bar.  Can't describe how good this is.  My new favorite imperial stout.","uvachief","Sep 11, 2014"

I've always held Stone's offering of this style in the highest regard, but I think it has been replaced. I don't know what the folks down at Oskar Blues are doing, but they're doing it right. Every aspect of this brew is so powerful and each flavor is so intense that it borders unbearable, but then it transitions into something new and it just all adds up to a divine experience. I'm simply in awe right now, and slightly sad that I've taken the last sip whilst typing my conclusion... If you haven't had this yet, stop what you're doing right now and buy it.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 17, 2014"

Normally I only look at bottles) and although you can't beat tap the cans are still better than whatever is in second.

Nice boozy nose up front with chocolate and roasty malts on the back. Taste is pretty consistent with the smell. A bit of booze with nice dark chocolate and burnt caramel on the finish.

4.2,-4.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce can into snifter, canned on 9/16/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of big dark/roasted malt notes with light-moderate fruitiness; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, caramel, molasses, raisin, plum, light char, and roast/toasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, caramel, molasses, light char, raisin, plum, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate fruitiness; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors and light-moderate fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 10, 2014"

It took me 40 minutes at regular room temp (approx 70) to get this to 50 degrees. It was worth the wait.

My first Oskar Blues beer and I am impressed to say the least. Smells of coffee, vanilla, and maybe dark fruits. Tastes of chocolate, molasses, roasted malts, coffee, and some toffee. A chewy, sticky mouthfeel that is extremely easy to drink and oh so smooth. The ABV is very well hidden yet there is an alcohol burn that's present at the end. Oskar Blues hit this stout right out of the park. I've been looking forward to trying this one and I was not disappointed. Became more enjoyable as it warmed and I can't wait to find this stout again. Superb!","dpgoblejr","Apr 08, 2014"

Mild nose of chocolate, roast and a touch of dark fruit over an alcohol base. Full bodied with a thick creamy texture. Below average carbonation level with no effervescence on the finish. The exceptional flavor profile is complex and balanced. It begins with a blend of chocolate and roast, flows into a touch of smoke and dark fruit then finishes with molasses. The finish is quite smooth and leaves you with a pleasant bite of hop bitterness and alcohol.","tillmac62","Apr 02, 2014"

Flavors are a bit more subdued than the aroma, which is good in the case of the alcohol heat. I get much more chocolate and deep roasted malts and a lot less hop character, as well. I get a good bit of fruity esters as well, which gives off some gummy bear quality. Mouthfeel is full and fairly creamy, with a bit of prickliness at the end of each sip.

Really couldn't offer another example that mimics this flavor profile and quality in which it uses these flavors.  Only thing keeping this from being a higher score for me is the huge emphasis on the roasted malt and the bitterness (almost smokey) it adds. I enjoy that aspect, but I don't love it and there isn't something else really balancing that out.  Overall though, this is must have beer and its worth the somewhat steep price tag.","CTbrew32","Feb 11, 2014"

The taste was strong with malt and chocolate, and I could taste the alcohol on the back end, but it didn't linger as long as I would expect. Definitely one of my favorites.

The beer poured a deep dark black color with some thickness (although I remembered it being a bit thicker in previous tastings) with a small about of drank brown lacing that dissipates very quickly. The aroma is of dark fruits, rich dark chocolates, espresso, and roasted malts. The taste, which mirrors the marvelous smell, is extremely satisfying with it's complex mixture of chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, dark fruits, toffee, and even a subtle hints of mocha and sweet chocolate. Rich and full flavored from first to last sip. I am extremely found of this beer, haven't had it and sometime but it is just as good now as it was the first time I had it.

Between Ten Fiddy, G'Knight, and Deviant Dales I have to say they are a pretty solid brewery. And I love that they come in cans and I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've ever poured a true heavy duty stout from a can. Ten Fidy pours pure opaque black with just some hints of orange tinge on the edges. Very thin khaki head that quickly dissipates to a thin halo around the edge of the glass. Smell is mostly dark chocolate, mocha, brown sugar and fairly mild as stouts go. Taste is fantastic! Pretty straightforward, chocolate and brown sugar up front, with toasted coffee and malts finishing it off. The coffee really lingers which is great. No booze what so ever. Mouthfeel is creamy, but lighter than most RISs or heavy stouts, and the higher than average carbonation really brings to life the bitter of the coffee and keeps the sweetness subdued. Overall, supremely drinkable and a very solid stout. Not too sweet, some good alcohol warmth in the gut, great coffee flavor, and no metallic hints even poured from a can. Very, very good!","Samuel906","Jan 04, 2014"

This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth for the style, clean, creamy, a little filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, this might be one of the most drinkable RIS's I've had, I could get in some trouble with this beer since I don't think it would be pretty easy for me to drink a few of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it may be the best mouthfeel I have encountered in an RIS and it has everything that I would want in the style. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change. I would for sure buy this beer again, I will be picking up some more next time I go to the store so I can throw some in the cellar and see how it develops over time, it's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it. I would for sure recommend this to anyone who likes the style, this is a pretty great example of an RIS. All in all i was very happy with this beer and I think it's safe to say it lived up to my expectations. I still think Founders Imperial Stout is my favorite RIS, but I think this one is close to be as good and I would say it's up there as one of the better RIS's I have had. Great job guys, I really enjoyed this beer and this is another beer that I will anticipate the release of, keep up the good work guys. This is now my favorite Oskar Blues beer.","StoutHunter","Oct 28, 2013"

Pours like motor oil, tastes like heaven. Ten Fidy stands out in so many ways: the beautiful black can, the nearly complete lack of carbonation, the amazing flavor that effectively hides the 10.50% alcohol. Like many imperial stouts, I always get a hint of cherry on the finish of this one. The only knock I have is this: while this is my favorite imperial stout, I'm completely terrified of aging it because of the packaging. I've never gotten a good answer on how cans hold up over time.","EmpiricalBill","Sep 25, 2013"

Aroma is black licorice, cherry Twizzlers, maple and brown sugar oatmeal. Taste upfront is oily and velvety on the palate with chocolate milk, espresso gelato but then goes to dry, bittering hops and ends with a long, dry, roasted barley and raw cocoa finish. Not a super outstanding impy but the best RIS on the planet that comes out of a can so that deserves some bonus points.","tarheels86","Sep 25, 2013"

The beer has a very roasty smell with hints of dark chocolate sweetness to it. The beer also has a cocoa note that mixes well with the roast and dark chocolate sweetness. The beer taste is very roasted with cocoa and bit of dark chocolate swimming underneath of all the other notes. The aftertaste is very bitter, which is similar to the rest of the beer. Additionally, the earthy hops also make an appearance to offset the malts, cocoa, and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with some biting carbonation. While it is smooth, the beer also has a bit of texture to it as well. Overall, a fantastic beer that I come back to every winter and it still hasn't lost its appeal.","HattedClassic","Aug 27, 2013"

The appearance was like motor oil, with hardly any head. What the head did compose of was dark bubbles with more of an aroma of coffee. The first sip gave me a roast forward taste followed by notes of chocolate. Mouthfeel on it was quite amazing too, which was very very sludgy. Overall it was a very good beer and I love me some Ten Fidy!","ScaryHairy44","Jul 12, 2013"

My only worry is that, at ~$5/can, it's going to lose out due to being twice the price of Old Rasputin. It's also a bit more expensive than Stone IRS, but I believe this is the better beer.","jdhowe","Jun 10, 2013"

A quick swirl coats the sides of my glass. As expected from an imperial stout, the aroma has a powerful roasted malt character with a significant backbone of dark chocolate and just enough alcohol to let you know this beer isn't effing around. The taste backs up the smell and then some. Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, a hint of alcohol, a moderate sweetness, and just enough hops to balance it all out. Ten Fidy is heavy but not too much so. It's a thick velvety liquid that coats my mouth like fine grade A maple syrup. As the first sip touched my lips my stubble grew to a beard that would make a Viking blush, my wife became instantly 6 months pregnant, my enemies felt a chill run up their spines, and a battle ax appeared before me. This is a mans beer. On the can a message reads, ""this dog'll hunt."" And it will.","ZDub","Apr 12, 2013"

While this beer was found to be chokingly laden with shoyu qualities when it was young, it wears its maturity well in its fourth year. The heavy-handedness of its origins will never fade entirely, but this sample's profile falls well within the accepted--if not preferred--parameters of the style.

The smell is huge - bitter dark chocolate and coffee, and a nearly dominating grapefruit and pine hop character. Some chocolate covered tart cherries as well - serve as the middle man between the coffee/chocolate and hops. Taste is incredible - full and vibrant. Dark roast coffee beans, chocolate, hop bite, burnt caramel. Very bitter and sweet beer, in fact. Amazing, super delicious stuff.","timc100","Mar 17, 2013"

4.65,6.2,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Smell is great. Taste is dark and is very balanced between coffee, normal stout flavors, and a hint of sweet/chocolate. Incredibly smooth. Easy to drink a lot. Hits pretty hard with the high ABV. One of the better Stouts I've ever had (and Stouts are my favorite type of beers)! Only thing better I've had so far is Founders CBS + KBS, Bolt Cutter, and maybe 1 or 2 others I can't remember off the top of my head. It's REALLY GOOD! But the one thing I noticed is that it doesn't have anything unique or that stands out, just really really solid, smooth, great tasting stout! Get SOME!!!","FoundersFanatic","Mar 13, 2013"

4.46,1.8,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pours an opaque, very dark brown, with a diminutive light mocha colored head that dissipates quickly. If the head was a bit larger, and I tried to create that with my pour, and long-lasting, this would have been an extraordinarily gorgeous beer. As it is, it's just really, really sexy. The nose is huge chocolate with some British yeast notes wafting at times. The mouthfeel is creamy and viscous. It dries out like Baker's chocolate at the finish. There's also a bit of carbonation bite that occurs late. The flavor is a bit lacking. There's definitely some dark cholcolate, a bit of lactose, and some tart cherry that emerges in the middle and lingers after all else has passed. Some coffee bitterness is also noted after the beer has been swallowed. This is a very good RIS, but not as good as, say, Old Rasputin.","DocJitsu","Feb 02, 2013"

Big, malty, chocolate-forward flavor...dark cocoa, toasted caramel, subtle vanilla, bread, and some coffee bitterness. Purply berries, raisins, vinous notes, and hint of port in the end. Properly viscous and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation and bitterness to keep things lively, but not get in the way.

Stout bitterness combines with the smooth and silky body of a classic RIS. There is definitely some mild chocolate notes present as well as a hint of raisins and other dark fruits. The finish is roasty and bitter with only a trace of alcohol present. This is a complex offering that hides its powerful 10.50% ABV very well. Tasty and dangerous!","57md","Jan 21, 2013"

I would definitely recommend this to someone interested in getting into the style, because it’s not too sweet or syrupy but it’s also not so distastefully charred and bitter as some can be. But the earthiness mentioned above, which is like the intersection of the chocolate flavor and the hop component of the beer, is what really gets me—it adds a very nice depth to the experience.

Taste is as good as it gets with a huge chocolate front that is followed by a heavy roasted grain coffee finish. Hops are plentiful but because of the huge sweetness of the malt they are balanced to the point of playing second fiddle leading into a coffee like finish. The wonderful blend of dark and chocolate malts just lays the floor on this one. A touch of licorice. Finish is surprisingly clean and dry with an extra bold coffee taste lingering. A touch of grapefruit skin as well. Feel is smooth and chewy while remaining light enough to drink way to fast. Satin on the tongue with a perfect and subtle carbonation. One of the best RIS I've ever had. No barrel needed, just vision and expert brewing. WOW!","scootny","Jan 02, 2013"

Taste is just as roasty as the aroma. Like burnt chocolate underneath milk chocolate. I get a little alcohol presence, a bit harsh before fading quickly. Some burnt toast follows with dark chocolate. This thing is seriously chocolatey. There is just enough hops to bitter out the dark chocolate: they work in tandem. Great finish, slightly dry. No wonder this is so highly rated.

There is a zesty hint of some sort of citrus fruit tucked away in there somewhere, too. Now for the first sip... after a big mouthful I pause to take in just how rich and overwhelming this is! It's like a mouthful of devil's food cake. I actually pick up very sweet cherries initially, before the roasted, doughy chocolate and espresso flavors wash over it. Still, in the finish the cherries and bittersweet hops sneak out for a second. As the beer coats my mouth and goes down, it is very warming with the alcohol presence very apparent. Although being full-bodied is an understatement here as well, I can't put it down. One of the best stouts I've ever had. Not for those who are intimidated by very big beers.","Neorebel","Dec 04, 2012"

4.63,5.7,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall / Drinkability: What an amazingly rich stout! I can see why people rave about this one. A slow sipper on a cool fall night (and would be good this winter, good thing that I bought a 4 pack) and I think would be great with food. I had it with a banana butterscotch muffin at the end and it paired pretty well. Definitely a one at a time beer - the ABV is notable pretty quickly on after starting to drink this one. It warms you up. I can't say I want another one right away....and yet....I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to go to work in the morning. One does sate though. Overall I'm very impressed with this beer from start to finish and I will definitely have to hunt this one down again when its in the area.","damndirtyape","Nov 04, 2012"

As it warms the chocolate becomes stronger and more upfront than the coffee and a little something else shows itself in the middle there, perhaps molasses?

While some RISs display lots of burnt fruit flavors, this one is all about coffee and chocolate. It's almost like drinking AleSmith's Speedway Stout.

Thick and without bubbles till you get to the top of the glass and there is develops some serious tan head that reminds me of maple syrup and only appears as a skim and fades away quick. I can’t see within the beer to report on haziness, etc… but I can tell you that there are little bubbles bouncing to the tops of the beer to refill the ring of lacing. When the beer is given a swirl it leaves long hill-like patterns of alcoholic legs along the sides. The beer smells fat with charred wood, charcoals, and a heady dark chocolate hiding behind everything. The booze also peak through slightly with a spicy slight burn at the end of the whiff. The smell in many ways reminds me of Paradox Isle of Arran by Brew Dog. The beer tastes fat and oozing with roasted coffee and sweet charred wood. The aftertaste resonates with dark chocolate, some slight charred wood and an oh-so-slight burn to remind you of this beer’s ABV. From the can the beer tastes mildly sweeter with a mellowing of the charred wood and more of a sweet boozy taste. This beer seems to taste better in the glass overall than in the can for me. The mouthfeel of this beer is heavenly. As I said before it is fat and oozing on the tongue. It is beyond-velvet smooth as it oozes through your mouth and it runs down the throat like molasses. This beer leaves the mouth high and dry and begging for more with only faint wisps saliva on the tongue trying vainly to put out the smoky chocolate fire in your mouth. Overall this beer lives up to its reputation, it was a delectable sipper that holds up to the Founder’s Breakfast Stout that I had last week. This beer in many ways reminds me of Paradox Isle of Arran beer without the bourbon flavor linger. This is a fantastic Russian imperial stout and is well worth a drink.","Maxwell","Aug 26, 2012"

The thing I really liked upon tasting this beer was the complexity - very chocolatey and thick, charcoal, molasses - and it subdued the alcohol well.

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of dark roasted barley malts, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. It's mildy sweet smelling as well. The taste follows the nose. There are dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, and alcohol featured prominently in the flavors. The hops are also present on the back end to balance some of the malty sweetness. The aftertaste is mildly of coffee and chocolate. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. It's creamy, but not too filling. The drinkability is very high for a style generally more suited for sipping. It's full of flavor and very easy to drink for such a big beer.

It was as dark as used motor oil and had the same relative thickness. A slight mocha colored head formed at the top of the drink. Aromatic impressions included dark chocolate and burned malts, though the scents were light. The initial taste was a spicy dark chocolate with hints of dark fruits and the burn of tobacco. The smooth maltiness coats the tongue nicely. Tart flavors really hit the sides of the tongue nicely. These flavors are allowed to linger with the lack of strong carbonation. The aftertaste is moderately warming, lingering several minutes in the throat before fading. The dark chocolate continues in the aftertaste with hints of prune and a certain degree of chalkiness.

Motor oil dark with a nice 2 finger mocca head. Good spotting and lacing throughout. Looked great in the new snifter. Smell is a chocolate bomb with some coffee notes. Very inviting on the nose and couldn't stop enjoying the aroma. Taste follows the nose with initial chocolate followed by some coffee and sweet dark fruits. Thought it would taste more bitter chocolate or over the top, but it was a nice blend and a true RIS. Feel is creramy/silk with adequate carbonation and full bodied. Overall- A great RIS with just the right amount of chocolate/coffee/figs/fruits/malts and hops. It hides the 10.5% ABV well, but it's a sipper for a chilly evening. Not over the top which is a nice touch. Top notch-","TheDinger","Apr 07, 2012"

Poured with a nice 2 finger thick foamy head, that slowly dropped down to a thin layer with good cling. Aroma was sweet, slightly lactosey like a milk stout. Hints of brown sugar and coffee, almost a mocha undertone. Flavor was sweet and creamy. Very well balanced, not at all acidic. Seemed like a slightly burnt milk stout. A little thin in the mouth, didn't cling at all like I would have expected it to. Not terribly so. Overall a damn good stout, and damn good stout in a can.

Smell is nice and roasty, big bittersweet chocolate presence, some burnt malt comes through as well. Taste is roasty with tons of chocolate, coffee, bakers chocolate flavour leaves a nice bitter edge, comes off pretty hoppy at points as well. Thick and full feel, incerdibly smooth, light carbonation makes this really easy to sip. Great stuff, a solid imperial stout, certainly something I will have to get more of.","peensteen","Feb 27, 2012"

When i popped the tab, I thought the beer might be flat, as there was no release of pressure. Upon pouring it into a pint glass, the motor oil appearance got my hopes up a bit; though I was concerned by the lack of head. All doubts were put aside on the first taste. Caramael, roasted malt, chocolate, as each sip went down, I waited for the usual let-down of excitement or back-end bitterness... That never happened. This beer is incredible! Thank you Oskar Blues for bringing this stout into the world! Oskar Blues is not currently distributed in Ohio, so I will seek it out in my travels. Cheers.","Lynn","Feb 26, 2012"

Big roastiness out front, with dark chocolate and light smokiness pushing into a slight hop bitterness in the background, with a slight alcohol burn in the finish.

At $15 for a four pack of bland looking cans, you really go out on a limb hoping that this oddly named brew will be good, and it delivers. It pours out of the can black as crude oil. A thin mahogany brown head rises to the surface. The aroma is mellow, pleasant to draw in. There is an amazing feel to the first sip, it coats your mouth like a vanilla malt. The flavor is well balanced, long and luxurious, super smooth. The balance is the key, the flavor is not overwhelming at any point, but very satisfying for the whole experience.

The aroma is tons of strong roasted malts and a hint of alcohol. Not a lot of nuance but pleasant. Taste is more of the same, pretty straightforward, lots of roasted, chocolately malt with a touch of acridness and a good dose of warming alcohol that manages to avoid being harsh. Carbonation is medium-low which gives a good smooth and full mouthfeel. Overall this is a super nice, very accessible RIS, it lacks some of the complexity of its more specialized brethren but it does not disappoint.","quirkzoo","Nov 30, 2011"

4.5,2.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours jet black with a creamy two finger tan head that seems to be sticking around. There was a nice cascading effect as the head was forming. Aroma is much more coffee/espresso centric than I remember it. Still a great smell though with caramel, vanilla, chocolate, and dark fruits coming through. A tinge of alcohol on the nose. Taste is like the smell. Tons of espresso and dark chocolate coming through. There is definitely a licorice or dark fruit behind the espresso and chocolate. A nice overall bitterness to keep this from being too sweet. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and carbonation is mild. Overall, the perfect representation of an RIS. I remember tasting a lot of caramel in the last session about a year ago. I would have liked to seen a more pronounced caramel flavor, but this is an amazing beer.

My can had little to no carbonation but a very smooth mouthfeel. i was surpised also to see that this was a 10.5%er because i dont taste the booziness at all. Overall I would have to say that although this beer was good i was hoping for more. It had the feeling of a highly hyped pay per view event that ended in the first ten seconds. Leaving you with the sense of "" i paid how much for that!"" Im not saying that i dont like this beer i do, maybe it was my can, maybe it was my mind hyping this beyond what it could produce.

It coats your tongue and the walls of your mouth in all kinds of goodness. The can looks so bad ass and ominous, yet what's inside is so subtle and nuanced, it's really a lamb in a lion's suit.

Almost no carbonation, very thick and full mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth. A sipper despite the smoothness. This is almost over the top for me. I like it, but even a 12 ounce can is almost too much. It's just SO heavy. I find more drinkability in WWS than this. If ever I was curious as to what the inside of a black hole tasted like, this would be it. Very glad I got to try this.

4.25,-3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O - Really quite brilliant. The best canned imperial stout in the world! It holds its own against the greats of the category. While it'll never be Hunahpu or any of the other titans, it is definitely on the short list for best widely-available stout. If the price came down a bit, it'd be a big competitor for Old Raspy.

This beer pours out as black as a moonless night in an abandand coal mine. The thick black liquid chugs it's way out of the can as a dark brown head forms on top. The smell of the beer is very roasted and has just a touch of dark berry and hop aroma mix with a ton of molasses. The taste of the beer is very rich, it's deeply roasted with a subtle sweetness up front that fades into a burnt bitterness in the end. The taste in the middle is kind of earthy. The mouthfeel is very thick indeed. Overall it's a really damn good Russian Imperial Stout. really worth looking into.","Knapp85","Jun 13, 2011"

The brew has a deep roasted character,there a flavors of coffee grinds and expresso with a slight bitterness that gives way a little malty sweetness and dark chocolate on the finish .This beer is well balanced,no flavor really overpowers the rest.

Upon first sip I'm hit with loads of smooth bitter chocolate and a nice malt sweetness. I'm left with a really nice lingering aftertaste. The alcohol doesnt seem to come through at all on this brew, and at 10.5 percent, that's saying something. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, but the carbonation is lacking a bit. I don't expect a huge head for this style of brew, but this was a bit unexpected. In the end, the lack of carbonation on the brew really doesn't turn me off all that much, it's still a fantastic Imperial Stout. And, with the expansion of canned craft beer, I'm definitely excited to see more great brews like this one from Oskar Blues.","ddahlen","May 27, 2011"

The menu said that ""there are few beers that make us say HOLY SHIT""...well, now I understand why the kind folks at Holy Smoke included that as part of the menu description. Let me state that I am NOT a huge fan of RIS. I'll try, and usually enjoy, anything; but if I had my pick, I'd go with a Kolsch. The RIS anti-thesis. But this beer blew me away. The head was so dark, heavy and rich that it gave off a purple hue. The color of the beer was as dark as anything I've ever seen. Smell was to die for. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, a good stout should have. Coffee, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, caramel. At 10.5, I wasn't knocked over by the smell or taste of alcohol. Smoooth...and the perfect ending to a fine BBQ meal and four tasting flight.","Ralphs66","May 26, 2011"
4.37,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours out thick and viscous, motor oil consistency, with a dark tan frothy layering that forms rather quickly, then fades to a wispy covering. Smells of raisin, chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toffee, and alcohol. Taste manages to mimic the aroma fairly well. Raisins and plums hit the palate in a thick caramel sweetened blast of flavor. Roasted malts and bakers chocolate manage to break through heavily, with a slightly smokey character. Slight astringency mingles with the hefty booze presence, followed by a hint of bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Coffee and toffee appear after each sip to accent tje slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is heavy and thick. Creamy character with moderate carbonation. Overall, this viscous oil like concoction is amazing and multifaceted.

The smell and mouthfeel are incredibly strong and are certainly the highlights of this beer. The taste is much sweeter than I expected, but towards the finish it becomes much more bitter. There is a mocha/caramel sweetness to Ten Fidy that I haven't had in any other stout. Definitely one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts I've ever had.","Rootdog316","May 23, 2011"

Taste is bittersweet chocolate, a little vanilla toffee and heaven. Coats your mouth and hangs for a bit and finishes with a little bitter to balance out the sweet. So good, would be dangerous if I had access to this all the time.","mizzouguy","May 14, 2011"
4.45,1.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: This goes directly into the top 10 Imperial stouts that I've had list. Quite amazing, and the most complex and stunning thing about this is the nose.","Krakistophales","May 13, 2011"

What I am sure of is that this was far too bitter for my liking and way too overdone on the chocolate. I didn't get any of the coffee notes others were finding. I wanted to like this, I really did as I enjoy Imperial Stouts quite bit...I just couldn't force myself to enjoy it....it got a little less harsh on the bitter chocolate as it warmed but then the booze just took the reigns from there. Either something was up with my can or I just don't care for this brew. Different folks have different tastes and I just don't share others infatuation with this beer...I can think of a handful of RISs that I would rather have for less dough.

I'm holding it up to the brightest lamp in the room, and absolutely NONE of the light penetrates this beer! Aroma is surprisingly faint, but has hints of unsweetened dark chocolate & black coffee. 1st sip is surprisingly sweet...more dark chocolate, black coffee, malt roasted almost to the point of being ""burnt", and a slight hint of smoke. On the swallow, there is a bitterness of alcohol and the the dark chocolate/coffee notes with a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, silky, and thick...the consistency of syrup or honey. Overall?

A common theme throughout this tasting was that this beer is highly boozy. They don’t try to hide this point, but rather play to it. In the aroma the fusels are well integrated into the heavy, dark malts, while in the taste, there is enough push from the background to keep it from being unmanageable. Each sip brings a stickiness to the lips, with generous coating throughout the mouth. All of these characteristics help to bring the beer to its full potential, and make it greatly enjoyable all around.","TheBrewo","Apr 27, 2011"

There was a thin, chocolate colored head that lasted about thirty seconds, and then it retreated to just a ring of film. The beer has aromas of coffee and toffee, but also some booze. The flavors are milk chocolate, coffee, and smoke. Some bits of sweet malt/molasses and some bitter characteristics, as well, and of course a bit of alcohol. As it warms, you get some dark fruity sweet flavors, also. The beer is heavy and thick in mouth. Very viscous and lingering in the mouth, which is fantastic given the amazing flavor combination. The finish is creamy and smooth, despite the alcohol flavors. Aftertaste of bitter coffee. The beer is extremely smooth and easy to drink, and fabulous on a cold night.

It tasted sweetly bitter with a coffee flavor at first and finished with a nice bitter-smooth flavor of coffee and chocolate that stayed with you for a nice while.

While thick, the alcohol content is still present along with licorice, molasses, and espresso flavors. This is a sipping beer and in my opinion the epitome of what an imperial stout should be.

It pours very thickly, deep black, with a tiny collar of dark tan foam that leaves a bit of lacing. Lots of hops in the nose give way to very roasty dark malts that contribute bitter chocolate, coffee and blackberry. The flavor starts with charred malt, almost too much so, with tobacco and old leather that then moves to green, citric and spicy hops which shift the balance too far to the bitter and hoppy. Very thick and full, dry and rich, with a long bitter finish. The alcohol is very well-hidden, but this style should be more about the malts than the flavor and bitterness of the hops.","mmmbeer","Jan 24, 2011"

Pitch black glass of stout. No light shines. A finger thick milk chocolate head crowns this midnight oil. The smell is big for a stout, chocolate covered cherries and peanut butter, with some coffee. The taste is very nutty, with bittering hops, then peanuts, dark chocolate, some sour cherries and a dark roast coffee finish.

Intense, dense, deep down hazelnut-coffee-roasty aroma - wouldn't quite add chocolate to that yet. Those roasty coffee notes really do dominate here, though not actually smelling like real java was added - amazing. Add to the joe, a little bit of cocoa in the taste and a whole lot of subtly sweet cream - this drinks/feels almost like a milkshake - how the hell did they do that?!

Definately opens up with the alcohol as it warms. Mouthfeel is super thick and coating. I can only have one of these but will go back for more when I recover from this one.

There's a half-finger head from an absurdly aggressive pour (about 2 feet from can to glass). Wish there was more head, it's a beautiful cedar-colored bubbly layer that sat around atop the beer for about 30 seconds. Smells as dark as it looks, with mocha, dark chocolate, and roasted grain dominating the nose. The first sip is predictably thick. There's a massive roasted barley flavor, coffee & dark chocolate blending into sort of a mocha character that finishes bitter and warm.","TJBAIHWL","Nov 07, 2010"

Taste is phenomenal, a little bit of everything you would expect. Predominately cocoa and sweet/roasted malts with nice hints of espresso and some faint charred notes. Full bodied to say the least.

Prunes and raisins also show themselves. I also get an overall sweetness that has hints of both chocolate and vanilla. The alcohol is pretty well hidden.

The nose is simple but awesome, super rich dark chocolate and a very smooth, but noticeable warm alcohol sensation. The nose did not prepare me for the blast of pine and hop bitterness on my first sip, and to be honest I prefer my stouts with a little less prominent hop influence and to be all about the malt. Not to worry though, there's still the megaton of dark chocolate promised by the aroma, and the alcohol is a bit less pronounced (though still present, and not necessarily a bad thing). The mouthfeel is absolutely luxuriant, spot on low end of the spectrum carbonation and probably the thickest, chewiest stout I've yet encountered (and this is not a bad thing).

The carbonation slowly fights through the thickness to provide the full body feel. Big dark roasted malt flavor with a very smooth finish.

Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch brown head. Head retention is decent, with a small amount of lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and some dark fruit and licorice. Great malty aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, coffee and a bit of dark fruit. Starts off sweet, and then has a slight bitter roasty finish. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's velvety, sticky and creamy. Drinkability is pretty good, it's nice and smooth and very easy to drink.

The nose isn't very strong buy familiar RIS smells peer through; dark fruits, cocoa, and a hint of coffee. Dark fruits are most prominent and I feel like I'm really fishing for other aromas. Roasted malts and coffee take charge in the flavor. This beer is hot. I really tasted the alcohol and it lingers all throughout my mouth. After another sip and I notice more dark fruit characteristics, especially on the finish. Mouth feel is pretty nice but the burn makes it tough to really appreciate. This guy is a sipper, and I kind of regret opening this on one of the warmer days of the year. At 9.5 this beer is surprisingly hot to me.

Smell is intense chocolate and toffee - very sweet and bright. The taste is fantastic - full of caramel and lots of chocolate. I'd like to taste the aged versions for a darker overall taste. The feel is incredibly creamy without being too heavy - not too thick - very easy to take down. I would never guess that it is 10.5% alcohol (other than the name of course) - feels more like 7-8%. The smooth and not too intense overall feel of the beer makes for an exceptionally drinkable RIS for me.

I started typing mouthfeel before flavor. It is excellent, thick and smooth, not too syrupy, but thick. I almost want to chew it. I don't ever really want more than one of these, but I would take one at any time - winter, summer, right now. What does that mean for drinkability? This is a great beer.

Heavy nose that texturally pushes outwards to gain as much ground as possible, licorice, white cake mix, toffee, baker's chocolate, café au lait, not overpoweringly sweet nor sugary, as much white grape and apricot fruit as cherry or plum scents, vanillin booziness, brazil nuts, there's plenty of different scents in there but they don't quite cohere into a choral whole. Full-bodied, dense and slooow moving, oily texture. Coconut, butterscotch, caramel, coffee, carob and chocolate covered raisins, darker complexion to the fruit here, cherry and blackberry with only a brush of apricot. The carbonation itself is slow if steady, more like a drip from a leaky faucet than a steady stream. More roast to it when warmer but, conversely, sheds some weight.

It kinda gives the illusion of some alcohol scents, but it didn't fool me this time. This one is smooth. The flavor leans more towards the dark and roasted flavors. Just enough carbonation to stir things up but not disrupt each sip. It works well with the roasty aspect. i would definitely sip this one. At 9.5%. I think the can also helped the pour.

The walnut head is not too much to speak of, rising up to about a half-finger at its zenith, but this completes the image of death: no head can survive when the presence of The End is so omnipresent. The aroma reeks with elements of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, even an only slightly perceptible hint of smoke. The taste relies heavily on that dark roasted malt flavor, with bits of vanilla, cocoa, and, yes, even that smoke making cameo appearances. This guy sits heavily on the tongue, yes, but not so heavily as to give the experience a negative connotation.

The smell is just as an RIS should be, however I would like it to be a little stronger. The roasted carmel scents are there, but it's just not kick you in the butt like the taste is. And the taste is well balanced, with no noticeable spice that might throw out the style. Just perfect. The mouthfeel is very nice as well. There is a alcohol warmth to this, but for it's age it isn't all that overwhelming. Another perfection. Which all in all makes this a very nice RIS sipper.","whoneeds8","Dec 04, 2009"

From the can into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass this beer pours out completely black in color, really no highlights to it. I had a huge foamy head that was one of the most unique colors I've ever seen. Similar in color to coffee with a slight amount of creamer to it, but almost had a reddish tint to it and it provides some decent lacing, spots all over the glass from top to bottom. The smell consists mostly of roasted malts and heavy amounts of chocolate slightly blended with some coffee. I actually expected to smell a touch of alcohol, but nothing. You can pick up on the hop aroma, but I couldn't notice it until it was room temperature. Excellent taste to this, absolutely wonderful. Same combination as the smell, it really has heavy amounts of chocolate, almost like fudge. There are roasted malts which adds to the initial sweetness. The hops are much easier to single out in the taste than the smell, pine. I noticed the coffee hints right before the hops. Extremely well balanced flavor with all the different flavors, well done! The mouthfeel is truly exceptional. Full bodied with an excellent texture to it, heavy, sweet and a bitter finish. All of this blended together so well leaves this an extremely drinkable beer. 2 for 2 from Oskar Blues in my opinion.","AndyAvalanche","Dec 01, 2009"

Medium bodied, creamy and smooth, with soft carbonation. Very nice, but not quite as thick or syrupy as expected. Finish has more of the roast barley and burnt malt flavors, little hop or sweetness. Flavor starts a little harsh, strong hop presence and burnt flavors. Middle and finish mellows out with mild milk chocolate and sweeter malt before the finish described above. I'm conflicted about this, I had high expectations for it and it's not bad, but I can't really decide what's holding this back from really exciting me.

Smells of roasted coffee and chocolate. Normally I am not a fan of imperial stouts. Generally they taste like burnt coffee with alcohol added. This isn't like that. This is strong, as an imperial stout should be, but extremely tasty and drinkable. Not something a frat boy is going to chug. Instead it is a very savory sipping beer. Huge delicious chocolate taste with hints of coffee and malts. A slight alcohol burn on the back of the throat after a drink, but not something you are going to taste. Left a dark brown lace on the glass after each drink that required the pint glass to have a second quick rinse afterwards. Generally the imperial stouts I have tried have a very up-front alcohol taste. Not this one at all. Works extremely well after a nice meal as a dessert. I would not give any beer a perfect rating unless it absolutely deserved it. This one does. I have had top-rated imperial stout DarkLord by 3 Floyds Brewery at three seperate beer festivals, and I have to say I prefer Ten Fidy to it. Ten Fidy should be every bit as celebrated as DarkLord!

Head was fairly thin as expected and was milk chocolate in color. Aromas were of burnt and roasted malts, espresso, dark chocolate, and a hint of sweetened anise perhaps. It was instantaneously boozy, but not overly, with full notes of roasted malt, dark bakers chocolate, and bold espresso, with the hops providing a somewhat spicy finish and a prickle on the tongue - a very pleasant dark chocolate taste lingers on in the bittersweet finish as well. At 98 ibu, this is tremendously balanced and the bitterness seems to be more burnt and roasty. Alcohol is present, but well concealed and provides some fruity esters resembling ripened dark fruits.

Notes of coffee, chocolate, and smoke. Like the body, the flavor is full. Roasted malts, tons of coffee, prune, cocoa, wood, and raspberry. Nice bitterness throughout to balance the rich malts. This beer coats the mouth to say the least, and so much flavor makes this one a nice sipper. This has to be the biggest beer in a can and Oskar Blues did one heck of a job!","qchic","Aug 25, 2009"

I have had this head to head with Expedition, Stone, Peche Mortal, and Yeti espresso - and it (at least) held it's own with all of them. Maybe the best balanced stout I have ever had. Pours black as motor oil, with a thin but lasting head. Smells and tastes of coffee (and I mean good coffee!). This beer is so smooth it's dangerous!

The aroma is all chocolate and coffee with just a touch of dark fruits. The flavor has lots of chocolate with some other dark malts following. Also has some dark fruit and tobacco characteristics. Not very bitter. The alcohol is slightly apparent, but not overwhelming. Very smooth. The body is on the heavy side of medium and the drinkability is good.

Toast, dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee hit the palate right away, with some brown sugar, burnt, dark roasted coffee, toffee nut, and date, along with just the slightest tinge of alcohol warming dominate the exceptionally long finish for this beer. Rich full mouthfeel without being too viscous or syrupy, with light to medium carbonation. While this is definitely a sipper (true to style), one sip most definitely invites another one due to the complexity and tastiness. I am literally floored by this beer. It more than lives up to the hype. Possibly the best RIS I have ever had the pleasure of drinking, this beer is practically perfect in every way. and in a can to boot!

Various aromas of deep dark chocolate, charred wood, licorice, roasted nuts, pine and even honey waft to the nose. Sweet chocolate and caramel reach the tongue first, followed by some spice, a nice hit of hops, more dark chocolates, some alcohol heat, roasted malts and vanilla extract. The aforementioned alcohol heat lingers for a while, but is not bothersome. The creamy smoothness is second to none going down; almost dessert-like, and while the body of this brew leans toward heavy, it doesn't weigh on you like some stouts can. A rich complex brew that goes great by itself, but would pair well with a great meal, and that is coming from one who usually gives a rat's ass about beer pairing with food.","stephens101","Jun 11, 2009"

But the taste sensation is where it really kicks in. Overall, it encompasses a very nice balance. Some roastiness yet not too roasty, but not to sweet either. The thing that really puts it over the top is how creamy it is. Just silk-like in its delicacy. No bitterness at all. Just a bit of hop balance at the end, but nowhere near as hoppy as I've heard.

The head seems to fade a bit quicker than on the draft version. On the nose are notes of fine, vinous chocolate, a deep roastiness, and long bitterness with hints of coffee waftinf in and out. Very nice. The flavor is a knock-out. Big flavors of bitter chocolate, espresso, a massive roastiness, long complex vinous notes and a gritty cocoa powder finish. Just magnificent. Huge mouthfeel, a bit grittier than on tap- it lacks a little of the creaminess of the beer served that way, but huge, with a bitter and vinous finish that goes on for a long time.

The mouthfeel is the best part of this drink. It is a silky smooth, and a tremendous treat going down. While I had no problem sipping what I opened and completing it, I could not see myself having more than one of these in an evening: each can is pretty much a dessert, and much like a sundae, consuming multiple would be overkill.","cdViking","Apr 10, 2009"

Then comes an extremely strong burnt coffee flavor that lingers along with alcohol and bitterness in the aftertaste. This is a very strong beer. Definitely a sipper.

The finish is also slightly metallic likely from the high alcohol levels. Mouthfeel is smooth, very rich, with nice carbonation levels.

Very rich chocolately and coffee flavors, both of which have sweet AND bitter expressions coming through depending on whether its on the front of your palate, swished around, or the lingering swallow.

Lacing is lasting and everywhere on my glass. I'm a swirler! Aroma is tremendous, earth, malt, dark chocolate, strong alcohol, tree bark, and blackened char from the grille. This is a very complex brew. I can see how this one can be someone's favorite stout, it has a unique taste to it. There is some syrupy feel but it is not sweet overall, or is it?. Sweet and bitter battle it out and I feel differently with each sip. There is a definite smokiness to this one. There is a nice chewy roasted characteristic to this one. The aftertaste is a bit harsh and the alcohol is quite prominent. I will revisit this one from time to time one at a time. Drinkability is very low for me.

One thing I noticed right off the bat is that the roasted malts do not take over the whole beer which is nice.

Nose is filled with dark, rich roasted malt, followed by a strong smokeyness. Love this aroma. Palate is surprisingly light on the front end and the sweetness of the malt comes through closer to the finish. Great roasted malt, but a bit light in the front of the palate, and a bit one-note. Mayeb a tocuh too sweet, could use some more hop character to cut it. A tingling effervescence is somewhat troubling. It isn't a strong carbonation, but fairly persistent. I'd prefer a touch less. Still very creamy and silky. Alcohol is well hidden behind the roasty malt goodness. A very good rendition of an imperial stout, and certainly the best I've had out of a can, but not in the upper echelon of the style in this reviewer's opinion.","TheDoorman","Feb 14, 2009"

The first sip shows off an astringency that is a little bit of a surprise as the aroma did not prepare me for it, it is good though! The feel is thick, slightly syrupy but does have a slick property till the end then the astringency really comes to the forefront as a charcoal feel. Flavors of burnt malt, coffee up in front of the chocolate flavors, some fruit. As it warms here alcohol seems to come out, but it mixes nicely with everything.

Smell is dark chocolate with some coffee notes and this is echoed in the taste. No bitterness nor soy sauce offness detected at all. The body is pure Oskar Blues goodness - crushed black velvet in a glass. The alcohol becomes more than appearant as it warms, but this is a 10% impy stout - that is to be expected. An oily film is left in the glass as a testimony to the power contained within. All I was hoping for and more. A contender with Speedway Stout for the best Imperial Stout I have ever tried.

This was like some slimey black snot that must have come out of the dredges of the can. Honestly, for about a quarter of the beer, this weired me out, and I even thought about pouring the rest through a seive to make sure it was the last bit of it, but after a while I just forgot about it and just carried on.

Good smells for an RIS, nothing outstanding or out of the ordinary. Oftentimes a good thing. The taste is great. The first taste is a bit harsh, but then the sweetness comes forward. You get the bitter roasted barley taste, the sweet chocolate taste, and a kick of alcohol. Again, there aren't really many out of the ordinary tastes, like licorice or fruit, at least not in the obvious places. You can find them if you search. The flavor is really well executed for the style, and the alcohol and any harsh flavors it may carry along are held in check. Really great complexity. I would never call this one-dimensional, but it doesn't try too hard or get muddled. I could really sit and savor this beer, but I just want to go back for more. I feel lucky to have another can, and can't wait for it to finally hit the shelves in Charleston full-time.","taylorhamrick","Dec 29, 2008"

Obviously, at 10%ABV, one of these is plenty, but this beer is by no means just another big beer to try to satisfy beer geeks. Yes, it's a huge beer in every aspect, but it is superbly balanced, especially when taking its ABV into consideration, and as warming as can be.

Dark fruit dominates, raspberry, fig, plum covered in burnt brown sugar, mollasses and some roasty smoke. So sweet. Taste is so smooth! Begins with the tiniest bit of burnt toast before giving way to dark fruits... raspberry covered in syrup, chocolate covered raisins, old red grapes. Beautifully drinkable.

4.23,-3.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Undoubtedly the best Russian Imperial Stout ever poured from a can. For some reason I feel dirty just admitting that. The beer slowly crawls out of the can and carefully eases itself into the glass with a more-viscous-than-most appearance. Low on carbonation, but releases an firm yet terse foamstand that laced and retained quite well. The beer is as dark and opaque as they come. The motor oil comparison that others have used is a good descriptor. Bold aromas of roasted barley malt, espresso, cocoa beans, and sweet alcohols garner attention from the nose. The flavor profile is much the same, but with the major emphasis on the roasted malts and espresso notes that just dominate the beer. Light hoppiness goes largely unnoticed, as do the esters, phenols, and any other delicate yeast qualities. Not overly complex, they have given this stout very few jobs to accomplish, but to do so larger and bolder than anyone else. They've largely succeeded. The beer is heavy, thick, and nearly syrupy. The light carbonation gives just enough lift to make the beer palatable. Finishes as you could imagine with a long lingering of espresso, cocoa, and warming alcohols.","BEERchitect","Nov 07, 2008"

There was a little head straight outta the can, a milky chocolate color, which slowly dissipated. The aroma was full of dark roasted malts with dark chocolate.

Exceptional retention given the strength. Nice lacing. Dark malt aroma. Some dark fruit. Some cocoa. Some background 'spent' hop. Mainly just dark malt. Coffee-like. Black coffee like. And that carries over into the flavor. More black coffee. Rich. Blanketing. Somewhat acidic, but not too much acidic. Solid mouthfeel. Firm and oily smooth. Flavors become more apparent as it warms, revealing more fruitiness (fig, burnt currant - which means dark berry-like fruitiness but with a bit of a tang, raisin, prune), lots of bittersweet chocolate, more coffee in a less roasty/acidic vein, more 'spent' and earthy/leafy hops, black licorice, burnt sugar, and alcohol.

It's pretty flavor and not so in your face, except that it's like drinking sludge. This would be hard to drink a whole glass of, and I probably would never want to do it.

It poured out like motor oil into the pint glass. It was pitch black and thick. It had a 2 finger dark brown head that slowly settled into a constant foam. No visible carb but great lacing that stuck around till it was finished. The smell was coffee, roasted choc malts and alcohol. It had a bit too much of an alcohol smell for me to rate higher. The taste was also impacted by the high alcohol. I had other RIS with same or higher ABV that masked it better. Not bad but kept me from really enjoying it. The rest of the taste was really good. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy but the alcohol left an oily feeling on the tongue. Overall, a good but not great beer from OB. Will need to try again to make sure the sample was proper. Also would love to try on tap again. I had it in a sampler at the brewery/restaurant and seem to remember it being better.+","TexIndy","Jul 25, 2008"

Taste is a nice, hefty roastiness, balanced by chocolatey sweetness, a hint of smoke, and an appropriate level of hop bitterness. Drier than other stouts in its class. The mouthfeel on this one is really exceptional for a non-oatmeal stout. It's quite weighty without being too sweet or sticky, and the high ABV is nearly invisible.

It has a lingering bitter, smoky finish that clings to the tongue. The mouthfeel is amazing - rich, clingy, and luxurious. This is a beer to sip and enjoy over a long period.

The head clings to the sides of the glass, but never really sticks around. The aroma is big with it's notes of coffee and dark chocolates. The flavor certainly follows suit with the aroma, but the chocolate notes really seem to dominate the initial flavors. The mouthfeel is really deceiving as initially the beer goes down smooth, but leaves a sensation of the back of your throat being coated with syrup. This may sound unappealing but only adds to the experience with an intense after tast that hangs around for quite some time. This beer comes across as immensely drinkable, but with the high ABV. it is wise to refrain. Overall this beer deserves any hype that it may receive, and I am always on the look out for it. This beer has really opened my eyes to what an imperial stout can taste like, and has got me even more excited about whats next.","israel","May 21, 2008"

Wonderful aromas of dark chocolate, black patent and chocolate malts, some vinous notes, a touch of espresso, and a hint of cashew or shelled pistachio. Really viscous at first sip, with a full-on roasty character, some astringency, floweriness and smokiness in the finish. Again, really thick, yet soft on the palate, slick on the tongue. A nice change of pace is that it's pretty hoppy, very bold for an IS. I was expecting a tinge of metallic taste from the can but I'm not really picking up on that, and there are just bonus points for said lack of metallic taste.

Black body that light has no chance getting through. Awesome aromas of chocolate, coffee and tobacco. Flavor is wonderful! I had no idea this was almost 100 IBU because there was SO much malt. Incredible! Mouth feel was thick like cough syrup and hid the alcohol surprisingly well. A damn good beer that I wish I had while it was -20 degrees outside.

I proceeded to pour it into a snifter (how often are cans poured into snifters I ask), releasing the jet black liquid with a creamy tan-brown head. The head holds nicely leaving beautiful lace. The smell if full of roasted espresso with slightly burnt notes, figs, and alcohols. The taste is sweet up front. Coffee dominates giving way to bitter dark chocolate. A fruitiness lingers throughout. The body is full and creamy with subtle carbonation; fantastically smooth. This is a great imperial stout. The draw is only greater due to the can. The high amounts of roast and possibly hops impart a significant amount of bitterness to this beer, if it were a bit sweeter, it might be more drinkable, but regardless I would love to have this one again, and will certainly pick it up again in the future.","MSchae1017","Apr 03, 2008"

The first sip brings a strong burnt malt backbone that moves to a light molasses sweetness, followed by a solid pine hop that brings notes of coffee to the party as it mingles with the burnt notes. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on my tongue well after swallowing the beer. I'm pretty impressed with this one. It pulls all the flavors together; I had it on draft and was not at all impressed, so this is a pleasant surprise. Mouthfeel is very thick, with just a hint of carbonation. This certainly fits the brew. Overall, this brew delivers.

Aroma's are not as strong as expected: cocoa, roasted coffee, black patent, creamy bourbon (if there was such a thing), and quite a bit of citrusy hops. On the palate, the roasted barley tumbles the tongue, chocolate malts develop finishing with some high alcohols and those west coast hops. It finishes almost minty and vodka like. Incredibly chewy in the mouth with moderate carbonation and heavy mouthfeel. Very refreshing after recently having Storm King and Black Bear stouts finding them just way too hoppy. Hops here are quite evident but very balanced. Not much bitterness from the malts, I imagine a low percent of black and roasted malts, making it very smooth. This is a very enjoyable RIS from a brewery who has such a solid lineup.","dreadnatty08","Feb 25, 2008"

The aroma is roasted malt, very rich smelling. The flavor is roasty with just a touch of sweetness, and quite a bit of bitterness in the after-taste. The mouthfeel is thick, giving a nice match to the rich flavor. I recommend this beer, but the only drawback is that I'd prefer a little less burnt bitterness in the taste.","TurdFurgison","Feb 24, 2008"

If it's in such short supply I've got to get back to the store from which I purchased it and purchase as much as they'll let me have. Yes I did like it. The pour at first gives no indication of the head that will first endear you to this interesting rendition of an imperial stout. The pour at first seems to produce no head to speak of with a pour so slow and with a viscosity to mirror that your heaviest of black gold (choose what weight of oil you will), in the end from the gathering of bubbles in the glass appears a thick medimum brown head (a good half inch in a conventional pint glass). The head allow for the perfect lace to form on the glass with each sip. The head does however disapate into a fine brown ring a each sip bring you closer to the bottom of the glass. The nose is of alcohol and deeply roasted grain. The taste is a wonderful roast and, chocolate flavor with an aftertaste who lingering roasted nutty flavor sits on the back of your tongue wishing for more. While I did detect a slight alcohol nose the drinkability is not impaired by the 10% ABV, yes that the scary part I could have turned this into a sessions beer very easily. Oh! Yea one after another. Yes it has the ability to make you forget that you are drinking a 10% ABV beer and visiting the far side of the moon. While some high gravity brews of late I've not found worth their weight in gold (and yes you will pay your weight in gold of this one). In my opinion this is by far the best yet from the little brewery from Lyons.","NJBeerguy","Feb 17, 2008"

Taste is much like the aroma. At first I am hit by a sticky sweetness which is followed by the arrival of roasted malts and, towards the finish, some dark chocolate and hop bitterness. The dark fruits don't appear until after the bitterness. In the late finish I get some alcohol, not hot or overwhelming, but noticeable. Mouthfeel is ok, it was a bit too thin IMO. This brew is medium, maybe medium-full, in body and has low carbonation. Drinkability is good, there was a nice alcohol warmth (a good thing) but overall I just wasn't that impressed.

Some bakers chocolate in the smell as well. The taste was a full on roast fest. The bitter, acrid, and astringent taste was much closer to a American Double Stout the the sweet and prune like flavors I typically see in a Russian Imperial Stout. Not too many hops, but the dried up body didn't need many anyway. Quite soft and oily on the palette, and avoided the harshness than some of the style sometimes display.

Relatively little on the nose aside from roasted malts, a splash of chocolate and vague milky-sweet smells. On the palate, however, things get more interesting. Very smooth, with a quick rush of hop bitterness and raw alcohol, alongside plenty of roasted malts and a bit of caramelized flavors. There's a bit of spiciness in the background, but little in the way of fruitiness or other esters. It's a rather straightforward beer. This isn't to say it's mediocre; quite to the contrary. While the malts are relatively straightforward, they strike no wrong notes, and instead envelope the tongue with rich, really huge, malt flavors that are perfectly balanced by hops. It's an uncomplex but satisfying, comforting and hugely enjoyable beer. Very well done.","geexploitation","Feb 06, 2008"

A touch of hops gives way to 70%+ dark chocolate and charcoal. Never thought I would describe a charcoal flavor or finish in a good way, but here it is.

Liquid comes spilling forth from the can a pitch black, with a lovely big brown head. It almost looks like the can is spewing this stuff from its mouth. Smell has traces of roasted coffee, earth tones, and a bit of fudge. Flavor is dominated by the roasted coffee, with lots of dark chocolate bitterness in the background. Mouthfeel is slick and thick on the palate. This one seems harsh at first from all the bitterness, but becomes more easy to drink with each sip. All in all, I wouldn't say this is one the top IMP stouts I have had, but certainly enjoyable, and interesting for a number of reasons (the fact that its a can being one of them).

Quarter-inch coffee-colored head quickly dissipated into a murky skim of light brown beer algae; plentiful sticky lacing throughout the tasting. Tremendous aromas of chocolate and malt. First sip was truly a beautiful experience. Sweet and chocolatey with a hint of coffee. Silky smooth, full mouthfeel culminated in a slightly astringent alcohol finish, while the fading memory of chocolate and malt lingered until the next sip.

Head hangs on, with average lace, which actually is pretty good for the style. Aroma is surprisingly minimal, but what is present is the expected dark maltiness with ample hops. Taste starts with sweet darkness, but quickly goes almost acrid bitter, in a good way, then giving way to sharp hoppiness, and closing with gradual warmth. Mouthfeel smooth and creamy, but the acridness does hamper things a bit, and drinkability reflects the same, but still very good overall. I'm really being picky here, but that's just me.

Stickiness is all over the place on the sides, holds on like molasses. Perfect looking brew, can't say much else. On to the nose. Big chocolate malt and toasted oat up front, almost like an Oatmeal Stout, that's a huge plus in my books. Scents of molasses, brown sugar, roasted barley, caramel malt, and a hint of wheat bread appear as well. Not nearly as smokey as I thought it would be, but my god is this a good smelling beer. Ok, time to take a sip of this monster. First taste I get is smoked almonds, and I love it. Roasted barley and chocolate malt slide over the tongue midway through. French roast coffee flavors in the aftertaste with a hint of charred wood. There is a tiny bit of alcohol on the tongue, but for 10% abv, I'm not complaining. Mouthfeel is huge and creamy with an almost non-existant carbonation. Wow, this beer is incredible. I have two cans left, one I have to age and the other I'm sure I'll drink pretty soon.

Ten Fiddy's appearance is nearly unbeatable. Carbonation is relatively light but the head remains an inch or more thick for several minutes before coming to rest at about a 1/4 inch. Aroma is deeply roasted with faint cherry and vanilla notes. Caramel malt is also present in the aroma but coffee and chocolate are both mysteriously absent. The flavor changes things up a bit as that intense roasted malt character leans towards coffee. I emphasize leans because coffee character in this beer is subtle at best. Chocolate too is minimal if present at all in the taste. Again , however, cherry is quite pronounced with some vanilla as well. Creamy is an understatement as to mouthfeel. As stated, carbonation level is low, and the bubbles that are around just seem to roll of the tongue. Nice bitterness in the finish. Extremely smooth, creamy, and luscious. Not as depthful as I would like and lacking a couple of those key RIS atributes, but...this is still a wonderful beer. It's so easy to drink, looks and feels great, and taste pretty decent.

4.27,-2.5,4.5,5,4,4,4,"I have had this beer exactly one time before which was on tap at the brewpub. This is straight from the new can which is mostly black and silver, Raiders colors, not fucking cool. The beer really looks like oil pouring from the can. The head was dark brown and the beer was obviously pitch black. The smell is excellent, roasty dark chocolates maybe a coffee bean as well and powdered cocoa. The taste is very nice, oaty for some reason, burnt, the smell is the best part. This stuff is definitely strong but i can not get over how good it smells. Buy this when you see it.","ArrogantB","Oct 11, 2007"

3.57,-18.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Drinkability was moderate. While this beer was quite good in some aspects, I found the combination of deep, charred roastiness, alcohol sharpness and intense hoppiness to be quite overwhelming.","Damian","Aug 25, 2007"

4.1,-6.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Originally reviewed on March 21, 2007. On draft at the brewpub and from a fresh growler. Nice somber cherry and wicking Cascade aroma, over creamy pine malt. Lots of dusky hops present in the aroma. Pour is a weird milky brown soap, with the darkest brown heap Ive ever seen! Flavor is a sweep of mid-roasted malts, lots of nuts, toasted caramels, sweet orange candies and fat almonds. Mingling of dry malt and high hops works surprisingly well. Palate and smack are most impressive. A smooth, quenchable pour, with nice attenuation and astounding drinakbility amongst a deftly concealed 9.4%. Dry, yet fulfilling smack, with quafs of light crisp piney grass over an effervescent nut oil character. Pecan skins and cherry pits lingering in the higher alcohols that rise to the nostrils. Well-balanced, however somewhat middle-of-the-road, somehow. It doesnt have a singular, unique character, aside from its entire build, that makes it a unique Imperial Stout. However, its beautifully built and brewed and certainly the most drinkable of ANY Imperial Stout. This strays from the classic sippers of the style to a near sessionable big beer. Mightly delicious.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 21, 2007"
4.33,-1.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Excellent beer. Very faithful to style. I would certainly like to drink this again, but not something you would do in quantity. A ""dessert beer"".","","Jun 08, 2007"

Complex flavor, extremely malty and satisfying, with big flavors of chocolate, roast and coffee. Hoppy as well, especially on the finish. A fantastic brew.","Crosling","Apr 11, 2007"

4.42,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap at the Hop Devil Grill in NYC, this large and tasty RIS poured an enticing shade of oily black with a forceful looking dark tan head, leaving behind messy lacing. Nose of dark grains and strong coffee. Soft in the mouth, overload of flavors, more coffee, dark burnt grains, rich,complex, heady brew, well worth a try if you are lucky enough to see in your area.","Billolick","Mar 19, 2007"
4.48,2.3,4.5,4,5,4.5,4,"Drinkability: Occasional, This is a perfect example of a Russian Imperial Stout! Thus being such a bold beer, I would expect to enjoy this on special occasions or weekend trips to the pub! Another great beer by Dale and crew!","BadRockBeer","Mar 13, 2007"
4.5,2.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The mouthfeel is viscous and chewy. Just what I like in an RIS. I could definitely have had more than one of these with the exception that I was there for lunch. Excellent beer and one of the best RIS I have tried. Worth seeking out!","ddarden","Mar 13, 2007"
4.23,-3.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Thanks to pugman for sending this my way. Poured into an Imperial pint glass. Appears a pitch black color with three full fingers of dark brown dense foam. Moderate lacing is left on the glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells of sweet cocoa, vanilla, alcohol and fruity notes. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, alcohol, roasted coffee, and bitter citrus peel. Finish is bone dry and bitter with a medium alcohol burn on the tongue and throat. Full bodied and rich with medium to moderate carbonation. This was a really good beer , although it was on the hot side. I'd love to see how this does with a year or two of aging.","ClockworkOrange","Mar 07, 2007"
4.53,3.4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Finally got to the Brick Store to try this and was blown away by this beer. Incredibly thick brown head and jet black appearance. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate, smoke, oak aromas. Mouthfeel was very nice with a soft carbonation. Very thick with no alcohol taste, very long finish. I think this is the best impy stout I've ever had!!","doubleipa","Feb 26, 2007"

4.57,4.3,4.5,5,4.5,5,4,"Thanks to Jeff at Fathead's for getting this one to the Burgh, only four 1/2 barrels but damn that's good enough for me. 3 went to Fathead's and 1 made it's way to Mad Mex Robinson keep your eyes peeled. I love the name and it happened to remind me of one of my favorite imperial stouts from Southern Tier their IS from the long long ago Blackwater Series. Appearance is opaque literally black eats all light with a two fingered sized dark moccha tan head leaving behind fine lacing unevenly around the glass. Aroma is full of deep dark chocolate mild butterscotch undertones, cocoa, and an espresso coffee barrage. Other subtle notes found were some soft edges a touch of vanilla and oat grains maybe some molassess and the herbal pine hop bite definitely expresses itself with a bang. The flavor brings huge hop bitterness among waves of dark roast espresso bursts, dark chocolate, herbal pine hop flavors and succulently sweet butterscotch, molasses, and oatmeal with vanilla notes. Huge impy stout worthy of any hype this low distributed beer may bring, I hope it makes it on the canning line. Mouthfeel is huge engulfs the palate even slow chugging carbonation barely can handle all this malt with a sticky mildly chewy character about it also noted were some streaks of hop oils. Drinkability was amazing I savored every drop definitely a conversation sipping beer complex and tasty, I want some more of this stuff, damn.","WVbeergeek","Jan 24, 2007"

4.38,0,5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"This is the first truly great beer Ive had in a long while. Ive had a couple that were worthy of a 4 or so in my scale, but most not even worth that. This is a truly pitch black liquid. The head looks like a dark chocolate milk cloud floating on the coal dark sea of beer on this one. I lean in for a sniff and am greeted with loads of chocolate, toffee, and espresso over a lurking bit of grapefruit hops. I take a sip and am shocked not by the flavor, which was precisely what the aroma had suggested, but by the mouthfeel, which was more like whole milk or a thin chocolate malt than a beer. A truly creamy mouthfeel, yet this wasnt cloyingly sweet. This was heaven.","aracauna","Dec 31, 2006"
