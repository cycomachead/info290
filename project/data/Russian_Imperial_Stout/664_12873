This is not what to expect from what is currently going around the US as a Russian Imperial Stout.  This is down to earth and not overly built.  It tastes raw, like something made in the 1800s.

Nice blend of malt, coffee and chocolate.  There was no one dominant flavor for me.  I thought it came together nicely with malt and coffee more present, a hint of chocolate.  I didn't get fruit, but something was managing the bitterness very well.  Medium body.  Would have preferred a little more creaminess, but still a great beer.","marieli","Mar 01, 2015"

The palate begins with rich chocolate backed by light coffee that blossoms into dark dried fruit and then fruit cake and hints of molasses. It dries on the finish with a slight astringency and a suggestion of chalk. The carbonation is very fine and soft - almost nitro quality. The body is chewy and the beer is slightly warming.

It is singularly lacing in flavor other than the initial weak bitter chocolate taste. Lacing is poor, head is small, and aroma is weak.

Then the pear-like meaty fruitiness expresses itself and bringing up the rear is a dry but acrid bitterness. Form 10% ABV the alcohol is well masked. I wish I had more than one of these to drink.

This beer had ok drinkability, it was a little smooth, rich, creamy, filling, a little boozy, and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, one of these small bottles is the perfect size for me and I don't think I would want to have another one in a row and I think it makes for a nice beer to have on a cold and snowy winter night. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, I thought it was very nice and it's just what I look for in a good RIS. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad and it was fairly complex, but it was very sweet and the roasted malts could have stuck out a little more. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was fun to try, but for over $6 for a small 9oz bottle, it's just too pricey for me and I would much rather have a Founders Imperial Stout, especially for the price. I would recommend this to anyone who like RIS's. All in all I enjoyed this beer, but it isn't my favorite of the style, Founders Imperial Stout still holds that title and I think this beer lacks the refinement that Founders Imperial Stout has and it's for sure more drinkable. Good job guys, I'm glad I gave this one a try.","StoutHunter","Jan 05, 2014"

Snifter. Black with a billowing light brown head with impressive retention. Lacing forms thick sheets on the sides. Fine looking beer. Lots of chocolate and roast in the aroma, with blackstrap molasses, licorice, and a bit of coffee. Some earthy, woodsy notes as well. The flavor is quite roasty and dry with a moderate level of earthy bitterness. Strong chocolate profile with evident coffee, molasses, and licorice. The bitter/roast combo borders on acridity but just manages to avoid that pitfall. Alcohol is really well hidden. The body is full. Upper moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is chewy, sticky, and silky. A good, well balanced Russian Imperial Stout.","HopHead84","Nov 25, 2013"

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, char, coffee, dark bread, light raisin, licorice, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, char, coffee, dark bread, licorice, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Excellent balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt flavors with light fruitiness; with big robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, fairly chalky, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish; very smooth to sip on for 10%. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial stout! Great balance and complexity of big dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 06, 2013"

The great thing about this russian imperial stout is how drinkable it is. I have tried the original courage and this bottle which is over 2 years old still has a vibrant fresh taste even though it has some age. I love how the yeast fruitiness mixes with the rich malt and the alcohol does not even really makes an appearance til it nears cellar temp.

The roasted malts are very forward in the flavor, bringing some roastiness and smokiness to the palate. I also get the coffee and chocolate notes. The dark fruit flavors are also there, but the other flavors are the star of this show and the fruit plays on the back end.

Flavor's like nose with subtle sweetness, soft carbonic tang, roast/yeast/hop bitter and a little clashing between some of those qualities. Body is soft and full; ditto carbonation.

The taste is also very good, it comes on strong with the coffee flavors at first, but then gives way to a great mix of fruit and roasted malt. The fruits aren't dark like in most RISes, these are bright fruits that are quite delicious and make this a unique drinking experience. The mouthfeel is lighter than the average RIS, but it works great with the fruit flavors. The drinkability is exceptional, it doesn't feel anywhere close to 10%.

The peat lingers on into the finish, lending an aggressive but refined smoke note. The mid-palate is surprisingly fruity as wellAll sweetness that's present does exhibit a bitter side as well (burnt sugar, black licorice, buckwheat honey-like grainy character). Medium-full in body with moderate carbonation, this beer has a wonderful finish, with the aforementioned bitterness and sweetness, along with some char, a moderate fruit character and a touch of alcohol.

Plenty of baker's chocolate and dark fruit along with a hint of molasses. The herbal bite at the end is swift and strong. The taste is similar to the smell. Very robust in the malt department with bitter chocolate and some dark fruit sweetness. The hops are tame but definitely make an appearance to smooth out the intense malts.

Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an even carbonation that falls just short of lively. There's also some residual acidity at the finish.

Roasted and sweet malt, dark fruit, bitter coffee and chocolate. Finishes with coffee and a well tuned hop bite. Excellent heavy, creamy body is noticeable from the very first taste.

This pours a little thinner than expected, but its a hazy yeast filled almost black color with a massive tan head (i had to wait several times for it to go down). The smells are of dark roasted malts, espresso, a little sweet dark fruit, and some alcohol. The feel is medium, a little thinner than some other irs, but still a tad creamy.

Short coffee crema colored head, but the head clings to the side of the glass in a sheet, not just rings. Smells of Christmas pudding cooked in a coal fired oven- slightly sooty and redolent of fruit and brandied cake. Dry and intense in flavor, tightly wound. Nice lingering, ashy bitterness with dry fruit notes, licorice, espresso, and bitter chocolate. Superb, and surprisingly bracing and dry with a bit of alcohol bite that is nevertheless integrated with the beer in the sense that it underscores the other flavors instead of dominating.

Pretty dern British, so to speak (as far as stouts go). The taste brings in more of the same, with a touch of clove lying near the bottom of things. The body is a light-feeling medium, with a light carbonation and a creamy, smooth feel. Overall, this is a great-tasting stout that drinks way the hell too easily for anyone's own good.

Cracking open this one, I am getting strong vinous aged aromas fizzing out and also the familiar dark fruits namely dates, plums and raisins. But wait a minute.. this is a stout right? I do not get the roasted malts and stuff instead those aromas are typical of an aged strong ale. The taste starts off with a bitter note and ok now I think I can pick up slight hints of roasted malts but they are just too subtle. The dates, plums and raisins were showing up but without the familiar sweetness in most aged strong ale. There is a slightly sourish and vinous tartness throughout and the finishing was fairly dry and bitter. I am not really picking up familiar stout tastes in general and this taste is not bad but the tartness and sourness is a little on the strong side. Bitterness was significant but still within bounds. The after taste was rasiny and dates; not really lasting though I have some nice aromas on the nose as well. The mouthfeel was fairly thick with syrupy, watery smoothness and practically no carbonation. Drinkability slightly lowered due to the slightly high sour and tartness.

4.42,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"1983 bootle which was given to me as a gift from a fellow BA. Extremely unique in every way. Oldest beer I've had to date. Poured a deep dark brown, almost black with little head and not much lacing. The smell is powerful and complex as is the taste. Bitter chocolate, rasins, molasses, alcohol, coffee and a very pronounced red wine taste help make this easily the most complex beer I've had. Once you try it you won't soon forget it. Thanks Smalls!","beerdrifter","Feb 01, 2007"

4.25,0,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"After 5.5 years had a fresh bottle(so cognac ageing not there yet as only year old) courtesy of Gary. Very creamy, light chocolate and roast. Very good, and uncomparable to the US versions.","Sammy","Nov 29, 2006"
2.35,-44.7,3.5,3.5,2,2,1.5," Tastes pretty oxidized. There are remnants of what I am sure was a great beer, but this bottle has turned. Somewhat chalky finish. Bad drinkability. Now that my review is finished, I am dumping the rest.","Sephiroth","Oct 19, 2006"
3.89,-8.5,4,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall - Unfortunately this bottle was slightly past it's prime - maybe 2 or 3 years ago it would have been at its peak but this one just seemed a bit washed out... bland even. Glad i tried it though - especially to breath in the amazing aromas...","mdagnew","Oct 16, 2006"
4.27,0.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Flavor is big malt with molassess and chocolate dominant but also some soy sauce on the finish. Also a smoky, peaty, roasty lingering finish is present. SImilar to a glass of scotch. The brew is easy drinking with no hint of the ABV anywhere. Quite a nice score on the last weekend of a good beer bar. If you see it try it!","sulldaddy","Jul 07, 2006"
3.18,-25.2,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Drinkability: With this ABV and price tag ($45 for a 170 mL bottle), the drinkability is tough. As I stated though, I would have loved to have tried this 2 years ago.","akorsak","May 09, 2006"

3.64,-14.4,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"1989. Ebony pour, calm, still. Extremely oxidized nose, woody, vinous. Very complex fruitiness, plenty of grapes, marshmallow sweet aspects, mushroomy vegetal damp earth undertones. Very salty, soy-lkike. Sourish vinous palate, once again very salty, very woody, intense vegetal aspects. Surprisingly still some hops in there, powerful smoky oxidized finish. Medium bodied, rather slick. Interesting, I dont think this is one of the great vintages, but Id love to try one with less oxidation.","Rastacouere","Sep 11, 2005"

4.05,-4.7,1.5,4,4.5,4,4,"1989 bottle  drank in 2004: Very dark beer with no head or carbonation. Aroma is mostly comprised of alcohol and a subtle smell of coffee. Taste can be described as a mix between roasted malts, coffee, subtle chocolate and ends with some bitterness and a warm alcohol taste. Very intriguing beer, it almost feel like a mix between an old ale (Gales Prize Old Ale) and a Russian Imperial Stout without extreme hops (Sam Smith Russian Stout) without any carbonation but with a good warming feeling from the alcohol as you drink this. I feel lucky I had the chance to taste this but a vertical tasting of this beer would be paradise","Phyl21ca","Sep 10, 2004"
5,17.6,5,5,5,5,5,"A Huge Thanks to fellow BA and Yorkshireman BSF for this one, delivered whilst we shared a brew at the Doncaster Beer Festival during my Easter trip to England. I am truly indebted to you for this master libation. Thank You, Thank You Sir; it has matured extremely well, no thanks in part to your master cellarmanship. I owe you a few Gallons of Timothy Taylors Landlord next year!!!","TheLongBeachBum","Aug 03, 2004"
4.43,4.2,4,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Lovely. Aged and molded. The flavor profile mainly consists of chocolate, cocoa and coffee. Dark fruits as well with notes of purple grapes, red apples and maple.","Crosling","Jul 25, 2004"
4.35,2.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"A 1983 vintage I scored off ebay-'Not for consumption"" my ass!!!Great sounds of carbonation when I opened it.Poured jet black with a very slight head that remains all the way down.Extremely vinuous aroma.Plenty of black currant and raisens going on.Theres a slight metallic odor-while not unpleasant its right there in front.Some great port like flavor-a slight sourness throughout.Very grape like.Very bright and lively mouthfeel.Even with the sourness its quite smooth.Overall a fantastic beer.Even after 21 years its still quite something to behold.If you can find a bottle treat youself.","lackenhauser","Jun 18, 2004"
5,17.6,5,5,5,5,5,"1983 vintage sampled at the Kulminator in Antwerpen, Belgium. $4:-) From the mangled bottle pours forth one insanely good beer! Deeply dark and opaque with no hints of light showing through! A HUGE head of tan foam, that leaves excellent lacing, even after 21 years in the cellar. The aromas are heavenly, as this is the ultimate imperial stout. The aromas are all across the board and consist of currants, dark chocolate, pure cocoa, strong french coffee, pure unadulterated alcohol vapors, deeply roasted malts, lightly medicinal (orval-like) hops and more! The taste is so rich, so deep, and so endless, that it is hard to describe. The first thing that hits tongue is the deep coffee flavor, than the chocolate and malts come in with a one-two punch, than the hops and other herbal flavors come and linger on your tongue for an eternity. 21 years old and this is not oxidized one freaking bit. This beer is so old, that IT can legally drink itself in the states! The mouthfeel is so thick, creamy, and smooth, with no loss of texture after all of these years, and the drinkability is simply amazing. 10%+, you HAVE to be kidding me. Wow, i've always loved imperial stouts, and I thought that I have had some of the best imperial stouts out there....than, I had this. This is without a doubt the perfect imperial stout (and one of the oldest recipes is used as well). A classic amongst classics, and perhaps the best beer that I have ever had in my life...(it gives the St. Lamvinus a run for it's money, and this one was only $4!!!)You simply have to find a way to try a well-cellared example of this beer. I see them on eBay ocassionaly, so perhaps it is worth a try. If not, do have one when you get to the little piece of heaven that is the Kulminator in Antwerp. No wait, don't have any, save it all for me...PLEASE!","francisweizen","Mar 30, 2004"
4.32,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Gravity cask GBBF 2003- present vintage, this is definitely worth the bloody price. So rich and chocolatey, rich, yet smooth, very long finish. Really good stuff. wasn't as vinous, and salty as the 1985 bottle i had gad a week or so earlier. Less porty aged characters aswell. probably one of my favourite beers of the GBBF in 2003, extra special that it was on cask aswell, very exciting.","rastaman","Sep 22, 2003"
4.35,2.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This was a 6-pack of the 1983 picked up from the Kulminator in Antwerp, for $7! Thick black and wonderful looking, even after all these years. Tasted of sherry, burnt caramel, and raisin. Very full mouth feel, yet you could tell that the body has thinned noticeably with age. This beer has held up very well, despite being obviously oxidized. This in my opinion just added to the character and complexity of this beer.","Gueuzedude","Sep 19, 2003"
3.05,-28.2,4,4,2.5,3.5,2.5,"It is with sadness that I write this review. It doesn't appear that the '93 Courage Imperial will be able to age for 10 years. Hopefully, my bottle was an exception and there are still some quality bottles left. The appearance and aroma were fine, as I remember them from previous tastings, but the flavor has deteriorated greatly. The unique ""burnt currant"" has been replaced by a more acidic note. The complexity of flavor has dwindled into a single, basic flavor. There's not much left at all.","NeroFiddled","Jul 16, 2002"
