Deeply roasted barley. Smells like port, too. Flavor is rich, sweetness and roast. Potent, sweetened coffee and burnt oats. Raisins and plums and port. Vanilla extract. Big, oily, slick, lingering feel. Unfortunately, this bottle is completely flat. It enhances the port/sherry feel. The alcohol is still present but you can tell the couple years of sitting has mellowed it out a bit. I wish the carbonation hadn't flees this one because it's pretty yummy otherwise. It has aged well and I'm not going to crucify this beer for going flat.","VelvetExtract","Sep 05, 2014"

Big sweet and roasty aroma, definite bitter roast on the smell, some brown sugar and chocolate and a bit of dark fruit. Big sweet malts up front that fades into a super smokey roasty flavor that envelopes the palate. Lots of dark sugars and a hint of chocolate, but mainly roasty malts all over. Thinner than expected, a medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. This came off on the cloying side somehow behind the roast, and a bit alcoholic. Meh.","BMMillsy","Apr 03, 2014"

It's class is in the brewer's creative thought process when creating Black Hole. I'm just now sure it delivered the price paid.

The flavor is sweet with a healthy dose of coffee. Chocolate, earthy hop flavor, dark cherries, and caramel all play their parts.

It doesn't have any masking overtones (e.g. those that are present in the barrel aged versions), but it's okay as a foundation. Feels like a shell intended for better things. I enjoy it okay for what it is, but I wouldn't have it again. The mouthfeel is disastrous coupled with the strong alcohol. Flavours never come in to save it as they do with the aged versions. Fans of Mikkeller (like meself) are best of pursuing the aged versions - particularly the red wine edition. This pales in comparison.","kojevergas","Dec 30, 2011"

It truly is as solid a black as a beer can get. A thin half finger of beige and creamy head developed on the beer and quickly receded to a thin collar. There was no lacing from this. As I drank the beer there was plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this beer is aggressive - as soon as you pour this behemoth it seems to charge from the glass and seek out the nearest nostrils to assault. I was pleased these happened to be my nostrils. There is an intense coffee aroma that smells as good as the ritziest of coffee shops. There is also burnt toast, roasted malts, and unsweetened chocolate present. All these are very strong but they balance each other beautifully. None of them are overshadowing the rest. The taste is complex and world class. You get a very high quality coffee flavor that almost seems a bit like a mocha as it blends with the bittersweet chocolate. As these fade I get caramel, vanilla, and a bit of woody taste. Somewhere in there I got the dark fruits typical of belgian dubbels. The finish has that nice warming alcohol sensation. The taste of the 13.1% alcohol is well hidden. The flavors in Black Hole are intense and highly enjoyable. I have a thing for good coffee beers and this once again has impressed me greatly. The mouthfeel is rich, smooth and almost a bit silky. No excuses - go try this beer.","gramity","Dec 21, 2011"

The after taste is definately an acquired one and nothing to boast about, yet any unique beer is A game in my book. As with most Mikkeller beers the appearance is exceptional (opaque with a very small head of coffee with cream) Bottomline, your ten bucks is better spent on the Beer Geek by Mikkeller, if one has the option, and share this one with a friend because your taste buds will diminish as you get more drunk.","gurpapete","Dec 28, 2010"

Taste..ugh. Major disappointment here. Kind of just tastes like cold black coffee, dark malts, a bit of sweetness, tons of booze. The malts + alcohol are EXTREME, to the point where I had to stick it in the fridge for about an hour to continue drinking it. Once it was chilled it was much easier to drink and I enjoyed it a little, but it was hard. Mouthfeel is very smooth and malty but I prefer more chewy thickness, and a little bit of carbonation wouldn't hurt. High price on top of this doesn't help the drinkability either.

It also seemed to have that semi-sweet dark chocolate flavor that I associate with a good Baltic porter.

Sure, 14% isn't all that bad when compared to some of the more extreme beers out there (I'm looking at you, Raison d'Extra), but this is an extraordinarily unrefined 14%. In two years this beer will be phenomenal with the dark molasses-chocolate-caramel-maltiness mellowing out and eating up a bit of the heat, but for now it's just not drinkable in any of practical sense of the word.

Quite well integrated despite being a bit hot in the taste as well. More coffee and chocolate, clean and pure.

I haven't heard that this brew is barrel-aged, yet it has a slight flavor profile like a hint of bourbon barrel and/or wine barrel. There's a fruity character as well which might be attributed to the high-alcohol in this brew.

The alcohol is slightly noticeable but it comes off more like a minty freshness in the mouth and warming in the chest than hot alcohol. Quite pleasant for 14% and very drinkable. Carbonated a bit more than average for the style aiding in drinkability. As it warms, I definitely get a bit of the aspirin like chalky medicinal bitterness too from the hops. That definitely detracted a bit and kept it from being a fantastic beer, yet it is still good.","JDV","Apr 02, 2008"

Moderate bitterness with lots of sweet, malty caramel. Grapefruit hops and chocolate filled out the flavour with a mellow alcohol finish. Heavy body with fine, well-integrated carbonation. Carbonation was a bit low and it had a creamy texture. Plenty of warmth and a bit of dryness from the dark malts. Tasty stuff! Great texture and easy drinking considering the abv.

Mouthfeel is fairly heavy in body although any sweet malts are kept in check by the huge roasted flavors and the very large drying, burnt bitterness in the finish, alcohol warms the throat in the finish as well.
