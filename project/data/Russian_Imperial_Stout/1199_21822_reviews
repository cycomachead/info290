"Damn, I love this beer."
""
""
"Was extremely surprised at how delicious this thing was. Thick feel, sweet after taste, TON of chocolate and roasted malt."
""
""
"All in all this beer convinces by its perfect composition, decent depth of different flavors with prominent chocolate and coffee, resulting in a great imperial stout. Both, coffee and chocolate, are on par, leaving a lot of space on the palate for a smooth, creamy mouthfeel."
"Can not say enough good things about this beer. So dark you can't see through it, and smelled so rich coming out of the bottle. Overall, an amazing beer and one of the best stouts Ive ever tried."
""
""
""
""
"One of the best beers I ever had.  The taste of fine Nicaraguan cigars, sweet molasses, sweet malt, rich sweet Belgian chocolate, and a beautiful fruit bouquet. Truely a beer to pair with a fine cigar."
""
""
""
""
"damn fine all around brew."
""
""
""

""

"Great feel with balance throughout.  Loved it!  Great job!"

"2012 draft pour. Believe the hype about age on this one. The three year old pour was so amazingly delicious!"

"A fantastic imperial stout with heavy notes of chocolate and roasted malt both the aroma as in the taste."
"A much smoother finish than other stouts. A plesant first sip and a decently good swallow---"
""
""
""
"Dear Lord, if they could only barrel age this stuff.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a tulip glass, short-lived espresso-like foam head. Visibly thick and viscous while being poured. Smells like dark roasted coffee and red wine. Tastes like a deep mocha with notes of tobacco and smoke, nice delicate balance of bitter and sweet, clean finish. Silky and decadent mouthfeel. Fantastic imperial stout."
""
"2013 bottle poured into a snifter at cellar temp. Very dark, one-finger head that dissipates fairly quickly but leaves beautiful lacing. Outstanding body for a non-BA stout. Thick and chewy, as it should be. I absolutely love this stout and the only thing holding it back for me is the slight smokiness that I would happily trade in for a touch more sweetness. I prefer this to the Breakfast Stout and am glad to see that the cellar is treating it well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid baseline RIS, on par with Stone, and top 10 for sure."
"So yeah, my first BA review. A 4.4/5 for me. I think with another few months, this will be INCREDIBLE. I'm not a big super roast guy, and that flavor seems to be on the out in favor of dark fruit, coffee, and toffee. Luckily, I have another few bottles in the cellar."
"94/100"
""
""
""
"The first sip was wonderful, great. Wow this is good. The beer is smooth, heavy, chewy. Its world class. Nothing like it."
""
"Overall this was a good brew, one I'm glad I tried. I'm not sure I would get it again, as there are a lot of other good Russian Imperials out there, and I don't think this one is my favorite. Still, worth a try. Quality Stuff"
""
""
""
""
"This beer honestly reminds me a lot of FBS, only with a sharper alcohol bite on the back end. It's just as good, in my opinion. This one reminded me why imperial stouts are my favorite beers."
""
""
"OVERALL: This beer blew my mind the first time I had it, and it continues to do.  This is everything you could want in an imperial stout.  In my opinion, this is a world-class beer."
""
"Bottled 12/22, snifter pour.  Deep dark black, one finger head.  Rich roasty nose.  Taste is rich, subtle chocolate.  Right on par with Expedition and Ten Fidy.  One of the very best Imperial stouts out there."
""
"I am an IPA / pale ale guy but want to develop a taste for stouts. Lots of people like them so they must be good right? Sipped this over the course of an hr and it was pretty good. Nice alcohol burn on the back end. This was bottled dec 14 gonna cellar two from the four pack I got."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied, light effervescence, nearly cloying. A bit of ash in the aftertaste but not offputting. Dry finish and bit cleaner than I prefer but still a truly great beer."

"This is a keeper!"
"Top 1 jams Fo sho   Real deal"
""
"Overall"
"Up there with Kate the Great. Exactly what I want in a stout."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied which comes as a slight surprise being a beer that weights in at the heavier ABV. There doesn’t seem to be a hint of boozieness here and it hides the alcohol well. This is just a smooth Imperial stout without the edges that can really effect the enjoyment of a beer like this."
"Pours like motor oil, with a two finger chocolate mouse head.  Aroma is dark fruit, chocolate.  Taste is chocolate, light roast, and light dark fruit on the back end.  Mouthfeel is creamy and heavy, but smooth.  Overall a great imperial stout, one of the best I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent example of a RIS!  Founders proves that you don't need to barrel age to have the full flavor profile.  Thank you founders"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: 4.65 - A solid A beer. This isn't something I would drink but maybe once a month. It's so good, but so massive I feel like I'd overwhelm myself with more frequent consumption. Badass brew."
""
""
"Fantastic RIS, super heavy mouthfeel, yet smooth not boozy."
""
""
""
"Probably the best Imperial Stout (non-barrel aged) that I have had.  Nice bouquet of coffee and some vanilla.  Texture is thick, creamy, and silky with a nice level of carbonation.  Taste is so well balanced.  Lots of coffee flavors and a little bit of sweetness, but not too much.  I have found several stouts to be overly sweet and it just gets to be too much by the end of the beer.  That was the thing I like best about this is the level of sweetness was dialed in perfectly.  There is a light level of bitterness that lingers on the finish. Also this does not have any harshness like some of the other Imperial Stouts.  The 10.5% abv is well hidden and it is easy to drink fresh and doesn't need age, although I do wonder if it would get even better with some age.  I would rank this above the top competition like Expedition and Speedway (both of which I thought were very impressive) and the price is fair too as it is half the price of Speedway.  This will be my go to non-barrel aged Stout."
""
"smooth as silk, creamy mouthfeel. you can almost chew this. roasted coffee up front , chocolatey finish.wonderful"
""
"This is a  superior RIS!  While the taste is outstanding with abundant chocolate, coffee, and dark fruit, I think its most amazing attribute is its mouth feel:  very viscous and creamy.  It's almost as though you can chew it.  I never tire of drinking this beer."

"This beer has the perfect feel for a stout. Amazing!"
"12oz bottle. Very good. Will get again for sure"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I thought I reviewed this before. I've had it before, and recall it being outstanding. I just saw and bought a single, and it's still terrific. I recommend it to any RIS fan. Robust, chocolatey, dark fruit, bitter roast, thick, chewy. Solid."
"Pours a pitch black color with a coffee colored head. The smell is full of roasted malts that give the beer a nice coffee scent to it. The taste was great with coffee and dark chocolate flavors mixing well with a bit of hops here and there. Hides the ABV well and I thought this was an amazing beer. Definitely worth picking up."

"A very good stout."
"One of my absolute favorites. What is not to like! World Class is an understatement!"

"Power backed stout hold your socks on when u Drink this one"
""
"Poured into a snifter. Black as midnight with one of the darkest brown heads I have ever seen. The head is small but leaves some nice lacing on the glass as it goes down. Legs on the glass as well when you swirl it around. Nose is filled with chocolate, vanilla, port, coffee, and booze, although the sum is not great as its parts. It falls apart a bit upon tasting.  Way too heavy on the burnt malt. Big espresso notes as well as bitter dark chocolate. Very bitter in fact. Full bodied with a chewy texture. Booze remains prevalent throughout the beer. I put one of these bad boys in the cellar to revisit in a year. Hoping some of the burnt flavor will mellow out. Hate to say it but I don't get all the Founders love. I've been generally disappointed with most of what I've tried."
""
"is a very smooth stout beer."
"Draft from a 32 oz grunt.  Pours dark black with 2 fingers of tan mocha colored head.  Significant lacing throughout the drink.  Aromas of coffee and chocolate with a hint of dark fruit.  Nice heavy body in the mouth with a rush of chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts and coffee (not espresso).  Extremely smooth and well balanced.  Aftertaste is much the same on the back end with maybe more coffee.  Extremely smooth and drinkable.  32oz gone in a flash.  Well hidden abv.  This was 2013 so aged at least a year.  Very smooth."
""
""
""
""
"LET THIS THING AGE! It is leaps and bounds better after about a year or two of cellaring. The intense dark fruit notes fade a little bit and it turns into a delicious, chocolatey, fudgey brownie."
"Floral and piney with a heavy dark malt backbone. They balance really well. Dark chocolate, pine and roast malt aftertaste. Will be buying more."
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into stout goblet. Very dark brown to black liquid with light brown head that stands two fingers tall before settling to a sheen and leaving some patches of lace. Aroma is very roasty malts, unsweetened chocolate, espresso, dark fruit, molasses, and alcohol. Taste is initially sweet roasted malts, with cocoa and dark fruit followed by coffee (and maybe some hop) bitterness and fruity esters on the finish. Medium-full body, creamy and thick texture, soft carbonation, long bitter finish and warming alcohol sensation."

"O - An amazing Imperial stout.  Get it if you can!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, you need to get this. This is the perfect beer during the messy 2015 snow, cold, and ice we've been experiencing. I used it as dessert, and it worked out fantastically. It got loads of flavor and complexity without the harshness or burn you sometimes get from the style. And it's not overly sweet. Go get yourself a 4pk, try 1, and cellar the rest. A rated beer all day long son!"

"Founders is securing a special spot in my fridge."
""
""
""
"Great Russian stout.  Pours thick as oil and very tasty."
"Another awesome beer from Founders and one of my favorite imperial stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black as night, friends compared it to oil.  The taste definitely makes it worth the cost.  The only bad thing is the guts the day after.  Comes out looking like it went in, kind of scary lol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If your taste buds are severely dulled and you want to experience an imperial stout, I would recommend Founder's. It could almost be described as a distilled imperial stout, with all the flavors magnified beyond the usual imperial intensity. The hops definitely make a very strong appearance at the end - this more than anything else spoils the experience a bit for me. I wonder if it would mellow out a bit if you cellared it for a few months. Also, the malt end definitely falls on the sweet side even for the style. Overall I prefer a little more subtlety and balance in an imperial stout (both the Old Rasputin and the Narwhal accomplish this), but it's worth it to experience Founder's version."
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful thick pour, looks like shiny motor oil streaming out of the bottle.  Nice feel, creamy and viscous like a good stout should be.  Only complaint is that it's a bit too sweet on the palate for my taste. But overall a very enjoyable experience."
""
"Right on the mark very impressive stout but not over powering hints of cherry. One of my favorite stouts."
"O: Definitely world class, big chocolate coffee roasted malts, easy drinking and smooth, wonderful mouthfeel, has that slight Expedition Stout soy sauce like flavor, world class, can't until Founders is available in CA, really good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Black as night, but with a taste that cannot be ignored. Apparent but not overbearing in the toasted flavor, and a pleasant undertone of cherry and chocolate. What a good beer."
"Glass- Snifter"
""
""
""
"Overall, amazing intensity, and an incredible demonstration of the brewer's skill of showing off the intense malt with perfect balance, just enough hops to balance the sweetness of the malt. (And with all that roasted malt, not a hint of any burnt malt harshness.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great Imperial, much anticipated and it delivered."
""
"Roasty and boozy. Nothing special. I don't get this at all."
""
""
"Roasted malts, chocolate, dry finish, nice to have an Imperial Stout that's no Barrel-Aged"
""
""
""
""
"Semi-sweet smooth roasted chocolate :-)"
"This is a great Imperial Stout.  Extremely smooth with a nice touch of heat at the end to let you know this is the real thing.  Good malts and chocolate flavors.   Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"An excellent stout."
""
""
"Pours really dark with a large chocolate head.  Smells of burnt coffee and burnt caramel.  Tastes are complex, burnt coffee and caramel.  Almost has a tobacco or licorice aftertaste.  Little syrupy with some carbonation.  Overall a great stout!"
""
""
""
"A gem of a Russian Stout...and to think I had this in Puerto Rico on a business trip. God bless beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything you would expect from a great all-around stout.  Smooth, even flavor of delicately toasted malt with hints of dark cocoa and a little punch at the end with some coffee.  Finishes very easy, great mouthfeel.  One of the standards when it comes to the style, nothing flashy or gimmicky, it is what you expect it to be & executes magnificently."
""
""
"Founders has become known for delivering knockout stouts, from KBS to CBS and everything beneath. This is no exception. Delivers an obsidian black color, with a chocolatey, quickly dissipating head. The aroma is powerful, including dark-roasted coffee, chocolate and molasses scent. This is reflected in the taste, which starts heavily roasty and finishes like a mocha with strong espresso and sweet dark chocolate notes. Leaves a long-lasting imprint of dark chocolate on the palate. Overall, a fantastic stout that delivers a smooth 10% ABV amidst dark, sweet flavors."
""
"Quite possibly the perfect Russian imperial....."
""
""
"Pours dark with wonderful brown creamy head.  Smell is chocolate and coffee.  The taste is wonderfully smooth.  Sweet, but I cant ID what that is.  Definetly a coffee and chocolate taste.  no bitterness.  I could drink this all night."
""
""
""
""
""
"Superb. There are few examples of a simple, non-coffee, non-pepper, non-BA stouts out there that are at the level of this. Definitely going to pick it up whenever I see it."
"Purchase Value (A) – Given the beer’s national recognition, I was surprised to pay only 11.99 for a four pack, and would gladly do so again. The folks over at Legacy Beverage were very easy to work with, and Danny’s recommendation was spot on and well appreciated."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent winter selection! One of my favorites."
""
"Overall: This is one hell of an RIS.  Complex malt flavors and probably the best mouthfeel of any stout I have had thus far."
"It might as well be bacon, it's that good."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm drinking this side-by-side with Breakfast Stout, I'm not sure which is better.  B Stout is a little smoother, but not necessarily better - and this has a higher ABV.  Incredible brew nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a quite tasty imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Great brew from a great brewery"
"O: Founders Imperial Stout is a solid beer with a big roasted malt profile that seems to have a smokiness to it. The mouthfeel is smooth and the alcohol is masked very well. I would highly recommend this beer and I will be drinking it again for sure. I would love to try this with some age on it!"
"Dry bittersweet, bakers chocolate. An amazing value for the price. Alcohol well hidden. Stock up on it while you can!"
""
""
"One of my favorites. Perfect Imperial Stout. So good and boozy I have to pace myself or I'll fall down."
""
""
"Overall- An excellently crafted imperial stout, predominantly bitter but does have just enough sweetness to balance. Can definetly get some of the hops for how young the beer is, and just adds to the bitter profile. The sweet characteristics are wonderful and decadent. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a wonderful beer that's a prime example of the style. I'll look forward to it coming out next winter as well!"
"O:  Great beer.  Dark fruit detracts from the taste somewhat, but the coffee and chocolate simply overpower this minor inconvenience."
""
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable beer but the bitterness was a little high for me.  I have a few to age  and will try them intermittently over the next few years.  Founders has been putting out some absolute quality stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well god damn, this is a fine beer.  Thanks to Jammyman for the trade.  Dark as sin with a bold toasty roasted tasty feel and vibe.  Not too showy on any level, just a solid imp stout.  Dig."
""
""
"Phenomenal stout, dangerously similar to Zhukov. Roasty,hoppy, chocolate, coffee."
""
""
""
""
"Really excited to try this. I have heard no end of great things about Founders stouts an d this certainly did not disappoint. Pours absolutely sheer jet black with one of the darkest brown heads Ive ever seen. head dissipates quickly leaving behind the viscous, oily brew. Rich creamy mocha greets you on the nose complemented by toasted malt, and chocolate covered cherries. Taste is a tidal wave of bittersweet chocolate up front with a mellow finish of earthy tobacco, and roasted coffee. Feel is thick and oily, coats every inch of your mouth. A bit sticky. but it comes with the territory. Definitely a slow sipper. Overall, one of the kings of the heavy stouts. Great in all aspects."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Jesus, what a beer!  Big, bold, beautiful flavors of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate all wrapped up in a silky smooth beer!  Outstanding!"
""
""
""
"O: On my top five list of non-barrel aged, commercially available, imperial stouts."
""
""
""
"I am sure it is an excellent stout, but the high bitterness turned me off some."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Could use a few more unique traits to separate it from the pack but what it does it does very well.  I'm glad I've got a few more bottles to see how it changes with some age on it."
""

"Creamy and thick palate. Rich flavor."

"Poured into a stout glass. Deep, dark, like the abyss.  Nice 2 finger head of dark brown.  Took off a couple for a few too many large bubbles.   Great lacing and leaves a thick layer of creamy froth as you drink.   Smell is roast, malt, coffee, chocolate and dark candi.  Just what a stout should be.   Could be a hint stronger, otherwise steller.  Taste is ambrosia. Sweat chocolate, coffee, hints of dark fruits, with roast and malt bitters and some earthy hops.  Feel is spot on.  Creamy, full bodied, effervescent.  You can't ask for better.  So this is almost the perfect stout.  As an Imperial it could use a hint more hop bitters, the head could be just a touch creamier, which might happen with age, and the smell could be subtly more intense, which would happen with the extra hops.  This is a really really good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  A big hefty American stout that I struggle to drink.  It’s got nice notes of dark roasted coffee and cream but these are overtaken by lots of burnt black malts and a bitter finish.  As it warms it does mellow out a bit and becomes more enjoyable.  Imagine chocolate covered espresso beans, awesome for some, too much for others."
"2013. So good. Really mellowed out"
""
""
""
""

"Overall really good but my own preference is for maltier"
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"This is fantastic.  Pours a dark brown/black with a burnt caramel colored head. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Taste of coffee and chocolate, roasted malt, dried figs/raisins, finishes with a smoked beef (jerkey) note. Smooth, creamy feel, super enjoyable."

"I just the other day had their Founders Porter on tap, and am now struck by the particular roasted coffee flavor in the mouth, here. Except of course this comes with an undergirding of sweetness to replace the bright/tart hop bitterness in the porter. The massive corn-syrupy, fruit-cake and pecan flavors remind me of Southern Tier Mokha, another of my favorite double stouts. The alcohol politely makes itself known on the backend."
"Pitch black pour with almost no head, and very little lacing - it was slightly disappointing. If cold, you can see the syrupy thickness of this liquid, though it really comes into its own a little warmer. Aroma is mostly of coffee, some malt and medicine. Amazingly smooth, slightly viscous mouth-feel, with flavors of coffee. Almost no alcohol flavor. Remarkable."
"The overall complexity of the beer changes as it warms so the angles and flavor notes are always on the move..."
"One of my favorite standard Imp. stouts. Doesn't hurt that it's from one of my favorite breweries either!"
""
""
""
"Overall - top notch imperial stout especially when it warms up a little."
""
""
"Pours a VERY dark brown, pretty much black. Head is mocha colored, about a finger. Aroma is coffee with hints of chocolate. Sweet and malty. Dark chocolate taste, very creamy and smooth going down. Lightly carbonated. Very, very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Such a great imperial stout and a much welcomed break and taste from barrel-aged stouts.  Can stand up to any in my opinion.  4.5!!"
""
""
"Was a really good beer. Didn't like the funk in the bottom of the glass when a swallow was left"
""

"A great outing from Founders!  Bottled on 12-2-14.  From the first pour, I am impressed.  The 1-2 dark brown finger head is a little surprising, coming from such an oily, viscous liquid, with good, foamy legs leaving a tell tale mark.  Roasted malts shine through, with just a hint of the alcohol.  A very nice rich roasted quality absolutely coats the mouth with a velvelty smoothness, and just a touch of sweetness at the very end.  A definite go to for me."

"I really enjoyed this imp stout from founders, put it comparable to narwhal in overall rating of a non-BBa stout.  As much as I like BA stouts it's good to have regular stouts since sometimes the bourbon takes over too much to taste the beer itself, this one doesn't disappoint."
""
"O - Overall this is one of the better stouts available on the shelf that isn't limited release or difficult to find. A great representation of the style and a must have for the uninitiated. Easily a go-to stout for anyone."
""
""
""
"Poured  a black body with two finger khaki head that dies slow.  Slight coffee aroma with some cocoa and roasted malts.  Thick, sticky, heavy body that has an even balance between roasted, coffee malts and chocolate sweetness with touch of vanilla and woodiness.  Well-crafted RIS that has a little more sweetness than usual in style and suits me well."

"Overall: My overall experience with this beer is that I like it a lot and I would drink it again. Although it is fresh it tastes faded, but somehow it works. Was the beer aged extensively prior to bottling? I don't know. I would recommend drinking it ""as is"" and not aging it further. I would drink another bottle of it, but I probably wouldn't keep a sixer around."

"Pours like dirty motor oil...and taste sticks with you for hours.  Solid imperial...nothing exaggerated...just solid imperial stout."

"355ml bottle. Pours black with a low, dense, deep tan head which settled to a light covering but left some nice lacing.  Aroma of chicory, roasted malt, burnt wood, liquorice, prunes, soy sauce, dark chocolate and caramel. Medium sweetness and quite high bitterness. Full bodied, chewy but with a silky smooth, luscious texture. Low carbonation and a very long, burnt tar finish. Gentle warmth from the alcohol. A wonderfully complex drop and an excellent example of an imperial stout."
"Very niice very niice i like"
""
"-- Thickest pouring stout ever. More umami, less roast/coffee and more hops than expected. Definitely at one end of the scale; almost a bookend to fun-and-accessible Founders Breakfast that way. Massive. 4.25"

"On tap at One Under Bar in Livonia, MI in Nov, 2014. Heavy, chocolate, coffee, complexity, decadence. A must have for any enthusiast. I encourage you to seek this out in your local beverage depot in January."

"Just an outstanding imperial stout.  High marks in all the boxes as far as I'm concerned.  A must, to be experienced.  Don't take my word for it, at ~$3 a bottle, live a little and try one.  You won't regret it.  I buy this by the case."

"O: one of the best overall Imperial Stouts.  It has a deep thick texture and a great deep chocolate roast taste. This beer is a little better without the age but it's still pretty great right now."

"Perfect version of the style."

"Pours black with a chocolate head. Aroma has some roast mixed with molasses, bakers chocolate, bread and a touch of anise.  Flavor begins roasty with some molasses, mocha latte comes in towards the middle in transitions into a bakers chocolate with some char. A fuller, heavy mouthfeel. Overall, good beer but I wanted to like this more than I actually did. In the future, I will stick with Tenfidy when in the mood for a big RIS."

"Great stout"
""
"Poured a pitch black body letting no light through with a one finger, thick tan head. A wonderful looking Russian Imperial Stout, one of the best. Scents of rich roasted malt, dark chocolate, a light milk chocolate, coffee with cream, and a bit of rich caramel. Overall impression of aroma is of a rich, deep, complex Imperial stout aroma that is wonderfully balanced and true to style. Very chocolate-forward and roasty and pleasant. Flavor begins rich and full, with notes of roast malt, a bit of a smokey flavor, sweet chocolate and bittersweet chocolate, light notes of alcohol and caramel. Middle opens with more moderate alcohol, continues with more roast malt, smokiness, rich cocoa powder and bittersweet chocolate. Caramel drops off. Finish is medium-sweet with a high presence of alcohol, moderate roast malt and smokiness, medium-light bittersweet chocolate and coffee with cream. Aftertaste is dark roasted black coffee, rich cocoa powder and bitter roast malt with a light alcohol presence. Overall impression of flavor is of a bold, roasty, smokey, boozy Imperial stout that is still balanced by a nice sweetness that switches between caramel and chocolate and a wonderfully roasty and coffee-like aftertaste. A very robust flavor profile and nice, though intense. Mouthfeel is full bodied medium-light carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Alcohol burn is not present, despite the booziness of the flavor. Overall impression of flavor is of a full bodied and smooth Imperial stout that is very nice and true to style. Overall this is a good Imperial stout. It has a wonderful aroma profile that is very pleasing and a nicely robust, rich and deep flavor profile that is pleasantly boozy. Mouthfeel is true to form and quite smooth. A very good Imperial stout, well worth trying thought not quite as good as FBS and KBS."

"A dark tan head falls quickly off a black body.  Has a pleasant and nuanced, milk chocolate, black licorice, and damp wood aroma.  Taste is equally pleasant until bold woody, hoppy notes kick in-vigorating.  Some prune, black licorice and chocolate cake feels it's way through.  Yin up front and yang in the back and finishes perfectly balanced as one."

"Wow is this black. Even the head is a major shade of blackish brown. Had to pour very hard to get the head. Smells like cocoa pebbles. Minimal roast smell, lots of chocolate. Flavor is all chocolate. Not any alcohol taste, even though it is 10.5%. This is easily the thickest beer I've ever felt. Even thicker than Bourbon County. There is some peaty roast flavors as well now that I've gotten used to the chocolate. I’m sure as I drink more, I’ll taste more."

"This is a tremendous RIS. It pours pitch black with little to no head to speak of. It has a nice smell, with chocolate and coffee notes underneath a layer of alcohol. The taste is similar, like dark chocolate, with strong hops and some alcohol showing through. This beer strikes a particularly good balance between hops and chocolaty sweetness for an RIS. The mouthfeel is a little bit sticky with a thick feeling. An excellent RIS that I would highly recommend to anyone."

"Pours a black beer. Very little foam forms, almost typical of imperial stouts. Smells like roasts, chocolate, coffee. No trace of alcohol. Taste is ""silky smooth"" to quote the Zohan. Mouthfeel is amazing. This beer feels like chocolate milk. Great consistency. Not heady."

"2 Complaints - Only served in 12 ounce glass. Availability. Founders has yet to disappoint me. With ABV this high one might expect this might not be smooth, aou contraire (probably spelled wrong) Yummy and very drinkable! Car service should be included with purchase of 3 or more."

"Food match: Founders Breakfast Stout, cigars and foul language."
"O: What can I say about this that I haven't already said or hundreds of folks before me haven't said? Founders glances over at other brewers and says, ""Oh? You guys have a RIS? That's cute, but ours is better."" The fact of the matter here, for me, is that this might be the most divine RIS I've ever had the pleasure to consume, and without a doubt one of the finest beers I've ever had the privilege to consume. If I could have one materialistic dying wish... Making this year-round would definitely be a consideration."

"O- This is one of the best Imperial stouts out there and something I would choose over even some barrel aged stouts. I might say I like this more than KBS. Really feel spoiled here in Michigan being around so much FIS, Expedition, and Plead the 5th."

""

" In closing, this is a really good RIS that will taste great when the evenings are cold and the rattlesnakes go back into their dens this winter. This reminds me a lot of Old Raspy, a good thing, and I would love to do a head to head with the two next fall!"

"O: I had set this one aside for a special occasion (first triathlon of the year). I think I let it warm a little too much - I wish I'd sipped it a little colder and let it warm during my session. The appearance is outstanding and the beer has a nice robust smell. One of these is enough at a time. Very nice for sipping. It would be better by a fire place with snow outside."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"T: Even better than the smell somehow. This stuff is legit! Lots of espresso and dark chocolate covered espresso beans right away. Middle brings some sweeter toffee, milk chocolate and dark fruit notes. Finish brings a sharp kick of anise, char and a bit of tobacco alongside a ton of heavily roasted malt. One of the best stouts I've ever come across and probably the best RIS I've had."
""
""
""
""
"I love the progress of our country to have this beauty officially imported we are very lucky and it pours a pitch blackish brown hue with three finger chocolate laced head that stays all day long,the smell is mily chocolate,raisins,dark berries and light mocha,the mouthfeel is thick,slick and silky smooth with light carbonation which suits perfectly and on taste it's a nice mix of sweet milky mocha and punchy fruity hops with the ABV very well hidden and overall definately something you have to taste for yourself and yeah like it says put another log on the fire and sit back cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: By no means the greatest RIS i have ever tried, but still great nonetheless. Full flavored yet extremely balanced. Creamy, slightly carbonated, sweet, and bitter all at the same time. As a bonus, this beer also has a smokey profile. A great ""dessert"" to sip on after a long days hard work. Enjoy!"

"Edit: Just had another that was considerably colder and I liked it much more, it becomes more viscous and loses a lot of the overpowering smoke. Thick and syrupy with no alcohol coming over in the taste."

"Founders Imperial Stout is a beer that reminds me of why I got into craft beer in the first place and of just what makes these offerings so special; this is a world-class beer that will impress even the most skeptical drinker whether he even actually likes it or not.

"Deep dark black in color and will not yield to any light. A minimal showing of dark brown head covers about half of the top of the beer. Brussels lacing. Aroma of fig and roasted malt. I later smelled fig and alcohol. The taste is initially a sharp burst of bitter roasted malt and then an does an abrupt about face to an intense plum,fig,and alcoholic sweetness that stays with you after the fade. Mouth is thick,sticky,and very dry."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is quite an exceptional beer, but for those who are interested in deep dark flavors. The bitterness in this does not let up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Damn this is good. Drinks a lot like TenFidy (one of my favorites). Rich, creamy flavor with a superior malt and chocolate punch - Fantastic mouthfeel really pulls the whole experience together - a delightful sipper, superb flavor, an excellent overall experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It was presented to me black with about a finger of brown head. Smelling it, I get a lot of roasted grains with chocolate, charred wood with a hint of smoke, some coffee, and a slight hop aroma. The taste is much more chocolate-forward. It has a dark chocolate and cocoa powder profile carrying a vein of caramel, with a creamy, full mouthfeel throughout. It finishes with a roasty burnt oat taste with a manageable level of astringency."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste also brings out the dark rich malty character with a biting early bitterness roaring up from behind and leading to a dry finish. This is about as luscious as an Imperial Stout can be. Definitely a beer to return to and the price is reasonable."

"Overall. WOW! I am impressed. and this stout is not even aged. Its jet black, amazing appearance, smells like an Imperial should, and tastes even better than i thought. It is a little pricey for a 4pk but, well worth it. Best imperial I have had to date. One to remember that's for sure. Exceeded my expectations, and then some."

"EDIT (4/9/14) - Had one today. Just as good as ever. Superb beer. I have a 2012 sitting in the fridge (don't worry it was cellared for a year), and I can't wait to crack it open. In comparison with a 2014 KBS that Core42, a fellow BA, was kind enough to send me free of charge, I find FIS to be slightly, slightly superior. Of course, I don't actually care as much for bourbon stouts. It was still delicious, and if you do like bourbon stouts, then I imagine you'll like it more, but FIS is just that good. A high caliber stout that is a well-accessible. Well done, Founders!"

"Having a four way tasting tonight between Plead the 5th, Old Rasputin, Ten fiddy, and this. It's my second of the four pours. The appearance of this stout is simply overwhelming. It pours a very near jet black with just a slight amount if light escaping through around the edges. The head is a large but short lasting beautiful dark brown color (one of the darkest, most handsome heads I have ever seen). It leaves a substantial film and lots of silky lacing. The nose is rather boozy and bitter. Notes of burnt coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and vanilla abound. The mouthfeel is viscous and coats every inch of the palate as it slowly slides down the throat. The flavor is over the top rich and decadent. A very bitter blend of vanilla, chocolate, and a lasting finish of dark roasted coffee. It is a very bold beer. At only a few months old, this stout is near obscenely in your face but I'm quite sure it will smooth with age. Good thing I've got three more in the cellar."

"A-"
"O: amazing, sublime. No need for the Boubon Barrel aging. No need for adding coffee or chocolate. Proves that a wondersful RIS can be world class without those things. Testament to amazing brewing. Highly rated but honestly under the radar with FBS and KBS. I have a bunch aging also but this is a sublime amazing beer for those lovers of stouts."

"Overall - Excellent! especially on the second day. Do not eat any food with this one. Enjoy this monster hours before or hours after dinner. Trying to pair with salt or sweet diminished the experience and created an over bitter taste. Drinking without food was fairly erotic and very satisfying. Wish my wife would try it with me but to dark for her. I really like this and enjoyed thoroughly on a cold winters night. The buzz is noteworthy as well if you stick to less than 3 pints. I will look for this again next fall/winter/spring."

"Love this beer. Giving it a proper review (as I have recently started to spend more time mulling over and considering the finer points of all of these wonderful brews). Poured from 12 ounce bottle into my snifter. Midnight black with a tiny cocoa-tinged head that was literally gone in seconds. The aromas were v. pleasant (even when the beer was v. cold); coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, and the slightest whiff of tobacco. The taste was perfect... molasses, dark fruit (fig?), some alcohol, and a crisp, clean bitterness. Slight coffee aftertaste. Genius in a bottle. Of course, a very viscous, heavy mouthfeel... so deep and satisfying. The key to the FIS is its big flavors, but the secret (and reason it is/will be one of my favorites) is the balance. Brilliant."
""
""
""
"O - One of, if not my favorite imperial stouts. Big roasted malt flavors and the expected chocolate and espresso notes and it's done so well. Nice hop bite at the end makes this one different in a good way and keeps it from being cloying."

"Overall - 2nd time I've reviewed this beer, and it's just as beautiful as it's ever been. Wonderfully deep and complex, yet manages a perfect harmony of flavors to deliver the most wonderful imperial stout this world has seen. I don't believe in perfect scores, but this comes damn close. It's a top 3 beer for me, blowing every other non-BA impy out of the water. Founders, California NEEDS this beer!Hopefully your recent vertical expansion leads to horizontal expansion!"

"To think I almost passed this bad boy up. This is phenomenal. I cannot be effusive enough in my praise. Seriously good work there, Founders."
""

"Oily black in color with a thick viscous appearance. Poured with a thick, short espresso-like foam that quickly reduced to creamy, wispy cap. Rich dark chocolate and earthy, grainy, roasted malt aromas with a touch of dark fruit, wet tobacco, bitter coffee and boozy overtones. Full bodied with slick, oily feel up front and tangy hop bite toward the end. Dark chocolate and roasted malt flavors up front followed by slowly emerging pine and citrus hop bitterness through the middle. A brief note of sweet dark fruit and bittersweet chocolate followed once again  by intensifying hop bitterness. Finished with a lingering charred malt and pine hop bitterness. Incredible complexity in aroma and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Initial appearence looks great. Nice thick chocolate moch head. Aroma has roast, espresso, booziness, cocoa, dark-bitter chocolate. Taste is very complex with dark chocolate, molasses, espresso, with a dry and burnt bitter ending - as to be expected at 90 IBU. Quite unique and definitely one of the best RIS out there."
""
"Dark lusciousness in a glass! You can taste the blackness and it is good!! Yes, indeed, there is plenty of depth and complexity to be found in a glass of this RIS. It's not overly sweet and emphasizes the roasted grains and hop bittering while tastefully blending the alcohol heat and slight astringency into the overall taste profile. Deep and inviting, and well-worth looking into."
""
""
"Jet black (are jets black?) Looks like burned motor oil. Viscous as well. Awesome dark 2 finger half cooked pancake head. Smells great, like dark chocolate cherry. In taste the aromas are also represented with coffee and a nice earthiness. Definitely a thick, sturdy stout. Not a session beer at 10.5 but if youre like me and only have one or two and make them count..cant lose with this one"
""
"Pours out a jet black body with a head that looks like chocolate mousse. I get a lot of chocolate in the aroma, along with citrus hops. Taste is rather sweet, and full of your typical stout flavors of coffee, chocolate, and roasty bitterness. Aftertaste of resinous hops and ash. Booze heat in the finish. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, and gives a tingling carbonation. Overall, this is a solid imperial stout, but it doesn't do very much to wow."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow.. This ones amazing. The taste is bitter chocolate and cocoa. Dark malts and some dark fruits. The mouthfeel isn't too thick which is making this go down really easy. If this beer was limited, it would receive hype similar to some of the barrel aged beers that people are crazy about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.75/5): I guess Founders really knows the art of brewing imperial stout, huh? Founders Imperial Stout, with its abundance of espresso-esque roastiness, dark chocolate decadence, and interesting brown sugar/molasses undertones, is without a doubt the most intense and flavorful example of the classic Russian Imperial Stout style that I've had the pleasure of drinking. Sublime. Let it warm up and witness a beautiful evolution of flavor!"

"O: I opened this to celebrate some special news. This beer has aged beautifully. Flavors abound as it warms gaining sweetness. Aged this is arguably as good or slightly better than FBS. Buy it if you find it."

"Overall, excellent imperial stout."
""

"Poured the beer, thick like molasses and oh so dark black in color, into a snifter around 55-60 degrees. Everything quickly got better as the beer approached room temperature. Beautiful mocha colored 1/2inch thick head that did quickly retreat with some lacing. The aroma was quite alluring with hints of chocolate, toffee, maybe roast, and some hints of vanilla. Taste was to die for; coffee, fudge, bittersweet chocolate, and fruits. Thick and smooth with a velvet creamy mouthfeel on the palate. Founders, again, has impressed me with one of their brews. Truly one of the best imperial stouts out there; in my opinion. Highly recommend this one!"

"A classic for a good reason. Black as night with a creamy head, like a chocolate milkshake. Very thick and creamy. My exact idea of what an imperial stout shoud be like. Taste is intense and powerful: lots of roasted malts, and hints of coffee, chocolate, and some dried fruit. A great beer that would be at the top of the heap if it were just slightly less roasty."
""

"BOD 12/8/13. Dark as a starless night pour with a big milk chocolate head. Magnificent lacing that lasts. Slightly sweet nose of dark chocolate with hints of plum, smoke and molasses over a rich roast background. Full bodied with a slick creamy texture - perfect. The flavor profile is complex and well balanced. It begins with a creamy slightly sweet dark chocolate, follows with notes of plum and molasses, progresses to a sweeter milk chocolate coupled with a touch of smoke and finishes with a nice burst of roast. The finish is smooth and ends with a light alcohol burn and taste. If the alcohol was better covered, this stout would be perfect."
"Dark brown stout with a flat tan head. Has a malty aroma and a nice roasted malty flavor with some dark chocolate and bitterness thrown in. This is a beer I look forward to revisiting after aging a bottle. Very complex, very smooth, and very enjoyable."

"Overall, this is one of the best beers I've had in awhile. It's a take that doesn't rely on any crazy components like additives or barrel-aging, but instead is just a perfect example on how the art of brewing can create a wonderfully delicious beverage. It was good by itself, but could be easily paired with food. Sweet and big enough to be a ""dessert beer", but with enough balance to drink just anytime. Right about now I'm wishing I had picked up more than a 4-pack."

"It's a world class beer."
""
""
"Considering I just had a Narwhal last night, I can certainly put this beer in context of great (non-BA) imperial stouts. My senses' consensus is that, yes: this is a great, great stout, worthy of enjoying along with any of the big boys out there. It's not a coffee stout, and it's not excessively chocolate-focused; it's just a solid, basic, but exceptionally well-crafted imperial stout. No more, but certainly not less."

"O - Excellent stout, a slow sipper, perfect for cold nights weathering whatever silly named (or, more correctly, silly being the fact that they are now giving them names) winter storm we encounter over the next few months."
""
""
"Update: Bottle dated 12/7/13 enjoyed on 11/4/14: 11 months in the bottle has improved this nicely. I'm revising my score upwards to reflect the latest bottle. Everything has melded together nicely. The hop character is still prominent and the beer is still quite bitter and campfire ashy. However the light chocolatey sweetness and slick and silky mouthfeel feel decadent. There are some very slight sherry undertones that add a wonderful complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours without a head and then a very thin head forms that quickly dissipated. Very thick black color. Smells like a typical dark stout. Nice slightly sweet taste without bitterness. Has a nice thickness to it. The 10% ABV shows up towards the finish. I really like this one."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is thick, full bodied and creamy with some stickiness left behind. This is just what I'm looking for in an imperial stout, with tons of dark flavors, thick feeling and excellent complexity."

""
"Overall: I will definitely drink this beer again!"

"My initial tastes were at a colder temperature than ideal for the beer, and my enjoyment grew as the beer warmed (not shockingly). However, It never quite got to the point of being as good as I had hoped. I do have a few more to try to see if maybe this was an off night. On retry, the beer got close to room temp while I was sidetracked, and the astringent-bitter tastes mellowed, but the alcohol became more noticeable."
""
""
""
"D/O: Amidst Founders' limited releases such as KBS and the Backstage delicacies, this much more obtainable beer quietly shines. Huge in its application of sensory qualities, it does not so much err from traditional form as it magnifies and enlarges it. It is an under-appreciated top-shelf contribution to the imperial stout style."
"O- an amazing example of the style, intense the whole way through and will stay on the palate long after consuming. A little less smoke and char would bump the taste up to a 5"
""
""
""
""
""
"It's hard to try and find something wrong with this ale. Complex combination of flavors intertwine into this silky mouthfeel that begs you take another sip. The long lingering after palate is complemented with dark roasted malty bitterness. Perfect beer for a night cap."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I expected more out of this beer, being a big fan of Founders in general. I felt, however, that the flavors here were quite basic for an imperial stout. It was strong, hoppy, and close to overpowering, but didn't have the back end complexity of a truly great stout. I have a couple bottles in the cellar, and hopefully they get wiser with age. As it stands, I just can't call this beer a top 100."
"Poured into stem stout glass, appearance was little to no head. Head that was apparent was beautiful tan cream. Opaque color (black/brown). Smell had chocolate and coffee notes. Taste was much smokier than I had anticipated. Very boozy as well. Sifts in mouth extremely well, despite overwhelming character. Overall an above average beer that I see aging well."
""
"Overall: very solid stout from Founders. I've come to expect nothing less from them. It doesn't blow me away like their American style offerings, but that's not to take anything away from it as American Imperial Stouts are one of my two favorite styles. As far as Russian Imperial Stouts go, this is probably the second best I've had the pleasure of enjoying, right behind Ten Tidy, and just ahead of Old Rasputin"

"tulip: black, completely opaque. coffee+cream colored head. rich aroma of chocolate. hint of booze. faint. more chocolate. one of the richest and smoothest feel I've had in a while. the chocolate is so present. very roasty on the back end and a lingering alcohol taste but it is warming and pleasant"

"Pours a solid black with a small dark khaki head. There's a hint of ruby around the edges. Great lacing. A beautiful stout to behold. On the nose there's lots of coffee, chocolate and dark roasted malt. As it warms, hints of smoke and vanilla come through. Outstanding aroma! On the palate, hop bitterness gives way to a chocolate and coffee bomb! Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Little carbonation lends to the smoothness of this great stout. Overall, this is the finest non-BA Imperial Stout I've ever had."

"O - A great example of an Imperial Stout. I won't make it a regular (like Founder's breakfast stout), but it's certainly an every now and then sipping beer to keep in the rotation. Prost!"
"This is the first time I've had this ale and it exceeded my expectations. I enjoy this much more than the FBS, primarily because of the feel. Man this is smooth. The booze is prolific but it works. I think if it ages it will be even better."
""
""
"Quick note: I really love this beer, but unlike most people, I prefer sipping on this one when it's a bit colder. As it warms, the alcohol becomes much more prominent as well as harsh, and the brew becomes really syrupy sweet. If I were to review this one at its recommended serving temperature (I'm not sure what it is, but probably quite warm), I'd not like it as much. I like it soon after it comes out of the fridge, because I pick up more desirable characteristics."
""

"Wonderful coffee aroma beautiful black and color has an absolutely outstanding sick mouth feel good deal of hops and very stiff coffee backbone. This beer is full-bodied and demand your full attention although this is usually my type of beer the flavor color and Romar absolutely fantastic and I would highly recommend it to any stout drinker"
""
"O - Pouring as black as night, it's easy to smell and taste this beer's robust chocolate profile that's complimented with undertones of espresso and raisin flowing through maduro cigar wrapper. This imperial stout's thick and gritty entry finishes with balanced bitterness and an impeccable smoothness that makes it one of the best imperial stouts on the market and one that's suitable for prolonged aging!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is... average. First of all, I love founders brewing and worship them, but I'm sorry... I must have come across a lot of beers in the past year because I wouldn't have believed I would say this back when I first tried this stout. This is in the same class as Tenfidy, except tenfidy outclasses this with a bit more complexity and more bold and robust chocolate and dark fruits. This one kind of fell short of the mark to today's my-standards. Perhaps using the word, ""imperial," these days, I tend to expect a lot. It's just a stout. It's really just your standard stout, you get dark chocolate, coffee, and a bit of dark fruits on the taste, and just dark chocolate and coffee on the exhale. Nothing more, nothing less. It is not world-class worthy. Maybe they fucked around with the original recipe for this beer, because it definitely is not worth remembering anymore. 8/10."

"This is exactly what you expect when you imagine an imperial stout. Great flavor upfront with a great stout finish. Not as choclatey as most stouts but it's an imperial so thats to be expected. There is a good coffee flavor finish. Great smell when opened, good coffee scent.Bought two 4 packs, one two drink immediately and the other to age. Overall one of my top 10 beers."

"Founders Imperial Stout is a Russian Imperial Stout with a great big 10.5% ABV~ Probably pours as dark as I have ever seen, just flat black.. period~ Head was as present as could be on an Imperial Stout, bubbly and lasted about 5 minutes with lacing that went for eternity~ Feel was right on par for such a HUGE stout, big, thick, meaty, yet silky and creamy enough to satisfy all the way around~ Aroma is Campfire, Roasted Malts, Figs, Oats, Dark Fruit, Vanilla, Bready Malt, Sweet Molasses, Plum and Cherry~ Taste was just lovely... Dark Chocolate, Licorice, Cinnamon, Espresso, Banana, Milkshake, Carmel, Sea Salt, Butterscotch and smokey toness shine through~ Sure it has some sting and bitterness at 10.5~ It also has great balance, smoothness and complexity, it's not for beginners as she is a bruiser and a half, a stout that will land you in a comma~ Founders balances it out enough to make this a treat worth sipping, granted it would be tough to drink more than a few, this would make be the perfect drink for snow day as they don't come much heartier~ Overall: 93"

""
"O: Thank The Lord I bought a four pack of this because I would love to taste this beer over different periods of aging. Magnificent character and a much have for any RIS enthusiast."
"O- My first ever beer by Founders. Can see the hype behind their beers. This leaves me definitely wanting to try their other varieties of stout."

"Overall: Ohhh boy. This is dangerous - I can drink this MUCH faster than the other stouts I've recently reviewed. I'd say that this goes down almost too easy, but since when is that a bad thing when in the confines of one's own home and not driving back from a bar?"
""

"O- One of the greatest examples of the style."
""

"O: I have been waiting along time for this brew to come town. And now it's here and at a beer-store 3 blocks away, a slippery slope if I ever saw one. This is probably the best Imperial stout, that hasn't been barrel aged, that I have tried, and that's a lot of them. Right now, if I had to choose one beer to drink for the rest of my life, it would be this one."

"O- great imperial russian stout by founders. Hides the high ABV well"
"Founders has been somewhat jokingly marketing this as a ""winter warmer"" and they pretty much hit the nail on the head. It's a huge, immensely powerful RIS that essentially takes a dump on its competition. That's pretty damn special for how (relatively) easily available it is. I'll take a case!"

"O I had never had this beer prior and I blind tasted it against a ten fidy which was my favorite non B.A.I.S. The more I drank this the more I liked it and preferred it over the ten fidy. This was so much bigger and more decadent. By comparison the ten fidy seemed much more mild. This is an excellent example of the style"

"O- this is a delicious big flavor imperial ale."
"Overall - A very fine Russian Imperial sampling. Got to let this one warm up to balance and remove the bitterness from the hops, then it really dials in nicely. If you like RIS's like Old Raspy, you'll very much appreciate what Founders has made with this version."

"O: This was really tasty. As I feel like I say about so many of the Founders' 12 oz. offerings - it's not as good as the best in class, but for a beer that sees wide distribution and I can pick up off the shelf in a four-pack, it's very well-done."

"So excited when the local store called to let me know the 2014 FIS was delivered today. Ran down there to pick up my 4 packs when they called. Pours black as oil from the bottle into my Founders Snifter. Excellent dark blackish brown head the subsides ever so slowly. Coffee, raisin, roasty, caramel notes dominate the nose. The first sip tells me I'm in for a treat. There's a lot of stuff going on here. This beer is incredible. Fantastic finish, with an incredible chewy mouth feel. I can't wait to see how this beer tastes with some age on it."
""
""
"Overall: Another winner from Founders. Super flavorful and pretty drinkable considering what a big beer this is. One of the best non barrel aged stouts out there."
""
""
""
"Gorgeous beer. Seriously. Wow. Deep brown, luscious head. Dark, robust aromas of black strap molasses, the darkest and richest chocolate you can imagine, and freshly roasted malt that you scoop up with your hands and shove into your nose. So mellowed out with flavor that's just off the charts. Unbelievable, really. Insane amounts of roasted and charred malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar. And a delicious and welcome complement of warming booze. Incredible body with perfect carbonation. Drinkability is absurd! I could drink this all night (and regret it the next morning). Had to bump it up from a straight 4.5! This was incredible fresh but with some age on it, this beer just shines. Simple as that."
""
"O- Ive been waiting for awhile to try this and its lived up to all the expectations and surpassed them. Right from the pour you can see the beauty in it. Thick, full, smells wonderfull and tastes better. Going to get some for the shelf for sure, Highly recommend this to anyone that likes Good Stouts."

"Half finger dark tan head on a jet black body, some lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate, banana bread, coffee, vinegar, roasted malts and soap. Not very sweet smelling, mostly bitterness. Flavor is much better with a nice balance between confectioners semisweet dark chocolate and espresso beans, coffee bitterness on a roasted malt background. Thick body with carbonation a little greater than I want fore the style. I like the degree of earthiness and bitterness. Some of these has too much vanilla sweetness."

"When I already thought Founders had proven everything to me in the book about good roasted stouts, this comes along. What a monster of beer. Showcases every aspect of roasted malt, spice, fruitiness, sweetness, and consistency that the style should have. Definitely a sipper in its own respect, and it's high ABV and bitter flavor is not for the faint of heart. One of my new favorite strong stouts of all time, here and probably forever."

"The flavors with two years of age are really coming together, the dark chocolate and slightly sweet and roasty flavors are fantastic. I bet you could set this aside for another year or two and still see that roastiness get even more whispy. It will never be a truly sweet stout, but it is hearty; and it is great."

"For years now this has been my favorite imperial stout on the market. Better than most limited releases that people praise. Founder's version is all at once bold, rich, dry, and fucking awesome. Oh, it's available too, 48oz for $11. Show me something better, I'm all ears."
""
""
""
""

""

"O - 4.25 - This is a robust, stiff, powerful tasting, no-apologies imperial. It's good. When you want to feel it, like when you take a good belt of whiskey or tequila and feel that harsh goodness, this is one to grab. It's still very well composed, but unmistakeably muscular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was thick and full, as expected for the style. Drinkability was good, for a 10+% Stout, it's a sipper, not a slammer. Overall, a very fine brew indeed. It's not really significantly different from a lot of other big Stouts out there, but it's definitely worth trying when you can."

"Great beer. Another home run from Founders."
"355mL into a snifter. Pours a used motor oil pitch black with a micro dark tan head that settles quickly to nothing. Crazy aroma of oak, bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, and almost overpowering spicy white alcohol. For 90 IBUs and 10%, the taste is incredibly smooth with some oak, espresso, roasted malt, and vanilla moving to piney hops with warming alcohol like whiskey. Velvety mouthfeel. Full-bodied. Crazy and insane. A lot better than KBS dumping the green coffee and tomato-ey bourbon stickiness."
""
""
""
"UPDATE 4/24/14: New fourpack bought a few months ago and saved for later. This is still great but the bitterness stands out more, the flavor a bit less. Lowering ratings accordingly: a: 4.5-4.25; s:4.5-4.25; t: 4.75-4.5; overall 4.75-4.5."

"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This is black, very black. Like staring into an abyss ... only darker. Head, what little there is, is classic stout - cafe au lait brown. It's like espresso froth. Smell is mocha, nibs of dark chocolate with hints of coffee and orange. Taste is sweet toasty malt, balanced by dark cacao bitterness. Thick and chewy, creamy and yet with dark cocoa chalkiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This bottle is going on a few years old but is still drinking fantastic. It has a lingering bitterness and you can tell it is made from quality ingredients. Not sure it's head and shoulders above some of the other good RIS's out there, but it is surely a very good beer."

"Thick toasted Carmel, almost like the best toasted marshmallow you have ever had in your life. The sweetness of the beer disguises the alcohol you will soon be filling. I have drank a lot of imperial stouts and this is in my top three! I suggest you shares four pack with someone who likes good ale at a time when you can truly enjoy this great beer!"
""
""
""
""
"One of the best non-barrel aged Russian Imperial Stouts out there. Some other RIS's it compares well to include Storm King, Ten FIDY and Plead the 5th. If this one got barrel-aged, I dare say it could hold up very well to some of the big barrel-aged imperial stouts out there. Anyway, the price and quality of this beer makes for a fantastic value here. If you see this sitting on the shelf even now, I would still recommend picking it up."
""
""
""
"Pours a thick syrupy black with a dark brown head, thick, that fizzles out quickly. Malty aroma with a hint of coffee and chocolate. Taste is smooth and not boozy at all. Nice hint if coffee and malts. Smooth mouthfeel. One of the best imperial stouts. Delicious!"

"Pretty good fresh but I'll look forward to this beer with some age on it."

"Damn! This is a f... great RIS. If you are a true fan of Russian Imperial Stouts, then you must try it. The litany of greatness is clear here: Old Rasputin, Storm King and (now) Founder's Imperial Stout. Drink it or die."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich creamy black with a small brown head, mild lacing. Dark roasted chocolate malt and dark fruit plums and liquorices fill the senses. Taste is of dark roasted chocolate malt, dark fruit, cacao, mild liquorices and bitter hops. A full bodied smooth rich and creamy mouth feel. Finishes with a combination of rich dark chocolate malt, dark fruity flavors of plums, ending is sweet bitter chocolate flavor. Overall an excellent, tasty, and flavorful Imperial Stout, Very nice indeed."

"O: While Founders rarely disappoints, there is something to be said about their stouts and this does not deviate from the rest. Silky smooth, not sweet at all, like a espresso chocolate milkshake or frap, with a slight alcoholic tinge, it is beautiful drinkable, complex enough to keep you interested with it's array of smoked, burnt, roasted malts... just a extremely well made stout that doesn't really put a foot wrong."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, it leaves something to be desired from other comparable offerings from Founders, but it certainly stands its ground as an exceptional Russian Imperial."
""
""
""

"This is my second time trying this beer. A lot of imperial stouts try hard to be balanced an master the style, but few succeed. The midnight color and tan fizzy head personify this classic style. Carbonation is nice and dances everytime I swirl the glass. Smell is somewhat muted. Dark and roasty malts, but nothing really pops out. The taste is what sets this beer apart. There is a lightly roasted mocha caramel blend that would be an awesome Starbucks flavor if it could be implemented. The roast is subtle, not overcome by coffee like our KBS cousin. The acidity is lax as well which exemplifies the creaminess of its texture. I'm drinking this on a highly humid night where it's more that 75 degrees outside and enjoying the heck out of this beer. Stouts aren't just for warming you up, especially if they are as well crafted as this one."

"truly exceptional stout right here. I love the fact that it isn't sweet at all, and it doesn't try to hide what it is. very straightforward stuff. the pours is almost jet black, just the darkest shade of brown in there, with a patient but excited mocha colored head that swirls right back up as soon as it settles. the nose is very alcoholic, but its not aggressive or cheap vodka style, its there as a reminder, or maybe a warning. I pick up some good wood in this too, maybe birch or maple, something lighter than oak for sure, more fresh. there is a cocoa bitterness throughout the flavor, that climaxes toward the finish. lots of dark dark roasted barley here, and a certain earthen quality that fills in for the usual residual sugar. it makes the beer more drinkable than it should be. I love the mouthfeel, soft as crushed velvet, but with enough carbonation for its huge body not to get filling. it also finishes fairly clean for a style that usually clings to the teeth for ages. alcohol is warming but not offensive, and the absence of sweetness is astounding and really quite unique in the big stout world. I can finally see for myself what all they hype is about, and this is a beer for the ages. hard to imagine kbs and cbs being even better, but I will find that out for myself as well..."

"Poured into pokal. Jet black with a thin brown head that fades quickly, leaving incredibly fine lacing. Smell is coffee and roasted malts. Taste is huge; coffee, chocolate, roasted everything, all over the tongue. Delicious bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. Alcohol not noticeable for how much it is; mouthfeel full and creamy. Awesome stout!"

"Good beer overall I'm fairly new to stouts (enjoying them that is). The aroma is a little lack luster I expected more from as rich looking of a beer. The flavor is fantastic has great taste up front with a little bite that I enjoy. It isn't as coffee flavored as alot of other stouts I have had. The finish is quite good however about 20 seconds after you take a drink it does leave a slightly bitter taste far back in the throat. All in all a very good stout, I would order it again!"
""
""
""
"Never considered myself a stout man but this beer changed my opinion of stout's. Was like drinking an extremely smooth dark chocolate/espresso milkshake. What a beer... maybe the best I have ever had. Poured thick with no immediate head but a nice 3/4 inch amber head formed at the top. Nice lacing on the glass. Honestly was sad to finish the glass now I am on a crazy search to find more. Great job Founders!"
""

"O- A bit one-sided. I was thinking this would be fantastic since there's a good amount of age on it (and it has been cellared properly) but I'd be more interested in trying a fresher one."

""
""
""
""
"notes: Another Founder's masterpiece! Again, a Founder's beer scores high on all criteria. Beautiful to look at, wonderful aroma, amazing mouthfeel and outstanding taste. Little wonder that they are one of my favorite breweries. Like all beers I love this balances rich maltiness with a strong bitterness. In this case the bitterness comes from the charred/ roasted malt rather than the hops. The chocolate and coffee are thick and rich. Probably the best Imp. Stout I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"a full body stout with a slight amount of carbonation. creamy on the lips, slightly chalky after feel. this is an excellent stout that you shouldn't pass up trying. sure, it's not as good as their barrel aged stouts, but it's still DAMN good."

"O: I take this and Ten Fidy to be the best instantiations of the Platonic Form of a non-BA RIS. This beer is just a fantastic example of the style and would satisfy me any night of the week, any season of the year."
""
""
"Overall - This is a fantastic and world class stout from a brewery that really knows what they are doing with stouts. This has to be the second best stout I have ever had (behind only Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout) and my personal favorite from Founders, yes even over KBS and Breakfast stout. Where this stout has less flavors, perhaps than the previous two, it makes up for it with the astounding mouthfeel and malt bill. If you are a stout fan then you must try this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I do like this beer. It is has a pronounced coffee presence and the chocolate is tasty, but more bitter than I anticipated. I think I like Ten Fidy a better, it has more of that wow factor. I have an extra bottle that I am going to hang on for a while and see how it matures."

"12 oz bottle. Thanks Samp01 for sharing. Pours dark brown with short lived, creamy, brown head. Aroma is of bready malt, raisins, plums, cacao, vanilla and brown sugar. Body is full and creamy. Taste is burnt grain, bready malt, herbal hops, dark fruit, brown sugar and some alcohol. Finish is long and bitter. Very nice RIS."

"Spectacular! I've had a number of imperial stouts this winter that do not measure up to this. Pour's thick, black, viscious with a rich mocha head. It's obviously coated the sides of the glass and informs that the is not for the meek or mild mannered. The noses is all dark fruits and alcohol; raison's first, blending into cinnamon and vanilla, the alcohol is faint but warning, burnt toast around the edges. The flavor picks up all the best of heavy dark roast, creamy bready malts; blackened barely (x3), bitter wheat, bouyant cinnamon. The double headed griffen is a rightous crest as this is thick, powerful and unforgetable."

"Overall - There is a reason, at the time of this writing, this beer is #25 on the Beers of Fame list. It is excellently crafted by the personnel at Founders, just another notch on the belt of what could potentially be the best overall brewery in all of North America. Highly recommended and approved by the Condor. Very glad I saved my 200th review for such a great beer."
""

"Overall, it's amazing. It's definitely in my top 5 RIS's I've had. It does seem somewhat hard to get a hold of. In my opinion, ten fidy is better."
"D - Amazingly drinkable at 10.5%. A damn good stout, but doesn't quite measure up to Founder's others. That being said, I'd definitely have it again."
""
"O - Honestly, this is an ass-kicker of a stout. Definitely one of the best of this style while remaining a drinkable, enjoyable beer. One to keep on hand when you're in the mood to sip and enjoy."

""

"O- Wow this is an excellent flavorful imperial stout, one of the best I've had."

"Overall, this is a big, smooth, beautiful RIS with good balance and an impeccable finish. It manages to be luxurious and easy to drink in spite of its bold flavor and high ABV. While not particularly exotic or unique, it excels in its exemplary execution of the fundamentals. It's a textbook example of the style, and easily on par with the best that Founders has to offer."

"O - overall would have to be the most enjoyable RIS experience I have had as of yet. To me this embodies the style and would be my benchmark for future examples of the style. This is just so smooth and well crafted, does not have a weak spot. Only smell got knocked from 5 for a slight sharpness due to the alcohol aroma and mouthfeel as well due to it being a little overly thick. I think with some age these attributes would each score a 5 for me if it becomes a tad less hot and the body thins slightly."

"Re - Review - almost two years later. I tried this in the tap house and didn't like it, tried it a year a later and enjoyed (but didn't love) it. Now I'm drinking this one with about a year and 2 months age on it and it is a work of art. The anise has mellowed, the chocolate, and layers of cocoa, coffee, vanilla, come out in full force. The layers of flavor and depth to this is amazing. I'm going to continue to buy these in waves and throw them in the cellar. Simply amazing brew."

"O- Great beer, just so full of flavor! Founders really does a great job with beer esp their big beers"

"I am admittedly a sucker for Founders, but for me it does not get any better than this. The standard against which I rate all other imperial stouts. The full range of flavors, perfectly balanced. Will be buying by the case in future years."

"O: impressive. interesting sweetness and big, bold taste. i am absolutely amazed how the 10.5% is hidden behind such a drinkable brew."
"O- Delicious, fantastic, but quite the palate destroyer. If I had to choose just one for life, Breakfast Stout probably edges this one out because of the smoothness and drinkability. But this is great. I'm looking forward to seeing how it takes to some aging, and I'd love to try a BA version."

"Snowy night in the Northeast. You can see by my updated reviews that after snow blowing, I went into my stouts. This type around, the Founder Imperial poured much darker and thicker than I remember the first time. Plus the head was a dirty cooper by wonderful head. Five minutes into my glass and there is still some signs of the head. Putting my nose into the tall glass to me is just about the same as putting your nose into a coffee grinder, but a beautiful coffee!. Loving it. The higher alcohol or perhaps the higher IBUs in this one made it quicker to drink. The coffee overtones stayed right with me until the end. Even 10"" away from my glass, all I call smell and think right now is COFFEE, COFFEE, COFFEE... Now that is being said with a New York accent from a person who now lives in Connecticut"

"This pours a pitch black color with a large, foamy brown head. There are lots of robust coffee, roasted malts, and hops in the aroma. It delivers quite an amazing smooth, complex, and robust flavor. Roasted malts, coffee, toffee, licorice, and hops are all here! It drinks silky smooth with a chewy, chalky after taste. Grade A delicious in a bottle!"

"O: It was fairly pricey, $3 for one bottle, I guess they were sold out of 4 packs but it was well, well worth it. It was my reward for waiting so patiently, I was thoroughly impressed and delighted by this beer and any would should take the opportunity to try it if they come across the chance."
"O-A great beer overall. I enjoyed it much better on draft than I did in bottle however. The appearance did not resemble the first time I had it on draft and the tobacco burnt taste is more heavy on my bottled beer tasting. This is still a great beer overall but if I had reviewed it when I had it on draft this would have gotten a much higher score. Goes to show you that everything in the brewing process down to the packaging of the beer can take away from such a stellar beer."

"D and O: Founders Imperial Stout fresh, Expedition Stout with a year on it. That's how I feel. This beer is the definition of the style, IMO. It's absolutely fantastic, and does not disappoint on any front."
""
""
"This is as close to the be-all-end-all of its style as it gets. Ticks off every box in but does so with finesse. Pours an utterly impenetrable inky black, the pours barely rising above a whisper as it motor oil-like stream penetrates its small, creamy wisp of dark brown foam. Aromas are immediately reminiscent of the times that I've entered the doors of an artisanal chocolatier. If that chocolatier had coffee breath and was charring marshmallows over a fire, this is what his shop would smell like. The taste is as rich as it gets, with lots of very dark chocolate on the front palate, followed by mocha then espresso on the mid palate as the sweetness dims, and finishes with a taste of burnt chocolate and day-old coffee grounds that lingers long. Super high viscosity meets uber-silky feel. An amazing sipping experience."

"o- seems a bit harsh, to be honest, maybe will smooth out with some age on it"

"Pours motor oil black with a one finger light brown head. Aroma of coffee and chocolate. Flavor is rich chocolate and dark roasted coffee. Thick, creamy mouthfeel with light carbonation. 10.5% ABV very well hidden. Extremely long and bitter finish. Complex stout. Perfectly balanced."
""
"Notes: Finally rated this one, bringing my total from the ""Beers of Fame"" list to 87 out of 100 I do believe. I have come to really like that list as there are some of my all time favorites on it. Additionally, I found 87 of them to be quite accessible seeing as how I don't really trade with other BA's."

"Bitter coffee and chocolate dominate the mouth leave a smooth coating. Then some plumb and rum/raisin notes come forward kept in check by bitter herb notes. A rich, complex , tasty stout."
"O: Founders didn't reinvent the wheel, they just showed every other brewer how it should be made in the first place. A brilliant reminder why this is my favorite style out there, and a not-so-brilliant reminder that this was the only bottle I had. :("

"From notes, 10/31/10. Very good imperial stout. Lots of chocolate, roast and coffee, particularly in the taste. The aroma is a bit weaker - heavier on the roast with some dark fruit flavor and a bit of unfortunate rubbing alcohol. Great creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is present but mostly warming and pleasant (just a bit of harshness). Appearance is pretty much black wall to wall with a small brown head. Oddly, I’ve now rated both the Imperial Stout and Breakfast Stout higher than KBS - weird science and rather unexpected."
""
""

"O: Flavor profile just isnt for me, I like my big stouts a bit sweeter, no off notes, and very complex flavors so i cant hate. seems like a polarizing stout."

"Its a great brew but I guess I had higher hopes on this. Still worthy of praise..."
"It's too dry to be a dessert beer; it's too rich to be a regular brew. But it is a special beer, worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: I like this beer a lot, and I would definitely have it again, but it doesn't quite have the rich complexity which I love in a Russian imperial stout. A very good beer indeed, but perhaps not up to its very high potential."

""
""
"Tastes and smells of sweet, fruity malts. The aroma and flavor melt together in the glass in a symphony of richness. However, it's not the flavor or aroma that bring me back to this beer. Much like their porter, this brew has superior mouthfeel. A must try for any true stout fan (if you are lucky enough to be able to get it!)."

"12oz bottle with Bottled 12/20/12. Pours a viscous black color with a 1/4 inch of brown head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is of chocolate, black licorice, earth and roasted malts. The taste is smokey chocolate and earth upfront followed by bittersweet dark chocolate. Warming alcohol presence. Chocolatey, malty, and earthy with a nice amount of smoke. Heavy mouthfeel. This beer reminds me of Ten Fidy. Overall, a boozey rich Stout with a lot of flavor that is worth seeking out."

"O - an imposing. Unrelenting and astonishingly tasty imperial stout. One of the best available anywhere."

"This is a really complex, intricate, and delicious beer. Each sip showcases its depth. You can taste each flavor distinctly in each sip, but they also come together in a great balanced flavor. This is definitely one of the more complete Imperial Stouts on the market. This is most certainly worth a try."

"Overall (4.25): I’ll be the first to admit that it’s a bit challenging at times, especially with the smoke and char that sit underneath all that rich, chocolatey body, but goddamn this beer is rich and full and smooth. The depth of its flavor lies in the smoke and char that the malt body attempts to balance out with some moderately sweet, chocolatey richness. While it does smooth out a bit as it warms, it remains a big, challenging bastard for the duration of the experience. Pretty much typifies the style, if you ask me, and hits it out of the park."
""
"O- This is a big stout with a huge hop presence. I can see it doing really well with age. A big stout with a lot to say. 12oz is plenty for me!"

"O - Drinkable. I like it. An imperial stout I would want to have around all the time."

"Overall-this beer caught me off guard, then knocked me on my ass. Easy to drink, not terribly expensive, only problem is its available 2 months of the year. But I'm sure if you can stockpile it would improve with some time on it. This is the easiest to drink RIS that I've had. 4.75"

"Black pour with mocha head smells of choc and coffee with a little dirt and wet dog. Light carbonation that keeps it from being syrupy. Explosion of chocolate. Thick palate. Yum. Rerate with a 1-year old vintage (same score): Pours deep thick black with small dark brown head. Aroma is heavy sweet chocolate milk. Thick and creamy mouthfeel that really still finishes with a strong bitter cocoa. Low to medium carbonation. An excellent balance of bitter and sweet. Love you Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A world class RIS. The best it can get without aging."
""
"The beer pours like motor oil, thick and pitch-black with a very little dark tan head/ring, bordering on mocha coloring. The beers body is blacker than night allowing no light to pass through it, and only allowing one to gaze into it and ponder what horrifying eldritch terrors must lie in wait within the glass. The beer’s lacing is long and curtain-like, though medium in thickness upon the glass. On the nose, the beer smells big and powerful, shoving sweet roasted malts into your face alongside bitter black coffee, a touch of dark chocolate, and oh-so-slight black licorice and sweet alcohol. On the tongue, the beer tastes big, roasted, chary, and bitter. The beer begins with intense sweet roast before opening into huge bitter black coffee flavors with only a faint touch of black chocolate and char. The finish is big with black coffee and alcohol and big char which lasts in the mouth like you bit into an ashy coal. On the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy, oozing across the tongue like smooth velvet while its flavors brutally assault the palate. The mouth is left dry and charred, though a little saliva scrims the tongue. Overall, this beer is intense. Big and intense. It has some wonderful flavors, but they are all a little too amped up for my palate. I think this beer will do beautifully with a little bit of cellaring, but for now it just is too much to enjoyably drink. It’s a good experience, but it needs to tone itself back."
""
""
""
"O: for me the alcohol was a little bit too overpowering on this one, and with 10.5% ABV it not to surprising it has a strong alcohol presents. It's just I have had imperial stouts that were way better balanced than this one. But aside from that it wasn't a bad beer. Leaves a fantastic lacing on the glass. Defiantly a sipper."
""
""
""
"O - one of the best imperial stouts ever made. Maybe even the best. It's been a favorite of mine on cold winter nights for a few years now and is in my top 3-4 of the RIS style. Founders Imperial Stout is a massively thick monster of a stout. Black as hell, rich, and as thick as anything you'll ever come across. It holds it's own in the founders stout family and is truly a beer worthy of anyone's glass. This black liquid, scratch that.. It's thicker than liquid, more oil based.. Anyway, this ridiculously thick black fluid is down right scary good from its rich black color to its overwhelmingly delicious taste is one of the best imperial stouts any person could ever get their hands on and will be brought into my home years and years to come. Another big stout treat from one of my favorites. Founders.. Enough said."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good example of the style, highly recommended."
"O: Not the most complex RIS, but damn good. Surprisingly easy to drink for a 10.5% imperial stout, and the price is also very good ($11.29/4-pack). Definitely wish this was available for more than 2 months (if it even lasts that long on shelves, which it almost definitely won't). Founders just doesn't disappoint"
""
"Being available in 4-packs, and at a very reasonable price to boot (only $12 for me), this is an outstanding imperial that's also a great value. For now, Founders Imperial Stout has jumped to the top of my non-barrel-aged stout list."

"overall not my favorite RIS, but good."

"Overall: There's not much I can say except Founders is just straight class. Definitely my go to brewery and nothing they have done has disappointed, this included. This is a very good beer and I will be drinking this again."

"O: One of my all time favorite beers. Imperial Stouts rarely get better than this."
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up from a great trade with RepMichigan! Bottled 12/22/11. An aggressive pour yielded a beautiful , albeit small, caramel colored head that sat atop an absolutely pitch black body. The tiny head quickly faded and there was very little lacing. Huge roasty, cocoa nose with hints of black coffee, mocha, and dark chocolate. The taste is nothing short of heaven. Complex and extremely rich. Huge dark chocolate and cocoa up front with hints of burnt espresso, licorice, booze, and some subtle raisin, fig, and soy sauce on the finish. The mouthfeel is like velvet. Thick, creamy, and smooth as silk with just a touch of oiliness. Scary drinkability for such a big beer. Yes, it's a sipper, but I could probably sip several of these in a sitting. Overall this is probably my favorite non-barrel aged Imperial Stout. Founders can do no wrong!"
""
""
""
""
"would love to see this baby aged in some bourbon barrels!"
""
"Overall: Absolutely superb beer. Easily among my very very top beers. Out of nearly 100 beers tried, this is definitely somewhere within my top 10, likely top 5 for being so perfect in every respect. DEFINITELY worth every penny and I hope to get more sometime!"
"Overall (4): I can't believe how hot this is at 10.5% even with significant time in the bottle. This would do much better without all those IBUs in my opinion but it's not bad by any means. I remember liking this more in the past."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: A very in-your-face RIS. I'm aging my other bottle to see how it develops in a year or so. Would I drink it again? Yes, I have a hard time turning down an RIS."
""
""
""
"Pours thick pitch black color with a small dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, char, smoke, toast, cocoa, light dark fruit, and earthy hops; a bit of alcohol as it warms up. Nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of huge espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, smoke, toast, cocoa, and earthy hops. Good amount of roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, smoke, toast, and cocoa on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of roasted flavors; with a great hop/roast balance; and some slight cloying bitterness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Russian imperial stout as expected. Great balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted flavors; and very smooth to slowly sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"The taste was sublime, smooth hints of burnt malt, smoke, and coffee, it lended its way to a chocolate-like finish. Oh, so tasty and yet so smooth this is the consummate Imperial Stout. At 10 percent ABV there was no brashness and I could have drank ten if I had as many."

"O- this was very solid, it's a little hoppy, very smooth, very thick but very well balanced and smooth. Some RIS just pound you with bitter malt but this is delicious."
"Overall this is a well balanced big stout, and it is hard to imagine it improving a lot with aging, but I bought one to put away for a while to see how it changes,"
""
"Overall this beer is amazing I'll definately be looking out for it again."
"O - I've been wanting to review this one for awhile now. I let it age for almost a year and the alcohol is still on the taste. Not a bad beer; however, there are many good Imperial Stouts out there that outshine this one. Cheers!"
"D- excellent drinkability"
"I really wish this was a year round brew from Founders. Love to see a BBA limited release in 750's for optimum cellaring. Not many brewers do RIS as well Founders, this is top notch!"

"O – This beer is absolutely fantastic. It has everything I could ever ask for in a great RIS. It looks perfect, smells great, and tastes and feels nearly perfect if not perfect. From the first sip, I was thinking to myself, “Wow, this is a great beer.” If Founders was a boxer, this would be a complete knockout. Of course, they normally win most bouts by knockout, but I’m talking Ali knocking Liston down in the 1st round and standing over his body taunting him with this one. It’s that good. Nearly flawless beer from Founders."

"Good stuff."

"O: a fantastically balanced, highly drinkable RIS"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: recently had a bottle aged two years (bottled Jan 2011, enjoyed Jan 2013). The alcohol was still bold, still assertive, and still mild enough to enjoy perfectly. The smokey, campfire aspect was a little toned down, but this allowed for the chocolate to really jump out. Mouth feel was still silky smooth, and though the carbonation had lost some of its bang, it was still enough to produce that gorgeous, dark tan head. I think I prefer this one fresh, but it's amazing either way."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - the heat on this is noticeable but the bitter coffee flavors and delicious roasted malt and chocolate notes keep it relative. This is a delicious RIS with a lot of bitter coffee flavor and a great balance of sweetness and malty goodness."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a delightful IS, I would love to try one side to side with the Founders Breakfast Stout for a side by side comparison - my preference might lean toward the Breakfast Stout but this is an outstanding beer from the master of stouts."
""
"O - still at 55 degrees. Amazing complex yet balanced flavors, not overwhelmingly strong yet very robust, smooth and enjoyable to drink, really nice"
""
"There are definitely better imperial stouts out there, but the fact that this is Founders automatically gives it an advantage to some. Give me 5 years, and I'll report back with the 2nd of 4 bottles."
"O: I continue to be impressed with Founders, and this one is right at the top with a couple other seasonals they do. Throughout the drink I kept thinking ""this is really good, but also really thick"". Then all of a sudden it was gone and I realized it was going down much easier than I thought it was. The balance of the hops, and sweet roastiness is incredible. Can't wait to do a taste of one of these vintage '12 bottles next January with a year of age vs a fresh bottle of Vintage '13."
""
""
"O - It is not BS or KBS. It doesn't have the complexity as either one which is expected. I believe and hope this gets better with age. I would give much higher rating, but for the first time, disappointed by the alcohol...way too much. Still good, but not what I was expecting. Not up to Founder's usual quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm giving it a 4.5 in spite of the lower individual scores because this beer really isn't a sum of its parts. It's a great drink overall, even if you can nitpick its components."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a phenomenal example of the style, and exactly what I have come to expect from Founders. The strong malt characteristics and heavy consistency mask the 10.5% ABV extremely well, while simultaneously making it a slow sipper in order to appreciate its complexity."
"O: good sipping beer"
""
""
""
"O: I think it's exceptional. If you're a fan of this type of beer, definitely age one a year to try it."
""
"Overall: Buy this beer, trade for it, do whatever you can to secure a few of these. I love this beer, high abv is deterred from showing due to the nice hop/malt balance."
""
"Overall a great imperial stout, best I've had this season so far...but my fridge is still full with more to try."
"O: no question the most complex beer I've tasted so far (only my 2nd RIS). This was bottled less than a month ago...can't wait to try the rest of these with some age on them."
""
""
""
""
""
"More props to Founders... this is another great stout among many I've had by them."
"Overall: This is an incredible Russian Imperial Stout. Definitely already one of my favorite non barrell aged imperial stouts. As a matter of fact this could contend with the best of them if this was barrell aged. Nonetheless this is a great representation of the style and I'll definitely be picking up more of this."

"O: A world-class Imperial Stout with no real flaws IMHO."

"Excellent stout. One of the best in a 12 oz. bottle. Just falls a little under many of the highly rated russian imperial stouts in the 22 oz format. For the price , and otherwise, simply excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is probably one of the best non-BA imperial stouts I've ever had. I hear this is a fairly cheap offering, so if you can get your hands on a four-pack of this, or hell, even a case, there's no good reason not to buy this stuff. It's complex and maybe a little weird for people who don't like mineral saltiness in their beer, but for me it was a marriage made in heaven. Extreme in its subtleties. So weird. So good."

"Poured into a Founders snifter. Beautiful dark/mocha head, about a finger deep, some retention/lacing. Head recedes relatively quickly, leaving a very thin ring inside the glass. Completely black in color, looks like an absolutely delicious Imperial Stout. Roasty, malty aromas blend really nicely with coffee and chocolate notes. There is a small hint of heat, too, which at 10.5% is not all that surprising. Hints of molasses as well. Taste is really similar, and improves as beer warms in the glass. Alcohol ""taste"" is less present here, with roasted malt and coffee coming through most, with black strap molasses. Mouthfeel is great: super smooth and drinkable, slight carbonation and bitterness on the end. Overall this is an amazing beer, not sure whether it's better fresh or what, but this one is about a year old and is drinking really really well right now. It's my last one, so hopefully I can replenish with a case when it's brewed again (hoping January?). Founders Imperial Stout is really balanced. It's a must-try. Cheers."

"O: Wonderful RIS, especially considering the price ($2.50/bottle). After 2 years in the cellar, this beer holds up tremendously, with the age really mellowing out the alcohol and allowing the rich malts to further settle in."

"O: this is a really good stout, it's well balanced with delicious flavors that mix together but do not overpower each other. It's so smooth and clearly get better with age. Well done founders keep doing what you do"

"Founders is one of my favorite breweries, and their stout follows their porter in many ways. Just a superior brew, covering all of the ""should haves"" of this style completely. Top-notch all the way."
""
"What this beer lacks in refinement it gains in just pure great flavor. Like a good french roast coffee, or espresso it is loaded with huge flavor that does not overwhelm."

"O: Wow, this beer blew me away. Very reminiscent of the breakfast stout, except on steroids. Again, great fare from founders. Have not been disappointing by even one of their beers. Keep it coming."
"The way this thing pours reminds me of old diesel motor oil. Its thick, black, and heavy, but leaves behind a pillow of reddish, dark-brown foam. Really nice looking. Smell is nothing too spectacular, you have your roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, and a hint of coffee. Taste is heavy on the roast, with notes of bitter chocolate, fig, hops on the back end, and a smoky tobacco hint to finish. For me, the mouth feel is what brings this thing together. It has the most luscious body I've ever had in a beer, so thick and silky. It's basically perfect for the style. Another winner for Founder's."
""
""

"O- Really, really, really good stuff. Back the bitterness down a touch, and I'd have a potentially faultless RIS."

"O: Wow, what a great RIS. Roasted malt character is thick, heavy, pervasive and oh so nice. Super thick but not cloying or syrupy. Creamy beyond belief. Amazingly drinkable, especially for a 10.5% brew. This is one of the best I've ever had, period."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D-this is an extremely solid beer, great taste, very smooth and drinkable."
""
""
""
""

"This is one strong-ass beer. It pours an opaque ebony with a one finger caramel-colored head and minimal lacing. The smell is sweet and malty but not just in your face like you might think with a beer this strong. Mouthfeel is robust and almost syrupy. The taste is complex as well; a sweet malty caramel taste giving way to a dark chocolate, coffee , hops (and some alcohol)taste for the finish. Overall I will have to say it was not my favorite beer ever, but I have tried to evaluate in terms of quality and what this beer should be according to type. Since I have never had anything bad from Founders, I declare this one another winner."
""
""
""
""
"O: Another solid offering from Founders. I have another bottle in my cellar - I will revisit this one in about 2 years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty darn perfect RIS"

"O: Wow, Founders knows stouts. IMO, this is KBS minus the bourbon goodness. Excellent Imperial Stout."
""

"This beer pours out black, with next to no head. The aroma is full and roasty, with loads of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and a bit of tops. The taste is over-the-top roasty at first, with some dark fruits. There's also a decently large dose of earthy hops at the end. The late finish yields a great coffee flavor. The mouthfeel is slick, with a slightly lighter body than expected. Overall, this is a great imperial stout. It really doesn't do anything out of the ordinary - so it makes a great benchmark stout."
"Overall this is a super complex beer that I believe this vintage I possess is slightly passed it's prime. Too much sweetness and deteriorated dark malt soy sauces flavors. Not sure how this is fresh but this is a testament to not waiting too long."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very nice imperial stout. Rich in flavor, this is a beer to savor. The alcohol is especially well masked. Another great brew from Founders."
""
""
"O: This is definitely a beer to take your time with. It really opens up as it warms and the flavor is so balanced between sweet and roasted. It's not nearly as bitter as I thought it would be. This is one of my new favorite stouts."
""
""
""
"O- A nice sipper, the 10.5% ABV is well hidden and I would not have put it at being that high. A solid RIS, not an overly complex one, but on the mark for what is should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Another great beer from Founders that is a great representation of the style. Definitely of the best, easily available RISs around"

"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark black small with a small dark tan head that has decent retention and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasty, with dark chocolate, earthy hops, coffee, as well as a light plastic note that is a bit strange. The taste has light sweetness and is quite roasty with dark chocolate and coffee. The finish has light bitterness and leaves a lingering roastiness. Medium-full body. Low carbonation. Pretty solid for a regularly available imperial stout. Not terribly complex, but quite enjoyable."

"O: One of the smoothest stouts I've tried. Even better towards room temperature. Perfect with Monterey Jack cheese. Very nice with spicy chicken tenders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one big, delicious brew. Perhaps eclipsed by the overwhelming success of KBS and CBS, this brew should not be scoffed at, deemed inferior, or passed over. This is a great example of an RIS that can hold its own without any barrel treatment."
""
"O: exactly what you should be looking for in a Russian Imperial stout"
""
"Overall- A sweet, decently priced Imperial Stout with some slight balance issues? We can't all be perfect and this beer really shines everywhere else. I'm definitely more partial to the BS, and especially the KBS but this is an easy to obtain winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: one of my favorite RISs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I loved it, and maybe as much as the more acclaimed breakfast stouts. This is as good as a Russian Imp Stout can get."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is one hell of a representation of the style, incredibly complex and deep, truly delicious and of the highest quality as i have come to expect from founders. another flawlessly done brew"
""
"O: I'd argue that this beer is currently at it's peak. When it was forst released, I thought it fell a little thin, but this is absolutely gorgeous."
""
""
""
"O -- delicious. can't tell as of now whether i like this or the breakfast stout more; will have to compare at some point, not now. i highly recommend this beer"
"Overall, this is a great stout. Does Founders make a stout that isn't far above average?"
"O: Another very solid offering from Founders. Always love trying their beers!"
"O: I would for sure get more of this elixer and was solid all around. founders kills on them stout brews."
"This one seems like it will age well, so I put a few in the cellar. Bet that bitterness goes away and this becomes one of the best aged RIS out there."
""
""
"-i am completely fine with drinking this beer. it's 10.5 yet doesnt blast your mouth out. i wish this was more accessible to me"
""
""
"I'm taking my time with this one because I want to enjoy all the flavors, not because the 10.5% abv is obvious. This is simply really really good. If the coffee flavor was dialed back just a bit, it might be perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic RIS. The hop loading is reminiscent of Storm King, but the overall drinking experience is even better."
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer as a change from other stouts, probably because of the bigger hop character. I also enjoyed the lack of sweetness as a change of pace. I have 3 more in the cellar and am interested to see what some age does to this one."
""
""
""
"O: One of the best Imperial Stouts I have had. You probably assume this drinks like non-barreled KBS, but this is a unique beer in its own right. Rich, decadent fudge notes blend perfectly with vanilla and bready malt to create a truly special impy stout. Another proven winner from one of the best breweries in the country."
"Thick and a little sticky on the lips, but lightened by adequate carbonation. Slightly warming at the finish."
"Another winner by Founders. I really like the strong flavors this one brings to the table, especially the way the bitterness from the hops and roasted malt come together towards the end. It also has an excellent feel to it with a good amount of carbonation. Would definitely reach for this again if I had the chance. Thanks again Dave!"
""
"Another great brew from Founders. They have the ability to create some of the best stouts I have ever tasted. They are full of body and flavor that can compete with any great stout brewer. This like many Founders beers pack a punch and for my taste is a little too hoppy. I am someone who enjoys a slightly less hoppy flavor, which is why a give it a 4.5 for taste and mouthfeel. But, still overall it is a great beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is a real winner with an incredibly creamy and smooth full-bodied texture. Overall, Founders knows how to make great beer, no doubt about that and Imperial Stout is only further proof of that."

"Would highly recommend!"
"O: Outstanding in every aspect!"
"Thanks to Illudium to for the sample!"
""
""
"O - I had big expectations for this beer because of how impressive Founders' other imperial stouts are. This one distinguished itself from its ""breakfast brothers"" with the toasty, almost smokey, character indicative of a full flavored RIS. I was impressed with the complexity and the balance that the high IBU offered. I will put a few away to see what happens with this beer with age, as I believe it will be a whole different animal. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O - Overall this is a treat from perhaps the best brewery in the nation. Smooth and inviting, with a balanced and delicious flavor profile. One year on the bottle and it is perfectly smooth with barely noticeable alcohol flavor. I'd put this up against Kate the Great any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"What a great beer. If not for the numerous super fantastic offerings in this style this would be the best. Delicious, and highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Buy a four pack today."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great stout. I've got another in the fridge that I'm pretty sure I'm going to cellar. This is a great beer with all the elements I look for in a stout, with a little extra hop attitude. Very excited to try again in a few months."
""
""
""
""
"I've previously had Founders breakfast stout and although a great stout, I was not a huge fan of the overwhelming chocolate and coffee in FBS. For a stout purist like me, this RIS is far superior and is worth a try if you can get your hands on some. It's very tempting to order a second one, but at 10.5% you have to be cautious."
""
""
"Another home run from the crew at Founders! A shining example of how to nail the RIS style on a macro scale."
""
"Overall wow. Just a great imperial stout, up there w/ some of my other favorite non-barrel-aged versions - Expedition and Yeti come to mind."
""
""
""
"This is a damn good Imperial stout. Get some."
""
"O - So glad I finally came across this beer. I've had FBS, KBS and CBS and this ""run-of-the-mill"" RIS hangs there with the best of them. Outstanding beer from Founders once again. If Rasputin and TenFidy popped out a love child, this beer is it."
""
""
""
"A good RIS, if you like them smoky. I love beers with a great smoke complement to them, but I think it could be dialed back a bit to get the roasty and chocolate profiles more to the fore. Still a great beer and would recommend everyone who likes imperial stouts to give this one a go."
""
""
""
"M. Thick creamy and delicious. Silky smooth."

"This black-brown beauty pours nearly like motor oil into the pint glass at room temperature. The head is chocolate brown and stands very strudy for a minute or so before fading to patchy cover. A few drops of beer actually danced on top of the head until finding a place to sink through. The nose picks up a slightly boozy chocolate licorice with near cotton candy sweetness and slight nuttiness.Very intriguing. The first taste brings a vscous feeling, near minty licorice-chocolate blend of intense flavor. It's satiny smooth with just a freckling of carbonation, but velvetty, luscious stuff. Goes down easy but probably not a session brew for obvious reasons. It's pretty thick stuff, clearly full bodied. Seems like there's some herbal hop going on to really make this an interesting blend of earthy, malty pleasure. This seems pretty much what you should expect in an imperial stout. Finishes a little more boozy than I'd like but otherwise, another Founders success!"
""
""
"This is a beautiful beer from an outstanding brewer. So far, it is easily the best RIS I've had. Somehow, this beer from Founders flies a bit under the radar. It's hard to believe that this December/January release isn't as sought after as some other RISs (There was some still on the shelf in MARCH for crying out loud!). It deserves to be on every beer-lovers ``had'' list. I've stored some in my basement and I'm going to crack one open every few months. I look forward to seeing how it develops. Thank you Founders!"
""
""
""
""
""

"O. Very good RIS. Super smooth. Incredibly easy to drink. Might be a strong contender for the basis of the style."
""
""
""
""
"One the smoothest RIS's I've ever had. Very tasty and easy to drink. A top notch representation of the style."
""
""
"All in all, this is a frequent buy in home and considered at the top of the hierarchy of beers."
""
""
"As I have said elsewhere - one of the best renditions of an RIS out there."
""
"overall: top notch. flaws. but minimal flaws."
""
""
"Overall it's a pretty good imperial stout. Not the biggest fan of how dry it is but the rest of the characteristics are solid, but not amazing. "
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is definitely one of the best imperial stouts I've ever had. Everything works so well in this beer, that is hard to imagine it getting much better. Thoroughly enjoyed this."
""
""
"Really good Imp Stout. Balanced, complex, smooth and moderately complex. Unpretentious, but solid and reliable. Well done."
""
"Completely blown away and surprised by this beer. It drinks so easily and the taste is incredibly balanced. There's tons of flavor going on here without barrel aging or adding any additional flavoring. Probably the best straight-up Imperial Stout I've had to date."
""
"Top notch."
""
""
"Overall; this is yet another incredible beer in the Founders portfolio... Absolutely fantastic and worth seeking out"
""
""
"Overall: A truly excellent RIS, and amazing for the price, not truly perfect because I would like to see a bit more sweetness and a bit less smoke in the taste."
"Would be happy to receive this one again!"
""
""
""
""
"O - A fantastic brew from Founders. To be concise, get this beer if you ever have the chance."
""
""
"O- Am amazing stout. Very heavy and rich but definitely a stout lovers dream. Something I'm glad I bought in bulk."
"First time I've had this beer. I have yet to drink a founders I dislike at all. Super solid stout. Refreshing to have a such a solid stout when it seems like everyone believes that anything not barrel aged isn't worth the time."
""
"Cheers!"
"The taste and mouthfeel go hand in hand here to a spectacular finish. Right up there with Founders Breakfast Stout for me. I LOVE this beer!"
""
""
""
"Very nice imperial stout from Founders, I was slightly disappointed by FBS (still a good beer), but this is outstanding. Have to find a CBS now to try."
""
"I enjoy a good imperial stout, and this one was better than most. It's an extremely black brew with a thin chocolate head. It's thick and viscus. The smell is truly intense. Dark fruit, berries, charcoal, coffee, dark chocolate, and alcohol all mingle in the nose. The taste is equally intense...sweetness in the front, with plums, cherries, and dates...followed by an intense bitterness similar to bakers chocolate on steroids. Then, the warming sets in...huge ethanol warmth kicks things up a notch. The finish is lingering, bitter, and rich. Dark malt is abundant in the flavor as well...this is a very complex brew. The mouthfeel is engulfing...deep, thick, and dense. Overall, this one is spectacular."
"And yet another delicious Founders stout. I love the differences between this and FBS - which are now at the tops of my list of Stouts. Well done!"
""
"Overall this is a very good RIS. Definitely worth seeking out, especially if you are looking for a RIS to challenge the other forerunners of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's within style, but this is a bit too dominated by burnt coffee flavors for me."
"Pours a lovely thick black with a rust colored head that fades yet coats the tip of my tulip glass. Roasty malts, chocolate, molasses, maybe some vanilla and alcohol hit the nose. Tastes as rich as it smells, gives some warmth without being boozy. Mouthfeel is so wonderful its like breastfeeding. Wish it was more available like I do all Founders stouts."
""
""
"Definitely a tasty RIS, Founders seems to have a knack for this type of beer."
"Poured into a tulip glass like dirty motor oil. Dark black/brown and totally opaque. Thick brown foam that hangs arou d a while slowly melting to a film. The smell is mild, roasted malt and coffee. The taste is dark roasty malt and pretty intense dark chocolate. As it warms you get some nice caramel and a little vanilla. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy with light carbonation. Overall a great stout. Dark roasted malt and chocolate all the way."
""
"overall this is a definite winner. my first founders stout and i will be looking forward to more in the future. delicious!"
"O-an excellent RIS with great body and balance"
"love breakfast stout, but it seems like I've enjoyed drinking this more so this year than FBS."
"Why haven't I been able to get this beer in my area???? This is clearly 1 of my all time favorite Beers. Poured Black and thick. Foamy awesome dark brown and stuck to the side of the glass. Aroma was of the style, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and even some hops. This was dry, sweet and bitter. As it warms, complex flavors are coming out. Bitter coffee is strong at the front of the tongue. The full body then turns sweet with an ever so slight bitter/dry finish. 90 IBU Imperial Stout, simply delicious."
""
""
"O - Another excellent beer from Founders. I think I enjoyed it more when it was a touch fresher, but this is certainly one that can age with no problem."
""
""
""
""
""
"On a second go (this time a bottled version) I thought my original review was spot on other than I had to bump up the mouth feel. The alcohol was present but it was more complementary this time. A great brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Update (1/13/13): Drinking a relatively fresh bottle (2012). The overall carbonation is better than the previous bottle I reviewed. Smell is similarly lovely to last time, but the taste is more intense. This is not necessarily a good thing: it's ridiculously burnt, with loads of char, tobacco, and leather. Scores adjusted slightly (+.5 appearance, +.5 mouthfeel)."
"O - this is a great beer year and year again. Every year I wish I had bought more and aged it longer… This would be a fantastic barrel aged beer… hint hint nudge nudge (backstage series release)"
"Thanks mrbubbler!!"
"O: a fine example of an imperial stout. I like with this one how powerful the roasted barley is and how thick the mouthfeel is. Founders makes great beers and this is just another example o how strong their portfolio is."
""
""
"Overall- This is one of the better imperial stouts that I have tried. A good sipping beer for a cold night."
""
""
"Overall: My first aged beer on my 22nd birthday and it was very good. Not as good as FBS, still great on it's own if you try not to compare them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another great beer from Founders, and reasonably priced for a 4-pack. I’m planning on sitting a bottle or two down to see how it develops."
""
"Overall outstanding, a great sipping beer for a cold night. If I started early enough, two would be nice!!!!"
""
"O: A really strong punch in the mouth imperial stout that is dead serious in character and appearance. A slow sipper that could be a two and out."
""
""
"Pours near black with a light tan head. Leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass with good legs. The scent is all dark roasted malt and coffee with just a hint of cocoa. The taste follows the scent with a striking bitterness due to a tremendous amount of hops. Not as smooth as Founders Porter or Breakfast stout it is a good Imperial stout."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
"O: This is a fantastic imperial stout, one that deftly balances heavy hopping with gorgeous dark malt flavors. Compared to many other hoppy stouts, this effort from Founders is much more elegant, balanced, and sophisticated. If you're a fan of imperial stouts, this is one not to miss."
"O: I don’t know for a fact but, relying on my tastebuds, I’m going to assume that this is the base for two of my favorite beers...FBS and KBS. While I miss those additional dimensions, this is an top notch stout in its own right. Glad I have another bottle to rest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- wonderful stout I highly enjoyed this one. Not what I was expecting from a big stout like this. Can't wait to try this again."
""
""
"Overall: Incredible. I enjoyed this one over the course of about 40 minutes, aroma and flavors really opened up as it neared room temp. I will be seeking plenty of these out."
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a snifter, the beer is jet black, with a great looking consistency, and a thick, foamy, dense, creamy, milk chocolate colored head. Aromas are rich and deep, with a good blending of chocolate and coffee, as well as some roasted qualities and a slight boozey kick. Flavors are robust and full, with a heavy roasting, almost to the point of char, carrying a solid dark coffee backbone, with some bitter cocoa nib and sweet molasses and vanilla highlights. Very well blended, and extremely smooth despite the bitter coffee and chocolate notes. The aftertaste is more of the smokey/roasted character, with a touch of the bitter chocolate and coffee once again. This full bodied brew leaves a trail of rings around the glass, and is insanely smooth leading to a velvety soft, creamy finish, with a touch of drying bitter left behind for just a moment. Tremendous beer!"
""
""
""
"Pretty good, but I cant get passed that I'm not altogether fond of imperials yet. Too much flavor!"
"Overall – Quite a great beer. It has it all; flavor, aroma, look and feel. One great brew to sit back and savor if you have the chance."
""
""
"O- This is a very good take on a RIS. If the smokiness in the malt was toned down, I would like it better. Nonetheless this keeps the streak alive of never having a Founders beer that sucked."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pleasant sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the most dynamic or complex imperial stout, but still big, bold and tasty. Very bitter."
""
""
""
""
"O: an extreme beer. The sheer strength, relatively high bitterness, too much sourness, plus some hints of smoke and burnt malt make this beer a bit of a challenge. Not an attractive substitute for Breakfast Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is honestly the first stout, or any beer I have rated perfectly. Simply incredible. I can't imagine how this would taste on tap. Thanks Zack!"
""
"O: This is always one of my favorites and i pick it up every year. This is fresh, i'd be curious how this beer ages after losing some bitterness. Love it the way it is but plan to celler some to see how it ages. If you're looking for a well balanced, imperial stout that is big on bitterness, chocolate flavors, and roasted malt, pick this up. You wont be disappointed. Another fabulous brew from Founders."
"to quote ken griffey jr. as he sucked down a bottle of nerve tonic in the classic episode 'homer at the bat'... ""it's like there's a party in mouth and everyone's invited"""
"O: A really good imperial stout from Founders! It definitely compares favorably to Ten Fidy and GLBC Blackout, two of my favorites!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Founders Imperial Stout is a great RIS, no doubt about it. It's rich, dark and strong. The only thing I would do would be to dial back the bitterness just a tiny bit, but as is, it is still world class."
""
"Overall Impression- A very nice Imperial Stout with a huge dominant Coffee base. Would love to see where this one goes if you aged it! Not as intense and overly powerful like other Imperial Stouts but more subtle and smooth. Enjoyed greatly and recommend those who want a big ABV beer but not all the bitterness and body that follows with this."
""
"This is a great RIS that is perfectly balanced and complex enough to make it worth your time."
"O. A very good beer. Have had it many times, but this is the first time reviewing. Thick and delicious, with lots of bold flavors. Well worth searching out and try."
""
""
""
"There is no question that this is a good tasting beer, but its roast outweighs its breadth. I miss the vanilla that others speak of. This beer has a roast and hop character that is quite deep. Full bodied, a true stout."
""
"Overall: I was excited to try this Stout out. I enjoyed every last sip and I am happy I picked up a few packs because when I went back a day later it was all gone. And for $11 a four pack, I wish it was common, so I could constantly keep some in my fridge. Great Job again Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This Imperial Stout has an incredible, dark appearance and nice thick body. The aroma is very deep and the flavor is heavy on the roast and booze. I think after a few months of aging, this is one of the better stouts available."
"The enjoined this over a 30+min and it continued to open and develop all characteristics more deeply."
"Overall, this was an amazing stout. Extremely happy I received a 4 pack of this beer. I'm definitely going to save the others for whenever we get some more cold weather. Founders just knows how to make amazing beer and they hit another homerun with this one."
"Poured a thick, opaque black with a small mocha head; minimal retention and lacing. Aroma is pretty typical of the style: dark malts, roasty coffee, cocoa, some noticeable alcohol. Sweet taste, caramel, dark malts, chocolate, pumpernickel, some bitterness coming in from the coffee, and a slight alcohol burn. Heavy-medium body, not overly extraordinary or unique, but obviously still a fine brew overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent stout if you can get your hands on it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a tulip for complete enjoyment. A mildly agressive pour yields a gorgeous, frothy head. The overall consumption experience is top-notch. My only critique is the bitterness ... would prefer if that was scaled back a bit. A little too much burnt taste too. Other than those minor nits, it's a great beer."
""
""
"O - Man, why didn't I buy more of this when I had the chance? I haven't had too many RIS, but this is got to be my favorite thus far. Everything about this beer is very well done. The array of flavors and incredible mouthfeel make this beer so addicting, which allows the 10.5% ABV to creep up on you fast. I would put this beer at the same level of greatness as Founders Breakfast Stout, and can't wait to enjoy this brew again."
""
"Overall, this one is damn good. On my pallet, it's better than the breakfast stout. Worth seeking this one out."
""
""
"O: Another great brew from the Founders group. This is a must have. I'd rate it higher if it were a bit more mellow. Age'll do it good. Enjoy!"
""
"O: From the first sip, it’s Founders, which puts it into a category all its own. Needless to say, it’s tasty. As good as Breakfast Stout? Close, but no. Still, I’ll take another 4-pack, please."

"note: I also had this in bottles. I saw no change between the two containers; same great beer."
"O: I haven’t had this beer in two years and I’m glad that it still lived up to my expectations. Excellent roasty chocolate, espresso and dark fruits are all over this one. Overly impressive appearance and mouthfeel. Just phenomenal all around! Founders is the king of Stouts."
"O: Impressive again from Founders. Their beers are just so well crafted. This is an A beer for me, and might go higher with a little time."

"The almost syrup like beer is extremely drinkable. What a great brew this is. The ABV of 10.5 is well hidden. Certainly one of my favorite Stouts."
"O: Overall an excellent RIS, one of my favorites. I definitely recommend."
""
"The beer is big and complex but doesnt beat the beauty of breakfast stout. Still a great easy drinking RIS though. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden with only hints of it on the breath."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"Overall, a fantastic beer I enjoy immensely. A lot of imperial stouts seem to shy away from being overly roasty - this one delivers in the roast level. Just another kick ass beer from Founders."
"Overall once again founders doesn't disappoint.  Can't wait till febuary for kbs!!!"
""
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel giant tulip, bottle dated 12/22/11 thanks Founders. Pours pitch black with and amazing 3 inch dark mocha head, beautiful lace that settles into a half inch foam. Smell is dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, bread, and a hint of liquorice. Wow the smell good, but the taste is among the best. Dark chocolate and roasted coffee are the main draw, with a very strong hoppyness. Mouth feel is big, drinkability is high, great amount of life for a large ABV, and not crazy dry. Founders please distribute to N.H. some day. Every thing you do is so consistently good and often GREAT. A treat for RIS fans."
"Overall- Great beer...Not as good as Breakfast Stout, but not much is."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is thick and viscous and the flavor is dead on for what an Imperial Stout should be. It is bitter, roasty, not too sweet. A gem"
""
""
""
"O: Very nice imperial stout, don't think I've had one this bitter before, Founders definitely has their stouts down"
""
"O – This was really nice although I prefer the Breakfast Stout over the Imperial."
""
"O- One of my top 3 favorite readily accesible Imperial Stouts. Founders does stouts as well as anyone IMO. Can't wait till next years batch."
"O: The beer itself can be overwhelming, but it pairs well with cookies."
""
"O- amazing RIS! Similar to breakfast stout but fuller with some smoke/char to it."
""
"O: A little too intense to have multiple of these in an evening... I was slightly disappointed as I had high expectations from the brewery that brought me KBS & CBS. Not as smooth as I would have liked though I could see it pairing well with a dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the real deal. It has a huge rating and for good reason. If this were a limited release in 750s or bombers, it would be an instant whale. This is truly a readily accessible whale. Seek it, drink it, love it!!"
"Overall, a great imperial stout. Good balance of sweetness and roasted malt bitterness. Very complex flavor with the roasted/dark chocolate flavor along wiht the sweetness. Really a great beer."
"O: Great imperial stout. One of my favorites."
"O) Founders clearly knows how to brew world class stouts. I personally prefer the CBS, KBS and FBS over this offering, but it is still highly recommended by this beer enthusiast."
""
"a little hoppy for my likes of the style, but i think a little time could do this wonders. big and dark with lots of roast, ill definatly be on the look out for more of this stuff."
""
"O: A very solid, but not great offering from Founders. Looking forward to seeing how the flavors develop with a little age."
"Overall: Founders always seems to get it right. This is an extremely rich brew in all aspects - the dark brown head, rich chocolate nose, complex body and heavy mouthfeel. I loved this mighty brew. Of course the high ABV would make it tough to have more than two... or three... 4.75"

"O- founders stout line has got to be one of the best in the country. All their stouts are just amazing."
""
""
"O: Overall this is a damn good beer. I’ve been really spoiled in that I’ve had the pleasure of drinking some of the finest Imperial Stouts on the planet over the last couple of months. This certainly doesn’t live up to the best of them (which to date I would claim to be The Abyss and Alesmith Speedway), but it’s a fine beer nonetheless and certainly worth a drink if you can find it."
"Overall: This thing is amazing. On tap, bottle or growler… it is THE perfect example of the quintessential Imperial Stout. Drinks beautiful, tastes great, so well balanced. Hard to find a flaw. I seize any and every chance to drink Founders Imperial Stout. Had it last year on a 32-oz growler from Whole Foods Columbus Avenue, but this time around (January 2011) I liked it even better."
"I know I've used the term jet black before, but this is like...oil black. The blackest I've seen. Submits but an 1/8"" thick mocha tinted foam cap. The smell is really roasty and dry. No coffee, no vanilla, no chocolate. This is a straight up stout with no additives for certain. The hops are present, but mellow. I usually can't detect hops in stouts, but this is a different animal. The taste, for being without any of the aforementioned flavors, is still quite solid. There's a touch of smokiness to this, but this is otherwise a very bold, unapologetic, straight forward stout, and it's excellent at being that. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, albeit dry. It leaves a decent amount of bitterness behind, courtesy of the hops. Overall, this is a very nice beer indeed. I can see why it's so well received."
"Another outstanding offering from Founders."
"On tap at rattle n hum in NYC. Nice silky tan head capping a appealing oily black hue. Nose is full of bitter chocolate, coffee, and light citrus hop. Mouth is complex with the same but addition of light caramel. Smooth and creamy this one hides the alchohol well. Warming and a treat on this snowy day in the city."
""
"if only this was a year-round release..."

""
"In the pantheon of dark Founders' brews, I rate this behind Porter and FBS. But still, a terrific stout. Wish the price point was a little better."
"Most certainly world-class in my opinion. I'm sure it would taste even better with some age but for now, it's very drinkable fresh!"
""
""
"o: another good offering from founders. i didnt like it as much as stone irs, but pretty good. big thanks to duffmanohyeah02 for sending this as an extra!"
""
"Overall a solid imperial stout."
"O - I wish this was available more months out of the year."
"O - An incredible beer, if I had to pick a go-to Imperial stout this would be a strong contender, at $12 a four-pack it's an awesome deal."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: I would have like it to be thicker (it seems about medium and its pretty close to room temp) especially since it looks very thick when being poured."
""
""
""
"O- this beer to me is almost exactly like Breakfast Stout but slightly more balanced. Great beer."
""
""
"Tremendous imperial stout, one of my favorites. Just a big chocolate and coffee beer milkshake."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good RIS. The taste is nice and complex. The mouthfeel is a little bit off for me, but everything else is a prime example of a great RIS."
""
""
"O- This is GOOD, by far my favorite RIS that I have ever had, not much else to say about it!"
""
""
"O - Amazingly full-bodied, dark, well tasting beer. One of the better Imperial Stouts I have had."
"Aight yo. I have no special interest in tracking down uber-rare CBS/KBS'es, so this is the Founders Imperial Stout that I'm going to stick with. Poured into the finest diamond imbued goblet of Silenus. JKJK typical beer stein. Pours black as a black cat on a cloudy night without a moon. Where there's no stars or anything. Really quite black. That's what I'm getting at here. Maybe a hint o f brown? Smells like coffee. I can already tell that I'm in for a treat. Hop bombs are nice, but malt bombs are somethin' else. Speaking of, this label reads '90 IBUs'. I haven't a clue where this number comes from, but certainly not the taste of this beer or its smell. The taste follows the nose - oatmeal, coffee, a little booziness, just enough hops to keep things in check. The mouthfeel makes this beer to me, it washes down like cream. Like it enters your body on a carpet of clouds and leaves behind Care Bears. This shit is dangerous, it weighs in at 10.5% ABV but feels like it should be maybe 7-8%. Bravo, Founders!"
""
""
""
"O - Wow. Had no idea what to expect but this one blew me away. Glad I traded for several bottles and will gladly trade for more."
"D-Very easy drinking, yet complex and interesting beer. The feel here is just extraordinary mouth-coating and full-bodied without being overwhelmingly so."
"O - a fantastic brew. I really wonder how this beer would be after a little cellaring. if your lucky enough to get this beer do yourself a favor and pick up a 4 pack! One of the best non ba stouts I've had for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Founders has the stout style down perfect. I have not had KBS...yet, but I really look forward to it. FBS and FIS are now my 2 favorite, no question. I'm aging one of these fr the future, but I wish FBS aged a little better so I could keep as much as possible year round. This beer makes me want to visit Grand Rapids....now."
"O: Very comparable to their Breakfast Stout, but a little less chocolate and more of a hop presence. I definitely prefer these Founder's stouts that don't have the overwhelming bourbon flavor from barrel aging. Allows the rest of the ingredients to shine. Another neer perfect stout from Founders."
"O: A fantastic RIS as Founders once again proves they can make a mean stout. So many tastes weave in and out. Go ahead and fight for your KBS, just make sure you leave this one on the shelf for me."
""
""
"O - I enjoy this quite a bit and rate it quite highly; a bit below the CBS, about the same as the FBS and KBS. Of all the tastings, I'd say the one I had on 2013-01-16 (bottled Dec 2012) is the best. It's funny how tastes change. The Dec 2012 bottle I had on 2013-10-15 caused me to drop my taste rating by .25 because the char was just a touch too much and I found myself wanting it a little sweeter. Regardless; it's a great beer."
"o 2.5 a beer that i have tried to like now in two forms. still not succeeding. does not seem to come together at all and adds up to less than the sum of its parts."
"O - Probably one of the best non barrel aged stouts I've tried. Really great roasty body with just the right amount of sweetness and hop bitterness to balance it out. The mouth feel is near perfect."
""
""
"Overall, this is an excellent Imperial Stout. I wouldn't hesitate to order this one again."
""
""
"O- a great imperial stout thick and robust but enjoyable to drink"
""
"O – A great, enjoyable beer with lots of flavor that all comes together as one."
"O - Really like this brew, drinking it on a cold snowy day with a bad headcold, tastes great"
"pours pitch black with an almost brown head that shrinks to a thin coat and leaves tons of pretty lace. nose is huge, strong roast (mainly coffee and dark chocolate), a touch of heat and an underlying fruit scent that reminds me of laffy taffy if there was such a thing as a caramel/overripe (almost rotted) dark fruit flavor laffy taffy. maybe some smoke and vanilla in there as well. taste is big, bitter roast malt, cafe con leche, chocolate and citrusy/earthy hops. the hops seem to be fighting for attention a bit, and maybe need a little bit to smooth out. full, creamy body with a bit of a milkshake feel to it, although the bitterness and the heat seem to cut through it a bit. definite bit of alcohol heat in the finish that is mostly hidden throughout the rest of the experience. a lot of competition in this amazing class of beers. this is definitely one big ass beer, and should be enjoyed by any imperial stout fan. not enamored or as impressed as i was lead to believe i would be, but still wuite enjoyed myself. i would love to do a side by side with a year old bottle."
""
""
""
"Overall: One of my favorite imperial stouts. I'll let everyone clamor for KBS and CBS and keep drinking this."
"Seek this out and try some!!"
"What I need to do soon is do a side by side taste test of Founders and Bell's Imperial Stouts because they both seem similar to me in that they improve with age."
"Overall I rate it lower than KBS, CBS, and breakfast stout. I think that without the barrel aging or the added maple or bourbon flavor this beer is just too much dark roasted malt to compete with its big brothers. Keep in mind this is comparing the beer to some of the greatest beers made - no easy task."

"O - An awesome beer that will make you sit back and enjoy the ride."
"O- I feel glad to say that this beer has left a better impression on me than it did in previous years. With so many people claiming that X beer isn't as good as it was last year, I can certainly say that is not the case from this beer. Excellent offering from Founder's, and one that should cellar well too."
""
"Overall, it is a nicely balanced, semi-complex, enjoyable sipper."
"Full body and very creamy, perfectly carbonated. Silky smooth on the tongue, coating it with the beer flavor. Alcohol is completely hidden, with no alcohol burn or heat. I would have liked a slight bit more sweetness to balance out the roasted flavors on this though. Otherwise, a nice beer."
"O: Like Megan Fox. What more can I say. This is a dark beautiful masterpiece."
""
""
""
""
"O: Highly recommended, any more details will just decrease its impact."
"There's nothing specifically standing out and shaking my shoulders, pointing my attention to where it specifically rises above its competition; the Founders Imperial Stout simply stands tall and tasty, a proud member of an elite crew of leading RIS examples the likes of which we should appreciate more. The sheer physicality demands respect and the finesse it's pulled off with is awesome. This is one of the best stouts I've had in a long while."
""
""
"Not to knee-jerk on cellaring, but this guy needs more time to suit my tastes. Into the closet with you and don't come out until July!"
""
"This might be the best RIS I have had, huge flavors, full body, and while the alcohol leaves a slight warming there was no burning sensation. Amazing."
"O: This is just amazing and delicious."
""
""
"На здоровье! Beertracker"
""
"Overall - I am blown away by this RIS, darned near perfect. I can't say enough about this beer, buy it and try it - DO IT! What a wonderful treat, it will be hard to discipline myself into aging a few of these, it's so good now, will be very hard not to drink them. A MUST try for any RIS fans out there."
""
""
""
"Ho-ly shit. This beer simply blew me away. It is hard to say a bad thing about it. Up until now, this is the best imperial stout I have ever tasted. So much complexity already. I can't wait to age the rest and enjoy at a later date. Highly recommended."
"O - This is the epitome of the style. It stands out as an amazing example of a great beer that is great simply because it is perfectly to style. If you ever get the chance to dry this do not pass it up!"
""
"opening this bottle with very high expectations. So damn thick and dark, but that is a recurring theme in every beer I've enjoyed lately so.. whatever. There is as much head as you can get from a 10.5ABV stout, and its a nice dark orange color leaving behind thin lacing. Sniffed out some bitter acidic hops and burnt espresso in front of a faint berry smell. The taste confirms that super dark coffee smell and comes at me even more with bittersweet chocolate. My mouth is dry after every sip. I prefer low levels of carbonation so this is nice for me. Overall this beer met my expectations pretty evenly. I can't wait to share the other three with people who I know will love it. derp."
""
""

"This does not have the heat that I experienced in the CBS I had on tap las week, so that is a good thing. I wonder if they gaed this one in maple bourbon barrels if it would knock CBS snd KBS out of the water."

"O: One of the best beers I have ever had in my life. There isn't a single quality that its lacking on. Just amazing"

"D: full bodied, full flavored, this is exactly what an RIS should be. very tasty and very pleasant and this thing isnt even a month in the bottle. glad i have a few of these."
"D - what a phenomenal stout. I'm not sure if it is this year's batch or my palate has changed since I last reviewed this one. I definitely need to do a horizontal tasting with FBS, KBS, and maybe break out my bottle of CBS to look at the nuances that make each one unique."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer. I felt like I wanted a little more in terms of smell, and the intense coffee bitterness made me think they could have branded it as an Espresso Stout or something along those lines -- perhaps the coffee thing in dark beers is a Founders trademark? I'm glad I bought it, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good stout, but not the time-honored classic that, say, Sam Smith's Imperial is."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best RIS's out there. This beer is so good fresh, but gets better with age. Great balance, complexity, and flavor. Alcohol is noticable, but nowhere close to being overpowering and is cut nicely by the bittered chocolate, which is in turn cut nicely by the light sweetness. Will buy as much as possible given this is a once a year thing."
"O: Founders absolutely nails the classic imperial stout style here. Glad that I have another bottle to cellar and revisit in a year. Great beer for a cold winter night."
""
"O- This is a good stout. I think with some time down in my cellar this beer could become fantastic. Just needs to mellow out a bit for my taste."
"O: Overall, this is a good beer. I like the taste and smell but disliked the alcohol burn at the end of it."
"Overall: a different beast from the fabled coffee stouts, and stands as a great beer. Wondering what some age will do to this bad boy."
"O: This is simply fantastic. You'd be hard pressed to find a better non-barrel-aged Imperial Stout. There's nothing lacking here at all, just a pleasurable drinking experience."
""
""
"o- I wish this was available year-round. I just wanna drink this all the time."
"O - This was the first time I've had the FIS. It was a pretty nice surprise, very well done and complex flavors that melded together quite nicely for a regular run of the mill imperial stout from them. Makes me look forward to KBS!"
""
""
"overall: a good stout, but im not that impressed. founders is my favorite brewery, but this one doesn't live up to the hype and isnt worth the $4 per bottle i paid. dont get me wrong, this is a very good beer and im enjoying it right now, theres just better stouts out there for cheaper (looking at you obsidian)."
""
""
"Overall - Another fucking amazing Founders stout."
"Pours a ink black, with only a sliver of a chocolate head evident. Minimal lacing on my CBS snifter. Truly one of the darkest looking beers I've seen. The nose is mainly coffee, bitter chocolate, malt, and that's really about it. Not quite as good as Breakfast Stout's nose. The taste is... interesting. Not sure whether I love it or hate it. There are a bunch of malts, anise, burned biscuit, coffee, and some hops. After half a bottle... I don't think I'm a fan. The taste just doesn't taste.... well... good. None of the 10.5% ABV is evident. Feel is smooth, creamy, and goes down like butter. The feel is definitely the best part of this brew for me. Overall, I have to say- I'm not a fan of the taste of this beer. I probably will gift the other three bottles away to friends. This is like a Breakfast Stout gone awry... and I love just about everything Founders does. I won't buy this again though. Cheers."
""
"O: Hard to feel bad drinking this. Founders really nails most of their beers, melding quality and finesse in all sorts of styles. This is no exception."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is another fantastic brew from a fantastic brewery. This is a Double Imperial Stout all the way through. Anyone who is a fan of big roasty stouts will be a big fan of this beer."
"O- Had this the first time last year and have been waiting in anticipation for it to get released this year. A top notch RIS with a wonderful mouthfeel and a unique flavor profile with minimal sweetness."
""
""
"O: Another delicious, amazing stout from Founders. Right up there with their other offerings."
""
"27 Nov 2014 EDIT: No head, but otherwise smell and appearance are the same. Flavor is light, brief, and lackluster. Mouthfeel-- sticky. A couple of years later, I pretty much concur with my original assessment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorites, as are most Founders stouts."
""
"Such a big bad bruiser of a stout from Founder BC. Thick, rich, and bitter with a touch of sweet malt to keep it balanced. Flavors of coffee, espresso, dark chocolate, malted milk, and bitter hops make this one a slow sipper. The aroma is similar, but not particularly intense. Not terribly complex beer, but a tightly knit masterpiece of stout flavors. The finish lasts for minutes. Absolutely delicious."
"O- This one was about a year old and held up amazingly. The smoothness of this one is almost unreal. I recommend to buy this one up on sight and at the price point it may be hard to beat."
""
""
""
"O: One of the more bitter Russian Imperial Stouts I have had, even with the alcohol taste it is quite drinkable."
"Overall: Yet another home run from Founder's. The flavors in this beer really mesh. At 10.5% ABV, this beer is scary drinkable, and it is all but nonexistent, with only a faint hint of alcohol burn. I can't put this beer down."
""
""
"O - One of my favorite beers from my favorite brewery. Avoids the sweetness that kills many big stouts. Great in every aspect."
"Like I already said, its insanely thick with a full body. Definitely my favorite RIS."
""
""
"One of the better RIS that's I've had... A well-crafted beer that I will try to acquire some more of. I liked this a lot."
""
"Overall: Just heavenly. The best Imperial Stout I have yet found. No doubt the year of aging this bottle helped. First time I've ever tried this beer and would seek it out again."
"O: A solid imperial stout. The thick and big roasted flavors make this a sipper, something to enjoy in smallish quantities."
""
""
"Overall: Brash & thick. I was pleased with this one but the body didn't completely do it for me. This is still a top notch brew though."
""
""

"overall, simply an excellent RIS; no other way of putting it. i'd stop short of calling it world class, maybe, but no doubt it's upper echelon. i might even prefer it to the breakfast stout."
"12/12/12 Edit- Had another of the Jan 2011 batch that I originally reviewed. Age does wonders to this beer. Everything has mellowed out even more. Still has a nice dose of chocolate, molasses and dark fruits but is much more evenly keeled. Very nice. Just add a touch of bourbon and I can see how this is the base beer for KBS."

"Overall: Put on your seatbelts and grab yourself your favorite beer glass and indulge in one of the finest beers period. Not full of bubble but full of crisp fresh and might I add incredible flavor. If there is one not I would do is maybe slightly more carbonated....screw it, it tastes excellent. Cheers to all!"
"This brew poured out as a black thick looking liquid. The head was brown in color with a light lacing. The smell of the beer was heavily roasted with some burnt wood aromas in there too. The taste of the beer was good, it was roasted and bitter with a light sweetness in there too. The mouthfeel had a good oily thickness to it which was nice. It left a good coating in the mouth too. Overall this beer is pretty good."

"(O) Good solid stout. Seems like this would be the base beer for the KBS, CBS, and FBS. Has a lot of the same qualities with the exception of the added flavors in the other blends."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A wonderful beer, now I'm going to have to hunt down a fresh version of this beer in January. (Fresh is was still a good beer, I think 6 months to a year would be optimal aging)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: More impressed with this the second time around. I would definitely appreciate having steady access to this if I lived on the East Coast. I would have liked to age this longer, however."
""
""
"This is a big beer. Full bodied. Maybe not Expedition-thick, but not far off. Low carbonation level keeps it from being too tingly. It's a beer that just slides down your throat, and at a decent rate of speed if you're not careful. I've been wanting to try this beer for a long time, and Founders did not disappoint."

"M: nice medium bodied, very drinkable stout. Taste lingers but not super wet. Very good, very solid, comparable to w'n'b, but more coffee and fresher in this instance."
"Pours really thick, syrup thick. Overwhelming (in a good way) flavors. Satisfying mouthfeel. Could wax lyrical about all the flavors, etc. but will just report that when presented to my brother-in-law, he tried it.. paused... and then said with a far-off look in his eyes: ""it's.. it's just so... complex"". I thought he was going to cry. Advice - skip desert, have one of these tonight instead."
"Its very good quite roasty."
"Appearance is intimidating as it poured a dark viscous black with no head. Smells of dark chocolate and black coffee. Tastes of unsweetened chocolate and roasted malts. Pallate is oily slick and full bodied. Overall Very ominous. Thanks katje111 for the extra!"
"O: The more I drink this beer the more I like it. It's a bit hoppy at first, but the roastiness and dark chocolate flavors are really quite amazing. I wish Founders used this beer as a base beer for more beers."
"Overall: A quality offering by Founders, but not as good as KBS (or HopSlam). It could be more personal preference, but I seem to gravitate towards the chocolate stouts more than the coffee stouts. I taste the chocolate, but it is second seat to the coffee taste."
"O - Founders really know how to brew beer...ya think? Just another example of a close-to-perfect beer for the style that's easily accessible. Right up there with the other variants...excellent."
"This is a great beer, must be consumed slowly and enjoy all night, can't wait for next years version!"
"D - Found this to be a very good beer that I could drink regularly."
"A divine imperial stout."
"OA: Caught me off guard. Gotten used to chocolatey stout and sweeter stuff. This reminds me how the world of stouts still varies."
"Overall - The flavors are huge at the expense of aesthetics and drinkability. Wonderful flavors that require my full attention over the course of an hour or so. I am consistently wowed by the flavors, though."
"O- It's a quite good Imperial Stout. There are some out there I like a little more, but this one is quite good."
"Ridiculously good - big, dark, and brooding. One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts that I have tried in a long time. Quite oaky from barrel aging and a good amount of hop background balance it nicely. One slight criticism is a somewhat lighter mouthfeel - thinner than I would expect. Founder's makes great beer overall and I wish that we can get more here in Georgia"
"Overall: Solid, but a bit of a letdown overall. Complex malt profile is weakened by the overly thin mouthfeel. Still, it's worth drinking and hunting down every year when it comes around."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is awesome. Full bodied, with mild, low carbonation the produces a lush, velvety mouthfeel. Overall, a very solid imperial stout. Founders impresses me again."
"Overall: Top notch, well-balanced, and well-brewed, imperial stout. Aroma and flavor have some fantastic things going on, and the mouthfeel is wonderful as well. Hope to get one again next time it's sold!"
"Overall this is what a RIS is all about, great job Founders."
"O: A very complex and well crafted beer. Surprisingly the alcohol was only on the label, and perhaps in my legs afterwards..."
"Cheers."
"O: I like this stout alot and if I could do two reviews of one beer I would do a aged one these also."
"Full bodied but soft. Dry-ish and a bit chalky, though not in a bad way. Aromatic, flavorful, and a joy to drink."
"O: Yum. Not as good as the KBS I just had though. 4"
"Overall: Imperial has long been been one of my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts. This is a very nicely crafted ale that is somehow both simple and intense."
"Pours black as used motor oil. Smell is my favorite feature. Huge chocolate coffee combo that smells like something fresh from sixbucks a.k.a. starbucks. Malt, graham cracker, vanilla, and a bit of alcohol round out this beast of a nose. Taste wasn't as good as the nose, but still very good. Very malty, lots of coffee. Slight bit of chocolate and vanilla. Maybe just a tinge of sweetness to it. No hint of the ABV. Mouthfeel is creamy and gets creamier as it warms. I'd say it is between medium and full bodied, closer to the full end of it. Overall, this is very good. Very easy to drink for a high ABV stout. Highly recommended for a stout lover."
"O - An awesome RIS. Maybe the best I've had, but I really couldn't tell you. Would recommend to purchase if you can find this rare brew. I am now deeply regretting the fact that I left the last 4-pk of this on the shelf at Whole Foods so many months ago... I picked up KBS instead. Damn me... seriously."
"Cheers!"
"This beer pours nearly pitch black with a light brown head. The smells rich roasty with a slight hint of booze, there are also some dark chocolate notes in there as well. The taste comes through even diaries than the nose and that dominates the flavor. There are also some sweet and chocoaye undertones but they are harder to detect. The mouthfeel is good and I would say full bodied with good carbonation. Overall a very good stout but it's on par with others I have had that are easier to obtain like smuttys imp stout"
"Overall - At first I really wasn't getting much in the aroma (even after it warmed a bit from cellar temp ~50 degrees), and I thought it was just the brew, so I started drinking it. Then I didn't get all that much from the taste either. So I let it warm further and finally got the characteristics to shine through. So you know, you might want to let this one warm a little more than usual. Anyways, a very nice example of an RIS. This isn't my favorite of the style, but still one I'm quite glad to have tried. Thank you very much for this one McNuts!"
"O Delicious. Lots of roast, chocolate and hints of other flavors. Just great!"
"O: oddly this bottle is the first time I've seen this available locally, it is a great beer, and only wish it was more available."
"I have incredibly high standards when it comes to imperial stouts, and even more so from stouts that come from Founders. I'm glad to report that Founders Imperial Stout delivers the goods in spades. Wonderfully crafted with all the right buttons hit, I can only imagine what this fine example of brewing tastes like with some age on it. Will have to find out!"
"O: a pint is a lot to have of this, but it was worth it. It was only slightly better on tap - the growler keeps forever!"
"O: Was giddy at the beginning of this tasting experience, but it slipped away. Will definitely revisit and re-review, slightly colder"
"O: I remember my jaw hitting the floor when I first tried this last winter. I think I may have gotten pickier or maybe its the weather, but I think the bitterness is slightly over-the-top. I do like hops and espresso so I can enjoy this, but this may be a little harsh for many people. All in all a solid RIS that I look forward to trying at a far advanced age, much like Storm King."
"O - This is a tasty stout that I'm really enjoying right now with its good taste and minimal alcohol in the taste for the abv its very easy to drink worth hunting down to give it a try"
"Very good, with flare for unusual flavors. More tobacco less roast. Coffees wait behind licorice and dark bitter roots. Interesting and compelling. Though the drinkabilty suffers a bit too much for me. This a smoker's beer. Would be curious to try different vintages. I don't quite have an solid opinion on this one yet."
"Overall, a great beer. One that can compete with any imperial stout out there. Tons of rich roasted flavor and earthy hops up front, with a savory coffee and cocoa bean notes that round out the flavor. Pretty available given the time of year, and some what cheap when compared to other imperial stouts of similar quality."
"O - Overall, I love this beer. Founders makes some of the best stouts in the world and this is no exception. I think I enjoyed it even more on-tap but this is definitely worth seeking out in either form."
"Overall, I could rock this all the time. This is absolutely a fantastic imperial stout. Tons of flavor, and quite enjoyable. Very excellent."
"Overall : great beer very well done exactly what I would expect coming Founders. This beer is definitely a beer I'll be having again and would recommend to anyone looking for a imperial stout."
"Overall this is on of the better russian imperial stouts I've had, in the same class as Ten fidy and Stout Trooper in my opinion. Looking forward to have some more in the future."
"Imperial Stout pours out a dark black off the pour - no light is getting through this beer. A chocolate colored head develops and sits on top like a cap until it eventually fades out into some lacing. A mixture of bitter chocolate and roasted coffee greet you on the aroma with some sweetness on the finish. Alcohol takes the front seat on the first few sips, but fades out and allows the beer’s complex flavors to shine through. Hops hit up front, but are balanced nicely with roasted malts that are truly the backbone holding each flavor together. Chocolate and coffee notes are present, but not overwhelming. The alcohol slowly warms with each sip you take."
"D: An excellent imperial stout. Reminds me a lot of Imperial Stout Trooper. Would like to pick some up to age"
"Overall, a very good IS/RIS. Very rich, the 10.5% ABV is well hidden."
"Taste-Dark roasted coffee,anise, smooth tobacco and hop leaf. Very well-balanced and full of character. Super-smooth for ""high caliber"" (10.5)ABV. A definite slow sipper. Take your time and enjoy."
"D: Great stout from Founders once again, never let down with this brewing company, this brew was great, perfect balance of a stout!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Thanks Matt and Doug for hooking me up"
"Overall: Great beer, like a better Old Rasputin or a grown up Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout (like BCS spends its youth rampaging around, sowing its wild oats, then after it gets wiser and more skillful, becomes Founders Imperial Stout). What you'd expect from a brewery like Founders; lots of flavor, lots of balance."
"D - Very drinkable. Very nice balance of roasted, sweet, and chocolate flavors throughout. The beer is also really rich and complex."
"highly anticipated this beer and it is a good but not great imperial stout. don't get me wrong, I will drink it again but it has a lot of hype and I was expecting more."
"O: Such a wonderful interpretation of the style. I don't think Founders could possibly improve this beer. And it is drinking marvelously at 4 months. "
"O: A great beer, lives up to its reputation. Incredibly drinkable with a great flavor profile."
"Mouthfeel - carbonation is dead on, creamy, just dead on here."
"O- excelent impy. Everything im looking for. Great look, pitch black, smell and taste are top notch and mouthfeel matches everything else."
"overall, a great imperial stout."
"Thanks Founders, for making this accessible to people without having us have wait in a line at 8am for a 1 day only release."
"O: Very good beer overall. A tad too much alcohol on the tongue but still a fantastic brew. Great balance!"
"O: I enjoyed this but the Some of the flavors fell flat compared to other RIS's. Still a good brew though."
"*Still good after a year in the cellar, but probably a little better fresh*"
" will seek out again."
"I'd recommend it. Thanks Steve."
"This is my second review of this beer, because IT GOT BETTER. This has the blackness of the abyss of space with a brown foam that is amazing. The smell is rather vacant, but has hints of coffee and molasses. The taste is a combination of lots of molasses, some star anise, coffee and lots of cocoa powder. This is really smooth going down. I can't believe it lasted this long in the growler (4 months). It's really really tasty. Overall this is one of the better imperial stouts that I have had the good fortune to have. It goes to show that at the right temperature Imperial stouts can be one of the best styles around. I love this thing."
"O - Great brew, slightly on the over kill side of things, but stays away from becoming a hot mess… A great brew in a great trade! Thank you dsglovin!"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was actually the pour. Although it produced no head it was silent, thick, and utterly syrupy. This translated into a fantastic feel, with a huge creaminess and sticky smack to each sip. The flavors were there, and the aromas were big enough to mark this as an exemplary Russian Imperial."
"O – This is a really nice stout. Very glad to get to try it. You can sip on this all night long. The ABV while apparent is not overpowering. Great brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, not as thick as its appearance. But still very smooth and creamy. A definite slow sipper and night cap."
"O: Good Solid Beer."
"great beer. glad I found it. Excited to see how it develops with time."
"Mouth feel is really quite smooth and creamy. This beer is kind of sweet and thick but I really like the overall flavor."
"Poured deep dark black with a very small tan dead. The first smell from this is very boozy, then roasted malts with some chocolate coffee scent in the end. Taste is the roasted malt up from with a little bitter hops in the back. It ends with some warming alcohol flavor. The mothfeel is thick and chewy like any good stout should be. Overall this is an outstanding stout which I hope will continue to improve with some age."
"D: This is a very good RIS and I wouldn't expect anything less from Founders, they really know how to make a great stout. It is very smooth and creamy, a bit of noticeable alcohol present but not overpowering. A very solid, well balanced beer with excellent flavor."
"O: A really well constructed and all around great imp. Stout"
"Founders Imperial Stout pours an inky black. No light penetrates it. A quarter inch of light brown foam covers the beer and then recedes leaving an appealing ring around the outside of the glass. The beer is incredibly thick. It has legs more than lacing. The nose is sweet roasted malt and dark fruit. Taste follows the nose with flavors of char, raisins and figs. Bitter hops in the finish catch me off guard. This is a very complex brew. Feel is thick and chewy with enough CO2 to keep things interesting. Overall this is a very nice Impy Stout. ABV is hardly noticable and the thick, rich texture make this a joy to imbibe. Recommended!"
"Extremely high drinkability, as the 10.5% ABV barely peeks through, even with the slight bourbon flavor coming through in waves throughout this masterpiece. For any stout lover or coffee lover out there, this is a must try beer which I thought was excellent overall. A very high recommendation and a beer that I hope to have again soon."
"Overall- Excellent beer. If Founders made this a brewery only release with a gimmicky name, it would be among the most discussed beers on this site. However, I am much happier knowing that I can grab this bad boy off the shelf for 3 months of the year. If you like stouts, you will like this one!"
"O - For my first time having this, I am extremely impressed. Really enjoyable beer and surprisingly very drinkable. Glad I got to try it."
"Overall this is one fantastic RIS, up there with the best I've had. This was my first Founders beer and it is fantastic. I had been anticipating the moment I tried one of these and it was definetly up to the hype."
"Pours a pitch oily black with a fleeting finger of coffee brown/copper head into my duvel tulip. Nose shows hints of toffee almonds, semisweet chocolate, roasted mocha notes, movie theatre popcorn butter as well along with slight alcohol notes. Taste is rich bitter chocolate, bitter espresso, finishes with a dry somewhat metallic note. Very nice beer though i would take a breakfast stout/ kbs anyday though that doesnt diminish this beers quality."
"O – A nice brew. Touch boozy and sweet, even for the style imho, but still delicious."
"This is a big, bold, and ballsy beer, definitely potent, intense, and richly complex."
"Overall I must say that this beer was pretty tasty and smelled great, but I was really disappointed in the other two categories. The head, lace and carbonation never even said, ""here!", when called on. (""9 TIMES!"") If I were Ferris I would show up to school."
"Founders Imperial Stout pours, as one might expect, ink black. The foam cap is almost intimidating in how dark a caramel color it is. The head rises to about three fingers in height and manages to stick around for a decent chunk of time. There's a great ring of lacing right at the beer's high water mark, but below that it's just a little spotty. The nose is heavy on fudgy dark chocolate, with notes of molasses and anise present as well to add some balance. Unfortunately that molasses is lost in the transition to taste, because all I find here are that same great rich dark chocolate flavor dominating, with some licorice notes present as well. I'd have liked to see a little bit more besides anise (one of my less favorite stout flavors) acting as a counterpoint to the rich malt base. The body is wonderful though, very rich and full, and it accents the fudgy flavors well to further the impression of a decadent dessert beer. The carbonation is just a hair too dull to finish things off though, it doesn't quite make an impression through all the sweetness. Founders Imperial Stout is a great beer, maybe second only to Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout in terms of readily available RIS's"
"Overall, this is a grand example of a non-barrel aged imperial stout. Like I said, lots of boldness and lots of smooth drinkability."
"D: If you can get your hands on this, buy it."
"it reminds me a lot of Abyss and in all honestly i like this guy a tad more."
"Pours a deep blackish brown, no light shines through. The head is generous and has a very fine carbonation, a burnt caramel color. Smells of big roast, very bold and intense. Flavor is rich and full, lots of roasted malt and chocolate, big finish, alcohol is warming. Overall a solid imp stout, wish it was year 'round, this puppy has some bite."
"D- oily and slick in the mouth. Still a thick mouth full. I love this 2008. I will be looking for some more of the recent release."
"O) The amount of alcohol bit and flavor take over what would otherwise be a perfect stout. This one needs far more time than the current off-the-shelf presentation I am sampling."
"D-Definitely a sipper."
"Overall one of the best imperial stouts I've had. Really bold flavors paired with a good feel makes beer magic for me."
"Full bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is thick, coats your mouth well, and leaves a nearly syrupy stickiness. The thick mouthfeel helps to remind you how intense this beer is. However, I would have preferred a little more carbonation to increase the drinkability."
"Overall it's a decent representation of the style. I may have liked it when it was a little more fresh."
"Overall, I like this brew quite a bit. Another solid offering from Founders and a solid RIS. Not one of my favorites for the style, but still well done. Worth picking up a bottle or two."
"Overall, I was floored by this stout. Incredible balance and depth of flavor. As complex as almost any stout out there. Just delicious and absolutely spot on for the style. My only complaint is that I don;t have it available locally. Honestly, this is almost in the same league as the Kate I had the other day (And that's my favorite non barrel aged stout). My highest recommendation."
"On the whole, I don't enjoy this as much as Breakfast Stout or KBS, but it's a great beer nonetheless."
"O: One of the best imperial stout's I've tried and unfortunately for me, something that is hard to find in the area in it's seasonal release. It's definitely chocolate forward, but it's a classic RIS that has great balance and a pleasant hop profile (more citrus than leaf)."
"Great one to sip on. All stout lovers rejoice!"
"This is a rich, complex, decadent RIS. This will be a must for me every winter from now on."
"will try to track this down in bottles to save for sure."
"O - Great to drink and enjoy. I wouldn't say it is the best RIS out there but it is a damn good one."
"O: A really good stout."
"O - Alot more complex than I was expecting this one to be. Definitely something I would recommend to someone that is into the style, or is interested about the style. Founders brewed a solid brew here."
"D: Very drinkable and well balanced. Easily rose to the ranks of one of my favorite imperial stouts that I have tried. Great beer at at a reasonable price, hopefully they don't start wax dipping these bad boys. Great cool weather beer."
"One of the better ris's ive had. You would do well to pick this up."
"Pours a super thick super black color with a very small 1/2 dark chocolate colored head that fades to nothing. Little lacing here and there on the glass. Smells very nice with coffee/espresso, bittersweet chocolate, alcohol, and slight soy sauce. Oddly, I also get a distinct aroma of onion dip. Taste is very rich with strong brewed coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and slight licorice. Slight coffee bitterness after each sip. There is a tiny bit of alcohol burn in the throat. Low carbonation makes this a very thick and creamy beer that coats the mouth. Overall, a great RIS that I am very happy I got to try."
"Overall - A great stout, I'm not sure if it's the best I've ever tasted but it is at the top of that list for sure, a little strong on the alcohol taste and a little muted on the others. All in all if you get that chance to taste this bad boy, it is really worth it, I would definitely drink this again!"
"Verdict: Find it at all costs, folks, it's worth every penny...NO I GOTTA GO THRASH!!!"
"Pours out black with a thin tan head that has light, but decent lacing, very little retention and moderate carbonation. This brew has a very strong chocolate aroma along with some coffee, dark fruits and sweet malts. The first thing I taste is some coffee followed by some dark fruits (raisins, and plums come to mind), and the taste finishes off with some bitter chocolate. The dark fruits add some sweetness that balances well with the chocolate. I can taste a little bit of alcohol near the end, but not real strong for a beer having 10.5% ABV. The mouthfeel is a nice creamy, but sticky brew that is lip smacking good. I enjoyed this one and will drink it again. This in my opinion is not as good as Old Rasputin or Thirsty Dog's Siberian Nights, but still worth getting."
"Pours a ink black with a very dark brown head. Scent is not overpowering, but the roasted malts, chocolate and coffee notes are there. Taste is a deep, rich balance of those roasted malts and bitter chocolate. Very little carbonation, thick and creamy mouthfeel. This a really nice RIS. Founders rarely disappoints."
"Overall: A very good and tasty version of a Russian Imperial Stout."
"As a whole, this might be my favorite ""normal"" Imp. Stout. It drinks incredibly smooth, is sweet without being sticky, is creamy without being overly heavy, and blends together the traditional Imp. Stout flavors as well as any other example of the style I can think of. I was quite happy to be able to buy this beer for 10 a 4pack, I just wish there was more of it to buy. Drink this beer!!"
"Pours jet black with a small tan head. In the aroma, coffee and a small roast. In the taste, big coffee and a nice roasted malt, sweet to dry. A smooth and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry coffee coffee aftertaste. Big coffee, hides the alcohol, and quite fantastic."
"Pours into a tulip a dark black with a very dark brown foamy head that has great retention. Nose is smooth, very appealing with lots of dark roasted coffee and cocoa notes, also a good amount of hops come through, as listed on the bottle at 90 IBUs. Taste is also smooth and complex; hits all the right flavour notes with burnt malts and an ever so slightly hop presence. A bit of heat felt in the finish is welcoming for the next sip on this cool afternoon. Heavily bodied and a creamy, lucious mouthfeel. A sipper of a RIS, meant to enjoy, no less because of only one 4-pack acquired on a rare trip into Michigan. Thorooughly enjoyed this beer, Founders just nail the stouts style so well and continually impress this craft enthusiast. Also sports one of my favourite Founders & overall beer labels."
"O-Stellar and dangerously drinkable!"
" Overall I would say that I have become a fan of Founders and am trying to neep myself from opening the bottle of KBS I have waiting til next winter. DO yourself a favor and make sure you try this Imperial Stout."
"O: I wish I had more of these to age. Its showing a lot of potential but its still quite rough around the edges, I'll have to try and track some more down to see what it becomes as it mellows out. Pretty balanced for what it is though."
"O - Really wish I knew what year this was so I could rate accordingly. Its a nice imperial stout but I could use a bit more chocolate. Didnt get any espresso at all. Not too many cold days/nights left, now is the time to be enjoying these! Looking forward to seeing how the last 3 age."
"D: Drinkability isn't very high at all as it is right now. Viscous stouts rarely are, and this one is just a bit to boozy to put down easily. I think with some age this could mellow out and become a very nice stout. That isn't to say that it's not good now, it's just a touch hot. Overall, it's still quite enjoyable."
"Overall: This beer is my favorite non barrel aged RIS. Gives Old Raspy some serious competition. I might have to do a side by side to see which i prefer. Almost to close to call. Another exceptional beer made by Founders that reminds me that around the Great lakes area of the USA... they ARE the black beer authority!"
"O- I am not a huge stout fan but I would drink this again... That is if there was nothing else to drink and this was all I could get. Still better than others I have tried."
"O: This was a notch below KBS & CBS, and probably two below the Nemesis. The alcohol burn was quite noticeable in this beer, though it has a similar strength as the others. Very true to style."
"All in all, this one is solid. maybe a touch one-dimensional and a bit on the syrupy, sweet, and burnt notes, but i like that it's not intensely boozy and thick and rich. Definitely one I'll try to track down again."
"It would be difficult to put down more than 1 or 2 of these monsters in a sitting. I think 1 will be plenty for me. Amazing appearance, smell, flavor and feel. As far as imperial stouts go, it doesn't get much better than this. A masterpiece!"
"This is an imperial stout for those who don't like the uber-malty, syrupy RIS's. Thinner, and more focused on roasted and dark chocolate notes, I found it went down very easily. Alcohol pretty much completely masked. Not bad at all."
"O - Overall a great beer. Not as amazing as KBS, but hey, what is? I like this a little better than the Breakfast Stout because of its predominant smokey character."
"O- A great RIS stout, and one of the best masked abv's I've drank. Normally a beer like this slows you down, not this one. Flavors and the forgotten ""drinkability"" make this excellent. I would've loved to try the barrel aged version. Founders is probably the best in the business in doing stouts. I cannot wait to try the KBS tommorow, and some day CBS. For the time being, I'd gladly settle for this."
"A solid RIS. Unfortunately it was kinda difficult to get and I would imagine from years to come will get even tougher to get that I'd probably just grab some old raspy as it's much easier to get and pretty damn good itself."
"*I've only had a few RIS so far (Smuttynose, Rasputin, Samuel Smith) so may need to revisit later."
"O: Excellent taste and mouthfeel. Despite the ABV this is highly drinkable. For a non-barrel aged beer this drinks like a world class barrel aged stout. Purely amazing."
"Finish: Burnt malts with stickiness on the lips and caramel with a nice hop back note"
"Pours pitch black with one finger creamy, medium brown head, fades in a minute to a thin ring, leaving a few blobs of lace behind. Smell: molasses, dark chocolate, earthy, with notes of smoke, anise, and faint alcohol. Taste: roasted grain, a little char and caramelized sugar, lots of dark chocolate, black plum skin, a little anise at the end of the sip. Hopping is earthy and sweetened grapefruit. Medium-to-full bodied, nice middle ground between syrupy and creamy. Nice RIS with alcohol pretty well hidden and the considerable sweetness is kinda balanced by the hop flavors. Year not noted on bottle, but from the store I'd guess 2011 but possibly 2010."
"Overall: A delicious beer. One of the top Imperial Stouts for sure. A few days later, I paired this with a slice of mocha chocolate cake - incredible, this beer goes great with chocolate desserts."
"A great beer, loved all the bold flavors and how everything works together. The strong roastiness was countered nicely by the sweetness, very well done."
"Overall - a really good imperial stout. A definite sipper, the alcohol creeps up as it warms a bit. Another great Founders beer."
"Pours black. Black even as it comes out of the bottle. Looks viscous. Tiny tan head. Smell is very intense roasted malt. A little smokey. Taste has a nice malty sweetness. Big roasted malt again. Bitterness from the roast malt. Some chocolate and coffee notes. Significant hop bitterness also. Think creamy mouthfeel which is what I want in an Imp. Stout. Although it's very good, this is a sipper. A very good Imperial Stout overall."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter glass at ChurchKey. Pours opaque black with a nice brown head that leaves some light and sloppy lacing and a film on top of the beer. Aroma of roasted barley malts, molasses, dark chocolate, coffee, dirt, and toasted brown sugar. The flavor improves upon the aroma. The same qualities are there- roasted malts, molasses, dark chocolate, coffee, earthy notes along with some figs, smoked wood, burnt toast, nuts, hops, and plums. Some hop and alcohol bitterness comes in the finish. Full-bodied, with a rich, robust, and thick mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Dry, roasty, smoky aftertaste. Gets better as it warms."
"Another great release from Founders. Great flavors, smell and mouthfeel in this beer. Can't ask for much more out of an Imperial Stout."
"Black beer all the way with a little tan head. Smells of malts and chocolate. The taste is the same as the smell. Mouthful goes pretty much the same smooth and chocolatly and very strong like chocolate liquor. Drinkabilty. This one had me buzzing after 1 beer do to its abv, but its worth the money for this beer. Why pay for chocolate liquor when you can have founders imperial stout for a reasonable price!!!"
"Pours black with a cocoa head. Looks good. Nice smell of chocolate and roast. The hops blend very nicely with that roast flavor to form a nice balance on the palette. This is accompanied with a bit of chocolate and a great deal of smoothness. Very agreeable. Mouthfeel is heavier and creamier than average, but not as good as some. Tick this up a touch because it is very good."
"This is a big full chewy feel to it. Really soft carbonation to it. I feel like I should reiderrate, this is a huge beer. Overall, this is the real deal. This is a no nonsense straight up RIS. May as well be the poster child for the style."
"O: What can I say but classic... perfection."
"O: Very good and enjoyable. Would seek this out."
"D-well, its not the easiest drinking stout. it definitely took me awhile to finish but it was enjoyable all the way through. this is highly impressive for this style."
"Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, viscous and heavy. This is the opposite of watery in every sense of the word. Chewy and full, the finish is sticky and mouth-smackingly good. Drinkability is as good as it gets for a beer like this, as the abv of 10.5% is noticeable only beneficially in the taste, and doesn't affect the ability to take swig after swig. You could sip this or chug this and it would be awesome either way. Great, great beer, and once again Founder's fulfills expectations."
"D: This is an easy drink, a great end of the night beer or for a cold day. And as for the abv% it doesn't taste as strong as it looks."
"Nice overall beer with def drinkability. The alcohol is present and accounted for with this big guy."
"Drinkability: I hate the limited availability of this beer. Goes down smooth and warms the soul."
"A very good imperial stout."
"This drinks very smoothly. Each sip leaves you wanting another. A very well crafted RIS. No frills, no gourmet chocolate, no espresso beans, no barrels, no weasel shit, just good brewing."
"O: By far my favorite RIS. Complex and well balanced, with no sense of the ABV."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is one thick and rich stout. Reminds me a bit of Ten Fidy. A good beer to have on this fine St. Patrick's day morn. Cheers!"
"Overall - I was very impressed. A delicious RIS. Very complex tastes and smells here, excellent mouthfeel, very filling. Just a solid beer."
"Pour is deep space black with a nice chocolate head. Not much else you can say about a stout really. Smell is sticky sweet molasses and bitter coffee with hints of dark chocolate. Very fine smelling stout and quite strong too. Taste is sublime! Nice hop/coffee bitterness upfront with sticky sweet dark chocolate with an almost cloying sugar sweetness. I love by bitter IPA's but when it comes to stouts this is what I like to see. Drinkability does suffer a bit due to sweetness though. Otherwise this is top of the line and one of my absolute favorites!"
"D- Super easy to drink for 10.5% ABV. Solid RIS, if I could get it near me I would pick this up a lot."
"The appearance of this beer was great. Poured a small foam head, jet black in color, and left a nice chocolate lacing around the glass. The smell the first 10-20 minutes was very metallic in nature. Still had hints of coffee, but I didn't smell the chocolate until it warmed up. Halfway through the glass the smell was great. Same result with the taste. The first 20 minutes the taste was just OK. Not until it warmed up did it have the very bitter chocolate taste with a coffee backbone that I look for in a RIS. The mouthful was great, carbonation was noticeable, but I didn't pick up on any notes of alcohol once it warmed up. Overall an another exceptional beer from Founder's. I could easily drink a 4 pack, but with the hefty ABV, 2 may be my limit."
"Overall- What more can you say, another excellent stout from Founders, they flavors stay with you long after the drink."
"Lush and deeply satisfying stout - the perfect night-cap."
"Tremendous satisfyingly thick feel with low-moderate carbonation."
"Thanks go out to Joe at Gordon's for the recommendation.,"
"D- Really great brew. The 10.5% ABV makes this a sipper."
"D - Delicious brew. I wouldn't mind this once per night. Great liquid desert. Founders does it again in my book. This is definitely a 5 even with the higher ABV."
"Like expedition stout this drinks like a milk shake, but damn this first beer of the night is going down like water."
"d-a sipper for me but a drinker for some, could get used to this if it last longer"
"D - This is a good stout, but a little 'hoppier' than I would prefer my Russian Imperial Stouts to be."
"I think founders imperial is awesome, nice sweetness complimented by a great roasted flavor. if this beer were available in Nevada i would drink it again and again, and enjoy it every time."
"The abv felt less than 10% while I was drinking it, but it wasn't unnoticeable either. I was definitely feeling this beer afterward though. A wonderful RIS, worth seeking out."
"Rich, deep and pretty straightforward. I'd be happy to have this again."
"Drinkability is great with this one. Very thick and heavy, definitely a one and done, but very enjoyable. A good beer to sit and sip over a few hours over a winter evening while fresh and also one that might improve with some age."
"Another +1 for Founders in my book."
"D: A great beer but the burnt roasted malts are a bit over the top; this is a good sipper and not too boozy but it's still not one you could drink all night"
"D - Pretty good. I enjoyed this one but the roast began to wear me down over the course of the glass. Still a very nice beer. Glad I finally got to try it."
"Put on your big boy pants for this one. A good Imperial stout without the pleasantries of the Founders Breakfast Stout or KBS."
"D - This has excellent drinkability. I have a hard time putting this one down, even though I'm trying to pace myself. This beer looks, smells, and tastes great. I really like this beer, and I will definitely be having more. I highly recommend this. Awesome job Founders. Cheers."
"Drink- Why did I only ask for one of these. Damn this was tasty. Big flavors again out of a small bottle. I like that analogy"
"Pours a dark pitch black with a red amber tine. Los of bubbles and lacing with a lot of foam. Smelled of coffee, chocolate and toffee with some roasted flavors too. Tasted of coffee, roasted alts and cocoa. Thick, creamy, rich and heavy on the mouthfeel. Went down pretty smooth but alcohol% is sneaky especially as it warmed up."
"D--Heavy and hot, needs time. This is a beer that will benefit greatly by aging..."
"Nearly jet black, deep tan head that recedes to the edges of the glass, almost no lace on the glass. Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and nice bittersweet notes round out the nose. Taste is of coffee, chocolate, nice firm bitterness, mildly hoppy, brownie like taste, rich dark malt, nice chocolaty finish. The taste of this is out of this world. Full body, creamy and almost milkshake like, decent carbonation and overall very nice. Drinks well, great imperial stout, sweet and bitter, very complex and wholly satisfying."
"really good stuff !"
"D- Very delicious, heavy complex brew, well balanced with all the ingredients (bitterness, sweetness, earthiness) equals amazing beer."
"D - Very good. Could drink multiple of these, no problem finishing the bottle, wished I had more."
"For nearly 11% abv this is a very easy to drink beer. It's sweeter than I expected. The flavor really comes alive as the beer warms in the glass."
"D- The ABV is very well hidden behind the delicious complexity of dessert style malt."
"This is exactly what I expected from Founders and I'm again staggered by how on point their brews are. I'm happy I have a few bottles so I can let one mellow out a bit; I can only anticipate this beer getting better with time."
"Overall, another excellent beer from Founders. This is only my third beer from them and so far, by far my favorite. This is a very exceptional Imperial stout... and you don't even have to go to a release or trade your cellar for it. This makes me quite glad that Founders has come to New York. I would wholeheartedly recommend this one. Cheers!"
"D- very nice imperial stout, this is my first time trying it and im sad its taken me this long, although this is a seasonal i would drink this year round if i could, props to founders for another great brew"
"A bit rough around the edges but just oozes promise and potential. Certainly can feel the makings of KBS here as well. A very nice beer and one that should mellow and smooth into something quite special."
"Drinkability, especially considering it's an Imperial Stout, is high. I could drink these all night if it weren't for the fact I wouldn't be able to stand after only a few. Very well balanced and awesome. Doesn't get much better IMO."
"D-drinkable but not the best"
"Pours dark dark brown. Almost black. A full finger of brown frothy head that disipates quickly leaving a thin layer of brown bubbly goodness across the surface. Smells very roasty and malty. Very sweet on the nose and tongue. On the tongue there is a lot of tange and sharp bitterness from the roast and light hops but there is a smooth full bodied malt profile. Very solid brew and a great mouthfeel to boot. Very drinkable as well"
"D - I like it. It's interesting, tasty and not excessively big. Good beer overall."
"D: Good beer, but one and done."
"D - A very nice Imperial Stout that has a great mouthfeel...had it beside a Green Flash Double Stout and this one was my clear favorite...the flavors were full and rich...watch the ABV though because you can't taste it"
"D: This is a great, straightforward imperial stout. The flavors and feel are so pure and balanced. Wow."
"D-Another standout beer from Founder's."
"I could drink this one often but not in a row only due to the alcohol showing its teeth a bit and the hops being a bit too present for me. Really though, I'm nitpicking more than I should. This beer is an exceptional example of a RIS and at this price I need more!"
"M/D: This beer had very low carbonation, but it allowed the creamy characteristics to come out. I think this is beers is one of the easiest imperial stouts to go down. smooth, rich, yet complex."
"D- Highly drinkable, I keep going back to the glass faster than I intend to. Lots of good roasty flavors make this a joy to drink and keep it interesting throughout the glass. I'm glad I was able to grab one of these, and I look forward to enjoying them in the future."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, strong but well-disguised kick, good representation of style, I have a feeling I might have let this one sit a little too long (at least two years, possibly longer) but it's still a good big stout worth drinking for a long time."
"Appears dark blackish black. Nice head full brown and lacing. Aroma is strong of roasted malt, double strength coffee, chocolate and alcohol. In the taste, deep roasted flavors. Black coffee, charred malts and some booze as it warms. Clean alcohol. Dark chocolate. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is full bodied and fairly smooth. Medium carbonation. A big beautiful beer and Im glad I have a few more to set aside for a while. Im sure the booze will mellow out alot but it was not distracting here. Certainly worth the purchase, but damn the 4-pack I could have went with 6 for sure."
"D: Very nicely done by Founders. A nice imperial with good complexity. Definitely seek it out."
"Great stout from Founders, some age on this beer will take it to another planet.. it needs to mellow out. Recommended if you can get it."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - The smoothest and richest stout I have ever tasted. This is just fantastic. I could sip this all day and night. Medium bodied. I can't stop checking out the lacing on the glass as I let the taste settle in my mouth."
"Overall, this is excellent. Its unfortunate that it is a seasonal, because I would love to be able to find it easier."
"This pours jet black with a dark brown head, probably the darkest head I've seen, that has varied for me between two fingers and almost nothing. It leaves a bit of lacing, especially if the head starts out big. On the nose it's a huge hit of bitter chocolate, sweet malts, and some espresso underneath. In the mouth it's a huge, thick body, tons of bittersweet chocolate, some hop and chocolate bitterness at the back of the tongue, some prickly carbonation that lingers forever and ever, amen. It starts out quite sweet but finishes nice and bitter, maybe just a touch of pleasant heat, totally fantastic. It's thick and huge, more of an end-of-session or with-dinner beer for me, but plenty good. One of my favorites, rivaling FBS in my book. I'd love to do a side by side."
"cheers!"
"An absolutely amazing beer, I like this better than Breakfast stout. Can't wait for their Bourbon cousin in March."
"Jet black in color. Reddish tan thin, thin head. Some Belgian lace clings to my glass. The nose is roasty chocolate, coffee and some licorice. Flavor is what is expected from a RIS. Rich roasty, cacao, coffee, and a bit of hops. Smooth and unctuous. Some alcohol heat at the end. Amazing full body."
"This is a wonderful RIS. It fits right in with Founders stellar stout lineup."
"D: Not the easiest-drinking stout, but still good. I might have a couple glasses."
"This is a good balance of intense flavor and drinkability. This may be better fresh and on tap opposed to bottle aged."
"D: The glass was fully enjoyable, and the beer evolved quite a bit as it warmed up, which definitely kept my interest (and even if it hadn't, the flavors were great all around and could have kept me nearly as satisfied). Not in a great hurry to have another right away, but definitely looking forward to seeing how this beer cellars."
"O - A great stout. Highly recommend this one. Still as good as ever!"
"The beer was think & heavy but at the same time was very easy to drink."
"D: high high, for the abv, I could drink this all night"
"Notes: It's on another level. Truly one of the best on the market. There isn't a bad thing to be said about it. I can't believe there isn't more hype surrounding this beer."
"Drinkabilty - Only reason this aint higher is this monster is 10.5% This really is special. Amazing how hoppy it is for a stout and yet works so well . Beyond great, i cant believe this beer is not in the top 50 list, This stout crushes 99% of the stouts out there with taste, balance and uniquness. A must try from possible thee best craft brewery going today."
"Often overshadowed by Breakfast Stout and Kentucky Breakfast Stout, this one definitely has the ability to stand on it's own."
"one of the best stouts out there a in a close race with the goose island night stalker"
"Overall great offering from Founders - in all honesty - I don't think it needs to be this big though. 9% would be probably perfect."
"D- Delicious, though a bit rich, high on ABV and, a bit steep for a four pack."
"This beer is an A+ but, it didn't look as sexy as others."
"Very drinkable and also would probably age very nicely."
"Overall, a great beer."
"D: For me this is one of the best Imperial Stouts I have had the pleasure of trying. Founders never disappoints when it comes to the malt forward beers. If it wasn't 10% the drinkability would be through the roof. Cheers."
"It's a very pronounced beer and the flavors stay with you well after you're done."
"The Imperial Stout pours an oily, very viscous, lifeless black sludge with no head, just slight dark khaki bubbling. It smells of both bitter and sweet dark chocolate and features freshly ground coffee bean aromas. It tastes of both bitter and sweet chocolate with good roastiness with a touch of alcohol on the backend. It's very, very thick and coats the mouth like cough syrup. It's very good and has excellent flavor but the thickness is a little over the top, even for an imperial stout. This beer is definitely a sipper."
"I think this stout will do great with some age and thanks again Founders...I'm sure you made many people happy with this batch!"
" Wow...This beer poured Black with a lingering ecru head. Not much lacing with a sticky, boozey residue that stains the glass. Exactly what I expected. Smell is lovely..chocolate,slight coffee, anise,a bit of alcohol. Taste is bitter chocolate, roasty malts,good hop bitterness,molasses sweetness, 10.5 apv masked well. Mouthfeel is just about spot on, with good carbonation and a slight chewy finish...I wish I could drink this year round,,"
"D- A foward in your face Russian Imperial Stout that goes down with ease. Whats unique here is that this brew is big all around, in flavor and abv, yet its drinkability gives you the ability to enjoy all its robustness. Would pair excellently with a creamy rich desert."
"D: This is a sipper, but its so good that it doesn't have to be if you catch my drift. Dangerous beer alert, man this is good!"
"Puny lager cannot hurt Imperial Stout! Imperial Stout smash!"
"While no KBS or CBS, this is still a very solid, very enjoyable RIS from Founders. When it comes to imperial stouts, I think it's readily apparent that the folks at Founders know what they're doing."
"D- Extremely drinkable. It reminds me of a ton of very thick full bodied stouts because of the flavor, but at the same time, it doesn't go down like a meal. It's a full, solid stout, but it drinks easy. I picked up 1 4pk to try it, but had to grab another 2 to stock up on it. I'd buy a whole case if there wasn't duty at the border."
"O: This is a really phenomenal beer and is a great representation of the style. I think it aged pretty well, but it still tastes better fresh. I still have a few left, so we'll see how it hold up, but I'd say drink it fresh and don't look back! (4 / 4.5)"
"If I didn't have a job to go to tomorrow or a limited supply of this I could drink this one forever. Wow."
"Founders Imperial Stout is a balanced RIS with a huge alcohol presence and a great blend of sweet and roasted flavors and a bitter and smokey finish."
"Great beer."
"This is the best non-barrel aged stout I've ever had. Delicious."
"Finally, a beer getting excited about! This brew has it all, and I give it high marks on all aspects for the style. It's thick, nearly chewy, black as night, roasty, coffee in nose, bit-o-licorice in the taste to go along with the nose. I could honestly live without the licorice, but, I'm sure it's there for some reason. Not much in the chocolate, but, not overwhelming in the coffee either. However, there is a lot of flavor! When finished, there is sediment in the glass. There's just too much stuff in the beer to be absorbed! I love a nice RIS, and I would have to say this is my new favorite! Better than Old Rasputin, Brooklyn Chocolate, and even Chocolate Yeti. (High praise from me indeed!) Seek this one out, and hopefully, you'll find a 4-pack for $11 or $12."
"(99th)"
"This is one to savor and for good reason. What this beer lacks in subtlety it makes up for with bold and complex flavors. Every sip you can latch on to a different aspect and be wowed by the skill it must have taken to make a beer like this. When I approached the end of the glass I enjoyed a bit of good quality 60% cocoa chocolate with what was left and this beer made the chocolate taste disappointing."
"D: I am interested to try this beer at a colder temperature, however, with this review, I have to say I am quite disapointed. Founders is a first class brewery and this just doesn't measure up to their standards. There are many more imperial stouts out there that are head and shoulder above this. (Second review; Ok i retract everything. At a colder temp, this is quite awesome. I usually use North Coast Old Rasputian as the standard for this style and this is quite close. I have totaly re-done my review based upon how good this was at a colder temp. I am very impressed, but then again, I ahve never been let down by founders. I used to think that Stone was my favorite brewery, well, they have company."
"A solid R.I.S. and I do like just about everything I've had from Founders but this to me doesn't belong in the Top 100 beers of the world. Very basic."
"Serving type: bottle"
"this is pretty decent, not a sugary desert bomb that many imperial stouts turn into. has some bite it. i dig it."
"*Having revisited this one multiple times, including in a recent stout tasting, I'm deciding to bring the score up a bit. FIS seems to have my ideal base profile for an imperial stout. I still think it has a bit more heat than I'd like when fresh though.*"
"easily my favorite Founders Stout."
"The aroma was full of sweet and roasted malts, fresh Starbuck's coffee, rich chocolate cake and a little bit of hops. The taste was phenomenal. Bitter dark chocolate, roasted bready malts, a little bit of alcohol, some hop bitterness and iced coffee. It was very well carbonated, a medium to full body and a mouth-coating creaminess. This was the freshest I've ever had FIS, and it was truly a wonderful experience. Three thumbs up!"
"If this was a Waxed bomber sold one day, it would be massive, but 12oz bottles can't fit much hype inside, just amazing beer."
"D: A fantastic imperial stout. Without a doubt, I will have to find some of these bottles when they come around and stash them away. Compares very closely in quality to Bell's Expedition Stout, but Founder IS definitely lands on the sweeter, breadier side of the style versus more roasted and hop-aggressive."
"D: Amazing drinkability for a 10.5% imp stout. There is a touch of booziness, but its so smooth, tasty and balanced that it doesn't even matter. Can't find a bottle date, but its gotta be from this year."
"An absolutely outstanding imperial stout. There are so many other imperial stouts that get hyped up that fall below the level of this beer. I wish I would have found out about this one sooner, will definitely be re-visiting it again."
"Full smooth body with decent carbonation, a little chewy. Drinks really slick and easy, pleasant on the palate, solid flavor and the alcohol is in check considering its over 10%. Another great beer from Founders."
"A solid Imperial Stout from Founders, undoubtedly one of the best breweries out there. I still prefer the Breakfast Stout over this one but it is still definitely worth a try."
"O - This is a big ass stout that demands respect from the moment you pour, to the last bit of thick syrupy malt that is left on sides and bottom of your glass. A maximum bodied malt-bomb. A newfound legend."
"O: Just an awesome, complex and rewarding brew. I really wish this Imperial Stout got as much recognition, distribution and push as their Breakfast Stout, as this may be the unsung hero of their lineup. One of the better RIS's I've had."
"D: I could drink this beer all f$@king night. This is outstanding. Just outrageous I don't have more."
"Overall, an excellent stout and it's tough to choose any other over this, within the same style."
"D= This was a tasty treat for sure. Worth checking out and worthy of some of the praise it gets. While I don't think it is the best imperial stout I've ever had it is better than some of the more hyped impy stouts."
"Drinkability - For what this beer is, it is damn drinkable. Very glad I was able to try this seeing as I have missed it every time I am back in the Midwest. How odd I have to drive up to Nor Cal to try this! Thanks again Abel."
"I really like fbs and kbs, cbs is up there too but the smokiness/ burnt bitterness of this beer just isnt somethin I can get into. Will be sitting on my last two for atleast a few more years in hopes that they turn into something I can enjoy more"
"D: A superb beer. Founders does it again."
"drinkability - this is a sipper but something that i could sit and drink many of them over a night, possible my next candidate for a poker game, one of(if not) my favorite russian imperial stouts"
"Mouthfeel is perfection. Thick and viscous, nicely carbonated, creamy, but not sticky. Delightful."
"D: This is a very awesome beer from Founders, maybe one of my favorite offerings they have. At 10.5%, you can barely tell. If this beer had a little more flavor packed into the taste it would maybe be a top 5% RIS for me, and it's easily top 10%."
"D: A pretty impressive beer and one that I would buy now and then if it were available to me. I love that it's in a 12oz bottle since I don't know if I'd want to drink any more than that by myself. Cheers!"
"Overall this another wonderful stout from a brewery that knows what they are doing when it comes to stouts... and just about any style they choose to brew."
"Another top quality beer from Founders. Highly recommended."
"D: Very good and very dangerous. I put this in the same ring as Bell's Expedition and GI BCS."
"Still another great beer from Founders what can I say, I get more and more impressed with these guys every time."
"A very impressive beer. It's about 3 dollars more per 4 pack than Old Rasputin around here but I really dig the chewiness of this. I will definitely pursue this in the future."
"The CPJ"
"Notes: kick-ass stout. the burnt malt flavors are very welcome as they add character and invoke thoughts of malt and fire"
"D- It's a sipper that I would have no problem drinking two or three in one sitting. The smoothness and richness create a perfect balance. I wish this was available year round"
"Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured pitch black with a three finger tan head that subsided to a half finger very very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel, and slight alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. The flavor was very nicely balanced and enjoyable. Both a great aroma and flavor going on here. For the alcohol content, this one is pretty easy drinking, so drink with caution. A must try without a doubt."
"Overall I could drink more of this than other imperial stouts. I'll probably be trading for more of this in the future."
"EDIT- 1/30/12 I bought a fresh four pack this year and while the aged version was a little smoother, I found the mouthfeel and appearance were better so I adjusted the score because of that. This has to to be the best looking RIS I have had. I got three fingers worth of fluffy mocha head that left tons of lacing, this is the best looking RIS hands, as far as I am concerned this is the best RIS made in Michigan."
"Overall, this is the definition of what a RIS should be. Brews take notes, Founders is where it's at."
"Founders IS is a delicious slow-sipper and is a damn fine interpretation of the style. The taste is maybe just a tad bitter and acidic, but is also big, bold, and flavorful. This is one of which I will always pick up a four pack each year it comes out and enjoy the bottles over the course of time."
"It's been a while since I've had a fresh Founders Imperial Stout, but I don't remember liking it near this much. 2 years seems like a great time to drink this beer..."
"d - A really great RIS; I loved this beer. I thought the nose was amazing and the taste was almost as good. It also had a great body. Would love to have this again."
"Chewy full body with a deep roasted malt flavor. There is a huge silky chocolate and roasted coffee bean presence that is balanced vry nicely by a lactic cream character. I'm also picking up hints of toast, toffee, hazelnut, oatmeal and slight dark fruit. This beer is very comlex and the well masked ABV makes this dangerously drinkable. Slightly bittertowars the end of the palate with a bone dry finish and slight alcohol warmth. Excellent!"
"I'm not even a big fan of imperial stouts, but I can drink this every day. Intensely deliciously, and absurdly underrated, as I like it much better than Breakfast Stout."
"This beer is smooth and thick. The high ABV is detectable, but not overwhelming."
"Drinkability: A couple of these in one night is plenty to warm the bones on a chilly night. A great representation of the style and available without camping out in line."
"I've never been disappointed by a Founders beer and their Imperial Stout keeps the streak alive. Jeff, thanks again."
"Drinkability: In a night of drinking some new and interesting beers, this one stood our for its quality."
"Impressive, definitely could've sat another 3 years and been outstanding."
"D - Tasty"
"Aroma of coffee, caramel, malt, and smoke. Pours a dark black color with a chocolate tan soapy head. Sweet up front, bitters and chocolate on the back end. Very tasty. The smoke is always a turn off for me. But if I get past the smoke, this beer is a very tasty stout."
"I would drink multiples of this, despite not being in my best interest."
"Great tasting beer, but there is much better."
"D - Drinkability is moderate to high. Given the thickness when first pouring, I thought this would've been a mighty sipper, but it drinks much easier than I would've thought due to the high chocolate flavor and creamy body. High ABV and bitterness keeps this from being a day-long beer, and the style reserves itself for a cold, winter night."
"One of the best Imperial Stouts available. Certainly deserving comparisons with Expedition Stout and Ten Fidy as one of the top tier. Tremendously drinkable, outstanding beer."
"I really, really wish Founders were available here."
"Poure from a 12 oz bottle a jet black almost oil appearance with a tight thin tan head. Smells of chocolate cofee and roasted grain. The taste is just what you would expect from an impy stout. Roasted malt bitter up front with a bite of coffee and a smoother roasted malt and chocolate and an alchohol burn to finish. This beer is super smooth and creamy not overly biting and a very balanced carbonation. Drinkability is higher than you would imagine for a 10 percent beer that being said more than a few and you would be swimming."
"drinkability: Founders always right on. great example of a RIS"
"This is probably the best beer I have ever had. Founder's knows what they are doing."
"On tap into a 4oz tulip at Stub & Herbs...Black pour, with not much head or retention...An aroma of all roast, not broken up enough with flavors, needs some sweetness...The taste is all very bitter and roasted coffee. Not bad, just one noted, and a very roasted imp, too much for my liking in this style."
"dark brown color, chocolate head. nice head and very strong lacing. smell and taste are very similar, with a big chocolate profile. Almost no bitterness whatsoever. A hint of coffee as well though not very pronounced. slightly sweet, almost of cherries. mouthfeel is on the medium side and creamy. very drinkable, it has a lighter feel for an RIS, almost like a milk stout. given the ABV this could be a little dangerous as I defintely feel I can have 2-3 of these."
"This particular bottle is a few months shy of being one year old. I've had this one fresh and enjoyed a lot but I'm going to review this one. Pours pitch black with a small dark brown head. Don't know if the pour was off or not but even with the small head it looks good. The smell right off is chocolate. That's really all I get out of it other than some roasted malt. Even though there isn't a lot going on in the smell what is there smells very nice. Like the smell the taste is very chocolatey. Kind of surprising since when I had it fresh it wasn't like this and there was some coffee in both the smell and taste. The mouthfeel is very thick and perfect for the RIS style. No alcohol present which is very nice making this very drinkable with the chocolate taste that is coming out. Overall fresh this one is great but with some time this one gets even better. I'm going to pick more up the next time it comes out, drink a couple fresh and age all the rest."
"Drink: for a 10-percent-plus ABV stout, this is obscenely smooth and drinkable. Great flavor and great balance. Founders knows their way around roasted malt."
"Dark black pour with a small, loose, brown head and good lacing. The aroma is a rich, deep blend of espresso and dark chocolate with notes of lush, ripe dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar and graham cracker. Intense espresso flavor with layers of milk chocolate, bakers chocolate, black strap molasses, brown sugar, caramel, dark fruit, and a healthy dose of spicy, piny hops. The mouthfeel is full and creamy with very gentle carbonation."
"D- This was a good beer from Founders. The ABV is well hidden I thought in this beer but will sneek up on you. I had no problem having a couple bottles of this but had to move onto something a little less in your face both flavor and alcohol wise."
"on a stout kind of day, one bottle might not be enough."
"D: It was a pleasure to drink. There is no way you know this is 10.5% until later."
"D - Full, sweet, thick and oily. This is a sipper for sure, and more than a full bottle would be hard to put down."
"Feel wise, this is thick and smooth with mild carbonation and a finish with alcohol warmth."
"D - About as drinkable as a 10.5% AV stout can be, this is a great example of the style and is absolutely perfect on a cool fall evening. Another great beer from Founders!"
"Founders, you have mastered stout."
"2008 Vintage... Pours like motor oil, jet black body with touches of brown around its edges. Minimal head to speak of, but leaves some little lacing from bubbles on the side. Scent brings strong roast qualities with notes of plum and raisin, chocolate comes through with a whiff of cherry cordrial, coffee present as well as some vinous notes and alcohol is definitely present. Taste manages to duplicate the components of scent very well with the added pinch of spice on the back end. Velvety and creamy body, minimal carbonation, mouth coating but no lingering aftertaste. A top notch RIS that doesnt overpower with boozyness or lack chocolate/coffee notes like others do."
"D: Eight months in the cellar definitely did this one some good. I don't remember the details of two I drank many months ago, but I do know that the beer I just drank was absolutely outstanding. Highly drinkable, with ABV detectability being nill."
"D: Loved this beer, very tasty. Perfect for sitting by the fire while the snow goes down."
"Beer is sweet and mildly roasty without an aftertaste. Lots of coffee flavors, no ash. Medium body, easy drinking, beautiful. Mildly sweet in the front overall very nice. So drinkable, great feeling in the mouth too. I love this beer. Next opportunity I'm buying a case of this."
"Pours a nice ebony color. Notice that there isn't much head. Smells leaves me a bit wanting. There is a hint of roasted chocolate malts, but considering the style of beer I thought there would be a little more smell to it. There is a hint of alcohol on the nose. On the initial swallow the beer coats the tongue nicely, numbs it a little. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The coffee flavor comes out nicely and covers the alcohol very well. There isn't as much retention as I expected. As it warms up, the alcohol becomes a bit more evident and the beer takes a little more of a bitter turn. Overall, a nice beer for a cold winter day."
"D- although it's not a fresh bottle, it has still held up really well; a fresh bottle would probably have a bit more hop bitterness to cut some of the alcohol tingle; at 10.5% and a noticeable 10.5% one in an evening is good for me...I'll definitely be picking up some fresh stuff this winter"
"M/D: It had everything you want in a stout, rich and creamy but not overwhelming. Great beer, this is the same as breakfast stout, if it wasn't for KBS, this would share number 1 with BS for the top beer in founders portfolio. Yum, still taste great even though it's 96 degrees out right now..."
"One of, if not, the best beers I have ever had the chance to drink. Pours out slow and thick. Very black. The smell is of a strong molasses and chocolate mixture. The taste is a three parter. 1 - Heavy coffee flavor 2 - Nice rich malt with hints of coffee and chocolate 3 - Finishes with an awesome blend of chocolate, molasses and java. This is just one of the greatest beers ever!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a tight 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head slowly fades down to an even film of tiny bubbles, and lacing consists of very slow moving foam that wants to rejoin the liquid but hardly has the strength to fall. Aroma is hearty dark malts, coupled with vinous dark fruits and alcohol. Taste is extremely rich dark chocolate and coffee flavors upfront, with the fruit and alcohol coming in on the middle, and closing with an increasingly bitter coffee flavor, and definite warmth. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, although a bit more carbonation wouldn't hurt in my eyes, and drinkability is high in that you want to come back for more, even if the abv means that you come back for more tomorrow."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side and moderately creamy. Carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is very good, it was a great beer to sip on this evening. The chocolate, bitter flavors were particularly nice. Excellent beer overall."
"A very good and underappreciated RIS overall. Should get more hype."
"drinkable ? maybe 2, but no more."
"D: Great an awesome stout."
"HOLY SMOKES! Winter 09-10 vintage. This beer is insane! Pours straight up motor oil black. Some brown bubbles around the edges of the glass. The nose is decadent! Cocoa, espresso, molasses, licorice, vanilla, and booze. Taste is amazing. All of the above as flavors with a touch of hop bitterness to keep it from being too sweet. Flavor is HUGE. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, very smooth. Drinkability is pretty great considering the intensity of the flavors and the abv. This is one of my fav stouts ever. Maybe 6 more months and this would be at it's peak with the alcohol, which has the tiniest harshness left, which is the only ding for me. Amazing surprise considering how unassuming the bottle is and how under-hyped this is."
"This drinks supremely easy, just wish it is available easily in CA so it would become my daily session beer."
"I poured into my glass to a finger of brown head. This beer is black. The head looks pretty thick. This is one sexy looking beer. The aroma is just about every dark scent you can imagine: chocolate, coffee, molasses, licorice, and some alcohol. The taste is alcohol forward at first. As the offering warms up it recedes with the bakers cocoa and coffee coming to the forefront. The taste is slightly bitter, but not too much. The mouthfeel is nice and viscous. This is a beer that I have been eying in the fridge for several months now. It was well worth the wait."
"D - Great flavor and body! Nose is strong and inviting. The only drawback to a beer like this is the higher abv keeping this from being a sessionable taste. Great example of the style!!"
"D- As drinkable as you could ever possibly find in the style. The only reason I'm not immediately cracking another one open this very moment is simply because I haven't anymore in my possesion. If I had alot more sitting around, I fear the sin of gluttony would be a very real possibility!"
"A great price on the Founder's IS too? What more can you ask for. . . well a KBS I guess. Its 'almost' that good, just not as complex."
"Poured black into a stemmed Brooklyn glass, with a thin tan head, no carbonation, and average lacing. Smelled of bittersweet chocolate, raisins, soap, and a big alcohol presence. The taste revealed roasted coffee bean with some dark chocolate, and finishing on a dry coffee note punctuated by the strong alcohol content, which was evident throughout. Not much evident of the dark fruit in the flavor as was detected in the aroma. Very thick, non-carbonated, slick mouthfeel as well. The all-around harshness of the alcohol flavor suggested that this beer warranted a healthy amount of time in the cellar. As such, I'd like to buy another and give it a second chance, but throw it in the basement for three years before drinking it."
"D: So as I said in 09 this was my fav Impy Stout, now I really don't like it. I feel sick to my stomach from it and it is just way too thick and sweet, I can't call this bad because it is probably just me at this time, but goodness, so sweet."
"D. A real treat, a great beer to help wind down and eventful day or as a desert."
"As said above, a dessert beer. I wouldn't drink more than two at a time unless i was really enjoying myself. The strength of character makes one plenty enjoyable."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight dark citrus, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness. Tastes of strong alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, slight hop, and a hint of dark citrus. Overall, a good RIS. Great blend, good body, aroma, and complexity."
"Appears so dark that it absolutely absorbs all degrees of the visible light spectrum, big dark tan head almost a leathery brown thick soft textured head creamy billowing just outright beautiful. Fine speckled lacing dances around the sides of my Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Aroma has earthy herbal hops big loads of dark chocolate notes, something soy sauce about this batch that works into an imperial stout profile, dark fruit hints of anise black licorice. Flavor is full of dark fruit big blast of coffee dark espresso grade strength, creamy dark chocolate bitterness just an aboslute excellent interpretation of an imperial sout. Full bodied stout that coats the palate from every angle the most filling beer around, even smooth carbonation not a cloying bone in this beers body. Supreme being of imperial stout in the world there's really not a better beer out there even compared to KBS, CBS, or Breakfast Stout this beer is the base example of all of those beers."
"Drinkable...hells yeah! This is right up there with all the big boys! Is there a stout from Founders that isn't superb??"
"This is my idea of a great 'standard' RIS."
"D: Great RIS. I will have to stock up on this one when I get the chance."
"Strangely, it took the BS and KBS to lead me to the IS, rather than the other way 'round (I assume that's the more conventional route, anyway). Finally. The pour results in a black soup usually reserved for coating pelicans and other wildlife during ecological disasters, topped by about a finger of burnt sienna froth. I miss crayons... The nose comprises roasted and toasted malts, molasses, chocolate, maple syrup, and a nice hint of vanilla. Yum so far. The taste holds notes of dark, smokey, roasted malts; dark chocolate; a tiny bit o' vanilla; and a slightly surprising hint of bourbon. The body is Kingpin heavy and coats the mouth with thick, chewy goodness. As much as I want to guzzle this beast, the thickness, richness, and relatively high ABV make this an impossible dream (though, like Quixote, that hasn't stopped me yet). Another fine example of tasty darkness from the boyz in Grand Rapids."
"D - As is the case with all Founders brews I've had to date, this is an absolute pleasure to drink."
"The drinkability is below average in my opinion. Its just too bitter, burnt, and dry for me. The alcohol kick at the end of each sip doesnt help either. After a few ounces, I know what this beer is about and dont feel the need to drink anymore"
"Pours very thick and dark with little brown color around the edges (when in the light). VERY little carbonation. I must have expected much more carbonation because of all the Stone IRS I've been having lately. Very strong chocolatey smell to this one. Strong chocolate and sweet sugary scents. Taste strong dark chocolates and black licorice. A bit of hoppy bitterness at the end as well. Sort of a chewy mouthfeel, great for dessert. This is a very rich imperial stout...I could only image having one of these in a single sitting."
"o - decent beer, but too bitter for my taste. I think 1 is all I'd ever want....not very drinkable."
"M/D: Not overly drinkable, but pretty smooth and thick feel."
"After successfully completing a number of trades for KBS and Breakfast stout, it never occurred to me to try and pick up this one. Received as an extra, and luckily so. Pours a deep, midnight black color, topped by nice half inch or so of brown foam, which quickly recedes, becoming a light collar of lace and a few random bubbles. Aromas of good dark chocolate covered espresso beans, dark roast malt and a hint of young port. A little bit more wine on the palate initially, a metallic note, then lots of espresso and dark chocolate with some warming alcohol late. Definitely need to seek some more of this one out."
"D- Very quaffable, given the high ABV."
"D - Drinks extremely nice. Not even a sipper at 10.5 abv. Even though it's summer time I'm going to have to go pick up more of this stuff."
"Regardless of the fact that something about the taste doesn't fully jive with me, this is a really solid Imperial Stout. It's otherwise very impressive. More impressive is how easy of a drinker it is at the aforementioned abv. I would have no reservations about giving it another shot next time around, especially if I found it on draft. Don't let me discourage you from giving a try."
"D_Buy a case."
"It was nice to try this beer, but I definatly prefer Goose Island's Night Stalker or Bell's Expedition over this beer."
"This stout is Chewy, amazing mouth feel. Not as great a mouth feel as KBS but still freaken thick."
"D: Very high. I prefer Old Rasputin and Bell's Expedition, but this is in the next tier of imperial stouts."
"I love this stuff; you people that get this easily are lucky. A tremendous go-to Imperial stout. Maine has awful beer for the most part...I wish breweries like Founders would distribute here. One of the best imperial stouts for sure."
"I love this stout, lots of dark malts, chewy, bitter, hoppy, and overall pretty drinkable. A nice roast, coffee, and chocolate addition as well but not over the top in any. Best of all is the price landing this at about $4 for a 12oz which is much more affordable than most great RIS beers."
"Bottled. Black pour, brown head. Roasted coffee, alcohol, and soy sauce nose. Roasty, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, smoke, and alcohol in the flavor. Bitter finish, slightly astringent. Excellent, but not as ""imperial"" as others in this category. I think their KBS or standard Breakfast Stout are both better, but it is definitely a contest between superlative examples of the genre."
"D - Another exceptional and stellar offering from Founders... An exceptional stout whose mouthfeel and drinkability are off the charts... I will gladly pick up a 4-pk every winter and strongly advise that you do the same... Just stellar all the way around..."
"D- pretty good. I'd def have a couple more without a problem."
"D: An almost too drinkable version of the style, the lack of alcohol combined with the attenuated mouthfeel makes this a very easy drinking beer. Ultimately, this comes across as a ""simple"" version of what the style can be. I am happy to have a couple more in the basement and will probably buy more in the future, but there are better examples of the style out there. Recommended."
"Pours a luscious opaque sable, just a hair above jet black, with a thick and fine-bubbled tan head. Rich aroma is strongly of fine coffee with hints of cocoa and molasses. Flavor is like a good mocha, quality coffee with an undertone of dusty cocoa, a little oily, slightly bitter and just a bit sweet. Texture is smooth and just a little tingly, and has a good bite to it. Recommended to all stouties."
"SkÅL!"
"d - a strong beer that needs to be sipped and enjoyed. There is a lot to offer here. A bit much for me by itself, but goes well with some spicy food."
"A big roasted malt flavor with notes of bitter chocolate, mellow cocoa, smoke, there's also a charred taste too. The hops show up much bigger in the taste with a significant bitter herbal hop edge showing up in the middle of the flavor and riding through the after taste. The mouth feel is thick and very heavy. This is good but has too much of a hop flavor to shine as a really tasty stout to me...Not quite complex enough in the malt.A very well made beer but not my favourite stout by any means."
"Overall, this is a really, really nice imperial stout. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for with wonderful smoothness and flavor. Another great creation from Founders."
"Overall, other than the mouthfeel this is a middle of the road imperial stout. I think the alcohol presence is just too much. I remember the first time I first drank this beer about a year ago and it smelled like Minwax."
"D: Great. I'd order another and buy again."
"This is a very good and solid stout! How does Founders keep making great beers-and stouts for that matter. All taste different, yet similar at the same time. This one is huge with the coffee notes. Very smooth and thick, malty mouthfeel. Not a great fridge temp beer...definitely let this one get a little warmer. Wow...as I continue to drink, velvety smooth. As the temp goes up on this beer...so does the booze in the mouthfeel. In the end...very good stout from Founders!"
"Wow, this is a great imperial stout plain and simple. I can't believe I haven't bothered to check this one out sooner. Shame on me. I won't make the mistake a second time."
"O: Overall I enjoyed this new bottle very much. I'm excited to age a few and kick up the vinous notes quite a bit. It only gets better from here, now the only debate is whether to buy more..."
"D-Very drinkable for a 10%+ RIS. No really noticeable heat. Flavors are very balanced for such a young vintage."
"Pretty awesome flavour is simple, but well-executed. Huge chocolate throughout, some dark fruit, coffee and vanilla. Drinks like a regular stout, but with the amped up flavours of an imperial. Rich creamy body adds an extra layer of luxury. Not as roasty or bitter as some, but luxurious and as chocolaty as anything I've come across."
"D: Very flavorful and enjoyable, but with all RIS's...one or two is plenty. Very drinkable nonetheless, yet on a Sunday night one is enough."
"Paired nicely with my chocolate dessert, would gladly drink this again!"
"--Had this one again recently and it is incredible. It really is one of the best non-BA RIS's out there as far as I'm concerned. The depth of flavor paired with the classic taste and feel is just superb. I wish they would put this in some kind of barrel and bottle it."
"I will definitely buy this stout over and over again. incredible!"
"D - High ABV is well hidden, and this is very nicely balanced; appropriately sweet but not overly so. This is definitely a sipper, but thoroughly enjoyable to drink"
"Overall I wanted a couple more flavors to come out of this Stout but it was worthy of trying once."
"Drinkability: Typically bitterness + high ABV = sipper, but it's not the case with this brew. The delicious sweetness up front affords some great drinkability, but you'd be wise to enjoy this one slowly. Finishes a little too syrupy for my liking - the last few sips are tough to get through."
"A total knockout from the one the finest breweries in the world. Seriously good stuff."
"Overall, my least favorite from the Founders portfolio of beers I've sampled thus far."
"this beer is quite drinkable for being so strong and rich, bit i couldn't see anyone having more than 2 of these at any given time. fits the style perfectly, and is yet another star in the founders lineup."
"D: a sipper that might improve with cellaring time."
"The Founders Imperial Stout pours a deep chocolate color with a tan head that only pops up after an aggressive pour. Not much lacing or retention to note. Aromas are mostly burnt coffee with a subtle chocolate presence. I'm not picking up any of the 10% abv in the nose. Quaff is sweet licorice with a bitter chocolate finish. Odd that I am not getting consistency with the nose and quaff as I do not notice any espresso or coffee beans in the quaff, or at least nothing like the nose. Mouthfeel is nice and thick like a stout should be. Drinkability is solid for this style mostly in comparison to the high price tag that comes with an Imperial stout."
"Notes - A solid RIS that I will cellar. This one was served at 53.5 degrees."
"D: Another great beer from Founders. Not quite an elite Imperial Stout, but still a really good one."
"I enjoyed this Founders offering much more than either the Breakfast Stout or KBS. A."
"Very drinkable for the high abv."
"Pours pitch black with a light brown creamy head that leaves some drippy bits of lace behind. Heavy, rich aromas of sweet dark chocolate, boozy vinous fruits, and a fair amount of black strap molasses. First sip is a big, chewy mouthful of semi-sweet chocolate, roasted black malt, and a subtle fruity tartness. Delicious and satisfying. Bitter in the finish, but rather silky-smooth as a whole. Rich and creamy and dangerously drinkable. I mean, it feels like a ""big"" beer, but there isn't hardly any hint of the high ABV. Full, smooth, textured...damn tasty."
"Drinkability is pretty good. But man, this is a beast. A bit overly bitter in my opinion, this one could definitely use a couple of years of cellar time to smooth this out a bit. It's still quite tasty, but it's a bit rough around the edges."
"Worth a try for sure. I'm grateful for the opportunity from one of my trading partners."
"Poured from a growler after visiting the brewery on the KBS release day. The beer pours as dark as oil with a 1/2 inch head that remains throughout. Also, it has good lacing even though my glass wasn't cleaned properly. The taste is dark chocolate and coffee. The alcohol is pretty well hidden and the aftertaste is not bad. Overall, it's another good offering from Founders, but not one of my favorites."
"I purchased my 12 oz bottle for $4.50 at Pinnochio's Beer Garden in Media, PA. It's worth noting, as I probably will be with every single Founders review, how much I appreciate the 12 oz bottles when compared with bomber-obsessed breweries - it's a lot nicer to spend a bit less to try a beer but still get plenty of it to enjoy - and to have a 4 pack available if you do love it."
"Overall this is a very very good stout. Has become one of may favorite imperial stouts on the market. Have one in the cellar and will see what we have in a year or so."
"D - As much as I would like to drink this all night, it packs quite a punch at 10.5%. The flavors are awesome, and the mouthfeel is perfect. An absolutely great stout."
"D - great imperial stout, only thing lacking ere is a bit of grace as all the flavors just fight out over who gets attention. this one should age and mellow quite nicely, which ill have to do given the great price and availability of fantastic RIS."
"Very drinkable for the style and strength. This is not a style of beer I could ever drink a lot of at one time, but this one goes down pretty smoothly. The alcohol is fairly well hidden, so may sneak up on you. Great beer for a cold night, this will warm you up quite well."
"Notes: Another solid offering from Founders, not tremendously outstanding or complex but does offer enough range for a rather pleasing RIS. Slight disappointment while having it at room temperature and not unfolding a promised complexity."
"The lightest mouth feel of any stout like whip cream making me want drink after drink."
"This is a very drinkable stout."
"D-Very smooth overall. Has a bit of an alcohol kick so you'll get your buzz goin."
"D - Not very drinkable. I'd have a hard time drinking two of these. Every sip is kind of a bitch going down. It's a good beer, but not great. Would be better at like 8% ABV instead of 10.5. Don't think I'd get it again when there so many other great imperials out there."
"This is an excellent RIS. One of the best I remember tasting since Old Rasputin. Highly recommended."
"Another great beer from Founders, they never seem to disappoint."
"D - Very enjoyable imperial stout. Hoppier than most other examples (which is a strong positive for me), plenty of dark and roasty flavors and an incredible smoothness to it. The 10.5% alcohol is more noticeable in the nose than the taste. Doesn't seem that strong. Will definitely be grabbing more of this before its gone for the season."
"D: Big beer. Heavy malts character well balanced by hops, chocolate, and alcohol. The beer doesn't cover the alcohol, but it makes it taste delightful."
"D - I would drink this again and again. Can't wait to see it cheaper like the rest of the world since it's 4.25 a bottle here. I would gladly pay 10 dollar for a four pack and have no problems saving a couple."
"When it comes to stouts, Founders seems to have the magic touch. Big and bold, as one would expect, with well-moderated roasted malt flavor and a nice hoppy punch at the end. ETOH lends a touch of pepper at the finish. Stays true to the style while at the same time offering some of the complexity that is customary for Founders."
"D: One of the easiest drinking 10+ % beers out there. Highly recommended."
"D - Dangerously easy to drink. Clocking in at 10.5% you could easily find yourself a bit tipsy while enjoying this one."
"Pours black in color with more than a finger of severely dark tan head. You can fire up the high beams on this guy and no light is shining through. Fair retension and a decent amount of lace clings to the glassware. Aroma includes hops, coffee, chocolate and alcohol. Taste is bitter upfront from a combo of hops and burnt grain. Body of the beer includes the taste of burnt grains, bitter chocolate, strong black coffee and alcohol. The alcohol plays an interesting role with balancing out the different tastes this beer has to offer and strangely enough doesnt have much ""warming"" factor. Feel of this beer is thick with moderate carb. Overall quite good."
"Overall I this is yet another wonderful and well-crafted Imperial Stout from Founders. Great depth of flavor and perfectly thick and creamy. Highly Recommended."
"via duffextracold"
"D: Definitely a short session beer. It was a meal and a dessert in one ha! Not to mention the 10.50% ABV. A great treat though."
"The beer pours a big time black color with a 1/4"" brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a killer black malt bitterness up front as well as some warmth and a bit of chocolate malt sweetness. The taste is great also. It has a rich, earthy, black malt flavor that goes down extremely smooth with a bit of warmth in the finish. It is bitter with a ton of roasted barley. Wow, this is a smooth beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very well brewed IS. It's simplistic, but full flavored and damn enjoyable."
"A beer you will remember"
"I've always liked Founders and the Imperial Stout certainly hasn't changed that. The breakfast stouts get all of the hype, but this is the real deal. Grab one if you get the opportunity."
"93/100"
"D - Really sweet with high alocohol. Would be really difficult for me to have more than one. I would've liked to have a bit more roasted malt prominence and a bit more earthy hop. Still very good."
"D- Highly drinkable, despite the 10% ABV, looking forward to my next go at this."
"Pretty much my go to IS when it is around, I really do not think it gets much better than this, so balanced and delicious."
"M/D- Full bodied with a great moutfeel, silky smooth. finish lingers for a while. (could prolly drink a whole bud light and still taste this stout!). Very drinkable which is dangerous with the ABV, def one to share with a few friends."
"Pours a jet black with tight tan foam that leaves a good bit of creamy lace. Lots of big strong aromas of espresso and dark chocolate with some alcohol sweetness. Huge rich flavors rush in from every angle. The is silky smooth and slighty slick body with gentle carbonation usher in tons of chocolate covered espresso beans in the flavor. There's also a soft warming from the alcohol and a subtle fruitiness that round out the complex combination of flavors. The finish is a lasting bitterness much like a piece of ultra-dark chocolate. At 90 IBUs, I thought there might be a bit more hop character, but the bitterness is manifested in the roasty espresso and dark chocolate notes. This beer is incredibly delicious and every sip shows me something new with this one. Really quite outstanding. Bravo!"
"Well done and my compliments to the brewers."
"D - this could be an all-nighter. I would buy a case."
"pours dark, rich mahogany. leather bound books. Dark head with good lace. why did i always ignore this beer? i feel foolish, perhaps because breakfast stout is so good. smells of roasted malt, toffee, and a beautiful chocolate syrup like quality. made my buddy say 'oh jenny' in a forest gump voice, sums that up. alcohol is present, but welcomed. Thick as molasses, but i can't get over that smell! can't get any better. heavy and harsh. the taste lingers and lasts in memory, like the first time i saw the mighty ducks. what a movie. what a beer."
"Poured from the bottle like used motor oil, thick, viscous and shiny black. A coffee colored head of dense foam emerges after the pour and leaves fine brown sugar lace on the glass. The nose is dark fudge and anise with a whiff of alcohol. The flavors of chocolate malt and coffee hit up front and are followed with a big hit of anise and charred sugar. Hop bitterness finishes the ride nicely. The flavors of this beer are truly appreciated and grow more intense and complex as it warms up with black strap molasses and fruity hop bittering becoming more prevalent. Full bodied and silky smooth. One great RIS that isn't $10+ a bomber."
"D- some tasty stuff that is well worth the price I paid. I'd definitely pick up another 4pk if I see it again. I could certainly have another but this is one to save and keep around as long as possible."
"4.0 D: Pretty good, but one glass is enough."
"D-given the style and the high ABV this brew goes down well. Certainly not a session beer but it wasn't intended to be one. I could drink more than 1."
"This is another great beer from Founders. Nice dark chocolate flavor, thick feel, hides the booze well. Definitely worth seeking out!"
"D-VERY tasty imperial stout. Thumbs up for this one. Smooth, deceivingly easy to drink. I want some more right now :D"
"D: excellent. I could easily consume several of these and regret it in the morning. This was a really nice imperial stout."
"Overall a great RIS. This one deserves to be talked about more. Unfortunately the other big beers at Founders garner most of the accolades."
"Drinkability was good. Overall this beer is a sipper but rather complex and deserves to be savored. Disappointed that head died so fast and didnt add any creaminess. Good stout, better than KBS but would prefer the regular Breakfast Stout"
"I don't know what to say about this beer. I thought Founders had exhausted all of their stout powers with the Breakfast lineup...I was gladly mistaken!"
"Pours slow and an inky opaque black color topped with a thin and lacy brown head. The nose is big and bold with roasted coffee aromas. The boldness of is continued into the taste with a huge thick body and very low carbonation. Sweet roasted coffee malts and subtle toffee/chocolate notes. No hop presence in the taste but it is a well balanced brew. The finish is long and sweet as the coffee character fades away and the sweetness comes out. As the brew slowly lingers and fades away and ends with a touch of warming alcohol."
"D: Drinkability is low on this one, though still good for the style. Maybe I'm just not feeling it very much tonight, but I'm barely through any of it and am already getting a bit frustrated. Definitely not Founders' best, though usually I'm so impressed with Founders beers that this isn't really all that negative of a comment."
"Overall i think i may just not be ready for a beer like this. This was pretty aggressive on the palate. I'm fairly new into the craft beer scene (been about a year or so now) and am still trying to learn to critique my beers more analytically. I've never been super fond of stouts....but this one seems a bit much. Perhaps it's simply be ahead of my league given its high praise on BA."
"Mouthfeel was velvety and full bodied. Rich and creamy."
"Drinkability - forget it i could drink these until they destroy me. very drinkable. very smooth i recommend only having one with dessert!!"
"12oz. bottle served in a snifter. Bottle conditioned. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of tan head that quickly dissipates. Roasted barley, hops and a bit of alcohol in the aroma. More roasty barley in the flavor. The alcohol in the aroma doesn't come through in the flavor. Big rich body. Fair amount of hop bitterness. Long dry finish of chocolate malt. Solid beer."
"Twelve ounce bottle poured into a snifter. Pours pitch black. Beautiful...about as dark as you can get. Pour gave way to a small coffee colored head that quickly dissipates. This beer has a wonderful nose to it. Smells of roasted malts and coffee beans. Chocolate as well. Burnt sugar. Alcohol is there as well. The taste is not a letdown. Tastes just as good as it smells, maybe ever better. Tastes of roasted malts and espresso. Black coffee. Caramel and some kind of sugary sweetness. Vanilla extract maybe? The flavor really starts to come out as the beer warms. Slight hops at the end give the beer a nice balance. This is a very bold beer with intense aromas and flavors. The body is there to match both, very heavy and creamy with low carbonation. The alcohol is present but not overbearing. This would go very nicely with a decadent dessert. Very glad to have had the opportunity to try this one, so thanks Ed!"
"a great RIS. definitely worth picking up. i'll definitely be putting two of these away for a year or two."
"A high ABV lowers the drinkability just a bit,but otherwise a fantastic brew, great with a hearty meal or just to sip, especially on a cold winter night."
"This seemed like a less bold, more balanced version of Founder's Breakfast Stout. Reminded me of Ten Fidy in many ways."
"Mouthfeel is very rich, full-bodied but not overly so, leaving it quite drinkable for a big imperial stout. Excellent overall."
"Best in Show stuff. Brilliant."
"D - Not very drinkable, would not seek out again. If I'm having a beer sandwich, its gotta be worth it!"
"Drinkability: Even with the 10% ABV this is has a far superior drinkability than most beers at that ABV."
"Wow! This beer pours black as night. There was a mocha colored 2 finger head with an aggressive pour that lasted quite a while. A thin layer of head lasted for the entire time i spent drinking this, which was about 45 minutes. There was also alot of lacing that stayed the entire time. The smell is super malty and roasted with notes of bitter chocolate and molasses. The taste is very malty, roasted, and sweet on the front end. On the back end it is hoppy with notes of bitter chocolate. HUGE rich roasted flavors. The beer is full bodied and thick. The mouthfeel is silky and creamy with perfect carbonation for this style. You would never know this was 10.5 percent abv if it din't say so on the bottle. The alcohol did come out a little more as it warmed up. This is a excellent beer;)"
"Black, that is a bit of an understatement when describing the appearance. The mocha colored head did not form big or last long. Spotty lacing is left on the glass. The alcohol plays too large a part in the aroma and really takes away from what could be some excellant malt notes. I am able to pick up some chocolate, espresso, and anise. Nice malt flavor until the alcohol flavor takes over. The malt flavor is more of a roasted character. Thick body with nice carbonation. Texture is smooth and silky. Maybe with some age on this, I would enjoy it more. Reminds me of Expidition Stout with its hot alcohol aspect."
"This is a chewy stout, full bodied, and perfectly carbonated. Silky and smooth. A pleasure to drink. If I had to make one criticism, it would be that this beer should be available year round."
"D: one of the best RISs out there. This is a must have for any fan of the style, and is worth seeking out."
"Consumed on 1/17/2010"
"hearty and coating. i was eating chips 'n salsa and it successfully put out the fire (despite the incumbent heat, which i should say is well disguised)"
"One of the strangest pours I have ever seen! Poured out like a carton of motor oil and it appeared as if there was no hope for the formation of a head. After a very aggressive pour of the whole bottle into my snifter the head came out of nowhere and formed to the size of about one finger. The rising head from inside the opaque beer looked magical after such a strange pour. The head retains pretty well at about half to one finger and is a beautiful, VERY dark almost coffee bean color. A blanket of this head stays afloat on the beer for the reminder of the time. The lacing makes a cream around the glass as the head dies down. The nose on this one is good but very aggressive. I can smell alcohol vapors right of the top of the beer. The main components are, as expected, roasted malts, cocoa and some coffee notes. These are most likely from the malts. I can not pick up any hops in the aroma. The nose is of good strength and represents an Imperial Stout well. Finally to the taste. This beer is huge! Roasted malts and cocoa notes demolish my taste buds and are backed by earthy RIS-like hops very well. The hops help to balance the flavor but do not take over the malts, something I like in an RIS. The coffee is faint but I get hints of it (maybe just from similar roasty flavors). Alcohol is not as present in the flavor as I expected it to be from the aroma. The more I drink this beer, a bunch of times now, it really has one of the best non-specialty RIS flavors. The mouthfeel is amazing. This is the thickest beer I have ever had and it feels so good. It is almost milkshake thick with low RIS-like carbonation. The tongue is left with a blast of roast and earthy hop flavors, very nice. A tiny bit of warming leaves my mouth in heaven. Drinkability is great because of the taste and price for such a big beer. The downside is that this is definitely not sessionable, I would like to enjoy this one bottle at a time and hopefully on tap sometime. Great example of an RIS and one of my new favorites by Founders."
"Excellent stout. This is probably tied with ten fidy as my favorite imperial russian stout."
"Fantastic."
"Pours super thick and black, produces a very dark brown frothy head that doesn't last too long but leaves great lacing, I think I poured it too carefully. Smells are roasted malts, a bit of cocoa, coffee, licorice, and some booze. Taste is excellent, pure RIS... big on the roastiness, subtle coffee and dark chocolate. A bit of vanilla in the aftertaste. Alcohol is there but doesn't get in the way at all. Mouthfeel is great, definitely a stout you can ""chew"" which I love. For a 10.5 abv this is very drinkable, and the price is excellent. I only bought a single bottle which I sort of regret now, I will buy the 4-pack if I see it again."
"Beer pours with a monstrous tan head atop a pitch black motor-oil body. Lacing is amazing. The head reduces to a cocoa froth. The beer smells like alcohol, being that it is 10.5 percent. Chocolate, grains, and malts in the nose and in the smell. A bit of vanilla and alcoholic bite. This is by one of the best RIS I've had, a good example of the style. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and feels chocolaty. The alcohol puts my tongue in a sleeper-hold. Drinkability is medium. Great beer."
"D - A very nice winter sipper. I'll be buying more so that a couple bottles actually stand a chance to be left alone in the cellar."
"D - at first I thought this was all burnt malt / coffee. I let it warm and it turned out to be a very good RIS. I had the first of my four bottles the other week and remembered it being about as good as this one was. This is very solid, nothing ground shaking, but nothing mediocre. Yet another solid brew in Founders repertoire."
"D - This is a pretty good RIS. No surprise that Founders has yet another great beer in their lineup."
"Full bodied, bitter roasted malt finish. I like it. I like this uber imperial stout flavor without all the flavor additions of their other imperial stouts. You kids are on crack."
"If you like Russian Imperial Stouts you will not be disappointed with this."
"Pours black with a brown head. The aroma is a mix of smoke and roasted malt. The flavor is more of the same with smoke and malt as well as some coffee and possibly some vanilla. Thicker mouthfeel and lower carbonation. A very good imperial stout but in my opinion not as good as some of the top level beers in this category."
"D: An awesome RIS, one of the better ones I've had, actually. The alcohol is pretty much non-existent and the flavors are absolutely amazing and epitomize an RIS."
"Very drinkable beer, a must have for all beer lovers."
"This is a hoss and a sipper for sure. I'll be putting a 4-pack of it in my cellar shortly."
"Dug this a lot. Very good beer."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is like a thin chocolate milkshake, coats the mouth and goes down smooth. This is as drinkable as an imperial stout gets, but certainly a one sip at a time beer."
"D: Goes down pretty smooth and a whole bottle is no problem."
"As a former student who lived in Kalamazoo for years it pains me to say that the RIS from the northern half of highway 131 challenges the reign of Bell's Expedition stout as the king of Michigan stouts, but the southern half of 131 still reins as king, if only barely."
"The mouthfeel does it for this beer. Very smooth with enough carbonation to soften the strength of this beer making very pleaseing to drink. No strong bitter over the top dry bean aftertaste. Just good stout imperial goodness."
"Drinks great here. Very smooth, little booze, and high ABV, just what I like."
"Drinkability- Decently drinkable though I truely was not ultra blown away by this stout by any means, just lacking that little something special that makes you really love a great stout, a good beer but not great"
"black as midnight with a big brown head that surpsingly laces quite well. the smell is very chocolately, lots of malt and especiallyi coffee dominate the nose. the taste is just incredible, one of the best stouts i've ever had, even has a slight sweet flavor to it, just an all around incredible beer. one of the few 5.0's i've given"
"All-around excellent."
"Pours an beautiful black with a brown head that hung out a bit longer than I would have guessed. Excellent looking impying stout. Nose is full of big roasted malt aroma and a hint of molasses. Taste is big and roasty, excellent impy stout flavor. After having the breakfast stout so many times, its nice to have something without all the coffee in it. Probably not going to session this but its not hard to finish. I had this side by side with some other impy stouts that had a bit more of a hop profile but this was very tasty and well made, I'd buy it again."
"D: Along with other stouts or high gravity beers in general, this brew isn't among the elite however for an imp stout this is a good one to have a handful in a sitting."
"Drinkability:Very drinkable considering the style, and ABV of this brew. The very mild warmth and creamy body make this thing just slide down. Enough complexity to keep me sipping. I highly recommend trying this one."
"Perfect beer, highly recommend."
"this beer might not have the drinkability of FBS or KBS but this is a much better stout then those 2"
"Overall, a pretty solid beer and it reminded me a lot of expedition. Very solid and I can't wait to age my bottles. A very well done imp stout. Worth a try."
"D- This one is great as a winter sipper. One could last you a good part of the evening. I do enjoy them this part of the year for sure."
"Finally in Michigan at the right time to grab this one. Pitch black beer with a small head that doesn't do much in the way of lacing. Really a huge flavor and aroma. When it's chilly, it's strong and straightforward on the roasted malt. As it warms up though, you get all kinds of other flavors - sweet dried fruit and raisins in particular, some cherries. Big chocolate, roasted malt. Monster hoppy presence as well, especially in the back of the mouth. Going to drink another and then put a couple down."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Right from the start, this beer's texture in the mouth goes from excellent to superb... whether it's a few seconds or a full minute, the slickness and overall mouthfeel just keeps improving. Not my favorite example of the style, but a worthy competitor."
"Poured into my glass in an inky black stream with a nice dark tan head that lasted a bit. First smell is coffee followed by chocolate and toasted malts. Nice big malty taste, a bit of chocolate and finished with a coffee undertone. The alcohol isn't exactly up front but it is definitely there. Nice and thick almost velvety to the tongue. I could definitely finish a few of these in a night but it would be a pretty long and enjoyable night."
"Had this on tap at Stub n Herb's. Dark brown/black in the glass, left fabulous lacing all the way down the goblet. Nice warms, roasty aroma, some caramel, chocolate and light booze. Flavor is nice balance between sweet caramel and bitter roastiness. Full bodied, viscous. Yum. This went wonderfully with Stub's Blue Balls (mini cheeseburgers stuffed with blue cheese and topped with grilled onions). Excellent beer, and surprised it took me this long to try it."
"Drinkability: Another great beer from Founders, although not one of my favorites by them since so many of their beers are just exceptional. Not one of my absolute favorite RIS either (Yeti, Darkness, Storm King, Old Rasputin), but still very, very good."
"Poured vigorously into a pint glass, might be the best looking Imp. Stout I've come across. Huge, lasting, tan head, leaving sea foam traces on side. Good smell - coffee, toasted malts, dark fruit - but not amazing. Interesting taste - not overpowering, perhaps unique, but overly focused - coffee, bitter walnut, chocolate, vanilla. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel. This and a restrained use of hops leads to a solid drinkability for the style. Overall a unique American Imperial Stout - especially for the feel and appearance and the really interesting nutty quality in the taste."
"D: Another winner from Founders. I think I might like it a bit better with some age on it, though."
"Pours an opaque blackwith very little milkshake colored head.Smell is slightly of coffee with a lot of malt and a hint of something botanical. Perhaps hops. The taste is initially less complex with the smell. Primarily tasting of coffee, with a heavy licorice after taste. Not nearly as sweet as I'd hoped and very very boozy towards the end. Perhaps should be left to cellar for some time as it tastes a little raw, like it needs to mellow a bit. For my money I'd rather have KBS, Breakfast Stout, Backwoods Bastard, or really most of their other beers. Too much licorice for me."
"D: This MONSTER is to be treasured and respected! Sip this beast with love and care. Another delicious offering from Founders, wonderful Imperial Stout; if you love Imperial Stouts this is a must!"
"Another very pleasant offerring from Founders. Can they do no wrong?"
"D: Definitely something I would buy again. Nice tasting and appropriate for the style. And Alanna says: 'Very good for me, and I don't really do stouts' So I guess that sums it up from me, and my guest reviewer: Alanna."
"D: This brew is quite drinkable, but one that I would consume as a nightcap on a cold evening like this one."
"All in all, this is a great brew if you like it very boozy and hoppy. If that's you, you would love this one. Otherwise, age befoe you try this."
"Although the flavor is very rich, drinkability is great. I'll definitely be picking up some more of these this winter."
"Pretty much the same as the bottled version. If anything I notice a much larger hoppy presence in the general flavour, but this is almost evened out by the added chocolate flavour. body isnt as thick as I remember it, but the presentation and look of the brew is exceptional; the head is incredibly thick and lovely."
"I'm not really big on combining beers, but somehow, I feel compelled to mix this half and half with Bigfoot barleywine. Unfortunately, I don't have any Bigfoot around or I'd do it tonight. I will let you know how it was when I do."
"This ranks up there with the best of them in this category."
"D- The lingering taste of alcohol in this beer is the only real thing detracting from the drinkability. If you look past that and understand it is something to be expected out of a bigger beer, then this beer will be one you keep reaching for."
"Drinkability: Moderate - love the strong and robust flavors and the smells to match; like a meal unto itself; too heavy and the ABV is too high for too much of it; I think this would have to be amazing with some age on it and I'm considering starting a vertical."
"This thing is a sipper from start to finish. A very tasty and complex beer that really packs a punch. I plan to age a couple bottles and see what happens when the hops mellow out."
"Easily drinkable, but I'd suggest doing so at a relatively slow pace, given that there's nothing small about this beer, especially if you're working on a bomber."
"This is just a straight forward, nothing fancy RIS and it's done to near perfection. For the price, I can't think of a RIS that is of higher quality. Not real shocking from the same brewery as KBS and Breakfast Stout. Great RIS."
"Drink ability - too easy to drink, but watch it I'm on number 2 and I'm feeling it."
"As far as readily-available seasonal Impy Stouts go, Founders Imperial Stout is every bit the beer that Bell's Expedition Stout is. Do yourself the favor of buying a four-pack of this while you still can. I was expecting a solid stout but I didn't expect something as delicious as this. A treat."
"D - Quite an exceptional example of style with in your face flavors. This one was almost a year old I think, so hopefully it's as good as this one was when it's fresh."
"incredibly rich mouthfeel,just super thick.i almost have to scrape my tongue off after each sip.great beer."
"Overall, this is a solid Imperial Stout...one I've grown quite fond of. I'm glad this has been put back into Founders's rotation. It has some excellent flavor, and great body."
"The fire is roaring, this stout is making the night better for sure. A chocolate blanket of perfection."
"Kudos to Founders for this rendition of a RIS."
"I have to add that I'm a bit of a Founders fan-boy, as they are without-a-doubt my favorite brewery. Regardless, I feel they've earned my love by producing some of the finest beers in the world. The Imperial Stout is absolutely no exception."
"This beer is one of the most drinkable for the style that I've had due to a lack of fusel alcohols or flaws."
"Overall, another great beer from Founders. When this hits Minnesota, I'm definitely getting more of this. It's not a world class Imperial Stout, but it's definitely a good one, and one that I will be drinking a lot more of."
"Overall impression: Incredibly good imperial stout (much superior to their Breakfast Stout and KBS, IMO). I'm stoked that Founders distributes to SC and I can get this more often now."
"D - While I certainly enjoy this beer, I had hoped that there would be a bit more complexity considering some of founders other seasonal offerings."
"D: Easy drinking. A clean imperial stout."
"Great everyday imperial stout."
"Full, creamy body is well carbonated. Another fantastic stout from Founders."
"Flavor starts out very black coffee-like with dry woody roast and progresses to be floral, leafy, and hoppy in midpalate before settling down to be dry, powdery, and slightly alcoholic in the finish. Soft carbonation pairs with roasted woody bite and alcohol to create a punchy mouthfeel. Lots of chocolate and coffee, some burnt character. Mild sweetness is creamy and milk-like. Smooth creamy body - the soft carbonation creams it up nicely in the mouth. Tastes good. Feels fantastic. Good drinkability."
"The drinkability is pretty strong as well, easy drinking...not my favorite, but definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability is great for the amount of alcohol. All in all it goes down smooth and is quite enjoyable. I probably wouldn't want more than one at a time however as I feel it would better be enjoyed in moderation. Something you sip and savor."
"Bottle. Pours jet black. Definately has the similiar roasted malt taste like the other stouts I have had. For the most part, its pretty easy to drink. The alc.% warmth tingles the tongue just a touch, but it doesn't take away from how smooth this is. Pretty damn decent drink, and easy to drink considering its plus 10% alc. Solid beverage. I actually liked it more then the Breakfast Stout."
"Not much head and when it disappeared it didn't leave much lace. This Stout seemed to have a pronounced bourbon character to it along with the roasted barley, chocolate/black malts and espresso and bitter chocolate character. The flavors where there and the taste impressive but this one lacked a great mouthfeel. Chewy and semi-thick but felt a little thin compared to other examples."
"D- It was tasty, though I don't think I could drink alot of it... I'd much rather be drinking the BS"
"There seemed like something was missing...Perhaps it was the 90IBUs that overdid it...Will try again, but this one was a little disappointing"
"D: Not as sweet as some other RIS's but one of the most deep bodied I've ever had. A unique combination and one that doesn't really work for me. This one is enjoyable, but its still one and done."
"The taste was rather good. Nice blend of flavors. I thought that there may be a little too much carbonation, but that could be a result of the alcohol. I personally didn't appreciate the bitterness at the end, or the lack of a body."
"Founders Imp. Stout is rich, complex, and true to style. Nice."
"Overall, I'm a bit surprised this beer doesn't get talked about more. A very solid imperial stout."
"This is a great RIS. Tons of big, traditional style flavors and aromas, easy to drink, no unappealing alcohol bite, excellent all around."
"Overall: crossed off my list"
"I could drink a lot of of this Impy Stout. Too bad I can't get my hands on Founders here in SoCal."
"J"
"mouthfeel is slightly thinner than desired from an imperial stout, but the drinkability is great."
"Pours like oil and a three finger brown head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Pure black color no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Almost a caramel nose. Flavor is smokey caramel. Mild bitter aftertaste. High ABV totally hidden. Nice IS. $3.50 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Two years later, the actual last beer from this same four pack is amazing. Soft and smooth with a bit of oxidation. Pretty awesome."
"D: Easy to drink, especialy for an imperial."
"overall top notch another nice one from founders...i constantly impressed by those folks...one of my favorite ris"
"This is not my favorite Imperial Stout... this is my first Founders Brew, so I'm curious ... I'm up for more."
"Lots of roast in this one: dark chocolate-covered coffee beans and caramel malts slowly burnt to a delicious crisp. Mocha-rich booze and black patent malts square off with some earthy hops on the finish, although I do remember the hops being much more prominent in a fresher bottle I had a while back. Raisin and candied fig show up as the beer warms, and I can still taste the coffee and cocoa minutes after each sip. Medium-thick, luxurious mouthfeel with a sticky, boozy finish...could stand to be a bit creamier, but that's a minor knock. Besides, the lowered viscosity provides a boost in the drinkability. All in all, a superb Russian Imperial by the abnormally consistent Founders Brewing team. Cheers!"
"This is another great one from Founders. It has the perfect level of roasted malt to sweet malt combined with all of the hops to help make it a very tasty beer. Would gladly have this one again."
"D: A very easy drinking RIS. The ABV dampens the sessionability of the brew but a couple glasses wouldn't be a chore."
"D - Founders hits a home run with this one. If it wasn't 10.5%, I'd session it again and again. A perfect ""one and done"" nightcap brew, since your tastebuds will be done after a bottle of this."
"For a RIS over 10%, this is among the best in terms of drinkability. Highly recommended."
"Pour an opaque darkness with a fairly shallow dark brown foamy head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is amazing! Rich sweet Tootsie Roll-like milk chocolate. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and ultra creamy with a solid coating character, almost oily, helping the roasted coffee note linger really nicely. Full flavored, the choco-latte taste is world class. No way that i'd guess any where near 10.5% ABV!! An amazing beverage! The sight of the bottom of the glass brought a tear to my eye. Highly recommended."
"Plain and simple; buy a bunch of these, drink one or two now and save the rest for 2+ years. By then, this will rock your socks off!"
"12 oz bottle into a Duvel tullip. Pours completely black with a nice brownish tan head. Smells like coffee and alcohol. Taste is very rich and warm. Tons of complexity and depth, yet well balanced. So many flavors its hard to separate them. Esspresso roast coffee with a bit of chocolate and alcohol and a hint of smokiness. Rich creamy mouth feel. Another great stout from Founders. This brewery fast becoming a favorite of mine."
"Poured from glass into a snifter. Dark as night with a mocha colored head. Good head and some retention and lacing. Looks like a good stout. Smell is rich of chocolate (not too sweet), coffee, and burnt grain. A touch of alcohol as well. Taste is similar. A very creamy dark chocolate with a little coffee and toasted grain tastes as well. Alcohol is suprisingly well hidden. Mouthfeel is thick and full, but very smooth. A great beer. One of the smoother RIS's I've had in a while. Enjoy warmer and slowyly, the ABV is well hidden and can catch up with you."
"pours absolutely black with a tan head, but even with a jhard pour i can only generate about a 1/2 inch of head. Some lacing as well. The aroma has lots of licorice, some chocolate, and a touch of espresso. Rich flavors that are seemlessly integrated and very smooth and silky in the mouth. Nice flavors of licorice, chocolate, fresh cream, and some lovely roastiness. I love the superb silky, creamy mouthfeel. This one is a winner. Maybe the creamiest of all the RIS."
"D and overall impression: At 10.5% ABV this one's a sipper. Overall, this is a very good beer, I'm just not blown away with it. There is not much originality here. One par with the style, I just wanted more. Maybe a little age would do this one some good. Skal."
"I'm drinking one of two remaining bottles of the Jan 2009. Still hoppy and bitter, not as aromatic as when fresh. Tons of roast, a nice char, no real oxidation (no dark fruit) despite being a screw top. A little bit of stale coffee, a little cream. Palate has a nice blend of robust roast, a little char, a nice grainy bitterness, and a little bit of fruitiness as well. Nice, medium-full body, though the mid-palate seems to have lost a little bit of heft. Thinned out a little, this has changed but not improved. Either I like this better fresh, or the 2012 release is amazing (or both). 4/4/4"
"This is a great stout. Not pure coffee, but plenty of richness."
"Overall: The body of the beer is thick and chewy. The mouth feel of the beer is creamy, smooth, and rich. The finish on the beer is almost full. I really like a good RIS and this beer has it. I love the chewiness, the thick full body, and the creamy smooth finish."
"Bottle courtesy bulletrain76. Pours pitch black with a beige lasting head. Graham crackery sweetness in the aroma with milk chocolate and cocoa powder. No indication of what's to come in the flavor, which is massively roasted with notes of the darkest chocolates. Highly bitter and slightly ashy. Surprisingly dry on the palate with no trace of the high alcohol. Medium-heavy body, smooth and drinkable."
"Drinkability: A good RIS, but not quite a great one. Maybe if I let one cellar for awhile..."
"Drinkability: Another solid effort from Founders, though to me it's nothing that's transcendent, and reminds me of many others. Certainly worth a shot, though, as it's much better than average, and takes the visceral to a high level with good bitterness and roasted malt flavors."
"Overall, a good beer, but not an epic beer. I would have liked a little smokey/woody flavor and possible some chocolate accents like I was expecting."
"Is it possible to get a bad beer from Founders? Cynics, please remain silent, for this beer is a delight."
"Pours a jet black with a tan head that disipates quickly. There is no visible carbonation and no cling after the pour. Good Russian Imperial Stout but does not have any qualities that might seperate it from the others. This is my second offering from Founders and I can sense a theme going on, that being of a solid brew that doesn't exactly who you but does bring a good solid beer to the table. I enjoyed this beer but would probably pass it up for other RIS's if available."
"D - I love this beer and it is a great stout to drink. The ABV is pretty high, but you barely notice it. Founders is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"You can probably tell that I love this beer. Great flavor and mouthfeel put this beer up to the top. I do prefer this to Breakfast Stout and KBS. Its just that awesome. Might be in my top 10 beers of all time. When it comes out, be on the lookout for it. You won't regret it."
"Another OUTSTANDING offering by founders. These guys can do no wrong."
"Pours a thick deep dark black with a thin film of brown that sticks around til the bitter end. Smell is very malty, roasty, toasty, hint of coffee and chocolate, vanilla and smoked bacon. Taste is clean, crisp, malty and dark--much cleaner than I expected as this style tends to be a bit rough around the edges. Mouthfeel is thick and juicy, drinkability is great."
"Always enjoy Founders though..."
"This beer pours a thick deep black that has slight ruby highlights when held to the light. A small one finger head of thick, creamy beige-colored head that disappears all too quickly. The nose is of chocolate, roasted malts, a touch of licorice, caramel malts, and the alcohol can be detected. The flavor is of sweet chocolate and caramel malts, alcohol is apparent in the taste but begins to ease as the beer warms. Espresso/coffee notes finish up the taste leaving a bit off bitterness mixed with some licorice in the finish. Thick and creamy mouthfeel to this beer, very low carbonation."
"Overall: Another must try! Cheers!"
"D - Even though I nursed this bad boy for about an hour, this remained quite drinkable throughout. While I prefer Breakfast Stout, this is certainly no slouch."
"This poured a nearly opaque dark mahogany with a bit of dark tan head. It smelled like burnt coffee and brown sugar, with a bit of smokiness and alcohol. It tasted like bitter coffee and burnt dark chocolate, with molasses and charred oak and alcohol. It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and had a strong bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very strong bitter, and dry flavor, but was still enjoyable. It had good body too. Definitely better for sipping, as the alcohol was definitely hot. It would probably mellow out and improve with age. This wasn't as good as the Breakfast stout, and not even close to KBS, but that still leaves it better than average."
"D: The serious alcohol and hops were wear me out, but this sure is good. So, screw it, this gets a 5 too."
"Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy. This thing leaves a film on the tongue. I felt like I could chew this. Flavor is of wine, grape juice, alcohol, and finishes like bitter black coffee. This is crazy good. Very impressive stout. I've been hanging on to this for a few months and it did not disappoint."
"D: For a 10.5% beer, this thing is a champ."
"What a great beer. Pours the deepest brown/black with a deep brown head. Smell of chocolate and faint hops. Taste is sweet chocolate, followed by dark fruit and a nice bitter coffee finish. This is a great RIS I will seek out often. A nice complex sipper."
"Wow, Founders is definitely becoming my go-to for stouts. These guys know what they're doing."
"Overall a very nice and well made imperial stout. With a few minor improvements, this one could be one of the best out there. A great beer."
"Picked up a single at Abe's Cold Beer for $3 a couple months back. Poured pitch black with a tall light brown head. Man, this is pretty bitter. It's also a little more drinkable, which I also like from the big stouts. The beer tastes like extra thick dark chocolate cake, like flourless cake. There's a also a slightly tangy citrus bitterness, that while you can feel, struggles to overcome the massive dark malts on your tongue. Overall a fine RIS and certainly worth my three buck."
"I will definitely be buying this beer again if/when I see it on the shelves."
"m: Truly awesome - coats the tongue and palette without being syrupy or overbearing."
"M: The texture is incredibly rich and velvety, with a layer of warming alcohol. Very viscous and smooth. An amazing mouthfeel."
"This is a pretty good Imperial Stout. I feel like one lucky little boy right now."
"D- Easy to drink, alcohol was well hidden."
"Drinks easy for the style & ABV, not my favorite, but not far from it"
"D- This brew certainly lines up with RIS and is a good example of the style. Exactly what I think when I think of RIS's. IMO, its also a step up from the other Founders stouts. This is good, but a pretty typical example of the style. ABV is high and somewhat prominent. Good beer overall that I would not hesitate to have again."
"Drinkability: I like this RIS a lot. It hides the alcohol really well. Founders makes a lot of good beer and I think this is one of their best. I would get this again in a heart beat."
"D: Regret that I only traded for one bottle, but it's a great single taste. Will have to search out when more trading or when founders is available in Minneapolis."
"This is a huge beer, super rich and chewy, mild carbonation, creamy with a wonderful roasted malt persistence. A great representative of the style and as a stand-alone beer."
"D: Solid... but not my top choice for the style"
"One finger of yellow brown head that falls into a blanket. Stains the glass. Lacing isn't thick but is sticky. Smell has tons of coffee and chocolate. Oak, plum and fig. Smells sweet, bit of alcohol. Taste is very coffee bitter, with a bit of very dark chocolate. A bit out of balance. Thick and creamy. Very good carbonation. Not very easy on the palate and a bit out of balance for my ideal RIS, but I could see why that might be what a good thing for some."
"In the style it's a bit more reserved than many. Why, I can see how this might be drinkable and good at that with only a year in the cellar. As it is, it's over the top on the smoke and bitterness."
"This is a huge Russian imperial stout that competes with (and beats) many of the ""bigger boys."" If the folks at Founders know what's best for them (and for us), they will add this beer to their regular rotation."
"Judging by the notch, this was bottled on June 2008. Decanted into a pint glass. Completely opaque black with a thin tan head. Okay on the retention. Aromas are pretty light: the expected bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee. Maybe some raisins and charred wood. Tastes of the dark chocolate and coffee. Decidedly burnt finish, although it's not bad - the bitterness off-sets the dark sweetness. Decent amount of carbonation - actually a little lighter-bodied that most other imperial stouts, but all of this makes it a very drinkable stout. The higher ABV is hidden, so take care, but otherwise this is a great example of a standard imperial stout. Nothing crazy like barrel-aging or whatnot, but if you're the mood for a good stout, this is a sure bet."
"I think I will revisit this beer in a few years as I develop more of a taste for stouts. The alcohol, dark chocolate and coffee notes contribute to an overwhelming bitterness for me. I rated it higher than I probably wanted to, but I know it's a good stout. Still not the best I have had, but good."
"D: Another RIS sipper, but absolutely fantastic and superb drinkability. Give me more!"
"The aftertaste is to no suprise a huge amount of roasted character and this finishes dry with a very subtle sweetness."
"Pours black with a brownish head. Nose is boozy with touches of molasses. Flavor is intense coffee off the first hit. Lots of roasted malts. Just a punch in the mouth nearly. Mellows out and gives a lot of molasses too fairly quickly. Thick and robust. Seems a bit too boisterous to be bringing the subtleties that you might be able to draw off the other ""biggies."" Either way, who cares. It's still hearty and robust and carries a great flavor profile. Thick molasses and quite malty. (But mostly, it's bringing the molasses.) Feel is thick and smooth on liquid. Carbonation is low. A pretty intense and hearty RIS. Another Founders beer I have enjoyed."
"D - The taste of this Imperial stout is very layered yet a bit 'angular', slightly on the edgier side w/ more of a malt + hop interplay w/ 90 ibus almost apparent in flavor and the 10% is not very hidden, but it more than makes up for it in the flavor - a highly drinkable impy on the hoppy side. I can't wait to taste this again"
"Fantastic when warms up. Chewy creamy aftertaste, with some burn in your throat. Feel the burn."
"A very good stout from a brewery that never disappoints. It's not the best thing you'll have from Founders, but it represents the style and brewery well and should not be missed by any RIS fans."
"Don't get me wrong, this is an impressive beer, but it is not meant for my palate. I love coffee in my beer but unfortunately the coffee profile here is not very good and there are not enough other flavors to make up for it."
"Heavyset one finger head of dark brown froth, very integrated, like a tarp over the surface, plenty of sticky lacing left behind. The liquid is pure jet black, nary a hint of color to be seen. Brawny nose, hurls roasted coffee, black licorice, mint, bittersweet chocolate, not a lot of milkiness or creamy accents, dry and dense like cooking batter, waft of maraschino cherry and raspberry fruit scents, hops muffled if even there. Full-bodied, Very chewy yet with a subtle carbonation which prods the whole forward when it starts to get lazy. Pure coffee, dark chocolate, toffee flavors, spoonful of freshly whipped cream on top. Gentle roast, never that aggressive of a toastiness, much in keeping with a bigger isn't always better approach. Pine and anise seed brighten the mid-palate and add lift. Dense soda bread doughiness. Subtle white grapefruit tang through the finish. For a beer of its size never comes close to wearing you down."
"Recommended."
"Bottle. 2009 vintage, it's been sitting in my cellar for a while. Poured into a tulip glass a very dark brown/black color with a big, think fluffy dark tan head that slowly settles down the glass. Nice left from the head. A big whiff yields some very strong notes of dark chocolate, molassess, coffee, and a slight hint of booze. The mouthfeel is surprisingly a little lighter than I thought with a nice medium, velvety feel. Dark roast coffee flavors mix really well with dark chocolate. There is some sweetness that is really nice in this. Some licorice notes as well. Very nice beer my only knock would be the mouthfeel, wish is was just a little heavier."
"This style is still not one of my favorites (not a huge fan of the coffee flavor), but I'm glad that I can at least appreciate the quality of this brew now. This beer has definitely helped my beer education, too."
"Excellent beer. I can understand the anticipation of this brew arriving on store shelves again. I'd be happy to have another...now. Or later. Whatever."
"Doesn't seem like 10.5% ABV. This could be trouble, I could drink 2-3 if I had the next day off, and on a full stomach. Which sounds like a little bit of heaven, I might have to do this soon. Cheers!"
"D: The drinkability is almost too good for the style. I would not have guessed the ABV was as high as it is listed. Unlike so many other RIS, I do not have to sip it slowly."
"Drinkability: Dense, succulent malt flavors and pleasantly warming throughout, though, for the most part, the alcohol content remains rather well-hidden. It would not be advantageous at all for you to pass up this one."
"D - This is a sipper."
"Drinkability- High ABV and huge flavor and still pretty smooth and drinkable. But if you try to knock down a bunch of these you'll end up crocked."
"This is a drinkable RIS. The taste is excellent with a nice milky quality but a little more acidic than I like."
"The alcohol is not that noticeable in the flavor profile, which is nice considering the 10.5% ABV. Drink after dinner, you will enjoy it."
"M/D - amazingly smooth and full of flavor. This is a nice sipper that is just a treat to consume"
"After ageing for a year the flavors really mellow out. There is a lot more dark fruit, and more sweetness. I highly recomend aging this one."
"Pours a jet black with some dark brown edges. Three fingers of creamy chocolate milk colored head has great lasting retention and leaves some pretty impressive lacing behind. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, smoke, anise, and a touch of woodsy hops. Tastes of chocolate, raisins, plums, and figs up front then lots of roasty malts and coffee flavors. Slight notes of vanilla and anise are picked up before a pinch of chalkiness and some smokiness, with a earthy hop finish mixed with a tad bit of alcohol warmth. Medium-full to full in body, smooth, thick, and creamy with some chewiness to it as well. Extremely drinkable, but the higher ABV hinders how many I'd enjoy in a session."
"Excellent impy stout. Very easy to sip by the fire pit on a very cold NC night. Another great beer from Founders."
"D: This is an extremely well balanced imperial stout. Reminds me of other Founder's stouts (BS, KBS) in regards to the malt profile. This is quite drinkable for the high ABV, but the price will keep me from drinking more than one in a sitting."
"a nice drink for certain, but after one i'll be ready for bed."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Brew pours to a pitch black color, seem thick. Has a thick dark tan head that has incredible retention. Very nice thick lacing down the entire side of the glass. The aroma is rich, heavily roasted and somewhat burnt malts - gives a slight coffee aroma. Sweet aroma with some fruit flavors. Alcohol is there but is a gives a nice rich mix with everything else. The flavor is extremely good, burnt flavor gives it some astringency, little charcoaly in feel and flavor. Coffee comes out more here along with chocolate flavors. The tail end has a nice bitterness, wondering how much comes from hops and how much could come from the burnt malts? The alcohol really adds a nice complexity as it complements everything. The feel of this brew is almost like a milkshake, has a nice and thick creamy feel. I could clearly have another one of these as the flavors are great but I think the alcohol would get to me. This is nice sipper, a good cold weather brew!"
"Overall, a good beer, but not like others."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Pours out an inky jet black. A bit of tan, creamy head sits atop it, leaving behind a decent amount of lacing. Smells are of roasted coffee, and I mean a lot of roasted coffee, a bit of sweet malts in the background along with some alcohol. Taste is of bitter, roasted coffee, and alcohol. Has just a bit of sweetness which helps to balance it out. Very smooth and thick, very little carbonation. Pretty drinkable despite the high alcohol content. Overall, a very good beer and a recommendation for any fan of RIS's."
"D: An awesome beer. Very nicely balanced for a RIS. Never too sweet or bitter. I can go through a few of these in a sitting and eventually the 10.5 % alcohol does makes its presence known."
"Overall, very tasty, but the intensity of flavors isn't offset by a lighter body that I think would have improved things overall. For instance, I had an easier time putting a Dark Lord down than this--that should say something."
"Notes: Another fabulous beer from Founders. I've been flooring at how adept they are at producing high quality ""big beers", and their Imperial Stout is no exception. This definitely ranks as one of the top three Russian Imperial Stouts I've ever had, and it, Stone IRS, and North Coast Old Rasputin make a triumvirate of thick, delicious, and easily accessible stouts that are among the best in the world, bar none."
"A fine example of a RIS. And a great beer. Kudos."
"Good beer overall, kinda wanted more from founders, but I can't complain, they have so many specialty stouts, it's nice to see a good solid standard."
"Not as hoppy as I expected, but this beer is drinkable.... Probably a good introduction to RIS's for beginners..."
"Drinkability: This beer is okay. It's bold and powerful, but feels over-attenuated without much flavor complexity. Worth consuming, but there are better RISs."
"A bit of different take on the style. Very much a sipper. Improves as you drink it. Glad I just received another bottle!"
"D - slow sipper, good nightcap. sweet dreams!"
"Drinks very well despite obvious intensity and alcohol. A very nice brew that makes for a tasty, strong sipper. A powerful, bitter/dry, yet drinkable, version of the style. I have to say that this was enjoyable, but I enjoyed the complexities and overall taste of the Breakfast Stout more (though I do understand that it is a different, though related, style)."
"Overall this beer didn't disappoint, just a real solid RIS that doesn't do too much with coffee or chocolate. Definitely worth a shot."
"Drinkability takes a little hit, because of the intenseness of the flavors. Although I liked it, and will revisit it again, I couldn't have more than one at a sitting."
"Its very smooth and just great.. I really had to search for reasons NOT to give it an A+ (as amazing as it is, Ive had Canadian breakfast stout and that is certainly their crown jewel."
"Of course, this is strong and it won't take much to know ya on your ass. I'd love it if the mouthfeel was a bit thicker and some more coffee and dark chocolate notes could be found here. No matter, I still haven't had a bad beer from founders and if anything else, this proves that not all RIS's are created the same way. Worth a try for those seeking a change from the usual..."
"Tasty and very easy to drink."
"I had the bottle sitting next to me and figured what the hell so I cracked it open. I was rewarded with a good drinking experience. I think it is a good RIS and worth your while to try"
"Surprisingly drinkable, mainly due to the fact that it's freakin' delicious. Top notch stout."
"Just about a perfect RIS. Best I have ever had."
"D: My cheeks are warm and happy. This is a great representative for the dry imperial stout family."
"Another great beer from Founders and a very good example of an RIS all the way around. Excellent!"
"There's no question that Founders makes excellent, world class beer. Imperial Stout is one fine example that stands near the front of their lineup. I can't constructively criticize this beer in any way. It's just too damn good. I hate that this beer isn't more widely available. It was extremely tough to come by this year. Hopefully Founders will ramp up the production on this more in the future. Highly, Highly recommended."
"D - I like it, but man, too boozy and the coating glues itself to your mouth. I bet I wake up tasting it."
"Part of my darkness, dark lord, kate, sexual chocolate, RIS tasting, and near the bottom of the stack."
"Notes: Founder's never disappoints, this beer fits perfectly into my RIS gap right now, absolutley wonderful."
"D: Quite savory. Not quite as complex as Expedition, although it'll definitely factor into the rotation. I'll definitely lay a couple of these down to see how the flavor profile develops over time."
"Pours a thick black with a thin coffee head, evincing minimal carbonation. Aroma is big roasted malt flavors, roasted coffee beans. Taste follows the nose. Roastyness galore. Not oversweet like some RIS can sometimes be. I'd actually say this could use a touch more sweetness, which is out of character for me to say. The flavors are big and roasted, but not sugary. Hops are present to cut the big roasted flavors and provide a nice bitter finish. Definitely very hoppy for the style. A touch short of thick and creamy, but still a very nice smooth mouthfeel, with carbonation kept to a minimum. It could use a touch more body though. Alcohol is barely perceptible. A very nice RIS overall."
"Had this on tap at Bodega in Columbus. I was shocked to see it on the menu, since I have never even seen it in bottles. It was brought to the table in a 10 oz small, sample type glass. Black as night with minimal brown head that disappeared soon after my first sip. Aroma was very malty, cocoa, and licorice. Plenty of licorice in the first sip from the beginning to the lingering after effects. Sipped on this one as it was incredibly filling. Glad I finally got to try this great founders beer."
"Dark raw cocoa at its unprocessed best. Light scent, pitch black still oil with thinnist beige lacing. Light scent of cocoa and expresso. Bit of a bitter chocolate tang that lingers. The ABV is hidden well, though it's definitely present. A dry tannin appears for a moment, but not disturbing the melody. Thick and slick, the mouthfeel is velvety bliss. Reminiscent of RISs that recreate the ancestors of the style. A real treat."
"2 12oz bottles into a Duvel snifter, pours a deep opaque black with a thin tan head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves great lacing. Aroma is loaded with roasted malts and cocoa with hints of fresh ground coffee. The taste is a nice plethora of roasted malts with cocoa subdued in the finish. The beer is somewhat heavy, but the alcohol is fairly well hidden. This is certainly an exceptional Imperial Stout."
"He must have dozed off. He looks at his watch... back to work, he's slept far too long. He staggers back down the hallway. Can't wait for the weekend, I'll have it again... seems so far off..."
"Not sure if this is a bad bottle, but I'll edit my post if I revisit this beer."
"pour is how it should be. quite smooth without that much head. medium to heavy body in pour. a gentle smell of chocolate and roasted malt. earthier than most. tobacco bitter with a slight sourness. not on the sweeter side. but backed by the body so its not abrasive. a good beer. a bit pricey but another solid beer by founder's for sure."
"I'm into it -- not my favorite RIS, but I'd have another for sure."
"Pours an opaque black with cinnamon head that fizzles away quickly. This brew has an enticing aroma: dark chocolate, malty, alcoholic booze, and slight raisins. Whew! Amazingly smooth taste of dark chocolate, touch of cinnamon, and roast. Alcohol is deviously hidden behind full flavor. There's a wonderful spice aftertaste that lingers which seems to be the standout characteristic that makes this a world class stout."
"D: This was quite a beer and may be the best RIS I've had to date (and I've had quite a few of the best: Storm King, Stone, BBCS, Yeti). Once again I'm humbled by the guys at Founders, they've clearly found a niche in dark beers and they're not 3 or 3 with 4.2+ beers in my book. I'm excited to see what their non-Dark offerings are now. Go to any lengths to try this beer, I'm guessing it's gotten lost in the Breakfast Stout hype at Founders but this is just as deserving of great praise!!"
"12 oz bottle served in a tulip. It pours deep black with a 1/2 inch brown head. The aroma consists of chocolate, some sort of fruit, malts and soy sauce. The taste is very good for the style. The finish is bitter chocolate, plenty of hops and coffee. Highly recommended!"
"Overall a very good impy stout. Another quality beer by Founders, but not one I would enjoy every day like many of their other beers. Still very nice."
"Full bodied with medium carbonation and a sticky, viscous, and chewy mouthfeel."
"I think this needs some time to mellow. The coffee is way too prevalent for me and the flavors are not completely balanced yet."
"D- Another wonderful brew by Founders highly recommended and a slow drinker for sure."
"This is a good imperial stout but not one of my all-time favorites. I'll seek this one out on draft in the future."
"D- A big mouth coating stout with aggressive flavors. Due to high ABV and aggressive flavor profile its a one and done beer for me."
"Drinkability: With the high abv and great dessert flavors, I can really see this as a nice after dinner treat. Truly a fine stout."
"I don't really know how this will age, but I don't anticipate this getting much better considering Founders track record with aged stouts. Also, it is drinking pretty good right now with balanced flavors and a very reasonable alcohol presence."
"Charcoal and bitter chocolate were a bit heavy for my liking on this, but certainly worth a try."
"Pours a very dark brown, near black liquid with slight reddish tints against light, nearly opaque. Large dense deep brown head, it almost looks like it has reddish tints as well. Great retention and clumpy streaks of lacing all over the glass. Very strong, potent aroma, that leans a little heavily on a hop like bitterness, slightly astringent, almost like a house hold cleaner. Behind that, some malt and coffee like presence and dark fruit sweetness, but the astringency is a turn off. Body is very thick and creamy, but very low carbonation reminding me of Expedition (looking at other reviews, starting to wonder if I have an off bottle). Primary flavor starts with dark fruit, berries, etc transitioning to a light coffee/chocolate flavor before a dry light hop finish. Very little alcohol presence. A nice RIS, and great representation of the style, but nothing remarkable and in my opinion I prefer something cheaper like Old Rasputin or Storm King."
"D: But I kept noticing the alcohol level, which is not a super sign for me. I would not turn one down, but at the usual Founders price, I will reach for their other products instead (like the Dirty Bastard)."
"Overall I'd say this is great stout that I'll return to. It's definitely drinkable, only getting better as it warms up a tad. This is the perfect brew for a quiet winter night, to sit and sip while reading and trying to keep warm."
"12oz bottle thanks to vwcraig. Dark black with an especially dark brown head. Smells like roasty thick stout goodness. It tastes like your standard regular imperial stout. This was good but nothing really jumped out at me to make this beer special. Oh well."
"D-Very good, worth looking for. I will definitely buy this again next time I see it. This is a slow sipper to take your time on."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. The primary issue I had was the feel because I think the aroma, taste, and appearance are great. I will look forward to enjoying more and seeing how it gets better with age."
"Pours a solid black color, completely opaque with an large brown head. Big roasty sweet dark malt in the nose, hints of coffee and a small whiff of burnt bread. Much is similar in this beers flavor, malty goodness with a nice high hop balance, his beer weighs in at 10.5 and 95 IBU, yea the hops shine through more than youd think. I love that character in an Imperial Stout, others may not. Medium bodied, lighter than you may expect, superbly drinkable."
"This pours a deep, dark black, perfectly opaque. A thick brown head sits on top with some loose, clinging bubbles. Nice lacing and retention. Really a beauty. There isn't an abundance of smells. I get the feeling of carbonation in the nose, a smell of alcohol, with a faint whiff of roasted malts in the background. The taste hit me immediately as a bittersweet chocolate, then the alcohol took over. This one finishes kind of dry, with that taste of black patent erasing everything else behind. The only complaint is that it lacks complexity. I mean, there's plenty of flavor there, but I can't dig deep and search without finding the same stuff. The mouthfeel is oddly a bit thin, which may be a product of the dryness. It allows the alcohol to just pund your tongue - which brings me to drinkability. The attack on my tongue of the alcohol slowed me down quickly, and the feeling in my nose from the alcohol and sort of empty carbonation worked to do the same, but I still found this to be pleasant."
"Roasted barley and sweet malts are in the forefront, with espresso and bitter chocolate backing it up. Good hop character in the finish, perfectly balancing out all of the sweet elements. It's rich and creamy, full bodied. Alcohol adds a nice kick towards the finish but it's not overpowering - doesn't drink like a 10 percenter."
"M + D: Medium heavy, but got a bit hot as it warmed and rightly so, I suppose Good beer certainly... but a bit too intense."
"Another awesome offering from Founders"
"Motor oil black with a creamy mocha head. Retention wasn't great is the only knock on this ones appearance. Smell of chocolate malt with some lite burnt malt notes. Taste is full of chocolate, coffee and some bakers chocolate bitterness on the back end. Mouth is full and creamy. Big surprise (not!) a great brew from Founders. Do these guys do anything other than make tremondous brews? They impress time after time."
"Another winner from Founders. Maybe not up to quality of the Breakfast Stouts, but that's a hard perch to achieve. This is worth seeking out."
"Opaque oily black with the slightest brown ring around the edges. Aromas of coffee, bakers chocolate, licorice, anise, burnt sugars, and tobacco spit. Strong cup of coffee, chocolate concentrate, spicy hops, chewing tobacco, and cooked raisins. Medium body. Light carbonation. Dry finish. Thin and oily."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a nearly opaque dark brown color with a healthy two fingers of fluffy tan foam. The foam leaves a nice, sticky lace on the glass with each sip. Smells of rich roasted malts, bitter cocoa and burnt caramel with a hint of black licorice. Tastes of bitter, dark chocolate, and heavily roasted malt. Full bodied and rich with medium carbonation. Slight alcohol bun, but not as much as I was expecting. Can't wait to see what some time in the cellar does to this."
"Poured form a 12 ounce bottle. Beer poured black with a brown head. Head disappered into a thin ring which left nice lacing down the glass. Smells of roasted coffe with a hint of chocolate. Good drinkabilty with a coffee taste and some fruitiness. Another good beer from Founders."
"A very black color pour with a thin, creamy, dark brown head that diminishes to a nice thin ring,and leaves some good lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted malt, light coffee, faint toffee, and sweet dark fruitiness.Flavor is very roasty malt driven, coffee,bitter chocolate notes some wood or maybe grain,very balanced. Medium-bodied light carbonation, slick mouthfeel with a dry, bitter-roasted finish that features just a touch of alcohol. As always Founders makes it Yummy !"
"I like this beer despite some quirks here and there. The overall experience is pleasurable and something I'd come back to from the Founders folks."
"Pours out a pitch dark black with a minimal brown head that laces like a milkshake. Chocolate odors emit along with roasted malts. The aroma is not severely overwhelming, in fact more underwhelming than anything. Has a nice rounded taste however, smooth sweet chocolaty malts balanced with a nice hoppy bitterness that leads to a balance often lacked in RIS. Very drinkable RIS, alcohol is warming and inviting, this ones on the drier side as well with a nice burnt malt that is warming and pleasant. Moderate carbonation as well makes this a very drinkable stout."
"Drinkability: Founders at its best, or rather beer at its best, and Founders at its typical. I have to say I'm almost mildly disappointed with this one, hoping that combination of one of my favorite styles with one of my favorites breweries would produce lightning. Instead, it just produced the forest fire, or perhaps a severe house fire, or maybe just the sort of thing that strikes a lightning rod, and, well, nevermind. The long and short of it is, regardless of my expectations, this is still a really solid beer, more towards the chocolate and anise end of the RIS spectrum, sweet and spicy, though definitely complex across the board. The alcohol's plenty up there, as is typical for the style, though well hidden ... this is a beer worthy of a four-pack pick-up, either way."
"Overall: delicious. I've yet to be disappointed by founders yet. I must seek out more of this stuff."
"Interesting offering from Founders, and I'm glad I got to try it. Definitely defined and different from the FBS, and holds its own well."
"T - A good RIS, like I said a little thin for me, but still good"
"Another very solid brew from this house."
"D: This is a very good example of Russian Imperial Stout. It's not quite as punchy as some in this style, but it's very easy to like."
"Founders does some things exceeding well(Breakfast Stout) and some not so much(Red Rye, Old Curmudgeon). Their Imperial Stout belongs in the former class of brews. Pours a dark black as expected. Foam dark-brown colored. Nose of rye bread and burnt molasses. Tastes like a Russian Imperial should; dark, heavy, full of body, although with a little alcohol burn at the end. Not the best ever Russian Imperial(Old Rasputin has that), but still a very, very good issue."
"Drinkability: Big, robust, strong, and mean. Very mean. This is a good RIS, but one of the toughest drinks I've ever come across. Not because it sucks; it's just a handful. Be careful."
"Revisited this today as I lucked into a four pack of this in VT. Solid black with a thin tan head that subsides but never really disappears. Smells is heavy on the milk and dark chocolate with some roast and earthy hops. Taste is about the same. Hugely smooth silky creamy mouthfeel with a light level of carbonation and a medium to thick body. I don't recall liking this one as much the first time I had it, but I really enjoyed this today. My review reflects this sampling."
"Very well made, and worth adding to your glass or cellar. Founder has certainly mastered black beer. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: very nice flavor profile screams for you to have a few of these, but the alcohol level and heaviness knocks it down a notch. Great beer overall."
"D: Solid beer. Good tasting imperial stout. Nothing to go jumping out of windows for, but still a winner."
"D: Excellent beer from and excellent brewery."
"HV"
"12Oz. bottle purchased as a single at Marty's in Newton on 1/27. Served in my DT tulip. Poured the color of engine oil with a tight, half inch, mocha-colored cap embedded with bubbles. Head eventually dissipated into a band that coalesced around the bowl and some swirls of foam; some spots of lacing present adhered during the tasting. Nose was cocoa, coffee and dark fruit. Taste consistent with nose; however, dark fruit disappears and a slightly boozy quality comes out manifested as a lingering bitter astringency at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and oily with a little bit of carbonation prickliness. A solid RIS, but not my favorite - a little too much alcohol and didn't quite achieve the mouthfeel qualities I like in an RIS."
"""Imperial"" is the only way to describe the feel of this magnificent drink. Huge, silky, soft and mellow-- but also potent and kickass-- Founders Imperial Stout is a benchmark brew. As quaffable as a gigantic, full-bodied monster like this can be."
"Overall a great beer and another reason Founders is inching its way into my top 3 breweries. Awesome."
"D- It's a definite sipper, but so good that I'd love to drink it again."
"I like this more than the Breakfast Stout. Hopefully my scoring reflected that. BS is still my go to Founders stout though, solely based on drinkability and price."
"smooth, syrupy, with creamy tones, esp. to the carbonation. faint astringency in the finish."
"World Class! a little bit of EtOh as it warms but it doesn't distract too much... This is gonna be a champ, if it isn't already.. purely a great brew that is every bit as good as many ""barrel-aged"" brothers that wouldn't hold a torch otherwise... sippin' brew.. awesome.. I wish soooo much that I could score this a whole lot easier."
"And yet another big thanks to the over- generousity that is, the hoppymeal! Thanks again D-"
"D - Outstanding beer. This is one of the finer examples of imperial stout. I can't believe it's only 25 IBU's, tastes more hopped than that. I will be drinking this in the future."
"D: Really great beer. Glad I was able to pick some up to enjoy during the Super Bowl. It helps me cope with the fact that the Giants are done. Really great beer from Founders."
"The 10.4% really catches up with you even though it is so well-hidden. With such a robust and full flavor profile and body, this is a sipper for sure. A joy to drink."
"Another great offering from founders, I would say this is the best value in the RIS catagory right there with Old rasputin. I liked this better though."
"Overall a very well made and hugely flavorful RIS. The dry/chalky elements of this highly hopped stout really make it stand out. Too many huge RIS' are too sweet, but this one manages to get the malt barrage in tact while giving the hops some of the spotlight also. Very, very flavorful and surprisingly easy to drink."
"bourbon lovers (like myself) will thoroughly enjoy this beer..."
"It'd be nice if this was made more often than every three years, although it's not like Founder's has any bad brews to displace (they seem to have given up on that quad they made)."
"Had this after an Oskar Blues Ten Fidy. Real similar, but what seperated this was the carbonation and had a little more roasting/burnt malt and coffee. Deserving of a top ten stardard imperial. Overshadowed by Founder's breakfast stouts in aclaim, but this is very worthy."
"Quite an impressive RIS, as a big fan of Founder's Breakfast Stout I couldn't pass this beer up and it proved to live up to my expectations. Rich, complex, balanced and filling. Borderline perfect."
"D- a solid RIS that goes down pretty quickly. A few of these in an evening would be a treat. Glad they brought this one back."
"D. I really struggled with the bitterness of 2008 Breakfast Stout. This is much more to my liking - the high ABV (though well hidden) and overall heaviness keeps this to a ""one-and-done"" sipper category but it is very tasty none the less. Another 4-pack is definitely in order."
"Way to drinkable for such a big beer."
"If I could pick one company to be distributed here that isn't already, I would likely pick Founders. They have yet to disappoint."
"Good stuff..."
"Creamy velvet on the lips, with a huge bitter chocolate & hop flavor. Nice yet rigid contrast of flavor. Velvet stout funk felt on the roof of mouth. Really good...really hoppy."
"Drinkability- After my first sip I felt like the alcohol was a bit much in this. After it warmed a bit the alcohol becomes more of a welcomed part of the mouthfeel and flavor than I've ever experienced in a beer. The body is terrific and this beer goes down WAY to easy. Great stuff, find it!"
"This one is so easy to enjoy. A must try RIS from Founders."
"With the excellent balance this beer offers, I find it to be very drinkable. The 10%ABV will keep you from downing multiples, in a single session. The ones that you do get down, though, will be thoroughly enjoyed."
"Not the best imperial stout I've had but it's still better than most."
"A good imperial stout, and one which begs for me to open a Péché Mortel for comparison. I love the mouthfeel on this, but the hop bitterness is a little too dominant for me. Perhaps with some age, this beer could be among the better stouts, but fresh it's just a touch abrasive. Still a good IS."
"Another one out of the ball park for Founders as they keep it coming with stellar releases. I suggest if you have the access to this seek it out immediately. Now Black Rye is the only release i need before I complete their bottled line up, here's to hoping."
"Notes: This is a beer I've been waiting a while to try, and it's with great pleasure I'm able to find this in stores, finally."
"D: I love this because I could sit down and have a few of these, without that one and done feeling of some of the Imperial Stouts these days!"
"I enjoyed trying this Founder's Stout for the first time and look forward to drinking my others in a year to compare."
"D - The beer itself looked beautiful, but its flavor and aroma were really weak. I've had much better imperial stouts for much cheaper, but I enjoyed the opportunity to try it. The flavor (or its lack of) made me not really want to continue drinking it. ( don't worry, I didn't drain pour it. I would never do that to an RIS.)"
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: Founders makes some very impressive stouts. I would easily buy this beer again and would love to try it on tap. If you've had Founders Breakfast its very similar in the malt profile and every bit as enjoyable."
"This is best enjoyed at cellar/room temperative and by sipping and savoring. Having said that, it drinks very easily for its weight class."
"Overall, a really good beer that just misses out on greatness due to the overly bitter aroma and aftertaste. So glad that I got to try it and now I only regret that I totally f'ed up and didn't get any to cellar. I bet the bitterness would tone down and this would improve greatly. Gonna have to score some more to cellar. Still, I highly recommend as it is still pretty damn good and it's only an occasional release so get it while it's out there."
"the more i've drank of this, the more impressed I am with it"
"D - Maybe just a little on the heavy side in feel. It warms the stomach and pleases the palate in one smooth bitter sip. For a cold winter day, not too far off from the one like the weather around me here today, this is a very nice beer to have around and sip on. So enough of this reviewing stuff...I'm off to light a fire, find a good book, and enjoy the rest of this excellent beer."
"I must say I was disappointed with this one. Weak smell and decent flavor but there's at least 10 that I would take over this."
"Extremely drinkable, but should be enjoyed at a relaxed pace to savor the wonderful lingering flavors."
"Another winner from Founders."
"Just an awesome beer. Well done again Founders."
"A joy to drink and interperet as each sip builds on top of the previous one. Alcohol is masked by the intense bouquet of estery and chocolaty flavors. Worthy of inclusion in the Best of BA to be sure."
"Recommended."
"This is outstanding. I only grabbed one 4-pack... and that frugalness will haunt me in my dreams."
"T. Everything mentioned above is present in the taste. Notable roasted malts and stringent bitter coffee flavors give this stout a bite. Ultra bitter chocolate stands big and bold as well. Unbelievably creamy and smooth from start to finish. No harshness. Really great bitter and salty finish with some plum after tones that leads to a fantastic imperial stout."
"D- I think this beer has one of the easiest drinkabilities of any imperial I have every had."
"A very heavy stout and just great to sip on a very cold winter night."
"Very close to full body, one step down from ""chewy""; very flavorful although it lacks a bit of complexity to make it just perfect. Still, lots going on, with chocolate, more on the sweet side, some coffee, molasses, dark fruits, anise. Easy to drink, went down way too fast."
"D- Great stuff! The 3 year old bottle wasn't at all oxidized and was very delicious. It's not very sessionable, but I will definitely seek out more."
"Heavy black tar appearance with dark brown lacing. Smoky flavors and smell, with all the other typical stout fixings, such as coffee and molasses. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, and you can't drink too much. In short, a great imperial stout."
"I love Imperial Stout, it is one of my favorite beers. Thank God I live in walking distance of the tap house!"
"On draft at Founders. Pours damn near black. Smell is chocolate, some coffee, but plenty of dark malts. This tastes incredible. This was my highlight of the night. Full, creamy and luxurious on the mouthfeel. A really decadent imperial stout. This is one of my favorite Impy's. Can't wait for bottles of this to be available again!"
"Overall, I would love to get more of this if I can. Ive never seen it hit shelves but believe me if I do I will get tons!"
"Wow, this is pretty much the definition of a RIS. Founders leaves nothing out with a complex taste and aroma that is held up by a muscular yet approachable body. I'm definitely getting a case of this next time it's released. Great stuff!"
"wish this was bottled this year, i tried to get a growler but they weren't pouring it in them :("
"On tap at Founders. There were aromas of coffee beans and chocolate. In the mouth it was powerful with a slightly bitter finish from the hops. Overall this was quite nice an powerful but did not have the complexity and balance of the KBS. I would love to have a few bottles of this to age."
"Just fantastic."
"Just a fantastic beer!"
"Drinkability- Excellent drinkability with well disguised alcohol content. Oh, Founders, why do you treat me so great?"
"Had this during Gravity Head '08 at Rich-O's. Color is dark black, but just shy of opaque. Head quickly vanishes and leaves very little lacing. Smell is absolutely delightful. Rich aromas of deep chocolate, but with unexpected, but welcome, fruity notes. Taste is a bit more passive than the smell. Huge malt presence (I hear they used 10 kinds of malts). Lots of chocolate, brown sugar, and nice burnt notes. Mouthfeel was on the thin side as far as imperial stouts go, but still sported a thicker medium body. Carbonation was just fine. I'd have another, though the alcohol is well hidden, so I'd have to limit myself to just one more."
"Another great Founders beer, not as good as the breakfast stouts in my opinion but right up there, look forward to trying this fresh next, recommended for RIS fans"
"D: Wow... I can't wait until the new bottles come out this summer. Founders has got to be one of the best breweries out there."
"OK drinkability."
"Pours a complete jet black with a generous two finger dark tan colored head that slowly creeps down the sides of the glass. Stickiness is crazy good, lots of thick webbing left behind. Smell is pretty sweet for a RIS with lots of dark fruits; cherry, dates, and plums. A good amount of robust french roast and espresso in the nose as well. Toasated barley and dark chocolate aromas are detected too. A lot for the nose to discover. This one sure has that ""Founders"" taste to it, but that's a good thing. Blaack coffee with a hint of cane sugar. Not as sweet as the nose, but there is some cherry notes on the tongue. Smokey wood flavors with a bit of an earthy hop bite to it. Aftertaste is dry with hints of vanilla and cocoa. Thick, creamy, and smooth mouthfeel with a subtle but fitting carbonation. Perect texture for the style. I let this one warm up pretty good before tasting and I'm glad I did. What an amazing RIS, one of the best for sure. I'm surprised there isn't more talk about this beer, but maybe I'm just not paying enough attention. Do what you can to get your hands on this one."
"Overall very good. I wish I had a few more to sip on, and a few more to cellar further. Another winner from Founders."
"d: Thanks to hoppymeal for the chance to try this one. I'm seriously considering moving to Michigan, as Founders continues to impress."
"I'd drink this until I was full (maybe after 3, but who cares...very good.)"
"A very good RIS, and one I am looking forward to trying again with some more age on it. I think this will easily join the list of my favorite russian imperial stouts."
"Quite a nice stout. Not as tasty or complex as some of the others I've tried (Peche, Stone, Bells, Founders BS/KBS), but still very good."
"Drinkability/Notes: This is one fantastic RIS. Very thick in the mouth with a big, fruity sweet malt backbone. Loads of chocolate, coffee and dark brown sugar offset by a bit of citrusy hops then it all finishes with a really nice roastiness. Even at 10% abv the alcohol is not over the top, in fact it really adds to the flavor profile. The flavor only gets better as the beer warms. A truly outstanding beer. The perfect beer for a chilly, blustery night, slowly sipping while listening to Miles Davis. Highly Recommended, I only wish I had more. Seek and Enjoy."
"D- Delicious and enjoyable to drink in every aspect. Although this is such a high alcohol beer I barely noticed that in the drinking (only in the aftermath of the drinking did the alcohol introduce itself to my body)"
"D: although there is a discernable alcohol presence, its hard to believe the 10% abv. even though this is very filling and obviously meant to be a slow sipper, it is deceivingly and enjoyably easy to drink."
"Thanks to Jay23 for upping the ante that made this vertical possible."
"Last swigs: A deep rich burnt malt R.I.S with a some dark fruit."
"D- WOW! First off I just can't get over the mouthfeel. Second this might be my favorite RIS that's not barrel aged. I couldn't even imagine this barrel aged and put up against a Bourbon County..That would be my kind of tasting. This is just one hell of a beer. If any one reads this and wants to trade for some please send me a beer mail."
"The dryness is a bit much overall, but its quality is unmistakable. Truly a pleasure to sip."
"Drinkability: This is a very taste brew. Excellent malt / hop balance. High alcohol makes this slightly less drinkable and being an Imperial Stout tends to just limit the potential drinking occasions. Perfect for a nice relaxing evening by the fire. This would be excellent with smoked meats and cheeses."
"Thanks to plucier for this beer!"
"D - This is an awesome example on a Russian Imperial Stout. Do yourself a favor and try this beer."
"D: this beer is very tasty and it is therefore hard not to gulp down fast. Incidentally, Ive finished bottle before reaching the end of the review. Avoid this kind of hedonistic behavior."
"All the initial impressions of this beer remind me of coffee. It pours the color of black coffee, with a head the consistency of the froth on a really dense latte. The aroma is full of roasty notes. Yet, unlike many imperial stouts with a one-trick (coffee) appeal, this has more going for it. After rich coffee flavors up front, you notice the soft, mellow mouthfeel, followed by a bittersweet finish that leaves a pleasant tang in your mouth. A little alcohol burn afterward, but apparently unlike most raters, I don't think that's a bad thing at all. One of my top three imperial stouts."
"Cheers!"
"D: This is a bit sweet, but still a good beer. The ABV is a bit high, but I could knock back a couple or six before I had to pass out. The sweetness would get to me before the alcohol. However, it is still a good beer. Why does it have to be so hard to get?"
"Love this Imperial Stout."
"My bottle says ""limited edition"" on it. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black, with a very small brown head which goes away very quickly. It smells like roasted coffee, chocolate, and some molasses. It tastes mostly the same, but I can also taste some licorice and dark fruit too. Mouthfeel is medium/full and it's silky, creamy and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good, it goes down smooth and it's pretty easy to drink. This is a pretty good beer, I'd definitely buy this one again."
"This was the thickest looking beer I have ever poured. It was like oil or molasses. Thick with no head, none at all, nadda, not even a bubble. No lace ethier, very odd for an RIS. Smell was very nice. Deep dark chocolate and roasted coffee mixed in with hints of vanilla and sugar. Very sweet, and damn near perfect smell on this, fine job, very rich and desert like. The taste was strong, and definatly packed a punch. Very sweet, with the biggest flavor here being roasted coffee and chocolate. Definate alcohol presence here whci at 10% is not shock. Again the feel was very thick, but the lack of carbonation hurt it, as it did not feel as creamy as it could have been. This left the mouthfeel a bit dull and flat. The finish was nice, dry and somewhat hoppy. This one needs more carbonation. The flatness in the mouthfeel takes away from the great aromas and flavors it possess. Maybe/hopefully it was just a bad bottle, will have to seek this one out again."
"Pitch black with a slow rising dark brown head, excellent lacing and retention. Rich smell of malt, no hop presence in the nose, which I'm very pleased by. Smells of cocoa and molasses, sweet caramel beneath, dark fruits as well. Bitterness from the roasted malts greet your tongue first, followed by an almost dry cocoa flavor. Slightly roasty finish, more bitterness as well, not as good as the smell. Lighter side of medium carbonation with medium body. This was pretty good, but perhaps more age would benefit it yet. Too bad this was my only bottle."
"[Note: I put this up against Bell's Expedition Stout in a blind tasting, and it thoroughly slayed the latter, which is by any standard an incredible feat.]"
"D: Takes some getting used to, but not bad. I may actually prefer this over breakfast stout, although neither has impressed me that much."
"D: Rich and luxurious. A great example of the style. Incredibly drinkable for the high alcohol content. A great brew to finish off a cold winter's evening. Highly recommended."
"D: A jigsaw puzzle of complex flavors and aromas. This bottle was laid down for just over two years and it aged magnificently. What a wonderful treat!"
"Mouthfeel is heavy, viscous, sweet up front, creamy smooth, mildly bitter with a distinctively rich, chewiness that is like biting into a spoon full of ripe cherimoya."
"Flavor is just the same as the aroma--but better. The embers are of a fire that is still lit rather than put out, doused and smokey. The coffee is freshly roasting. The dark chocolate is sitting in the fondue pot. Very full body and just pushes the cheeks out. Smooth and soft. Like feeling my wife's wedding dress during our first dance. One more bottle of this beer."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty strong brew and it's not a beer that I could drink multiples of."
"D: Yum. Only word I can come up with right now. It's thick and bold, warming but not overly boozy. Nice balance and easy sipping. Seek it out if you can as it's worth the quest."
"Pours a midnight black with a finger of brown foam that quickly dissipates. Aroma of dark chocolate and sweet malt. Taste of sweet chocolate and coffee; very faint bitterness - tastes more like roasted malt bitterness than hop bitterness. Thick chewy mouthfeel with fine carbonation. Drinkable for a beer of this kind. A very simple stout with roasted malt up front and hops and alcohol playing a secondary role. Might show more depth if aged."
"Another pitch black impy from MI- Dark, dark opaque black, with a good initial froth of mocha head, receeding down to a thin ring, lots of lacing too. Bloody insane aroma, like, its really huge. Anise, dark rum, dark chocolate, bourbon, raisins, burnt molasses, tobacco. It goes on and on. And the body is big too. A punch of roasted coffee beans, with huge boozey dark chocolate. Burnt brown sugars, and throw in a touch of hops bitterness. Though its big, its 10% seems closer to maybe 8%. Its still a sipper, and one of the best Ive ever had. A ramped up version of the breakfast stout, minus the crazy booze of the Kentucky Bourbon. Incredible. Thanks so much Chris for another ""stylin"" brew!"
"Black colored with a hint of brown and reddish tones underneath. Minimal head is tan/brown/orange. Sweet malt, dark chocolate, roasted malt and coffee all appear in the aroma. Later, hints of vanilla emerge as well. Taste follow with sweetness, chocolate and coffee flavors. Fairly dry feeling, slightly bitter finish of roasted malt and a hint of hops. Smooth, medium bodied with decent carbonation. Hides its 10% ABV extremely well. Simply a great RIS."
"D: The abv is a bit high, but the roasted malts are great. A good night-cap."
"According to the beer notes, mine is a pre-2005 but I just picked it up in November 2006 so I guess its been sitting around a while. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, reminds me of motor oil pouring out; black as night with almost no head. Smell is wonderfully complex, slight hints of coffee and citrus, but dominated by a milk chocolatey aura. Taste is initially of roasted malt and citrus notes, with a good amount of hops to balance and an ever so slight aftertaste of alcohol. The mouthfeel is definitely full bodied, with very little carbonation and leaves a coated feel on the mouth. A very drinkable beer, but at 10% watch out! I would definitely recommend trying this beer. If you love imperial stouts, this is a wonderful beer for you. I would be interested to try a post-2005 bottle side by side."
"Cheers."
"On the second cay of December -- with Wisconsin burried under more than a foot of new snow -- this is a dream come true. But maybe one or two dreams at a time, because Founders Imperial Stout eats like a meal."
"D - It is an imperial stout. It is very sweet (and chocolatey) and strong. Not sessionable and no food, this is a true dessert beer. It is quite good in it's chocolate dimension. I had no problem devouring this beer and I wouldn't mind having it again."
"grab some old stuff, it tastes great!"
"If you love RIS, this one is great !"
"Notes - The label appears to give an idea of the date of the beer...probably prior to 2005, according to the description on the front page for this beer, Founders made an ingredient change 2005 and beyond..this is November 2006, beer still was good, can't wait to try one fresher."
"D - I think I paid about $10 for a 4 pack of this in Ohio. That's a great deal. Of course not a daily drinker, but could easily enjoy this once a week in the winter."
"D: A recommended beer, flavorful and satisfying. I wouldn't rank this as my favorite RIS, though it's a very nice one. Count your blessings if you can get one for a try..."
"It took me a long time to finish this bottle. It's thick, dense and rich, yet remains balanced to the point that I can't say anything was overdone. I can see many people enjoying this beer..."
"Overall, one fine beer. Thanks again to shbobdb for this"
"A black opaque color, with a small coffee colored head forming. Chocolate and coffee aromas come right out, but there is the slight fragrance of alchol at the end of each scent. The taste starts with a dried fruit flavor, mostly of currants, followed by the chocolate and coffee present in the scent. A small bit of bitterness comes in right at the end. Thick and rich in the mouth, with an oily texture, a warming feel of alchol does linger on the palate. A strong imperial stout, excellent flavor, and good aroma. All need to do is sit back and sip, and enjoy this beer."
"Dark, viscous (used motor oil) black with a brown leather head that sticks around for the remainder. Heavy roasted aroma matched by heady, alcohol-backed sweetness. Dark fruits and molasses with a hint of vanilla, chocolate, and pine needles. Nice. Singed roastiness up front. Sweet, rich scorched toffee sweetness. Medicinal dark chocolate and boozy coffee near the anise bitter finish. Sticky, full-bodied feel. Not bad at all. Its no Expedition, but Ill be back for more."
"I've passed this beer up in the past, for reasons I can't explain. Never again though. Founders is definitely one of my top two or three favorite breweries."
"Glad to have a couple of bottles of this from BitterBill. Pours a black color, nice carbonation, nice creamy tan head, lots of lacing afterwards. Scents of roasted malts, toffee/caramel, slight spices. The taste is awesome of sweet roasted malts, and a deep toffee/caramel flavor. Medium body well balanced brew. Very drinkable, no hint what so ever of being a 10% ABV brew. What a delicious beer."
"Side note: drink this beer warm!"
"Just a fine sipper, I guessed 10% alcohol, the fire in my head gave it away. Let a couple age for a year, Im guessing a year old brew would knock on a perfect 5. This years brew is just a tad green and harsh  just a tad now."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-y"
"Big flavors of dark chocolate and currant up front complimented with a slight sweetness. There is a bit of bitterness followed by alcohol in the end. This beer has aged very well, very smooth and incredibly drinkable. The mouthfeel is exceptional. Big rich, smooth and velvety over the palate. Very thick and promotes the richness of the deep chocolate and sweet notes. For a 10% abv imperial stout, this is so incredibly drinkable its scary. A truly exceptional beer that has aged very nicely for me."
" A most excellent stout."
"D - If I could have this beer in my fridge all the time, I would be a spoiled little bastard. This beer is a perfect Imp. Stout. When I say perfect I really mean it. My first overall 5."
"Lay this beer down. Young it was too unbalanced, but aged a bit, it becomes more than fantastic."
"Many thanks to FBG Tip Top for this one."
"I continue to be floored by Founders Brewing Company. As long as they continue to brew beer like Imperial Stout (and so many others), they'll have a perennial spot in my top-10 breweries in America. This is a stunning beer that caught me a little off-guard with just how good it is. There are scores of great RISs out there. Founder's version can hang with the best of them and then some."
"A mighty fine nightcapper. A mighty fine dessert beer. A mighty fine beer. Glad I found this in a trade box."
"Another very impressive brew from the folks at Founders. Everything I want in an impy. Makes me even more excited to get my hands on some Breakfast Stout and KBS."
"Thanks to Jeff Krenner (I think) for the sample. Either that or thefatkid13. I can't remember where I got this thing."
"Pours black and thick with a almost non-existent red-brown head that quickly fades. There are roasted malt and smoky aromas at first and as it warms a sweeter chocolate smell along with a nice boozy-bourbony alcohol presence in the aroma. Taste is roast and smokiness up front, the sweet malts are apparent after this as it rolls on and coats the tongue. A dry slightly coffee bitterness finishes along with a nice warm alcohol twang. Good body for the style, not crazy heavy but nice and thick and chewy. I like my ris to have a little more of that vinuous and ripe fruitiness mixed with the bourbony-boozyness, but whether this is classified as double stout or ris, it is a top notch beer."
"Poured out of the bottle into a snifter, agitated it slightly by pouring high to get an extremely thin head on it. Initial nose is of alcohol, roasty goodness, some chocolate, a deep red preserved fruit flavor and some coffee. Extremely easy on the tongue, deep roasted flavor, alcohol soaked plum flavor. An extremely drinkable Imp., not the most complex, but fairly enjoyable and I will open another in a while to see how it fares."
"Drinkability: A decent Impy Stout but I was expecting a bit more; may be because of the age, however - tasted again on 10/12/09 and drinks almost identically; just a touch less warmth from the alcohol and less phenolics - tasted in 2014 and has a lot more chocolate, no dark fruit and quite a bit of hops"
"Drinkability is always subjective. Ask yourself would you like drinking liquid dark chocolate candy bars in a glass? If yes then this beer is a 5.0 drinker, if not it will be a 3.0 for you."
"Drinkability- The abv comes into play quickly. This one is so thick and chewy that it becomes a chore (a good chore) to finish if it's room temp. Becomes super sweet...almost like drinking a melted candy bar that's been left in the sun. Overall though, it's probably the best tasting stout of any kind I have tasted...better than Stone and better than Speedway...super quality brew here....high recommendation! Thanks much John!"
"Another hit for me, just short of a home run."
"Cheers."
"Overall - this is a good beer. Has many fantastic qualities with no faults. It is not my favorite for the style, but it is certainly a strong representative. I would try it again sometime for sure."
"Dangerously easy to drink this beast as well."
"heavy but smooth mouthfeel with just a touch of carbonation. raisins and a vinous sweetness dominate the flavor with some coffee-like bitterness and alcohol. touch of soy sauce lines the throat and the finish, which along with the alcohol limit the drinkability."
"My first Founders and if this is any indication of the other brews, I'm going to have to order cases."
"I would enjoy one of these every few months, definetly not my kind of session beer."
"Comments  Thanks to skyhand for busting this one out at her Semi-Annual Sewage Sale."
"D: Alot going on with this one. Very complex and tasty, would recommend to anyone and got better halfway through, maybe once it warmed up a little. Should be a good one to tuck away for awhile! Another good offering from Founders, now if I can just get my hands on some of the Breakfast Stout!"
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks AKSmokedPorter!"
"D: This beer is GINORMOUS. Very rich, very complex. Bit too sweet for my tastes but still wonderful."
"Overall, this was similar to my experience with the 2005 batch with a few differences. It still looked great - black with a short brown head, excellent head retention and lacing. The aroma was more roasted than the more recent bottle, with some bittersweet chocolate and a hint of smoke. Excellent balance of flavours, with chocolate and light raisin/plum to start, mild bitterness, roast and dark fruit. Just a bit of lactic sourness as well. Mellow and silky smooth with very fine carbonation and a full body. This is an awesome stout that apparently has excellent aging potential - it's even better with a bit of age on it."
"D - Great night cap, but too filling and heavy for much repeat-ability"
"Drinkability: I could actually line up a couple empties of these, it is a well balanced, yes asertive RIS."
" A little too thick to be very drinkable. Might work well after dinner or as a nightcap."
"Notes: Founders makes some kick-ass stouts. The Midwest makes some kick-ass stouts. Why am I leaving the Midwest? Oh yeah, the f-ing beach!"
"This is a good drinker for a 10% ABV beer. I'm going to go back and buy the rest of these 4 packs tomorrow. The store I bought these from charge 7.49 for a 4 pack of these, has to be a mistake. This beer is just as good as Breakfast Stout or KY Breakfast stout and you pay about $18.00 a 4 pack for those."
"D: Very nice. Impressive for its strength."
"This beer is dangerous. Probably the easiest drinking over 10% beer I've had yet. Smooth and agreeable taste profile and no stomach burning alcohol feeling makes me want several of these. I'd pick this up often when I had the chance."
"Oh mama! This a great beer to drink by the fireplace. I will definitely buy this again. It's also a good canidate for the cellar, if you have the patience."
"This was a very thick beer full bodied beer and I really enjoyed it."
"to compare it with the 2003, it's like that brew but with everything turned up a notch. the bitterness, alcohol, and roastiness are all a bit stronger than the 2003. the flavours on the 2005 have not mellowed and gelled together quite as much as the 2003, but it's still very good. it has a nice full body, and seems ""beefier"" than the 2003 does. it's an exceptional beer on its own, but when compared with the 2003 that one is the clear winner. i look forward to trying more vintages of this one in the future."
"Pours like thin motor oil with no head and a bit of lacing. Smells like a chocolate bar or brownies - very inviting. Taste is chocolatey with some coffee notes. Very creamy and full bodied - I could drink this all night. A super dessert beer - would probably be great with some ice cream..."
"Bottom line: This is an RIS with huge flavour!!! and....I can recommend it."
"Overall a very good beer. I'd pick up an Old Rasputin from Trader Joe's rather than go out of my way for this one, but this is definately worth trying if you come across it."
"Somewhat tannic, and bitter, with a finish that falls somewhat short in my opinion."
"Pours a thick black tar with a very small chocolate colored head. Smells sweet and strong with mocha and chocolate tones. Very inviting. A very strong taste with immediate flavors of mocha, and roasted malts. A strong aftertaste that is bitter and leaves you wanting another sip. A smooth mouthfeel, you can tell this beer packs a punch with its ABV. This is a beer that I can't see anyone drinking in mass quantities considering its thick character and ABV. Considering the price I don't think anyone would want to drink many of these in one sitting. A good offering from founders, but not as good as their breakfast stout, but still very enjoyable. They consistantly produce great beer that is head and shoulders above many breweries. This beer is definitely worth a try! Enjoy!"
"The body is absolutely huge. One of the most full bodied beers I've encountered. Not one of the more drinkable ones though. Too rich and bold, too dry. Not exactly a refreshing summer beverage, but it's good."
"Mouthfeel is big, thick and a touch syrupy. Really mellow carbonation on this one works quite nicely. Goes down smooth with no trace of alcohol. I could sit down to a couple bottles and have a good evening. Yet another tasty stout from the guys up in Michigan. Keep 'em coming!"
"Smells real good though."
"A really good imperial stout, but I probably won't drink it too often."
" Taste is awesome, chocolate, both milk and the dark kind, coffee, roasted, then burnt malt, and a dry, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, low carbonation. Insanely drinkable right now, it will be a struggle to cellar this."
"Drinkability is insanely good for a 12% beer. You can't see that there's any alcohol in here. That said, one of these will definitely be enough for me, I have to be conscious tomorrow."
"Without saying, the beer is certainly full bodied and then some. It's oily coat is awash in the mouth and saturates the membranes with full effect. The low-lying alcohols allow the beer to rest weightedly on the mouth and seeps into the tissues with a mesmerizing mouthfeel. The beer retains its structure well past where the finish is expected, even as the bitterness from hops and the alcohol warmth wants closure. It's indefinate linger blends seamlessly into the next sip even if minutes away. This is a dessert beer for sure!"
"Rich opaque black color, with a small filmy head of light tan. Aromatics are very roasty, burnt, malt accented with a touch of chocolate and fruit, along with the aroma hops, which are fortunately very mellow and only provide a slight hint of apricot and citrus fruits. Flavor begins with a plethora of sharp anise notes, which leads into a light array of currant and charred fruits. Chocolate covered truffles finish things out, underneath a rich roastyness and an easily perceptible hop flavor and bitterness on the finish. A bit hoppy, especially in the flavor...compared to what I generally enjoy in the style. But the malt flavor is still phenomenal and the texture and body remains very rich throughout."
"Pours black and syrupy, almost lumpy. cocoa colored head. beer is all about roasted malt and chocolate flavors. no dark fruit flavors like in other imperial russian stouts ive had. Roasted flavor is not harsh but very up front and taste defining. some hop flavor on the finish. Might cellar one to see how the taste changes. alcohol hits fast and hard as i drink it at 3:30 in the afternoon during a departmental seminar on squirrels. very full and syrupy mouthfeel. not a top of the line impy, but i'm left wanting more nonetheless."
"Body is quite possibly the biggest I've ever had...like a melted hot fudge sundae. It just glides across your mouth a creamy, buttery texture and a mouthfeel like liquified silk. So creamy and sinfully rich. There's no way that this 12 oz. bottle is less than 500 calories. Worth every one too! Killer delicious, but definately a one-beer-per-session type of beer. Unless you want to go into diabetic shock that is. I couldn't imagine a finer way to go."
"Would have loved it in the winter. I love it now, but definately a cold-weather beer. This is MY kinda RIS."
"Overall: Another great beer from Founders ."
"-UF"
"Mouthfeel- Just liquid velvet, with a little carbonation to remind the palate you are drinking beer."
"Black hole pour with one of the darkest espresso heads I've ever seen and great lacing. Nose is strong black coffee and cocoa powder with a hint of hops. Taste is big and chocolately, cafe mocha, and a bit of minty hops to give it some bite. Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth and creamy with micro-carbonation that tickles the mouth. This stuff is dangerously drinkable at 12% abv, I could see myself 3 deep in this stuff and getting caught up with. A delicious Impy stout here, even when lacking in the characteristic dark fruits. A choco/coffee masterpiece."
"drinkability: its robust and powerful, a 12oz serving should suffice"
"This beer poured black as tar and thick as oil. The brown head barely showed up. It smells great. There is a strong roasted coffee smell, and some chocolate as well. The taste is great as well. It starts out sweet and chocolaty and finishes dry and bitter. More of a coffee and cocoa bitter as opposed to a real hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is extremely thick which makes it great for sipping slowly, and at 10% that is a good idea. The first one is very drinkable but it's not something I'd drink more than one of at a sitting."
"This is stout truly IS brilliant!"
"This is a sipper, make no mistake. It's a meal in a bottle, and the ABV will do a job on you if you try to rush it. I rather enjoy it, but would only look to drink one when I plan to be completely stationary for a while."
"Dark dark black/brown with a thin ring and some stray bubbles, like oil floating in water. Burnt caramel, dark roasted malt, some molasses soaked dark fruits in the nose. Astringent backed sweetness, the hop bite is subdued by the charcoaled grains. Plenty of flavors, but are they enjoyable? The mouthfeel is medium, the finish is astringent. High ABV and the lack of any overarching pleasant flavors make the drinkability on this one suffer. Not bad, not great."
"."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a medium dark brown foamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of deep black chocolate with slight roasted malt without any discernable hops. Taste is also dominated by the sweet black chocolate with some roasted malt. The taste is really sweeter then expected and I cant seem to notice any hops or bitterness which kind of seems to be missing. Body is above average with a full creamy texture. Alcohol is very well hidden which is another plus. Nice and enjoyable but would have appreciated a higher hops profile."
"As the beer warms up it even becomes more balanced and rich, with the roast burnt notes balancing even a step more. It still finishes with that bit of roast acidity, which helps to balance the mouth coating thickness; making you to want to take another sip that much sooner."
"A very drinkable beer, but the alcohol might eventually catch up after a few. Definately recommended."
"This one belongs in the elite ranks of American brewed, imperial stouts. An excellent sipper at room temperature, or just slightly chilled. Body is a bit heavy and challenging to have more than one at a sitting, but this is another superlative offering from Founders. Very well crafted, and teasingly complex."
"Sweet cherry pie topping, plums, licorice and toasted burnt malts, leafy hops and chocolate in the nose. Holy goats, that's THICK! Flavor is dripping with smoky chocolate flavors, coffee, a mild dark fruit candy sweetness, and underneath it all a subtle hop bitterness lingers throughout. Carbonation is barely there, just tingling the throat in the finish. This is a friggin' meal. Chewy and thick can't even begin to describe. As far as Imperials go, I can't say this is my all-time favorite (I need more of it for that to happen...Founders, come to PA!!) but it ranks up there. Thickest, to date? Easily. Do I wish I had more than a little 12oz bottle? Oh yes, though I probably wouldn't have to eat for another day or so if I had a bomber. This beer is the cat's pajamas, get some if it's available."
"I was really let down by this brew. All hyped up and took me nowhere. Poured out to a pitch black color with only notes of a head. Nearly no carbonation at all, not to mention that any lace was a long shot. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and dark rotted fruit. Nothing amazing so far. Flavor was abrasive and acidic, with strong indications of alcohol and burnt malts. Mouthfeel was good and thick, but wasn't enough to save this beer from being a disappointment. I'd probably pass on this if offered again. I may re-review again, but as for now, this brew was a course in undesireable beerdom. Pass on it."
"Very drinkable."
"This beer is too big and thick for me, so it lost big onthe drinkability."
"Drinkability. I couldnt down more than one or maybe two of these in a sitting, iots too bitter and the alcohol shows through a bit too much, however, this beer leaves me quite happy and I would certainly enjoy another tomorrow, and the next day, and the next"
"Pours a deep dark black, very opaque, small but thick tan head forms and laces all over the glass. Smell is very roast, coffee, floral hops, some alcohol and vanilla. Taste is coffee and chocolate, caramel, and a bitter roastiness. Mouthfeel is full bodied, low carbonation and silky smooth, amazing stout! Thanks DrJay."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a tight 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head slowly fades down to an even film of tiny bubbles, and lacing consists of very slow moving foam that wants to rejoin the liquid but hardly has the strength to fall. Aroma is hearty dark malts, coupled with vinous dark fruits and alcohol. Taste is extremely rich dark chocolate and coffee flavors upfront, with the fruit and alcohol coming in on the middle, and closing with an increasingly bitter coffee flavor, and definite warmth. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, although a bit more carbonation wouldn't hurt in my eyes, and drinkability is high in that you want to come back for more, even if the abv means that you come back for more tomorrow. Nice representative of the style."
"Looks pretty similar to the Breakfast Stout, pitch black with a dark head; the Imperial Stout's head, however, looks damn near purple. Smells sweet, of prunes and licorice, wine-like. The taste has a similar vinuous character, but also a really delicious roasted flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. I must say, I prefer the Breakfast Stout's coffee/chocolate to the Imperial Stout's dark fruitiness, but the latter is pretty good and finishes well. One is definitely enough, though."
"Drinkability: Man I wish I had more!... This is a very drinkable big beer."
"This brew pours a motor oil black with a small brown head. The aroma is of coffee, chocolate, crackers. The taste is like the aroma. Rich and complex. There is absolutely nothing that hints at this brew's high ABV. The mouthfeel is full bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a really good brew."
"Not always my favorite style, but a brew like this could move it up the rankings pretty quickly."
"A true sipper...this is a big tasting Imperial stout...reminds me of another Michigan brewed stout (Expedition)....would rate in my top 5-to-10 Imperial Stouts if not higher....possibly top 3-to-5. I like this style BIG and this fits the bill....very rich and full flavored....would pair great with a big maduro Churchill"
"Poured an opaque black color with a dark brown, slightly red head, and light lacing on the glass. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, and raisins. Very full mouthfeel, included dry tastes of sweet chocolate and roasted malt. Very smooth and creamy impy stout."
"Kick-ass imperial stout! Thanks to cmaruschak for this midwestern gem!"
"This stout goes overboard in every way possible andsucceeds on all fronts."
"Thanks for another beaut from Founders cokes."
"Drinkability is above averege for this particular style. The abv is large but this one is worth at least one or two more visits in one sitting."
"Black with a small milk chocolate colored head that only endures for a few seconds before sounding retreat. Smells of big, rich roasted malts, very sweet, yet bitter at the same time. Somewhat smokey with some soft vanilla and black licorice notes as well. Very rich malt flavor as well. A little roasted malt bitterness with some coffee flavor and something reminiscient of oaky tannins that give a somewhat sour vanilla flavor as it warms. Very warming alcoholic finish. Very thick and viscous, drinks like a meal."
"The first bottle I had from this 4 pack seemed very flat though this one is a bit more lively. Reminds me of The Stones song ""Paint It Black"" . ""black as night,black as coal,I wanna see the sun,blotted out from the sky..."" This sucker is BLACK. Very slight tan head that finishes off the look very nicely. Moderate aroma-very black currant like. Somewhat floral and espresso. Big,bold,roasted flavor but no astringency as found in some imperials. Licorice,anise and a very nice residual treacle flavor. Floral flavor crosses over from the aroma. Huge mouthfeel but the overall package is damn well balanced. A damn fine brew-I knock it down just a smidge for the floral quality but its one hell of a beer. The more I try Founders beers the more I like them. Get this one for sure."
"A bit sour Balkan, but that sourness was moderated. Smooth and rich to sip. Good appearance and chocolate roast aroma. Whisper of smoke. Medium to full mouthfeel. Good lunch accompaniment. I think you brought it in Wohlfs, so thank you. Second bottle sent by Dr. Jay and not sourness."
"On-Tap at the brewpub in Grand Rapids. Dark opaque bloody black with a big head of moch foam that lasts with superb lacing. Aromas of everything. Deep dark bakers chocolate comes to mind, than cocoa powder. Perhaps some vanilla, caramel, roasted malts, and green leafy hops as well. Taste is hoppy even at the start but roasted and powerful as well. Not very alcoholic, though, which is a plus in my eyes. Chocolate and coffee round out the middle and the finish is raw, green, leafy hops with an almost medicinal quality to it. Mouthfeel is thick, but not cloying or overly sweet or bitter, drinkability remains high, especially for a 12%impy. They serve this and the breakfast stout too cold at the brewpub though. This one really needs to warm up before all of it's complex flavor notes become apparant..."
"Drinkability on this is good, they a do an amazing job masking the 12% ABV"
"This baby was a doozie. I really enjoyed the fact that the alcohol was so well blended with a perfect mix of malts and hops. None of the three overpowered. This one was quite dark, black actually. The beer had a roasted, chocolate nose with hints of sweet caramel malt. The taste was out of sight, with lots of chocolate, coffee coming through. The rich, syrupy mouthfeel was well accented with the perfect carbonation. Drinkability is good, especially considering the extreme alcohol. I would recommend this to any stout lover who wants to let their expectations become exceeded."
"Thanks tr!"
"Full Throttle!!! Worth seeking."
"But still, art in an onyx, sun-stealing continent of a beer."
"Drinkability is great yet another Impy Stout I would like to keep in my cellar if I could buy it locally. Many thanks to gimmehead for this fine Founders brew."
"2004 bottle cellar by me for almost a year, consumed in June 2005. Pours a pencil-thin dark brown head over a syrupy thick and utterly pitch black liquid. Smells raisiny, molasses, licorice, and chocolate with a gentle sting of alcohol. Taste starts roast with a barely detectable underlying chocolate. The chocolate then rises and persists well into the aftertaste. is just a hint of cherry sour. As the beer warms, the roast grows stronger, but a caramel toffee rises, and helps with the transition from roast to chocolate. Overall, the beer is sweet, but the chocolate has dried out and the roast after the swallow lays dry on my tongue. A nice contrast with the sweet on my cheecks and back of my tongue. Thick mouthfeel and mildly carbonated."
"Pitch black attack! Poured out nice and silky smooth with a deep purple tint. The head was very scarce and there were a few conglomerates of sticky residue that looked like a fungus. Anyways, the aroma is filled with a pruney, chocolate, raisin kick. The taste is sweet with a semi-thick body. There is a residual sweetness that clings to the tongue a little bit. The beer is well balanced for an imperial stout. There seems to be some characteristics of a baltic porter in this one. Overall, a nice beer from founders, but not one that will blow you out of the water."
"After having this on tap at the brewpub and being completely wowed I promptly bought some to bring back home. As I finished up my second bottle I was left wondering what was missing from the bottled version. The tap version was great, the bottled version was good but not quite wowing good. Typical inky black body with slight brown head with some staying power. Nice roastiness backed with light dark fruit sweetness and some dark chocolate. Sweet fruit flavors with a big chocolate and roastiness. Some coffee going as well. Sweetness though seems a bit over done here. Light bitter finish. Mouthfeel is just ridiculous, motor oil indeed is not doing it here. The thick creaminess makes this go down quite easy. If the sweetness would be toned down a bit it would have helped. Good brew all around that I look forward to drinking again."
"Nice stuff. Really hit the spot. Special thanks to cmaruschak."
"D-This is a nice imperial stout that has some pleasant complexity but not overly complex. It blends well in flavor and the hops are a nice taste."
"Drinkability is very solid but one is enough its so powerful that your taste buds kind of need a break after just one."
"Addendum to new review: after reading other reviews: I was going to leave it to others to describe flavors, but I will say that tobacco, coffee, and cacao are all over this. Wars were fought for this stuff! With a four-pack you have enough to share. ;)"
"Pours an ink black color with deep mocha colored head that leaves a nice sheet of lace behind,aromas of rum and butter dominate but there is a slight presence of grassy hop that adds to the aroma complexities.Think and full mouthfeel with rich buttery flavors with a rum/alcohol finish that really warms the inside and is very sustaining.Wow a big badass impy stout with tons of complexities Iam glad I have more to say the least."
"Overall: Not bad, but I thought the alcohol was a little too evident. I don't feel this one holds up very well against their delicious breakfast stout, but it's a nice enough beer."
"Slàinte!"
"Pours black with no hint of light passing through. A thin dark brown head makes an appearance, and hangs around til the end. Aroma of bitter bakers chocolate and alochol. Taste is very big. Starts off creamy and smooth, then quickly moves to a short lived acrid charcoal flavor brought on by black patent. Moving on to rich chocolate and coffee flavors. From there we find some warming alcohol enhanced by citrous hops. Thick and full mouthfeel marked by alcohol that burns the mouth slightly. Finish is dry and roasted with a very slight smokiness. Good offering from Founders, whom I have come to respect."
"much thanks to Chaz for the bottle...a happier day will fall when Founders is available locally!"
"From notes. Pours a very dark color with a small head that falls fast but leaves a lot of lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma has a lot of roasted malts with a slight bit of chocolate and some dark fruits. The flavor is a very nice blend of the coffee and the chocolate with a hint of the dark fruits. Very little hopping. The mouthfeel is very thick but the alcohol is slightly found in the finish. Extremely drinkable for 12%. Founders doesn't disappoint."
"A fine Impy that is ready-to-drink, no aging necessary and, to my tastes, not preferred. Nonetheless, an enjoyable though diabetic pint."
"Exemplary of the style."
"Pours out like black cough syrup from the bottle to the pint glass. Very, very small head of dark brown foam. When I poured it and shook out the remaining droplets from the bottle, they swam and then sank to the bottom like little black, oily pearls. As far as looks, this is probably one of the most eye-catching beers I've ever drank...and it had an aroma to match. The scent was a melange of baking chocolate and an almost chocolate liqueur/baking vanilla type scent, like sweetness with a distinctly alcoholic edge. Felt thick in the mouth, almost syrupy, and the taste was exceptional. Lots sweetness in the mouth and then a finish like Irish coffee, bitter with a nice alcohol bite (and considering its 10% ABV, no wonder!). Hanging around in the background was a very nice hoppy character that the bitter finish tempers well so it doesn't become to overwhelming. Overall, a wonder class beer from Founders."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out thick, seemingly with chunks. Jet black with a nice cocoa head. Creamy, malty aroma, with strong alcohol in the nose. Huge malt flavor with chocolate, bread, figs, and licorice. Full mouthfeel. Thick, but not syrupy. Remarkably drinkable for such a high level of alcohol. This is an Imperial Stout that rivals the best I've had. I would put it up there with Stone Imperial Russian Stout."
"The mouthfeel is thick and oily. While this is a complex and tasty brew, just what I needed after todays freakish late April snowstorm, it doesn't get many points for drinkability. This one's a sipper. I have a four pack in the cellar. Can't wait to see what she does over time."
"Drinkabiltiy : This beer is exceptionally smooth and easy to drink. Surprising, considering the high alcohol content and the style of this beer. Very easy to drink."
"Founder's never ceases to impress. What an amazing beer! This is one of the finest Imperial Stouts I have had (next to Dark Horse-Do try it!). Cheers!"
"I also would like to thank John at Federal Wines in Boston for donating a bottle of this Limited Edition Stout. I haven't had anything this nice this since the Rochefort 10!"
"Two plus years in the bottle (2005, tasted in 2007). It's hasn't gone very far. The head is barely present. The infantile Pinot Noir traits have blossomed into fully-realized Sherry. The malt leans more towards fudge than roast, but both are present in buckets. Hopping has fizzled somewhat but still has pine cones to spare. The bitterness now just offsets the gluttony. Alcohol is perhaps more of a factor than ever, or at least more than I realized. In many ways, this seems to separate with time rather than congeal."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours very dark, no light penetration. Good sized tan head that sits nice and tight on top. Tons and tons of sticky lacing. Beautiful! Aroma is residual sugars and alcohol combined with a thick coffee roastedness. Taste is simply too strong on the alcohol though for me to fully appreciate this beer. It's good. Nice thick chocolate malt syrup taste then a slight hoppiness but not quite enough. Alcohol is very apparent and there's a bitter espresso taste in the finish. Finish is acidic and lingers with espresso beans and alcohol. Surely a sipper. Body is very thick. Not a real complex beer but I think time might help both the complexity and alcohol intensity. I think this might be kick-ass in a year, but for now its just decent."
"Edit: Had one of these with a year on it and it would score just shy of a perfect 5!!"
"Drinkability: Dangerously high for the ABV. It definitely can sneak up on you. Great as a dessert, apertif, or heck, any time of the day. This one's a keeper. Founders doesn't do much wrong in my opinion."
"The mouthfeel is what I noticed first during the taste test. Splendid creaminess followed by a bite. Well full and mildly carbonated. The taste was chocolate with a pinch of Juan Valdez. Appealing sweetness paired up with the slightly hop bittered finish to round out the flavor. The alcohol was imperceptable under the robust flavor. The richness seemed to increase the deeper I plunged into the glass. The chocolate goodness in the last swallow was like the peaking of the experience. I immediately wished I had another bottle to rip into after this one was gone. It was surprisingly delicious. Way better than I had anticipated. Once again the Founders throw me a succulent beverage."
"Rereviewing after receiving another sample in a beer trade. A wonderful beer. Looks like motor oil coming out of the bottle. Thick and apaque. A huge, mocha colored head forms and stays the entire time. Lots of lacing down the glass. Deep aromas of chocolate and coffee, mollasses, raisins. Nice full body. The alcohol seems to be well hidden given the 10%abv. I could drink this all night. My favorite Impy to date."
"Drinkability: Try this beer with a rich chocolate mousse, or perhaps a great piece of a dark, boutique Mexican chocolate candy. I think the Aztecs would recognize this beer as a direct malty descendant of their ancient cococa drinks."
"12oz. Superb aero chocolate bar head dominates my large snifter. 30 minutes later, theres still a good 2cm well laced foam. How many imperial stouts can do half as good? Opaque tar appearance. Very well balanced chocolate milk and coffee nose is backed up by a hefty dose of vinous fruits. Rich malt profile. Licorice reminiscent flavors emanate as the beer warm together with a mellow alcohol kiss. Apparent oatmeal character, velvety texture with extremely mellow carbonation enhancing the silky creamy feel. Understated foresty hops blend with the heavy roasted malts in elegance and taking good care of avoiding acidity. Stunning take on the style, possibly the best looking impy, superb texture and solid flavor balance makes it a real winner."
"After taking the bottle out of the fridge, I let it sit for about 10 minutes. I can smell the vinous tones before I even pour it out of the bottle. Black in color with a thick creamy tan head (after a hard pour). Aroma of malted barley, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, coating and extremely smooth. Things start off with a dark choclate flavor and move to a rich vinous taste in the middle, somewhat reminiscent of raisins. Hops make their presence known just before the finish. Bitterness seems appropriate and builds on the dark roasted barley and vinous flavors. Alchohol is not overpowering at all for a 12% Imperial Stout and the drinkability is remarkable. It goes down dangerously smooth. Nicely done!"
"This beer pours a jet black color with a ring of head around the top. The nose is roasty and dark, with big bits of chocolate and slight dark figgy sweetness. The flavor is mocha, starting more coffee bitter and moving towards the chocolate sweetness. Very nice. I like it. The feel is thick and syrupy, but not big thick like the breakfast stout. For a big beer, the alcohol is only present when the glass is swirled. There is a nice warming after a few sips. Very nice. I like it."
"Pours Jet black, stately mocha head, leaving fine lacing. Nose is big and loaded with chocolate, smoke and coffee grinds. Full bodied brew, alcohol present. Complex flavor profile, including lots of expresso coffee, dark chocolate, smoke, alcohol, rum soaked brownies, yum yum ...big bold, full bodied sipper. Seek---age/enjoy"
"from the bottle poured black with a brown head and a lot of lacing. aroma, chocolate, molasses, cherries, coffee, coco, cola,plums, roasted malts, alcohol. flavor bitter sweet chocolate, coffee, malts, alcohol, some smoke, a nice bitterness, and smooth mouth feel. like this one"
"Definitely a nice, worthwhile effort from Founders here. For a ""big"" beer, it's got some nice characteristics. A bit hoppy, but not terribly so."
"Pours a most viscous and opaque black color. This stuff is thick and no light is going to penetrate this beer. A respectable, for imperial standards, dark brown head forms. Smells very burnt and full of flavor. Some chocolate enters the nostrils followed by a showing of undeterminable hops. Taste is of burnt malts. Sweet, yet harsh. Coffee, espresso, chocolate are all here and rolled up into one big stout. The hop bitterness doesnt shy away at all either. It hits you nicely, with a grassy hop flavor that rounds out the profile. The alcohol is there, but well hidden for being a supposed 12%. This stuff is thick and literally coats the mouth. This is how an imperial should be as far as mouthfeel. This one is top notch. Another winner from Founders. More and more each day these guys are proving to me that they are one of the best in the country."
"A very nice Impy indeed. Maybe a bit high on some hop flavors, but this is still young! Given proper time, this should mellow out to a mouthful of chocolately malt flavors. As of right now, it's still a fine beer and quite easy to handle."
"A nice Impy stout from Founders. Pours thick and viscous, like Motor Oil. Minimal head and lacing. Dark as night. Smells collide of sweet yet roasted malts and alcohol. Taste and mouthfeel come together. This is tastes as thick as it pours. The Alcohol is present in the taste, and there's not a ton extra, other than the roasted malts playing along. It's a solid example of the style, but not quite nailing it for me."
"Not quite as intense as other American Imperial Stouts that I have sampled, but rather more in line with the English varieties."
"I bought this as a single - but look forward to picking up another four or six or eight or ..."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a thick dark black liquid. No highlights at all, this is nothing but black. Nice creamy tan head, however it disappeared very quickly. There was not much lace on the glass at all either. Smells of dark roasted coffee and molasses. Also notes of dark fruit and alcohol. The taste is a rich deep dark malt, with some notes of chocolate syrup. Slight astringency. Espresso-like aftertaste, some moderate hop bitterness. Alcohol is not as noticable as the nose would indicate. Full body, somewhat creamy mouthfeel, and low carbonation. Overall, a pretty good drinkable Imperial Stout."
"Beer is reflective of bourbon and vanilla and coffee in the aroma with a strong roasted barley flavor giving a more acrid approach to the middle of the brew, but the body is such that the finish is really clean and smooth to the next sip."
"This is probably one of the few beers than can stand up next to the Bell's Expedition Stout. It has a good array of spice and chocolate flavors as well as a very smooth, creamy texture. Not as flavorful as the Expedition, but a better feel going down."
"Thanks to trbeer for a bottle of this one. A nice rich imperial stout, and though it doesn't quite have the sustained drinking that maybe some of the other imperial stouts do, nonetheless it's a worthy beer and one I'd love to see in PA."
"Consistency is nice and chewy, just like I like my beer while the drinkability is fine on this if you're a regular stout drinker."
"The taste is familiar, but unfinished or unrefined. I'll continue to drink this stuff because it's local and it's affordable, but I'm certain there are better made Imperial stouts available."
"Notes: Huge thanks to Winomark for this fantastic beer."
"The flavor is chocolate with a bit of licorice in the finish, with a thick and oily feel that thoroughly coats the glass and mouth. A long and lingering aftertaste that is nicely bitter and bitey - perhaps just a bit strong, but not unpleasant. Except for the alcohol rating this is a drinkable sipping beer, and the alcohol is not noticeable in the taste making this a very dangerous brew. Very warming on a cold winter's night. Nice."
"Black thick and syrupy witha dense cocoa colored head. Has a sweet espresso aroma with notes of coffee, chocolate and tootsie rolls. Hops are also present in the nose. Really smooth and full bodied. Flavor is sweet, chocolatey with a subtle bitterness. Finishes with an alcohol warmth. Empty glass is left with nice even lacing. Very nice imperial, close to the Left Hand."
"Wow, this was a very decieving beer. I was not smart and ordered it without knowing the alcohol content. The alcohol was very discriminate in this brew. I could not even tell that it was 10%. It did me in for the night though. A very rounded Imperial Stout. It was nice and thick and looked great with a nice head. A great flavor followed the head. Exceptionally drinkable considering the alcohol content."
"Drinkability: Not an everyday brew, but great for a cool, autumn evening. I like this one a lot."
"Dark jet-black color, has a great tightly bubbled, creamy brown head that leaves a nice lacing in my glass. Sweet roasted chocolate, coffee and fruity aromas, sweet fruity plum-chocolate and coffee flavors. Nice burnt bitter-sweet finish. Medium-full body with creamy and smooth, oily mouthfeel, alcohol really shows as it warms, I like it."
"This beer is a dark oily black with a thick brown head. Nice lacing. Aroma of burnt chocolate and malt. Rich and a little syrupy with a bold coffee flavor, along with roasty malt, chocolate and raisins. The finish has a little bit of alcohol and hops amid the thicker flavors to keep it from being overbearing. This is a great Imperial but it is not among the elite."
"Dark black color. Small tannish foamy head. Aroma is chocolate. Dark roasted malts. Choclately and slightly sweet. Touches of smoke, vanilla and dark fruits. Nice balanced. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice example of an imperial without being over the top."
"Beautiful beer. Surpassed only by the Rogue Imperial Stout in the appearance department. Perfectly opaque black body is topped by a beautiful creamy brown head. Very oily pour. This beer actually has a little carbonation to it. The aroma is equally exciting with it's huge but balanced mix of black chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and butter. The flavor is somewhat of a letdown unfortunately. The chocolate remains, but seems unsupported by a good roatiness. The flavor is surprisingly mellow and soft given the aroma. It seems a little flat and one-dimensional. The mouthfeel is actually worth mentioning (an aspect I rarely feel worthy of comment in most beers). It's a very airy and creamy feel on the tongue. Quite pleasant and something that makes this beer feel lighter than it otherwise would. I feel uncomfortable giving this beer such a relatively low flavor score, but I'm comparing it to other imperial stouts. In that category, it just doesn't match up."
"Pours dark as midnight with a slight brown head. Fantastic roasted smell with accompanying initial flavor. The roasted malt flavor gives way to notes of coffee and mocha. Slight hints of alcohol start to nudge in but are quickly pushed aside by a delicious smoked finish. The drinkability is exceptional for a beer this big. Very enjoyable and you definitely get your money's worth."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep black color with half a finger of coca-cola colored head that dies away slowly. There is just a tad bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is of roasted coffee with a hint of mocha. The smell fills the nostrils nicely. The taste starts out with burnt malt, a little espresso, and leads to a trace of hops. A bit of smoke to the finish, but with a salty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, and pretty smooth too. The drinkability is a little low due to the 10% and aftertaste. You sure can't beat it for being free. Thanks to brewdlyhooked13 for a great present!"
"This brew poured a dark opaque colored body with a large head of dark brown bubbles that was mostly lasting. It had a strong coffee aroma as well as a very heavy strong coffee flavor with a very smooth finish. Another very fine beer I 'd like to have again."
"Very enjoyable."
"Originally sampled on 11 January 2003. Lots of roasted flavors w/ smokey overtones. Almost a slight saltiness to this beer. It""s a different Imp. It""s almost like a cross between an Imperial Stout & a smoked beer. Has some of the typical cocoa/coffee notes. I liked it. Thanks Hoprus"
"Definitely not a session brew, but one to linger over. A good US example, but not up to the level of say the Rogue."
"This beer currently is listed at 10 %, so I don't know if it varys from year to year. This beer poured pitch black with no light getting through it's dark soul whatsoever. It formed a dark tan head that left circular lace as it subsided. The aroma was of malt, chocolate and coffee with a slight hint of dark fruit. The flavor was of malt and chocolate. The finish was a medium body with a slightly burnt chocolate aspect to it. Not as much going on as some others like Bell's or Stone, but a fine imperial nonetheless."
"pours black in color with a light brown head. Smells strongly of coffee. Taste is like coffee also which some metallic notes. I'm marking it down a little for the metallic taste. Not as much flavor of dark fruits like other Imperial Stouts. Bitterness in the low to middle range for this style. An OK version."
