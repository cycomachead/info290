4.12,8.4,5,4.25,4,4,4,"Pours a pure pitch black in color with about a one-finger foamy/creamy beige head that hangs along for a while. A good amount of thick lacing is seen with each sip that sticks to the glass. The aroma is mostly of dark roasted malts, toffee and coffee. The taste is bold with lots of flavor of the above ingredients. A slightly dry and very light bitter finish is noted but doesn't take away much from this brew. Medium+ bodied with perfect carbonation for this brew style. The brew actually tasted better when warmed up as this is more of 'sipping brew' than drinking it down in a few minutes. Kick back and enjoy this one during the cooler months. Another tasty brew from the Sam Adam's folks. Cheers!","BeerWithMike","Dec 26, 2014"

Had the smell even. But the flavor tasted... I don't know, forced. Almost like some sort of artificial flavor was added. It left this starchy aftertaste too that lasted long after it was gone. Also, you can taste the alcohol in this one. Not that its a bad thing.

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is the old label, so it should be a few years old. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, toast, toffee, light char, molasses, raisin, dark bread, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, light char, raisin, dark bread, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, dark bread, raisin, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; with big flavor robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial stout. All around good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; with big robustness and very easy sipping. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 19, 2013"

Light sweetness of chocolate up front, with a dry roasted coffee finish. Subtle spice aftertaste - the anise perhaps. Smooth lightly carbonated thick body. Alcohol is well masked by the strong chocolate/coffee flavors. Very good beer with excellent body. Will definately have this again sometime.

There are some visible bubbles underneath the head, indicating some mild carbonation in the beer. The beer is completely opaque. There is some lacing left on the side of the glass. I detect chocolate, coffee, and toffee. The alcohol is not detectable in the aroma. There's a nice bitterness from the dark roasted malts in the flavor. There's the chocolate and the coffee notes as well, but the sweetness is very mild. The alcohol is well hidden in the flavor. The body is full with mild carbonation. This is a smooth RIS.

I've said it frequently, Sam Adams has a common failing which is the distinctive aftertaste of leather, Fortunately they are so prolific that they make plenty of beers that either hide this well, or completely lack it. And those beers are always amazing, which is why Sam Adams, when on point, can make an extremely enjoyable, unique beer. This is one of those.","BigBarley","Nov 02, 2012"

Dark malt, dark fruit, mild chocolate. Alcohol seeps in at the finish to diminish the other flavors, finishes somewhat dry and thin for the style. Medium body.

Smells mostly of dark chocolate but also contains a decent amount of roasted character with a smaller background levels of prunes and other dark fruits. Flavor leans more on the roasted malt side of the equation, with the black bitter coffee and dark fruits coming in second and third place respectively. I'm not really picking up on any of the anise flavor that everybody else seems to be getting. Body is on the heavy side, but smooth and soft enough to avoid becoming clingy.

The feel is very thick and chewy, one of the thicker beers I've had (off the top of my head only ten fifty is thicker). The taste is pretty good also, I get the dark roasted malts, a heavy coffee flavor and some sweetness, reminds me of a molasses type sweetness, there is also some alcohol burn. Overall this is a very good stout and one of the better (best?) beers from Sam Adams, although at $10 a 4 pack, Old Rasputin is cheaper and Green Flash Double Stout is the same price both of which I slightly prefer, so I'm not sure how often I'll buy this, but I'll occasionally pick it up, its a tasty stout.","DavidST","Sep 14, 2011"

It is a BIG Imperial beer, and as such, should be sipped slowly when you are not going out again. As a side note, it mixes beautifully (50-50) with a traditional English IPA (NOT an American IPA -- the English hops are complimentary, but the citrusy/resiny American hops would not blend well with the strong coffee and anise of these dark malts) to create an entirely different, but equally interesting beer. Note: I brew my own traditional English IPA, so unfortunately, I can’t recommend one, but I’m sure some research would yield good results. Otherwise, you might want to try blending this with a good English brown ale. It would lose some depth, but should be interesting, nonetheless.","G2Brew","Sep 05, 2011"

The beer has a nose of coffee, dark chocolate, and a little hint of booze. The aromas are very well blended, with a slight smokiness, also. The beer has a rich base of flavors, and initially you get the dark roasted coffee with a boozey highlight. As the beer crosses and covers your tongue, you will get more of the chocolate, and even a dark fruit sweetness, but just slightly. The beer is mid-bodied, but leaves a thick, frothy lacing on the glass while you drink. You get a decent warming from the ABV, also. The aftertaste is darkly sweet, with an overtly roasted chocolate character. The finish is slick, with a boozey feel, and it slightly coats the mouth a bit. Definitely a good winter warmer, and a decent stout overall.","GarthDanielson","Aug 15, 2011"

The first smell on the nose to me is almost that of sweet dark fruits and black licorice. Followed powerfully by deep dark chocolates and roasted coffee beans. Hints of cherries and vanilla also find their way into the swirl, a nice esspresso fudge brownie comes to mind. The taste also has the sweet dark fruits on the front followed by chocolate, toffee, alcohol, and finishes with a deep coffee taste. Full on the feel, bitter sweet, very sweet, syrupy, heavy.

My initial nosing was of all things rich and dark. Hints of chocolate, coffee and dark leather. My initial tatse found this brew to be a delicious mix of dark bitter chocolat ewithout being overly sweet. I found the brew to be almost creamy.

The smell is anise, rum, chocolate, some coffee and some alcohol. the taste is anise up front followed by some strong alcohol taste with some dark chocolate and coffee in the middle and finishes off with a rum like taste. This beer reminds me of Meyers Jamaican Dark Rum. The mouthfeel is sweet and sticky at first and than leaves the lips sticky and the mouth dry. This is pretty drinkable for a strong full bodied beer.

Has a hint of smoked hops that is followed up as the final flavor of grapes. Medium/Full bodied beer that is smooth going down and leaves a slight trail. That trail makes you urn for more. Isn't hard to finish the glass.","bilyboy65","Jan 04, 2011"

As such, I figured I'd give it another go and put my thoughts down. It pours a straight obsidian topped by a half-finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted wheat, buttery toffee, and wet cardboard. Hmm. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, chocolate, light molasses, and, near the end, a strange melange of sharp char, alcohol, and coffee. When this last wave hits, things go from good to not-so-much, ruining the experience entirely. The body is fairly hefty, with a very light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel.

That makes the drinkability less than a lower-ABV beer, but it's a good sipping beer to pair with food. A pretty nice Imperial Stout, but not better than others like Old Rasputin and Storm King.

On another level, this is about as long as I've ever taken to finish a beer...this shit's gross and hard to drink.

Taste was smooth, but had a surprising kick. Bit of sweetness to start, but finished with some acidic bitterness. Started off smooth and rich in the mouth, coated very well.

The aroma is of dark malts, deeply roasted and burnt, chocolate, some dark fruit and then a slight alcohol scent. The flavor has a sweeter feel and less astringent than I was expecting. Also noticeable is dark fruit, chocolate and possibly molasses. Slight hop presence but seems to get lost with the other flavors, which is not a bad thing.

It's easy drinking for 9+%abv. It does lack the hop character of a RIS. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer.

Pours pitch black body with a beige khaki head that really fades pretty quickly this maybe one of the biggest beers from Sam Adams I've had. Minimal speckled lacing on the sides of my glass poured into my Piraat chalice. Aroma strong fruit smell tart cherries or grapes come to mind off the bat, maybe a bit of plum or raisin on 2nd sniftt. Dark beer characteristics are here with a bit of dark chocolate accent. Flavor is kind of a mess, there's a big wave of fruit and tart sourdough bread that clashes from the first sip onward. Not much coffee or espresso just a bitter black patent malt force that jolts the back of the throat with the tart/sour fruit tone and alcohol burn. Not much cohesion or finesse in this bruting style from Sam Adams, kind of a shame. Mouthfeel doesn't hit right at all sits thin and cloying on my palate, nasty over ripened fruit note sits like it's spoiled almost induces a gag reflux. Burn of alcohol just adds to the trainwreck at hand. Stick to the traditional low alcohol styles that got you where you are. I used to like the Double Bock I haven't tried the new version, and I couldn't really stomach the Double White so far these two failures are pretty much strike outs in my book. Disgusting I'm pouring the rest out I haven't done a drain pour in a hell of a long time we're about due especially with this beer at the helm, lousy version of a great style.","WVbeergeek","Dec 13, 2009"

Taste actually was quite an accurate example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Bold flavors of dark chocolate, licorice, roasted barley and cocoa were right up front. Mouthfeel was a tad lighter than other examples of the style. Also, there seemed to be more of a sweetness to this beer than with others I had tried. I would have preferred it to be a bit more dry.

Not much evidence of light getting through any of the glass' corners. The head does recede with a little too much haste. Aroma is more standard stout than imperial, which is much closer to my expectations with this beer. Big notes of coffee with artificial sweetener, graham crackers, some vague dark fruits, and a nip of fusel alcohol. Flavor has a solid roasty character but no real heft to it. Body is a little thin and so is the flavor profile; this could almost be mistaken for their cream stout if it wasn't for the alcohol, which isn't apparent in taste but is definitely felt in warmth. Some lesser chocolatey notes float around but this literally tastes like an imperial stout cut with water, right down to the watery aftertaste.

Maybe or maybe not. The aroma is subdued for the style and leads me to believe it's something else other than an impy stout. The flavor is malty and clean. I like it, but it just doesn't taste like an imperial stout. In fact, it's quite smooth and mellow...tasting like some sort of rich, dark, malty lager. Who knows...this might actually be a lager? The strong roasty characteristics I associate with an imperial stout (or regular stout) are not up-front in this brew. This brew has a sweetness that overpowers everthing else. It is a clean-tasting (and enjoyable) sweetness, but this brew seems to be beyond anything I would normally associate with an imperial stout.

Nice roastiness to it too along with the complex chocolate, coffee flavor characteristics. Once again, that strong ABV is quite prevalent as you get quite the burn after each sip. Nice sipper beer, makes for a good night cap.. couldn't see having more than one in a sitting.

It tasted like semi-sweet chocolate and black licorice, with vanilla oak and alcohol and roasted coffee. Sweetened some as it warmed, to create a bit more balanced flavor. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was a surprisingly solid imperial stout, which was easy to see a high level of effort that went into the brew. It had a nice scent and taste, and great body. The alcohol was a bit hot, so this beer was definitely for sipping. But some age might help mellow this out and build a bit more unique character. It's not a terribly complex beer fresh, but it was clean and very enjoyable. Well done.","Pencible","May 15, 2009"

In the mouth, it's a little smoother than other big stouts. It has a rich flavor and feel without going over (apologies to Bob Barker), and the alcohol is hidden well. Rich chocolate flavors hit first, liek drinking Dove chocolate. A little smokiness and wood add complexity. Very warming in the throat and tummy.

Goes down big, somewhat smooth, and a little dry at the end. After a few drinks the sweetness becomes overkill.

Tastes of roasted malt up front, then a good amount of alcohol, some sweet malt, slight hop in the background, and some very slight raisin flavors. Overall, a really easy drinking Imp. Stout.

Sweet and burnt malt as well as licorice are the most prodominant aromas my nose picks up. Heavy and thick but not syrupy. It tastes like expresso, burnt Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate, and black licorice. There's a bitter but not too unpleasant aftertaste.

Weak mouthfeel, some may say even ""watery"" for the style, considering this is an Imperial Stout. Noticeable carbonation gives it a harsher feel as well.

Taste starts off semi sweet but then the roasted malts take over and there some decent carbonation going on. Seems like every other sip I get some fig or other fruit finish before the dryness ends it all. As far as drinkablity it's not bad.

The head is rather short lived and there remains just a bit of lace on the top, but there isn't much lacing on the glass. For the nose, I get a light chocolate and roasted malt sweetness. The small is nice, but nothing special when compared to other imperial stouts. The flavor is good, but lacks the complexity of the RIS's that I have come to love. The beer does have a nice thick and creamy mouthfeel with little carbonation. I only bought 1 bottle as I wanted to try it, but I wasn't disappointed as my expectations were rather low. I probably wouldn't get it again, as there are plenty of others of the style that I would choose over this. Overall, I enjoyed it and it isn't a bad beer if you aren't able to find other more enjoyable imperial stouts!","engisch","Apr 06, 2009"
4.03,6.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a thick used motor oil black color. The head is a half inch of tan foam which recedes slowly into a thick, firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of graham cracker, milk chocolate, and roasted malt. The taste is a lot like the aroma. It is bold, and well rounded. I would be no means say that this beer lacks depth, but it doesn't have that extra complexity that makes for a great imperial stout. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a nice Imperial Stout, and it is even nicer to see BBC doing some bigger beers. All in all, this beer reminds me a lot of a cross between Lion Stout and Old Rasputin. It has all the roasted malt and graham cracker of Lion Stout with the well rounded higher (but not to high) alcohol of Old Rasputin. I would certainly drink Samuel Adams Imperial Stout again when in the mood for a large, but not overpowering stout.","KarlHungus","Apr 06, 2009"
3.72,-2.1,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours nice and thick, almost a solid black, even darker in the glaass, but the head is short lived and there's no lacing. In the nose I get a lot of caramel, some burnt sugar, light chocolate and plenty of roastiness. Not really much in the way of coffee. Smells OK, but could use some more roasted malt and a bit more coffee that I've come to love out of RIS's. Really not a lot going on in the flavor. Sure it's loaded with roasted barley, some hint of caramel and chocolate, but that's about it. Rather one-dimensional. Mouthfeel is the best part of this beer, nice thick and creamy, richly textured, low carbonation. I'm on the fence with this one. It's not bad by any means, but can't touch the best of this style. I can think of 15-20 RIS's I would rather have. Uninteresting really, and probably won't be buying it again. I'll take a 4-pack of Old Rasputin for $2 cheaper any day.","KeefD","Apr 06, 2009"

There's a good presence of roasted malt flavors, with vinous fruit/alcohol and flowery hop flavors as well. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Carbonation level is mild, but on for style according to my very limited impy stout experience. I only had one bottle to drink, but would have had more if available.

The lacing is picture perfect, spiderweb like all over the sides of the glass. Smell is extreme sweetness with raisins, plums, and some licorice. Alcohol and fudge find their way in the nose as well. I could use a bit more in terms of roasted aromas and smokiness though. Taste starts off with a bit of a coffee bitterness, gooey chocolate sauce, and molasses. Licorice and some piney hops midway, this is definitely a fresh IS. Aftertaste has more of the dark fruit aspect with dates and figs. Once again though, could use more roasted flavors, but good overall. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a thicker feel. Carbonation is low making it slick in the mouth, ehhh.

Mouthfeel is sticky and creamy, body is thick, carbonation is a little on the high side for a stout. Overall I though it was a good drink. It's still kind of hot and I think the flavors need some time to meld, but I think a little time on this might make it fantastic.","johnnnniee","Mar 12, 2009"

Aroma is a subtle mix of all the usual suspects; roasted malts, espresso and cocoa. The taste is a nice smooth blend of roasted malts and bitter cocoa. The beer is a smooth and the 9% alcohol is very well hidden. This is an enjoyable Imperial stout, but there are certainly better ones out there.","atsprings","Mar 12, 2009"

Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, but carbonation is a little overstated. Some acidity is revealed towards the finish.

Little bit of hops at the end adds to the mix, leaving a lasting sweet bitterness that just lingers.

3.61,-5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"BBC's Imperial Stout's an okay beer. Easily above average, but not quite what I was hoping for. It runs a little too warm and is a little convoluted in terms of the flavor. I'd be interested to see what happens with some age on it. It really could improve. Who knows? It's definitely worth checking out, but it's a little bit of a disappointment.","prototypic","Feb 16, 2009"
3.95,3.9,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours jet black w/no head and minimal lacing. Looks super thick. Nose is cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, and coffee. Taste comes on a little hot, with a strong roast flavor with strong amounts of licorice. Is fairly thick, but not as thick as it looks. Loses some heat as it warms up and gives additional notes of vanilla and wood. Not the best Impy stout I've had, but not the worst either.","RomanW70","Feb 16, 2009"
4.2,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Notes: A solid stout. Bottle says it's 9.2% ABV. I believe I paid $9.99 for the 4-pack, which is more than what I pay for 4-packs of Old Rasputin, which outperforms this beer by a good amount. Recommended, but I wouldn't call it world-class.","Kendo","Feb 15, 2009"
4.36,14.7,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"great brew. I think a lot of the S.A.s have a distinguishable taste but this one does not have that typical S.A. signature. I think that this is a good thing. I love S.A. and this is just another reason to love this brewery. dark oil can appearance, nice dark tan head, taste of coffee, coco, and sweet malty goodness. Mouthfeel is good but not super smooth. you can't be disappointed with this one.","Johnkal","Feb 13, 2009"
3.98,4.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"D - While the alcohol being less perceived makes it more drinkable, I feel as if some time down in the cellar would do this one justice. I would like it to be a bit sweeter. Even though it's a different style, this is how I felt about their double bock (the original). Then I tried a three year old bottle that was amazing, the malty sweetness was out of this world. Only time will tell with this RIS...","AlcahueteJ","Feb 13, 2009"
4.12,8.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Grabbed a single of this new beer from Sam Adams tonight at Sav Mor in Twin City Plaza. Good pour brings out a black color, with a decent amount of brown foam heading. Nose is of Belgian chocolate, licorice, sweet cream, fudge...very very nice. Taste is fairly rich, with chocolate and espresso notes. It starts off sweet, and ends on a mildly bitter coffee note. Medium body for the style, but it makes up for it in taste, still feels big to me. Pretty quaffable, I like this Impy Stout from SA. Next time I will go for the four pack.","jamie2dope","Feb 13, 2009"
3.75,-1.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Notes: +1 for Jim Koch and the rest of BBC. They are really pushing the bounds of what can be a readily accessible big beer. The taste might have missed some of the hidden gems you often find in a good RIS, but overall a good accessible beer for the big beer lover.","BigIrishman","Feb 13, 2009"
3.17,-16.6,5,3,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability was a let down. The meaty and banana aroma scream yeast abuse, which is really surprising for the pros at Boston Beer, they've got plenty of experience brewing big beers. And the flavor is muddled, nothing shining through. Both recipe and technique suffer. I'm surprised they decided to release this and declare that it's a new, permanent year-round offering without apparent public tastings first.","BattleRoadBrewer","Feb 08, 2009"
4.44,16.8,5,3.5,5,5,4,"D - I find it to be a really rich beer, definitely a slow drinker. It's a great value for the price (9.99 for a four pack) and I will definitely buy some again.","bowersdm","Feb 07, 2009"
4.2,10.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a frothy 2 inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is roasted malt, coffee, dark/bittersweet chocolate, licorice and a bit of smoke. The taste is similar to the aroma, but I can also taste some oak/wood (even though I'm pretty sure this beer isn't barrel aged). It also has a good lingering bitter coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's rich and a bit creamy. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all. It could be smoother, but overall it's still an enjoyable brew. I think it's a good beer, hopefully SA will decide to make this again in the future.","bluejacket74","Feb 06, 2009"
