"Great dark brown brew with beautiful frothy khaki colored cap. Lacing up and down the sides. Licorice, roast, char, tobacco, and minimal chocolate make up the aroma. Taste is of roasted malts, ash, slight coffee with some cocoa mixed about. Not super thick but medium bodied enough for me to enjoy. This was overall a fantastic imperial stout that more than surpassed my expectations. Enjoy!"

"$8 RIS 4-pack and it's damn good. A few noticeable flaws but again, a great beer and especially so for the price."

"O: I picked this up because it looked interesting. I was extremely pleased. Never knew this existed. I will look for this again. Will probably do well with a little age too."
"Overall: It is an Americanized version of the classic RIS style. Not too bad and by far the best in their Big Eddy series so far. This 4-pack is from the 2013 release (Feb/Mar 2014 shelf time) so I'm thinking it has about a year of age on it. I'll try it again in a few months to see if things are changing. If they don't, I can certainly enjoy a few more of these. Not as good as other RISs I've tried but a nice offering from Liney's."

"Loved it. Aged for 1.5 years this is a great RIS."

"The flavor reminds me of black coffee.  Again, the post-grilling ash and charcoal show up in the swallow.  There's a touch of sweetness at the very end that lingers throughout the aftertaste.  Full bodied for the style, but not too much."
"passable, but something here i just dont like. its hotly alcoholic, way more than the abv should force, and way more than i think the style allows for, or should allow for, its distracting to a nice dark fruit and charcoal malt profile and i really cant get past it. it feels weird in the stomach and going down because of it, and im having a harder time enjoying the dark chocolate and vanilla and tobacco flavors in it. is there a touch of smoke to it? it certainly seems to pop up in the finish. others have described this as smooth, so maybe something was off with the bottle i had, but i wouldnt describe it like that at all, well, maybe texture, but certainly not in overall feel, it almost burns. the way paint smells this sort of feels, if that makes sense. still, i think the project is a noble one, and i think the beers isnt as bad as i am making it sound, but the alcohol exposure is a little much. looks amazing though, shiny black and heady forever. good to get a four pack of a style like this out there affordably too, which is probably this beers greatest merit."

"O:  A terrific sipper.  A very nice RIP that would go well with brownies or a chocolate chip cookie. I really think the aging helped it.  Would love to try a year in the closet."
""
""
""
"I know that this is a Leinenkugel brew, but this could be mistaken for a Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout in a blind taste test. This bottle aged well and was very tasty, so I would definitely have this again and would recommend it."

"Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co. Big Eddy Russian Imperial Stout -----3.5/5"
""
""
""
"Glass- Snifter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: One of the best I've had, especially considering it's father company! Curious as to how the rest will hold up over the next 6 months to a year."
""
""
""
""
"This is really an excellent stout across the board. The huge molasses note on the back-end, carrying with it a subtle metallic twinge, might put some people off, but overall this is a barley-forward, sweet, thick stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dangerously smooth, this is a rich, enjoyable RIS!"
""
"Solid Imperial Stout. Drank on tap at a bowling alley in Green Bay. Was easily there best beer on tap. Had huge notes of chocolate, malt, leather, maybe even a little tobacco flavor. I enjoyed way too many glasses of this stuff."
""
"O:  pretty decent imperial stout.  A bit on the bitter side for me.  Not quite sure if it belongs in this beer.  Decent beer though.  A sipper.  Strong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - worth every penny of the 83 cents I paid. I will be buying more. I actually like this enough that I'd happily pay $8 for a 4 pack."
"O: It is leines camouflaged in a pretty package. You know what you are getting. When I was in college... they were the best 73 man operation to get beer.... But this? It reeks of big business filling a niche. Poorly done on some levels... but fantastic at times as well. Going to drink the four pack over a few days at different temperatures. Tonight's was at what I assumed was a lovely 46 degrees. That should be fantastic for the type of beer. Maybe even on the low side. Hoping that my next attempt at 55-60 degrees is a little better. Unfortunately, unimpressed."

"Overall, this beer is much better than I thought it would be. Leinenkugel doesn't scream ""Excellence"" in my opinion, but this beer is solid."
""
"Meaty beefy big and bouncy! This 2012 edition of Big Eddy is excellent. Pours a thick black with a nice thick tannish brown head. Notes of chocolate, coffee, figs, and sweet malts. Taste is a lot like the nose. Chocolate and deep roasted grains up front with a coffee bitterness and sweet chocolate and deep roasted grains in the background with hops coming through on the aftertaste. One of the better imperials I have had, even better on tap. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, improves with warmth. Very nice and to be appreciated. Cheers!"

"Russian imperial stout From leinies ""Craft Beer line"" Big eddy . Good for them that there trying to show a little creativity with this IRS but it kind of annoying them pretending to be craft beer makers. This Is a IRS for people who don't normally venture outside of normal leines options like summer shandy or honey weiss. This IRS will not challenge your taste buds and ends up being pretty forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Moderate mouthfeel, even carbonation. Good beer, but just a bit too ashen for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall? Ignore ""Leinenkugel"". This ris is a force to be wreakoned with! Totally worth the price of the craft brew next to it."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel and finish are full and lingering in a fantastic way. I love this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a pretty good Russian Imperial Stout, but wasn’t quite up there with the best I’ve had. Still, it would make for a pretty good dessert beer or nightcap."
""
""
"O: maybe it was a bit more complex from the start but it's pretty smooth. Not terrible but certainly not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very surprising beer, I had low expectations, but this is actually very enjoyable. Only major complaint is the burnt finish"
""
""
"O: Insane that this product is the output of the same people that bring us the standard Leinenkugel lineup. The other average brews are just, thin and meh. This is fantastic."
"O-this beer has a kick to it , and the only thing keeping this from being a great beer is the burnt taste"
""
"Might have again; not a bad option if you come across it."

"A fairly well done RIS, though I did feel like the flavored could have been a bit more robust in the taste, which carried into the mouthfeel and wanting that to be a bit ""bigger"" as well."
""
"O - Surprised that Leinenkugel makes such a high end craft offering. Glad that a buddy picked this up for me. I'll keep an eye out for other Big Eddy series."
""
""
"Meaty roast with slight oxidation, sweet cocoa, tentative booziness, brulee'd creme, piney mint, currant, licorice root, and toffee notes. Age plays a little cruel, here. Flavors are smaller and more composite. Tanginess is somewhat unsuitable. The body is a wash; a hefty medium that detracts from the decadence. This new bitterness is a byproduct, and probably unintended or changed. Carbonation is medium-low with little play. There might have been a really good beer here a year or two ago. What I'm left with is still good, but not something I'd drink aged a second time."
"Overall- Pretty much just above average. Maybe age would improve it but I don't care to find out- I just want to be done with it. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you like cloying sweetness. Would probably be better cold."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good brew, for roughly twelve bucks a 4-pack it is definitely well worth your investment. Enjoy with your favorite glass....Salud!"
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice head, and some fair lacing. Nose is roasty and sweet. Bitterness and booziness overpower the characteristic chocolate and coffee components. Overall, this is an okay quaff."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good RIS, Dark black color, great smell, dark fruit tones with a nice burnt flavoring, and a hint of chocolate. This is definitely a must try for imperial stout drinkers, at 9.5 ABV, you can't go wrong.... One of my favorites."

"My first of the ""Big Eddy"" line.Poures nearly jet black except for just one small ring of ruby at the bottom of the glass when held right up to the light,a half finger creamy mocha colored head atop.Dark fruit with a slight sour tinge in the nose,a roasted nut note wich comes along with alot of the beers of the same style is there as well,odd no roast playing a role.Like drinking a liquid raisin at the first couple sips,oddly the roast is subdued as well as the chocolate,it's all about dark fruit and alcohol.I like this beer but it's one sided in the dark fruit category,still this is top notch from this brewery.Actually this is not the the first ""Big Eddy"" beer I have tried."
""

"The JLBC Imperial Stout is a big beer that is great for an after dinner aperitif. The beer pours an opaque black with ecru head that is not leaving much lace. The scent carries a light peat and earth. The taste is a strong rich taste bolster my slightly chocolate roast and espresso. There also is an earthy hint. The mouthfeel is a full body beer with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a decent stout."
"O - I was not expecting much from this beer, but was pleasantly surprised. A decent take on the style from a brewery that doesn't get a lot of love on BA."
""
"O) good but there are better Russian imperial stouts out there."
""
"o: Top notch stout for sure."

"O - 4.5 - The cool thing about this beer is the taste is so original, even within it's own genre. The big red wine flavor that it combines with Imperial Stout Flavors sets it apart. I'd include it in any Imperial Stout tasting to give some diversity to my line up."
"~Cheers"

"Saw this a my local HEB on the singles rack for $1.99 and decided to give it a try. Pours a solid black with minimal head, reminds me of something barrel aged. The nose is nothing but strong alcohol, kinda turns me off right away. The taste is much the same, some roasted malt but overpowering alcohol takes over. Iv have beers higher in ABV taste and smell milder than this. Glad I only bought a single of this, cause its horrible and I won't ever buy it again."

"Overall, this is a fabulous Russian Imperial. Unlike most brews, Big Eddy boasts a strong nose and rich taste without letting up an iota for the duration of the glass. Anyone that looks for a malt forward, sweet, rich, and impressive stout is sure to appreciate this one! I encourage anyone that happens upon this on tap or in a liquor store to not let this one slip through their fingers! I had this on tap at Bukowski's in Boston, and wasn't letting someone else buy it at my favorite liquor store! I even bought a little extra to age. I'll be back at a later date to review that!"
""
""
""
""
"If not for the pronounced herbal hop character, this would be a really fine imperial stout. Unfortunately, the bitterness masks the more delectable nuances of the malt. It's still very flavorful, and I'd be happy to have it again, but it falls just shy of balanced."
""
""
"Taste starts out with the roasted caramel malt, not as bitter as one might expect for as much as the roasted aspect was in the nose, in fact it's a touch sweet but doesn't come close to being cloying, dark fruit adds a nice complexity , body is nice and chewy, good viscosity, soft carbonation adds a smoothness."
""
""
"O - Very nice complex beer. My first from Leinenkugel. I am pleasantly surprised by this RIS. Overall this is a great stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice surprise from Leinenkugel. There is a lot of complexity from the malt. The big unsweetened chocolate tones really provide a nice backbone and counterpoint to some of the sweeter notes from the base beer. Definitely a pleasant surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I gave this a below average score, but I would drink it again if it were offered to me. It wasn't offensive, just not that good in comparison to some other RIS' that are just as easy to find and just as reasonably priced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd just like to add that the bottles I have are labeled 2012, so that could make a slight difference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think this beer has had some unfair reviews, but that's just my opinion. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Lots of chocolate and coffee, which I personally prefer. One of the reviews said it seemed like cheap chocolate and bad coffee notes, but I didn't catch that. Maybe I'm not experienced at picking out good coffee from bad coffee, or cheap chocolate from just chocolate, but either way I thought this was a delicious beer. Not the best imperial stout I've had, but certainly not the worst."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly easy to drink for such a strong beer. Tastes like something from Leinenkugel and not Anchor, Sierra Nevada or Stone, just a step or two below those brewers, but an admirable effort."
""
""
""
""
"Overall looks great, where is the aroma, taste is not bad but overall wouldn't have again. Half the fun for me in having some big stouts is just sniffing them and enjoying the aroma kind of hard with this one."
""
""
""
""
"Big Eddy has a thick mouthfeel, but it has a relatively high amount of carbonation. The drinkability is exceptional. You know what? Big Eddy RIS is actually an excellent and very unique RIS. A lot of Russian Imperial Stouts are a lot smoother and approachable than beer nerds like to hype them up to be. Big Eddy is a different story. This is a seriously intense beast of a beer, and I can see why someone could seriously dislike this. It's got a wallop of bitterness that stands up to the most intense double IPAs, but with a distinctively dark and roasted twist. True diehards of ""the style"" might call it rough or harsh, but the open-minded drinker (especially a die-hard IPA nerd) might find a lot to like from this one. Kudos to the folks over at Leinenkugel on this one."
""
""
"O: I'll give it some credit here, it's reasonably well brewed and an excellent effort from Leinenkugel's. I just don't really care for beers that make me reminisce about chewing on a big ol' stick of Twizzlers (or even worse, black licorice jelly beans...shudder...) Luckily, this isn't some black-licorice-jelly-beans jabroni in the RIS world, just a lower midcarder in the vein of Koko B. Ware. Put him in a match with Ted DiBiase (Old Rasputin) or the Macho Man Randy Savage (Founders IS) and he's just going to eat a pinfall in 3 minutes - similar to this offering."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: A decent RIS from a brewery that doesn't produce much drinkable beer. Would I drink it again? Sure, I'll be checking out other beers in the Big Eddy series."
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Big Eddy RIS appears black but upon further inspection is actually a very deep brown; the head is thin, creamy-looking and mocha in color. Nose is definitely that of a big beer! Fumes of alcohol, dark fruits like figs and dates, molasses and brown sugar, licorice; it's all in there. Flavor reflects the same complex, fruity-molasses alcohol whif of the nose. Alcohol is well covered but also mouth numbing. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy with a minimal yet creamy carbonation. Overall, I would say Leine's did good with this one! I'm always a fan of their beers but doing a big beer like this is a different game from the norm - great job Leine's!"
""
""
"O: Maybe some age will even things out, but as is it's a bit rough. Kinda odd how it can be so thick but still so solventy. Not quite as bad as I feared it could be, but that's only because I had pretty low expectations. The only reason I'd get this again would be for the academic exercise of putting one away for a few years to see if it evened out, but I can't really see myself bothering. They picked a tough category to compete in and there are PLENTY of better offerings out there."
""
""
""
"It is distinctive and goes beyond the ""coffee & cream"" bombs that pass for RIS. Should age marvelously."
"O- A good imperial stout. When I first had it I did not know it was by Leinenkugels. Was surprised at how tasty this beer really was."
"Bought from Tacoma Boys. Pours a dark rich brown with a tan head. Smells of malt, maple, chocolate and a slight dose of roasted coffee. Tastes are woody and roasted. Pretty comparable to the aromatic notes. Lightly sweet. Alot more carbonation than I have experienced with this style. Enjoyable but not the best I've had of the Imperial Stouts."
""
""
""
""
"O: i first tried Big Eddy at a hotsy-totsy tasting event & it was my favorite of the Miller/Coors offerings (yeah, big compliment). It does stand out as a BMC offering but lacks a bit of refinement to really be big-league chew. It's complex in a way that my BBQ sauce can be if I've had too many beers while cooking in the kitchen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm giving this a 4.5 overall because I don't know that much about russian imperial stouts. I didn't expect as much out of this beer given that leinie's made it. But, wow. I don't care who made it, this is great. If Big Eddy is the series to help keep their reputation in check, i'm on board. I would buy a 4 pack of this and share it with my homebrewing friends. I intend on trying the other Big Eddy offerings as soon as possible."
""
""
""
"Really did not like the taste of this beer. Hard to pin down exactly but it has a malty taste that is really objectionable, sort of like a cross between rubber and tobacco. Aging may improve it a little, but I still think it would be pretty bad even after 3 years."
"Very enjoyable."
""
""
"12oz. bottle served in a tulip. 2012 vintage. Pours one shade shy of black with a loose, quarter-inch, khaki-colored head. Head eventually disperses into a thin, tight band around the shoulders. Strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is a bit dull - artificial sweetener, suggestions of lactose, dark malt and a slightly vinous quality. Taste reveals more malt and roast, as well as brown sugar and treacle; however, the artificial sweetener present in the nose drops away. Additionally, the vinous quality present in the nose is also present in the flavor profile. Moutfeel is medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation, a light oily texture and some acidity. Overall, not a bad RIS, but it doesn't really come together fully for me."
""
""
""
""
"Strong espresso & dark chocolate flavor. A lot of the bitterness that comes along with those flavors are present, but it compliments the beer well. The beer reflects a nice ruby color along with the darkness that comes with a Russian Imperial Stout. Only complaint is that the alcohol isn't masked too well, which, in this case, effects the mouthfeel more than the taste. Overall, excellent, although certainly not perfect. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle. 2012 Vintage. Pours a black color with a thin ring of light brown head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet with some chocolate, earth, roasted malts and hints of vanilla. The flavor is sweet chocolate, dark fruits and malts with a bitter dark chocolate finish. Earthy with a bit of an artificial sweetener taste. Nice alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is thin. Overall, not too bad and not too good. Might be tempted to buy it again."
"Overall unhappy with this brew, did not realize the brewery upon purchase. Overly sweet and fake."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid RIS here folks. I will have to look for more of this in the future."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, slick, brown-to-black coloring with a thin, filmy ring of brown bubbling around the surface. Aromas of molasses, vanilla, a touch of earthiness, and an overbearing sugary sweetness. Flavors are muddled on a rich, creamy body. Fruity sweet overtones, with hints of banana blending along the dark molasses and earthy tones. Some bitter coffee and hints of booze create a slightly limp backbone. The body is great, but unfortunately the flavors don't match up to it. Slightly bitter, boozey finish, but not overpowering or cloying."
""
""
"O- Not the best RIS ive ever had, though, not the worst. Flavors just seem a tad off in some sips. All in all i wouldnt kick it out of bed"
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, The heavy emphasis on the caramel sweetness without a lot else going on makes it a bit too one-dimensional for me. Not a bad beer, just not my favorite example of a RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with a thin tan head. Excellent retention, and a decent lace. Aroma is of Alchol, cherry, molasses and chocolate. Body is thick with little carbonation. Taste is of sweet cherry, roasted coffee comes through as well. Very complex. Not a typical Russian Imperial Stout, but great tasting. Highly recommend a try."
""
""
"O: Not horrible, but not great. I can't say I would ever commit to buying a 4 pack of this, but I would be open to trying it again if offered. Leinenkugel's certainly went all out attempting this very ambitious style and may have fallen short, but I could definitely see this brew having an audience among the craft crowd a lot more than anything else they've ever come up with."
""
"This tastes like burnt wood chips thrown in the mash."
""
""
""
"Overall – Now I know that most of you automatically label this beer as sub-par as it comes from a more macro brewery, but I say this, give it an “honest and unbiased” chance. It doesn’t have the best flavor profile, although it is goo with a nice roasty and dark flavor with a good level of sweetness. The real great thing of this beer is its feel and smell. Its feel absolutely phenomenal with the smell being quite nice. Look past your preconceived notions and give this beer a honest go."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a three-finger khaki head that takes a while to fade to a ring leaving some lace. Totally black color, no highlights. Medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Molasses chocolate nose. Flavor is same molasses, chocolate and hints of dark fruit. $2.70 for a 12oz bottle from a Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
""

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Light tudor brown head, almost black body, low to moderate retention, mostly clear lacing. Aroma includes roasted malt, some malty sweetness, some coffee, touch of vanilla with a hint of alcohol. Taste has some hop bitterness, roasty with chocolate notes and toffee, slight alcohol note on tasting. Overall, a fairly decent imperial stout with no off flavors, just maybe not too memorable."
""
"Similar to the aroma there is a roasted dark malt taste but the fruit is not quite as noticeable. The moderate bitterness lingers a bit at the end. Quite good I will admit but there are better Impy Russian Stouts out there."
""
"Very drinkable impy stout from MillerCoors. The nose smells like a Dark Lord Jr. to me. Good for price point. Would have again."
"Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours a slick black, with a two inch dark tan head, that leaves a nice collar of lace on the sides. Smell is aggressive dark chocolate, roasted coffee, some licorice, dark fruit, and a hint of smoke. Taste is very assertive, lots of expresso, with hints of the other flavors from the nose. Body is on the larger side, perfect amount of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is very solid, reminds me of Ten Fidy and $5 less expensive. I am impressed and surprised."
""
""
"Overall: Very complex. Sweeter than most and way too drinkable for the abv. Almost drinks like a good Valentine's day cordial. If you typically like Leinie's you will like this. If you do not, I suspect you will not enjoy this as much."
""
"Much better then expected from such a large (near-macromicro) brewer.. Definitely worth a shot at $3/12oz. Recommended."
""
"O: An uneven beer, but still oddly drinkable. One of the better brews Leinenkugel has done."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy super dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, unsweetened cocoa, slight coffee, and a mild soy sauce aroma. Taste is much the same with a medium roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but nothing too special for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty rugged stout here. Very earthy and roasty but it has to be to stay ahead of the sweetness, which it does. I could sip on this by a campfire all night long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty imperial stout. Rich, sweet, and fruity. An impressive beer from a brewery I don't turn to very often."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, not the best representation of style, it’s not a bad beer but it’s not exactly what you look for in an RIS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Big Eddy Russian Imperial Stout pours dark black color, with a nice size tan head. There was a very strong bitter, black licorice type aroma. The taste had some coffee notes and some black licorice notes, then finished with a strange bitterness. The taste was a bit watery, and the funky bitterness at the end made this beer not too enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O - A tasty RIS with a solid flavour profile, incredibly well hidden ABV and provides for a memorable experience. My only regret is not grabbing a second bottle to ship to my western trading partner. Luckily I suspect I'll have a second chance to snatch one up on a trip in the future."
""
"This one has aged nicely: much better than it was last fall. Nice RIS, especially for the price. I recommend saving a few for posterity!"

"O: This is really a very good RIS. Very impressed with it coming from Leinenkugal's. I'd love to do a blind RIS taste test and see where this stacks up. I'd say pick it up next time you see it!"
""
""
"Pours dark black with a creamy mocha head that settles to a 1/2-inch head. Big aromas of dark chocolate, deep roasted malt, dark berries, and a touch of soy sauce. Really nice, comparable to Ten Fidy or Old Rasputin. Taste is similarly ""big", with lots of dark cocoa, coffee-with-cream, caramel, roasted nuts, and some old penny oxidation. Mouthfeel is nice and velvet-smooth, with a full body and lowish carbonation. Overall a solid effort from Leinenkugel's, it's nice to see them try something different."

"Note: 2011 vintage"
"O: Alcohol is extremely well hidden and this beer is pretty easy to drink. Definitely a sipping beer but one to enjoy."

"D - Not remarkable, but a solidly above average Russian Imperial Stout... I would gladly drink again and could recommend with a clean conscience..."

"Overall a good beer I recommend if you're looking for another RIS to try."
""
""
""
""

"Overall it's a strange sensation that you get a big fruit rush, and then a charring char taste mostly in the finish. Feel could be a bit better on this but I could easily drink this again."
""
""
""
"D - Overall, very easy to drink for any RIS fan; I really thought this was a quality drink, the taste lived up to the high expectations set by the first look and smell of the beer"
""
"The beer pours a black color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of dark fruit and heavily roasted malt notes, as well as a hint of soy sauce. The flavor is similar. I get a ton of heavily roasted malt and chocolate, as well as some dark fruit, raisins and soy. Medium to thick mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation."
"Drink- Just okay. Nice large stout as mentioned in a small bottle. I see this as a good gateway type of stout."
"Pours a dark, near black, quite shiny, thin cap of bubbly brown froth, little lacing. Scent big on roasted malts, light char with heavy dark chocolate, moderate fresh brewed dark coffee, light berry and dark stone fruit. Taste pretty much follows nose to a t - roasted malts with solid chocolate fudge, coffee with a splash of sugar and cream, bitter dark cherry, ends with light vanilla and berry. Only knock is mouthfeel as beer begins bubbly and prickly, opens up in flavor and thickens in body as it sits, but took a while. Overall, pleasantly surprised with this brew. Good to have a to style brew that doesn't need extra additions of chocolate or coffee or hops every now and again."
""
""
"O - Interesting beer and I have been looking forward to trying this for awhile, good for Leiny's for breaking into big beers like this. Unfortunately, the taste is a big blend of sweetness and everything mixes together in a sloppy sort of way right now. 'Have two more bottles and will cellar them and see where they go."
""
"O - I expected a lot more from this brew. The balance is simply off. There are a large number of things going for this beer, yet everything just is in improper proportions. If you like cherry stouts this is one to check out, but nothing extraordinary."
""
""
"M - Medium body, somewhat creamy. Light carbonation."
"Overall, a decent ris. It's a bit harsh, and simultaneously cloying, but I would enjoy this again. Better on tap."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with moderate-low carbonation. The effect this creates is that the beer initially foams up slightly, but not completely on the palate. It then reduces to a smooth feeling across the palate. Finish is dry and somewhat sticky as expected from sugary sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"Nearly full body, with a nice creamy feel. Some warmth provided by the alcohol. Overall, not bad but the sharp bitterness really takes away from a good opening note for me."
""
""
"O-pretty solid all around, I let this age gor about 6 months and I think that it helped it out, I tried one when I first picked up the 6 pack and definitely prefer the aged one"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was disappointed and scared from the scent of this one, but the taste redeems it. Easily the best beer I've had from Leinenkugel's and I'm looking forward to the other Big Eddy's now."
""
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: While this certainly isn't the best RIS that I've had, it pretty darn tasty. I'd buy this for the right price. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"(Overall) One of Leinenkugel's best, but still only decent by many standards. It's a pretty solid brew but comes through average on most of the flavors it delivers. There's nothing too distinctive about the beer as a result. I'd recommend it if the price is right, however. $5.50 for a 11oz glass is pretty fair. 3.5"

"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being below average. Overall it was a very flavorful and really good beer. I was really surprised by how rich and flavorful it was. It did feel a little overly sweet at times, but overall it was a very good beer."
"Fairly black in colour, maybe the lightest hint of a deep red around the edges when held to the light. Brown head with moderate density, somewhat creamy retention and ok lacing. Dark chocolate and bakers chocolate in the nose, subtler notes of dark fruits and brown sugar. Maybe even a touch of roast/smoke. Taste has dark chocolate in terms of bitterness, but a bit of creamy milk chocolate comes thorugh midway through the sip. Undertones of sweet dark fruits, with some sugary notes and quite a bit of roast, lasting long into the finish. Bitter and moderately drying palate, medium-heavy body. Good carbonation, smooth but sticky. Gets a little sweet at times. Enjoyable, without being too complex."
""
""
"Overall - The best, more legit craft beer that linenkugel's makes. Its bold, flavorful, well balanced and easy to enjoy. Solid and well done, its a little more on the sweet and creamy side then most ris, but still a great beer, worth a drink for sure."

"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown longneck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
""
""
"O - The label calls for three distinct hops in this; I don't pick up any hops at all. This is a straight-up malt bomb that's only balancing sweetness is roasted bitterness, not hop flavor. While the Leinie's Big Eddy release is certainly a beer to behold, and will probably surprise most Leinie's drinkers, it's a bit too roasted in my opinion, even with a year on it."
"pours out as brown as the bottle it comes in, but settles in dark as night. a thin creamy mocha colored head doesn't last long but there is ample lacing. smells very malty and hoppy, that's weird. the taste is almost sour, and that's not a good thing. has enough hops to be a black ipa, but there is a awful sour grain taste that overpowers. mouthfeel is too thin for a ris. overall this is very avoidable, do yourself a favor and do not seek out."
""
"The dark brown color while pouring evolved into an opaque black liquid sitting in the glass. The head was one finger thin, and light khaki in hue. The smell was subdued, and reluctantly revealed layers of bitter chocolate, coffee, licorice, and tobacco. The taste was approachable from the first sip, with a creamy mocha latte flavor. Only mid palette did the hop bitterness start to emerge, and the finish was bitter and grainy. Decent heft to the body, with a lingering warmth. Get this if you are in the mood for a chocolate laden nightcap."
""
""
"Most amazing tiny & tight bubble-head on the market. THIS IS THE HARDCORE BEER FOR HARDCORE MADURO SMOKERS !!!"
"Overall: Make this beer a little bit more roasty & chocolaty notes, give this beer the mouthfeel of Lienenkugel Creamy Dark, and you guys will have a real contender. Its a better than average beer; just doing my part and drinking local!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer was fairly tasty. Bringing out notes of a scottish ale more than an imperial stout. The only factor of the beer that was stout-like was the thickness."
""
"O - I missed the initial vintage of Big Eddy, but finally got a chance to try it. I have to say I am impressed with this one, very happy to see Leinie's put this out. I know some people on here will likely downgrade this one since Leinie's is part of MC, but for me, I can't deny the fact that it's a very good beer."

"Full bodied with good carbonation. Big Eddy is a solid and enjoyable example of the style. Overall a bit on the sweeter side but that's fine by me, a very good brew."

"12oz bottle, brewed Dec 2010. Pours opaque, jet black with a thin brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas are boozy and sweet, but more like cough medicine with some cherry and roasted malt. Tastes are boozy up front, with notes of cherry, dark fruits, roasted malt with the alcohol presence lingering. Mouth-feel is full bodied and smooth and finishes slightly dry. The first time I had this was when it was a one-off in 2008(?) and I feel that batch had better results. This one just seems off in comparison. It's still good, but there are better Russian Imperial Stouts out there."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, best by 4/25/2011(bottled Dec 2010). Pours pitch black with a nice 1-2 finger very dense tan head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some nice lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, dark fruits, apple, wood, light smoke, molasses, and caramel. Some nice and fairly complex aromas. Taste of rich chocolate, caramel, toffee, molasses, light fruit, coffee, roasted malt, herbal hops, and light smoke. Not much bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, herbal spiciness, coffee, and toffee for a good bit. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very nice creamy and lush mouthfeel. Very easy and smooth to drink at 9.5%. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed well after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial stout. Easy drinking; with rich flavor, and nice balance."
"O: This is one epic stout, I mean Top 5 caliber. Definitely my number 1 bourbon barrel stout for sure. Grab your self a sixer and slowly enjoy and share with only the best of friends."
""
"Overall, the flavor is great and the body is big enough to back it up."
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. The appearance, body, and nose are all spot-on for the style, but the flavors just fail to deliver. Rather than embracing the subtleties of the aroma, it sticks to being bitter. Otherwise this is a nice offering, but it's hard to ignore."
"O: A surprisingly solid, rich and delicious imperial stout--especially with a year on it"
""
""
""
""
"The flavor follows suit. Straightforward for the style. Simple and well executed. Lingering chocolate and roast flavors with a slight bitterness in the finish. A bit dry in the back as well. Surprisingly good, I'll admit this is much better than I anticipated. Recommended."

"I like this quite a bit. Russian imps tend to push me away with their sweetness, but this brew doesn't have that sweetness that I normally get deterred by. Dark chocolate and roastiness in the aroma, and the taste isn't much different, but the dark cherry flavor rounds it off nicely."
""
""
""
"O: Not a fan. If it's going to be this thick, it needs just as big of flavor layers to back it up. Wouldn't purchase or drink again given an alternative."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a good stout, but it's a tie between this and the Black Chocolate Stout. This beer looked and smelled nicer than the Black Chocolate Stout, but that beer tasted better and had a slightly better mouthfeel."
""
""
"The poured out as a rich thick looking black brew with a moderate sized brown colored head on top. The retention is a little on the thin side after a while. The smell of the beer is sweet and boozy, it has a light roasted aroma. The taste of the beer has a solid roasted burnt flavor with a nice long bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer was pretty good, I feel that it was a bit too light bodied but that's only if I'm really picky. The beer is smooth and nicely carbonated. Overall this beer is very impressive from Leinenkugel's. This is something I would have never expected from this brewery. I found it to be impressive."
""
""
""
"An average Imperial Stout. Not the best, but an easy drinker for the alcohol %."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fairly solid effort for the brother Leinenkugel. Some tweaks could make this a really nice and affordable local offering. As is, it's a pretty good beer."
""
""
"The lack of depth in the flavors hurt this one, but it's definitely worthy and a solid attempt at the style. Worth checking out."
"Had this at Flood in Stroudsburg PA. Very good beer I hope they start carring this in Rhode Island soon. As far as how this would compare to other RIS beers, I'd say that it's a fair representation of the style. It's not a 12 percent monster but it's a lot better than others that I've had. Very tasty."
""
""
""
"Overall I think this was pretty good beer. I don't think this stands up to the ""big boys"" in this category though. I think this would be a great transition beer for someone that is thinking about leaving the dark side. ie BMC. I could see this leading to beers like the Abyss and Stone IRS. Thanks to SMason for this bottle."
""
""
""
"I recall this being “fair” price wise, though in truth I really can’t remember what I did pay for the bottle."

"Serving: Bottle poured into chalice."
"Overall impression: A big, slightly sour Russian Imperial Stout. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty nice stout overall, lighter in body then the bigger RIS, but a nice transition between an American and Double or RIS."
"Overall this seems a lot like ""The Czar"" because of the bittering hops increasing molasses flavors which really isn't my thing. Will not have this again and truthfully can't even find it around my town..."
""
"Taste is really nice with roasted malts, chocolate, a nice balanced bitterness. A nice body with good mouth feel. It is pretty sweet. Didn't notice the alcohol at all and it says quite strong. This is a very nice stout and quite easy to drink. Usually, I like stouts for the strong taste but are not always the easiest to drink. This one is dangerous."

"Dark brown, inky colored body with a pretty looking, dense dark cocoa milkshake head that leaves sheets of fine lace on the glass. Molten fudge, cocoa powder and fruity hop notes in the aroma. Big roasty, RIS flavors of Fudge, coffe, anise and an underlying charred bitterness with noticable hop flavors in the finish. Full bodied and silky smooth with a long finish. A fantastic beer that proves Miller can actually make good beer if they want to."
""
"Overall I thought this was an Ok RIS but it can't hang with some of the better beers of the style. The flavors started off very similar to most RIS's but then the roasty charred flavor gets a little out of hand and stuck out the most giving this beer a pretty bitter burnt taste. This beer has good drinkability I should have no problem finishing off this bottle, the alcohol was hidden well and not much of the 9.5% was noticeable. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it smelled pretty on par for an RIS and it had some nice complexity to it. What I liked least about this beer was that the burnt malt flavor was the most dominating in the taste of this beer, I would have preferred to have more robust chocolate and coffee flavors, the mouthfeel could have been a little better also. I would drink this beer again but I don't know if I would buy it again, I would much rather prefer an Old Rasputin to this beer. This is worth a try if your a big RIS fan but it doesn't compare to some of the better beers in this style. I like the fact that Leinenkugel took a shot at making a bigger beer which is much different from their regular lineup, but when I compare this beer to other RIS's I have had it just doesn't stand up and show the same amount of balance and complexity. I am glad I finally got to try this beer, but it falls in the middle as far as RIS's go, but I am still interested to see if Leinenkugels can produce a top notch big beer."
"O – Mixed emotions on this brew, not firing on all pistons. Sweeter than my personal preference and that is the primary reason I’ll skip it for a different RIS… an OK beer. 3.5"
""

"O: Very nice stout. Surprised that the same people who make the ""Summer Shandy"" could make this beer. Nice flavor profile, maybe a bit boozy on the back end. Certainly a beer for cold winter nights."

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Beer pours jet black with a thick, two finger coffee tinted head that recedes rather quickly. The nose on this is pretty muted. Or perhaps it's my sniffer. Might revisit this aspect of the review with one of the three remaining bottles. From what I can gather, however, it's pretty roasty, malty, and has some hints of chocolate. The taste has a certain fruitiness to it. Cherries, figs...not quite sure...but the sweetness is a fruity variety. Subtle woody notes, alongside of vanilla and a touch of alcohol make an appearance. The mouthfeel is way smooth. Very silky, with a slight remnant of alcohol lingering behind. Overall, this is a fine stout. It's nice seeing a BMC beer come through for a change."
"Pours a black color. 3/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of oatmeal, hint of dark citrus, and a hint of maple syrup. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, roasted malt, hint of coffee, hint of hop, slight sweet malt, hint of dark citrus, hint of maple syrup, and a hint of oak. Overall, good appearance, aroma, complexity, blend, and great body. Lacking in roasted malt or hop bitterness."
""
""
""
"An above average Imperial Stout. I was surprised that Leinenkugel could produce a beer of this caliber. As the description says, this beer does age well (with one year on it now). Certainly worth picking up and giving a try."
"A decent Imp Stout, doesn't compare well to the best, but easily the best beer I've had from these guys"
""
"Cost: $10.99 for a four pack."
"Not a bad effort as it certainly has some nice flavors. I really enjoy the chocolate malt bill; however, something just seems off here. The ashy, salty finish is becoming more overpowering with each sip and the bitterness is oddly misplaced. I'd like to try it again to see if my palate reacts differently, but I wouldn't go out of my way."
""
""
"A lot of what I'd hope for in a Russian Imperial Stout is present here - the massively rich dark roasted malts, luscious body, and enough drinkability to keep me sipping. Well done."
"Overall - Perhaps I'm a bit biased here, but I LOVE all of the flavors in this beer, especially they way they are combined. I find this beer complex and very well balanced, and actually has notes of sweet, salty, sour, bitter and dry all in one beer. I will ALWAYS have this beer in my fridge, for as long as it's available. Two thumbs way up for me, can't believe this is Leinies! It certainly isn't the Leinie's price either, but well worth it in my opinion."
"Overall- The guys at Leinenkugel's took a good stab at the RIS style. This is a decent beer, but it strays much too far on the sweet end with not enough hop/burnt grain character to balance it out. With a little tweaking, this could really be a great stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: a great beer. if you like more charcoal flavors, this one will be better for you. i didn't mind them, but didn't love them. great aroma to this one tho. definitely leine's best brew!"
""
"I would recommend it, and I would certainly have it again if offered."
"Pours a viscous black with a small head. Smells very sweet with notes of dark fruits and super sweet chocolates. The taste is similar. Very sweet with lots of chocolate. Some figs and sweet leather are in the palate too. Ends with roasted a little bit of dark chocolates. Silky, smoothly body with a medium body. Pretty solid RIs. Sweeter than most but that gives it some uniqueness. Recommended!"

"O: A pretty good imperial stout, glad I tried it. With all the other stars in this style, it's probably not one I would return to very often, but I have to say it's easily the best Leinie I can remember having. Worth a try."
"Pours out a dark brown hue with a thick tan head that quickly disappears leaving really good retention and beautiful lacing along the glass. The nose consists of roasted coffee and dark chocolate along with some licorice. The taste starts out with with roasted coffee, some dark chocolate followed by licorice and some sweet malts. It finishes off with a roasted chocolate, licorice and vanilla and has a bitter chocolate aftertaste that stays a long time. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but yet a bit on the thin side. A really enjoyable beer to enjoy and savor the flavor. This beer is by far the best I have ever tasted from Leinie's."
"Dark near black with a couple finger thick mocha head. Minimal lacing. Roast heavy aroma, chocolate and licorice. Fairly sweet flavor, with background of roast and smoke malt, dark chocolate, ash, and mild bitterness in the finish. Soft, medium body with a slightly thin finish. Better than expected, but something I need to have again."
"While nothing extraorinary, this is pretty tasty beer from the folks at Leinenkugel."
"The final verdict is that this is a great stout in all respects except consistency. Ulitmately it is in the ranks of really good, not quite great stouts. Far and away the best Leinie's I've had, and while that's damnation by faint praise, this is still a compliment. Given that Leinie's has always been a brewery that makes brews designed to be adequate and achieve mass non-discriminating consumption, this beer is a bold and welcome step."
"Slight coffee up front on the taste. Caramel and cocoa come and go, a bit boozy thins out the stickiness. The sharpness isn't quite managed as it becomes metallic and something like oily. The flavors are nice, but with the abv where it is I would like more robustness. Not sure if age would help on this. Vanilla and caramel linger and smooth out."
"Feels dry, powdery, and warm to the finish. Not a bad brew for a mass producer of beer. Leiny's is hit or miss sometimes, and I think they did quite well on this beer."
"Overall: a great value beer with strong, bold, complex flavors."
"O - My new favorite brew by Leinenkugels, but that's not saying too much. Regardless, this is a fine offering - seek it out if you are looking for a good RIS that won't break the bank."
"Thick mouthfeel and only a slight note of the alcohol. Overal, a very decent RIS and a surprising offering from this brewery."
"Overall – Sweet though not overly. Odd soy sauce and charred flavors. No alcohol flavor or warmpth to speak of."
"O- i liked this RIS very smooth and tasty ABV well hidden will drink this again"
"I don't give a Schlitz for Leinenkugel's Big Eddy."
"Not bad, could use a bit more creamy body and maybe toned down on the sour flavor, but still a solid RIS and one that I enjoyed. Worth picking up, especially because I didn't think of Leinenkugel's as a very reputable brewery. But this was ok."
"This beer pours a dark India Ink black with mocha highlights when held up to the glass. Just a bit of a head is present with a vigorous pour. Just a little head sticks around on the sides of the glass. Pretty standard stuff for a big stout. The aroma is chocolate up front. It reminds me of what a Hershey's dark chocolate syrup would taste like. Sweeter dark chocolate with a bit of ripe cherries. Just a hint of booze on the tail end of the aroma. The flavor is similar. Dove sweet dark chocolates. Hints of sweet cream. Dark, ripe cherries with just a bit of date. There is a odd flavor that i cant put my finger on. Almost reminds me of a band-aid/plastic on the finish. The booze is hidden very well. Its really completely hidden. I would have never expected it to be a 9.5% stout. The mouthfeel is decent. I wish it was a bit creamier/oilier. Overall, its a good stout. Nothing to write home about but something I would order occasionally."
"Pours a pitch black color with a frothy milk chocolate brown head. The scent is great with the mixture of malts and hops that are used. there are a lot of sharp flavors to this beer. You expect a heavy robust malt taste which you do get, but it's over powered by the bitterness of the beer. It's interesting to get a robust and bitter taste at the same time. Definetly not like any other Russian Imperial Stout that I've had before to say the least. Also a little too watery that makes for fast drinking which isn't good with a 9.5%abv...or maybe it is."
"O. - nothing truly remarkable but real easy to drink and a solid brew."
"This was an outstanding beer. Besides for everything I mentioned above, I am also a sucker for Imperial Stouts and tend to rank them higher than other varieties of beer but still, this was a great example of an IS."
"Drinkability is fairly good for a beer that gets close to 10% ABV. Good tastes to this but the beer goes down pretty easy. An above average RIS that is worth going out to try in its limited time."
"o - overall a bit too over the top for me. this is a night finisher."
"O: Easy to drink and above average"
"Are there better Russian Imperials out there? That goes without say. But for a Miller/Coors made RIS, I was happily surprised."
"Not an awesome RIS but considering a 4 pack was about $10, not a bad value either. Not something I would seek out but a good beer."
"Overall: Solid stuff, but pretty oxidized for a recent beer."
"D: A nice sipper, there are others that are better but this one is great. Glad to try this one."
"""Taste"" delivers initially, helped significantly by good mouthfeel. The carb lingers a bit long and pollutes the aftertaste, bringing out some slight booze and astringents."
"T:"
"O - Suprisingly a pretty nice beer. I haven't been too impressed with other beers from Leinenkugel's, but this one is worth buying again."
"O - a good example of the style."
"O - Just a ""Plain Jane"" RIS in my opinion. Flavors are bland and nothing extreme."
"O - This was a tasty beer and while i don't think its the best example of the style, i think its great tasting. When i compare it to other beers in the style this one is very average. The fruitiness is unlike any other RIS i have tried and i give it extra points for that. I'd drink this again."
"Overall: A pretty good attempt at a bigger beer from Leinenkugel's. It could of been a little stronger in the body and chocolate and coffee flavor, but the dark fruits and anise is appealing."
"Fuller body, lighter carbonation, a bit oily, and very lasting on the tongue. A fairly decent stout and nice roasted quality, but falls by the wayside of many contemporaries."
"O: Having had several variations/styles from this brewery that never really impressed me, this was not to bad, though really cant hang with the big boys by style its nice to see one of their beers actually have some reminisce of flavor which lacked in their other beers I sampled. Decent big flavor, though a bit sweet and syrupy and not blunt and bitter, drinking more like a hearty sweet stout with flashes of spicy alcohol. Good for a try."
"O - While I didn't ""love"" this beer I did enjoy it. It had a nice berry component you don't get very much with bigger stouts. Good but far from great."
"Cheers!"
"O - Not a bad stout, but short of my expectations of a RIS. Possibly rest one for a year?"
"Poured nice and black. Smells of chocolate and fruit notes. Mouth feel is a good balance between carbonation and that thick viscous feel; though i think a wee bit more of the carbonation than i like. Taste is refreshing on a hot day; notes of chocolate and fruit just like the smell. Overall, as one who really steers towards RIS's, this one is a winner. I feel this is more drinkable then Rasputin and a few others as their is more flavor overall. An excellent brew; will keep this one on the top 10 of my favorite RIS's."
"O - I know a lot of folks knock Leine's but I like their stuff for the most part and this one is certainly no exception. I like it and it's a good one for this particularly chilly damp late night. Solid, not knock off my socks good but enjoyable!"
"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a Duvel glass with an inch thick tan head. On the nose I get some nice dried fruit, some molasses, and some subtle chocolate notes. As the brew warms, I get an anise almost licorice aroma. Dedinitely something I haven't smelled before. The taste gives me an interesting ashy component with some robust dried fruitiness. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, but seems to have a bit too much carbonation. I think this could use a bit more time in the bottle to mellow out. Overall this beer seems to have all of the components of a good RIS, but it doesn't seem put together enough quite yet. I'd advise leaving this in the bottle for at least another year before having another taste."
"I'm pretty impressed by this one considering I had no expectations for it. It's a touch hot, and the mouthfeel could use more work, but it's a nice hoppy stout."
"This ale pours black with a creamy mocha head. Good retention and good lacing. It smells of roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and burnt sugar. The taste is pretty much what I expected. Not very robust but good and the nose matched the tongue. There is a slight booziness and the slight hoppiness isn't welcome. Full body with medium carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Good, not great. Best offering I've had from Leine."
"12 oz bottle thanks to a trade with mnbearsfan. Poured black with a two-finger, mocha head with good lacing and retention. Nose is roasted malt, some nuttiness, molasses, and a tinge of alcohol. Taste is very sweet up front - chocolate, roasted malts, licorice and some dark fruit. Some coffee, mild bitterness and alcohol in the finish. Texture is thick and syrupy. This was a nice sipper I would try again."
"O: Surprisingly decent, not great but good, burnt flavors, nice bitter malts, nice chocolate and malts, could use a bit of hops."
"This is a good stout. I was unable to find any dates so it's age was uncertain, considering there were a few secondary flavors coming through (particularly the smoke/bacon quality) I believe this beer was probably a year old or so. That being said I don't have a desire to hang on to another one past a year, but I'd happily drink one if offered."
"Overall a good quality beer. Not over the top and I enjoyed it. Not sure if I'll buy it again, but I'd drink it if somebody else bought it."
"overall - this beer is up there with the best - i just wish it would have hit shelves around me - maybe next year"
"Overall not a bad beer, glad I got it on sale, probably won't buy again, even at that price."
"O- Really impressed by this offering from Leinie's. I picked this up on a whim on ""clearance"" at my local store for 6.99 for a 4pk and I think it's a great deal."
"O: Not very complex to me. One is enough for me."
"Shared during a small Charlotte BA tasting with marine1975, caSSino, CarolinaKevin, and GehenHerzog. Big thanks to GehenHerzog for bringing this one to share! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured black with a half finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, peach, plum, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, plum, slight roasted malt, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The aroma on this one really struck me as strange. It was really hard to pick up on the notes on the aroma too, so I was really surprised to find peaches and plums. The flavor was nice and smooth though which made it decently enjoyable. Glad I got to try it, but doubt I would go out of my way to do so again."
"I may have been a little heavy-handed in my pour, given the massive two-plus fingers of deep-brown head that I created. The beer actually seemed to be cascading for a moment! It looked like the top of a chocolate milkshake. Nose was rich with a deep, dark chocolate roasty sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a very smoky, charcoal flavor initially, somewhat medicinal in its bitterness. I feel left out on this one, since I am not a big fan of the style to begin with and I just am not liking this particular iteration. It was bitter, but in a burnt, not hoppy way and I just could not get behind it. Finish left me feeling like I had been drinking charcoal water. Oof."
"If you ever see Big Eddy on tap, keep buying it and call someone to help you get your butt back home."
"D: Goes down relatively easily, tasty, filling, good kick, not a bad representation of style. This was an interesting RIS - not as robust as most in the style, really takes on more of the sweeter side with dark fruits. I think this is a one and done for me, though for those looking for a sweeter RIS with kick, this isn't a bad choice."
"D-interesting imperial stout, goes in a slightly different direction. a little sweet in the finish and the green apple is very different."
"EDIT (1-6-11) I just opened a bottle of this from the first batch and didn't realize it. I forgot about the old label. Anyway, when I was drinking it, I knew something was different because it tasted so much better. This beer reminds me of darkness 08 or 11. This stuff is great. RICH and creamy. Very smooth. A nice coffee roast, a lot of chocolate, and a nice mix of dark dried fruits. Leines should have kept this beer a small batch series and made more like this. At the price point that this once was, you can't beat it. I wish I had more of these. Oh and the best by date was: 03-09-08. Only 4 years past its prime haha"
"This is a pretty decent beer. My first Leinie, and it's pretty good. I wish I would have grabbed another, so I could age it and see if the alcohol notes mellow out."
"Drinks well enough for the style. A rather nice beer."
"D: This one has some rough edges. I'm thinking a good year will make this very drinkable."
"D- overall, very easy and smooth"
"This is one big, thick stout. The graininess, ash, and light tartness detract but otherwise a real beast."
"I dunno this beer isn't all that bad, IMO. All the flavors and aromatics fit the style and overall the flavors are pretty tasty. The bitter finish is a little much, getting to an almost metallic character. Too much hops? Surprising for a company that generally brews to the lowest common denominator. Although I suppose a lack of experience brewing a style like this may have led to the imbalance? Too much bitterness from the roast malt, but they didn't adjust the bittering hops to compensate? Or not."
"Drinkability - Not something that I feel a need to drink again. Not unpleasant just kind of forgetable."
"Drinkability is good. The chocolate bitterness and the smooth finish make this beer worth trying."
"I was happy to have tried this, I think I passed by a review of it at some point but had never seeked it out. Would definitely drink again. Nice job by a big brewery"
"Its not bad, but its nothing I'd search for again."
"D: love the nose, taste - not so much. Although tolerable, this is not particularly nice as a RIS."
"drinkability is great for s ruskie. Not to sweet and not to heavy. Overall a solid well made beer that could benefit from some more prominent flavors. Glad I got to try this Wisconsin brew. Thanks Jason!"
"The drinkability suffers a bit due to the aforementioned chinks in the armor. Not a huge proponent of this beer in the grand scope of the market. Jacob, you cheapskate!"
"D: A nice sipper, but not outstanding in my book. Glad to try this one."
"Aroma is strong and oily with a rich overtone of smoky molasses and firm hints of semi-sweet chocolate and quality roast coffee. It pours opaque sable just a shade above black with a thick, fine-bubbled, peristent tan head. Flavor is like a sweet mocha with tones of smoky wood and hints of molasses and caramel as well as a hoppy-bitter undertone. Texture is smooth and fizzy, alcohol bite is subtle rather than fierce, and finish is rough and tingly."
"Drinkability: I won't knock it for being a product from a large-scale operation. It's a reasonably good attempt at a RIS, a bit thin, but made unique by it's misses, it's reasonably priced, and drinkable."
"Nice brownish blackish color with a brownish head. Taste of coffee, chocolate among others. Smells heavenly. Very crisp feeling in the mouth and smooth drinkabilty going all the way down. Definitely a good beer to have a good day or when you had it up to your eyeballs at work"
"D: Though disguised well, the alcohol keeps it from being really drinkable in quantity."
"Although the tartness of Big Eddy reminds a lot of Expedition, Big Eddy doesn't even seem like a RIS at this point. It's dark and black alright, but the roast is entirely missing. The acidity is all fruit and no coffee and that comes as a disappointment. A good beer, and perhaps the best to come from Miller-Coors, but not what the label promises. Warm temperature is perhaps the true test of a beer, and Big Eddy has lost all its ""bigness"". While it could have been a decent something else, it sure doesn't have the mouthfeel to live up to the tag of RIS. The alcohol seems solventy at times and the spiciness gets overwhelming. Very very average if viewed as a stout."
"D- The alcohol is not apparent and it is pretty unique. A bit of a sipper and definitely worth trying."
"The bottom line for me is that for a $3 beer, this is solid. I think it is worth a shot, a little different than a Founder's or Storm King. Good thing I live in WI, where it is cheap and plentiful!"
"D: Being so complex, this is a sipper, and one I couldn't possibly enjoy in great quantity."
"Drinkability - not quite as stout as I was expecting from the style, maybe because of an overabundance of malts? Still decent tasting."
"Thicker than expected too, not Dark Lord sludge thick but still substantial feeling. This is definitely the best I've tried from them, and it could easily compete against long-time RIS favorites. Absolutely recommended."
"The mouth is creamy and smooth. Good finish. Spot-on for the style. Sweet chocolate flavors start this one off, move on to some licorice, plum, and hazy booze. This is a really easy sipper. The best I've had from these guys for sure. It's an accessible big stout that will cure my ""big beer"" fix any day."
"Edit: the burned qualities seems to leave after a while (unfortunately after 3/4 done) and the last bit became much better."
"Overall this beer is great but not quite what I would consider to be among the best in the style. Definitely worth buying extras for the cellar."
"Big Eddy pours out really bold black dark night sky with a dark tan head mocha like foam that raises up and dies into a cap leaving nice patterns. smell is roasted malt up front, dark fruit some chocolate. The fruit comes out and I get hints of a certain Jamacian stout, meaning some rotting may be a coming, I'll be drinking quick. Taste is a nice roasty stout that has nice stout characteristics mentioned above and some too much, namely the dark fruit. The feel is very thin for the style and needs a boost to keep things in check. Above medium, but not chewy enough for style, carbed nice. Glad I tried this one, needs a bigger build."
"D- For me, this is my favorite RIS that I've had apart from the Yeti. It is an exceedingly easy drinker, too. Hope that they brew this more frequently!"
"D- wow they made this, way to go leiny. Way better then the rest of their brews. All in all its a tasty and quite drinkable imp stout. Its not blow your mind world class stuff but solid and enjoyable. Ill be sure to snag a 6er next time around."
"I've had this on-tap a few times so I picked up a four pack to give it a review. Ok, but I prefer a little more chocolate flavor or sweetness in a big stout. Kind of astringent bitterness in this one turns me off."
"This beer certainly pours like a big RIS. Its thick out of the bottle and clings to the glass giving me a brown tinted snifter. The head caps it off with a great head for the style. Right away I can tell that this isnt your typical joke of a beer that Leinenkugel has been churning out lately. This is the real deal. The aroma grabbed by attention with a robust sweetness of licorice and chocolate drizzled figs and raisins. Brown sugar and leather make appearances as well. The taste is very nice. I like when a beer is made well enough to define the line between Russian Imperial Stout and American Double Stout. This one is clearly an RIS. Nice deep fruitiness with licorice, leather and a sturdy hopping. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. This single I received has made me consider buying more."
"D: Definitely drinkable, but I probably will not be buying another. There are too many other RIS's out there for me to explore."
"D: On the lighter side for the style, though this one isn't a beast to work through. However, this beer just lacks complexity and falls a bit short of the mark."
"Drinkability - This is nearly as far away from a Leine's as I could imagine a beer being. No sweet watery fruit. No overly subdued interpretation of a mildly non-pilsener style. This is bold and flavorful, if not the best in category. I'm glad they try once in awhile."
"D: This beer is pretty drinkable, especially for 9.5% I personally would only be able to do one of these at a time, but still pretty drinkable."
"Bottle. From the most recent release. Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown/black color with a dark tan tightly bubbled head. Some lace as the head settles down. Dark roast, mild dark chocolate, tobacco, and almost a vegetable like aroma in the nose. Some booze also evident in the nose. Mdeium mouthfeel, too light in my opinion. The first flavor I notice is some mild smokiness that sticks around the entire time you take a drink. Sweet dark chocolate flavor along with some boose and dark chocolate bitterness to end this. I can't say that I am falling in love with this one."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is a half inch of tan foam that recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, alcohol, cocoa, and hops. The taste is similar with tons of roasted malt, and a bitterness that is firm but not over the top. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer that I will drink many more times in the future."
"A good version, there is just a lot of quality competition in this category."
"I am not very well seasoned with stout, yet, so I am going to have to leave this as just a comment for what it is worth."
"Like a hunter after too many rounds: I get what they were shooting for but I think they missed... and that's OK 'cause we're just here to have fun & drink some beer. Seeing as this my third RIS tasting this week I am forcing the bronze on this one."
"What a nice surprise this beer was. I had heard that it was pretty good, but I was a little dubious. A well crafted, very tasty imperial stout. Pours pitch black with quite a nice head, dark beige and with some quite nice lacing. Smells vinous to start and then follows with bitter chocolate and some light cream. Nicely balanced with more bitter chocolate, asome dark roastiness, a touch of dark fruit without being overly acidic, and some cream. Nice bitterness throughout. A tiny bit chalky in the mouth, but clean and smooth otherwise. Very nice,"
"This offering is quite good compared to the run-of-the-mill Leinenkugel's lagers, which are a little caricaturish in nature. A great effort from the Leinenkugels."
"You can't fault Leinie's on this one! No corners have been cut whatsoever. It's rich and malty, superbly roasty, and there's even a good bit of hop flavor. Some bright yeasty fruitiness rounds it out; and the fact that it's superbly balanced hits the ball home. My only question now is where to find more."
"D. Drinkable. Has some kind of odd smell/flavor that puts me off some. Its almost like an astringent alcohol smell/flavor that I really havent experienced before. Its too bad because it has all the makings to be a pretty solid Imperial Stout. I will check the remaining 2 I have to see if I pick up the strange quality that I got in this one."
"This is a nice beer to have when you are chilled to the bone. I would like to see how it ages."
"d - A very nice RIS. I enjoyed the taste and the mouthfeel quite a bit. Would like to have again."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew was as dark as night and as thick as used motor oil with a thick 3 finger milk chocolate head. The aroma is bold with burnt malt, coffee, caramel and dried fruits. The taste is exactly that creamy dark malts along with strong sweetness that is almost overpowering and a lingering raisin and plum taste. Aftertaste is strong and on the burnt side of things. A little disappointing, however a decent strong brew. Likely to cellar two and pass one along to a friend from my four pack."
"I didn't even know that Leinenkugel made a Russian Imperial Stout, so I was pretty surprised to see this at the local Kroger. There was no price tag so the cashier sold it for 6 bucks for a four pack. I'm guessing that was a good price, appears pitch black in body. Large tan head forms thick velvet texture, I like the cascading effect as this one dwindles. Fine speckled lacing is even around the entire glass. Aroma has some dark ripened fruit notes hints of cherry/raisin notes. Roasted malts with a touch of soy sauce/anise like notes. Dark roasted malt brings in hints of chocolate and coffee but these noted don't stand out as much as other features I mentioned. Alcohol plays a pretty big factor in the nose here, I can really smell the booze in this one. Flavor has a tart cherry/raisin sweetness wrapped in dark chocolate dry alcoholic finish with dark nearly burnt roasted malts. Body is somewhat thin for the style alcohol is a bit too prominent on the palate, it hits with dark roasted malt and ripened fruit notes finishes a bit boozey. Drinkability overall is one and done type of pseudo craft, this is a good representation of the style I just think it would do better with some age I have three left, I'll update my reviews accordingly."
"Overall this beer seems a bit too raw and edgy. It does have huge elements of dark, charred, roasted malts with a fudgy backdrop, but the alcohol erodes these otherwise welcomed flavors. This beer just seems to collide with itself, rather than working in somewhat of a harmonious experience. I'm going to cellar the remaining (3) 12 oz. bottles and see how age might mellow this bustling beast."
"For the ABV, it is a very good drinker--and to think Leine created this--very cool!"
"D= I'm already on to my second bottle."
"To be honest, when I first heard of this beer I thought that Leine was trying to run with the big boys and really had no reason to try an IRS. I feel that they landed in the middle of the spectrum though. Not a bad attempt and its a pretty decent brew."
"i liked this offering and respectable stab at the style from a brewery with a reputation at some pretty entry level concoctions. it's decent, solid and enjoyable. recommended."
"A little thin for an imperial stout, but considering this is 9.5 ABV, rather drinkable. Not too boozy, just a bit of a warming feel after awhile. Finish is a bit charred, almost oaken, with caramel and toffee notes up-front. They say there are 3 types of hops, but I couldn't really discern any. Not usually into Leinenkugel, but a friend left this at my house, and it's a surprisingly decent & drinkable not-too-imperial Imperial Stout."
"D - This is a fine imperial stout but not a great one. Pretty good considering most of Leinie's other offering are average."
"The ABV is reasonably well concealed, which helps the drinkability. On the other hand, it just doesn't taste good enough for me to want another."
"Very well done. I've often felt that Leinenkugel's is an underestimated brewery."
"Seems they stayed inside the box on this one. Still very good, not quite great."
"Deep, jet-back syrupy pour. Three inch dark brown head that looks like it could be used for a hockey puck. Deep burnt roasted malts, dark chocolate and expresso smell. There is a little bit of alcohol in there, but is hidden pretty well for the most part. The smell is the taste at first. Gradually the roasted malt and coffee taste melds into some molases and slight spicy or herbal notes. Licorice/anice, maybe even some faint cinamon or nutmeg flavors. Hard to nail down. It finishes with more roasted malt/ burnt wood flavors, and a fair amount of bitter hoppy bite. The 10% alcohol is in there, but pretty far in the background. Very thick and chewy mouthfeel. It's like pudding it's so thick. I had no idea Leine's made beer like this. For the most part they make decent, drinkable, but mostly boring beers. This is way beyond anything I thought they would come out with."
"D- An overall true pleasure of a RIS experience. Full body, full flavor, well hidden ABV, awesome mouthfeel. Great job on this one."
" ~ This is a quite a bit more than I expected from Leinenkugel's. This is a very good beer that has the ability to really make its mark in a world of stouts that have a strong following. I've always been a fan of the brewery from Chippewa Fall but never expected them to brew a beer with this kind of character. Cheers."
"Pours black, with two fingers dark tan head.  Smells like roasted malts, slight coffee, slight alcohol.  Tastes are dark chocolate, slight dark fruits, bitter yet sweet finish.  Good, not great but good. I wasn't really expecting much so this was a nice surprise."
"So basically if you're a fan of RIS's then try it out. If you're curious about the type, most definitely try this out. If you just want to be surprised at what Leinenkugal can apparently do, just grab a 4 pack. It's worth it."
"D- I've had beers higher than 9.5% ABV that were more drinkable. alcohol flavor is too pronounced and there is too much carbonation. Also if I want soy sauce I'll drink a bottle of soy sauce, not a beer."
"Dark black color with one finger of head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Very stout like aroma with plenty of roasted malt, chocolate, and some dark fruit. A touch of grassy, earthy hops as well. The flavor features the roasted malt foremost. A little smokiness sneaks in as well. Other hints include a bit of chocolate. Alcohol is well disguised. This beer falls short in the body department. Far thinner than the premier Russian Imperial Stouts. It just does not let the flavors linger very long. Carbonation is good and would of been very good if the body had more substance. Relatively easy drinking for a big stout thanks to the alcohol not being detectable and not really a positive, a light body."
"D- This is a good beer from Leinenkugel. Most people will be surprised with this beer as their regular lineup is not very pleasing at least for me on the palate. A nice go at a bigger style that I think they did well."
"This offering from Leinenkugel pours a midnight black with a reddish brown, one finger head. It smells like a baltic porter. It has some malty sweetness to it. It tastes rich, chocolaty sweet, and has a nice maltiness to it. I really like it and it's really surprising me. I certainly didn't expect anything of this quality. The way it drinks is where it especially stands out. This is possibly the smoothest stout I've ever had. It's full body but is so soft, so smooth that it's hard to believe this came from Leinenkugel. Why have they been hiding this? This beer is so drinkable, so delicious that this should've been released years ago. What a beer. I hope they don't limit it's release."
"Medium to full bodied, proper carbonation, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. This is a nice effort from Leinenkugel's, and is worthy of trying again."
"Big Eddy is a well above average imperial stout, Somewhat Surprising coming from Leinies, And I like Leinies. Pours like motor oil, thick and black, and almost no carbonation, Dark tan Head. Aroma has roast and sweet Malt and Chocolate aroma. Lots of smoke and wood in the flavor. Several Layers of taste, Chocolate, Esspresso, Vanilla, Dark Fruit, and a Hop bite in the middle of all that, a med/Heavy body, Very impressive. It does have a light alcohol Fade. I would like to let this for a year."
"For the money, there are *much* better RIS choices."
"Notes: very interesting. impressed with the layering of aromas and flavor but not sure i like them."
"D: by far the best thing out of Leinenkugel's thus far. Too bad they don't put more of their energy towards these types of brews. Not perfect by any means, but certainly interesting."
"The perceived bitterness seems to come more from the char of the grain instead of hops in this brew. This is a medium bodied offering with a creamy smooth feel with a light level of carbonation. Overall it wasn't a bad brew but the sheer amount of yeast character evident in both the aroma and taste just didn't do it for me."
"This is not the best RIS I've ever had, nor is it the worst. I wasn't sure what to think when I bought this Leinenkugel offering."
"Big fan of my first stout of the winter season..."
"Good job to Leinis for joining us out here in craft beer land."
"12oz bottle with twist off cap into a goblet. Pours dark and dense with no light coming through. Small mocha colored head that hung around briefly before fading away with minimal lacing. Smells of roasted malts and chocolate. Tastes of roasted malts, bitter chocolate and molasses. It has a smooth mouth feel with nice bite of bitterness that sits on the tip of your tongue. Drinkability is good."
"I'm not sure why, but I'm kinda wary of a beastly imperial stout with a twist-off cap. Wariness aside, it pours a deep motor oil topped by a substantial amount of brown foam. The nose comprises molasses, caramelized brown sugar, dark roasted malts, light fusel, and light burnt coffee beans. The taste runs similarly, though everything is darker, more roasted. I never thought I'd say this, but it all seems too dark and roasted for its own good. I'm not getting too much of the heat that others are, though it is in no way mild. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an only slightly chewy feel. Overall, while not necessarily hot, I feel this is indeed an overly young stout. Perhaps with age it could achieve something (or, at least, get it's lazy ass off its mother's couch and get a goddamn job), but until then it's too much roast with too little mass."
"I'm not used to RISs coming in a screwtop bottle, or from Leine's but let's see how this one goes. The darkness was poured but the tan head didn't last. The smell is a little hot and could use some time to mellow out. There is the aroma of some vodka, strawberry and banana, some smoke and a bit of oak woodsiness. The taste is mainly smokey with a clove flavor in the background. There is a a real need for this to mellow out the booze harshness. It's not too bad, it's drinkable but could seriously use some time."
"12 ounce bottle with a ""pull date"" of April 16, 2011. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch tan head. Head retention is low, but there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like roasted malt, dark fruit, molasses, chocolate and coffee. It tastes like roasted malt, molasses, milk chocolate and coffee. There's also a nice slightly bitter roasty finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and has high carbonation. Drinkability is decent, I think if the carbonation was a bit lower it would be better. For the most part, the alcohol is well hidden. Overall I think it's a good enough brew. I'll have to age a couple bottles and see how they hold up in the future."
"Overall, this is a respectable beer from Leine's. It isn't the best RIS out there, but it isn't the worst. It will certainly impress the target market more so than us Ba's, but it is a beer that's drinkable... Especially for the price."
"D- sure, it's drinkable but there are much better examples out there"
"A decent attempt at a RIS. Not bad at all. Good to see Leines get out of their comfort zone a bit."
"I was absolutely enthralled wit the novelty of this brew, coming from Leinenkugel...but it was enjoyable for sure....almost impressive. It's not the greatest, and far from it, but it is a solid, enjoyable example of the style."
"D= Wow, where did this baby come from. I've disliked everything I've ever had from Linie's so far but this one is outstanding. Maybe one of the best RIS I've ever had. Complex as hell and easily drinkable. I was seriously debateing even buying one of these but now I'm for sure going to the store to buy many more. World Class beer."
"Glad I bought it, excited. Very good RIS. Well made and tasty."
"D- hands down the best beer from this brewery. ill be picking up a four pack or two to lay down and see how this progresses. check this one out if you get the chance. the 12oz bottle size is a nice change from the typical RIS in a bomber."
"Drinkability: Not bad, and like mentioned above, there are definitely better offerings out there. Overall though, if you're in the mood for an RIS but don't feel like dropping the heavier bones for a more renowned version, this one would do. It also sits a little heavy with the thicker body and the ABV would certainly catch up after a while, and that will always lower the drinkability by a touch."
" -McDsB33rGuy"
"overall, this is a good beer"
"Pours a very dark color bordering on black. There is a pretty good mocha head. The nose is really nice with a good dose of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and a bit of black licorice. The taste wasn't quite as complex, with the chocolate and roast going through a bit more. Feel is pretty nice and thick. Drinks well and very impressive that this came from Leinenkugel."
"D- Very drinkable, especially when the alcohol content is taken into account. Overall, I was pleasantly by this beer. I would certainly buy it again, and recommend it to my friends as a solid, affordable RIS. I see this as the perfect gateway beer into the category, for people who aren't quite ready to go out and down a Dark Lord."
"It is a nice attempt by a macro brewery, but there is still room for improvement."
"(D)- This one is a surprise. It has alot of room for aging potential that could smooth out some of its rougher edges it currently shows. A bit too bitter and hot fresh, but I would like to see what 6months to a year does to this. I was not expecting much going into this bottle, but it is actually quite could; could be better, but has the right idea."
"A very good beer and I'm happy that Leinenkugel brought this back."
"It's OK that they sell in 4 packs. I wouldn't want more than 3 or 4 at a time. It is a pretty good beer for every once in a while."
"O: Worth a try, and may be worth aging. Definitely on the low end of the style."
"D - This beer was a bad beer and a bad experience. Would not drink this again."
"D: it does the job, but still curious about cellaring for a couple months. i will try it again. also curious about the draft version."
"Notes: Big Eddy is a full bodied brew, and has some potential. While drinkable, it's a brew that needs just a bit of improvement. It's good, but there is an element it lacks. A solid effort, nonetheless."
"Once again, I will echo the previous bottle reviews. This beer is green and needs a few months to coagulate. Look forward to seeing how this progresses over the next few months."
"D- 9.5%... Overall, a solid beer. Not cloying but smooth and enjoyable. I don't find it to massively complex but it definitely doesn't lack complexity. Will I buy again? Not sure. Given I can get expedition for cheaper which I feel has more complexity, I perhaps would not."
"Will be letting a couple age a year before i try again."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper. This is gonna take me forever to finish. Luckily it's pretty tasty."
"Motor oil black, whihc is great, nose of chocolate and spice. Love it. Hits the palate with massive roassted malts, caramel, and hints of chocolate. Thin mouthfeel for such a big stout, but the finish just goes and goes. Like this a lot, and will be searching out more, as I would like to see what some age does to this."
"A real top notch RIS. Glad I was able to snag several of these as I think they will only improve with time. All around enjoyable RIS that drinks quite well. Glad Leinie's decided to bring this one back."
"D- Like others said, I am going to lay this one down for a while and see what some time does to it. Its a bit hot fresh but a pretty decent effort by a big brewer. I would have liked to see it be a little thicker but you cannot always get what you want."
"Overall - With the exception of the aroma and soapy quality to said smell, this is a well crafted RIS. It leans more towards the roasted and dark fruity side, and gets better as it warms up. They should make this more often."
"overall - solid brew from a ""macro-esque"" brewery."
"Excellent brew!"
"D: I got this bottle for free, so I can't complain. But I'd never pay for one. Too fruity, too disheveled, too boozy for its own good."
"D - A bit thick and at 9abv, its a sipper. Enjoyable especially from Leinenkugels's. The flavors, smell and mouthfeel make this a nice brew."
"A good stab at the Russian Imperial Stout style, it's worth a try to compare against the many craft brewers that are coming close to mastering this style. A good 6 months to a year of cellaring may do this beer some good as it seemed a bit green around the edges with all of the sweetness."
"D: This beer is not for the faint of heart. There are definitely some strong flavors here that create a complex flavor. Beer geeks will love it, but traditional Leinie fans probably won't dig it."
"Good flavor, but nothing extravagant for the style. Fruitiness is more pronounced on the tongue with raisin and currant. The roast is mild, and so is the dark chocolate, as notes of molasses and vanilla take their place. Finishes with a lingering, earthy hoppiness and a hint of smoke. Medium thickness, a bit thin for the style but creamy and smooth with a low carbonation level. Overall, a nice entry for an otherwise unremarkable brewery. Leinenkugel's should venture out more frequently into the 'bigger' beers."
"D: A fine beer indeed, although I'm satisified with trying it but once."
"06-'07 version pours an opaque darkness with a generous dark brown head that decomposes in 3D like an ice cream sundae leaving spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is nothing but stunning super rich mocha licorice boozy roasted malt. The mouth feel is perfect...heavy, thick, full bodied, creamy smooth with a monstrously thick coating texture...holy cow!! Who brewed this??? are you kidding me??? ...and there isn't another batch in the tank why??? HELLO!!! It leaves you with an exceptional dark deep raisin dark fig date experience from the full flavored taste. An incredible drinker!! Where the h&^* did this one come from/ go to? Wow...this is one of the best ales that I've had the opportunity to consider!"
"$2.99 single from Riley's, Madison."
"Honestly, I can't believe this beer came from Jacob Leinenkugel's. This is easily the best thing they ever did and they should do themselves a favor and bring this one back for another limited release."
"this one has been retired for two years and the tavern I went to just tapped it!! I believe the aging made this one even better. I was baffled to discover the Leinenkugels brewed such a beast. Too bad it's retired!! Thank you Happy Gnome for cellaring this one and bringing it out when no one in the world has it on tap."
"Wow...one of the better Russian's I've had this year."
"2007 bottle. Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma of rich molasses, toffee, bitter chocolate, raisin, sweet fruits, and sweet caramel malt. Flavor is sweet and a little boozy upfront with a roasty, chocolate finish. Lots of sweet malt (but not necessary roasted). Thick palate. Decent and complex, definitely a slow sipper."
"Mouth: Nice & thick, creamy smooth body. Lucious from front to back. Sweet, full, chocolate and roast malt. Lingering finish of roast flavor and residual sugar. I would prefer if the finish was a bit drier but this beer really does hold up well."
"Pulled from my cellar after nearly two years. A 12 ounce bottle poured into a standard shaker glass. The stout appears an opaque dark brown color with about a finger of creamy dark ecru foam. The head leaves a thick tan lace on the inside of my glass with each sip. Taste and nose contain notes of caramel coated dates, raisins, grassy hops, a touch of vanilla, rich roasted grains, molasses, prunes, bittersweet chocolate, dark cherries. Maybe a notch better than medium bodied with adequate carbonation and very little alcohol presence. This was hard to put down."
"Drinkability: I'm very glad I got to try this. I feared that it may be something like Leinenkugel's take on Fruity Pebbles a.k.a. Sunset Wheat, and while it was to some extent (tons of sweetness), it proved to be very complex and interesting. A heavy, sugary, sticky brew that I would recommend to anyone. Thanks again Steve!"
"D- Easy to drink, a very good effort here and glad I got my hands on this one."
"Well, I finished the beers without finishing notes on the beer, but it's a drinkable RIS and tastes good."
"Drinkability: One after another, I've found the Leinenkugel lineup to be made up of nothing but downright dumpy, unrewarding beers. It's one thing to be unable to brew a good beer, but to able to brew a delightful beer and simply opt not to is completely criminal."
"Very nice brew. Has held up well and could go longer. Only wish I had more. Thanks Steve for the chance to try this one!"
"pours dark with about a half finger of mocha head that fizzles quickly. little to no lacing. smell is smokey and boozy. taste leaves alot to be desired. very fusely. big presence of the alcohol. mouth is thick and burny. leaves a bit of a burnt malt taste in my mouth. not really a huge fan of this one. swing and a miss leinenkugel"
"My only knock is that it is a tad thin on the mouthfeel. If this were to bulk up a bit it would be world class."
"Overall a very tasty brew that I am glad I tried but I don't need to trade for it again. I would rather waste my trading on something new."
"Taste is also big, lots going on. Lots of charred, roasted malt, chocolates, bittering, dark coffee, molasses, not much for dark fruits as the label promised. Again, there is a lot going on, and the general impression is, hefty. The mouth is fairly full and smooth and creamy, enough carbonation, quite nice. Now, there is something in this RIS thats seems, for lack of a better word, unrefined. Or, unleashed. Like the roasted malt just wants to leap out at ya. But its really a quite fine beer, particularly for a group known more for 'gateway' beers than solidly craft. So, good for them, this is a high quality RIS, interesting and great to drink, challenging even. Nearly makes it to the upper class."
"great beer, and if it's true they aren't making it anymore, what a shame. I might actually send an email to the brewery to tell them myself that this beer needs to stick around."
"Pours as black as my heart. Thin head. Smells very sweet for a RIS. I taste mostly sweet fruit without as much malt as I would expect from a RIS. Mouthfeel is good but this is too sweet for my preference. Interesting beer nonetheless."
"the only bitch is it may be just a touch sweet.. but I can't complain that much.. this is a great RIS... thanks Steve.. I honestly really do appreciate the supercool trade."
"Notes: Far and away a better attempt than their fruity lineup, yet still could use some work. I don't think this would hold up in a cellar situation very well."
"On tap at the Darkness prerelease party at Stub And Herb's - Pours pitch black with a slight caramel/tan colored head. Beautiful aromas of coffee and chocolate dominate the nose. First sip is all coffee and bitter dark chocolate. Could use a slightly stronger malt backbone...even still this is wonderful. World Class."
"Taste is a bit better, some dry and bitter chocolate comes through. Lots of coffee as well, with no notable hops. Mouthfeel is good, nice and creamy. Drinkability is pretty good as well."
"On Tap at Miller Tech Center (9-26-07), 11.3% ABV. Pitch black color, frothy amber-brown head. Aroma is a wonderful blend of roast, spice, chocolate, light coffee and a touch of vanilla. Flavor is raisony sweetness, vanilla, spice, roast and light chocolate. Medium to full bodied. The finish warms the insides as it goes down. Another great Big Eddy beer."
"D: Where's the alcohol? I couldn't detect it at all. Dangerously drinkable. If the weather would've been a little more cooperative, I would have had another. Leines best offering, by a mile."
"Tasted on Nov 8, 2007. Bottle. Finally got some of this. WOW!! This is some thick stuff. Pours black with a small dark tan head and sticky lacing. Aroma is rich malt, licorice, medicinal ripe fruits. Flavor is chalky smokey malts, cocoa, molasses, licorice, and faint hops. Mouthfeel is thick and velvety. Thank you Leinenkugels for brewing a beer that drinkers can sink their teeth into. Don't be afraid to brew more big beers. You are now off of my shit list. ; )"
"This immediately reminds me of Surly Darkness. Not because they taste identical, but because its the most similar RIS I've had in terms of a smooth body and esters. It starts out with a mild dry cocoa note and then dives into a mix of chocolate-covered berries and hoppy citrus rind. It finishes with a big caramel-coated espresso bitterness (with some hops character mixed in) and medium-weight body that makes this all the more drinkable. It's a shame this beer will soon be extinct. Easily the best beer Leiny's ever made and one of the best RIS's I've had. Definitely a favorite."
"D- Drinkable but only if you can handle the sweet it could be really off putting for some. I don't mind it really."
"D-Even with the heaviness of this brew, Big Eddy was easy and a pleasure to put down. I most assuredly would want to have another if I find it again."
"D- Really impressed by this one from Leine's. I thought the best of their line-up was sunset wheat...but I guess there are a bunch of brews from them that I don't know about!"
"Lots of acidic dark grains with fruity sour cherries, a little bit of char, black licorice and some molasses. Unsweetened dark chocolate is also present. The palate has a lot more fruity, cherry-like oxidation, with a prominent roast character lending a nice bitterness. Despite that, it does have a noticeable sweetness as well, dark chocolate and caramel in nature, with a lot of fruit in the mid-palate. Roasty and sweet on the finish, there's lingering chocolate and cherries. Very nice. 4/4/4"
"I love this beer. As long as Stub's & others (wonder if the Nile still has it) keep it on tap, I'll still be hanging around the bar. Leinie's, make this beer again!"
"Had a bottle of this a year ago and decided to open my other one up and review it, best beer I have had from Leinenkugel Brewing for sure, does not measure up to a lot of the imperial stouts out there but there are now so many out there, it is still a solid offering, would not go out of my way to get more but glad I got to try it on a few different occasions, recommended"
"This is actually quite sweet tasting, though it is not as thick as the sweetness might suggest; it could actually use more roast malt character to balance things out and some more body, without more sweetness, would help to balance this a bit more too. I like that this is a fairly well integrated and smooth in its roast character. Not a bad example of an Imperial Stout & it is certainly quite enjoyable, and if it was not for the simplistic sweetness, this would be really damn good."
"Big Eddy's a big, kick ass beer. Easily the best Leinenkugel's beer I've tried. It's a very flavorful, great tasting beer. On second thought, I'm not sure the nose really lacks depth, but it could use some refining. The flavor profile doesn't add much in terms of depth, but tastes absolutely fantastic. Minor complaint. Definitely one to seek out."
"A very enjoyable stout to be sure. Thank you to the unknown trader (Kathleen?) who contributed this bottle. Cheers."
"Pours deeply, darkly, purely opaque blackness. Thick and syrupy. Head is two full fingers of carmel colored foam with nice staying power and a cloak of lace. Nose is very nice with dark chocolate covered cherries, raisens, carmalized malt and a decent balance of hops. Very attractive as you take first sip, roasty malts wrap nicely around the dark fruits. Syrupy chocolate glazes the tongue and the hopsbring about a slight soured bitter feel as you continue to drink. Dare I say ""underrated"". Electric on the mouthfeel as it begs for the nexy sip. Alchol is crazy well hidden. The lasting sour bitter twang is the only thing that smudges the drinkability only slightly. Very nice."
"Drinkability - a top shelf RIS that can challenge any other in a blind taste test. Thanks a ton to pimpp for the bottle, I'll be on the lookout for this one next time it comes around."
"D: A solid RIS, but not among the best I've had. A bit of tartness and a lean toward acridity take this one down a notch or two in the 'drinkability' category. Glad to have had the try (and wouldn't pass on another). Thanks again, Michael."
"Pours pitch black, like motor oil, and produces a small, dense mocha head that dissipates almost immediately to a thin swirl and collar leaving little bits of lacing. The smell is a massive malt bomb with coffee, chocolate, licorice and tons of dark fruit in the nose as well. The taste is as big as the smell with a more pronounced bitterness on top of the roasted malts. Semi-sweet chocolate and dark fruits are also in abundant supply in the taste. The mouthfeel is decadent, super creamy and sticks completely to the inside of the mouth. This is one of the better straight-up RIS's I've had in recent memory. It's a massive beer and definitely a sipper. Big thanks to Damian for sharing this one."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head falls slowly, with thick coating lace. Aroma is rich hearty dark malts, with an undercurrent of fruit and alcohol. Taste is sweet dark grains upfront, a shot of coffee bitterness in the middle, and then some hops bitterness to end, over the previously mentioned alcohol character. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, and drinkability is good. Not as over-the-top as some, and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"Awesome brew this is. Love it, love it, love it..."
"I am not a fan of JLBC beer. I am a huge fan of Big Eddy Russian Imperial Stout. This is the real deal and is an offering that deserves to be brewed every year. Thanks to the felonious one for the bottle."
"M - Seems about right. Thick, but not so thick as to overwhelm the other aspects of the beer."
"The taste is subdued yet the right roasted coffee/chocolate esters comeup in the next 30 seconds. This is a pretty good RIS that will not miss your stroke off RIS of the moment. Drink it when you can find and enjoy"
"D: I liked it. It is on the sweeter side of RIS' but I will search it out at next bottling. I would love to have five or six bottles of this one laying around."
"Pours a complete onyx black with a big bubbled two finger brown colored head that slowly falls to a thin foamy layer of bubbles. Thin spotty lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smell at first is strong dark fruits, thick rich chocolate, and booze. Roasted malts and spent coffee grinds in the nose as well. Bitter molasses taste up front followed by lots of dark fruits and a warming alcohol. Charred malts with brown sugar and rich caramel on the tongue finishing with a bitter and smokey licorice sweetness. Full body with a thick and creamy feel. Carbonation is soft and enjoyable for the style. A monster beer with too much that isn't coming together. Definitely need to take your time with this one seeing the alcohol is fairly present. Good beer, not great."
"Taste:"
"Pours a thick black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy dark tannish color, which does leave some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is big on malts, toffee/chocolate/coffee/caramel, nice touch of vanilla as well. The taste is very nice malty, with nice tones of toffee/chocolate/coffee/caramel, with some nic sweetness from the vanilla. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well. Very drinkable, this is my first from this brewery, and it is mighty tasty. Thanks Andrew."
"Overall, I'm both surprised & impressed to have a Leine's brew with this much craftsmanship put into it. Definitely worth trying if you come across it."
"D-A nice effort by Miller/Leinie. A solid Impy but not an all-time great. Complete opposite in style of say a Rogue Impy as this one is devoid of the big bitter hoppiness....Not in the same league as the elite Impy's but still a damn fine beer. I would purchase a few more of these I think."
"Thanks, tangfoot, for the opportunity"
"a bottle of black gold under a dirty rainbow"
"Thanks goes to alexgash for this long ago in a trade..."
"Bottle courtesy of Grub: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with loads of sweet notes. Taste is also dominated by some sweet cloying notes with some light notes of black chocolate and coffee. Full body with oily texture and good retention and no apparent alcohol. I think I am going against the grain on this one but I just can't like these super sweet imperial stout; I prefer them when they are more balance with coffee and black chocolate."
"Just a monster of a brew, we had a Sam Adams Triple Bock after this one and there was a lot os similarities in the taste, just much less concentrated in the Big Eddy"
"Carbonation is a touch higher than many RIS's which is actually welcome considering the motor oil motif many brewers seem intent on creating. Body is substantial but, likewise, not overboard. A rare RIS with very strong drinkablitly...if the sweetness doesn't piss you off first."
"Pours a solid black color with a decent sized tan head that shows great retention and moderate lace. The aroma is a bit roasty and fruity with a strange almost plastic phenol in there that detracts from everything else. Light earthy hop and a hint of ethanol round out the nose. The flavor is roasty and chocolate with a fair amount of dark fruit along with some brown sugar and caramel. Thick body with a rich creamy mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. This beer finally made it to my state, and since I enjoyed it so much the first time, I jumped at the first four pack I found. How's that Don Henley song go? ""Don't look back, you can never look back"" Either this beer has really changed, or my palette has. This is a decent stout, but really nothing special."
"Jesus this is nice. Maybe perfect mouthfeel. Completely palate coating and viscous with a long I mean forever long roasty, chocolatey finish. Wow. Did not expect this from this beer. Some alcohol shows through in the mouth and chest but adds to the character and complexity of this beer. So much dark chocolate and black fruits. Black currant, hints of vanilla and molasses and more black fruits. Big and rich. The carbonation level is dead on just teases the taste buds. An amazing stout, love to see this get national distribution."
"Dark oily, black pour with a nice sized brown head. Looks nice in a snifter. Smells of some soy sauce, oatmeal, a bit of roast malt, and unbaked dough. Very interesting. Taste is smoky. Beef jerky, smoke and then some roasty malt and a bit of dark fruits. Nice thick creamy body and mouthfeel. Too smoky at first, but then it grows on me and has some chalky bittersweet cocoa powder notes that I enjoy."
"Tasty for sure but a little too focused on dry. It's also oddly boozy for 9%."
"I am pleased that Prince Murray Swine recommended and sent this. A classic RIS and they nailed the style. Big bold bitter black and a full coffee. Full mouthfeel. Coffee in, chocolate coating but not over on the chocolate as per the new wave. I know many malts were used, but it is definately coming out on the strong bitter side."
"Forget that this more or less a Miller puppet, and respect it for what it is...a big step for big breweries, as this easily stands amongst its widely heralded micro peers. Let's encourage more of it. Especially if it is this good."
"This was quite the interesting RIS, with a taste profile that really skewered towards the dark fruit side of things. A little too much at times I'm afraid. A little more roasted malt or hop character to balance all that sweetness would have really helped. Still, this was a decent enough sipper of a RIS and one that I'm most grateful for having had the chance to try."
"This one seems a little out of balance with the sweetness and dark fruitiness. Perhaps a tad more hops would help balance it out. as it warmed it got better, but still not right. I finished it, but i do not htink i would ask for another."
"I couldn't finish it. I didn't want my rating to reflect to the fact that I didn't like it. But I give HUGE props to Leinenkugel for brewing this one for all the RIS fans. For a larger micro to make and distribute this shows something about Leine."
"Poured from 12oz bottle thanks to Hoppymeal. Poured into a duvel snifter. Poured a thick black color with a finger size brown head. Smell was slight dark fruit with chocolate and alcohol scent. Taste is slight herbal coffee and light chocolate flavor with a alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is full body oily with a light carbonation feel. While a good RIS to me the alcohol feel is just a little unbalanced."
"Excellent offering from Leinenkugel's. I wish every brewery the size of them, or larger, could grow some balls and start making craft beers like this that actually taste good. Cheers and Hooray for Leinenkugel's! I am thoroughly impressed with their character as a brewery and this beer itself!"
"Pours with some viscosity. Pitch black beer with a super dense crop of dark brown head. Retention is outstanding as is the lacing. Nose is really nice. Thick and rich. Ripe berries mix with anise oil and char and alcohol. This beer has a real oily texture, which I like in Imperial Stouts. Body is about medium-full or so and light on the carbonation. The flavor is quite rich as well, with dark chocolate and black licorice. Very nice flavor. This is a solid RIS. Best beer I've had from Jacob et al."
"Solid body and pretty good mouthfeel. Feels about right for the style. Great beer to sip on."
"A very good beer from the Leinie guys. I wish they would do stuff like this more often."
"overall, a very nice beer, nice to see this brewery prouducing something of such high quality. def. try it if you can find it."
"Note: I wrote this without looking at other reviews, but afterwards I saw I'm not the only one that thought of Triple Bock."
"Very drinkable! This is a wonderful RIS; huge flavors, quite rich, unique and, overall, damn likeable. It is amazing that Leine brewed this. This RIS is just a tickle below the best I ever had but by no means is that a negative. This is an excellent beer and it made a wonderful nightcap. Thank you Bill and RedHaze for the bottles!"
"drinkability is excellent. great balance. interesting malt profile. i love the slightly burnt caramel character too. really enjoyed this one."
"A valiant effort nonetheless. I plan to cellar the other 3 for a loooong time and re-visit this in the future, as it is definitely an incredibly complex brew that perhaps needs a little more time to settle."
"I would buy this if it ever makes it to my markets."
"Good not great, but very exciting Leinie's did this beer."
"Pours an opaque deep black, thick dark tan head forms, settles to a thin layer and ring, nice lace spots. Smell is very fruity, figs/raisins, chocolate, toffee, roast, vanilla, sherry, thick aroma. Taste is similar, sweet sherry, chocolate roast, vanilla, oak, toffee, lots of dark fruits, nice bitter roast near the end, very long finish, really lingers. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation, alcohol is well hidden. Nice imperial stout, especially coming from Leinies! Thanks Russ!"
"This is nice and oily, a great finish to a night of drinking. Thank you, Eric!"
"D- Weight and alcohol bring this down, but a solid beer none the less."
"The eddy pours a thick viscous black with almost no head. The nose is chocolatey with spice. Meaty flavors with very rich flavor. Smokiness, smoky meats. There is a speck of JW lees flavor in here (wierd I know but i taste it just a bit) There also some chocolatey tones in here and a little bit of subtle hop bitterness all the way through. A little bit of coppery taste on the finish. very little coffee tones. The mouthfeel is very thick and viscous, soupy. Drinkability is ok for an imperial, but its so rich and thick it would be hard to have more than one in a row. Good brew, but a sipper, and nothing too fantastic. worth a try."
"D: This beer is incredible! The flavors and aromas are so complex and enjoyable. I still can't believe it's made by the same folks who brought us ""Summer Shandy""."
"The folks who make their daily bread with HoneyWeiss and Berry Weiss, well, yeah, it seems, they CAN brew a RIS. And here's the proof, right here in my mouth. Big Eddy's has to sit in with every top notch RIS, it has few flaws, it's only drawback is that it fills the bill, but has nothing to really bring it forward. A good example of an RIS, maybe even very good, but not quite great...although, ...almost...."
"Overall, this is an impressive brew. It's a touch too sharp for me right now but would probably age beautifully. I'm not a fan of Leiny, but they pulled this one off pretty true to the style. Kudos to them for deviating away from the ""dumb it down to gain popularity"" mentation."
"Please don't stop brewing these!"
"D-This stuff could be dangerous. So easy to drink and you would never see the punch coming. I have gained a lot of respect back for Leinekuels after this bottling. Excellent work gentlemen!"
"Delicious. I've grown a little tired of overly coffee-ed stouts, and this hit the spot. Decidedly underrated. Syrupy and chewy, but quite quaffable."
"D-I could sip on this all night,very pleasant warming effect,very good balance between hops and all of the malts.I put a couple away for a later date,but when their gone this beer will be sadly missed.Please brew more,thanks."
"Thanks again to Derek for including this in our trade!"
"Keep up the good work Leinenkugel. I wish now that I had sampled the IPA offered previously. I traveled over 600 miles round trip to secure some of this and am glad I did. It was a long day but I came back with some good Wisconsin beer. But then I do have a soft spot for Leinies & their friends."
"D: This beer has the potential to be really good but it needs some time in the cellar."
"D - Well, I wouldn't drink this daily, or weekly. Lots of work and flavor. But on a cold winter night such as this with 7""-10"" of snow bearing down down over the next 12 hrs, it's about perfect"
"D- This beer has full dark malt flavors with some creamy qualities that are nice. It was served a bit colder than I like so I will re-review at a cellar temp. Nice easy drinking RIS overall."
"Overall, very good, but not top tier. If the mouthfeel was improved by removing whatever is causing the texture issue, and the taste complexity was increased (too much chocolate and alcohol), it would be better."
"Ovr: Fantastic stout. I guess it's hard to say a beer rated in the high 80's is under rated, but I had barely really heard of this beer until I made the trip up to WI and happened to find it on draft, which made me seek it our in bottles. I actually prefer this RIS a bit on the cold side wheras I normally like them a bit warm, but at the perfect temperature, this beer is right up there with m favorite RIS's."
"drinkability: on par for style"
"D - The smoke, sweetness and vanilla did not combine very well in my opinion. Nice attempt by Leinie's but I preferred the DIPA so far in the series. I hope they keep the big Eddy series going as I will keep trying them."
"Pours out jet black with a huge cocoa head that dies slow and laces big. Smells of chocolate covered fruit, dried plums, coffee and cocoa. Taste is big chocolate, some dark fruit and coffee but all out of sorts. These flavors usually are perfect together but they all seem off. Turned off by the chalky finish. Full in the mouth and the ABV is well hidden. A victim of hype."
"Very dark, almost black, as in black oil. Finger of dense, creamy-looking, dirty cocoa brown head. Nose of dark chocolate-covered raspberries, scorched brown sugar, stewed plums, and raisins. Herbal, almost piny, hop aroma surrounds. Tastes of dark chocolate and roasted coffee bitterness up front. Sweet, dark fruits come on strong along with truffle and milk chocolate sweetness. Tiramisu flavors before herbal hop bitterness crescendos into the bittersweet, roasted coffee, warming finish. Full-bodied. Big and chewy with a very smooth, creamy finish. I was prepared to be disappointed by the hype, but this is a very impressive RIS. Keep up the good work Leinies!"
"Drinkability: This is another good performance by Leinie's for the Big Eddy beers. The IPA was a better IPA than this is a stout, but this is still a good beer. I wish I had some chocoloate laying around..."
"Pours inky black with a medium sized creamy rusty brown head that dissipates quickly to a ring. Aroma is a big dry and smoky roastiness with hints of chocolate, acidic tangy aroma lies behind it mixing with the maltiness to create a sweet fruit smell. Taste is a soft chocolate mixing with the smoky and dry charred woodyiness of roasted malts up front, sweet fruity and ripe berry maltiness comes in mid taste and lingers nearly to the finish before the smoky and nutty roastiness lingers dryly on the tongue. Medium to heavy in body, fairly thick, sugary and full on the tongue, low level of carbonation is soft and creamy, slight drying in the finish. This is an outstanding beer, I had no idea what to expect and was very impressed. The smoky quality to the roasted malts is very nice as is the strong fruity maltiness. The alcohol is extremely well balanced. I am very excited to see how this will age but it is drinking very well now."
"This beer pours a very dark brown near black with a rocky brown head that fades quickly. The nose is huge on banana and juicy fruit type aromas. The roast fights to get through. The fruitiness in both arom and flavor blunt most other flavors that I am assuming lurk beneath. The alcohol is very apparent and fusely. Overall, I am glad that Leinenkugels has gotten this adventurous and look forward to the evolution of this beer if it is maintained in the future."
"This brew pours exactly like motor oil. Dark black with a thick, rising, brown head which remains throughout. Strong aroma of chocolate malt, raisins, alcohol. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and soft with just the perfect amount of carbonation. Roasted malt on the front end and dark fruit thereafter. Definite coffee flavor at the end. Finish certainly shows the 9.0% abv. Definitely the best I have had from Leinenkugel's. My compliments to the brewmaster on this beauty."
"Pours like motor oil. Black with a thick, rising, brown head which remains throughout consumption. Aroma of chocolate malt, raisins, alcohol, and chocolate covered cherries. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and soft with just the perfect amount of carbonation. Nice chewy roasted malt on the front. Dark fruit, like cherries appear in the middle. Rum soaked raisins follow. Just a touch syrupy. Hint of espresso near the finish. Long smooth finish reveals the 9.0% abv. Hands down Leinenkugel's best offering. When you consume this, take a moment to thank the brewmaster that crafted this RIS for them."
"Mouthfeel is dense and creamy, with a big body. It goes down smooth overall. A big, hearty brew that is great for a cold night. I've never been a huge fan of Leine's regular offerings, but this one just blew me away. I hope they keep up with the Big Eddy series as this is one helluva a good R.I.S. from a brewery I wouldn't have expected to brew something like this. Seek it out. Thanks to nchrist13."
"Drinkability: Too sweet, but good and not overly aggressive Like I said, have it for or with dessert - and split it with a friend, unless you've got a big sweet tooth."
"Pours dark black with a decent brown head. The smell is dark fruit and hops and some slight soy. The taste is more dark fruits with a nice roasty, coffee finish. Sweet, viscous, very tasty and fruity brew that I imagine will improve over the next couple years. This beer has a nice sticky feel in my mouth but doesnt have as much roasty flavor as most imperial stouts. Hopefully the hops will die down a little but this is very good fresh. Thanks to nflmvp for the trade."
"The drinkability suffers from its age I expect it to get better by Spring. Prosit MK"
"Pours pure black with probably the darkest colored head I've seen, brownish red almost. Head retention is amazing and has incredible lacing. Aroma has molasses, licorice, cherries, chocolate, and a little roastiness. Sweet malt and molasses greet my tongue first, yielding a cornucopia of sweet delicious flavors. Many of the things noted in the nose are also present in the taste, but just even more condensed and with some roastiness in the finish; it's so good! Mouthfeel is super thick, very full bodied with low carbonation; perfect for an imperial stout. Incredible beer, I really hope they continue to make this; Dark Lord, watch out!"
"Quite enjoyable this beer should make up for berry wiess."
"The general consensus amongst the tasters was that it was, dollar to dollar, better than Old Rasputin."
"All in all a great offering from Leinenkugel, blew away all my expectations from such a brewery. I will never start drinking honey weiss but I may be a loyal leinie fan if they keep pumping out stuff like this."
"hopefully they wont discontinue it like the IIPA but this is definitely better than that."
"d-the best russian stout i have had, this is excellent!! the best beer i have had thus faR"
"Is this going to be the macro beer that quiets the macro bashers? Its about flavor, not quantity, right? I mean, great beer is great beer...am I wrong? Looking forward to the bottles of this as soon as I can get my hands on them. Thanks to a generous and (currently) anonymous member for this generous pour."
"Fantastic job Leinenkugel Brewing Company- Listen to the beer geeks, not your accountants. Keep rolling out the Big Eddy releases!!!"
