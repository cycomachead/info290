"Quite good, but there's a lot of competition in this category."

"Glass- Snifter"

"O- A good stout with a lot more bitterness than expected. The hops flavors are  different, coming out as the beer warms- mayhaps this is a particularly fresh bottle? Eitherway I would drink another of these, especially on a cold day."
""
"O - Good"
""
""
""
"What's not to like? Even the 9.7 ABV means I can have another."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O:  Nearly perfect.  Will buy again."
""
""
""
""

"Pours dark as night, but the head was meager.  Nice roasty nose and taset, though not as complex as some that I've had of late, still can't say it was bad.  Thick and chewy, not quite as dry a finish as I would expect.  Pretty good over all, but will sit on the bench while other Stouts get he minutes."

"O - Very good RIS. I think that the alcohol presence could have been masked a little bit better, but I do look forward to plowing my way through the rest of this 4-pack."
"I'm impressed! At 9.7% abv I was skeptical. I usually enjoy a stout in the 11%. This was strong. Flavor hits you hard and runs right through you. I'm making this my every day beer! lol! Definitely have to try this.  Next stop bourbon barrel version of this."
""
"O - delightful. Doesn't scream ""evil"" but it's still pretty good. Cheers!"

"Overall: Nicely balanced in flavor, but a very interesting beer in that the aroma is almost the opposite of the flavors. Alcohol almost undectable on the taste but very forward in the aroma. Flavors are very full in roastiness and bitter chocolate/coffee, but I pick so little of it up in the nose. Still a very solid offering and enjoyable, very drinkable and full of flavor."
""
""
"O - A satisfyingly RIS, with full and varied flavor notes.  The feel is a bit slick, and the nose a bit abbreviated, but overall one of Thirsty Dog's better offerings."
""

"A 10 oz. pour at Busy Bee Cafe on 9/17/14. Big and dark with a decent head. Typical roasted malt aroma with coffee and chocolate components. The flavor is where it shines. Big bodied, rich, bittersweet chocolate taste with a bit of alcohol middle to finish. Long but mild bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is coffee and chocolate. Roasty coffee flavor with some lactose creaminess. There is some alcohol taste, but overall well hidden. Aftertaste is dry. Very well balanced stout. I rank this with breakfast stout as one of my favorites."
""
"Dark as can be, very little head.  Great mouthfeel but not a ton of roasty, maltiness to it.  Finishes nicely.  Edit: after reading some other reviews I might have to give this a second try.  My impression of its flavor was nowhere near what others describe..."

"Pours thick and black with a crimson blush you can see if you hold it to the direct light. Fat head of creamy chocolate colored foam that falls slowly and leaves sticky clinging lace. Noe is cherry and chocolate. The sweetness of the chocolate covered cherry. Roasted malt with a bit of cold bitterness. Sweet underpinnings form malt. A hint of char. Taste is smooth creamy and milky. A bit of french roast coffee and not as much chocolate come over the palate slow and sultry with plenty of full malt softness behind it. A touch of the roast and the bitter. A hop bitter too. Finishes dry and with a bit of crispness that seems to be in defiance of all the milky creaminess. I love this. it’s bitter from both roast and a bit from hops and finishes to accent the light touch soft sweetness and sweet chocolate . Some heat from alcohol resonates and a touch of grass comes up for a brief flash ."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This brew is almost World Class! The aroma is par, the appearance is par yet this beer lets you know it's high gravity in the flavor. What really sets this behind is the way the beer feels on the palate. It's ok at the Medium-light level, yet that Carbonation is popping! That's one of my pet peeves with Malt Beer. I like it to have that soft carbonation not the feel of forced carb. With this carb it steals attention from the body for me. Well, all in all this brew is Worthy."

"This was a very good beer. Much better than the BBA version in my opinion. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Truly black as a Siberian Night (I would assume), with a slight brownish tinge towards the very edges of the glass, and a bit of mocha-tinted head. nice aromas of coffee, molasses, and a slight bitter note. Not heavy on the nose. Really nice roasty flavor, a balanced bitterness, and dark malt contribution. Slight sweetness as well. A soft, creamy mouthfeel, some small bubbles throughout. Overall a really nice IS, definitely deserving of some of the medals boasted on the label. Glad that there are a few more in the fridge."

"O - Tasty, enjoyable beer. I would probably enjoy it more on a chilly winter day, as opposed to an 82º summer afternoon. Not my favorite RIS, but one I'll definitely have again."

"Overall: This is a big beer that could have bigger flavors. Everything is played safe. There's a good transition between roasted malt, molasses, and coffee flavors. But nothing really stands out. It is however a solid representation of the style and something Id recommend as a starter RIS"
""
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, dark bread, smoke, light char, light dark fruit, and roast/smokey earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, molasses, smoke, char, light dark fruit, and roast/char earthiness. Good amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, smoke, char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and fairly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial stout. All around great complexity and balance of intense dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Very nicely balanced between sweetness and bitter roast for my palate. I like more sweetness. Not the most complex stout, but very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great base beer for the BA Siberian night. Glad this is local!!"
""
""
""
"The beer is black and opaque with a thick, soapy, beige head. The aroma is awesome. Rich roasted malt with chocolate and a touch of espresso beans. Bitter chocolates with a touch of char. Absolutely delicious. Elegant and silky feel on the palate. Years ago, this was readily available and now it's a chore to track down a single bottle. Bummer. This is a world class imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"A killer brew and definitely one of the best easily attainable imperial stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - interesting to see how this has changed over the years. it's been in the back of a 40 degree fridge for years. developed some oxidation but still pleasant. the fruitiness compliments the RIS."

"Pours out pretty dark with not much head even with an aggressive pour. Thinnest caramel colored head floated on the top. Not much lacing. Smell is quite good with roasted malts, caramel, and some chocolate. Taste follows that suit with a subtle coffee bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel isn't quite what I expect from an imperial stout but it isn't terrible. Just a bit thinner than I like. Overall a pretty solid imperial from a hometown brewery. Makes an outstanding base for the BA Siberian Night as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink, though this is much more of a sipping beer than one that you would drink more quickly. Alcohol is well hidden and this is a really nice substitute for dessert."
""
""
""
"This one knocks it out of the park, honestly. Just amazing. Thirsty Dog needs to be more recognized, and I need to get more of their beers."
""
""
"O - I found this at DiCicco's Market in Ardsley, NY today unexpectedly. I tried it on the recommendation of one of the guys in the beer section. He did not steer me wrong. I hadn't found an imperial stout anywhere close to Ten Fidy till now. Only regret is that I didn't get a 4-pack or two. May have to jump in the car and get back up there to get some more. This is a really flavorful imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was actually pretty impressed with this because it was so readily available. Thirsty Dog seems almost comical but they actually have some decent beers. I would put this almost on par with other Imperial Stouts from more well-know breweries and something you should try."
""
"O- Fine imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"When I first had this back in 2008, I rated it as OK. With the further development of my palate, I will have to upgrade this to Outstanding, maybe even to Excellent. The aroma and appearance are definitely excellent while the taste is simply roasted and not complex. This is a great imperial stout."

"Hearty and rich. Some licorice and coffee, along with notes of cocoa and blackberry. Meaty char and a whiff of peat. Really rich mouthfeel, which is to say that this bad boy has great body. Carbonation is kickin'! Beer's got a pulse. Awesome."
""
""
""
"M: Creamy mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Full bodied."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is spot on. It is nearly heavy (if you know what I mean) and leaves a mean residue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with a decent sized tan head. Both the aroma and taste feature a lot of roasty caramel malts. There’s also a hint of coffee, which makes this reminiscent of Stone’s espresso Russian imperial stout. Goes down smooth and tastes delicious."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite Imperial Stouts. Due to relatively low alc/vol at 9.7% it doesnt feel ""heavy"" or boozy. In fact, it does feel very viscous and has a great mouthfeel. The taste has hints of coffee and burnt (in a good way) dark chocolate. This is a wonderful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My wife bought this beer from a local beverage store. It's a deep, black beer. The head is a milk-chocolate colored foam...it's not a tall or thick head, but it leaves a solid lace. The aroma is boozy and woody...slightly acrid...a little charcoal and highly roasted grains. Smoke and booze. The taste is balanced, with a serious bitterness that kicks in at the mid-taste. Full, heavy, and thick. Not as much warmth as I expected. This is an enjoyable, if not exceptional, beer for an early February Snow day."
"Pours dark as a starless night with a full frothy head. Excellent lacing that lasts. The nose is mostly chocolate, but roast and hints of dark fruit are also present. As it warns, coffee is noted. The body is not quite full and has a nice slick mouthfeel. The above average carbonation level tends to diminish the mouthfeel until it warms and outgasses. After outgassing, it is full bodied and creamy. The excellent flavor profile is well balanced and complex. It begins with sweet dark chocolate, progresses to roast and coffee then rotates to a caramel and dark fruit sweetness. Notes of raisin, plum and molasses are detected across the profile. It finishes smoothly with sweetness and a slight alcohol note and roast bitterness. This GABF Gold Medal winner doesn't disappoint."
""
""
""
""
"My loss, I understand."
""
""
""
"O: I found this to be surprisingly good, an overall great stout, and very drinkable. Thirsty Dog doesn't disappoint here and I would definitely have this again. It's a nice change from the coffee stouts I'm used to."
""
"Price Point - $3.50/12 oz single"
""
""
"This offering is not quite as full-bodied as a top shelf RIS and it does not have real discernible dark fruit notes either. However, the heartiness of the roast profile certainly makes up for what is missing."
"O - A great examples of an RIS"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Excellent stout. Something I would definitely try again."

""
"O - Overall, what it lacked in appearance and aroma it more than made up in taste and mouthfeel. Quite delicious."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good, probably one of the best parts. A hard medium body, really smooth with a great carbonation level. Still, the flavor lingers for quite a bit, 10-15 seconds probably. While it's smooth it's got a nice hard dry finish. No bite from the alcohol, but it's got a nice warming feeling (perfect for a chilly night like tonight). Crazy drinkability, this one goes down pretty quick. Solid brew. Great recommendation from the BBG, sorry it took me so long to get around to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is one flavorful RIS. Probably one of my favorite non-barrel-aged stouts. Dangerous drinkability."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"overall its a great RIS. nothing that will blow you away, but definitely a solid offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Decent RIS, not my favorite, but better than several others of the same style."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"a perfect stout for lovers of beers similar to expedition stout by bell's. not as good, but close enough until winter gets here. 9.7, deep flavors. stouty as a mofo. not as refined as expedition stout and slightly more in your face and crass with the flavors. they resolve nicely after a couple."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, the ABV is noticeable but not by much. A bit drying on the palate. This beer has some good qualitys but mainly lacks in intensity. When drinking a RIS I want big bold notes, with this one it's softer and doesn't last as long. Still, for the price and availability this one will get another look from me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an example of a base beer that is perfect for barrel-aging. It's got that strong umami flavour, and you want to barrel-age it to add some more complexity to it. And well, the BA version is pretty awesome. I'm about to review it next just in case you're interested..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Impressed by this one, though I went back and forth on the taste (3.75 or 4?)."
""
""
""
"Overall: I picked this up on my last visit to PA and don't I wish I grabbed more. Absolutely great, and for the price factoring in quality feels like it was free. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's black with a etched tan surface and a confluent rim of the same. Smells of graham, oats, soil a hint of licorice and plenty of toasted and roasted malts. Flavor is dusty with some coffee grounds, maybe cocoa, a touch of licorice and again plenty of toasted and roasted malts. Kinda reminds me of Plead the 5th, but toned down. Medium bodied if not a little thin for the style with moderate carb and a semi dry finish. A decent beer, I'd slam again, but nothing I'd seek out personally."

"O: A pretty good RIS overall. It ht aged rather well over a year and has some decent legs on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"HOOOUUWWWLL! This will keep you up all night. Good use of coffee without drowning out rest of the team. The malts seemed concentrated and condensed(in a good way) to really deliver bold flavors. Solid bitterness that balances out some sweetness. Don't let the tacky label fool you. This is an awesome brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent stout, was looking for some more complexity here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I kinda dig the simple+raw flavor and light feel, but does come off kinda bland. Not bad though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Pretty good beer here, but I felt like the individual components could have been integrated better. Also could definitely have used a fuller mouthfeel. However, still a nice beer, and one that I am happy to have tried."
""
""
""
"O: A great RIS but I think the low point of this beer is the mouthfeel. A tad too carbonated and a touch thinner than I would like. All in all the flavor profile is right on and nicely developed. All the flavors marry well and attribute to a delicious offering. I will definitely drink this again. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to buschbeer for this trade extra!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad. I was not disappointed, and I would consider grabbing this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was a bit disappointed by this beer. Perhaps it was the year it spent in the cellar, but the flavors just weren't vibrant. Good chocolate and toasted malt presence, but the mouthfeel did not accentuate the creamy flavors. This is not a brewery I have readily available to me, and as far as I'm concerned that's fine. It ain't bad, but there are so many better options in the Imperial stout category."
""
"I'm going out next week to buy another 6-pack to cellar for 3 years! This is an incredible beer to age."
""
"Two Words: Versatile Winner"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one came as a surprise from an awesome MI trader; I'll have to seek it out sometime in the future."
""
""
""
"O - Easily one of my favorite stouts - the bourbon barrel aged version is amazing."
""
""
""
"Strong and punching. A very nice brew."
""
"Overall/Comments: A very good RIS that is extremely drinkable, well balanced, and highly recommended. Does and excellent job of masking the almost 10% ABV. Classified as a Russian Imperial Stout at 9.7%. Consumed 2-22-13."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this renewed my faith in stout's. It was pretty damn good. I'd definitely have again."
""
""
""
""
"O - decent stout. I'd get it again in a mix-a-six or on tap. Imagine what a combination of FBS and Ten Fidy would taste like, and make that just slightly more bitter."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice RIS, but I have had better. More sweetness and less smoke, ash, and bitterness would be better."
""
"Bonus points for always being available. A decent amount of flavor and depth, but nothing earth-shattering. A very good RIS for those times when you can't justify breaking something out of the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy, delayed alcohol. Short carbonation, doesn't matter. It's a solid $2 single. Goes well with those cheap sugar cookies everyone cheeps out on during this time of year. ;P"
""
""
""
""
"O-not bad and I will probably try again if I run across this in Iowa"
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is pitch black, with not a hint of light to be found, even around the edges. The brown head is average for the style, and leaves very little lacing. The smell has hints of dark chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The taste reminds me of a dark roast coffee, with a hint of cocoa. The alcohol is well hidden behind the strong roasty flavor. The mouthfeel is very good - thick and viscous. An all-around good imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A rather impressive Imperial Stout that would be great to try on any chilly night. Really easy to drink and rather tasty, a must try for any beer geek. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent beer and worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tons of specialty malt (and just malt in general) in this RIS, which while a little rough perhaps is packed with flavor and not at all a bad value."
"Very dry and highly burnt, black patent malt flavors. The swallow is a balanced bitterness from hop and the burnt malts. Long aftertaste. Good body. Low carbonation. Overall, think coffee with no cream or sugar."
""
""
"RIS's aren't my style normally, but this is one I could sip on every now and then ... preferably on a chilly winter night. Best I've had from the style -- though I must remind you again, I haven't had too many RIS's."
""
""
""
""
"O: 1 is enough, but this is good! Alcohol is a bit much for more than 1. I will definitely buy again."
""
""
""
"Pours almost pitch black with a nice classic RIS aroma. Chewy, full body with a roasted malt taste with hints of coffee along with faint hop bitterness. One of the better imperial stouts I’ve had in a while. Overall a great beer. I still prefer Old Rasputin to this one but it comes in a close second."
""
""
"O - Milk chocolate, nice body. Great stout."
"O: this was very well done, and would very much like to come back to this in a blind taste test with Old Rasputin (another RIS I absolutely love)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice strong, and sweet ris. Lots of smokey nutty malts and the classic chocolate/coffee flavor make this a winner. PRobily the best beer thristy dog makes, a must try for fans of strong yet very balanced and sweet ris's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice beer to slowly sip and savor and close the night out with. The alcohol is relatively well masked from the taste."
"Now this is a stout and then some. First I checked color; not only did light not pass through, it seemed to be pulled in at the edges. It smelled like paving tar and tasted like oil, but in a good way. It was thick, full, and delicious. If you want a stout with character, this is that. If you want something that is easy drinking, this is not, this is beer with oomph behind it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"bourbon county. by far the best beer in the world."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nicely done Imperial stout, solid across the board."
""
"O: Some strange off flavors in this one. It's honestly pretty good despite them, so if they weren't present I bet this would be a solid 4.1-4.2 range beer easily. Odd that this bottle isn't very old and it was stored properly. Maybe an off batch."
""
"O: This is a nice RIS. Not overly complex, but the roasted malt and dark chocolate flavors are very good. I do wish there was a bit more going on here and maybe a bit more sweetness, though."
""
"O- This is a very coffee forward stout, wonderful roasty notes. Lots of fresh bitter coffee grounds taste. This one packs a punch."
""
"O: I would definitely buy (and drink as much as I can) this stout again. I got this in a trade and I wish I had more!!!!"
""
""
"Notes: It's quite hefty and even a little bit sinister a very tasty beer all over. Cheers."
"1472"
"Overall a top notch beer. It stands tall with Beers that have spent time in barrels. Taste is crazy. The perfect blend of dark hoppy coffee and rich decadent chocolate. Try this at all cost and compare to all of the hyped beers. You may be surprised."
""
"Pours black, with a tan head. Light retention but pretty fantastic lace. Dark chocolate, roast and some sweeter dark malt qualities shine on the nose with some good hopping too. Taste has bakers chocolate, sweet malts and milk chocolate, and a really nice creamy flavour. Light roast and even a hint of dark fruit in the finish. Moderately bitter with a good balancing sweetness. Medium full mouthfeel and an appropriate medium low carbonation. Creamy/velvety on the palate. A solid RIS, I would certainly revisit this."
"Overall this was a good, classic example of an RIS. Nothing mind blowing, just a very flavorful robust stout. Not a beer worth trading for, but if available locally it would be a solid standby beer."
"Overall - Solid beer. Good flavors. Well crafted. Maybe just a touch rough around the edges, but otherwise very nice."
""
""
""
"Poured into a 20 Duvel tulip. Pours a slick black with a huge 4 inch head, leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is chocolate, coffee, smoke, and dark fruits. Taste is all of that, with a huge hit of bitter expresso in the finish and that isn't a bad thing at all, just the nose didn't have you expect its roastyness. Body is medium large, plenty of carbonation, a little dry, and drinkable for its hefty ABV. This is a very nice Imperial Stout, roasty and delicious."
""
"O - This is a very nice RIS. Thick, heavy and delicious. Still can't believe I've waited this long to try it."
""
"O: Not one of the better examples of the style, much to thin and lacking in complexity. It's not drain-pour bad, but it was a bit of an effort to finish it."
""
"I need to go back and buy more of this stuff at the price my store, which shouldn't even carry it in MA, was selling it at. Love the dark roasted malt, cocoa and dark fruit interplay."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to assume that this mellowed with a few months of age. It was very mellow as others have pointed out how ""fresh and hot"" it was. Pours a typical obsidian color with a thin tan head. Nose is vanilla, wood, coffee, very mild booze, chocolate, and roasted malts. Flavor is similar- starts with coffee, chocolate and vanilla. Further looking gives off some wood and roast. Finish is mild vanilla and wood. Very nice, very balanced BA Imp stout."
"M - medium/heavy bodied with good carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being a little overly high for the style. Overall it was a pretty solid beer of the style. The aroma seemed a little muted compared to how bold and flavorful the taste was. I thought it was a very nice beer to sip on this evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Found this to be quite delicious. I would love to have a few more of these handy."

"I've been meaning to revisit this for so long, as I really enjoyed it back in my college days. Let's see if things have changed (they have been known to, mind you): It pours a bleak obsidian topped by a finger or so of golden brown foam. Damn right. The nose comprises darkly-roasted malts, chocolate syrup, light char, caramelized sugar, and a touch of dark coffee. The taste follows pretty closely, with some mild hints of dark fruits and raisins somehow finding their way through the din of roast and chocolate. Nice. The body is a light hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, for once, my memory was dead-on. This is a fantastic stout, one I wish I ahd regular access to. Get some!"

"Overall a pretty good beer at a very reasonable price. Haven't been disappointed with this brewery yet. Not the best of its style but certainly on the more drinkable end of the spectrum"
""
""
""
"o - pretty good RIS.."
"This is one of my all time favorite beers, and my favorite RIS. I've never had anything else from Thirsty Dog, and I'm actually afraid to try a different beer of theirs, because it can't possibly be as good as Siberian Night."

"O: Awesome beer full of good stout flavors and aromas. If alcohol notes were present it didn't get in the way of me enjoying it. Recommended if you can find it."
""
"o - solid overall and enjoyable, but lacks the depth and finesse that can be found in many, many other big stouts. i've had this before and seem to remember it being much better. maybe i got an off batch, but i'd buy it again."
""
""
"O- This is a good RIS but none of the flavors are too strong and there's a stronger then I would like presence of alcohol. Having said that, it is relatively easy to drink and pretty darn good beer."
""
""
"O: wow, this one honestly blew me away, I picked it up because it was from a brewer id never head of and was on the bottom shelf, right up there with the big dogs in the category, delightfully surprised"
""
""
""
"This is a great brew TO ME, it definately gives Old Raspy a run for it's money. The best thing is ... I have 3 more cooling in the fridginator to consume at will. A definate A+ beer. (as i power into a home had chicken salad and shredded lettuce samitch on garlic olive oil bread). Eat your hearts out !"
""
""
""
"overall, i thought that the nose and mouth were pretty well balanced for the most part and the smokey aspect was enjoyable thus making this beer highly drinkable. This is a great fireside beer IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: for my tastes, a little toward the burnt/bitter end of the imperial stout spectrum - I prefer mellower stouts. Of course, you should try one if you like stouts, because it was definitely a good beer."
""
"A- Pours shiny black with 3 finger mocha head. Crazy lace, practically coats the entire glass. "
"O- Would like to see how this one ages, probably should have bought more than one. Very enjoyable RIS"
""
""
"God damn I love this beer."
"Cost: $9.99 for a four pack."
"Dark brown black. Small mocha head. Nice sweet roasty chocolate nose. Flavors are very nice. Smooth rich chocolate, roast malt, coffee. Alcohol is hidden very well. Mild carbonation. Super easy drinking and tasty RIS."
""
""
"Overall: A good stout, but it doesn't quite fill the shoes of a double/imperial. A bit one dimensional to me, didn't taste a whole lot there."
""
""
"O: Very good RIS. Tastes very dark and roasty like an RIS should. Would love to try the Barrel Aged version."
""
"This is my first opportunity to give this one a try. I can say that it is drinking wonderfully with five years of age one it. I would love to have another one of these any day."
""
"Does very well with a year on it."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew, smooth in the feel with a modest amount of carbonation. It is easy drinking and enjoyable. Overall a well made stout that is easy to attain and ive admittedly taken for granted as ""always available."" It is worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Because it's so well-known and easily obtained, I kind of consider Old Rasputin the benchmark that I compare other RISs to. This one compares very favorably, though it lacks a bit of character and costs $2 more than OR. Still, it's worth seeking out and trying."
""
""
""
"The first time I sampled this beer was on tap and I do not recall the same bitter taste up front. So, if I had my choice this would be a superb stout to be drinking with a meal on tap. And, due to its bold nature I would only be drinking a single draw. I have more to learn, though, about what food would best complement this beer. My guess---a good stinky cheese and ripe pears."
"O - a nice surprise. like all good stouts it gets better as the chill fades away. would love to try on tap."
""
""
""
""
"Future outlook: Good stuff, and a relative value given it's quality and heft...I'll have to snag a few more of these to sock away."
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything one would look for in a great imperial stout, will definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I liked this one. I was expecting a little more sweetness based on the smell, but I still think it turned out quite nicely. Great beer by Thirsty Dog."
""
""
""
"O - This RIS is mostly unknown but it does not mean it is bad.Very good RIS that is true to its style with ABV very well hidden. Overall very well balanced. I would highly recommend it."

"Very rich, complex, and flat out delicious. Nowhere is the 9.7% ABV even remotely noticeable, would you please pour me another!"
"Pretty awesome overall and I plan on buying more for sure."
"Overall, this one really caught me by surprise. Most of the time when I see the ratebeer and BA stickers in stores I disregard them or even laugh at them, but this stout flew below my radar until this point. I expect to get more of these and see how they age."
"O: A fine beer. It doesn't try to be something its not and doesn't stray from what makes it great to live up to the imperial name. Its not overloaded with hops, chocolate or coffee, but manages to find a great symmetry between the three. A tasty, flavorful brew that will be purchased again."
"Nice frothy head that dissipates into a thin ring on the edges of the glass. This stout is the black hole of beers...darker than dark. Smells like dark chocolate brownies just out of the oven. Lots of coffee notes to it. Tastes like the aforementioned chocolate and coffee but also very strong molasses flavor to it. Nice carbonation as well. Definitely taste the coffee with a touch of that alcohol kick on back end of this one that lingers a bit. Wonder what a bit of aging might do for this one."
"Overall this is tasty as hell and very drinkable. Great brew!"
"Wow, this is one of my favorite RISes, up there with Rasputin."
"Pours an opaque black with a 3 inch puffy dark khaki head that fades to a small cap. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and milk chocolate candy. Taste is of dark roasted malt, milk chocolate, and slight coffee flavors. A mild roasty bitterness quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a solid RIS all around. I am glad I got to try this one."
"Definitely the best offering I've had from this brewery."
"Overall solid stout but not amazing like so many are these days. Definitely worth a try."
"The body is medium and the carbonation is soft. Overall not bad but nothing really special here. Seems to be a run of the mill sweeter RIS."
"Overall - I'm a big coffee fan, so I loved this beer. I loved the complexity of the flavors and how it wasn't overly bitter-tasting. I would highly recommend it."
"D: Sipping beer, 'nuff said."
"Overall this beer really impressed me. I wasnt expecting it to be such a great tasting Imperial stout with such a fantastic body. Definitley highly recommended."
"O- This is a good beer, but I have had lot of other RISs that are just as easy to get and much better. I might get this again later, but I would not get this regularly."
"overall, a great range of roasted malt flavor, but not a whole lot else. a solid imperial stout, but not something i would go after again, too many greats in this style already."
"Very good. Even and balanced."
"Overall: I was really glad to have had the chance to try this one. (Thanks Barfwin!) Aroma was fantastic, and the other characteristics were excellent as well. No real flaws. Yet another great imperial stout to keep my eyes out for!"
"I like the way this feels on the tongue and the potency of the flavors, but that damn licorice can ruin everything. It doesn't ruin this one, but only barely. I'd definitely try it again."
"Pours a black color. 1/2 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, oatmeal, hint of alcohol, hint of hops, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, hint of coffee, hint of sweet malt, hint of hops, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend. The body was a little weak though, for an Imperial Stout."
"O: Very drinkable for a RIS, not the heaviest, but has a good flavor profile. Could be a go-to RIS, if there ever was such a thing. A nice sipper."
"The CPJ"
"O/D: Little to no alcohol burn, incredibly smooth, easy drinker. Decent offering from a bottle, incredibly good on tap. Don't know how old it was, or any details, but I was shocked at how good it was."
"Molasses,unsweetened cocoa, burnt coffee, some charred wood,an enormous hop bitter aftertaste. Horrid! In its favor,(there is always SOMETHING in a beers favor!) It lives up to its' name, being black as night in color and a decent alcholic buzz. I won't be trying it again"
"Overall: Really nice RIS. my first beer from Thirsty dog brewing company, I am impressed."
"Burnt and roasted malts with moderate sweetness via bittersweet chocolate, light caramel and the outside part of Oreos. Tangy berry and raisin notes develop midswallow. Not a lot in the way of hop flavor, but there’s a modest undercurrent of bitterness. Some warming alcohol in the finish. Body’s a bit on the lightish side, but the balance of flavors is rock solid. Since it’s available in my neck of the woods now (not to mention the reasonable price point), I should really pick up a few to see how they age. Easy recommendation."
"O: pretty good overall. Not great maybe not worth 3.39 a bottle."
"O - Nice RIS, really solid flavors and pretty satisfying overall brew. Would drink regularly."
"pretty nice! alcohol is barely noticeable, its just full of flavor. I would drink this regularly despite its slight lack of body if available here."
"O: Really good flavor, just ok mouthfeel. This is a good stout that is a little rough around the edges. Still, I would have this again if it were available to me."
"D - Surprised to see the incredibly high scores on here, I found it lacking in flavor and complexity. I may give it another shot, but it isn't my top priority."
"Overall this is pretty disappointing starting with a solid nose but unexpected and then really not delivering on the palate and taste. But it is drinkable but it is quite weak and extremely underwhelming."
"Su-perb. Perhaps not up there with the elite RIS stouts, but it's really, really close if not."
"Overall, this is a pretty great Russian Imperial. It might not be my favorite in the category, but it's one definitely worth seeking out. I was pretty happy to find it on the shelves in my hometown in MI. I even gave the last one to a non-beer person when she asked for a sip of mine and seemed to like it pretty well."
"Overall, well, that's 4s down the line. A good choice in the category, although not a world-beater."
"Overall / Drinkability: A solid Russian imperial stout. Good by itself and I think it would pair well with a lot of things with the stronger coffee-like flavors in this beer. Alcohol very well hidden except in the smell, and by the end of the glass I'm thinking another one would be a good idea making this a very dangerous brew. Not the best RIS I've ever had, but yet, it has really grown on me and I find it's quite drinkable. Normally one RIS a night is more than enough, but here I'm wishing I had another bottle. Good beer."
"D-This is honestly really hot and not very complex; really not a fan of this, as much as it pains me to say so being an OH native."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. This is a great RIS for the price and availability, and in my opinion gives Old Rasputin a run for it's money for its bang for buck. This is much more roasty and bitter than Old Rasputin, but if you are looking to change it up, look no further."
"O - One word - Giggiddy! Goodness gracious, I had no idea how good this bastard was until just a few nights ago. I'm stocking up on this thing for sure!"
"D-Overall this was decent. Alittle too much burnt taste and prob. alittle thin but over all this was a decent beer."
"Very drinkable for the style, and for the 9.7% ABV. Compared to other Russian Imperial's it's almost a guzzler. Easy to get carried away."
"All things factored in together, this might be as good a beer as I've ever had. It looks and smells fabulous. The taste is amazing and despite high ABV, it's as drinkable as they come. Just an exceptional beer."
"Overall I would get it again. Best offering I ever had from Thirsty Dog."
"This was an ok beer, the flavor could have been more pronounced, I think this was just above average for the style."
"Loved it"
"Overall, this is a very decent Imperial Stout that I am glad I have 3 more bottles to enjoy. However this is not a brew that I may go out of the way to find, but I will enjoy em while their around. Enjoy!!!"
"O: I can't wait to have more of this one. Not every RIS makes me want to have two in a row. This one most definitely does."
"Overall I was really pleased by this offering from Akron. With all the hype about RIS limited releases lately maybe someone should let us know about the availability of this one. Thanks to mater for the extra. Highly recommended!!!"
"overall, a solid example of style, but could be smoother."
"This beer is one of the lightest gravity RISes I've ever had. I had brought it along because I wanted to balance out the lightness of the cuvee with something much heavier. That didn't really pan out, and I'd say the cuvee may even have been the thicker beer of the two with its intense breadiness. The Siberian Night is a good beer if you're expecting what's inside. When I'm in the mood for summery RIS, I'll go for this lil puppy."
"Overall a superior Imperial Stout that left the flavor lying on the taste buds for a decent duration, allowing a full enjoyment of all the components of this extremely tasty brew."
"O- Good beer with a good balance of flavors."
"A solid RIS, if it was a local i'd pick it up regularly."
"O: Good, not great"
"Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice stout that did not disappoint."
"O - Really surprised by this one and very much enjoyed every bit of it. Will definitely have to remember this one as a steady go to stout. Nicely done!"
"One of Thirsty Dog's best I'd say. This brew is pitch black and had a sliver of brown head over the top of the beer. The smell of the beer is highly roasted and burnt aromas along with some hops too! Some flavors of wood, a little smoke, some hops, Chocolate and coffee all come together in this one. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side which is great. I feel that this beer is a really good attempt at mimicking the Russian Imperial Stout in an American way."
"O- This beer is great. Scent is amazing, taste is pretty nice but a less than desirable body would be my one complaint. Thanks to Cardsharp for the extra."
"This is one of those beers that had sat on my wants list for damn close to 3 years. I had always wanted to try it but it had eluded by grip for years. I don't know why, but I finally got it in my hands. This beer had been on the tops of RIS lists until the bigger and bolder movement of the last 2-3 years. Here's hoping that it lives up to what I think it should be. Poured a 12oz bottle into my Hennepin globe glass. This beer pours a viscous, motor oil black with a 2 inch beige head that leaves just a bit of soapy lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is pretty straight forward with rich dark chocolate and heavy roast espresso. The flavor is dynamite. Straight up pure dark chocolate and espresso. Just a hint of dark berries and molasses. This thing goes down like like water. While its not overly complicated, it presents all the elements perfectly in harmony with each other. The mouthfeel is great. Nice and creamy leaving a oily coating all over the palate. Man, this is a balanced RIS. Nothing over the top. No Barrel Aging. Just a straightforward, easily drinkable, perfectly balanced RIS."
"THe Siberian Night Imperial Stout is no doubt Imperial. Stout it is and tasteful.Malty and not to hoppy. This dark black brew has a taste of espresso and smoky chocolate,this may describe the smell as well.Overall this a very enjoyable stout.Bought this one in a growler at the brewery on Thirsty THursday,which is fun to check out every Thursday 4-8 pm!"
"Overall this was a good RIS. This one was heavy on the roasted malts which were heavily roasted. It was a little burnt but that didn't hurt it too much. Everything else was pretty on par for its style except for the mouthfeel which came out to be thinner then it should be. I enjoyed it but it can't hang with the big boys. I don't know if I would buy this again but I sure wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me. If you love RIS""s give this one a try, but don't expect it to be the next Founders Imperial Stout or Bell's Expedition Stout. I would be willing to see what else Thirsty Dog has in its arsenal."
"I enjoy a good stout on occassion and have had some really great ones so I probably won't seek this out again. But if you like a very strong roasted smell and taste this might be for you."
"T: Tons of roasted notes. A little coffee and some burnt toast in there as well. The mouthfeel was medium but a bit light for the style. Overall, a pretty tasty beer. Glad I got to try this."
"Overall I have to say I greatly enjoyed this one and will definitely be seeking it out again. Somewhat of an overlooked gem in my opinion.."
"O: A good beer, and if you like RISs you'll probably enjoy it. My rating was made with style heavily in mind, which is why my scores are on the lower side of things."
"A tasty ""sleeper"" RIS. Highly recommended."
"Drink is ok. It might make a better black and tan than a straight-up RIS."
"D- Nice offering from Thirsty Dog, a very approachable stout."
"Very drinkable for the style, and for the 9.7% ABV. Compared to other Russian Imperial's it's almost a guzzler. Easy to get carried away."
"Drinkability is good but I don't think I will go out searching for this one. If they jack up the taste profile without screwing up the mouthfeel I will enjoy some more but those aspects drop this beers ratings significantly for me."
"D: Very drinkable, dryness keeps you coming back for more."
"Would recommend this beer to imperial porter lovers."
"Full bodied, a bit syrupy, sticky and chewy. Drinks nicely, a little bit too much licorice for my tastes but solid otherwise."
"Opaque in color with a tan head that stays around. Aroma of chocolate, slight dark fruit, syrup, cinnamon, and booze (a bit threatening). Cream, roast, earth, dark chocolate, bitterness/alcohol and dark cinnamon cocoa ride out the finish. Thick body with light carbonation. A slow sipper but the booze isn't very present on the palate. In a world where it's tough to make an impact with an imperial stout these days Thirsty Dog does an admirable effort. This isn't the best out there but in consideration for the sixth man award."
"D: this beer features a nice aroma, but the taste doesn't quite match it. Worth a try, but with all the other terrific imperial stouts, I don't see myself going back to this."
"D: This beer makes for a nice nightcap, nice and sweet with a hint of bitterness and sticky on the lips. I really enjoy the long finish of coffee and just a touch of hops as well. Nothing overly impressive, just a solid imperial stout."
"Solid drink. It's a big stout, but 12oz bottles make it easy to drink 1, and even a second wouldn't be out of the question."
"warm and fuzzy, and personally hard to drink. maybe bad bottle? look and smell is good, but taste is nothing to brag about."
"I'm a big fan of this one and glad I got a 4-pack. Yet, its missing that aggressive hoppy bitterness I've grown fond of in Russian Imperials Stouts. At the same time, it's very easy to drink for the style."
"Very smooth and well-rounded with lots of bittersweet roastiness that reminds me of semi-dark chocolate or medium dark coffee, but with a chewy fullness closer to something like milk chocolate. The 9% ABV is perceptible, but it only adds to the body. Great beer."
"Drinkability is quite easy for a 9+ percent beer."
"M & D - Both are okay and i'll take them if someone else had them at a party or something. but it's not something i would specifically go out and look for."
"Pours just like you would expect. Black as the abyss with a dark tan head. The complex flavor consists of roasted rye bread, dark fruits, with a bitter finish. It's very good, but perhaps not as full and beat-you-over-the-head aggressive as other RISs. Probably the easiest drinking RIS I have had. The bitterness takes quite a while to saunter off, as well."
"Morey's Bottom Line: The best beer that I've had from Thirsty Dog without a doubt. I've had better within the style, but this is definitely above average."
"D - two or so, but the bitter hit would get old."
"Amazing beer one of my favorite stouts."
"D: Almost didn't want to sip this RIS initially due to the odd aroma. Turned out well, but every now and again got hit by the off putting aroma."
"The nose is a nice mix of dark chocolate, roast, and a slight hint of leather. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet start gives way to a smooth transition to a roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavor. Some lingering bitterness at the end. The 9.7% really doens't show all that much in the nose or the taste. Could use a slightly heavier mouthfeel is my only gripe."
"D: Damn good RIS, especially at the price-point. Not quite old raspy, but not that far off, all-in-all."
"(Drinkability): For a 9.70% ABV, this beer is surprisingly easy to take in. If it's one you enjoy exponentially, 2 or 3 down the hatch would make a decent drink session. I would prefer a Storm King over this, but it is a pretty good RIS regardless."
"drinkability a well rounded and full flavored imperial stout that can be enjoyed anywhere any time."
"Pours a dark blackish-brown hue with a brown head in my beer mug. It has a nice 2 finger foamy head with decent retention and good thin lacing. Doesn't seem to be a lot of carbonation to this beer. It has a nice chocolate, sweet malts and coffee aroma that is pleasing to the nose. The taste is dark chocolate with some sweet malts, caramel, raisins, alcohol and a slight coffee flavor. It also has a hint of hops in the middle that the malts cover the taste of. It is a nicely balanced taste that is bitter, but not too bitter. It has a pleasant creamy crisp clean mouthfeel. I can imagine the chocolate and caramel melting in my mouth. Kind of like having liquid chocolate covered raisins, very yummy and very drinkable. A must have for all the stout drinkers out there."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, caramel, and very slight alcohol. The flavor was of Sweet malt, chocolate, caramel, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. Had a good aroma and flavor going on here. The mouthfeel on it was pretty nice too. The alcohol actually helps enhance this brew as it is not overpowering and seems to bring some of the other flavors forward. This is a must try without doubt."
"Pours a viscous black with no head, just a thin tan lace. This beer is almost flat, there is just a hint of carbonation. The aroma is of chocolate and coffee, with a tinge of sweet malt. The flavor is well balanced. Coffee and chocolate malt dominate. The beer is balanced well between sweetness and bitterness. There is no perceptible hop flavor. The alcohol is well hidden. A very good RIS, but needs a tad bit more carbonation."
"D- Drinkable, so many flavors hit you at once."
"D: The mouthfeel and clashing of hops with roasted flavors kills this beer for me. I really wanted to like this beer considering the brewery is kinda local."
"Great big beer for $9.99 a 6-pack."
"D: Very good for a beer of this strength."
"D-Very good for a RIS, but not great. I like this and wish it were available in the PNW since offered as a single 12 oz. bottle. Wish more West Coast brewers would bottle RIS in 12 oz. vs. 22 oz."
"D-very easy to drink, not as complex or rich as other RIS, but a good one nonetheless"
"drinkability: Well its not an A stout but a solid offering. I'll seek a fresh one in the future to test. This was a gift."
"Pours a very dark, opaque black color with a small tan head. Smells of chocolate roasty goodness. Yum. Taste is more of the smell, with a strong flavor of roasted malts and a secondary flavor of chocolate. The flavor is of moderate intensity, which is a bit reserved relative to some RIS's. Mouthfeel is medium with low to medium carbonation. I would say this is quite drinkable as it doesn't overdo anything and achieves a pretty reasonable balance of flavor. This is a good example of a no-bells-and-whistles RIS."
"Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by this one. I've had Thirsty Dog brews before, but this is by far the best I've had from them. Well done. I got to enjoy some of their brew at a brewfest in the summer, and I was quite excited to try more of their offerings. Definite win!"
"This is a mighty fine ale, and from Ohio! I don't give Thirsty Dog enough credit. They produce some really good beers, and this one is a stand out. Incredibly palatable, though more than one may be asking for trouble, this imperial stout stands among some of the best I've tried. It is rich, full-bodied, and well-balanced."
"Yeah, I will give this another try in the future. It is not as complex as other RIS's that I have tried, but it has a solid flavor and good overall quality."
"This really doesn't play on level with the Russian Imperial Stouts. It just take like a burnt regular stout with a little extra alcohol. Nothing special, but not terrible. I would take this over a Coors or Miller and drink it at a bar where nothing else good was around."
"D: Won't go out of my way to find it"
"D: an enjoyable enough stout, but lacks the je na se quoi of a great stout."
"This is definitely a pretty decent stout here coming from Thirsty Dog. Opaque black with smallish head, nose is roasty, a bit smokey, some chocolate there too. Taste follows with a nice RIS, set apart from some others by a oak-y flavor to it. Not bad at all. MF is a bit thin (that might be because we had tasted BCBVS, BCBS, KBS, and some other big guys that night). Decent drink, overall a pretty good beer that's worth checking out."
"CHEERS!!"
"Great for a one time drink or if a friend just happened to give it to me, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"The body is not as full as your might expect for an Imperial but it is very drinkable."
"d - A pretty good RIS. I''ve had it a few times and would certainly pick it up again if I saw it. Some nice chocolate in the smell and taste and very easy to drink. The ABV is well hidden."
"Best part about this beer is that its readily available year round, no seasonal here."
"flavors. Nothing overbearing, everything blends together well. Very drinkable for style, not as heavy as it could be. A good imperial stout thr isn't super heavy."
"Drinkability: This is a great tasting, easy drinking stout...no doubt about it. It has some good flavor, and it doesn't hit like a big beer even though it is. I'm glad I finally opened this one up, I'm wishing I did it sooner. Thanks again BJ!"
"If you like imperial stouts,you will find this one pleasing and suprisingly smooth."
"The mouth is pretty full and heavy, but there is a harshness to the carbonation that is a little off-putting for the style. Bubbles play on the tongue. Nice roasted character in the flavor. Reminds me of freshly roasted coffee beans. Some semi-sweet baking chocolate, plum, and almond also noted. Well-rounded flavor. This was one of the better beers I've had from TD. A good one for the crisp cool evenings upon us. Sit back and enjoy."
"D - nice flavors and without a trace of alcohol. Could definitely put back a few on a cold winter night."
"Definitely drinkable, though not as good as I remember it being in prior years. Still, I'll happily finish this four pack."
"very drinkable. I like this one and at $7.50 a 4-pack, runs a few dollars cheaper for me than some of the big name stouts. It IS slightly worse, but not much so and if I don't feel like spending more this is a great alternative."
"Pours an opaque dark, dark brown. An OK tan head-ring thinly laces the glass. Smell is malty and meaty; dark roasted cacao. Taste is beyond chocolate. Café mocha, with almost a hint of dark fruit, especially cherry. All the while, an alcohol feel lurks in the background. This one is pretty heavy on that, but it's not unbearable at all. The finish is smoothly thin, but woody and dry, leading to another sip - and seriously, the drinkability on this stout is very high. An absolute drinker."
"D - Siberian Night is a pretty good RIS. It's not as big and bold as some other RIS's but that's not a bad thing. The vanilla put this on the sweeter side of the RIS spectrum, which worked well for this beer. Very solid effort by Thirsty Dog. I'll have to sit on my other bottle for a little while and see what happens."
"Drinkability is good,as big stouts go. A taste starts dense then wettens to go down nice. I would not plan to pound down 3 or 4 in an afternoon,but watching a football game, I could enjoy a couple. More of a sipper. Not overpriced,good buy,and good night... Good SIBERIAN night."
"Good RIS, and reasonably priced as RIS's go."
"Overall a decent beer, not stellar but can hold its own. The flavor and transition between flavors left me wanting something more. The body was lacking. My complaints may be personal preference but it is what it is. Definitely worth a try."
"D: This doesn't introduce any radical flavors into the mix, but it's just a good, solid RIS. It doesn't disappoint, but it doesn't impress, either."
"Medium bodied, this drinks easily enough, I would have ordered a second if it wasn't so late."
"D - Drinkability is scary good for what it is. Wouldn't want to drink this all night, as you wouldn't remember much after about 3 or 4 of them. This is a superior RIS."
"Drinkability: It's good, but I've definitely had better -- doesn't really meet the mark of a Blackout Stout, or even the ubiquitous Old Rasputin, but the price point is easy enough on the wallet ($2.05/bottle); really, just misses out on what I feel it should be in terms of flavor and mouthfeel; also, considering the weight and 9% ABV, I don't think that more than 2 in an entire night would be necessary."
"D: Exceptional all around. Goes down easy, suave and not overpowering but totally satisfying. A rare RIS you could drink all (Siberian) night."
"D: Good to average overall. Nothing really memorable about this RIS."
"The heavy body and palate-destroying roast detracts from drinkability. Having one is not a problem, but I couldn't see consuming much more than that in a sitting. I stumbled across this one without knowing anything about it and am glad I gave it a try."
"Beer is smooth and kind of ashy at the back. Strong roasty bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, mildly creamy, a little thin. Sweetness is mild, its a complex big flavored beer. Its quite good, heavy in the mouth though. Its a good decent RIS. Glad I had it. Thank sitarist for this thoughtful extra in our improptu trade."
"D - A excellent IS. Didn't notice the 9.7% ABV at all."
"D: After hearing this beer discussed as if it was harder to drink than straight absinthe i am surprised. Totally drinkable, though i would never have more than one stout a night. suitable as a sippable nightcap."
"OVERALL: Pretty good stuff. Unfortunately the nose is a little weak and the head just doesn't do anything for the brew, but the taste profile, with the stronger coffee flavors, made this an enjoyable brew. One worth having again. Thanks again guys!"
"Overall, quite easy to drink and enjoyable though the mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side and not up to par with the style."
"All in all, a solid beer. It won't be a favorite of mine, since beers this roasty never are - but other than that and the somewhat weak mouthfeel, this is a good beer for what it is."
"This is a great beer, but I'm partial to RIS's. Not the best ever, but this one definitely holds its own, something I did not expect from a brewery I've never heard of until tonight."
"The 9.00%abv is very well hidden. The smoothness of this, along with the great flavor, help make it a nicely drinkable beer."
"Pours a dark black with a slight dark tan head and some sticky lacing as it goes down my snifter. The nose has some familiar notes of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate, but nothing too outstanding. The taste is much the same, but lacks the overall intensity of some of the better stouts. Medium to full body. Much better than the average RIS, but not among the best."
"overall - this beer reminds me a lot of Surly Darkness. Its a big hoppy RIS. I prefer RIS's with little to no hops, but this is still a tasty beer. It is quite drinkable, especially for an RIS."
"Inky black in color with one finger of head that quickly settled to a thin film. A little spotty lacing is left on the glass. Rich, bitter chocolate aroma that is mouth watering. Hints of coffee and alcohol as well. Not the most powerful aroma. Things really pick up in the flavor department. This is where it counts and this beer did well. Rich malty flavor that oozes over the entire palate. Hints of chocolate, coffee, and even aspects of tobacco and smoke. A little warmth in the finish. More on the bitter side than the sweet as it does have 58 IBUs. Just the right amount of bitter to balance with the malt. The body is not as thick and silky smooth as it could be. Feels a touch thin and overcarbonated. Not too sweet or too bitter. Just right for my tastes."
"D_Pretty damn drinkable ."
"The bottled version isn't as good as the tap. In my opinion, this is the best beer Thirsty Dog brews."
"D- great, easy to finish and went down smooth."
"Good beer with a dog motif = win. A suburb example of the style. Pours dark warm gray with a rust colored tan head that foams up to the top. Smells like a saw mill and cocoa. Taste is bitter sweet like toasted almonds dipped in dark chocolate. The beer feels thick and sudsy on the tongue. This beer is as drinkable as they come if you like the style."
"Overall, this is a pretty decent imp. Its sweet, and has a ton of smoke, the most i've had in imp. Worth getting if you see it out, wouldn't trade for it."
"D- Somewhat drinkable, though I would probably only settle for 1 or 1.5 at one time. Great for kicking back and drinking slowly."
"D - The smell was a bit off putting for me, but man the taste and mouthfeel more than made up for it, this is a great balanced and super tasty Imperial Stout and a good value too."
"Siberian Night created a moderate amount of head that dissipated quickly, but still left a proper amount of lacing. In the glass it was pitch dark in color, as the name would suggest. Its aroma was bursting with roasted malt character, with whiffs of sweetness and bits of perceived chocolate and bitterness. The flavor was heavy on roasted malts, with suggestions of toasty nuttiness and sweet caramel. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more of a player with added sweetness and is balanced as the bitter from the roast and the hops step up in concert. Towards the end it coalesces into a bitter chocolate covered cherry. The body is full and the carbonation is moderate."
"One of my favorite stouts."
"I paired this with my wife's homemade chocolate chip cookies, and they worked great together!"
"This will now become a staple in my cellar!"
"I've had this beer on 2 separate occasions. A few years back I thought it was one of the best stouts I'd ever had. Then I had it last year and thought it was 'meh'. And now, it's still in the 'meh' category. Maybe this beer has lost a step since it's glory days a few years back."
"Bottle pours a dark black with a little bit of foam, forming. The taste is of charred roasted bitterness, with chocolate and coffee mixing in the background. The alc. % is very well hidden as its not picked up in the taste at all. Not a bad stout, not amazing, but its solid."
"D - Got this as an extra in a trade. Good beer overall, but nothing I would seek out again."
"Siberian Night Imperial Night pours black as midnight with a brown head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. It smells like a chocolate milkshake. The flavor is very nice, malty, lots of chocolate. Alcohol isn't really noticeable. A very enjoyable beer."
"Basing my thoughts on what others have said about this beer, I'd have to conclude that a year of age on Siberian Night puts it past its prime. It's definitely lost something. That said, it's still a very solid stout, and I'd love to try it again -- fresh."
"D- a nice year round RIS that i wish was available in my neck of the woods. its nice to see it in 12oz bottles also. something id pick up every once in a while if i could."
"The taste is different and relatively complex. Glad I got to try this one and recommend it if you like a good RIS."
"Pours from the bottle like used motor oil, thick and black, with merely a suggestion of thin tan foam. A good smokiness wafts up from the glass, along with some coffee, dark cherries and roasted malt. Not a lot of heat on the palate here, but some good roasted chocolate flavors and a little bit of syrupy sweetness. My first beer from this brewery and hopefully not my last."
"D: All right. I wouldn't want to have too many in a row."
"Received this as an extra in a trade over a year ago, been aging it in my basement ever since. Its dark Black with no light passing through. There is a light brown/off white head which gets darker with swirling. This has solid lasting lacing. Very aromatic for a stout with sweet cream, mild earth and roasted nuts. The first taste is oh so smooth with mild sweetness, followed by a deep creamy nutty malt blast with a milder than expected hop fade. There is little to no bitterness and no cloying sweetness. The aftertaste is pleasant. To me, this one has it all, a full bodied thick velvety drinkable stout. It reminds me a bit of Stone RIS, but is more drinkable while being almost as bold. I'm astonished by this brew and I would Love to get some more. Fantastic!"
"Not bad, though much hoppier than I remembered it being. Not something to trade or go ga-ga for, but give it a whirl if it presents itself to you."
"Not bad at all. This one may be lacking in boldness, but without a doubt it's one of the most drinkable Imperial Stouts on the market right now. You're better off pairing to complement, take our word for it. Chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate, the darker the better."
"Rich, deep chocolate pour, beige frothy head stays awhile, then shrinks to lacing. I am not impressed with the aroma, I can't detect any...the taste is more interesting than the nose...full-bodied taste of chocolate, toffee, and coffee! This is a great offering from Thirsty Dog. I will definitely search this out again."
"D - One 12oz bottle went down quite easy, and I could probably do a second with the excellent feel and an ABV on the lower end of the RIS spectrum. Also, quite reasonably priced - wish this one was available in Illinois."
"Taste is very rich and sharp. Lots of chocolate and smoke. Taste is sweet and smooth with coffee on the finish."
"D - Fantastic, I wish they made 750's of this. 4.5"
"D: another one in the books. I don't know if this is worthy of another buy? I find it sits in the upper middle section of my imperial stout list, nothing really stands out and nothing is unfriendly. Give it a try and see what happens"
"Take care, beer fiends."
"D: Very good, but filling."
"Another local treat."
"D- Definitely an awesome IS, wish I could get more easily here in TX"
"D- This one goes down pretty easy. I wish they would of also stayed in sixers."
"From the bottle into the pint glass, slightly chilled, this dark beauty shows a dark black brown, solid color with a fair brown head and similar lacing. The aroma is a nice blend of raisin coffee and mango fruit. The flavor is much the same with a very smooth mouthful of coffee licorice. It's smooth and silky in feel, medium bodied and fair drinking for the style. Looking forward to another!"
"D: High, and could sip a four pack in a night. this one is right up there with old rasputin as a go to RIS that is available year round."
"D---This is a good beer, not great in my eyes. If you enjoy a higher IBU in your Imperials, this one might be a winner. The hops are a little too much of the flavor. I would be interested to see how this mellows after some time in the cellar. Recommended but not loved."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. Next time I see some I'll be grabbing a few bottles as this was the only in my cellar."
"A really nice example of a RIS, feel fortunate to have Thirsty Dog brewing literally in my backyard; going to go get a growler full of this one very soon indeed!"
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"The beer lives up to its name it is pitch black, like used motor oil. It had a nice 1 1/2"" of dark tan head when poured into a pint glass. Smooth and creamy in texture. Taste starts off with notes of chocolate, coffee and caramel flavor then moves to a slightly hoppy and for a brief second alcohol flavor then finishes with a coffee flavor and strong ""roasted and toasted"" malts flavor. It coats your mouth and stays with you for a while. A very complex flavor. Over all I would say it is a good stout. I noticed a bitter flavor near the end which wasn't my favorite and a brief alcohol burn. I got this six pack over two years ago and when I first had it I hated it (more novice user taste error than the beer's fault) and it has sat on my shelf and aged. Now that I have started to like heavier beers it now is quite enjoyable. I.E. A Bud light drinker probably won't like it."
"After checking my watch, these 3 oz. samples went way too fast. I am not a huge fan of RIS, but this would please anyone when paired with a nice desert. This Thirsty Dog will fill the belly and warm the soul on any cold Siberian Night."
"Consumed: 2/8/2010"
"Drinkablitiy suffers a tad from the alcohol...this one is definitely a sipper but what RIS isn't?"
"Overall this is a very good imperial stout. Paired well with some grilled peaches and ice cream."
"The alcohol is well hidden, the taste is smooth, the color is jet black...try this."
"nice hop balance for a 4 year old IS. malt bitterness contributes to the overall enjoyability of this take on the style. id love to try a recent vintage."
"If the body was boosted a bit, I would call this a great representation of a RIS, but it's just lacking that. While the usual tastes are there they just are not pronounced as others in the style. This is probably why im drinking this so quick. This is a great stout for the price point."
"I like it. It's good but the bar for RIS has been set so high it makes this seem less impressive."
"D- Moderate. Good drinkin', an imperial stout that executes farly well. No major complaints in any category, Not a 5-star beer but well-rounded and beautifully crafted. A winner."
"Serving type: bottle"
"F: FInishes pretty bitter still, slightly sweet from the heavy malts still. The thick malts just sit around the mouth as they created a layer. The roast never seems to go away too. A long lingering bitterness but nice. Slight boozy warmth but hides it pretty well otherwise."
"Drinkability was quite good. This is a tasty and complex Russian imperial stout that masks it alcohol content quite well. Unlike many American versions of the style, this one does not overwhelm the palate with hops. At a mere $3 a bottle, it is definitely worth trying."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with no freshness date. Very dark black when poured into my glass. Very little carbonation with about a half inch of creamy dark foam. Rich roasted scents of coco, a few scents of roasted nuts. Heavy, thick syrupy mouthfeel. Strong coco and roasted malts flavors. Also some toasty breaded malt flavors. Alcohol is very warming. This brew is very nice to sip at, no disappointments here."
"It might as well be a Siberian night out there in this frigid Boston weather. Many thanks to milliken586 for sending this stout, which was on my wants list. Pour is pitch black in color, as expected, with a medium sized tan head that fades quickly to a tiny lacing. Smell is quite nice, with some cookie dough, dark chocolate, char, and a teeny hint of dark fruit. An interesting smoky quality comes through in the taste, along with some bitter coffee in the finish...both of which were unexpected based on the nose. Overall that taste is really nice with all its roasted qualities...ideal for a cold night. Mouthfeel is large and in charge, with loads of complexity between the smoke and hops. The nine percent can be felt in the taste, but with this one I almost feel like that is part of the point. This is an Imperial Stout that grew on me with every sip, which makes me only want to try more (if not everything) from the Thirsty Dog lineup. I remember being really interested in trying this one since my first days on BA, so extra special props to the generous trader."
"Drinkable...yes! A great example of the style...will keep this stocked!"
"Pours a dark cola like color with a skim of a brown colored head. The head gives way to a minimal amount of lacing. The smell is of burnt toast, caramel, and coffee malt. The taste is of a roasted malt backbone with hints of coffee and caramel. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated with no slickness to it. Drinkability is high, there is no alcohol burn or sting with the taste even though the abv is 9. Very drinkable beer."
"I like this. It seems like the goal was to make a traditional RIS, with some hop character, minus the extreme roasted character found in many of the big, US brewed Russian Imperial stouts. Dig it, very drinkable."
"All in all, I was excited to try this brew as it was on my wants list for a little while before I got it as an extra. This one really surprised me as it is better than I expected. Fantastic brew if you're looking for a unique flavor twist on a stout."
"A very nice Russian imperial Stout- time for a taste test comparison of my favorite RIS'es...!"
"D-this has a great balance to it with a ton of roasted malty goodness. Hints of sweetness in the back to give it some nice complexity. Awesome example of the style!"
"Coffee Stout. Pours black with a dark brown tint. Brownish, dark caramel head that leaves a frothy half fingers worth of foam throughout the experience. Big coffee in the nose, cocoa nibs and dark chocolate. Minimal hop presence in the nose, a bit more prominent in the taste category. Lots of dark chocolate, lightly roasted coffee beans, more cocoa and a bit of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and medium oily but it's not as chewy as it could be. Alcohol is very well hidden. Decent."
"M/D- not the thickest by anymeans, but it's still a big thick beer. almost a little over carbonated, but that characteristic actually adds to the drinkability a little bit...it goes down easy than most Impy stouts. a could have a couple or three of these."
"Just fantastic carbonation and a perfect RIS style mouthfeel. For $2-3 a bottle, you can do no better. Awesome stuff!"
"Easier to drink when cooler as the sweetness expands greatly as it warms. Basically a sipper for me, though I did sip quickly. I liked it but one at a time is enough."
"One deserves another - great beer!"
"I have had this beer in the past, but I never appreciated it as much as I do now. Its so full of flavor and complexity, I couldn't imagine a better dessert beer than this. Well worth the money. Excellent Imperial Stout."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, black and roasted malt scent along with a dry, earthy character. The taste is good as well. It has a stiff, warmth that comes out and grabs you. The malt bill is well crafted with loads of roasted and caramel malts. This is a slow drinker, but one with lots of character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well crafted IS. It's complex and flavorful with the perfect amount of heat."
"2008 bottle that's been in my ""cellar"" for a little over a year. Poured inky black viscous liquid into my glass with a thin chocolate head that didn't last long. Smell is roasty chocolate malts. Kind of reminds me of the chocolate covered espresso beans you get at Trader Joe's. Lots of chocolate roasted malt in the taste, as well as some coffee with a touch of booze and raisins. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium to full body. Drinkability is solid, still a bit of heat that could benefit from more time. In just a year this beer has made some progress. I really liked it fresh and I'm liking it even more with just a years time. I'm excited to see where this one will go."
"D: A solid, well-made, easy to drink Russian Imperial Stout."
"Overall, it was good, but not that great. Good for if you would like 1 beer and you are not driving."
"MF/D: Creamy, viscous, full bodied, lingering dark chocolate/lactose finish. Subtly mellow, very very nicely done. Alcohol is very well hidden throughout, even when warmed up."
"D - Delicious. There is no doubt that you are drinking a RIS. There is big bold flavors and slight nip of alcohol. There is very smooth, and could be dangerous if you had more than a couple in a night. Very nice beer though."
"This beer is great. My wife is jealous of this beer because I like it so much. Buy it. Drink it."
"Summary: Very smooth. Lacks a little bit of alcohol bite in the aftertaste, but overall a very drinkable beer. Much less ""in your face"" than other stouts. Good for someone who is just trying a dark beer for the first time."
"Overall a quiet and content RIS that makes itself very welcoming to experienced and new craft beer drinkers. Elegant and mild mannered, but still has everything an Imperial Stout should. Tasty and welcomed at my house anytime."
"In all this is a really solid stout. I love to represent the Ohio beers, this is a good way to do so."
"D: Save for the nose, this was a nice beer, a touch boozy, but overall a beer that I would have again."
"Pours very dark, very dark. Looks black, even in the light. The head is small and thin. Dark browen, loose bubbles, gone in a flash. The smell is nice. Clean, with a touch of burnt sugar sweetness. Chocolate really comes through in this one, with a kind of weak, burnt coffee note. Pretty interesting, with just a note of yeast in the end. The taste is pretty interesting. Kind of simple, but nice. A chocolatey sweet coffee, kind of thin, with a bit of an alcohol burn in the finish. I wouldn't call this pedestrian - pretty well-made, maybe a bit predictable though. The coffee hits again in the finish. The bubbles don't burn, the alcohol does a bit though. A decent roastiness keeps me going, but the alcohol will keep me from ever reaching for more than one."
"I remember this one being better last year. For some reason, this 2009 bottle seems overly carbonated and a bit thin. 2008 was much more creamier."
"D- I didn't love drinking a full 12 ounces of this beer. It's definitely not a bad beer by any means, but I felt that it did not live up to the expectations I had based on reviews and word of mouth. I could see this brew mellowing and coming together with a year or so on it, but I have not had the chance to cellar any yet."
"Great beer."
"Easily one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts out there.. it's year-round as well."
"D - The strong roasted and coffee notes are just a bit wearing to me. ABV is high, but well hidden. Not filling. Just a bit too potent for the palette in a session."
"Thanks again Jason!!"
"Very roasty flavor with hints of bitter dark chocolate, rosted coffee bean, toffee, slight dark fruit, oatmeal and a slight alcohol warmth. Slightly hoppy in the finish, producing a bitter dry finish."
"Drinkability seams quite good to me. As I said this seams like a milder version of this style and I feel its pretty easy to drink. It may be a good one to try if you've never had this style. I would certainly have a few more."
"Overall a phenomenal beer."
"Drinkability: I've had a lot of intense, mouth-searing, head-knocking, ass-kicking RIS's; but this one went a different route: that of balance, beauty, and smoothness. This beer felt like a hug from an old friend. Seriously, fantastic!"
"The candy-like maltness makes this a relatively tough beverage to rate highly on drinkability. Not that I expect to throw back a sixer of any RIS, but this one's almost forgettable. It's good, but it can't compete well with the best of its peers. Cool bottle, cool beer, but that just doesn't cut it anymore."
"I knew after trying Old Leghumper (Thirsty Dog's American Porter), the Dog's would not let me down with this one - and they didn't. No ifs ands or buts about it, this beer deserves nothing less than a solid ""A" rating. ~"
"Very good creamy mouthfeel, and hardly any alcohol presence."
"Moutfeel: Not as heavy as I would have thought. Though the alcohol content is high, there is an essence of drinkability."
"D - Very enjoyable, this is a choice stout indeed. The alcohol is well-hidden & this critter is blended incredibly well. I think this beer is phenomenal. All that & I'm not sure but what this particular bottle wasn't a bit roughed up. Highly recommended."
"I have to admit, this was one of the beers I was a bit weary of due to its high rating. I actually expected it to be overrated, but I don't think it is at all. Drinkability is impacted by some heat, but all in all, a very solid offering."
"Delicious! This is quickly becoming my favorite style of beer and this is a fine representative of the style. Too strong to session but a good full bodied beer for cold months."
"D: very tasty I'd most definitely have this again. Although not as complex as some others, this creation represents the RIS category well. A most worthy beer."
"Exceptional beer, highly recommened."
"Thanks Alex."
"Bottle courtesy of bret27. Pours black with reddish brown highlights and a thin cocoa-colored head. Aroma is huge dark chocolate with some graham sweetness and a significant boozy note. Flavor is big roasted malts with a light red fruitiness and a slightly boozy finish. The alcohol thins out the body just a little bit but this remains pretty drinkable."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a nice opaque with a decent tan head that slowly diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a decent amount of roasted malts and cocoa. The taste is loads of roasty cocoa and slight espresso. The beer is slightly heavy with warming alcohol, one I'd certainly love to have again."
"Drinkability - a potent brew, but I'd easily have another. Great one to cellar also."
"Overall I thought this was a solid RIS that didn't disappoint, but it didn't really blow me away either. That being said I had high expectations and this is definitely still worth a shot."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that I enjoyed less and less as I drank it. At first smell and taste, I thought it would get a solid A. Now its much lower. The bitterness on the back is annoying, and the somewhat thin mouthfeel makes the beer a little weak for the style overall. ABV wise, its almost 10%, and I give it credit for being fairly well hidden."
"And I should give recognition to MasterSki for this bottle. Thanks Alex!"
"poured into a snifter,this beer is pitch black with a nice tan head.nose is roasted coffee,dark chocolate,with a little bit of molasses. taste is dark chocolate,roasted coffee,carmelized sugar with bitter coffee acridity in the finish.pretty thick mouthfeel with a bit of carbonation,this is a highly drinkable russian imperial stout.this is my go to RIS,especially in term of cost at 10.59 for a six pack.love it."
"D - This is a fantastic RIS and can hold up to most of the big dogs out there. I am very pleased with this offering."
"The beer is solid black, opaque, with a creamy dark brown head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is all roasty, toasty malt and maybe some wine-like berry notes. The flavor is robust, with lots of the malt character from the aroma, big caramel, and a little espresso on the finish. Terrific evening beer, especially if it's cold outside. The first time I had this was at the Hop Cat in Grand Rapids, Michigan and it was one of my great beer experiences. Pick yourself up a six-pack."
"This was a pleasant surprise coming from a reasonably priced six pack. Definitely a beer I'd have again. Compares well to Old Rasputin."
"This one's as drinkable as any RIS (being a powerful style in itself), though the 9.7% (not 9.0% as stated) hinders the drinkability just a bit."
"D- A solid RIS that doesn't quite compete with the big boys but definitely holds it's own."
"Siberian Husky pours very rich and dark with a 1/2", long lasting head. A great coffee and chocolate aroma. The taste followed suit with the aroma, a little sweet, not bitter. The feel was heavy and oily, not a problem at all. I don't believe I would enjoy a full six pack, but must admit, the first one didn't have a chance before it was a dead soldier. Now that I gave it much chance, but as it warmed, taste and aroma did not diminish, but remained fairly consistent. I liked everything about this beer."
"D - While I do enjoy Stouts this is certainly a once in awhile beer. Overall I was impressed. The somewhat high ABV was very well masked by the rich flavors of the beer. Great sipping beer."
"Pours a deep, opaque sable with a fairly thick, fine-bubbled light tan head. Rich aroma is smoky and oily with a firm undertone of fine roast coffee, promising an excellent stout. Flavor is strong, mainly of fine roast coffee, surprisingly but not unpleasantly bitter, with hints of chocolate, toffee and molasses. Texture is thick, smooth as glass, tingly and edgy. This lip-smacking stout is worth sniffing out."
"This baby is as black as it gets, not a hint of light passing through, and the head is darker then most of the beers on the market. The scent takes one back, and you know immediately this is a ber to be reckoned with. Dark chocolate and black licorice war with each other, and as the alcohol rises to conquer you can feel the wolves eyes glow. The flavor starts slowwith dark fruit, smoke and bready malt rolling slow into a powerfull bitter chocolate finish. It has an oatmeal smoothness acrossed the toungue, but the is an underlining alcohol throughout that would make it hard to drink several."
"D--As much as it may seem like I am being critical of this beer, it truly is magnificent and great to drink. I am being harsh mainly because there is so much more potential, but believe me if I had this one easily available to me it would be a permanent staple in my fridge. Great beer, worth trying at least once."
"Way thin in the mouth for an imperial anything."
"D: A very nice RIS. I'd seek it out more often if it were available in DC. On that note, I find it rather odd that Thirsty Dog distributes in Virginia Beach but not DC."
"D- Very easy to drink, I took much bigger sips than I intended. I love black licorice so I was quite pleased by the aftertaste. I could definitely have a few of these in a row and will pick it up again the next time I see it!"
"I'm used to a lot of coffee and a hint of chocolate in my Russian Imperials but the strong alcohol taste in hurting the over all effect. I'm not done with Thirsty Dog... I'll be back."
"Notes: Another winner from Thirsty Dog but the greatness of others that I tried (Cerebrus among others) was not met with this one."
"I'm glad I was finally able to get my hands on this coveted beer. And it was only fittinghat I pick up this six-pack right ater I my eight dark lords on DLD!!!"
"Picked this up for a cheap $2.75 at Maine Brewing Supply (yes, they sell great beer as well as homebrew equipment) in Portland, ME. Opaque stout brown/black with a smallish head. Poured soft and velvety. Aromas of dark roasty malts, slight smoke, and a shy hoppyness. Wow, some really deep flavors here. This is plenty sweet with coffee and chocolate but has a depth of leather and hints of paint. Deliciously sweet though, in a deliciously non-cloying way. Nice balance here, and a nice warmth of booze. I have no way of knowing how old this is (I should've asked) but it almost tastes like an aged stout. More specifically, it is so goddamn smooth. Velvet on the tongue. I probably drank this puppy down in 5 mins, not typically the norm for me. I thought this was gonna be a pretty good beer, but I didn't really have high enough expectations. Totally awesome stout that I would buy again and again, if I could..."
"M/D: Thick and heavy, creamy, velvety, medium carbonation. Very nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is standard for a sipper, maybe a bit better. Big beer, big taste. Good stuff."
"This is one of the easier drinking impy stouts I have tried. Everything is in perfect balance."
"Pitch black with a big sticky dark tan head. Good retention. A nice mix of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt with hints of hops and a little alcohol that singes the nostrils if you inhale too deeply. A nice roasty RIS with coffee flavors and a little alcohol burn on the finish that the style is known for. Not one of the hoppiest versions of the style, but with decent bitterness that doesn't quite get astringent. Alcohol is noticeable, but not hot. Creamy, but with a little carbonic bite. A good example of the style."
"Very good stout."
"Final verdict is an excellent beer. A run-of-the-mill excellent RIS. Never knew there was such a thing, but there you go. Looking forward to trying this one with another few months on it."
"D - Excellent Imperial stout that I've been wanting to try for quite a while. Incredibly drinkable and very mellow with no noticeable alcohol whatsoever... especially for a 9% beer! Big thanks to FooFaa for breaking out this vintage bottle that turned into my favorite beer of the night!"
"D - This beer is damn tasty. I can go on drinking this stuff. If only it was not thick, it would be most drinkable."
"Note 2: I also have another bottle of this brew which is about 6 months old that I got somehow (LIF/BIF/trade?) from another fantastic BA, Thanks!"
"I could easily drink a few of these and the alcohol is almost unnoticeable in the flavor. Pretty good, I might get back to this."
"D: Delicious and quite drinkable at 9%"
"D- Very smooth for an Imperial Stout. This one could sneak up on you in a hurry! Very good."
"Dark brown, almost black and impossible to see through with a dark reddish tan head that leaves fine lace on the glass. Smells of heavily roasted malt,chocolatey coffee and anise. Tastes like the smell times ten, tons of smokey roasted malt, black licorice and fudge with some coffee like bitterness to try and balance. Thick and viscous, bordering on chewy mouthfeel. A really nice RIS. The bottle I have says 9.7% ABV."
"D - Hard to drink a lot of these, but a few to start the night would be a good call."
"The drink is on the full-bodied side with excellent carbonation. Sporting an ABV of 9%, Thirsty Dog's Imperial Stout is a sipper by definition, but the brew is quite excellent, and is definitely one I'll seek out to enjoy again."
"I look forward to trying more Thirsty Dog brews now. I wish I had some more to try."
"D: it's a sipper, but very solid example for the style"
"Thanks CoalCellar for this one. Pours black with one finger of creamy tan head. Some sticky lacing is lasting. Aroma is of deep dark chocolate and espresso. Some sweet brown sugar and anise notes. Flavor is complex dark chocolate/fudgelike and espresso. Molasses, black licorice and fig. Finish is bitter dark chocolate and slightly alcoholic. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous with creamy carbonation feel. This is rather easy to drink, and depth evolves as the temperature rises. A real gem."
"Bottle Pours a dark colalike brown with a good light brown head. The head is creamy and last well. It also laces well. Aroma of chocolate, coffe, and alcohol. Has a good amount of carbination. A nice hearty flavor with touches of sweetness. A full body. Has a good mouthfeel. A thick texture. Has a good strong finish. This is a very good stout. Has some real good flavors on the tongue. I like it."
"I think the unique molasses/spearmint flavors really separate this one from a crowded field. Definitely recommended."
"Siberian Night doesn't leave you wanting. It didn't for me at least. Maybe not as cult or hip as some others in the style, but so what--this should not be overlooked. I waltzed past the beer store shelf this sits on many times over the years, not really sure why, but I won't be making that mistake again."
"overall a quite tasty brew...im pleased i got to try this..."
"I picked this up in Philly when it wasn't available in NC...now it is. I like that. Definitely a quality RIS."
"2/18/10: a 4-6 month old bottle has definitely improved with far less detectable alcohol, more prominent heavy roast black coffee and tobacco hops with a touch of dark chocolate, which is still heavy in the nose. Looking forward to seeing how this does over the next 18-24 months."
"I poured this thick, uber dark beer into a pint glass and was treated to a rich one-finger head. The smell was abundant with roasted grains, and perhaps roasted coffee beans. I should preface this review by saying that this style is enjoyed and highly recommended by a good friend of mine, but it is not the style I typically enjoy. It feels nice in the mouth. As for the taste...isopropyl alcohol is the first taste that hits me. This is followed by an aftertaste reminiscent of Kahlua. I'm sure these tastes are due in part to the high alcohol, but Ive had higher ABV beers without the isopropyl notes."
"This is the beer for the tough guy. 9.7% alcohol does not mess around, and its rich taste could be overwhelming for many. The taste is delicious and full, with no shortcomings. The only reason I didn't rate drinkability higher was because after a couple this gets a bit difficult to drink. Delicious as hell, however."
"A thoroughly enjoyable RIS from Thirsty Dog."
"12oz bottle. I was anxious to try this as the label trumpets multiple GABF medals. Pours black and thick like Kurkusk crude. Minimal head and lacing, leaving a small ring around the glass. Smells of heavy and dense grain pudding. Swirls elicit some sweetness. Initially drank cooler than I would have liked, and there was a harsh boozy diecetyl component that detracted significantly from the beer. This disappated upon warming, leaving a bitter core of dark chocolate, molassses, caramel, pan deglazings and a chalky element with a harsh sweet tannic finish. Overall I was disappointed, as there are several RIS that have additional complex flavors that this lacked. This felt somewhat harsh and mild at the same time. I would have expected far more from a GABF gold medalist."
"I poured this wonderful offering into a pint glass. It was black with a nice brown head. I smell chocolate, coffee, and maybe a hint of raisin. The taste is remarkable! The roasted malts really come out with a coffee aftertaste. I could drink this stuff all day, but I do not believe that the ABV would allow that. In case you couldn't tell I love this stuff. Probably one of my favorites, and I am so proud that it is brewed here in Ohio. It is my kryptonite!"
"This is a standout brew."
"Overall, a very enjoyable RIS and highly recommended."
"Gone way too soon. Were it not for the potentially debilitating abv, I could pound this sipper. Yum!"
"D - Yep, will be doing this one many more times, no doubt in my mind."
"Are Russian nights this dark!? I really enjoyed this Stout. There seemed to be yeasty/chocolate taste. My first sip was heavy on the alcohol side but gently subsided. I found myself enjoying the feel this particular stout left on my tongue. The color was oil black. I don't think I could drink too many but would be willing to give it a try!"
"Nice creamy mouthfeel with plenty of roasted malt- slightly sweet. Alcohol not as present in the taste. Very smooth- a bit of licorice plays through. As drinkable as you could ask for at 9%. Glad I got the chance to try this one- it could only improve with age."
"Drinkability - I had this on tap last week in a 42 months aged version, which was incredible, and chose to buy a six at less than $10. I had two while reviewing this, so it's a keeper, and one you can enjoy more than one of."
"Superb beer. Cheer!"
"The first sip reveals a greater level of carbonation than I anticipated as I watched the beer flow into the glass from the bottle. This isn't to say that the carbonation level is high, but that it is most certainly present. The mouthfeel does come off somewhat thin given the style, but manages to coat my tongue with plenty of bittersweet chocolate and slightly acidic roasted flavors. Finishes with a semi dry alcohol warmth with a kick of hops to balance out any residual sweetness. A fine example of the style as Thirsty Dog recreates a more classic example rather than an over the top experience presented by many other American breweries. Whether that is good or bad is likely a manner of personal tastes and mood. Regardless this beer is worth trying."
"D- It's a really easy drinker, especially considering the ABV. I'd definitely drink it again. At the price, I'd say it hangs with a lot of the higher priced competition."
"Drinkability: Age did this one quite a number, in a good way. Smooth, easy-drinking, tasty, and aromatic, with not even a scintilla of heat. I'm glad I have five of these bottles lounging away in my cellar right now - give this one three years and it turns into a beast of a delicious brew."
"Dirty engine oil black pour, dark tan head arises then recedes into a ring around the edge of the glass. Smell of roast coffee, malt and mild mocha. Big full bodied, not too much not too little carbonation. Tastes chocolately coffee upfront. Mellows slightly with some malt. Slightly chewy straighforward RIS. The roast coffee bitter with a little mocha lingers nicely quite a while. Maybe just the tiniest bit of sourness, which prevents it from getting above a 4. Drinkability on par with others of the style. Overall a solid representation of the style. Much better than the porter I had of theirs."
"Pours a very dark black with a thin brown head and only a little lacing. Big aroma of bittersweet chocolate, coffee and a lots of dark roasted,almost burnt malt. Slightly sweet for an imperial stout,Initial flavor of slightly roasted caramel and molasses with a malty smoothness all the way through, a slightly boozy nutty coffee finish. Great body, a very good beer,very well done.I wish I had more."
"D - Very smooth and easy for such a big, dark beer."
"D: very drinkable - ABV is not incredibly noticeable"
"D - This is a really good brew. My first Thirsty Dog was a good one."
"D: Boy howdy! One of my favorites.. don't think I could do a pitcher of it, but a few would be just fine. This is velvet in beer form.. Delicious dark and malty."
"D: Very drinkable RIS. I'm a fan of 9% ABV. Not outrageous, but there's still a kick."
"D_If I had to do a blind taste test, I would say this would be either a strong milk stout or a Baltic porter. Kind of a hybrid between the two. Either way I am digging the end product."
"D. While it is very porter like, it adds to the drinkability of this brew. Nice and malty, but balanced with the IBUs too."
"poured from a 12 oz bottle into a nonic."
"This was pretty good and an ok introduction to the style. Makes me want to try Stone's RIS next and see how that measures up."
"12 oz bottle picked up at a great beer store in PA on my last east coast visit. Pour is black as the night, with a thin head that fades away gradually leaving nothing but the darkness. One of the smoothest stouts I've ever had, dark and oily and if it weren't for the high alcohol content it would truly be smooth enough to session. Outstanding example of the genre."
"Overall a nice brew and worth a try"
"D- Its a really nice effort from a small brewery. I would like it a lot more if they could up the viscosity and cut back slightly on the malt roasting I felt that the charcoal notes came through a touch too strong. I still would suggest giving it a try."
"A solid RIS with plenty of the roasted malts, but lower on the complexity."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a pitch black color like used motor oil with a thin brown/tan head that took a minute to form. The retention was not very impressive and the lacing, in broken bands, not much better. The aroma was very nice, a blend of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt and a sweetness like maple syrup. The flavors were delicious- love at first sip! It started sweet with both milk chocolate and dark chocolate present along with hints of dark fruit that then went more towards molasses. The flavors then became more bitter, like bakers chocolate as the hops flexed its muscle until the coffee and resiny notes arrived for a long, tongue-coating finish. Complex and yet balanced, quaffable and rich. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation good but very soft (too soft?) and the body full without being heavy. Despite clocking in at 9.7% this beer never revealed its heat and instead was enjoyable and absolutely on-point for the style all the way through. Small changes in appearance could be made but otherwise I had nothing but praise for it."
"This is actually my first beer from Thirsty Dog, highly recommend this one."
"Drinkability: for a 9.7% beer ...hell yeah nice beeer for a session"
"D: I could have a few of these, they are delicious. They don't hide the alcohol much though. There'd be a limit."
"HV"
"Good stuff, plain and simple. This is a great example of a RIS. If you like roast-forward stouts without a lot of sweetness, then you'll like this one. Recommended."
"D: This is easily, the most drinkable RIS I've ever had. It has all the complexity (and more), flavor, and character of bigger RIS, but lacks the alcohol burn. This is a truly exceptional stout, and you stout lovers owe it to yourselves to try one. I consider myself very fortunate to have access to this stuff by the case."
"Pours a simply beautiful deep pitch black with a dark caramel colored ¼ inch head. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and licorice. Fist sip is all espresso, dark chocolate and deep almost burnt malts. Sweet then bitter, lots of complexity with dark fruits, and black licorice, and tobacco all playing supporting roles. Heavy lacing adds to the experience. Beautifully carbonated. This is a World Class RIS!"
"I think this is easily one of my favorites of this type of brew after just one tasting."
"Very rich feel, with a nice level of bitterness, its a fairly low undercurrent that still makes itself known. Earthy bittersweet bakers chocolate, dried fig or raisin sweetness, roasted malts in the back have that dry tobacco earthiness too. Body is dense, slightly viscous, this is the real deal. A rich RIS from the midwest, glad I had the chance to try it!"
"Mouthfeel is creamy with soft carbonation and finished bitter."
"Drinkability: Great on a cold night, this is a little above a sipper, a easy drinking RIS, Overall outstanding!"
"Overall, a well balanced RIS. Took no risks in the complexity department, but on the other hand, not much to complain about. Solid brew."
"Pitch black beer with a thick dark head.Aroma is chocolate and dark fruit.Taste is chocolate,espresso and fruit.This is a very good beer that goes down smooth from first to last sip.If you never had one you are truly missing out on something good.Highly recommended!!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy; very drinkable."
"Drinkability, well let's just say that this went down --really-- easy for a 9 percenter! Maybe not what it used to be but still a damn good beer!"
"3.9/5"
"Overall: Perfectly balanced stout with great flavor and though clocking at almost 10%, not too heavy to drink at all. I love this one and definitely suggest you go buy some."
"Notes: The 2006 I had wasn't brewed in Akron, and I heard it wasn't as good as the brews that were... to be honest, I liked the 2006 a lot more."
"D: This brew was a delight to have. Just amazing in the taste and look areas. The feel is the only thing that hurts this beer and I may have been a bit harsh looking back. I will have to see about revisiting this sometime. Still a very drinkable, sweet, night cap, dessert brew. Great beer."
"There's no excuse why I don't drink this one more. Very, very dark pour. Nice gray-tan head turns to a thin sparse lace, with some clinging to the sides. The nose is chocolate and dried fruit. The flavor is dark chocolate and coffee. Layers and layers of malt - roasted, toasted, delicious. Perfect hop balance remains with the sweet malt for minutes. This one has a long finish. There's alcohol warmth, but it's not boozy. One of the better Imp Stouts out there. One of those that you can forget how good it was until you pour it again."
"Overall: very impressive"
"Wow. This is a spectacular beer. It pours black with a decent rich brown head that retains well. The aromoa is rich chocolate, heavy malts and if you let it sit, the warmth of alcohol will come through. The taste starts full bittersweet chocolate with and thick malts. Alcohol mixes in as it warms the throat. Hidden flavors of rasins develop and in the end a nice balance of bitterness evens everything out. Very full bodied with less carbonation than some so its very slick in the mouth. It goes down well but also goes down warm. 9%? Oh yes. A sipper definately. Drinkability? 1 yes. 2 only for the brave souls who can manage it."
"Thirsty Dog's crafted an extremely impressive RIS. It's easily one of three finest in Ohio and goes toe to toe with Blackout Stout or BORIS the Crusher. It IS that good. My only complaint is that the nose could stand a little more strength. But, that being said, this is one of Ohio's finest. Highly recommended."
"An excellent RIS. Dangerously drinkable as this bottle was gone before I knew it. Glad I decided to go to the Liquor Stop today and noticed it."
"I'm not a HUGE Stout man...but THIS, my friends, is a HUGE STOUT!!!! WOW!! Upon popping the top, instantly I smell black licorice!! Pours black as a Siberian Night...and a small tan head that disapates rather quickly. This beer is so complex....and SO high in ABV (9% On my bottle, although I've heard others have claimed 9.7%) it's just a nice, warming sipper! LOTS of aftertaste, but GOOD aftertaste...much of chocolate AND coffee...A TAD bitter, but supposed to be...and not offensively so. Smooth going down, too, and the high ABV is hidden fairly well with all the other flavors going on in there. If I could afford these....I'd ALWAYS have a few on hand!! Would be the ONLY stout I'd want. VERY well done, and I HIGHLY recommend trying one if you haven't. Happy October, my friends, and SAAALUTE!!!!"
"This poured an opaque pitch black with dark tan head. It smelled like rich roasted coffee with milk chocolate and some licorice and alcohol. It tasted like sweet milk chocolate and bitter coffee with some burnt barley malt and slight alcohol flavor. It was thick with no carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very tasty beer with nearly perfect body. It was easier to drink than most imperial stouts, with a nice clean flavor. It could have hid the alcohol a bit better (perhaps with aging), and could have used a bit more unique personality to it. But it was otherwise very well done."
"Quite pleasing and a great example for it's style - don't judge a book by its' cover."
"Picked up a six pack a while back from a store in RI. Grabbed two from the beer cellar for dessert last night, which was a chocolate tart. As you pour it into the glass, you'll notice that it's as black as ink. Huge brown head. Tons of lacing on the glass. Smell was great, tons of coffee and roasted barley. Loved the taste of this beer. Chocolate is definitely the dominant flavor here. Paired perfectly with dessert. Very thick body it to also, almost like mousse. Barely noticeable abv. I have never seen this on the shelves of stores in MA, but I would without hesitation buy more. This easily grabs a spot in the top three RIS that I've ever had."
"Drinkable beverage, I can do one or two of these in a sitting. Maybe three."
"Drinkability obviously took a hit due to the large dose of alcohol evident in both the nose and on the tongue..."
"Thanks to adamharbaugh for the bottles, I'll probably want more very soon."
"Overall, a decent RIS, but not one that I would choose over some others."
"I bought this as a single 12oz bottle from Parti-Pak Discount Liquor in Indianapolis (Greenwood), Indiana."
"thanks to gpcollen for the chance to try this beer. 363 reviews as of this posting so I'll take slightly different approach for this one. a solid quite enjoyable RIS. If this was local for me I'd have a stock in the basement. drinks lighter than the abv would indicate. well worth a try."
"Overall this is a very nice imperial stout, especially for something that is fairly available for those in the area. Would love to have something like this readily available in a 12oz around here. Would most defenitely be a regular if this was readily available here. A very good stout. Git some!!!!"
"Pours a solid black with a decent tan head that seems to stick around for a while. Smells of roasted malts, a bit vinous, maybe some dried dark fruits in the background. Tastes of roasted malts and coffee with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Full bodied, creamy/oily in the mouth. medium carbonation. Great brew, I think it's better fresh, but great either way."
"*THE PERFECT BEER FOR THE 200th REVIEW"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a nice black with a creamy tan head. The aroma is a bit of roasted malts, chocolate, and a hint of coffee. Flavor is nice, coffee, roasted malts, and a bit of fruit. Mouthfeel is nice, warm, full body, and creamy. Very good beer."
"D- so-so here. alcohol taste is a little too pronounced, i feel like i should be doing shots of it."
"This beer is quite tasty, although the tons of lactose cut down on it just a bit. It should be called an imperial milk stout. Other than that, a delicious and recommended brew."
"dark and robust and suprisingley smooth, delitefull hints of coffiee and toffie with a creamy smooth finish, the aftertaste is one of a strong alcohal presents. this is a top shelf imperial stout in every sense if the word. this is a beer that i will seek out agan in the future"
"Night Tripper, Czar, and Stone RIS tied for First. Siberian Night and Old Rasputin tied for 4th, and Ten FIDY and Expedition tied for 6th. Based on these results I've changed my numbers."
"My favorite stout I've had since I've really started to like the flavor. an added bonus that it's an ohio beer."
"I first had this on tap at their brewpub many years ago and really enjoyed it. Luckily it's readily available at most local stores. This is one of the finest crafted imperial stouts that I have had the pleasure of drinking, and it continues to be one of my favorites. Pours a pitch black color with a large collapsing head and spider web-like lacing. The aroma is rich with strong coffee, burnt molasses, and chocolate. The taste is complimented by the aroma and is fairly complex. Nutty with a ton of dark, bitter chocolate and roasted grains. Caramel and molasses bring about a balancing sweetness. There is also a nice milky quality that creeps through. Deep layers with hints of dark cherries and some port wine. Finishes strong and smooth which I like in a stout. The aftertaste sticks with you for a while on this one. Fresh or aged this beer always drinks with great ease. The high alcohol presence makes itself known but is not offensive. Always been a top notch brew, it's fantastic in all regards. //Edited review on 12-14-07 after enjoying a nicely aged bottle."
"Thanks DaPeculiarDane for the trade!"
" That's a scary looking wolf on the lable and the complexity is too."
"D - Great beer, I love stouts!"
"Thanks to yem25 for trading me this beer to try."
"D: A nice treat, but also not as overwhelming as some other fine Stouts. A very palatable beer that I would love to enjoy again."
"D: The underlying booziness of this keeps reminding me that I need to slow it down! Excellent flavors and aromas coupled with a slick and sticky mouthfeel make for a fantastic RIS!"
"D: Well, it is a great tasting beer, one to enjoy over time. A high ABV reduces its drinkability, but a great beer to have if you are looking for 1-2 beers for desert."
"A fine beer! Difficult for me to have more than a couple, but I tend to savor each bottle."
"D: Not too bad at all. It is a bit bolder and more smokey than many RIS' but it does not suffer because of this."
"Pours a midnight black with a fluffy two finger cocoa colored head which slowly dies down to a foamy layer of bubbles. Chunnky layers of webbing on left on the sides of the glass, nice lookin' brew. Rich and smokey malts up front on the nose with dark chocolate and coffee grinds as well. A good amount of dark fruits with a touch of alcohol as well. Definitely a monster in the smell department, I likey. Taste begins with charred barley and rich caramel malt with a touch of sweet vanilla. Raisins and dates midway with french roast coffee as well. A touch of gritty hops in the aftertaste with more smoked malts to balance it out. Very solid tasting brew. Thick and creamy in the mouth with a heavy feel. Carbonation is subtle but fits in well with the style. This is a big beer for sure, and one that seems to get overlooked. This is my first Thirsty Dog brew, I'm looking forward to trying more of their offerings."
"Some good aspects to this beer but some off flavors took away from the overall beer."
"D: A big one, with some notable aftertastes make it a slower sipper. That leaves plenty of time to take in the flavours and lick it off the lips. Nicely done. I'll be going back for more."
"Poured this fine stout into a chalice. Pours a black color with minimal head that leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Now the smell, oh my full nose here, roaste malt with hints of chocolate, figs and prunes impressive smell here. Taste is a mild with a strong alcohol taste to it also roasted malt in there with a strong hop presence. Overall this beer is pretty good and would highly recommend this just keep In mind not one of the tastiest stouts out there."
"Very well balanced imperial stout. If you're looking to have more than a couple RIS in a sitting, this is the one. Seek it out."
"Pours black with a creamy brown head that retains pretty well. Aromas of dark fruits, espresso, prunes, and a little earthy, roasted malts. A nice prune, raison, dark fruit sweetness to start and quickly to a big dark roasted coffee flavor. Middle to end is drier with notes of roasted espresso, toasted barley, charred malts, and cocoa powder that goes long in the finish. Semi-smooth and a nice thinness to the mouth, avoids being too viscous. Maybe a little hot in the middle but easily forgotten with such a terrific flavor and all around drinkability for a 9 abv."
"This beer pours a used motor oil black color. The head is half an inch in height, tan in color, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is very bold for a RIS. It is full of chocolate, vanilla, graham cracker, and roasted malt. The taste is packed with malt. Chocolate is upfront, followed by graham cracker, vanilla, and finishing with some nice roasted malt bitterness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good RIS. I really like how it isn't overly hoppy the was a lot of American made RIS's tend to be these days. I will certainly search this one out again."
"Drinkability- This would be a good example of a session RIS if there was such a thing. Nothing really stands out about this brew, but it's just all around good and well balanced. Was expecting greatness and got goodness. Nothing wrong with that."
"D: This is a very good impy stout that remains very drinkable despite the heavy roasted presence. A sipper, but drinkable."
"M/D - Creamy and smooth. Full bodied beer with light carbonation. Very drinkable by RIS standards but that ABV can get you."
"D- damn fine brew."
"This RIS is smooth and creamy but noticeably thick in the mouth. Amazingly viscous, and equally amazing in its rather quick finish. I will say, for an RIS I could drink a couple of these no problem. If you have some don't wait until next winter, pull one out now and enjoy!"
"Overall, this beer is a smooth drinkable stout. Not as complex as most imperial stout but worth the buy"
"A motor oil consistency flows forth into a dark brown head that settles slowly. Wafts of roasted malts, sweet espresso, and 85% cacao chocolate smack the nostrils around while clean alcohol lingers beneath. The hop bitterness gives good balance to all the dark malt. This imperial stout is a great example of the style. It might even be a little too clean for me. I like some of the dark fruit characters that often lurk in the dark forest that is RIS. But this one is well attenuated, smooth on the palate and is quite drinkable for all of its flavor. This beer is ready to go now, no need to age. Aging beer is fun but having a RIS ready to go from the brewery is excellent too."
"Drinks great for the abv & style, but I'm sure 2 X 12ozs of this is conducive to an early night! Just a little more malt depth & I'd say this puppy is best of show!"
"Overall, I liked it more with every sip. Not as intense as other Russian Imperials, and better for it."
"Edit: Actually, after looking a couple reviews down, I see notes of metallic qualities. This is actually mostly what I am tasting here I realize, not oxidation. This is extremely disappointing, and seems to be an obvious flaw in the beer itself (at least this batch). As such, I have to lower the flavor a notch since this was not an aging issue but a brewing issue. I don't remember this from my GABF sample, so I will have to seek out a new batch to see if this is just an unfortunate, one-off bad batch, or if this is normal."
"This a definitley one of my underated beers out there and is a great value for the money (a six-pack can be found in the $11-12 range). Maybe not quite up there with the some other top tier RIS and the alcohol presence hinders the drinkibility some but make no mistake that this doggie still has some bite and is one of my fav commercially available Stouts."
"D - Too big for long hauls."
"Overall a good stout but I don't know if its a top 10 brew or not. A little hot.."
"Flavor makes this pretty drinkable, but body and alcohol inhibit a high rating for consumption."
"A very drinkable, smooth RIS. Thirsty Dog is onto something here. I'm glad I have more to share."
"A solid RIS but not the best in the category or even for stouts, but a very solid beer nevertheless."
"d: This is a fantastic RIS, I'm not sure why it took me so long to try one of these."
"Big brown lasting head on a pitch black oily pour in a snifter. Smell is deliciously smooth, cream, chocolately roast, and an almost chocolate peanut butter cup creaminess about it. Hint of alcohol and smoke as it warms a bit. Taste is dense, creamy chocolate, with a perfect roastiness and no burnt smells or tastes. Perfect mouthfeel and light carbonation. Easily one of my new favorite beers. Awesome, and unbeatable for the price."
"Still very worthwhile, goes down nicely with chocolate."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Thick and heavy on the palate, low levels of carbonation are appropriate to the style. This beer is also smooth as it goes down, like chocolate melting in the mouth(and not in the hand...ha). I really enjoy the fullness of this brew, the smoothness, the creaminess, to me it seems everything about the mouthfeel is right. This is one I will definitely come back to. Next time I am in the mood for a RIS and don't know where to turn it is definitely here."
"Jet black in color with a deep tan head. Sharp, metallic smell. Deep roasted aroma but the metal smell takes away from it. Heavy, chocolatey flavor. Dry cocoa flavor. I cant seem to overcome the metallic quality. Decent mouthfeel to it. Very enjoyable and drinkable. The somewhat off aroma really detracts from the whole picture for me. Still a decent RIS. I would buy this again."
"D - A little too harsh for my liking... A very solid taste, but tough to drink more than 1 or 2 in a sitting..."
"Notes - Bold but never over the top, this is a highly drinkable imperial stout."
" The drinkability is better than many I think partly because T.D. does a great job hiding the alc. content. That said, I wish I could taste more alcohol when I drink this. I think it would mellow some of the other flavors that dominate."
"And the finish was just what I was hoping for. It had a medium depth with some heat, lots more of the chocolate-coffee bitterness I'd been tasting, and just a hint of citrus zest. A great brew for a cold February night."
"Overall- An excellent Imp. Stout! The 9% alc is well hidden. A very tasty and sessionable stout!"
"Drinkability: The bitter finish slows you down a bit."
"D - Goes down easy. The high abv puts the limit to one per sitting. Still a very enjoyable brew."
"This was a beauty. Mouthfeel was a little thin for me, but the overall taste more than made up for that. Alcohol is absolutely missing in this one. Pretty damn drinkable all things considered. I think I could have this anytime, anywhere. A great beer and I am glad to have it."
"Opaque black with amber tinges where the light meets it. Dark khaki head that was about two fingers thick. Pretty good retention. A bit of lacing, though not much. Smells of dark coffee with notes of alcohol. There was also the sweetness of brown sugar present, with notes of dark fruit. Smell is a little on the weak side for a drink as robust as an imperial stout, though. Taste is a bit fruitier than I expected. Figs and raisins are most evident. The usual flavors also make their appearance. Coffee, chocolate, some caramel. Definitely malt-heavy. I can barely detect any hops here. Nice roasted finish. Medium-bodied, though a bit thin for the style. This is one of the lighter RISs I've had. This is still a pretty massive drink and the alcohol catches up to you after a while. Recommended."
"D- This is a beer to be sipped on and enjoyed. The strong alcohol is very noticeable and obvious, but not at all astringent or unwelcome and balanced out well by the complex flavors of the dark malt and coffee. One of my all time favorites and a very accessable example of the standard by which this style should be judged."
"Wish I would have reviewed the 2007 batch that I din't drink until last October. This beer is just a bit immature in comparison, a 8-10 month cellaring is what it needs in my opinion. This is a very good brew, only wish it was more available thoughout the entire year."
"D-this is one of those special occasion types of beer. However, i feel this beer would be great with a surf and turf dinner. It packs a little punch at then end but i just cant get over the ""extra burtn crispy flavor"""
"Pours very thick and motor-oil black, with a short, dark tan head that fades quickly. Aromas are quite creamy and nutty for an Impy stout, with little in the roasted malt way of things. There are some nice toasted notes lurking in the background. On the palate, sightly fruity sweetness first off, then some hot alcohol starts at the mid-palate and lasts through the finish. Sweet vanilla, chocolate cream and figs round things out. Mouthfeel is very smooth, but not as much as some other examples, with some pronounced alchoholic hotness. Overall, this is a very good Imperial Stout, especially for one on the sweeter side and lacking roasted malt character. Enjoyable."
"D: Very easy to drink for a RIS. 9% isn't too terribly high... or am I trying to kid myself? Excellent brew."
"D: Definitely a great beer. The lowest ABV of the beers we sampled all night. Although it has a good chocolaty and roasty flavor, it's not so intense that I couldn't drink a lot."
"D: Out of all the RIS we tried last night I would say this is the one that is the best traditional RIS. There was no big hop presence (Darkness) or Old Ale Feel (Stone). It was just a great traditional take on the style. It was also super easy drinking and very smooth. Glad I got to try this one."
"Not for me."
"Two word review: highly recommended!"
"Aroma was good, roasted malt and some chocolate. Taste and mouthfeel were great. Incredibly smooth, no hint of the 9% alcohol. Very good balance between bitterness and malty sweetness. Good stout flavors, roasted malt and bitter chocolate. This is a highly drinkable beer. For some reason, I didn't feel the abv from the one bottle. Wouldn't call it sessionable because of the alcohol content, but I would like to keep drinking this one until it caught up with me. A really tasty winter drink."
"12 oz. glass bottle via kramer17801 - color of deep black, with a medium tan colored head - nose of toasted malts, milk chocolate, anis, and oats  taste of bitter sweet chocolate, malt, and some sourness- body is light for an imp stout, and with low carbonation  aftertaste of milk chocolate, malt, and a chewy dry finish"
"Pours a pitch black with a very dark tan head. Nose is a woody molasses, but fairly mild. Nothing real powerful except malts. Flavor is mild roasted qualities. Thick malts. Some molasses. But overall not very character driven Id say. Just is a thickly malted stout that has a consistent profile. Liquid stays consistently thick too and there is a fairly subdued carbonation on the tongue as well. This is a pretty drinkable stout, even though it is so damn thick. There arent any real interesting characteristics going on with it, but it is well made and worth trying, though I doubt I would ever go back to it."
"The 12 oz bottle poured jet black with a thin white lace it looks great in the tulip that it is poured in. Wonderful chocolate and coffee aromas flood your sense through your nose. Creamy full mouth feel .Dark chocolate and espresso like flavor galore. A great Imperial stout in my book"
"A divine beer. I'm pleasantly surprised. Now I have two stops to make in Cleveland (Great Lakes being the other) ... looks like I'll need a designated driver."
"Thick, syrupy, and sizable. Low carbonation contributes to the syrupy nature and lets the warmth shine and provides for a slightly dry finish. Not my all time favorite RIS by any means but a great example of why I love the style. Certainly a must try."
"Well balanced and very drinkable. Great example of the style."
"Have been wanting to try this one for quite some time now, glad to have the opportunity, one of the best RIS beers on the market, I heard this brewery does not exist anymore, so I probably will never be able to drink this again unfortunately, cannot recommend this enough, solid brew from Thirsty Dog"
"Overall, a nice (but not among the very best) examples of this style."
"Drinkability- This is a fantastic RIS. Its a bit different than some others Ive tried but overall this is better. I like the slight smokiness and how its a bit sweeter than others. Its ridiculously balanced and very easy drinking. Huge thanks to franknbeans!"
"drinkability: not much fun in this bottle, maybe a bad run. Not too bad if you hold your nose. Drink it out of the bottle or when you have a head cold."
"This is another to watch. It goes down too easy. Good beer experience."
"Pours an opaque darkness with less than a finger foamy dark brown head that fades fairly quickly. Little lacing generated. The smell is slightly timid but rich. I can't smell the alcohol. Classic roasted coffee and dark chocolate aroma that suggests a syrupy elixir will follow. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is smooth and velvety. Full flavored, the taste reminds me a little of that last mouthful of hot chocalate that is thicker and less sweet but very chocolaty, this time with a spoonful of java thrown in. I really appreciate the opportunity to try it; hats off to DavidEddie for this one!! Quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: The 9% is unnoticable, and the creaminess makes this beer poundable, a dangerous combination. This might be my new favorite ris. Combine the taste profile of stone's ris with the mouthfeel and drinkability of this, and the greatest beer in the world will be born."
"Dark as motor oil. Poured with a one finger head which dissipated to a ring of foam around the top. Lacing all the way down the glass. Smells like roasted carmel coffee chocolate. The taste is rich and roasty sweet malt. Feels big in the mouth. Fine carbonation all the way through. Very smooth and drinkable, alcohol was inconspicous. The bartender said that the draft was 11% abv as opposed to 9% for the bottle. The draft did taste a bit more alcoholic and I liked it slightly better than the bottled version, though not so much that I would give the two different ratings."
"pours like used motor oil with a thick tan head. The smell is loaded with roasted malts and a big wiff of black coffee. The taste starts with roasted malts rolling into coffee and some chocolate, slightly balanced with a nice hop bite towards the end. A solid mouthfeel, and very drinkable for 9%. This is the third beer i have had from thirsty dog, and i have been very impressed with all of them"
"poured from 12 oz bottle into a chalice. dark black with thick tan head. Very strong dark roasted malt smeel. Taste of coffee, brown sugar, smoky dark roasted malt - very complex. creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation. Very drinkable for an imperial stout. good example of the style."
"Pour was near black with a thin tan head and a little much carbonation. Smell is great. Big roasted malts and an underlying sweetness in the mix. Coffee, dark chocolate, and some caramel to sweeten things out. Taste is also very nice and dark. Roasted malts, mostly a coffee flavor. It is balanced by caramel but remains super dark in flavor. A light licorice flavor is also present here. Mouthfeel is about medium and the carbonation keeps it from being any bigger and thicker. I like this one a lot. A quality offering that isn't too complex but still offers everything you'd want in a RIS."
"Midnight black with a dark tan head that leaves bits of lacing and stands strong around the edge of the glass. Sweet smells of molasses, currant, vanilla, bitter chocolate and plenty of roastiness. Roasty, sweet molasses and malt, vanilla, licorice, this beer just has it all. Higher in carbonation than medium; thick, full body. Excellent beer, I really wish I would have bought more, as I could drink this by the case."
"12 oz bottle. Pours an opaque dark brown/black, deep tan 1 cm head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma of sweet malt, espresso, and chocolate. Tastes of chocolate and espresso throughout, hint of pine at the end. Full bodied, very lightly carbonated. Alcohol noted at the end with some sweetness. Very drinkable and overall a great beer."
"I have sampled this beer a few times in the past now on tap at Cole's in Buffalo,came to the table a jet black with a rich mocha colored head atop.Black licorice and burnt notes are big with underlying biter chocolate coffee as well,that licorice is even bigger on the palate I am not a huge fan of black licorice so I didnt care for that but it also has some deeply roasted and chocolate qualities wich are nice full and creamy mouthfeel.A little different flavor wise than alot of the style if you like the licorice than you'll like this alot."
"Bottom line: A fantastic imperial stout at a great price. Great complexity and good drinkability."
"Was able to drink two delicious bottles of this thanks to Imstillthegman."
"Drinkability is good. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Very tasty, complex, and easy to sip."
"Poured with a deep dark color, almost black in appearance. Very little head that dissipated rather quickly; little lacing remained during the tasting. Mild mocha scent, with a hint of nut and malt. Velvety smooth in the mouth with a slight tingle across the tongue and palate. Very drinkable for an imperial; almost too drinkable in that it left me somewhat wanting at the end. Enjoyable, but there are definitely better out there, and missing the signature bite at the end. Would very much like to sample on tap to determine if there may have been an issue with the batch, or if the bottle simply sat on the shelf for a while."
"Overall, I was very impressed with this beer. It got me back into stouts in a big way,after not drinking any for a while, this beer makes me wonder why I haven't been. I miss it already. Thanks to Thirsty Dog for making my beer-life a little better."
"This was a real treat. It felt more like drinking some liquid chocolate candy than a beer. Im so glad I got two more of these, now Im just waiting for a rainy day in San Diego"
"Very impressive stout from Thirsty Dog brewing."
"this is a good chocolatey stout. bitter just as cocoa should be. not a super heavy drinker, but no session beer either."
"Cocoa powder and chocolate milk flavors up front. Moderately roasted malt and light coffee notes follow. Some lacto sweetness, milk chocolate, and dark fruits follow. The chocolate quality overshadows the dark fruits overall. Light peat notes followed by coffee bitterness in the finish. Mildly warming. Medium body is a little light for my taste. Still, a very nice RIS, and a chocolaty one at that!"
"This is an archetypal Imperial Stout. Not the boldest, or most bruising, but a tasty rendition that does what it needs to...and does it very well."
"The body is somewhat full, but more importantly creamy smooth, the slight warmth the only trace of any alcohol. In all, it more subdued than I'd thought it'd be, but in its sublty is refinement, and I can appreciate that in this monster of styles."
"This one pours a dark, opaque black oil like texture. A creamy bubbly tan head forms up at the top of the snifter then dies down to basically leave nothing. Smell on this one is hoppy, and smells like licorice. First taste is all black licorice. After some warming all I can taste is still licorice. Toward the end of the glass I taste hoppy, then dark cocoa, coffee, toffee. Moutfeel has no carbonation but it is sticky, and chewy. Not my favorite stout, but it is a very good offering."
"Looks like I just struck oil as it pours out of the bottle. Completely opaque black with a dark chocolate 2 finger head. This looks like a badass stout. Lots of chocolate in the nose, roasted coffee beans, toffee, love the smell. Tastes of sweet malt, chocolate, expresso, toasty, oatmeal?. More flavors come out as it warms up and as it warms me up. Mouthfeel is full with perfect tickle of carbonation. Bitter hop finish is the icing on the cake. This has instantly become a favorite of mine. Delicious, well done and a must try for any stout lover."
"Pours a deep dark black, held it up to night and got nothing. Two finger thick brown head forms, refuses to leave, even though I asked it nicely. Lots of lacing, looks pretty amazing. Smell is great, dark fruits, roast, chocolate, coffee, toffee, floral, bread, more roast, kickass! Goddamn. Intense chocolate roast, coffee roast, toffee, more roast, bit of floral, bread, sweet in the finish, more roast, maple chocolate caramel finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, alcohol warmth in the finish, 9% ABV is hidden very gracefully. Fantastic, I would kill for a stockpile of this, perfect balance of roast and sweet toffee excellence. Thanks a ton Mark!!"
"D - A pretty decent Imperial stout - I was able to drink this over the course of an hour and would say it is deserving of repeat tastes. The Imperial stout could be a bit fuller in body w/ a bit more complexity, but all in all a good tasting stout"
"Closing comments: This is probably my new favorite beer, very highly recommended to anyone and everyone. Enjoy!"
"(now go get me another...good boy!)"
"D- Very tasty and the only thing that I didn't enjoy was the smell. Overall a very good beer."
"Drinkability- Weighing at a muscular 9% ABV you wouldnt want to have too many of these but despite is muscle its flavors shine through quite well and are well received on the tongue. A few of these brews to sip on some cold night would be delightful."
"There is a bit of warming booze on the finish that heats up my throat on the swallow. A bit of a sipper but quite nice flavor and texture make me wish I had another bottle."
"Had this on-tap at Bodega in Columbus, OH. Poured into a pint glass. Dark, black with ruby edges, tan head with little retention. Smells and tastes of caramel, molasses, raisins, alcohol, and coffee. Heavy mouthfeel, almost like a cake batter. Thick bubbles. Heavy on the alcohol, so sip slowly, but it's a delicious drink nonetheless."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch tan head. Head retention was low, but the lacing is good. It smells like roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, licorice and some grassy hops. Taste is mostly coffee and bittersweet chocolate along with some dark fruit, molasses and licorice. There's also a slight bitter hoppy finish/aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but not as rich and full as I expected. It also leaves a nice slick coating in my mouth. Drinkability is very good, it's easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden. I think this is a pretty good, solid beer. I'd drink it again!"
"D- The write-up is good, but this beer didnt wow me. I guess because I love this style and it takes something really special for me to rant and rave about, and while still very good, it isnt good enough for me to do that."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an imperial pint glass. Come out a nice inky black with a 1/2 inch chocolate milk colored head. Aroma is chocolate cake with a touch of wine. Straight away the taste is bittersweet chocolate and black coffee. There are some good strong hop notes in this one...god I love big hop flavor in stouts. The finish is nice dark roasted malts and and a soft hop bite. Mouthfeel is silky and spot on for the style. It's got such a rich taste too it. At 9% alcohol you get a nice warm chest as an afterthought. I don't think the drinkability is hindered though by the ABV as it's just to rich and damn chocolatey to have just one."
"Got as extra in trade with unclejedi - much thanks! Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating info into my trusty pint glass. Was a dark black color even against a strong light. It had a smallish dark brown head that quickly faded into a thin collar. Since this is a winter beer and this is July, the head was probably impacted somewhat. The aroma was heavy on coffee, roasted malts and a touch of sweet malt in the back. I don't like coffee and stouts are not my favorite and this being a Imp Stout, I was expecting to not enjoy this one but wow was I wrong. This is incredible. It was really mellow from start to finish and didn't have that bitter end that I find in most stouts. The roasted malts really shine dominate the taste over the coffee. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy as well. Overall this was an incredible brew and I can't wait to try it again. Very highly recommend."
"Pours almost black with a rich, thick head. Smell is a hearty waft of roasted malt..very inviting. Taste is strong roasted malt with a definite alcohol presence. Slight metallic note is only distraction. Mouthfeel is creamy, but finishes nice and dry. Drinkability is very good for such a high abv."
"Pours black with a dark tan head that fades somewhat quickly and leaves no lacing. The smell has licorice, roasted grain, and unsweetened chocolate- very dry. The taste is most notable for its creamy smoothness. Licorice and perhaps some chicory are present as is some delicious bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel as well is smooth and creamy and delicious.Not my absolute favorite RIS, but its creaminess, chocolate, and pronounced licorice makes it a delicious treat."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. This imperial stout pours a solid opaque black with a half-inch thick tan head that quickly dissolves. Almost no lace to speak of. Aromas are hops, roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. A slight hint of alcohol in the nose. The flavor is heavy on the roasted malts and chocolate. The roastiness seems to take over and cover up some of the other flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit thin leaving with a slightly lasting bitter finish. This is a decent imperial stout. Not bad, but not one of my favorites. The one dimensional flavor almost could be passed off as a dry stout."
"I received this beer in a trade with a fellow BA but I forgot who :( . Anyway, this beer was your standard RIS in appearance; black with a coffee colored head sitting atop. The smell was roasty and a little chocolate. The taste was also chocolate and roast. the alcohol was expertly hidden and I could not taste it. This beer was pretty darn good but not one I would revisit. Definitely recommended for stout/RIS lovers out there."
"Simply an awesome beer. Everyone should go out and find Thirsty Dog Siberian Night Milkshake-Thick Non-Imperial Porter."
"Pours over the mouth and gives it a nice coating. This is a very good stout and I'm glad I had the chance to try it. Would definitely seek it out again."
"For abv and style this goes down (too?) smoothly. Full, but not overly thick. Tasty. Very good brew here."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass. Completely black with a dark brown/reddish head. Smell is heavily grainy and sweet with noticable alcohol content. Taste is not what I was expecting. Not overly big or stong with coffee or chocolate but still solid. Roasted and burnt flavors blend with caramel sweetness and a little bit of mild chocolate. It finishes with warm alcohol that doesn't overpower the aftertaste. On the lighter side for its style; feels incredibly smooth. The lack of one-dimensional strength in the taste and its smoothness make it a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is something to watch, though. As an Imperial Stout, this one certainly has stiff competition but it's one I'll definitely be having again."
"Excellently smooth with a milky softness. Milk chocolate notes like a soft chocolate bar inside a smore. Dark fruit notes that are coated with a spicyness that stings the taste buds slightly. Molasses and sweet caramel flavors are also noticeable. Smoothness of the mouthfeel is what really comes to life in this brew. A very nice RIS to get your hands on if you can. I wonder how this will fare if you sit it down for a year or so. Possibly smoother? I highly doubt it, but it's worth a shot."
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Dense head isn't going anywhere fast, with leggy filming and average to low sticky lace. Aroma is heavy hearty dark grains. Taste begins with the roasty dark malt, dwells through the middle, and closes with a touch of alcohol and intense warmth. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Always glad to revisit this one."
"I like it because its one of the most drinkable RIS's and its darn tasty. There's a rich aroma of chocolate. The flavor is less coffee-centric, though there is mellow taste at the very end. The rest of the flavor is wrapped around cocoa, cola, and chocolate grains with a strong, but balanced bitterness."
"I started off the day with a delicious cup of coffee and ended the day with an alcohol infused version of that morning java. Just a beautiful sight to pour, very rich and thick, dark thin cream head. Smelss and tastes of the following--coffee, vanilla, chocolate, molasses. Bit of hops, almost like Herseys' special dark. Medium body and mouthfeel. A bit hard to finish a pint, but nonetheless very tasty."
"The good news is that this is THE most drinkable imperial stout in the entire universe, without sacrificing too much in the way of flavor. The fact that it's as sessionable as it is at 9% ABV should be terrifying."
"Overall: I've never been a huge fan of stouts, but this is pretty good stuff here! A nice counterpart to a strong IPA. Apparently, there's an oaked version of this RIS- would also seem to make for an interesting tasting."
"D: Absolutely I would have this again. It's slightly lighter body and smoothness are appealing, as is its fine balance. ABV is low (relatively) at 9.0%, meaning it's possible to have a second...maybe...I'm very glad to have had the chance to try and will look forward to another sometime."
"D - Overall this was very very excellent, and definatly a winner in my book. The alcohol is soo well hidden that this is actually dangerous and could rightfully catch up to you at any moment. In fact if I did not know better I would almost say it was sessionable. Truly a fantastic robust stout, QUALITY!"
"D - Very drinkable for an imperial stout. A ton of flavor and a smooth feel make this a pleasure to drink."
"Siberian night pours a inky black, completely opaque even when held up to a light. Aroma is dry roasted malts, not as much sweetness as I would expect. It really smells like a dry irish stout on steriods. The flavor brings out the sweetness, Rich and roasty, with a huge amount of sweet malts. Tons of caramel flavor. Very little alcohol flavor, overall a nice imperial stout. I love the label."
"WOW this is what i call a BEER! Dang son the bottle is sexy as hell...ill just put that out there. The beer pours very dark, pretty much black, into the glass. The head disapears quickly. The smell is rich with sweet chocolatey malts and some other fun scents like coffee and maybe some fruit-esque sweetness. The taste was very good rich with sweetness and pleanty of bite. Coffee and fruity flavors were present. The mouthfeel starts smooth and ends with a nice bite. The drinkability was definately a 4.5. I Loved it!"
"Worth a wants list add."
"Drinkability - Enjoyed this beer, Must try."
"Taste is wrought with the usual stouty flavors: hearty, thick malts and big roasted notes. Hides the 9% well, even as the beer warms. The body feels a bit too thin for my liking, but it leaves a good bitter coffee-esque bite on the finish. All in all, it's a fairly tasty and decently drinkable stout. Not mindblowingly good, but definately a solid presentation from the good folks at Thirsty Dog. Give it a swig."
"This was one of those beers that stood out to me at the festival. Even if you've got a fatigued palate from drinking many beers in a row, this one will pop out. Very tasty indeed."
"This was one of the most enjoyable & unique Imperial Stouts I've ever tried. A full range of taste experiences that made for a great experience. Can honestly say this is now in my personal Top 10. Well done Thirsty Dog! Highly recommended!"
"Good drinking. Love this one."
"D- The richness of this hurts the drinkability of this a bit. But I really did enjoy this and recommend it. What a sipper."
"D: A very rich and delectable brew. Dangerously drinkable for the higher ABV. Recommened stout with excellent balance."
"I found this beer on tap in my home town this week. Very pleased to see some better beers coming thru RI, especially in Cumberland. This beer poured a very dark black color with a mild caramel to off white colored head. Smelled of roasted malt and some hints of chocolate in the back ground. There were some mild tones of sweetness in the background as well perhaps some caramel malt. Nice strong lacing down the glass. It certainly hides the 9% ABV very well. Very tasty imperial stout and it is extremely smooth and drinkable. I could certainly drink this brew all night, but it would probably not be a good idea. Decent mouth feel seemed a tad watery but had a great flavor to make up for it. Overall I enjoyed this brew until the last drop it paired great with my roast beef and au jus sandwich."
"D- I looked back at my old review for this before I wrote this one. I wrote the other one back when I was first getting into beers and really didn't like stouts. I didn't like it to much back then and thought it was lacking complexity and just was only coffee. Now looking at it I think it has a great deal of complexity to it and there are a ton of other flavors. I always like to be able to look back and see how much my taste and knowledge has changed. This is just another great example of how they have. This is a great beer though. Very tasty and I will search for this one again."
"This is a very impressive stout from Thirsty Dog. Wish it was available in my area. When I see this in the future I am picking some up every time. Excellent!"
"Pours a three-finger brown head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Midnight black color. Roasted chocolate nose. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is roasted/bitter chocolate, high ABV is buried, smooth, bakers chocolate finish. Easy to see why this won a gold at the GABF. $2 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"An excellent stout, and one any stout lover or BEER lover in general should pick up and quite frequently."
"Opaque midnight black. Large creamy toasted-tan head, blistering like hot pancake batter. Mineral-infused cognac-chocolate-cherry cake batter aroma with a real sweet baked-goods aspect. Great roasted quality in the finish, preceeded by chocolate milkshake, cherry preserves, cocoa-flavored treacle, and an anejo rum wash. But it's that black, earthy roasted flavor that really gets me hot. Alcohol is present, but only in the most genteel way. 9% abv? Pshaw. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Luxuriously so, in fact. Medium-thin body yet full and satisfying on the palate. An exceedingly drinkable and overall godly imperial stout. Infinite thanks must be extended to nriech, unclejedi, and Aprilluvsbeer for bottles they sent my way."
"Recieved this beer in a trade, (thanks markgugs). Served at cellar temperature in a pint glass. Poured a deep oily black. Completely black when held up to the light. About a finger and a half of thick, rich , coffee brown head rose from the glass. Head had pretty good retention. Smell: Heavy aromas of fresh milk chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and caramel filled my nose. Now this was pretty good. Taste: Smooth flavors of chocolate, coffee, toffee and caramel were present, along with a heavy helping of roasted chocolate malt. Had a bitter sweet finish to it. Mouthfeel was full, thick, and creamy. Very well balanced and smooth with little carbonation. Smooth from front to back. Nine percent abv was very well hidden. Totally drinkable , and would recommend to any stout lover."
"Great beer!"
"-Oelergud"
"Overall, this is a very nice RIS. It is not as harsh as some others I have tried, yet still leaves no doubt that it is a big beer. Very drinkable for a RIS as well. I could have a couple of these at one sitting."
"I really enjoy Russian Imperial Stouts and this beer lived up to the hype. Enjoyable."
"Drinkability: For some stupid reason, I passed on this beer many times at my local grocery store, but this time I'm glad I finally gave this beer a chance to shine. It is really a good not too strong common affordable Russian Imperial Stout. If you're worthy enough to get pass the wolf guardian on the label, then you're in for a real treat."
"Black with a ring of dark maple at the edges, roasted malts and chocolate on the aroma. A little coffee roast and chocolate taste with enough hops to balance and stick out a tiny bit, powdery dark chocolate with a bitter raost finish. Quite nice, it ought to be the standard for all imperials with other variations only getting better."
"This beer pours a very nice head with a great lacing. Also has a nice black color. The head seems to stick around for a while. The smell is filled ith coffee, it also has a slight chocolate backround. The taste is very smooth and has a lot of coffee/chocolate malts. It's pretty warm in the belly too, a little hot in the mouth as well, but that's not too off-putting. The mouthfeel was nice, but had a small bit of extra cabonation that didn't help the hotness. Overall I would like to give it a few more years in the cellar, then it would be awsome!!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter glass. Appears a very dark brown with an inch of creamy tan foam. Smells of freshly roasted coffee beans, and alcohol. Tastes of dark fruit, caramel , coffee and molasses. There is a nice bitter, hoppy finish. Full bodied and velvety smooth on the tongue. Becomes more complex as it warms. This beer will always have a place in my rotation."
"D: I could drink these all day except i would be a mess. No seriously, for a beer with 9% abv it was extremely easy to drink. Go out and get some soon!"
"I like this stuff its a beefier stout then im compared to but rather tasty.Ide buy this stuff again for sure."
"Drinkability: Again to me like most Imperials get better as it warms to proper temp. What a shocker! Solid Imperial stout!"
"D - You can barely taste the alcohol. I will definitely keep seeking this one out during the cold winter nights."
"12 oz. bottle, contract-brewed by Frederick Brewing Co. It pours into the chalice black with slight ruby tinges and a half-inch of dark brown head that reduces to a collar and leaves little lace. It smells quite nice, with roasted, coffee, and chocolate malts, leather and a green/piney hop background that is mostly masked/mixed with the malts. The flavor consists of all this plus burnt malts, ashtray?, oats? (it is quite smooth), some sweet malts, an almost lactic quality, maybe some dark fruits, and a medium bitterness (58 IBUs) from the hops and roasted malts. The body is full and silky smooth, drying, with medium carbonation and an unfiltered feel, leaving a long roasted/coffee finish. Overall a tasty imperial stout that belies its strength, hiding the alcohol until the very end."
"Pours a thick, very deep near-black color with some ruby highlights and almost no head at first. Once in the glass, the head builds up to about a quarter of an inch before then receding and soon vanishing completely. Nose is roasted barley and malt along with dark chocolate and fresh coffee beans. There is a bit of plumy fruit in the background as well. Taste begins with deeply roasted malts imparting both sweetness and an earthy smokiness. Unsweetened chocolate and espresso follow along with some warming alcohol in the finish. The chewy texture of the beer seems to linger on you tongue until the next sip. A thoroughly enjoyable imperial stouthighly recommended."
"Not too bad. Not my favorite for the style, but this beer is clearly well done."
"One of my favorites. I will get it whenever I can."
"This is an outstanding winter beer, for sure. Pours a nice tan, craggy head and laces all over the glass. Also, is a dark, black as night, no PUN intended! Tastes terrific, with cocoa, coffee, and possibly plums in the mix. High in malt, but has a slight twinge of hops on the back. Not really a session brew, being it's an imperial stout, but an outstanding beer I will keep around and rebuy for a long time."
"Wow, an incrediblely high drinkability due to its smooth full roasted taste. At 9% the alcohol is barely detectable, though its warming is felt in the tummy."
"Mouthfeel is nearly perfect, and this may be the most drinkable stout I've had this year. Oh yeah it's still January."
"D - Two years ago I had this beer and loved it. I then made the mistake of playing a drinking game with my friend whose liver has the combined strength of those of ten lesser men. I think I woke up on the floor in a pool of my own vomit (one of my few abusing alcohol incidents). I haven't had this since, but it is still delicious and I came back for it after an experience like that. That is my testament to it's drinkability."
"This beer is very dark, allowing maybe just a hint of light through. A fair tan head that quickly dissipated to leave some lacing. The smell is hard to detect, but there is hints of coffee and oatmeal. The taste is much of the same, coffee and oatmeal with a bitter finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and the abv is barely detectable. The drinkability is good but I suspect this one could slip up on you."
"Overall: This beer is good, and I am happy to have had the chance to try it. Thank you Himerman for this great hook up."
"Pours a thick black color, nice carbonation, nice brown fizzy head, not much lacing afterwards. The nose is of dark chocolate/toffee, vanilla, roasted malts, slight hops. The taste is delicious, roasted malts, slight sweet vanilla, and tons of chocolate/toffee. Medium body, well balanced brew. Very drinkable, glad to get a chance to try this bad boy out."
"If Hershey made rubbing alcohol this is what it would taste like. A certain alcohol bite is to be expected from an imperial stout but I found this to be a little too much."
"This beer far exceeded my already high expectations. I really, really like this beer and would recomend it as one of the very best russian imperial stouts out there."
"D- This beer has a lot of complexity that is very hard to describe because it is so blended and smooth but still has big dark malt flavors and a good hop punch to go with it."
"VERY enjoyable."
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. I've had the bottle tempting me for a month since I picked it up in Richmond. I just wish I'd have picked up several more bottles. Wonderful RIS that highly recommended to anyone who can find it or trade for it."
"Poured dark borwn with garnet hues along the edges, topped with a whipped fizzy brown head. Soft and sweet aroma. Imagine sitting at a campfire. You are roasting a marshmallow when it catches on fire. Yum. So you slap that mallow between two grahm crackers along with a Hershey bar. I get all of that in the aroma. Even the campfire. The flavor starts decidedly chocolate, then transitions to roast, and on to very nice hop bitterness. The drink is rich, with plesant carbonation. I failed to mention the alcohol. Thats because I didnt notice it at all. This would do great as an every day beer."
"Bottom line: A *superb* sample of the style that is sure to please the diehard fans of Russian Imperial Stouts. Don't miss this one if you see it around your nedck of the woods and if you don't see it, trade for it or buy it online. What a sipper!!"
"Pours black with dark ruby highlights around sides of glass. Creamy mocha colored head that faded quickly. Smells of bittersweet chocolate and sweet caramel malts. Tastes of espresso and dark chocolate up front fading to bitter roasted malts. Not so lingering aftertaste, but a heavy and creamy mouthfeel. Very enjoyable for an imperial stout. One of my favorites and am lucky to have access to it."
"The smell is a great mix of roasted malt, coffee, and just a bit of chocolate. The taste starts with roasted malt and adds substantial chocolate. Hops come through in the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty sharp. Drinkability is very good considering the contents."
"What a great flavor profile on this one. It's also surprisingly easy to get through for as strong a beer as it is. I'd come back to this if I could get it locally."
"Wonderfully drinkable... especially for a beer of this abv."
"Drinkability: A nice beer to enjoy over an hour or so, not something you could have to many of."
"Very impressive looking ale thick jet black, no light penetrates, lovelly thick tan with purple hints head, great lace. Strong aromas of dark French coffee, dark > 70% chocolate, some fruity hints of figs and dates, liquorice and aniseed. Nice roasty malt driven flavour bitter coffee, dark chocolate, sweet cherries in the end,after taste of bitter roast malts and a tang of hops. Peppery on the tongue. Very nice smooth ,silky palate, shows a little alcohol warmth but very well. Good. Very very good stout. Wish this was more available in Oregon."
"Ovr: It's a solid stout, but notas full as I like mine. Still better than most."
"D: Tasty, but kind of filling, a good sipper. A decent representation of style and an overall good beer, but I didnt find it to be anything extraordinary."
" also, maybe the name came from this.. this beer makes me thirsty. I am going to have to have some water after this."
"Picked up a six pack and I really glad I did. Poured jet black w/ a 2 inch fully lasting mocha creamy head. Make sure you pour aggressively and seat back and watch the cascade form an unbelievable head. The aroma was excellent, full blast of roasted malt, molasses, mixed well w/ an expresso scent and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is on point with its aroma. Drank at 55-65 degrees and allow the flavors to come through. The expresso coffee and molasses shines right through with the addition of the roasted malt. Full body, smooth, creamy, softly carbonated and with a hint of alcohol that makes this brew very enjoyable. Careful now, this beer packs a punch at 9% ABV, will make you silly. Enjoy"
"Drinkability: Flawless."
"No wonder this is on the top 100 list."
"Poured a black color with moderate tannish head. Virtually no lacing. Smell is extraordinary, being a complex combination of bitter chocolate, strong coffee, dark fruit, and distinct burnt note. Taste matches the smell and adds a slight dryness and some toffee notes. Nice, full and creamy in the mouth. A superbly done russian imperial stout that almost completely hides its alcohol content."
"D - After a long deliberation, I couldn't put this as a top-drinkable RIS. The powerful aroma and taste lead to a bit heavier finish...I couldn't really enjoy this with a meal or dessert - I'd need an empty stomach. Still a great selection, but it's not my first choice."
"i had a friend tell me that i had to try this beer. i owe her. from the opening of the bottle to the last drink, this beer impresses. the heavy, solid color defies the smoothness of what lies within. Goes exceptionally well with either a strong cheese or a grilled burger, or a friend for that matter.find this beer. Buy this beer. Enjoy this beer."
"D: Very nice and well crafted beer. Could use a thicker body and some more carbonation to really push it over the edge. Regardless, very nice."
"Drinkability: With a heavenly taste that's wonderfully smooth, this beer is a noteworthy example of the noble RIS style."
"The definite highlight of my foray into Thirsty Dog. This was a black, black beer with a medium head. A sweet, roasted malt aroma. Very nice chocolate/coffee taste, so smooth you almost forget you're drinking beer. No noticeable alcohol. I thought this was a fine example of an Imperial Stout."
"In terms of an enjoyable stout to drink, this ranks up there with the best. the only reason it isnt the best is that it wasnt as complex or groundbreaking as some other things i have had. still, very great!"
"Notes: A very well crafted Imperial Stout. Not over the top and truly wonderful. So smooth and so flavorful. Very easy to drink. One of my favorite stouts."
"Essentially black brew topped by a rather long lasting brown head. Aroma has hints of dark fruit and burnt molasses, but nothing really jumps out. Flavor is also rather mellow, with alcohol sweetness followed bark dark chocolate then a bit of barnyard-laced bitterness. Mouthfeel is solid by slightly over carbonated. Drinkability is average at best. Not one of my best beers in recent months."
"Wow. This is quite an impressive stout, indeed. Poured jet black with a pretty big, creamy light brown head. HUGE smell of sweet roasted malts, ground coffee beans, semi-sweet baker's chocolate, toffee, caramel, almost no hops. So far, this looks and smells absolutely heavenly. I am really hard pressed to give anything a 5.0 for taste, but I must admit, I thought really hard abut it on this one. Taste is more of the smell, with a dry roasted malty finish. I could find no hop character in this what so ever. Perhaps I simply didn't know what to look for, as most of the stouts and RIS's I have had are of the ""West Coast"" style and are bursting with the grapefruit / pine sap style hops. I really don't care for that, but this is truly divine. Mouthfeel is heavy and oil like. It actually has a noticeable oil-like weight to it. Fantastic!! This is unbelievable. Many, many thanks to Beerbeing for tossing this in on a trade. I'll be seeking this out in the future."
"Pours inky black and viscous. Supports a fluffy, 1"" dark tan head which holds up nicely throughout the glass. Demonstrates some spotty lacing. Intense, rich aromas of burnt dark chocolate, roasted malts, french roast cracked coffee beans, raisin with some faint molasses and port wine. Big, chewy, round mouthfeel with just the right level of CO2. Initial flavor is quite sweet; chocolate covered dark caramels come to mind. Flavors of dark roasted coffee and malts, along with figs, raisins and faint molasses. Finishes with a mild burnt malt bitterness and some alcohol. Great balance here between the sweet and slightly bitter flavors this IS offers. Definitely one to search out."
"This is a good Russian Imperial Stout, but there are so many good ones out there. I have a hard time differentiating some of them. This is similar to Rogue in my opinion."
"A different Impy. It pours a dark brown. I really poured it openly into my Duvel glass. A good tan head formed, and the smell was pleasant. Drinks very smoothly for a Imperial Stout. Dangerously smooth as the ABV is respectable. The taste flows together. The coffee is well done. I know there was problems with the distribution but am very happy to have this available again. This stout and the Arcadia London Porter are my ""everyday"" drinks. If you're not into the over the top, thick, Imperial Stouts, then this is for you. It's very drinkable."
"D: I had this after having had a Great Divide Yeti and these RIS beers are a contract in styles, one hoppy the other malty. Very interesting a strong representative of the style."
"This beer pours dang-near opaque black (and it makes me think of a night in cold siberia). It also had a light milk chocolate head, which stuck around like an obnoxious in-law (in a good way). Upon smelling this beer my imagination took me to a forest of chocolatey sweetness, with the scent of lingering malt musk hanging on the air. The taste cannot be overexalted. I felt as though I was drinking a coffee-addict's icy heaven with rich roasted chocolate malt flavors pervading every sip. I would love to try this beer with any kind of rich dessert. Will definitely buy again."
"drinkability is good, and higher than i'd have guessed. the alcohol is hidden fairly well and the slightly thinner-than-expected mouthfeel add up to a more drinkable stout."
"The body is nice and full. Coats the mouth well. The flavors play well with each other across the palate. If it were winter, the drinkability would probably be rated higher. Still very good despite being in the heat of summer."
"Drinkability: For a monsterous stout, this goes down way too easy. I could session this."
"D - I am an imperial stout fanatic, but this one missed the mark for me; its actually a little overdone in my opinion. In all fairness, I do question the integrity of the sample because of where I purchased it, and as I confessed above, I truly believes it deserves a second try - however, I would think that questionable age would only benefit a brew such as this."
"Absolutely recommended, but beware - very rich - so not a session beer."
"Now this is something special! Pours black oil with a dark tan head. Is it possible for a beer to smell thick? Flavor full of malt, yet is still dry enough with a touch of alcohol. Roasty-toasty, full-bodied and full of life. Maybe I'm being over-dramatic, but this is one darn good beer. Had one of these out of a bottle at Capital Ale House in Richmond, but glad I'm at home now to write about my second tasting. This is a beer worth anyone's time."
"Drinkability is among the best for this style I've ever encountered."
"Drinkability is very high. At 9 % ABV this beer is very well balanced and easy to drink."
"Just a thick, rich and robust brew. And at 9%abv, youd better be sippin  to prolong the enjoyment and to stay conscious."
"Thanks to warriorsoul for this top 100 offering. As it pours the color appears black as night with a slight viscosity. The foam crust is burnt orange and depletes quickly into a ring. Aroma is moderate in intensity with a robust coffee and chocolate smell, plus a hint of smoke. The flavor seems dry and smoky with notes of coffee. Hardly any sweetness at all. Finish leaves a moderate bitterness and touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, thick, but only lightly chewy. Carbonation is right on for the style. I wasn't too impressed by this bottle and found it difficult to finish. It wasn't overly alcoholic, but the flavor didn't seem to have the right balance I had expected from the aroma. It needs a little more sweetness to balance out the roasty bitter taste. Worth a try if you like Imperial Stouts."
"Drinkability - Surprisingly easy to drink, I wish I would have had a few more to enjoy."
"Pours pitch black somewhat flat with little to no head. Smells strongest with chocolate and some coffee notes. Definite hazelnut as well. Taste is very sweet in comparison to most stouts I have tasted. The chocolate shines through with the coffee setting off the flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth with a slight bitter tinge. Definately very drinkable for a stout...not too heavy and not too light."
"Cheers."
"A good solid RIS but not an outstanding one. Only thing this beer needs is that extra little bit more that Stone RIS and the other top beers of the style have. This is absolutely a beer worth trying and is probably as good a reference beer for the style as exists."
"strong, tight carbonation and a lighter than expected mouthfeel. starts with some slight malty sweetness but overwhelmed by an intensely bitter coffee finish that lasts forever. not what i'd call extremely drinkable or very complex, but a well-crafted beer."
"Drinkability was very nice. Looking forward to the next one."
"Thanks, AKSmokedPorter, for the trade."
"A very elegant example of a usually brash, hard-core style. Classy and refined."
"Thanks to beerinator for this one."
"Pours dark black with a light brown head. Roasty sweet smells. The taste is nice and roasty also with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy and soft and smooth. Well balanced for the alcohol, although while I am drinking this at room temp I can definitely feel its warmth. May not be as complex as others I've had but a solid example of the style."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Daalamar): Poured a pitch-black color stout with a small dark brown color head with better then average retention. Aroma of roasted malt with a nice dose of coffee. Taste is lighter then expected with some nice chocolate and coffee mix with some semi-sweet roasted malt. Hops are not prevalent in this beer, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I would have enjoyed some more bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden and body is about average. Good imperial stout but I just dont see what supposedly make it so great."
"The beer pours very dark, with a dark head and a toasty dark smell. Did I mention it's dark? This is clearly the king of stouts, but the overabundance of alcohol was almost a little too noticeable. But that is what these are all about and aside from my nitpicking, this is a great beer. If not just for its uniqueness, but also for its toasty, complex flavor."
"Huge body, a bit chalky. The alcohol is masked nicely by a cacophany of other flavors. Very nice."
" This is outstanding stuff. This is a quality craft beer and definitely should be sought out by stout fans."
"The same goes for mouthfeel. This is not a heavy brew (unless I am just used to bigger beers now), a bit creamy also. Definitely not a session beer, but I could handle drinking more than just one."
"Quite a nice beer. I've yet to be disappointed by Thirsty Dog..."
"Drinkability: An easy drinker, but needs to go more all-out, to be true to the style, still can't complain about a beer that is well above average."
"The body is full and good feel from the after taste. There is a noticeable phenolic taste from the higher ABV. Overall this was a good Imperial Stout and would recommend to anyone."
"This sucker is thick/complex & hoppy. Very style appropriate. I wanna give this a higher score for drinkability, but I doubt I can finish off a sixer."
"Drinkability: Where is the 9%? This is pretty astounding. A fantastic beer by all accounts. It has all the things I want in a Russian Imperial Stout, and I'd go as far as saying this can go neck and neck with its rivals. Thank God I have five more left, and probably more if I can still get it soon."
"12 ounce bottle purchased as part of a sixer at OUAV in Richmond."
"12.25.06: Cellared bottle on Christmas Eve. Really nice flavors and aromas coming through...big soy sauce and roasts. Maybe it cellared well, maybe it was always this good, but the age didn't hurt. Bumping both flavor and aroma up to 4.5 from 4.0."
"Drinkability: This beer when cold had low marks in everything. After letting the beer warm to around room temperature. I give this beer high marks. This beer is not a master piece but it is tasty in its own right and a very good imperial stout."
"Pours like motor oil mixed with blood. almost no head and what's there is gone quickly. can almost see the alcohol in the lacing. Odor is chocolately, coffee, vanilla, actually smells pretty close to some of the malt extracts used in brewing right after you open the can. nice. Taste is full of roasted maltiness. bitter, chocolately, some hops apparant that should age out. roastedness detracts from the taste somewhat...too burnt tasting. a bit sweet too which should also go away with age. smooth drinking, almost no carbonation. incredibly easy to drink. warms the belly and births a grin. aplty named as it would go down very nicely on a cold siberian night. i don't think the fact that more than two would floor me should be held against it. great. can't wait to have a nicely aged one."
"By the time I got to the end of my glass I really started to wonder why the praise for this Imperial Stout. What any I missing? It lacks a fragrant nose. It lacks malt richness on the palate. It lacks body. It is way too easy to drink for an Imperial Stout. I wanted it to put up a fight at some point, it never did. I can sum up the beer as such its okay but noting more than okay. I happy I got to try it. Thanks RedHaze!"
"drinkability: drinkability is rather high for this"
"MMM smells of raisins with other dark fruit, light coffee, thin dark brown head, opaque color. Mouth feel is thick and creamy with low carbonation. Tastes of resins and other dark fruit, not much coffee. This beer is good but not the 4. whatever its getting."
"got this in a trade but I cannot find my trading papers so I do not know who to give the credit to but a big thanks to the one that sent it. poured black with a brown head. aroma wow the chocolate and malts really come out followed by coffee, caramel, alcohol and some fruityness. flavor no disappointments here, sweet, and roasty, alcohol, coffee, bitter sweet chocolate. liked this one"
"What a big beer. It pours a nice dark, almost black color with a little brown head. The aromas of this beer hit you quickly once out of the bottle. There is a deep chocolate, toasted malt aroma to this beer that is perfect to the nose. The taste is bold and chocolatey, malty and a nice balance of sweetness. This is a drinkable beer but in moderation but that is to be expected from a RIS."
"Very fragrant beer. Aroma starts hitting you as soon as it is uncapped. Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Dark black color. Dark almost purple color head that fades very quickly. More coffee and chocolate. Probably more accurate to say esspresso rather than coffee. This is rich. Nice bittersweet finish of bakers chocolate. Fantastic flavors, BUT there is something mildly watery in the finish that makes this seem less thick than say Speedway Stout. Still a fantastic beer Id happily drink again."
"It poured black and thick with a short, dense, light brown head. Thin, delicate lacing composed of very fine bubbles. Coffee, malt sweetness, and a sharp burnt character dominate the aroma, but there's a bit of milk chocolate molasses as well. Roasted is less prominent in the flavour, making way for a solid bitterness and chocolatey malt sweetness. Some hop flavour as well. Lingering finish with caramel and a bit of alcohol warmth. Full bodied with very low carbonation. The texture is just short of being syrupy, but still coats the palate nicely. The alcohol content is hidden quite well. Overall, a great stout. Definitely try it if you find it."
"drinkability is pretty decent. i don't think i could make this a session brew. one a night would do me fine. it is pretty heavy, so you might want forget about any type of foods for a little bit after drinking this bad boy. but this beer is really tasty."
"Cheers!"
"I believe I owe a big thank you to bigern for this brew from Great Pumpkin '05."
"muchas gracias to BeerBeing for the samples!"
"Drinkability- This is a fantastic stout. Not quite as good as Storm King, it lacks the complexity. Not quite as good as Old Rasputin, it lacks the strength. Just a simple all around drinkable and way enjoyable beer."
"Final Thought: I think of this as a Great Lakes Blackout Stout done extremely better, and GLBC is a personal favorite."
"D: Not quite as good as the Stone RIS or Victory Storm King, but this is still an excellent stout and an excellent price. I will definitely drink this one again."
"Pours out pitch black with an inch high cap of brown foam. Webbings of lace were left around the glass as this was consumed. Aroma is a mix of big roasted malts with a backing of dark rip fruit sweetness. Some mild dark chocolate was there as well. Rich sweet dark fruits are up front on the flavor with a lightly bitter dark chocolate A good amount of roasty malts as well. Finishes a bit dry with a bitter roasty coffee. Silky smooth mouthfeel that could use a touch more body but other was is perfect. Easy enough going down I could go through a few of these. Pretty damn good RIS but not quite at the top of the heap."
"Pours pitch black, with three fingers of dense head the color of brown sugar. Outstanding retention will keep a cap of foam to the last sip and lots of sticky lacing. Strong roasted chocolate and caramel aromas, some dark fruits, and a pinch of american hops. The taste is very sweet upfront with roasted chocolate, dates and plums. The american hops turn over the flavor to bitter in the aftertaste, creating a good balance before fading away leaving a very mildly residual finish. Alcohol is percieved eventually, but never becomes astringent. The low carbonation and syrupy body form a velvet smooth mouthfeel that is as easy to drink as it is satisfying."
"Dark opaque brown with a low light brown head that doesn't rise up much and sits down quickly. Aroma of raisin, bitter espresso and dark chocolate. Rich flavor right upfront, with chalky chocolate, prune and plum, bitter coffee, molasses and brown sugar. There's an oaky smokey finish, and a fruity alchohol lingering tang. Mouthfeel is full and viscous, not overly carbonated, somewhat tannic in the finish. Very drinkable, full of flavor, but I'll move through it slowly. Thanks to Brent for sending me not one, but two of these."
"I would love to find a bar that served this on tap. I would make it my session beer (even though it is obviously not intended for sessions), 9% alcohol be damned. The best imperial stout I have ever had."
"Drinkability: Yes."
"Overall: A very nice stout, but one that doesn't really define itself that strongly. It doesn't hang up there with the very top-tier stuff for me, but it's still good."
"Notes: Good beer. The flavors are a deep. But I expected a bit more body. If you're just looking for a good drink, you can't go wrong."
"Taste; initially a litlle sweet, with chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and theres a bit of plum in there. Theres only a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish, and only a hint of alcohol. It has a thick and chewy mouthfeel, really nice. Although this is an imperial stout, it tastes so good I could drink more than one a night."
"Pours carefully with only a wisp of a brown head, when roused a rich chocolate brown head foams up and then slowly settles back down again. The color is opaquely black, yet showed a clear deep brown color as it was poured into my glass. The aroma is thick and fragrant with notes of burnt coffee, concentrated malt, sweet dark chocolate, and a dry slightly acidic finish of espresso roast. The beer is smooth and creamy on the palate up front, but then as it crosses the palate a hint of liveliness is picked up from the subtle carbonation and it melds with the bitterness in the finish that is a mix of hops and concentrated burnt roast notes. The beer has a concentrated malty sweetness to it that is cut by the darkly roasted coffee notes, notes of dark chocolate and the bitterness in the finish. This beer is quite rich and flavorful, yet not cloying and too rich like some Imperial stouts. Dont get me wrong this is a sipping brew, but I dont get the sensation of getting full while trying to work my way through this beer. There is a nice hop character here as well, it is second fiddle to the concentrated malt notes, but it adds a nice backdrop, and a nice foil to the other flavors that are here. This is definitely a solid example of and Imperial Stout, one I would be happy to try again."
"For an imperial stout, this guy goes down way too easy. You would never know it's 9% by the taste and body. I love this beer."
"Alcohol is well hidden in this 9% monster. A world class beer."
"I'd place this on a select pedestal with Storm King, and Speedway and a few others that would always be welcome in my home. Superb beer"
"i would love more bottles of this.. despite its intense deep flavor, i could surely drink one or two more of these. beyond excellent."
"Pours black with a nice brown head that dissipates leaving some good lacing and froth around the edge- pretty good for this style. There is a lot of chocolate in the nose also some carmel and roasted malt. Tastes wonderful- sweet and chocolate malt is balanced just about perfectly with bitterness from the roasted malt. There's also some great hop flavor in the finish that rounds out this beer beautifully. My only complaint is that the chocolate flavor is maybe a little too dominating. Still this is very delicious. Nice full bodied brew has some good carbonation and feels great in the mouth. I could definitely drink more than one.. wish I had more."
"Holy cats! I think I see this beer absorbing light. That's how dark it is. Some lacing is present, head retention isn't great though. Aroma is upfront chocolate malt, perhaps some milk chocolate as well. Taste has a touch of the sharp burnt flavors of black malt. So smooth and easy to drink for a beer of this gravity. A fine example of the style."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for sending me this interesting Ohio beauty!"
"GABF2004... Poured an opaque black color with a medium sized tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of roast, chocolate, dark fruits, smoke and toffee. Taste was nice roasty and toasty chocolate, anise, and light figs. Full and round mouthfeel. I used my 6 oz pour on this one."
"Heavy in the mouth and thick creamy mouthfeel. Hints of carbonation on the back flat of my tongue and back roof of my mouth. Ken, I can't thank you enough for sharing this divine beer. I hope the beer cache continues to benefit many others the way it has for me tonight."
" I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid."
"Finger licking good."
"Feel is remarkably soft, subtle, silky, and velvety slick. Not all that full or robust really, but damn fine to comprehend as this stuff goes down way too easy. And I mean, way too easy. Wow, I could drink this for days, or at least until the 9% catches up with me. Probably, and most definately, the best part of this drinker of a stout is just that, it's a dozey of a drinker! Oh, and the chocolate is pretty damn nice too."
"Nice ruby black with a decent dark tan head that drops back and leaves a little lace in the glass. It has a decedant smell of layer roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. The body is full and creamy and adds to the taste which is a rich blend of roasted coffee and caramel chocolate. It is very low bitterness and is easy drinking."
"taste was much the same with a great smoky, chocolatey, sweet flavor with a slightly dry finish that was then followed by that sweet syrupy alocohol at the back of my throat. quite warming and very very tasty."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this exceptional brew"
"Thanks again Kev...a real treat."
"After being thoroughly miffed by their Old Leghumper, this baby was up for the task! I picked up a six-pack previously to going camping. After setting up camp and getting firewood, I cracked one of these and found pure enjoyment. This rich brew had an incredibly thick, foamy head that probably would have left a great lacing, but I was drinking out of a 16 oz. opaque cup. The brew was rich in chocolate and coffee tastes with some amazingly rich, roasted notes. The alcohol is not noticeable to the palate but the mouthfeel is quite good. Lots of flavors and a perfect carbonation make this a highly drinkable imperial stout. Cheers to Thirsty Dog for changing my opinioin of them."
"Impression: A well bodied, well balanced, heavy stout. Just what you would expect from an Imp. You've got to like 'em rich, thick, heavy and sweet."
"Mouthfeel is creamy with a nice big body that shows its strength with each sip. Drinkability here is pretty good...only knocked down a bit by the abv. Otherwise, this is a rich, tasty imperial that would be quite enjoyable on a cold night (hell...it's enjoyable on this hot summer night!) This one is worth a look into!"
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a strong, rich brew that is definitly not for the faint of heart. It's full of flavor and complexity, with enough alcohol to keep you warm for quite some time. One of the better Imperial Stouts I've had in some time."
"Overall: As far as Imperial stouts go it's not bad but it's not overly great either. The acohol is, for the most part, well-cloaked - which is nice; and the fruitiness is good, and it's very well-balanced... but there's not quite enough of everything else there to bring it full circle."
"Drinkable: Oh, yes."
"Thanks to my friend and fellow BA HardTarget for generously sharing this great beer."
"Pours as dark as, well, a Siberian night sky. Very black and thick looking, topped by a light brown head. Smells largely of chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. Slight hop presence to the nose as well. Taste is sweeter than I expected. Lots of roasted barley to be sure, big coffee and chocolate notes. However there is a bit of sweet molasses in there as well. Also a bit of an alcohol kick in the taste. A bit of orange peel hops there toward the end blends with the dry coffee finish. Moutfeel is a little oily (in a good way) but not quite as ""chewy"" as some other impy's I've had. Quite a good easy drinking imperial stout."
"Drinkability is huge killed this one in ten minutes or so, God its good, way to good to sip. Sad I only have one this is a great easy drinking Ipmy Stout, this could be dangerous. Don't know where merlin48 found this but wouldn't mind picking up a case to go with my Storm King fetish."
"Saved this little gem for my 300th review; it made a nice selection!"
"Siberian Night is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts that I've ever had, but is still only second in the state of Ohio (Great Lakes Blackout Stout is my slight preference). Having said that, this is spectacular beer and is yet another example of why this style is now a solid second to my beloved IPAs. Highly recommended."
"A decent imperial; one that starts out really strong but cloys at you by the end."
"This has quickly become a staple of my beer cellar and will continue to impress me every time I enjoy it."
"This is one of those beers where, after the first sip, you pause to admire the beer. Loads of fresh ground coffee flavor. A friend commented ""if Starbuck's made beer, this would be it."" Woven though the coffee notes was unsweetened cocoa powder, for a well-integrated mocha character. Full mouthfeel, bordering on creamy. Some spicyness from the alcohol is there, but no fusel notes. This is a really well done Russian Imperial, and takes its place among my favorites."
"This beer pours a deep black color with a nice one finger of tan head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is huge. Lots of chocolate and some sweet raisin with alcohol coming through as well. Wow. The flavor starts a nice sweet raisiney chocolate and moves to a beautiful coffee finish. The feel is huge thick, somewhat syrupy and great. For a beer of this size and style, it is very drinkable. I find myself having to pace out the sips, as I want to drink it very fast."
"Lots of flavors here. The fruity notes really elevate the roasted dark malts to another level here. Excellent drinkability for a big stout."
"Cool bottle label. Pours a darkest of dark color with a tall, dark head that has great retention and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Aroma was very strong with chocolate and expresso. Nice. The flavor was thick and strong with chocolate and coffee. Great flavor! The body is extra thick, as it should be. The drinkability is wonderful for something 9%abv. Wonderful brew."
"The beer after its disinterment from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass an atramentous color with a thick creamy chocolate brown head that is modest in size and after its dissolution the lace forms a glutinous sheet that melds with the glass. Nose is rich in sweet roasted grain aromas, fresh and pleasing to the senses, start is sweet and thick with malt, and the top is full in its feel to the palate. Finish is benignly acidic and the hops pleasantly spicy in their bite, desert bone dry aftertaste that lingers long on the palate, a fine representative to the style."
"This would define the ""Motor Oil"" style if there ever was such a thing. Darkest of browns, with a tan head that fades. Roasty chocolate aroa. Flavor is hugely malty with lots of roasted malts shining through. Thick mouth feel, almost like syrup. Delicious."
"<i>Home-bottled by Hopsrus.</i> Black body catching all the light in the room with an evil feel. Coffee head that, when poured straight, is great for the style. Rich coffee beans aroma, together with deep black chocolate, extremely malty. Sweet chocolate mouth entrance. Nutty as you adventure further, vanilla too. Enough roastiness and bitterness to honor its great name. HAIL SIBERIAN NIGHT. Very thick and quite carbonated for a beer that was home-bottled over 2 weeks ago. Bitter aftertaste, it's only after having swallowed that you realise how potently this beer was hopped. Very rich and well balanced. Thanks John!"
"Lovely, malt accented, true to the style imperial stout with notes of chocolate, roasted, black and caramel malt with other notes of cocoa and currants. Well balanced and nice depth. A great Imperial that represents the style well."
"Wyll-"
"12oz. bottle: The beer pours out of the bottle very inky and thick, almost like oil. The beer is opaque: no light at all seems to get through it. There was only a small dark tan head, which dissapated almost immediately. The aroma is very sweet. Complex, although I can pick out hints of coffee, licorice and some subtle fruits. The initial taste has coffee notes up front. Some chocolate and hops come through on subsequant sips. Some roastiness also. Very Good!"
"This beer simply looks like straight up motor oil on the pour. Very dark, very thick. The head is really impressive in size, color, and consisitency. Nice carbonation for such an alcoholic brew. The smell is not overpowering but not too weak either. This beer had a really sweet nose with notes of chocolate, espresso, and sweet fruits. The taste was roasted espresso, the creamy body on this beer brought me a lighter fruit sweetness mixed with chocolate (like strawberries dipped in chocolate), darker fruits ensued after that. Whole hop leafs lie in the background and provide a raw characteristic that mixes with the sweetness. Alcohol is hidden well but I feel it on the burn down my body. The finish leaves an oily coating in my mouth. Quite thick in body and very, very creamy imo. I really liked this beer."
"Overall: A damn tasty stout! I rank it up there with one of my all time favorites. A must-have for all stout lovers!"
"It was served very bubbly (big bubbles, not like foam) It was dark and stained the edge of the menu. I knew I was in for something good when I smelled the dark concoction which did a full number on my sense of smell. At first, I sipped and washed this beer across my palette and then gulped it to realize what I was tasting. There was nothing I can say bad about this light sweetness. It was the perfect example of everything I like about Stouts with that extra alcoholic zing that makes this an imperial. It was fresh from the tap and tasted like it. Bottles and Canned stouts lose a little ""life"" from storage, but this was absolute perfection. I got another sample of this so I could savor it again. When I go back, this will be the beer I choose, although the waitress said they usually had this in the winter only. Bottled is available at my fave store, so I can enjoy it all year, but when I visit the brewpub, I'll be ready."
"Lovely beer. Good head after a vigorous pour, dissipates quickly. Smells strongly of chocolate malts and alcohol. Blacker than black. Nice and thick the way a stout of this caliber should be. Doesn't bowl you over with anything special, like other premium stouts, but they really got everything just right with this stout. Excellent."
"great imperial stout...up there with storm king and stone in my book."
"Blackhole black, opaque and dense with a large head of creamy brown foam. Aromas are of a souped up oatmeal stout. Is this an imperial oatmeal stout, perhaps? Sweet malts mingle with espresso notes, and dark chocolate to create an aroma that is intriguing and excellent. Since this beer looks and smells so good, the taste is a bit of a small let down. Don't get me wrong, this stuff tastes awesome, but it is not as complex as the aroma lets you believe it will be. The taste is very roasty, and sweet, in an oatmeal stout sort of way. However, the chocolate complexities and the coffee notes that I smelled in the aroma, are very subdued here. The mouthfeel is thick, smooth, and creamy, like an IS should be, and the drinkability is very good as well. This is an awesome IS, but I think it is a bit over-rated. However, I would love to try some of this fresh off of the tap, or even cask. I have a feeling that this one, can be phenomenal!"
"A very fine stout, and my first imperial stout at that. And it is easily, although inexplicably, the best smelling beer I have ever come across, I mean it's messing with my hormones and my brain chemistry, I almost want to give this beer my pin number out of sheer infatuation. Perhaps it's for the best that I have only one bottle of this, and must humbly thank northyorksammy for the pleasure and the opportunity of sampling it."
"Either I was drunk, or just enraptured by the whole thing. Good think I am drinking one now so that I can tell you that it is really easy to drink. Can't wait until I have a nice deck, where I can sit and sip this fine brew and watch the world go by."
"Thanks to CRJM for this gem."
"Drinkability: I will attempt to drink a 6 pack of these tonight and determine it's drinkability. Sarah would give the drinkability a 0.0, but she prefers Strawberry Cosmos."
"Cheers to Northyorksammy for the samples!"
"An exceptional brew! This is a world-class imperial stout...one of the finest I've ever had, and boy, am I picky. I prefer this over Expedition, and it's right next to, if not surpassing, Rasputin. BA's heed my word and find this!"
"smooth great drinkable major league stout. Midnight black and after alchohol kicks in, you'ss spend the night anywhere. Better than almost any drink. Not too coffee but rich malt chocolate taste covering the 9%. hoppy too! Must have another. Great late night drink. Possibly best US made stout."
"I think after a few years of trying every different beer I can get my hands on that I have found the one I want to perpetually keep chilled in my fridge, space concerns be damned! Local bias? Maybe. One of my favorite Imperial Stouts ever? Definitely. This beer is almost black with a lovely brown head. Nice sticky lacing too. Aroma of toasted malt and coffee. The flavor is a lush blend of roasted coffee, alcohol, malt and chocolate. The finish is perfect as far as I am concerned, it is rich and progressively more warming as the alcohol kicks in. I thoroughly enjoy this one, and I am extrememly pleased that it is finally being bottled."
"Appearance: Motor oil like consistency in the pour deep black what else can I say about that large dark tan head holds together quite well, lacing somewhat thin but evenly spread. Aroma: Slew of dark roasted chocolate malts and heavily toasted caramel malts some heavy coffee and dark chocolate blend along with a creamy edge to it all and a grassy hop finish somewhere in the mix of all that malts according to the label 58 IBUs not bad at all. Taste: Complex layers of bitter dark chocolate and coffee roasts wow big flavor slightly creamy edge makes it much better and the hop bitterness comes through in the madness good stuff here right on for a big kick you in your teeth Imperial Stout. Mouthfeel: Chewy big beer, full bodied and smooth carbonation ton o' malts here. Drinkability: Suprisingly quaffable very good solid imperial stout from a micro based out of Akron, applause is deserved for this offering good stuff can't complain has me wanting to enjoy another."
"The aroma is all roasted malt. No hop or alcohol aroma. A pleasant aroma that isnt overwhelming. The taste is very robust, sweet and coffee-like. A burnt, almost smoky character at the end that is very bitter. This has, by far, the thickest mouthfeel of any beer I have had. It sticks to all surfaces of the mouth, leaving its lingering burnt taste. Quiet an experience, but I wouldnt be able to take more than one of these down at a time."
"Definitely one of the sweetest Imperial stouts I've ever had. A rich chocolatey goodness that would go well with a chocolate dessert, and I'd definitely love to get back to Thirsty Dog to have a full pint on draft!!"
"Excellent stuff."
"At the insistence of my crazy husband, we tried this beer with a little half & half. I like cream in my coffee, so why not. It cut the bitterness and I really liked it. Maybe we'll try a beer float next time. CRAZY."
"This is a nice imperial, plus it's got a cool label."
"Drinkability is great. I have to get to this brewery at some point"
"I suppose that the head could have been a bit more creamy and lasted longer.I also suppose that this could have been a little more full in the mouth. Overall, I think this is an exceptional beer. I have not had imperial stouts from everywhere, but for right now, I have to think that it does not get any better than this, if you like an imperial stout with a stong espresso roasted taste. I hope that the bottle version does this beer justice."
"Finally found this in bottles in Columbus so as not to keep bugging Dogbrick for growler tastes of this wonderful stuff. This beer poured as black as the night and formed a nice dark tan foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee, chocolate and raisins. A flavor of malt, coffee and chocolate with a nice warming effect of the alcohol present. The body is creamy and imparts a bittersweet finish."
"Drinkability is not very good for the ABV. Other than that a stand out IP that I would love to drink."
"This is one excellent beer. It is a beautiful dark, thick, oily black with a nice brown head. The smell and taste is of chocolate and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is perfect. There is only a slight bitterness, just enough to balance the sweetness. It is extremely drinkable."
"Huge thank you to Dogbrick for sharing this!"
"This is good stuff. Pitch black body topped by a thin tan head. It's not flat, but just has that imperial tendency to be greedy with how much head it gives you. This is a perfect imperial in my opinion. It's got the slight fruitiness, it's got the chocolate and it's got the hops and roastiness to balance the rest out. Thanks hoprus. This was one of the better imperials I've had in a long time."
"Eclipse black color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, oak and a hint of vanilla. Very smooth tasting Imperial Stout. Big and bold, yet velvety smooth. Malts are very roasted, chocolaty, sweet and fruity. Touch of plums, raisins, cherries and vanilla Hops are slightly bitter and a touch citrusy. Only detracting aspect is that it may be a touch sweet. Hides the 10% alcohol very well. A nice imperial stout, its not a full and bold as Stone's or Alesmith's, but it has real potential. Very drinkable, and very complex. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. Many thanks to Hopsrus for this one."
"Originally sampled 30 March 2003. simply beautiful. thanks to my friend hopsrus for this beauty. Pours like dark chocolate milk. Great dark chocolate nose w/ flavors of chocolate & dark cherries. it's sweet but beautifully balanced. If you have the opportunity, get some"
"Without question this is my favorite Thirsty Dog brew as it is for the waitress who served us. As she said, ""I love coffee and beer, and this is the best of both."" My dinner companion, not a beer drinker, let out a strong ""eeeeeyou!"" so I knew I was in for something quite extraordinary. This is very reminiscent of Bell's Expedition stout, but with a better head. It is very dark brown to black in color, opaque, and crowned with a greencast brown maltish head that laced well throughout the glass. The nose is very strongly roasted in sense, giving off coffee, chocolate, and some fruit aromas. The flavor is, well, complex, like its nose. Lots of creamy full-bodied goodness. A great after dinner beer to use as a dessert or evening topper. Though I did not get an alcohol flavor sense, no doubt its there. Nice job little doggy, here's your bone."
