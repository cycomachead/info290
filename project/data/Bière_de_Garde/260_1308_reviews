"This beer is astounding. Highly recommend. Can be found in eastern France and Luxembourg."
""

"Overall: this is my first Biére de Garde, and I have to say I am quite a fan. Plenty of different flavours combined to make a quite interesting style - refreshing like a German Pilsner and yet with Belgian farmyard qualities also. I'll definitely have another of these at AU12 for a 750mL bottle."

"O:  good bier de Garde.  Hard to classify though.  Almost a saison.  Strange, skunky, crisp flavor.  Funk for aftertaste."

""
"Pours a clear golden color with big fluffy white head. Dense, meringue peaks, leaving chunky interlocked rings of lace down the glass. Looks magnificent. Smell: pear, notes of white grape, honey, peach skin; mildly herbal and grassy. Taste: soft fruit... sugary pear with notes of cooked green apple and unripe peach, lightly grainy, notes of vanilla and spice. Drying, sugary, and peach skin in the finish. Delicious."
""
"Pours a golden clear liquid with ample white creamy head.  Very highly carbonated.  Grassy, malty aroma.  Taste is fantastic -slightly sweet, with a zesty fruit tang and a dry bitter finish.  Light to medium bodied, I'm amazed at how well the 8.5% abv is masked.  I have never had as a carbonated beer (noting it is top fermented) - almost like champagne.  A very good beer."

"Overall: It is refreshing as a brew, esp after drinking so many IPAs lately. I passed my glass around and it was a crowd pleaser. Personally, it was a little sharp in heat and acid with not enough esters to mellow out the flavor of the malt and coriander. Still, as I said, the others in the room gave it higher marks than I."

"Pours out a bright gold with a foamy white head. Nose is bready, crackery, grainy with soft, fruited yeast, and a bit of floral hops. Flavor is overall sweet and richly malty up front. Bready, honeyed malts with floral noble hops. Slight acidity and dryness in the finish make if refreshing in spite of the initial richness. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight with a prickly, strong carbonation which works so well with the flavor profile. Pretty good stuff."
"I needed to go to YouTube for help opening the bottle, I've never encountered a staple holding down a champagne style cork in a bottle of beer. Once I past that hurdle, using a flat head screw driver as a wedge to remove the staple and a little luck removing the cork barefooted, get the joke, I was pleasantly surprised at how much the taste of this fine brew grew on me until the next morning when I awoke to go to work and couldn't remember who won the football game I'd been watching. After a quick Google search I discovered it was the NE Patriots on top and this close to addicting beer on top too. In other words this is one incredible beer!"

"O - interesting, complex, refreshing, well balanced and delicious. very well done."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and tastes like a hybrid between a beer and a hard apple cider. It seems like it would be a perfect accompaniment to a dinner with mild flavored meat such as poultry."

"It isn't overtly complex in any way, but it's a solid farmhouse ale. As a supermarket beer in France you can have for pocket change (€2.50 75cl) it's great for what it is. This was better for being put away for 3 months compared to the first one I tried."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; so please disregard those scores"
"Very nice, refreshing, deceptively complex, and smooth. This one screams summertime to me, but I'd have to watch that ABV, since it's totally unnoticable. Don't find a whole lot of this style, I'm glad I got to try it."
""
"Overall. An interesting beer, just not my style."
"O - Incredibly well-crafted and clean with great attention to detail. Enough flavor to be interesting without being extreme in any area. Maybe it's too airbrushed and perfect, because somehow it doesn't blow me away."
""

"A very, very solid brew. It is exactly what/how it should be. Succeeds where others consistently fail."
""
""
"While this isn't a very typical style to be found around North America, this import is an absolute delight and an excellent ambassador of the style. On its merits alone this is an amazingly clean tasting ale that exhibits the talent and craftsmanship of the people who produced it--none of this happens by chance. Definitely worth seeking out, especially if this is the only Bière de Garde that you ever try, or simply the first."
""
"Pours a very clear light golden, almost lemon color. Slightly off-white, small-bubble head with staying power. Nice lacing during drinking. Odors of grass, lemon, and malt, with alcohol and nuts taking a lesser role. Broad, complex taste with a somewhat bitter and bright/metallic start and a mellow, malty, slightly hoppy finish. Champagne-like bubble mouth feel, but plenty chewy as well. All around a great tasting ale suitable for spring and summer enjoyment. Just lovely."

"Pours an impeccably clear straw yellow with fizzy white head. Aroma is fruity (apply/pear), some light grain and spice. Taste follows with fruit (apple/pear) and light grainy malt, bit of peppery spice. Mouthfeel is fizzy and effervescent. Overall a great example of Belgian golden strong, highlight for me was the appearance really outstanding clarity and head retention."
"O - Very nice. Don't know how much I could have after because of the ABV, but what can you do."
""
""
""
"Overall: A great classic example of what a farmhouse ale should be: Brisk, elegant, complex and rustic."
"An outstanding and well-balanced beer, like a cross between a tripel and a super saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: a very good brew. I'm not thoroughly experienced with Bières de Garde, but I find this to be enjoyable on the level of a nice tripel. I will definitely have to have this again."
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable, reminiscent of champagne and a similar mouthfeel to La Fin du Monde."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall just a great beer to enjoy, a drink that deserves a lot of attention. Deserves it's place like a solid white wine next to it."
"A decent beer, but rather simple and safe."

"O: Overall not my cup of tea, its a decent beer to style, but I don't think the style is for me"

"Nicely crafted."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Very interesting method of securing the cork with a staple looking piece. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some good spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of grape, apple, hay, grass, pepper, honey, earth, pear, lemon zest, bread, and light fruity funkiness. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength and complexity; very pleasant. Taste of apple, grape, honey, herbal, hay, grass, pear, lemon, pepper, earth, clove, bread, and cracker. Light earthy tartness and herbal spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, hay, grass, earth, pepper, clove, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of fruity flavors and earthy spiciness; with nice complexity and no cloying flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly crisp and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed on the finish at all. Overall this is an excellent Biere de Garde! Great flavor complexity and balance; and extremely smooth to sip on. Highly enjoyable offering."
"Overall: I had this not knowing a thing about it this beer feels like the best ""Imperial Pilsener"" I have ever had. I was astonished on the greatness of this beer. I will but it again and again yes that good...Salud!"

"Food match: With a brew of such vinous characters I would recommend a food match similar to a like-minded wine, Pinot Gris; Bouillabaisse, Peruvian ceviche, Paella or Spaghetti aglio olio e peperoncino."
""
""
"Smell is not to much to talk about...a light malt/lager-like aroma, not really as I remember it. Taste is a thinnish mouthfeel and slightly tart then some hoppiness. Finishes quickly..I remember this being much better years back. The bottle is fresh and in good condition, dunno..maybe it's the trained palate I've attained in the years since last sampling."
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 2 inch puffy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, light fruits, and some skunky aromas that fade as the beer warms. Taste is of grain, grass/hay, slight fruit, and some herbal hop flavors. There is also a stinging alcohol flavor in the mouth with each sip. A mild bitterness lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the skunky aromas that fade out are somewhat weird."
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. Fruity and earthy and refreshing. Thank a lot, Dan."
""

"It tastes light, too - almost like drinking a Riesling. But that's a good thing, provided that you have the right food for it. It goes well with anything you'd use white wine for - cheese, fruit, delicately seasoned seafood. The alcohol content is well hidden, which makes it a very good session beer for long summer evenings - start with grilled scallops and vegetables, continue on with hard cheese and prosciutto, then finish with fresh fruit and brie. This beer can go along with all of these."
""
""
""
"D: This beer is quite subtle in terms of flavor, so it's pretty easy to drink despite the booziness. I would have it again, but I think I'd like to get more experience with the style before doing so."
""
""
""
""
"This is a wonderful biere de garde. Has a bit of sourness attached to it, but it would not be confused with a flemish red. This is a wonderful beer for those that like farmhouse styles"
""
""
"a half finger of bright white foam sits atop a crystal clear bright golden body. smells of apples and pears with a touch of cinnamon and clove. also shows some traces of bready yeast and hops. the taste is outstanding, tart crisp fruits lead the way to a well balanced bready malt body with traces of yeast and hops. mouthfeel is very sharp at first with a creamy feel to the body and a short crisp finish. as the beer warms the alochol comes out from hiding, but never dominates. this is an excellant beer and at $8 a bottle i will be buying more of these."
""
""
""
"Too boozy and too grainy/metallic."
"Packs a lot more flavour than the the look or smell of it gives away. Tasty!"
"O: Nice beer, nice balance. Champagne of beers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this grew on me. It's highly quaffable, but take your time and sip this one a bit, enjoy the changes as it warms up and the flavor profile opens. Almost too drinkable, but the 8.5% ABV does start making itself feel known after sneaking up at first."
""

"Pours an amazing clear gold color w/ a big three finger head. The head is quickly down to one finger after a couple minutes. Excellent carbonation, and fantastic lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is spices, some yeast, malt, and slight funkiness. Very smooth, refreshing, and clean smelling. Taste is similar to the nose- nothing different here. This beer is super smooth, spicy and refreshing. I don't get any of the 8.5% ABV in the taste at all. This would be an incredible summer beer- if you don't mind the higher alcohol, and don't want a session brew. Overall, this is good- but maybe a hair short of great. Still, I would get this again. Cheers."
"This is still a fairly unfamiliar style to me, but I get what they're doing and this one does it very well."
"3 Monts pours a crystal clear goldenrod, with a buckshot of lemon shining through upon being held up to light. The fluffy white foam that sprung up after each pour always had good height and head retention. Lacing started out solid, and only got nicer with each subsequent pour. The nose is a little timid, but does feature a very nice, delicate balance between pale and stone fruits and peppery aromas. The flavor is a bit more robust, but still centers around that fruit-pepper dichotomy. There's a bit of honey that joins in with the apples and pears up front, and a subtle warming from the alcohol that comes in along with the spicy phenols. The mouthfeel is absolutely phenomenal. The body is surprisingly light given the solid malt presence, and the carbonation is expansive and active, Belgian at its finest. 3 Monts is a great beer and a very good Biere de Garde, one I'd be more than happy to have again."
"O: 3 Monts was really enjoyable. It has a simple yet complex taste. It wasn’t too expensive either so I would happily purchase this beer again."
"O: This beer could go with anything. I enjoyed it by itself on a relaxing night in SC. Great way to get back into the swing of things. Very nice beer."
"O - Enjoyable, I would drink it again on a hot summer day. An overall easy to like, easy to drink beer."
"O - Defiantly a table beer. This beer is nice, but maybe subtle to a fault until you let it play with food. I threw it at a lentil/mushroom/kale pasta dish and it really shined, cleaning the lentil off my tongue, while highlighting the mushroom and spices of the dish. The sweetness of the Belgian candy sugar seemed to help balance out the dryness of the dish as a whole. Great balance of flavors and a quality Biere de Garde."
"Poured a 3"" white head slow to recede. Clear light gold / dark straw yellow body. Smells mildly like a lager but with an herbal element to it. Taste when colder is mildly malty and after a little warmer a citrusy aspect comes out. It's also creamy and has a medium long finish. Nice ale."
"Of course, this is a nice product to drink but far from great beer and far from deserving all the praise it receives on French territory."
"Good but not great."
"O- Really dry if compared to my previous biere de garde tastings; kinda reminds of a lager, with very nice drinkability. Overall a very nice beer in it's simplicity"
"O - A good beer but not enough body to be a winner, but if you compare it to other blond beers...."
"Overall: if they put this in 12oz 4-packs or 6-packs, I'd always keep it stocked."
"O - On a hot day you could drink this all day long. The alcohol is very well hidden. A great beer."
"O: Some complexity without too much and a very interesting beer. One worth having again..."
"O - Quality. Easy drinking, interesting tipple. Will definately try again."
"I was a bit apprehensive about this one after not enjoying the Reserve at all, but this was really quite good."
"The look of this beer after I poured it was fantastice. Bright golden color, perfect clarity, not even a trace of sediment in the bottle I got. The head was massive, a fine white foam with great consistency. Head lingers throughout the entire beer leaving clumps of lace all around the glass, there is a fine layer of bubbles that never breaks across the surface of the brew. Aromas a of light fruits, a bit of must and hay in there, but very clean. Flavor has a nice intensity. Medium body with a very powerful finish. A belgian tripel-like fruitiness is complimented by the alcohol burn on the finish, very cool beer and I nice break from all the sours/stouts/IPA's I've been drinking."
"Dr: Price is pretty high for the limited quality, but it's pretty drinkable. I wish it were more complex."
"Overall, 3 Monts is a really, really good beer. When I was first getting into the world of craft beer, I remember having another offering from Saint-sylvestre, Gavroche, that really opened my eyes. This beer is as good as I remember Gavroche to be, and I'm really glad I tried it. I've always thought that the bier de garde was a very underrated style, and this brew only helped to reinforce that notion, as this is a very nice drinking beer."
"The beer is golden yellow hued, with a small, white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma offers some funk, yeast, fruit (apples, in particular), and alcohol. The flavor is OK, with a really heavy apple presence. Sweetness grows as I make my way through the glass. Overall, this was an oddity, but I did enjoy it. I'd be interested to try it again."
"I had no Idea what to expect and I was pretty stoked with what I got, it reminds me of a jacked up Pil. I was expecting a funky saison but what I got was still most satisfying, some surprises work out well in the end"
"Overall a pretty good beverage. After a few glasses, you certainly start feeling the alcohol. Certainly one of the better Beire de Gardes I have tried"
" This beer would be great on a hot summer day as it was very refreshing and highly drinkable."
"O: Definitly drink this one over and over again and again..."
"Wow, disappointed in this beer. I expected a BSPA or Biere de Garde flavors but all I got was American adjunct lager. The beer is well made, no signs of infection or anything else, the flavor is just not close to what it should be. Curious to see what this tastes like as it warms. I don't think this is a biere de garde as the malt doesn't suggest it. This reminds me of a strong euro lager. The yeast is boring. What happened here?"
"This beer is very dry despite being one of the creamiest beers I""ve tasted. It has a great finish and is very drinkable. Overall, a fantastic beer that hasn't received the attention it deserves."
"D- This beer is very light and subtle but the fizz starts to make it a bit to bland as it washes out the flavor and it also boost the bitterness which dominates the finish."
"jd"
"Well done."
"D: Drinks quite nicely, especially for its ABV; this one could sneak up on you for sure!"
"Drinkability - Talk about a good drinker. It's hard to sip this beer which is too bad because it deserves a careful pace. It defines crisp and clean. Well done."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the inclusive smell. It had a nice sweetness, with inclusions of candy esters and clean malts all around. In the flavor, however, it was hard to pick up on any of the nice flavors alluded to in the nose, and a fairly standard beer is presented."
"Nice saison. This is what northern French beers are all about."
"M - Ligher bodied, high carbonation."
"D: very very high especially given the abv, and I even suspect this beer has a considerably low calorie to alcohol ratio to boot (like Duvel)."
"Easy drinking. Not as complex as some others, but not a negative to drinkability. Very worthy of a try and repeat performance."
"D - almost too drinkable because of the light flavors, but also complex compared to it's generic golden lager bretheren, a very good beer and a nice discovery on my part, will be searching out this style again."
"I've only had about 3 interpretations of this style, and this is by far my favourite. It's a tricky one that made me really think and analyze everything going on from the nose to its drinkability, and its 750ml size easily allowed me to do that. It is subtle, but that's half the fun about picking everything out. Well balanced and dangerously quaffable. It's almost scary to say that this is an easy session beer, even at 8.5% ABV. I'm really glad I was able to get my hands on this one (thanks to the fantastic selection at Premier Wines and Spirits in Halifax). It really did make me appreciate this style that much more. Thumbs way up!"
"Overall another impressive beer from Saint Sylvestre although I enjoyed their Grande Reserve better."
"From a bottle at Des Moines Brewfest, a beer I'd wanted to try for some time. Pours a golden color with a good head. The aroma is pear and some fresh bread (baguette specifically) The beer is dry and has some apricot, some baguette, a mild toasty note, and a good bit of bitterness. Really very good, a classic."
"Overall: Interesting flavors. A bit too sweet for my tastes, but still enjoyed it."
"A decent beer. I'll forgive a touch of possible lightstrike and say that this is decent. Unfortunately, it lacks the real fruity maltiness of a Biere de Garde."
"Taste is a typical bottom fermented beer. The beer is dominated by the malt, expecially pilsmalt, rounded of by a light dextrinous, doughy maltiness. Also some bready notes. The mouthfeel is dry and has a light bitterness. Not the typical biere de garde, but what is."
"Drinkability: Great, easy drinking beer, very refreshing. I will most certainly have this beer again."
"D: Pretty good beer, but I enjoyed the other one I've tried for them. The flavouring could be better, but as it is, it's not a bad beer."
"D - Drinks like a 4% abv pilsner, not a 8.5% abv strong ale. Not something I would seek out again, but still drinkable."
"D- The grain and sourness was a nice surprise in what was an otherwise boring beer. I would probably drink this over something like a pale ale, but otherwise not something I would revisit."
"Milder cousin to the Special Ale/Grand Reserve of the same name. This is a bit weak in comparison, but this is a more refreshing beer, and could be an excellent introduction to these beers with the yeast funk."
"I guess I need to try this again, I don't see what all the fuss is about."
"Not a bad beer at all, I just expected something a little different."
"The palate opens with a beautiful, delicate, herbal character with a lemon and grassy, hay-like hops most prominent. Delicate and nuanced, there's a light pepper-like zing. Malt character is light but complex with a blend of crackers, a little honey, both of which work very well with the opening flavors. A little dried ginger, especially on the finish, this beer is crisp with a light fruit character - red apples and maybe some pears? The flavors on this beer are so delicate that the power of suggestion definitely has its way. The finish is gorgeous. Long, drying with a blend of spice and a light hop bitterness, this is beautifully balanced. A little alcohol appears too. Carbonation is high, making this light-bodied beer immensely refreshing and quenching. Fantastic stuff, I'm glad I can pick up more of this at my local Whole Foods!"
"An interesting and pretty tasty beer, with a nice, rounded Belgian quality, what with the pale malts, yeast, spice, and very well obfuscated, elevated ABV running the show. Given the style description, this hits it bang-on, in all the right ways, and remains eminently drinkable."
"Taste: Fairly crisp and sweet up front with lemon, pear, and spice with intense almost notes - which is quite interesting and totally unexpected form the smell. Grains are light and strawlike throughout. In the middle the beer gets a little drier and the almond flavor becomes more nutty. Some smooth caramel and pepper spice. The finish is quite dry with noticeable alcohol and some residual almond, pear and spice (mostly pepper)"
"Overall average golden style strong ale that is quite overpriced for the quality if you ask me. Seemed like a wannabe Duvel. Not terrible though."
"D - Interesting beer with some appealing flavours. Smell and taste work together to form a lovely unison. Relatively smooth so could be drunk all day - if you can be bothered getting the metal clasp off the cork!"
"Overall, very drinkable. Delicious. Highly recommend this one. Goes nicely with food."
"D- I wanted to like this, but in the end I was not impressed. Slightly sweet, boozy, and slightly astringent."
"Very good for the style, the kind of beer that makes me bolt outside and enjoy the meadow and hug sheep."
"D: A really good and tasty biere de garde. I've been wanting to try this for the longest time. I'm glad some bottles finally showed up in the Southland."
"Overall, I am surprised by the quality of this beer, even if this one expired almost a year ago. I saw another one on the shelves without any expiration date so I think this mention is not really useful."
"Great beer with tons of character."
"Out of a generously provided bottle from a friend this beer was a clear golden color with a towering head of foam that both retained well and laced nicely as it slowly gave way. An impressive looking brew! The aroma was exotic and enjoyable. Sour apples, Belgian-style yeast funk, candy sugar, fruit and floral notes and a healthy dose of spices. Multi-faceted and impressive. The flavors were similar to a Belgian beer without so much emphasis on the yeast. Tart apples, lemon zest, sugary-sweetness, pepper, herbal and grassy notes and a light mustiness. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation lively. Though this higher carbonation reduced how quaffable the beer was it was still very refreshing and summery."
"Notes: Makes me think of a rustic France fruit orchard/farm. Interesting mix of flavors. Had a 750 ml so I reduced some down to make a sauce that was a really nice light, fruity, and spiced tasting sauce."
"Super drinkable beer, just one problem it comes at the cost of flavor and complexity. Too bad this isn't as complex as say Hennepin."
"It appeared to be like a round bodied lager based beer, which isn't what it should. Having said that I quite enjoyed the beer!"
"First time with the style + not what I expected - very summery and drinkable, but wouldn't mind more malt and less burn. A bit too much like wine for beer."
"Notes: A pleasant surprise."
"taste has some musty type funk in the forefront, bit of spice profile from the yeast. finishes dry and slightly tart.light on the palate. mouthfeel is light and spritzy, this is an easy to drink beer despite the high abv."
"Overall this is a quite drinkable beer for 8.5% abv. It's well balanced and complex. None of the flavors dominate and they all blend nicely together."
"Trois Monts is a beer to be taken cautiously. It is quite drinkable, but the overall high gravity contributes to a body that is, fortunately, self limiting. Certainly worth a try."
"D: Good but not quite what I was expecting. The sweet and tart combination worked much better in the nose than in the taste. A stronger tart with a back up sweetness would have been more enjoyable, in my opinion."
"This would pair well with chicken shwarma."
"D: Very good for sipping to admire the complexities."
"This was my first biere de garde, and a fairly pleasurable initial experience. The flavours aren't exactly down my alley, but it seemed well done. Thanks to Shawn for the bottle which has been stored in Derek's fridge for a month or two."
"D: Its got character, but it's a little boozy."
"D: Overall this one goes down pretty easy. Although not terribly complex, it basks in sunny summer simplicity. A very commendable showing for a flanders golden."
"A beer to be had at least once."
" Just is missing something that keeps me from going I want more. Have always read good things about it but will have to give this another chance eventually."
"D-Would have no problem with a bottle to myself but 12oz was plenty for me. Not very high in alcohol and a good enough taste to make another purchase."
"I can see how this beer could be perfect in the right environment. It's a relatively high abv but its so easy drinking, I'd think it'd make a great replacement to a summer wine. Very tart and fruity but balanced by malt so it's not overpowering. Light and carbonated. Not really what I look for in a beer but it works. Bit overpriced here because of its boutique factor so probably won't really go out of my way for it often but it was an enjoyable experience."
"This French beer is close enough to Belgium in taste and geographical location yet it has its very own unique properties. Great beer and one I'm always amazed to see omitted from top 10, 20 or whatever beer lists."
"I'd not drink this regularly but as an experience it was quite something. I'm more likely to buy again to share a tasting session with another person. We had this with a meal and it was a poor choice for accompanying food (Tarragon Butter stuffed Roast chicken) - much better in isolation I'd say."
"Subtle and sublime. A superb beer from start to finish. I would not buy this regularly, but it makes for an excellent change of pace. Quite rustic and charming. Give this a try."
"Taste and mouthfeel: yummy! I like so much this style of beers. The alcoholic aftertaste is strong though. Attention not to lose the number of glasses you have, especially if you open such a big bottle alone."
"D - So refreshing and enjoyable. This would be a summer drink that I would absolutely crave. I'll take this instead of champaign or most white wines any day. Incredibly balanced and unique. Closest resemblance would be Orval or maybe Saison Dupont, just more of that lemon grass funk."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a big foamy white head. Light fruit aroma with hints of apple, pear, white grape, spice and alcohol. Carbonated and slightly spicy with light fruit notes and a strong alcohol presence. Apple, pear, grape, pepper alcohol warmth with a slightly dry finish."
"I would love to try this one before it had to spend two months on a boat..."
"Thick, syrupy malt flavour on the tongue progresses to a long hoppy palate with a lot of flavour. It's rich and strong with hints of coriander, soil and citrus characters. Slightly stinging mouthfeel and intense flavour makes it respectable but it's not all that complex, just strong and long, like my penis."
"d: a nice beer, easily drinkable given the relatively high abv"
"Drinkable for the abv. Right on style."
"This beer had a good yeasty and bread like aroma it was very complex with lots of earthy grain and grass tones. It was very crisp. The taste is about the same but a little bitterer. There is a great use of hops. It is a very refreshing beer with an almost medium body and moderate bite. Brilliant body clean yellow body with the right amount of head and lace."
"I will try more in this style."
"The aroma is grainy, and yeasty with some hops. The appearance is yellow gold with a foamy head. The flavor is decent and like the aroma with somewhat of a sharp taste. The palate is smooth but not that thick. The beer is pretty good overall but lacks anything special that stands out."
"After having the Oro De Calabaza, my interest was sparked with this style, so I wanted to go with an authentic example. Pours an interesting clear straw color, with 2 fingers worth of fizzy white heading. Lots of carbonation appears to be in this beer as evidenced by the many bubbles rising to the top of the glass. From smell I get lots of grain and hay, a bit of funky barnyard...yeah that is about it as far as smell is concerned. Very complex flavor, minerally, spicy yet sweet, more essences of funk and bright grain tastes. Mouthfeel is light, and as expected, very carbonated, almost like sipping on funky champaign. Leaves an interesting numb feeling on the teeth as well, which I suspect is the strength of the beer talking. Drinking a glass or two of this is no problem in my book. I can see how some might consider this to be a cousin to Saison in that they share some of the same complexities and farmhouse connotations. 3 Monts is a winner for me, paired nicely with some sea salted pita chips and hummus. Cheers"
"Notes and tasted on 5/31/04."
"Pours a brilliant and bright gold with a two finger cap of fluffy white foam that resembles snow covered hills as it slides slowly to a paper thin covering. The nose is slightly sweet and grainy with floral grassy notes,like I just opened the window on a early spring morning,wow this is nice. I must admit that I was a little apprehensive when I purchased this,because my last experience with a Flanders Red was not so enjoyable. I will never let my naivety rule my beer purchasing again,I made a wise decision picking up the 3 Monts! I will try a Flanders Red again,but for now I think Biere de Garde is the top dogg. Upfront it's a bit spicy and complex with light fruits(pear and white grape) and graininess that is earthy and seemingly aged to perfection. Subtle alcohol warms the belly and drys the pallet. The carbonation is something I have never experienced,it's very soothing and soft,a nice contrast to the peppery flavors that bite the tongue. This is one classy azz beer,I feel like I'm drinking something fit for a King."
"This felt lighter than an 8.5ABV & it did appeal tremendously as a world class session drink (if one can afford & stay upright)"
"Pours a pale golden yellow color, no sediment, slight haze and a big frothy pure white head with some rising carbonation. Classic artisinal farmhouse nose, slightly grassy and hay-like, with a limey bitterness quality about it smoothed out by a layer of biscuits and spicy yeast. Pale malts really do an excellent job of balancing the dry, grassy hop character. Medium bodied with very bright carbonation. Quality beer."
"This beer changes a lot after it warms up a little bit. Apparently my fridge was far to cold for this beer."
"D, notes: This is a good beer that is very sessionable. I liked the subtle funk as a balancing point."
"D - Yup. This is ideal warm weather ale to swirl down. Probably food friendly, too. I'd drink this again."
"Slightly sweet, mildly alcoholic scent with traces of bread, spice and hops. Tangy, spicy flavour with a good malt profile. A little bit low on the hops. Alright carbonation, not to overpowering. Nice to drink, but fairly strong...the alcohol is reasonably noticeable and this hampers the drinkability quite a bit."
"oh by the way, this is a great value at $5.00 for a 750ml bottle, can't beat the price vs. quality, would gladly pay $8 to $9 for a 750ml."
"Drinkability: A lot of interesting elements in this beer; although I wish it were a bit dryer on the finish, it is otherwise quite engaging"
"The beer pours a clear gold hue with several small streams of carbonation rising to the surface. Very fizzy sounding bleached white head foams up 4 cm easily. Aroma is green apple, must white grapes, some booze and hints of spiciness. First sip reveals ave to lite body with very fine fizzy carbonation. Flavor is sweet white wine and grapes with fruity apple and melon but finishes very dry and bitey with some booze showing up. There is a little warming as well. A decent beer but not a favorite of mine, I probably wont seek this one out again."
"This is about as smooth as a lager can be. Even with the high ABV, this can be enjoyed on a nice warm summer day."
"A 750 mL bottle of 3 Monts Flanders Golden Ale. A darker golden color with a big white head that left little lacing on the glass. The aroma is herbal and earthy, bready, slightly musky, and also clove. Smooth and round with a medium body. Malt up front followed by an influence of hops. Dry with a mineral twang. Spicy, earthy and sweet malt characteristics all meld together to produce a complex flavor profile. The finish is pepper hops and alcohol leaving a pleasant warmness. Definitely worth seeking if you haven't had the pleasure."
"Overall: A truly excellent craft farmhouse ale. I've about decided to stop trying American craft ""Farmhouse ales"" because they simply can't compete with the real thing (exception: Hennepin and anything out of Quebec). This would be amazing with French cooking -- rabbit, quail, coq au vin, anything you'd serve with Champagne. I can't wait to buy a case and stick it in my cellar!"
"This beer gets my enthusiastic approval. I will seek it out."
" It brought to mind a variety of possible food pairings. I'll have to get a few bottles more of this to try with different combinations at a food and beer experiment with my friends. By chance, I had the second half with kielbasa and pierogies for dinner, and it went very well together (though I could think of other good possibilities as well."
"Pours a clear gold with a frothy white head. Flavor has a sweet tang to it. This immediately reminds me of the Obolon Krepkoe. Grain attributes and a sweet tone. And high alcohol as well. It's smooth for the most part with just a wee bit of bite on it. Feel is nice. Very drinkable, yes. But this reminds me of so many other beers I have had. It doesn't really stand out. And who is the moron who did the whole cork thing with the metal bar? Really. Dumb."
"well, i think this is my first french beer, while they did cave in to the nazis, i suppose i can forget about that for just a bit while i review this beer. btw i thought i told the bros to update so we can see what countries we've had beers from. ANYWAY... has a beautiful color to it, a VERY busy beer, lots of carbonation, a big white head is also prominent. smell alot like your belgian sparkling ales and such. taste is very very good, its a smooth drinking beer that dances in the mouth from the carbonation."
"The champagne of the beer world! Not in the sense that it is the best, I have certainly had better beers, but I could definitely see this as a good substitute for champers. May not appeal to lovers of dark, rich beers, but is undoubtedly classy, clean and very good. I found this 750mL bottle for $15, but it can be seen for over $22 in some bottle shops, so be sure you don't get ripped off!"
"Beer was unavailable for a while. Had a distirbution problem? Seems to be somewhat flat and lacking some flavor. I remember there being some floaties, or it being unfermented. Does anybody know if they changed the recipe? If so, I was unimpressed!!!!"
"Not bad - recommended..."
"I realize this beer has been around for some time but I am more and more impressed with French beers lately. A true pleasure and well priced at $7."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, funky, earthy, with a mineral and spice finish."
"Overall - I felt a bit disappointed by this, my first Biere de Garde. Quite interesting, but nothing too special."
"not too shabby. would drink again."
"C'est une bière moelleuse qui accompagnerait à merveille un repas."
"Moderate body, with lively active carbonation, which tingles down your throat with each mouthful. It is so incredibly refreshing on a hot day, and is easy to drink. I could get through a couple of bottles of this with ease."
"Weird one this. I don't know if it's a stylistic difference that I find so challenging, but there's bits to this that make it rather difficult to drink. Whether it's the intensity of the yeast character, the heat of the alcohol which isn't quite covered up, or something else - something rankles with me here. When I've tried more Bières de garde, I'll probably know more, but for now I'll say good, but not great."
"Drinkability- This is one interesting beer and I hope our paths will cross again. This is meant to be cellared and likely has been at the store I bought it from as I have not seen another since. But I would like to keep another to cellar back as well. A really smooth pleasurable bier de garde."
"Glass becomes gilded as it is filled, slightly cloudy, it appears with a crown of tight white head, stable and unyielding to time. Slight farmhouse undercurrent in the nose, soft and mellow, refined and relaxed, sour earthy apple with a touch of floral hop. Active carbonation in a light body, a nice spice ahead of sour, bready grains imbued with a delicate, sweet apple note, just underbalanced with an earthy hop bitterness. Alcohol is very well hidden. Refreshing and relaxing, though not as complex as other examples of the style, but satisfying."
"Review dated 10-19-2007, translated 1-5-2008"
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. Light and refreshing."
"D - Very drinkable beer. The funkiness keeps it interesting and the hops and yeasty, spicy character make for a refreshing beer that is hard to put down."
"Taste has the same lightness as the aroma, with vanilla and wheat combining with just a touch of hops. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and bubbly with a fantastic smoothness to it. This is a deceptively strong beer, as there isn't a hint of alcohol anywhere to be noticed. Definately easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel was zesty with a medium to light body."
"Overrated, but I'm glad I experienced it regardless."
"D - Nice enough but I've had better beers in this style."
"While I know Biere de Garde is a mile wide style-wise, I found this to be a very unusual Bier de Garde compared to othes I've had...in appearance, aroma, and flavor it was light and lemon-y, which really struck me as characteristics that would be more suited to say a witbier than to this style. It was a very light yellow and highly effervescent. Aroma was very faint and smelled like lemon zest with a bit of maltiness. Flavor was a bit sour (that lemon zest again) with a lot of maltiness for such a light smelling and tasting beer. I would recommend this beer as I found it very interesting. However, I didn't find drinking it to be particulary pleasant. This is a curiousity, not a great beer."
"A second pour gave me residual yeast but no extra flavour. A lively mouthfeel but the same citrus and grass. In wine you'd say it was herbaceous. You say this when you can't pinpoint the flavour. This is too delicate a beer to really dissect so I'll say it's herbaceous with a twist of lime."
"Oh well, I've had better, but this isn't terrible in any way, just not my taste."
"D: Not a bad brew that Ive got here. Nice flavor, good balance. Doesnt totally stand out from the pack though."
"About to go after the 2nd glass....can't wait!"
"It was a pain in the butt to get the cork out of this with its metal strap. When I finally did, this poured much lighter than Id expected, even for a ""godlen ale"" ... very light yellow, with a fizzy appearance and light white fizzy head. The aroma is damn near American macro-like, starchy and stark. Likewise, the first impression of this beer almost suckers me into thinking ""American light lager"" ... but there is a stronger undertow here, a more boisterous cacophony of flavors and a clearly more muscular pull that develops and develops and develops the more I drink. Quite a nice strong, yet beguiling ale. (#2801, 4/20/2007)"
"Pours a very slightly cloudy golden with a decent pure white head and not much lacing. The smell is fairly light and surprisingly pilsnerish with light floralhops and light tangy malt and the typical lager yeast smell. The taste is somewhat similar, with some added notes of light banana on the finish and some pronounced alcohol. The mouthfeel is fairly light and creamy- could be slightly crisper for my taste. Fairly drinkable, but a little boring."
"A complex and enjoyable Biere de Garde and my first for the style. Reminiscent of a dry Belgian Triple with a Lambic flair. Recommended."
"There's a hell of a lot of stuff going on in this beer and nearly all of it is excellent. Maybe a tad bit uneven at the end, but at 8.5% it's hard to imagine packing more Belgiany goodness into such a moderately sized beer."
"Nice hazy yellow pour with big cloudy head- nice lacing. No real malty aromas- very spicy and alcohol is there. Slightly odd character on first taste, and there is a dry finish with a touch of oily hops. The spices overwhelm and do well to cover up the alcohol content. Not too yeasty like expected but there is a tartness from the malt/phenol combo. Crisp and clean with some great and unique flavors."
"This begins with a nice peppery effervescence imparted by the fine carbonation. Flavors are a mildly sweet fresh pear which is tempered by a bit of acidity. The barnyard funk from the aroma doesn't make it into the flavors at all, and the relatively high ABV is expertly masked as well. This is a disturbingly easy to drink ale. Seek it out, you won't be disappointed."
"Highly carbonated, but this eases up after a while making the mouthfeel and drinkability better for me. The alcohol is well hidden. A good beer all and all, and one I would drink again if offered, but there are many more beers I would rather spend my money on. A unique enough taste that I would recommned trying this one."
"Originally reviewed on October 27, 2006. 750mL. Wispy aroma of tart bananas, almond paste and lemon rind. Wispy and very sweet smelling. Phenolic in a good way. Bright. Pour of golden hue, with super creamy fine froth, off-white. Flavor is a bold fresh spicy lemon zinger and bright white teas. The estery attitude bowls over the rising alcohol notes in a furious percolating battle for top spot. The gentle pale fruits of pear wine, cinnamon bark, plum sauce and Meyer lemons steep in a sweet syrup. A floral bouquet grabs the sugars and balances with a firm slap. A nice rendition, with great complexity, smooth drinking and lucious character."
"Cheers!"
"The carbonation is medium strong with medium sized tickling bubbles."
"D - The high carbonation hinders the drinkability, but overall this is a fantastic beer."
"Drinkability: I'd say it's about damn time I decided to open this beer up. I don't know how long I've had this, but it's been at least a couple of months. I don't know what I was waiting for, but I'm glad I decided to open it. If you can get past their wired cork, then you're in for a nice treat. If you like a beer than can turn into a dry white wine, then by golly pick this one up."
"At $12 AUD, this is very good value. Would make a more than suitable substitute for a chardonnay at the meal table."
"The only thing I ddin't really like about this beer was the aroma, which was rather dull, if not somewhat offensive. A great beer to throw in between more complex brews like abbey and pale ales or stouts. Not utterly complex but just a very relaxing, tranquil brew with just enough of a nectary/sweet feel to keep you interested. I think I'd prefer it in a 12oz or pint bottle, but I'll just have to share some instead. :)"
"Pours a lovely rich golden color with a thick white head. Initial smell and taste is of that delicious farmhouse 'yeastiness' I'm so fond of in Jenlain, although much less prominent. A little spicy on the tongue. Though a little more subdued in flavor and richness that other BdG's, this is a very well balanced beer. Extremely enjoyable- almost like a Duvel/Jenlain hybrid."
"Poured to a golden color with thick white head that dissipated by mid-glass and left little lacing. Ironically, this is the first beer Ive had where the head on the beer inside the bottle was bigger than that in the glass. Aroma was grassy floral hops. The flavor was more of the same, but a malty sweetness crept in to tame this down and leave a well-balanced, smooth finish. Im not sure why this brewer chose to secure their beer with a cork and huge metal staple, but the 3 Monts made removing it worth the work."
"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer. I'm not too into this style, so I don't think I will buy it again very much."
"3 Monts (3 Mountains) is very good beer. Even though I haven't had enough examples of this style to speak with great authority, I feel pretty confident in saying that this one can hold its own with some of the world's best. It may not be at the absolute peak, but the Biere de Garde summit is in sight."
"Aftertaste is alcohol, pepper and yeast / hop."
"D: One bottle pretty well made me drunk in a dirty way. I wasnt much interested in any more after that."
"Pours a bright yellow, with a fluffy white head that sticks around for quite a while. Smells almost a bit like a Pilsner Urquel -- those hops. You know what I mean. Doesn't taste much different, either. A lot more mouthfeel. Heavier body, and a bit of an alcohol bite, but this sure tastes like a relative to a PU."
"Doesn't taste as interesting as the bottle looks. Ther color is pale yellow. It pours with a lot of foam and bubbles smelling of flower and spices. The inital taste is dominated by a sweetness, alcohol and metal. It's followed by bread and citrus and a dry bitterness. In Sweden we have a kind of artificial candy called ""foam banana"" and this taste is also there. After the bottle was finished I walked around with a sour taste in my mouth. All and all it's not a bad beer but it's nothing to go out of your way for."
"D - high, a great beer, i could drink this i much higher volumes, if youve never tried this, but have seen it at your liquor store, GO BUY IT...NOW!!!"
"noble hop flavor and complex spicing, with ample carbonation and a decent malt backbone. meh...it's good. i'd like to get my hands on the special reserve"
"A solid beer. I will be buying more in the future. I'm enjoying this with a small plate of edam which really seems to bring out the fruit notes in the beer."
"A very solid beer though."
"Overall: This is my first Bière de Garde. I think the bottle might have been a little old. Maybe I would have been more impressed with a fresher bottle. I do like the complexity that isn't present in other styles of golden beers."
"I purchased some of these babies at a Piggly Wiggly for a little under $7.00. I know, expensive, but its a good occasional brew. I am new to Biere de Garde, and I now am in love with it. It is in a brown bottle with an oblong golden label and an annoying metal strap ontop of a cork. When you get through the ""obstacle course"" of entry containing the mines and ""booby-traps"" you can enjoy this tasty beverage. I poured this golden ale into a snifter and had about an inch of head that leaves pretty quickly. The carbonation was perfect to me, lots of bubbles espcially in a snifter. The smell was great, like honey, brown sugar, medium hops and a goon malty smell. Now for the taste... This is a good beer, pretty hoppy and almost like candy. Pretty sweet but not overpowering, a good ratio of sweetness. kind of fruity, as it got warmer it had an after taste of an apple maybe, just a hint of a delicious golden apple, also as it warmed, i noticed that the warmer it gets, so does the throat most likely because of the alcohol which is very evident from the beginning. The 8.5% ABV will creep up on you quickly, I was giggling like a schoolgirl after about 2 in a row. This is a great beer and is probably now one of my favorites, I like the beginning the middle and the end of this beer, well not the end because that means it getting empty, but you get the point, I highly recomend this beer to anyone."
"I dont know, I wasnt really crazy about this beer. It seemed like a mellow saison mixed with Bud. A decent beer to pair with certain foods, but Id probably take something with a little more bite next time."
"3 Monts is a good beer, but I doubt I'd drop $6 for one regularly. For that price there are ones I prefer more. If you could buy this stuff in 12oz bottles around the $2 mark I'd be all over it. That said, it is absolutely worth trying once or twice and makes a nice treat."
"Aroma is spicy and yeasty with a bit of bread. Poured a decent frothy head with good lacing. The head soon vanished leaving a bright yellow, clear body. Initial flavor was sweet and acidic that become moderately acidic. The body was light to medium with soft carbonation. Biere de garde's aren't my favorite style even though I love saison's. Go figure. I think I don't care for the aftertaste. However, as this style goes, this is good representative"
"Very enjoyable. I didn't expect to like this one so much."
"D: all in all, this is a delicious, easily likable and addicted beer indeed - I mean perhaps the best Biere de Garde among (only) half-a-dozen examples I've ever tried; this ""expired"" beer performs so well that I could only dream of the great potentials of the same beer that is slightly younger..."
"Overall - An excellent Biere de Garde. Up there with the best..."
"Somewhat sweet up front. Biscuit & baking bread. Some more anise & some sublte fruity notes. Herbal hops bring it home with a flinty dry finish. Medium body, fine carbonation. Sublime."
"-Oelergud"
"Marvellous beer. Highly reccomended."
"I think this is a fantastic beer. Very refreshing but also keeps you in your seat. I highly recommend this beer."
"Bright, sparkling gold, big bubbly radiant white head that quickly dissipates. Lots of complexity in the aroma: spicy and grassy, grainy and sweet, very earthy and sort of musty. Tastes initially of bitter spicy hops, becoming more grainy and producing a nice little sour note. Very grassy and earthy becoming more malty as it warms, with the sourness becoming more pronounced and lots of musty ""barnyard"" flavor creeping out. Mouthfeel is light and airy with a dry finish. Hugely drinkable, a very good example of the style."
"Complaints: The lip of the bottle drips while pouring it. Otherwise, this beer is difficult to fault."
"($5.99 / 25.4 oz tall straight champagne style bottle - corked and secured with a wire swing bar and wrapped in hard gold plastic foil)"
"May be there are some things where it is worth copying the French."
"I had the great fortune of sampling this one at Falstaff near the Bastille in Paris. Hopefully this fact didn't influence the following review. Appeared a clear golden color atop which rested a one and one half finger foamy head. Plenty of carbonation from the bottom. Smell was of sour apple and grain, probably wheat. Taste was similar, sour fruitiness with the addition of spice yielding to mouth-filling feeling of malt. A little light on the mouth. This was a pretty good beer."
"They told me this was a blond, Mondiale 2005. Light yellow colour, with Significant foamy head, easy drinkability, yeasty composition, hops, bit too much carbonation leading to drying. Apple juice, herbal, grassy, alcohol, touch of ginger, medium mouthfeel."
"Easy to drink, but not especially compelling. It's possible that this bottle was old considering the lack of head and overly-developed sweetness."
"A real suprise, i was expecting more along the lines of a belgian pale ale. Very drinkable, the abv is well hidden, i can imagine this would be great on a hot day"
"Well, I like this beer, not sure if I'm going to get it again anytime really soon, but, it's something to come back to and nice to try for sure."
"Slàinte!"
"Pours with a two-finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear light amber color. medium bodied and medium carbonation. Nose is a slight malt. Starts with sweet and crisp, finish is sweet and sour. I thought it might be like a a Belgian golden ale but it isn't even close. $5.99 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Poured out of a 750 mL bottle with a stapled cork (did not need a corkscrew to open though). Great carbonation and lacing poured around the glass. Did not have the scent of alcohol as some other beers of the ABV. Nice balance of hops with spices that play well in the mouth."
"Straw colored yellow body with a hefty cap of white head. Aroma is sweet and fruity with an earthy yeasty note and a bit of horse blanket thrown in. Spicy, herbal flavor ends fairly dry. Very interesting brew. Great beer to showcase alot of flavors people wouldn't normally like."
"750 ml bottle with shrink wrap and metal bail, required a corkscrew to remove cork."
"Bottle (1993  drank in 1994): Poured a golden colour ale with a huge white bubbly head with great retention. Aroma is quite particular with a mix of spices and strong sweet floral malt. Taste is quite reminiscent of a Belgian ale (might be the spice and the sweet malt) without all the yeast. Overall, this is probably one of the top 5 beer from France but not as great as the Bière Nouvelle from the same brewery."
"Pours a brilliantly clear, bright gold color. It is well carbonated, which holds up a fluffy, thick, white head. This has a wonderful sharp, herbal, grassy aroma, with noes of lemon, hay, and vanilla. The taste is lightly tart with a lemon zing to it. It is just so light and refreshing. With all of the carbonation this beer dances across my tongue. The finish is sharp and herbal, with a peppery bite from both the carbonation and the yeast by-products. In fact, this beer is quite floral in some ways, quite dry as well. Contradictorilly, this has some the nice clean notes of a pilsner (crisp malt notes up front), which compliments the other flavors quite well. This is very akin to a dry white wine, perhaps a Savignon Blanc, though it is not as acidic. It does have the sharp, spicy, dry fruit that a S-Blanc has. This is quite good, and quite enjoyable."
"Pours out a clear golden/yellow color with a big head that took a while to settle down. Smell consisted of yeast, malts, and some farmhouse aromas. It did seem a little light though, but perhaps it was served too cold. Taste consisted of white grapes mostly combined with some spiciness, yeast, and some hops show their strength as well. Mouthfeel was nice. Finished a little dry which felt nice in a while. I didn't expect this beer to be that good but it did take me by surprise. I think I found a new favorite belgian..by France? Believe it."
"Mysterious at first but as it warmed it became very complex. Light grain providing a caramel sweetness throughout but for this one, the hops dominate. Dry, herbal and very fruity with notes of lemon especially but also pears and honey."
"I somehow managed to enjoy this one in spite of the pain in the ass metal on the cork!! Someone in the July 4th thread came up with the idea to have a French beer, and it's definitely a good idea. I admit I didn't expect much from this one, but I'm surprised how well this one turned out. Quite good, and I would enjoy seeing this one around again."
"750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium gold color with three fingers of head. There is just a little lacing left on the glass. The smell is fruity, sweet, and spicy. Peppery aromas come from the malt, with hints of white grape and ginger. The taste has a nice light malt background, lots of spices up front. Some more fruity characters linger, but the spices stay throughout. The mouthfeel is fairly strong for this type of beer. For 8.5%, the drinkability is pretty good too. I had this with walleye and it was a great pairing."
"Backwash: Stands along with the Grand Réserve as one of the finest beers available. I dont care if one calls it a pale ale, Belgian strong ale, or Bière de Garde (my personal choice); this is one of the finest bibulatory experiences you can find. The extra dryness and structure of the Grand Réserve makes it a better match overall for food, but this is perhaps better for rich hors doeuvres like the cheese, charcuterie, and grilled meats suggested by the label."
"P.S. This beer works amazingly with cheese and crackers. Definitely a beer to pair food with imo."
"The taste is spicy and phenolic, and largely focused on the yeast. As it warms, I taste more yeast, and then alcohol, but little else. I don't even get much of a fruit, malt or hoppy taste. Just alcohol and yeast (which I normally love to detect in my beers, but only in conjuction with other flavors). Of course, yeast and alcohol and little else made for what I consider to be a rather unbalanced beer."
"The head is thin and dense. Nice opaque golden color. The smell was disappointing as I couldnt find anything but some skunkiness. The taste is enjoyable, fruity but mostly just enjoyable, very hard to define. The alcohol is clearly noticeable. The hops are fruity and remain subtle. The brew shows some hints of citrus and is kind of refreshing, although its alcohol content makes it hard to be a good session beer. Some liquor aspects, maybe cherry liquor. Somehow floury. Its good, but I think I expected more after reading other reviews."
"I could sit on the porch drinking this all summer, if I had the time and money."
"750 ml bottle pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head that lasts. Spicy, fruity, yeasty aroma. Spicy and peppery apple and oak flavors, more hoppy than I expected. Medium body with a crisp and snappy mouthfeel, finishes very dry. I really like this one."
"Well, I can now say that I know the French can make beer, and it's definitely not swill. It's reasonably flavorful, but it has some flat spots in the flavor curve, never jumping out and asserting itself, seemingly content to be just OK. It doesn't offend, and it doesn't amaze. Rather, it has enough character to stimulate the palate, but not to wow it. Hey, it's better than just mediocre, actually approaching good, but coming up short. The ABV does its part in limiting the drinkability. So now I've tried it, but honestly, after this one, I'll likely look elsewhere."
"Mild malt aroma. Bitter floral hops and a bit metallic. Sweet aroma. Fine foamy white lacing head over a drak golden clear body. Heavy watery body with medium-high carbonation. Starts moderately sweet with light malts. Alcohol taste, some sugar. Finishes with good bitterness and a floral hoppiness. After is medium dry bitter with some fruitiness."
"This beer was so ridiculously easy to open. I mean come on, unwrap the foil top, take a scissor and pop the staple off, and remove the cork as normal. Is that so hard genius? (lol) Anyway this beer pours out a nice light blondeish/golden colour with a big, fluffy white head of foam. The aromas are all lemon peel, various spices, french yeast, malt, hops and more. The taste is zesty, hoppy, spicy, lemony, and lovely. The mouthfeel is soft on the tongue, yet sharp and warming on the finish. The drinkability is great. Viva La France!"
"Ok, nobody can tell me that the french can't make beer. It takes a lot of trouble opening it. Corked with a swing top bar. I couldn't figure it out, cut myself trying. The beer was worth it. The most gorgeous thing I've ever seen. Perfectly clear golden color with a large pillowy white head that would last forever, as if I would wait that long. A little spiciness with some vanilla. Very clean tasting. Very light in body. Worthy of being one of the worlds top beers."
"Thanks so much to jcalbi!!"
"my main critizism of this beer is the cork. i can only imagine how much better this beer would be if it was crown capped, and the drinkability would go possibly a full point higher if it was without it. i think one really needs to get this beer fresh to enjoy its flavors before it gets interrupted. still holds its own with some of europes finest tho."
"IMHO: Normally, higher alcohol beers improve with a lowering temperature. This one however, begins to show all of its weaker characteristics. Not a flattering contrast of what are usually a good combination of flavors and textures. It is what some American breweries have done to pale aletaken away all subtlety."
"It maintains a delicate balance between creamy and spritzy. Gloriously gulpable, but show some control and savor this one."
"Man what nice looking beer poured a brilliant yellow with huge rocky head,watching it come down right now,smell was yeasty and slightly fruity.the taste started out a little yeasty with some slight fruity notes ending mineral like.Nice complex ale even better than what I thought it would be."
"This Flanders Golden Ale pours a real gold color and processes a fine white head with trickle of lace. A complex aroma of spicy hops, faint hint of malt and alcohol fades rather quickly. The medium dry malt body is ever so lightly sweet is fairly grainy. The medium-high hop content is spicy with a sharp grapefruit edginess. The fine champagne-like carbonation tickles the senses. Theres some noticeable alcohol, but it fits in well with the overall flavor scheme. The flavors, separate at first, begin to blend and make for a well-rounded and smoother drinking beer, while remaining somewhat dry throughout."
"Straw-coloured, golden and clear. Beautiful foam, quite perstistent, light and soft. Herbaceous more than floreal, the smell is of dry grass, hay; the flavour is typical of a lager beer. The alcool is quite perceptible, but less than the actual ABV of 8.5°. The taste is characterized by bread, dry pasta. Well balanced, with good notes of bitterness. The body is full and the aftertaste is bitter, specially after some minutes of rest."
"This is without a doubt the hardest cork I've ever had to remove. I advise to knead the edges of the cork with your thumbs forcing it up and working around alternating edges. Twisting it off doesn't seem to work very well. It finally popped off violently after breaking a sweat trying to get it off. The beer glows a brilliant pale gold in the glass. The flavor is very subtle. I picked up some grassy taste along with a alcohol bite. It reminded me of some of the lighter Unibroue products. Priced about the same as Unibroue too. Hints of goat's cheese? Maybe this would work well as a pairing."
"This is certainly unique. The cork was a pain in the ass. Pours the color of your average lager with a nice large white head. The aroma is strange. Kind of like musty old clothes with some citrus. This is the first beer I've had where I enjoy the taste but not so much the smell. The taste is really difficult to describe but I'll give it a shot. Ripe pears and sour apples dominate with a firm sweet malt backbone. It's kind of dry in the finish and has a definite wine-like flavor. The drinkability is awesome, but don't drink it too cold! It's much better as it warms up a little. Give it a try when you want something different."
"Very enjoyable. A nice French country ale."
"This one pours a deep golden color with a sturdy, white head that leaves giant rings of lace. Steady carbonation is present. Smell is rather yeasty with notes of white grapes and other assorted fruit. Has a champagne-like aroma. Taste is more yeast and fruit. Rather prickly and carbonated, yet creamy in the mouth. An excellent balance of the two. Drinkability is quite good for a brew of its size. This ale pairs nicely with Thanksgiving dinner, or any good food for that matter."
"I asked a friend of mine to bring me a couple of bottles of this beer when he went on vacation to France. 3 Monts pours gold colour topped by a nice white head. The aroma consists of yeast and fruity hints. Taste was not what i expected. I don't know if the taste has been deteriorated dew to my friend bringing it from France. Good carbonation and feels really good when in mouth."
"Cloudy golden yellow, dense creamy head. Sweet grains, herbal hop aroma. The beer begins slightly sweet, grainy, earthy, straw. The middle is slightly tart, lemony. Finishes drier, mild spicy bitterness. A lot of things to think about in this one. A world class French Bier de Garde for $4. Life is good."
"Brilliantly clear golden in hue, topped by a creamy, rounded mountainous white head.  Fluffy lace is left.  Dry, bready malt and woodiness upfront in aroma, followed a subtle spicy hop nose.  Trace phenol and peppery alcohol along w/ musty yeast notes round the aroma out.  Mild tartness upfront in flavor yields to a combination of bittersweet alcohol and lingering light caramel malt.  Mid palate dry, cracker - like graininess and understated hop bitterness contrast the light caramel sweetness.  Moderately bodied, w/ a lower carbonation than the norm for style that allows for immediate enjoyment of the smooth mouthfeel.  Minimal outgassing is necessary with this brew.  Finishes w/ light white bread sweetness and mild clove phenol quickly fading, but otherwise is dry and clean. Although quite flavorful, 3 Monts is not particularly complex brew.  This allows it to be deceivingly refreshing, however.  Very enjoyable."
"Corked 750 ml bottle. Clear, golden body with a fluffy bright white head that holds well but eventually drops to a good collar & surface covering and leaves some very good lace. The aroma is earthy and slightly fruity, with a fresh grassy hop note. It's not musty, but it does have some dried straw character. The body is light/medium with a very fine and effervescent carbonation. The flavor is lightly earthy/mineral blend of sweet grainy malt and soft grassy & earthy hop flavor. There are notes of light spice and wood that appear and re-appear throughout the glass. A balancing bitterness is clear just before the finish, which is dryish with a lingering malt note. Refreshing and quite enjoyable. Lots of subtle character keeps it interesting throughout the entire serving."
"Pale, clear gold. Substantial, fluffy white head. Sweet nose of oak vanillin, tangerine peels and clay. There is a fragrant, soft, green quality to the aromatics as well. Think of chewy, spring apple-tree buds. A deep, resonant palate of sweet earthiness introduces tightly stitched layers of fresh sheep's milk butter, lemon peel, liquified granitic minerals, hay and down comforters. Supple and powerful with a sunny, approachable demeanor. Sweet alcohol drives this."
"Intense fresh fruit and clean hop in the nose.  Pale champagne look with lots of bubbles and a white head.  The white head sheen is lasting as is the persistant lace guest that follows as you drink.  This is a rich crafted, high octane golden ale.  The ABV is apparent in the original taste but is mellowed by a complex fruity (peach) and spicy (phenolic-clove) backbone.  The brew improves and softens as it warms.  Do not drink it cold!  The finish has slight hints of bannana.  Complex, bold, smooth and fruity.  It is something to savor."
"Notes: This is a pretty special brew, so complex and is better off pairing with a hearty meal. Grilled kielbasa with sautéed yellow squash and zucchini (butter & 3 Monts) was a perfect match."
"Light yellow, fine/frothy head.  Big estery aroma, some grass and earth notes mixed in.  Lots of banana.  Really exceptional smell.  Vinous flavors, fairly complex and wine-like with other notes of earth and rum-raisin spice.  Complex at the swallow.  Real notes of bittering are notable in the acidic side of the brew.  A little over-carbonated to my tastes, it becomes more pleasant if allowed to sit about 10 minutes.  I'm sure fans of the style love it and I'm making an effort to extend my appreciation as well, but not a favorite.  Hail to beer diversity, however."
"The first sip was shocking. Earthy and bold. This beer had a mustiness about it that, initially, I thought was odd. Add a hop bitterness and low key tang. Each successive draught made it clear that 3 Monts was a complex farmhouse type ale that I was compelled to drink. Like licking a 9 volt battery, unpleasant and exciting at the same time. I will buy 3 Monts again because it tastes good and it's unique. This beer really evokes the small European craft brewery vibe that makes me feel all warm and alive."
"well, i am never dissapointed by this brew, robust, yet subtle at the same time, amazingly round palate, bitter, savoury, a regular in my fridge!!! Original rating (well it was actually a re-rate of a original rating) starts here: i'm growing hopelessly addicted this beer. which probably isn't good for my bank balance. Light gold in colour with little head. Aroma is of oak, malt, wet paint, kerosene and also a vinous smell aswell. Quite a full body, salty, bittter, oaky and vinous flavour. Theres one thing for shore though this beer is awesome, sit back and enjoy....."
