"Lightly hazy dark golden color with a decent sized white head. Bready, cereal grains, earthy lightly funky with hints of fruit and light sugar. Crushable flavorful ale, I'm surprised this isn't rated higher, I could enjoy drinking this all night."

"Poured at Oyster Co in Portland. This is a pleasant surprise as I am a little hung over so a 4 percent beer this morning is just right. An hour from now I will require 7 percent minimum. Normally not a huge farmhouse ale lover,but this was nice. Pours a nice copper color with an Oxbow glass - nice touch. Yeasty floral smell and the taste very much delivers. I like this a lot and still feel good. Since it is only 4 percent, can have two more"

"Poured on-tap at the Thirsty Pig in Portland. Served in a snifter, the beer is a hazy, orange-brown coloring with a frothy, foamy white head. Nose of floral highlights, with a tangy sweet caramel backbone. Flavors of floral and spice all over the palate, light and slightly sour. Biscuit and clove, jasmine and oregano, all very balanced. Very herbal throughout. Light and crisp bodied while you drink, with a tangy sweet and spicy aftertaste. Clean, fruity, farmhouse finish. Very clean and very tasty."

"This is a really nice sessionable saison. It may be a touch darker and maltier than you are used to, but it is still quite enjoyable. It is worth seeking out if you find yourself here in Maine."

"The beer is another tasty oxbow offering, but not my favorite."

"O - Overall pretty nice. Nice malts, some solid farmhouse funk, all solid and subtle. Not too sweet, nicely floral. Super drinkable beer from Oxbow."

"Overall pretty nice. Good malts, nice saison flavors and especially aromas, light farmhouse funk, good yeast additions, although could be just a bit crisper and drier. Decent hops too very drinkable."

"For a 4% beer it's loaded with flavor. Very tasty."

"Cheers!"
"I like the low alcohol. I feel like this might be closer to what the style was actually like way back when so I give them points for that. The murky look kind of adds to the effect. To bad its $6 a pint or I would have several."

"I just came from the Pineland Farms trail running festival and a beer that smells like hay and sunburn fits my mood perfectly. My first Oxbow: so far so good."

"Overall, really quite nice. This combines two of my favorite things -- saison yeast and session beers. Great idea and very well executed."
