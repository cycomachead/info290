"Some of the darker notes and complexities of a sour brown, but super dry finish."

"I love the sweet/sour play, like a sour patch kid. Both came strong without being overwhelming."

"Dark, ruddy reddish pour with minimal head. It pours almost still with what ends up being a thin white rim around the glass of a head. Some mild swirls of stray bubbles at the surface of the beer. Strong sour component to the aroma. Wet wood, cherries, citrus, and tart funk. Some mild yogurt and vanilla. Flavor is tart and funky, like sour ales should be. Lot’s of Vanilla, oak, mild smoke. Notes of tart cherries, sweaty funk, blackberries. As well as some dark fruit. Finishes tart with a rush of bourbon. Slick mouthfeel. Wonderful, wonderful beer."

"Overall, a very nice sour beer. Very easy to drink. I wish this wasn't so hard to find."
"Pours a hazy dark orange-brown with a foamy beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with malt, fruit, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour fruit and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is really tasty but has a much better sour presence in the aroma."

"(O)- I really look forward to when these Grand Reserves come out. Possibly my favorite one to date, however we did have an older regular base Biere de Garde along side this, and we actually all agreed we preferred that over this which was interesting."
""

""

""
""
"Biere de Mars is a great beer, and the Grand Reserve improves it nicely."
""
"Medium body, milder carbonation, dry and sticky on the palate. This definitely takes the regular Jolly Pumpkin beers to another level, with increased nuances of flavor and higher levels of sourness and acidity."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty nice, but a bit lacking in complexity and carbonation compared to other notable soured bieres de garde."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A very unique brew that has complexity written all over it. Justifiably so, given its lengthy aging. Reminiscent of a tawny port, or a fine cognac in all of its complex character. Not to be missed if you are afforded the rare opportunity to try this. I will look forward to future bottlings if they do them again."

"Phenomenal brew from Jolly Pumpkin. Excellent sour. I was sad to look down at my glass and find that it was empty so quickly. I couldn't keep this stuff away from my mouth. It's exceedingly sour and tart, but still to a highly drinkable degree - you won't have to worry about it burning a hole into your stomach. Light funk is a welcomed accompaniment to the complex tart and fruity flavor profile. The vinous and vinegar notes were lovely. I wish this was released more often, but I heard it spends 24 months in barrels... I guess you can't really argue with that."

"For what I expected, BdM GR let me down... I was expecting amazing-ness and it was only mildly great. JP nailed it, but it needs more carbonation and a bigger bottle ;) Overall-4.38"
""
"D - Great complexity, the color alone is one of the most unique I've seen."
"Very enjoyable although the extreme dry sourness may limit drinkability. A small pour was excellent though. Definitely different than the typical JP offering and offering some surprising gueuze characteristics at times."

"330ml bottle. Bottled 2-19-10...A tad bit over 2 year old. Pours an almost-clear, ruby-amber color with a hint of brown. Very minimal white head. Scent is...out of this world! Such a great smelling beer. JP always has a distinct aroma to them...that lovely barnyard funk they specialize in...with just the slightest tart aroma. This is that same scent, but kicked up a notch. A huge amount of oak with some sweet bourbon (I'm not sure if the Grand Reserve edition is aged in bourbon barrels, but I get a hint of it). Sweet cherries and some acidic notes. A bit of spice as well. Very lovely and complex. Taste is just as complex... Sour cherries up front. Followed by lovely wood/oak flavors and some lingering bourbon sweetness. ABV is so well hidden, it's ridiculous. Not as acidic as the nose is, but definitely leaves a sticky feeling on the gums and teeth. Mouthfeel is very dry with a sticky finish. Drinkability is very high. I could sip on this beer all night. Overall, this was such a great experience. It should be a crime to bottle this fantastic beer in such small bottles. This one is meant to be in 750ml and shared amongst friends. Amazing beer."
"Overall: A very nice ""true"" sour. Whereas most JP beers are more funk than sour, you wouldn't think twice about it if somebody blindly poured you this beer and told you it was from Russian River. Tart and complex. This is JP's highest rated beer, and with good reason."
""
""
"O: A great beer. I think I like La Roja Grand Reserve better."
""
""
"The beer pours a beautiful ruby hued, mahogany color. Little to no head. The nose is a mélange of oak, sour cherries and funk. The taste starts out incredibly tart. Sour cherries predominate up front. An intense puckering quality manifests itself mid-palate with oak and wet horse blanket at play in the background. The finish is dry with a sweet, tart aftertaste which lingers. The beer is light bodied with an evervescent level of carbonation that really adds to the experience. Overall this is a great beer. Probably one of the best sours I've had to date. The tart, sweet, funky characteristics flow from one to another flawlessly making for a supremely enjoyable experience. Wish I had a couple of more of these. Recommended."

"Bottle: Poured a dirty cloudy beige color ale with s mall bubbly head with limited retention and not much lacing. Aroma consists of sour and tart notes with light oak notes. Taste is quiet sour with some light oak and light funky yeast notes with a mild acidity level. Body is quite full with low carbonation. I tasted more funk then bourbon to be honest but very enjoyable beer from one of my favourite brewery."

"O - A good sour, bring on the tart."
"Pours a nice dark brownish orange. No real head to speak of. Smells tart. Almost fruitty cherry coming through. Sour and fruity on the tongue. Again I feel like the fruits are reminiscent of cherry but not distinctly. Very nice smooth sourness that melds with the base malts. A bit low on the carbonation but pretty enjoyable"
"Great fruity flavor with plenty of oak, with drying acidic qualities that leave the palate quenched and wanting more. A great American interpretation of the style, something I'm glad to have."
"O- Really impressed with this beer, one of the first Pours I had at the festival. I would say this is the best Jolly Pumpkin beer I’ve had, and it will be hard to top it."
"I want more of the GR here. I will be aging any of these for 2 or 3 years!"
"Beer is not as harsh as it smells. I don't mean to say that it smelled bad but the acetic character on the palate was more subdued than I assumed it would be when I originally smelled the beer. There is definitely an acetic character, but it more brightens the beer than makes it dry or harsh. The beer is sour but not tart on the finish. A little dry on the ending and a lactic creaminess with a nice bouquet of yeast on the midpalate. I am not sure which one I liked better, I think this one suffers from a solvency, but the flavor is better. I'd have it again."
"The beer appears a slightly darker brown than the Biere de Mars, with a bit less head and lace. The aroma is funky, with a strong lactic, acetic presence. It smells similar to Russian River Consecration, which is definitely a good thing. Oak, slight vinegar, tart, Brettanomyces, acetic. Definitely worth a try if you are a fan of funky, sour beers."
"Nice beer overall."
"O - Decent beer, not amazing, but this one is pretty good."
"Poured a clear dark brown color with a minimal frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Moderate to heavy tart citrus, good funk and wood aroma. Medium to full body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy sour flavor with a medium to heavy sweet & sour finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout beer for style."
"o - Overall a really good beer from Jolly Pumpkin beer. If you like their style this is acan't miss. Would like to have it again."
"330ml bottle thanks to Auoracrisis. First off, this beer was fantastic, just wonderful but I am already biased towards the regular biere de mars which we rarely see in Colorado. Dark red with a healthy head at first that died quick. It smelled a lot like the regular version, sour flanders style beer. The taste however had a very pronounced and beautiful oak flavor to it that complemented the beer very well. Sour but full and not so much the lemon flavor I have detected in Biere De Mars. I was actually astonished by how much better it was with the extended oak aging. Fantastic beer."
"HV"
"O - I'm really happy with the one. Great smell, flavor and fantastic mouthfeel. I've had a couple offerings from Jolly Pumpkin and this is by far the best one yet. I'd really like more to age...or just drink right away. A must try."
"Damn. This is by far the best JP beer I have ever had. The flavor and aroma are killer. Good to know Jolly Pumpkin can really make something exceptional."
"O: This is a beer I could drink all day."
"Overall: Pretty darn good if your in the mood for an intensely sour and complex experience... That mood strikes me often."
"Drinkability is good. I enjoyed this a bit more than the Luciérnaga Grand Reserve. The nose is good and the flavor is on par or better than most American Wilds. Definitely worth checking out if you can find a bottle. Wish I had another one in the cellar to see how it develops."
"I quite like this one. Would go great with some grapes and some cheese."
"Pours a hazy deep amber to brown in color with a small light tan head. In the aroma, big sour, nice big tart white grape smells. In the taste, tart white grape, starting sour to a nice yeasty dryness in the end. A smooth and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, tart fruit in the aftertaste. Nice big tartness, mellow body, I love you Jolly Pumpkin."
"Nice beer to explore as you watch a football game. One to take your time with."
"Drinkability - Nonexistent alcohol, clean, crisp, and refreshing. I have another one of these in my cellar and can't wait to try it with a year on it. This is my favorite JP experience yet due to the complexities of this beer I have not found in other JP offerings (yet I still consider them relatively complex so that is saying something). A perfect beer for my 300th review. Cheers all!"
"D: The exchange of oak and funk is interesting, especially for a JP beer. The crescendo of the funk, it's really coming close to edging out the barrel, is amazing."
"Pleasant, but definitely not great."
"D: Cornucopia of flavors; very complex. Drinkable for sure, but definitely a sipper."
"D: Like most of Jolly Pumpkin's beers, this is a good one. I haven't had the regular Biere de Mars, but this has inspired me to pick one up at some point."
"Pours a reddish copper with an off white head and a good amount of lacing as it goes down. Nose is incredibly complex. I get tart green apples, ripe cherries, brown sugar, hints of caramel, a bit of vinegar, and maybe a little bit of lemon. Taste draws all the flavors together quite well and adds a bit of extra funk. Mouthfeel comes from both acetic and lactic sourness. Quite drinkable, although maybe a bit over the top in any relatively large quantity."
"Most jp beers are blah to me but this is something I'd like to have more of."
"Pretty good beer. Not amazing, but good."
"The pour produced two fingers' worth of thick, foamy, creamy yellowish-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-amber with NE-quality clarity and a high level of effervescence. Nose had notes of green apple, cider and cheddar cheese. Mouthfeel was medium with a slightly sour cherry taste, but not so sour as to be off-putting. Finish had a very cherry-like flavor, macerated cherries in liqueur as one person put it or kirsch, another way. Mmm."
"Overall, wow. A stunning example of the style and a stunning beer in general. Really glad I brought this one with me."
"D: Overall, pretty good for the style. I am not well versed in Biere de Gardes, but I enjoyed this one. Thanks guys."
"The beer tastes tart and sour, cherries up front. A long aftertaste is even more sour. Reminds me a little of Red Poppy, which is also excellent. The body is light and dry, it seems just about right. I don't know why a beer always seems so hard to get again, I'm pretty sure it's a special release at the brewery only..."
"The mouthfeel is so smooth, the barrel flavor calms all of the incredibly tart flavors that are originally in this beer. Just an amazing flavor that goes down smooth. Probably the best Jolly Pumpkin beer I have had, and that is saying something special."
"Overall, an exceptional beer for my 100th review. By far my favorite Jolly Pumpkin offering so far."
"D-Another great beer from JP. Perfectly balanced tart and malt. I wish I had more of these. If I had to nit pick, I'd say a hair more carbonation would bring out more of the aroma. But whatever, this is near perfect."
"Man, I haven't revisited Jolly Pumpkin and I forgot how good their stuff was. This is a fantastic oak aged beer and super drinkable."
"Batch 346/348. The beer pours light brown with a white head. The aroma is tart with some lemons, yeast and oak. The flavor is brown sugar, lemon, brett funk and oak. The tartness lingers and makes the beer very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Another great sour from JP. Seems to lack the bourbon presence found in earlier batches, but still an outstanding beer."
"D- Surprisingly easy to drink for how heavy of a beer. I love sour beers and this one has set the bar for me. It might be $13+ a bottle but its the same price of a decent wine. Treat it that way."
"D- This was a very easy and smooth drinker. Sours have this way with me though. I hope to be able to get my hands on this again. And if you want a good sour please do yourself a favor and drink this!"
"At first: not as good in flavor as nose...but still very good! Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and light carbonation. Tartness is mild, vinegar isn't as bitey as anticipated. The fruit/citrus notes are light. The oak aspect is not prominent, but noticable none-the-less. A recomendation if I may...drink at cellar temp. Flavor and sharpness really stand out as the beer warms up."
"I'm enjoying this brew slowly not because it's heavy or hard to drink... but because I'm naturally wanting to enjoy every single flavor in the delectable concoction. It's an amazingly mellow and bright brew with some beautiful flavors. Sour-haters not to worry. There is a slight sour, but a perfect balance. I know I'm not uber-critical of every beer because I try to find the positives in every one. There have only been a couple beers that have been released in the past year or so that have blown me away. This is definitely one of them."
"Cherries, tart red grapes, tannic red wine - there's a lot going on in this one. The barrel character is substantial, lending a big tannic backbone that melds nicely with the vinous qualities. There's a touch of malt in the mid-palate that drops off again near the finish, replaced by tart cherries and raisins. The finish is bready and surprisingly brief - it ends on a clean, slightly lactic note. This is another winner from JP."
"D - Wish I had more than the one bottle. One of the best sours I have ever tried."
"The body is medium and carbonation is low. Overall this beer was nice, but perhaps a little oaky and lacking depth in the flavor profile. Still, worth taking a crack at."
"Overall, one of JP's best. And they're the Daniel San of the beer world, the underdog that kicks the Cobra Kai's ass. Ron and crew, you're the best around, no one's gonna ever keep you down :)"
"Oak apple vanilla infection layers of fruit wood spcey carbonation long finish cherry pear cider like carbonation is bright and vivid and in your face amazing"
"I'm pretty new to hand pulled beers but I was surprised to see this one come out of the cask looking like a glass full of head. Slowly however the murky brown beer crept up the glass until only a medium sized light brown head was left. Looked delicious, even at 11 am after my morning coffee. The smell is dominated by sourness and tart fruit, cherries maybe. The is a red wine vinegar quality and some oak. The aroma indicates this one isn't going to be messing around. Wonderful tasting beer, and I don't even like belgiany sour beers that much. Hugely sour with a tart fruitiness, oak and leather (while I've never actually chewed on leather this is what came to mind). Some pleasant funkiness too. Great sipper. While I can't compare the cask version to the regular the cask had a wonderfully fluffy lightly carbonated mouthfeel, served at a perfect temperature. I imagine this is the right way to enjoy this one. I only had the one because it was a Monday morning, but had it been a Saturday I could have sat at the bar drinking these all day. Great beer and a great quiet subdued release. Really a good morning."
"Bottle sample courtesy, and thanks to MDS. Thanks MIke. Sampled at Tuesday night Jolly Pumpkin bonanza!Cloudy brown/mahogany, with good yeast floaties in bottom, and good lace present. Woodsy aroma with vague plum, whisky, and faint grapes/booze. Tart fruit matched with yeasty brett, and earthy oak, with some booze. Smooth, good tart finish, thick and earthy. Wow, great stuff. Thanks goes out To Ron J, and Mike. D. S"
"I didn't like this as much as the original vintage Luciernaga Grand Reserve, but they are both high up on my list! So far, Jolly Pumpkin is 2 for 2 with me when it comes to the Reserve Series! Top Notch!"
"D - This is probably my favorite Jolly Pumpkin brew. Easy drinking, rich in flavor, with no palate destroying flavors. I wish it released more often, but I suppose you can rush all those months in the barrel. Can't wait to see what the next release brings."
"D: Tasty brew but I'd really like to see more sourness and funk. Very easy to drink."
"D: Good another tasty rare Jolly Pumpkin treat."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, arid and easy to drink with steady carbonation. This is an incredibly drinkable elixir and I wouldn't mind a 750ml bottle of this right now. Really glad to have had the chance to sample this one. Keep it up JP!!"
"D: A very nice sipper that is very enjoyable"
"Great beer, not only tasty, but also extremely characterful and interesting to drink."
"The beer pours a brownish amber color with good head retention and OK lacing. While the beer doesn't look particularly unusual or special, that thought was quickly dispensed once I breathed in the aroma. The nose on this beer is quite distinct, consisting of vanilla, prunes, sour cherry and light funk. Not sure what the regular JP beire de mars is like, but I'm impressed by how dialed down the funk and sour component is on this version. The added vanilla component really helps IMHO, and I found the nose on this beer quite enticing. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose, though they were a bit more muted then I was expecting. Also, the beer was surprisingly dry, with no more then some light sourness on the finish. Otherwise, the beer has some nice vanilla and citrus to it. Not entirely sure that extended barrel aging has benefited this beer all that much, though it was still quite enjoyable to drink. Mouthfeel is fairly light, but with a long, drawn out finish, and drinkability is exceptional. The alcohol is very well disguised, and with the no more then light sour component, this is probably one of the most drinkable beers I've had from JP. Nice stuff."
"The palate has a rather enjoyable blend of lactic sourness, quite clean, with a touch of lemon. The funk is a blend of mildly musty/damp cellar notes with a rotting fruit note, especially on the back-end. There's a rather surprising lack of vinegar here. Very clean lactic sourness, almost yogurt like, especially on the finish. This is to the detriment of the taste, though, as it scrubs off some of the funk. Moderate barrel character (OAK, vanilla and bourbon) on the finish, this is leathery, drying and pretty awesome. Highly recommended. 4.5/4.5/4"
"D- Not too sour that it must be sipped, although I do recommend that it be savored."
"By far the tastiest JP I've tried. The bourbon barrel aging has kicked it up to the next level. Quite vineous and complex. The typical lactic quality found in other JP's has some ramped up acid levels also."
"Huge thanks to TheBlackMallard!"
"Thanks, brewdan, for the opportunity"
"Of all the Jolly Pumpkin Grand Reserves I prefer this one."
"Medium body and carbonation, suits well for the beer. Very acetic, acidic and tannic in the finish, wow!"
"drinkability is ok. the acidity is pretty strong, which definitely takes away from the drinkability. i think if this one dialed back the sour/vinegar component a little to let those other components through it'd really shine. still a tasty and interesting brew."
"Caramel coloured, fairly clear, with a little bit of beige foam that formed a thin collar. Some spotty lacing. The aroma was sort of sharp, tart and vinegar with a bit of alcohol, some funk and earth. Sweetness hit up front but faded fast. Very sour, citric and acetic. Seemed a little thin on malt, but it was certainly there. Light bodied with lowish carbonation, off-dry. This one seemed a bit one dimensional after all the other amazing sours we'd been enjoying. It was quite acidic, but still refreshing and flavourful."
"Pours a crystal clear reddish orange, thin white head forms, settles to a very thin ring and drops a few lace spots on the glass, looks nice. Smell is neat, sherry, cherries, strawberries, very fruity, caramel, sour lemons, sweet maltiness through the middle, yeasty, honey, wacky sweet/sour aroma. Taste is neat too, lemons and vinegar, honey, very sour middle, spicy, funk and saltiness, wood, horse sweat, fruit, pretty crazy flavours going on. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, very sour and funky, pretty cool stuff, mellows out quite a bit over the years. Thanks Russ!"
"Stellar beer all around. Incredibly complex on the nose and palate, I can't do the aroma and flavor justice with words. Kudos to JP on investing in making this beer...27 months in oak is a long time. Too bad this is so rare and this is my only bottle. Thanks again Hans!"
"picked up for me by kkulacki in March and held until now (only because he shared a bottle with me 3 months ago, meaning i wasn't foaming at the mouth to taste it. Can't wait any longer though! Reddish, terra cotta color. Little whitish film of bubbles with a ring around the glass. Smells madly sour, malty, hints of vanilla. Big sour blast, but tempered by the oak, with nice vanilla tones and a creamy malt backbone. Gooseberry, raspberry and tart cherry fruit flavors, as well as lactic acid sourness and a hint of Brett. Oak flavor grows and really complements the tartness. This is a delicious beer. Tremendously smooth and tasty...a real treat. Way to go JP!"
"Ron's wife said it was the sourest beer they've ever produced and I think I'm inclined to agree with them. If you like your sour tastebuds tickled, this has your name written all over it... I'm definitely glad I have a few more of these."
"D- This is an excellent wild ale. It's good to taste one of these from the US thats excellent and not from russian river."
"Pours an amber/orange in color. Only a little bit of froth on top, but that quickly disappears. Smell is funky, oak. Not getting any bourbon in the nose, just the nice vanilla and lots of oak from the barrels. Taste is plenty of sour, with a lot more of the oak settling in on the back end of the taste. I would like just a hint of bourbon, but this is all oak. Easy drinking, not thin or over carbonated. Very good."
"This is very nice, I was really expecting the Bourbon to be too much here, but instead it adds a bit more complexity without being over-bearing. Too soon this beer is gone, a 12oz bottle was just not enough of this one."
"Pours a murky dark amber with a half finger off-white head that quickly dies down to a ring of bubbles. Hardly any lacing left on the sides. Probably the funkiest smelling beer I've put my nose too. Sour dark fruits, some vinegar, and wet oak dominate the smell. A good amount of pepper and spice are detected as well. Taste begins with sour cherries, apple cider, and more oak. The 27 months of aging truly shine in the flavor. Some caramel, vanilla, and maple syrup linger on the tongue with a wet lemon-lime aftertaste. Pretty funky through and through with this one, but I like it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very active carbonation that stings the entire mouth from start to finish. Very complex beer and surprisingly easy to put down. So glad I had the opportunity to try this once in a lifetime beer, thanks again Adam."
"Very limited with only 17 cases produced."
"Overall this was really a great beer. The complexity alone would make this one to sip rather than drink. I already had a high regard for Jolly Pumpkin's beer but Ron has really outdone himself with this one and surpassed the already high standard his brews have set. It's just too bad that this was such a limited release, but I guess that's the price of this level of quality."
"Starts with plenty of acidity and sour fruits. Marmalade on toast comes through, along with smooth oak. Slightly moldy, tart raspberries take over the palate. Some acidic, metallic, citric puckering around the edges. Finish features lingering raspberry tartness, aged balsamic vinegar, and vanilla. Medium-full body with enough prickly carbonation to lift the acidic tartness off the tongue. Wow. I've had most of Ron's released JP beers, and I would say that this is the sourest I've had. Still has great complexity though."
"Originally reviewed November 23, 2006. 12 Oz Bottle. Apple candy aroma, with a touch of apricots mellowed in ale, yet with some peculiar edges of old woman perfume. Some of the alcohol notes are deep and dark, with edges of caramel. Pour of a rich deep caramel, firey in glowing orange, witha thin rim of whitish. Flavor is a somewhat confused melange of bright awakening acidity in apple skin and white grape juice, with caramel syrup dangling with a fast flow of balsamic vinegar, between fading into a mellow fragrant lemon hop smack, yet remaining lightly subdues. Some of the nose-stinging acidity creates some balance. However, the flavor of this beer alights some muddines and subtleness with a little less distinctive qualities, its still a deliciously complete package."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, wild, with the oaky tannins and tartness coming together before the swallow."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a dense 1/2"" beige head over the cloudy red brew. Lacing is heavy and coating. Aroma is fruity and tart. Taste is lightly malty upfront, mildly tart in the middle, with an oaky close. Sounds simple, but it all comes together so nicely... Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent, with the wood perhaps offsetting the sometimes over-the-top tartness. Very nice one here."
"Thank you Tim (trbeer) for the chance to try this rare gem!"
"Perfect mouthfeel with the unique flavors and oddities that all tie together in the end. I could drink this all night. The complexity might be too much for me though after a few. Who knows. This stuff was amazing. The best JP offering I've had so far. Big thanks Matt!"
