3.81,4.4,,,,,,"Huge carbonation hiss as the bottle opens. Pours 90% foam even at a 45 degree angle. Settles as a pale orange hue with very good transparency. Huge foamy off-white head on top. Aroma is of lemons, hints of Bretty funk, some tree fruits, nice toasted caramel malt presence in there as well. Interesting flavors of lemon, coriander, earthy hay, hints of tart fruit, toasted malts. Maybe a touch over carbonated, but the feel is still nice. I like this beer more than I thought I would. Pretty good beer overall, glad I found this in the $3.99 bargin bin.","stephenjmoore","Sep 03, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy of white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings to the glass, with a nice amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, orange zest, pineapple, coriander, pepper, floral, grass, straw, earth, and herbal. Fantastic aromas with nice complexity and balance; there is a lot of brett presence. Taste of lemon, orange zest, pineapple, coriander, bread, toast, floral, grass, straw, earth, pepper, and herbal. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, coriander, bread, toast, floral, straw, grass, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; nice brett flavor complexity; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is highly excellent Biere De Garde! Great balance and complexity of flavors, with nice brett complexity; very smooth and easy to drink. I enjoyed this one a lot; one of the better Biere De Gardes I have had.","superspak","Dec 08, 2012"

It’s a shame that this was pasteurized before packaging, because I think brett conditioning would have done very nice things with the malt body and everything else in this beer. Next time it comes out, I’d really like to try it fresh.","fmccormi","Dec 05, 2012"

The flavor is more pronounced than the nose lets on but not by much, starts with a bready malt character from which the caramel sweetness builds, hints of honey, mildly bitter.

Some mild funk introduces intself before a wave of sweetness comes in from a dose of caramel malt and fruits, some pear, some banana, something citric.

This combined with it's citrus overtones reminds me a lot of Goose Island's Sofie with the same easy drink-ability, a long time favorite of mine.

That character is a bit much as the beer starts to warm up. I would prefer that there be some other wild character in there to back it up...or less Brett...something. As it is, this beer becomes somewhat one-dimensional in the Brett as it warms, so it takes away from the rest of the blend. All this said, this is a very good beer, and the fact that I am scrutinizing to this degree means that it is a quality product. I just doubt that I will be drinking it much as it is a bit out of balance because of the yeast.","SkeeterHawk","Mar 31, 2011"

The nose comprises wheat, grass, lemon zest, and a light farmy funk. The taste brings in more of the same, with proportionately more wheat and greens than before. A pinch of cardamom may or may not be in there as well (we'll never know for sure). The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.

This is easily the tamest wild ale I have ever had. Wondering what spices were used, coriander for sure and I am guessing some cinnamon and allspice, maybe even some cloves.

Also some sweet grainy character in the smell. Honey, graham, some lemon tartness, a smidgeon of bretty funk in the form of phenols, sweet bread, light earthiness.

Smells of all-spice, nutmeg, some clove, Belgian malt, plums. A nice, interesting nose. Flavor is nice too, though maybe over-the-top with spices. Biscuity malt body, as expected from NB. Some toffee and figs. A bit more like a spiced winter warmer than a Biere de Mars, but i guess its a style that's open to some interpretation. Fairly refreshing and not too heavy. medium bodied. Quite good, though nothing all that memorable.","aforbes10","Jun 15, 2009"

The smell of this beer is straight animalistic like sweat dripping off the bristles of a feral hog's back, whew its strong. Piggy, manure aromas, heavy brett and reminds me of Avery 15. A little prickly on the tongue but the taste is pretty refined, lemony but not sour, zesty almost.

Some mildly tart lemon flavor in the taste, a little of the honey sweetness, a clovey smokiness, and grassiness.

There was a floral flavor with a hint of spices and tangerine as well as some peppery notes.

Some reviewers noted too much carbonation - I didn't, maybe it was because my bottle was older (but best before date is still 1.5 months away) but I thought it could have used a little more carbonation to cut through the sweetness.

Not overly puckering, and it has enough sweetness to balance things out. The mouthfeel is nice, with a medium body, nice coating ability, and excellent carbonation.

But I enjoyed this one while sunning myself in my mother-in-law's back yard on a gorgeous 80-degree Tucson afternoon... Anyway. Poured into a cervoise/wine goblet, New Belgium's Biere de Mars is an extremely cloudy golden amber topped with a creamy white fluff. Funky yeast aroma; scents of mown grass and soured apple juice abide. Thicker mouthfeel than I ever could have expected; most of New Belgium's beers that I've tried are at least on some level characteristically crisp and refreshing. The lack of crispness here is not a problem. It's velvety smooth, luxurious, even. The first sip reveals tart barnyard funk flavors which cede to a biscuity malt structure. It then finishes lemony smooth, like a pudding almost. there is also a difficult-to-identify flavor that rides all around the middle of each sip. I imagine it must be some kind of phenol -- tastes kind of like plastic, or soft rubber. This flavor emerges in the burps, as well. Complexity of flavor alone merits a high score here. I can safely say I've never had any beer like this before. It's definitely Belgian, and definitely ""country."" It is not at all reminiscent of other bieres de garde I've sampled. This one is entirely in a class of its own and outstanding at that.","orfeu","Mar 02, 2006"
3.98,9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a slightly hazy orange hue topped by a nice big, white, sticky head that laces nicely. Aroma is unique - light sweet malt, citrus, and a heavy, peaty smokiness. Palate is balanced between subtle, fruity European hops and a light sweet malt character. Spices are a heavy presence, with some orange peel, coriander, and a touch of pepper coming through. Body is substantial and creamy. Finish leaves a strange astringency, almost like Chloraseptic. An interesting take on a nearly-extinct Old World style.","ElGordo","Feb 26, 2006"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Cloudy glazed orange, topped with an eggshell colored head of small bubbles. The head dissipates, leaving a brief collar and minimal lacing. There a few fine carbonation streams. The smell is fruity and filled with orange blossom and lemon coupled with some wheat notes. The taste is wheaty initially with some citrus fruit sweet and tart notes. Finishes tart and of lemon rind, dry and with just a touch of astringency. Fruit rind flavors persist, and leave each swallow wanting for the next. Medium bodied and with a light almost fizzy mouthfeel. This gets a bit tarter as it warms. Complex mix of malts and their yeast make this a tasty treat.","hopsaplenty","Feb 26, 2006"

Its a spring beer, but I think it would be good ice cold in the summer as well. Its a little fruitier than a lot of beers, and I can see how some folks might not care for it.

On the side of salty. Tastes of sour malt, American hops that give a bitter and metalic flavor. Body reveals organic flavors on the side of fresh water clams or oysters; similar in flavor to Orval trapist, but not as melded or complex.

The flavor is dry with coriander and lightly sweet with wheat-accented malt; a touch citrusy and just slightly acidic; yeasty but not overly so; and backed by a sublime bitterness that helps to dry the finish in concert with its lingering spiciness. It works well at almost any time of year, but is particularly nice as a summer and fall beer; and it pairs well with some of the lesser-spiced Thai foods, mushroom-stuffed chicken breast in cream sauce, grilled pork chops, and baked apples.","NeroFiddled","May 14, 2005"

Not too strong of a beer, so its easy to take on.

Yeah, some citrus too, but it feels almost like it's just thrown in there. Average mouthfeel. I have to say, I could drink a few in a row, but there's no compelling reason to.

Lightly malty and well carbonated, very much like a hefe, all-around. Most likely excellent on a hot summer's day, it is still good on a mid-winter's.

Flavor is nicely balanced with robust spices, citrus (lemon) and yeast (perhaps some banana and clove as found in a trippel?). There is a tartness, like that found in a wheat, but this beer has no real grainy wheat flavor. The flavor is incredibly complex and interesting without being so overpowering to keep you from immediately grabbing another. Full-bodied, well-carbonated and refreshing.

The aroma lacks any of the Belgian frutiness from the esters and I think it should have some esters as it seems more like an American Hefe than a Belgian seasonal specialty. The flavor was pretty good with as nice spicy lemony flavor blended in with a dry wheat and malt flavor. Finishes with a yeasty taste that reminds me of drinking green beer. The oats are noticeable in the finish as it has more body than a wheat beer but tha lack in head retention makes it kind of noticeable that care was not taken during the brewing process.

Grapefruit is also noted. Just a hint of hops as a balance. Actually I'm not quite sure what to name all these tastes, this is very different from my usual selections. Mouthfeel is very smooth, a touch too watery. Drinkability is great. I really enjoyed this beer, though I'm not sure what to name all of the flavors I taste.

I've done a lot of experimenting with this beer and with the advice of a New Belgium employee, I tried a pinch of salt in the bottom of my glass.

Flavor is citrusy and slightly tart. Yeast also contributes to a complex flavor. Overall a very interesting and pleasurable ale.","BierReise","Dec 26, 2003"

3.57,-2.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Cloudy orange in color, with huge chunks of yeast dancing about in the carbonation. Aroma starts with a mild hint of lemon, which strengthens considerably as the beer warms. After such a tart odor, I was quite surprised to find how smooth the flavor was. It starts with a slightly sugary maltiness, maintains a solid malt body through the middle and finishes with a dry, lemony pucker. Not a bad beer, but certainly not worth the $6.99 I paid for a 12 oz bottle! Too little going on flavorwise to be memorable.","mzwolinski","Sep 12, 2003"
3.49,-4.4,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer smells pretty good, an interesting light malt and wheatish type of aroma. This brew is kind of an odd-ball, I am not real sure what it wants to be. The wheat and barley are obvious, as well as a lemon presence. The light malt flavor mixes in with a slight hop presence. Some spices kick in towards the end. It leaves a bready type of aftertaste.","BigHead","Sep 08, 2003"

3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This brew is orange in appearance. Original pour resulted in a nice head which dissapated pretty quickly. I do detect a faint smell of oats. I am tasting a hint of spice and oats-very uncommon but a very good change of pace. I am also tasting a very slight taste of alcohol. It has a very smooth feel within my mouth. Overall drinkability of this beer is good-something I would pour for family and friends. It is nice to see that New Belgium is willing to do something different in a good way!","arizcards","Jul 26, 2003"
3.36,-7.9,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Hazy orangey peach color with a lot of yeasties that I conciously tried to keep out and a nice big creamy white head that fades to a thick film with some nice lacing. Very bready malt aromas without much of the expected spicy, zesty citrus aromas that I love in the style. Quick hit of spicy pepperyness with a bit of lemon before the overiding bready malt takes over and brings the beer to its somewhat cloyingly malty finish. Very disappointing for the style and brewery. Refreshingly crisp and medium light in the start the brew seems to grow fuller and more cloying the longer it sits on my tongue. Overall a decent brew but slightly disappointing having sampled several other brews from New Belgium.","Murph","Jun 13, 2003"

3.22,-11.8,5,3,3.5,3,2.5,"Overall: An unusual beer. The bottle describes it as a beer for March, between Winter and Spring. They seem to have wanted to blend a winter celebration beer with a lighter, fruitier Spring beer. The orange color is enough to justify a taste. A clove orange punch meets beer. Would recommend trying it out, but don’t get more than a six-pack, one beer didn’t invite a second.","HardTarget","Apr 21, 2003"

3.44,-5.8,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a fine beer, but its not as intriguing as its ingredient list and fermentation process suggest. I guess it failed to live up to my expectation of a highly unique New Belgium offering. In fact, it tasted very much like a less perfumed version of their eau de toilet flavored Saison. The lemon flavor and the relatively high carbonation suggest that this is probably a very refreshing summer beer. Too bad its only going to be brewed for the early Spring","TXHops","Mar 30, 2003"
3.97,8.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Flows cloudy orange into the mug, producing a thick foamy head. Hops and slight lemon scent create a pleasant mood. Drinks medium bodied with a complicated taste topped with lemon. One sip quickly leads to another with this beer, despite the complexity of its finish - malt, lemon, something anise-like, and of course, clean hop. While some may say it tastes like Sprite - I disagree and recommend this unique beer.","optikon44","Mar 17, 2003"
4.03,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a thick foamy head of pure white. Aroma of yeast and sour zest with an underlying hint of fresh fruit. Initial honey sweet with a lemon zest and brush of sweet melon. The fruitiness of the finish flows through a delicate sourness supported by a thin bubbly body. Light and flavorful if you take the time to really taste all the complexities. I get the distinct feeling of Spring sipping this brew.","beernut7","Mar 13, 2003"

Citrus and spice in the nose, a bit lemony and peppery with sweet and sour malt. Maybe even some cinnamon or ginger. I really like the spice character in there. Very interesting and enjoyable flavor. On one side, you have a big wheaty, grainy malt character, and on the other side, you have citrus and yeast spiciness. Smooth mouthfeel, but with a little carbonation. Quite nice. Light to medium body, but still very flavorful. A great late winter/early spring beer, as it's meant to be. I'm glad I got a 6 pack and not just a single!","hyuga","Mar 03, 2003"

Lots of active carbonation is apparent as tiny bubbles continuously race to the top. Nose is fresh malts, yeast, and lemon. Light to medium in body with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is a touch of sweet malts at first followed by some notes of fresh wheat and yeast. Some citrus hop flavors are present in the end leaving a dry finish. An interesting brew that is both quite refreshing and very tasty.","Morris729","Feb 19, 2003"

4.54,24.4,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"I picked this beer up on a whim. The label doesn't give you a clue how good this beer is. The first taste was an eye-opener. It has the smoothness and drinkability of a good Belgian wheat ale. The smell hints at the wheat base and lemon spicing. The finish has a slight kick unlike a typical wit beer. This beer could just about the best beer I've tasted, right up there with Celis White.","pbnagel","Feb 14, 2003"
3.41,-6.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The clerk at the liquor store told me this brew was similiar to Fat Tire, I'm going to have to disagree. This brew poured a murky orange color with a deep gold around the edges. The head was small but it kept through the whole brew. The nose is of honey, wheat, and citrus. This beer does taste surprisingly like a wheat beer only sweeter, with a strong citrus flavor. The finish is fairly dry but not bad dry. I will purchase this brew again especially this summer as it is very refreshing.","Bruiser81","Feb 09, 2003"
3.8,4.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a cloudy deep amber orange color with a small creamy lasting head, light citrus flowery aroma. Wheat flavors kind of reminds me of lemon cough drops.

3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Tawny-tan-honey hue, hazy with loads of sediment fluttering downward. The head was slightly off-white, moderate size it reached a half finger in height before it faded rather quickly. The subsequent lacing was fair at best. The nose seems a speck too hushed; slight horse blanket aroma topples the yeastiness, sweet like honey, lemon zest, some bubblegum, and vague tartness. The bouquet is inviting. Sweetish first sip but not overbearing, bubblegum follows, the wheat is noticeable, as is the yeast, slightly citrus conclusion. The palate is distinctly Belgian but it is on the simplistic-side, a Belgian with training wheels if you will. Dry finish. Medium body; slightly light mouthfeel without being thin. Very drinkable, it is quite tasty. Worth trying even thought this is not one of NBs best beers.","bditty187","Jan 28, 2003"
4.03,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Excelent beer, not as spicy and complex as most of the belgian ales of this type, but pretty good, expecialy for the price, compared to a lot of American takes. Real interesting floral and citrusy spic character when young that kinda blends in as it ages.  I would love to see a bolder yeast  character for the style, but for what it is, it is just excellent.  Just a good, refreshing, and complex beer.","nathi","Oct 15, 2002"
3.26,-10.7,4,3,3,3,4,"Hazy light orange in color with a thin head.  Yeasty, estery aroma with a honey - like sweetness in the nose as well.  Just a touch of wet  horse - like Brettanomyces is discernible.  It was definitely more horse - like and funky last year.  Sugary, slightly cidery, sweetness dominates initially, and is followed by subtle bubblegum esters.  Hop bitterness and flavor are kept to a minimum.  Carbonation is quite high.  Finishes with a slight bittersweetness on the back of the tongue.  This years release seems dulled as compared to last years.  Much less complex in aroma and flavor.  Still-- this is a unique microbrew that definitely needs to be tried.  I do feel the ""dumbening"" of this beer has actually improved its drinkability, however.","marc77","Mar 21, 2002"
3.93,7.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This is good beer but it didn't really knock my socks off. To style I think it needed to be a little stronger and a little more malty. It had a yeast smell and taste that I didn’t really find agreeable. I don't know how to describe it but the only other time I encountered it was in a homebrew I did with a yeast named Nottingham (I forget the brand name) anyway I didn’t knock points off just because I’m sure it was suppose to be there, it’s just one that I didn’t like.","mattmaples","Feb 08, 2002"

Very much like a Saison, or a biere de garde, with a hint of lemon verbena in the nose and palate.  Nice orangey-gold color with a full white head.  Fruity, full body.  Very, very drinkable.","BKotch","Jan 11, 2002"
