3.7,5.7,4,4,3.5,3,4,"on tap at j. ryans downtown syracuse. the pour is clear amber to cranberry juice in color, with the red hues really glowing. there is only a finger or two of lacey tan head, but it fades out in a few minutes. the nose is really remarkable, entirely unfamiliar. i smell some purple grape juice or must, the essence of fresh cherries, but nothiing sweet at all. theres also a rich caramel malt sweetness and something curious with the yeast as well, mildly but uniquely spiced. the flavors are really fruity up front, again with what seems to be grape being the most obvious. some spice in there as well, it isnt clove or allspice, but has a peculiarly holiday vibe to it. i appreciate this beers strange but comforting flavor profile, much apart from anything ive ever tasted. mouthfeel is a little odd for me. i would like either more body or more bubbles in this beer. without the body, it feels thin and watery, and without the bubbles, it lacks the pep needed to make a thinner beer feel good going down. that is definitely the weakness here. overall though i am so glad i got one of these, because while it is certainly a christmas beer, there is something unlike any other christmas beer about it, and that originality really makes its something to behold.","StonedTrippin","Sep 23, 2012"

3.75,7.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a murky semi-opaque dark iced tea color with a tiny 1/2 tan head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. A few stands of random lace on the drink down. Smells of muted caramel, malt, and some citrus juices. Taste is of caramels, biscuity malt, and some light grapefruit flavors on the finish. There is no bitterness whatsoever with this beer. Very light but lively carbonation. Somewhat sticky and coating in the mouth. Overall, a good holiday offering that is still very tasty months after its release.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 16, 2011"
3.77,7.7,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Interesting beer. Not what I'd usually consider a Christmas beer, I'd actually prefer something like this in the summer, with its zingy citron and lemon notes married to a bit of brown sugar and bitter orange. Whenever, I'd enjoy this. It pours an orangey amber with a fairly short head that fades to a thin cap. The aroma is pure orange juice with a bit of spice at the end. The taste reminds me of an English lemon barley water. A bit soupy with grain, but in a light sort of way and with a nice citrus overlay that is quite refreshing. It starts out lemony, but as it opens up it tastes more of tangerine and orange with hint of spice. Quite nice. Perhaps a tad too light and seltzery in the mouthfeel, but ovarall this is a nice refresher- but not what I'd be looking for in a winter brew.","Georgiabeer","Jan 05, 2011"

Ginger and citrus with a sweet light caramel and a bit of malt. Taste is sweet and orangey. Spiced chai tea with ginger and sugary sweet malt. Light, well carbonated feel is crisp on the tongue. As it warms the the sugary caramel mellows and blends into the malt structure. Dry clean finish. Hops are subdued to say the least. Refreshing and quite drinkable. Like a sweet lager.

3.6,2.9,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Poured a dark copper color, a very thin bubbly head that didn't last long at all. Constant streams of bubbles rose from the bottom. Aroma was very slightly sweet, with earthiness. A touch of malty, with evident alcohol aromas. Taste was very mellow, slightly sweet, small amounts of citrus flavors. Tad of olives and hops flavors. Felt strange in the mouth. Coated well, but left an awkward texture in the mouth. Definitely a beer to sit and sip. Lingering makes it ok to drink, but need to savor.","mountdew1","Jan 02, 2010"

It has a thin and watery crystal malt flavor that does have some light nuttiness in the finish, but overall is dry and boring. It's a bit fruity with some light musty character.

Musty white pepper notes are dominant, with tinges of metallic hop lurking in the background. Flavor is much like the nose. Lots of musty white pepper all the way through with unpleasant metallic hop notes bringing up the rear. Body is light with plenty of carbonation; somewhat acerbic in the finish.

4.08,16.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The drinkability of this was not that high, the orange got to be a little much. I'm not sure if they used artificial flavor or some type of rich orange variety that I'm unfamiliar with, but it was a little syrupy tasting after a while (though not in body) Still, a good experience and nice change of pace for a Noel.

3.63,3.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"So I bought this one with great interest. Very similar to its sister (brother?) beer.

I like this, it's enjoyable, but not as good.","Dukeofearl","Dec 30, 2006"
3.45,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Pours out a pretty copper body with a steady stream of carbonation coming from the center of the chalice. Not much of a head. Starts with a punch of orange juice in the nose with aromas of vanilla, toasted malty bread, and some alcohol. Again, with the flavors, I get a creamsicle like flavor up front which is followed by loads of toasted malt, dried fruit, and a little alcohol. I get noble hops in the finish and a lingering flavor of raisin bread. Too much orange, though. Mouthfeel is moderate to slightly thick and has a soft carbonation made up of tiny bubbles. Tasty beer, but the orange presence can be a bit much to make this something I'd want a lot of. I got tired of the orange real quick.","goochpunch","Dec 26, 2006"
4.13,18,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Taste is balanced and even, orange candy kind of floats in and isn't too sweet or cloying. Nice malty backbone, even mouthfeel.

4.34,24,4,5,4,4,4.5,"Taste is a nice biscuity malt followed by the unusual floral hops. Far less dominant in the flavor the hops. Finishes surprisingly clean with a crisp hoppy finish.

In fact, I think it may have matched the pumpkin pie the best. I was really amazed at the versatility of this beer at the table. I'll definately be picking up another few bottles of this for next year.

3.07,-12.3,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"As the label claims, this is a special biere de garde "ambree" with a "new orange flavor." The citrus is most defined in the bouquet, which has a pleasant orange character. Otherwise this brew pours a light amber and has a light, spritzy body on the tongue. There are fairly pronounced citrus and biscuit flavors too, but they are never quite able to overcome the fizziness of the mouthfeel. It is then, an imbalanced mouthfeel that proved to be this beer's biggest drawback. Drinkability is average, though, I doubt that I would be interested in exploring this brew further to have more than one glass.","benito","May 13, 2006"
2.58,-26.3,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,"Pours a dark reddish color with a quickly disappearing white head. Smell is of orange peel and some spice.

I will hand it bitterness. This beer definitely has some great bitterness both in nose and MF. That part of the orange tastes real.

Anyway, I digress, this one pours almond amber, cloudy, with a tan head, at first puffy, then fading to a 1/8 inch film and leaving plentiful stringy lacing. Aromatic nose of concentrated orange juice and cloves. More orange notes, soft mouthfeel, taste fades in the finish, worth a try, but nothing great, there are better and more interesting christmas brews and saisons out there","Billolick","Beers"

There's no sign of the 6.8% abv. I really enjoy the real orange flavor, but other than that this is just a standard amber ale.

Nose has a hint of chocolate and over ripe black cherries, also a touch of mushrooms, pleasant and appealing with the start sweet and the grain profile adequate with the top light to medium in feel.

Although Shelton Brothers is expected to bring this back to the USA, along with some of Duycks regular offerings, I havent seen the Christmas version of this beer for a long time. I hope this does return, as its probably Duycks best offering, improving upon the already good regular bière de garde. Although only 0.3% stronger, this is a much richer, warming beer, with a great deal more complexity than the standard expression. I dont remember what I paid for this, but I dont think it was much more than the $3.49-$3.99 that the regular 750's sold for.
