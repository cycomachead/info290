"This might be true to style but as I've never had this type of beer before, I can only say, I'm not a huge fan."

"Not quite what I would expect from RR, but this one could have had some age as they are not distributed here. Still one of my favorite breweries."

"this is one of the better beers we had at russian river that isnt already famous. its sort of like a saison in its yeast complexion, but has a lot of body and isnt quite as dry. there is a really neat fruit aspect to this, mango and green grape characteristics that dont come from hops. i suspect a high level of wheat in the grain bill, there is some weight on the palate, but it drinks pretty easy and finishes a little long with a nice grassy hop presence. i wish for more carbonation, it seemed a little flat from the tap. not flat, but not excited either. its a rustic beer with a lot of layers, more complex than perhaps some of the other non sours at russian river. i liked this one a lot, although it seems more suitable for spring than fall."

"O: haven't had many of this style, this beer was a cool combination of old world malt mixed with new world hops with sour character thrown in, reviewed from notes taken on 3/7/14"

"the beer is amber hued with a half inch + of off white head. The aroma brings bread, hops, funk, floral notes, yeast, hops, grass, lemon zest. Nice flavor, following the aroma. Nice blend of earth, hop, floral aspects. A solid beer. Russian River remains one of the best breweries in America."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells better than it tastes in my opinion."

"O: Belgiany, bright and crisp with subtle layers which add complexity. A very refreshing brew and another well crafted and interesting -tion edition ale from RR."

"O: A really fun beer to try! This hit the spot on the 100+ degree afternoon this brew was enjoyed on. Crisp, clean, and refreshing. Too bad it doesn't make it to the bottle much anymore. I'm guessing it's just too expensive and/or maybe wouldn't sell as well as the other RR regulars."

"Another big tick on the Russian River –tion Quest that I started once I started drinking craft beer! I’ve run out of –tion beers to tick here so if you have one I have not ticked, HIT ME UP! Big thanks goes out to BilbosNuts for procuring this growler for me! Shared by myself during BRoss242’s send-off party before he moves! Will miss you man! Served from growler into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured red-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grain, wheat, earth, spice, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, spice, grain, wheat, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I have really enjoyed most of the brews I have had on my –tion Quest and this one was no exception to this trend. It was really well balanced and quite complex for the style which made the growler quite enjoyable for all people in attendance of the tasting. Hope I get to experience the others in the near future. Definitely worth the try if you get the chance!"

"I would maybe knock the overall score up to 4 from another brewer, but Russian River has a few beers that handily destory this one. Still worth a try!"
""
""
"O: I don't like it, but it's not BAD. Not recommended, wouldn't have again."
""
"Solidly in style. It reminds me of some of the classics like 3 Monts. It does end up being a little harsh on the finish, but even that is acceptable for a BdG. That criticism is probably just prejudice on my part."

"T: This wasn't a bad drink at all. Faint lemon seed and biscuity malt flavors with a faint but lingering earthy hop bitterness in the background. Very mild but pretty tasty."
"Overall: Very drinkable and pretty enjoyable. If I'm eternally damned I hope it's for drinking something a little more interesting than this."
""
""
"Not bad at all - but what from RR isn't?"

"cheers"
"Interesting Belgian yeast profile, it is sufficient and does not take over the beer. Good balance of flavors."
"O: An interesting beer for sure, not a style I actively seek but was happy to try. Would recommend this and try it again."
"Nutty malty complexity, some specific walnut flavor, with a light bitterness stemming from a mild hop presence. Malt driven flavors, though hops do play a minor role. Creamy and mild feel, an easygoing session beer that's well put together, and not overdriven by hops. Didn't pick up on any ""wild"" characteristics from the yeast that some others did."
"Cheers!"
"Light body and very carbonated, sweeping the tongue clean with lightly prickly bubbles. Very refreshing."
"cheers"
"Not much head, slight caramel smell and taste. Nice dark orange color. Need to try more from this brewery..."
"The pour was deep amber to copper in color, amber-ish to off-white colored head, big head, lots of carbonation. The aroma was grassy cherries w/ some caramel malts and yeasty character, spicing (coriander) showing up as well. The flavor followed the aroma, a touch of bret and white grapey notes too. Quite flavorful, a darker take on the Belgian ale category, interesting"
"4.0 D: Very tasty beer. Among the best I've had from RR. Solid all around. I wish they'd bottle this again."
"D. Good, but not incredible."
"Pours a nice clear golden yellow. Some clean white head. Smells malty and clean. A bit of dirty grassiness. Tastes sweet and fruity very crisp and clean. The beer leaves a clean tartness on the tongue. I like this quite a bit. Wonderful mouthfeel. Overall a great beer"
"O-good beer. Would like to see what some age does with it"
"A full flavoured and very interesting pale Biere de Garde. Nicely balanced."
"QUITE NICE, WORTH HAVING!"
"Vinnie Cilurzo - one of very few brewers whose name not only warrants being dropped in these reviews but is also one of the few that can be readily recognized by the average craft beer drinker - brews Belgian ales like he was born a Belgian himself (or, in this case, French). Perdition is not a bad beer to be stuck with forever - hell, I wish I had it on hand at all times."
"M - Medium body. Moderate carbonation."
"D - Very drinkable. The sweetness provided from the fruit flavors blend really nicely with the rest of the flavors. There is also a really nice dryness throughout the beer."
"For a brewery well known for its hops and sours, this one seems like a malgamation of everything else besides those two things they are famous for."
"Hugely quaffable and a nice beer to pair with food. Light on the palate, nice and fruity, with just enough yeast notes to provide some contrast. A nice offering."
"Overall, it stood well on its own, but would be fantastic with a meal."
"Thanks so much to schmittymack for pulling this one out of the cellar Friday night. Poured a nice light brown color with a small ecru head. Aromas of yeast, spices, apple skins and caramel malt. Medium bodied, drinkable, slightly musty, with flavors of Belgian yeast, spices and sweet fruit."
"While Perdition isn't a headline grabber like other beers in the -tion series, it is a relaxed beer good for any occasion."
"D: Solid biere de garde, not knowing the style, I thought it was some hybrid of a Belgian dark ale, but I get it now knowing the style. Well done."
"The thing that strikes me is that this beer has a really long finish. This is not the same as a really bitter beer where the bitterness sticks on your pallet. This beer has length and complexity in the same way a well made wine does. A really nice beer to sip and take your time with. The kicker is that this beer was $3.25 during happy hour. Can't beat that."
"Had this on tap at the Russian River brewpub in Santa Rosa. Pours a copper brown colour with thick white head and huge amounts of lacing on the glass. Smells quite spicy (almost like a saison) with lots of Belgian yeast. This is quite balanced with bitternes and the tart yeastiness. Big carbonation level. This was my first Bière de Garde, so 11 styles left to go for me now."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability were great, as are most things RR puts out... it was just lacked something distinct separating it from other saisons that I could say that would truly make this beer exceedingly above avg for the style. I didn't get any particular fruity notes at all, which I saw someone mention in a review, only the typical floral spicy nose of a typical saison from say dupont. Like say, Fuego del Otono had this wonderful chestnut flavor to it that really made it stick out from the others of the style.. was just wishing this had more identity to it."
"D: This was the last of four others I had in one sitting, but could easily drink a few in one sitting no problem."
"Tough to have a lot of this guy, but still enjoyable."
"D - This took me longer to work through than Supplication. It drank like a meal to some extent, and lacked sufficient depth to make me want more."
"This was a good saison. The flavor was fun and unique which keeps it very drinkable."
"D: Highly drinkable and delicious. A very unique and unusual beer in a style of its own."
"D: I'm not always the biggest fan of Biere de Garde (some just seem to be very poorly done), but like most other Russian River beers, I liked this. Nice flavors and yeast notes, solid all around."
"D - Drinkability is very high. Something about Perdition just makes it disappear too quick. I shared a 750 ml bottle but could and would easily tackle one by myself. The nutty flavor really stands out with this particular offering from Russian River. It's not the best I've had from them but still very solid nonetheless."
"jd"
"D: very drinkable bier de garde and made me want more after 5oz's of it. Good offering from RR."
"D - About as easy drinking as it gets. Not exceptionally complex or dynamic, but not every beer need be."
"Russian River Brewing has an interesting creation in Perdition. I'm not madly in love with Biere de Gardes, and I'm still not. This one's okay. Frankly, it's probably my least favorite Russian River beer (that I've tried). It's good, but it's not something I'm head over heels about. There's nothing about it that's very exciting. Maybe I sat on the bottle too long. Good beer nonetheless. Definitely recommended if you have the opportunity."
"Overall, not really what I had expected. A little bit more yeast character or spiciness mightve been nice and alleviated some of the sweetness. I'm glad to have tried it, and though this was clearly well made, there is nothing too distinctive or assertive about it and might be one of my least favorite RR beers to date."
"D - This is classified as a Biere de Garde, but seems to fall into the Belgian pale ale category a bit better. Overall, a very good sessionable ale that I would drink regularly if I had access."
"Dark copper/amber color with a creamy off white head that has low retention and spotty lacing. Spicy, earthy, musty caramel malt aroma with some Belgian yeast. Body is very smooth, medium body, carbonation is on lighter side. Flavor is similar to aroma, and overall is a little sweeter than expected for a Biere de Garde (I guess that's why it's a ""Biere de Sonoma""). Not bad, not exceptional, easy drinking and unique for the style."
"Notes: Decent beer, but not super captivating. When at the brewery, I'd recommend trying one of their much more exceptional beers personally."
"An easy drinker, but a touch sweet and not terribly interesting, so I had no desire to order another glass right away."
"Slightly earthy yet sweet medium body with a buteer silk mouthfeel, very subtle hops and some nice light crisp fruit. Lotsof apple and pear and possibly some grape with a nice maltiness underneath and a spicy slightly dry finish."
"I have this maybe once or twice a year at RR. It is an easy drinking beer that is good for someone trying to delve into various Belgian/French styles. I find the sweetness limits it to one glass, but it is a nice change of pace from IPAs and sours."
"Draught at the brewpub. Amber with a fine white head. Malty caramel, and strong bubble-gum aroma. The flavor is spicy and hoppy with caramel sweetness, bubble-gum, earthy spice, and a bitter finish. Medium-light bodied and smoothly carbonated. The spice and bubble-gum are just a bit too much."
"Drinkability: the best things about this beer is the taste and how drinkable it is. i could drink this all day. I almost wish I didn't share it with my 3 friends"
"Drinkability: A bit to similar to a pale ale for me, a decent beer but not my favorite RR"
"D: Quite drinkable. A very interesting beer--big fan of this one, especially coming from a style I'm not always particularly fond of."
"D-Not really crazy about this one but needless to say it is still a well crafted and good brew.. Simply doesn't have the attributes that I enjoy."
"Try this one if you get a chance. Cheers."
"Drinkability - Pretty high. Was telling myself not to quaff this down which was hard to do. After a long day at LS it is hard to be patient with beers but I'm glad I was. Not my favorite from RR but I'm glad I tried it. I followed this with a PtE and good god I never get sick of that!"
"I downright love this style, which is hard to find but sooo good. This is one of the better!"
"D - Very unique beer from Russian River that is kind of like a Biere de Garde with a funky twist. Lots of intertwining flavors weave together to create a very complex brew."
"Poured a deep red body with a white head. Nose and taste is some dark fruit, sweet malt and caramel in the nose. Medium bodied, great drinkability and sweet. Quite a refreshing ale. Some cherry and raspberry flavours. Some Recommended."
"Thanks to mymrnngjckt for this one. Batch 002, 750ml corked bottle poured into my Duvel tulip. The ale appears a clear amber/light chestnut color with about two fingers of dense light tan foam. The head leaves no lacing to speak of. Aromas and flavors consist of mild malt, slightly spicy, peppery yeast, bitter nuts, fruits such as tart apple, under ripe pear, medium toasted grain. Approaching full bodied for the style with adequate carbonation as well. Great drinkability, especially on a warm humid evening like tonight. I'm raising this tulip up high tonight in honor of BA gbredben. RIP Gary."
"A great spring and summer, early afternoon quaffer. RR has captured the essence of the style and yet made it their own. I can't really find any faults in this beer. It's not too over the top, but it has enough flavors and character to keep it interesting. I love you Russian River!"
"Those RR guys make very good beers, and really craft them. This was certainly not one of my favorites, but it's still very well-made."
"I can't say that I've tried many biere de gardes but this is certainly one of the better ones I've tried to date. Thanks Robert!"
"Overall this is a complex beer and probably the best Biere de Garde I've had, even though technically it's a ""Bier de Sonoma"". Certainly worth a shot."
"Very well executed. Eminently drinkable while being unique and complex enough to keep you interested."
"D: Meh. This didn't stand out. It still may have been too cold, but I thought waiting 30 minutes was reasonable. Anyway, it didn't strike me as a very complicated or appealing flavor profile."
"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a murky, muddy, amber brown with a massive, rocky, creamy beige head that leaves some serious crazy lacing as the beer disappears from my glass. Perdition pours a beautiful beer. The head and lace is some of the best I have ever seen. Many props to Russian River. The aroma is rather blunt. Toasted bread, raisins, pear, apple, and just a bit of Belgian yeast spice. The flavor is much more mellow then the nose would have you think. Nothing is very prevalent. Brown sugar, pear, and a bit of raisin. The flavor is not very complex but it is very satisfying. The mouthfeel is probably the weakest link, in my mind, of this beer. While it looks to be decently malty, is comes across as watery thin. This really surprised and slightly disappointed me. While I do have my issues, I find this to be a good beer and I love seeing breweries, like Russian River, do best...experiment, without care to traditional styles."
"A nice and interesting beer, highly drinkable and a good food match. I would have a few more home if I could."
"D: A nice beer. Good for a few, but probably not much more than that."
"Thank you Grey Lodge for getting this and RR for sending it. Oh yeah and all the intermediates in between."
"Pours a light orange-brown color with a rocky head and nice lacing on the glass. Aromas of toasted malts, pepper-like spiciness, and mild bready yeast. Taste follows suit. Medium-bodied and balanced flavors and fairly easy to drink. A decent beer."
"8/4/5/2/12/3.1"
"Clear amber red color with good retention. Clove, spice, cardamom, chamomille, and other spices. Taste is bready and has much of the same things noticed in the nose. Higher than medium carbonation with light body; dry finish. Very good beer, I could drink tons of this."
"My mouth has been refreshed, rejuvenated and relaxed by sipping upon this rare ale. Surely, my cohort Chris Dotson deserves an evening at the finest nunnery in Christendom for bringing such to me!"
"D - Good, but probably couldn't drink a 750 on my own."
"Drinkability: A really unusual but very drinkable beer"
"This beer is certainly really drinkable. It's extremely mild and fairly well balanced. Not as good as most of the other Russian River stuff I have tried though."
"Medium bodied with subtle carbonation, it has a smooth feel to it. Altogether this is a pretty pleasant beer, which is obviously well crafted and complex. If that slightest touch of solvent wasn't there it would be fantastic."
"D- Overall its pretty smooth and easy to drink"
"D: Not bad but definitely not even close to the best of Russian River's offerings."
"D: Good, will probably get it again."
"Notes: For review 150, I reached in the fridge and this is what I found. I had high expectations and this one pulled through."
"A bit thin. Not my fave from Russian River."
"D: This is ok...although maybe a bit boring (especially for RR). In the end it just tasted like an amber ale with toasted malt. I don't really get any spices or Belgian character at all. Drinkability is high because it's pretty mellow and low in alcohol. Maybe it lost some flavor in the 4 months since I got it (did not mean to let it sit for this long). I remember it being pretty good when I got it at FO, but in the bottle I'm not really that impressed. I would certainly drink this beer if I were in the mood for something mellow...but considering how hard it is to find in SoCal, there are plenty of other options."
"Perdition is a good looking dark golden Belgian with a foamy head. The beer smells earthy and a bit yeasty. It's a pleasant Belgian aroma. The taste is complex and unique in my experience. It's a bit like a sweet farmhouse ale. It's fruity with a lot of earthiness. There are hops but RR has toned down their normal flavors well to allow for a more complex, more Belgian character. It's a very drinkable beer with a smooth feel."
"The taste has lightly stewed fruit with light toasted grain, caramelized fruit, and hints of bread, wine and black pepper. The latter is especially noticeable in the dryish finish. Overall, it's slightly on the dry side, but not too much and it has mild sweetness and stops just short of being bitter. It's smooth but has more bite than Redemption."
"4.5/4/4.5/4/5"
"Overall, a solid beer, again, from RR. Glad I got to try it finally but if I had a range of RR's in front of me there are several that I'd reach for first. Would like to try on tap though."
"A good beer, but somewhat forgettable."
"Tastes phenolic. Smokey mild. Phenols on the top of the mouth are dry in a decent struggle with malt sweet. Light chocolate comes in late. Finish wins out dry, partly due to the fine carbonation cleaning the papillae on the tongue. Md-light and silky, yet leaves the mouth clean of liquid. Flavors hang around in the aftertaste. Decent, but too dry for me."
"Pours a dark brown in color. There are some ruby highlights and a very good amount of head on the pour. Smell is some dark fruit, lots of belgian yeast and then some citrusy hop finish on the end. You get even more of the light citrusy fruit flavor in the taste. I wasn't expecting that at all from the color of the beer. Decent beer, but many more I would take over this."
"Deep amber colored beer with an authentic Belgian foam. Large, fluffy head lasts really well. Dry & Fruity nose, peppery, yeasty, dank and authentic aroma. Spicy hop flavors, with pepper and spice. Herb-like hops, with tea-like flavors. Really nice authentic beer."
"it pours up a darker amber color. the nose is a nice blend of yeasty, herbal, and floral aromas. the taste is malty, dry, chocolatey even. This beer just makes sense. May I have another?"
"Overall this was very interesting and a very solid offering. I thought it was a wonderful addition to their lineup and really just a solid beer all around. I will be looking for this one again for sure!"
"This was phenomenal. Very complex and tasty."
"Pours a stunning deep ruby with a rocky two finger off-white head that falls to a soft layer of bubbles. Sporadic lacing sticks to the sides of the glass with no intentions of letting go. Smell is much more than I was hoping for. Apples, grapes, and pears tickle the nose with an earthy undertone. Some caramel, freshly brewed lemon tea, and sweet honey. Very pleasant aroma, an absolute joy to sniff. Taste begins with more of the previous mentioned earthiness followed by sweet toffee and white grapes. Midway, more sweetness emerges with green apples and apricot followed by caramel and butterscotch. Aftertaste is slightly floral and fairly dry with a hint of cinnamon. The best part of the flavor (to me anyway) is the lack of Belgian yeast on the tongue. Medium body with a chewy and prickly feel from the high carbonation. Could be smoother, but still flows well between the cheeks. Scary thing, this is a borderline session beer to me. If I could get my hands on this on a regular basis it would be a constant in my fridge, perfect year round beer. Why this beer doesn't get more recognition is beyond me. I understand Russian River makes some of the best beers in the country, but this may be one of my favorites by Vinnie (next to Supplication). A permanent 'want' list brew for me."
"1st.... quite excited to try this with a big turnout ... is quite dry yet a bit spunky ... is a delicious brew indeed ... pours a golden somewhat brown colour, with a good head/foam .... has some fun yeast floaties, ..an enjoyable brew that shows great promise on future RR brews..."
"D: Has some tasty qualities: toasted grainy, sweet nuttiness, enough hoppy floralness. I think this one is still fresh enough, but I'd love to have one at its newest. Thanks to Andy for this good Russian River treat!"
"Overall, this was an enjoyable beer that I wish I had more of."
"This beer reminds me of a breezy fall day back in the midwest, where the leaves have all but changed colours. The more of this bottle I sip on, the more I find myself enjoying it. This is exactly what I hope for from a Belgian (style) beer. Decent complexity, not too intense, easy to drink. I just wish I had more..."
"Pours a lightly hazed orange/light brown, some chunkies in there, thin off white head forms, drops some lace spots on the way down, thing collar around the glass. Smell is very fresh and lemony, citrus fruits, tangerine, wheat/bread, bit of spice with some tartness. Taste is honey, some grass, oranges, light tartness, fruit, some toast and wood, spices and sour fruit in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low silky carbonation, I found this one easy drinking in the hot weather. Thanks Jan!"
"A very drinkable Belgian, wo knowswhat to expect from RR but it was easy drinking. Some sourness yes but I've had more sour from them. Spicy saison charcter. Medium brown with a big head and lacey. Great mouthfeel. Balanced malt and bitterness, the spice andthe sour element."
"D: Very drinkable for its weight."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Less intense than the nose suggests (probably a good thing). Fruity, spicy and toasty with an earthy backbone. Medium-bodied. The finish is earthy and dry with mild bitterness. Easy to put down, but not one of RR's more outstanding beers."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter, more refreshing side with lots of fast moving carbonation that rushes across the palate with each sip. A pretty refreshing brew, the only complaint I have is the carbonation gets to be a bit much for me. Overall, another solid, tasty brew from Russian River. I hope to be able to sample this again someday!"
"D: very drinkable like pretty much everything Russian River brews. I was very luck to get some of this and hope to get some more in the near future. Definitely worth a try."
"Decent Biere de Garde overall. Certainly not my favorite RR offering, but a solid effort. Worth a try."
"750ml batch 002 courtesy of KingG, thanks! My bottle was listed as 6.6% ABV on the label This is already a year or so old (according to the RR bottle log) so this should give me a good idea of whether or not to age my other bottle (batch 003). nice, ruby-red and brown mixture with a nice ring of bubbles and a thin white film. It looks good. the first whiff is a metallic, earthy smell that I also picked up from Redemption. Just like Redemption the mineral aroma fades as it warms and leaves behind a very fruity juiciness. It almost like cutting open a lemon or watermelon but not exactly. The funny thing is that while it is not a strong aroma it begs you to take one whiff after another, very cool. The flavor is bready, malty, spicy, some hops I think and maybe citrus. The thing I like about this beer is that the aroma and flavor are very good yet very subtle. It really begs you to think about what you are drinking. There is also an odd flavor that makes me think of authentic Belgians as opposed to craft Belgian-style beers. Maybe it is RR's yeast because Redemption gave me the same feeling. In any case, definitely let this warm up and you will be rewarded."
"drinkability is great. doesn't have the funk or depth of some russian river brews, but it's a solid and very enjoyable beer."
"A slightly reddish cola-brown, with a loose-textured off-white foam that recedes over 2-3 minutes to a thin coating on the surface. The nose is very fresh and zesty: sassafras, clove, tangerine, and nutmeg. Estery belgian yeast flavors, tangy candied citrus within a mellow overall taste profile like nutty banana bread. The taste itself doesn't reveal much bitterness at all, but there's just enough hop edge to make the finish crisp and slightly lingering. The carbonation is fairly low and has a sort of tingly soda-like feel. The body is quite light, which feels somewhat surprising given the malty-spicy range of its aromas and tastes. It seems sacrilegious to say so, since this is really a nice beer, but if Dr. Pepper tasted really really good it might be something like this. They call this ""Biere de Sonoma"" to indicate it's sort of a stylistic experiment, and while I wouldn't yearn to have this every day, like pretty much everything I've tried from Russian River it is an interesting experience and well worth a try."
"D: Glad I picked up a bottle of this."
"D- I like this beer. It is very refreshing with a nice spicy peppery flavor to match well with food. Another RR success!"
"Like the Kool aid guy says ""Oh Yeah!"""
"D: Very drinkable. I was happy to finish the bottle. I could easily put down a few pints in one sitting. I won't go seeking this beer out, but I'd be more than happy to buy it again if I see it on the shelf."
"Copper pour with beige head. Smell is very light. Very light funk, maltiness, and some belgian yeast. Taste is very mild as well with similar lightly fruity maltiness and and some drying dusty and chalky funk in the finish, but lightly so. Not bad, and pretty drinkable."
"I love the irony in choosing a name that means eternal damnation for a beer that is probably on-tap in heaven at this very moment. If it isn't, it should be. Perdition is a masterpiece that deserves to be brewed on a regular basis. Outstanding."
"Finishes with warming alcohol, lingering fruity dryness, and char dust."
"Dry, tannic impression. Subtle herbal and woody flavor with a bit of sugar before the bittering finish."
"Overall: This beer was decent, but not my favorite. I would drink it again, but only if there was not Compunction on tap."
"D: Well, Russian River continues to push the boundaries of what American brewers are brewing. I enjoyed this attempt as well, it's light and refreshing, very tasty and very interesting."
"This is a nice enough beer, if nothing particularly outstanding or special. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it, but there's simply nothing wrong or bad about this beer. Cheers!"
"As usual, RR does a great job of emulating the perfect Belgian mouthfeel. Quite easy to drink."
"The bottom line here is that this beer taste wonderful, but lacks sorely in carbonation. It just didn't have a crisp feel like other biere de gardes or any other pale Belgians for that matter. The flavor actually reminds me of Piraat with a sweet bready malt and herbal and subtle citrus rind hops."
"Drinkability - another home run from Russian River. Their big bottle series has yet to let me down."
"Highly recommended , A+ beer"
"Flavor boasts rich dark fruits, light hops, and a distinct element of freshly cut wood (though not smoky)."
"Cheers!"
"Perditions appearance is stunning. Body is a browned cranberry with rich reddish hues. Deep and inviting. Lace is ample and lasting. Butter colored head. Mildly hazy. Aroma is not particularly exciting, fitting for a biere de garde. There is a light and rather generic fruitiness with hints of pepper. Flavor is kind of a biscuity English Brown meets Belgian fruity yeast with a little spice sort of concoction. Again, not terribly dramatic. Light berry and apple flavors, barely discernable from just a generic fruity yeast flavor along with a touch of biscuit and hint of spice is all I get out of it. Very much a biere de garde, a style I just dont care for. Drinkableyes. IS the body nice? Certainly  light to medium, smooth, balanced, and with great carbonation. Still this is not for me. I would pass it up for the many more interesting RRs in the future."
"Soft and smooth mouthfeel with medium-high carbonation that leaves the clean and refreshed. Balanced and delicious make this highly drinkable. Well worth sacrificing one growler fill of Pliny."
"The taste was excellent, lots of caramel especially towards the end of the glass. Belgian yeastiness was pretty low, almost hard to detect that it was a Belgian style beer. Mouthfeel was pretty good, though maybe tad too prickly with the carbonation, but this beer could be drank all day, absolutely glorious beer."
"Notes: Probably the best Biere de Garde I've yet to get my hands on. My wife brought this back from the brewery and it lost its seal. Straight to the freezer and a half hour later this was near perfection and a great start to a Friday night. Thanks Vinnie."
"This is really the quintessential quaffing brew. I am really enjoying my glass of this brew and I am wishing that I had easy access to this on a regular basis. The stand out for me is how well integrated and layered the flavors are here; nothing screams at you here, but still it is a very interesting brew without taking away from this being such an easy drinking beer fit for a happy afternoon session among friends."

"A fine example of the style. Worth a try, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"I enjoyed a glass of this and my girlfriend had 2. Certainly worth ordering."
"Appeared a rust color with a nice big head that left behind tremendous lacing. Translucent with a thin film covering the surface. Aromas of malt, dark fruit, heavy cream, and burnt wood. The taste was filled with juicy fruit flavors. Quite dry and yet slightly creamy in my mouth. Malt flavors seem to keep the hops in check throughout. Slightly sour finish. I liked this beer and I can see it pairing very nicely with an assortment of spice-filled dishes."
"Drinkability: Overall I found Perdition to hide its alcohol well and have some pleasing fruit-like complexity, along with some yeast-driven sourness which created a nice bready backbone. However, its astringency kept me from wanting to have more than a glass."
" This was my first Biere de Garde. I found it to be similar to other styles I have had in the past. This was quite drinkable and I may need to venture further into the style."
"It poured a copper color with a slight reddish hue and displayed moderate carbonation while retaining a nice head. With smells of a wonderful light hop aroma and a essence of spices. Taste is of gumball, bread, light spices. Not over done could drink this beer all night long."
"Taste: Easy to drink, even though it had some vineous character it was rather light bodied in mouthfeel but still tasted malty. Sounds vague, I know, but bières de garde are a little off the wall like this sometimes, especially this one who totally had a ""west coast"" feel to it. It had a pleasing citrusy finish though. Another winner for RR in my book, taking a hard style to pin down and giving it their own personnal touch."
"D: Overall this beer is very nice. Lots of nice flavors mingling as one."
"I'm a huge fan or Russian River, probably my favorite brewery. Maybe my expectations are to high, I'm not sure. This beer just seemed plain to me. It's well balanced and drinkable, but just doesn't stand out. Very forgettable."
"It's pours a dark copper color, opaque - a small head. Touching the glass, the beer seems a little bit too cold. The aroma is of spice: cinnamon and clove and some mustiness. Toasted malts come through on the palate followed by a strong yeast. It goes well with Father's Office's incredibly delicious sweet potato fries."
"The smell is good. Nice floral hops dominate the nose. Also a sweet barley malt accompanyied by some interesting sugars and spices. The taste is just as good, but the hops are accentuated and produce a nice crisp, dry, and deliciously bitter finish. Very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer for what it is, but I still haven't fed my longing for the Pliny's or one of the sour beers."
"Very smooth, and very easy to drink."
"Mouth: Chocolate, warm breath, cinnamon, candy like flavors, excellent mouthfeel. This is very easy to drink and I wish I could find it in San Francisco."
"The body is more of a light feeling then mid. For style I would have liked more fruitiness and less yeasty aftertaste, but still and enjoyable taste."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Lightweight and foamy, a little too quick to settle and disperse in the mouth. Fortunately later in the tasting, the body improves and with the yeast addition it gets even better. Easy drinking, just not overly interesting."
"The flavor was mostly caramel and malt, the mouthfeel was good due to high carbonation. Strange that the head was thin with so much fizz."
"From my notes on recent trip, poured into a sampling glass, arrived a nice copper color without a head, with bits of lacing here and there. Aroma is matly with grains and a spicy and yeasty presense too. Taste is like aroma, the malts up front and spices right behind, finishes pretty nice. A good beer and one for the growler."
"what a pilgrimage. i can only hope i make it back"
"Overall: I noted that on the Chalkboard behind the Bar at Russian River that this was listed as a Bier de Sonoma. Nice description."
"Drinkability- Tasty for sure and a easy drinker. Still trying to think of a good food pairing for this."
"Another beer I was fortunate enough to try recently at the source in Santa Rosa. It was called a Biere de Gard on their board, a Belgian Pale on this site. To me, it seemed a Saison. Who cares??? Its a damn fine beer. It poured a deep cloudy amber, not much head, champagne carbonation. Fruity nose, pears, green apple. A bit of spice. Deep rich flavor, more pears, spice toffee sweetness. Thick mouth feel. Very drinkable."
"Pours a cherry red body witha pinkish white head, good retention. Some dark fruit, sweet malt and caramel in the nose. Medium bodied, great drinkability and sweet. Quite a refreshing ale. Some cherry and raspberry flavours. Some phenols too. Very well made brew. Recommended."
"In the mouth there's a significant impression of dryness, but nonetheless the beer also feels very bready and, well, chewy. Dry yet chewy? Big biscuit flavor. A yeasty, spicy, hoppy biscuit. The hopping is quite apparent, and works far better than I would have expected. Weird. But satisfying. Oh so satisfying. Bready yet crisp and dry. I wish such wonderful, fresh, Belgian-style session ales were more readily available. Probably my favorite of the 'Tions so far."
"This seems to be RR's version of a Flemish daily single beer. Like Antwerpens Dekoninck or something to that effect. The colour is a kind of mid-orange/amber hue with some darker edges and a nice head of mostly pure white foam. The aromas are spicy Belgian leafy hops, and sweet biscuity candy-like malts. The spiciness of this brew is really nice, and many spices come to mind whilst sipping this great session-themed libation. Taste is doughy, and spicy with some nice hop flavors as well. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and drinkability is very good. A very good Belgian session-styled sipper."
"Silky smooth entry with an earthy maltiness which slowly builds to a crescendo thru the midtaste. The finish is signaled by a subdued hop bite followed by an alternating malt / yeast fade. Aftertaste is spicy sweet with residual sugar left on the lips."
"Drinkability  This is the beer that all the locals were ordering by the pitcher. Its a terrific Belgian session ale that I just couldnt get enough of."
"I had this beer at Pizza Port in Solana Beach. The beer poured a reddish brown with a light head on top. The aroma is a floral and sweet smell. The flavors sinks with sour cherry, wheat, and dry apricot. On the mouth it is a bit thin and light bodied which doesn't seem to match the coarse flavors in the beer. It could be a daily drinker for some because it is full flavored without getting crazy on your tongue."
"The beer pours golden amber with a semi-creamy white head that is moderate in size, a nice sheet of concealing lace seals off the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and a bit spicy, nice yeast presence and the start continues the sweet malt with the top being a bit more than moderate in its feel to the palate. Pertinent acidity, the hops masterful in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a real treat and a great example of the brewers art."
"Overall, this was a nice treat. It's a unique offering for the style."
"Well I guess I just don't have the make up to like Belgian style beer. I really am trying, I want to join the club, get with the program. Russian River is Belgian heaven, out of Belgium. So you Belgian lovers, the worse I make it sound, the more you will love em. This beer poured an attractive copper, tan head lasted and left nice lacing. Nose was the typical of the style, yeasty and fruity. A hodgepodge of flavors assaulted you on this one. Spice, cinnamon, pear, and a hint of banana. It also had a lightly toasted hint to it. Probably a great beer to somebody other than me."
