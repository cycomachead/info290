"Interesting, my first foray into biere de gardes.  I can see the parallels between this and the Belgian saison tradition."
"Not loving this. Slightly tart, and odd. Love the blonde but this is just a little strange."
"Thiriez Amber pours a clean creamy orange  amber with a little haze and a 2” off-white foamy head that quickly dissipates. Caramel and fruity notes dominate the nose augmented by spice and floral notes. Light short cake covered in stone fruit and a trace of caramel dominate the palate with a moderate hop accent on the finish and a touch of tartness for balance. The carbonation is superb with fine soft bubbles that give a luscious mouth feel. It is very smooth and thirst quenching. The body is medium."

"Overall a unique cross between a saison and a Flanders oud bruin. Nice."

"O: This beer tastes unique for a French bière de garde because it's a little sour (but not to the degree of a Jolly Pumpkin beers) and pleasantly adds an interesting twist to the taste. It is quite easy to drink and the bit of sourness also masks some of the grainy malts and earthy yeast."

"A decent farmhouse amber ale, the inherent fruitiness rolling nicely with the friendly yeast jabs, and an agreeable, varying hop bitterness helping keep things interesting. A wee bit complicated, so better if you've the time to sit back and contemplate. Otherwise, it also slips down alarmingly fast, if that's your bag."
"Not interesting enough, just too sweet and a bit off."

"O: A very nice Biere de Garde; perhaps the rich malt is a bit too much for some – I loved it!"
"O/D-For 2 dollars, I do not care how old this beer is. Judging from past reviews, this one held up quite well during its extended stay on the shelf. Very different. Adds a new dimension to my tasting experience."
"D - This bottle went down VERY easy...very enjoyable and thirst quenching. If you haven't tried this farmhouse, it's definitely worth seeking out and trying."
"Pours a very hazy amber with an absolutely massive white fluffy head. Head persists throughout, sticks all over the glass. Aroma is very musty, grassy, and has an apple fruit sweetness. Flavor is similar to the nose; sweet/tart apples, pale mallt sweetness, and finishes with a slight metallic/acidic sourness. Some grassy hops in the finish, but it is muted by the yeast spice/funk character that is associated with a saison. Llight to medium body & well carbonated. Slightly more malt forward than your average saison, but this one is still very refreshing. Drinking really well on this hot, dry day in Boston."
"Overall a very nice BdG. One of the better examples. Seek it out."
"D - Nice and drinkable, especially in lieu of champagne as a meal-starter."
"taste score should be 3.8, and overall drinkability 4.5; numbers are adjusted to reflect this."
"D - moderately easy to drink but not especially enjoyable"
"The bottle went down pretty easily so I gave it better than average marks for drinkability. It's just a little sweet and juicy for more than a couple of pints."
"Taste is of peach, carrot juice, etc. Not very pleasant at least to my taste. Looked like it would be a good beer, but it's not. I'll try something else."
"Tastes of heavy, bready caramel that mellowed out into roasty apricot and fall fruits. Yeasty, somewhat musty, character. Aggressive fizzy carbonation."
"M&D--Both are excellent, although the ABV is a touch high for such an inviting beer. Hey, can't complain. Overall the creamy champagne feel is where it's at--I'm sleeping in the hayloft tonight. Viva la funkay!"
"Drinkability is the tits. Can you ever have enough? No! I want to suck on this all night...and a have some more when I wake up!"
"Pours a cloudy orange that carries a brown touch. Nose is slight antiseptic. Flavor carries the same. A bit wilder than I would have expected really. Slight citrus is there (oranges). But the antiseptic really keeps a constant presence. I have to say that it's really dry too. Feel has a well bodies liquid and the carbonation is slightly lower. It's interesting that this is a biere de garde. It strikes me as fairly wild. Overall this is something worth trying, but you really need to be open to the slight funk that lambics and wild ales bring to be able to fully appreciate this one."
"D- Very good"
"This is decently drinkable beer, though not my favorite. It is nice to see the French can actually do beer well."
"Drinkability: a good beer in the style ""Bière de garde"""
"Drink: Good beer, very drinkable. Pretty unique."
"D-not too high in alcohol but the sweetness does get to you a bit in the end. i was happy to share this one. Still it is one beer and one brewery I would seek out again."
"The taste was a complex malty blend of sugar, toffee, with some raisin and apricot and some peppery spice, along with the faint sourness associated with belgians. The flavor was long-lasting and finished with the pepper and extended with some satisfying hoppiness."
"1 pint 9.4 oz bottle $9.99. The aroma is sweet candy sugar, sweet malts, mild raisin notes, some citrus and spice a soft floral aroma that is very inviting. The body is a bright copper/amber color and supports a massive three fingers thick head that is ivory white, fluffy and lasting. Fore is dry and grainy with toasted breads, mild baked raisin and caramel flavors, honey and sweet malt. Very tasty. The carbonation is biting and gives some crispness to the rounder, lightly sweet base flavor."
"Thiriez Amber isn't a Biere de Garde that I can recommend. I find it interesting that the most delicious and most accomplished version that I've ever had--of what is one of the most Belgian (and French) of all styles of beer--was brewed in Michigan, USA. For the time being at least, Jolly Pumpkin's excellent Oro De Calabaza is the style leader in my eyes."
"The beer poured a hazy copper color with a bubbly tan head. Nice nose, less spice forward than many beers of this style. Its more about the yeast. Just a ton of yeasty bread dough followed by light spice, a little cardamen, some white pepper. There is some dark fruit dates, and a little pomegranate on the finish. Flavor has more of the yeasty quality, I really find that refreshing. More spice than I get on the nose, I think this beer may have a little pepper in it. The heat on the finish feels more like pepper than alcohol, but I could be fooled. Loads of sweet malt come through midway. More of the pomegranate, dark caramel, a little bit of pear. Nice light mouth feel, Good drinkability. The only thing I dont like about this beer was the shower I got when it opened. It was a little too carbonated."
"Overall: I had the distinct pleasure to visit Brasserie Thiriez way back in April 2003 during my annual Easter Belgium trip with Wakefield CAMRA. At that time I wasnt too taken with the range of beers to be perfectly frank and the Amber was my least favorite of all of them when I sampled it at the brew at the Brewery. Even now with some improvements, it still not one of my favorites. Needs to do more to earn its farmhouse moniker, right now, if youve ever seen the Thririez Brewery youll know what I mean when I say, that it is too stainless and clinical and still AAA - An Average Amber, at best. An Amber Alert Thank You to BigHuge for sending this one West, much appreciated."
"So this beer is an orangeish amber color. Dirty white head. And LOTS of it. More than half my glass to begin with. Aroma is lemony, pepper and yeasty. Some hay as well. Herbal hop traits too. Taste is candy like in swetness, but earthy in the hop department. The mouthfeel is quite spritzy and very gaseous. Not impressed."
"This beer is light and refreshing, yet still manages to have a nice heft to it that makes it a bit satiating as well. Refreshing, yet satiating I really how the beer strikes a balance between these two, disparate descriptors. As the beer loses a bit of its spritzy carbonation it begins to become a touch more satiating, but it is still not heavy or chewy. The malt character is quite nice here as well; I really like how the best Farmhouse Saisons can have such a pronounced malt character despite all of the other exotic yeast characters and flavors."
"Large bottle, capped and w/o freshness dating, bottle calls this a ""rustic farmhouse ale", not sure how it lands in the ""American amber/red ale category""?... Pours cloudy, dark amber, with active carbonation and lots of tiny bubbles continueing to stream upwards. Head is light tan, frothy, long lasting and leaving coating and thick lacing. Nose is brightly of citrus peels and some light chocolate. This ia a brightly flavored and tasty brew, notes of vanilla, honey, citrus, chocolate, caramel and toffee,yeasty breadyness, floating under the surface, lovely stuff, complex, smooth and nuanced. Well worth a try, yes they do brew world class beer in France!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, mildly sugary, and balanced."
"750 ml capped bottle. Thanks to dmeadows and OneBoxBIF for this beer I had been searching for!"
"Taste: Excellent presence in my palate, much more malt body than I expected, it finished off chewy with an unripe exotic fruit flavor, like a caramel coated mango. This is my second solid offering from Thiriez, I'll try to seek them out more."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I very much like it. Now is this something I would be in the mood for often? No. It hits the spot today and I would think this would make a great session beer or a great beer with baked fish. I purchased by bottle in Iowa City. Worth a try."
"Drinkability & Notes  One of the more drinkable farmhouse style ales out there, mainly because of its subtle flavor and alcohol on the low side. Amber is a good intro to French/Belgian farmhouse ales for those afraid of funk and unidentifiable flavors, which are sadly two of my favorite things."
"I like this, but to be honest, I don't think that this was the beer I was in the mood for when I drank it. I won't let that affect my scores, though."
"Scented delicately of cinnamon, vanilla, blueberry paste and caramel, this very amber colored liquid produces a mouthful of glazed nuts, chipped concrete and brown bread flavors. Very clean, yet unmistakable as a farmhouse ale. Tangy, bruised peach and nectarine fruits toy lazily with mildly astingent earth and nutshell flavors. There is nothing aggressive or gaudy about it, just serene, shy farmhouse ale prettiness. Drink it with boullion and boiled leeks."
"Unclear, amber, with some carbonation seen rising up through it. No real head at all, just a bit of white dusting and some dusting gathered in a ring.	Amazing aroma! Fresh tobacco, maybe styrian hops? Nicely hoppy scents, slightly skunky, but good. Smooth feel, low carbonation, you just barely notice it, but by no means flat. Nice hoppiness, caramelly malts, bit herbal. Catching scents of chocolate towards the end... sweet, milk chocolate, but there is no flavor of chcocolate. Very good, very drinkable, very freakin special."
"It started as a jeyser, I probably lost half of the bottle. My floor smells like beer now... By the time I had tried to clean it a bit, there was still a very silky head on the glittering orange ruby color body. Smell is nice and intriguing: some dark malts combined with a sweet and citric fruity aspect, hints of chocolate, and a grassy and woody hoppiness, quite sharp and fresh. Some pilsner-malt graininess in the taste, sweet and dry. Citrus, wood and light hints of chocolate combine to give the brew thickness and solidity, and the result is a very good mouthfeel: dense, full, round and smooth. I didn't like the aftertaste that much though, grassy and citric, slightly mouth puckering. Quite weird for an amber beer. I wouldn't imbibe my floor with that again."
