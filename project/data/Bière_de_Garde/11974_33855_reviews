"Not a style I usually enjoy, & I’m enjoying it even more due to that fact. A very good beer."

"Speaking of times, this is good times. A pleasant bottle to share with friends and also inspires a food/cheese pairing. Good times, good times."

"O. Go get this. Worth the price of admission. I think this crushes it's ultimate predecessor - Petrus. It's so smooth and refreshing. Wonderful for a summer day. The abv is a little surprising at 7.5. It comes across as less. I'm not sure the precise relationship between JP and Leelanu but they have a very similar yeast profile. Gots to love the Dexter microbes."

"Overall, very good. I was expecting a mild sourness, but it is actually quite potent. It works well."

"From the bottle at Meridian Pint. Pours a slightly-hazy light peach color. Nose is light funk, wheat, and heavy stone fruit. Reminiscent of fruity batches of Fantôme Saison. Fruity and tart with a bit of body. Really exceptional and super smooth for 7.5%. An amazing beer that I was absolutely stunned by."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/29/2011. Fast gusher upon opening as expected, but didn’t lose any. Pours very cloudy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy bright white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming off the sediment. Aromas of huge tart lemon, peach, sour apple, pear, apricot, pineapple, pepper, clove, oak, hay, straw, funk, and earthy spiciness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity, spicy, and funk notes. Taste of big peach, tart lemon, sour apple, pineapple, pear, apricot, clove, pepper, hay, straw, oak, funk, light leather, and earthy spiciness. Moderate tart acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon, peach, pear, sour apple, pineapple, apricot, clove, pepper, hay, straw, oak, light leather, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of tart fruity, spicy, and funk flavors; with nearly zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, acidic, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged wild golden ale. Huge complexity and balance of tart fruity, spicy, and funk notes; and very smooth to sip on. A highly fantastic offering. As the carbonation died out because of the gusher, it became slightly harder to drink; but with full carbonation this was absolutely insane."

"A great surprise, something I have passed over a lot but glad I got to try."

"Poured from the bottle into a goblet, a cloudy, golden yellow with a fluffy white head that receded to a wispy layer; minimal lacing. Aroma of earth and barnyard funk, notes of grains and light fruits. Taste follows the aroma, with flavors of grass and funk, woody, grainy, light fruits and distant peppery spice. Light-medium mouthfeel, a little stale in the aftertaste, but nothing offensive. Nice overall."

"It pours a light bodied very cloudy, almost Belgian wit gold in color with a soapy one finger head. The nose is phenomenal. It is slightly tart with a white orchard fruit type subtle sweetness. There is just a soft touch of butter. The flavors are both sweet and tart. It has some pear and white apple characteristics and finishes with a good amount of brett. It's just a really well balanced sour. It drinks a about medium in body with adequate carbonation. Overall this is a really nice and easy drinking sour. I love the fruit characteristics with the right amount of tartness. This is a really nice beer."
"Nice beer very refreshing and I need to have more."
"Overall, nice barrel treatment. This shows how you can integrate a biere de garde with a barrel to create a very tasty brew. I just wish i was a millionaire so I could buy cases upon cases. Well, I guess i can dream."

"D - 4.5"
"O- An easy drinker and a great beer. As Biere de Gardes go, it's not as malty as most. It's been a while, but I want to compare it to Les Bière Des Sans Culottes. It's nearing something of a Saison. I had an initial concern with the sticker shock creating disappointment, but all was relieved. At $13.50 for a 750ml, it would be more of a special occasion beer than every day drinker. It was great on an unseasonably warm January afternoon (blue skies and temps somewhere around 40). It could be a nice summer treat on the deck with the grill fired up."
"Bottle. Not cheap at about $18/bottle. Pours a slightly hazed light golden color with a slight white head. Some lacing. Nice nose, lemon zest and some caramel. Medium/light mouthfeel. Lemon and pineapple off the bat. Some oaky notes in the back end. lingering Chardonnay like flavor. Decent but not sure if it is worth the cost."

"Good carbonation, controllable gushing, nice funkiness, I liked this beer quite a bit. Another great one from Jeffries."
"Overall. A fun beer -- to be shared amongst friends after a hot day. Very refreshing, fun. Different taste, which was a nice break from the complex and heavy beers I have recently been discovering. Thank you Leelanau Brewing Company -- keep up the great work!"
""
"Overall: This is an enjoyable brew and I would be interested to try their other offerings. This is big enough to keep me interested, but light enough to be refreshing in the summer."
"O- a very enjoyable beer from a very under appreciated brewery. id like to grab some more of these to see how they age."
"Overall. Very nice beer. Perfect amount of sour - any more and it'd be difficult to drink."
"Overall- A great Summer beer. I have had this beer many times. I don't believe I caught this one in it's prime, but still showing really good for 3-4 years old."
"First sip is nice and clean. The sour nature is also a little less than other sour beers that are on the market. Still, combined with the excellent body and drinkability of the ale, I can't find any reason not to fall in love with it."
"It's a nice brew, very interesting, but nothing extraordinary."
"Drinkability: This is the first Biere de Garde I have enjoyed, and I attribute it to good brewing and microbes. I would definitely drink this again."
"Excellent beer. Highly drinkable, slightly too easy to enjoy. The alcohol is masterfully disguised, I would not guess that this was 7.5%. The price point is very nice compared to similar beers though a bit higher than I will pay on an average day. I will revisit this one from time to time, too good not to."
"Bomber from Champagne Cellars. More of a wild ale than a bierede Garde as the spicyness was muted. The aourness fortunately was udner great control and accompanied food nicely. taste grew on me. Bottled in August of this year, it would be interesting to try after some cellaring. Good amount of head and a lace lines."
"On tap at the MBGSF. Pours blonde with a good head and good lace. The aroma is earthy, fruity, and funky with some distinct lemon peel and some hay. The flavor is nicely dry and earthy and slightly but nicely sour. The beer reminds me a good bit of Champagne."
"Batch dated 8-12-10. Picked up a bottle at Jolly Pumpkin's Ann Arbor location. Clear golden pour, with a fine white head. The nose is sour, barnyard funkiness. Flavor is very sour, barnyard, wheat, lemongrass, pineapple. I've been looking for a bottle of this since reading the New York Times review of best Belgian-style beers and saw it listed. I really enjoy Jolly Pumpkin's beers, and this one, brewed for Leelanau, is no exception."
"Drinkability:This is quite an interesting sour beer."
"Very easy to drink with its satisfying full mouthfeel and complexity, while not overpowering you with its alchohol."
"Drinkability - Extremely so. I know this brewery is somehow related or deals with Jolly Pumpkin, hence my picking up the three beers they offer. This beer, to be honest, is less funky than I was expecting (in comparison to say the Bière De Mars from JP). However, this adds to its drinkability. There is zero showing of alcohol and I am restraining myself from quaffing this fine brew. I can't wait to try the other two offerings from Leelanau Brewing Company."
"Shocking straw golden color. Verging on Sunkist. How's that for a technical term? Great refreshing tartness, but has a sweet citrus side that reminds me of ripe grapefruit. If you are a fan of extreme beers or big, in your face fruit flavors, it's worth tracking this beer down. I would argue it's better than Jolly Pumpkin and I wish it had wider distribution (i.e. Massachusetts, please). Mouthfeel was fine. Like I said it seemed to have some residual sugar which definitely gave it some body. Drinkability? 22 oz. was gone. Rapidly."
"The nose is of earthy hops, prominent oak, a little wet leather with a light sweetness and a subtle citrus. The taste exhibits a light tartness and a subtle sweetness that dries out with the arrival of oak midpalate. Wet leather Brett is noticeable and lemon makes up the bulk of the fruit attribute. There's a touch of acidity in the end."
"Reviewed on 10/25/2009. Bottle. Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma of funky barnyard, sour candies. Flavor is tart/sour/funky in the initial sips with sweet sour candies in the finish. Some dry, lemony hops as well. Quite tart and acidic. Biere de Garde? This was a sour ale all the way..."
"D: very, especially on a summer day (if other versions are just as funky)"
"This is a better brew than my feeble review can come across... but this is interesting and I am damn glad I have a good guy across town who lets me try... Thanks Eric."
"Very fizzy and a bit aggressive on the tongue, not as smooth as the other two Leelanaus before but still very decent for the style. Probably the best deal out of the 3 Leelanau beers, only $13 or so for a 750ml of this, pretty good stuff."
"D-Tart and dry with a pleasant, not overpowering, sourness. This is a very nicely done brew with champagne qualities. I would gladly seek this out again."
"D - This is about as good as it gets for me. I can't even begin to describe how wonderful of a brew this is.This brew is a boon to the esoteric beer drinker - its complexity is so enchanting and beguiling, and every sip is unique. I love to pair beer with food, but this brew is too good to drink with any food - just put on some good music, sit back, enjoy every sip, and enjoy life."
"This is my first time trying any of Leelanau's beers. Not sure why I havan't picked up any of there beers off the shelf in the past but here it goes. Pours a bright golden color with a two finger fizzy white head that fizzles down much smaller in size and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of wheat and big citrus flavors. The taste is extremely tart followed by oak flavors, apple, grapefruit and lemon flavors. The mouthfeel is high in carbonation and right on target for the style. Drinkability is high, goes down easy. I could drink this one all night."
"This is probably my favorite beer that I've stumbled upon over the past few years. Had this several times at the Spuyten Duyvil on a trip to New York last summer, and luckily got another chance thanks to a trade w/ vrazionale. Shared on the stoop with the Lady at the end of a long hot day. Pours a beautiful vibrant golden, almost florescent looking, slightly hazed, healthy two-finger head receding slowly into a creamy covering layer. The nose is full of oak and funky citrus zest. Lemon-lime, sour apple, orange zest and a nice woodsyness. Reminiscent of the finest gueuze Belgium has to offer. First sip is like stepping into the past. Maybe that's because I'm reminded of the good times I had when last drinking this beer, but it also has that old world, rustic farmhouse vibe to it. Initially tart, giving way to loads of complexities. Funky bugs, musty, earthy, dusty, spicy, slightly floral and a subtle herbal hop profile and passive pale malt. And then lots of citrus. Familiar lemon rind but also a deeper juicyness to it. I'm getting notes of fresh squeezed OJ here. Pineapple maybe. As it warms I'm almost reminded of Gatorade. An artificial flavor indeed, which amazes as this beer is of course all natural. Despite a lot of acidity and a wrenching, dry finish, this beer is somehow extremely refreshing. Truly an artisan product. Will search this one out on my travels again and again... Supple and delicious."
"Drinkability is pretty pour a complex sour and wild ale I enjoy, but this one is tasting acrid and overdone with the acidity and oak barrel notes. Creating an experience that I would not like to relive anytime soon, I love all of the beers from Jolly Pumpkin and Ron Jefferies however this one did miss the mark for me. I still blame the green bottles."
"This was contract brewed at Jolly Pumpkin and I'd have to say it may be my favorite of all their brews. A good clean, crisp beer with a simple malt base that lets the critters do their thing. A wonderful showcase for the brett dosed barrels."
"This was the first that I had heard of this beer or the brewer and was most surprised. A Golden Ale jazzed up with some yeasties and oak-aging, this kept the funky feel to a tasty but not overdone minimun and stayed relatively quaffable. Thanks again for the chance at this Joe!"
"D - I found this to be a very good golden ale with a pleasant sour character, courtesy of the oak aging. This was my first experience with this brewery, and overall I was impressed."
"Thick white head on pour that dropped to nothing within a minute. Fast carbonation flowing up through a golden transparent body. Smell is gueze like, sour, tart, just like the taste. Wow, I wasn't expecting this when I got it or opened it. Tasty. Mouth fill is good, drinkabilty is good. I like this brew. Great to have an American craft brewery that produces a great sour like this."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with fairly strong carbonation."
"Pours a pretty hazy golden yellow hue with a quite one finger bright white head that dies down to a paper thin layer which lasts throughout. Just about nothing in terms of webbing. Aroma is pretty grassy with lemon, corn, and wheat. Tart Granny Smith apples and some pear in the nose as well. Taste has the before mentioned sour fruits with some grains and crips hay. Popcorn, oak, vanilla, and a touch of vinegar midway with a puckering lemongrass aftertaste. Light and refreshing body with a crazy crisp feel from the extremely active carbonation. The overall mouthfeel of this beer really leaves you begging for more, very champagne-esque. For how big of a bottle this was, and the very undetectable 7.5%, I had no problem finishing this bad boy myself. This beer was quite the surprise, I'd love to see what a few years would do to this beauty. Thanks Joe!!"
"This is a very enjoyable brew, I wouldn't really characterize it as a Bier de Garde, but many of Jolly Pumpkin's style designations are by inspiration only anyway. Still this is quite a tasty brew, one which I am happily quaffing. This doesn't seem to have anything beyond a normal Belgian yeast strain funkiness to it (despite the notes in the nose), though it is certainly a characterful strain at the very least."
"Pretty damn tasty on a hot summer's eve."
"Pours clear, golden, sunshine amber with just a light, three-quarters ring of foam. Some faint lacing and pretty good bubbling. The aroma has a note of malt vinegar with some very tart bananas. The taste is a toasty champagne with some aged orange peel and granny smith apples. Pretty tart palate with some mixed tart fruits. Almost malt vinegary."
"Although at $12.49, it seemed a tad inflated for what it is. If this is really going for $20 at Bierkraft, i've got a bridge to sell you."
"Drinkability: A little overboard on the sourness, but a very nice first effort"
"Mouthfeel has the right feel, oak vanilla comes through. Have some more, maybe? Nice."
"Overall: Excellent beer, but I can't help but feel that it's quite a bit overcarbonated."
"Pours a foggy straw with a thin off white head. Nose is a good level of funky that carries an almost lambic kind of nose at first. Slight fruit tone. Dies off to a more earthy and subdued woody character. Flavor brings a severe complexity. The first thing I think is cheese (most specifically brie). Why bother picking up half a pound at the Bedford Cheese Shop when you can get it here. Actually. It just makes me want to take a bite out of some hunk of cheesy goodness. Great thinner mild fruit tones. Body is very nice. Smooth carbonation on a consistent liquid body. Extremely drinkable. I don't usually like this style, but this is good. Definitely unique. The most memorable beer I have had in quite some time."
"The first thought that came to mind when drinking was Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales. And Belgium. Real nice stuff. I've been really getting into the Open Fermentation style lately. Those wild yeasts are so lively :) With the whole oak barrel aged thing, I wondered if the barrels previously held white wine, as that is what it reminded me most of, beyond dang good beer!"
"Good Harbor Golden Ale is a wonderful creation that can hold its head high in the company of all but the very best Belgian and French bieres de garde. It's tailor-made to be enjoyed on a bright summer day, under a shade tree, with a ploughman's lunch and someone special. Someone who also appreciates good beer."
"The mouthfeel is very nicely carbonated and goes down easy. I stumbled across this one, and didnt quite know what to expect, but I'm glad I found it. This is really something worth trying, I wouldnt suggest letting it pass you by."
"Tart, acidic fruits up front. Hay and faint tropical fruit sweetness follow with a near-biscuity malt backbone. Citrus sorbet explodes into the tartish, dry, bitterish, refreshing finish. Medium body with a soft, smooth feel underneath rolling, bottle-conditioned carbonation. Very drinkable and damn good! I'm excited for this brewery and wish them luck on their forthcoming facility. In the meantime, you can't go wrong with having Ron at JP helping out!"
"The energy and substance of this beer is revealed by a rising column of foam from the neck of a freshly opened bottle. It pours very pale and clear yellow. Aromas of marsh grass and moldy lemon peels. A dry herbal attack of lemon and grapefruit is supported by slick, muscular texture. Very tart. Bitter finish. Bubblegum powder stitches chipped basement rocks to yellow leather flavors. Begs to be served with grassy alpine cheeses, kraut and organ meats."
"Overall impression: A light, refreshing, funky French-style ale. Not my cup of tea but well done. Drinkability suffers a bit for me due to the sourness. Not overdone but 12 oz would go along way for me let alone 750 mL's."
"D- The beer is quite refreshing and would live up to it's purpose according to the bottle of ""drinking on the beach"". The complexity and the sourness keeps you begging for more. All together a great beer to quench my thirst today."
"I didn't know what to expect from this brew as it was my first biere de garde and this is only its second review, but I was really impressed. I can't imagine a much better example of the style. Amazing beer, especially for such a small brewery I'd never heard of before. Definitely worth seeking out this Leelanau offering."
"The mouth is spritzy and tart yet in no way light. A very complex and flavorful beer that makes you want more and the abv allows for indulgence."
