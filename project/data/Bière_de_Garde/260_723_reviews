"Not a big fan of reds but I can definitely where this one holds its ground. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a clear orange tinged dark red, two fingers thick of cream colored and very dense creamy head. Settles slowly to a half inch, thick sheet of lace to the end of the glass. Smell: lots of caramel, notes of cherry, dates and peach; toasted honey wheat bread, sourish bread note, subdued spicy hopping. Taste: date bread, caramel, stale grain... then a weird tonic water flavor...then herbal, caramel and toast in the finish. Aggressive, too high carbonation, sticky finish. Mid-sip the carb ruins it, but otherwise it would be quite good."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, 1320 bottle coding. Pours very hazy/cloudy reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, apricot, cherry, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance an complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, apricot, cherry, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. A fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, cherry, apricot, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Biere de Garde style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Appearance 3.5, Aroma 3.25, Flavor 3.25, Palate 3.5, Overall 3.375"

"Apple wine and grassy malt ideas. Not my favorite concoction but clearly a quality brew if you like these flavors."

"Dark unfiltered amber with white head. Delectable fruity aroma of apricot, pear and apple. The taste is slightly sweet, yeasty with a tart cherry finish. Very easy, smooth drinking. Sort of like a cross between a saison and a Belgian pale ale, it was very enjoyable. Thankfully, on draft at Capone's so I didn't have to travel to France."
""

"Overall: Very very good, quite complex and interesting. My first Bière de Garde (or any French beer for that matter), and if this beer is in any way representative of the style, it's going to quickly become one of my favourite varieties."
"Overall: I expected to be wowed by this, but it's pretty decent as opposed to transcendent. I'm not super familiar with the style, but this seems like a workmanlike example of it."

"O-interesting beer, enjoyed drinking it, but don't feel I would seek it out"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:though it is a little on the sweet side the bier has a nice medium body for a farmhouse style ale. leaves a nice spice/bitterness on finish."
""
""
""
"O - Good brew!"
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer and at 8.5% alcohol I really have no idea where they're putting it. This is a good and filling beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bold and assertive beer. Although a malty brew it did not neglected hops, still they are the supporting actor here. Good beer for temperature decreases."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A little on the pricey side but when factoring what you are getting but I personally am not disappointed. A little bit of everything here, enjoy and drink up. Salud!"
""
"This was a really enjoyable beer. It is pretty light-feeling despite the fact that it is pretty stout. The beautiful head is the best part in my opinion, but on the whole it is quite delicious. Would definitely drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste did remind me of a red because if the unique bitter malty/hop character and there was a kind of butterscotch feel to it. It wasn't a bad beer but it is not something I would go for regularly."
"overall: not a bad beer. I'd drink it again, but not for $12 a pour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice beer. Complex but very drinkable. Worth finding."
"A beer redolent of the French countryside? You bet, unequivocally. The best part, however, is the relative lack of yeasty offsets, which usually seem to bleed over for this style, yet do us the favour of forgoing that altogether here, leaving us with a pale malty, kind of obscured boozy beau of a bevy, if you'll excuse my French."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was really expecting something different from this brewery; this is not a bad beer, but it is very sweet and that aspect overwhelms the other things that could otherwise make this a more interesting beer"
"overall, not bad. i understand the pride that goes into making (most) a product and i enjoy all the different styles for what they are. this is a good beer."
""
""
"O - Not really sure what this is supposed to taste like. Kind of skunky and weird."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste seemed more 'yeasty' than the smell would indicate: again it was a mixture of flavours (like the nose), the alcohol playing its part too. Originally on the sweet side, but the hops kicked in mid-sip and the finish was boardering on bitter. Interesting and well worth finding, yet another French beer I've enjoyed."
""
""
"Dark golden raisins, chocolate, almonds, and roasted meat are all delicious pairings. This is a complex and intriguing brew. I intend to pick up another bottle of it in the morning."
"Pours a slightly hazy, orange/copper color. One inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight pale malt, hint of caramel malt, hint of hop, hint of wheat, hint of yeast, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of a Biere de Garde. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. Tastes of wheat, slight pale malt, sweet malt, hop, alcohol, hint of yeast, and a slight hint of metallic flavors. Overall, except for the metallic notes, a good appearance, body, and blend. Also, this was a more malty Biere de Garde than I've become accustomed to, but still good."
"O: Decent Bière de Garde, not the best in my opinion though."
""
""
""
"This is a fine, relaxing beer that warms well while reading. A nice tribute to exuberant youth and freedom lost."
""
""
"O - Quite boozy but an enjoyable biere de garde nonetheless."
""
"Overall, a tasty, flavorful Bière de Garde. A little heavy and malty for my taste but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Being my first Biere de Garde, I was quite surprised at the flavor profile and am definitely interested in having another."
""
""
"Overall, I was a little disappointed as this one was a bit pricey and almost didn't get it. Not bad tasting but rather very lacking in taste especially compared to other recent Biere de Garde's I've had. New to Texas. Rotation - one and done due to high price and not much flavor [N;N]"
""
"An enjoyable beer. Maybe a bit too much carbonation."
""
"O: this is almost like the red ale of farmhouse ales - a delight for a summer's day on the farm, but with some depth and heart"
""
""
"Overall, it's approachable but not overly enticing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tons of white head (almost half the glass at times) and a clear amber body. Notes of pepper, and a light esters with a deeper sweetened malt backbone. Not bad, though I was expecting a bit more in terms of dryness, pepper and esters to be at the forefront without such a malty brew. Glad I tried it though I am not sure I would go get it again..."
""
""
"Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a clear reddish orange amber with active carbonation. Very nice fine, two finger off-white head constantly renewed by carbonation. High retention and finally left massive lacing. Aroma is sour light fruit, cherry and apple with a faint sweet malt. Taste is quite different, light fruit; apples, pears and stone fruit. Slightly tart, but with a sweet caramel malt backbone. Very interesting. Finishes rather abruptly with crisp, slighlty oxidized fruit and sweet, slightly toasty malt. A slight hop kick in the finish. Light bodied, but active carbonation gives a pleasant spicey mouthfeel. Definitely hits all the Biere de garde notes with a bit of a Belgian yeast suggestion in the background. A tart but not overly sour ale I enjoyed this quite a bit."
""
"Overall- exceptional beer. There's so many things going on with this beer but it's all in such tight and controlled harmonious balance that nothing overwhelms anything else. So deceptively smooth and refreshing. Outstanding brew."
"O: Not a total standout but certainly very well done."
""
"Took an unexpected turn in the taste & texture, not enjoyable but again not quite delivering on some of the sweet promises made in the aroma. Still, given recalibrated expectations, I'd do this one again, as it offered something unusual."
"Overall I'd have to give this beer near perfect scores. I've had it several times over the past year and each time I have enjoyed it more each time. When I don’t want a Hop Bomb like and IPA a Gavroche usually comes to mind…"
"I had this at the Winter Kraftbrew Beer Fest in San Jose, which featured mainly porters, stouts, and winter warmers. When I tasted the Gavroche, I was reminded of the Sesame Street song ""One of These Things is Not Like the Other"". Despite my palate being somewhat muddled by the darker beers, I felt this was a bright, light beer that might be a good intro into Lambics. I'm not a fan of Lambics, but this is as close as I've come to one that I liked. Sweet fruit was balanced well with pale malt and the minimal amount of hops necessary to bitter the beer. Definitely open to trying again."
""

""

""
""
"Future outlook: Glad to have tried, and enjoyed it, though I doubt I will be seeking it out again anytime soon."
"Overall, a tasty ale. If I hadn't read the label, I would have thought that this was either a Flemish sour or an Oud Bruin from its appearance. Definitely the most unique French beer I have had in quite some time. I would definitely pick this one up again."
"This beer poured out as a deep red color with a fizzy cream colored head on top. The smell of the beer was pretty earthy to me I thought. There werre some light roasted notes and caramel on the nose. The taste of the beer was semi-sweet with a pretty strong bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was pretty good it had a medium body to it. Overall it's a decent brew from France."
""
""
""
"D - Incredibly smooth, booziness in well ""hidden"". Definitely looking forward to trying brews from this French Brewery"
"O - This was pretty tasty. Another great bottle find at Sycamore!"
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, not the best representation of style, not a beer that I would choose again as there are others that better in the style."
"O: An interesting, tart, tad funky biere de garde; not boozy but still a bit tough to drink a ton of"
"Dr: High ABV is well concealed, drinkability is decent, and flavours are distinct. It isn't to my tastes, but fans of the flavours will enjoy it."
"D ~ Would not say world-class, but this is a very well executed beer that stays within its style to a T. Worth the Price tag (about 3.75 a bottle) for those who are a fan of the style. Very drinkable."
"I'm glad I bought this beer, it was quite straightforward and generic. However, it did highlight on things that I enjoy in a beer, such as a rich, sweet malt and bubbly carbonation. I would drink this beer again, but would also need to be in a specific mood."
"Very solid beer, nice malt body that isn't too sweet and just a touch of the earthy funk."
"A very nice Red Ale but with unusual fruity notes, spicy notes, and more robust malt character than is expected. All these are welcomed as the influence of brewing traditions from Ireland, Belgium, England, and France converge."
"Overall, the flavors present in Gavroche are excellent, the brewers having obviously chosen top-quality ingredients and used them liberally. The brew's one weakness is its high carbonation, which, in addition to slightly robbing the taste, makes the beer feel more like a soft drink on the tongue and soft palate. Still, this is a brew to be reckoned with. Well worth trying."
"Recommendation from Joel and it pours a golden copper hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves a three finger creamy head with dimples that stays and leaves heaps of creamy clingy lacing,the smell is prunes,raisins,boiled candy and dried apricots,the mouthfeel is abit light for my liking and only just above light bodied but very sessionable and has tastes of raisins,maple syrup,apricots,bready malts and finished with a candy sweetness and overall a very enjoyable drop with its high ABV nowherre to seen but not the best out there but nice netherless."
"Not at all a bad beer."
"O: The first time I had this beer, I hated it, this is quite nice actually."
"(Had this WITH the yeast, their website suggests serving it without the yeast!)"
"A very interesting beer. I liked it."
"A hazy rusty dull copper with an enormous soft tan foamy head. There is an slight dome of foam trying to resist spilling over the edge of the tulip glass. There is a malty alcohal scent and some nut notes on the nose. The taste is earthy with some honey and a slight boozyness. The mouthfeel is heavy and somewhat dry. This is not as good as I remember."
"Overall I thought this was a very well made beer. It was not anything mind blowing, or overly exciting, but it had plenty of great flavors and drank very well."
"O- this is a ""meh"" beer for me, it could be the style, or it could be the bottle, not sure yet, but I guess I'll just have to try a few more to find out."
"O - I really liked this beer. Champagne-like effervescence and great balance between malt and funk makes this one of the better examples of its style."
"An interesting sipping beer, but a too strong to say it's highly drinkable."
"Overall a nice introduction to the style, but I think I'll overlook it next time at the bottlo."
"Conclusion: Totally different from the other Biere de Garde that I have tried, but very good. I am intrigued by this beer, and am happy that I picked it up without knowing what it was."
"OVERALL- Comes off almost like an American Strong or British Old Ale, very bombastic for biere de guarde, but tasty none the less. Big but balanced, intense, but not really complex. Would probably make a great cellaring project."
"Drinkability: Nice. I will definitely be coming back for more."
"D: The nose and appearance are this beer's strong suits. If the flavor had lived up to the nose, the score would be even higher. Overall, I'm very happy I grabbed this."
"WS"
"D - Stuff is quite drinkable. The 8.5% is just slightly noticeable. I'm sure a nonexploded bottle would shine a little better than this but it was still a tasty drink."
"D- Very tasty and the alcohol is expertly intergrated. Would love to try more examples of the style from this brewery."
"Drinks like: For eight and a half percent alcohol by volume, it's EXTREMELY drinkable."
"It was a pretty nice beer, with the smell being better than the taste. I may get another someday, but it didn't make a really memorable connection with me... other than the glass and how good it looked in it!"
"It pours a deep amber with a big lasting white head. The aroma has a faint soapy fragrance and cellar musty-ness that gives way to some nice floral hoppy note The flavor is mineraly with just a slight grassy sweetness up front that gives way at the end to a tart acidity. Gavroche is an extremely light and refreshing beer with little CO2 explosions that contantly tickle the senses."
"Hey, I'm glad I tried my first French Red Ale, I recognize the quality and enjoyed it, BUT, the truth is it's not much more than just any beer and in a blind taste test with the head already settled down I would have had no idea of this beer's foreign pedigree and just scored it a little above average."
"D: Not really what I was expecting in this style. Has its good points, but not something I'd revisit."
"I liked this beer, but this type of beer I would need to be in the mood for. The earthy flavor really hits you hard."
"Pours a perfectly clear reddish orange with a decent enough head. The aroma is fruity and deeply nutty with some root herb. The hoppiness is both bright and earthy. The aroma is rye bread and some mild fruity sweetness. Overall this beer is nicely dry and has some complimentary pear and peppery notes. The carbonation is lively."
"O: A very drinkable beer. Not super complex, but has some interesting malt-derived flavors."
"D: The beer is quite drinkable due to its balanced taste and interesting flavors. I would definitely try this again."
"D - Drinks pretty well for its abv. This beer definitely has enough flavour and body to be enjoyable. Reminds me of other beer styles, like red ale, brown ale and dubbel."
"Final Thoughts: This beer, and I suspect this style reminds me very much of trappist beer, specfically Chimay Red and Blue. It's nice, but it's not something I'd regualarly buy. I would recommend it though."
"An interesting take on the biere de garde style. Easy to drink and enjoy but beyond that, nothing really complex to report about."
"Very interesting beverage. I don't think I would use this for casual drinking, but it would be very good with food."
"Absolutely nothing like a 3 Monts, but still well worth a try."
"Drinkability is low here. Should be more flavorful and easy to drink."
"Another great find from Premier. I'm glad I could get my hands on this style. In terms of comparisons, I drew a lot of similarities with a gruit beer, mainly the pronounced herbal, earthy, tea-like characters. Based on this beer alone, I wouldn't say this is my favorite style but it has still left me looking forward to their 3 Monts I have in my fridge."
"D: Having never heard of this beer, I was pleasantly surprised. Well done; this is a daily drinker, not so precious that you have to savor every drop, but keeps rewarding with a complex array of notes. I did not see any yeast residue but the last glass poured definitely had more of a yeasty note than the first."
"Poured into my Zatec Fluted glass. Nice amber color with a huge growing head about 4 fingers high. Sponging lacing with great retention. Smells a bit nutty malty with some nice floral aromatic hops (cascade?). Flavor is definitely bringing the nuts and hops. Almost starts off tasting like a mild sour. This beer changes drastically as it warms. Nice bitter and dry finish. Very drinkable for 8.5 abv. The French are bringin the pain with this one. Great representation of style."
"D: This is a stellar beer. I enjoyed every sip and will probably have to buy another one. To me this is analogous to a kristalweizen being clean hefe."
"Another nice biere de garde from St.-Sylvestre, though not my favorite. Nevertheless, it is still a tasty one, and (if you're fine with all the carbonation) a hoppier beer of this style too."
"An interesting, strange beer. Reviews are telling, everyone seems to experience this beer differently. Bottle variance?"
"Carbonation is too high, only further deteriorating that dry finish."
"Is it a coincidence that the label on the bottle actually looks like a wine label?"
"Terrific mouthfeel. Very smooth and almost creamy in the mouth. Carbonation is somewhat low and this drinks very, very nicely, especially at 8,5%. Very drinkable. One of the best French beers I have had to date."
"In all not a keeper but wouldnt turn it down"
"I really enjoy the biere de garde style,this seemed to be out of that category in its traits.Poured a hazed lighter amber shade with a huge blooming white head that never settled.Aromas of pilsner malt with a faint leafy note,not really a whole lot going on.Flavors are dryish and lightly toasted,a bit of freshly baked bread in the finish.Does not seem that it could be 8.5%abv.,its rather light.Eh I was expecting more,there are many better of the style."
"Good drinkability. A bit bland overall, but easy to drink and goes down easily."
"D - Yes, would drink again. I think the combination of its taste and mouthfeel makes it a good beer for me. Fresh."
"Good drop!"
"D - nice and tasty. very good to drink although alcohol would prevent multiples in a sitting"
"33cl bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy, amber color. There was a fairly big ecru head that dropped away rather quickly. The aroma is nice. It is somewhat bready, with some faint caramel malts. Some faint fruits in there also, as well as a light amout of earthy hops. It is a bit ""tingly"" on the tongue. Some dark fruits, caramel, and a dryness in the finish. Pretty decent."
"D- this one was a bit of a chore to struggle through. doubt id get another one."
"An overall great beer that is Belgian in style and complexity, even though it's a French beer; clearly the Belgian influence has dominated the taste of this beer, which I am thankful for. It went down so nice and easy that I had a second with dinner the Gotham Bar and Grill in NYC."
"Interesting beer but not one I think I will try again. For one thing it is far drier than I expected and secondly it is under-flavored to me."
"A very well made beer, with vast character and a degree of freshness or house character that has in my opinion been lost in many larger Belgian style brewhouses."
"Pours a lightly hazed copper/orange, thick off white head forms, drops to a thin layer, some nice lacing sticks all over the glass. Smell is neat, sweet and sour, caramel, citrus and tangerine, lemons, lightly tart, honey, a bit funky, pretty interesting. Taste is similar, sweet and sour up front, toast, biscuit, very fruity, citrus, lemons, sugary and tart finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, pretty unique beer. Thanks Eric!"
"Thanks Eric for busting out the bottle!"
"Nice brew, not something I would drink regularly but a nice surprise. Not a hint of the alcohol, easy drinking."
"D - I was expecting this to be a French red ale but was pleasantly surprised, being that I wasn't a huge fan of my first encounter with the style. I will definitely seek this one out again."
"Takes multiple pours to get it all into the glass. Once finished, it has a nice deep amber color with a thick beige head that lasts for a good amount of time. Smells a little bit fruity, like apples; however, the scent isn't too strong. Taste is a mix of bitter hops and fruit. It goes down pretty smoothly with a slight tingle on the tongue when it first touches the mouth. Overall a good beer from France which is somewhat surprising for a country mostly known for wine, champagne, and cognac."
"Overall, not a very drinkable brew. Definitely a slow sipper that you will want to allow to warm before drinking. An interesting mesh of a biere de garde and a flanders red, but still leaves something to be desired."
"a shame about the gusher. knocked off on the [appearance] score just a little."
"This is a bit too sweet to drink a lot of or to drink it often but I'm definitely enjoying this. I'm going to have to check out some other French beers, I'm impressed."
"Notes: Had no earthly idea what to expect from this beer. I bought it simply because it was from French Flanders. Stunning beer. Wish we could get it here."
"Not a bad beer but not a session beer too."
"This is a damn good beer. I don't notice the 8.5% abv, I drank this beer as fast as I would a 4% abv kolsch or hefeweizen."
"D: Not really. The wine flavour is just too over powering... maybe it needs a bit of age."
"light fruity aftertaste."
"The taste is lacking any definition, very mild malt with some metallic notes, not great, not bad. Heavy and well carbonated, a nice summer type ale but lacking any distinction, not a great one for this style, much better ones out there. A big let down from the appearance."
"Overall this was a beer that I enjoyed, but I'm still trying to fully appreciate Biere de Garde's so maybe I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have given the style. Still, it's worth a shot."
"With an ABV of 8.5% you are above average for this style of beers so be warned if you consume many in a row..."
"I didn't notice the ABV until after I'd finished it, and I was surprised it was so high. It's a nice beer; a dusty, dry, but refreshing brew."
"This is interesting, but right now it is not for me. Maybe this will grow on me as I try this a couple of more times."
"Great beer, very clean and smooth."
"Pours a burnt copper with a towering eggshell head. The foam eventually dies down to leave some lacing on the tulip. Smells nice; malt with a light farmhouse yeast presence. A bit of spice. Taste is quite malty, though it lacks the sweetness that normally accompanies. There's actually a dry tartness with a dry finish. Quite nice. Though it's not my favorite, this is a nice bière de garde."
"All in all, a very solid beer, I certainly won't hesitate to finish off the other 4 in the fridge when the urge strikes."
"This is a nice beer, flemish in character, but from France. Called a red, but really more of a dark golden trending toward amber color. Bright frothy head, with gripping lace. Smell is fairly mild with a tartness that forecasts the coming flavor. Brisk and fulfilling on the mouth, bright carbonation and a blast of flavor. Nice well rounded beer, tart, but in the most subdued way, a nice, easy drinking beer. If it was cheaper it could be an everyday sort of thing. Highly recommended to those who like a sour but don't want to be totally dried out."
"Taste: A nice roasted malt complex it is thick and syrupy, with hints of citrus molasses, esters, and yeast. The beer would be fantastic 5 or 6 years down the road."
"BOTM 12 ounce bottle. Reddish copper slithly cloudy pour with a huge fizzy cream head. Aroma of barnyard malt, straw, sharp hops and grains. Full body. Taste of earthy hops with an oaky finish that lingers. Really different but very easy to drink and enjoyable. Perfect on a fall evening."
"Drinkability is better than I expected for the style. Alcohol is well-hidden and it would be enjoyable whether it was 80 degrees or snowing."
"A wonderful lively mouthfeel, with a lot of active carbonation, but not too heavy in the body. Moderate, with a slightly watery finish making this amazingly refreshing. Another huge hit with me from the Sylvestre clan in France."
" My only major critique of this beer is that it's just a bit too strong. Some of the stouts that I've had lately had less feel of alcohol in them, even though they were actually stronger than this. No matter, this is very well crafted beer and quite worth the chance I took on it. For $3.99 a bottle, it doesn't get any better than this!"
"D= An unusual ale that I enjoyed very much. Its unique flavor profile would probably limit me to one or two at a sitting, but I still consider it to be a very drinkable beer."
"D- This beer is a bit dull with not many flavors and those that are there are not very interesting. Especially at this price point I was expecting at least a little flavor."
"Appearance is orange-copper with soapy sloppy head. Taste and smell are of slightly sour apple, tart with roasted malt. Spicy with a tingle. Virtually no hop presence but finishes spicy. Alcohol completely hidden. Deeper apple character like cidre or stewed apple as well. Mouthfeel and drinkability are high due to fuller almost chewy consistency and crisp lingering lively acidity."
"Not worth the $9.99 a 4-pk. though..."
"It tastes just OK, but it is very disappointing considering the brewery. A forgettable effort."
"Pours a clear orange/red color with a one finger white cloudy head that fades quickly to a very thin head that remains throughout the beer. Deep fruit, cherry, oak aromas. Flavors of chocolate malt up front, sour cherry, alcohol, light smoke with a very dry oaky finish. Highly carbonated, medium body, very dry, slightly watery mouthfeel. Lots of different flavors come through making this an interesting beer."
"D - This is a really flavorful beer with some very interesting complexity. It's quite a nice treat. However, I find it a bit sweet to have more than one in a setting."
"Sweet malty and berry aroma with presence of yeast. Flavour is very complex - roasted dry malt with spicy berry, almost no bitterness and the presence of alchohol can be felt. Mouthfeel is creamy. Pleasant, warming and long lasting lightly sweet and roasted aftertaste."
"D- Very drinkable...I'm going to have another right now!"
"Spicy and warming. The higher alcohol level is evident, but the puckering (slightly astringent) Italian-like spices balance this well. Overall, this is a malty beer with little notable hop. Solid body with a lower carbonation level than the head would indicate."
"Really pretty in the glass. Nice, deep gold (not so much of the red hue I've heard others mention) with a tall, frothy head that you have to drink through with the first few sips. Malty with a nice, subtle hops in the nose. Decent mouthfeel, with delicate carbonation. Unfortunately, the taste was disappointing--and a result of the higher ABV. As similar ales go, this is a good one; but the alcohol hits you immediately, then lingers as an astringent aftertaste. Definitely not a session beer. I prefer something where the alcohol sneaks up on you. This one hits you in the face."
"Smooth drinking, not too harsh despite the ABV. A nice sipper."
"d- Went excellently with a cheesesteak, heh. Refreshing, and the constrast between the beer and pretty much everything a normal person would eat is enjoyable. Good variety."
"Balanced, subdued and drinkable."
"En bouche, la Gavroche est définitivement caramélisée, avec même quelques touches me faisant penser à l'érable. Une belle rondeur malgré le pétillant. La mousse est d'ailleurs TRÈS persistante. Un peu moins riches que ses congénères, mais très agréable. À laisser vieillir."
"Nice one here. Really enjoyed it. Kind of a Belgian Red-Irish Red combo. Wouldn't have guessed it was 8.5%. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability - this is not very good, and so it is not sessionable, and I certainly would not have it very often, if ever. Finishing the 4-pack was a chore."
"Final Thoughts-This is a great beer that I really can't compare to anything I've had before. Seek this one out and enjoy something that comes from France."
"M: Medium-full bodied. Well carbonated which makes for a very drinkable beer."
"D - Pretty drinkable beer. It is light and simple enough to enjoy a few."
"Pours a hazy reddish and slightly burnt copper with a huge tan head into a snifter. Retention is extraordinary. Has an aroma of dry malts, pears, oranges and grapes, all wrapped up in some pleasant alcohol whiffs. Tastes a bit fruity with some breadiness and a slight earthy feel, before it goes down smooth. There is a very slight alcohol burn at the end. Medium to full-bodied and fairly active. My first thought upon the pour was that it was almost ""bubbly", which is fitting, since it's from France. Haven't had many beers of this style, but am liking what I'm getting out of this one."
"11.2oz brown bottle from A-1 To-Go in Gardiner. Pours a hazy golden almost red body with nearly an inch of off-white head. Smell is not overwhelming, but consists of spice, caramel, and fruit. Tastes fruity - like citrus, apple, pear... Some roast, yeast, and slight alcohol is apparent. Very dry, one of the driest beers I've had in some time. Fairly clean on the finish Medium in body with vigorous carbonation. A fairly easy drinker considering the abv. Not bad at all, but not necessarily something I'll be seeking out again very soon. Well worth the try though, very unique."
"I am really enjoying this beer. One of the reviews that I read stated to drink this at cellar temp and I agree 100%. A lovely beer."
"D - This beer is not the worst thing ever, and I would venture to say that many people would enjoy this lightweight. I respect subtlety in beer, but this was just seemed weak... Won't look for again..."
"Overall, a very nice beer. I think i would be at my limit with two of these, but I am very surprised on how much alcohol this one has in relation to not detecting any of it. Certainly a good one to try."
"Pours dark amber with a very good head that sticks around as a cap for the life of the pour. Sweet/sour aromas of brown sugar and a touch of cider vinegar. More sweet than sour, and rather simple. Taste is similar but with a touch of herbal bitterness running throughout. More brown sugar to start followed by the slightest acetic touch and then the long, soft bitterness. Relatively soft and finely carbonated in the mouth. Simple, but pleasant."
"Pours a clouded ruby brown with minimal tan head. Nose is sugary, cherry, with a touch of wood. Flavor is smooth with a touch of wood somewhere in there and a slight bit of caramelized sugar. Feel is great. Nice effervescence and bubbly on the tongue. Drinkable, yes. Quite good and worth going to...maybe worth going to again."
"It's a nice beer - not one I'd hunt down specifically, but one I'd happily buy where availale."
"Served at cellar temp."
"Nice little strong ale for a French brewer."
"Drinkability: a nice slow sipping beer where one bottle is enough in a session, but I could see having a bottle several nights in row. Give this one a try."
"D- Good yeasty strong beer. Alcohol a little too prominent for my taste."
"Tasty brew, recommended."
"D: Surprisingly refreshing."
"An interesting beer. Very complex; a lot going on. Poured with a nice head and some lace. Most left after a while. Aromatic. Slightly hazy amber. Quite malty, with some zesty spicyness with some sweetness in the background. Good body. Finishes extra long. no indication of alcohol."
" Another good beer from Anchor."
"D: Only my second biere de garde, but it seems spot on for the description. Easy drinking and worth a try."
"Had this sitting on the patio on a warm late summer afternoon, which I guess is a bit strange, but it worked out. Poured into a wine glass, medium brown with a two-finger fluffy head. Spicy, peppery smell, not too heavy, but with hints of some mildly toasted malts. Very solid mouthfeel, with lots of yeasty and bready notes. The spice and pepper carries through, with some mild hints of fruit and smoke. Some sweetness as it warms up, and the mouthfeel seems to get heavier. Surprisingly drinkable for a high-ABV beer."
"Beer translated from french 5-6-2008."
"Overall: Very nice brew. I enjoyed the unique looking bottle and this beer looks nice in the glass. It has an inviting aroma and nice mild taste. It would be a great beer to have along side a nice dinner and may pull it out next time we have guests over for a nice dinner. It's a nice beer and if you can find it I say give it a try. When it comes to this one Viva La France."
"Pours out a slightly hazed amber marmalade with a thick, rocky head that looks like nutmeg-tinged whipped egg whites. Lots of champagne-like carbonation races to the head. Smell is loaded with caramel and toffee with a lightly toasted malt presence. Hops are earthy and almost woodsy. Flavor is a mix of toasted malts, big caramel, and loads of fruity esters. I get lots of apple and pear. A sweetness is present on into the finish, but never feels overpowering nor does it stand out all that much while intermingling with the other flavors. Finishes with a great balancing bitterness and a leafy, herbal, earthy hop presence. The aftertaste reveals an almost roasted malt quality. Mouthfeel is on the verge of chewy yet has a very active carbonation (which never gets so overbearing that it stings). I'm highly impressed by this. Tastes rather ""English"" to me. One of the better Biere de Gardes that I've had, for sure."
"A complex, delicious bottle-conditioned brew to sip on!"
"Thanks to Buckspin for the recommendation. Pours a dark golden color with a a large foamy head. Smells a bit on the yeasty side. Tastes quite yeasty too, a nice sharp somewhat citrusy flavor, bit of a bready aftertaste, pretty neat combo. A bit way carbonated for me, but overall a really good beer and worth seeking out."
"That was excellent, a fantastic beer. I can now see how this would be a great cooler weather beer, but I also enjoyed its simplistic complexity. This would pair fabulously with just about any cheese that comes to mind, and would also be great with spiced meats, rustic loaves, stews, wild game. A most pleasing personal discover, and easily one of my most enjoyable autumn beer experiences of late. Highly recommended, a very versatile, simple yet sophisticated beer that is sure to please. Check this out if you can, you will not be disappointed!"
"Drinkability- Very much so. This beer I could drink all day long with no problems. The 8.5% alcohol is so deciving that I would have been fooled and been acting like a fool long ago if I had this poured in a college 'yard' glass."
"Into a tulip glass, pours a ____ color, enormous head springing forth, a fluffy cloud of bubbly foam that never gets thinner than a half inch, all the while leaving trails and webs of lace around the glass. Just lovely. The aroma is hard to pick up through the massive head, easier as it warms, but whats there is earthen, a fair malt, a bit fruity, honey, a yeastiness thats a bit spiced. The flavor is fully of malts, not so sweet as toasted, earthen spices, herbal, drying through the middle into the finish. It feels... old, like an artifact, not quite of this age. That said, its a fine beer."
"D - An interesting, very tasty beer. One would be enough but that one is a good one."
"The head on this beer is enormous. It's full, stable, and intricate. Sitting atop a deep orange colored liquid (with a bit of haze), this is a fantastic looking beer. I love beers that are visually attractive. The aroma is a little faint, but it does have some great characteristics: a bit of yeast, a little funk and tartness, some toasted grain and malts, a little pepper, and just a bit of over-ripe fruit. The smell could use some more strength, but the smell is respectable nonetheless. The taste is a bit sweet, with some pale malt flavor up front, a little toffee, and some yeast. It's a little tangy as well. The beer seems to hide it's alcohol pretty well. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, with a nice amount of heft. It fits together pretty well. Nothing in the beer stands out and says I'm great, but it is a solidly good and very enjoyable beer. I'd certainly have another one of these."
"worth a try if you see it and like saisons, biere de gardes, etc"
"Gavroche (a street urchin in Victor Hugo's 'Les Miserables') suffers from an abundance of simplicity. I know that biere de gardes are open to a great deal of interpretation, but I don't see this as a member of that style at all. To me, it tastes like a caramel malt-driven maibock with a hint of Belgian yeastiness. I expected more from the creators of 3 Monts. Now *that's* a biere de garde."
"d: this one was tasty both when it was too cold & when it warmed up, pretty easy to drink and a nice surprise given the sour nose. definitely prefer this to the 3 monts offering."
"D: Closest beer I've tasted that comes anywhere near Orval. Complexity of un-beer-like aromas & flavours makes this quite intriguing."
"Not very impressive. The packaging and price tag led me to expect something much, much better. Not bad, by any means, just unexciting. I'm guessing my bottle wasn't at its peak, so I might revisit this if I were assured of its freshness."
"Looks like a typical Irish red ale, a bit less red, but topped by a monstrous head. Lightly sweet aroma has a bit of a unique smell as well. Flavor is slightly tart, but yet sweet. Some slight caramel notes, some fruit flavor, and then a decent amount of bitterness. Noticeable, at least. Mouthfeel is fairly effervescent, drinkability is OK. The beer just seems a little un-interesting to me though. Glad I tried it, but don't expect to try it again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, malty, sugary, with a little bit of spices hanging on till the semi-dry finish."
"Cheers!"
"Emphasis on yeast and spice rather than much sweetness. Got better as it warmed."
"A friend from work gave this to me. Never had a Biere de Garde before, but I'd try some more from the style. The mouthfeel was exceptional!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and as was seen in the pour, quite carbonated...very easy to consume a couple of these."
"11.2 oz bottle. The liquid is released from the bottle a light amber color with a very tall three finger head that sits well above the brew, not wanting to fall at all. The clarity on this is outstanding, and a moderate to full carbonation is seen advancing towards the top of my glass. The aroma is interesting. I get a mild musty earthyness, with a light tartness that reminds me of cherry, along with a faint tannin-like spiceyness. I like how these all work together to round each other out. Flavors are much different from the aroma. There are lots of fruity notes of dry raisin to almost fig, with a solid musty earthy undertone. As it warms, a spicy cherry-like character comes through to add a nice complexity to it. There is definately a lot going on in this one. It is nice. The feel is moderate, with a very active carbonation. It is both filling yet light as I drink it. I just looked at the ABV, and there is only a hint of alcohol in the flavor of this one, but it blends well with the flavors that are there. I enjoy this brew."
"THe beer is an easy drinker and is tasty, I was hoping it would be a little more sour going in, but make no mistakes, this is an interesting and tasty brew. worth the couple $$ i paid for the bottle."
"The yeast taste predominates and it is more of a decent Blegium produced outside of France. Reminded me more of a Unibroue than a beer de garde, that flavour being understated. Quite drinkable, some grain and creaminess in mouthfeel.. Nice yeasty head and pleasant aroma."
"Poureda slightly hazy reddish-copper color with massive tannish head. No lacing. Smell is fruity and nutty, with moderate alcohol notes prominent. Taske is more fruits and nuts, with initial strong alcohol notes, that become less noticeable as the beer warms and is comsumed. Strong, vibrfant mouhtfeel with some hops showing through at the finish. An OK beer, just not really my style."
"Poured clear reddish-orange with 1/3 glass of soapy foam, very good lace. Smells spicy with black pepper, yeast, and citrus fruits (lemon, orange). Flavor begins with sweet and slightly musty grains, develops a toasted center with metallic and peppery spice notes, finishes with caramel and strong alcohol sting. Medium-oily body with lots of carbonation, but decently balanced creaminess. An interesting, though not definitive, take on the biere de garde."
"Last swigs:"
"Bought expecting to be either very pleased or very disapointed. Unfrotunately, it was the latter. Foul smelling. Simply foul, yeast notes gone arye. Plain unattractive appearence, clouded and murky straw yellow. Looks polluted. Head diminished all but immediately. Mouthfeel is thin and flat, like warm soda. Alcohol fairly noticable. Flavour is generally distastful, lacking in any character. No saving grace in the flavour department, an odd blend on the palatte. Over ripened notes but of ... not sure what exactly. Drinking tihs beer was like trying to read fuzzy writting. Difficult and gave me a headache. Generally off balance, drinkability very low."
"The color is almost red/brown with a slight tint in the head that has a little retention with a lacing that stays nicely. Sour wood, apple, cinamin, and plum are flavors making it more complex. This beer is fruity and then earthy with a slightly sour finish. It's woody with some suddle flavors. The mouthfeel is a little off, it's harsh and full of carbonation. Overall I wouldn't have another of these particular beers right away."
"Body and drinkability: Light to medium/light, easy to drik and quite enjoyable. The only downside might be the almost chalklike dryness that may surface now and then."
"(11.2 oz brown bottle with slim neck and phalic knob at top with ""Brasserie De St. Sylvestre"" embossed around the neck)"
"Mouth: Very alcoholic in flavor and honey sweet. The hops are pretty much cut out of the flavor, replaced by the bready taste of malt and yeast."
"Not a good beer..again reminds me of something Ceres would brew. Chemical, hot, boozy..this beer just sucks and I feel totally ripped off for buying a 4-pack of this."
"Orange-red body, hazy yet homogenous. Big billowy head, this beer take a little while to pour. The head fades slowly, leaving a little lace. Smell is sweet malt and a little earthy, a touch of honey. Taste is sour with sweet bready malt and a little pepper. Bland, but also touches on cloying. I don't like it, too sweet, annoying. Mouthfeel is sharp but also a little buttery smoothness. I wouldn't consider getting this again."
"I don't know that I trust the French, and I am even more unsure if I trust a French beer ... based on past experience, but here goes with the Gavroche. Pours a sparkling, dark amber red color with a really thick, dense light tan head that lasts and lasts. So fa, so good. Nose is quite malty, but flirts with a strong hop presence. Carries a nice fruity scent as well. Smells quite rich and earthy. Palate is slightly biting with a malt assertiveness up front. Rich and fruity without being too sweet. Make no mistake, there is substantial hop flavors here, balancing out the maltiness quite well. Alcohol is present and detectable. This beer is medium-bodied and finishes quite dry, thanks to the hops. I'm really quite impressed with this beer in every regard. A very good Biere De Garde ... almost a Belgian Saison bred with a German Bock if I were to describe it in comparisons. I like it, I say! My beret off to the French for this one."
"Bottle: Poured a murky brown color ale with a super huge foamy head with good retention. Aroma of grainy malt is quite dominating with a light funky touch coming from the yeast. Taste is quite complex with some caramel malt that end up a bit dry with some sweetness and a light funky and bitter finish. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden. Better the most take on this sometime ambiguous style."
"Overall, Gavroche isn't bad. It would go well with some pungent cheese, as would most fermented French beverages I suppose. In fact, I can sense some earthy characteristics that seem familiar to me from whenever I've had a glass of wine. I wonder if they fermented this in a wooden vessel."
"D: on the balance, this is a full-bodied ale and, to me, is more like a winter-warmer which I could play withvery satisfying and not to be consumed quickly. BTW, it's very thirst-provoking too, despite its strength..."
"Quite enjoyable!"
"An pleasant and wily beer (the 8.5% alcohol isn't noticable at all!) with a interesting blend of Belgian and British flavours."
"Drinkability: I could enjoy a couple of these at a session, and the off-notes aren't as noticable after you roll the bottle a bit and finish pouring."
"Shared this bottle with my brother at UJ's on the Manatawny. The beer poured a hazy redish color into the glass with active carbonation and a medium tanish head. Based on the name it could be confused for a flemish sour or Flanders Red but it is really a Biere de Garde and that comes across in the taste and smell. The aroma is a clean an fruity (cherries, grapes, etc). The taste is a bit fruity with some good hop bitterness and carbonation. They did a good job of masking the high abv in this one. The beer has a medium body but due to the active carbonation, it is not overly drinkable, at least for more than one."
"This beer proves that breweries in France are also able to produce beers, that are not shameless copies of Belgian ones."
"This is disappointing for a Flanders Red, but overall, not a bad beer. Highly carbonated, bitter, and mildly tasty. Pretty good burps!"
"Need to age, apparently, to show its more tart and acidic side."
"J'aime cette bière. ;^)"
"Tawny orange. Active poof of noisy white on top. Aromas of spiced, dessicated chunks of nectarine and tangerine. Forest resins, vanilla, gravy. Big mouthfuls of fizzy fruits are bound tightly with dry wood tannins. Brandied, boozy, dried red and yellow fruits are abundant. Glazed with burnt sugars. Packed with powdery, dry, sweet brown spice tannins. Dry vanilla husk flavors infuse the dusty, floury finish."
"The taste was a bit alcoholic to an extends, with some caramel flavours coming into play. This beer taste heavy, it is warm because of the alcohol touch that comes and make you feel warm."
"A complex, well balanced beer that is a pleasure to drink."
"Quite good body, but maybe not enough for the alcohol level."
"Pours with a five-finger light tan pillowy head leaving a good lace pour slowly. Slightly cloudy reddish amber. Nose is alcohol. Smooth and warm going down, the alcohol is noticeable, and the after taste is alcohol; still a good balance of malts and hops. A 330ml bottle was $2.99."
"A mild citrus bitterness is flanked by the light taste of gentle herbs and a dash of black pepper. The fine taste of aged oaky sherry, while noticeable at first gulp, gathers ground throughout making it the dominant flavor at the end. It must cellar well."
"Flanders Red Ale? Didn't pick it as that, nor did it say that on the label. Savoury, caramelly, slightyl yeasty. NIce bitter, herbal hops in the finish, full flavoured, very pleasant, tasted like a typical dark Biere de Garde, something a bit vinous about it aswell, really tasty in the end (Bottle- GBBF 03')"
"It is nice and creamy on the palate and leaves a nice honey-like film in the mouth (if only it didn't have that sour aftertaste!)."
"Must be served at cellar temperature, when it is too cold the phenols and mustiness is fierce. Very complex and a brew that is somewhat of an acquired taste also. This is definitely strong enough to pair up with pungent cheeses."
"Notes: One of the more interesting brews to have blessed my fridge in a long time. So complex and distinct."
