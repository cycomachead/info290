Look- burnt amber with a sudsy, generous head that sticks around and coats the top as it subsides. Smell- not too distinctive, mainly yeast notes. Taste- sweet, earthy, you really get the harvest grainy tastes the beer is shooting for. It's like fall in a glass. Feel- smoother as the beer goes down, nice with an abv under 6.

Nice, but light, nose of sweet malt and Belgian yeast fruit (banana) over a light spice (clove).  Almost medium bodied with a nice slick mouthfeel.  Superb carbonation with a nice effervescent finish.  The flavor profile is a bit complex, superbly balanced and reasonably intense.  It begins with an effervescent rush of sweetness - biscuit malt and fruit - that yields to a mild bitterness.  As the bitterness fades, rye flavor and it's associated touch of spice come forward over a slightly phenolic note.  The finish is somewhat crisp, a bit dry and the light bitterness lingers over a light sweetness with a clove phenolic note.  Quite nice.","tillmac62","Oct 15, 2014"

Very fine and soft carbonation in combination with the rye, oats and wheat produces very big, clingy, clumpy lace. Big grain flavors dominate the palate with biscuit supporting rye spice, some rye/wheat tang, slight funk and some faint banana. Earthy hops come in at the end to complete this light, well rounded and well composed beer. The grains in this medium body beer provide a rich rye, wheat and oat texture with a little oat slickness.","pat61","Oct 14, 2014"

3.91,1.3,4.5,4,3.75,4.25,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, it felt like it was on the tamer side of a Biere De Garde with no tartness showing up, but it did have a fair amount of that malty aspect that I expect from the style.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, very crisp, slightly prickly, dry on finish, not foo filling and the taste did a nice job at holding at holding my attention, I think two would be my limit, any more than that and the higher carbonation might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both very nice and I thought they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was that the taste didn't seem as bold and bright as the aroma, I think that's the only thing I would want to change.  I might buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I for sure wouldn't turn one down.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes malty beers with Belgian yeast, it has some decent balance to it.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, with just a little work it could be a great beer though.  It's not my favorite beer from Brewery Ommegang and it isn't my favorite Biere De Garde, it falls right in the middle of the style.  Nice job guys this, this was a nice beer that fit well into the season, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Oct 07, 2014"

A great brew that all fans of pale Belgian styles and farmhouse ales should consider worth seeking out - and given the fact that this bottle is over a year old, it holds up quite nicely in the short-term, too.

Aroma of bready, slightly toasted malt, stone fruit, root spices, mild citrus, intriguing. Rich flavor of bready malt, cinnamon, rye, cloves, graham cracker, dark and light stone fruit, spicy and earthy. Finishes spicy with a mild hop bitterness and more of the tart saison yeast character I'd expect for the style. Nice creamy medium body with excellent mouth feel. A pleasant, very tasty fall beer that leans in the direction of a winter warmer in character, if not ABV. If this is a biere de garde, I will have to reevaluate the style, which I've been avoiding after some over bretty, dry ones. I liked this very much and will get some more for the holidays.","LiquidAmber","Oct 07, 2013"

You can definitely pick out the sour rye. And there is a bit of pronounced wheat character as well. Bananas and cloves. Obviously barley. What is there to say about barley- what you're used to, toasty in this case. The oats are less noticeable but make their presence known a little bit in the mouthfeel. Lots of yeast characteristics too. Earth and fruit. Some bitterness from hops- maybe a little roasted malt bitterness too? Pretty fantastic. Well carbonated and full bodied. Drinkability is fairly low. This is a sipper, not a session beer. Strong and heavy. And I know fall beers should probably be sessionable.... oktoberfests etc. But still, this is an awesome fall beer. I'd like to have some of these on a cool night around a camp fire. I'm actually tempted to try something like this as a homebrew. Memorable and great overall.","burnstar","Oct 02, 2013"

The hops are mild and the flavor of alcohol is mild but there is a slight phenolic almost metallic hint which isn't too noticeable, but there and the dryness of the finish is practically to the bone with the extremely high carbonation which is almost seltzer like with a mineral carbonic quality.

While part of the Duvel family of beers, something like this almost needs to take that relationshop and turn it onto its head. Duvel should be part of the Ommegang family of beers, as this was better than its European counterparts and pushed the limits of what's possible as an Autumn Seasonal. Pleasant surprises are why I drink so many new beers and this was no exception - this was well worth seeking out and a joy in every sense of the word and most importantly, proof that Ommegang's best offerings don't necessarily come in big bottles.

The nose is soft with nice spicing, moderate dark fruit, some malty sweetness, and Belgian yeast. It kind of smells like a smaller, spicier Dubbel. The flavors are spicy and fruit forward upfront, with a lot of fig and date influence. Ot almost has an old fashioned cola like flavor as well. There is a slight yeast character but it isn't as dominant as in some of the other Ommegang beers, which probably serves this one best. It drinks medium in body and off dry. It has nice flavor and is a standout for a Biere de Garde in my opinion. At 5.8% this is a Belgian ale capable of drinking a few of. Overall this is a fine Biere de Garde and a very nice interpretation of the style with unique spicing. If you're a fan of dubbels this would be right up your alley.","aasher","Beers"

The beer is surprisingly dry and bitter, but I guess that's appropriate. There's a big spicy, peppery finish with orange peel and light caramel up front. The aroma is fruitier with a little pear and apricot over doughy grain and toast. It is an earthy, herbal Belgian, and it really needs to warm to cellar temp for the edgier notes to balance out. It's certainly interesting, but I might not want to go through an entire 6-pack. Still, glad I tried it.","tempest","Jan 24, 2013"

Besides the aroma of the Belgian yeast, the predominant aromas are apricot, clove, white pepper and a touch of baseball glove leather. The taste is mildly sweet, but more fruity sweetness than sugar sweetness. Mildly tart and softly bitter. Medium-bodied. The grains show up in the finish, although I would say the taste is more of raw grain than cooked or roasted. Clean finish. The texture is soft. Body is medium. Medium carbonation. A pleasant beer that really tastes at around 55 degrees F. A very approachable brew from one of my favorite American breweries.","chickenflea","Dec 11, 2012"

Light to light medium body that feigns heavier at times; pleasant tantalizing carbonation. Slick and silky mouthfeel with a surprising touch of light creaminess. This really is a fantastic brew.

The aroma is spicy, earthy, and yeasty, with the Belgian yeasts and the rye working together. The taste is heavy on the yeast at first, perhaps too heavy, but it's quickly balanced out by the fantastic spicy, earthy, and grainy malts used here. There's a strong complexity of malts that's really something, but I think the yeast is a little too strong here. Not a major flaw, this is still a very good beer. The mouthfeel is lighter and a little confused, it's a bit sticky yet drying. The drinkability is solid. Overall, an interesting take on the Fall seasonal beer that is really close to greatness.

Body is medium, soft and smooth, nice carbonation, and semi dry.","cpetrone84","Oct 14, 2012"
3.85,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a glass mug. Pours hazy copper with a tall white head and numerous tiny bubbles in the beer. The head dissipates slowly. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are prominent fruit ester aromas. I pick up apple and citrus. There's some spice, which is a little peppery. It smells more like a saison. The taste follows the nose. I pick up some of the bready malt with that apple and citrus flavor. There's that peppery spice in the background that could be coming from the rye. It's definitely tasting like a saison as well as smelling like one. The body is light with strong carbonation. The finish is smooth and sticky. The aftertaste just coats to the mouth for a little while. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Oct 14, 2012"

The nose comprises sweet biscuit, light toffee, sweet flowers, clove, a hint of cocoa, light grass, and a pinch of brown sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some cracked wheat, light Belgian yeast, honey (a lovely bit of graham cracker character going on here), light vanilla bean, faint orange zest, and a dash of black pepper. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. Overall, a surprisingly highly enjoyable brew, one that shows what can be done with a variety of grains when they're tamed into working harmoniously with a classic yeast strain.

Very slow fade leaves a ton of lace and a thick covering. Mostly clear light brown with orange hues and some carbonation activity in the glass. Smell is sweet with fruity Belgian yeast esters and bready malt. Some light floral hops and bit of overripe banana. Spicy notes from the rye carry some pepper and faint cinnamon. Roasted grains throughout with caramel malt and light toffee. Taste is like a fall version of Rare Vos. Deep roasted grain maltiness with a dark fruit sweetness yields to a Belgian yeast with earth and an herbal hop bitterness that is delicate but firm. Lots of toffee and caramel wrapped in mutigrain dough. Spicy pepper cinnamon and clove .Finish is clean and dry with a light leafiness lingering in the mouth.just a touch of astringency that dries the mouth nicely. Feel is velvety with a coating carbonation that gives a soft crispness and overall quenching quality. Goes down so easily you find yourself at the end of the glass in seconds it seems.

Graham cracker? Where did this come from? While I was rather surprised to see this aspect come forward it just didn’t seem like it belonged with the rest of the brew.
