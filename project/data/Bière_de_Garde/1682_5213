I could easily have helped the Mrs. polish off another bottle and now wish I had another bottle. Everything combined makes this a great beer, but I think it helps to have a bit of a sweet tooth with this beer.","damndirtyape","Mar 04, 2013"

3.91,6.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability & Final Thoughts: A very drinkable beer which showcases well, if not extraordinarily, the basic elements of French-style bière de garde. There is enough complexity to the flavor and mouthfeel to warrant a thoughtul sipping, but it is also fresh and simple enough to drink more quickly along with or after a meal. At just over $5 for the 750 I'd have no reservations buying one again. I'd like to come across a fresher bottle and also perhaps store a couple for another year or two to see how they develop.","Gorgoroth","Sep 23, 2008"

3.73,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability is pretty good, it's pretty light and smooth, altough the flavor of the esters isn't my favorite, I'm just not a huge fan of those orange dominant french yeasts, a la Jenlain or Thiriez. Still, it has garded remarkably well, and softened some of it warmed an my pallate adjusted, making it a pretty nice little desert beer, without the usual strong sweetness. By the end, I really warmed up to it. Also, like Jenlain, La Choulette bieres are a bargain price compared to many of their counterparts.","ccrida","Jun 25, 2008"
3.22,-12.5,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"La Choulette Blonde is a very strange biere de garde. I've never had a beer with so many cider qualities. As a matter of fact if I was blindfolded I would think this was a cider. It's decent enough to drink but just doesn't follow along the lines of what I want in this fairly open style of beer.","joe1510","May 09, 2008"

Pours light, golden and clear, minor off white head and pretty standard lacing. Powdered sugar nose, then notes of ripe fruit, pepper, white wine, earthy and then a fairly sour finish. Complex, refreshing and generally interesting stuff. Went well with the spicy jambalaya we had for supper. Worth a try.","Billolick","Sep 02, 2007"

3.87,5.2,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Finely hazed pale gold appearance with a bright white head of about 1/2 an inch in height. Fairly simple ring lacing. Tart lemony aroma, suggestions of definite damp wood and muskiness. Medium mouthfeel, high carbonation. Fairly well-balanced approach, some yeastiness, dried straw, and medium citrus astringency, just held back by a countering malt sweetness that's a little non-descript except for a very bare caramelization and baked apple. The finish has a hard-to-pin-down fade to it, reminds me a little of soda water with a squeeze of bottled lemon concentrate. Not bad, nice aroma, not that distinctive.","ADR","Jul 07, 2006"

3.32,-9.8,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"A fair offering, though I prefer Sans Culottes. Pours out to a warm golden yellow hue that is slightly hazed. Small head of white foam calms to a thin layer of bubbles over the head of the beer. Lots of lace. Medium level of carbonation. Aroma smells like buttered popcorn and malt, with a touch fo meaty grain notes. Nice. Taste fair; buttery malt, sweet grains, earthy hues, some flowery notes and notions of yeast strains swirl about. Better when warmed to about 50 degrees or so. Mouthfeel was fine, slightly smooth and bubbly. Drinkability is average. Not bad. Worth trying. I just recommend that you have it at a warmer temp. than most beers.","Frozensoul327","Mar 30, 2006"
2.6,-29.3,3,3,2.5,3,2,"As far as drinkability goes, this was a huge disappointment. In fact, I dumped the last third of my glass. Far too honey-sweet and lacking the breadth of character to be anything better than mediocre. Boring and lackluster; I feel seriously ripped off having paid as much as I did. Avoid; I know I will from now on.","Boilermaker88","Mar 23, 2006"
3.58,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"750ml bottle with Dec 05 date on it. Body appears a cloudy golden color with a rapid forming tall foamy white head. Pretty interesting aroma with some light farmy notes and sweet fruits such as pears. Also notes of grain were mixed in. Taste starts with some fruit before the farmy yeast notes come through. Some spiciness peaks in over earthy notes. Some interesting wine like flavors seemed to mix in at times. Finishes up with a spicy sweet flavor. Interesting enough overall to keep you sipping. Good carbonation and crisp feel to it. Easy enough drinking but I doubt I would have more after the 750. Solid brew.","meathookjones","Mar 07, 2006"
3.48,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Hazy light orange with a head plump in size and eloquent in its lacing and texture. Aroma is fairly well balanced between the malt (caramel, bread), hops (herbs) and yeast (barnyard funk) along with a touch of honey, hay, pear skins and peach. In the flavor, the first that strikes me is its resemblence to Affligem Triple in its sweet malt and yeast contribution. Its a bit sweet overall, but it does have a unique rustic character that I enjoy. Notes of honey, light fruits and sugar covered rock candy (pineapple flavored). A pretty good beer that I definately enjoyed.","Crosling","Feb 06, 2006"
3.98,8.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"First impression was of a lager... then quickly it moves into a smooth and creamy apple juice-like flavor on the swallow. Decently complex... not overly so. A nice sweetness on the backend makes this quite enjoyable. I wouldn't rank it a top Saison, not really even close... but easily a very drinkable beer.","Fugazme","Dec 22, 2005"
3.7,0.5,4,4,4,3,3,"All in all, La Choulette blond is an interesting and enjoyable beer which has a lot going on. In its 750ml bottle format I would recommend it to share with a few friends, as its acidity and relatively high alcohol content limits its solo-drinkability factor.","biergeniesser","Nov 26, 2005"
4.37,18.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured a deep amber to a delicate white head with a slight cloudyness. Smell almost resembles tamarind, spicy and fragrant, quite a bouquet. Tastes just as it smells, spicy with an aftertaste that resembles tamarind, very complex with no offensive undertones. Very little carbonation and an aromatic finish make this a very nice christmas beer.","funkengruven","Oct 28, 2005"

4.55,23.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"I'm trying to figure out how they stuff so much beer into this little bottle. First impression is fluffyness, and malt, caramel malt, caramel coated oat rings on a bed of beet greens. There is an odd, distracting, seemingly industrial mix of bitter saccharine that wants you to ignore the rural reduction that flows so easily. Free yourself and embrace it.","inebrius","Aug 23, 2005"

Aroma is sour with some grassy and musty earthy odors. First sip reveals some straw flavor with a little sourness. A small hint of bitterness but very subtle. Mouthfeel is thin. A bit heavier taste than other biere de gardes I tried. Musty flavors with some earthiness. A lot of flavors going on here. They don't all blend together especially well.

Aroma is quite floral but does not seem to contain any spices, as I would have expected. Taste is quite refreshing with some nice floral malt and lingering bitterness at the end.

I can dig this brew, though it doesn't wow me, nor is it designed to...these are meant to be simple, table beers, if I've got it right, and it matches that description ably.

Streams of bubbles rise at a moderate clip to the surface from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is spicy and sweet...doughy and musty. Pretty nice. The flavor is quite earthy and elemental. Some fruity ester like qualities surrface soon enough. A bit of lemon is detected and unrefined hop notes as well. Maybe a little mettalic character too. Lively mouthfeel with a body checking in around medium. Better than average, but I've had better Biere de Gardes.","Bighuge","Aug 02, 2002"
2.7,-26.6,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Leaving the large amount of chunky yeast at the bottom of the bottle, this one pours a mostly clear orangish-gold with a thin and tightly-knit white head. The aroma is malty sweet, with a hefty dose of fruit, most notably peaches. There's a bit of spiciness, along with a slight medicinal phenolic note. Some barnyard yeast as well. The flavor starts out quite sweet, before a peppery spiciness takes hold and attempts, but fails, to keep the honey-like sweetness in check. Like in the aroma, there's some barnyard yeast and musty farmhouse character, but it really gets mauled by the near-cloying sweetness. More medicinal phenolics. Fairly thin on the palate, with a slighty dry finish that has a touch of alcohol both in mouthfeel and flavor. I also detect a hint of a white grape peel flavor and astringency in the aftertaste. Despite the four or five main flavor components, this brew comes as across as thin, lacking in complexity, and overly sweet. Quite the lackluster example of the Bière de Garde style.","MJR","Beers"
