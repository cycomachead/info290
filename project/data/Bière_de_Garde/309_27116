3.46,-8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a 500ml can into a standard pint glass. Beautiful clear copper color with orange hues, bubbles persistently rising from the bottom of the glass with a small (2-finger) off-white head that dissipated but left a slight lacing. Aroma was malty and musty. There was a 'dampness' to the smell that was hard to place; very slight hint of dried fruit, but this was very faint. Flavor was bready with biscuit notes and some yeast character. Very little to no hop presence - definitely a focus on the malt. As the beer warmed, there seemed to be some alcohol warming, somewhat revealing the beer's 7.5%. Medium-light body, effervescent to bubbly on the tongue. Overall, not my favorite style of beer, but shows as a good example of a Biere de Garde. Recommend, especially if you favor malty brews.","kevinglin","Apr 16, 2009"
3.72,-1.1,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"11.2 oz. bottle with no freshness date, unpasteurized, brewed with three malts (including torrified wheat) from Champagne and hops from Alsace; aged for one month before bottling. It pours a sediment-laden orangey amber, with low carbonation, and three fingers of light beige head, receding quickly to a clingy 1/8"" froth that never goes away. Toasted and biscuity malts in the nose, sweet, with notes of caramel, chocolate?, molasses?, a light fruitiness, earthy hops and an acidic twang. It has a complex malt flavor that is nutty/earthy, with caramel and lots of sweetness. Spicy and floral hops cut right through the middle, contributing little bitterness but loads of flavor. There is also a touch of sourness, with fruity esters that lend prunes, white grapes and overripe apples. It has low carbonation, but what is there is fine-bubbled, and helps the beer go down smoothly. Lightly tingly, dry, with a medium malty finish. There is an interesting drinkability - it went down very quickly, but it has a little too much sweetness for prolonged drinking. I tried this one fresh in France, and it was pretty different; tastes like it has aged a bit, but has done so gracefully. I enjoyed this beer very much - it's complex and tasty with no trace of the alcohol, and would complement almost any meal nicely. Definitely worth a try, whether fresh or lightly-aged.","mmmbeer","Mar 05, 2009"

There is also more of a nuttiness and a toasty punch toward the finish, accompanied by some more pungent herbal hop. I get also a tad of orange in the aftertaste.

The smell is sugary raisin bread and honey. The taste is of raisin bread, carob, sugary with a bit of an alcohol burn. No hops detected, nothing that I would describe as earthy to help counter act the sweetness. The feel is flat and slicky, almost syrupy.

Towards the finish a mild bitterness and a dash of alcohol kick in and cut the sweetness. Averagely full body with light carbonation makes for a soft beer.

3.95,5.1,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a clear tawny copper brown with a 1""+ light tan head with good retention and showy Belgian lace. Sweet malts and Belgium cellarlike musty, woodsy aroma that almost become caramel like with warming. Little evidence of hops. The flavors of floral spicey contentental hops are subdued by the soft water profile of this style and a dominate sweet but complex maltyness that quickly looses the sweetness and finishes med-dry with higher alcohol and a almost balance of hop IBUs. Medium body and higher carbonation yield a creamy mouthfel with some warmth from alcohols otherwise well hidden by the malts (Vienna,Munich blended with Pale and possibly some crystal type malts) An extended lagering of the artisanal farmhouse ales helps produce this fairly strong malty character as the lighter hopping fades with longer aginging. Fermented on the lower range of yeast temperatures makes this a great entry level to the higher ABV Belgian styles. IMHO more fit for winter season than Bier de Mars (a similar style)","karst","Jan 08, 2007"

Aromas of wine, musk, grapes, pears, apples and earthyness. Mild sweetness of honey combined with tart lactic acids create crispness and complexity. Not as musky, earthy, or pungent as some other Biere de Gardes. Lighter notes make this beer a better drinker. Finishes dry, tart, and crisp. Light alcohol is woven into the tartness and fades nicely.","BEERchitect","Aug 26, 2005"

Only a couple drops of lace cling to the glass. Sweet fruity nose, very strong of spice and raspberry. The mouth is very light, with subdued carbonation. Very sweet taste, with light fruit dominating. The spice is also sweet, adding to the natural sweetness of the wheat. No noticeable hops. The finish is sugary, while the aftertaste reminds a bit of a raspberry frozen popsicle. Not for me, thanks.","Globetrotter","May 22, 2005"

Whitish head rises above 1/4 of an inch and has average staying power. Simple lacing but a nice spread across the glass. Aroma is spicey, verging on metallic and with ample citrus qualities. Medium body, less carbonation than in some Biere de Gardes. Begins malty, biscuity and sugary lemon bars with powdered sugar frosting, some sweet apple pie. Makes a nod toward drying mid mouth and finishes with some yeasty tones and a very subtle hop. Could tighten up even more for me, the aroma had me thinking a dryer finish was in store. Still, this is a creamy and quaffable brew.","ADR","Jan 10, 2005"

Hard to judge its appearance since I'm not sure what a Biere de Garde is but it poured a nice head and solid lacing. Color of a copper unfiltered wheat.

Aroma of Belgian yeast, sweet malt, and light fruit. Mouthfeel is nice and sturdy, not too thick, not too thin. Palate is very fruity, with essence of peach and grapes, sweet malt, and light floral hops. Yeastiness comes through towards the back of the mouth, along with a bready character. Slightly bitter aftertaste is a bit unpleasant and keeps this from being a more drinkable beer.","ElGordo","Dec 09, 2004"

I get some biscuit maly, somce lemony tartness and a decent bitter on the finish. I don't know about this one. Its not bad, but its weird. The feel is light to moderate, with a nice carbonation on it. Drinkability sufferes from the flavor that I just don't like all that much.

Musty, malty aroma. I almost wonder how long this bottle has been sitting around on the store shelf as it was the dusty sole remaining one. Very musty flavor. Reminds me of a cellar or basement. Some sweet, stale fruitiness. Malt is hard to detect. Hops are mininal at best. Spicy or peppery alcohol near the back of the throat. Not a beer I was opposed to (it went pretty well with dinner) but I think it's an acquired taste.

A medium bodied ale with a soft mouthfeel but slighty rough carbonation. There's some unsual fruity flavors towards the finish that are very interesting.

The flavours themselves - there's a sour hint to the beginning, followed by sweetness, hints of lemon, hops fade in and out. A dry finish leaving the throat crying out for more. A very respectable beer. There's pleasant flavours, nothing is out of proportion and everything is restrained in a wonderful understated harmony.","the42ndtourist","Mar 13, 2003"
