"Fruity nose, not much hop, malt and a touch of pepper. Pours dark amber under a 2” pillowy foam cap. The palate starts with light fruit, pineapple, caramel, pepper and a hint of hops on the finish. Some faint light cardboard flavors suggest the beginning of oxidation.  bottled 10-10-11, above average carbonation, a touch of cardboard on the finish, some light fruit, pepper and a hint of hops on the finish. Medium to medium full body, with average carbonation. A fresher bottle is less sweet and crisper with the fruit tending more towards peach and less pineapple. Much better – do not age."

"Best by 11/15.  Slightly sweeter than Castelain's ""blonde,"" but similarly as delicious."
"After popping the cork caught a nice bready yeast aroma out of the bottle. Had a big foamy off-white head that dissipated after a minute. Color was clear amber. Smelled of malts and a bit of yeast but not much hops. Tasted of malts up front - a bit of skunk (not unpleasant) - with a hint of dark fruit and finished with some hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with fine bubbles but not overly effervescent. Overall very good."

"The beer is light amber colored and transparent with a small off white head. The aroma offers yeast, malt, apples, a splash of white wine. Grape skins and an earthy character. Light in body with fairly low carbonation. A touch of oxidation. Mild hop presence offers a hint of bitterness. Caramel malt and green apples. Pretty easy going."

"O: This beer seems a little maltier compared to others in the style but wasn't that difficult to drink."

"Pours a clear honey brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy chunks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and some citrus aromas. Taste is much the same with some slight caramel flavors as well. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and very easy to drink."
"It's really not that unpleasant to drink, just so uninteresting as to forget to finish the glass. On tap at Neighborhood in San Diego."
"Very enjoyable. My first venture in the style. I will try others."
""
"There’s a funky aroma to it that's contrasted with a lightness on the palate. Bit of a funky funk finish, but overall not terribly complex and not one I’d try again for the price. Pass."

"Notes: Nice sweet-funk flavors, but not dynamic. The beer does get much better and more balanced as it warms, however, and I had to give this some time to start to appreciate it. I'm fairly new to this style and this is a classic so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now."
"D-malt foward and simple, nothing wrong with it but nothing at all that makes me want to come back."
"Drinkability: Sways a bit to the sweet side for a beer of this style, but still has a nice balanced character; a rather unusual flavor profile and a beer well worth seeking out"
"Delicious and strong, this aged Belgian Amber Ale is often misunderstoon and unfortunately so- Though a Saison-like brightness and dryness is prefered, this on falls just on the sweeter side of the dominant beers of its style."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body. there was plenty of zip but finished smooth."
"Drinkability: Excellent. Could be classified as an amber ale, but its much more full. A great beer."
"d: ok; very mild; could be good with some good foods; worth a try and could make a good pairing"
"Overall, run of the mill and a fair representation of the style. Not a stand out in my mind, but good in its own right. The price was great if that makes up for anything. $5 for the 750ml."
"D- I bought this a year ago and have cellared it until now. I just wished I had opened this sooner. Nice on a cold day, but I imagine this to be great on a fall evening as well. Don't let the ""slightly sour"" scare you away."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a rich copper color with a fluffy off-white head that settled into a nice cap. The aroma is quite faint, I pick up some buttery caramel malt. The taste is very smooth, what I expect a Biere de Garde to taste like. A nice caramel malt with the slightest hint of butter along with some mineral/rust flavors and low bitter hops. The brew has a moderate feel with airy carbonation, finishes malty sweet but in no way cloying, again very smooth. A very good example of the style. The flavors don't blow me away, typical of the style, but this seems to be one of the better samples of the style."
"I don't remember what I paid for this. If I saw it again for $10 or less, I'd grab it in a second."
"Great, authentic stuff..."
"Overall, Wow! Biere de Garde has never been a favorite sytle of mine, but this one could totally turn that around. Many Biere de Gardes just have that slight something that if changed would make it great. Well, this one has that something. A great Biere de Garde."
"MF&D - goes down very smooth, not much carbonation. a good medium body drink, though overall I would say it is ineffectual."
"D- Not impressed."
"St. Amand French Country Ale. Pour is phenomenal; a cloudy orange-amber with a massive off-white head. Sadly, the rest of the beer doesn't live up to this. Aroma is floral and earthy, with some hay. Taste is one-dimensional. All caramel malt and bread. Flat mouthfeel. Very boring beer."
"This beer is darkened copper with an exuberant head. The smell is malty and sweet with a mild hop character. The flavor is tart lemons and some acceptable but uninteresting malt. The blend of flavors is pleasant, but the beer is somewhat disappointing overall. My score seems a bit high considering I wouldn't recommend it. The beer is too sweet and watery for me. Ultimately, the malt flavor is somewhat uninteresting. On the other hand, this is the kind of beer that I would enjoy trying in its home country."
"smooth. fluffy, moderate carbonation"
"Bought this refrigerated at the local bevmo. The deep amber hue nicely accompanies the lightly effervescent brew. Very lightly hopped and not as sweet as a Belgian. The wife liked the nose. Liked it but for the price would head towards a similarly priced Belgian dubbel."
"d - highly drinkable."
"Serving type: bottle"
"A pour of this is OK, but one is enough."
"D - The malt flavors are powerful, and while they are accurate to the style, they border on overpowering and kind of hurt the drinkability of the beer. Aside from malt, there is not much going on here, and I would like to see a bit more complexity in a farmhouse beer."
"If you see this dull-looking bottle on the shelf, buy it."
"Pours a dark amber in the tulip with a frothy top. Light aroma with some citrus and hop tones. A floral, malty start that continues throughout. Hops are subtle which gives it a pleasant sweetness. It's a citrus texture on the mouthfeel. This would probably go great as a desert beer after some sushi."
"Verdict: A complex ale that doesn't fail. I have no idea why I was avoiding it all along. The best example I've had so far of this style."
"Served from the bottle(750ml), this pours a hazy reddish amber color, with a small white head that dissipates quickly and minimal lacing on the glass. The smell is slight but malty. The taste is complex, with lots of frutiy flavors present, especially cherry and raisin, along with a toffee or butterscotch maltiness. This beer is suitably rich in flavor, yet light on the tongue. This beer is comparitively light in alcohol(5.9%ABV)for the style, and is very drinkable. This is a very nice brew and worth getting if you can find it."
"D, notes: I like this beer and would go for it again. Complex yet easy to drink."
"Sort of lacking in overall depth. Thin on the mouthfeel. Tangy, sweet, slight hop bitterness, plenty of caramel malty flavors. Light and refreshing but a little thin on the mouthfeel. Finishes dry as a bone and exceptionally clean on the palate. A good sessioner Id say."
"750 mL from the Hendersonville Co-op. Also easily found at Bruisin Ales in Asheville. St. Amand pours a handsome -- no, gorgeous -- copper color with plenty of generous head, even when poured slowly. The nose is extremely complex -- clay soil, caramel, butter, farmland, and fresh aromatic hops are all in there, along with some more elusive intangibles that are conjuring up all sorts of images of rural Europe for me. On the tongue, the caramel sings out with a spritzy edge, the hops keep it interesting, and the butter moves to the forefront, but what really does it for me is a slight sour twist towards the end -- reminiscent of those Flemish Ales that Ive recently fallen in love with (such as Duchesse de Bourgogne). This says to me, ""drink with food!"" Much better than Castelian/Chti, as far as Im concerned. Take it for Thanksgiving Dinner."
"Drinkability- Not bad at all. Nothing jumps out as being great or spectacular, but definitely quaffable and quite easily sessionable I'm sure. Always hesitant by trying French brews, but in this case they proved me wrong."
"[750ml bottle, poured in a mug]"
"Mouthfeel had a bit more fullness to it than I would have though by simply looking at it. It is certainly full bodied and rather heavy, all things considered, anyway. Nevertheless, I found it quite drinkable and will certainly pick up another 2 or 3 750's to have on hand. A lovely surprise, indeed."
"Drinkability- This is a great drinker, not too big with alcohol, malty enough to have enough balance. If this came in 6 packs I would drink this again and again. Beer for keeping, but good fresher as well."
"I guess I would call this a drinkable, sweet, session style beer. Not my cup of tea though."
"An interesting beer, but not one that I will likely try again. It is OK but rather expensive and just not that spectacular a beverage."
"Overall: Ive really been getting into saisons of late, and this one is a nice take on a light summer drinking ale. A bit darker and hoppier than a saison, still, very good in its own right. Id have no reservations buying several more of these to sip on a hot day."
"On a side note, on doing some research on Bénifontaine, France where this beer is made, it is interesting to note that it is brewed in a very small town in Northern France with a total population of 278 (1999)."
"i'm not going to write home about it but if i were in europe and discovered this pouring from casks in a small cafe i would never leave (perhaps that really isn't about the beer)"
"I prefer this one to a lighter biere de garde such as Jenlain or Gavroche, even Castelain blond. Now if I was cooking... there is a lot to be done with a pale saison-style ale (pork chops anyone?), while St. Amand might overload the caramelized flavor. Save this one for sipping, and enjoy thoroughly. For the style, this one is dark to me, and I'm loving every bit of it. Reminiscent of an ESB with characteristic Belgian touches. If anything, I would rate this higher in the future, but none of the individual characteristics leapt out at me."
"Overall drinkability is average for me... but I don't think I'd turn it down... I do like the nose quite a bit."
"Drinkability: Depends; could be ""refreshing"" or ""bland"" depending on your expectations. I was hoping for a bit more character, but it was pleasant enough, and a fairly good value."
"It is an enjoyable beer."
"My favorite of the style (to date) is Jenlain, and this one is very similar, perhaps a bit lighter in mouthfeel and in flavor intensity. Good stuff."
"Drinkability: I am not a fan of this ale, the malts are too strong and the wild tastes I'd expect from a biere de garde/saison is nowhere to be found."
"My girlfriend likes it , so I probably will buy it again...and who knows , maybe the next one will have a bit more to it."
"I was, for some reason, not ready to be impressed by this beer. But I was pleasantly surprised! A great summer beer that shouldn't be saved for summer alone."
"The body is pale and thin, and like the taste, it sorely lacks the structure malt should provide. It is certainly downable, but in the wake of classics like 3 Monts, La Baviasienne, or even Castelain's namesake biere des garde, this seems pretty vapid and unispired."
"Overall, this beer has some of the qualities of a quad, combined with a much lighter style and therefore is somewhat of an enigma. Nice beer, worth the fun and effort in reviewing it."
"I'm not sure if my bottle was old, or what, but I picked up some very different things than the other reviewers. The nose was very pleasant, with hints of fruit, coriander and lots of sherry. The taste reminded me of a Flanders Red Ale that I have had, except that the flavor was only about 1/3 as strong. There were other flavors in there as well: maltiness, maybe the slightest hint of saaz, and the classic Belgian esters. This beer was fantastic, and if it was a fluke, it would be too bad. I'll try it again if I ever run across it."
"Pours a deep orange with a big fluffy head that leaves a light amount of lace,aroma is light and herbal with some grassiness a real hop presence for sure along with some dry biscuit.Very solid a straight to the point in flavor dry cracker like flavors with a minty/herbal finish that lingers nicely I also notice just a little sweet caramel intermingling in there as well but its light.A very nice ale a easy quaffer glad I tried it."
"A good, tasty beer, not complex but an excellent session brew, or a simple and flavorful accompaniment to dinner."
"A bit thin bodied I thought, but refreshing and very drinkable with the appropriate meal...."
"The St. Amand is another winner for me."
"First glass is clearish, later ones are barely sedimented, odd. Light chestnut color with a good pale yellow head that doesn't last long though. Cottony thin string lacing on the glass. Piquant kind of aroma, almost candied cherry and rummy. Light body with generous carbonation. Very fruity -- berry-like in early impression. Switches to a more classic maltier tone later in the sip, reminding me of maple sugar. Thin but distinct metallic hop at the end, lingering into the aftertaste. A number of flavors are going on here, kind of a wild and wooly brew."
"From a caged and corked 750 ml bottle, it's amber with a somewhat fizzy off-white head that goes away quickly, leaving no trace of lace. The smell is barnyard funk and just a trace of fruity sweetness. This has a light flavor, with a fair balance between light sweetness and a touch of bitterness on the finish. It's very dry and satisfying. It paired well with some spicy Haitian chicken and beans and rice."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a thick 1"" off-white head, over a clear, copper brew. Big bits of foam lace throughout the drinking experience. A slight sour aroma accompanies the malt and hops smells, making for an interesting orchestra. Taste is primarily of the medium (caramel) malt, but a hops crispness is present throughout. Mouthfeel is somewhat effervescent, but the overall package seems to work quite well. Disappointing only to see that this brew isn't more widely enjoyed by the masses."
"This beer is lightly hazy and has a copper color. The head is a light tan color. I get an aroma of cider, and as I go deeper into the aroma I get lots of fruity apple scents as well as a background of graininess, and a light herbal character. The beer produces a large head, but the carbonation is relatively light. This is mainly a light refreshing beer. Up front it has a bit of sweetness, which, carries throughout the taste profile. Tastes of caramel, cider, a bit of astringency, and a bit of plum. Quite clean overall, basically this is quite simplistic and straight forward. A nice, refreshing beer."
"Another interesting French brew from Castelain. 750ml bottle, pop the cork and pour. A nice murky golden liquid is presented with quite the large, fluffy white head. Aromas are of belgian malts, and subtle hops on the finish. The taste is mostly malty with some spiciness and citrus fruit appearance in the middle and on the end. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is nice. A good brew, but one of the least complex I have had in this style."
"In a tall belgian bottle with a flip top, it poured a dark red amber color and formed a small foamy offwhite head that left trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, citrus and caramel. A flavor of malt, citrus and caramel. Fairly light body for this style but rather refreshing with a light finish. Not a bad beer, but more of a session style."
"Generous pop from the swing-top Grolsch-style lid. Poured a pale coppery-orange highlighted with effervescent whitish head. Left a nice lacing in the glass when finished. Rather weak aroma compared to some other biere de gardes I've tried. Solid qualities reside in the malty flavor mixed with herbal undertones with a slightly tart and zesty finish. Definitely better in the flavor than aroma. Worth a shot if you've never tried it."
"Smooth on the tongue and the malt lingers on the tongue for a short few seconds, which I didn't expect with the heavier body."
"Enjoyable and a fairly easy drinker for style."
"Flavor starts out mild, wine-like, and the flavor just explodes midway through the sip. A strange nuttiness, big fruity belgian candi flavor, surprising hop presence, altogether pleasant. This is a hard beer to forget. Finish is rich and sticks to your tongue. I was tasting this beer even through the beer I had right after this one. Maybe I was just remembering it. It was quite splendid, sir. My only complaint was that the carbonation was so intense, and it was sort of filling. Great taste, less filling."
"The beer pours a translucid gold color, the head prodigious and spumescent, the lace is a fine covering of the glass, both a bright white. Dominated my the malt, citrus crisp or somewhat lemon like, fresh and pleasant, start has a distinct malt feel, lightly sweet, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Potently acidic, the hops understated but noticeable and the after taste as dry as they come. Drinkable and something worth a try, for the Belgian lovers."
"Hazy chestnut color. Loosely gathered foam head settles to a steady layer. Aroma is fruity largely consisting of apple, raisins and plum. In combination with the steady carbonation, the flavors and crisp texture create a complex array. Sweet, tart and fruity notes freely shift about the palette. Theres also some woody notes and the yeast imparts an underlying musty, farm character. A fine French country ale and a delicious brew."
"An easily forgettable beer. This beer had the unlucky position of being rated following the Stone Imperial Stout (no beer should follow that rating)."
"This is the first brew i've tasted from Brasserie Castelain and i enjoyed it a great deal. It poured a hazy dark ruby in color with a off white rocky head that faded to a thick ring. A crisp clean candy aroma is like no other i've smelt before. The sweet fruity taste seemed the same from begining to end. A little thin bodied but quite drinkable at 5.9%."
"750 mL flip top bottle. Dark amber with big head which vanishes. If you ask me, this beer is identical to Ruddles County Ale. Rich, malty, sweet, delectable. Heavy apple cider qualities, chewy, a tiny dead bit of alcohol in the middle. A mild dryness and a little bit of spice denotes the hops. Nothing to discern it as French or even Belgian. No present yeast; I guess it had already done its job by the time it was bottled. I swear, it tastes just like Ruddles. Which is fine by me, Ruddles is one of my favorite beers. Just not what I expected from a biere de garde. Perhaps its a fraction sweeter, and lacking the creamy British mouthfeel. Anyway it's damn good. Maybe even tastier than Ruddles."
"In my first review, I merely rounded it up as a French Alpha King...nowadays, I say ""not quite, but almost""....I still like it lots, though..."
"Light amber with a medium head.  Sweet sugary and candy like aroma with a hint of caramel, very simple.  Sweetness up front followed by dry finish.  Profile is llike sugar, not rich malt.  Complex musky undertones, raw dirt character.  Very slight metalic hop in finish.  Very disapointing.Ranks 4th out of 5 Bier de Gardes tasted during the same session."
"Hazy garnet hue, covered by a light tan uniformly thick, creamy head that leaves intricate lace.  The aroma is a combination of mild bubblegum esters, acidic sweet kiwi - like fruitiness and powdery, dry cocoa, w/ an undertone of acetaldehyde and yeast must.  Maple sugar like sweetness in flavor is ensued by biscuit malt and light carob.  Esters complement the malt profile to yield a dark, mellow, fig like fruitiness.  The light hop bitterness is well integrated and perfectly offsets residual sweetness without interfering with the malt profile.  Moderately bodied, w/ a creamy smooth mouthfeel that belies the relatively low strength.  Finishes w/ a hint of toasty malt and bittersweet chocolate, but clean otherwise.  St. Amand is truly a delicious brew.  The overall balance and depth of character is stunning, considering the relatively low strength (5.9% ABV)  Superlative drinkability due to its lightness on the palate-- It's a joy to drink. Reminescent of a dubbel / brown ale hybrid."
