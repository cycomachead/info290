The smell was nothing to write home about; a little bit of hop and light sweet malt, but really not a lot in this department. I really enjoyed the flavor of this beer, as did my wife. Great balance of hop and malt, swaying ever so slightly toward the hops. Light, floral, and just a little citrusy. The mouthfeel was decent; a little too sharp for a great rating, but certainly pleasant. Overall, we really enjoyed it.

Aromas of soft pilsner malts, lemons (among more citrus fruits), apricots, pineapples, white grapes, apples, and pears. Very estery needless to say. Peppery phenolics give a depth to the aroma with white pepper, clove, and ginger. A subtle grandma's-attic, dusty, yeasty, somewhat funky reminds me that we definately have an artisnal Belgian on our hands. Flavors also focus on the fruits. While following up on the spices, tartness, and funky flavors from the wild yeast. The beer never slides over to the barnyard character that the style can sometimes bring, but they are not as clean as a Flying Dog, Garde Dog either.

The taste has a hint of malt up front, followed by a pungent hops that is fragrent but not bitter. It does have a very smooth finish. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with a creamy feel to it, not too shabby really. It's drinkability is decent, but nothing to write home about. It masks the alcohol well, but the finish is a bit too floral and dry. To sum it up, this is one of the best beers I've tried in France, which is to say its like the sexiest of your cousins.

4.21,16.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"One of the reasons I like it is perhaps its stronger flavor. Its full flavor also does a great job (quite artistic, really) of masking the alcohol content, which is deceptively strong (7.2%). It has many characteristics of a good continental lager, even though it is "biére de haute fermentation," as if it were taking the flavor to a new level beyond what is possible in bottom fermentation. This style seems to be typical of many micro-brews from northern France, a regional style that deserves some respect even with its proximity to the beer Mecca of Belgium. The flavor has some brut apple overtones (faintly reminiscent of the great brut ciders from Normandy and Brittany) and a lingering aftertaste that turns a bit sour and metallic (a definite "I was here" statement from the beer). The smell is quite representative of the flavor, though quite a bit milder. The mouthfeel is more viscous and sticky than most other beers from France, and is definitely not light. It is not very gaseous, though with the right food the bubbles seem to come forth more readily. The color is deep gold, turning to an orange-ish hue in the shade, and shining brilliantly in sunlight. Upon pouring, the head has a fairly uniform distribution of medium-sized bubbles, and tends to migrate to the edge of the glass with a few islands of smaller bubbles left in the middle that are replenished from below. The outer bubbles stick to the glass upon tilting it, and make a pleasant mosaic pattern.","Socrates","Mar 15, 2006"

Taste is pretty good, not complex, but ending with a slight sweetness coupled with a slight metallic twang. Full bitterness ensues but it never really coats the tongue the way most Belgian beers do. Now, I don't claim that this is a Belgian beer, nor do I claim that the French are experts at brewing beer. Still, this is a pretty good beer, and, were it lower in alcohol, would make a great session beer. Well, it makes a great session beer regardless.

A bit sugaary aswell. Some herbal hops, but not as much as i like. dissapointing. I thought this was a biere de garde/ not a lager/pils as listed above,","rastaman","Beers"
