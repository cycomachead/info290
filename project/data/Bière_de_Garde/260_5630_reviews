"Large format bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a golden amber hue with some fizzy off-white head that starts off billowing but quickly settles into a more manageable two fingers or so. Smells like rock candy, floral perfume, lemon rind, vinous fruit like champagne perhaps, straw-like musty hops. Palate is similarly light and floral, with some orchard fruit skin (apricot and nectarine), sour white grapes, sweet corn flakes, and more lemon discernible. The malts, yeast, and hops present in a simple, no frills fashion and I was expecting more complexity. Had to check the label to ensure I was indeed drinking and reviewing this brewer's ""amber"" offering. Yep. Not getting much in the way of caramel malt flavor. Light to moderate body and moderate carbonation. Finishes vinous and dry. Bit of an enigma ... Maybe my bottle was old. Would investigate further should an opportunity present."
"Medium-plus body, creamy carb, apricot jam finish."

"O - I fear I may have had this one too long. I expected more spiciness in the smell and taste. It is still enjoyable and actually refreshing. I will have to revisit this one with a fresher sample to see if I screwed up."

"O: A very interesting and true to style Biere de Garde. Sweet malt and slight booze balance very well and make for a very satisfying complex and unique flavors. If you see this beauty try t, you will not be disappointed and will be intrigued by its subtitle uniqueness and french farmhouse character."
"Pours out a light copper amber with a thin, white head. Smells of caramel malts, light booze, slight biere de garde mustiness, and not much else. Pretty subdued. Flavor is fairly faint as well. The simple character of the malts, caramel and toasty, is not what bothers me, rather the lightness of flavor. A bit boozy. I get a touch of fruit in the yeast. Finishes with a touch of bitterness. Flavor is a bit sticky with some lightly prickly carbonation. Overall, I'm enjoying the beer, but it lacks in presence like other stuff from this brewery."

"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a huge white head that persists forever leaving copious amounts of lace on the way down my glass. Pear and plum with pepper and sweet sugar make up the bulk of the aroma. A light mineral and yeastiness rounds out the nose. The flavor is sweeter than I thought with the honey like and bready pilsner malt shining through. Light pitted fruits a touch of warming and a hint of pepper round it all out. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Nice brew, if it weren't a country tick I never would have picked it up, but I'm glad I did, I rather enjoyed it."

"Overall: I bought this beer on a whim, knowing nothing at all about it. I am so glad I found it -- this is a delicious treat from start to finish."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 11 20 printed on the back label (best before date?). Pours lightly cloudy golden orange color with a nice 3 finger fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big pear, grape, citrus zest, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, earth, grass, hay, light funk, bread, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of pear, apple, citrus zest, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, hay, earth, bread, light funk, light honey, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, hay, grass, herbal, floral, earth and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; nice spicy/malt flavor balance; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Biere De Garde! Great flavor balance and complexity; very smooth to sip on for 8.3%. This is extremely crisp and delicious stuff."

"8.3% ABV. per bottle label."
"Overall a really nice smooth Bière de Garde. Aside from less carbonation, not vastly different from the golden ale version."

"Feels like an average beer, very wet. But the yeast and alcohol create an interesting effect; if you rub your tongue againt the roof of your mouth it feels like wet paper."

"O - This is a pretty good biere de garde. A nice value."
"There is something here, need fresh."
"The beer is transparent and yellow hued, with 1/2"" or so of white head and some decent lacing. The aroma brings grain, wet cardboard, apples, alcohol. In general, it just seems a bit off. The taste brings some odd funk, apples soaked in booze, and grain. Mouthfeel is decent, assuming you can get past the odd flavors and imbalanced nature of this unusual beer. Overall, not a repeat for me."
"Pours a clear golden color with an average, fizzy white head and some spotty lacing. Thin cap throughout. The nose is light and smells mostly like pilsener malt. Light cardboard and bread. Very grainy. The flavor is quite grainy as well. Light body and no contribution from yeast or hops. Fizzy carbonation and a dry finish. Not my cup of tea."
"o - Overall I wasn't too impressed with this beer. Didn't hate it as much as most, but wouldn't seek it out again."
"Beer is medium bodied and has a grassiness to it that seems like an off-flavor but I don't mind it much. There is a mildly dry finish with some partially sweet beginnings. The overall experience is nice but I don't think I'd have it again, especially not in front of anyone else due to overwhelming amounts of shame."
"O- a very nice beer from a more obscure style. one that i would like to lay down for a bit to see if more of the wild flavors come out."
"O - It's a French tick, so that's something. The beer is not bad, and the alcohol is well hidden. Not something I'd go after again though with better options always available."
"D - It's not the most interesting beer, but it's quite easy to drink considering the ABV. Probably better for pairing with a spring feast than for consumption on its own. Nothing something I'd bother with again, but a pretty painless way to knock of France if you're into collecting countries on here."
"This has improved immensely as it warmed up-- at first I was thinking it would be a C- or so... This is tasty enough and complex enough to enjoy-- although this is probably not a beer I will be buying."
"Overall a wonderfully complicated beer from begining to end."
"D-Not bad. Different than I expected. I would drink this again."
"3 Monts (3 Mountains) Grande Reserve Special Ale is a quality biere de garde that can't hold a candle to its non-Reserve sibling. It's still an easy recommendation for those who have any interest whatsoever in the style. Sante!"
"3 Monts Grande Réserve Spécial Ale defines style and grace in a beer. This simply blew me away. Definitely keep an eye out for this release."
"From the 25 fl. oz. bottle with a mark of 11-20. I am not enthralled by the metal ring that holds the cork. I had to pull out a screwdriver to get it off. It was not terribly convenient. However, once I made it through that process I was presented with a beer that poured golden yellow with great clarity, about three inches of frothy head and good carbonation and lacing. The aroma boasts a wheat element and a vague spiciness akin to a Belgian Abbey Ale. The body is creamy and bold. The taste was generally on the mellow side with a bountiful wheatiness, creamy maltiness, and a dry hopped ending. A pretty good beer altogether."
"Notes: A delightful Biere de garde! Excellent example of the style - clean, crisp, & refreshing. Flavorful but not cloying. ABV is well hidden."
"Overall a nice subtle beer, no big flavors, no ""wow"" factor."
"i usually revisit this one every fall, but just really had a craving for it, so I opened one up on this hot summer night. Benchmark for what I consider strong biere de guarde. Amber with an off-white head that holds very well and leaves some lace as it goes. nose is malt, lime and honey (to me) followed by spice and grain and sweet grain and spicy grain and must and barn and a hint of rum soaked raisins and of course the sylvestre signature relatively hoppy euro-hoppiness... taste is complex and well balanced and i'm really seeing the similarity to its belgian counterparts. it's almost like a semi-sweet, darker, roastier and spicier saison. medium body with a nice slight pricklyness and dry, warming sensation in the finish. very well done. extra drinkability points for it's food pairing capabilities. great reference point for learning about the style."
"Drinkability - Southampton is the only other brewer I've found that could match up with the quality of this offering and that effort is very non-traditional. The subtlety and balance of this French version makes this a classic. Highly, highly recommended for anyone seeking out the style and especially for a first-timer."
"A mellow and enjoyable beer of this style. Pretty tasty, but not overwhelming. I've got some goat cheese here and will partake of both immediately!"
"The palate opens with a moderate hop character, more than I remember the regular 3 Monts having, quite herbal and mildly lemony, a little grassy too. There's a delicate undercurrent of spice through the palate, with a little pepper, along with a light honey, mildly floral, all of which are carried by a delicate bready character. Dry with earthy hops on the finish, this has a lingering light spice character. Light in body with high carbonation, this is quite prickly on the tongue, just a touch more than I'd like. The finish is wonderful, though. This really is a beer that I would love to serve at a meal. Excellent stuff"
"D: This beer is very easy to drink as the alcohol is completely masked. It would go well with food because none of the flavors are very dominating."
"Had a tough time opening this bottle with a plastic covered metal staple protecting a deeply embedded cork. Had this one with Hyland and Moxley. Poured into a tulip glass a golden straw color with white bubbly inch of head that reduces to a solid sheen with heavy lacing. Had an orange, grass and spicy nose. Light fruit spice and Belgian yeast flavor, light and dry without a strong alcohol taste considering the 8.5%. Very, very drinkable with a crisp clean dry feel."
"The experience of drinking this beer was: inhale some amazingly diverse and good aromas, get flavor that goes from bland to bad to okay, settle into an unremarkable, somewhat too sugary but decent beer. High to lower, to lower, to blah. Not what I want from a moderately expensive bottle of beer."
"Belgian bomber w/o freshness info. Plastic covering a cork, kept in place by a metal bar, interesting task to get this baby open. Pours clouded light orangy amber, under a lovely, airy, long lasting off white head. Leaves thick blobs of nice looking lace. Nice looking beer. Faint nose, I got just a wee whiff of some musty and some light flowery fruitiness. Delicate Biere de garde, notes of light pepper, honey, leafy hops. Quite drying finish. Love the style. Enjoyed this one, but it seemed a bit on the tame side. I'd prefer more of a flavor punch, maybe I have been drinking too much San Diego style DIPA lately..."
"a copper gold with an off yellow head. a rather assertive carbonation that burns the tongue. i suppose i would recommend a heavy pour. a nice sweet ester honey and belgian sugar cane sweet. fruit, piney cellar crisp, and quite dry on the tongue. mint coriandar, licorice. a nice herbal. nice a cellar temp."
"I love this beer - it is very drinkable and has a lot of flavor."
"At $10 a bottle, i'd choose Jolly Pumpkin over this every time."
"Really nice easy drinker, nice heavy mouthfeel, dryness is great, wow, keep it coming. Just doesn't have a funk, but that's OK, otherwise I'd put a 5 up. Easy drinker by itself, with some lunch food, with cookies, with anything, it's a great treat. Wow."
"Thanks again Joe for another real treat!"
"Ps the bottle is very hard to open..."
"A real farmhouse. Horseblanket aroma with beige head. Tasty and drinkable biere de garde. Grassy, grainy, sweet start and bitter but balanced finish. Understated carbonation, and grainyness with some creaminess. Not the best but still a good example of the style, and a superior French effort."
"D: I really liked this beer. Had an ultrafine balance that only comes from superb craftsmanship. You dont make a beer this delicate on dumb luck. Highly recommended."
"The taste is intricate yet mild, which is not a knock against the beer. Some organic, earthy notes are immediately present, something along the lines of wood or grass. It is balanced by a sweet butterscotchy/vanilla note. The carbonation makes for a light feel on the palate which is a definite aid to the taste. Great drinkability, great beer. Well done France, well done..."
"Drinkability - This beer will knock you over if you don't respect it. The 8% ABV will remind you however. This is one smooth brew that is exceedingly well balanced and would have you quickly reaching for another, and another. Well done on this one!!"
"Bottled in 2000  drank in 2004  The bottle opened with a big swish and poured a light brownish beer with a huge bubbly head with excellent retention. Aroma of alcohol with a mix of spice. Carbonation is perfect with lots of bubbles coming back on top of my glass. Taste is a mix between a strong Belgian ale with a mix of a good well aged port. The alcohol is mostly sensible in the aroma but undetectable form the taste. Overall, this is a beer that aged well and is true to the name bière de garde."
"This beer poured an light amber color with a massive head that I had to keep scooping out with a spoon or else it was going to run out all over the counter. The smell was malty with notes of fruit, caramel and bread yeast. Taste was impressive, with flavors of caramel, jolly rancher candies, fruit, yeast and Belgian candi sugar. I could notice some alcohol bite as the beer warmed. This beer was medium bodied and very easy to drink, almost a dessert in itself. It reminded of a lighter version of a Dubbel. Who knew that the French could make such a tasty biere? Recommended."
"At times it made me think of biting into a caramel apple."
" A tasty Biere de Garde. It has a wide array of flavors and aromas, with an emphasis on earthiness. Well-balanced, complex and very drinkable."
"The taste had a monent of vanilla goodness wuth a citrus finish."
"D-This beer has a very soft yet complex flavor to it. The malt is really the star of the show and there is not a great deal of yeasty characteristics. Very well built and nice maltyness but a good session beer."
"Dark orange with a nice head of off-white foam that leaves decent lacing. Fresh raw, floral, leafy, green, oily, acidic hops are the main aroma note. I also get white pepper and some funky yeast notes as well. Taste is spicy with yeasty pepper notes and hops. Caramel and doughy bready malts take hold in the middle before the dry spicy hoppy finish blows away your buds. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little brash, but spot-on. Drinkability remains intelligently beautiful. Another marvelous creation from these French farm house masters!"
"This is my second BDG. Oro de Calabeza was my first, but I thought it was a BSPA at the time. The ""farmhouse"" aromas are interesting."
"Medium bodied, amply carbonated, and dryly satisfying. Would make an excellent pairing with chesses, crisp fruit, and figs."
"Pours a light amber color with lots of haze and a moderate head that leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. Spicy and lemony Belgian aroma. Nice. The flavor is quite grainy but also has a slight hop presence and a very light, but fulfilling body. Drinkability is dangerously good on this one."
"This beer was left at my house a long time ago, and its about time to drnk it. The beer pous a hazy, paly golden color with a 3 finger head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is rather nice. There is a zesty lemony citrusy character along with a spicey belgian type character, almost a spicey hop quality. The flavor is really nice. It gives me a floral, flowery essence, with a slightly grainey character behind it. This is a hint of wood in there as well, slighty tanninish. The feel is moderate to thick, with a kight carb. Overall, a rather nice beer. I will definately look for this in the future."
"Very quaffable. Will buy again for some special dinners."
"Pours a hazed, copper-amber color, that sits beneath a frothy light tan head that creates a wispy Belgian Lace as it subsides. The aroma is spicy, fruity and malty with notes of apples, ginger, pear, caramel, vanilla, and toasted malt. This has quite the classic Bier De Garde nose, predominantly malty with nice complimentary notes of fruit and spice. This beer is well carbonated, it foams effervescently as it hits my tongue for the first time. The taste is sweet up front with nice fruity notes of apples, but then moves to a sharp prickly mix of carbonation, ginger and alcohol. This beer is quite good, though because of its strength, it does have tell tale notes of alcohol in the finish, which detracts a little bit."
"taste the straw, the hay; dry grasses, and greener forage. Green grapes. Orange notes. Light and balanced. Very subtle malting to my taste, a touch of sweet. There's a nip of a hop profile. Very refreshing, and drinkable."
"Deep orange, darker than expected, murky. Light white head. Big off-dry aroma comes out musty. Its fruitier than most bière de garde with this dried mango, orange and peach flavour profile. Yet its just as rustic with this old cellar counterpart, lots of fluffy mustiness in there, notes of ashes, cask wood, uncleaned fireplace, hay Nice range. Dry dusty palate, never very sweet, yet fruity. Spicy, feeling green (chive). It has a slight lactic bite to it mysteriously. Notes of bubblegum, smoke, cement. I guess what I like the most is how the yeast planes over the rest of the flavours. Big carbonation, medium body. Good, but no cigar.. and I expected one. Cheers TAR!"
"Cloudy amber body with a huge frothy head of chunky white foam. Sweet malty aroma, fruity and light. Flavor is strongly hopped and dry. Peppery, spicy taste over an earthy base. Aftertaste is a bit musty, a bit unpleasant. The beer is fairly light in body with plenty of carbonation. I think the original is better."
"Tastes very much like a Biere De Garde with a little bit of a tripel aspect as well. An elaborate fruitiness is present providing notes of orange and pear along with a light hoppiness and notes of toasted malt and caramel. The yeast reminds of Dupont. Tasty."
"Palates weaned on Belgian Tripel may find this too sharp and quick on the tongue. My only doubt is about the bottles closure. Im certain (after tasting a batch of Golden Ale that had been laid on its side for a month) that this composite cork only does bad things to liquid, imparting an unattractive mustiness that can blur with, well, an attractive mustiness that is essential to the style."
"Backwash: One of the finest beers in the world (definitely top 20 for me), and vastly underrated (or under-known). I drank this particular example back-to-back with a regular 3 Monts. Frankly, I dont find the differences that substantial. Id compare the relationship between the Grand Réserve and the standard offering as the difference between an extra brut and a brut Champagne (although both are less dry than typical Champagnes). Stock up, this is one of the best cellaring candidates and one of the greatest bargains out there. Sublime."
"3 Monts Grande Reserve Speciale Ale was served from a difficult 750ml corked and clamped bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a hazy orange-caramel hue, and was topped by a rich, thick, stiff, and resiliant light tan head that left sheets and smatterings of sticky lacing. Decadent currents of musty dried apricots, cloves, piney resinous hops, and luxurious scotch wafted from the glass, serving to invigorate my senses. On the palate, I experienced a world of intruiging and wonderful flavors that were related to the nose ... dried turkish apricots soaked in oakey red wine, grass, rosiness, and licorice. These flavors swirled and bounced with joy on the taste buds while the fantastic sweeping tannic dry lime bitter finish rolled through, leaving lingering vinous apricot notes. I was very impressed by the balance and composition of all of this. The full smooth body and the semi-fluffy carbonation were matched well with the flavors and personality of this beer. The deliciousness, balance, and dryness of this brew made it very easy to drink...for the style. Full-flavored, charismatic, and captivating... a highly recommend acquistion."
"The show was, however. Popping the cork allowed the bottle to spew its contents in just about every direction. Forceful carbonation. Rusty orange color with a huge, epic head. Fruity aroma catches your attention from anywhere nearby. Tall grass fields and flowering shrubs. Very earthy and dank feeling. Lots of yeast flavors in this, I think. Burnt sugars seem to squash the interesting fruit flavors around mid-palate -- the flavor of carmelized scrapings from the bottom of a baking pan. Still quite drinkable and pretty good -- but this isn't nearly as great as the original in my opinion."
"Again, thanks to jcalbi, long may he reign..."
"After getting past the interesting cork arrangement the beer poured a very pretty honey color with a rocky, eggshell head. The aroma consisted of sweet malt, and peppery, perfumey hops. Before it warmed up a bit alcohol was too big of a flavor. Once it warmed everything fell into place. Bread and honey on the palate and some wood (American oak) as well. While not very sweet at all, it finishes even drier. Very complex beer and beautifully crafted. My review surely does not do it justice. Im glad the store was out of the regular 3 Monts, and I had the extra dollar to spend on this one."
"Here's an interesting French offering. My first biere de garde, 3 Monts proved to be a choice accompaniment to a turkey dinner. Pours a golden color with a thick, creamy white head that makes its presence known. Nice residue of lace all the way down the glass. Smell is big on earthy tones -- fresh cut grass, hops, etc. Exhibits a somewhat sour, yet balanced taste and a clean, prickly mouthfeel. Fairly easy to drink, this goes great with food. A truly unique brew."
"It is compulsory that you appreciate a beer whose cork is held in place by a staple. Aroma of earth: clods of sod, hay, apple trees, vines of jessamine and burlap. Malt start is sweet, but not at all saccharine. Bitterness is mellow and perfect. It finishes savory and warming and right. Layers of lace coat the glass. Monolithic head reduces into a campfire marshmallow that you have to gather with a spoon when the crystalline amber liquid is gone. Frothy, but in no way harsh. The perfect beer? I sit besides myself and wonder how I lived for thirty years without ever tasting this awe-inspiring brew. Words can do no justice, find it and buy it."
"Corked 750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy orange body topped by a cream colored rocky/creamy head that's formed of average sized bubbles but holds extremely well as it's buoyed by a strong effervescence. Leaves excellent lace throughout the glass. The aroma is gently earthy, but not musty, with a honey-ish bready malt and perfumy & earthy hops. There are some subtle straw and light wood characteristics. The body is light/medium with an effervescent carbonation that's prickly on the tongue and gives the impression of a fuller mouthfeel. The flavor is a softly fruity and lightly sweet (orange & honey), but still dryish, combination of malt & earthy hop. The alcohol is somewhat apparent, but not distracting. A solid bitterness, emphasised by the brisk carbonation, eventually receeds as the beer warms to reveal more sweetness. Finishes dry with a lingering herbal & mineral character. A very enjoyable, refreshing, and drinkable beer with lots of character. I was surprised at the amount of hop bitterness and flavor. Well worth seeking out."
"Just getting the cork out of this bottle is a problem.  There is no ""champagne"" twisted cork stopper it is a ""wine cork"" held in with a bent wire.  You will need a wine opener for this one.  Slightly musty/malt/earthy nose.  Golden in color with a touch of orange.  It has a thick slightly off white head.  Nice lively carbonation in the goblet and the head and lace are framed well.  The malty base to the taste is a tapestry for subtle flavors of dry tart fruit, smoke, and white pepper.  The mouth is complex with original silk smoothtongue, followed by lots of bubbles and a dry finish.  The beer is very good and improves as it warms.  A very creamy lasting milkshake of a beer."
