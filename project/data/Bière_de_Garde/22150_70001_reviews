"For me the biggest standout is the floral additions and the great base yeast once again from Stillwater."
""
"Too sweet. Tastes like a dessert wine - almost like a 'barley sauternes"". Add some hop character to increase bitterness, and this could be a real winner."

"I've largely been a big fan of the Stillwater offerings I've tried, but Débutante really failed to impress. In hindsight, I would have been much happier with any of the other 4-packs on the shelf from this brewer. Oh well, they can't all be winners. Anyone who enjoys the style might as well try this but those only curious about the exotic ingredients, just save your money."
"Overall I did think this was quite impressive, the ingrediant additions really shined on the aroma but I think became a bit buried in the herbal oily and sweet character on the palate. A very interesting beer though and it is well proportioned to give you a good display of some  complex flavours and remain balanced. I think some small alterations would fix some of the balance critiques. Very nice."

"Awesome example of a bier de garde.  I wish more people embraced these styles.  Musty, spicy and lemon zest come through.  Very crisp with high carbonation."

"It's on the sweet side for me but still tasty."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style while still being fairly unique and I thought that made this beer memorable.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, slightly refreshing, a little dry on finish, not filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention,  I think two or three of these would be my limit, it's pretty easy drinking and I think it makes for a nice Fall time beer.  What I like the most about this beer was the taste, aroma and drinkability, they were all good and worked well with this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the head retention, but in the end it wasn't that big of a deal.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the style.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it was just a nice Biere De Garde and I enjoyed drinking it.  It isn't my favorite of the style, but it was one of the better ones I'e had and it's one of the better beers I've had from Stillwater.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer that was a little unique, keep up the good work."

"Flavours imitate a honey saison with amber malt. Some spicy hops and caramel. Finishes gently but well-balanced."

"Grain, pear skin, honeysuckle, heather, and lemon pith. Flavor is briney, with echoes of pear taking away that odd flavor, carrying into a dry, powdery finish."
""
""
""
"With a minty and pepper taste gaining steam, the ale's firm texture wavers enough to suggest a malty-dry finish. Any spicy, woodsy or grainy bite is buffered with residual bread texture while its floral bouquet continues to swirl above the palate, extending lightly into aftertaste."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/23/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, honey, rye bread, herbal, floral, grass, clove, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, bready malt, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, honey, rye bread, herbal, floral, grass, clove, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, bready malt, and spice flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Biere de Garde style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, bready malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Pours a cloudy golden hue with a one finger white head and a touch of lacing not much to look at really, the smell is honey, heather, more honey and peppery spices,the mouthfeel is Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and the tastes are Honeysuckle,peppery spices, a touch of apricot and finished quite sweet with honey dominating the finish and overall quite enjoyable and easy to drink but nothinh out of this world cheers."
"Serving type: bottle."

"Slightly hazy gold with a decent head that quickly fades to a patchy covering.  Interesting nose of heather, apple, flowers, honey, earth, cracked pepper, and some malty sweetness.  Flavor is peppery and earthy with some floral notes, rustic graininess, and apple.  Dryness keeps the sweetness at bay and there's a general mustiness that adds some character.  Medium-light, creamy feel, with a dry finish.  Decent, but not my favorite Stillwater beer."

"12 oz bottle. Complex floral and herbal flavor is more appealing than the rather yeasty/funky aroma.  Medium-full body with good carbonation."

"Taste is nice and yeasty, I would believe it if someone told me this was brewed in Belgium. A superb crackery, light malt base - super dry with a little hop bite to round things out. This is a fantastic beer, I would absolutely love to have another sometime very soon."
""

"Light mouthfeel. The appearance and aroma sold me, but the flavor was a bit disappointing, though as it warms up, the flavor slightly comes through more."

"i was very excited for this ancient grains type saison with all these botanicals in it, but it came across way too sweet for me, malty vanilla and not quite robust enough saison yeast define the nose and taste of this beer. clearish caramel color with a big bold white head, good looks. so much sweetness here i can't really get any of the botanicals or herbals i was looking most forward to. not sure what the spelt or rye contribute either, all i really get is residual sugar, light like honey, but still pervasive. feel is bogged down by it too, but its very well carbonated. some may enjoy the sweetness, i don't mean to make it sound like a pure sugar bomb because its a lit more interesting than that, the sugar just blocks the most interesting features of this beer for me."
"Overall, this is an agreeable saison. It isn't too over the top, yet the addition of rye and spelt grains add some more complex flavours and aromas to this brew. The beer has a nice funky smell to it which only increases as the beer warms up to room temperature."
""
""
"This is an ok brew. It is pretty yeasty and grainy."
"Overall, an OK sweet and spicy saison."
"A tasty enough saison, 'amped' up by the side-stepping grain, and mostly hard to discern floral adjuncts. Another weird, and limited in its wonder Belgian-influenced ale from Stillwater. I grok what they're doing as a gypsy brewer, and avid promoter of (their) local culture, but that hardly blows my skirt up, up here, so between that and the um, beer, it's a big fwuh, and if not that - meh."

"An alright Saison, but not close to one of the better ones from Stillwater as far as overall drinkability & taste goes. Had the potential for greatness..."
""
""
""
"o - another complex and delicious saison from stillwater."
""
""
""
"Just under medium body, lighter effervescence than expected. Lightly drying as well. A decent saison but no St. Somewhere."
"Very enjoyable. Carbonation softens a little on the palate. Five minutes in the glass before starting on this beer helps."

"Hazy corn colored with a solid sheet of whites. Nice saison nose, some grain, some pear, clay, soil, grass, hay and old Willamette hops. The intense carbonation veils the flavors of sweet grain, yam, hibiscus, some pear, some nice yeast flavors. Full bodied with insanely hi carb and a dry finish. The beer is really nice, tone down the carb and we have a real winner."

"O: If you like this style, then you'll probably really like this beer. I'm not a huge Saison / Farmhouse Ale. I like the spices. Like the smell. Good brew."
"A very nice Saison from Stillwater. A must try."
""
"From notes, 8/11/11. Bottle, home. Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a healthy white head. Aroma has fairly mild floral notes with a bit of rye, nice light grain and a big musty earthiness. It’s nice and dry with a touch of spice and a bit more floral presence. Good, fresh grain flavor. Light feel. Well carbonated. A nice beer that manages to work in floral notes on a dry, earthy body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Debutante is my first Stillwater offering and i can say I am eager to try more. Aggressively earthy and floral with hearty wheat, spices and a kiss of fruit. Wonderfully complex and well blended saison. What a great introduction to Stillwater ales."

"Not my favorite from Stillwater(Existent), but all around a nicely balanced and drinkable beer."

"Bottle: Poured a cloudy bright golden color ale with a super large foamy head with good retention and some excellent lacing. Aroma of rye and spelt malt is easily detectable with some good notes of rustic ester and light residual sugar notes. Taste is a complex mix between some fruity ester with good notes rustic malt with spicy notes of rye malt and light residual sugar notes. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed with excellent level complexity while retaining a very nice level of drinkability."
""
""
""
"My first beer from Stillwater. Looks nice. Smells nice. A good profile of flavors, but not really pushing it or trying to be obnoxious. And that's the key I think. Do it right and do it well, but don't try to be out of control with things. A very well done brew."
""
""
""
"O - Sweeter and creamier than traditional for the style, but it works beautifully."
""
"Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium orange amber with a one finger fine off-white head and lacing. Aroma of light fruit, floral elements light spicing and a suggestion of sweet caramel malt. Flavor of light fruit with peppery bitterness from the heather, develops nice floral notes in the middle to finish somewhat dry with a touch of rye sourness. A very pleasant flavor progression. Complex variety of flavors, but none dominate, allowing something interesting to develop over the taste. Although light to medium in body, it manages a bit of creaminess in the mouth feel. Another interesting and fun to drink take on the saison style. Nicely done."
"O: Like everything Stillwater makes this one is worth a shot. Not my favorite of theirs, but pretty solid."
""
"Overall Impression- A decent Saison by Stillwater/Brewer's Art but not worth the price... I haven't seen this in bottle shops yet but won't be looking to purchase it. Not even taste/flavor for me. The spices were a good contribution to the beer but needed more character."
"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is a cloudy opaque, pale, orange marmalade coloring with a thin, filmy coating on top. Aromas of sweet honey and a blend of spicing, including a clove presence. Flavors are light, with an effervescent feel on the tongue. Subtle sweetness in the backbone carries the dynamic spice profile of nutmeg, clove, heather, and oregano on a smooth body. The aftertaste is a muted version of the flavors, doing a good job of carrying the major profiles over into the end of the palate. Quick, clean finish, with a touch of citrus sweet at the very end. Very easy to drink, and very well balanced."
"overall this another winner from stillwater, i dig this beer."
"O-a decent Saison, but not in the top tier"
""
"o - overall, not a bad beer, but a bit of a let down. stillwater makes so many excellent saisons, but i found this one to be better than average, but not really at the level that i've come to expect from brian's saisons. enjoyable on a warm memorial day weekend, but lacking in the sweetness to be the perfect beverage for right now. probably more of an end of summer beer than an early summer beer."
"750ml bottle served in a tulip. Poured a hazy gold with a finger of white head. Floral aroma that I wasn't really a fan of. Also some citrus. Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Nice and dry with some Belgian spice in the finish. More citrus in the flavor. Taste was better than the aroma. Not my favorite Stillwater."

"Appearance is a hazy orange with two fingers of white head. This collaboration from Stillwater/Brewer`s Art has a a smell of of yeast, spice, honey and lemon. The taste is grains, fruit and bread. Mouthfeel is rather earthy, a musty aspect, finishes rather clean however. A nice farmhouse, that has a bit of barnyard character to it, but not too much, was easily quaffable and would be great way to introduce ""newbies"" to the style."
"Overall: I usually love Stillwater's saisons, but this one has too many funky additions. Too much spice and the herbal bitterness is too much. Still good, but not great."
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and is an interesting representation of the style due to the addition of flowers and herbs."
"O: This beer is very refreshing and very easy to drink - I really enjoyed this beer and it is one to get another time. This beer is very much a sessionable beer and definitely one I would enjoy drinking through an entire meal. My only real critique is that I wish there was a little more dryness in the mouthfeel."
""
"o - Overall a nice saison, but not my favorite Stillwater beer. A bit too heavy on the spices for me. If you like spice/pepper in your saisons you may like this more then I did, but I probably wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
"Overall: A refreshing brew; like the spice cake elements"
""
"While I enjoyed this beer tremendously after tasting the Debutante and a Fantome in the same weekend I also found myself wondering if I’ve hit a wall in terms of my ability to detect some of the more subtle and unique variations, or if I’m missing out on some things."
""
""
"The nose and the flavor lean a bit too much towards the fruity and floral side of things; it needs more spiciness and / or funkiness to balance out this super fruit and floral character that is on show so well in this beer. This is a touch unbalanced, but in the end is pretty tasty; actually it really reminds me a lot of a Saison I made with Hibiscus, it too really needed some balancing funkiness or spiciness in it. I wonder if the standard French Saison yeast was used in here, I find that this yeast doesn’t supply the bite and balance that my favorite Saison yeasts are able to supply."
""
""
""
"O: this beer was nice to try but almost tasted like a juice."
""
"O: A decent saison, though a little on the simplistic and watery side. Still, it's not bad."
"Overall: Good blend of flavors, categorically crisp, and no more alcohol than was ever needed, keeping it tasty and refreshing (even in late December)."
""
""
"Overall: A good Belgian-style/Saison. Very crisp and refreshing, certainly above average as a general ale, but I don't know that it's anything particularly special in the genre. That said, it's very good and I would recommend."
""
""
""
"O: Ok, not the best, but not the worst. Try if you like."
"O: Interesting beer – seemed strong then 6.4% alcohol, and tasted more like at tripel. I enjoyed it either way – but seemed off for the style."
""
"The aroma was loaded with spices. Hints of lemon and cinnamon where abound here, with a rich earthy mix to it. Lots of almost a nutmeg I am picking up here. The flavor took off right where that left off. A rich mixture of lemon, fresh grass, light fruit flavors and a ton of spice. Nice hints of allspice, cinnamon and pepper here. Nice light to medium body feel capped it off very well and the overall drinkability was very nice"
""
"Cheers!"

"This brew poured out with a nice rising white head and a cloudy yellowish gold body. The head had a good retention but the lacing wasn't really doing much. The smell of the beer was grainy and didn't really have to much of a farmhouse aroma to me. The taste of the beer had some light spicy notes and some sweet grainy malts that was pretty tasty I thought. The mouthfeel was light and well carbonated and it really when down easy. Overall its a very drinkable beer, it tasted good and left a good impression on me, I would more than likely drink this one again."
"Not bad here, a little bit much going on but tasty either way. Probably stick with some of their other offerings in the future though."
"Crisp in the mouth, a mild tartness, fairly sweet, and some yeast. Slightly herbal but nothing really stands out. For me, kind of an average saison, not super interesting."
"Stillwater knocked it out of the park with this collaboration. It was very worth the wait, and I'm going back for more."
"Beer tastes really nice, I like it a lot. Medium in body, sweet on the front end and throughout is a nice yeast character. The esters make a nice forward palate, sweet, banana, mild bubble gum, the finish has a subtle bitterness that I really enjoy a lot."
"Overall really tasty ale for the style and I could easily drink these all night long. I wish it had a bit more of that funky yeast and a bit less sweetness, but that's just my opinion and it's not like it's going to stop me from drinking more."
"Nice beer. I liked how the spice lingered on."
"Overall: The fruity notes were very pleasant and the flavor was quite well balanced. I would have this again in the future."
"Overall a different take, if you are looking for a bretty or funky sour saison this isn't it, but I like the other qualities of this brew considerably on the flipside."
"Debutante has colors consisting of burnt orange with a copper tint in between the lines. Darker than the average saison. No head, or even a skimpy cap, just some straggled popping bubbles, no lace. Smell is pretty dull with a big fruity essense. Kinda artificial. Some small toasted malt along with faded pepper. Not all that pungent, or good for that matter. Taste is not any better. The main taste here is artificial fruit, almost cereal like. Whatever yeasy in here is not a good look. Some small toasted bready malt in the middle rounding out to some grain in the end. Hops are not in the picture, or registering with me. Feel is medium with not a whole lot of activity, the beer is far from dead though, could use a jump start. Not my favorite from Stillwater, this would actually be my least favorite. I could not even stomach my glass."
"Poured on tap at my campsite into a hollowed out pineapple. Aroma is very pineappley. Haha. Grainy, cat piss, wet grass. Nice hazy burnt orange color. Light pepper aroma. Flavor is very mild. Nice saison. A little more body than most. Drinking this at a campsite from a hollowed pineapple"
"Overall, this is a solid saison, but the price is prohibitive ($11.00 for a 750)."
"Overall a great saison with just the right amount of floral characteristics. One of the beat beers Stillwater has done IMO."
"O - Not too bad. I still prefer some of their other saisons but this one was still ver good. Glad I got to try it. Thanks again Josh!"
"D - Very drinkable. The spices here were very complex and a bit different compared to most saisons. However, they wound up being well balanced and worked very well to deliver a great saison."
"A well-made American saison."
"M: The mouthfeel is very lively, packed with more flavors than most saisons put together. The dusty flavors segue nicely into a formidable saison body. Hops near the finish seal the deal with citrusy zest. Well done. I'd say its just a hair behind Cellar Door and Stateside."
"O: It's a very light and drinkable beer. Perfect for a nice hot day. It's not quite what I expected. I love the start, but the finish falls a little quickly. Overall though, it is a nice easygoing one. I would drink it again."
"Taste is as unique as the nose, very sharp and crisp with a unique tart and bready yeast flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, very rich and a bit bitter overall its very good and somehow very different."
"O: Though I've liked some of the Stillwater saison, this was a bit too...estery for me."
"O: An enjoyable effort, though I didn't find it as drinkable as I thought it should be."
"jd"
" This Saison has a lot of yeast driving the flavor, the presence is full on with mild wheat flavors which come off as lightly bready and fresh toasted with slight pear and light funkiness giving an earthy flavor from the yeast. The hops give a light herbal accent bringing out some complexity in the spice additions and the mild bitterness helps to lighten the taste a bit. The toasted wheat presence is high, perhaps there is some oat in the malt too since it is so silky smooth with creamy yeast element in the finish. Overall I found this to be a very high quality and quaffable saison, the spice notes are not out of place and the collaboration is nothing short of excellent which you would expect from two American brewers who know their way around the Belgian styles. A great example of what can happen when inspiration ignites between a couple brewers. Very nice take on the style."
"This was better on tap, as so many beers usually are. This isn't really an off putting beer, its just weird at times and there isn't anything there to make up for it's strangeness."
"Nothing extraordinairy here, but a solid effort nonetheless."
"Interesting Saison, the spelt and rye are pretty prominent. Not sure how much i liked the spelt, added a strong cereal graininess that i didn't care for. Not one of Stillwater's better efforts, but not bad either."
"O: a good saison from two home state brewers, but there are many better ones I would search out first"
"Overall the nose carries the flavor profile, and the head and mouthfeel left something to be desired, but I'd have another one."
"Pours a mostly-clear light orange-ish color with a 1.5-finger white head and some good spotty lacing on the way down. The nose carries quite a bit of saison yeast and accompanying spice plus a little bit of citrus and light malt. Flavor has a touch of malt as the backing plus spice and citrus; light pepper and herbs throughout. Light to medium body with good carbonation. Nice brew, but not my favorite from Stillwater. Still, definitely worth a try."
"O- This is another great Saison from Stillwater. This is definitely a unique Saison worth trying, I am glad that I have another bottle to later."
"proper looking with a kind of an off-orange color and a white head. nose reminds me of wildflowers, lemon, herbs, lemony rye seed (if there was such a thing), rye, spelt, lemongrass and carries a buckwheaty/soba umaminess that i can't describe along with a faint fruitiness. great malty base that amplifies and harmonizes with the spice (which also seems to harmonize with the phenols, blurring the line that seperates spice from yeast at work) to create a new melody. such a familiar taste, yet like nothing i've tasted before. well done my friends. dry, spicy, balanced and pleasant. not a trace of booze. the spice never becomes overbearing, and there even is a touch of bitter in the end to zip it up. medium body with a soft feel. wonderful. a bit adventurous, but in a gentle way. another winner from our local heroes!"
"Overall I enjoyed this beer but it was nothing to write home about. Worth a shot for the saison-lovers out there."
"This is a good beer to give someone's who's curious about the style and you don't want to scare them away with something overpowering or terribly funky. Very solid and perfect for this time of year."
"Overall not a terrible beer but not one I'd order again."
"the CPj"
"Poured into a pint glass, a cloudy bronze with a foamy white head that lingered through about half of the drinking session. Big aroma of Belgian yeast, hay, orange, banana. Taste is almost like a dubbel, following the smell a lot, with bready Belgian yeast up front, hay, grass, moss, wildflowers, orange zest and banana peel, mild peppery spice. Medium mouthfeel, pretty drinkable, but a little too much of the yeasty dubbel taste for me, which I'm learning more and more I have to be in the mood for to enjoy."
"I adore this beer. It's better than Hennepin, better than any farmhouse or Saison I've ever had. A true original, you have to try this at all costs."
