I couldn't keep this stuff away from my mouth. It's exceedingly sour and tart, but still to a highly drinkable degree - you won't have to worry about it burning a hole into your stomach. Light funk is a welcomed accompaniment to the complex tart and fruity flavor profile. The vinous and vinegar notes were lovely. I wish this was released more often, but I heard it spends 24 months in barrels... I guess you can't really argue with that.","tectactoe","Apr 28, 2013"

4.79,10.1,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"330ml bottle. Bottled 2-19-10...A tad bit over 2 year old. Pours an almost-clear, ruby-amber color with a hint of brown. Very minimal white head. Scent is...out of this world! Such a great smelling beer. JP always has a distinct aroma to them...that lovely barnyard funk they specialize in...with just the slightest tart aroma. This is that same scent, but kicked up a notch. A huge amount of oak with some sweet bourbon (I'm not sure if the Grand Reserve edition is aged in bourbon barrels, but I get a hint of it). Sweet cherries and some acidic notes. A bit of spice as well. Very lovely and complex. Taste is just as complex... Sour cherries up front. Followed by lovely wood/oak flavors and some lingering bourbon sweetness. ABV is so well hidden, it's ridiculous. Not as acidic as the nose is, but definitely leaves a sticky feeling on the gums and teeth. Mouthfeel is very dry with a sticky finish. Drinkability is very high. I could sip on this beer all night. Overall, this was such a great experience. It should be a crime to bottle this fantastic beer in such small bottles. This one is meant to be in 750ml and shared amongst friends. Amazing beer.","DovaliHops","Mar 04, 2012"
4.32,-0.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: A very nice ""true"" sour.

Sour cherries predominate up front. An intense puckering quality manifests itself mid-palate with oak and wet horse blanket at play in the background. The finish is dry with a sweet, tart aftertaste which lingers. The beer is light bodied with an evervescent level of carbonation that really adds to the experience. Overall this is a great beer. Probably one of the best sours I've had to date. The tart, sweet, funky characteristics flow from one to another flawlessly making for a supremely enjoyable experience.

There is definitely an acetic character, but it more brightens the beer than makes it dry or harsh. The beer is sour but not tart on the finish. A little dry on the ending and a lactic creaminess with a nice bouquet of yeast on the midpalate.

Dark red with a healthy head at first that died quick. It smelled a lot like the regular version, sour flanders style beer. The taste however had a very pronounced and beautiful oak flavor to it that complemented the beer very well. Sour but full and not so much the lemon flavor I have detected in Biere De Mars.

The fruit/citrus notes are light. The oak aspect is not prominent, but noticable none-the-less. A recomendation if I may...drink at cellar temp.

It's an amazingly mellow and bright brew with some beautiful flavors. Sour-haters not to worry. There is a slight sour, but a perfect balance. I know I'm not uber-critical of every beer because I try to find the positives in every one. There have only been a couple beers that have been released in the past year or so that have blown me away. This is definitely one of them.","MIMicrobrews","Apr 30, 2010"

The barrel character is substantial, lending a big tannic backbone that melds nicely with the vinous qualities. There's a touch of malt in the mid-palate that drops off again near the finish, replaced by tart cherries and raisins. The finish is bready and surprisingly brief - it ends on a clean, slightly lactic note. This is another winner from JP.","largadeer","Apr 29, 2010"

4.43,1.8,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"I'm pretty new to hand pulled beers but I was surprised to see this one come out of the cask looking like a glass full of head. Slowly however the murky brown beer crept up the glass until only a medium sized light brown head was left. Looked delicious, even at 11 am after my morning coffee. The smell is dominated by sourness and tart fruit, cherries maybe. The is a red wine vinegar quality and some oak. The aroma indicates this one isn't going to be messing around. Wonderful tasting beer, and I don't even like belgiany sour beers that much. Hugely sour with a tart fruitiness, oak and leather (while I've never actually chewed on leather this is what came to mind). Some pleasant funkiness too. Great sipper. While I can't compare the cask version to the regular the cask had a wonderfully fluffy lightly carbonated mouthfeel, served at a perfect temperature. I imagine this is the right way to enjoy this one. I only had the one because it was a Monday morning, but had it been a Saturday I could have sat at the bar drinking these all day. Great beer and a great quiet subdued release. Really a good morning.","Shumista","Feb 26, 2010"

4.22,-3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The beer pours a brownish amber color with good head retention and OK lacing. While the beer doesn't look particularly unusual or special, that thought was quickly dispensed once I breathed in the aroma. The nose on this beer is quite distinct, consisting of vanilla, prunes, sour cherry and light funk. Not sure what the regular JP beire de mars is like, but I'm impressed by how dialed down the funk and sour component is on this version. The added vanilla component really helps IMHO, and I found the nose on this beer quite enticing. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose, though they were a bit more muted then I was expecting. Also, the beer was surprisingly dry, with no more then some light sourness on the finish. Otherwise, the beer has some nice vanilla and citrus to it. Not entirely sure that extended barrel aging has benefited this beer all that much, though it was still quite enjoyable to drink. Mouthfeel is fairly light, but with a long, drawn out finish, and drinkability is exceptional. The alcohol is very well disguised, and with the no more then light sour component, this is probably one of the most drinkable beers I've had from JP. Nice stuff.","John_M","Beers"
4.4,1.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The palate has a rather enjoyable blend of lactic sourness, quite clean, with a touch of lemon. The funk is a blend of mildly musty/damp cellar notes with a rotting fruit note, especially on the back-end. There's a rather surprising lack of vinegar here. Very clean lactic sourness, almost yogurt like, especially on the finish. This is to the detriment of the taste, though, as it scrubs off some of the funk. Moderate barrel character (OAK, vanilla and bourbon) on the finish, this is leathery, drying and pretty awesome. Highly recommended. 4.5/4.5/4","DefenCorps","0"

Seemed a little thin on malt, but it was certainly there. Light bodied with lowish carbonation, off-dry. This one seemed a bit one dimensional after all the other amazing sours we'd been enjoying.

Can't wait any longer though! Reddish, terra cotta color. Little whitish film of bubbles with a ring around the glass. Smells madly sour, malty, hints of vanilla. Big sour blast, but tempered by the oak, with nice vanilla tones and a creamy malt backbone. Gooseberry, raspberry and tart cherry fruit flavors, as well as lactic acid sourness and a hint of Brett. Oak flavor grows and really complements the tartness. This is a delicious beer. Tremendously smooth and tasty...a real treat. Way to go JP!","aforbes10","Jun 08, 2008"

4.35,0,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a murky dark amber with a half finger off-white head that quickly dies down to a ring of bubbles. Hardly any lacing left on the sides. Probably the funkiest smelling beer I've put my nose too. Sour dark fruits, some vinegar, and wet oak dominate the smell. A good amount of pepper and spice are detected as well. Taste begins with sour cherries, apple cider, and more oak. The 27 months of aging truly shine in the flavor. Some caramel, vanilla, and maple syrup linger on the tongue with a wet lemon-lime aftertaste. Pretty funky through and through with this one, but I like it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very active carbonation that stings the entire mouth from start to finish. Very complex beer and surprisingly easy to put down.

Some acidic, metallic, citric puckering around the edges. Finish features lingering raspberry tartness, aged balsamic vinegar, and vanilla. Medium-full body with enough prickly carbonation to lift the acidic tartness off the tongue. Wow. I've had most of Ron's released JP beers, and I would say that this is the sourest I've had.

Some of the alcohol notes are deep and dark, with edges of caramel. Pour of a rich deep caramel, firey in glowing orange, witha thin rim of whitish. Flavor is a somewhat confused melange of bright awakening acidity in apple skin and white grape juice, with caramel syrup dangling with a fast flow of balsamic vinegar, between fading into a mellow fragrant lemon hop smack, yet remaining lightly subdues. Some of the nose-stinging acidity creates some balance. However, the flavor of this beer alights some muddines and subtleness with a little less distinctive qualities, its still a deliciously complete package.","CharlesDarwin","Oct 07, 2006"
