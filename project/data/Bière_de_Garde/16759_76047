Taste is almost a weak barleywiine, not so much biere de grade, and as you sip a bit more malt like characters come out. The beer isn't as sweet as the smell would indicate, starts with the fruit and barleywine characteristics and finishes with the malt characters. A solid medium mouthfeel, borders on going heavy, but a smooth beer the flavor isn't overpowering. Overall a good beer, nothing amazing but still tasty.
