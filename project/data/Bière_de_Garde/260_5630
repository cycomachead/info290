3.79,-5.5,,,,,,"Large format bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a golden amber hue with some fizzy off-white head that starts off billowing but quickly settles into a more manageable two fingers or so. Smells like rock candy, floral perfume, lemon rind, vinous fruit like champagne perhaps, straw-like musty hops. Palate is similarly light and floral, with some orchard fruit skin (apricot and nectarine), sour white grapes, sweet corn flakes, and more lemon discernible. The malts, yeast, and hops present in a simple, no frills fashion and I was expecting more complexity. Had to check the label to ensure I was indeed drinking and reviewing this brewer's "amber" offering. Yep. Not getting much in the way of caramel malt flavor. Light to moderate body and moderate carbonation. Finishes vinous and dry. Bit of an enigma ... Maybe my bottle was old. Would investigate further should an opportunity present.","CalgaryFMC","Jul 07, 2014"

Flavor is fairly faint as well. The simple character of the malts, caramel and toasty, is not what bothers me, rather the lightness of flavor. A bit boozy. I get a touch of fruit in the yeast. Finishes with a touch of bitterness. Flavor is a bit sticky with some lightly prickly carbonation.

The flavor is sweeter than I thought with the honey like and bready pilsner malt shining through. Light pitted fruits a touch of warming and a hint of pepper round it all out.

Aromas of big pear, grape, citrus zest, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, earth, grass, hay, light funk, bread, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of pear, apple, citrus zest, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, grass, hay, earth, bread, light funk, light honey, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, hay, grass, herbal, floral, earth and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; nice spicy/malt flavor balance; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish.

It was not terribly convenient. However, once I made it through that process I was presented with a beer that poured golden yellow with great clarity, about three inches of frothy head and good carbonation and lacing. The aroma boasts a wheat element and a vague spiciness akin to a Belgian Abbey Ale. The body is creamy and bold.

4.42,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer was left at my house a long time ago, and its about time to drnk it. The beer pous a hazy, paly golden color with a 3 finger head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is rather nice. There is a zesty lemony citrusy character along with a spicey belgian type character, almost a spicey hop quality. The flavor is really nice. It gives me a floral, flowery essence, with a slightly grainey character behind it. This is a hint of wood in there as well, slighty tanninish. The feel is moderate to thick, with a kight carb. Overall, a rather nice beer. I will definately look for this in the future.","kmpitz2","Nov 30, 2004"

3.75,-6.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a hazed, copper-amber color, that sits beneath a frothy light tan head that creates a wispy Belgian Lace as it subsides. The aroma is spicy, fruity and malty with notes of apples, ginger, pear, caramel, vanilla, and toasted malt. This has quite the classic Bier De Garde nose, predominantly malty with nice complimentary notes of fruit and spice. This beer is well carbonated, it foams effervescently as it hits my tongue for the first time. The taste is sweet up front with nice fruity notes of apples, but then moves to a sharp prickly mix of carbonation, ginger and alcohol. This beer is quite good, though because of its strength, it does have tell tale notes of alcohol in the finish, which detracts a little bit.","Gueuzedude","Nov 01, 2004"
4.42,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"taste the straw, the hay; dry grasses, and greener forage. Green grapes. Orange notes. Light and balanced. Very subtle malting to my taste, a touch of sweet. There's a nip of a hop profile. Very refreshing, and drinkable.","gbontrag","Oct 31, 2004"
4.03,0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Deep orange, darker than expected, murky. Light white head. Big off-dry aroma comes out musty. Its fruitier than most bière de garde with this dried mango, orange and peach flavour profile. Yet its just as rustic with this old cellar counterpart, lots of fluffy mustiness in there, notes of ashes, cask wood, uncleaned fireplace, hay Nice range. Dry dusty palate, never very sweet, yet fruity. Spicy, feeling green (chive). It has a slight lactic bite to it mysteriously. Notes of bubblegum, smoke, cement. I guess what I like the most is how the yeast planes over the rest of the flavours. Big carbonation, medium body. Good, but no cigar.. and I expected one. Cheers TAR!","Rastacouere","Oct 23, 2004"
3.75,-6.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Cloudy amber body with a huge frothy head of chunky white foam. Sweet malty aroma, fruity and light. Flavor is strongly hopped and dry. Peppery, spicy taste over an earthy base. Aftertaste is a bit musty, a bit unpleasant. The beer is fairly light in body with plenty of carbonation. I think the original is better.","Sixpack595","Sep 22, 2004"
3.86,-3.7,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Tastes very much like a Biere De Garde with a little bit of a tripel aspect as well. An elaborate fruitiness is present providing notes of orange and pear along with a light hoppiness and notes of toasted malt and caramel. The yeast reminds of Dupont. Tasty.","Crosling","Jun 22, 2004"
4.8,19.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Palates weaned on Belgian Tripel may find this too sharp and quick on the tongue. My only doubt is about the bottles closure. Im certain (after tasting a batch of Golden Ale that had been laid on its side for a month) that this composite cork only does bad things to liquid, imparting an unattractive mustiness that can blur with, well, an attractive mustiness that is essential to the style.","putnam","Apr 06, 2004"
4.82,20.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Backwash: One of the finest beers in the world (definitely top 20 for me), and vastly underrated (or under-known). I drank this particular example back-to-back with a regular 3 Monts. Frankly, I dont find the differences that substantial. Id compare the relationship between the Grand Réserve and the standard offering as the difference between an extra brut and a brut Champagne (although both are less dry than typical Champagnes). Stock up, this is one of the best cellaring candidates and one of the greatest bargains out there. Sublime.","Dantes","Jan 31, 2004"
4.67,16.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"3 Monts Grande Reserve Speciale Ale was served from a difficult 750ml corked and clamped bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a hazy orange-caramel hue, and was topped by a rich, thick, stiff, and resiliant light tan head that left sheets and smatterings of sticky lacing. Decadent currents of musty dried apricots, cloves, piney resinous hops, and luxurious scotch wafted from the glass, serving to invigorate my senses. On the palate, I experienced a world of intruiging and wonderful flavors that were related to the nose ... dried turkish apricots soaked in oakey red wine, grass, rosiness, and licorice. These flavors swirled and bounced with joy on the taste buds while the fantastic sweeping tannic dry lime bitter finish rolled through, leaving lingering vinous apricot notes. I was very impressed by the balance and composition of all of this. The full smooth body and the semi-fluffy carbonation were matched well with the flavors and personality of this beer. The deliciousness, balance, and dryness of this brew made it very easy to drink...for the style. Full-flavored, charismatic, and captivating... a highly recommend acquistion.","HiroProtagonist","Nov 07, 2003"
3.95,-1.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"The show was, however. Popping the cork allowed the bottle to spew its contents in just about every direction. Forceful carbonation. Rusty orange color with a huge, epic head. Fruity aroma catches your attention from anywhere nearby. Tall grass fields and flowering shrubs. Very earthy and dank feeling. Lots of yeast flavors in this, I think. Burnt sugars seem to squash the interesting fruit flavors around mid-palate -- the flavor of carmelized scrapings from the bottom of a baking pan. Still quite drinkable and pretty good -- but this isn't nearly as great as the original in my opinion.","marburg","Jan 19, 2003"

4.33,8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"After getting past the interesting cork arrangement the beer poured a very pretty honey color with a rocky, eggshell head. The aroma consisted of sweet malt, and peppery, perfumey hops. Before it warmed up a bit alcohol was too big of a flavor. Once it warmed everything fell into place. Bread and honey on the palate and some wood (American oak) as well. While not very sweet at all, it finishes even drier. Very complex beer and beautifully crafted. My review surely does not do it justice. Im glad the store was out of the regular 3 Monts, and I had the extra dollar to spend on this one.","yen157","Nov 15, 2002"
4.37,9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Here's an interesting French offering. My first biere de garde, 3 Monts proved to be a choice accompaniment to a turkey dinner. Pours a golden color with a thick, creamy white head that makes its presence known. Nice residue of lace all the way down the glass. Smell is big on earthy tones -- fresh cut grass, hops, etc. Exhibits a somewhat sour, yet balanced taste and a clean, prickly mouthfeel. Fairly easy to drink, this goes great with food. A truly unique brew.","Jon","Oct 16, 2002"
5,24.7,5,5,5,5,5,"It is compulsory that you appreciate a beer whose cork is held in place by a staple. Aroma of earth: clods of sod, hay, apple trees, vines of jessamine and burlap. Malt start is sweet, but not at all saccharine. Bitterness is mellow and perfect. It finishes savory and warming and right. Layers of lace coat the glass. Monolithic head reduces into a campfire marshmallow that you have to gather with a spoon when the crystalline amber liquid is gone. Frothy, but in no way harsh. The perfect beer? I sit besides myself and wonder how I lived for thirty years without ever tasting this awe-inspiring brew. Words can do no justice, find it and buy it.","inebrius","Aug 22, 2002"
4.5,12.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Corked 750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy orange body topped by a cream colored rocky/creamy head that's formed of average sized bubbles but holds extremely well as it's buoyed by a strong effervescence. Leaves excellent lace throughout the glass. The aroma is gently earthy, but not musty, with a honey-ish bready malt and perfumy & earthy hops. There are some subtle straw and light wood characteristics. The body is light/medium with an effervescent carbonation that's prickly on the tongue and gives the impression of a fuller mouthfeel. The flavor is a softly fruity and lightly sweet (orange & honey), but still dryish, combination of malt & earthy hop. The alcohol is somewhat apparent, but not distracting. A solid bitterness, emphasised by the brisk carbonation, eventually receeds as the beer warms to reveal more sweetness. Finishes dry with a lingering herbal & mineral character. A very enjoyable, refreshing, and drinkable beer with lots of character. I was surprised at the amount of hop bitterness and flavor. Well worth seeking out.","NeroFiddled","Beers"
4.26,6.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Just getting the cork out of this bottle is a problem.  There is no "champagne" twisted cork stopper it is a "wine cork" held in with a bent wire.  You will need a wine opener for this one.  Slightly musty/malt/earthy nose.  Golden in color with a touch of orange.  It has a thick slightly off white head.  Nice lively carbonation in the goblet and the head and lace are framed well.  The malty base to the taste is a tapestry for subtle flavors of dry tart fruit, smoke, and white pepper.  The mouth is complex with original silk smoothtongue, followed by lots of bubbles and a dry finish.  The beer is very good and improves as it warms.  A very creamy lasting milkshake of a beer.","frank4sail","0"
