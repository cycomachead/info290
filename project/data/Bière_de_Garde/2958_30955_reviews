"2012. Fantastic birthday beer. And from Switzerland? What a treat.."

"Split with my better half as a sort of after-Valentine's present. 2006, blended in 2007 aged on oak. Numbered 00276. Mahogany/ auburn reddish brown pour. Quarter finger/ ""nothingish"" head-wise. Super-chunky. Funky smell. Sweet/ sour on the immediate palate. Pleasant woodiness from the oak and a refreshing astringency due to the aged hops, both as to be expected. The sweetness was coupled to the rest of the flavors in such a way that is to be truly commemorated. Complementary mouthfeel. Aged for 9 years I was expecting something stellar. I was rewarded with an excellent brew with unexpected subtleties. Enjoy it for what it is and what you expect it to be and you won't be disappointed."
"Mouthfeel: Dissipating and refreshing."

"Overall (4.5): This is my first Biere de Garde, so I'm not able to say if it holds true to style.  That said, it is a nicely complex sour.  My only complaint would be the oak is it a bit too forward and overpowers the other flavors.  Probably would be a good beer to age a bit longer to see if the oak fades and allows the other flavors to shine through.  Although not the same style, I much prefer the Rodenbach 2008 Vintage for roughly the same cost."

"One of the best sours I've had."

"Sourness and wine define a sharp dryness, in which warming spices, a lot of oak and slick acidity create a pleasant complexity. Fruitiness developes berry and lemony hints, as the sourness becomes even more recognizable towards the end. Although the alcohol is well hidden, carbonation is too high for the complex character of the beer, metallic notes disturb the fragile balance, as it rolls over the palate. Giving the beer more time to age might help, as it has great potential."

"O: Spent $30 on a 750ml and impressed. Taken back on how well rounded everything was here. Sweet but not overbearing. Same with the sour component. Actually more refinded than many cantillon krieks I've had. Will get again."
""
""
"This is one of my all time favorites. I recommend letting it warm to at least 50-55 degrees before trying because cold refrigeration mutes the flavors severely."

"This is a beer that's been around for a long while and its easy to see why. Great balance and complexity and just an all around solid offering. Definitely worth seeking out and its one of those rare non-gueuze beers that ages wonderfully!"
"Pours out a deep, reddish caramel body with a thin, frothed milk head. Smell is of wood, toasted malts, berries, funk, acid, brown sugar. This first flavor impression is acidity, along with light caramel sweetness, chocolate, toasted bread, warm wood, gentle, earthy hop (faintly). Alcohol is very well-hidden, but perceptible. Finishes rather dry. Amazing. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight, with a sharp bubbliness. Acidity strips the tongue. Incredible beer. Not what I was expecting."
""
"Nice oakey and sour aromas. Very deceptive sour that may be the best balanced sour I've had. Sour clears the way for a nice oakey finish. A very nice beer that really excited me even more on the reemergence of sours in the US. Very enjoyable!!!"

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is #00276, brewed in 2007 and blended in Dec 2008. The beer is a murky, amber-brown coloring with a peppering of small carbonation bubbles throughout and no head. Aromatic as soon as you pry the cap off. Wow. Aromas of tart cherry, tannins, old world fruit sweetness in the backbone, apples, roasted notes, and an abundance of spices, including cloves, coriander, and nutmeg. Very layered nose, and more and more comes out as you drink. Great. Flavors are fruit rich forward, with a blast of berries and cherries enveloped in tart and slightly acidic notes, keeping a perfect balance across the palate. Darkly sweet plum and fig backbone, with a spiced blend that warms a bit, as well as provides some edge to all the smooth and rich notes. The tart turns slightly sour towards the tail end of the palate, which does a solid job of cleaning up all of the majorly rich and heavy characteristics. Smooth, mid-bodied in mouth, with a tart and fruity aftertaste that has a slightly astringent feel to it. The finish is crisp, with a slightly sour linger. Very delicious beer worth seeking out."

"I'm gonna keep this one short even though this beer deserves a little more detail. Pours a murky brown color with no head. Looks and smells like apple cider and jammy fruits with a bright acidity. The taste follows suit; sweet fruits up front (mostly apple with a hint of grape or berry) with a bright acidity. The acidity is moderate and pleasant with a hint of acetic acid/vinegar. A musty earthiness follows with a touch of oak and acetic acid and just a hint of booze at the end of a long finish. The taste is sweet up front and finishes tart. The mouth is dried by some oak tannins. Carbonation is light, enhancing the drinkability. This is a very interesting beer that hides its alcohol content very well. Expensive but highly recommended, especially if you enjoy cidery flavors."

"O – This is astonishingly drinkable at 11%, both in terms of flavour and in comparison to drinking a bottle of wine; drinking a bottle of wine in under half an hour would leave me feeling pretty ill but this is a delight. Sits easily on the stomach and the palate. This is the most expensive beer I’ve ever bought at $27.99 before tax. I’d been thinking about buying this beer for nigh on 5 months and I’m glad I finally took the plunge. I was expecting to feel cheated but I’ll be buying this again. When one considers how much people are willing to pay for a decent bottle of wine, this beer seems more reasonably priced. I loved it, and enjoyed it more than any wine I’ve ever had. When I compare it in this way I don’t feel so bad about the price. I look forward to pairing this with some hearty French-Swiss Alpine fare or a berry crumble. Must try."

"Foggy, glowing brownish-red color, looking pretty flat, with no head to speak of. Sour fruit and spicy wood aromas...dusty grapes, cherry tartness, oak, and mild port. A little much on the sharp acetone perhaps. Sweetish upfront, quickly turning tart, with a dry wooden spiciness, slight acetic notes, vinegar, cherry, and no booze at all. Slick, dry, and tart in the mouth. A good Flemish Sour-esque beer. Not sure I'd ever spend $30 on a bottle though..."
""
""
"Color is slightly hazy auburn red with a rather quickly dissipating head. Aroma is sweetly stinky. Fermented grape musk, tangy cherry, sweet earthy wood, warm sunny wild flowers. Taste is clean, tart with cherry, and woody. Mouth watering and elegant. Not the slightest sign of alcohol is apparent. Very crisp, clean smoothly balanced flavors. Mouthfeel is slick and softly syrupy, and this beer is highly drinkable. Pretty excellent."

"Had this on tap at Moeder Lambic in Brussels. Murky brown pour with a one finger off-white head with great retention and lacing. Nice woody, subtly sour, almost vinous nose with hints of balsamic vinegar, oak, and dark fruits. The taste follows suit with even more of an earthy, vinous character with hints of sour cherries, leather, balsamic vinegar, brown bread, grape skins, and vanilla. The mouth feel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation, a tart finish, and huge drinkability for the style. Overall, this was the surprise highlight of a night filled with great beers. Highly recommended!"

"O: Very nice and very complex. As complex as this is, it is very balanced and very enjoyable. Can't wait to try other vintages to compare to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: the 2007 seemed more ""refined"" as a balanced drink, with no overpowering notes. The 2010 was a little more exciting in the sense that it was bolder (to a degree), but lacked the complexity. Me and my girlfriend both enjoyed the older vintage."
""
""
""
"As for food, something very tasty and well-crafted will work. I can see everything from a shepherd's pie to pate to coq au vin pairing well with this. I don't think a nice berry cobbler is out of the question either. A slight stretch could be venison stew, but really, I think the key is something that is full-flavored and can stand up to some acidity and sour notes."

"Poured a brown hue with slightly reddish tints with minimal head and lace. Aroma is mostly tart cherries, touch of oak and booze, a little sweetness and dark fruit as well. Fuller body, almost sticky sweet at times, real smooth thanks to oak and the booze is mostly hidden with minor heat flashes on backend. A little bit of mild caramel or sugary sweetness, possibly sweet fruit tastes, but taste is mostly tart cherries and dark fruit with a sour edge. Everything is balanced and well-checked, though, so this beer is never overly sweet or tart/sour at times and is an enjoyable sipper throughout (the ABV starts to hit as you get near the bottom of the bottle). A good treat to have here and there."
"This 2011 brew was served in a 5 oz glass so not much head. Color is brownish dark ruby. Nose is a bit sweet & yeasty. Immediately complex on the first sip. A blend if flavors fight to come forward, very enjoyable mouth feel. Some fruity sweetness but the tartness is not hidden either. Definitely worth having another!"
""
""
"I had the 2011 vintage on tap a long time ago, and was curious to see what age could do to it. 6 years later, a lot is most definitely going on! Unbelievably complex, this drinks like a fine pinot noir from Burgundy, but it towers above most peers of its kind - including most Flanders reds, which this is in the same league as, if not more complex. Excellent stuff, if you can get your hands on this vintage - otherwise, I'm sure most would work. One of the best candidates for cellaring in the beer world, period."

"DATE TASTED: August 8, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Chimay goblet... OCCASION: celebrating birthday #37 in style... APPEARANCE: dense, dark amber-brown body with a single-finger froth that settles swiftly to a ring around an island of softened cirrus... AROMA: incredible red wine waft--especially merlot--takes the nostrils by force; secondary fragrant hops with bubblegum yeasts make this an alluring beer to hover over...a bit of cherries and some plum too...complex...PALATE: incredibly dry, warm, full-bodied mouthfeel--definitely worth a chalice and an evening; three sips to thirty sips, just as easy drinking...TASTE: sour but comfortably palatable; deliciously reminiscent of merlot, with a yeasty component that conflates the grape and rounds it... OVERALL: As farmhouse ales go, this is one beauty that made me buy a Saison Dupont on my last shopping trip, if only because the style, when done well, is inimitable; powerful, delectable, alcoholic but sensible in its balance; bought on a whim, this exceeded my expectations..."

"Overall, quite good, but not the world class beer I was hoping for. A bit extreme."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Like the nose, the taste has a kind of overripe grape flavor with a sour and sharp bite at the finish. Sour ales are not top on my priority list but for fans of the style it is probably quite delightful."

"Color is a dark orange, like well-oiled saddle leather. Smells of bleu cheese and oak shavings. Very delicate on the palate, with no sweetness and only mildly sour. Lots of funk. Tastes of oak, cherries, and grapefruit bitterness. Little mouthfeel and no lacing. Very complex--probably other things I'm unable to put my finger on."

"O: Excellent drinkability. Perfect beer. Close to a Flanders Red Ale, I would dare. Even better than the 2010 version"
""
""
"O: Both the complexity and the strength of the smell/taste of this beer really intensify as the beers warms up. Quite enjoyable and a nice palate cleanser in the middle of a good bottle share."
"O: This is pretty nice. Pleasant barrel character with a good balance between the maltiness and acidity. I have a feeling a fresh bottle would be even better, but this has not aged badly at all."

"This was a really nice beer. I haven't had many in this style, but I found this beer to be very complex and yet approachable. I was impressed with it's depth and character. This was a nice beer sit around and sip on amongst friends. This is probably a beer everyone should try."
""
"This sultry ale is a culinary delight on all fronts: it's savory, sweet, sour, and salty. Highly satisfying to taste, the beer is mature, surly, and unpredictable all at once. I simply cannot get enough of it!"
"Overall - Complexity is the best aspect of this. Always a fascinating beer from BFM."
"Overall, an interesting but pretty heavy beer. Not one I would enjoy very often but I'm glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
"Pours cherry red with hints of etches and a very clarified. Smell is initially inky, some acetone, some oak, some cocoa (oddly). Very rich flavor, cherries, raisins, malt, a little malt and some sweetness. Very warm, very robust. There is a hint of sherry. Thin with sharp, spicy carb and a little bit of off dry character. It's alright, I wouldn't buy a second bottle, but I'm told later vintages are better."
""
""
""
""
"Decent cleanser; could be better. Interesting drop, but it's also good, and points for handling a difficult brief."
""
"In hindsight my original ratings for the 2011 were probably too generous, but they represented my feelings on the beer at the time, so I'll leave them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Wowee. This'll put hair on your chest. Not high on the drinkability scale, but it's good for when you want a slow sipper to contemplate with or enjoy while having a one-on-one intimate conversation with a friend."
""
""
"O - The price tag was a little steep (I think it was $27), but this is a world class beer that I would suggest giving a go if you are looking for something unique and complex."
""
""
"O: Very complex oak-aged ale, lots to taste, would avoid pairing with food given the complexity and stand-alone qualities."
""
""
"O- 5/10 sourness. More bitter, vinous notes than tart or sour notes. Not sure ifi would spend the money for another bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is just superb bitter and sweet mellow. This is fantastic!"
""
""
""
"Overall - If you love sour beers, you will love this. If you don't, you will likely still appreciate it. Sours are an acquired taste, and this one is well done. Not my favorite stylew, but wow. 4.15"

""
""
""
"Overall an amazing beer I am very glad I could try. One of the most complex things I have ever tasted. Sweet like a great oak aged beer yet still very sour and tart."

"2011 vintage. I've been eying this beer (at least mentally) for years, so I'm pouncing on it here at LO while I can. It pours a hazy copper-amber topped by a half-finger of glowing lightly off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises red wine vinegar, buttery toffee, light walnut, almond, and spicy greens. There's a lot going on here in the aroma, including a few things I can't quite put into words properly. Suffice it to say it's sour, lightly buttery, lightly nutty, and lightly spicy. The taste brings in more of the same (with the same sort of complexity), with the vinegar coming through as more of a citric-ish sourness. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda lightly gooey feel. Overall, a very nice, highly complex beer, one that's a struggle to wrap my brain around, and I'm all the happier for it."
"A rare gem once again procured from The Lion's Pride in Brunswick, Maine. This vintage 2010 brew has a hazy brown color with rusty edges, a polite scattering of off-white bubbles that surround an inner island on top, leaving a respectable lace. The aroma offers a beautiful blend of tart red wine and deep, woodsy malt and intense yeast. A beer you can enjoy just smelling. Wow. The flavor follows with a deliberate lemon sweet tart and briney brown bread malt. Absolutely to be savored! Suggestions of a nice chianti tempered by the deep earthy malt and lemony sweetness. This is so divinely balanced: sweet, tart, seaweed, mellow, sharp. And goes down so easy but you don't want to rush these flavors. There's an underlying vanilla that pushes the malt and other complexities tease the senses. Body is medium-plus, with a somewhat heavy feel, with low carbonation, but just right for this brew. I'm highly pleased and would say this was one of the best flavorfests I've enjoyed for many months. Don't pass on this if you are a fan of the sour/Flanders side of beer love!"

"Had on tap at Max's in Baltimore. Saw it advertised on the beer list as a ""Swiss sour/wild ale""... never heard of that style, so felt I just had to try it. I was not disappointed in the least bit, this was one the best tasting beers I may have had in my life. High alcohol, but completely hidden, superb balance and mouthfeel, fantastic sour and cherry flavors, goes down way too smooth. Was a struggle to just drink it slowly, this one packed a flavor punch and was dangerously good."
""
""
"Picked up a coule 2007 vintage bottles. The first bottle caught me by suprise with the big alcohol percentage, so I wasn't quite prepared. The second bottle a few months later however, was tasting delicious. Pours a slightly cleark, murky amber brownish colour. The last pour was hazy with sediment at the bottom. Got about 3 glasses from each bottle. Tastes tart, with cherries and oak coming through with a nice sour mouthfeel. I love licking my lips after each drink of this. This beer aged incredibly well. can't believe I am drinking almost 6 year old beer! Good stuff, a bit pricey though."

"Flavor profile reminds me more of a Flanders Red or a Bruin rather than a Beer De Guard."
"750 ml bottle, 2009 vintage. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with a very thin light tan head that fizzed away immediately. There's a small amount of lacing. The aroma is nice and tart, it smells like vinegar, red wine, oak, tart cherries and some plums. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but with the addition of some lemon. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with low/moderate carbonation. I think this is a good overall brew, but I wouldn't buy it again anytime soon because it's pricey ($22.99 a bottle). With that being said, it's worth trying if you've never had it before."
""
"Not my favorite style, but this one was very nice. Still not sure it was worth the money, but a very nice treat."
""
"O: Not quite as good as I remember it on tap, but still pretty exceptional. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys sour ales of any stripe. I might should have let this one age a while, but temptation got the best of me."
""
"Overall I enjoyed this beer but it did not wow me in any way shape or form. The flavors seemed mellowed and slighly muddled together and the aroma was less than impressive. For the cost I would seek something else."
""
""
"Note: 2010 vintage"
""
""
"Overall an amazing and memorable beer. One that certainly bridges the gap between fine beer and wine."
""
"This was a beauty in the glass, dark brown with some plum red when struck towards the light. A nice half inch of faded tan with no sticking on the sides. It dies leaving a small skim around the glass and some sediment seen in the glass. Smell is very big and bold with a wine characteristic, berries, apple and some underlining funk. About the farthest thing from beer I've tasted. Not getting a whole lot of the base biere de garde, but berries, wine, oak, grape and a hint of balsamic vinegar make for a great bouquet. Acidity is at about medium with some tang on the end, about medium build, light carb within a half hour. Pretty great stuff and something to sip on for an hour or so."

"This is truly one of the better beers I ever had. It’s incredibly complex, but refined in its characteristics. It’s also of an at least moderate sourness level which makes it very enjoyable. This is what I expected from the 2007 vintage and it did not disappoint. Great aspects similar to a lambic with soft features typical of a Belgian ale (almost dubbel or strong dark like). It was an expensive purchase at $27, but I would not hesitate to buy it again. The only thing comparable is offerings from Russian River."
""
"OVERALL: A very impressive brew, reminds me alot of the regional sour browns of Belgium. Can hold a candle to alot of different brett/wild yeast beers, and has aged gracefully. Could hold up alot longer but drinking fine now."
"This guy delivers on all fronts. Smooth, easy drinking with loads of tart fruit and balsamic notes that deliver the sour you crave."
""
"Overall an excellent beer, but sadly the price tag will edge me out of ordering this more often than I'd like."
""
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy tan head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of sour and tart fruit, slight vinegar, funk, and woody aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic/drying quality on the finish. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great sour presence in the aroma and taste. I just wish the carbonation level was better on this one."
""
""
"At $27 a bottle, I found this beer to be hugely disappointing. Bottling beers in green glass is always risky. I would love to try a more recent vintage to see if the ""off"" notes are less apparent."
"Overall: Excellent. The 2009 seems to be ideal right now. I'll save my bottle of 2010 until this time next year..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, it's somewhat sour... But it's not very good."
""
""
""
"o - Overall I liked this beer a lot. I've steered away from these beers because of their price tags, but I liked this one a lot. Will certainly pick it up in the future."
"Overall Impression 1&2- While enjoying side by side, the 2007 version was much more sour and found we both enjoyed this one more. I'm not sure what I think about the price of these brews yet... There are plenty of Biere de Gardes and other Belgian/French style beers you could get for your buck besides this one. I would recommend grabbing a 2007 over the 2006 in my opinion. Happy to have finally enjoyed this after buying over a year ago!"
"One would expect this style to be good with food, contemplation or reading, and Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chein delivers. I am reminded of wing chairs and leather-bound books."
""
"It's a confusing beer this one. I'm certainly not wowed by it, nor particularly enamoured of it at all, but it has enough interest to keep you hoping. That's worth something at least, even if for me, my hopes ended up in disappointment."
""
"The 11% alcohol is so well hidden. You could consume many of these beers before figuring out that it will sneak up on you. Lemon notes with the sourness but generally just so easy to drink. Delicious."
"On draft at Dutch's (served in a snifter). Looks decent, although there's no head or carbonation to speak of. Smells good; nice and tart. Tastes good too; the age has helped marry all of the flavors together. Mouthfeel is the weakest link; very pedestrian. This is mostly due to the lack of carbonation. Overall, a privilege to get to try, but slightly disappointing (just because my expectations were so high). I'm not a fan of flat sours."
""
""
""
""
"A pleasant surprise that wasn't on my radar at all. I loved this beer and will be seeking it out again. Overwhelming sour and loads of complex fruit flavors with the perfect amount of oak to balance it all out. In a night with a ton of great beer, this one ranked right up with them."
"Poured into a Duchesse de Bourgogne goblet. Pours a dark red-orange amber. Thin, fine off-white head that has good retention and light lacing. Aroma is sour, vinegar, ripe apples, cherry. Flavor of tart light fruit, cherries, apples, apricots; sour and vinous. Flavors are well integrated and nicely supported by the oak components and the background neutral malt. Unusually well blended sweet and sour fruit and dry woody flavors. Medium to heavy bodied with nice carbonation considering the thin head. Sour beers are always a gamble for me and this was quite expensive, so I'm glad that it is so pleasant and well made. The best biere de garde I've had. 2007 bottle aged in my cellar for over a year."

"Edit: Just poured the second half of the bottle at around 64F and got a massive off-white head. This beer is not meant to be consumed below 60F. Cheers!"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one easily drinkable despite the ABV. Each sip came quite easily and I often found myself sipping more rapidly than I had intended as I sought to sort out the complexity of aroma and flavor. I’d definitely have this one again. My overall impression is of a first rate beer which may come up short on appearance but more than makes up for it on aroma and flavor."

"Lightly carbonated, and thinly bodied, for such a big beer, you would never know that it packed a punch. Insanely mellow, that 11% ABV never even makes an appearance, much less become the focal point of the beer. A masterfully crafted brew...now if we could only do something about that appearance..."

"O: This is not really a beer; it is more of an experience than anything else. If you ever have the opportunity to try any vintage of this beer on-tap, do so. The beer is much livelier and much more vibrant on-tap than out of the bottle, making it easier for the reviewer to separate all of the flavors. In the end, this was a great drinking experience, and one that every beer fan would do well to seek out."

"Perfect. One of the best beers I have had in my life."

"Low carbonation for a tap brew fits perfectly, the brew appears nearly still but hits the mouth with a bright clarity of purpose. Why can't this be served everywhere? by the quart? for free?"
"Clear brown pour with absolutely no head. The aroma is full of oak, vinegar, funk, booze, and lighter fruits like apple. Very much like a wine. The taste has big hits of oak and booze. Dark fruits seem to balance it out, unlike the lighter fruits I got on the smell. Lots of acidity and funk lend their hands as the beer warms. It seems to be a different type of sour than the tradition lambics or American Wild Ale. Creamy body with only a small amount of carbonation, warming booze on the back. Very interesting taste, all of the flavors play nicely to create a delicious, balanced beer."
"Cheers!"
"A lot of brewers nowadays experiment with wild yeasts and barrel aging and while they may present themselves as archers, it's often apparent that they don't even own a bow. They could learn a thing or two from Switzerland's Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien. I have no idea where these guys came from, but I'm glad they're here. Profusely recommended."
"Overall awesome, so tasty, great tart sour fruits, sour malts, a bit bready, not mouth puckering or over the top, very tasty and nice funk to it at the same time."
"Notes: Not the first time I have it. Always on tap... But I'd love to get hold of a couple of bottles. And I see myself revisiting it, so it is a bit of an overdue review for a brew, that maybe is not for regular consumption but definitely leaves a nice dent in the memory."
"Overall: Had to drain pour it in the end, the sour and vinegar was too strong. Doubts about the beer started with the green bottle."
"I was worried by the giant wiff of vinegar I got when I opened it. But that smell seems to have dissipated and I am left with a very pleasant smelling beer. I will be drinking an entire bottle to my head tonight. Looking forward to trying one of the douzes I bought as well."
"Awesome overall-- ordinarily I'd be suspect of something like this."
"Overall: I just couldn't get past that initial taste. I was bummed out by this."
"11% abv? Could have fooled me. It feels like you could drink this till the cows come home. Just one heck of a tasty brew! I just devoured this like crazy drank it all night."
"Pours a very murky brown with a rust red tint. Has virtually no head, just a bubble or two on the sides. The nose is tart and sour with a very earthy funk behind it. That taste follows suite with the nose and is full of tart fruits and earthy notes as well as a funky unique taste. For the lack of head I expected a much flatter beer but in the mouth there was some decent carbonation with a bit of heat from the alcohol. Really liked this beer."
"O- Very nice surprise, didnt know much so i didnt expect much, but it was very legit."
"This is a pleasant departure for beer. Not your every day beer."
"Sometimes less is more."
"O - GOod beer, very complex and weird. I like it"
"Edit: 2009 vintage i liked considerably better... Bumped up the taste"
"Interesting beer. I felt the booze was a bit more prominent than I would like. Perhaps it's because my bottle was relatively young? I think this is one that could be aged for years -- I may buy another and throw it in the cellar for a few years. Really interesting, dynamic brew. Something about it made me think of Consecration -- but this has a lot more going on, with a thicker syrupy mouthfeel. I felt like it was a bit unnecessarily abrasive however. I'm really interested to see if that changes some with age."
"Medium to full bodied, nice balance between tart/sweet/bitter."
"Very good beer. I'm very much enjoying it"
"750 ml bottle poured into mini snifter. 2006 vintage. Murky, old brown leather color. Medium, beige head, low retention and lacing. Aroma dominated by sour apples, horse blanket and a bit of syrup and nutmeg. Taste is puckering and includes spicy vinegar, sour green apple, and an earthy funk. Refreshing in a sour kind of way. Delicious, maybe not to the average beer drinker, but certainly a gem to anyone in the mood for a world class sour beer."
"Dr: High ABV is incredibly well concealed. It's well built for the style, but suffers from an unfairly high price. Very drinkable, especially considering the ABV. The sourness may be off-putting to some, but fans of the style will be pleased."
"O: very good, not a starter into craft, I could drink this daily if only my wallet could handle it."
"Overall: Very complex and tasty brew. Very puckering sourness, great!"
"2007 Bottle: This beer poured out as an interesting looking reddish color. The head came and went fairly fast. The aromas of oak, funk, sour cherries and some wine-like fumes come off of this beer. The taste of the beer gets better as it warms up. I found this beer to be very tart and sour in the beginning. As it got warmer, the funk and oak flavors came out more and took over in place of the sourness. The mouthfeel had a pretty good carbonation to it but was a little thin I thought. Overall it's a good sour for sure. I'm not a fan of the style but I feel it would please most beer drinkers."
"This was really nice. It does to show you that there are plenty of unknown, obscure beers that you might gloss over that turn out to be real winners."
"consumed at Thirsty Monk, Asheville"
"This is a medium to full bodied brew. The fullness is a bit exaggerated due to the nature of the low carbonation. It is not flat but just slightly bubbly enough to lighten up the feel a bit. The huge alcohol presence provides solid warmth all the way down the throat. A big depth of flavor and barrel aging effect mixed with medicinal qualities. There is a pleasant funkiness that dominates the sour aspect yet it is tangy like cherry. Overall an enjoyable offering that is worth checking out. I think the 15+ % abv is a bit excessive. Toning that down would greatly increase the drinkability of this brew. Even at almost 7 years old, this brew could easily last a few more."
"O- this is one of the most unknown/under-appreciated beers on the market. it lurks in the shadows of beer stores in the know just to get picked up by people like me. if you havnt tried it and have the option, pick it up. i think its only $20 for the bottle. if you dont know where to get it, ask your local beer store's beer guy to order it. you wont be disappointed."
"Overall, this is nice, very tasty, approachable, and very easy to drink. Like I said earlier, I find myself wanting a touch more sourness, but that's a nick pick, this is good stuff. I would have never guessed that this was 11% ABV."
"overall a very very good beer. if you like rodenbach grand cru, you will like this."
"On my way out of the store, my beer bud there and resident expert asked if I planned on aging the bottle. At the time, I didn't think there was any chance I'd drop another almost-$30 to age one, but I'm starting to reconsider. Pick this one up when you run into it."
"(d) A fantastic beer from the Swiss!?!The delicate balance of tart/sour, warm alcohol, malt sweetness and wood was right on. I would definitely recommend this beer and I would certainly drink it again...well, if I can afford to. $30.00 a bottle is a bit steep. Cheers!"
"lots of different variations on this one, so hope i'm reviewing under the correct category. 2009 vintage. blend of merlot, pinot noir, pinot gris and cabernet barrels the menu says. anyways... murky brown with some ruby highlights to it and a very tan head that fades quickly, yet leaves a collar that stays. nose is oak, vanilla, must, musk, currant, sour/dark cherry, prune, plum, acid, alcohol and a funky kind of wild bretty cherry pie character. woah. big, boozy and complex as they come, but warm and inviting at the same time. taste is luscious and beautiful, and exudes fantastic balance of all the flavors noted above. bretty cherry pie and oak stand out the most to me, and alcohol flavor doesn't detract a bit, it amplifies the other flavors just like it should and even comes in to play as a flavor of it's own. medium-full body is slick and silky, leaving a surprisingly clean finish that sends flavors of oaky currant booze out my nose and makes me pucker just a tiny bit. a wonderful sensory experience these ASBC beers are and a real treat to try on tap."
"I'm not a huge fan of sour beers, so I haven't had too many, but this one was extremely good. Not puckeringly sour, a good balance of funk and sour."
"Nice beer from BFM, but I'm not sure if this can be labeled as biere de garde though. It has lots of yeast complexity and I definitely recommend it."
"Overall I think this is one of the few beers that benefitted from bottle conditioning as the bottle was superb and the tap decidedly less so. Still, a very good beer that does a very good job of hiding the alcohol and melding a variety of flavors. Well worth a shot any way you can find it."
"**Retro review from 11/09**"
"D: this is as drinkable as it gets for an 11% brew. Goes down incredibly easily and invites you back for more with the its draw-out aftertaste. Would be even better with more age."
"4.5 4.5 4.5 4 4"
"D: One of the most interesting beers I've had to date. Superior drink-ability for the ABV. Just a phenomenal all-around beer here, nothing like it."
"Absolutely cannot believe this is 11% abv. Completely drinkable and amzingly flavored."
"When I review the current version the score will be somewhere bewteen an A- and an A as this beer is awesome"
"The 2008 batch was much more sour and somewhat metallic. Not quite as good."
"An amazing beer. BFM always makes something exceptional. Add one more to their list of awesomeness. An experience and a treat. Pick some up if you ever see it."
"Drinkability: Probably the best sour beer I have had. Of course, after three years of burgundy barrel aging, I am not sure this is really a Biere de Garde, but who cares, it's great."
"Pours a slightly-browned garnet color with a thin off white head and a tiny bit of lacing. Nose brings some lactic sourness, cherries, hints of dark fruits, and a bit of earth. Taste and feel add in a nice oak presence and the sourness becomes a bit more prevalent. The cherries and light malt fit well together bringing a nice bready character out. Drinks quite well; glad I got to try this one."
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma is tart apples, oak, vanilla and toffee. Very nice smelling. The flavor is sour apples, oak, caramel and vanilla. The beer is very dry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very good sour beer."
"Drinkability: Like that time I drove out to Myrtle Beach, it makes for a reasonably decent, one-time visit. However, with the alcohol, palate-wearying phenols, and hefty price-tag, I just don't see myself returning to it."
"D- Overall a tasty beer even with the lack of carbonation. I am not sure if I just happened upon a flat bottle or if all of this vintage are like this."
"Drinkability - Delicious, very easy drinking but strong."
"D: I have enjoyed all the bottles of this that I've tried, but for the price I have a hard time buying them. Still a good beer, however."
"Vintage 2007. Tasted from 750ml bottle at Lush West Town. Pours a chunky cloudy amber with a lacy light brown head. Nose of sour cherries and some funky earthiness. Flavor is sour and fruity with red berries and a lot of funk. Body is medium with light carbonation and a long funky sour finish."
"A 2006 bottle...The color burgundy, could be confused for a glass of wine if it wasnt for all of the haze, with active, bubbly off-white head. Smell is of a high quality red wine, american oak, backed by some tart, sour and funky notes... wonderful. The scent is done right by the taste, a pronounced, but delicate acidic and tart wine charachter backed by the touches of hay, oak, earth, grain and funk. Amazing taste. Medium bodied, dry, better as the carbonation settles. A very wonderful beer... easliy comparably to RR Consecration, a bit more mild without the added currants. Would love to experience other years."
"to a cabernet. Mouthfeel is full and sticky. Prickly and tart on the back of the throat. Cherry sweetness and oaky vanilla flavors are first and foremost, followed by light, grainy malts and green grape sweetness. The finish is a fantastic mess of boozy, funky, sour flavors. Totally worth the high price tag."
"Consumed: 4/16/2010"
"750ml bottle brought back from Switzerland by my cousin who then sent it on to me, yes! I poured this into three wine tumblers and it was a cloudy reddish-orange color with a wispy head. It smelled tart and inviting. The taste was quite weird, tart, some citrus, just very complex and I could not accurately describe the flavor other than to say I liked it a lot. I probably would not finish the whole bottle so I am real glad I shared it. This beer was quite intriguing."
"D - Drinkability is very good. I would never guess this beer to be at 11%. Even though the alcohol is masked well, this one is still a sipper. The abundant flavors guarantee that. It starts out pretty tart but as it warms, the tartness really starts to mellow. The oak really comes through as well. I must say, I'm quite impressed with my first brew from BFM. Very highly recommended."
"Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien is an impressive Biere de Garde. Every time I try this style, I have to reacquaint myself with it. This particular release is very impressive, and has few weak points. I don't know what a fresh bottle tastes like, but this 2007 blend is quite good. I think I might like a few more bubbles, but that's about it. It has a ton of flavor and just enough tartness to really make it work. The oak really drives it up a notch all around. Very good stuff. Highly recommended if you find a bottle."
"Great ruby red / garnet color with clarity, light tan head appears with tight bubbles and little to no lacing. Such a pretty beer in the glass. Aroma is vanilla, sour cherry, oak and licorice. Flavor has a great malty quality that gives way to abundent fruit and oak flavors ending with some tartness and faint sourness. Every flavor and aroma in this beer is balanced just right, amazing. This beer slides over your tongue with such ease, silky with just the right amount of carb. 11% if I didn't know, wouldn't have been the wiser. I could easily plow through a bunch of this stuff."
"Tart, sour gets me in the back of the mouth. Almost a woodsey musk to the whole thing. Some sweet / sour in the front, no bitterness to speak of. Beer is a little thin. Second taste, slight alcohol and a growing bitterness that time. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is good as well. I would recommend this beer."
"Drinkability was only fair, halfway through the 25 ounce bottle and already I'm ambivalent about whether I finish it. Quite frankly, the price did not make me want anymore either. At five bucks, I'm not impressed; at 25 bucks, even less so."
"Can't wait to run this one by a couple of my wino friends to see what they think."
"Drinkability suffered a touch just because this was strong and had a lot going on. But it was a pleasant beer and I enjoyed the myriad of unique flavors. A winner - now I want to try some of the varieties!"
"D - goes down nicely. you notice the 11% ABV but you don't care, assuming you dig the style."
"Really good."
"This beer is definitely worth the $23, not something to get too often but worth it once in a while. If I see it again that is."
"Overall, I was really glad I got to try this one. It was a well balanced, not over the top, sour beer. Very easy drinking . Fairly drinkable, because it didn't have a lot of acidic flavors."
"D - Man, this one could you a few years. After drinking one of the Grand Cru's, also vintage date 2008, I figured this would be safe to open as well. I imagine a year or two extra in the bottle could help round out the edges on this beer, help it reach it's full potential. As for now, this beer is still tastes like a fully fleshed out example of any other brewer's Biere de Garde, and I look forward to revisiting this one in a year or two."
"2007 version: Very similar in the flavor profile but the exact opposite in carbonation as it is almost non-carbonated; for a beer of this style, however, the lack of carbonation works very well - I may even prefer it"
"drawback? the cost of entry was pretty high here....based on how uncommon it probably is, I'm guessing most people will pay $30 a bottle or so. I paid $35."
"I just take for granted that I can buy these around here but this is the first time I've tasted one. All I can say is I will definitely be buying more of these as this is an excellent beer - very complex and drinkable. Highly recommended."
"This was really drinkable, which was dangerous. Before I had left Jacks, my 2 friends and I had polished off 2 of these and enjoyed every sip. Overall a fantastic beer, and a great surprise."
"An intriguing beer, well worth drinking."
"4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"This is an interesting beer with sour and sweet elements. Cherry is the main flavor and aroma--it has both of the main flavor elements. It's a medium bodied beer, but has a carbonation that makes it feel richer."
"D: This is outstanding stuff, well worth the wait and search to try it. Drinks more like a 5% brew, tons of interesting flavour."
"This would be a great winter warmer to split with a couple of friends. Thanks nightbrew for pulling this from your secretive cellar."
"Notes: This beer shows outstanding complexity, balance and sophistication. I could sip this all night paired up with a nice plate of fine cheese and fruit."
"D: A good beer, quite interesting. It has an edgy character due to the way the tartness mixes with the aromas and the gentle sweetness. Would definitely have another."
"If you have any of the '05 vintage left I would recommend drinking them very soon. I believe they have gone downhill a lot already and just keep on rolling. This is a crazy unique and interesting beer though so it's worth trying."
"Flavorful and really good, not overwhelming at all, but I can think of cheaper lambics or flanders red (which is more similar in style) that I'd go for if I had to pay, haha."
"Planning to re-rate the cellared '05 ""#276"" to add to this bare review."
"An extremely well-crafted and inspiring brew! More stuff like this, please!"
"D - Don't know if I would drink this again. Not my style it was strong as well so can't say it has high drinkability."
"Sours are not my favorite, and despite this one only being moderately so, the ABV keeps this one a sipper and one is enough for me."
"Brick Store continues to impress for its 12 Anniversary, with this one on tap. Pours a cloudy reddish brown color, with a thin, almost non existent head. As it warms, a nice sour cherry nose comes from the beer. A slight malt sweetness rests in the background of the aroma. Taste is an incredible sour cherry flavor, but does not overwhelm with sour, it is very balanced. As I continued to sip, other fruits came through, strawberries and apples most predominantly. There is a still a decent malt/caramel sweetness to it as well. Very complex, I am not sure I can even list all the flavors. Its nice that it is sour, but that does not overwhelm the other flavors. As high as it is in ABV, with low carbonation, and with 3 blends in the brew, it is still rather light in your mouth. Definitely a sipping beer, both in the heat it brings, and to enjoy all the flavors it provides. A highly enjoyable final beer for me last night."
"Overall, a really complex and enjoyable brew. Glad to have tried it, and would recommend for fans of sours. I'm not sure I will be revisiting this for a while given the price, but I can see that being a struggle for me."
"Drinkability: high. I believe my wife called me a pig when she asked me for a refill and I told her I had already finished the bottle."
"The beer is near the upper end of medium bodied with lively carbonation. The mouthfeel is dry and champagne-like. At $26, this is definitely pricey, but if you like the style this is worth seeking out."
"Overall, a delightful beer that I would be happy to have at anytime. Would love to try some fresh to compare with this aged version."
"Drinkability - It was very easy to drink with little taste of alcohol. Drinks more like a wine then a beer."
"D: This is a drinkable beer. It's my first biere de garde, but hopefully not my last."
"D: Definitely a sipper, it will take me a while to get through this bottle. The 15.5% ABV is very concealed and an unexpected buzz creeps up on you and warms you very nicely."
"D- This beer had a pleasant tartness but it was soft and there wasn't any depth of flavor after that. The flavor was a bit drab and that stung a bit considering the price tag and all the hype around this beer. I don't know if age would bring out more funk flavors but I'm not willing to take the gamble."
"Good stuff..."
"A treat on tap at the Blind Tiger in NYC a few nights ago (got to meet the brewer of the stuff that night to boot...) $8.50 for a 12 ounce pour BTW...Poured totally muddy, lighter brown (later pours were no less muddy, but were darker in color) no head, no lace, low low carbonation. Sour yet soft, lactic nose. Complex, flavorful quite interesting and totally different type of beer. I'm thinking to my self what damn style of beer is the mother?!? More sour, tons of soft fruit undertones, spiced up bloody Mary/clamato notes. All sorts of stuff going on here. Somehow it holds together. Absolutely delicious. Gonna buy a bottle as soon as I get a few extra bucks. Highly recommended."
"Light in body, crisply carbonated."
"I am amazed that this is 15.5 ABV. Where do they hide it?"
"A nice soft body, subtle yet present carbonation and wonderful flavors leads to an impressively pleasurable beer."
"2/11 On tap at Julian's in Providence. Dark amber caramel color, barely translucent with medium tan lacing. Looks thick and luxurious. Aroma of apple cider, caramel, bananas, and sour cherries. Absurdly thick mouthfeel with intitial taste of sweet apples that quickly gives way to sour. Very tasty. Some cereal on the finish. Hides it's alcohol very well."
"The drinkability is an exceptionally strong point. For how strong it is, it wasn't overwhelming. It drank like a good wine. As I said, I bought another bottle, which should say enough."
"750 ml bottle. Label read handcrafted in 2006 & blended in October 07, 11% alc./vol. Paper covering the cap read 00276. Served in my Gouden Carolus Carolus D'Or goblet. Poured a translucent caramel color with a tight off-white foamy head that consumed 3/4 of the glass before settling into a thin, consistent cap. Some specks of lacing present during the tasting. Nose was vinous and oaky; reminded me of a Cabernet. Taste consistent with nose; some acidity and tartness also revealed. Mouthfeel was light and lively with some astringency and a nice slick feeling. Lots of complexity, but a little too characteristic of a wine for my general enjoyment."
"This is a standout complex beer."
"D: Pretty good. One tasty brew."
"New rating: 8/4/6/3/13= 3.4"
"Strange and wonderful."
"Notes from 4/27/07"
"This beer is fantastic in bottle, but is just a complete joy on draft. Also, according to the beer menu at Max's, the abv. is dialed down considerably with the draft version. Not that it's exactly a session beer, but the 10% abv. on draft is much more manageable then the 15% plus I've generally seen in bottle. Regardless. In either format, this is a beer to be sought out and revered. Simply outstanding. More please."
"i had this at a nice little place called Beer Table in Park Slope, Brooklyn. At $18, it was by far the most expensive half pint or so that I've ever had. And while I was happy to be drinking it at the time, pretty soon after I left I knew that it hadn't been worth it. That's not to say it wasn't an interesting beer. It was served from a cask, very little (no?) carbonation, no head and no lacing. It was watery brown to red in color and had a slight sour smell and taste that was at first quite off-putting. But after a few more sips I got over this initial response and was able to enjoy it for what it is. Don't know that it's what most people would consider a beer, but it's full of complex, mixed flavors and, if you're feeling flush at least, is worth a try."
"07'. Dark orange color, unfiltered, with ample foam. La Folie-like aroma, intense funk, oak and cherries. Tremendously well balanced and very complex. Pleasant sourness, that unlike The Dissedent I tried a couple days ago, doesn't become overbearingly acidic. The oak component is really terrific and adds delicious notes of vanilla, toasted wood and also a unique vinous-like juiciness. A stunning effort and an expertly crafted ale."
"M + D: Marvelously dry and rich with a shimmer of carbonation giving it a quality of a sweet, high-carbonated red wine in some ways. A beautiful creation, and something of a masterpiece, imo. Recommended."
"While not overly heavy, this is somehow a sipping beer. It really reminds me a lot of a fruity, berry focused, oak aged red wine of some sort (with a touch of tartness thrown in). An interesting beer that is for sure, the slight carbonation makes it seem that much more wine-like. This is definitely a good sipping beer, I certainly wouldn't want to have to finish a bottle by myself."
"had on draft at beer table, brooklyn. would be very curious to try in a bottle, but the draft was too cool to pass up (only 3 barrels filled?!). slightly opaque deep red color with a quick dissapating head. strong sour woody smell masked the big booze almost entirely. sour grape and slight rotten fruit taste (in the best possible way). rich lingering woody aftertaste and puckering sour mouthfeel. amazing bev, ill have to get a bottle to age."
"..early in the sun with my boy stumac! ... pours a brown dark brown colour ... has oak, chocolate, cherries, tar and other grab bag candies ... tastes like cherries a bit ... bold yet still quite balanced, a great brew indeed ... quality and crazy mixed in a 750 bottle.."
"anyway, my main problem is that the price of admission is on the high side. you'll have to decide if it's worth it or not. considering you can get similar (or greater) complexity for less money, i'm really on the fence with this one."
"Poured maroonish light head smell was funky and sour .Tasted like sour cherries with some woodiness to it a little steep on the price but thanks to Bush I bought it anyways. Quite drinkable for a sour"
"Overall I was blown away by this one. I knew it would be good, I just did not think it would be this goo. Rich and full, vibrant and yet mellow and subdued. Easily one of the best I have had in a very long time and I would seek this one out again with no issue at all."
"Pours dark and cloudy maroon with light tan head. Smell is sweet and sour, funky and fruity. Some cherry in the nose. Taste is mildish, but of quite tart cherries and is somewhat vinuous in flavor too. Very smooth, yet tart red fruit was abundant. Really enjoyable. Thanks again!"
"Quite a price tag on this one and although good I doubt I will buy it again."
"Pours an orange chestnut with almost no head. Somewhat light smell, very tannic with oak, some acetic notes, some bitter non-hoppy notes and a touch of band-aid. Strange flavor. Very tannic, rubber bands, band-aids and much bitterness along with quite an acetic quality. Not great. Mouthfeel is thin and slick. Not very enjoyable. On top of everything else, it tastes quite hot."
"Very drinkable. But you can only have 1 bottle. Otherwise you'll fall right over! No serious it'll hurt you or someone you love if you don't watch it..."
"Overall: This is an amazing beer that is ideal to put in front of a wine snob and say oh yea? beer can't be as complex as wine can it. I thank the beer gods (along with the brewer) for crafting this delicious liquid"
"Mouthfeel is great and this is a very drinkable beer, the tastes are complex, the carbonation light and the experience damned near perfect. Hopefully this brewmaster will once again return to Monk's and bring more of these Swiss tasties!"
"Abbaye Bon-Chien is a delicious and complex woody sour cherry beer. I don't believe I'd pay the $25 asking price a second time, but this is still good beer."
"A nice sipper and a great experience. It's quite easy and gentle, but not too funky."
"Mouthfeel is rich and full without and sticky qualities. Nice carbonation. One of the most drinkable beers I have every had."
"Pours a hazy red/orange, thin white head forms, leaves some decent lace spots, settles to a solid ring, looks okay. Smell is great, sour, cherries, caramel and sweet malts, oak, bread, yeast, very complex and enjoyable aroma. Taste is earthy, lots of fruit, caramel, strawberries, sugars, oak, alcohol is superbly hidden, nice sour fruits, great. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with silky medium to low carbonation, super smooth, no way you can tell this is 15.5%. Fantastic beer, thanks Russ!"
"Murky red/amber color with a beige head, left a ring around the glass. I get some sour and oak notes, but not too much else, maybe some dark fruits. Lightly acidic, metallic, oak, and a touch of some sour cherry or other fruits in the taste; wasn't impressed. Lighter than medium body with a dry finish, light carbonation. Don't know that I'd have this one again, it didn't seem like an off bottle, just not very good."
"2005 vintage, bottle #276. This one was a little bit hazy and a dull reddish orange. It had a frothy ring of off-white foam and produced a bit of spotty, sticky lacing. The aroma was on the funky, tart side, with notes of lemon and berry, leather, straw, salt and faint alcohol. Tart, earthy and funky flavour. Crackery malt with a little bread and some floral, lemony character, plus mild sour/cherry. Medium bodied with carbonation on the low side with an incredibly smooth texture. Light warmth and a bit dry, with spicy alcohol flavour in the finish. Nice complexity, yet surprisingly mellow. This beer drinks like it's 6-7%, which can really get you in trouble!"
"Scored so as not to significantly rock the boat, which has some validity because there is such a wide interpretation of style 'allowed'."
"This limited edition, expensive beer would've had popped a cork if it had one, it was foaming that much out of the bottle like champagne. It was a murky burgundy color and formed a huge light tan bubbly head that vanished quickly with little lace considering how it bubbled out of the bottle. The aroma was a mix of cherry, grape, whiskey and wine. The flavor was of cherries, sour apples and slightly of prunes. It had a medium light body and a tart, sudsy finish to it. A good beer, but fairly expensive and limted release make it a rare treat."
"Edit: the more this warmed up the more the port flavors and sourness developed making this an exceptionally flavored beer. I will definitely buy another bottle if I ever see it again."
"the Swiss French Belgian beer like wine made by cats who are saints but are named after dogs! Gotta love it!"
"High carbonation adds to a bright and boisterous mouthfeel. Crisp and funky with a lot of warmth from the booze. The 11% abv is certainly noticeable. Very interesting and certainly worth a try."
"bottled in march 2007; limited to 1276 bottles for the Swiss market and 6000 for the USA; ahh, and of course I had the bottle #276, in case somebody still havent noticed that all bottles have the same number:-) - pours a hazy dark ruby-brown colour with no residual foam; the aroma is vinous, woody with notes of sour apples and pine needles; the solid malt body is supported by a fair carbonation; it has some initial sweetness followed and quickly dominated by a robust acidity/sourness; very long woody, fruity and sour finish; once again with the Saint Bon-Chien, the high alcohol content is well-hidden while you drink it but hurts when you reach the bottom of the bottle - very contemplative; one more great beer from Jérôme"
"drinkability is great. complex, balanced, with almost no trace of the 15.5% abv. it has the funk but without the acidity and sourness, and the fruit without lingering sweetness. an interesting and truly excellent beer. definitely looking forward to trying other vintages (or more of this one if i can find it)."
"The beer poured a hazy, dark brown color with a slight tan head into my BFM glass. The aroma of the beer was pleasing. There was some vinous qualities in the beer as well as some wood tones as well. This goes the same for the taste. There is a sour, vinous taste with some wood and earth notes as well. The taste is really dominated (in a good way) by a sour funkiness. I was originally suprised that this years version of Bon-Chien was this style but I really enjoy it and rate this up there with the other 2 years that I have had."
"Edit: Tried this again on tap and found it quite good, so my scores have been bumped accordingly."
"Cheers!"
"I owe Nick big time for this one."
"D: Again, much like a soothing red wine, yet sharing many qualities of a beer. The alcohol is masked very well, especially since it clocks in at 15.5%, this is no easy task. Flavors and complexity are phenomenal, and has excellent balance. This one is in a different class."
"D - An easy to drink well balanced and slightly sour ale. This would probably benefit well from aging. Perhaps some of the edges would round out. I kept coming back to this with a new appreciation in each sip."
"Had the 2009 version at Bar Volo, a great drinkable sour."
"Drinkability: This reminds me of a big, bold cabernet. The drinkability is great. I can't see myself refusing something so complex and bold. This was probably an expensive bottle, but seek it out if you wish."
"One of the best beers of all time. I've got to find bottles of this!"
"Definitely, improves as it warms - bottle says to be served 61-64 degrees. It is certainly best as it nears room temperature. One of the best beers I have ever had, and definitely worth the $35."
"2005 Vintage. Pours a dark copper to amber red, hazy, with a very small flash of cream and white bubbles that gather on the surface and quickly disappear. Aroma is of nice tart apples and mellow sweet cherries, slightly lemony as well, along with some spices, vanilla, and dessert breadiness. Taste is a good sized tartness, slightly perfumy and soapy. A sweet fruitiness flashes mid-taste before a good sized woody dryness blends with the tartness into the aftertaste. Medium in body, mainly still with a good sized dryness that accentuates the tartness. Very nice aroma on this beer, the taste was very good as well, not as multi dimensional as the aroma though in my opinion. While I definitely enjoyed the tart flavors the perfumy and soapy finish to the tartness was not as pleasing. Alcohol was not completely unnoticeable but did not at all seem to be in the 15 percent range as stated on the label. Very enjoyable and interesting beer."
"The body is surprisingly thin. Silky smooth. Rounded out nicely in the oak. Little carbonation to speak of. Not even a hint of alcohol. Would be just as refreshing in the heat of summer as in the cold of winter. Highly recommended if you can get your mitts on this rare gem."
"Bottle courtesy of IMtheOptimator: Poured a medium amber color ale with a small foamy head with limited retention or lacing. Aroma of oak and tart is pretty enticing. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt, oak and some vinous character. Body was about medium full with some very low carbonation. I could not detect any alcohol which is quite a feat at 14% but could feel the effect afterward. Interesting combination between the malt presence of a Biere de Garde and a Flander Red oak presence."
"Just awesome.Glad I tried this beer. I remeber this 750ml bottle was a pretty penny. But worth every cent."
"Overall, this beer is good but not nearly as good as the 2004 vintage. Maybe it's just the bottles I've gotten, but the 2005 just isn't as well integrated as it could be; it has too much alcohol present and the brett overtakes some of the other flavors instead of supporting them. Good but not great."
"Without question, this is one of the highest quality beers that I have ever had the pleasure to drink. But don't buy this thinking that you're getting a standard biere de Garde.... it's much more than that. If you have any wino friends that you're trying to advocate good beer to, this is the one. Supposedly this was one of only twelve bottles that made it into VA. Personally, I feel that it was worth every penny of the $48 that I paid for it. Thanks to Jacob for getting this in."
"D: Smooth and very easy for 10% ABV. All that complexity makes it something to be savored. Not for everybody and certainly not for daily consumption, but a very very interesting drink."
"D: The ale is well-made and an interesting take on the french farmhouse style. The aging in various grape-based liquors has put a nice spin on the ale, even with a 10% abv."
"Thanks again, Clark!"
"750 ml bottle, 8 oz sample. This one pours a deep burgundy color with a very light head that settles at a ring around the top of the brew. This one has ruby highlites, with no carbonation and is fairly clear. Nice looker. The aroma on this one is big in tanniny oak, light puffs of alcohol, wine-like vinous fruits. Lots of wine character here. The flavor is even more divine. Huge Shiraz spiceyness and oak tannin character. It has a slight sourness, and a mild alcohol. This one is definately barrel aged first, with the beer being secondary to it. Definate notes of light mustyness as well. I really like this a lot. The feel is moderate, with no carbonation. It is pretty dry as well. I am very impressed with this one. It has a lot of really nice red wine character, with enough of the musty and sour character I like from a farmhouse beer. With the 10% ABV, it is detectable, but not at all obtrusive. I think it even adds a nice complexity here. This one was worth the big price tag."
"Truly a very wild ride. Deep brown and rusty in color -it looks like a glass of french roast coffee but shows good color separation. The nose is of bing cherries with a touch of booziness (perhaps from the use of grappa barrels). It's a little floral too, lavendar and exotic spices. Awesome stuff! A great beer to lay down a while (it still shows some youthful hard edges) and definitely a favorite for wine drinkers."
"Dark and opaque purple-brown color, head is fairly nice, big bubbles and average duration. Laces in fat rings. Boozy aroma, seems to have a lot of grape influence, but not being an appreciator of wines, it just seems rather heavy and oppressive. Mouthfeel is almost thick, carbonation underdone but still apparent. For me, a lot of the delicate spiciness and yeastiness of the beer (at least what may have been the original beer) is overwhelmed by a heavy application of alcohol as in fortified red wine, especially by the swallow, which has a peppery tannic quality to it. The impression seems very pronounced. Some bittersweet chocolate helps out on this one. Frankly, I can appreciate the time and effort in making this brew, but I'm not particularly impressed with the profile and its not worth the cost to me, but other's mileage should vary."
"I tried this yesterday at the Seattle International Beerfest. It is really hard to pin down what exactly was going on with it. First of all, it pours a translucent brown with a reddish tint to it. The tan head disappears almost instantly. Smelling it, one gets a wiff of fruit before beer, kind of an apple-grape mixture. There is no bite to it, the taste being incredibly smooth, and it feels almost like champagne on the tongue. Really toes the line between sparkling wine and beer. Aside from being exorbitantly pricey, manages to be a very drinkable beer despite the slight sourness and overall conglomerate of tastes."
