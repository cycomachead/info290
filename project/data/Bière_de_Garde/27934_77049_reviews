"O: Tastes much lighter than it looks, but full of flavor.  This beer would be great with lunch or at the end of the work day, just before dinner."

"This was my first try for this brewery, and I'm pretty impressed. This isn't a common style, but this beer is an example of the style done well."

"Would not hesitate to try other brews from Adelbert's."

"O Enjoyable beer, loved the flavor, backstory and the love and dedication that seems to have gone into this brew. Had from bomber in a Deep Ellum Cherry Double Brown Stout large snifter. Bottled: 12/13/12 Batch: 011 Bottle: 1801"
"From my tasting notes: It was a reddish copper color with a Belgian yeast and dark fruit aroma. The taste was sweet caramel malts, fruit and Belgian yeasts with a slight earthy tang. It was more subtle than the Shlafly biere de garde but with enough complexity to keep me interested and coming back for more. The Scrachin’ Hippo was great and puts Adelbert’s firmly on my radar."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy bone head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but nothing too memorable."

"O: Reminds me of an ESB somewhat, not as bitter and more malty. I expected more complexity, maybe I missed it. Certainly worth a try if you get a chance."

"Overall: A beer that is woefully undercarbed and poor tasting doesn't exactly win me over. Where are they scratchin' that hippo?"
"Pours out a nice deep hazy brown with reddish/amber hues toward the outer area of the ale, its topped off with a thick white, bubbly head that sticks around for some time. It’s got thick lacing too! The aroma is dry, very fruity, apples, grape and berries come through very well. Mildly tart, it is medium bodied, some spices do come through cleanly, phenolic alcohol tastes pretty good and is accompanied by mild bready flavors. Some fruit flavors do come through, there is a mild hop flavor in the aftertaste, but it is barely detectable. This is a very good beer and it goes down very smooth."

"Decent and quite drinkable. A unique interpretation of the style. Glad I got to try it. Without flaw, but unexciting."

"Poured from a 12 oz short bottle into a goblet glass. This pours a slightly hazy tea color with a large off white head which has good retention. The smells are of citrus, a little funk. The feel is medium very high carbonination. The taste is okay, you get the alcohol, a little funk, some citrus."

"The taste was practically more of the same. Mostly citrus with some young tree bark thrown in. It's got good yeast character that gives it an excellent mouthfeel and some character that prevents it from being thin, citrusy nastiness, but I'm not getting much malt character. And earthiness? Meh. It's just fruity, primarily on the citrus side. Surprisingly fresh-tasting citrus at that, considering that it was brewed 6 months ago. That didn't seem to mellow it any. I'm going to have to NOT suggest this. If you're looking for citrus, but with body (in a way that works oddly well), go for it, but if you want malty and earthy like it claims to be, don't expect much."
"750ml corked and caged, the way God intended! VERY assertive ""pop"" of the cork, this beer wants to be drunk. I know how it feels. It is hazy copper with a big head that settles into a rocky, sticky off white. It smells of bananas, brown sugar, hay, and vanilla. The taste is wood, leather, biscuity and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is tingly and sticky and I know there's a joke in there somewhere. Overall, its a very good beer. Good flavor, not quite as ""refreshing"" as I tend to imagine when I think of this style but more interesting at the same time. This hippo can scratch me any time. That is what the kids are calling it these days, right?"

"O: I would probably rate it higher after my second bottle in the future. It is easy to drink even thought it is my first biere de garde ale. Good job, Adelberts!"
""
"Watch out, it’s explosive...The pour itself is a burnt orange sort of color with a tall white head. The nose is much sweeter than expected. Lots of sweet malt and fruit notes with a bit of yeastiness. Quite a lot of apple to it. The flavor is heavy on the sweet sugar and malt notes. Lots of apple and pear fruit notes, maybe white grape, and a hint of banana. There is a mild yeastiness, too. Really an odd, though not unenjoyable, beer."

"If you're a fan on Belgian's, especially Duval's, this is for you! Its got nice almond-caramel notes. But it still has that signature Belgian bitterness. Adelbert's Brewery maybe a young brewery, but it sure as hell knows what its doing. I'd definitely buy a six pack if they sold them at my local store."
"Spicy like your grandma's lazy Susan. It's pretty too, with it's perfect little bubbles and dark honey color. Very appetizing. Big malty candy bar smell blends well with lazy Susan effect. I haven't a clue what spices; they all seem to form one coherent spice profile. Bubbly going down, and no residual stickiness. Impressive. I'll buy more."
"Once the beer calmed down a bit, it pours a clear orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma has a good bit of coriander and pepper, as well as some toffee and orange citrus notes. The flavor has quite a bit of toffee and caramel, as well as some strong Belgian yeast notes. There is also a hint of coriander. The carbonation is way too high and the mouthfeel is about medium. Not sure what this would taste like if the carbonation was normal, but I think it would probably be better."

"I'm lowering the overall score on account of the fact nearly half the beer went down my drain (and the cork launch terrified my sleeping cat Eenie)."
"O- Have now had this beer on draft and in bottle and I just don't get it. Does get a bit better as it warms."

"Cheers to a new Austin Brewery!"

"Corked and caged 750ml bottle. Cork comes out quickly with a loud POP! This thing is crazy carbonated, and a borderline gusher. Head hasnt quit coming out of the top of the bottle. The pour is dominated by head, but has a nice amber orange color to the pour. Great looking beer after it settles down, really nice head retention. Smell- band aid funk, nice breadiness, brown sugar, candied sugar. I theorize that the carbonation issues either come from yeast gone wild in the bottle conditioning process (too much fermentation process in the bottle) or some sort of infection. Tight white bubbles are visible on top of the beer, it reminds me of what some of my favorite wild ales look like. Band aid/plastic smell appears more after the head settles down. Taste- band aid, stingy carbonation. This lacks backbone. I wanted to have some sort of malt presence, but all I get here is a watery presence. I burped, got hardcore band aid. This beer is not good, I will blame it on the bottle being apparently infected, but I'm not sure I will give it another chance. Gross."
"Overall, glad to see another Texas brewery on the scene and I hope to try more of their beers in the coming weeks but this one isn't for me. Avail here in TX obviously. Rotation - one was enough [N;N]"
"Not bad, but a one and done for me. There are much better Belgian interpretations from Texas no less, and around the world available."
"O - A very nice beire de garde, a remarkable beer for so young a brewery."

"Overall- Mild for the style, not particularly interesting, but it's pretty darn tasty, and easy-drinking to boot. I'm not sure I'd pick it up regularly, but I might snag one on tap now and again."

"This is a light malty-amber color with thin lacing around the top. There’s a slight funky tart aroma. Hop bitterness hits you up front. The biere de garde tartness comes through on the palate with a lingering finish. There’s a pleasing maltiness that becomes more apparent as it warms. This beer has a bitterness and an edge which makes for a nice contrast with the malt flavor as it warms. Slightly funky, too, while remaining easy going. Effervescent and filling."

"This was a wholly forgettable offering. I'll have to try more beers in the future, but this initial offering makes me wonder how long they'll be around."
"t - good dubbel profile, with a nice lively tangy acidity. Better than average dubbel, but starts to get a bit dry the more you drink. B to B+."

"going to revisit this one in a year or two"
