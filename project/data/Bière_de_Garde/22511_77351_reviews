"Pours the color and clarity of cider.  Nose expresses cider vinegar and vanilla notes.  Taste consistent with nose but it comes off a bit watered-down.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a kiss of astringency.  All and all a decent beer but a bit off-style, although I can't say that I've ever had an oak-aged Biere de Mars."

"Amazing beer from Hill Farmstead- Vintage 2011 bottle"
""
""
"Bottle says 2013 vintage. Transparent medium-amber body with a soapy, off-white head. Lots of mini carbonation bubbles rise throughout the body. Aroma is of caramel malts, honey, hints of earthy funk, a dash of toasted oak and some floral qualities. Tart up front with the caramel malts and oak taking over next. Finish is tart and puckering with some lingering sweetness. The feel is medium bodied with crisp carbonation and a tart, prickly finish. A very good beer and very good for the style; toasted malts and oak and tartness with a hint of honey."

"Overall: I have only tried a handful of beers from the Beire de Garde family of beer styles. Aging this style in a wine barrel is a great idea. It compliments the beer style very nicely. This is the best that I have had out of all the Biere De Garde beers so far! Again another beer that is excuted so well by S. Hill."

"O: A terrific brew that manages to straddle the world of wine and beer, tangy dry tart and just a hint of wild sour yeasts are bold and unapologetic. Notable how the head holds strong on the brew from start to finish."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a decent brew with quite a unique overall feel. I say this brew is mediocre at best...than I think about the Biere de garde style as a whole and cannot think of any true standouts. For the style, id say this is well beyond average. Id drink it again if offered but id never attempt to trade for one considering what HF beers command."

"It didn't floor me like it seemed to have done for the majority, but definitely quite good. Biere de garde base funkified with a good amount of unique flavors."
""
"Biere de Garde that strikes a great balance between tart fruits, Brett funk (without overpowering), oak fermentation byproducts and souring bacteria. A damn fine brew that brings on some insane complexity."

"Amazing how much the wild yeast reminds me of brett. This is incredible beer."
"O - Funky, sour and dry with some orchard fruit flavors."

"O: Really good flavor, easy to drink and smooth. I would have liked it drier, but I wouldn't turn down another glass of this. Thanks again, Kevin!"
"The beer pours out a dark copper-amber color with a tiny scrim of caramel-white bubbles that mellow into a nice ring around the glass. In body, the beer is nearly a uniform color throughout with a rich opacity. On the nose, this beer reeks of beautiful funk; lemon-lime and horse blanket tango on the nostrils alongside nuances of pineapple, leather, cherry pie, and deep barnyard scents. What a beautiful nose on this beer. On the tongue, the beer tastes of a wonderfully balanced tartness alongside a smooth malt sweetness and just a kiss of herbal and spicy hop bitters at the back and finish. As the beer warms, a smooth and syrupy sweetness also starts to blanket the tongue throughout the sip, further pressing a nice balance throughout the beer. In flavor, the beer begins as pineapple juice and light caramel, slowly working its way to sweet barnyard and horse blanket. The finish blends horse blanket, caramel malt, pineapple juice, herbal hay, and grass notes onto the tongue. Soft touches of pine and this delicious yet unplaceable sweetness splash over the back of the palate. The aftertaste is a delicious blend of caramel and funk, almost like a softly candied funk. In the mouth, the beer is on the light side of medium, with a soft carbonation and a mouthfeel that is smooth and slightly syrupy. Overall, this is delicious and a perfect candidate for aging. The funk will only get better. Sometimes I want to dislike Hill Farmsteadâ€™s beer, but I never can. This beer is great."

"Pours a nice brown/amber, with a thin head, some bubbles on the side. Some decent lacing. Smells is very sour and a lot like wine. Some oak, dark fruits, funk. The taste is sour but not as sour as I thought, it might be perfect. There's a very soft mouthfeel and it's really smooth. There's some funk, oak, wine, sour cherry. Just enough carbonation to feel it on the tongue. Fairly light and refreshing. Really nice."

"A wonderful funky wild ale. Tons of complexity and the funk notes remind one of Cantillon's character."
"Overall this is the BEST biere de garde or saison for that matter that I've had the pleasure of enjoying. The oak aging on this is what elevates it and even though there are plenty of other great producers of the style like Jolly Pumpkin, Crooked Stave, Logsdon, and Prairie to name a few, HF nails it with Norma. Looking forward to snagging another bottle of this. Worldclass."

"Tart citrus upfront, finishes dry with some light woody spice and lightly bitter tannins. Medium body, crisp feel with ample creamy carbonation. Light sweetness in the middle. Overall pretty straightforward and not far off from HF's other wild and sour beers."

"Placed in a cellar for five months. Opened last night. Pours a garnet red into tulip glass. Smells a bit of oak, slightly sweet malt. First sip is tart, good carbonation but not overbearing. Medium bodied on the tongue. Finishes very dry, crisp all the way through.  Shared with a lovely gal who loved it.  When I asked why, she said maybe cuz it reminded her of a hard cider....for what that's worth..."

"A magnificently balanced and crafted beer with a ton of nuances that only Hill Farmstead could pull off. Delicate nose, flavor, and feel pull this one together just right. That being said, sometimes I want a little bit more distinctness and oomph to my beers. Still, this is, no question, an excellent brew and well worth seeking out."

"O- awesome! I have only had a few beers in this style, but this is as good or better than any i tried. I think the amount of tartness, spritzy carbonation and unique house yeast separate this from the rest and make for a very complex and refreshing brew."

"O - ery unique and amazing."
""
""

"O~ yup... amazing! why did i ever doubt it? well probably because Biere De Mars usually isn't my go to style but this definitely stands out from everyone i've ever had. a little of their saison style comes through as well, which i find in some of their beers like Abner and Wheat Is The New Hops. this is exactly what i love about HF. their well water also might have something to do with their outstanding brews. next time i go up there i'm totally asking them to fill a growler with their water haha."

"O-Another very nice offering from HF. Very complex beer that offers a wonderful blend of flavors that truly develop during tasting"
"O- This was another great beer from HF, but I wouldn't say I was blown away by it. It was slightly different then I was expecting having a slightly sweeter and less tart presence then I was expecting. I've only had a few Biere de Gardes as I wouldn't say it's a style that is brewed a lot, but this is easily the best of the style I've had and perhaps one of the best representations of the style out there. That being said I wouldn't say I enjoyed this that much more then Shaun's more common offerings such as Anna, Arthur, etc.. I highly recommend checking it out though and I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with fruit, acidic, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and grain flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great aromas and flavors that make this beer super easy to drink."
""
""

"O: another hit by HF, the hype behind this is not a let down, would like to see how age affects this."
""
""
""
"O- A very nice beer, the dry, vinous, oaky flavors and the fruity brett are really nice, the flavors are complex but very subtle, awesome stuff overall."
"Overall I would rank this second only to juicy in the HF lineup."
""
"O - Barrel touch adds to the Biere de Mars style, complex offering from a talented craftsmen ( team). The offering is a challenge, and a pleasure. What a treasure this is."
"This poured out as a deep amber color, the head was white and foamy. The retention was good and the lacing was decent. The smell of the beer was huge with fresh oak, very wooden and kind of funky. The aroma was quite impressive. The taste of the beer is malty, but has a softer oak flavor that I expected it to have judging by how strong the aroma is. There is a bit of light caramel in the aftertaste also. The mouthfeel medium bodied with a big amount of carbonation. The beer finishes on he dry side with a tart sting in the back of the tongue. Overall this beer is very nice, really impressive stuff."
""
""
""

"O - The first half of the glass left me a bit underwhelmed. The more I thought about the beer the more I liked it though. Its incredibly complex and unique. Super tart with a perfectly clean finish. It drinks way too easily. Certainly worth the effort to get a bottle in person."
""
"Heavy on the wine barrel, which brings an interesting tamarind and currant quality. Plenty of barnyard funkiness, too. Feels pretty big - good flavors but a bit heavy on the palate. Acidity is moderate. Finishes with lingering tamarind and red wine flavors. Pretty damn good, one of the better farmhouse ales from Hill Farmstead."

"Overall: Norma is a great rustic ale and I could imagine drinking it on some small farm in the middle of nowhere with fresh bread and homemade cheese. I do however think it is one of those beers that would have escaped notice had it not come from HF."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow, not only was this beer phenomenal, but everything about having it was perfect. A really clean and rustic beer, and borderline a wild ale. I would rate this just below Flora for taste. Thanks again Shaun, Dan, Phil, and Bob at HF for sharing!"
""

"Huge, huge thanks to yourefragile for sharing this beer. Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass. Pours a light reddish-brown color with a short tan head. Good retention and a good bit of lacing throughout. The nose carries some typical biere de garde character, with some semi-sweet malt and a touch of bread, followed up with a nice oak component. Also there is a bit of cherry alongside some faint acidity. The acid component grows through the flavor, leading the way to an exquisite mouthfeel -- dry, tart, and a nice bit of oak. Even after just having Ann, this was a beautiful beer and one of the better ones Iâ€™ve had in a long time. A great take on the biere de garde style, without being in name only."
"pour is orangish red with an off white head leaving a decent lace. Nose is heavy red wine, juicy dark grape, notes of oak, very rustic and pleasant. Taste is a bit muted, the red wine is there but the finish is a touch empty. More Brett but not pronounced, leathery and dusty. Body is light, assertive carbonation, and a touch of dryness to it."
""
"A very nice beer, delicate and complex with hints of oak, esters, yeast, mild funk, sweetness as well. An overall great beer and I'd have it again."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O A fantastic beer from HF as usual. This has developed some serious fruit notes and is starting to get a bit more sour."
""
"Mike"
"Pours a generally clear ruby brown with a large off white head. Long retention and sticky, thick lacing. Nose is a complex blend of sweet bread, malt, woodsy and earthy oak, vanilla, and yeasty spice. Flavor is more of the same as the nose, funky and earthy, spicy yeast and oak, mild vanilla and malt sweetness. Medium thick body, prickly carbonation, mild tartness in the finish. Just wow, as nice as Ann was, this was the standout for me. Edit: Early sample of the 2012 batch was equally special, with a little more barrel (port like) and fruit presence than I remembered from the 2011 bottle."
"Another winner from Shaun and Hill Farmstead. More confirmation that HF is one of the best breweries on the planet."
"Bottle. Hazy dark gold pour with white head, very pretty, almost glowing orange. Aroma has some brett, peach, lots of oak, vanilla, light buttery aroma, honey. Taste like TDD Dulcis, grape peel, honey, grain, butter, vanilla, very tasty. Not really sour but has a nice funk and a tart, citric finish. Palate is well carbed, and full bodied. Delicious."
"O - This is more wild then BiÃ¨re de Garde, no doubt. One of my favorite beers that I've had from HF (and I've had most all of them). I have one bottle left that I'm going to cellar for a year or so and revisit...hopefully, I'll run into another during that time. Recommend."
""
""
""

"D - Shaun's barrel-aging prowess and spontaneous culture have transformed a style I don't generally love into a very enjoyable experience. The oaky, earthy, and vinous notes balance out the malt character of the base quite nicely. That being said, it's not a beer I'd crave often - this may be too sophisticated for my palate."
"Overall awesome, I would call this an American wild over biere de garde, or saison, but delicious. Great wild funk, sour fruit, saison like malts, hunts of barrel, light biter hops late in the finish, and delicious delicious lacto."
"O - Overall this beer was one of the hardest I've had to review. It transcends styles and is so damn lacto. Its just delicious. Really outstanding. All areas of lacto in this with wild ale style funk and tartness. Really enjoyable beer. Like nothing I've ever had before and will probably never have again."
