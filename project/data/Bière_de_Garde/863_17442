Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells better than it tastes in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 19, 2013"

I’ve run out of –tion beers to tick here so if you have one I have not ticked, HIT ME UP! Big thanks goes out to BilbosNuts for procuring this growler for me! Shared by myself during BRoss242’s send-off party before he moves! Will miss you man! Served from growler into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured red-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grain, wheat, earth, spice, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, spice, grain, wheat, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I have really enjoyed most of the brews I have had on my –tion Quest and this one was no exception to this trend. It was really well balanced and quite complex for the style which made the growler quite enjoyable for all people in attendance of the tasting. Hope I get to experience the others in the near future.

The head and lace is some of the best I have ever seen. Many props to Russian River. The aroma is rather blunt. Toasted bread, raisins, pear, apple, and just a bit of Belgian yeast spice. The flavor is much more mellow then the nose would have you think. Nothing is very prevalent. Brown sugar, pear, and a bit of raisin. The flavor is not very complex but it is very satisfying. The mouthfeel is probably the weakest link, in my mind, of this beer. While it looks to be decently malty, is comes across as watery thin. This really surprised and slightly disappointed me.

Some caramel, freshly brewed lemon tea, and sweet honey. Very pleasant aroma, an absolute joy to sniff. Taste begins with more of the previous mentioned earthiness followed by sweet toffee and white grapes. Midway, more sweetness emerges with green apples and apricot followed by caramel and butterscotch. Aftertaste is slightly floral and fairly dry with a hint of cinnamon. The best part of the flavor (to me anyway) is the lack of Belgian yeast on the tongue. Medium body with a chewy and prickly feel from the high carbonation. Could be smoother, but still flows well between the cheeks. Scary thing, this is a borderline session beer to me. If I could get my hands on this on a regular basis it would be a constant in my fridge, perfect year round beer. Why this beer doesn't get more recognition is beyond me.

My bottle was listed as 6.6% ABV on the label This is already a year or so old (according to the RR bottle log) so this should give me a good idea of whether or not to age my other bottle (batch 003). nice, ruby-red and brown mixture with a nice ring of bubbles and a thin white film. It looks good. the first whiff is a metallic, earthy smell that I also picked up from Redemption. Just like Redemption the mineral aroma fades as it warms and leaves behind a very fruity juiciness. It almost like cutting open a lemon or watermelon but not exactly. The funny thing is that while it is not a strong aroma it begs you to take one whiff after another, very cool. The flavor is bready, malty, spicy, some hops I think and maybe citrus. The thing I like about this beer is that the aroma and flavor are very good yet very subtle. It really begs you to think about what you are drinking. There is also an odd flavor that makes me think of authentic Belgians as opposed to craft Belgian-style beers. Maybe it is RR's yeast because Redemption gave me the same feeling. In any case, definitely let this warm up and you will be rewarded.","ArrogantB","May 26, 2008"

The nose is very fresh and zesty: sassafras, clove, tangerine, and nutmeg. Estery belgian yeast flavors, tangy candied citrus within a mellow overall taste profile like nutty banana bread. The taste itself doesn't reveal much bitterness at all, but there's just enough hop edge to make the finish crisp and slightly lingering. The carbonation is fairly low and has a sort of tingly soda-like feel. The body is quite light, which feels somewhat surprising given the malty-spicy range of its aromas and tastes. It seems sacrilegious to say so, since this is really a nice beer, but if Dr. Pepper tasted really really good it might be something like this. They call this ""Biere de Sonoma"" to indicate it's sort of a stylistic experiment, and while I wouldn't yearn to have this every day, like pretty much everything I've tried from Russian River it is an interesting experience and well worth a try.","rashmore","May 07, 2008"

3.86,-2.5,4,3,4.5,4,3.5,"Appeared a rust color with a nice big head that left behind tremendous lacing. Translucent with a thin film covering the surface. Aromas of malt, dark fruit, heavy cream, and burnt wood. The taste was filled with juicy fruit flavors. Quite dry and yet slightly creamy in my mouth. Malt flavors seem to keep the hops in check throughout. Slightly sour finish. I liked this beer and I can see it pairing very nicely with an assortment of spice-filled dishes.","jaluria","Dec 25, 2006"
4.08,3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability: Overall I found Perdition to hide its alcohol well and have some pleasing fruit-like complexity, along with some yeast-driven sourness which created a nice bready backbone. However, its astringency kept me from wanting to have more than a glass.","RidiculedDisplay","Oct 29, 2006"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4," This was my first Biere de Garde. I found it to be similar to other styles I have had in the past. This was quite drinkable and I may need to venture further into the style.","EvilKeith","Oct 05, 2006"
4.17,5.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"It poured a copper color with a slight reddish hue and displayed moderate carbonation while retaining a nice head. With smells of a wonderful light hop aroma and a essence of spices. Taste is of gumball, bread, light spices. Not over done could drink this beer all night long.","sfoley333","Sep 30, 2006"
3.92,-1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Taste: Easy to drink, even though it had some vineous character it was rather light bodied in mouthfeel but still tasted malty. Sounds vague, I know, but bières de garde are a little off the wall like this sometimes, especially this one who totally had a ""west coast"" feel to it. It had a pleasing citrusy finish though. Another winner for RR in my book, taking a hard style to pin down and giving it their own personnal touch.","Goldorak","Sep 18, 2006"

3.58,-9.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I'm a huge fan or Russian River, probably my favorite brewery. Maybe my expectations are to high, I'm not sure. This beer just seemed plain to me. It's well balanced and drinkable, but just doesn't stand out. Very forgettable.","Callenak","Sep 04, 2006"
3.9,-1.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"It's pours a dark copper color, opaque - a small head. Touching the glass, the beer seems a little bit too cold. The aroma is of spice: cinnamon and clove and some mustiness. Toasted malts come through on the palate followed by a strong yeast. It goes well with Father's Office's incredibly delicious sweet potato fries.","sloejams","Aug 23, 2006"
4.45,12.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"The smell is good. Nice floral hops dominate the nose. Also a sweet barley malt accompanyied by some interesting sugars and spices. The taste is just as good, but the hops are accentuated and produce a nice crisp, dry, and deliciously bitter finish. Very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer for what it is, but I still haven't fed my longing for the Pliny's or one of the sour beers.","neonbrown82","Aug 14, 2006"

3.43,-13.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Lightweight and foamy, a little too quick to settle and disperse in the mouth. Fortunately later in the tasting, the body improves and with the yeast addition it gets even better. Easy drinking, just not overly interesting.","yelterdow","Apr 18, 2006"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"The flavor was mostly caramel and malt, the mouthfeel was good due to high carbonation. Strange that the head was thin with so much fizz.","TurdFurgison","Mar 29, 2006"
4.07,2.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"From my notes on recent trip, poured into a sampling glass, arrived a nice copper color without a head, with bits of lacing here and there. Aroma is matly with grains and a spicy and yeasty presense too. Taste is like aroma, the malts up front and spices right behind, finishes pretty nice. A good beer and one for the growler.","objectivemonkey","Jan 10, 2006"

4.7,18.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Another beer I was fortunate enough to try recently at the source in Santa Rosa. It was called a Biere de Gard on their board, a Belgian Pale on this site. To me, it seemed a Saison. Who cares??? Its a damn fine beer. It poured a deep cloudy amber, not much head, champagne carbonation. Fruity nose, pears, green apple. A bit of spice. Deep rich flavor, more pears, spice toffee sweetness. Thick mouth feel. Very drinkable.","carln26","Jun 29, 2005"
4.03,1.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cherry red body witha pinkish white head, good retention. Some dark fruit, sweet malt and caramel in the nose. Medium bodied, great drinkability and sweet. Quite a refreshing ale. Some cherry and raspberry flavours. Some phenols too. Very well made brew. Recommended.","baiser","Jun 01, 2005"
4.42,11.6,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"In the mouth there's a significant impression of dryness, but nonetheless the beer also feels very bready and, well, chewy. Dry yet chewy? Big biscuit flavor. A yeasty, spicy, hoppy biscuit. The hopping is quite apparent, and works far better than I would have expected. Weird. But satisfying. Oh so satisfying. Bready yet crisp and dry. I wish such wonderful, fresh, Belgian-style session ales were more readily available. Probably my favorite of the 'Tions so far.","Crotor","May 30, 2005"
4.33,9.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This seems to be RR's version of a Flemish daily single beer. Like Antwerpens Dekoninck or something to that effect. The colour is a kind of mid-orange/amber hue with some darker edges and a nice head of mostly pure white foam. The aromas are spicy Belgian leafy hops, and sweet biscuity candy-like malts. The spiciness of this brew is really nice, and many spices come to mind whilst sipping this great session-themed libation. Taste is doughy, and spicy with some nice hop flavors as well. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and drinkability is very good. A very good Belgian session-styled sipper.","francisweizen","Mar 09, 2005"
4.43,11.9,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Silky smooth entry with an earthy maltiness which slowly builds to a crescendo thru the midtaste. The finish is signaled by a subdued hop bite followed by an alternating malt / yeast fade. Aftertaste is spicy sweet with residual sugar left on the lips.","IceAce","Oct 05, 2004"
4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability  This is the beer that all the locals were ordering by the pitcher. Its a terrific Belgian session ale that I just couldnt get enough of.","RoyalT","Jun 14, 2004"
3.75,-5.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I had this beer at Pizza Port in Solana Beach. The beer poured a reddish brown with a light head on top. The aroma is a floral and sweet smell. The flavors sinks with sour cherry, wheat, and dry apricot. On the mouth it is a bit thin and light bodied which doesn't seem to match the coarse flavors in the beer. It could be a daily drinker for some because it is full flavored without getting crazy on your tongue.","BrewMaster","May 24, 2004"
4.42,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours golden amber with a semi-creamy white head that is moderate in size, a nice sheet of concealing lace seals off the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and a bit spicy, nice yeast presence and the start continues the sweet malt with the top being a bit more than moderate in its feel to the palate. Pertinent acidity, the hops masterful in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a real treat and a great example of the brewers art.","Gusler","May 09, 2004"

2.86,-27.8,4,3,2.5,4,2.5,"Well I guess I just don't have the make up to like Belgian style beer. I really am trying, I want to join the club, get with the program. Russian River is Belgian heaven, out of Belgium. So you Belgian lovers, the worse I make it sound, the more you will love em. This beer poured an attractive copper, tan head lasted and left nice lacing. Nose was the typical of the style, yeasty and fruity. A hodgepodge of flavors assaulted you on this one. Spice, cinnamon, pear, and a hint of banana. It also had a lightly toasted hint to it. Probably a great beer to somebody other than me.","Mark","0"
