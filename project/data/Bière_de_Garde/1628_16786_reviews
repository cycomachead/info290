"A decent brew but seems to lack obvious large yeast and noticeable properties that seem to make the style so distinct.  A very subtle garde but also real easy drinking because of that."
"Excellent beer. Very smooth taste. Aroma doesn't justify the taste. Must try on tap not bottle"
""
"Overall: this is an interesting beer; it starts out a bit underwhelming but builds into something rather nice."
"I feel like I once tried this beer back in my NoVa days, but I can't be sure.  Oh well, gonna haveta have it (potentially) again.  Problems such as these...  Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear golden amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweet biscuit, light toffee, orange zest, a twinge of lemon peel, and a slight hint of what may or may not be apricot.  The taste brings in more of the same, some spices tossed in for the sake of it, particularly black pepper and mild clove.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a pretty nice beer, one I could see drinking again, though it's unlikely to find its way to the top of my prospective list."
"Nothing particularly pops, but still a simple malt and yeast character that works.  If not particularly exceptional, still very enjoyable."
"Overall, I liked this and consider it an above average beer, First Bier de Mars, so I am far from being able to rate this against others in this type.  I also think this is a style that should be drunk very fresh, and closer to season, which I unfortunately did not do.  That being said, I would look for this again, and would look for the Brewer again as well."

"Overall pleasant enough but there is nothing memorable here,"
"O: ok but nothing special"

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium bronze amber with a  half finger white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of bready, mildy caramel malt, Belgian yeast, apple juice, light vinous mustiness. Flavor follows aroma with bready and caramel malt, light toffee, apple and grape juice, Belgian yeast; lightly buttery spicy. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A nice domestic take on a Biere de garde, with a nice balanced variety of malt and fruit flavors, satisfying mouth feel. Nicely done."

"Feel: excellent creamy but lively feel with medium+ body."

"Overall - my first time with this style, not a huge departure from a traditional amber ale. I'm glad to have tried this."
""
""
"Pours a golden copper with a finger of head. The nose is yeasty and there is also some sweet note as well - syrup or perhaps molasses. The malt is quite forward considering the body is fairly light. There is the classic Belgian funky tartness but it is relatively mild. The finish is semi-dry."
""
""
" This beer is lovely.Malt forward in a way that is playful and with a fruit character that is as lovely as the thought of the fruit itself. I like this style very much and it's my first time with it. I would call it subtle and a bit savory with an elegant taste of fruit."

"O: Overall it feels like an octoberfest, sweetly malted with a bit of musky, yeasty saison quality. Nobel hop presence and a solid good making per style. Good drinkability."
"O: I really expected more out of this one. Could definitely say its refreshing, but thats about it. Scent and taste are weak and I would have liked a bit of a drier crisper finish. Definitely needs more to it if its going to be 6.5%"
""
""
"The Rest: To be fair, this is a style I don't have a lot of expirence with. It reminds me somewhat of a dubble, but the malt and sweetness is just a bit too unbalanced."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, pear, apple, grape, bread, clove, pepper, floral, herbal, light coriander, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, bread, pear, apple, clove, pepper, light coriander, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, bread, light fruits, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with decent robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. A bit too dry on the flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good biere de garde style. Good complexity and balance of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. Needed a bit more malt in the flavors, but otherwise a nicely enjoyable offering."
""
"Beer is medium in body with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a mostly smooth, only slightly foamy, mouthfeel. A bit more carbonation would probably help with aromatics, as well as assist the mouthfeel reaching the typical carbonation level for the style. Closes dry with slight astringency on the palate and stickiness around the lips, appropriate for the beer and the style in general."
"Beer from trade with jrgratz (though the bottle looks more pedestrian than the picture here). Thanks! Pours clear copper with small white head. Aroma smells like a lager/marzen. Sweet malt with a hint of spice. Flavor has up front yeast funk with a bit of spice and bitterness. Lingering funk on the palate. Light mouthfeel with medium-high carbonation. Not bad."
""
"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable though fairly malty - pairs really nicely with some spicy foods."
""
""
""
"Orange-gold hue under a tight, creamy head. Sweet, bready malt aromas upfront, with some pear, flowers, coriander, and lemon. Flavors are primarily bready and sweet, much like the nose, along with spiced apple, light cherry, and dried fruits. Medium-bodied, slick, and clingy on the palate. A little too sweet for my liking, but decent."
"Poured into a small tulip glass a lighter amber shade with one finger sticky slight off white head atop.Aromas a lightly spiced with some breadiness and mild citrus fruits.flavors are also lightly spiced with yeasty tones along with some pear and more citrus.A pretty basic but pleasant Biere de Garde,I imagine it would be very food friendly,I would have liked a little more pilsner malt flavor to come through."

"High B-"
"Overall: Really a restrained beer that shows it's strengths when you pay a little more attention to it. Definitely not a beer that makes a real strong first impression but has some Saison like qualities and also some Kolsch traits."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not unpleasant, but the flavor profile was fairly subdued and one dimensional."
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed this brew quite a bit. I enjoyed some of the unique aspects of it and the only negative thing I could say was just about the flatness of it."
""

"Stopped by the publick house for a bite and to pick up some IRS bottles. Ordered a flight with bratwurst. Brew arrivedin a few ounce sample pour. Transparent yellow with thin fizzy head. Nose is fairly muted but has nice floral taste with Mellon and assorted fruitiness. Really nice. Very light and easy drinking. As i sipped the fruit came out on the nose. Pleasant beer."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy beige color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of rustic malt with lightly sweet undertones. Taste is dominated by sweet notes upfront with some rustic malt and light fruity ester. This is probably a tad too sweet for my liking. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Good though probably tad more sweet then some of its overseas cousin."
"D: a pretty fruity brew and unfortunately in my opinion a bit one note. fruit is the main everything here and while pleasant I wouldn't hate for some more diversity in both flavor and aroma. there are better BDG out there and better brews from Southampton."
""
"It's not my favorite style. The beer is only just slightly better than average. It's not difficult to drink, it's just lacking some character."
""
""
"Overall - Not what I expected when I ordered it. Not interesting enough to overcome its flaws."
""
""
"O: American brewers latched on to the saison style fairly quickly, and are now pushing the boundaries of the style with black saisons and the like. I'm surprised that the Biere de Mars/Biere de Garde styles remain relatively unexplored. It seems to me that there would be a market for it, with all the saison experimentation that's going on. I found this to be a very enjoyable beer."
"just found this at a small grocery in central new york. was in a 6er and the bottles were dusty. i knew it couldnt be the freshest, as this is traditionally a springtime release, but i picked it up because id never had anything from southampton and didnt feel like a becks, which was my next best choice unfortunately. was happily delighted by this beer, which pours a toasted orange color, more clear than i am used to in the style, with effervescent carbonation and a short off white head. the nose is fruity like orange rind, with some mild sweetness and belgian style yeast spice tones. flavor matches up, with a really bright feel attatched to the fruit and spice, there is nothing heavy about this brew at all. crackery crisp in the finish, with the zesty orange lasting all the way through the flavor matrix. this is a beautiful beer, balanced and clean, i could only imagine how nice it might be fresh. light body, down easy. if i wasnt sharing the 6er i would have put it down alone easily. this makes me want to drink more beers from this place, nice brew!"

"OVERALL: Pretty solid, but a bit unusual. I would absolutely reach for this one again if I were in the Northeast."
""
""

"Poured into a tulip glass. Color was a dark amber with a 1 finger dirty white creamy head. Head only lasted a few minutes despite a fair amount of carbonation rising from the sides. Aroma was roasted grains with a small bit of fruit sweetness that almost hid a bit of alcohol smell. Flavor as a malty sweet. Small hint of peppery spice. Alcohol was detectable and came on pretty fast. Felt good in the mouth, coated well and had a tad of carbonation. Overall not bad. Well balanced, and sippable, but not outstanding."
""
"Overall a pleasant beer from a good brewery. Wouldnt mind giving this a go on draft."
""
"This one didn't work as much for me."
""
""
"O: Interesting spice notes coming thru with just a hint of maltyness fighting its way onto the palette before the hops bitterness rushes it away."
""
""
"Pretty drinkable but I like a Biere de Garde to be a little less spiced."
""
"From the 12 oz bottle, oddly enough available at the supermarket in DC."
""
""
"Pours copper colored and hazy with little to no head and some lacing. The aroma is apple cidar with savory notes and fruity undertones. The taste is right in line with the aroma and the mouthfeel is rich but not sweet. I am drinking this beer at the end of May and I think it would be better enjoyed in its intended month of March with the cold weather still in the air. Good beer but bad timing."
""
""
"Much improved from the bottle version, with a lower carbonation, smoother mouthfeel, fuller body. Still a little one dimensional, quite malty, with caramel and honey sweetness and very restrained floral hops. Hints of black pepper and other spices (cloves and coriander, mostly). Not yeasty enough for my tastes; mostly just doughy, bready malt flavor. Lightly hazed orange color with a small white head, decent retention and lacing. A bit unexciting overall."
""
""
""
"Overall good balance of flavors, good spices, pretty sweet but has a bit of hops to help balance it"
"Draught @ Cambridge House: This one pours a crystal clear, slightly darker amber color. There was just a wisp of an off white head that still left some lacing. There is a pleasant nose to it. Mainly malts and some fruits. Hints of Belgian yeast also. The taste is also very good. Just a touch Belgian style sweet. Caramel malts, some fruits and earthy hops. Very smooth and easy drinking. A nice beer."
"O- I wouldn't call this bland, but I was hoping for so much more from this fantastic brewery. Not bad, but I'm not sure I'll be buying this again anytime soon."
"I'd gladly give this one a shot again if I knew how fresh it was. Until then I'll have to pass."
"This has the sourness that one expects from a Farmhouse styled beer. Mostly malty but there is a touch of light spice from the hop. Smooth body with a long peppery aftertaste. Lowly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good- medium body with light to moderate carbonation. This is a strange brew- seems to me to be a mix of styles. I've only had three Biere de Garde's (Oro de Calabaza, Jack's Abby's and this) and they've all tasted quite different. Hard to say what's going on..."
""
""
""
""
"O- Good beer but expected more fruit dominant flavors. Not very complex and would like a little more to this beer."
"D - A good beer. Might not get it again, but it's one of the only Bierre De Garde's I've seen an American brewery put in a 12 oz bottle, so Publick deserves credit for that at least. Worth trying. It's not often you get a Bierre de Garde from a 120z bottle."
""
""
""
"O: it is enjoyable enough, i could drink a couple but i must be honest im not particularly fond of the style, that is, if this is a good representation of the style"
""
"O- great beer, i will def pick up some more, so good for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is taste but not my favorite of the style."
"I don't think this was a bad or old bottle... I just believe it wasn't done well. If I am wrong, somebody please approach me and I will happily trade for a different bottle. Cheers, Toby."
""
"O: Incredibly refreshing and easy drinking. Great for warmer weather."
""
""
"Overall it's a very good choice to kick back with."
""
"Wow - balanced and really sessionable. Very good stuff that is a party pleaser for sure. Spot on stuff here, really digging this one."
"Had more hopes for Southampton on this one. Can't win 'em all."
"Overall-not impressed and a little disappointed on this one. I usually love southampton too. :("
""
"VERY GOOD, WORTH GRABBING!"

"I will make this quick, but bottom line is I really like this cheap beer I found. A great deal at under $8 for a sixer. It is pretty looking with a great reddish hue, sweet and malty smelling and very refreshing and fruity notes of grapfruit and mango. I will be having many more of these. I am gaining more and more respect for Southampton. Gonna try their Grand Cru and Abt 12 soon. Mark my words."

"Pours a clear amberish gold with a medium sized head. Smell is weak. Malty with some fruit. Big malty flavor. Toffee. Just a little toasty. Hoppy bitterness throughout. Just a little sweetness underneath rounds things out. Phenolic and earthy in the finish. Well carbonated and medium bodied. Pretty drinkable and overall a good beer."
""
""
"O: This beer does have a couple of decent qualities, but it fails in the flavor category."
""
""
""
"A nice copper / bronze hue on the pour with a small short lived white head. Aroma of sweet malt, some light floral citrus hops and nice spicy fruity notes. Taste is sweet malt some nice spicy fruitiness some light hops and maybe some light vanilla flavoring. Palate is nice smooth slightly creamy texture, medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt some light hops ending in slightly spicy fruitiness with some light vanilla flavoring. Overall a very nicely balance and flavorful brew."
"O: I thought this would be a style that Southampton would nail but this beer has an odd, very unpleasant aroma and flavor. Would like to try it on tap or (even better) the 750mL version some day for comparison."
"O: Easy drinking. Glad I was able to try this."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, malts. Taste is also of malts and grains, some hops at the finish, not bad but nothing special. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"O-meh."
"Overall, nice beer and great style."
"I've had this from the more recent 12oz bottles as well, and a bunch of times on tap. it never compared to that first 750ml Publick House bottle, which was just lovely in its fine nuance and subtlety."
"Overall, another shining example of why the Publick House of SH is Long Island's beer scene. Another terrific offering!"
"The beer pours a beautiful amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a delicate mix of caramel malt sweetness, Victory malt nuttiness, and a wonderful yeast fruitiness. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, caramel flavor with a subtle yeast fruitiness. It's mellow with a faint nuttiness and silky finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a really good beer; true to style and quite delicious."
"O - I quite liked it. No over-the-top flavors; just a solid, good tasting beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, a clear golden orange with no head to speak of by the time it reached me. Thin aroma, bready, with hints of peach. Taste was fruity up front, peach and banana, yeasty in the background, followed by a distinct sour citrus zest, and a lingering bitterness. Medium body and smooth; fairly drinkable."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are all really nicely balanced. The toasted caramel malt flavor in particular is really nice that it avoids tasting coppery."
"I'll say what probably many who try this beer may think (and say) that it's a very interesting beer. It pours golden with a brown/orange hue with a thinner head. The smell upfront is a strong spice which I can't quite place, but I'd describe it as savory. This is a beer that may need some meat to back it up, definitely needs to be paired with a meal. The spice fades a bit as I drink on revealing a sweeter honey like flavor beneath. Lacking in hops I wanted something with an older mustier taste to it. The beer is a little sticky but not bad by any right."
"Many likable elements, but just misses on a few areas. A little mushy, a little soft. Not a great intro to the style, but not horrible either."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer that I will try again soon."
"12 oz. Bright amber/orange color with a short cap of whitish foam. A little bit of lacing, decent head retention. Crockery malt aroma, grassy and spicy hops, rich maltiness, hint of fruit. Medium/light bitterness, malty with a bready, sugary sweetness, biscuity, a little spicy in the finish. Lingering sweetness with faint herbal hops. Nice texture, medium bodied with lowish, nearly creamy carbonation. Semi-dry. I liked this quite a bit. It was highly drinkable and had a rich malty backbone."
"Overall: quite a good offering from Southampton. Nice flavor, and I'm thinking that given my lack of experience with this style that its probably more or less to style, considering that brewmaster Phil Markowski wrote the book on farmhouse ales, literally. I would give this one a try. Cheers!"
"It's not a beer that I'd drink a whole lot of once, even though the 6.5% ABV makes it possible for those who are used to the big beers. The beer is quite flavorful and it really fatigues the taste buds after a couple, but the taste complexities are worth the effort."
"D - A very nice unique spring seasonal offering from the fine folks at Southampton... Nothing remarkable and nothing off putting... Simple, straight forward, and most importantly rather tasty..."
"Overall: a nice spring beer that is more of a slow drinking beer, but nicely flavorful and satisfying."
"Taste is interesting when diagnosed. Its subtly fruity, just like the smell, but not cloyingly. A sweet honey taste wins out over that taste, however, and is followed by a hoppy and sort of abrupt finish. There's a bitterness to the finish. The beer becomes further complex with an alcohol zest that lingers after the swallow. It's a really interesting beer and complex but fairly refreshing and easy to drink. One criticism, however, is a slight wateriness to the mouthfeel that may be overlooked if your not looking for it, but it is noticeable. Otherwise, its a pretty good beer, and one that will have your taste buds working hard."
"O - Not a huge fan, some of the tastes a re just a little too off for me. Glad to have tried the original bottling, but either it hasn't held up well or it was just off to begin with."
"D - I'm guessing this was better around March 2008. At this stage it's mostly bland and inoffensive. Not something I'd seek out again, but no major flaws either. I'm curious how it compares to a fresh bottle of the 12oz contract brewed version."
"O - Meh, not my kinda beer. Not really digging this one."
"Overall: A tasty beer and fairly refreshing, making it an ideal Springtime brew. Though, in this instance, I had it on-tap, it is nice to see it available in 12 ounce bottle."
"This is definitely a good warm weather beer, very refreshing and it has good flavor also."
"This is a very good spring beer to start changing your pallet over from the great darker beers of winter. I was so impressed With it on tap that I had to bring a growler home. If you are in Southampton I highly recommend trying it. Enjoy!"
"O - Great flavor, mouthfeel, and drinkability. Maybe the best SH I've had to date."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a nicely drinkable beer that I could see having again one day. I'll not go out of my way to get it but I'll certainly not pass it by if I've another chance to have one. My overall impression is that this is a very good beer that has several virtues and few weaknesses."
"Overall: Impressive structure. Very nicely put together. It's big, but not to big; and the spicing is full but not overdone. Well balanced. Flavorful. Still refreshing. Quite nice!"
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. light copper color half inch head faded very quickly to just beer almost no lace. smells sweet and musty like old brewed tea. sweet malty taste hint of caramel, alcohol, oily feel to it after taste of old tea, poor carbonation overall very disappointed i have had southampton's double white which is excellent but i will not buy this beer again."
"Served in an Ommegang goblet. Nice amber-orange color with a thick white head. Spicy aroma. Sweet flavor at first taste, with a nice peppery compliment and a little bit of bitterness. The tail end drys up nicely. A little hint of alcohol, but overall very refreshing beer. Nice to taste a good American made version of this style."
"overall, pretty good. not terribly familiar with the style, but this is a tasty brew I wouldn't mind on a temperate spring day."
" The taste is good w/ a nice blend of malt tinges and yeast flavor which gives a nice apple and spice flavor w/ light appleskin tannin in the finish. Overall I think this is a pretty decent beer, not really one I would order repeatedly because it comes off as slightly sweet after the first few sips and lacks some malt of a more traditional example IMO."
"I'd buy this again without question."
"D: The alcohol is present, but it is not overpowering. It is complex with a nice musty earth, mild dry fruit sweetness, and some bitterness from the hops."
"drinkability; alcohol is well hidden and overall a tasty brew, quite easy to drink a 6 pack in one sitting."
"Cheers!"
"Would work well with my favorite summertime lunch of salads, grilled meats, cheese and breads."
"Value: Made by PABST. Great!"
"Appearance is very nice. I got no debris in the glass yet no head due to the being being a spring release. Color is a dirty orange. Smell is of mild grass and caramel. Taste is on the sweet side with quite a bit of bread and rye. Maybe some citrus? Sweet bready finish makes this beer a treat. Mouth feel is pretty nice with a very light to medium body. For the drinkability I would really have to have this fresh since it really could use more carbonation but overall it was a very interesting farmhouse ale."
"D: This tastes like a sweeter and thicker version of Belhaven, believe it or not."
"All in all, this brew was not good. The flavors it did have blended in a very unpleasant way. Don't bother hunting or trying if you have access."
"Very easy to drink this one and it pairs nicely with all kinds of foods."
"Flavorful: no doubt."
"Extremely drinkable, very close in its clean, malt-accented nature to the German ""March"" beer, Märzen. Light-bodied, moderately carbonated, easy-drinking and wonderfully tasty, this is the perfect spring/summer brew. While the sweetness could become cloying after a while, and while the alcohol content is a tad high for sessionability, this brew is certainly poised for drinkability and refreshment."
"Drinks really easy, a good take on the style. Hopefully some fresh bottles will be around next spring, when I'm more into this style. Still holds up nicely on a hot Summer night.."
"A smooth and creamy beer with nice carbonation. The smells and flavors were all there and blended nicely. A pretty solid beer."
"A fluffy thick tan head sits atop a reddish-golden brew. Decent retention with a thin sheet of lace leftover. Complex and super sweet to the nose with some sour fruits, fresh beer bread, a bit of citrus and Tastes spicy with sweet caramel middle and a piquant ending. Medium bodied and goes down creamy in the middle with some toasted edges. A syrupy sweetness is left on the lips. After it warms a faint alcohol heat is noticed, but otherwise this beer is all sweet and innocent, just as it should be."
"T- It's a very smooth and mild beer. There's a sweetness there, Caramel or citrus. Maybe both. Good relaxing beer even if nothing truly jumps out."
"D: This is a decent brew, but a little disappointing. Aroma is too faint and flavor a bit too subdued. I'm glad I tried it, but doubt I'll buy it again."
"Very interesting beer. I haven't had many Beire de Gardes, so I don't really have much to compare this against. Overall it is enjoyable."
"Honey golden with a dense white head that leaves plenty of fine lace on the glass. Toasted grain and caramely fruity sweetness and faint floral hop and spice aroma. Mild tasting with white fleshed fruit, some faint Belgian spice and mild toffee sweetness balanced with slightly dry yeast and a mild noble hop bitterness. Medium light bodied with seltzery carbonation. A tasty lighter beer that's good for cooling off on a hot day."
"Pours a yellow to orange-ish color with a nice white head. In the aroma, a sweet malltiness and somewhat lager like. In the taste, a nice maltiness and a nice balance hop. A smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel, and a clean, small hop aftertaste. A nice hop presence and nice balance."
"A very nice and quite drinkable ale that's remarkably refined and smooth. In fact, what this one may be missing is the very slightly rustic and unfiltered character that the artisanal Belgo-French examples often exhibit. It's certainly apparent that the author of ""Farmhouse Ales"" truly knows his farmhouse ales."
"quite malty for a farmhouse ale. prominent hop character. the spice lends a slightly funky character, which, i think, the hops are contributing to. toasty and nutty flavors from restrained kilning. actually it's quite toasty. but there's not much sign of farmhouse, to be honest"
"All and all a good beer. An aquired taste but I wouldn't mind having another one."
"12oz. bottle served at 48 degrees in my Allagash chalice. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a one inch, loose, bright white head. Copious tiny bubbles clung to edges of the glass and effervesced from the base to the underside of the cap. Head eventually settles into a broken skim with a few random strands of lacing present during the tasting. Subtle nose - some light malt (perhaps a trace of caramel), some citrus and a grassy quality. Taste follows nose - very tasty and lacking some of the bitterness I've come to associate with beers of this style. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and a somewhat crisp finish. A pretty nice beer I have to say. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again. I recommend this to those seeking a solid and clean biere de mars with a solid spice and herbal profile."
"d: Not bad overall, just kind of lifeless."
"Drinkability: I like the peachy funky combination. A good beer I could have several of especially in hot weather. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Had a bottle with dinner at Liberty St. Tavern. I drank this with dinner and while it was a nice beer, it wasn't as outstanding as most Southampton beers I'm used too. In terms of Belgian beers, it was on par with Leffe. It was agreeable, but a little sweet and without much depth. It had a herbal sweetness liek gum or tea and a cleaner amber bread flavor than you usually have in a Belgian. Good beer, but not great."
"D: This isn't a bad beer; it's not a brew that is difficult to drink or anything, just somewhat dull. I'd still take this over any macro like Corona or Bud. I'm sure that's not something a brewery wants to hear, but that's how I perceived this one. I have five more, so perhaps there will be something that I don't notice in the next few."
"Pours an orangish golden with a finely beaded white head that fades to a thin cap. Slightly grainy aroma with orange notes and a touch of spice. Tastes very juicy and fruity with a nice orange peel bitterness that builds and some accents of coriander. Some bready notes round it out. Very refreshing and a wonderful thirst quencher on a hot Southern day- but with enough flavor to keep things interesting. A solid beer in a style that's hard to find. I'm reviewing a 12 oz bottle from a six-pack- a very nice thing to see given the rarity of the style."
"EDIT: (10/17/10) Heard a talk by Phil Markowski recently where he explained the differences between Saison, Biere de Garde, and Biere de Mars. Much subtle info I wasn't aware of - quite interesting. Hoping that I can approach this more aware next time."
"Very yeasty to start, with a tinge of hoppiness, without any of the balanced sweet malts you might expect from a Biere de Garde. Generally speaking this beer screams spring, and pairs very nicely with a salad or something of that sort. Only major disappointment was how light the mouthfeel was - it was nearly watery."
"I had higher expectations for this one - glad to try it none the less."
"Where this beer truly excels is in the mouthfeel. Light and crisp on the palate."
"Nice to see the Biere de Mars in 12 ounce bottles even though this one is being contracted at the old Rolling Rock brewery in Latrobe, PA. Appears a nice copper amber hue with a bright white head fine delicate head soft carbonation forms intricate fine lacing going on. Aroma has mild spices with caramel malts going on with a mild funk character going on from the yeast used, also earthy citrus notes in the background with centennial hops utilized. Flavor has a spiced creamy caramel tone with sharp finishing bitterness herbal and mild citrus tones crazy brew. Mouthfeel has a medium body with sturdy carbonation going on, finishes dry with spice additions. Drinkability overall is tasty stuff, that I appreciate contract 12 ounce bottles of but would much rater see it in 750ml bottles brewed by Phil at Sly Fox Royersford."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and would be great to sit outside with on a nice spring day."
"The flavor is sweet grain malt with the bananas and spices both showing up. There is a nice and moderate hop edge in the center of the profile that goes nicely with the fruit flavor. The green apple shows up with the hops by way of a slight and dry fermented fruit taste. A little musky. Overall a good and somewhat different spring beer. Maybe one of my new go to's this summer. The mouth feel is medium with a light and crisp finish, only a slight aftertaste."
"This is my first from Southampton, and though I would not go out and buy this beer regularly, I am certainly now interested in trying more offerings by them."
"This is a really great beer."
"Very drinkable and an excellent accompaniment to the cheese plate I enjoyed that evening."
"D: For a beer that creeps up the mid 6% ABV mark, its a very drinkable, clean and satisfying ale. Perfect for pairing with pork and sharp cheese. The cleansing, bready effect of the malt profile used makes for a super-drinkable brew. More French farmhouse ales will be in this guy's future."
"Pours a nice clear orangy amber with an average off-white head. Aroma is malty, yeasty and slightly fruity. Flavor is strongly malty and somewhat fruity, and has a slightly sweet undertone and a hint of hop bitterness. Smooth and rather fizzy texture completes this beer."
"D- nice and easy drinking super refreshing and lots of flavor."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick, and with medium carbonation. This beer isn't great, but I'll take another right now. I'm not in a picky mood tonight."
"I guess it's an interesting stab at the style, but it could've used a lot more of a hop bite and a more interesting malt profile to balance out all the spiciness here."
"D- Overall, Southampton Biere de Mars is a beer that is definitely worth a try. Don't know if I like it enough to purchase again but am glad I tried it."
"Drinkability: Remarkably interesting. Smooth with impressive flavoirs."
"D - Not bad...it's definitely drinkable, but not anywhere near the best of the best in this style. I'm happy to have picked this up and been able to try it, but I think it's a one and done for me. The somewhat ""off"" aromas and tastes kinda turn me off a bit here. Had high expectations for this and was a bit let down."
"D: This was kind of a ""meh"" beer for me. Not bad, just sort of blah. I'd really like to have tried the version of it shown in the picture above."
"Overall Impression: This is a French style Farmhouse ale with some spices added. It is not aggressively spiced, and they do work with this style rather well. It is an interesting, inexpensive brew, so it's definitely work checking out!"
"D- This is a very interesting, refreshing brew. I like it and think its good-but even the very minimal biscuit doughiness it offers is almost a turn-off for me. Overall I think this is a great, drinkable, light, refreshing, spicy biere de garde. I am happy it is now offered in 12 oz bottles and available in my area."
"While being low in alcohol, I don't think I would go for more than one of these in a sitting, Im not digging the dead butter dominating the taste, I thought this would be somewhat interesting but it's one sided as all hell. If some spices came through this might be appealing, but for now it's in limbo."
"D: Very tasty overall. Loved the look; the aroma was fine but didn't excite me; but the taste was a pleasant surprise and this was a well-balanced, very drinkable brew. Definitely one I recommend, though I have limited experience with the style overall."
"D - goes down very easy."
"Overall this was a well done beer for the style however about midway through the drink it became a bit too one-dimensional. Still, it's got no fatal flaws and is worth a shot."
"Overall a nice beer. For me, it's a nice diversion from hoppy beers."
"Part of the Southampton mixed 12 pack. Pours a somewhat dark golden color. Smallish head to it.. very strong aroma, wine like almost. Medium to full bodied... very sweet beer. Good mouthfeel, quite carbonated. Reminds me a lot of champagne tastewise.. even a bite of alcohol in there. Not totally into this style but this one isn't bad... give me an IPA or Amber over this one for sure but definitely drinkable and a good change of pace beer for a unique style."
"D - Nice stuff. Nothing to write home about, but a very decent and refreshing brew."
"a great all around beer that is worth trying for sure. I'll certainly be buying more of this one."
"Nicely drinkable -- a great beer for sitting in the sunshine."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a short dense head that dissipates into a sparse cap. The aroma seems to be strong on the coriander, sweet and floral. A nice sweet malt body that is pushed around by the coriander flavor, some pepper, honey, and a general fruity flavor. Not overly sweet seems to have good balance to the sweetness. The coriander is a bit too present for my liking. A nice moderate body with crisp carbonation, drinks very well. Finishes sweet for the most part with perhaps a slight earthy bitterness. An enjoyable brew but too heavy on the coriander. Most of the other flavors seems to be dominated by the coriander."
"D- Not bad at 6.5% it is deliciosly complex, but not too dangerous."
"D- Easy to drink, refreshing. I think this would pair great with something spicy. Recommended to try."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a massive white head that lingers, not much lacing. The smell is potent: dried orange peel, something savory like the juices of a good steak, whole grain, sourdough, marigolds, mineral tang. The taste is similar, but not so heavy on the citrus; the malty qualities of grain, with sourdough and marigold tang, dominate, with an exceptionally rich malty aftertaste and a surprisingly bitter finish. This is one heck of a complex beer. It's highly carbonated but not fizzy, fills up the mouth very well. It's too interesting to be too drinkable: definitely one to savor slowly."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, light, well-carbonated."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"This Biere de Garde, being one of my first, was a real treat to try on tap at American Flatbread. It was delivered to me an amber/orange color with a one-finger beige cap. The retention of the cap was great, the lacing good. The aroma was of dried apricots, barley, pear and yeast. The flavors were of wheat, lots of biscuity malt, light alcohol, some honey sweetness and pear. The dry and grainy flavors of the malt made the alcohol a little pronounced, but that's good for the style. The bitter finish lingered on my tongue. The mouthfeel was foamy and a little rough, the body medium and the carbonation high enough to be slightly prickly. A really accurate example of the style."
"Pours a clear golden orange color with white head. Aroma is well balance with hints of malt, hops and crisp fruit. Flavor very similar being slightly watered down with a nice amount of maltiness, balancing out the hops and hints of apple and pear."
"Notes from 5/6/05"
"Bottle 106 compliments of BeerWorld. A damn fine trader."
"This was an all-around solid brew. It works perfectly as an easy-drinking yet full-flavored, warm weather-type beer. My only complaint is that the taste could have been a bit more complex and pronounced. Nevertheless, this was a highly enjoyable example of the style."
"Drinkability: Interesting and complex; the funk, fruit and medicinal herb qualities are very impressive"
"Pours a sunset metallic yellow with a fluffy one and a half finger off-white head that sticks around for some time. Nice webbing left on the sides of the glass, what a great looking brew. Smell is new to me. Light cane sugar with lots of spice. Faint oak and a good amount of white grape aromas as well. Very unique in the nose, me likey. Taste starts off with a peppery kick followed by some pine hop and toasted grain. A bit of a caramel malt and honey towards the end, but not much. Light to medium body with a sharp carbonation. I can't say I've had a beer like this before. Even though I live in NY, I may not have the opportunity to try this beer again and I can't thank Matt enough for the opportunity. I see this is available in bottles as well, I would love to get my hands on one to compare to the growler version."
"Overall, A beer I've wanted to try for a while, and I'm glad I did. I was just hoping for more tart or sour flavors. I can think of better examples of the style, but this is a quality example. Its just not head of the class."
"Notes: Awesome beer! Mine's 2008 bottle 163 of 250. Phil Markowski and Southampton come through again."
"Overall a tasty ale, with good complexity."
"D-This is a nice light sessionable brew. I applaud SH for taking this style in another direction...the spicy/fruitiness is really nice."
"D: Good... not quite a saison... interesting feel and the balance of the spices make this a nice treat"
"On tap at Zeno's, State College, PA. Guess the guys were in town and they loaded up 3 beers on tap to enjoy before the Moe. concert right next door later that night. The one brewer (I'm terrible with names, sorry), bought me a pint of this fine beer (Thanks, man!). I could see right away why he was so excited about this beer. Such a beautiful looking, smelling and tasting beer. Belgian complexity about pilsner cleanness paired together in this wonderfully smooth beer. I love this style and don't get to try too many out here in the styx. This one is very good, and I'm leaving work a little early to see if there's still anymore on tap. Southampton beers only made their way out here maybe a year ago, and they continue to impress me. Fine job!"
"Possibly the smoothest beer I've ever sampled, it's almost imperceptible to the tongue it's so smooth. Instantly tart, but cut with a resounding sweetness of honey to balance things out. Granny smith apples spring to mind, as does an oaked Flanders ale. Earthy, basement like taste in the finish coupled with a long drawn out tartness that puckers the mouth, this is a classic."
"Drinkability was very high. SPH simply does not make a mediocre beer. Top notch brew, really enjoyable."
"Another winner, thanks to Nutbrown!"
"Pours out a cloudy golden orange with some sediment floating around. Pretty small white bubbly head that leaves a bit of sticky lacing on the glass. Light funkiness with some earthy notes in the aroma. Some tart fruit undertones with a bit of sweetness lulrks beneath. Fruit sweetness, with a bit of tart green apples start the flavor. A bit of earthy funky and yeast notes. Finishes a bit tart and funky. Bubbly carbonation and smooth going down makes this some easy drinking beer."
"A fascinating brew, and one I'm going to have to revisit when I get a bit more familiar with the style."
" This might be a good introduction to tart beers for someone who isn't acquainted with them. The malt can easily be perceived beneath the tartness. Big thanks to blitheringidiot for bringing this all the way from PA."
"Beer is good. Happy farmhouse beering."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied, and slightly sticky."
"not impressed, won't try this one again."
"Drinkability- I'm liking this one. Different for sure. Kinda like a really laid back saison. I'd have another for sure."
"Drinkability and Notes  This is a tasty beer from an often overlooked style. Southampton has once again delivered a Biere de Garde that, while not as refined, has more flavor complexity than the finest French/Belgian examples available in this country."
"A bit like Maudite and Lunacy? It's that sort of drinking experience which really does not resonate with me."
"Tastes fruity and sweet with a sour edge. Drying. Peppery and spicy. More orange. Cidery. Mouthfeel is kind of gritty and oily, but not terribly offensive. Dry finish. Fairly drinkable- a complex and interesting flavor all around."
"A toned down saison, and that's a good thing. Primarily a sour at palate, intense flavour not for everyone. I liked it but was not expecting this. Citrus in aroma. A wild take on the actual style from the rudimentary few I have had of the style so far."
"750ml bottle. 2005 edition. Dark orange with a nice frothy head of eggshell white. Lacing ensues and is quite abundant in nature. Aromas are all about the cracked white and green pepper, fresh hay-like grass aromas jump out, and are rounded out by some nice sweet German/French maltiness. Taste is spicy and funky up front with some gueuze lambic notes, and some wild yeast/funk notes. The taste is rounded out by some nice German/French bready malts and some green awesome Northern French hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slick, turning dry in the finish, which is spicy (pepper) and everlasting. Drinkability is intense and perfect for this most unique and staggering brew. wow, SPH is really coming back into the front of my mind these days, with brews like this masterpiece!"
"D - This is a very interesting and complex beer that possesses many qualities of a fine apertif, if it weren't for its tongue-numbing qualities. Drinkable in its own right like a glass of wine, however this beer would be best suited when paired with food."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A bit sharp and aggressive in the mouth with resulting big ass burps... almost to a detriment. The beer mellows a little after several minutes, but this intensifies the punchy sourness that now has taken over almost completely. Not an easy beer to get through to the end... next time I will pair this one with food, as I believe there is some balance that needs to be achieved."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp with healthy carbonation. Quite refreshing and easy to drink. This 750ml is a treat and I wouldn't mind having another. A tasty, well made brew that does a good job of not going over the top. Many thanks to dmeadows and goodbyeohio for the bottles. I'm glad I have another in the cellar!"
"Pours a very hazy peachy orange color with a nice active carbonation. The head is sparse over top, but I avoided the agressive pour to keep the wee beasties out of the beer this time. The nose is absolutely divine. It has the funkey barnyardy mustyness, but its not the dominant aroma. I get lemon soaked raisin and a light graineyness. Nothing too big, but working very well as a group. Flavor is very nice as as well. Initial swallow gives a slightly tart, musty feel, but it does not linger much after the initial swallow. I get lemony citrus and light grainey notes, but nothing really The aftertase is just slightly musty, lemoy and even a touch sweet. The feel is light to moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, an incredily drinkable beer. I like the balance of all aspects. This is a style I often find to be a bit offensive, but this one is built very well."
"Pours an orange color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is subtle, but has some sweetness and some citrus - very little funk. The flavor caught me off guard. It's got a tart kick that I wasn't expecting. The tartness dies off quickly leaving a well-blended citrus and sweetness mixture that does good things for the palate. The body is on the low end of medium, but fitting, and the drinkability is very good."
"Overall, an interesting and quite enjoyable beer. I could have this one all night long, even with all the pepper flavors, I don't thik that it is out of balance or anything. Another superb beer from a superb brewery!"
"750ml corked bottle, gold foil. Hazy orange yellow, nice white head. Sour clovey bret-like aroma, some Panil-like acidity. Big explosive sour malty flavors with a peppery sour finish. Distict vinigar like notes. Acidic mouth feel. Very very barrel aged Flemish sour-like. May be tough for non sour fans to stomach."
"Hazy orange color with a small frothy off-white head. Great aroma that has a nice fruity overtone. Slightly spicy, but well balanced with some roasted malts. Smooth mouthfeel but you can definitely taste some alcohol. The fruitiness is still present and you can detect a little orange/citrus. Very tasty brew but I couldn't see myself putting down bottle after bottle of it."
"By far the best thing about this beer was it's incredible smell. A full-bodied aroma with strong strawberry characteristics. Southamton's Biere De Garde, now becoming a popular follow-up to the well accepted US Saisons - prove they take this seriosuly. Pours with a radiant orange hue and clean white head. Subtle and small carbonated bubbles remind us of handcrafted qualities. Sour fruit front followed by clean, dry, earthy finish."
"Auburn in color with a billowy off-white head and even carbonation. Aroma is light, mildly spiced with a grape like sweetness to it. Light and invigorating are the keywords for the flavor as well. Starts off with a bit of lemon/orange crispness -- just a hint tart but not at all puckering. The beer develops a sweeter character in the mid-palate which strengthens as it warms. Finishes with a gentle, floral hop flavor, and just a delicate note of burnt/roasted malts lingers into the aftertaste. Somewhat creamy in mouthfeel from the head and even carbonation, but overall light-bodied and refreshing. Very, very easy to drink a whole bottle of this. Another winner from Southampton."
" Definitely check out this beer."
"Love the big classy bottle as it suits such a refined beer as this. Mid dark gold with a very fruity nose consisting of peaches and apples that are left on the orchard floor. The beer tastes very old but young at the same time. I loved the attention to detail and the fact that it tasted like straight from the farmhouse in France or Belgium. Food friendly yet able to stand alone as a sipper. Thanks to malto for exposing me to this wonderful brewer."
"Great stuff!"
"Carefully poured in an imperial pint glass, formed a 2"" dense eggshell head, with lazy but plentiful bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. A orangey golden brew, with spotty yet heavy foam lace. Nose is spicy pale malts, with a tad of funk making things interesting, and a hoppy crispness. Taste is a slightly sweet maltiness, coupled with a clean hop snap, and closes a bit dry on the tongue. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. Enjoyable brew."
"This was a 750 ml corked bottle shared with 2 friends. The color is an amber/orange blend with a thin head that goes readily to laciness. The beer is spicy with a pale malt aroma. The flavor is a sweet citrus combination of orange, tangerine, and a clean malt flavor. The beer taste rather crisp because of its carbonation. The citrus flavors leave a lingering sweetness on the palate as well."
"A well pronounced grassy and herbal hop profile greets my tastes buds, along with notes of butter and caramel, rhubarb, odd spicing and lemon. Yeast character of another Southampton beer reminds me of Fantome. Funky, complex, dry and very very good."
"Comments  Ill toss out a big, huge thanks to Davo for sending me this gem in the mail after first introducing me to it at the Blind Tiger."
"Didn't suck."
"Cloudy orange bodied with a nicely laced white head sticking to the snifter. Big malty aroma. Baked malt, cookies, bready dough and clove-ish yeast. Candyish donut sprinkles. Somehow hoppy too, though its subtle and definitely not an/some american hop(s). Rather yeasty palate which procures a moderate dryness all the way through. Very surprising taste after smelling, both are very different with a sweet aroma and a dry palate. Youve got to respect a beer that surprises you. Still, I found cloves flavors to be a bit overstated, but I love the gentle mustiness, earthy and cerealic (almost oaty) flavors. Nice balancing ending bitterness. Lively carbonation, fluffy mouthfeel. Much more flavorfull than I anticipated. Great execution (of course). Cheers to biruchan and schoolteacher!"
"This is an exceptionally well-composed replication of a Belgian ale. The taste is comparable to light Belgians such as Duvel, but with a tart wheatiness. A true pleasure."
"Pours a hazy orange-copper color. It is pretty well carbonated, which supports an off-white to tan colored head. I get sweet fruity aromas of pear and apple up front, as I dig deeper I get notes of toasted biscuits and malt, plus some subtle spice notes as well. The beer is fairly dry up front, with an initially gassy middle and a sweet cider like finish. This is another fairly clean, yet interestingly malty interpretation of the style. Almost has a meaty-chewy malt character to it. This is quite tasty and has a hearty medium bodied quality to it that is most likely from this being an all malt interpretation of the style. The fruity yeast notes are nice, though it could perhaps use some more yeast spiciness, but this is a rather weak complaint on this otherwise wonderful beer."
"Drinkability: Wonderful. Great spring beer."
"Once you get past the initial aroma, the volatiles escape, things settle, and a really very decent Bière de Garde shines through. A nice treat and well-worth trying. And man, watch out for that skunkweed ... it's pretty damn intense!"
"The beer extricates itself from the 750ml green bottle an obfuscated copper color, the head Brontosauric in size, creamy in texture and after dissolving the lace forms a thick and clinging blanket upon the glass. The nose has a the aroma of over ripe apples with a nice yeast presence, citrus crisp, also notice a hint of mustiness, a fine sniffer this one, start is lightly sweet, pleasing malt presence with the top light to middling in feel. Finish is ferine in its acidity, the hops dynamic in their spiciness, very dry aftertaste, a very fine representative to the style, quite pleasing to the palate and a great beer to share on Fathers Day with all the fathers past, present and future, also my thanks goes to the Evil One his own self, Master Davo, Great BA, Great person, and best of all a Great Friend!"
"713"
" The body is pretty big, but not huge. The flavor is absolutely wonderful. Dark sweet fruits and balance well with spices. There is a big malt presence, but the spices and herbs really make for an interesting experience. It is very smooth and rich. As the temperature starts to rise, it becomes even more deliteful. This is yet another winner from Southampton."
