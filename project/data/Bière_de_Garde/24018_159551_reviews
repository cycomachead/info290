"There is some residual brandy hanging out with wood and vanilla. Musty, earthy, lightly sour and raisiny. Light bodied and presents some slight warming."

"Grassy, crisp apple, sour cherries."

"Pours a cloudy brownish orange color with off-white head. Funk, tartness, earth tones, and maple notes on the nose; follows onto the palate. I also get some maple/brown sugar sweetness in the middle, with a distinct bready note, undoubtedly from the hay. Finishes tart and dry with Jester King funk."

"Interesting. Classic tartness with slight resiny sourness that lingers on the palate. Very good."

"Draft at JK. Tart, not much hay, nice finish with notes of brandy. Very well balanced sour"

"This is a really outstanding beer.  I think that the hay and the term ""Biere de Garde"" to some might be considered more off-putting than a Beiber concert.  But don't let that fool you friends.  This angel in-disquise is that new-new that is on-par with some of JK's finer offerings.  Like a newlywed admiring his beautiful spouse, I'm interested to see how time will change this masterpiece.  Get some."

"This was a  tough one to characterize.  Unlike some reviews, I get the ""hay"" upfront, in  a very earthy dry sort of way.  Dried grass, shocker.  It doesn't linger, and it's not overpowering.  The barrel comes through in the form of sweetness, cranberry/raspberry.  This beer surprised me, I really enjoyed it. ."

"Overall: Pleasantly surprised, as I often am with these less conventional beers. It reminds me of encendia in flavor profile and such, particularly with that earthy malty finish. Maybe somewhere between Encendia and Ambree b2. Id also like to commend Jester King for consistently being able to brew dark sours, even one like this with balsamic notes, and being able to avoid acetic acid getting involved. They're masters of the craft."
