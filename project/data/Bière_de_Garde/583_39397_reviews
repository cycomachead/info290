"O: My first in this style, I am really liking this beer. Got it in St Louis, drinking it in Rolla, MO, Aug 5th, 2014. Visually impressive with the initial overflow of carbonation, the first American Beer I’ve had that has captured that sometimes found Belgian aspect."

"Bottle: Poured a clear deep orangey color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma of grainy cereal notes with quite a bit of residuals sugars. Taste is also a mess with an overload of residual sugars and some grainy cereal notes with some funny ester. Body is semi-full with medium-to-low carbonation. Incredible mess with a definite lack of attenuation."

"This is a decent biere de garde. Frankly, it seems more like a Belgian ale that has a tart aspect to it. Thankfully that seemed to calm down over time. But it's still there more than I would like. Thicker feel and flavor on this one. A good stab at the style, but I think I have had better. Though most of those would be from across the pond."

"O: This beer doesn't have as much earthiness compared to other beers in the style but is a really nice beer if you like smelling and tasting yeast. No traces of alcohol are present in the taste."

"Pretty decent beer here. Seems to me to be closer to a Belgian pale ale, as the flavor profile puts me in mind of the Belgian style. Not quite a blow me away beer, but a pretty decent one I'm glad I picked up while at the brewpub."
""
"Medium bodied, smooth and easy to drink, with soft carbonation. A nice beer, which I will buy again, if I get the chance."

"O - good beer that I would purchase if it ran into it again, but probably wouldn't seek out. Well done rep of the style (from what in know about the style, which admittedly isn't much). I liked it, nice fall/winter beer with the kind of apple/cinnamon thing it had going on."
"Three finger head with some retention on a hazy amber orange body. Little lacing. Aroma of orange peel, pungent Belgian yeast and light herbal hops. Flavor is just a little watery, especially in the finish. Up front pear and orange for citrus, Belgian yeast, Understated sweetness and breads. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Semi dry finish. This is a very nice representation of the style. It has all the right belgin character with the right body."
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent example of the style. Subtle, malt dominated, earthy, with slight funk."
""
""
"Overall, quite good."
""
"One gets the impression that the brewers of this ale never actually sampled a French farmhouse-style ale...though there is some similarity to a malt (rather than yeast) driven ale brewed by Fantome on an off day. Flavor and aroma are mostly pleasant none the less."
"Pours perfumed mildly spicy, with a soapy headed medium golden body. Very smooth drinker, that went well with a multi-course dinner. The citrus and pleasantly spicy taste was excellent on a hot night. Soft mouthfeel.Solid biere de garde, picked up in Madison about 9 months back."
"Love this style, and love this take on it. Added element to this that make you think of fruit and malt and wooden casks. Worth drinking one of these bombers right to the last drop."
""
"O- A fun beer that makes me sit up and pay attention. This has a lot of complexity and makes me smile to drink. Like any complex beer, its difficult to put this into words. I'l revisit this one and seriously consider trying to brew the style in an attempt to get similar results."
""
""
"I would love to get a few bottles of this and cellar them for a year or two."
"Taste is rich and even has malty. Pretty strong spice and orange and also rather sweet. Heavy body but not lots of carbonation. This has some categories that match a farmhouse ale but is somewhat like a tripel as well. Pretty good but I have had better."
""
"O: Not bad. I find the sweet and slightly sour taste to be quite palatable. As stated earlier, it somewhat resembles apple juice, and c'mon, who doesn't like apple juice."
"Happy Mardi Gras!"
""
"Pretty good beer. Definitely done well for the style."
"O: Very nice for the style. I can see having this from time to time. I would like to try this after it has aged for a while."
""
""
"Overall? I'm having a good time with it. Consider it recommended."

"Bottle shared at the December iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours dark bronze with a small white head. Aromas of bruised apples and old caramel/stale bread. Unfiltered apple juice in the flavor, bready and honeyed, tart fruitiness, medium bitterness. Tastes old."

"Fruity nose with a malty backbone, but not too much fruit on the tonge. Would like more tartness and drying in this one to be honest... An okay attempt at a biere de garde."
"4.5 D: Tasty beer throughout. All flavors complement each other extremely well. Solid."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite offerings from Schlafly. I talked to one of the brewers while at the tap house and he says that the Biere de Garde settles and ages a bit quite nicely. In fact, he recommended it. I’d say this is one of Schlafly’s top 3-4 offerings. A totally responsible representation of the style. The beer is one of those beers that when you want some real suds, you ask for this one. This is one you crave. This is one for the cult followings. I could drink this one every day. I’ll have another please!"
"The aroma was light, hints of grian, light hops and a touch of light peach and pear fruit notes. Subtle would be the ideal word here. There was a very nice flavor here, nothing really huge, just very light and drinkable. Nice touches of light grains and small doses of light fruit, mixing well and with subtle yet adequate carbonation, the whole thing seemed to come together quite well."
"Notes: An almost-lovely beer. The nose and the flavors are beautiful, it's just the mouthfeel is sharp and prickly. So close to being great. (Wish I knew how old this was to say weather it needed more time or less.)"
"Medium mouthfeel that finishes fairly dry. A little too sweet for my tastes to be a regular in the rotation, but would be an excellent dessert beer or after dinner drink."
"Overall this was a solid beer but was a bit on the fruity side for my liking for the style. Still, it’s worth a shot."
"Overall very enjoyable brew!"
"M/D: Perhaps the actual surprise here is the feel. It is thin and carbonated, just fine, but man is it dry. It highlights the strong and tart tendencies of the taste and actually makes the beer seem a whole lot better than it probably is. It isn't the most inviting, but the smack in the face when you do try it makes it a worthwhile experience."
"Very interesting ale. I was expecting more of a dry, refreshing Saison-type beer. This was actually quite rich and malty. I haven't had many Biere De Gardes (Bieres De Garde?), so perhaps this is par for the course. Whatever the case, this is a very good beer and I certainly recommend it."
"O- Super impressed by this beer. I don't have a lot of experience w/ this style, but that doesn't matter- this is a fantastic brew. If you get Schlafly where you live, go pick this one up- it's really worth it!"
"O: Quite nice. I was very impressed with this beer, and look forward to have another in this style. Had there not been other beers I wanted to try the night I had this, I would have gotten another one."
"I haven't had many of them, but this strikes me as a very good example of the style--like a malty, earthy saison. Not one of my favorite styles, though, I'll admit. 750ml is more than enough."
"Compared to 3 Monts this is a step down, but a decent interpretation altogether."
"Begs to be paired with cheese or cured meats, as the bottle says. Paired nicely with Les Frères, a farmhouse cheese from Crave Bros. in Waterloo, WI."
"The sweet-tart-earthy-thick combo was a bit off-putting at first, but later seemed to settle down. The 2nd glass was easier to drink."
"Drinkability- I enjoyed every part of this beer and will be promoting it to other curious drinkers from the iTap house. Now this is my favorite beer from Schlafly! Could enjoy 3-4 more but had to leave the bar because of our blizzard scare throughout St. Louis' news and television station interruptions."
"Drinkability: A super malty and earth beer that gets better as it warms. Very good but not my favorite in the style. A sipper that I may pick up again."
"CHEERS!!"
"Nothing extraordinary here, but I thought this a solid, enjoyable beer."
"22 ounce exquisitely painted bomber with a gigantic yeast cake hanging out at the bottom of the bottle. Poured into my Tank 7 glass. Full and frothy white head. Color is a deep copper, darker than I was expecting. Aroma isn't as strong as I would have hoped, though it is certainly there. Notes of barnyard are the first thing I notice. There's some residual sweetness just under the surface as well. I get some light cereal notes followed by cherry and white grape. This is highly carbonated. The mouthfeel is very bubbly and effervescent, and bubbles go on for days in my glass. The taste starts off tart (almost mouth puckering so) and then leans towards the sour end of the spectrum. Again I think of really tart cherries chased by pear juice. The fruit flavors give way to a brief bit of grainy maltiness. Some alcohol is definitely present in the beer, as it is most likely accented by the esters given off by the yeast during fermentation, and as the beer warms these alcohol notes are accented, which can be good or bad depending on your point of view. This has somewhat of a chewable vitamin finish. The Biere de Garde style is a cousin to the Saison, one of my favorite styles of beer. I've had some very good Saisons, and while this one isn't quite top notch, it's not bad, and the flavor profile is certainly in my wheel house."
"Medium and full mouthfeel, not overly carbonated. It is very drinkable and hides the abv well. A pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability: not a quick drinking beer, but there is some overall refreshment with this. Worthy of giving this one a try."
"Drinks pretty good, but not outstanding for the style. Not amongst the top of the line 750 mL premium crafts tho."
"4 3.5 4.5 4 3.5"
"Sourdough and and old fashoined white bread Grandma used to make. Nice malt and super earthy hop flavor profile. The taste makes me think of a Spring meadow near an orchard."
"Large bottle from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. I can find no freshness or bottling date info. Orange cap FWIW. Pours cloudy darker honey amber, with a dark orange hue. Lifts a large loose medium khaki head, gong to a 1/4 inch film and nice lace all the way up to where the top of the head was. Musty, fruity and malted up nose. Complex and inviting BDG, some spice, some mustiness, a Belgian yeasty note. More flavor notes floating across the tongue need to be mentioned, ripe pears, and light raisins, with earthiness abounding. Yeasty final pour, adds the expected cloudy light brown look and a hint of nuts. Really enjoyed this one."
"I like this beer and would buy it again, Kudos Schlafly."
"Drinkability is excellent. I drank the whole bottle with steak and fried rice and it held up very well. I could drink this till I pass out. Very nice!!"
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a hazy honey brown color with a nice frothy off-white head that slowly settles into a very puffy cap. The aroma has a tart lemony twang along with some belgian or hefe yeast phenol characteristics. The taste takes a 180 from the aroma. The taste is of caramel malt with a rye like spiciness, and brown sugar all resulting in an earthy flavor. There is also some metal and lemony flavors along with some subtle yeast phenols. The flavor is pretty spot on for the style. The beer has a moderate body with airy carbonation, an almost creamy texture; sweet throughout with some sour/tart notes popping through. A good Biere de Garde. It showcases the malt, has a nice earty spice quality and drinks easy. This is a real quality style when made well."
"Beer is medium in body and finishes nicely. Good spice in the middle and overall pretty good. Not sure how good a Bière de Garde this is but its a good beer overall."
"Notes: Pity, this could be an off bottle and/or a lesser offering from Schlafly. I typically like their brews quite a bit with some among my favorites but this one is far from the cut. Supporting the idea of a bad bottle or a badly crafted brew I had an intense last pour. Unapologetically I poured the end including all yeast and sediment. Very hazy final serving with ugly to average presentation but at least the flavor picked up a richness close to what this should be like: timidly fruity, very sweet, spicy with cinnamon and sugar dominating. At least it had some aroma with character... Still no tartness, sour or complex earthy notes at any point."
"Nice screen-printed mag bottle. Bottle conditioned, and the pour was appropriately slightly turbid. Aggressive tight head required a careful pour. Some yeast flavors, with predominant caramel malt body. Slightly vinious finish - not sure if this is the best example of the particular style, but a well-done beer in the general Belgian realm, like those of Unibroue."
"Chewy and malty in the mouth with sweet toffee dominating the flavor. Tastes like a bock with a belgian twist. Too sweet to be very drinkable for me. Overall, pretty good, not really engaging at any point."
"This beer tastes of the earth. It is very clear and a light brown color. The head was fair and lingered for a while. The taste is a little too sour for me. It could use a bit more malt sweetness. It makes me think of a flemish sour or something of a similar style rather than a bier de garde. Overall it's a good beer, but not my favorite of this style."
"D - This is a decent attempt at the style, but it's a bit rough around the edges. It's done to style, but not really outstanding."
"D- This is a very nice drinkable beer. I enjoyed the sourness and funk in this. Nothing too over the top but this beer is great for what it is."
"Overall, I liked it and would love to revisit this one when the temp is closer to 100 than 0..."
"Poured a gentle amber color with some light cloudiness, great head with differing size bubbles and good lacing. Aroma is light with some Belgian hints but primarily of apples. Tastes good very tart and slightly sour with apples being the primary flavor. Mouthfeel is a crisp medium body very slightly oily. Drinkability is good for the style though a little tart for my tastes."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with tiny carbonation bubbles. There was a smoothness to this one. I wont seek it out again, but it was worthwhile."
"Drinkability: It has a good warming feeling without being too warm."
"D- This is incredible. Reading the back of the bottle Schlafly suggests this ages well. The bottle I tried was about a year old from cellaring. I now wish I had more of these cellaring."
"Taste is tart fruitiness with hints of sourness and even a touch of vinegar and barrel staves. Malts are toasted caramel and even could be described as earthy. Hops are there for a bit of balance, but pretty much just along for the ride. This is quite tasty, surprisingly sour (in a good way) and slightly funky. Carbonation is creamy and smooth and adds another layer of complexity to the drinking experience. Different from most farmhouse ales as it has a darker, heavier malt presence. I will look for this one again, for sure! I have been pleased with most of the offerings I have had from Schlafly so far."
"good drinkability. crispy mouthfeel but with good body."
"Pours a very hazy burnt orange color. I mean, I really can't see through it, but I can see bits of yellow around the edges in the light. The head that form is great, nice and white, rises up about an inch, then falls back to a nice ring, leaving bits of lacing around. It looks about right. The smell has quite a bit of tartness, like raw, underripe berry fruitiness. Smells a bit yeasty, maybe a little strong with some fruity alcohol - quite a bit of that fruity fermentation smell thrown out there. I'm not sure how much I really like it. But then again, there isn't just one way a biere de garde should smell. The taste keeps it up with the fruity frementation flavor - the raw yeasty taste. It kind of hides the rest of the beer, as well as the peachy alcohol flavor. As far as everything else, there's a distinct graininess, way more than barley, but it just tastes like raw crushed grain, maybe some oatmeal and/or other cooked grains. I think it has the kind of stuff that you expect, but I think I'm wishing that it was just lighter all-around - it hides some of the things I was looking for. As far as the mouthfeel goes, the beer is a little too heavy, and the carbonation is a little too sharp. Overall, this kind of reminds me of a first attempt at something that a homebrewer tried. I've tasted something surprisingly similar made by a friend. A few of my beers have had this taste. I think it needs work, maybe it should be lightened up, aged a little more, so that the flavors that the yeast should impart can come to the front. The ABV on this seems a little higher and harder than I want too, so it's harder to drink than I'd want as well. I'd be interested to try this again with some improvements. I want to see what kind of yeast character this has."
"Pours a cloudy, orange/amber color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, citrus, yeast, hops, and slight alcohol. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, citrus (banana), tart malt, yeast, hops, and alcohol. Overall, a great body, blend, complexity, and aroma. Not quite as good as the cask version, but still a very good beer especially for only around seven dollars."
"I'm not huge on Schlafly as far as their 'everyday' offerings go, but I am loving their seasonal and one-off releases. Way to step it up, Schlafly!"
"Very good brew. Only my second biere de garde (after Weyebacher Foxtrot) & I've enjoyed both. Might seek out others if I get the chance."
"There aren't a lot of Biere de Gardes out there and it's hard to find good ones from those that are available. It's nice to see there's a quality Biere de Garde brewed as close as St. Louis. Thanks again for the bottle, Vance!"
"D: I can sip on this beer all day, every day. I drank the whole 750mL bottle and still wanted more. A great farmy style that I will actively seek out now."
"Taste is of candied sugar up front along with some spice. There is a faint funkiness in the background and towards the finish along with some refreshing tart fruit and peaches. Mouthfeel is very smooth and on the heavier side of medium bodied. A wonderful stab at the style from Schlafly."
"Tried a bottle purchased in August 2010 in August 2012. Note that despite the bottle recommending aging it, this one is much better fresh than old."
"I got this 750 ml bottle via a trade with Erik in Indiana. It poured a hazy orange to brown with very little head. Nose of oranges, clove, and some grassy hops. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is fairly complex with ripe fruits dominating. Lightly bitter finish. Most enjoyable."
"Very tasty brew, ""light"" on the alcohol as this brew weighs in with 7% - and no appearance of it in the sampling. Another Schlafly goodie."
"Tastes like sweet pumpkin pie filling mixed with green apples, sour apricots, and yeasty OJ. Fizzy, ebulliant mouthfeel like my tongue was going to go numb...but didn't."
"D: This is an extremely enjoyable beer. Thank you Matt for setting me up with this great beer!"
"Drink pretty easy for the style & abv, a very good stab at the style, that I will try again in cooler weather to see if it is better or worse, This got a bit thick & boozey as the bottle drained"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: A little creamy and slick this is a very good beer. Has a champagin feel to it. It is my first of the style though and now I will be looking for others for sure."
"Pours a very nice cloudy dark golden orange/yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy one-finger plus off-white head, with lots of nice thick/creamy sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with a good dose of yeast, with some spices. The taste is malty, yeasty, spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, this is another nice one from Schlafly."
"Drinkability: Well, that's fairly nice; a real, honest thirst quencher. Deep down, we're all striving for a great Bière de Garde. Schlafly's offering comes pretty close."
"It is a bottle conditioned French farmhouse ale. I like everything about this beer - the smell, the appearance, the taste. It is slightly sweet yet still earthy. I always stock up on it when it is available. A quick checks shows I have eight 750 ml bottles on hand. Which is fine since this one gets better with age (though it rarely has a chance to so). I love the citrus taste and every time we pair it with food, not matter what type of food, it is always a good compliment."
"750 ml bottle (2007 bottle, orange crown and 7.0% ABV). Served in a Gulden Draak tulip glass, the beer pours an amber/orange color with a 2 inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. (The first glass poured clear, the second was cloudy from the yeast that settled on the bottom of the bottle.) It smells like yeast, Belgian candy sugar, slightly tart orange, peppery spice and a bit of funk. Taste is similar to the aroma, I can taste pepper, earthy malt, yeast, citrus and some funk. It also has a spicy, dry finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with zippy carbonation that goes down and smooths as the beer warms up. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and quite refreshing. I think this is a good overall brew, it's a good example of why Schlafly is becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Overall, a solid but not spectacular beer. Easy drinking and goes down smooth but just not enough flavor to it to make it stand out. Do recommend. For me, one and done unless I could try on tap."
"Refreshing and well balanced."
"Overall Impression - Much to my surprise this little St. Louis brewery made a pretty good farmhouse style beer. Who would have thought? I drink many Belgian beers, but I'm not as familiar with Bier De Garde and farmhouse style. To my taste this is a really nice beer. I looked up the BJCP 2008 style guide for Bier De Garde, and I don't find anything out of place or missing. It's a solid beer. I could easily put down several of these."
"Bottom line: This is my 6th encounter with Biere de Gardes and, judging from my reviews, I guess I favour the style. Actually, I'm not guessing at all. I love 'em."
"Schlafly Biere De Garde is the real deal and is one of the best versions in recent memory that didn't hail from either Belgium or France. If you're sitting on an orange crowned bottle (2007), it's drinking mighty fine right now."
"Drinkability - I'll try more of the style as I see it, but more for posterity's/education sake."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" off-white head over the clear bright copper brew. Head lasts and lasts, constantly replenished by the streams of tiny bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Lacing is sporadic but chunky when present. Aroma is clean and citrusy, with a light earthiness. Taste begins lightly sweet, quickly turns to the lemony citrus, which carries through but recedes somewhat at the close to let the sedate mustiness peek through. Mouthfeel is small-bubbled and smooth, and drinkability is nice. Crisp thirst-quencher here, with alcohol warmth that sneaks up over time."
"Drinkability is moderate. Great flavors and moderate alcohol make this easy to consume. A nice brew for sure."
"A very good beer, with good drinkability!"
"Schlafly seems to pull of these complex Belgian styles effortlessly. This beer pours with bright rust color, moderate haze, and fantastic off-white head formation, retention and lacing-- an overall impressive look. Aromas are part-malt / part fruits with an emphasis on toasty, bready notes. Bruised oranges, lemon rinds, apples, and appricots round out the estery aromas. Mild plastic and peppery phenols also add to the complexity. Woodsy and musty late. Flavors of malt and fruity esters continue their balance. A light toasty flavor is accentuated by herbal hops, and light acidic flavors. Remaining spicy and citrusy til the end. Body is quite full for the style, but lifted off the palate by an airy carbonation. A well attenuated character helps to keep the beer palatable, but it still has a weight that seems high. Finishes with a hit of appricots, lightly grassy-citrus notes and a musty cellar-like quality."
"Taste opens dry, herbal, and slightly minty. Not a lot of funkiness. Caramel sweetness offers a solid malt backbone. Nicely balanced. Very nice, but nothing here reaches out and says this is a topnotch biere de garde. Perhaps, with some age this one might really impress. Still, quite nicely done and one I would be happy to revisit soon."
"Hard pour into a Duvel gives a somewhat cloudy orange / amber hue. Vey nice foamy head that crests the glass. Nice looking beer, and I can tell that this is going to be a creamy treat. It is. Mouthfeel is smooth and very lightly carbonated. Tastes great too. Mild yeasty funk, not quite sour - never really goes into that territory. Smells are grassy with some green apples - quite mild though. Very drinkable - ABV is on the nose. I like this one a lot. Another homerun for this brewery along with their great Saison. Will buy again for sure."
"M/D: Very refreshing. Light, about right carbonation. I am going to try aging one, really can't wait for the results. THe ""fresh"" one on tap was damned decent."
"This beer pours dark amber, almost orange, with a thick, full head that dissipates relatively quickly leaving a thin layer of foam on top of the beer. It has a hint of citrus on the nose, with a bit of yeasty sweetness. It has a sharp bite in the front of the mouth. I also noticed the yeast flavors coming out as well. It has a bit of hop bitterness that nicely balances the sweetness."
"p(price) 7 bucks for a 750 ml. a little steep for me."
"D - This is a very nice Biere de Garde. I was quite impressed with it. I'd like to try one that has aged a little more."
"Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. The carbonation is very crisp. The bottle info says that this can be aged well. I'll have to give it a shot."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium in body with lower levels of carbonation this brew feels pretty good in the mouth, its pretty smooth. Alcohol warms the mouth once the beer has been swallowed. This is a beer I'd not be opposed to drinking again, however, I would really like to sample some others before I come back to it."
"I really enjoyed this beer from Schlafly. It was my first Biere de Garde, but definitely not my last. I'm going to pick up a few more of these and trying aging one for a while if I can resist drinking it."
"Very refreshing."
