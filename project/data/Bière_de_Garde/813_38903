Smell is yeasty with a bit of spice, apple and candied fruits, crisp grainy malts with just a bit of lemony hop, finished with more spice and some earthy points. Taste goes south a bit here, some of that candied fruit from the nose, light bitterness but moderatley sweet all the way through, hard candy flavours with a odd smoke like flavour toward the finish here. Medium carbonation and medium body, pretty nice feel. Not a bad beer, but I am begining to suspect that I'm not a huge fan of this style though, still fairly drinkable and would drink it again if someone handed me a glass but otherwise I'm not going looking for it.","peensteen","Apr 24, 2013"

The flavors were quite similar and enjoyable with a well balanced malt profile, an alcohol punch in the middle, and a clean finish. The caramel malt really came off clearly and was well met by the fruit notes and citrusy hops. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation good.

3.99,7.5,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"From the 750 ml. bottle marked 12.28.09-L27.1.11. Sampled on March 27, 2010. Served about 45 degrees. As I popped the plastic cork often found on these French beers it really opened with exhileration and a nice puff of carbonated mist. The aroma was noticeable right out of the bottle before pouring. The pour was a cloudy orange-pale yellow with an eager, foamy white head that fizzles down after a few moments but leaves a thin lacing all around the glass. The aroma bursts with sensations of wheat, malts, coriander, and other tantalizing spices. The flavor has a bitter tanginess with a dry finale of hops and spices. While the aroma had a non-distinct alcohol scent the taste had a bit more alcohol in the mix. Drinkable? If by drinkable you mean it is easy to drink quickly...then I would have to say yes. It was easier to drink this one than savor it. The 8% ABV hit me lightly at the end. It had its own variety of characteristics which were commendable on the face of it but I still tend to favor Belgian Abbey Ales, at least over this one from France. Still, it was not a bad beer overall. I found it in the Price Chopper Grocery Store in Keene, N.H. It was kind of a stand-alone among the typical nationally known macro and micro brews you see in grocery stores or other bottle shops.","puboflyons","Mar 01, 2010"

The brew has a fruity nose; some oxidized grapes, sweetened granny smith apple skins, and hay. There is quite a candied aroma to it. The taste is of a weak caramel and apple juice. There is barely enough caramel malt to carry the Biere de Garde classification. The feel is quite light and has soft carbonation which leads to a flat feel. An average Biere de Garde at best; not nearly malty enough. It is a bit tin-like but holds it own. A very blah biere de garde.

Large white head pillows upon pouring and slowly moves on. Beer is golden in color. The aroma is quite funky with a bit of banana like fruity, clove-like smell beyond that funky Belgian wild yeast. 8.5% ABV is well hidden in this one, maybe because the bottle has mellowed as its gone past best buy date? Pleasant beer to drink, assuming you can get used to the funky nose.

A year or two from now it should be drier, more effervescent, and very earthy - yumm! I think I'll get a couple of bottles to forget in the back of the fridge and see how they are next year.","bubrewer","Nov 06, 2008"
3.23,-12.9,3.5,3,3.5,2,3.5,"The aroma is yeasty and sweet with malt and spice. The appearance is golden with a better than average head and nice lacing left on the glass. The flavor is like the aroma and fairly well balanced with some emphasis on the sweet. The palate is thin. Overall it's nice with a slightly fruity finish.","nick76","Nov 06, 2008"
4.12,11.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D= My first beer of this style and I have to say I was impressed. This could be a really great warm weather alternative to heavier bodied Belgian ales or to pair with food. I could certainly see myself having more of this around the house! Highly recommended!","spointon","Oct 10, 2008"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A very drinkable, solid beer for this style, that quite honestly took me by surprise. This was brewed in France?","scottoale","Oct 03, 2008"
3.98,7.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D = Good drinkability, a very approachable beer. I could happily drink this sitting outside enjoying the afternoon in a French cafe.","Traquairlover","Sep 28, 2008"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A great beer, and quite possibly the best French beer I have had to date.","tpd975","Sep 26, 2008"
3.7,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"M: A rich, medium body. Smooth carbonation and feel... Goes down nicely. Not really anything huge going on, but a 'safe' and inoffensive.","Proteus93","Sep 23, 2008"
4.13,11.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,5,"This is really excellent beer, and I would say the same about the other two beers I've had from Les Brasseurs de Gayant. I think this is kind of a benchmark for beers internationally. I wish this was supermarket beer.","notafood","Sep 19, 2008"
3.83,3.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability: A decent, even borderline good beer. Alcohol's a little high, though not for the style. All in all it's an attractive, pleasant smelling, nice feeling beer, but just not interesting enough to send me back for more, I don't believe. Still, worth trying at least once.","CrellMoset","Sep 15, 2008"
4.11,10.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"I was quite impressed with this stuff. Very glad I decided to pick it up, very disappointed it was the last one on the shelf.","roadhouse","Sep 03, 2008"
3.49,-5.9,5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"It reminds me a lot of some of the more vibrant Belgian strong pale ales. If that is your bag (it really isn't mine), I'd check it out.","shbobdb","Aug 16, 2008"
3.68,-0.8,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Mouthfeel is light and very dry. The carbonation gives a creamy texture. An interesting selection indeed.","bort11","Aug 13, 2008"
4.2,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D - Damn. For the type of beer, I was expecting something closer to a saison or even tripel, but this is superb. It actually has enough malt character to balance out the interesting but often overwhelming phenolic characteristics. I won't have much of a problem downing the whole bottle this evening.","PatrickJR","Jul 02, 2008"
3.38,-8.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"T/M/D - taste is smooth and slighty malty sweet, again reminiscent of a triple (with less of that candy sugar sweetness, and less complexity). It has a slightly crisp aftertaste too. An interesting beer that I'll try again.","Jerico","Jul 02, 2008"

3.95,6.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Although not what I would think of as a hot weather beer, it will be great with any traditional summer foods you are serving, especially a good homemade brat.","beerbrains","May 15, 2008"
4.07,9.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"An OK beer but it is just that OK, not outstanding. Nothing bad about it but it just doesn't make you say WOW.","Zorro","May 08, 2008"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a clear yellow gold color and formed a nice foamy white head that coated the glass with lace as it quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, spices, yeast and a slight barnyard background. The flavor was of malt, yeast, and spices that I can't really separate. The body is medium light and slightly creamy. The finish is slightly tart. Not a bad beer.","Wildman","Apr 24, 2008"
3.77,1.6,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"**this artisanal brew from France have just hit New Jersey store shelves at a very reasonable 4.99/ 750ml. Its definitely worth a shot.","ATPete","Beers"
4.03,8.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Large bottle, with swing top, best before dating on the front label. Pours clear lightish amber, bubbles continuing to rise to the top, under a long lasting fine and tiny bubble white head, that leaves plenty of sticky, classy looking sheeting and lace. Spice, a hint of soap and yeast in the nose. Belgian style yeast and spicing in full flame here, nice take on the style, crisp, flavorful and lively brew. Puckering hop crunch late. Bring on the cheese and salads and enjoy with this one. I liked it, nice to see French brewers getting in on the up scale beer thing.","Billolick","0"

3.8,2.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"bittersweet combo. Lacey, with abundant white head on orange body. Yeasty aroma. Smooth drinking with spice mix. Medium bodied and drinkable. Smokeless Joes. Dry finish. Not best biere de garde, and quite yeasty. Above average beer. Grows on you and you could take a lot if you had to.","Sammy","0"
