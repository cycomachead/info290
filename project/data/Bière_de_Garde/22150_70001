Anyone who enjoys the style might as well try this but those only curious about the exotic ingredients, just save your money.","biegaman","Jan 05, 2015"

A very interesting beer though and it is well proportioned to give you a good display of some  complex flavours and remain balanced. I think some small alterations would fix some of the balance critiques. Very nice.","mick303","Jan 05, 2015"

3.96,3.4,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style while still being fairly unique and I thought that made this beer memorable.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, slightly refreshing, a little dry on finish, not filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention,  I think two or three of these would be my limit, it's pretty easy drinking and I think it makes for a nice Fall time beer.  What I like the most about this beer was the taste, aroma and drinkability, they were all good and worked well with this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the head retention, but in the end it wasn't that big of a deal.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the style.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it was just a nice Biere De Garde and I enjoyed drinking it.  It isn't my favorite of the style, but it was one of the better ones I'e had and it's one of the better beers I've had from Stillwater.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer that was a little unique, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Nov 02, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, honey, rye bread, herbal, floral, grass, clove, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, bready malt, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, honey, rye bread, herbal, floral, grass, clove, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, bready malt, and spice flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Biere de Garde style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, bready malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 19, 2014"

Aroma of light fruit, floral elements light spicing and a suggestion of sweet caramel malt. Flavor of light fruit with peppery bitterness from the heather, develops nice floral notes in the middle to finish somewhat dry with a touch of rye sourness. A very pleasant flavor progression. Complex variety of flavors, but none dominate, allowing something interesting to develop over the taste. Although light to medium in body, it manages a bit of creaminess in the mouth feel.

Aromas of sweet honey and a blend of spicing, including a clove presence. Flavors are light, with an effervescent feel on the tongue. Subtle sweetness in the backbone carries the dynamic spice profile of nutmeg, clove, heather, and oregano on a smooth body. The aftertaste is a muted version of the flavors, doing a good job of carrying the major profiles over into the end of the palate. Quick, clean finish, with a touch of citrus sweet at the very end.

Not all that pungent, or good for that matter. Taste is not any better. The main taste here is artificial fruit, almost cereal like. Whatever yeasy in here is not a good look. Some small toasted bready malt in the middle rounding out to some grain in the end. Hops are not in the picture, or registering with me.

4.23,10.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4," This Saison has a lot of yeast driving the flavor, the presence is full on with mild wheat flavors which come off as lightly bready and fresh toasted with slight pear and light funkiness giving an earthy flavor from the yeast. The hops give a light herbal accent bringing out some complexity in the spice additions and the mild bitterness helps to lighten the taste a bit. The toasted wheat presence is high, perhaps there is some oat in the malt too since it is so silky smooth with creamy yeast element in the finish. Overall I found this to be a very high quality and quaffable saison, the spice notes are not out of place and the collaboration is nothing short of excellent which you would expect from two American brewers who know their way around the Belgian styles. A great example of what can happen when inspiration ignites between a couple brewers. Very nice take on the style.","Slatetank","Aug 05, 2011"
