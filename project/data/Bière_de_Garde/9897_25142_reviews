"This I by far my favorite Jolly Pumpkin brew. Everything about it is so well rounded, no flavor is overpowering yet everything is well portrayed and pronounced. Sour level is moderate to high with a balanced mouth feel. Strong cider flavors from yeast."

"Nice and sour but reminded me of a Flanders red."

"O - A nice tart beer with lots of interesting flavors going on. Very smooth and easy drinking."

"Very reminiscent of a kriek. Lots of sourness with a cherry touch. Rich body and lower carbonation."
""
""
""
""

"Tart cherry is the major note, bitter wash but not overwhelming, thin mouthfeel and the sourness doesnt linger."

"O: I might be still a little fuzzy on what this style should be, but this beer is really tasty. Tart and funky without being overwhelming on either front. Very enjoyable and easy to drink."

"Big bottle from Tipples. Batch 281/283, bottle 2/20/14. Poured 10/20/14. Pours beautifully clear amber color with a super creamy two finger off white head. Aroma is mostly bready malts with some light grass and a bit of toffee sweetness, and just a hint of barnyard funk. Flavor is on the sweeter side, lots of fruits--apples, cherry, pears--some very sweet caramel malts, a hint of spices, and some funky yeast character. Lightly sour with some lightly dry oak character. Medium plus bodied, and could use a bit more carbonation to lighten things up. Overall, a nice beer for the fall, but wondering if I should have popped it when it was fresher, as it comes in a bit on the sweet side without much hay/hop/funky yeast notes that I was hoping for here."

"O:  I'm not a huge fan of the style but knowing how Jolly Pumpkin does beers gave me the courage to grab a bottle.  I'm glad I did as this one is very good."
"Clear copper red pour with a small white head. Light sour, white grape and woody aroma. Very light body with a sour cherry and mild red apple taste upfront. Also has flavors of orange, white grapes, mild caramel malt, and yeast. Finishes with a strong and wet sour flavor."

"O-I had a hard time getting into this beer. There is just so much going on that I am not sure it all fits together. Between the tartness (that is typical of Jolly Pumpkin), the strange malt flavors, and the lighter flavors of apple and pear, it feels and tastes a bit odd to me. Oh well, I can see the appeal, but this beer is not for me."

"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of a Sour, and it's a little unique for a Jolly Pumpkin beer simply because the funky yeast and oak barrel were a little subdued while the sourness and fruit flavors were in the forefront and I can't say that about many Jolly Pumpkin beers, it may just be the sourest beer I've had from them. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, slightly refreshing, not too acidic, a little dry on the finish, just crisp enough, not filling at all and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, a full bottle might be a little too much for me, but with how great it tastes I think I would give it a shot, so I would say one bottle is the perfect amount for me. What I like the most about this beer was how well the sour fruity flavors were showcased it reminded me of some of the better sours I've had. What I like the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad and I really liked the color, but the head and retention were a little disappointing. I would for sure buy this beer again, it's a little pricey, but I think it's worth and I would like to see how this beer changes with time. I would recommend this to anyone who likes sours, I think it's a must try, especially if your a Jolly Pumpkin fan. All in all I was very happy with this beer and I was also a little impressed with it, it was a little unique for a Jolly Pumpkin and in the end it made for one tasty beer especially for the warmer weather like the label suggests. This might just be my new favorite Jolly Pumpkin beers I've had and it's for sure the sourest one I've had from them and I think it's one of the better sours I've had and I think the complexity helped out with that. Great job guys, I'm really happy I tried this beer and it turned out to be an instant favorite, keep up the great work."

"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with amber edges; two fingers thick fluffy off-white head, spray of chunky lace on the glass. Smell: red grape skin, acetic note and hay above caramel; lightly fruity and sweet. Taste: tart peach, grape skin, unripe plum... tart and semi-sweet fruit is the main event; mild toasted grain flavor, herbal and oaky in the finish. Medium bodied with creamy but lighter carbonation. Tart, fruity, slightly herbal finish. Liked Oro better, but this is nice."
""

"There's a juiciness to the sour aspect that translates into and drives the mouthfeel. It runs dry underneath that for a semi-dry feel overall. It's crisp with a tangy bite to it as well."

"jolly pumpkin can do no wrong for me. this bier de garde type is a little more straight forward for me than some of their other stuff, but thats okay, its really expertly made and really yummy. a copper colored beer with a radiant luster, small white fizz head, and a remarkable clarity for a wild ale. i smell the classic jolly pumpkin brett and bacterial culture, and a ton of oak, giving it a funky sweetness that goes well with its robust grain profile. the flavor is a little sweeter than i need it to be, a mix of grain and oak contributing to that, a very toffee-like complexion to it, almost english in nature really, but then the bugs kick in. the beer takes a hard turn towards sour, with the acidity really developing later in the sip. dry now for how sweet it began, and mellowed by a ton of wood, really earthy and fresh. i could stand a bit more carbonation in this one to make the flavors pop a little more, they all seem to melt together just a little bit and lose their individuality, which bubbles would aid in i think, but i like the medium body and all the oak on this. clever beer, definitely up to the high standards they have set throughout their lineup."

"An interesting brew with hints of oak, cherries, tart qualities and Brett funk. In general another one of a good tart and funky brew from Jolly Pumpkin."
""
""
""
"Overall, it comes across muted a bit, but it's very easy drinking and solidly enjoyable. Still always a style I sometimes don't get to wrap my head around much."
""

"Wonderful. Somewhat fruity but also tart and just a tad sour so the sweetness is not in your face. A little funky too, as other reviewers have noted. Smell is also fruity and a little funky. Lots of interesting flavors going on with this beer--and it's not quite like anything else I've had recently. Will be on the lookout for this one in the future."

"Poured a nice cloudy amber with little bits of yeast floating in it and no head. It looks wonderfully rustic and wild, very nice. Scents of sour brett yeast, a slight sweet maltiness and a hint of cinnamon. Not the most intense aroma, but it is nicely subdued and pleasant. Flavor begins with a strong hit of sour brett yeast, quite apple cider vinegar-like, with some lemon notes. The sour flavors override the malty base and make this quite dry upfront. This opens into further sour flavors in the middle, with the addition of an excellent oak undertone that includes hints of oak and vanilla on the palette. Finish is dry and sour with hints of oak. Aftertaste is sour and oak. A very good flavor profile, though not as malty or toasty as a biere de garde normally is, still quite nice. Mouthfeel medium-light bodied with light carbonation and a drying feel. Very nice and easy to drink. Overall this is an excellent sour with a nice bit of underlying complexity in the aroma and flavor. At first glance it seems to be simply sour but as you drink the character of the beer unfolds and becomes nicely complex and very well executed."

"It's a very complex brew with a gentle friendly tartness with great fruit/dark frui character. It's a very drinkable beer but I would never dare to chug as it is des served to be sipped and savored. Great brew and reminds me why Ron Jefferies is the Man!"

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is softly foamy, smooth and not coarse or harsh, the acidity providing the major movement factor for this beer. Closes semi-dry, with low stickiness on the palate and lips."

"What a wonderfully delicious treat, and one of my favorite ""non grand reserve and/or super limited release"" beers from Jolly Pumpkin. Very drinkable with a nice tartness that I'd place somewhere halfway between La Roja and the Biere de Mars Grand Reserve. Such a heavy oak presence on the palate, but it works to strangely well. I will be hard on the look out for more of this one, and will be damn sure to buy as many bottles as I can find each time it comes out."

"O: Another great beer from JP. Very solid and consistent across the grading metrics. I strongly recommend this ale if you like Jolly Pumpkin ales and/or sours in general. I love JP beers and Biere de Mars is 2nd to my favorite: La Roja. Perfect for a rustic meal or a cold day. As the beer opens, this ale could easily be confused with a dry kriek. This is in no way a sweet beer but has a very slight sweetness from the fruit notes, likely contributed to the barrel-ageing process."

"O: Another awesome sour from JP. Clean, dry, and balanced. Well done."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma. Things were just so funky, creamy, musky, bright, soured, and grassy, all while sitting in the nice malty base of a country ale. The flavoring followed nicely, as did the sip, but the big boldness of the nose was lacking. All the components were there, but they were just not as robust as we were hoping through the flavoring, or as creamy as we would have liked on the sip. Regardless, as a whole this is a fantastic take on the style, and a great showcasing of the tricks, punch, and excitement that Jolly Pumpkin has up their sleeves."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; Blend 1, bottled 3/1/2011. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger foamy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart cherry, sour apple, raisin, caramel, clove, pepper, toast, oak, hay, leather, red wine, grass, funk, vinegar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Incredible aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast notes with moderate malt balance and barrel character. Taste of tart cherry, sour apple, raisin, caramel, pepper, clove, toast, oak, hay, leather, red wine, grass, vinegar, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Moderate fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart fruits, caramel, clove, pepper, toast, hay, grass, oak, leather, red wine, vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy esters with moderate barrel character and malt balance; with a great tartness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, slick, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible wild Biere de Garde style! All around great complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on with moderate acidity. An extremely enjoyable offering."

"Biere de Mars pours a lighter bodied dark amber in color with a one finger, very soapy off white head. The nose is sharp and vinous. I get a good amount of lactic acidity and a red grape, tannic side as well. The flavors too, very sharp and crisp. I get a lot of sour red grape character in both a lactic and acetic manner. It also has a slight, juicy, fruity sweetness to it as well. This is definitely one of the more sour Jolly Pumpkins and definitely one of the most acidic. Because of this it isn't quite as approachable as some of their other, highly rated beers but it is a nice beer and a decent sour. Really, I would call this a darker version of Petrus if I had to relate it to anything."
""
""
""
"They should have called this one a Bam too. Because the whole thing is just, bam, oak all up in your mouth. Which is okay, but there is no grace or style to it. It's somewhat one dimensional and I'd have to say too strong. Decent, but lacks finesse."
""

"Overall this was a very good beer. I thoroughly enjoyed the funkiness and the sharp finish that this beer brought. Jolly Pumpkin keeps on impressing me."

"IMO, this is near as good as it gets. Awesome sour from JP, keep em' comin, only now to Colorado. This brew sets the benchmark for all other sours."

"the only thing that sucked? i had it in the fridge for 30 min. not long enough. i forgot that JP beers are gushers. hot damn."

"Overall: It's $12.00. It's really tasty. Do I love it? Not quite. But I would definitely pick one of these up every year if it was available. Solid B"

"Overall: Jolly Pumpkin makes quite a few solid sours, and this falls in the upper tier of their beers. Only the Biere de Mars Grand Reserve can really compete in my mind."

"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Rating: 94 out of 100"
"Pretty decent overall."
"Beer is medium in body and sour on the palate. The lactic acid wins out here for sure. There is a mild acetic bite the whole thing as well. The finish is a little dry. Overall a good beer. Very drinkable. Very nice. I'd have it again."
"Pours a muddy brown color with a bit of a copper-crimson hue to it. Thin off-white head and some light lacing on the way down. Thin collar. Nose carries a good dose of lactic acid with a touch of acetic character in the background. Mild funk and a solid base of bread-crust malt. Flavor is acidic and a nice tartness and a very light cherry character. Light malt. Light to medium body with moderate carbonation and a good sour kick in the finish. Well done."
"The beer is orange to brown in color, with an off white head. Random, spotty lacing on the tulip. Awesome aroma, with a strong Brettanomyces presence. Funky, wild, and wonderful. The flavor is outstanding. Easy to drink and quite enjoyable. Medium to thin in body, with adequate carbonation. I am thoroughly enjoying this. Perhaps not as bold or daring as the Grand Reserve, but highly quaffable. I definitely recommend it and would have it again."
"Overall- Great beer. I will probably try to snag another bottle or 2, or 5, because I feel this beer will age gracefully and become even more dynamic. Jolly Pumpkin is quickly becoming one of my top 3 breweries."
"Tart, dry and bold toasty malts make for a unique flavor experience. Funkalicious oak and bold toffee. As it warms some nice fruit undertones come out, not quite as bold as raisins, more currant-like. Quite impressive, much more than merely enjoyable. JP employs a deft hand at farmhouse funk with the majority of their beers. With so many turning out delicious, I am ruling out luck as a factor why this is so damn tasty. Next to La Roja, this might be my one of my favorite offerings. Superb!"
"Batch 346/348. One of the best regular Jolly Pumpkin offerings in my opinion.The beer pours a light brown color with a substantial white head. The smell is slightly sour with a little bit of funk thrown in to the mix. The taste is similar with a slightly sour start to the sip finished off by a little funkiness that isn't to over the top. You can also pick out a little oak in the finish. Rather light on the pallet which is nice during the summer in Florida. Overall a winner that I would return to regularly if were a little less expensive."
"Batch 346/348. Poured into Lost Abbey stemware. Pours a dark brown color that is a beautiful reddish-purple when held up to light. It had a large off-white head that hangs around for a very long time. Beautiful head on this beer. Scent was extremely funky from the second I popped the cap. Gotta love that JP signature funk. I also get a lot of oak and wood aromas with some sweet fruits and hints of vanilla. Taste is....DAMN I LOVE JP MORE and MORE with each of their beers I try. Initially I get tart cherry flavors, immediately followed by Belgian yeast, barnyard funk, and TONS of oak. The sweet fruity flavors in the beginning are amazing and somewhat vinous. Then all the oak and vanilla comes in and just blows my palate away. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and creamy. Drinkability is very high with no detectible alcohol flavors. Overall, this is ANOTHER amazing beer from Jolly Pumpkin...These guys are becoming one of my favorite breweries by far."
"O - Overall a pretty good beer. I recommend trying it if you get the chance. Not sure I'd buy it again however."
"Great aroma, good flavor, weak palate, weak appearance. Good but not great overall."
"Full chewy body with a slightly creamy texture as well as some soft carbonation up front and a good bit of dry funk. Slightly tart wihout being acidic. Nice dry Bret presence along with a wrong barrel charater and malt backbone. Hints of earhy oak, dry Bret and other bugs,vanilla and citrus peel. Dry finish. Complex, refreshing and very easy to drink. One of my favorite beers feom JP."
"Taste - Echoes the aroma. Softly sour with a nice oak presence and a clean, lingering finish."
"2011 Overall- I prefer fresh to vintage. This is by far superior in taste and in the nose. It offers so much fruitiness, spicyness and depth. I love this biere!"
"O - Overall, quite good. I'm going to the release of the grand reserve next week, and am quite excited, given how tasty the base beer is."
"750 mL bottle poured into a large snifter. This is a clear translucent brown color, extremely well carbonated with a champagne-like fizziness. Smell is sour and funky with lots of lemon, barnyard, and blue cheese-ish qualities. Taste is a sour, pungent lemon.. very acidic and very drinkable. This is delicious. Jolly Pumpkin is a great brewery for sour beers."
"Cheer, Joe"
"Pours a copper-red colour with thick white head. Head dissipates fairly quickly without too much lacing. Smells tart, with some oak and lots of yeasty aroma. Flavour has a very mild sourness, but there is a very big malty flavour to this beer as well. Aftertaste seems to be mostly sour, with my mouth puckering somewhat. Fairly big carbonation level. Another nice beer from this brewery."
"D: An enjoyable glass, I wouldn't mind returning to this one again in the future when I'm feeling something sour."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - As stated, slightly more sour than sweet. A very awesome tasting and well balanced beer. Slightly more the red ale and darker tasting side of J.P. beers. This reminds me even further of why Jolly Pumpkin is one of my favorite breweries."
"This is the first beer I have had in the style. Tastes almost wine like. The tartness is so interesting to me. This beer is a greater sipper. Overall, this one is well worth a try. These types of beers are so far left than many of the other styles that they are just fun to drink."
"This is hands down my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer... The flavor, funk, and tartness are everything I want out of a JP beer. This is so good."
"D: Overall I think the sourness covers up a lot of the other flavors. Nearly all the oak character is covered up by the sourness. As I continue to drink I can pick up a bit more of what the beer beneath the sour is, but I still think this could be nearly any base beer and many people wouldn't be able to pull out the original style. It's good, but I think this degree of sour muddles up anything that the base beer was.. I enjoy it, but I probably wouldn't get it again."
"Pours a dark ruddy brown with hints of amber and purple. Nose reveals the sharp sourness, which has a bit of funk and vingar like quality, that matches wits with a caramel and toffee base, loads of dark fruits, hint of cocoa, light roast. A little acidic and sharp for my liking, lacking the integration of many of JPs other offerings. A little too sharp carbonation which presents the beer as thinner than it is, just wasn't that drinkable for me."
"Pours a hazy brown almost an amber color with good head and some lace. The aroma is very funky with cheese horse blanket sour cherry and some bread. The flavor is very sour with some lemon peel and is well balanced with a good strawberry and fruity character. The beer is dry and oaky and has some vinous notes. Beautiful."
"Pours a rich honey brown with a finger of creamy head that put down some nice lace spots. Caramel, earth and funk on the nose, along with very light vinegar notes. Interesting flavour. Surprisingly malty, with caramel and cocoa notes that provide a decent sweetness. A light funky acidity lurks underneath, but doesn't seem as pronounced as others indicate other batches have been. Medium body and carbonatio work well for me."
"Yum."
"This beer is a sipper. It took me about an hour and a half to get the bottle down and I did in fact enjoy it. The smell was beautiful and it did taste great. My only beef with this is I feel that it is too hard to take down a bottle. I did enjoy it a great deal but I felt that it was a bit too alcoholic for the style. I would have enjoyed a smaller serving but next time I will probably split this. A little pricey but for sure worth trying"
"Drinkability good, I would certainly try this one again."
"D- I really liked this beer. The sourness is just enough, not too strong but still there through the whole beer. Its a very refreshing beer. Lots of juicy fruits."
"Drinkability: I love the flavors and the refreshing tartness; it's not overpoweringly sour or funky; a solid body with a little weight that isn't killing the stomach; the acidity gets to be a little much after a while, but it is still most definitely enjoyable. Yet another solid offering from JP! Cheers and mahalo!"
"Drinkability: At first I thought this beer was only ok, but then I realized that this is a beer takes some getting used to. I have the suspicion that it's the type of beer that will grow on me over time. I certainly intend to revisit this beer to see if I like it better or less the next time around."
"balanced by black pepper, funky brettanomyces, and apple/cherry tartness. The finish is yeasty and lingering, with a bracing sour bite."
"All in all this is a terrific beer. It would be a good introduction to real lambics since it has some of the same characteristics, but is a bit more restrained than many of the lambics that I've had the pleasure of tasting."
"Passingly paired this beer with turtle cheesecake and tiramisu desserts from an Italian restaurant we were eating; paired well with the bretty and acetic complexity of the beer balancing the sweet and creamy attributes of the desserts"
"750 ml bottle, sticker on bottle says Blend 2, Bottled 2-24-10. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is low, not much lacing either. Aroma is nice and tart, the brew smells like tart apples, vinegar, funk, cherries, and an earthy aroma. It tastes pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some oak, peppery spice and some grapes/red wine. The tart/sour taste is the most noticable out of all the flavors, which is definitely a good thing for me! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit dry and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink and I enjoyed it. Overall I think this is a good brew, it's definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: This would have to be a weekend beer for me given the volume and ABV. This was a really well put together beer though. It doesn't punch you in the face with flavor, but it's a great beer to sip on and all the characteristics of the beer keep things fun and enjoyable."
"Thanks for sharing Mike! The second of many at what ended up being Tuesday night Jolly Pumpkin Bonanza! Sampled side by side with the reserve version. Not as cloudy as the reserve, and pours deep mahogony/amber with medium beige froth. After a minute, looks like a barley wine. More subtle in aroma than reserve, less booze, and more fruit. Lots of apples, pear, with mild hints of caramel and a funk that is not as pronounced. Very tart, with super bretty funk taste, and lots of yeast. STrange fruitty bitter flavours too, that last through the finish. Very soft and silky. ANother champ from JP. Thanks Mike!"
"D: I've been nursing on this bottle for close to three hours and I'm still digging it. The citrus sharpness becomes more pronounced as time passes, giving the ale a nice bite."
"Tasty but esoteric & challenging. One is good, two would be overkill, & I'm not so sure I'd be able to taste a second anyway."
"I'm looking forward to enjoying my remaining bottle sometime soon."
"D: Pretty drinkable, pretty tasty."
"[edit] As odd as this seems, I had a piece of strawberry filled dark chocolate Godiva with this and it was utterly amazing. The two went together superbly."
"Batch 346/348. Costly at $11 and bought in Detroit suburb. Oh well, I guess they could use the stimulus. Nice color; deep ruby brown. Smell is very astringent like a sour. Taste is pretty good although nothing like I expected by reading the style listed on the bottle and written in beer advocate. The bottle reads ""French Style Stock Ale."" Sounds fairly unassuming and expected it to taste like a French farmhouse ale. It doesn't. It tastes like a sour but more complex. I think the aging in oak barrels makes this a much more drinkable beer and the taste is unique and complex. The aftertaste follows that theme and although this is a tasty beer and more drinkable than a typical sour (I'm thinking flemish sour, Flanders style with wild yeast) it's a beer to be savored and shared ideally."
"While this may not be something I seek out every day, it's greatly appreciated. This is a clear case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Quite well done."
"Drink: Excellent, just enough sour tart refreshingness to kill most of a bottle."
"D - Like most other Jolly Pumpkin beer if I had to choose the only beer I could drink again I would be hard pressed not to choose it the people at Jolley Pumpkin make some of the best beers out there worth hunting down to try"
"Hazy burgundy appearance with a lasting cap of pure white. Good retention and lacing. Lactic sourness in the nose, vinous, fruity, musty. Grapes, damp basement, faintly malty sweetness. The aroma really opens up as it warms. The taste closely follows the nose; soured red wine, lactic acidity, unripened berries, mild acetic acid and tannins. Dry throughout, on the lighter side of medium-bodied. Crisp and refreshing, perfect on a day like this, just the job. Tannic, vinous finish. Another excellent beer from this great brewery."
"A great beer, wonderful fizzy carbonation and downright drinkable. The wife didn't care for it, considered it 'too belgiany'. Oh well, she found herself an IPA, so she's set."
"Overall, an interesting brew, worth trying - sort of like a wild-ale/saison hybrid."
"Smooth, easy drinker. Medium bodied, with the typical JP carbonation. My first Biere de Garde, and it was a good one."
"I'm enjoying this beer to bits, really complex and impressive in flavour, yet very pleasant and drinkable, with a great palate profile."
"A refreshing and complex beer - very pleasant indeed with plenty to keep me interested. Supremely drinkable for its complexity - it's like the layers are there to discover if you so desire, otherwise it can be enjoyed as a refreshing rustic brew. Very jolly indeed."
"A refined sour that tastes much like an Oud Bruin. The beer pours a reddish brown color with amber highlights and a dissipating head that leaves little lacing. The aroma is sweet and fruity, lemons, apples, grapes, barley. The flavor is rich and deeper than expected. There's a medium acidity with a healthy oak flavor. The flavors meld quite well for an Oud Bruin, but I really haven't had many. The feel is relatively light. The alcohol is well-hidden. It's another sour that makes me wish sours were cheap and plentiful because I could drink it all night."
"Its a decent beer, not great, but it would be mind blowingly good if not for that damn after taste."
"Pours a very dark brown, pruney almost. Odd for a BdM or BdG. Slight head, quickly dissipates. Smells hugely vinegaric - like an absolute sour bomb with nothing else in it. Like a Oud Bruin with no balance to it whatsoever, no malt for balance. Wearily, I try a sip. It goes beyond vinegaric to downright offensive - with this style though, I don't know if they were shooting for a sour bomb, or if it has an infection (given the yeasts they go for). I think I made it about 3 sips with this before drainpouring the rest. I'm going to check into it, and will edit the review if it is not supposed to be like this."
"Notes: Not the best JP offering by any means, and certainly not your typical biere de garde, it ends up being relatively enjoyable... especially sniffing it."
"why did it take this long to show up in massachusetts? more more more!"
"Batch #256 A muddy deep amber pour with a big offwhite head,loads of carbonation and some nice spotty lacing.Aroma is of tart fruit,oak barrel, earthy yeast funk,peppercorns and spice.Flavor is complex, sour apple,tart cherry very funky,earthy,slightly dusty, some caramel,brown sugar, and oak, light body,bubbly clean mouthfeel, with a dry tart finish."
"D- Good"
"Flavor certainly has malt characteristic to it with a touch of the barrel. 7% alcohol has a bit of a presence which surprised me since I usually don't pick that amount up."
"Call me a sucker for oak-aged beers brewed with wild yeast, but I've been working my way through the Jolly Pumpkin line and enjoying every sip so far. This brewery has ""unique"" written all over it, each beer having its own personality. Initially surpised by the darkness of the pour, a ruddy brown yet clear to the light, ruby edging and a short lived head. Smell is lively and full of yeasty bugs, strong oak, and underlying fruit, cherry and crab apple. Wow I was sort of expecting a more carbonated and lighter Biere de Garde but this is one of those non-category hybrid beers, almost like a dryer sour brown ale. Zesty wild yeast plays big here out front, with a nice mellow fruityness as the body of the beer, finishes pleasantly sour and with huge oak and dry woody tannins. Really excellent. Perfect with food. Though not as carbonated as I expected, this brew proves to be very refreshing and a different twist on the style. Once again I'm not surprised to be surprised by another great offering from ye Jolly scalawags."
"Beer pours a burgundy color into my Rochefort chalice. Smell is cherries and Brett yeast. Taste is similar with some sourness, a more mellow version of the Duchesse. Very easy to drink with no alcohol presence. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit but it didn't knock my socks off."
"D- I find this beer to be pretty damn drinkable. This beer simply blew me away! I love Jolly Pumpkin, this one may be the best beer that I've tried from them so far. Highly Recommended!"
"This beer is a delicate, easy drinking, slightly sour offering from Jolly Pumpkin."
"One heck of an ale. I wish there were more American breweries like Jolly Pumpkin."
"Medium-low carbonation with a semi-dry finish. Quite easy to drink."
"Highly recommended."
"This beer is drinkable, I was definitely happy with this one and will probably buy it again."
"Pours a hazy orangish color with a beige head. The nose has oak, tart fruits, manure, and candy malts. The taste was well balanced, but could have used more of a baryard funk presence. Medium body is well carbonated. A good beer from Jolly Pumpkin. Pairs well with aged cheese."
"I would recommend this to a freind as one of my top rated active bottled beers for the Biere De Garde style."
"8/4/8/3/16/3.9"
"Drinkability - This, like all other Jolly Pumpkin beers, is a very easy drinking sour. The sour is light and even, and would probably be a good sour to start with for people who don't have a taste for sours. Jolly Pumpkin should hurry up and get distribution in Texas."
"Tangy tart apples, persimmon, mild cheese, slight bitter edge from the wood. Earthy dry aftertaste, almost like bittering hops. The fruity notes taper quickly leading into the tart and seemingly bitter dry aftertaste. Mild Brett character, a touch medicinal and horseblankety. Effervescent body carries it well, it definitely has substance. This is another unique Wild ale/Bière de Garde/un-pigeonhole-able experimental brew from JP..."
"Overall I was OK with spending this much money on a beer from a brewery that I wasn't overly impressed with previously. I'll be sure to try more of their beers after this, and you should too."
"D: I could probably drink anything from JP for the rest of my life, amazing palate characteristics form from their barrels. try to get this one....it is phenomenal."
"this brew pours up a murky reddish brown with a nice big frothy tan head. good lacing, too. the nose is very floral with a slight sourness to it, subtle oak, some citrus fruits. it tastes of apples, citrus, oak, subtle spicy hops, subtle sweet malts, some sourness. medium bodied, medium carbo. I prefer this one over Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza...."
"Another decent JP beer that's a bit too heavy on the lactic for my tastes. I love the sour and acidic beers, but the lactic quality here cuts down on the drinkability."
"Damn tasty brew. Not the most complex, and a little pricey, but well worth a shot if you see it."
"D- still a really good tasting beer. Didn't seem as unique as most JP beers, but it was still enjoyable."
"Biere de Mars is another high quality beer from Jolly Pumpkin that I wouldn't hesitate to pick up again. They have the sour aspects of their beers down to a science and they all seem to be within moderation. Unfortunately, it's getting harder and harder to find their beers around these parts. It seems like they're just not on the shelves anymore."
"Dense foam head, one finger beige will not quit with generous, small bubble carbonation. Chestnut colour, heavy retention, solid ring. Smells of over ripe fruit. The alcohol is a bit in your face, I kept wondering if it was corn-based giving it a bourbon-esque mouthfeel. Jolly Pumpkin, I'm told, uses wild yeast and oak barrels, that might account for the strong flavour. I thought I detected a sour, rotten-fruit backdrop but with a redeeming fruit-cake presence as well. Overall, another interesting offering from a fine Michigan brewery, recommended."
"Bottle courtesy of Secret Santa: Poured a clean copper color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma is zesty, orangey and very funky. Taste is also a typical JP mix between some orange, lightly sweet lemon with some distinctive barnyard and bretty notes. I think I detect some spices but there are not too prominent and might come from the yeast used in this beer. Full body with good carbonation and no distinctive alcohol. Very well done again from a brewer that just can't stop to amaze me."
"Pours a hazy copper/ orange-ish with a light tan head. In the aroma, oak, cherry, and vanilla. In the taste, somewhat smokey and sour, white grape flavor as well. A sour bite, and medium mouthfeel, with a dry sour cherry like aftertaste. Biggest oak flavor I think I have ever had, Exceptional!"
"2007. Autumn colored, with a lasting foam that forms great shapes. Nose has some funk, a bit of oak, some fruit, could be more vibrant. Flavor is nicely balanced. Brett, oak, funk, some fruit, with a bit of an unpleasant cooked corn note as well. Just ok. I'm not the biggest JP fan. All their beers taste the same."
"Drinkability - Not my style at all. As far as the style goes it holds its own. Should defenitely not be a stopping point for the average drinker. Know the style before drinking."
"D- Overall a sour beer. I'm no fan of this style. i guess you really have to like sour beer to enjoy this. i sure didn't."
"D- A little heavy on the sweet and sour. This is definitely a sipper."
"D - Overall, this is a good beer. The bottle is not hard to finish at all but I think it would really be one of those beers that you either like or hate. You have to like the tart and brett taste of this one to enjoy this beer. If you don't like those flavors, I would avoid this all together. Fortunately, I like tart and funk so I think this is a good beer. Reminds me a bit of the LA Red Poppy even though they are completely different styles."
"this beer is wonderful, not for everyone but very balanced and interesting. get a round of brie and some water crackers"
"Drinkability- For most, hardly any, but for me, well I could drink this all day long. Sadly, I can't be doing that with Ron's new pricing structure. I may snag another for aging purposes though. I'm sure this beer for aging will age quite well."
"Overall, a darker funky Jolly Pumpkin. Good, but not my favorite."
"D- I like this beer. It pails in comparison to other JP beers I have had but that is entirely relative. They make incredible beer!"
"Drinkability: I'll be sad when this one is gone as I cannot remember where I got it (it's been in my cellar for a while) and I haven't seen it recently"
"Beautiful deep cherry color, translucent near the bottom and becoming darker near the thick, creamy head. Oak on the nose, with huge Belgian floral notes coming through with the first sip. Lots of sourness, with cherry, bitter unripened peach, ans spice in the background."
"Appears a burgundy burnt caramel amber hue with a large tan beige head forming with fine even lacing around my glass of course tiny bubbles cling to the glass and head has nice retention, with even Belgian style lacing left behind on my chalice. Aromatics bring tart with spicy funk reminiscent Jolly Pumpkin tones but the tart aspect rains supreme and brings with it some fruity vinous notes combining a cherry and raisin nose about it of course the wood aging and spice additions openly fermented all way into the wave of different characteristics this beer is capable of. Flavors a blend of sweet lactic tinged cherry juice with oak barrel woody and pine notes coming out. Underlying spice and horse blanket funk and yogurt like tang. Really a fine beer by the way you almost need cheese and crackers to pair with this beer, it really cuts through it all quite nicely. If any hops are detectable they come off like herbal earthy cherry pits, by the way this stuff goes so well with food. Completely clears all fat from the palate mouthfeel is fine bubble carbonation streaking effortlessly leaving a dry tart lactic tone on my tongue. Sounds not so good, right? But when it comes down to it, this characteristic blends so well with so many other familiar flavors that I'm not accustomed to. Drinkability is really effortless the bottle drains itself just pair this fine brew with some food and everything will come together for you, definitely a delicious brew that I'm ready to handle any time. Worth the hype on this one, I still love Jolly Pumpkin like the first time I tasted their beers, now that''s love."
"D - Another tasty funky beer from JP."
"The taste is acidic up front, tart and sharp and full of funk and cheesiness. Melds nicely into a balancing apple sweetness. There's lots of woody, oaky notes as well with a hint of vanilla, very pleasant. Spicy hop notes, peppery and herbal, meld into a surprising bitterness in the finish, and a hint of mellow malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mellow carbonation that's just about right. A little sticky but not super dry. This a nice sipper for a chilly spring evening, and one I'd like to have again in the future."
"Pours out a hazy to cloudy honeyed amber body with a thick, full head and tons of bubble action in the body. Leaves a lot of lacing. Smells of faint crackery malts and caramel tones underneath loads of funk, fruitiness and spiciness. I get lots of fresh apples, apple cider and apple cider vinegar here. Yeast gives this a spiciness with tones of clove and ceylon cinnamon. I pick up some oranges as well. Flavor is kind of thin in the malt department. Extremely dry. What subtle caramel and toasted malt qualities I got in the nose are even more muted here. Kind of like this has funk for funk's sake and it doesn't mesh as well as with their other beers. Has a weird acrid bitterness in the finish. Has quite a medicinal lingering effect. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy. I usually love JP's offerings, but I'm quite disappointed in this one. Maybe fresher would be better for these, but for a beer touting itself as a stock ale, I would expect better from a beer having been aged for a year under good conditions."
"D- This beer has a really nice balance of grapefruit and funk with all of the flavors well blended and a bit mysterious. This beer makes me urn for spring and the warm months of sipping great beers."
"Poured into my Darkness goblet. First off- bottle wasn't a gusher, so that's a minor victory. Ok, now what do we have? Dark reddish oak colour with excellent clarity and fluffy off white head. Nice silky lacing. Nose- a big whiff of that classic JP funk and woodiness. Taste- rich wood and earthiness. Brett presence is felt, but overwhelming sourness. Green apple, crab apple Very dry finish from the wood and some hops show up as well. Reminds of Fantome brew. Various spices in flavour that I can't pick out. The wood has really imparted a lot of flavour and character into this. Carbonation is spritzy and drinkability is high. Very addictive and just great stuff plan and simple."
"Pours chestnut with a great head that sticks around. Great lacing as well. Aromas of sour lemon, and a light graininess as well as sour orange and a touch of wood. The taste is similar, very drinkable with evolving complex flavors of sour and bitter and light overtones of oak. Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit creamy. The carbonation is restrained enough, the body is light enough, and the flavor profile is refreshing enough that you could just suck this one down."
"D - Very refreshing and drinkable. Quite reminiscent of Orval, but with a more pronounced sourness."
"Drinkability: As always, it's another weird, wild ride from Jolly Pumpkin."
"drinkable?: eh, you can drink it and finish.. its not a dumper."
"Another outstanding offering by Jolly Pumpkin. This beer may be the funkiest beer of the beers that I have had the privilage of sampling. The beer fills the nose with a mix of malt sweetness, soured malts, and a firm spicy, woody note. Very peppery, tart, fruity, and musty throughout. The look is a typical rusty hue, moderate haze (from sediment), and very well headed and constant lacing. Flavors alternate between estery fruits, malt sweetness, and bretnomyces sourness. No attribute dominates the brew, but complements it fully. Phenols gain precedence as the beer warms and also adds complexity without detering from the other flavors. Nicely bitter to round out the sourness and offset any sweetness. Much bitter and spiciness comes from the wood, and not so much from the hops. Finishes warm, dry and with a part-wood / part-fruit lingering. A seriously good offering from a seriously good brewery."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very soft and smooth, with a very good drinkability. This would almost work as a session beer for me, if I really did that. I will definitely be seeking this one out again the next time I'm in Michigan."
"Goes down way smoother than it should. I could drink this all day long!"
"The body is light as should be with most Belgian. Carbonation mixes well and enhances the tart quality. Overall this just feels off style but what is on style for Belgian beers?"
"Pours beautiful cloudy copper brown with mammoth long lasting tan head that you are forced to drink through. Fragrant with sour oak, earth, yeast, and wine. Flavor is layered and complex. An initial touch of hop gives way to a sour wine and oak center. The finish becomes bone dry, with big helpings of yeast, grainy coarseness, and black pepper. Body is surprising in its relative lightness, with wonderful smooth creaminess and bubbly zing. Great job Jolly Pumpkin!"
"The moment of truth... amazing taste! Surprisingly citrusy tang, cloves and corriander, banana, slight touch of hops, bits of alcohol, a nutty taste: almonds and cashews, also an overtone of oak coming through. Pretty awesome flavor! Sort of light bodied, but with some kick to it, moderate carbonation kind of buzzes in your mouth This accompanied by an alcohol warmth makes for quite the experience. This is one of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had."
"Other than Oro de Calabaza (another biere de garde) and Bam Biere (saison), I haven't been thrilled with Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales. Biere de Mars gets thing back on track. Maybe the difference is that I want and expect sour funk in beer of this style. I don't want it, nor do I expect it, in every single style. In any case, this one is definitely worth a purchase. Great label... as always."
"Pours a dark amber color. Nice half inch head on top of the glass. Smell is funky like a monkey. Jolly Pumpkin is rapidly becoming my favorite brewery. Plenty of spice in this beer. Maybe a little too much carbonation would be my only complaint. Anyhow, a very good beer."
"I just wished for a bit more malt body on this one. That said I would buy another on my next big beer run."
"Not as full and round as anticipated. Mid palate is substantially thin. Some floral aspects and spritzy carbonation. Funky and lively. Spicey apple flavors with a berry nut mix. Some delicate new oak on the finish. Very good but missing something in that mid palate."
"Good body, fluffy, soft carbonation. Not my favorite from Jolly Pumpkin, but still good."
"Lively carbonation with a heavy yeast, earthy flavor. Also, had a light fruit/tart flavor. This beer went down very easy. Drinkability is very high. In my opinion, this is one of the better Belgian style beers being made by a U.S. brewery."
"Mouth: Medium carbonation, some lingering sweetness"
"One can enjoy this easily with dinner, or sipping slowly in the company of friends. just don't expect it to blow you mind or bust your tastebuds in 10 or 12 new ways."
"Revisiting the 2007 thanks to in San Francisco. Bottle reads 386/388. Bottles? Batches? At any rate, this is a different beast from when I had it fresh. Initial pour yeilds a brief, but substantial head. Lovely color which holds on to a skim of foam and lacing. Sourness in the aroma has mellowed and the predominant smell is sweaty leather. Yum huh? Yeah it is. Mouthfeel is so much smoother, with no appearant carbonation, yet there was that head. Tastes indulgent and only slightly sour, but funky and beautiful. I am going to make it a point to try and hold on to JP beers now. This one aged beautifully, with a noticable change in both body and aroma."
"P.s. love the label"
"Overall impression: Definitely an interesting offering - I would rate it short of great, but it is very good."
"Overall: this was only my second biere de garde and first biere de mars, but I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed. Great aromatics and great flavors that were big but not overwhelming. Delicious and drinkable."
"Smells acidic like tomatos or ketchup, slight bit of oak and funk, smells really good. Tart but not sour, very easy to drink, subtle flavors, might be better fresh but it holds up well after 20 months or so."
"Overall, this one kind of took me by surprise. I didn't really know what to expect, but the sourness is not over the top and the oak balance is way above par. There isn't anything to hate in this one."
"Extremely drinkable and remarkably complex."
"Overall, a decent beer. So far it's my least favorite JP beer. I would've like to see a little more sourness, and less of the off bitter finish. As it warmed, it did smooth out some."
"Mouthfeel is very light with high carbonation to keep it interesting. Pretty drinkable, though I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these."
"Cheers!"
"Toasted, sweetish malt flavors up front. Light caramel, before a slightly lacto-tartness comes in. Citrusy and acidic and refreshing. Nearly cancels out earlier sweetness, but toasted malt edge remains. JP sourness isn't as strong in this brew compared to others (e.g. Perseguidor, Luciernega). Instead, the tart, wild funkiness really complements the malty caramel notes nicely. Well balanced. Finish is slightly drier and acidic, but with residual toasted sweetness. Another great creation from what is quickly becoming my favorite brewery!"
"Very well done."
"Good, deep amber garde color. But I expect a head much better than what I saw from this beer. Good bubbling, just terrible head retention. Good spicey toasty malts though. Made me think of herbal biscuits baking in the oven. The taste was a little flat considering all the visible carbonation."
"Not as good as I had hoped. The head was nearly non-existant, although the body itself looked nice. Smell reminded me of some of hy homebrews, actually. And it tasted like some of my first batches, too. I detected a bit of sweet toffee-like malt, but it was overpowered by an astringant finish that hindered drinkability. The alcohol was well-hidden, but I won't be buying another one."
"After its removal from the 750ml brown bottle, it pours a hazy brown, and upon reaching a level where I could decant the beer it forms an opaque brown with a creamy light tan head that is kingly in size, as it slowly dissipates, the residual lace forms a tight girdle upon the glass. Nose has that nice Oak Barrel tartness, the pleasing malt sweetness, citrus like crispness, and a real portent of the joys to come upon the tasting. Start is semi-sweet, or semi tart, your choice, nice grain presence, top is moderate in feel to the palate. Finish has a perfect acidity, the hops as they should be, understated but detectable, quite dry, desert bone dry to be exact, long lasting after taste glues itself to your palate, a prima fascia example of an often over looked style."
"D: I love Jolly Pumpkin."
"Pours into the glass a dark amber color with almost not head just a scattering of white bubbles capping the body. Sweet dark fruits with a big woody aroma. Tartness came out with some earthiness. While interesting it didnt quite all meld together well. Flavor started with some oak notes mixed with sweet and tart fruits. Some earthy barn funk added some nice depth. Yeast notes before the lightly tart fruit finish. Tasty stuff for sure but some about it seemed a bit out of place that kept it from being great in my book. A bit under carbonated for the style but smooth. Easy enough drinking stuff that provided a nice complex flavor but somehow fell just a bit short."
"This brew pours a clear brown color. The head is none existent. The aroma has a light sweetness to it with a rather ample tartness. The taste is quite nice with a refreshing, lingering, tartness. The mouthfeel is light bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a fine brew that I will most certainly have again."
"Man you gotta love the labels of the Jolly Pumpkin beers,this one poured a nice chesnut brown wich looked great when held up to the light a lighter fast dissapating head atop.The complexities of in the aroma are unbelievable,big orange zest with a number of herbs including sage and clove and quite musty.A beer to sit and savor and drink with food like cassoulet like me today,herbal and musty with a sour orange note in the finish.Much more to this beer than what I wrote I just dont take the time to type it all out,I absolutely love this beer."
"More or less translucent brownish chesnut color on the first pour. Small struggling head with not much going on in staying-power. Lace is much better, good rings on the glass. Orange-ade aroma, slightly estery with a bare yeastiness, but not that much. A little uncarbonated and flat (or is that just this bottle?), mouthfeel is lighter. Starts out with the characteristic Jolly Pumpkin sharpness with funky tones. Middle impression spreads out a little bit, slightly chalky bitter with mandarin orange and mellon notes. But the finish is a let-down, seems to fade to a definite wateriness that's not helped by the lack of carbonation -- not much but a bare tartness remains. Mildly warming in the stomach. Meh, not a favorite for me."
"Poured from 750 ml bottle. Low carbonation with very little head/lacing. Nice clarity for an unfiltered beer. Sour, tart aroma, with some apple, cherry, and earthy/barnyard aromas. Flavor is overwhelmingly tart up front. Mouthfeel is firm and structured, in spite of too little carbonation. Malt flavors struggle to make it out from under tart/sour flavors. Some nutmeg spiciness and honey, but just too tart for my preferences. Lingering bitterness. I love JP beers, but I don't think this is one of their best."
"Drinkability is great. I'd love to pair this with a corned beef on rye sandwich. A sturdy, rustic ale that's also very graceful. JP proves itself as a passionate & worthy brewery."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the lighter side, smooth and refreshing with a just enough bubbles. Keeps me coming back for more. I'd have to say this is one of my favorite JP brews so far and perfect for a 50 degree March day. Thanks to marburg for the opportunity. I'm planning on doing a Michigan trip this summer and can't wait to visit JP!"
"Had this one stashed away in the cold cellar since October, waited for the ""ides of March"" and ""to welcome the warmer weather"" as the bottle suggest. The bottle, by the way, very heavy 22oz. hand capped with a wicked illustration. Beyond excellent presentation for sure. Pours a hazy orange and red hued with lively carbonation which would persist. Strong, but not overly complex bouquet. I was happy to find the oak notes transcend as it warmed. I'd consider this fairly heavily bodied, in fact perhaps too bold in some respects. Strong hints of yeast with a gritty malt backbone. An off-putting sour mouthfeel but with a good, lasting finish. This is reminiscent of many sour Belgians - a la Rodenbach - but comes up very short in comparison. You can detect what others have referred to as 'grape' notes through its almost wine-like character (probably the effect of oak aging) Seems a fantastic brewery I hope to come across again. This one could stand to age a little, I find it perhaps too bold, but enjoyed rather much like this. A most appropo beer for (a Canadian in particular) March indeed."
"Pours a murky red, small white head forms, some spots of lace, head disappears to a ring that sticks around. Smell is sour cherries, vinegar, oak, vanilla, strange mix but neat. Taste is sourness up front, vanilla/oak, honey/wheat, cherries and yeast in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. A treat, thanks DrJay!"
"Try it if you find it, but only if you can't find La Roja first."
"This is quite a rich beer, and I don't mean that in a sort of thick, palate sort of way. Instead the fruit notes just give this beer a certain richness, that seem to make it an appropriate after meal time drink. A solid, though light, acidity finishes this beer off at the end of a sip; it is tart like an apple or plum perhaps. This is really accentuates that feeling, for me, that this would make a good after meal drink. The acidity almost acts as a digestif for me, it keeps this light enough on the palate to be drinkable, but the rest of the beer keeps this rich enough to be a contemplative after meal treat."
"Hazed reddish caramel colour with an off-white head. Fine bubbles, some lacing. Grassy hop aroma with a bit of sour cherries and some barnyard character. Maybe a wisp of caramel as well. Light tartness with mild to moderate bitterness and a chewy malt sweetness. Some yeast character and faint grain husk. Slightly tart finish with a bit of spice and wood character. Some slickness with creamy carbonation and a full body. A very good beer, quite enjoyable."
"I cellared this one for about 4+ months before I cracked it (not all that long, but it was calling me tonight). The 'fresh' samples I've had were much sweeter and less tart- both excellent, but different. Either way this is one of my favorite of Capt. Rons creations, and the beer that turned me on to the Biere de Garde style. That being said this is definitely an outlier for the stylenot that it matters or that the jovial yet menacing Jolly Pumpkin gives a damn. The oak aging makes itself far more well-known in this brew than its francophone brethren. Its also quite a bit darker and perhaps a bit thicker bodied. But again, the Pumpkin could care lessand Im with him."
"cloudy amber colour, lots of lace. Sourness in nose.Wheaty, biere de garde, aggressively carbonated, making for full mouthfeel Well malted more than Jenlain. Bitterness at end.Woodiness. aftertaste I had problems finishing with Dr. Jay and Viggo, but still nice."
"A touch sour flavor with a hint of alcohol on the swallow. Some tea flavors and sweet malt characteristics. A touch bitter from hops... slightly grapefruit in nature. Musty. Applely at points. Dry."
"This is another ale from Jolly Pumpkin that is worth seeking. The Biere de Mars really does remind me of a farmhouse ale from the French countryside."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a frothy 1 3/4"" tan head over the clear burgundy brew. Head lasts and lasts, leaving sporadic large hunks of foams on the glass sides. Aroma is spicy breads and yeast, over a lightly fruity maltiness. Taste is similar to the nose, but additionally light woody and sour notes come out, and the close is dry and slightly alcoholic. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and drinkability is very nice as well, as per usual for JP. Another hit here."
"From BA TheBlackMallard, this 750 ml bomber was quite exotic looking, especially considering the fact that it originated in Michigan. The reddish amber colored beer that resided in it came out bubbly and foamy, and looked quite at home in a tulip. The aroma was mild but complex, evoking soured cherries, plums, freshly cut oak logs, and oranges. The taste was tart and dry with loads of oak tannins. A flash of lemon sourness mixed with some brown sugar was apparent as well. Balanced delicately between all the flavors so none was dominant, which made it very easy to drink, despite the sawdust dry mouthfeel. In the words of Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld, Wood is Good."
"This is my favorite of Jolly Pumpkin's offerings: a brew with a complex flavor profile that is well-hopped and entirely quaffable."
"Overall, a good beer at a cheap price from a local place. Jolly Pumpkin has a certain reputation around this area and this is the first thing that I've tried from them. While it doesn't wow me, it is certainly solid enough and I am definitely willing to give some of their other brews a go."
"A well made brew from Jolly Pumpkin. Poured out to a hazy burnt orange color with a nice white and orange hued head. Medium high carbonation. Islands of lace are abundant in the glass. Aromas of yeast, rotted fruit, mild roasted malts and grass. Taste was a bit of a let down compared to the smell; flavors of malt, wood, yeast, and sweetness went well together, but overall, this brew seemed like it was missing a piece of the puzzle. Mouthfeel was good and hearty without being over bearingly thick or heavy. A decent level of drinkability overall. This is a good beer de garde, but i've had better. Worth a try."
"First of all, this beer is fun now, but will get increasingly interesting with age. Its also not necessarily a biere de garde (like Jenlain or Bavay), so don't judge it as such. I'm sure I will greatly edit my review since this a maddeningly complex brew that is guaranteed to change and is built to age."
"Just a little more spice from the hops and this one is fantastic."
"Some initial caramel. A subdued complexity that is hard to put into words. The bannana hinted at in the nose becomes quite muted. Some nice plum sort of flavours float around through the middle and lead to a bone dry finish that lingers for a moment and then invites another sip. Some Brett character subtly working its way into the profile. Medium bodied, gentle carbonation. This beer is just crying out to be enjoyed with a meal. Shows some interesting promise for aging. A distinctly American interpretation of biere de garde, that some will treasure (I think you can count me as a fan)."
"I can see this one being a solid session beer when paired with the right grub."
"from the bottle (1pt 9.4oz0 bought at a store. poured a reddish color, with a beige head. aroma, sour, orange, floral, as it warms some anise and malt comes out. flavor orange, cherries, caramel , yeast, did get just a touch of wood. nice clean and dry finish."
"This is a daunting beverage. I enjoy it a great deal, though I hesitate to sing its praises too loudly until I've tried it again in six months when I think it will be truly amazing. If beers in this spirit comprise the future of American brewing, I'm looking forward to being around for the ride."
