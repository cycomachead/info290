"This bottle was past it's BEST BY date and kind of on the flat side. I will try again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is interesting with very little head.  The smell has a funk or a spice I do not care for, but it was not prevalent in the beer, and the taste really grew on me.  Very good beer."
"Good light feeling, but still with a full mouth feel with a smooth dry finish."
""
""
"Not sure what this style is supposed to be like but this beer is ok."
""
""
""
"3.9/5: The nose is like a cheese-eating surrender monkey; the flavor is like Charles De Gaulle"
""
""
""
""
"Amber to gold in color with nice foam and some lacing.  Mild aroma.  Enjoyable malty taste.  Very mild, but suprisingly complex.  Lingers in the mouth and goes down easy.  Overall a very enjoyable brew."
""
"It's ok. Nothing special normal beer"
""
""
""
""
""

"A light amber beer with incredible amounts of flavors - all well balanced. I was surprised at the myriad  of flavors, from spices to fruits to caramel, but it all works so well. And, somehow, the beer goes down easy and is very light.  It is a sweet beer, but nothing over the top.  All in all, this is a great beer for sitting around a porch, chatting, and just having a high quality crafted beer."

"O-This is pretty solid beer. I don't know that I will go out of my way to find it again, but for general drinking purposes, this fits the bill very nicely. It offers good complexity and I can see it pairing well with food."

"Served in a chilled pint glass Nice copper color, not much head. This farmhouse ale has a very satisfying taste. I like it."
""
""
""
"Brown in color with good clarity.  A fingernail of beige foam covers the majority of the top.  Aroma is all amber malt.  The flavor is primarily amber malt with notes of caramel.  The mouth is lightly salty and dry."

"What a nice ale. Dark amber color, smooth clean flavor on the palate. Mild caramel flavor and nice lace on the edge of the glass."
"6 pack for a gift!   Happy accident for me!"

"The alcohol was perfect here and that's not something that I say very often, but it complemented everything else so wonderfully. While not a Pumpkin beer, this had the feel one one in certain aspects without being overly spicy or heavy tot he taste. If there was a bit of champagne yeast in this, it wouldn't surprise me as this had a light feel to it from start to finish. This was wonderful stuff that put a smile on my face and proved to me that more U.S. brewers should give this style a go and while not as potent or full as something imported here, Two Brothers had a winner here that's sure to offend no one. Give it a go before the fall weather gives way to old man winter!"

"O: A rather enjoyable biere de garde, which manages to provide a decent array of hop flavors without steamrollering the malt."

"Pours a hazy, copper color.  3/4 inch head of an off-white color.  Good retention and decent lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, alcohol, pale malt, sugar, hint of caramel malt, euro yeast, and a hint of biscuit.  Fits the style of a Biere De Garde.  Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, alcohol, pale malt, euro yeast, hint of caramel malt, and hint of hop.  Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, good feel, and decent body."

"O: Some big flavor but easy to drink. I'm not hugely into this mashup of hoppy/amber/farmhouse. Luckily they don't take either of those elements too far and end up with something pretty good."

"The beer is slightly hazy, with a deep amber body and a reddish cast beneath a short but creamy head of white foam. The nose is offers a combination of delicately toasty and straw-like grain with caramel and slight fruitiness. The body is medium-light with a zesty, very-fine bubbled carbonation. The flavor starts with bold, toasty and caramel malts upfront, followed by a splash of fruit (sour cherry, tangerine, plum) that fades into a rather dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light. The beer reminds me of a toastier and drier Irish ale. I loved it."

"Medium body, maybe a touch over, light-medium effervescence. Slight warming after the swallow. Smooth, reasonably clean finish. A nice brew for certain."

"Nose: floral with a hint of ethanol.  Not a lot of head retention. Taste: crisp, light, and delicious.  I was expecting this beer to be a bit sweeter/syrupy judging by the appearance, but I was wrong. This is a fantastic beer. Malty light and full of flavor"

"Overall: Great beer. I have not had many beers of this style so it is difficult to compare it to others, but it did not disappoint me. Recommended!"
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/29/2014. Pours fairly cloudy copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, pear, apple, biscuit, floral, grass, pepper, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and compexity of malt, hop, and yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, floral, grass, pepper, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, pear, apple, floral, grass, and pepper on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; with a crisp malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Biere de Garde style! All around good balance and robustness of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Original beer, although it is very smooth and lay back, it has more depth than initially suggests. Worth trying."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has some malts, a bit of sweetness. Taste is crisp, malts, grains, a bit of biscuit, light caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours medium dark amber with a solid white ring of foam. Thin layer on top. Mostly see through, grains, breads, caramel, light toast. Tastes like a rich caramel amber with a hint of white wine. Light toffee toast too,. Touch of bitter sneaks in at the end. Clever."

"I like this beer and am learning to appreciate the local craft/micro beer companies, but am thinking I picked the wrong 1st 2Bro brew.. It's a fine beer to be certain, but my taste buds are evolving from an adjunct mass produced brew to a more refined beer with character and distinction.. I will say that this beer is crisp, has a clean sweetness, and finishes with class .. a floral beauty to be sure.. My taste buds have been seeking a hoppy, IPA bitter appreciation as of late.. But 2 Bro is a pleasant change to my recent beersperation so to speak.. I may review again after a 2nd try, but this French Country entry is good. Just not sure it's where my beer mind is wandering.. It's definitely a class beer.. and I need to grow up from an adjunct mentality to a classy Micro-Brew entry.. Will re-visit as my taste buds mature in a world of every changing beer-scape.."

"Overall this is a fantastic French Country ale. One of Two Brothers best regular offerings. It's a great change of pace from my usual go-to APA(Sidekick)/IPA's. Way to go guys!"

"Highly drinkable with a great flavor, a very enjoyable brew well worth trying and something I will definitely look for again in the future."

"O:A well balanced ale that is a good pairing with any foods, pleasant and compliments foods but does not cave in as a simple beverage, it is distinct enough to add to the meal as a component and not simply hydration."
""
"Based on tasting their other beers, there is no indication that Two Brothers is liable to change their philosophy, which seems to be ""Make it Different."" But ""different"" doesn't always mean ""better."""

"This is a very safe and enjoyable beer. It has all of the characteristics that can be found in an amber ale. Solid brew right here."
""
""
""

"Poured into grand tulip; darker orange/amber with a medium fizzy white head that dissipates in a few moments, leaving some scattered lacing. Smells of toasted malt, with slight bitterness and some leafy notes. Taste is nutty toasted malt with a wet, clean feel to it. Reminds me of a wee heavy, but less boozy. Slight twinge of crisp hops finishes off, leaving some sticky remnants of the toasted malt behind. My first of the style, and it seems tasty."

"a strange brew here, to dial up a classic rock reference this morning. French style country ale, was I naïve to think this was going to be a saison? it pours a surprising maple amber color, with only a little cloudiness, and a very short lived white head. it doesn't look or smell like any saison ive seen, instead emitting aromas of coppery toasted barley and an acidic wine like ester that must come from the yeast. the flavor isn't so abstract, its pretty much an amber ale on the malt front, sweeter, a tad dry, and caramel or toffee teasing. the yeast makes this interesting, but it doesn't totally work, green apple tartness, and a funny complexity that seems an accident, like the odd mix of smells in well used dishwater, rather than a meticulously honed fine ale. still, the final product doesn't taste bad at all, its just a style of beer I wasn't expecting, and I am not sure what it is, it seems quite far from the traditional biere de gardes of the world. it needed more carbonation, and the sweetness was an out of place last note. I did enjoy this beer in retrospect, but it was confusing and challenging to me at the same time. I will look for more from two brothers."

"I hope so too as I do not want to be duped in my own domain! Having learned my lesson with an earlier iteration of the style, I went with a kinder, gentler pour on this one. I ended up with a finger of foamy, deep-tan head that quickly fell away to wisps. Color was an elegant deep-amber, close to copper, with NE-quality clarity. Speaking of Nebraska, I recently got turned onto (both literally and figuratively) Val MidWest, a young lady from Lincoln who has an adult website and recently made news when she returned to her Catholic high school for an after-hours photo shoot! The nose on this was was really sweet, almost syrupy in its intensity with an underlying scent of dried dark fruits. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was unexpectedly less sweet than I had anticipated. Instead, it had a fruity quality, almost like fruitcake. In fact, that is exactly what it reminded me of with its bready, malty backbone to accompany the fruitiness! Wild. Finish was semi-sweet and actually quite refreshing in its reserved nature. This had the potential to be an over-the -top malt bomb but the masterful use of the yeast really worked well with the malt. I would recommend giving this a try."
"It’s a tasty and easy drinking beer. I prefer a hoppier or less sweet beer, but this is a surely a great starter for those getting into craft."

"I'm not sure what separates this style from an amber ale but it seemed to have a lot in common. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - How many French country ales have you had? There is nothing quite like it. You must try this."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very tasty, easy drinking brew; great malt/hop/carbonation balance, quenching and tasty brew."
""
""
""
"O: have only had a few of this style, but definitely the best I have had so far; would definitely be a go-to if I lived in Chicago area"
"Overall: Pretty tasty and enjoyable. I'm not very familiar with the style, but I'll definitely try more french country/bier de garde to get a better sense. Also, one of the prettiest amber/copper colors I've seen in a beer."

"This poured out as a clear amber color with a fluffy white head on top, the retention and lacing are both pretty good. The smell is light, moderate malt and hop aromas here. The smell is earthy and kind of sweet. The taste of the beer is earthy, decent amount of malt with a caramel finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, light bodied and easy to drink. Overall it's a decent brew."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Clear copper body with an off-white head, moderate retention, with mostly clear lacing. Aroma includes a fresh hop blast, slight caramel malts and maybe a saison-like yeastiness. Taste includes a caramel sweetness, some candi sugar, slight hop bitterness and again, a saison-like yeast taste. Overall, a tasty beer, not sure how close to style it is, but not bad at all."

"Overall: nice spicy brew which nicely follows the style and isnt over carbonated like I feel many of these are."
""
"Faintly hazed bright reddish coppery hue with a thin bubbly head. Candies fruit nose with a mild earthiness. Thin up front but oddly the body gets bigger on the finish. Rolling smooth medium body but close to flat. Sweet fruitiness with a coarse grainy flavor. Finishes with mild alcohol heat and faint woodiness. Long lingering Fruity finish. Balance is there somewhat leaning on the sweet side. Interesting and good beer but definitely something odd about it. Not as clean as id like with a very strange mouth presence."
""
"Nothing really wrong with this beer but nothing going on as well. Style wise - very mellow and semi sweet type of style. I can drink it, but won't seek this style out."
""
""
""
"Overall: If this is what they serve in the French countryside, l wouldn't mind spending some time there."
""
""
""
""
"Its a step above macro...meh. I will never have again."

"Overall, my first offering from Two Brothers and I was definitely not let down!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good white head. Reddish carmel clear colour. A gentle hop aroma with a decent bitter finish."
""
"O: I've had a few in this style in my day, and this is about in the middle."
"I've had this plenty of times, and had some left over from a Halloween party. Good change of pace for my tastes."
""
""
"A tasty little ""farmhouse"" ale - with more malt than many saisons and more hops than some biere de gardes; well priced, though further bottle conditioning might improve the affair."
"This is a real good ale though and it was really good, good autumn beer."
""
""
"O-A style I think is underrated a solid brew, not great. But gotta give props to people who brew Biere de Gardes."
"Overall, an impressive beer in a style that is not seen too often in the US. There is a lot of depth to this beer and a whole lot going on. Definitely one to pick up if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An 'OK' beer, a bit better than what I'd consider 'average'. The moniker 'French Style Country Ale' is more wordy than a 'Bière de Garde' needs to be... No matters, it's easy enough to drink. Enjoyed a couple of these at the cookout last month and was happy to have had another pre-dinner on a Monday at home."
""
"O - Oaky and spicy, leaving a tingle on the tongue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours amber-copper with a thin off-white head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are malty and sweet with toffee, vanilla, and toasted grain permeating the nose. Tastes are sweet, cloyingly sweet at times and towards the end. Notes of vanilla, toffee, toasted grains, caramel, brown sugar, raisin come to mind. Body is medium, creamy, and smooth with modest carbonation. Overall, it's delicate and pleasant but the sweetness gets to be too much towards the end. Still a nice offering from my local brewery."
""
"Overall: yes, this beer employs a biscuity malt character which I don't love. However, it is well put-together and, for a beer as biscuity as this, is not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tastes like a strange french craft ale version of many lagers, overly sweet and slightly unpleasant flavors that linger on your palate, it needs more lightness of flavor not just mouthfeel, the flavors aren't big and bold but they feel too heavy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Drink- Overall, a nice light creamy and refreshing Biere De Garde. Paired this with a blue cheese/walnut spinach salad and a grilled artichoke."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours deep orange with a very small off white head. Smells like black tea with some sweet floral presence. Tastes just as the nose let's on....tea upfront that mellows out very nice floral taste with some ripe citrus fruit notes. Mouthfeel is very thin with a very active carbonation. Overall pretty good session beer and very glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent, nothing to strong or overpowering about this beer. The farmhouse flavors are mild and smooth yet, theres enough bitter and sourness in it. Its worth a drink, and the price is really nice too."
""
"Overall the smell is nicely balanced but the taste and mouthfeel fall a little short."
""
""
"O - Net sweet profile with great complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very approachable - could be a great introductory beer for somebody just into craft. Along the lines of an amber, but more well-rounded, balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad Bière de Garde. Plenty of toasted malt, sour, and sweet malts to make it very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Overall, pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A nice simple table beer, would pair just fine with an appetizer of cheeses and light citrus vinaigrette based club salad."
""
""
""
"The copper-amber colored brew is capped with a nice cream cap of foam which left plenty of lacing down the glass. The aroma is a mixture of caramel mixed with the essence of sweet fruit. Some trailing spice opens the senses. Creamy malt flavors, biscuit mostly, pervade the palate experience. Muted hops at the end contribute some dried herbal flavors. This is a decent stab at the style, but I would like to see a bit more earthiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Malt strong but well balanced, hops really only provide bittering balance that lasts through the finish. Complexity hides deep within this oak-laced beer giving it supreme drinkability, something to savor and sip, exploring it's depth."
""
""
""
"I find the Domaine Dupage to be true to its style and quite tasty."
"O: I have never had anything from Two Brothers before, so I didn't quite know what to expect. This beer is a nice surprise. If this was a bomber, it would be a great table beer for a family dinner. As it stands, it's a nice example of a farmhouse ale that doesn't try to do too much, yet is well-executed. I would have this again, and I would be open to trying other beers from Two Brothers"
"Pours a clear coppery bronze with a nice cap of light tan foam that faded without leaving much lace. Smell is biscuits and light caramel, and a tad earthy. Taste is toasted biscuits, lightly sweet and nutty, caramels. Finishes clean and dry. Mouthfeel is medium with ample carbonation. Tasty brew."
"3.5 D: Tasty beer. I'm a big fan of the style, I wish I could find more of them."
""
"The alcohol presence wasn't bad, just seemed like a lot more than 5.9%."
""
"Domaine Dupage was one of my first Two Brothers beers. A great beer from one of my local brewers, Domaine Dupage is a standby for me around here, as many restaurants in the area have begun serving it lately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I don’t have much to compare it to, but it seems like a great mélange of English-style ale and Bavarian Saison. I have to give it props for hitting spot-on the “farmhouse feel”, even though I’d never really conceptualized it as such. I could definitely see people drinking something like this in the heat of the summer, and man is it tasty. I just wish I could get my hands on it on a regular basis."
""
"This beer is copper with a short white head. Interspersed among a nice fine layer of foam are a handful of bigger bubbles. There is a bit of spotty lacing as well, but minimal retention. Aroma is biscuity, mildly roast, and a bit nutty. Flavor is similar, with a mild earthy hop note and a nice mildly fruity yeast character. Sort of verging on a saison-ish character but a bit cleaner. Definitely goes well with the nutty, biscuit from the malt. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent, very nice and refreshing. Medium light bodied, but the carbonation makes it much more drinkable."
""
""
"Notes: moderate in body, with a very creamy mouthfeel. It's a very drinkable beer, and would accompany just about any dish. It's nice to see some American breweries experimenting with this style. Very enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
"This is a impressive beer. I recommend this one for sure."
""
"Reviewed on: 03-18-2011 17:25:50"
"If you're looking for a Biere de Garde in the Chicagoland area, there isn't much else of a choice besides this one. I'd think the oaked version of this beer would be killer good."
""
""
""
"nice clear dark amber/copper body a off white head rises to a finger and a half tall before settling to a frothy cap with decent retention and lacing. nose is mainly big bready malts with hints of biscuits and caramel. the tongue picks up some apple and pear along with a well balanced amount of hops. goes down nice and creamy smooth with a short clean finish. this is a good beer that pairs well with anything i eat with it. highly recommended."
""
"O - It's a decent beer. There is nothing remarkable about it, but it is worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a light, refreshing beer that has an above average drinkability. While the flavors were mostly subtle it still had a nice taste and I could drink several in one sitting."
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with very active carbonation, this beer is oddly not as refreshing as one would expect. The body is just light enough to allow the flavors to remain delicate. The carbonation fizzes away on your tongue at every point during the sip and almost gives this beer a sparkling quality."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the beer is very enjoyable and easy to drink. Light in flavor, yet complex enough to keep you wanting more. I wish this was available in my area..."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, mellow gingerbread note, but very faint. Inthe aroma, a faint earthiness and a small spice, but thin. A small spice bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry spice in the aftertaste. OK, but really nothing notable."
""
""
""

"O-I keep an eye out for this and have a corner spot of my mixed six reserved for this one. I am excited about exploring all of the Two brothers varieties that are becoming available to the NY area."
""
""
""
"D - Good taste and easy to enjoy; light flavor profile characteristics make this beer enjoyable any time of the year; I will admit that this is definitely a hard beer to make out"
""
""
"Carbonation is good, body is medium-thin, sort of a short and snappy finish. Refreshing but not as much as I'd hoped. This brewery makes 2 beers (at least) that are even more quenching and drinkable: the Dog Days Dortmunder style and the Ebel's Weiss. Domaine Dupage is nice but simple and unexceptional, saved to a degree by its unexpected bitterness."

"Overall: This is truly a winning beer. I've been an IPA drinker for a while and I've recently discovered my passion for stouts and porters- I would recommend this to absolutely anyone remotely interested in beer."
"Overall Impression- A fantastic Biere de Garde! I actually haven't had this style in a while, so it was nice to remember how much I like this style. My second brew from Two Brothers and am a HUGE fan of theirs! Go for this if you can find it."
"O - A good try from an american brewer on a biere de garde. Interesting enough to try again."
"First sampling of a Two Brothers beer. Pours a pretty enough orange, with a little bit of head, but once I get down to enjoying the beer, there's just no there there. Nothing unpleasant aromatically or tastewise, just bland. VERY bland. Left a strong impression the brewers were afraid of the flavors they were using. More power to the hundreds that have positive feelings for this beer. I just didn't get it."
"The taste is great starts malty and than the caramel, dark fruit and a slight sweetness hits aftertaste is a nice balance of malt and light hops."
"Quite tasty and refreshing. I think I need to try another, if that's any indication."
"Alcoholly-toased almond to amid-caramel roasted taste. Shifts as warms to lemony hops and a dry lemon finish. Moderately carbonated."
"D/O: This beer's marketing is very era-appropriate--ten years ago, it would have been labeled an ""amber"" without another look, but now the label seeks to appeal to our burgeoning awareness of the table beers bearing some nebulous nationality. In all truth, any comparison to New Belgium's ubiquitous Fat Tire ale is appropriate, but the comparer must admit that this is re-tooled with an eye toward depth. The two beers are similar, and both are probably equally approachable and user-friendly. The difference is the real depth present here, with layers of roast and umami underneath the heavy biscuit that makes this so much more repeatable."
"I’d consider this a nice beer to pair with food, but not something that stands out by itself."
"Next time why don't you try a french style country ale before you try and make one because if i did know any better this brewery just puts what ever they feel like on their labels. This is the second beer I have had from two brothers and will most certainly be my last."
"O - overall a very nice beer. Seems like every beer that I have had in this style is quite different, so I have no idea how well this fits the style, but his is a nice easy drinking brew."
"Overall, while it may be true that this beer doesn't adequately represent the flavors present in a French-style Country Ale, it is still a well-flavored and nicely balanced brew, and worth a taste."
"This is a flavorful, unique, medium-bodied beer that I could easily drink more than a few of in one session. Then note that it's at the lower end of the price and ABV spectrum these days, and I find this a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. I particularly enjoyed this one after dinner, so perhaps a very good digestif?"
"O: This is a beer I expected to drink like a heavier Autumn brew, but had some thinner properties that made it more sessionable than I expected. I like the combination of earthy malt but I was missing the stronger lingering, robust flavors of the style. A well done beer that was very easy to drink with nice flavors, but they were a bit thinned out."
"I am not familiar with this style. so have to review this mainly based on how it tastes to me. It does remind me a bit of a wheat beer, has that bread like smell and taste I associate with that style. It's really not a bad beer, but not one that made me stand up and take notice either."
"Trying a Domaine Dupage from Two Bros....Little dissappointed that my beer has floaters in it...not a fan of floaters!!! The color is rich amber with creamy off white head....floaters are white! The smell is malty yet sweet. This is a very light bodied beer that has good flavor. The sweetness helps to carry the beer across the pallet. The mouthfeel is fine and it would probably go great with many different food pairings."
"Overall: I like 2Bros; I really do. But this beer is just no good. Most of their regulars/seasonal are appropriate and faithful representations of their respective styles, but Domaine Dupage is just poor. It is unbalanced, harsh, and tough to finish. Grab a C&E or Resistance if you want to see 2Bros at their finest. This is them at their weakest."
"(D)- Not bad. A nice rustic feel to it with an overall smooth body."
"Not only will i have this again, but i will go through their line after this and their fine dortmunder as well. Seems like they are thinking outside of the box and doing a good job at it."
"Overall not a great beer. If I had bought a 6 pack I'd probably drain pour it. One drink is enough for me. The sour/bitterness just kills it for me. I might be open to trying again, but not for a while."
"OVERALL: You don’t see a Biere de Garde every day, especially from an American brewer, but Two Brothers, as usual, did something a little unusual with this brew and it works very well. It is slightly on the sweet side for me these days, and I’m not sure I could knock down more than a couple in one sitting because of that, but to have one or two is certainly a treat."
"O -- This beer is a nice departure from the different Ales and Lagers available. Very complex in character, yet not so much happening that it's distracting. The light sour character could be a bit surprising to craft beer novices, but the malt backbone balances the flavors well."
"Poured this French Country Ale into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. This is the first time I have tried this style. The beer poured a clear, slightly amber straw color. It produced a nice white head and had average lacing. The aroma of the beer was sweet, smelled of fresh baked bread and had a hint of spice that I can't put my finger on. The aroma was wonderful. One of the best smelling beers that I have ever had. The taste was malty, a little bready, slightly dry and had notes of raisins and pear. There was some bitterness from hops that melded with the other flavors. Very complex beer. Awesome, I will be looking for this again. In fact a road trip might be in order."
"O: A fair introduction to an uncommon style. I don’t think this will ever become one of my favorite types of beer, but who knows? I can certainly say that this one grew on me from first sip to last; who’s to say what change a few years might bring to my palate? I’ll keep my eyes open for beers of a similar style, to see what I end up deciding. Such is the adventure that is craft beer!"
"Hmm, Biere de Garde makes sense with the esters I was smelling. This was a unique beer as it really showcased the caramel in the malt and is not a beer for someone that is not a fan of caramel. I can only imagine how long of a brewday it takes for that much caramelization to occur."
"Thanks to DavidEddie for the awesome extra. A delicious surprise. I will seek this out again and look for others from this brewery."
" ~ This is a brew of which I had a second bottle. I'm thinking this is something I would recommend but simple as something with a chicken or pasta dish. Not as a beer to sit and enjoy in sucession."
"O: It's light, has a pleasant flavor, and is easy drinking, but it isn't that memorable. A good beer, but nothing more than that (not that it aims to be, nothing wrong with that). This would definitely hit the spot on a warm day when I just want something light and refreshing to go with a nice rustic pizza, pork sandwich, sausage pasta, etc."
"Mouthfeel is fine, nothing objectionable at all. It's not outstanding, but good. Overall, it's not a bad deal and I like to support local breweries, but I can't recommend it unfortunately."
"Overall: Great beer. This is a nice one to always have a 6 pack around the house because I find women and men who are not fans of hoppy or very strong beers like it."
"Flavor seems to be to style but not really enjoyable. Aroma is lacking any sort of hoppiness. Overall not a fan of this beer although it still gets style points."
"4.5"
"D. Not to astringent. Very nice balance to it. Well done all around."
"I found this beer to be very dull. Not much flavor to it at all. Disappointed in it, and do not plan on drinking it again, unless someone can convince me it's a lot better than this bottle I had. Thinking maybe I was drinking it too cold, I let it warm up. But then it tasted worse (stronger, but more unpleasant, flavors). Down the drain it goes."
"O - Great drinkability. Good beer. Nothing special about it. It has a good taste for a good price. I'd buy it again."
"Overall, I liked this beer a great deal. I had no idea what to expect in terms of style and I ended up liking it. I wish the nose had been a bit more potent but other than that, Two Brothers has a nice little gem on their hands here."
"O: A slightly spicy, easy to drink ale. Would be a good session ale for a fall night."
"Tap: Poured a hazy medium beige color ale with nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of lightly aromatic Belgian style malt with light rustic ester. Taste is also dominated by semi-sweet Belgian-style malt with light rustic notes. Body is quite full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Enjoyable but nothing to write home about."
"Overall: An interesting beer, nice for the warmer spring and summer as I believe the nice body fruity aspects would make a wonderfully tasty balanced beers;s Finish is a little off for me --comes across a little caustic in the back of the mouth."
"Drinkability is good, this is a well executed, clean BdG, with the classic notes to satisfy."
"D -- Very nice. As this is what I think is my first biere-de-garde, I will consider it a style to look for and will definitely revisit this after trying a few others. Solid brew."
"THe aroma was rich and spicy. Lots of yeast present here, but at the same time very sweet with hardly atouch of alcohol. Rich caramel malty notes prevelant throught, really making a difference here, The flavor was very smooth with a rich sweet character coming through and balanced well against a dark fruity yeast character. Nice notes of pums and raisins throughout this one, really offering quite a bit of depth here. As it warmed a bit of spicy rum like flavor cae out with a touch of peppery like alcohol, but very nicely done. Very smooth texture and very highly carbonated, this as definitly a good choice here. It was highly drinkable and made an excellent sipper that was for sure."
"D-After finishing 1-the end note of hops and alcohol bite limit the drinkability a bit for me."
"D - Pretty decent. I wonder what this would be like with food for two reasons: 1) the rubber-rubbing after-feel might disappear with a meal, and 2) the taste might seem even weaker than it does here (and I haven't eaten for about three hours). At 5.9%, it could be a good one with which to begin an evening of moderate debauchery (as opposed to heavy or even wild debauchery, obviously). I would buy it again, but only after its next release to see how it changes."
"Not a beer style ventured into by many American brewers. A crisp-looking ale, clear brassy color with a tight, tiny-bubbled lacing. Candied fruit, white chocolate, shortbread, mild spice and wildflowers blow all expectations out of the water ... a godly aroma. Dried malt character blankets the palate, a bit biscuity but more of a dried grass flavor. Fruitiness abounds with hints of pear cider, baked apples and golden raisins, with a hint of alcohol within. Bubblegum? Herbal hop flavor and a small measure of bitterness checks any sweetness that may have lingered. Super tasty, hunt this beer down and get a semi-stinky cheese to throw it at."
" Very drinkable, excellent for summertime"
"Even though ""amber"" can be such an all encompassing term, and I am not sure if this beer falls into this catagory, this is what I expect an ""amber"" to be. Most amber ales leave me disapointed, but this one, no way! Try it."
"I really enjoy the malt character and the mouthfeel. Again, very easy to drink and a nice beer overall."
"It almost seems flat, it's so smooth with an exceptionally clean finish and hardly any bite or aftertaste. I had to knock it down a little since the carbonation in a biere de garde is supposed to be higher. The bitterness is really low and their label does list the IBUs as 24. About the label...putting brown print on a tan background with a tiny font may result in a class action lawsuit for excessive eye strain. Who reads that stuff? Us beer geeks! That's who! This is even harder to read than the novels that Greg from Stone writes on his bottles."
"Drinkability: good session beer, excellent for your friends that really are just getting into craft beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkablity - A very drinkable Biere de Garde. Light to medium bodied. A slight ethanol taste is present as I continue to drink. One of my favorite Biere de Gards I've had."
"Drinkability is high on this one due to a very crisp, refreshing taste and low alcohol content"
"D - Goes down easy due to mild flavors. Will have to try again. First time for this style."
"Note: at times it reminded me of a Amber/Vienne Lager"
"Drunkability: Really wouldn't want to drink this beer unless I was eating a meal. The taste alone isn't desirable but the toasted malts would really complement a diverse range of foods."
"The drinkability looses points for the excess bitterness but otherwise is very good."
"The taste is a mix of incredibly unique and boringly standard, the standard is the basic ale taste, but the unique is it has a long lasting chocolate and blueberry note. But the mouth feel is wonderful, and its flavor is quite intriguing to the point that it is wonderfully drinkable."
"D: This is an exceptional all-season beer, and I will definitely seek it out again."
"I really enjoyed this beer; the malt character is dominant but the sweetness is not overpowering; taste is complex. I could only do a couple at once but I would enjoy every sip. Loved it!"
"d - I thought this was a pretty good beer. The smell improved a lot as it warmed up and I enjoyed the caramel and toasted malts in the taste. Would certainly have again."
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable, this would be the type of beer that would grow on me upon further consumption. AT 5.9%, it is not unreasonable to have a few."
"D - Decent session experience. Worth another try."
"Overall: It is enough to make me seek out this brewery's beers a little more now. I am a Illinois native so that should not be to hard of a task. Next up will be heavy handed."
"."
"D- This beer might have been a little off and I will review it when I get another bottle. For now this beer is a horrible drinker and I think they did not hit the style at all. Oh well some people might like this but not me."
"D- This is damn drinkable, a real beautiful subtle beer."
"Edit 3-24-2012: Tried this again and ws not as impressed as in 2011. It was still good but didn't make as big an impression as last time. Not sure if this is due to variability in the brewing or an artifact of the style - biere du gardes have been quite variable in my experience."
"D- It's a really easy beer to drink and to start the night off."
"Pours dark amber- dark for the style, but with a fine white head that sticks around for awhile and leaves some nice lacing. Smells a bit grainy, like brown bread with some earthy hops and some brown sugar glazed pears. The taste is very nice- quite balanced with some slightly sweet grainy malt, some notes of banana and pear, and some more earthy hops as well as a touch of brandied citron on the end that intermingles nicely with the long somewhat bitter earthiness. Very smooth and silky in the mouth, with just a touch of tartness. A very nice beer- can't believe its taken me this long to try it."
"My all time favorite beer. On tap (at the Two Brothers Brewery) or out of the bottle this is a smooth well finished beer. Great taste and drinkable all year, Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall this is a great year round beer. I would recommend that you visit the Two Brothers Brewery and have the Tap House Burger. It's a great burger with roasted fresh Jalapenos peppers folded into 1/2 pound of awesome beef. It's the best way to spend an afternoon on a cold winter day in Chicago."
"Revisited 5-10-2014"
"This French style country ale pours a medium brown with a long lasting head on it. There is a decent scent of malts to it. Upon drinking it has a semi-heavy taste of roasted malts with a slight hint of honey and spices. An interesting beer to come out of Illinois."
"D- This one must not be for me. I thought it was pretty odd and just hard for me to drink. Good luck."
"Pretty decent drinkability, but the sweetness could get cloying after 1 for me."
"Came in expecting one thing and got another. Oh well, I'm not gonna argue too much. Whatever you call it, it pours a hazy ruby-amber topped by nearly a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mandarin oranges and brown toffee. Nothing more, nothing less. The taste holds notes of cedar, light toffee, greens, cloves, oranges, and mild butter. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a nice brew, nothing truly special, but pretty tasty regardless."
"D - A good beer with good qualities. Nothing outstanding, but a good staple for this style."
"This beer is served a cloudy reddish orange with an off white foam on the surface. The smell is perhaps a sour oak that compliments the hop and malt characters. The taste is a mirror of the smell with the addition of some oranges and a grassy or almost onion like taste. This beer is slightly bitter on the palate, but that doesn't really hinder the drinkability of the beer. It is a solid beer."
"Drinkability: A great beer in both flavor and style."
"The beer pours a coppery amber color. Has some yeast floating in it. The head on this beer is a frothy white color. The aroma smells of bread, biscuits, and malt. The taste is of caramel, baking bread, and biscuits. The lingering taste is of biscuits. The hops arent really noticeable, but there is a hint of noble hops. The mouthfeel is in between light and medium. Not as thick as a brown ale. With this being a malty sweet beer, it is very drinkable."
"I had a draft of this at Rattle and Hum in Manhattan's mid town. It was among the many beers I hadn't tried. A very pleasant but not outstanding beer. Very light in color with a great and brisk head. Aroma is yeasty, as it should be and the flavor is very refreshing and an easy drink at 5.9 percent alcohol by volume."
"Each mouthful starts out very promising with some golden malty sweetness but ends in a stew of funky flavors, hinting at musty and metallic. Very interesting and worth a try, but a pint would be too much of a good thing."
"Rich, thick mouthfeel: an accomplishment in a session-able 5.9% alcohol. Nicely done and well-balanced."
"Pours an amber color with a bit of an off white head. The nose brings yeast, caramel, bread, and a bit of light fruits. The taste adds in a bit of spice and follows through with some light fruits. Quite a few flavors come through but everything is quite mild. Light with good carbonation, this drinks quite well and is a nice example of a sessionable version of the style."
"pours a hazy amber/orange color with a nice 1 finger head,sticky clingy lacing on side of glass..smell is fruit and yeast with some currant fruit some funk/slight sour..taste was the same its fruits apples pears some slight prune/plum notes with a sourbread malt finish not alot of hops..mouth feel was creamy with fruit and spice well carbonated very tasty highly drinkable..2brithers from IL makes some nice brews ..recommended"
"D - Other than the harsh and unpleasant carbonation this is reasonably drinkable. Doubt I'd ever buy it again but it's not a bad beer."
"Drinkability: We both agreed this was very drinkable and enjoyable, I wish I had both more bottles and larger bottles. Perhaps it was just having a nice break from the other monsters we opened."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly fruity, and semi-dry in the swallow."
"I'm a huge fan of this style, and this example doesn't disappoint."
"In conclusion, I like all kinds of beers, but this one is not too light or too heavy. It is good on it's own or with any meal. I enjoyed it very much."
"This was one of my early introductions to good beer. Drove about an hour and a half to the brewery from my college to get a pencil keg of Domain DuPage."
"D: This is an okay beer with moments of greatness but it ultimately falls a bit short because of the simplicity and lack of a certain funk that I am accustomed to in my Bier de Gardes"
"The key word here is complex."
"This is a good beer. Very malty in general"
"Well aged beers like the Garde/Mars Ales should have a level of depth, complexity, and maturity that is lacking from this sugar-tooth of a beer. I appreciate the character of the sweetness that focuses on the whisping powdered sugar impressions but this level of intensity and lack of balance or depth, it's tough to celebrate."
"I can't help but close my eyes and see visions of musty cellars, crumbling corks and dusty bottles, stone bridges, a log on the fire, strong cheeses, the sounds of an accordion, a poetic language, warm scarves and the inexplicable desire to make love. If it can instill all that it stands to reason Domaine DuPage is one of the strongest examples of the Biere de Garde style commercially available. Thanks Sam for the beer (and vacation)!"
"Overall, it's a good biere de garde that I recommend if you like the style. Not available here in TX so shipped back from my Indy trip. Rotation - I enjoyed it but really didn't make me yearn for another so good with one unless I could easily get another or try it on-tap. [N;O]"
"D: Good. Balanced, and easy to drink. I'd like to explore this genre of beer a bit more!"
"Conclusion: This came highly recommended from a friend who generally knows her beers, and by several people here on BA. I dunno, maybe I don't ""get"" the style, but I LOVED Schlafly's Biere de Garde and thought that the oddball that is Jenlain Noel was pretty tasty as well. Maybe this one's just not for me..."
"D - Very smooth with excellent balance, clean flavors and easy on the palate. If I find myself traveling West, I would certainly pick some up."
"Thanks Nate!"
"O: A little disappointed with this selection."
"Overall a tasty and easy to drink country ale."
"Overall nothing real special. Drinkable but not memorable."
"D - liked it, to me this style is all over the place but it grew on me after a few sips. good strong toasty tastes and a certain wildness to it."
"Quite spicy in taste. Malty, caramel. Not much hop. Not bad. Crisp on taste but also a post caramel creaminess."
"Moderate carbonation prickles the tongue. The beer leaves an ever so slight aftertaste, not cloying but pleasing. This is one very drinkable beer."
"D: A unique but tasty beer. This is refreshing and well made and it has given the perception of a sweet beer at first then comes off bitter, dry and clean. I would easily drink another!"
"D= This is actually a really decent brew. Worth every penny I spent on it. Biere de Garde? Woulda never guessed since that style seems to be a crap shoot. Whatever you concider this it's good."
"Poured into a tulp glass. Was a dark amber color with a white head that laced away. Aroma was of malt, cane sugar and oak. Not heavily carbonated. Flavors included light amounts of Saaz hops, coriander, and malt; slightly bitter, and a light sweetness."
"Notes: This is a great beer for people who like wine. I had shared a bottle of this with my mom, who drinks mostly wine, and had never ventured into the vast craft beer style world. . . and after this one she was interested in trying other styles, and we did."
"D: Fairly easy to drink but the mustiness was not what i was in the mood for right now"
"D - very balanced and easy to get along with, but remains interesting throughout. Will definitely buy again."
"Lots of character to Domaine DuPage. A pleasure to drink and an incentive to explore other Biere de Garde offerings."
"Overall: This is a crazy good beer. Would definitely drink more of this. Very rough yet refined. Great!"
"A hard pour into a standard pint glass produced a half inch off-white head that faded into a ring pretty quickly. Appearance: Redish orange and a little hazy. Not much aroma at first, but after warming up it has a nice sweet malty nose with a little butterscotch or caramel. Taste reflects the smell with the addition of a fairly prominent alcohol taste and some slight hop bitterness at the end. Very tasty. I would say not complex at all, but that's no slam. As others have said, it has a creamy mouthfeel that complements the flavor. The sweetness may wear on some, but I like some sweet beers and this one is pretty drinkable. I also love the fact that for me this is a local beer."
"D: It was rather drinkable, but if I have this again I would probably pair it with food. The beer becomes a bit more drinkable as it warms up."
"A very enjoyable beer. There's nothing about it that says excellence, but is definitely above average to good in all areas."
"Not bad at all. Enjoyable, but not a lot going on. Just a simple sweetness dominates. Worth a try."
"Altogether pretty nice -- while not the most complex farmhouse ale, what was there was very enjoyable. If given the opportunity, I'd probably go for another one."
"Drinkability is nice, very tasty and enjoyable. The alcohol comes through fairly noticeably for the abv, which is distracting, but doesn't get in the way too, too much. Overall, a very tasty beer."
"D - This beer has an understated complexity to it that makes it especially interesting, and tasty! This is the first brew I've had from Two Brothers, and now I want to try more. Very impressed!"
"For sure not a beer you need to seek out. In fact there are probably others you have access to that are much better that I would drink over this. Not bad. Just bland."
"Overall a pretty delicious beer. Certainly a unique style I haven't had much of. Balanced and complex."
"D: Very good drinkabilty. I've heard good things about this and they were wright! I'm glad I finally picked it up and gave it a try. I would recommend this beer!"
"Drinkability - This was a really fun beer to drink. Dark fruits, caramel malts, yeasty funk, it's really reminiscent of Belgian ales with a much higher abv. I don't mind malty beers, but I found it a little unbalanced in that you really don't detect much hop presence until the finish. I would say true hop-heads need not apply, but otherwise check it out."
"M- Lightish body with prickly carbonation."
"D= This beer is one of those that is night-and-day better when its fresh and on-tap. I have had some bottles that just didn't do it for me, but this bar serves this beer super fresh and its delicious."
"Drinkability: Not really true to the style the best that I can tell, but willing to try again as it was a decent brew."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's a fairly solid beer overall but there are better beers in the style that I would select before this one."
"D/O- Wants to be a 5-6 session beer more than I wanted it to. Hate to say 'forgettable' about any craft brew but I was let down with this offering."
"d- not the best beer I have ever had but something I can stomach. Very easy to drink. If someone is not into craft beers then I would reccomend this."
"D: this is a solid beer from Two Bros. Nice complex taste profile with nice flavor and great balance."
"Great garnet-brown color, with a thin lacing in the glass. Fast dying head after a couple sips. The flavor is bit too much maple/diacetyl for my taste at first, but I'm not too familiar with this style of beer. Very rich tasting, spicy and buttery flavors going down with a malty grain/brown sugar feeling in the aftertaste. Hops are noticeable but drowned out by the syrup on the tongue. Not sure I'd rush out for more of this brew. This is a unique beer that I might have to develop a taste for compared to what I usually drink. ABV is on the high side and the alcohol is up front. Powerful stuff. Good for a slightly heavier beer if you like a real punch and aren't put off by a sugary sweetness."
"Domaine DuPage is another Two Brothers offering I've passed up for no good reason. This was excellent, and my wife, no huge fan of beer, enjoyed the heck out of this at The Crane Alley's beer and chocolate pairing with me tonight. I did, too. Excellent beer, well paired with a toffee/caramel truffle. Very well done, Two Brothers."
"Nice yeasty and malt flavors with a tart follow up. I was unsure of this on first pour but its drinkability and balance has won me over."
"D: High marks here. I believe the balance between what could be considered too much sweetness and not enough hops suits me well. It's easy to drink, very flavorful and the ABV isn't too high to where you couldn't perhaps session with this."
"Because this is such a sweet brew I would only drink one or two of these per session, but would definitley consider returning to for one on a consistent basis."
"Fairly good, 1-2 would be the max, not really a session beer due to the sweetness and fruity esters."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Notes: This was my first Biere de Garde and was not at all what I was expecting. I was assuming it would be a lighter wheat beer, along the lines of a saison. I'd say I'm neither disappointed, nor pleased. I'm mostly just intrigued, with this specific beer, and the style. I'll probably try this again at some point and might seek out another Biere de Garde to compare, even though this beer didn't blow me away."
"It's not something I would get too excited about in the future but I can appreciate its quality and can understand why someone else might love it."
"How weird best by 12/10/09 never had that happen before. Appears a slightly hazed amber hue with a nice creamy tawny off white head, leaves behind ample lacing with each sip fine scattered layers at that. Aroma has a nice vinous herbal flow to it with a touch of citrus hops but dominant bread like caramel roasted malts are the highlight of the nose. Flavor really hits with the sweetness upfront with caramel malt some heavy grainy Wheaties like flavors with semi bitter finish with some citrusand herbal hops carrying through in the finish. I get a nice fruity refreshing quality the whole time with a dry yeast and mild spiced finish. A really nice sessionable ale that packs massive layers of flavor, mouthfeel overall is smooth carbonation is moderate and natural body pulls off at least a medium ranking without overdoing any one area very balanced. Drinkability is sound in all regards I wish these guys would be more readily available for me, this Domaine DuPage was like a nice piece of crusted bread buttered perfectly with herbs sprinkled on top it was simplistic and perfect for the experience it's trying to pull off."
"Poured golden copper into a snifter, with very little off-white head and no lacing. The smell was a little subdued for what I've grown accustomed to with this style; subtle earthiness, leather, and some spices (coriander?) and maltiness. The taste was a watered-down version of the smell, with even less coriander than before. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side too. This beer needs a little work."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet, had a nice copper color. Smells of bready, fruity sweetness. Carries a malty, yet balanced taste. Very easy to drink. Not too familiar with the style, but it definitely could be a nice session beer."
"Notes: Rather forgettable Bier de Garde in my opinion, a style that does not inspire too much in me."
"Easy drinker, good for all year round drinking, the sweetness lends it as a good drinker with savory dinners. Yes, a nice one for this style."
"Notes - Feels very much like an old beer style. Good medium to heavy mouthfeel with good carbonation. However this doesn't seem to be the same beer I remember from before (reviewed on tap). I still have five more to go to figure it out but three of those are reserved for the cellar."
"D - Solid. This is a good beer that will definitely make it into my rotation. I could drink several in a sitting."
"Damn tasty and damn drinkable. Goes down really well. I will have this again and know some friends who will love this as well despite not being huge craft drinkers. Nice beer that is easily available and nicely priced."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Smooth to drink - goes down easy. ABV is manageable. Flavors are not overwhelming. Not filling."
"D-Comfortable taste quenches my thirst and makes me thirsty for more."
"D - Easily drinkable, but I'm not huge on the taste."
"I liked this beer although it was a too sweet for my usual tastes..."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. It's like a lower ABV Belgian dubbel. I will definitely order this one on tap again if it's available."
"Amber colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is caramel malts and bread.Taste is malty,caramel and biscuit.Smooth and refreshing with lots of flavor.Seems to be worthy of any outing or occasion.I would recommend and purchase again.Good job by two brothers brewing."
"Kind of reminds me of a cross between a belgian dubbel and a wee heavy. Delicious."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer as I had no idea what to expect. Unique and had me coming back for more. I'm going to look for this at my local store. Try one."
"Subtle and interesting. This is a style that I haven't had the opportunity to encounter very often. This beer is very flavorful and balanced resulting in a great drinkability as a session brew."
"Solid atmosphere. Appearance is pretty good, but unspectacular; and basic but full nose. Really nice flavor, great balance of bitter and sweet all on a light malt base. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Very tasty brew, however, I couldn't drink many of these. It's very mood and food specific."
"Reddish brown pour with very minimal white head. Smells of grapes and oak. Taste is malty and nutty, almost like a brown ale without the body. Pretty refreshing. An aftertaste similar to grape rinds. Medium body with mild carbonation. Drinks nice, goes down good."
"Drinks great, the body is a little thicker than I'd expect, but it's smooth."
"d: Very interesting overall, I liked this quite a bit. Never had anything else quite like it."
"Reviewed on 07/31/2009. On tap at Blind Tiger. This beer pours a deep red with no head. Aroma of sweet malt, very indistinct though. Flavor of sweet caramel malt and apple skins. This is a decent beer, very drinkable, but it is not really complex at all."
"Drinkability: Really nice and able to cut through some of the heavier foods. It maintains complexity through and overall a great pick."
"D - high. this isn't a one-and-done."
"I poured my ""French Style Country Ale"" into my beer tasting wine glass. I gave it a fairly vigorous pour but did not get much head. Its a slightly cloudy amber, nice color. The nose is malty, a bit of apple. The taste is sweet malt with enough hop bite to give it legs. I detect a bit of flowery flavors and dare I say bubble gum?The mouth feel is sticky enough that it may discourage you from drinking it in the sun, but feels appropriate for shoulder seasons. I purchase a six pack of this beer on occasion, not a standby for me, but one I will continue to revisit. It offers a nice counter point to the stout and ipa that seem to take residence in my fridge."
"This one's a pretty nice brew and was helpful in easing me into an unfamiliar style."
"D - pretty decent drinkability. It is a decent tasting ale, and it is true to the biere de garde description. I will probably purchase something else from this brewery next time I choose Two Brothers."
"D: This is a nice beer. It goes down easily, yet possesses a lot of complexities to ponder. The only detracting factor for me was the out of place citrus flavors. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"D- Definitely not my favorite offering from Two Bros., but still a good brew...even with that said, I would not hesitate to recommend this one..."
"D- easy to finish and something i like to have a bunch of from time to time. probably my go to beer from two brothers, and the first beer i ever tried form them."
"However, I only faintly tasted molasses. Regardless, it is a very drinkable beer, mellowing out as I got through it, and I must say drinking it put me in a better mood (childhood memories, I guess). I think I may have another and go sit out on the back deck -- cheers!"
"drinkability is good. very mellow and easygoing brew with fresh hops notes and a very drinkable profile. cheers!"
"The aroma is light fruity apricots but thats about it. Taste is a lot of yeasty and white wine characters. Just weird, confusing and not very good."
"D - This is a great biere de garde and its is very easy drinking."
"Overall, this beer was unique. Some good parts, some not so good. My bottle is going slow, but I don't mind it. I don't know how much more I'd want though."
"This beer poured a light cloudy copper with a huge head. The smell is mostly sweet malt with a bit of fruitiness. The taste reminds me of a beer mixed with a cider, some sweet malt up front that gives way to a dry apple finish. The mouthfeel is pleasant with a certain dryness and plenty of carbonation. No problems with drinkability on this beer, I'd go so far as to say it might be a good starter beer for people who don't know they like beer yet."
"One of the joys of Cougars games is the Two Brothers taps right behind my seats."
"Drinkability: In looking at the guidelines, this one meets the style fairly well. I am not sure if I would have another one, but I can see this being sessionable for someone who likes the style."
"Mouthfeel really shines in this one. Taste might be on the mild side, but Domain DuPage remains a satisfying beer."
"Drinkability: Great. I like this beer alot. It is certainly a sessionable brew that has a multitude of strengths. Worth seeking out."
"drinkability is good and a lower abv belgian i will be drinking more of"
"Thanks to a friend for sharing a case. Styles aside, this is was an interesting Belgian amber. Very subtle and drinkable. There's a not unusual, but uncommon, smooth cherry caramel taste that finishes with a gentle Belgian spice. No, it's not a big robust Belgian, but it's certainly a decent session beer and good rival to Fat Tire."
"D: Mildly drinkable. The unusual aftertaste and sticky viscous mouthfeel invite guzzling."
"not very drinkable. it is decent enough, as it the first beer I have had of this style...but the sourness and over fizzy with no decent returns...I cannot endorse this one."
"Kudos Two Bros!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Maredsous chalice. This ale appears a mildly cloudy, light chestnut color with about a finger of lively off white foam. Aroma and flavor are of sweet malts, white sugar, nicely toasted grains, fruity, apples, and bread. Medium to moderate carbonation, with a crisp, dry finish. Nice and quenching. Tasty stuff."
"Also my first beer from two brothers, this is a quality beer that I would definitely drink again."
"D - I've been sitting on this for a while for some reason, but I was pleasantly surprised with this Two Brothers offering. Very interesting, flavorful style with a pretty light, crisp body and lots of subtle complexities all working together to create an extremely drinkable beer."
"Despite that, however, this beer is still somewhat drinkable and I suspect it works much better on a hot summer day."
"M/D - kind of bland tasting, not as flavorful as I was hoping for. I probably won't pick up another"
"D - The rich malt character is the defining characteristic of this beer. Nothing overly complex, but that is par for the style. The relative dryness of the finish helps with drinkability, but the malt could become a bit cloying if this were more than a 12oz bottle. A nice example of an unusual style."
"This is going to be a great year-round ale, but I'm looking forward to pairing it with summer foods: vegetables and balsamic-marinated chicken on the grill, corn cobs with butter and salt, the occasional burrito with sweet potato mash instead of rice."
"Overall I like it and would purchase another sixer."
"D: I'm surprised this is only a 6% beer. Seemed to have a bit more alcoholic character to it. Paired with a burger or nice sandwich, this was an excellent beer. I found it to malty sweet, but this may be good on hot summer day."
"D- Not for me. Other ales that came in the variety case were all much better."
"frankly, i'm surprised that so many actual french attempts at their own indigenous style can't seem to match this american version's superior balance of complexity and drinkability."
"Overall: Mouthfeel was nothing special but well carbonated and enjoyable. Very drinkable, I'm no expert on the style but I found it very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A very interesting beer that is refreshingly drinkable; really like the balance"
"D: good drinkability. Certainly enjoyed this beer and could see easily pairing well with a number of different foods. Would purchase again and would like to try on tap. I expected this beer to be ""on lees," but it is crystal clear and not overly yeasty by any means."
"D - I really love this beer for the simplicity, drinkability and flavor, but it is easy to drink mostly and I don't really notice 5.9% you could have fooled me if you said it was 6%. I would definitely order this if I saw it on draft"
"D: Very nice, not sure if it is something I could do everyday, but overall very pleasant indeed."
"Decent drinability."
"""Refreshing"" is the key word here. Interesting flavors and superb construction lend to its sublime mouthfeel and quaffability. At first taste, this one came off as a hybrid of several styles, but as time passed I realized that it was superb when judged by its own merits. An interesting venture from Two Brothers. I'm eager to see other American brewers tackle this style."
"I hesitate to say this was a bad beer, because it definitely wasn't. In fact, the more I think about it the more understated its qualities actually were, which maybe makes it a better drink. However there are just other bières de garde that I'd rather have."
"oh yeah...the bottle had a ""Best By"" date of 3 weeks before I drank it. Didn't really seem ""off"" tasting to me, though."
"Poured into a goblet a very nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, very nice foamy one-finger plus off-white head, with some nice small islands/sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with very slight yeast, pears, slight spice. The taste is very sweet, malty, some yeast notes, pears, some spicyness. Medium body, there's a syrupy texture to this brew. Drinkable, not a bad brew at all, thanks Brian."
"Overall: Two Brothers has been slightly hit or miss for me, but when they hit they HIT. That's probably why I keep trying their stuff. Give this beer a shot, see what you think."
"Poured in to a snifter. Color is a nice clear, burnt orange color with a small light tan head. Small retention rate with fair amount of lacing. Nice fall fruit aroma, pears and apples mostly. Very earthy hop notes. Good flavors, very earthy note. Some fall fruits and some nice earthy tones from the hops. Very classic flavors for a biere de garde. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp. The hops really keep this one together. Medium bodied, and the 5.6% ABV makes this a very nice and drinkable brew."
"Two Brothers is a reliable Illinois brewery that seems to really succeed with hops. Domaine DuPage, a French-style country ale, is a more malt based offering. Flat copper color, quickly fading toasted marshmallow head. Aroma is vaguely fruity, at times strawberry and at times grape. Nice bitterness in sip, followed by malty caress in mouthfeel. Smooth."
"D-Highly drinkable and pleasant. This beer is simple yet unique, and if I had a few more bottles I'd like to test it's sessionability."
"I give it a high rating because this is a great session beer and a great beer for BMC drinkers. I wouldn't consider this a great beer for savoring or appreciating the complexity. Get this if you want to have a couple, maybe to side up a steak. I would bring some of this to a party where the majority of people didn't explore much into their beer."
"Pours a clear golden-brown, with a creamy off-white cap. The nose is rather subtle with yeast and slightly toasted malt come out alongside hints of apple and pear. A very crisp balanced finish. It says on the palate then slowly dissipates. Thanks Heritage Liquor!"
"Bottle enjoyed at Winking Lizard. Medium yellow with a soapy head and some lace. Above average carbonation that makes it hard on the mouthfeel. Aroma is soapy and mild spice. Drying finish. Its the style, though not the best example of the style. Good drinkability."
"Drinkability is decent with this beer, but I probably will not seek it out in the future."
"this beer pours a hazy orangish copper with a thin white head that recedes to a ring of lace. the nose presents a lot of esters reminding me of apples and raisins, there's also a lot of malt in the nose. I think it's a nice aroma, but I'm not sure that it fits with the style guidelines. the taste follows with a lot of sweet maltiness and fruit at the front and a rather dry finish, the hops aren't very evident in this beer. the mouthfeel is a nice medium body with ample carbonation. a very drinkable and tasty beer."
"The beer pours a hazy deep copper color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a toasted, nutty scent with just the right amount of funk. The taste is decent. It has a nutty, bisquity, flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a bit of yeast fruitiness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. I'm not a huge drinker of the style, but it seems to fit within the guidelines."
"Bubbly, fizzy, effervescent. Appropriate for style. Thick as well. Two thirds caramel, one third champagne. Impressive as hell."
"Definitely drink this one a little colder than recommended, has some harsh flavors that conflict with one another as it warms. Interesting, though... had no trouble finishing the six pack."
"This beer pours a light amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of toffee, caramel, floral hops, and lots more malt. The taste is just as malty with nice floral undertones. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer, that I could drink again."
"D - Fairly high, I could easily get through a few pints of this."
"D- This is an interesting beer. It wasn't terribly complex, and it's just a touch sweet for sessioning. I would probably drink again though."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin and the lack of carbonation seems to enhance the sweetness, but I felt this brew could have been improved with a more Belgian styled bottle conditioning although the brewery probably wasn't going for anything like that. An enjoyable beer, but not one you would likely have several in a sitting. Unique and worth a try, but this will not become a staple in my fridge."
"Tried this Biere de Garde, other than being an ugly looking beer it is a solid offering. Nice mix of flavors, kind of reminds me of a less earthy dubbel. Worth a try."
"This is a decent beer in a style that I am still getting acquainted to. Appearance is some what bland, no head and a bit of lacing on the sides. Smell is decent, sweet like sugar with a bit of maltiness and spice. Taste is quite similar, but the balance isn't quite there, something is just a bit off. Mouthfeel is creamy and ok to drink."
"Texture is very smooth to the point of creamy. Highly drinkable and overall quite delicious! I would pair this with the sweeter group of traditional fall flavors (pumpkin, apples, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.)"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a golden-copper color with a thin, soapy head. The smell is slightly sweet; a mix of toasty malt and earthy hops. The flavor is more subdued than I had expected, slightly sweet but well balanced. It has a gentle crystal flavor that is not at all cloying and finishes rather neutral. The mouthfeel is light with a viscous carbonation and a smooth finish. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer and one of the better ones I've had by TBBC."
"Pours a dark bronze with little head and even less lacing. A very crisp and solid ale with a fair amount of caramel malt that finishes refreshingly dry. A very solid ale from Two Brothers. I would recommend trying it out if you're looking for something solid that won't blow your socks off but is sure to satisfy."
"A perfect beer to have one or two of but not at all a session beer."
"A bit strong perhaps, to call it a session beer, but I definitely find it easy to overindulge in this beer without the flavors become tiresomeness."
"Overall- Improves as it warms up. Pretty decent, worth a try!"
"Domaine DuPage poured a dark amber color, with very little head. Smell was strong of sweet malty flavor. Taste was sweet, malty, hints of fruit. Faint hoppy citrus after taste. Mouthfeel was good, good carbonation. Drinkability was also nice. This was an interesting beer. I enjoyed it a good deal and I am interested in exploring more of this style."
"Interesting dichotomy here. The aroma is wonderful: very rich and aromatic. Lots of citrus, malt and a bit of hop. Flavor isn't so hot. Kind of a jumble. Bitterness dominates and results in a long finish. Makes me wish I was in France having one of theirs. Decent enough amber color. Not much head nor lace. Like many of the other dos Bro's beer better."
"D: A good and easy drinker, one of the better offerings from Two Brothers and a good represntation of the style."
"It was not what I expected, since I never experienced a ""French Style Country Ale", brewed in Warrenville, IL. It reminded me very much of a Belgian-style brew. Definitely worth sampling."
"I had mine while having a super,spicy bowl of chili and this beer's taste and character shone right through."
"There is a bountiful earthy, sweet aroma here slightly spicy. Nice light brown pour with an amber accent, sizable head and moderate lacing. Pleasant on the palate, could be creamier. Interesting flavor, much different from the aroma in many respects. Taste is sweet with an initial hit of caramel followed by a mild hop bitterness. There is a bit of earthiness in the taste. Interesting brew, definitely enjoyable."
"Appearance is clear copper with ruby highlights. Received a disappointing ""frat pour"" otherwise known as no room left for decent foam, but it looks like an off-white head and it had decent lacing throughout. Aroma is very faint, but I'm in a typical college bar so I would be surprised if I could smell anything beyond the stale beer, ashtray and urinal cake. Anyhoo, what I could detect was some sweet malt, faint fruity esters, and some flowery noble hops. Taste is bursting with some awesome toasted malt with a slightly fruity sweetness of plum, cherry, and brown sugar. Those flowery noble hops have a moderate flavor and blend nicely with the malt but leave only a slight hop bitterness on the tongue. Medium mouthfeel is very smooth and finishes dry that makes for a very refreshing tasting experience. An excellent example of an amber style bier de garde and absolutely wonderful on tap."
"Struggled to put the light brown head on top, that disappeared almost before I stopped pouring it. Pleasant, lightly spiced nose that is somewhat promising--light peppery spice follows into the taste. A bit sweet and malty to support the spice. Good balance, but not spectacular. Warmed up fairly well, but didn't open up. Overall, not bad. I'd try on tap if I saw it, but probably not buy another bottle."
"D-Easy to drink with a pleasant mouthfeel. Quite malty with a fair amount of sweetness. This is a beer that borders on good but in the end falls a little short due to the sweetness and not enough drying characteristics. I would like a bit more of a hop kick."
"Nice. I'll have another. Well, one more. After that I need some hops."
"Mouthfeel was decent once the head went down. Smooth on the taste buds. This beer was very drinkable and interesting, but I think I wanted more from these taste. The sediment tells me there might have been an issue with this bottle. I will retry and adjust if needed."
"D_a decent but not great Bier de garde. Still worth trying. Not sure where that charcoal comes from, but it reminds me of Fat Tyre"
"Pours a pretty ruby copper color with a nice fluffy egg shell head that dissipated into a sparse cap. The aroma is of smooth caramel malt, honey, and some dark fruit. The taste is a nice rich caramel malt, brown bread, honey, a touch of grassy hops in the end. The feel is moderate with some prickly carbonation, yet it remains quite a smooth beer. It is a tad slick but the hop bitterness help counter balance that. This is a fine malty brew. A very nice caramel malt that is quite smooth. Definitely worth a purchase."
"On tap at Clark Street. Pours a medium amber with a sweet malt smell and taste. Very lightly bittered. Faintest hint of belgium yeast like influence to it, but not much. Kind of drying in the finish, but still sweet flavored. Decent but unremarkable compared to some of their other beers, I thought."
"A decent American stab at the style..."
"D - goes down fairly easy."
"I'm really digging the taste on this one. It's sweet upfront, but the toastiness and slight hops on the back-end balance it out. Very well crafted. Not a ton of carbonation in the head, but it's a beer that's meant to go down smooth. Boy does it. I'd love to knock back a couple more and at this ABV, I just might."
"Mouthfeel is thin and overcarbonated. Its a drainpour for me."
"Pours dark copper with a nearly nonexistant head. What did develope quickly disappeared. Some spotty lacing left on the glass. It has a nice toasted malt aroma with caramel hints. The taste is likewise malty. Some fruitiness is present but there is mostly a earthy, musty flavor. Seems a bit thin and carbonation seems just a step up from being flat. I really wanted to score this beer higher but looking at the individual scores, it doesn't do any of them well. It has a good flavor and low ABV that helps drinkability but I don't think there is a need to seek this beer out in the future."
"Pours a dark amber color absolutely no head. None. This also means no lacing Not sure if this is typical of the style, being my first one, but very underwhelming in appearance. Smell is super malty, bready and slightly fruity. The aroma on this thing is near perfection. Caramel goodness throughout the nose. Taste follows suit. Biscuit malts, nice caramel flavors, the slightest amount of hops in the background and very sweet to the tastebuds. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with little carbonation, but the carbonation that does pop up tingles the tongue. Alcohol is not overly-present at 5.9%. I really enjoyed this beer. I thought I had a dud by the look of the pour, but it turned out to be a really nice offering."
"Pours a deep orange amber color with less than a finger foamy off white head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of lacing generated. The smell is fresh yet earthy some harvest fruit and grainy wheat notes. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied and smooth. Full flavored the taste of caramel is balanced with a nice hop tingle. A very easy drinker and at 5.9% ABV is quite sessionable. Recommended."
"Perfectly clear copper color. Not much of a head, thin 1/4 that drops to a film quickly. Very spotty lacing. Smell is malty with some mild fruity notes. The malt has a distint toast flavor on the tongue and there are some apple flavors in there too. Enough hops to balance out what could be a too sweet brew. Medium to heavy body. I like this one. It's not earth shattering but it's something a little different and it's well done."
"Easy to drink, very refreshing. Would be nice on a nice summer evening."
"This style of beer is not my favourite; but since it is the only Two Brothers that Gemato's serves, and I should be eternally grateful for that, I have had a lot of it. Very nice warm chestnut colour, which always sports a generous head when served (usually way too cold in this place). Malty caramel aroma predominates. Pleasant on the palate, slightly sweet, malt dominates, very low hop and bitter component."
"12 ouncer, with best by dating of 7/19/08 on the rear label. Pours a warm, orangy shade of amber, slightly cloudy, lightly toasted whole wheat bread head, that leaves just a bit of scattered lacing. Spiced up nose, with hints of spearmint, pepper, and more toasty notes. Flavorful brew, more toasty/wheat flavors, fruit, smoke, and sweet malts. Well worth a try, especially for appreciators of this French/Belgian style."
"D: This is a extremely drinkable beer! Very malty with excellent balance from the hops. Very nice."
"Purchased a six pack for last weekend. Poured into tulip glasses. Smallish sized head that faded rather quickly. The color was a dark red, bordering on brown. Lots of lacing down the sides of the glass. The taste was of burnt caramel. As for the body, it was on the heavy side, and certainly had some substance to it. This is not a beer that you can drink quickly. It's a slow sipper that tastes just as good at room temp. After two, though, I felt as though I had enough. A nice beer to enjoy with food or by itself."
"Overall, it is a good local craft beer. Would be a great beer for you if you like a balance of sweet, caramel malts to go along with a mild hop flavor."
"The beer is dark reddish brown with a thin head that maintains well. The aromas are on the malty side, some caramel, just a little hops (herbal), and maybe a touch of spice (I don't know which ones). The taste is sweet and malty, earthy, and worty in general. Nice, not my favorite style, but it's good."
"can't quite get my finger on this brew. it's good but also not good. not great looking, but most of all alternating sips seem so different: this time it tastes like cough syrup, that time like toasty delicious"
"It's a beautiful spring day and this was very refreshing. I'd have it again."
"not overly heavy but still has a strong body. A beer I first had at a Leonas restaurant here in Chicago and was impressed by its ability to to hold its own with Italian food. I don't know what a French country style ale should be but this is darn good"
"Sweet malty aroma includes a hint of summer fruits - apple and pear. Quaff was a tasty treat of well balanced fruits with a nice hop finish. Also has a bit of a tart bite. Drinks easily, this would be a nice summer brew in the heat."
"I may be a little bit partial since this is a local brewer, but I found this beer very intriguing and complex considering its lightness. Well done my Brothers."
"D- easy on the taste buds and easy on the gullet, a nice smooth mellow ale with enough fruity complexities to keep it interesting."
"great tasting beer. follows style. wish i would have bought more than one. i really like what these two are doing. good for session. will drink again."
"A very tasty brew form Two Brothers amber in color and hazy with almost no head. It is my first Biere de garde and I first had it sevral years ago. Unfotunatly it didnt catch on but, The Professor's Pub, a new bar in kent, ohio now carries it and i cant pass it up when ever i stop in. It has a nutty aroma with a slight hint of aprcot. The mouthfeeel and body are good not too heavy. In the end you get a slight hop bite with bits of citrus floral notes. Quite pleasureable."
"12 ounce bottle, best by 3/7/08. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours amber with a half-inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. The beer has a sweet and slightly sour fruity aroma, it smells like caramel, apple, citrusy hops and vinegar. Tastes like apple, caramel, lemon peel, bread, bittering hops and a bit of funk. Overall the taste is a bit on the weak side. Mouthfeel/body is a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's smooth and not hard to drink. I don't recall having a beer of this style before, so I son't really have anything else to compare it to. I can't say it's one of my favorites, but it's not bad. I'll have to try this one again and similar beers in the future just to get a better grasp of it. But yeah, I'd try it again."
"Pours a clear orange brown. Nose is a strong leafy aspect. Flavor is nice and roasted. Seems a bit leafy. Lasting profile. Feel is a bit thick on the liquid and smooth on carbonation. A nice example of this style. I usually dont go for it, but I like this one."
"No freshness dating, but best if used by 3/29/2008 on label. Poured into my Harpoon IPA glass. Presented with a beautiful copper color. Fluffy white head that dissipated quickly into a thin skim; light consistent lacing throughout the session. Scent of hops (reminded me a little of MH #9). Taste was not what I expected - slightly more malt than hops, but also tasted a little skunky. Somewhat lively mouthfeel initially, but carbonation disappeared rather quickly, leaving somewhat of a flat, mellow mouthfeel; not at all crisp. Not bad, but somewhat middle of the road all and all."
"A very pleasant beer."
"D: I only drank half of the beer. It was too strong and syrupy for me. Like I said before. I'll review again, to see if I just got a bad beer."
"OK. Vinegar taste not for me. Assumed, based on name, it was a Biere de Garde. Didn't seem to fit the style, based on others I have had. I wouldn't hurry back to this one."
"Tastes great and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A fine little American-made biere de garde."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, crisp, well carbonated, and a pretty refreshing beer. I'm actually pretty impressed with this beer. It's a first encounter with the style and it's better than I expected. Overall, good beer."
"This is a fine offering. I didn't notice the usual off flavors I associate with French country ales. I'd equate it to a very good pale ale."
"Mouthfeel had a creeping zip with tiny bubbles of carbonation. Medium in body."
"D - An outstanding aroma and tasty flavors and a near perfect balance of roastiness and hoppiness make this an eminetnly drinkable brew. It's flavorful enough to hold my interest, and mellow enough to drink three or four."
"D: My first Bier de Garde review so take it with a grain of salt. Very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer - alot going on, complex. I would definitely drink this again."
"D: The ale, despite its big malt body, is reasonable alcohol-wise, creating a big tasting drink that won't lay you out."
"Beer poured a copper/amber color with a white head that is well sustained and is leaving a nice lacing behind. Nose is very pleasant, of lighter fruits and a hint of floral hops. Taste has hints of apple, pears, and finishes with a dry hop accentuated by the fruits. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and somewhat smooth. Overall drinkability is very refreshing and easy drinking. Recommended if you have access to this brew."
"D: Decent beer. Nothing crazy special but drinkable."
"It poured a dark reddish amber with a thin layer of white foam that quickly dissipated away into a few foamy white rings along the edge of the beer and a few white streaks of lace around the glass. It didn't have much of an aroma to it. All there was, was a light aroma of a few juicy fruits coated in brown sugar. That's all I got. When it warmed up, still nothing else emerged from the background of the smell. It had a light and mild taste of toasted malts, some juicy fruits, tame toasted citrus hops, and then finished off with a small dab of sweet caramel. There weren't many tastes in the taste department, but what was there made for a better than average taste. I would have to say the mouthfeel is on the light side with a soft aftertaste of toasted malts and a few juicy fruits. I wouldn't mind trying it again, but if I don't, I wouldn't be hart broken if I missed it. It was an OK beer."
"Medium body and very drinkable with a meal."
"D - Extremely drinkable, would be great for a nice session with six of these and a tasty cheese platter. Overall, one of my favorite offerings from Two Brothers."
"Overall, I really liked this beer, had a great balance with some flavors thrown in that you don't see everyday, like an elephant walking a toy poodle. I wish I had some more of this, but will look forward to the day I see a six pack in the cooler."
"hue is rich, deep copper/mahogany, minimally carbonated, bouqet is redolent of raisins, caramel, dark stone fruits, honey, taste is semi-sweet upfront, just enough bittering from the hops to provide balance on the finish. general taste is reminiscent of sweet, dark fruit, mouthful is slightly viscous in a good way, due to the residual sugars this is not necessarily a session beer but i could stand a few of these, a nice representation of the french country ale style."
"A clean, refreshing, well balanced ale. Sessionable, approachable, and enough flavour and body to hold the interest of an experienced beer drinker, as well as turn a newbie onto craft beer. Ill be looking for this one again come summer time!"
"Great fresh flemish fantastic ale!"
"A decent beer for sure and it would definitely go well with a roasted turkey dinner as it is so often recommended for Thanksgiving to have biere de garde."
"I rated this low on drinkability because of the bitter finish. This drinks like a bigger beer than it is. Recommended, but not an everyday beer."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very drinkable beer. I like this class of beers and with the lower alcohol level in this one, it makes it more reasonable to have a few."
"Pours a clear amber with a modest amount of carbonation that forms a tight, white head then falls to a collar of bubbles. The nose is malt-accented and yeasty. Biscuit and light caramel malt flavors dominate at first, then more tawny malt flavors express themselves, along with a bit of an alcoholic bite that suggests something stronger than 5.9 percent. A tasty, malt-accented beer, that I think could finish a bit drier. The mouthfeel is good and body just about right, but the finish is a little too thick, reducing the drinkability a bit."
"Feels great in my mouth although it's sitting a little on the heavy side, thus making this a beer I'd have a couple of but no more. Totally recommended, though."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks afatty!"
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this is very sessionable."
"This beer poured a clear, iced-tea brown color with good, fine carbonation. The foam was thin, and light tan in color, and settled. The smell was lightly malty with a faint caramel smell. Overall the smell was fresh and crisp. The taste was lightly malty with a touch of caramel malt and a hint of sweetness. There was a spicy hoppiness beneath the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and good carbonation. It was relatively clean, but with a light malty sweetness lingering in the finish. This was an OK beer."
"Drinkability: This beer doesn't impress me enouhg to have me wanting to drink more than few"
"Drinkability/Overall: a surprising amount of caramel developments for a biere de garde. Complex, well-made, interesting, smooth-tasting beer. I'm game."
"Bought at Breeze-Thru Liquor in Milwaukee."
"Very well crafted and very tasty. ""Brasserie Des Deux Freres"" on the label adds a quirky French touch."
"Medium bodied. Buttery mouthfeel, finishes slightly tart/dry. More tart than dryness. Pleasant amount of carbonation. Alcohol presence is well balanced. Easy to drink. Good solid beer, but I have had other's in this style that were more notable."
"Drinkability is good I really enjoy this brew & would buy it myself. Shbobdb, Ich danke Ihnen vielmals, This brew was delicious. Prosit und Zum Wohl! MK"
"Its nice to find a classy biere de garde brewed within 50 miles, and Ill be drinking plenty of Domaine DuPage."
"Slightly hazy orange-brown, topped with a meek, simpering collar of head. Despite the lack of a prominent head, there's sticky lace all over the glass. Sweetish and malty in the nose, a bit of sugary sweetness, fairly well balnced. To the sweet side, with weaker floral hops. Smells kinda old, with prevalent honey and the dulled hops, although the bottle is within code. None of the funky barn smell I associate with Biere de Garde, much more like a sweeter saison. Pretty tame. Kind of an apple pie aroma, with doughy, muddy, caramel belgian malt and appley esters. Not quite what I'd wanted, but not at all unpleasant. The flavor starts out apple pie-like. Clean clover honey, golden caramel and granny smith apple dominate the flavor. Sweet with a touch of belgian yeast spice. A bit of a floral, spicy bite of hops in the finish, though very mild. Mostly driven by the malt and yeast character. I can't help but feel this is about 6 months expired, sans the surge of carbonation. Good, but not as impressive as others of the style, or others from the same brewery. My weakest experience with Two Bros. so far. Sessionable, in the way that there's not a lot going on and you can keep sipping. Softer carbnation aids in the experience, with a fullish body. I'd probably want just one or two before opting for something else, though. After relating it to apple pie, that's pretty much the gist of it. Let me tell you, there's a lot worse than being compared to apple pie, especially when we're talking about american beer."
"D- Very tasty, easy to drink. Lovely mouthfeel, lots of malt and old world beer character."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The beer has a buttery diacetly alcohol very slick on the mouth. The bee is carbonated nicely. This beer is very easy to drink. This is not a must have beer in my own opinion. Not a bad beer but I probably wont buy again."
"Drinkability: not bad, but this just didn't come off as good as some others do in the style. Worth a try."
"Mf/d: Slick and oily with a slight carbonation sting. I would only have a few of these because of the insane sweetness but this goes down so easy. Quite the treat. This is one incredibly balanced beer."
"Easy to drink and tasty, would make a nice session beer."
"Drinkability - this is very good, goes down well, and is very sessionable."
"Mouthfeel- Dry, and very lingering."
"I get where they are going with this beer, and it succeeds admirably. Too bad what they were shooting for wasn't good taste."
"Appearance is a rich copper, with good initial head that leaves moderate lacing. Smell is fruity with some yeasty undernotes. Taste was surprisingly malty. No real bitterness, except for a tad on the finish..reminded me a bit of a maibock.Mouthfeel was slightly oily..I was hoping for a bit more dryness, but not bad. OK on the drinkability scale...a good brew, just not way above average."
"With such an elegant label, I expected a little more. We all make mistakes."
"Good all around....easy on the senses but not lacking in complexity."
"from the bottle. poured a amber with a off white head that left a small amount of lacing. aroma sweet, malt, hops with a nice touch of caramel, fruity. flavor I was excepting something close to Jully Pumpkin but this beer is no where close to JPs beer that said I enjoyed this beer very easy to drink nice and smooth. got caramel, hops, and malts, sweet. good beer"
"Very rich, yet subtle - a nice, malty bière de garde. Much better than the first beer I had from Two Brothers...I'll have to give some more of their beers a try. Recommended."
"D - Very drinkable, could be a sessionable version of a saison. Alcohol hidden well."
"Verdict: This isn't a beer that wows you with big flavor. The malt profile isn't especially complex, but it's smooth, sweet, and well-balanced. It went very nicely with a light Caesar salad."
"This offering from Two Brothers pours a dark maroon that has some yeast floating around the body, leaving a tan lace that floats on the top of the beer. The aroma is plum, dates, figs, prune lots of ""stone fruit"" are present in this saison. There is a sweetness to the body (sugary prune juice). The taste is hoppy, starts off with watery plum fruit juice feel, it has a malty background that reminds me of grape juice. The finish is a suttle hop bitter aftertaste with a somewhat floural watery mouthfeel. Pretty decent overall, I love the different flavor for this saison."
"Medium copper body with golden edges and a small, off-white head. Toasted grains on the nose with light fruity sweetness. A bit of spice in there too (grains of paradise?). Not much else. Toasted bitterness up front. Fruity malt with singed notes follows and mixes with light whiskey and wood flavors. Interesting. Finish shows tangier/tarter sides of the fruit and resonant toasted, slightly floral, bitterness. Medium to light bodied with a slightly sticky, nicely carbonated feel. Not bad and the tartness mixed with caramel/bread is different than any beer I've had lately."
"This is a saison? I guess brewers can do whatever they want to a style, and I'm all for experimentation, but this beer doesn't fit into any category really, and it's certainly not a saison. A bit of an identity crisis here. Pours a dark, stained-wood amber, kind of nice actually, but with no head at all. If I had to place a style label on this one, I'd lump it in as an ESB or English Ales in general. Full of toffee, carmel, and buttery notes, with a fairly quiet hop profile. Decently malty, but lost. Once again, definitely not a saison in my book. Chewy mouthfeel, kind of slick. Well, it does have a few redeeming qualities, but it's nothing more than a mild amber with a saison label on it. Who knows though, you might like it. Two Brothers do a great job in general, this one just needs a little work I'd say."
"The mouthfeel is interesting. Light and crisp, almost like a lager. Very hard to describe what is happening as the flavors run across my palate. Probably not something I will try again, yet it wasn't so dull that I have ruled out Two Brothers."
"Thin head, less than 1/8 inch, but with surprisingly good lacing. Appears clear (no cloudiness), very light carbonation, light reddish-copper color. Sweet aroma, hints of apple. Slightly tart mouthfeel but smooth due to the lack of carbonation. As for taste, a sweet malty start quickly fades and gives way to a moderate alcohol presence. Strong caramel taste, good grain flavor, and a faintly bitter finish. Not quite like the other saisons I've had (perhaps it's the ""Country Ale"" twist), but I really like it."
"An impressive brew that could use a bit more carbonation. Maybe it is just my bottle?"
"This is a tasty beer, even if it is not a classic saison in style. There is a very nice graininess to it, as opposed to the spicy yeasty flavor that typically is found in a saison. It is a nice flaovr though, and one of the better saisons out there. It is definitely a creative take on the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" tan head over the cloudy coppery amber brew. Head lasts nicely, with plenty of bubbly lacing. Aroma is grains and light spicing. Taste is hearty grains, a touch of sour, and then closes with a touch of dry. Mouthfeel is great, smooth grains and tart working well together, and drinkability is excellent as well. Not sure if it's to style, but it's yummy, and that works for me."
"drinkability: very drinkable, not par to style, but tasty nonetheless"
"Drinkability: This is inoffensive and pleasant, possibly a good crossover beer."
"Saison? Hardly. This just tastes like a really malty amber ale. It's pretty good, yeah, and it is certainly easy drinking, but this is hardly what I think of when I think ""saison""--there's no spiciness or complex hop character. Still well worth while, though."
"From a 12 oz. bottle.Nice clear dark amber with a light tan head. Mild smell of caramel and light roasted grains. Medium bodied with a chalky mouthfeel. Decent taste of honey wheat bread. Finishes crisp and clean. This would be a decent , mild session brew."
"Brave stuff from a worthwhile brewery. This is an accomplished Saison that could be labeled as Fantome Hivers baby brother. It brings an mild sourness to the caramel dough nutty complexity that forms the backbone of this hazelnut amber brew. Buttery and musty with hints of grass and hay. Parties in the mouth. Medium bodied with nice light carbonation. No head. Excellent session Saisonbut arent they all?"
"Light body, medium fizzy carbonation, some tingling sensation at the finish that rounds it out. Could be easily drinkable if there was some incentive in the flavor dept., its average and balanced."
"12 ounce bottle. Two Brother French Style Country Ale pours out a slightly cloudy copper color with an inch of head. The aroma is spot on for the Biere de Garde style. Sweet malt, honey, herbs, and a little tangy. Strongly herbal flavor with orange, coriander, and other spices. A little bit of a sweet honey flavor. I would like if it were a little more sweet and malty and a little less sour. Medium mouthfeel. Good beer, and especially impressive that this is an American version."
"Pours with a three-finger head that fades to a ring leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is a earthy hop. Starts slightly hoppy has an earthy spice flavor, finish is clean, more hops than malts. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"The taste is along the same lines, starting with a mildly nutty sweet caramel, then a bit of fresh biscuits and fruit - pears? - and a semidry finish with just a hint of hops bitterness and alcohol warmth."
" The taste can only be appreciated at cellar temperature or warmer. Toasted bread biscuits, with caramel and a slight lemon flavor. Slightly grassy hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and well carbonated. I do not think this beer is a Saison."
"After a Pumpkin Porter, I was really in the mood for a nice spicy Saison ... what a disappointment this one turned out to be.... flabby."
"The flavor is complex yet again not robust. I get sweet caramel, pears and lemony citrus notes throughout. The finish is a little tangy and fruity. QUite enjoyable. The bottle says 5.9%, but I dont notice it. THe drinkability is high as the beer is smooth and goes down easily. I had never heard of this brewery when I bought the bottle, but this beer makes me interested in finding others."
"Notes: Good flavor. This beer is very drinkable. It appears like a solid version of a Farmhouse Ale, with little spicing. But that seems to lend it to more a a session style."
"The mouthfeel was decent. Medium body with low carbonation. It had decent drinkability but it wasn't anything that I would want to stick to personally."
"This beer pours a light hazy copper color with a weak thinnish head that fades quickly. Aroma is of sweet bread flavors and honey. A bit of acidity in the aroma as well. Taste has more of that honey sweetness and a nice base of wheat and yeast flavors. Cider notes come in the form of a tart counterbalance to the sweetness. Still it finishes a bit sweet with some residual sugars in the end. Not bad, definitely easy to finish but not in the top of its class either."
"Beer is good. Happy unique beering."
"Drinkability is good wouldn't mind having more of these at all. Thanks go to gimmehead for this treat."
"Rich reddish copper with a small off-white head and minimal lacing. Smells very malty and grassy. Also some sweet caramel and sugar with a fruity apple or cherry aroma, very earthy. Taste is of wheat malts, grassy, lightly hopped with some sweet sugary notes and a very clean finish. Maybe a little on the thin side, but as I mentioned the mouthfeel is very clean. A very well balanced beer that paired nicely with grilled pork chops and made for a nice session. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This really has a full malty taste but the hops are strong enough to support it without being sickly sweet. Very pleasant to drink and seems to fit the style guidelines very well."
"Not a lot else happens with this beer. I like it, but it's not a real thinker by any means."
"DuPage pours a deep, brownish-red color with a slight cream-colored head. The aroma is an interesting, intriguing mix of young (under-ripe) fruit and malts. Its something like apple, pear, cherryall rolled in malt extract. The aroma isnt exactly strong, but rather restrained. It is very appealing, however. The taste is a mix of malty, bready sweetness with tartness. Fleeting acidity. Medium body. Yeast flavors come out in the taste, as the beer warms. Finish is fruity, has a touch of bitterness, and is very refreshing. I didnt have any expectations, and this was a nice find."
"A very nice beer, though I really favor acidic beers, so this might not be for everyone. I think it has an interesting, complex blend of flavors."
"I wish I hadn't bought a sixer of this crap."
"Bought this one on a whim because it looked good and is brewed in the IL suburbs where I grew up. Pours from the bottle an opaque amber color with hints of red. No real head to speak of on my pour at least. The smell is malty with some caramel and dare I say vinegar tones coming through. I can also detect a hint of hops, but it is definetly not upfront in any way. Quite a unique smell, this being my first tasting of the biere de garde style. The first sip is interesting...almost has a sour aspect to it. Hints of caramel and grape/plum come through along with a slight hint of vinegar. On the back palate I can taste some hops, which helps bring this together nicely. It's a little much for me personally. The mouthfeel is very light and airy...with a decent amount of carbonation. As far as drinkability...I don't think I'd have too many of these in one sitting, but I may come back to it again because it's so different from everything else I have tried. Overall, it's a nice brew and I look forward to exploring more of what Two Brothers has to offer."
"This beer is good in bottles and better on tap. My favorite beer from this neat little brewery."
"I have no idea if this is what a biere de garde is supposed to taste like or whether this is a good representation of the style. All I know is that Domaine DuPage is a wonderful beer that does just about everything right. The sad part is that this bottle is all I have and I can't remember where I bought it. Well worth your hard-earned money."
"Two Brothers Domaine DuPage delivers a slightly hazy, deep amber body with a reddish cast beneath a short but creamy head of white foam that holds quite well and leaves some thin lace about the glass. The nose is offers a comination of delicately toasty and straw-like grain with subtle notes of caramel alongside some soft summer fruit (apple, peach, cherry) and musty yeast. It's quite intriguing! The body is medium-light with a zesty, very-fine bubbled natural carbonation that finely pricks the tongue. The flavor starts with bold, toasty and caramelish malts upfront, followed by a splash of tart fruit (sour cherry, tangerine, plum) that fades into the finish. The tartnes is quite nice and refreshing, and it slowly fades in the finish, giving rise to some lingering toasty malt, a delicate spiciness, and finally a drying chalkiness that brings you full circle and ready for another sip. Given a chance, this is an exciting, fairly complex, refreshing, and satisfying beer that probably deserves much more recognition than it receives. Very nicely done and certainly worth trying!"
"Dynamic and molded in it's flavor profile. The malts are toasted throughout and at some points develop notes of butter, caramel and toffee. The hops are herbal and grassy. The malts are more scrumptious as it warms."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Crisp and clean in the mouth, great carbonation. Awesome sweets and yeastiness, great beer all-around."
"This beer is a dark brownish-amber color with a medium cream-colored head. Decent lacing. The aroma is mildly toasted malt and caramel. Light-bodied and smooth with a kind of low amount of carbonation. The flavor is a little tart but overall a mild blend of malt, bread, hops and caramel. The finish is very smooth, making for a fairly good session beer overall. I would get this again but it's a little simple in places."
"Slightly murky dark amber/brown with a nice off-white head that lasts and lasts. Aromas are different, and very appealing. I smell caramel, nice malts, herbal/floral hops, spices, and a bit of fruit. The taste is very earthy, herbal, malty, and very heavy on the caramel. This is reminiscent of some French Biere De Garde style ales, but to me, this does not have the malt complexities, or spicy hop profile that most French ales of this nature have. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth and the drinkability is good. This is a very good beer from the Two Brothers, but i'm not so sure about this being labelled as a biere de garde."
"The body is a deep red amber. This is a gorgeous hue. The head is a weak white. The aroma is candied yams with the caramel malt and yeast fruitiness playing tricks. The flavor suggests sweetness but there isnt much. This is an interesting little beer."
"Turbid dark amber hue. Covered by a steadfast, dense, stiff cream white head that leaves sticky lace. Stately notes of ripe peach, mandarin orange and musty yeast upfront in aroma. Coriander adds subtle herbaceous contrast. Well rounded and welcoming aromawise. Incipient in flavor is a combination of sourdough bread and orange zest. Tartness continues in an underripe tangerine and kumquat nature. Green pineapple hints. Sweetness augments as the beer warms, but remains as a subdued, honeyish presence. Highly carbonated initially, with a prickly carbonic bite. Eventually lightly dextrinous in mouthfeel. Trace clove surfaces after a deliberation. Musty, slightly cheesy yeast derived undertone adds token ""farmhouse"" character. Finishes minerally and slightly chalky, with citrus rind hints fading. A unique, albeit somewhat rough brew that would be an interesting one to cellar for a few months. If I had done this differently, I would've brought it out ice cold, opened the bottle, waited 15-20 min, then poured and enjoyed it. Nevertheless it's a tasty creation."
"Drinkability is very high. Nice beer, not sure if it's true to style or not due to limited experience with this style but very tasty and best offering I've had from this brewery."
"Light amber hue, no head, little movement from this bad boy. The nose reports plums, fresh apples, toast, malts, perhaps the list could go on! Razor sharp and aggressive offerings up front, large toasted malts, caramel, some hops also detected in the initial tasting. Becomes rather creamy and inviting; dough-like, fresh bread flavorings, quite enjoyable and for no extra charge has a decent belly-warming-offering! Nutty, buttery, slick, on the edge of full bodied, a fine offering from the ""you never know what to expect from Ebel Bro's""."
"Had this on cask at the Clark Street Ale House. Wow... very refreshing. Not a ton of hops in here, they let the yeast do the talking for them. This is a very tasty, refreshing beer. My first French Country Ale, and I'll be sure to seek out more of them. Pours a nice orange/yellow color. Good head retention, and moderate lacing. Again, the aroma and the flavor comes from the yeast. This beer definately makes me want to come back for more."
"This is basically a supped up version of a Fat Tire. It has more flavor & character, but it is basically an easy drinking, simple beer. It has some spicy notes, which add to the complexity, but overall it is quite simplistic and easily quaffed. A light amber color, with almost no head when served from the tap. This beer is mostly malty with some bready notes and some Belgian Yeast type spicing. A good intro beer for those not yet in to Belgian/ French country beers."
"ng"
"Deep orange with thick white, fluffy head.Flowery aromas (clover) and spicy yeast show on the nose. Sweet medium bodied beer with a candy sugar sweetness but overall bland flavors with a lightly spicy yeasty finish and a touch of malt. Not enough happening, could use a bigger malt jolt to round things out. A nice looking brew but could use some work."
"After examining the overall taste and brooding on the finish, it becomes apparent that this beer's main problem is one of balance. Normally the hops wouldn't show through so much in a French ale. But this one is so thin, one-dimensional, and uninteresting up front that the hops in the finish end up overbalancing the whole affair. Also, certain elements that should be invogorating somehow manage to fall flat. The carbonation doesn't feel very interesting or lively; it's there, but it somehow feels dead. During the finish the woody tannins languish on my tongue in a rather uninspiring way. I won't be bothering with any more of this."
"Pours a deep copper... kind of odd for a saison... with a whispy halo of white. Aroma is a mixture of bread dough, slight caramel notes, and grassy hops. Flavor begins sweet and juicy with caramel and malt notes, followed by a nice balancing bitterness. I would have expected it to be a little more dry, but it seems to work. Leaves a grassy aftertaste that is quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is lively with a light to medium body and medium carbonation. This is a quite enjoyable beer although it's not completely what I thought it would be."
"Probably my favorite from these guys. Pours a very clean looking pale amber. Not much head, and a modest showing at best in the lace/stick category. Aromatics hint at the style of Belgian Saison/farmhouse ale-plenty of mildly assertive hop in a citric sort of way-nice malt balance as well. Toasty caramel malt followed by a blast of spicy, citrusy hop, and a medium bodied and rather refreshing mouth-feel add up to one sound brew."
"Pours with a dark ambery/coppery color, with some strong foam and respectable amount of laceing. Can't tell a lot from the smell.. but the taste is very smooth, with (as everyone else has pointed out) a slight caramel hint in the taste. Not much carbonation, more of a creamy ale. Overall an excellent brew that goes down very smoothly. It's nice to promote a local brewer and when they are this good it's easy to do!"
"Pours a hazy amber with a light khaki colored head, which flattens and eventually disappears. Sweet caramel malt and biscuity aroma. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a touch of crispness. Sweet caramel malt on the front. Middle starts to introduce more of a fruitiness to the mix. Almost reminiscent of fermented grape jam. That jammy fruit flavor continues and combines with a toasted biscuit finish. Hops seem light. Very interesting and unexpected revelation of flavors. Great offering from Two Brothers."
"The head was small, creamy, smooth, ivory with fine sized bubbles that fully dissipated. The body was uncarbonated, yeasty and cloudy with a light amber hue. The nose was malty with a light sweet, lightly bitter, caramel and fruity flavor. The palate was tingly, smooth, dry, and medium bodied."
"Light copper color with hardly any head without agitation. Sweet, caramel malt nose with some herbal hops that require just a bit of attention. Toasted, sweet malt is at the forefront in the taste department, with a subtle breadiness accompanied by some more herbal, earthy and vaguely bitter hops on the finish. More malty than I'm accustomed to for the style. Smooth, well-carbonated and very drinkable, this makes for a fine session brew."
"Beautiful light golden coppery orange color, slightly opaque with little yeasties floating around, thin off-whitish cream colored head that fades to a thin ring and minimal spotty lace. Smells like an open field of grains with some nice little malty sweetness, dry, subtle, thin caramel notes behind. Taste is mild, pleasing, and subtle, lightly toasty with lightly dry biscuity tone and buttery sweetness, nice little grab of breadish yeast thats quite favorable on the palette. A mild drying woody hop finishes off this subtle masterpiece with enticing notes of grains and rice. Feel is medium bodied with a favorable little creamy start, adds soft thin grainyness and the finish is lightly crisp with a nice fluffy drying that fades well. A pleasant subtle beer with lots of thin layers and complexity. A good drinker and quite enjoyable, a great session beer. Thanks goes out to jeffboo for the bottle."
"Medium orange color. Small head. Aroma is malty, slightly sweet and applish. Medium bodied. Malty with a carmely start. Applish and a little nutty. Touch of hop spiciness. Light and refreshing. Nicely balanced. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round, Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Great stuff from the far western 'burbs. Nice malty aroma behind a head that disappears a little too quickly. Taste of orange and some light spiciness comes through, finishes off dry with a note of red wine. Mesdames, Messieurs, makez zhure to teep your waiters, si'l vouz plait!"
"[Edit 11/03] I've had mixed luck with this beer. Some are quite good, and others seem to have gone off. It varies bottle to bottle, but in the 12 I had, 2 were yeasty and poor."
"Hazy amber body with a quickly thining tan head. Very little lacing deposited on the glass. The nose is fruity and light. The taste seems coarse and yeasty, a little grassy; not all that pleasant to my palate. Lots of caramel malt sense as the beer warms to room temperature. This beer has a medium body and slightly astringent feel. Strong aftertaste is not particularly pleasant."
"Good and refreshing overall. Excellent with a meal or as a thirst quencher."
"It's a darker shade of amber with a small but thick off-white head. I can't get much of an aroma out of it, just some caramel maltiness. But the flavor is much better than the aroma suggests. Notes of sweet caramel malts and toffee come through wonderfully. It's medium bodied and crisp while being rather chewy sweet. Some hops are in the background through the malty finish. This is a brew definitely deserving of a try."
"Thanks cretemixer!"
"I grabbed this right out of the cellar at 52 degrees and was not dissapointed. Pours the color of raw honey with a fast fading white head. I'm left with a thin collar shortly after pouring. The aroma is of roasted barley with a hint of sweetness and a slightly earthy undertone. The taste has a slight graininess to it with a honey sweetness. Caramel malts and a mild hop bitterness to balance things out. A very smooth drinker with a light to medium body and smooth carbonation. An easy drinker and more importantly, a beer you want to have again & again. This one has found a place in my regular rotation."
"Domaine DuPage (Du-pa-je) (Two Brothers Brewery). I really enjoyed this beer. Had a brownish color with a golden tint, absolutely clear in appearance. The head was thick, a little bit off-white, but did not leave a whole lot of lacing. The malty aroma introduces this very tasty beer. Bready malts, coupled with caramel and toffee. To my surprise, this beer had fairly little in the way of aftertaste, as a spritz of hops cleaned up nicely in the end. Buy if you find it, this has got to be one of my favorites from the du Deux Freses (thanks Cokes)."
"Deep clear amber color, nice fluffy head that clings to the, malty caramel-candy like aroma,sweet malty caramel and toffee flavors, nice bitter finish. Great beer, one of my favorites from this brewery."
"A large thank you to Bighuge for giving me the advance screening.  This one is right up my alley."
"Burnt orange in color..barely any head...soft malty nose...a little thin in the mouth...not real familiar with this style,so it's tough to rate...toasty malt tones, but they are faint...dry finish...I'm glad I tried it but not a beer style I would seek out again.."
"The beer pours a clear deep amber with a somewhat truncated head that splits off into islands of thin bubbly froth.  Something weird, but nice, in the aroma.  Like Rosemary or Sage or something.  I think it's Rosemary.  (I had a Farmhouse ale that used Rosemary at PizzaPort in Solona Beach, CA, and this seems similar to that.)  This beer is a real refreshing change from all of the typical beer styles.  It is very nice.  Not often do you find French Style Country Ales available at the local package store.  Thus, I'm having a hard time describing the taste.  I would say it has quite a unique herbal quality.  A healthy dose of grainy notes.  And a nice bitter hop finish.  Easy drinking for 5.9 a/v.  Damn good beer."
