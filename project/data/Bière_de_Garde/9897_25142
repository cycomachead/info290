Aroma is mostly bready malts with some light grass and a bit of toffee sweetness, and just a hint of barnyard funk. Flavor is on the sweeter side, lots of fruits--apples, cherry, pears--some very sweet caramel malts, a hint of spices, and some funky yeast character. Lightly sour with some lightly dry oak character. Medium plus bodied, and could use a bit more carbonation to lighten things up. Overall, a nice beer for the fall, but wondering if I should have popped it when it was fresher, as it comes in a bit on the sweet side without much hay/hop/funky yeast notes that I was hoping for here.","BMMillsy","Oct 16, 2014"

4.43,6.5,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of a Sour, and it's a little unique for a Jolly Pumpkin beer simply because the funky yeast and oak barrel were a little subdued while the sourness and fruit flavors were in the forefront and I can't say that about many Jolly Pumpkin beers, it may just be the sourest beer I've had from them. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, slightly refreshing, not too acidic, a little dry on the finish, just crisp enough, not filling at all and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, a full bottle might be a little too much for me, but with how great it tastes I think I would give it a shot, so I would say one bottle is the perfect amount for me. What I like the most about this beer was how well the sour fruity flavors were showcased it reminded me of some of the better sours I've had. What I like the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad and I really liked the color, but the head and retention were a little disappointing. I would for sure buy this beer again, it's a little pricey, but I think it's worth and I would like to see how this beer changes with time. I would recommend this to anyone who likes sours, I think it's a must try, especially if your a Jolly Pumpkin fan. All in all I was very happy with this beer and I was also a little impressed with it, it was a little unique for a Jolly Pumpkin and in the end it made for one tasty beer especially for the warmer weather like the label suggests. This might just be my new favorite Jolly Pumpkin beers I've had and it's for sure the sourest one I've had from them and I think it's one of the better sours I've had and I think the complexity helped out with that. Great job guys, I'm really happy I tried this beer and it turned out to be an instant favorite, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","Jun 18, 2014"

3.96,-4.8,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"jolly pumpkin can do no wrong for me. this bier de garde type is a little more straight forward for me than some of their other stuff, but thats okay, its really expertly made and really yummy. a copper colored beer with a radiant luster, small white fizz head, and a remarkable clarity for a wild ale. i smell the classic jolly pumpkin brett and bacterial culture, and a ton of oak, giving it a funky sweetness that goes well with its robust grain profile. the flavor is a little sweeter than i need it to be, a mix of grain and oak contributing to that, a very toffee-like complexion to it, almost english in nature really, but then the bugs kick in. the beer takes a hard turn towards sour, with the acidity really developing later in the sip. dry now for how sweet it began, and mellowed by a ton of wood, really earthy and fresh. i could stand a bit more carbonation in this one to make the flavors pop a little more, they all seem to melt together just a little bit and lose their individuality, which bubbles would aid in i think, but i like the medium body and all the oak on this. clever beer, definitely up to the high standards they have set throughout their lineup.","StonedTrippin","May 30, 2014"

4.28,2.9,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Poured a nice cloudy amber with little bits of yeast floating in it and no head. It looks wonderfully rustic and wild, very nice. Scents of sour brett yeast, a slight sweet maltiness and a hint of cinnamon. Not the most intense aroma, but it is nicely subdued and pleasant. Flavor begins with a strong hit of sour brett yeast, quite apple cider vinegar-like, with some lemon notes. The sour flavors override the malty base and make this quite dry upfront. This opens into further sour flavors in the middle, with the addition of an excellent oak undertone that includes hints of oak and vanilla on the palette. Finish is dry and sour with hints of oak. Aftertaste is sour and oak. A very good flavor profile, though not as malty or toasty as a biere de garde normally is, still quite nice. Mouthfeel medium-light bodied with light carbonation and a drying feel. Very nice and easy to drink. Overall this is an excellent sour with a nice bit of underlying complexity in the aroma and flavor. At first glance it seems to be simply sour but as you drink the character of the beer unfolds and becomes nicely complex and very well executed.","Auraan","May 09, 2014"

I strongly recommend this ale if you like Jolly Pumpkin ales and/or sours in general. I love JP beers and Biere de Mars is 2nd to my favorite: La Roja. Perfect for a rustic meal or a cold day. As the beer opens, this ale could easily be confused with a dry kriek. This is in no way a sweet beer but has a very slight sweetness from the fruit notes, likely contributed to the barrel-ageing process.","macher0","May 26, 2013"

Things were just so funky, creamy, musky, bright, soured, and grassy, all while sitting in the nice malty base of a country ale. The flavoring followed nicely, as did the sip, but the big boldness of the nose was lacking. All the components were there, but they were just not as robust as we were hoping through the flavoring, or as creamy as we would have liked on the sip. Regardless, as a whole this is a fantastic take on the style, and a great showcasing of the tricks, punch, and excitement that Jolly Pumpkin has up their sleeves.","TheBrewo","May 04, 2013"

Aromas of big tart cherry, sour apple, raisin, caramel, clove, pepper, toast, oak, hay, leather, red wine, grass, funk, vinegar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Incredible aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast notes with moderate malt balance and barrel character. Taste of tart cherry, sour apple, raisin, caramel, pepper, clove, toast, oak, hay, leather, red wine, grass, vinegar, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Moderate fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart fruits, caramel, clove, pepper, toast, hay, grass, oak, leather, red wine, vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy esters with moderate barrel character and malt balance; with a great tartness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, slick, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible wild Biere de Garde style! All around great complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on with moderate acidity.

I get a good amount of lactic acidity and a red grape, tannic side as well. The flavors too, very sharp and crisp. I get a lot of sour red grape character in both a lactic and acetic manner. It also has a slight, juicy, fruity sweetness to it as well. This is definitely one of the more sour Jolly Pumpkins and definitely one of the most acidic. Because of this it isn't quite as approachable as some of their other, highly rated beers but it is a nice beer and a decent sour. Really, I would call this a darker version of Petrus if I had to relate it to anything.","aasher","Aug 27, 2012"

JP employs a deft hand at farmhouse funk with the majority of their beers. With so many turning out delicious, I am ruling out luck as a factor why this is so damn tasty.

The smell is slightly sour with a little bit of funk thrown in to the mix. The taste is similar with a slightly sour start to the sip finished off by a little funkiness that isn't to over the top. You can also pick out a little oak in the finish. Rather light on the pallet which is nice during the summer in Florida.

It had a large off-white head that hangs around for a very long time. Beautiful head on this beer. Scent was extremely funky from the second I popped the cap. Gotta love that JP signature funk. I also get a lot of oak and wood aromas with some sweet fruits and hints of vanilla. Taste is....DAMN I LOVE JP MORE and MORE with each of their beers I try. Initially I get tart cherry flavors, immediately followed by Belgian yeast, barnyard funk, and TONS of oak. The sweet fruity flavors in the beginning are amazing and somewhat vinous. Then all the oak and vanilla comes in and just blows my palate away. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and creamy. Drinkability is very high with no detectible alcohol flavors. Overall, this is ANOTHER amazing beer from Jolly Pumpkin...These guys are becoming one of my favorite breweries by far.","DovaliHops","May 26, 2011"

Taste is pretty good although nothing like I expected by reading the style listed on the bottle and written in beer advocate. The bottle reads ""French Style Stock Ale."" Sounds fairly unassuming and expected it to taste like a French farmhouse ale. It doesn't. It tastes like a sour but more complex. I think the aging in oak barrels makes this a much more drinkable beer and the taste is unique and complex. The aftertaste follows that theme and although this is a tasty beer and more drinkable than a typical sour (I'm thinking flemish sour, Flanders style with wild yeast) it's a beer to be savored and shared ideally.","bheilman","Oct 15, 2009"

It goes beyond vinegaric to downright offensive - with this style though, I don't know if they were shooting for a sour bomb, or if it has an infection (given the yeasts they go for).

Initially surpised by the darkness of the pour, a ruddy brown yet clear to the light, ruby edging and a short lived head. Smell is lively and full of yeasty bugs, strong oak, and underlying fruit, cherry and crab apple. Wow I was sort of expecting a more carbonated and lighter Biere de Garde but this is one of those non-category hybrid beers, almost like a dryer sour brown ale. Zesty wild yeast plays big here out front, with a nice mellow fruityness as the body of the beer, finishes pleasantly sour and with huge oak and dry woody tannins. Really excellent.

Aromatics bring tart with spicy funk reminiscent Jolly Pumpkin tones but the tart aspect rains supreme and brings with it some fruity vinous notes combining a cherry and raisin nose about it of course the wood aging and spice additions openly fermented all way into the wave of different characteristics this beer is capable of. Flavors a blend of sweet lactic tinged cherry juice with oak barrel woody and pine notes coming out. Underlying spice and horse blanket funk and yogurt like tang. Really a fine beer by the way you almost need cheese and crackers to pair with this beer, it really cuts through it all quite nicely. If any hops are detectable they come off like herbal earthy cherry pits, by the way this stuff goes so well with food. Completely clears all fat from the palate mouthfeel is fine bubble carbonation streaking effortlessly leaving a dry tart lactic tone on my tongue. Sounds not so good, right? But when it comes down to it, this characteristic blends so well with so many other familiar flavors that I'm not accustomed to. Drinkability is really effortless the bottle drains itself just pair this fine brew with some food and everything will come together for you, definitely a delicious brew that I'm ready to handle any time.

Yeast gives this a spiciness with tones of clove and ceylon cinnamon. I pick up some oranges as well. Flavor is kind of thin in the malt department. Extremely dry. What subtle caramel and toasted malt qualities I got in the nose are even more muted here. Kind of like this has funk for funk's sake and it doesn't mesh as well as with their other beers. Has a weird acrid bitterness in the finish. Has quite a medicinal lingering effect. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy. I usually love JP's offerings, but I'm quite disappointed in this one.

The beer fills the nose with a mix of malt sweetness, soured malts, and a firm spicy, woody note. Very peppery, tart, fruity, and musty throughout. The look is a typical rusty hue, moderate haze (from sediment), and very well headed and constant lacing. Flavors alternate between estery fruits, malt sweetness, and bretnomyces sourness. No attribute dominates the brew, but complements it fully. Phenols gain precedence as the beer warms and also adds complexity without detering from the other flavors. Nicely bitter to round out the sourness and offset any sweetness. Much bitter and spiciness comes from the wood, and not so much from the hops.

Nose has that nice Oak Barrel tartness, the pleasing malt sweetness, citrus like crispness, and a real portent of the joys to come upon the tasting.

Some earthy barn funk added some nice depth. Yeast notes before the lightly tart fruit finish.

Middle impression spreads out a little bit, slightly chalky bitter with mandarin orange and mellon notes.

Strong, but not overly complex bouquet. I was happy to find the oak notes transcend as it warmed. I'd consider this fairly heavily bodied, in fact perhaps too bold in some respects. Strong hints of yeast with a gritty malt backbone. An off-putting sour mouthfeel but with a good, lasting finish. This is reminiscent of many sour Belgians - a la Rodenbach - but comes up very short in comparison. You can detect what others have referred to as 'grape' notes through its almost wine-like character (probably the effect of oak aging) Seems a fantastic brewery I hope to come across again.

A solid, though light, acidity finishes this beer off at the end of a sip; it is tart like an apple or plum perhaps. This is really accentuates that feeling, for me, that this would make a good after meal drink. The acidity almost acts as a digestif for me, it keeps this light enough on the palate to be drinkable, but the rest of the beer keeps this rich enough to be a contemplative after meal treat.","Gueuzedude","Feb 07, 2006"

Rons creations, and the beer that turned me on to the Biere de Garde style. That being said this is definitely an outlier for the stylenot that it matters or that the jovial yet menacing Jolly Pumpkin gives a damn.

A flash of lemon sourness mixed with some brown sugar was apparent as well.

While it doesn't wow me, it is certainly solid enough and I am definitely willing to give some of their other brews a go.","CortexBomb","Aug 28, 2005"
3.7,-11.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A well made brew from Jolly Pumpkin. Poured out to a hazy burnt orange color with a nice white and orange hued head. Medium high carbonation. Islands of lace are abundant in the glass. Aromas of yeast, rotted fruit, mild roasted malts and grass. Taste was a bit of a let down compared to the smell; flavors of malt, wood, yeast, and sweetness went well together, but overall, this brew seemed like it was missing a piece of the puzzle. Mouthfeel was good and hearty without being over bearingly thick or heavy. A decent level of drinkability overall. This is a good beer de garde, but i've had better. Worth a try.","Frozensoul327","Aug 27, 2005"
4.47,7.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"First of all, this beer is fun now, but will get increasingly interesting with age. Its also not necessarily a biere de garde (like Jenlain or Bavay), so don't judge it as such. I'm sure I will greatly edit my review since this a maddeningly complex brew that is guaranteed to change and is built to age.","nomad","Beers"

4.13,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Some initial caramel. A subdued complexity that is hard to put into words. The bannana hinted at in the nose becomes quite muted. Some nice plum sort of flavours float around through the middle and lead to a bone dry finish that lingers for a moment and then invites another sip. Some Brett character subtly working its way into the profile. Medium bodied, gentle carbonation. This beer is just crying out to be enjoyed with a meal. Shows some interesting promise for aging. A distinctly American interpretation of biere de garde, that some will treasure (I think you can count me as a fan).","xgrigorix","Aug 16, 2005"

4.52,8.7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"This is a daunting beverage. I enjoy it a great deal, though I hesitate to sing its praises too loudly until I've tried it again in six months when I think it will be truly amazing. If beers in this spirit comprise the future of American brewing, I'm looking forward to being around for the ride.","marburg","0"
