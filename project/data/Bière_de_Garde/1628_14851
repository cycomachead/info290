Nice transparent copper color with a thin had that bubbled away quick but left a thin skin of bubbles on the surface. Nice rich color and streaky leaving. Nose is fairly muted but one can detect nice caramel almost buiscit notes. Taste is more if the same but far more toasted. Nice crystallized malt. Really nice body. Very balanced. Really drinkable and enjoyable bdg. makes me really enjoy a style that i otherwise couldn't care much for.","cosmicevan","Oct 18, 2013"

It had a good level of complexity, but in some ways was a bit too complicated and confusing as some of the flavors really did not transition and meld together well.

3.83,-5.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Appearance is a deep orange and copper tone with an off-white head. Its` nose has spice, honey and some caramel. The taste of this biere de garde contains some bread, light malts, hay and a small amount of fruit. It is all subdue, too much perhaps. Mouthfeel is low, dry finish. One of the better choices from this style imho.","mltobin","Dec 12, 2011"
4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a lightly hazed amber, decent head and retention. Scent brings musty wet hay and spicy yeast before notes of toffee and roasted nuts present themselves. Taste follows scent with an initial push of musty hay, dried grain, moderately spicy and lightly bready yeasts, nice dry toasted nut and toffee flavors throughout. Rustic comes to mind. Medium bodied, lightly grainy on the palate yet smooth. Overall a very nice seasonal offering that doesn't make it all about the spices.","rfgetz","Nov 22, 2011"

3.8,-6.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"I don't think this bière de garde, although it was good, will have the same kind of effect (which is just as well, because nothing could possibly make me love Christmas more than I already do).

4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a copper color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet crystal malt scent along with a slight, dry mustiness. The taste is good as well. It has a dry, musty flavor that goes down easy and finishes with some caramel sweetness. It's moderatly bitter with little in the way of yeast esters. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking Biere de Garde. It's true to style and full of character. Nice work.","WesWes","Beers"

4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" light beige head over the clear copper brew. Head recedes gradually, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is moderately sweet, with spicy yeast character. Taste is sweet upfront, lightly spicy in the middle, which kicks up towards the end. Mouthfeel is clean, and drinkability is good.

4.05,-0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"On-tap at The Farmhouse in Emmaus. This isn't far removed from a Belgian pale ale or amber, but there's a little something extra in the flavor. It's a literally flowery, like rose petals. Beyond that, the beer has an array of subtle flavors that range from dry biscuity malts to light citrus rind hops, and fruity caramel. This beer is not the richest, but the mellow complexities are quite nice. Certainly worth a try.","tempest","Jan 05, 2009"
3.93,-3.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Rich and malty, billowing to encompass the taste buds. A lot of people taste this as dry, it doesn't seem overly dry to me, but it does seem nice and crisp. Not too overly sweet even though there is a strong malt component, with not a lot of hops on the other end of the spectrum. A little thin in the middle, not much to bridge the gap after the initial malt. Tastes some of strawberry, peach, mild fruit. High drinkability as expected, it all blends together fairly well. I had no expectations going in to this, but now that I've tried it, I'm impressed. It isn't amazing, but what I presume to be a pretty good representation of a dry, yet sweet ale.","damienblack","Jan 03, 2009"
4.03,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4," I thought the ABV% was a bit higher than the actual 6.60% of this beer. Maybe because it's a holiday beer and I expect them to be a bit stronger and celebratory in nature. No matter...this is very easy to enjoy on a night like this and worth a try once for someone who wants to celebrate the holidays witout overloading on spice or alcohol. A great beer to start the new year off with!","JerzDevl2000","Dec 27, 2008"
3.9,-3.9,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"I remember taste testing this against the Harpoon warmer with the owner's brother at the filling station. I liked the texture of this one as opposed to the spiciness of the Harpoon. This one has a thick, syrupy coating and a smooth, warm, fruity finish. This improves as it warms, with hints of apple and grapes but a light, delicate flavor, in contrast with the mouthfeel. A touch more carbonation would probably help but that could have been lost in the growler fill or the four days it took me to open it. Very good, not great but worth trying.","daliandragon","Dec 27, 2008"
3.85,-5.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Handsome malty-brown color with a bubbly head; quite malty in the nose with definite overtones of peach and strawberry, maybe even raspberry. The taste had less fruit than the aroma but was still very fruity with apples and plenty of malt before a light but sharp hops whack at the end. Decent body with light carbonation; very brisk and tangy. Despite the ABV, I didn't find the alcohol to be particularly present. A decent find, not spectacular but quite nice, especially the berries in the aroma.","gfreed","Dec 25, 2008"

Biscuit malt aroma with a hint of caramel, stone fruits, and light hop aroma. Very mellow. Low bitterness with light caramel sweetness and some grain character, less fruitiness than in the aroma but still with a nice peach undertone. Hops and a bit of spice appeared in the finish, perhaps a hint of warmth too. Lingering herbal hop notes. Medium bodied yet just short of a sticky, viscous texture. Ample carbonation gave it a lightness without the fizzy rush of overcarbonation. Very well balanced, quite elegant overall. Very drinkable and quite tasty.","DrJay","Dec 15, 2008"

3.93,-3.2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"The guy at the beer store told me this beer was flying off the shelf. I decided to try it since I like trying local brews. Pours a nice amber in to a tulip glass, shwoing off it's clarity as well. Not much in aroma, mostly bready, but not offensive. Sweetness dominates at first, but becomes more structured after the first few sips. Hints of some kind of herb. Very well made, shows it's a substantial brew by the way it sits on your tounge, with a nice long aftertaste. Highly recommended and a bit different.","AaronRed","Dec 01, 2008"
4.3,5.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: The version I am drinking is a contract brewed bomber that says ""French Style Christmas Ale"" on the label; perhaps the recipe has changed over time but I view this more in the Winter Warmer camp than a Biere de Garde, despite what the label says; having said that, I really enjoyed this beer","brentk56","Nov 30, 2008"
4.3,5.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is extremely good, with a great taste, lighter and dry, it goes down very easily. Still, it's got enough depth that pondering is rewarded. Refreshing and satisfying, it paired well with the left-over turkey - perhaps not perfect (a bit to brawny), but very tasty. I also tried it in direct comparison to an at least 1.5 year old bottle of Sans Culotte, it was so vastly superior I couldn't have another sip until I had savored the last drop of this.","ccrida","Nov 28, 2008"

3.88,-4.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Out of the 22oz bomber. Pours an exceptional clear and pretty copper color, nice fluffy egg shell colored head that settled fairly quick into a light ring. The aroma is fairly light, a sweet toasted malt with a touch a hoppy spice. The taste is of a toasted malt with a sprucey hop bite, lemon rind and a tart cranberry like fruitiness. The brew sits well on the palate, slightly chewy, prickly carbonation, finishes with a spicy sweetness. A nice and spicy biere de garde, more of a hoppy spice than yeasty spice.","Gmann","Nov 13, 2008"

3.8,-6.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"They did not nail the style, likely intentionally. A fine Belgian near sticky yeasty ale with good malting and a significant but not bold spiciness.

It took a while to settle down. Surprise to see it so clear. Nice amber color. Pleasant nose of caramel and sour cherries/cranberries. Subtle but obvious spices  white pepper, nutmeg maybe ginger.

3.77,-7.1,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Half Time in Poughkeepsie, NY, we brought home a growler for, what else, Christmas. However, we couldn't wait, so we gave ourselves an early gift. The French Country Christmas Ale poured a rich and deep reddish amber with a thin khaki head. Grassy, but in a fresh sweet way, and hoppy to the nose, there is also a hint of maple syrup underneath. Frankly, I found the taste a touch thin and static--a disappointment, really, given what I found to be the complexity of the aroma. The malts dominated (figs, prunes?), the taste settled smoothly, but it never evolved, and the carbonation seemed too demanding.","longpondbeerman","Nov 25, 2005"

4.6,13.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Autumnal in color, with an expansive, creamy off-white head. The aroma contains more of a roasted, caramel malt character than I would have expected from other samplings of the style. It is offset, however, by a slightly musky straw-like scent and a hint of grapey sharpness. Caramel malt is strong in the flavor as well, and blends nicely into a subtle woody flavor at the finish. A bit sweet at the start, this beer develops a lot of complexity throughout the sip, including a (mostly) grapey fruitiness and a slightly alcohol-spiced finish. Full in the mouth, yet not at all overwhelming. This is a delightfully drinkable beer.","mzwolinski","Jun 13, 2005"
4.28,5.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Notes: This beer is nothing like Southampton's other Biere de Garde, Biere De Mars. The Mars is lighter (both appearance and taste-wise) and has much more fruit and hop flavor.","palma","Jun 06, 2005"

3.83,-5.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Superb white head, fully laced thrones above the sandy murky amber robe. Peaceful and balanced aroma in which no flavour takes the top on another. The bready yeast gently integrates peppery edges among the generous biscuity malt. Applesauce, grapes and pear reminiscent fruit notes unveil a vinous earthiness that evolves into serious cork notes, not in an unpleasant way in the nose, but perhaps a bit brash in mouth. Quite tart and clovey, the taste is pretty much in line with the aroma, theres just more sourness than youd expect. Not as impressive as most Southampton, but still one of the good Bière de Garde Ive had, so few have been as impressive as my enthusiasm for discovering more from this elegant style.","Rastacouere","Feb 13, 2005"
4.45,9.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Appears a fairly clear bubbly amber with a tall tan head. The head stays at about a half inch cap fluffy cap the whole time, while leaving rings of lace. Aroma is a bit musty and funky with a good amount of fruitiness and spices. There is a bit of sweetness as well and yeast as well. Taste is pretty strong with spice and the musty funk. A bit doughy and there is a slight tartness towards the end. Quite a variety of flavors in the mix here. There is also a slight spicy hop bitterness and this finishes with a lingering spice and funk. Mouthfeel was crisp and bubbly with loads of carbonation. This keep me coming back for more to try and figure out all the flavors. Overall an interesting complex and tasty brew I would definitely have again. Good stuff thanks for the bottle steve.","meathookjones","Oct 16, 2004"
4.5,10.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, it's a bit darker and more caramel-accented than most of the larger, commercially available brands; but it's certainly far from authentic. This is exactly the type of beer that you might find from a smaller house-brewery along the northern border. Very well done! Enjoy it with venison or a darker meat alongside lightly buttered vegetables on a cool night; or as a relaxing goblet as the sun goes down on a warm summer's night.","NeroFiddled","Sep 27, 2004"

A nice regal selection.","frank4sail","Aug 24, 2004"
3.98,-2,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"This is a great beer, but after spending about a month in France over the summer and becoming very familiar with the biere de garde style, I think they definately missed the style on this one.

4.03,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The taste is much different than the nose, or at least I was lead to believe the beer would taste quite a bit different than it does. The taste is quite malty with a finish that reminds me of biscuits and lightly toasted whole-grain bread. There is almost a chalky quality to the palate of this one, it seems to boost the body and make this beer seem a bit fuller. This is certainly interesting, I was expecting much more yeast character; more fruitiness, and more spiciness. This is one of those Biere de Garde's that goes for the cleaner flavor profile and relies more upon the malt character. The malts in this beer really shine, without the amped up malts this would be a flabby beer because of the restrained yeast character. As this beer warms up I get some nice fruitiness up front, with notes of pear and apple.","Gueuzedude","May 22, 2004"
4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It pours a beautiful copper/amber that is mostly clear and has a nice head and some decent lacing.

The beer starts out mildly sour, tapering down to a saccharine sweetness, and finishing fairly dry. Impressive in the way it changes flavors so seamlessly. Light alcoholic warmth in the throat, and almost no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is terrific, with small, tightly knit bubbles. Very authentic, better than the imported versions I've tried thus far.
