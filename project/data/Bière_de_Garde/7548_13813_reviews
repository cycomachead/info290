"Pours an opaque amber with two fingers thick dense white head, a few rings of lace on the glass. Smell: upfront it's grassy, spicy, with some mineral note; mildly grainy with grape and light stone fruit sweetness, sugar cookie. Taste: nectarine, slightly tart, lemon note, grassy, snappy grain, doughy and sweet backing. Light-medium and creamy for a split second, then some heftier carbonation kicks in, pulling it to medium-plus with a fluffy feel. Finishes dry and fairly hoppy. Delicious, crooshable."

"A smooth refreshing beer. A unique version of the style bringing thoughts of springtime and the daffodils for which it's named."

"Rare beer club beer. This is another one of those beers that make me happy to be I the club. I never would have picked this up off the shelf in a store. This a a really nice beer. Doesn't smell like much, but it really comes through on flavor perfect summer beer. Crisp but flavorful."

"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation of high intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is fizzy and spritzy, appropriate for the bright flavors of the beer, but perhaps a bit too much so as well. Even with time, the fizziness does not fully fade. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness lingering on the palate and lips."

"A totally distinctive brew that should be tried just for the education. From the 750 ml Belgian-style bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego for 14 bucks."
"O: A nice Biere de Garde. I wish the flavor was a bit brighter with as much complexity as the aroma."
""
"O: A beautifully elegant hot-weather beer. Easily the best non-Brett biere de garde I've had. My third bottle in a month and certainly won't be the last. Highly recommended."

"Drinkability : a nice beer in the French style ""bière de garde""."

"OK...head remains, carbonation is still active. Aromas include baked bread, flowery perfume, lavender, citrus. Flavors include field herbs, tea, honey, lemon zest. As a farmhouse ale I find this very tasty, refreshing and satisfying. I'm torn on how high to rate this as I find few flaws except perhaps a slight soapy water note, or some odd herbs, an a tiny mouth puckering dry-bitter finish. Full bodied with sweet amber malts, light herbs, honeydew melon juice, powdered sugar. It's complex and pleasant...reminds me a bit of the Achel yeast. The field workers of yore would have been fortunate to have such a brew."

"O-A really solid, if unremarkable, beer. The smell and flavors do not hit you over the head, but I don't think that is what this beer was trying to do. High marks for a well-balanced mouthfeel, too."
"O- this is a good beer. It would be great on a hot day (today is NOT a hot day). The tartness took me a minute to get accustomed to, but I was really digging it towards the end of the bottle. This was a tasty find."

"O: A very subtle, well-crafted, and easy-drinking French blonde."

"pours a hazy deep golden yellow with a thin tight small bubbled head. Nose is pretty nice, light barnyard yeast notes, lemony and airy with a faint spice to it. Taste is similar, a bit brighter with more barnyard, nice balance of yeast, more peppery mid to back palate, assertive carb, semi dry finish, light and refreshing, gets a touch sweet and syrupy towards the finish"
"Overall: carbonation lightens flavor. Easy to drink, no hint of abv."
"Beer is light in body sweet and a little floral, it is interesting. A simple but completely decent Biere de Garde. I really enjoyed it and I'd even have it again perhaps."
"Overall, this is quite delicate, but very nice. The floral character is really well done. This is something I look forward to having again."

"A nice beer, but really nothing worth any trouble."

"I find that this garde has more in common with a saison than with a tradional biere de garde. I have to agree with the person who mentioned this before."
"This is a really nice drink and would be nice with most food profiles, while pleasant and most drinkable on its own."
"A perfect example of what French Farmhouse ales have to offer. Not as malty as other Biere de Gardes, more like a Belgian Saison. Would pair well with a wide range of foods, we enjoyed ours with tamales."
"Drank this on the porch in the late afternoon of what might be our last proper summer day, and it was just the thing. Fluffy white head leaving loose lacing. Aromas of hay, lavender, and lemon zest. Nice malt-driven body, but with a light touch. Complex but not heavy handed, and with an easy drinking nature relative to it's alcohol content"
"Thanks to Ken for sharing this one at a recent tasting. Poured a hazy yellow with a lingering ring of white foam. Aromas of bread, lemons, yeast and flowers. On the palate, this one was light bodied, tart and prickly, with flavors of straw, vanilla, yeast, lemons and light floral notes with a smooth dry citrus finish."
"Got this beer through Michael Jackson's Rare Beer Club. Poured into a red wine glass with a nice even white head. I could have stuck my nose in it all night - lemons and pear. Was a perfect summer beer for dinner on the porch. Served with Gazpacho and grilled pears with balsamic vinegar."
"Great beer, glad I picked this one up."
"D: Would love to drink acouple of these throughout the night. Quite easy to drink and satisfying for a farmhouse ale."
"Upon removing the wire bail, the cap had a millimeter deep impression, fortunately the cork was removed with no effort and before anyone got hurt. Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a three finger plume of soapy white head (expected a lot more), good retention. Scent was fantastic, combining light watery fruits, flowers, tangy grain, bready yeasts, peppery spice and and wonderful earthy funk with light notes of barnyard. The taste presented all components of scent and was much smoother then the scent dictated, but still tremendous. Lightly dry and bubbly on the tongue. One of the more lighter and delicate beers in the style i have sampled, but full of complexity and character,"
"O: The beer is quite easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. It’s an interesting take on the style."
"Easy to drink and quenches the thirst. Nice brew."
"This beer is great. A Biere de Garde. Similar to Saison in style this one is 7% abv which gives it a nice body and a slightly darker color than most Saisons. Very refreshing, clean, and interesting. Lots of grain husks and grassiness with fruity yeast aroma: pears, apple, wet hay. A faint malty sweetness is balanced out with a crisp finish with lots of impressions of freshly bailed hay. Mmmm. Springtime in a bottle."
"Dr: It's very drinkable, relatively high ABV, decently priced, and of enjoyable quality. It's not special, but it's worth a go. Give her a spin, lads."
"O: Overall this is really quite nice. Not super complex, not super strong. Just nice, clean and refreshing. The fruit flavors meld together wonderfully and it's a pleasure to smell and taste. This is the first time I've tried this style and I like it. It's kinda like a bigger saison I suppose."
"Had again on 9/26/13 with the same results as above (perhaps the only difference was the less assertive ""pop"" this time 'round)."
"Drinkability: Very, very drinkable; perfect for a hot summer day. Obviously one needs to keep an eye on the ABV, but with a little self-restraint this could be a great beer for a hot afternoon in the backyard."
"Golden straw pour with a champagne like head. The nose is lemon, bread, yeast and a little bit of spice, like pepper. The taste is very refreshing - lemony, spicy, bready, a bit of fruit (pear). The flavors meld nicely and then dry off of the palette in the finish. No hint of 7% ABV at all. Goes down light and easy with a big spritz of carbonation and a light body. This is a really enjoyable beer. Would make a perfect 6-pack, lawnmower beer if that were possible."
"D-True to its purpose this is a very refreshing, albeit strong. I liked its simplicity, and some of the fruits really set this beer apart from others. Although the ABV is beyond what would be traditional, it is well masked and I didn't think it detracted from the overall experience. Worth trying, but I don't know if I will buy it again."
"O - pretty nice. Not something I'm gonna buy for just myself again. A little too sweet to drink the whole bottle alone."
"A very approachable beer - the Cuvee des Jonquilles is light in color and gravity with a sweet, floral aroma and a grainy, wheaty texture. One of the breadier bier de gardes I've yet had. A nice bottle to uncork at a celebration or, with a label like that, maybe the start of spring."
"D- Very smooth a dry, I'm not sure the bottle date, its been sitting in my brew shop for a what looks like a few months. I'm a little disappointing by the smell, the taste is good, but I wanted a bit more herb, then vegetable. The mouth-feel is what sets this one a apart from other beers for me."
"Very easy to drink, with just the right bite when needed. I'm getting another."
"Taste has some peach, lemon, some apple and a bit of funk and a dry crisp finish."
"The best example I've yet encountered of the ""blond"" variant of the style. Smooth, traditional, simple, and perfectly crafted."

"Overall this was one of the more complex biere de garde's that I remember having. A refreshing beer that's worth a shot if you see it around."
"All in all, a very well done beer in the classic French saison style. This was described by Simon at Cave à Bulles as typical of Northern French beer. If you see one, it is certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability is very high, although I have a sense of preciousness about this bottle, compounded by how satisfying it tastes, that leaves me milking ever last drop. This beer is a true masterpiece."
"Drink: Yeah, pretty nice."
"Soft vanilla and old lemon in the fore with sweet grains and malt. Tongue tickling and herbal bitter through the middle. The finish is malt, lemongrass and a hint of bannana-like German Hefe flavor. Pretty interesting beer. A touch sweet, but still very drinkable and tasty."
"BBE 2008. Just opening the cage of this 750 was enough to get a big explosion and spot on sealling where cork hit. Some gushing following but luckily( after opening some other french brew yesterday I learned not to trust french ones) only misssed first foam and rest saved in glas. Gave a wonderfull nice lasting white head and very pale golden beer that's hazy. Nose is very bretty, dry grass, pepperspice and phenolic but overall smooth that I find strange for a bett beer. Taste is very wheaty, brett, spiced, not noticable 7% and well balanced all together. Maybe carbon dioxide level bit high for a save opening of the bottle but fitting the taste well and just a fine brew to drink on a quiet evening."
"The beer literally explodes out of the bottle as soon as the cork is nudged. Settles into the tulip very pale and slightly cloudy yellow; a thin sheen of meringue-like head and good lace. Peppery and tartly lemony aroma, with coarse grain, yeast, and hop background. Airy thin body with crazily vivacious carbonation. Powdery sweet & tart lime and lemon flavors. A grainy and slightly musty yeast center dries to a well-hopped finish. A bit thin in flavor compared to others, but quite refreshing overall."
"Pale straw, green at the edges, beautiful volcanic head which flashes away after a bit, leaving just a little lace. It looks crisp and fresh like granny smith apples. Smells of tangerine, grassy hops, lemon and melon. The taste springs spicy, peppery from a mild hoppy start to a smooth balanced malt flavor. Long herbal finish, a bit dry, very tasty, very refreshing. A very nice, lighter (not lighter in alcohol) biere de garde."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle, no freshness dating on label."
"M&D: softly-carbonated on the mouthfeel, quite different from the hyper and fizzy look~~ Medium-bodied, with a healthy and dryish finishing touch to balance the fore-taste, but it is still a touch too sweet for the style (as I know it, at least). That said, I have to admit this is one of the most enjoyable and approachable Biere de Garde I've tried--it could've been more pleasant actually, if only it hadn't burst into the sky by accident..."
"750ml caged and corked. Cloudy golden yellow with small white head that quickly drops back into the body. Scant strings of lace. Big funky farmy notes with a mix of sweet fruits come on string in the aroma. Nice spiciness and a slight hoppiness. Flavor starts with more fruit and farmy funk goodness. Some earthy and floral hops add a touch of bitterness. Touch of spiciness round is out before the fruity finish. Crisp, clean and well carbonated I found this quite refreshing. Great drinkability as I would have had another right after if it was available."
"(Their) Tasting Notes - Great interest is maintained through many layers of taste with a superb balance. It gets more bitter with age. JW: Considerably better without any sediment in glass."
