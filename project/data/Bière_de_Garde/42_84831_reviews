"Real smooth. Good malt profile up front, subtle hops. Reads more like a lager or a märzen."
"Malty, but not too sweet. Just a hint of alcohol bitterness. Very good, very innovative offer from Ommegang."

"Leave it to Ommegang to unleash another unique beer, lots of good stuff coming from them. Look- burnt amber with a sudsy, generous head that sticks around and coats the top as it subsides. Smell- not too distinctive, mainly yeast notes. Taste- sweet, earthy, you really get the harvest grainy tastes the beer is shooting for. It's like fall in a glass. Feel- smoother as the beer goes down, nice with an abv under 6. Overall- good, hearty beer for fans of Belgian style amber ale"

"A golden color with some haze and a beautiful, tall, puffy white head.  The smell has a little estery-fruit, a lot of pale malt, and a touch of yeast.  It has a highly carbonated, peppery, but subtlety malty taste.  Sharpness...tastes as if it has a higher ABV than it does.  Long finish, and medium in mouthfeel."
"O- A great beer for the fall/winter.  A very bold and characterful beer that would stand up very well to most any hearty winter meal, and has just a touch of alcohol warmth to bring it all together.  Personally, Belgian beers are not my usual pick, but this is one that I would get again. (4.01)"

"Malty aroma is not strong, has an earthy undertone. Pours a nice bubbly orange-amber with a thick and rather persistent cream head. Flavor has malt, wheat and rye components with an earthy undertone and just a whisper of hoppy bitterness. Texture has about average body and a decent amount of tingle. Finish is earthy with hints of rye and wheat. Overall, not great, but interesting!"

"O – With the high levels of maltiness and carbonation and the heavy body, this is nearing liquid bread.  Love the balance of all of that with light but flavorful hops and perfect level of bitterness. A fantastic brew."

"I need to try this again. I think the bottle was a bit older than it should be. Overall, a decent beer with some nice Belgian characteristics."

" Overall, a 4.75 is given to Scythe & Sickle - Brewery Ommegang. A great fall and even winter brew to mix things up from cinnamon/clove/nutmeg and allspice/molasses/cinnamon. I will definitely buy this again."

"Great malt and grains complexity in pair with fruits from colder lands."
"O: [3.25] I am not a fan of Belgian style beers but this one is better than most.  The typical wheat and grass forward taste is there only on the first few sips.  Then the malt takes over and this is really a sweet tasting nice beer."

"Biere de Garde >>> Oktoberfests."
""
"Very crisp and bubbly mouth feel. It's obvious that this beer is highly carbonated. I felt this beer displayed more of the buttery characteristics of a lager as opposed to the clean taste of an ale. Refreshing and welcomed change from all the ho hum Oktoberfest beers saturating the market today, although this is not a Marzen bier. This will probably be my go to fall beer henceforth."
""
""
""
"The taste follows the nose with sweet and some roasted malts, gritty lemongrass taste combined with a musty earthy dank taste, some fruit, maybe pear and a little gritty.  Sweet malts dominate. No real hop presence is detectable.  Overall a very good malty beer."
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  I wonder if this beer would get better if it sat a bit longer.  A great looking beer, but not as flavorful as I had hoped.  It does make me think of a beer good to have after working in autumn out in the fields, but not something particularly flavorful as advertised on the bottle.  One is enough and I don't feel a need for another."

"BOD 7/10/14.  Pours a hazy medium amber with an exceptional head, lacing and retention. Nice, but light, nose of sweet malt and Belgian yeast fruit (banana) over a light spice (clove).  Almost medium bodied with a nice slick mouthfeel.  Superb carbonation with a nice effervescent finish.  The flavor profile is a bit complex, superbly balanced and reasonably intense.  It begins with an effervescent rush of sweetness - biscuit malt and fruit - that yields to a mild bitterness.  As the bitterness fades, rye flavor and it's associated touch of spice come forward over a slightly phenolic note.  The finish is somewhat crisp, a bit dry and the light bitterness lingers over a light sweetness with a clove phenolic note.  Quite nice."
""
""
"O: 4.25 - This is a delightful new beer in the Ommegang lineup, one that really feels like Belgian craftsmanship, not just a Belgian yeast thrown at it."
"Funk, spice and grain aromas greet the nose. The beer pours slightly hazy copper amber, producing a huge 3” rocky, very persistent off white foam cap. Very fine and soft carbonation in combination with the rye, oats and wheat produces very big, clingy, clumpy lace. Big grain flavors dominate the palate with biscuit supporting rye spice, some rye/wheat tang, slight funk and some faint banana. Earthy hops come in at the end to complete this light, well rounded and well composed beer. The grains in this medium body beer provide a rich rye, wheat and oat texture with a little oat slickness."

"M: As the head implies, the beer has a strong carbonation which makes for a really great mouthfeel."

"O: A very solid beer worth trying; not the most complex Biere de Garde I've had but a very good introduction to the style"

"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, it felt like it was on the tamer side of a Biere De Garde with no tartness showing up, but it did have a fair amount of that malty aspect that I expect from the style.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, very crisp, slightly prickly, dry on finish, not foo filling and the taste did a nice job at holding at holding my attention, I think two would be my limit, any more than that and the higher carbonation might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both very nice and I thought they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was that the taste didn't seem as bold and bright as the aroma, I think that's the only thing I would want to change.  I might buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I for sure wouldn't turn one down.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes malty beers with Belgian yeast, it has some decent balance to it.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, with just a little work it could be a great beer though.  It's not my favorite beer from Brewery Ommegang and it isn't my favorite Biere De Garde, it falls right in the middle of the style.  Nice job guys this, this was a nice beer that fit well into the season, keep up the solid work."

"Pours a lightly hazy medium orange with big rocky cream colored head, sea foam chunks down the glass. Smell: whole grain bread, pils-y, mildly fruity with some unripe banana (no thanks) and suggestion of nectarine (more please). Mild earthiness. Taste: milk caramel, grainy and mildly grassy and spicy, muddled pear/banana mush, peach skin, spicy and grainy in the finish. Enjoyable."

"Overall: Definitely not what I was expecting.  Seeing Domaine DuPage on the side of this page got me excited for potential similarities with one of my all-time favorite beers.  But alas, this was something was different and in no way up my alley.  Ommegang rarely misses but this is one."

"Overall it's quite an impressive ale, delivering a brilliant combination of a Belgian-style ale with a maltier ""harvest"" ale, essentially creating a bit of a new style. But forget that, it's the richness of its character, and the balance that make it worth seeking out."

"Mouthfeel: Sprightly carbonation."

"Final Grade: 4.19, a very respectable A-. I can't profess to be an expert in this style (as I've had only one other biere de garde, and only a dozen or so saisons for that matter), but I knows what I likes, and Ommegang's Scythe & Sickle is one farmhouse-style ale that I am really digging. A great brew that all fans of pale Belgian styles and farmhouse ales should consider worth seeking out - and given the fact that this bottle is over a year old, it holds up quite nicely in the short-term, too. Kind of wish I'd bought six of them, now."

"This is a well-balanced ale, leaning slightly to the malt. It is just a little too malty to be really refreshing but is not bad at all."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours golden orange with a fluffy white head. Smells of wheat and slight Belgian yeast. Tastes of wheat and some sweet spiciness. Beer is heavily carbonated finishing nice with a light body. Overall a very good beer."
"Overall. I like it a lot. There are certainly good characters to it, and while it's lighter and less interesting on the palate that it ideally could be, it's certainly still flavoursome. A drinkable beer that retains its class."

"I tried to pour it to the exacting standards proscribed on the bottle but did not balance the the gentleness required to avoid upsetting the yeast with the vigor to evenly distribute the sediment and ended up with an impressively large head that had long lasting retention and released a pleasant bouquet that highlighted the unique combination of a surprisingly large variety of hops. I enjoyed the sweet taste yet there was a slightly astringent mouthfeel that I can only attribute to the presence of rye. An enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Sipping through the foamy top I find aggressive carbonation and a delicious, grainy body. Oats must provide the smoothness on the palate while rye provides a grainy bite. Lots of flavor here, but not a lot of hop bitterness. Nor excessive sweetness. But the yeast has developed some really great flavors of honey and cloves here. Would drink again."
"A decent Biere De Garde that even with it's rustic, spicy and complex grain bill, is a bit too sweet for my liking. The high level of carbonation is a bit too grating on my palate and really blows out a fair amount of the diverse grains."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Admittedly, beer reviewing is inherently a subjective thing. But trust me when I say that - objectively speaking - Ommegang is one of the best breweries when it comes to consistency and quality; they've displayed more integrity than arguably anybody else. They know what they're all about - brewing Belgian-style ales - and they continue to be the leader at doing so. Scythe & Sickle is in keeping with their prestigious reputation and excellent portfolio."

"This is an okay beer but very very yeasty the yeast seems to overpower the grain profile but it seems like the Brewers were trying to achieve"
"Pours medium amber, thick white foam. Very patchy. Fruity belgian yeast strain. Funky. Taste is a huge funk, hearty malt hop, peppery finish. Clumsy malt, all over the place. Hope hold throughout. Pretty good."

"Sour flavor but with plenty of spice notes in the background. Lightly hopped to give it a more malty feel. Not as dry as most rye beers. Moderate body but with a very high carbonation level. The aftertaste has elements of milk and a bit of sour-bitterness."

""
""
""
""
""

"O- Finally, a Biere de garde I can get down with. I'm just not sure if I like it because it's brewed true to style or not true."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium coppery amber with a fine two finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of bready, slightly toasted malt, stone fruit, root spices, mild citrus, intriguing. Rich flavor of bready malt, cinnamon, rye, cloves, graham cracker, dark and light stone fruit, spicy and earthy. Finishes spicy with a mild hop bitterness and more of the tart saison yeast character I'd expect for the style. Nice creamy medium body with excellent mouth feel. A pleasant, very tasty fall beer that leans in the direction of a winter warmer in character, if not ABV. If this is a biere de garde, I will have to reevaluate the style, which I've been avoiding after some over bretty, dry ones. I liked this very much and will get some more for the holidays."
""
""

"Poured from a 12oz. bottle to a pint glass. Pours an amber/orange with a nice head that sticks for a bit with decent lacing. Smells of citrus - lemon, orange, maybe grapefruit. Tastes wondeful. Sweet up front with a citrus taste after. Drinks very smooth and despite being billed as a ""fall beer"" I would gladly drink on a summer day"
""
""
""
"Overall this is yummy, did not pickup originally then I found out it was a Bière de Garde and I went back and got some, love this style very nice brew."
"Pours a dark slightly murky gold with a huge head. Lots of lacing. Phenolic and earthy yeasty smell. Great complex grainy taste. You can definitely pick out the sour rye. And there is a bit of pronounced wheat character as well. Bananas and cloves. Obviously barley. What is there to say about barley- what you're used to, toasty in this case. The oats are less noticeable but make their presence known a little bit in the mouthfeel. Lots of yeast characteristics too. Earth and fruit. Some bitterness from hops- maybe a little roasted malt bitterness too? Pretty fantastic. Well carbonated and full bodied. Drinkability is fairly low. This is a sipper, not a session beer. Strong and heavy. And I know fall beers should probably be sessionable.... oktoberfests etc. But still, this is an awesome fall beer. I'd like to have some of these on a cool night around a camp fire. I'm actually tempted to try something like this as a homebrew. Memorable and great overall."

"Excellent excellent! Scythe & Sickle is the type of high quality I've come to expect from Ommegang, perhaps the USA's best Belgian-style brewer. Along with Leann Follain and Firestone Pivo, this trio are three new (to me) excellent beers which I've tasted in the last two weeks which are easy to obtain and don't require a golden ticket."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The flavor has a nice malt quality which brings a mild toasted flavor when combined with the yeast. There is a slight fruit tinge from the yeast which brings a mild date-like dried fruit and tropical aspect. The hops are mild and the flavor of alcohol is mild but there is a slight phenolic almost metallic hint which isn't too noticeable, but there and the dryness of the finish is practically to the bone with the extremely high carbonation which is almost seltzer like with a mineral carbonic quality. Overall I enjoyed this a lot and it is very good for the style, I would definitely drink it again"
""
""
""
""
"Taste of semi tart Belgian yeast, malt, toast and citrus. Lemon pith, dusty yeast phenols, little alcohol flavor. Somewhat hoppy, woodsy and earthy flavor comes forth. Medium bodied feel with a high drying carbonation. Overall this is a very good ale."
""
"While not a session beer, this would be easy to get rid of in a sitting since it only came in 4-packs. While part of the Duvel family of beers, something like this almost needs to take that relationshop and turn it onto its head. Duvel should be part of the Ommegang family of beers, as this was better than its European counterparts and pushed the limits of what's possible as an Autumn Seasonal. Pleasant surprises are why I drink so many new beers and this was no exception - this was well worth seeking out and a joy in every sense of the word and most importantly, proof that Ommegang's best offerings don't necessarily come in big bottles. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O: So, this is farmhouse Biere-de-garde? Ommeagang delivers a solid 1-2 and this is extremely good beer. Me likey."
"Similar quality to other Ommegang beers: well made, bold complex taste, and full flavor."

"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into globe glass. Pours amber-orange in color, cloudy, thick white head. Scents of bananas, bready malts, caramel, a little pepper. Typical yeasty Belgian flavor, banana, clove, pepper, some hop bitterness. It's described as an amber ale; definitely not your typical example. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly dry, with heavy carbonation. It's good but I'm not catching the autumn beer tie-in."
""
""
""
"Overall: This an exceptionally well crafted beer that is very suitable for the Fall season. I really should give this an even higher score, but it doesn't do enough to truly grab my attention."
"OK, I'd buy it again. Some squash and spice flavors are developing as it warms."

"Overall: A pleasant, sessionable, and fruity beer with mild complexity. Solid and tasty, though a bit fruit-forward for the style. More emphasis on the malt would have made this more of a Biere de Garde, in my opinion."

"Overall: Very good. Very drinkable but offers a pleasant complexity as well."

"(4.0) D: Considering the lower ABV this is a very flavourful and well crafted harvest ale."
"Deep burnt orange in color with hints of brown with the expected belgian murkiness. Poured with a huge frothy foam with good retention that left tons of sticky lacings on the glass. Grainy malt and belgian yeast aromas with tart fruitiness in the background. On the lighter side of medium bodied with aggressive carbonation. Earthy, grainy malt fla or uo front with a hint of rye. Belgian yeast flavors through the middle followed by slighty tart under-ripe banana toward the end. Finishes with a hint of rye and lingering belgian yeast aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is a little bit on the thinner side although not thin enough to be swallowed like water but the drinkability is very high on this one. Perfect end of September, going into October seasonal beer. The pumpkin after-taste sets the mood for a great fall season. Would definitely recommend this to those wanting to try a different beer this upcoming season."

"Overall: A surprisingly complex beer; I didn't love it but enjoyed trying to wrap my mind around it"
"Overall very unique and interesting brew."
""

"*I figured I must've been mistaken, as the beer falls just shy of 6%. How could that light of a beer have such a prominent alcohol note? Apparently this is the norm for the style. ...I looked it up."
""
""
"Cloudy amber golden with with some head, decent retention and good lacing. Smells a little peachy and bready. Taste reminds me of Anchor Steam initially, but with a little note of honey; then a nutmeg/cinnamon taste comes on pretty strong, before fading without much dryness."
""
""
"Flavors are supple and complimentary, specialty grains and an understated hop character that lends some light bitterness. Mildly toasty with a brief hint of sweetess upfront, moving into a dry finish with a Duvel yeast aftertaste. Overall it was good, though not wildly unique."
""
"Ommegang has hit an absolute home run with this style. It's French in character and complex in delivery. Just enough earthiness really sells its taste but still its not as charming or distinctive as in could be. More straw character, higher dryness and even (dare I say) a pep of butter could really round this thing out!"
""
""

"Overall this is a wonderful and fascinating beer that seems to tell a story with its characteristics."
""
""
"Really good ale, especially good flavor and flavor balance. Very enjoyable and worth trying."
""

"Flavorful, rousing, deep, complex but also simple in it's approach, stylish and pretty. Ommegang hasn't disappointed me yet."

"Overall: First opening this beer i was pretty excited. I've been a pretty big fan of the brewery lately and enjoyed a lot of their releases. This beer didn't disappoint one bit. First noticeable aromas were the grainy and offers a different and bold alternative to all the pumpkin beers about to hit the market. I enjoyed this and was satisfied to try it out. I will have again and will definitely recommend to a friend. Cheers!"

"O- A very nice Belgian-style take on a fall brew, would pair well with a large, Thanksgiving style meal."

"Pours a dark hazy orange with a large beige head, some lacing. Aroma and taste of sweet caramel malt, some earthy spicy rye and fruity notes, yeast and lightly toasted barley. Palate is a medium body with sweet spices and good carbonation. Finishes with sweet malt, spicy fruity notes, rye, yeasty and bready notes with some spicy hops bitterness on the end for balance.

"O: Another great and complex Belgian-style ale from Ommegang. This is a perfect pairing for the Thanksgiving dinner, next time it comes around that is. I consumed this beer out of season, but not out of code. It would make an excellent compliment to a hearty meal on a cool fall day, but it is still very enjoyable even on a warm day in late spring. It's also a welcome change of pace from the mediocre ambers and octoberfests that flood the market in the fall."

"O: This is an ideal brew for the fall season. Will definitely seek this out when it's re-released"
"This may be the first time I've sampled this style. Solid brew. A fresh addition to the harvest ale collection. Similar to some other styles but different enough to be its own. Will be sampling more of this style for sure."

"This one pours a medium bodied and very smooth cloudy amber in color with a two finger, bright white and creamy two finger head. The nose is soft with nice spicing, moderate dark fruit, some malty sweetness, and Belgian yeast. It kind of smells like a smaller, spicier Dubbel. The flavors are spicy and fruit forward upfront, with a lot of fig and date influence. Ot almost has an old fashioned cola like flavor as well. There is a slight yeast character but it isn't as dominant as in some of the other Ommegang beers, which probably serves this one best. It drinks medium in body and off dry. It has nice flavor and is a standout for a Biere de Garde in my opinion. At 5.8% this is a Belgian ale capable of drinking a few of. Overall this is a fine Biere de Garde and a very nice interpretation of the style with unique spicing. If you're a fan of dubbels this would be right up your alley."

"Pleasant satisfying brew. A small retained head. Above average mouthfeel. Good drinkability, a meal in itself. Moderately yeasty. Very good for the style, reminds me of some Three Floyds creations. Satisfying. Slight edgy tartness. Suitably carbonated. Dry finish."
"Poured into tulip glass. Appearance is a dark gold with nice clarity. 2 fingers of pillowy white head upon pour with dissipates to a thin layer that sticks around nicely. Heavy lacing left behind. The nose starts with bread and yeast quality with some Belgian farmhouse quality. Candied lemon and light acidic notes come through. Taste is bright and fruity with floral esters, lemon, orange, and sugar. Towards the end there is a slight tartness with a somewhat bready finish. Mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation. Decent offering of the style, plenty of clean flavors."

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, creating a fizzy, crisp beer that foams up somewhat on the palate, remaining crisp, but developing a smoother mouthfeel as the duration of the sip increases. Closes semi-dry, with very little stickiness remaining on the palate."
"All in all, a solid lighter-ABV Belgian ale. Another quality brew from Ommegang."
"Picked up a single from EuroMarket for about $3. It's poured orange-amber with little floaties and a long-lasting white head. The beer is surprisingly dry and bitter, but I guess that's appropriate. There's a big spicy, peppery finish with orange peel and light caramel up front. The aroma is fruitier with a little pear and apricot over doughy grain and toast. It is an earthy, herbal Belgian, and it really needs to warm to cellar temp for the edgier notes to balance out. It's certainly interesting, but I might not want to go through an entire 6-pack. Still, glad I tried it."

"Poured a clearish gold with reddish tints with a solid head and lace combo. Earthy, piney, wet resiny hops are prevalent and so is the rye malt. Bready as well, getting very little sweetness and wheaty, yeast tones but they're in there. Light to medium bodied, with a mix taste of the rye that gives it a fuller body and that bready edge as well, along with some fluffy yeast and floral hops as well as mild sweetness. Easy passing beer that hits all the notes and is a great beer to session as well."

"Overall, it's a decent amber but a bit uninteresting and pricey at $11 per 4 pack."

"This is a decent beer. I wouldn't go out of my way for this beer, but if it is on tap or on a menu I would try it out."

"This is a cozy beer, suitable for cuddling on a cool night by the fire. The autumn season is captured in this bottle."
""
"Very attractive pour... Glowey deep orange color with a bountiful foamy head. Good retention + nice clumpy lace. Aroma is crisp malt and fruit. Apples, honey-like, fresh grains, and floral notes. Very pleasant sniffing. Flavors are good as well. Refreshing, fruity, lightly phenolic, and plenty of fresh toasty cracker malts. Body is a solid medium. Good carbonation prickle combined with a dry and ever-so-slightly gritty texture make for a delightful mouthfeel. I enjoy this."
""
"Clear amber-gold with a lovely, thick, frothy head that drops to a lovely, lumpy topping. Soft, doughy malt and flowery hops, mild toasted caramel, and earthiness in the aroma. Dry, earthy, malty, almost nutty flavor...apple, spicy phenols, citrus peel, and light herbal characteristics. Medium-plus bodied, drying, and crisp. Pretty nice, as usual, from Ommegang..."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy dark golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, malty, some fruits. Taste is delicious. Fruits, spice, mats, loaded with flavor, complex and refreshing. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a high quality beer."
""
"I appreciate the use of rye in this but I wish the yeast and rye were a bit louder. it's almost to clean for my liking but obviously its and very well made beer just a bit lackluster imo"
""

"O: Overall grainy, toasty, yeasty, and of course cleanly brewed providing for multiples."
""
"This tastes a lot like a Belgian Tripel without the citrus zing. It has more of a sweet caramel malt start with pepper and cloves playing up the rear and lingering momentarily on the palate. I am not sure if I would call it a harvest ale but it is quite tasty no matter how you define it."
""
"overall... a superb try. it's a great brew to sample, but not one i am going to session. but then, i dont session anything anymore except samplers.... so i'm going with giving this one a score of 94 overall due to the pour and the taste. glad i tried it; will recommend it to others...."

"Beer pours a partly cloudy light caramel color with a tall off-white persistent head. Chunky lacing. Besides the aroma of the Belgian yeast, the predominant aromas are apricot, clove, white pepper and a touch of baseball glove leather. The taste is mildly sweet, but more fruity sweetness than sugar sweetness. Mildly tart and softly bitter. Medium-bodied. The grains show up in the finish, although I would say the taste is more of raw grain than cooked or roasted. Clean finish. The texture is soft. Body is medium. Medium carbonation. A pleasant beer that really tastes at around 55 degrees F. A very approachable brew from one of my favorite American breweries."
""
""
"Overall: This to me tastes like an above average to average slightly sweet biere de garde. Not much stands out to me about this. Yes it is good and I would not turn it down, however I will not rush out to get another either."
""

"Pours a fairly clear cararmel-colored amber with a two finger bright white pillowy head. Everlasting retention and thick, coating lacing. Wonderful nose, rich Belgian yeast, whole-grain biscuit, light spice, and a hint of caramel sweetness. Opens with wheat, oats, freshly harvested grain joined by toffee with just a hint of light butter, rich yeasty esters and hint of light fruit, lightly sweet appleskin specifically, Pleasant light spice and mildly spicy rye. Light to light medium body that feigns heavier at times; pleasant tantalizing carbonation. Slick and silky mouthfeel with a surprising touch of light creaminess. This really is a fantastic brew. So subtlely complex and balanced, a true pleasure to drink. Ommegang adds another amazing beer to an already exceptional lineup of offerings."
"This isn't too bad. It's mostly like a hoppier trippel. I would have loved to see more rye in here."
"Cloudy amber body, bubbly off-white head. Banana aromas dominate. Flavors are bitter fruits, a little earthy. Thin film retains and leaves some soapy head around the interior of the glass. No complaints about the carbonation or body, and I love the bitter residuals left behind."

"Overall (4.0): Honestly, I’m tempted to bump this up to 4.5—but it’s not near-perfect. It’s more like a 4.25, overall. Very smooth, with more complexity and depth than anticipated for the size of the beer, and its composition is very nicely done for the style. I could see this being an excellent pairing for a wide variety of foods. Very tasty, and worth picking up if you like ambers and / or Ommegang’s yeastiness. And evidently, that includes me."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Good overall balance and complexity. Like the rye."
""
"This is just another really good beer from Ommegang. Very reminiscent of a Belgian Pale Ale. It's a classic example of what they're all about. Great beer."
"O: Not the most familiar with style. Taste like a pale ale with a Belgian influence and a lighter body than an APA. Enjoyable, recommend to break someone into Belgian beer."
""
""
""
"Not sure I get this one. Nice color, coppery reddish. Not much head, foamy, a little lacing. Lots of malt aroma and taste, some citrus, hops kind of laid back. Get the bready taste, not too much carbonation yet slightly refreshing. Good drinker for a Fall afternoon, but I don’t find anything special about it. Perfectly good product, though."

"A bit of a toss up if I could recommend this brew... It's distracting in appearance and mouthfeel, but it's nose and flavors draw you back for the next sip. This brew could stand to be better blended, but it is refreshing once the carbonation has died down."
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some earthy, grassy, and herbal aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight herbal bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Overall - another great offering from Ommegang!"
"Overall - Maybe just a tad too tart/dry. I'd like some more fruity notes.. but it's still another winner from this brewer. However next time I'd reach for some of their other brews."

"Complex, refreshing, rustic, and earthy. A new favorite by a favorite brewery."
"Browned orange, with a finger of white head. Good retention and moderate lace. Nose is yeasty, faint citrus, spice and a some bready/biscuity character. Taste has crackery/biscuity malt flavours, yeasty, spice, light citrus, some malt sweetnesss and bitter-ish herbal hopping in the finish. Medium light body, medium high carbonation. Simple and flavourful, I'd have this again easily."

"This beer poured out as a nice looking orange amber color with a haziness to it. The retention on this beer is pretty good as well as some lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer gives off some earthy malt and yeast aromas, some subtle hops aromas as well. The taste of the beer is malty, some interesting grain flavors in there with some hints of caramel and bitter hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, very drinkable with a good carbonation. Overall it's a good brew, not my favorite from Ommegang but still a good beer to try."

"Pours a golden amber with an annoying huge frothy off white head. Lots of effervescence and good lacing. Belgian yeats stands out in the aroma giving off some spiciness (good dose of clove particularly) and just a tease of some bubble gum, some rye and oats is also there to cut into the spiciness of the yeast. Flavor seems super simple yet there seems to be some interesting depth behind it, which I know makes no sense but no clue how else to describe it. Belgian yeast giving off some of that spiciness, the rye and oats offering some graininess and a bit of a bitter and peppery finish. Good stuff. A lighter mouthfeel with a ton of prickly carbonation, not sure I need that much carbonation. Overall, a very nice beer. Very sessionable, glad I gave it a shot."

"O: This was OK. It was anything spectacular and pretty straight forward."

"O-The caramel and grassy notes make for a fall beer but the watery, poorly carbonated mouthfeel was a major turnoff."

"I didn't care so much for this at first sip, but it is hard to find fault once you slip into the flavors and seductive sudsiness. From the four-pack bought at Best Damn Beer Store in San Diego."
"Scythe & Sickle is a nice fall beer. I like it. Its strong earthy, grainy, and bread-like flavors combine to make a really nice flavor and are very reminiscent of the fall season. It’s good stuff. If it lacks anything, it’s flash. I happen to like that about it. Definitely worth grabbing if you see it."

"Overall, I'm really impressed with this beer. I think it would be a good anytime, anywhere beer. Flavor is something I'm sure I have had numerous times before, but everything else brings it up."
""
""
"O-I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I did not find a ton of exotic fruit or herbs, and nobody will mistake it for a hop bomb IIPA or monster quad, but the oats, rye, etc. worked to produce a complex and interesting enough beer to drink on its own or, as I did, with some dinner. I also found it pretty quaffable...you could have more than one. All in all, a nice surprise."

"A very interesting Harvest Ale and a fitting nod to the various grains of the harvest and the ways in which they can be combined. Skillfully brewed and a joy to drink."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/2/2012. Pours a hazy orange copper color with an awesome 3 finger fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, orange, pear, grass, pepper, herbal, clove, biscuit, rye, nuttiness, earth, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with great complexity and balance. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, biscuit, rye, herbal, floral, pepper, earth, clove, and yeast spiciness. Light bit of peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, herbal, floral, biscuit, rye, pepper, clove, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; with no cloying on the finish at all. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Biere De Garde! Great balance and complexity of flavors; very smooth a crisp to drink. Highly enjoyable offering."
"Scythe and Sickle pours out an orange color with one of the nicer heads I've seen in a while. The aroma is spicy, earthy, and yeasty, with the Belgian yeasts and the rye working together. The taste is heavy on the yeast at first, perhaps too heavy, but it's quickly balanced out by the fantastic spicy, earthy, and grainy malts used here. There's a strong complexity of malts that's really something, but I think the yeast is a little too strong here. Not a major flaw, this is still a very good beer. The mouthfeel is lighter and a little confused, it's a bit sticky yet drying. The drinkability is solid. Overall, an interesting take on the Fall seasonal beer that is really close to greatness. As it is now, it's still quite good, but could be superb with just a little more refinement on the yeast character."
"Notes: Very tasty a little bit like a Tripel but not as many alcohol notes. Cheers."
""
""
"O: This beer just works in spite of how hard it is to categorize and pick apart. This beer's finesse and moderate complexity helps it rise above the average marzen-cum-pumpkin ale."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry and fruity Belgian yeast scent that compliments a pale malt dominated aroma. It's brewed with wheat, oats and rye as well which aids in the light and spicy character. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth and easy drinking malt flavor that goes down quick and finishes with dry, fruity yeast character. The rye adds depth in the taste while contributing a spicy flavor that works well with Belgian yeast. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent harvest ale, but nothing too exceptional."
""
"a very very unique beer, hopelessly underrated here on BA. it pours a murky orange color, somewhere between brass and tangerine, with a bold white lace on top a few inches tall. it smells very fruity. not sure if its fruit juice or if its from the yeast, but it takes on an almost tropical vibe. the flavor is way more hoppy than i expected. maybe one of the hoppiest ommegang beers ive had. its bitter citric hops and they are all in the finish. the yeast provides some musty fruit tones, while the malt offers a late hay harvest flavor. mouthfeel is fantastic, its velvet when you drink it, with very bright but round carbonation, not prickly at all. finish is long and complex, contemplative. i had this at the cheeky monk on colfax last night, and i suggest you get down there for a glass of this before its gone!"
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. I get a lot of grain notes in the aroma, with a hint of yeast and some grass. The flavor is fairly dry with a lot of the husky grain notes. I also get some grass and earth from the hops as well as some spices and some yeast. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"12oz bottle, pours amber with a tall, slightly off-white fluffy head, great retention & amazing lacing down the glass. Aromas are filled with nice fruity overtones from the Belgian yeast with banana, spice, earthiness. Tastes are earthy, nice Belgian estery fruitiness, banana, orange rind, spicy rye, grain. Mouth-feel is medium, very smooth; perfect carbonation, which allows flavors to dance onthe palate. Overall, excellent offering from Ommegang. I would pick this up again if I came across it. Downfall is that it was rather pricy."
""
"D - Not great, there is a harsh, medicinal note that covers everything else and really hurts the drinkability. The malt character is bland and the yeast just doesn't work, which means the beer doesn't have much going for it."
"Toasted grains and herbal bitterness up front. Soft wheat sweetness, bananas, and cloves follow. Spicy, rye-ish notes combine with more herbal bitterness toward the finish. Yeasty, with lingering wheat malt. Medium body with a creamy, oaty feel. Nice."

"A great Belgian style Amber Ale. Tons of malts; bready and grainy. Also has a really nice Belgian yeast character."

"12 oz bottle, thank you samp01 for sharing. Pours hazy orange with a long lasting, foamy, white head and a lot of lacing. Aroma is of yeast, spices, hops, bready malt and hint of pears. Body is full and tangy. Yeast, spicy rye, herbal hops, caramel and bready malt, some fruit combine on the palate. Finish is long and spicy. Delicious, complex brew."
""
"Overall a very nice beer, served on a very cool bar. Would definitely try again."
"This is just an excellent, understated and subtle example of the style. Once again Ommegang hits it out of the park. I can't believe I used to think these guys were overrated. Well done all around."
"Good beer from a style I generally don't like. I brewed a roggenbier last year that was pretty similar to this, I wonder if Ommegang used a wheat yeast?"
""
""
"pour is dark orangish amber with tons of creamy off white head leaving a fair amount of lace. Nose has a sweet lemony base to it with a fair bit of spice underlying the lemony sweetness. Notes of tangy yeast towards the back with a soapy hop accompanying. Taste is a bit less integrated with the sweetness strong, the spice lingers in the finish with notes of rye bread in the back. There are some golden fruit notes intertwined throughout. Body is medium, soft and smooth, nice carbonation, and semi dry."
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours hazy copper with a tall white head and numerous tiny bubbles in the beer. The head dissipates slowly. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are prominent fruit ester aromas. I pick up apple and citrus. There's some spice, which is a little peppery. It smells more like a saison. The taste follows the nose. I pick up some of the bready malt with that apple and citrus flavor. There's that peppery spice in the background that could be coming from the rye. It's definitely tasting like a saison as well as smelling like one. The body is light with strong carbonation. The finish is smooth and sticky. The aftertaste just coats to the mouth for a little while. This is a very good beer."
""
"Overall, a truly amazing and complex beer. I should have expected this from Ommegang but I am truly impressed. There really is a lot going on in this beer and I encourage everyone to seek it out."

"Definitly a departure from standard fall brews and better actually too."

"Say what you will about this beer. I love Ommegang, but I wasn't gunning for this to be a superb beer before I tried it. What really sells me is the attention to detail, complexity, and ability to be simultaneously soft but remarkably flavorful and deep."
"Seems a little redundant... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper-tinged tawny topped by a finger or so of light tan foam. The nose comprises sweet biscuit, light toffee, sweet flowers, clove, a hint of cocoa, light grass, and a pinch of brown sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some cracked wheat, light Belgian yeast, honey (a lovely bit of graham cracker character going on here), light vanilla bean, faint orange zest, and a dash of black pepper. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. Overall, a surprisingly highly enjoyable brew, one that shows what can be done with a variety of grains when they're tamed into working harmoniously with a classic yeast strain. Very nice."

"I find this to be a terrific beer. I could really drink this one year round. Haven't been a big fan of many of the Ommegang brews I've had in the past, but this one is wonderful. Great surprise for me."

"Scythe & Sickle caught my interest as soon as I saw it, but I was reluctant to pull the trigger on the 4 pack. After picking up a single bottle, I'm starting to think I should have picked up more."
"I think this beer will age out very well. I would cellar this one for a bit to smooth out the bitterness and alcohol."
"Overall: One of the biggest surprises for me in months. Just a great beer, and very well suited for the fall season."

"Cool new lables and cool new brews from Ommegang.Poured into my Ommegang chalice a brilliant a deep orange infused lighter amber with a spot on one finger white crown that left multiple chunks of lace behind as it settles into a soapy-like mass atop.Toasted grain notes in the nose along with light phenols and a hint of pepper,light aromas but decnet enough.The toasted grain comes out again on the palate with a little phenolic yeastiness and a faint shot of spice from the rye.I think this is a good alternative to the pumpkin and Oktoberfest fall beers out there,it's not in your face with big flavors but a smooth easy drinking table beer.I could drink alot of this."

"O: An excellent change-of-pace style from the glut of Marzens, pumpkin ales and ""Oktoberfests"" that flood the market this time of year. That said, I'm not thinking Biere de Garde so much as I am Belgian Pale Ale here, but it's still a quality beer nonetheless. The 5.8% ABV is very sessionable and the delicate, fruity and floral flavors teased from the carefully handled grains shines a spotlight on the craft that went into this brew."
"O: An interesting beer. I like biere de gardes, and it's nice that Ommegang put it in a 12 oz. bottle, so this didn't cost $10 to try, they should do that for all their releases."
"Poured from a 12 oz, bottle. Had a bottle of this on my trip back to CT. Pours a bubbly golden color, nice floral aroma. Medium bodied, nice creamy mouthfeel. Floral notes come out, very smooth and well balanced. Nice solid beer, a good change of pace from the usual seasonals."
""
""
"Overall, this is a fairly decent beer but nothing too exciting. The phenolic spiciness and husky astringency becomes a bit grating after awhile and I am greatly missing the complex grain bill that is advertised because the yeast phenols overshadddow the flavor profile."
""
""
""
"This is a superb looking beer. The head stands tall and firm three to four fingesr plus. One and a half above the rim of my Long Trail Brewmaster Series glass. Very slow fade leaves a ton of lace and a thick covering. Mostly clear light brown with orange hues and some carbonation activity in the glass. Smell is sweet with fruity Belgian yeast esters and bready malt. Some light floral hops and bit of overripe banana. Spicy notes from the rye carry some pepper and faint cinnamon. Roasted grains throughout with caramel malt and light toffee. Taste is like a fall version of Rare Vos. Deep roasted grain maltiness with a dark fruit sweetness yields to a Belgian yeast with earth and an herbal hop bitterness that is delicate but firm. Lots of toffee and caramel wrapped in mutigrain dough. Spicy pepper cinnamon and clove .Finish is clean and dry with a light leafiness lingering in the mouth.just a touch of astringency that dries the mouth nicely. Feel is velvety with a coating carbonation that gives a soft crispness and overall quenching quality. Goes down so easily you find yourself at the end of the glass in seconds it seems. This is in my short ist of most memorable beers I have had this year. A great beer for any occasion and a perfect compliment to any seasonal food."
""
"O-this is actually just an awesome beer. I rarely get a well done variation of a Belgian style by an American brewery. It even tastes like it is from Belgium. Good tastes like this are rare at a decent price."
""
""
"O- A tasty beer worthy trying but probably won't pick it up again."
"Coriander (really, Ommegang, enough with the coriander already) is extremely prominent in the flavor, it's the first thing I pick out and it is the most persistant flavor well through the finish. There is a nice drying spiciness on the finish too. Loads of carbonation and a light mouthfeel make this relatively hard to drink just because it foams up on your palate so much. Its alright over-all, I wish the flavor delivered what the aroma promised."
""
"Overall pretty good, nice Belgian dark ale, typical flavors, nicely done, it keeps wanting to be heavier with more booze but the booze never comes, and I kinda want it to now. Maybe a double version of this for winter would be perfect."

"Orange bronze in color with a thick rocky head. Tons of lacing around the glass as well. The nose is soft with lots of floral tones and light citrus hops. There's a good amount of wheat as well giving it a sorta dryness. Wheat and citrus upfront in the taste with a mild caramel sweetness that starts off in the middle and carries to the end. Simple but very tasty. The mouth feel is extremely soft with pleasant carbonation. Overall a really great beer. It's very drinkable. Not terrible complex but it has just enough character to keep the palate interested."
"Overall these guys made quite a good beer. Sure it's not as sessionable as say the BPA but its still one smooth dark ale with great wheat character. And to those who think the alcohol is heavy and cloying, man up!"

"O. A bit too heavy on the alcohol taste. It's OK, but could use some aging."
"M- Light to medium body, good carbonation with a slightly sticky finish."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. This pours a hazy golden color with a massive foamy white head which has good retention. The smells are of fruity yeast esters, banana, grass hops. The feel is medium high carbonation. The taste is pretty good some yeast esters, a little grass hops, some ripe fruit."
"I believe the style listed for the beer might be steering people in the wrong direction. This beer is more saison or farmhouse than any other style. Tastes like a Belgian Ardennes yeast, but has a bit of saison-y pepper to it."
"o - overall, i'm an admitted ommegang fanboy and this was a nice surprise based on the mixed reviews. i enjoyed it thoroughly. distinct ommegang flavors and characteristics...belgian dark it is not...at least not a good take on that style so i think that must be incorrect, but as a beer from ommegang, not their best, but far from their worst. this is a tasty brew and if you like ommegang in general, you will probably dig this...if you don't like ommegang you will probably not like this as it really carries a lot of their vibe."
""
"Seems more like a Bière de Garde, but it's not tasty enough for me to care if the listing gets revisited."
"O: This is an enjoyable beer if you like something malty with Belgian yeast and some spicy rye. It’s not that difficult to drink and packs in a lot of flavors."
""
"Overall a tasty and unique Belgian inspired ale."
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a light red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, graham cracker, grain, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, grain, earth, graham cracker, and spice. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation that was almost chewy. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. Graham cracker? Where did this come from? While I was rather surprised to see this aspect come forward it just didn’t seem like it belonged with the rest of the brew. The flavor was really pretty average for the style though as it didn’t really stand out at all for me. I was hoping for a little more if I am honest, but was slightly letdown by this fact. Not sure if I would suggest this one to others, but it does make a good tick."
"O: A good, easy drinking beer with interesting Belgian-type yeasty flavors. Solid."
""
"Overall – Not amazing, but very good, easy drinking, I like the hop dimension as it complements the Belgian yeast flavor. I could drink several of these without a problem."
"Slightly hazy pour, amber color, with a sturdy, foamy, white head; nice retention and lacing. Aroma of biscuity malts and sugar, spice and undertones of fruity esters. Similar taste, sweet malts and a dab of honey, clove, notes of banana and dried stone fruits, toasted grains, herbal hops; a touch medicinal. About medium in body, moderate carbonation. Not a bad beer, but nothing really memorable here."

"A bit underwhelming in the mouth, though the bread and yeast flavor is certainly pleasing. There's just not enough of it. A light sweetness escorts the ghostly hop bitterness, like a quiet couple everyone likes milling around at a party though from whom no one expects remarkable conversation."

"O: This is an uneven beer. I certainly would not classify it as a Belgian Dark Ale (actually, I don't know what I'd classify it as). A decent beer, but not spectacular."

"O - Quite refreshing, bottled on 07/25/12"

"Overall not sure if I would consider this an American Amber, much to belgian to be in the same category as other reds. Very balanced and easy drinking, but not sure if I would seek this out."

"Overall: The phenolic spiciness and husky astringency becomes a bit grating after awhile. Pass."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being above average. Overall, it was a pretty good beer. They really highlighted the rye flavors nicely, which I really liked. Everything else came together pretty well and it felt pretty balanced and flavorful overall."

"Pretty good as are most I've tried from these guys."
"Not the most sexy style of brew but this is a well crafted and quality new offering from Omme."
"O: a decent beer, certainly easy drinking, anything from Ommegang is probably worth trying"

"D- good drinkability."
"I like this as a ""harvest"" fall beer. brings in many different grains and all are discernibly present with none taking over a dominant position. The Belgian Ommegang yeast seems out of place at first, but it melds together the more I get through the bottle. Not my style, but a decent quaff nonetheless."

"Quite an enjoyable beer. My comment now is I am going to get another. Recommend you do the same. Thanks Ommegang for another delicious treat."
"O - This was a tasty, sessionable beer and overall I was glad that I gave it a try. But, with all of the other tasty seasonal beers that are out right now at this price point, I probably won't be re-visiting this anytime soon."

"Very tasty brew, kind of an amber saison or a yeasty biere de garde. Another winner from Ommegang."
"O- Nice beer, I'll be looking for this again next fall. Interesting and the 5.8% ABV makes it an easy drinker. If you run across this give it a try."
"O: I enjoyed this beer, I do recommend you buy it as soon as possible and drink it as soon as possible. It will probably lose its muster as it sits on the shelf. I need to visit this brewery."
