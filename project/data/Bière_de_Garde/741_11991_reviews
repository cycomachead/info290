"Overall:  Not sure exactly what the brewer was going for here but, as others said, it really doesn't fit the classic biere de garde profile; still, it is not a bad beer, it is just that the sweetness cuts the drinkability"

"Rendezvous pours a bright reddish color with a small lacing head. There is a oaky and sweet aroma, with wine like notes. The taste is the same, a nice wine like oak flavor, sweeter overall. Very nice body, great carbonation, love the feel, and stronger flavor. Overall its a nice beer, some nice flavors, a little too sweet."

"This is not a Biere de Garde. Not even close. Imagine a really bad Vienna lager and this is it. This one is going down the drain. Total disappointment."
"DATE TASTED: December 22, 2013... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter...OCCASION: fantasy football championships on the line... APPEARANCE: dark reddish-brown glistening body; uneven white head; steady bubble with hazy smears of lacing--not unattractive... AROMA: bright, malty presence; yeasty bouquet--fresh and floral--decently balanced... PALATE: warming, unexpectedly creamy body; aftertaste affords more than the ""fleeting experience"" the label foretells--and the aftertaste is not one to hold on to...TASTE: a cinnamon, slightly medicinal/syrupy experience--surprisingly not what a bier de garde is supposed to be; astringent wine-like red blushes the pallet late; a struggle to chew, let alone enjoy ... OVERALL: bad bombers really disappoint, and though this beer kindles winter spirits with a firewater kind of fever, this truly resembles no b.d.g. I've had before..."

"Overall, this is okay, but I don't think it's in its prime to begin with, and I'm not convinced it really has the chops to be good even when fresh. Still, it's nice to have tried it at least."

"A decent interpretation of a style that has a relatively wide range of interpretations. It paired well with the veal meatloaf I had ordered."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body with high carbonation and a dry finish."
""
"O- I like a good malty Belgian ale but this one lacks the complexity to keep the sweetness below the cloying level."
""

"I'm not that familiar with the style, but from what I understand, this was a good representation. Kept me interested, grew on me as it warmed."

"overall.... eh, it's alright. tastes kind of 'forced'; kind of 'thin'. i gave it all 4's because it's not a bad drink but it's not my preference. i feel the higher alcohol is forced and is what gives it the twang. and it's definitely not as 'crafty' as some of the other breweries i've had. it seems to be special, or different, only in that it's a different style, but nothing here is adventurous."
"Overall a pretty decent beer. I like mxing it up with some of the more unusual styles, like Biere de Garde. This one worked pretty well with my wife's goulash."
"Medium bodied with a bitter earthy hop bite that lingers over the sweet malt backbone and funky farmhouse yeast into a very dry finish. Very dry and resinous with sticky pine needle, grass and spicy spruce tip flavor dominating the palate. Underneath, there is a decent malt backbone with hints of bread, toffee, caramel and biscuit but these notes are overwhelmed by the aggressive hop presence. The farmhouse character from the aroma is very faint and barely noticeable with everything else going on. There is some light fruit sweetness toward the finish but it still feels like its lacking in balance because of the earthy bitterness."

"A cloudy orange pour with a tall white head. Opens with a light fruitiness on the nose. Quite a bit of bread with a touch of caramel, butterscotch, and cardboard. Moderate yeast aroma, maybe a little fruit. The flavor is fairly sweet and malty as well. Lots of bread, caramel, and toffee with some of the same cardboard notes that were present on the nose. Not really a fan of this one."

"O - I'd imagine it would be pretty hard to nail down the ""terroir"" characteristics of musty and woodsy when you're not brewing in an actual farmhouse. For a commercial, American version, Lakefront does a good job of capturing the complex malt sweetness underlined by simple and subtle yeast components. Unless you've got a major sweet tooth, make this a table beer and share it with a few people, enjoying it with food."

"Deep amber, it pours with a nice head that quickly fades. No lace. A very slight haze is present. Lots of fruit, aroma and flavor. Sweet with little discernible hops (middle to finish). Mild soapiness, smell and taste. Medium body. Slight smoky finish."
""
""
"Overall, a great beer. Robust and with a full body and flavor. Will recommend and definitely look after beers of this style."
""
""
""
""
"O: Ultimately, this just doesn't come together for me. It's too sweet and out of balance, and there's some off-flavors that I don't think should be there."
""

"O- This is an odd beer with lots of strange flavor that I won't say are particular tasty. The malt and fruity esters come through very softly but the DMS and oxidation just get in the way of everything, it was not offensive enough to drain pour and I kept drinking it hoping something else would pop out of the bottle."

"O - Pretty interesting beer and my first experience with the style. At 4.50 for a bomber, I would definitely buy again."
"Nearly opaque amber color from the haze; lacing is not a problem, as the glasses have found a new sticky friend. Aromatic with baked apples, faintness of raisins, soft herbal tone and a ghostlike broth. Maltiness is dialed up quite high on the sweetness. Hint of metallic crystallized sugar, mild phenol funk from the yeast and some hop flavor. Hops do little to help balance this brew out. Estery, with ripe fruit and warmth. A lot thicker and sweeter than anticipated but not too far off what’s expected. A decent stab at the style."

"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a very hazy orange color with a thin white head leaving a slight cap once settled. The aroma is strong of clove and other warm spices. The taste is smooth with a good malt start with the winter spices all coming in the finish. Dry fruits such as raisin and plum mix with the caramel and sweet malts. Could use a little more hop presence to balance things out. Nice medium body that is smooth and very rich. Decent carbonation as well. This was a nice brew to sit and drink slowly. Worth a try on the bomber."
"D: I am very please. Goes into the top 10 of my all time list. Would actively seek out again. Nice work, Lakefront."
"Overall and OK beer"

"I enjoy this beer... but I probably won't buy it again."
"Overall: I'm going to grade this above the flavor because I think this is a versatile beer. The spicing is a bit weird for my taste, but I like the gusto with which this beer goes for any crazy flavor it can get."
"Overall: with so many great beers it's not easy to grade one like this. Good, not great. A few years ago this would have been a standout. Another good beer."
"On tap at the brewery. Hits the style, as spicy . Cloudy golden body and creamy. Good drinkability. mildly toasted malt.Above average mouthfeel.Balsami vinegar in the aroma. Worth a try.Alcohol well hidden but does it have to be this high.Lght tolarable acidity."
"Overall: It is not a bad beer, different then what I thought it would taste like. Good beer, wish I would get it fresher"
"The effect is rather flat, seems to want the bitterness or the perky tartness of a good Saison. Flowers and a bit of perfume. Pleasant on the palate with a nice creamy carbonation. Aftertaste is more like an Old Ale getting ready for the fireside."
"Overall: so so beer here. Very fruity and sweet overall so splitting this bomber is best."
"Drinkability is pretty good, this is a satisfying BdG, a bit exaggerated with the sweetness, but close enough, I dig it."
"VERY NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
"I passed on this one yesterday at Logan Liquors, and decided today that I had to go back and pick one up. Poured a hazy golden color with a big, dense light tan head. Aromas of raisins, white grapes and yeast. On the palate, this one was light to medium bodied, with flavors of green apples, white grapes and yeast."
"Not a classical biere de garde by any stretch of the imagination but still a very pleasant beer."
"O- A good solid enjoyable beer, it just lacks that little extra to make it memorable."
"O: A tasty beer. Interesting combination of flavors that is quite pleasant. Another nice beer from Lakefront!"
"I don't know what I'm missing here but maybe it's just not my style of beer. Smooth going down, feels nice in my mouth but the taste is annoying. I used water to cleanse my palate before I tried it; I didn't know I would have to cleanse it again, to get the taste out."
"Overall: Passable as a Bière de Garde, but makes for a solid springtime refresher."
"overall; a good example of the style, taste exactly as one would expect but nothing to special or overly advance. Still I would reccomend to anyone as an introduction to what makes this style unique."
"D: Overall a decent example, malty body and feel, fruity with a fair rate of consumption."
"Overall an okay beer but a biere de garde fail."
"D - This is a beer that gets way better as it warms. I know this is true of most beers, but this beer seems to be a great example of that...the flavor just seems to multiply as it warms. Not a bad brew and very drinkable. That being said, it's probably not the best example of the style. A good brew though."
"D: I guess there was nothing stand out about this beer, but nothing, absolutely NOTHING was wrong with it. Easy going, could be an intro to more funky belgian beers."
"Overall: I like it, it's a beer that reminds me of spring. Golden color, sweet fruity flavors, this is quite nice."
"I had this beer with seafood (scallops to be precise) and I'm not sure that was the best match. However, since I have the palate of a neanderthal I didn't really mind that much."
"The label advertises the finish as refreshing; I found it had a little roughness from the esters and a lot of length once again especially as it warmed. Not particularly refreshing though. Probably wouldn't buy this again."
"Taste: Bitter hops, grape skin, and yeast. There's something about this beer I don't care for. I'm not sure if it's the particular hops or yeast strain, or perhaps a combination of the two."
"Another good one form Lakefront."
"D: Nice and tasty. Once it warmed up, it became a tasty beer midway between a quaffer and a sipper. Something nice to enjoy while catching up on TV."
"Drinkable, just not what it claims."
"Poured a deep amber, slightly cloudy color into a pint glass, with no head. The aroma was a faint sweet/sour spicy mix reminiscent of a hefeweizen. The initial taste was even more of the classic banana-clove flavor of a hefeweizen, with the exception of a more harsh and bitter finish. A slilghtly fizzy mouthfeel, but still a very drinkable brew. An interesting style - a hoppier, pumped-up wheat beer with a surprisingly smooth finish. I liked it."
"D- Very drinkable for the style, not a great everyday beer however."
