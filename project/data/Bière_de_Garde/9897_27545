4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style and a good example of a Jolly Pumpkin beer with the yeast and oak showing up nicely along with some nice supporting flavors. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, pretty crisp, medium tart, not too acidic, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the right amount for me, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have a problem drinking a whole bottle and I think it would make for a nice beer to enjoy on a warmer fall date. What I like the most about this beer was the balance and complexity that showed up n the flavor, it took me a few sip to get all the different flavors that were showing up and they blended well together. What I liked the least about this beer was pretty much nothing, but I do wish the chestnut was noticeable. I would buy this beer again when it's released in the fall and I recommend it to anyone who likes Biere De Gardes or Jolly Pumpkin beers, it's a little pricey, but it's worth a try. All in all I was happy with this beer, I've had it a few times before and my score did not change at all, it's always been a solid 4 in my book and I always look forward to it in the fall. This isn't my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer, or Biere De Garde, but it's still a good beer nonetheless and I enjoyed drinking it. Good job guys, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Aug 02, 2014"

Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, hops, yeast, alcohol, spices, hint of roasted malt, grass, floral notes, hint of citrus, and slight fruit.

It had a fruity cherry/plum aroma mixed with the smell of corona (not from the bar, the smell was coming from the Jolly Pumpkin Beer). The mouth feel of the beer was interesting it started with some body to it that fades away on the tip of your tongue to a dry almost acidic like finish. The beer starts with that almost brett spicy funky flavor and then transitions to a light tart cherry flavor on the finish.

4.15,2.5,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"i love jolly pumpkin. we were spoiled to have their stuff on the shelf before the sour/wild ale craze really hit, and now with so many sub standard offerings on the shelves, its nice to revisit jolly pumpkin and taste how its all supposed to be again. delicious stuff this one, done with chestnuts. light brassy color, minimally cloudy, with a short lived fizzy tan head. the nose on this is a true wild ale, bretty and a little sour, with notes of roasted nuts and toffee. like a brittle, without the sweetness. the flavor starts off a little sour and a lot funky, bubbly and tart, but half way through it gives way to an earthy nuttiness that must be from both the malts and the chestnuts. its more like almonds or cashews in terms of flavor, but its pronounced and interesting along with the wild yeasts that creep back in towards the finish in a fizzy whirl of interesting autumnal flavors. i have always appreciated their special releases, cool new takes on seasonal ales, and this one too is excellent. i am going to continue to redrink their lineup, i forgot how much i like all this stuff.","StonedTrippin","Jan 22, 2014"

Light and easy drinking with lots of soft carbonation. Classic JP brew here.","BMMillsy","Oct 08, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart apple, lemon, pear, clove, pepper, coriander, caramel, bread, nuttiness, allspice, hay, grass, oak, light leather, funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of spice and yeast ester notes with moderate malt presence; and good strength. Taste of big tart apple, lemon, pear, clove, pepper, coriander, caramel, bread, nuttiness, allspice, herbal, hay, grass, oak, funk, light leather, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, clove, pepper, coriander, caramel, bread, nuttiness, allspice, oak, hay, grass, herbal, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of spice, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, lightly prickly, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wild biere de garde style. All around great balance and complexity of spice, yeast ester, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 03, 2013"

Typical sour/tart aroma expected from JP, woody, notes of light spice and mulled cider. A touch of biscuity malts and caramel in the taste are quickly overcome by a sweeping but not jarring sourness, lemon juice and apple pie, notes of indistinct spice; the label listed chestnuts as an ingredient, but I'm not sure I picked up any of that in the taste...if it was there, it was ""low in the mix"" so to speak.

They mesh rather wonderfully with the chestnuts, delicately toasted but arguably a little overdone. The spices play a secondary but important role here, complementing the Brett funk and the chestnuts. The combination also does bring to mind a little crystallized ginger. Actual oak flavors are minimal here. Drying, mildly tart on the finish with a blend of yogurt-like lactic acids blended with clove, horseblanket, chestnuts and spices, this beer is quite the tour-de-force. Brilliantly integrated. Medium-light in body with medium-high carbonation, this beer is a treat on the palate, and one I would love to drink more often, and would be curious to see what time in the bottle does to it.","DefenCorps","Jun 02, 2012"

Sour like everything else Jolly Pumpkin brews. Clean and lactic with plenty of funk and saddle blanket. Musty and woody. A fresh lavender floral note keeps things vibrant. Despite the erratic flavors balance is found. Chestnuts in beer? I guess they are present but I don't know what I am looking for. Another unique beer from Jolly Pumpkin.","bump8628","May 13, 2012"

But there is also a nuanced spice note, and a malty backbone with a clear toasty presence. While there is funk, cherry pie, and oak there are also more subtle flavors or spice, sweetness and yes chestnut/hazelnut/general nutty-ness. A very complex beer indeed.

Gorgeous, vintage Jolly Pumpkin nose - softly-integrated brett, sour tropical fruits, and of course oak. The flavor is vinous, subtle, and refreshing.

The smell was surprisingly refreshing, while remaining spicy it brought to mind not autumn as much as an image of an exotic place involved in the spice trade yet teaming with verdant flora. The appearance a nice moderate color that brought to mind a well milled table, neither too light nor too dark. A that bordered on golden and orange but was brownish and pleasing. When poured into a wine glass it produced a thick but tight head that again was unexpected in relation to the color. The taste although having some incredibly interesting qualities was firmly routed in what I would expect from the chestnuts and spice. Although the beer did not have any immediate standouts, it felt both earthy and sour at the same time. It brought to mind the qualities common to both cigars and whiskey as well as the zest of lemons and sour apples. What I most noted was an interplay between the sour apple bubbly nature and a woody cinnamon that interplay in a way that is distinctively autumnal. The moutfeel was pleasant and bubbly but not exactly my cup of tea, not bad but not worth writing home about. The drinkability is obviously knocked down by some of the characteristics that make the style. I was surprised though to find myself finishing the bottle over the course of about 2.5 hours. Although I couldn't regularly see myself downing a bottle a glass or two could not be refused. Overall I will say that this is one of the best beers I have had in a long time. It is in a style that I don't usually go for as easily but after hearing good things about Jolly Pumpkin I took a chance on a beer that I truly enjoy and embrace. I will definitely be buying another bottle or two this season and I would love, if I had the ability, to cellar a few. the Fuego Del Otono has inspired me to pursue all of Jolly Pumpkins offerings.","thejake","Aug 20, 2009"

Aroma is fruity, musty, and spicy. It smells like funk/brett, oak, tart apples, cloves, and some cherries. Taste is similar to the aroma. There's green apples, vinegar, pepper, oak, funk, lemon, and caramel malt all noticable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with high but soft carbonation which works great for this brew.

Simply delicious brew, sour fruit, more earthyness, peppery spice, a waft of sweet malt. The finish continues the theme, sour, spice, earth, malt, pepper. Somehow it all comes together and works.

A mix of tart fruits and sweet/spicy malts for a well-balanced and great tasting beer. Medium-body that is slightly chewey that goes down easy and is full of spices/malts that percolate on the tongue and this is evened out w/ tart fruits like apple/grape and something akin to red wine oakiness.

Taste starts off sort of citrusy, maybe some lemon, then fades in to a more powerful, medicinal taste. Definitely has a strong layer of leather like Brett in the flavor. Body of this beer is on the medium side, which is not a bad thing. Drinkability lacks a little bit for me only because of the intense funk that is present.

There is a nice caramel malt presence that provides a comforting balance. It is lightly carbonated and has a pleasant astringency from the barrel.

Regardless of my ability to recognize the spices, the blend was nicely balanced. Even the after taste was pleasant.

4.23,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Like many other Jolly Pumpkin ales, this brew is full of flavor, juiciness, spiciness, lightly vineous, and with a decent dosage of funk--just enough to make things interesting. Starts with a strong, spicy aroma (nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger), quickly followed by a hearty, bready semi-sweet maltiness. A medium muskiness (not quite moldy) overcomes the sweetness, and takes on a solid vineous aroma. The look of the beer is a standard, agressively carbonated, well headed brew with loosely knit foamstand, Sprinkled with yeast and spices. The flavors take on the semi-sweet barley / bready flavors, but meld well with background tones of oak aged flavor, modest caramel and cashew (buttery, nutty) flavors. As the flavors subside, the vineous character rises nearly to wine-like proportions, stopping only for a tart, sharp, dry finish. Lingers with assertive spices, aged hops, and alcohol. There is very little that differentiates the quality of Jolly Pumpkin ales, but they are all amazing and full of art. Another well done brew.","BEERchitect","Jul 02, 2007"

The flavor is similar to the aroma, with added lemon fruit and nutty toasted malt tones. Very laid-back and relaxed overall. Light and slightly creamy in the mouth; perhaps a little too thin in body.

Spice, a light nuttiness, a whiff of light sourness, and a touch of sweetness on the finish. The sour is lemony, the nuttiness hazlenut or chestnut, and the spice is cinammon, clove, and a slight bitterness. The taste is marvelous- the sourness of the style comes through nicely, but its not overpowering and is balanced nicely by a slightly sweet and subtle nuttiness from the chestnuts, all underpinned by a nice dry malt background that lends some chocolate notes. The chestnuts really work here. Their nuttiness is very restrained which I like a lot, and they have their own sweetness and earthiness that is just beautiful. The mouthfeel is lighter than one might expect given the color and ingredients, but true to a Biere de Garde. Very refreshing and unlike any other beer I've had. Quite nice.","Georgiabeer","Apr 12, 2007"

The same character was present in both Biere De Mars and Bam Biere, and Im still unsure about it. After the mid-palate, some interesting fruit character comes out. The mouthfeel is nice and chewy. I wish it had more barrel character however. More oak please. Pretty good and unique.","Crosling","Mar 31, 2007"
3.55,-12.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"The beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an earthy malt scent along with a mildly bitter hop aroma. There is a slightly tart yeast presence along with some fruit esters. The taste is decent. It has a tart/fruity yeast flavor that smacks you in the mouth. It has a moderate malt bill with a bit of hops in the finish. This is a little too aggressive with the yeast esters for me. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with a bit too much carbonation. This was an interesting beer, but nothing I'd buy again.","WesWes","Mar 13, 2007"

The mouthfeel is light and prickly from the high carbonation. Overall, this is an absolutely superbly crafted brew that is highly recommended.","cjgator3","0"
4.58,13.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"this beer blurs the line between beer and cider brilliantly. upon first sip, as with the smell, funky yeast is foremost. after a few sips, ripe michigan apples build in the palate, along with notes of caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a host of other subtle nuances. tastes like autumn. this is very impressive. light and crisp in the mouth, and drinkable by the gallon.","schusterbauer","Mar 04, 2007"

Taste is quite sour and tart with some oak but really dominating by Brett yeast. While I enjoyed this American Wild Ale very much, I could not really feel any spices or chesnut as mentioned on the label since the Brett really took over. Body is light with some great carbonation.

3.97,-2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Originally reviewed on September 16, 2006. 750 mL Bottle. A sweet glow of tawny lemons and horsey grain husk. Grapeskins and fermenting leather blend in a sack of spice. A sweet peach soda pour, with a flowing lace of ivory. Flavor is a sweet sugary essence of malt, while Brett plays quietly in the corner. This beer isnt as nuanced as I would expect. I breathe in some vapors of extraneous nut husks and distant spice conjuring. The reduced play of Brett is deft, as I still get the wonderful sweet lechee juice sensation, but am sparing the scorching acidity. I can also pleasently draw on the crisp malt sugars. This beer isnt particularly nuanced in my opinion, but has a beavenly drinkability, replete with fresh crisp summer hops. The quietly unassuming, but magically appearing hop smack on the tounge, in Euro fashion makes this an expertly balanced beer. This beer is really growing on me, the long drawn carries fresh lime juice and Madagascar Vanilla. And theres spicy mingling. It turns into one of those beers you want to just keep drinking and drinking and hope it will never go away. This is a scarce beer where the backend and smack are the best parts. Damn!","CharlesDarwin","Dec 07, 2006"

Caramel and cinnamon blend well with the apple flavors, with an interesting lemon twist mixed on with them. The barnyard funk and oak barrel flavors round out the beer very nicely. I wasn't sure the flavor would live up to the smell, but it definitely has, with all of the flavors smoothly flowing into the next. Mouthfeel is on the full side with a lively but smooth carbonation. The only real problem I have with this beer, is that I only had one of them.","RedHaze","Jul 03, 2006"

Nose is lemon-like in its crispness, hints of caramel, sweet malt at the back with a bit of butter as it warms, start is modestly sweet, the grain presence adequate and the top middling in feel.

3.91,-3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the slightly cloudy burnished copper brew. Head keeps growing for awhile, with bubbly foam lacing variously on the glass. Aroma is lightly sour malts with a touch of fruitiness. Taste starts with moderate grain, then tartness kicks in, and then mellows to the close, which leaves a lingering fruitiness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pleasing. A nice treat.","ppoitras","Apr 09, 2006"

A bit of some darker fruit flavors along with some definite woody notes. Yes, it does seem like chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Taste once again seems to be control by the sour lactic flavors. They're definitely not bad and I enjoy them but they do control a bit too much. A strongly yeasty body drowns out the malts further. Light cherries and other fruits lie as a backdrop. Caramel comes out the further I go. Some tannins make their way through. A touch of oak. Then the finish which I might find in a Lambic with natural fruitiness added. This was quite an enjoyable and unique offering from JP. Once again they succeed.","granger10","Feb 12, 2006"
