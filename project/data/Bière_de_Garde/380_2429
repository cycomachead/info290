Medium to medium full body, with average carbonation. A fresher bottle is less sweet and crisper with the fruit tending more towards peach and less pineapple.

4.32,14.3,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"750 mL from the Hendersonville Co-op. Also easily found at Bruisin Ales in Asheville. St. Amand pours a handsome -- no, gorgeous -- copper color with plenty of generous head, even when poured slowly. The nose is extremely complex -- clay soil, caramel, butter, farmland, and fresh aromatic hops are all in there, along with some more elusive intangibles that are conjuring up all sorts of images of rural Europe for me. On the tongue, the caramel sings out with a spritzy edge, the hops keep it interesting, and the butter moves to the forefront, but what really does it for me is a slight sour twist towards the end -- reminiscent of those Flemish Ales that Ive recently fallen in love with (such as Duchesse de Bourgogne).

In combination with the steady carbonation, the flavors and crisp texture create a complex array. Sweet, tart and fruity notes freely shift about the palette. Theres also some woody notes and the yeast imparts an underlying musty, farm character. A fine French country ale and a delicious brew.","John","Jan 05, 2003"
3.45,-8.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"An easily forgettable beer. This beer had the unlucky position of being rated following the Stone Imperial Stout (no beer should follow that rating).","philipt","Nov 25, 2002"
3.87,2.4,3.5,4,4,3,4,"This is the first brew i've tasted from Brasserie Castelain and i enjoyed it a great deal. It poured a hazy dark ruby in color with a off white rocky head that faded to a thick ring. A crisp clean candy aroma is like no other i've smelt before. The sweet fruity taste seemed the same from begining to end. A little thin bodied but quite drinkable at 5.9%.","paceyourself","Nov 18, 2002"
4.5,19,4,4,5,4,4.5,"750 mL flip top bottle. Dark amber with big head which vanishes. If you ask me, this beer is identical to Ruddles County Ale. Rich, malty, sweet, delectable. Heavy apple cider qualities, chewy, a tiny dead bit of alcohol in the middle. A mild dryness and a little bit of spice denotes the hops. Nothing to discern it as French or even Belgian. No present yeast; I guess it had already done its job by the time it was bottled. I swear, it tastes just like Ruddles. Which is fine by me, Ruddles is one of my favorite beers. Just not what I expected from a biere de garde. Perhaps its a fraction sweeter, and lacking the creamy British mouthfeel. Anyway it's damn good. Maybe even tastier than Ruddles.","Thrasher","Nov 09, 2002"

2.56,-32.3,4,3,2.5,2,2,"Light amber with a medium head.  Sweet sugary and candy like aroma with a hint of caramel, very simple.  Sweetness up front followed by dry finish.  Profile is llike sugar, not rich malt.  Complex musky undertones, raw dirt character.  Very slight metalic hop in finish.  Very disapointing.Ranks 4th out of 5 Bier de Gardes tasted during the same session.","nathi","Beers"
4.57,20.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Hazy garnet hue, covered by a light tan uniformly thick, creamy head that leaves intricate lace.  The aroma is a combination of mild bubblegum esters, acidic sweet kiwi - like fruitiness and powdery, dry cocoa, w/ an undertone of acetaldehyde and yeast must.  Maple sugar like sweetness in flavor is ensued by biscuit malt and light carob.  Esters complement the malt profile to yield a dark, mellow, fig like fruitiness.  The light hop bitterness is well integrated and perfectly offsets residual sweetness without interfering with the malt profile.  Moderately bodied, w/ a creamy smooth mouthfeel that belies the relatively low strength.  Finishes w/ a hint of toasty malt and bittersweet chocolate, but clean otherwise.  St. Amand is truly a delicious brew.  The overall balance and depth of character is stunning, considering the relatively low strength (5.9% ABV)  Superlative drinkability due to its lightness on the palate-- It's a joy to drink. Reminescent of a dubbel / brown ale hybrid.","marc77","0"
