"Pours to a copper, amber color.  Substantial cream-colored head with good retention.  Leaves a good, moderate lacing.  Steady stream of CO2 coming from the bottom.  This definitely has some bottle carbonation.  Can't smell too much off the top.  Some malty aromas are present.  Difficult to tell otherwise.  The flavor is fruity with a wheat-like sweetness and spice.  The finish is tart and tangy-presumable from wild yeast strains.  Classy package too/  Champagne style cork with wire retainer."
"DATE TASTED: February 17, 2015... GLASSWARE: Corsendonk tulip... OCCASION: Fat Tuesday with a Christmas gift from Jer--much love... APPEARANCE: thick, dense white head piled high like an 80's perm--retentive throughout ; body is dark amber to light amber down the glass, fully effervescent and inviting... AROMA: apple and pineapple early, with enjoyable barnyard funk as promised; ... PALATE: fizzy, lively, wildly untamed flourish early that dries like no brown should--but this bucks the style in a good way; mellows in the middle... TASTE: earthy malts contend with pineapple, apple and plum to create a well-balanced yet nuanced, complex flavor of yeasty gum, hay and cherry--a potpourri of opportunities to enjoy...OVERALL: a beer that deserves to be classed in the ""Brewmasters Obsession Series""; similarly, one that is outside my current price range (thanks again, Jer)...but does Ommegang falter? Does this brewery not deliver on its experience again and again? A great way to say goodbye to beer for forty days..."

"Nice funky taste.  Really enjoyed this."

"Overall: A solid twist on a Belgian Farmhouse style ale. Big tart presence of yeast and fruit with a subtle toasty brown ale element."

"The carbonation makes the mouthfeel, but not much else to back it up.  Crisp and bubbly, that's about it. Pleasant enough but this is not one of Ommegang's best."

"Solid delicious brown ale by ommegang."
"Pours a sort of deep caramel color with a humoungus head. 4"" of beer, 6"" of head. Head is light tan and full of air pockets and lingers around for quite some time. Lacing is some of the best I have seen !!. Aroma is malty with en ever so light hint of some fruit. Taste is malty at first, citrus seems to go away with tasting. The typical brown ale taste is evident with a touch of barnyard funk and some bitterness that lingers on the palate. Feels ok going down, great carbonation."

"Smelled great like a good brett!  But taste was alittle one dimensional for this style.  Good but not great."

"Poured into stein.  Medium brown color.  Nice tartness and caramel taste with notes of fruit"

"Pours a medium brown color.  In the aroma, funky Brett notes and caramels.  The flavor is nice with a firm, sweet brown base and then some nice farmhouse flavors with aggressive Brett laying into the flavor and staying there.  Full bodied, semi dry ale.  Overall, this had a nice tartness and Brett flavor , more so floral than spicy and well rounded.  I'd pick this up again."

"O: While this beer does have some admirable qualities, it stumbles in the flavor categories (all other sins can be forgiven, but not that one). Not the worst beer, but could have been much better."
"Overall, not bad, but not my favorite offering from Ommegang. Good funk, but lackluster otherwise."
"Mouthfeel-tangy,a bit too syrup like.light carbonation.very creative attempt but not quite amazing.it is quality thought excellent special fall brew."
"Wouldn't go out of my way to get again!!!"

"Moderate body with airy carbonation.  Sweet and funky on the palate.  Drinks soft and mellow.  A tad sticky in the finish."
"Not good at first taste but improved over time.  Prefer other less than expensive examples"
