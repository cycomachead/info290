"Not very enjoyable. Had a hard time finishing my glass. Didn't taste like the style should taste like."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy beige color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits, malts. Taste is fruity, spices, surprising amount of alcohol considering the abv. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an interesting take on the style, and a good beer."

"O: not great but bettter than acceptable."

"Pours a clear brass color with a full half finger head that fades pretty quickly.Some bready malts and grassy/leafy hops in the nose,some mild nuttiness is detected as well.Not a flavor packed beer but there is some lighter yeasty notes along with some bready malts with a light caramel note.Pretty tame but it goes down well with food."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while if youâ€™re in the mood for the style."

"Overall: A good, mid-bodied Biere de Garde.  This finishes lighter and more crisp than others of this style."

"Mildly sweet flavor with a slightly bitter finish. Creamy and smooth.  Didn't blow me away but I enjoyed it enough."

"Really enjoyable.  Filled with tropical fruits and apples.  Maybe not the truest to the style but certainly one I would revisit."

"A training wheels version of the style. Not sure if freshness will really improve this. Alright to drink, but a one & done me thinks"

"O: A decent biere de garde. Would go well with crawfish."

"Pours to a rich off white head and copper brown color. Aroma is toasty, biscuits and chocolate malt. Some spicy hops in aroma as well. Flavor is rich and complex with bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, toast, cookies, alcohol and a spicy hop zing. Mouthfeel is light medium. Overall very tasty and technically clean."

"But it misses the mark in terms of Belgianness/Frenchness. Don't expect to revisit this one and still waiting to be impressed by Bayou Teche."

"Medium-full on the palate, its buttery richess provides a sense of fullness and without distraction. Instead a smooth transition to semi-dry warmth and balanced straw-like bitterness gives the beer is refreshing citrusy qualities. Though I rather liked the beer as a non-descript Belgain-esque ale, it is timid in its funky-fresh farmhouse qualities."

"Taste is a nice nutty malty punch backed by bitter herb then flowing into a slight sour yeast finish. Finishes dry. This is a good beer - easy drinking and tasty. I did not detect anything that screamed Biere de Garde, drank more like a mild bock."

"Poured into a goblet. Pours clear copper with a thin, quickly dissipating white head and numerous tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass and clinging to the side of the glass. The beer smells sweet and bready. There's just a touch of citrus from the hops. The flavor is bready from the malt with some hop bitterness in the background. There's just a little bit of citrus back there. It's a little earthy. It's an interesting flavor. The body is light with strong carbonation. The finish is clean and dry. The drinkability is high. This is a good beer."
"Atmosphere is okay. Nothing special in terms of appearance, and nose is very light. All flavor components are lightly applied. The bitterness, however, comes out clearly. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Here is the thing...if you compare to how a Biere de Garde should be, it svery close to the description of the style; however, its not all that amazing. Maybe its because I havent had many of the style, but its just an ordinary malty brew to me. Drinkable, but not amazing...I guess just slightly above average to me."
"Medium-thick bodied. Viscous."
"It's pretty drinkable and it's a pretty decent beer all around."
