"Overall-no idea how this has changed in 6 years but this beer doesn't have much Brett funkiness or much sourness but is dry with a clean crisp finish and is pretty tasty."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Batch 2, 10/2008 bottling. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, herbal, floral, hay, straw, grass, pepper, musty funk, light leather, bread, light caramel, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy/funky yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, hay, straw, grass, herbal, floral, light leather, bread, light caramel, light funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, hay, straw, grass, herbal, floral, light funk, bread, light caramel, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hop, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice biere de garde style. All around good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hop, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy bone head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and cardboard aromas. Taste is much the same with cardboard and honey flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earthy bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that smells and especially tastes very oxidized and old."
"This just seems unlikely to me that a beer of moderate ABV would still be drinkable five years later. This is supposedly Batch #2 from October 2008 according to the label on the neck. From the 750 ml bottle bought at Olive Tree Market in Ocean Beach."

"Interesting beer. Would get it again."
"Poured the big corked bottle into a Duval style glass and a nice tan, bubbly head developed. Head dissipated quickly. Appearance was copper in color and a bit cloudy. Aroma was strong and complex with spicy notes dominating (clove, ginger hints) with sweet and sour undertones. Mouthfeel bas bubbly and carbonation was a dominating characteristic. Taste was hoppy with sweet, spicy overtones. Only slight earthy and malty hints, with those predominating in the aftertaste. Another good one from Ommegang."

"O: A fantastic beer, but I should mention that Ommegang produced 3 batches (all in 2008) of this beer and not all are created equal. Batch 3 has fallen off more rapidly than Batch 2."
""
"4.5 D: The more I drink this, the more I enjoy it. I had to change a few scores as I progressed through the glass. This is so smooth and balanced that it should be a crime to be such a way. It's not the most complex, nor does it have huge flavors, but what's presented is nearly perfect."
""
"Overall – A good tasting mild sour."
""
"O- disappointing from the word go. This makes me very sad"
""
"A wonderful beer but far from my favorite Ommegang offering. I'd rather drop my dollars on some Hennepin."
""
""
"Brisk, super lively carbonation and a medium-light body. Dry finish, very crisp and clean drinking, excellent overall mouthfeel for this style, a terrifically refreshing beer."

"Overall, a solid brew, ages pretty well, didn't take note of how old the bottle was, but it sure wasn't new."
"The beer was poured from the bottle into a fluted glass. Visually, the beer was a straw yellow color with a bubbley white head. The mild apple aroma was pleasant, though it did not overwhelm the senses. Upon the first taste, a bubbley sour apple flavor was noted. The flavor was mild and faded quickly. It reminded be of a flavored mineral water because of the vanishing fruit flavor. Overwhelmingly potent carbonation helped to sweep away much of the flavor. Because the flavor was mild to begin with, there is virtually no aftertaste. After drinking a few sips, the carbonation begins to build in the chest, giving the unfortunate urge to belch like a middle school student. With a more modest level of carbonation, this beer could have been more enjoyable."

"D ~ Unlike any other Bière de Garde I have ever had. This one shows balance & benefits from the addition of Brett. Very elegant & mature. Compared to other ""mass produced"" BDGs like Gavroche, this one has aged exceedingly better."
""
"Overall this is a really refreshing, drinkable beer. I've only had one other Bière de Garde but I really enjoy this style."
""
"Overall, what we found to be the most enjoyable thing about this brew was the calming Brett throughout. While we love an over the top sour, or unconventionally yeasty beer, Ommegang presents an even, well balanced brew, allowing the Brett to integrate rather than steal the show. Perhaps the age helped to calm things down and blend it, but this is a fantastic beer for someone who is looking to get into things with a little funk."
"O: A really nice, dry biere de garde; three years have been good to this guy"
""
"O: I like the taste. I enjoy aged beers like this. The fruits in the beer really start to come out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: A bit dry and mildly tart on the aftertaste. Despite being laced with brett, this beer is real easy drinking and approachable."
""
""
"Without going into details this beer may have suffered due to age. There were some interesting notes, a bit of the sour and dank from the brett, but it was weak. I had this with some traditional holiday fruit cake and it went well, but I wish the flavors were less muted. This is my bad, i cannot blame Ommegang for taking a chance on such an old batch."

"Overall: As others have noted, this is not the funkiest of Brett beers; still, it has a nice flavor profile and, with three years of age, has matured to become a readily drinkable beer"
"The aroma was light, hints of grian, light hops and a touch of light peach and pear fruit notes. Subtle would be the ideal word here. There was a very nice flavor here, nothing really huge, just very light and drinkable. Nice touches of light grains and small doses of light fruit, mixing well and with subtle yet adequate carbonation"

"I desire more complexity, but I do enjoy this one. I'm interested in trying a fresher bottle to see the difference."
"Dr: Extremely drinkable, but it does make me pause to enjoy it. It's a beer with character, brewed with care and really well done. I could drink it all night and be very happy. The ABV is relatively above average, but doesn't come through in the taste, though it does pleasantly warm me stomach. All around, this a great beer that really masters the style and will be enjoyed by any true beer lover. I'm unsure of the price as I didn't purchase it, but I imagine it's rather high. I also imagine it's well worth it."
"Sorry, Ommegang. I usually love you guys, but this one is a miss. Mouthfeel is off and the taste is nowhere near as assertive as it should be."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking orange color. The head was there for a little while but faded to the edges of the glass and didn't leave much lacing. The smell of the beer had a little bit of a farhouse aroma to it but also had a light sweetness too. The taste of the beer gives off a slight tart kick in the beginning but fades into a really subtle earthy flavor in the end. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and had plenty of carbonation. Overall I thought this beer was really nicely done."
"Mouthfeel was thin and light with a semi-dry finish. Overall, this is not a ""wow"" beer but there are just enough delicate and subtle flavors to keep you interested. Even at this relatively low ABV I did expect a few stronger and more assertive flavors but it is wonderfully drinkable so I have no problem finishing the glass. Next time I'll try a fresher batch to compare."
"Drinkability: Another solid effort from Ommegang, and a brew, especially for the QPR at around $6-$7 a bottle, you really can't go wrong here. Quality all around. Will be buying a few of these next time I see it."
"O – Subtle, mellow and well integrated: I really enjoyed this. On the softer side of sour, this is a nice beer to introduce people to brett styled brews."
"This pours a nice reddish/copper color with a large white head which quickly dissipates. The smell is vinegary, earthy, a little funk. Feel is medium, nice carbonation. Taste is different, I guess its the brett, not a taste I'm familiar with, I was expecting a sour Dutchess type of beer from the smell and I get a hard to describe dirty / earthy taste, I'm not sure what to take from it, it does have a nice long dry finish. I also get a nice sweet flavor which counteracts the earthy taste. Overall this beer isn't bad but different, quite a bit different from anything I can remember having."
"O - Surprisingly, this is my first experience with this beer. Was roaming around a local store and I see a Brett fermented beer from 2008...how could a funk lover resist. Given the age of this, I really have to say I expected a lot more funky character in here. There certainly is some brett flavoring in here, but I was hoping for a bit more. In that respect, I found this a bit disappointing. Other than having dashed hopes a bit, I'd call this a solid, if not outstanding example of the style. A little too cidery would be my biggest critique. Overall - I'd have this again, but probably wouldn't buy it myself...unless a couple years from now I see another bottle of the same batch...might give it a shot to see if the Brett added anything more to it."
"O- Not bad, but a little on the tame side from a flavor standpoint. This would be a good introduction Brett beer for those who aren't sure about it."
"O/D - The beer is a bit unbalanced favoring spice and funk. I would appreciate a bit less funk a little more subtle fruit sweetness."
"The cpj"
"O: I'm glad I tried this one but I won't be mowing people down to grab another bottle. This is my first biere de garde with brett used so I wasn't sure what part it would play; The brett really takes the lead role in this beer."
"Hazy orange-ish colored beer with a fluffy white head. Brett is the dominant character in the aroma of this one. That, followed by a little fruit and malt. Lots of funk...barnyard, earth, and wild esters. The taste is similar: pepper and spice, a bit of alcohol, some bitterness. Very little sweetness and no real hop flavor. The beer is medium in body, highly attenuated, and nicely drinkable."
"A very cloudy amber color with a healthy off-white head and decent but spotty lacing. The aroma offers a sharp but pleasant cherry sweet tarts with a sour apple element. The first mouthful has much the same though it’s not particularly sweet. It’s a somewhat grassy, acrid thing with a sort of chalky rhubarb idea. Carbonation is very prominent, soda-esque feel, with a medium-light body and decent drinkability. It’s worthy of a try but not very alluring for me."
"Narrative: ""His resume was just so impressive, quadlingual, volunteer in Burma, summa cum laude from Vassar..."" "Yeah summa cum garbage, he has the worst people skills I have ever seen, how is he going to sell anything? He's just so...abrasive."" It wasn't Dan Mikelson's demeanor that was offputting, in fact he was attractive to the untrained person. He would even seem exotic and interesting, until he opened his mouth and began talking about Jimmy Johnson's points in the Nextel cup. Most customers would sigh and move lithely from the digital camera section until he followed them intentionally into the digital printers section, and continue to harangue them with tales of last years bocce ball tournament. ""Look at that, that canadian couple just requested an item outright and he convinced them that they werent going to use it to its full potential, I dont care how attractive he is, you gotta fire this guy."" "But sir...think about if someone get's hurt his resume says he is a registered RN and"" "I dont care, his resume is a lie, he is a jerk and I want him OUT OF MY OFFICE DEPOT?! YOU HEAR ME?!"""
"As for mouthfeel, there was simply way too much carbonation. It was biting and painful at times."
"O - Overall, I thought this was a good tasting beer, that would be great on a hot summer day. I found it to be pretty refreshing, and I would buy it again. I just wish the flavor had been as complex as the nose. Other than that, I really enjoyed it. This was my first Biere De Garde, and I am looking forward to trying more. I recommend giving this one a shot. Cheers."
"This beer poured a medium clear amber color and formed a nice foamy golden head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, cloves and pepper. The flavor was of malt, bread and a bit of chocolate and pepper. The body was medium light and the finish sprite. Not really my style."
"O- No thanks not really digging this one."
"Taste is dryish, but not too dry, lightly tart, woody-earthy, anise-ginger ale, lightly citric& yeasty, light sweetness, refreshing & crisply tart. All elements are very light and subdued. It is excellent but not quite truly great."
"Quite meh. Heavy Bretted beers aren't usually anything amazing to me anyway."
"I'm really not too sure what this style is supposed to taste like, but this one is interesting. Not something I'd want often, but a decent showcase of Brett flavors."
"O - I like it but it lacks the wow factor."
"After a Hurculean effort, requiring the use of tools, the cork finally relented with a most satisfying pop. Ruddy, with a slight bit of turbidity and a massive, tight head. Loads of yeasty funkyness going on here, with distinct bubblegum and tutti-fruity notes. Some malt settles in later, but this is without doubt a brett showcase. A bit sweet toward the end. Not something you'd want to drink all evening, but quite interesting."
"Drink- A pretty good little beer. It's very crisp and refreshing. Nice to have a 750 at the end of the day with a low abv. I have to say I probably won't buy this again."
"O: I think this beer was well crafted, and I think it solidifies my distaste for solely Brett beers. I love sours, but this beer isn't my cup of tea."
"Twelve-ounce single, newly available in this dimension. Typically reserved for 750 ML bottles, I had the opportunity to sample this French-inspired offering from an American-Belgian brewery. Go figure. The style itself translates to ""March Beer"" and was the product of Northern-French farmhouses which sought to introduce a new twist to the seasonal variations. True to the style, the beer takes on European characteristics although to a slightly overbearing extent. Ruddy, copper-colored hue with a thick head and distinct carbonation. Faint aroma of malts and yeast noticeable in the background. Thick, rich taste with nuances of vanilla and honey dominate the palate. Flavor overall was pronounced and assertive. A good depiction of the style, but slightly over-the-top."
"D: A great brew, but the Brett doesn't really shine. Despite this, it is a well made brew, and is worth a shot."
"D - At 6.5% this is a very drinkable enjoyable beer...a highlight of its category. Only one or two however at 750mls."
"I really don't see this one improving anymore and I'm surprised the brett hasn't ramped it up more."
"Drinks pretty good. A bit over the top but still a very nice brew."
"Opinion: Even though I believe that this beer fell short a bit on flavor, it still delivers a fine impression of the wild side of a Biere De Garde. This style is so wide-open, it sure fits, but I haven't tried a commercial one this wild...I don't fault it for that. This is obviously a hard style to hit, and I am really nit-picking it here to say that it could use a bit of tweaking on the balance...though I would hate to even speculate where that is. This tweaking would be the difference between the excellent beer that it already is into a world-class contender. This is a great beer, and I would definitely recommend it...especially if you are into sours."
"Ommegang Bière de Mars is an incredibly turbulent, amber ale with a huge, foamy head that just keeps growing. It's alive! It has a funky aroma that's very earthy and musty, with notes of hay, grass and tropical fruit. It's lively and light on the tongue like champagne. The finish is very clean, quick and dry. What a unique flavor. It's funky and earthy, like the aroma. It's a little bready and a little tart. It's very hard to dissect this flavor. There's a lot going on in the taste, but it's tightly melded. I taste a lot of hay. It's a touch bitter and a touch sour. It's quite dry and the finish is musty. It's a unique treat that's fun to drink."
"Aroma is of caramel malt and barnyard. Full, tangy body. Caramel malt, brown sugar combine with spicy hops and funkiness on the palate. Long, dry finish. Love it or hate it rustic brew."
"D- easy to drink my share of this bottle. a little pricey to drink often, but every once in a while i could see this being a special treat. i dont think i like this one better than rare vos."
"D - Hard to say; I enjoyed this, but don't know when I'd see a time to drink another one. Me and my roommate finished the bomber fairly quickly, so the drinkability is there, I'm just not sure if I see myself revisiting this again. I think would do great in a Brett tasting or lineup."
"It was so easy to drink, smooth with a nice lasting taste"
"If I was to rate this on a cost-benefit basis it would fare much much worse (D?). Spend your money elsewhere."
"Note: Batch #3, November 2008"
"D-the flavors are pretty nice but the mouth is slighlty pale up front with lots of juicy fruits and spicy yeast in back. this isn't bad but the flavors just don't roll together that great."
"appearance is kind of orange a little cloudy. smells like straw and a littly funky and tart. Mouthfeel is good with nice carbonation. its feel like small bubbles, it's nice. the drinkability is pretty high, i could drink a bomber of this. the 6.5% is pretty well hidden."
"Batch #3 november 2008. Pours a dark redish with a smaller head. Smells very sweet and similar to a wine. The taste is sweet and then tart, but not overpowering, very mellow and smooth, very intersting taste. Smooth nice to sip, not much for carbonation, but this one doesnt need it. Overall really good really different. Would get this one again."
"M: Medium from start to finish. Slight bit of drying toward the end, but not particularly noticeable."
"The color of this beer is a clear copper color, with a fizzy white head. The smell is interesting. Smell hints of spicy malt and fruity yeast. The taste is a little different. I notice they do use bretto in their beer. For me the sweet taste that should be there is quickly mellowed out by a slight sourness. Overall the body of the beer is a medium light, with a slighty fizzy carbonation. It is drinkable even though the flavor is bland."
"FOLLOW-UP: sorry but after the first glass I couldn't stand to pour another one, so the rest of the bottle will be left out and open, and eventually should probably make some great beer vinegar for soups or marinating or something."
"d- good, this is my first biere de garde style, and it was a solid one at that, i would drink this again."
"Notes: Strange brew indeed, for a brew that is almost two years old I was hoping a stronger sense of the sense of brett, and it is almost absent, maybe wrong expectations... It feels like it is being pushed in plenty directions and while it is OK in the end none takes over worth highlighting."
"D - This is a fairly easy to drink beer, with the tartness and sweetness in the flavors it stays crisp and fairly refreshing overall."
"Well....I do love me some Ommegang. But seeing the ratings on here, I must have had a bad bottle. It poured a Hazy amber with a large diminishing beige head. Floral, slightly funky aroma, some apple, and tons of yeast. The bottle and huge flakes floating around, not ""Particulates"" or "" specs"". I smell more Brett than I taste it, it tastes a little like Watered down Vinegar. My friend that split this bottle with me didn't seem to think it was as bad as I did, but he also said he wouldn't buy it again. Maybe another day, and another rating?"
"D: Not an outstanding beer. I'm no expert in the style (I've only had one other example to date), but this doesn't seem like it's quite hitting the mark. It doesn't sit comfortably in my mouth. I probably wont seek this out again."
"d - A pretty enjoyable biere de garde. Lots of tart apples and funk, which I liked a lot. I wish it hadn't been quite as carbonated, but I enjoyed it none the less. Would have again."
"Drinkability - An easy drinking beer, although I'm all set after one bottle. Not my favorite beer from Ommegang, but still a good one. They never disappoint."
"Overall- This smells great, but the flavor doesnt seem to be there. This is quite strange, the beer I am tasting isnt really matching up to with what I am smelling. Again not bad, I was just expecting a heck of a lot more."
"D- Hey its a drinkable beer but for the style im not to sure it hits but in its own way it has a special flavor that makes it great."
"I would unfortunately tire of this beer and soon begin to wonder why I paid an additional 5$ premium for it when I could have been sipping the likes of 3 philosophers or Hennepin instead. Although everything goes down smooth and with has decent complexity, I just wasn't sold. I probably wouldn't go out my way to get this beer again."
"Malts are more toasty than sweet on the palate with the brettomyces being the main flavor contributor. Earthy and surprisingly tart, dry even. Lighter fruit is evident, maybe some strawberry and tangerine. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and has a high carbonation. The dryness of the beer makes it pretty refreshing and easy to drink. I like the smell of Ommegeddon better, but prefer the flavor of this one. Definitely worth a try for all the brett fans out there."
"Drinkability: Well its a perfectly good beer, but not all that interesting. Truthfully, the way the bottle talks up the Brett, I was expecting a little more of a funky Brett blast. It smells a little funky, but it doesnt seem to impart much flavor here other than tartness. The Brett issue aside, its moderately interesting, and easy too drink. My bottle may also not be carbonated as they intended."
"Price = $20"
"D: Another solidly made, drinkable beer from Ommegang."
"Amber/brown color with a nice off-white head that is a good 1.5 inches and almost appears to be growing as it sits and the carbonation from the bottom of the glass floats to the top. Excellent lacing and the head remains strong the entire time. It's definitely heavily carbonated. smells are basically just of spices, with just a touch of funk, but not much of it. At first it's very hard to grasp the flavors but after a second a tangy bite appears and bit of sourness. Just like the smell, it's just hints of tanginess and funk. Everything is good about this beer, I just wish it were more potent. The mouthfeel is excellent. I could definitely drink this repeatedly."
"Drain pour. I couldn't take it. Had to cleanse my palette with a Don de Dieu. Life's too short to suffer voluntarily. That's $13 down the drain - literally."
"The mouthfeel is the typical Belgian carbonation of tight tiny bubbles that push forward the beer on the palate. Very drinkable on a summer day with baseball on the tube. Paired well with fresh goat cheese."
"D: A good beer with a decent amount of complexity. Recommended."
"Batch #3, November 2008: S'funny, I always thought, despite the name, that that was a picture of a peach on the label. You ever wonder about yourself sometimes? I know I do. Ayway, this beer pours a clear rosy amber topped by a fairly sturdy head o' white foam. The nose is kinda funky, but not so much as to make me go, ""Hey, this is some funky shit!"" Only certain parliamentary fellows elicit such a reaction from me. The rest of the nose comprises some light sour peach (go figure, right?), wet hay, and a touch of cobweb. The taste tones the funk down to almost nil, though the cobwebs have certainly proliferated. The peachy fruitiness is also weaker, but still fairly prevalent. Some lightly tart berries, some wet biscuits, and a vague hoppy bitterness round out the rest of the flavors. The body is a very light medium, with a light carbonation and a feel that really wants to be sticky, but, like all of those hapless nerds of yesteryear, only succeed in part. Overall, not a bad Belgian, but it somehow seems to fall short of its ostensible goals."
"Cloudy amber with a dense beige cap. Clumpy lace, decent head retention. Aromas of caramel, apples, grassy hops, musty, berry skin, a little funky and spicy. Caramel sweetness up front in the flavour. Bready malts and a little nutty towards the end. Fruity, berries, slight tartness, almost salty in the finish. Lingering spice and grassy hops. Medium to light bodied and dry, ample carbonation, decent texture. Pretty refreshing with a pleasant complexity."
"Super clean finish, and quite drinkable as well."
"D - Very good, but I find other Ommegang types to be more enjoyable. Probably better to share among friends than to have more than one of these."
"notes: just make sure to pour slow. my first pour out of the bottle was great. but the second got a lot of the yeast in it. and it looks like flakes in your beer."
"Great Brett beer. Easy to drink, goes down easy."
"The color is a deep straw, light amber shade and the head is soft, billowy and lacing. The aroma immediately announces the presence of brettanomyces. There is a farmyard here, with wet hay, soft funk and a bit of spice from the dry hopping. The body is medium and smooth with animated carbonation. The flavor is ever so slightly malty, with sugary hints and green apple, a bit of olive and dandelion accompanied by a tart acidity to round things out. I have never known a biere de garde to court funk quite as much as this beer does, but I like the cut of its jib."
"Beer is dry with a light body and quite the musky finish. Its not overwhelming, I don't want to give the wrong impression, its just kind of funky but well balanced against the malt build. This is possibly my new favorite beer from this brewery. The sourness overall is mild and well balance with the malt sweetness. Very drinkable, very desirable for a beer."
"D: Strident but refreshing. It's complexity prevents drinking too fast, but each sip is savory."
"Not bad overall -- maybe expected a little more, I feel the Brett character was not as complex as I'd hoped, but still plenty tasty & kind of a lot to take. One is satisfying."
"D- Great for sharing a bottle, but probably would have to stop there."
"Notes: A very good ale all around. I wish I could have had a fresh one to compare to my '08 vintage but I'm content. I like it. Give me more!"
"It is light, refreshing, and in no way offensive. I bet if I gave it to some girl friends of mine they would love it. =)"
"D - This is pretty easy to drink, and is quite evocative of seasonal Franco-Belgian table beer. I doubt I'd have identified it as American if it didn't have a label. Unfortunately it evokes a pretty average Bière de Garde instead of anything unique or special. Still, I had no problem sharing a 750ml bottle with my wife, and I'd certainly have it again although I probably wouldn't seek it out. As far as inhibitors go, the sour aftertaste gets a little off-putting and the carbonation gets a touch bloaty, but otherwise it's quite session capable."
"Was expecting something a bit more ""funky."" overall a very tasty brew which is definitely an artisan product."
"D: For me the Brett took over the beer so it was hard to get a sense of balance and taste the other flavors. It was still ok....if you like beers with Brett, I would say give it a shot."
"D: A very easy drinker. Complex enough to keep things interesting, but not too distracting...perfect for the ABV. Excellent for a warm spring day...picnic perhaps. Definite sessionability. Wonderful for style. Ommegang impresses again! I will seek this out again...highly recommended."
"Pours a hazy, brown/amber color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight pale hop, slight dark citrus, tart malt, and slight flower aroma. Fits the style of a Biere de Garde. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a slight dryness. The carbonation level is relatively high. Tastes of grapes, pale hops, sweet malt, tart malt, and slight alcohol. Overall, an interesting Biere de Garde, more sharp and dry than I'm used too, but still good."
"THis beer grew on me as i finished, pleasantly drinkable but not my particular style."
"Notes: A fine artisan beer."
"Batch 02.Oct.08 is oddly refreshing and easy to drink. This one will suite as a Summer standby, and possibly a good match for raw clams or baked lobster, might even be the base for a steam bath for shellfish too."
"Overall Impression: The brett funk was definitely noticeable, but not over-the-the-top. It's a very clean, crisp, refreshing ale that you enjoy year round, but I think it would work even better in the Summer. Although it's on the pricey side, it's still definitely worth a try if you have the coin."
"Nice, enjoyable, a well-made thing for sure...but between the dryness, aggressive carbonation and ultra-crispness, not the greatest Ommegang or Belgian-style beer out there. This would probably be best while sitting on the deck on a hot summer day, which is totally out of reach right now..."
"Poured a brownish hue with orange tint with a frothy head that left lace down the glass. A yeasty, tart smell of some cherry and sour fruit along with citric, spicy clove and some sweet malt. A light, crisp body that is prickly due to lively carbonation. Contains both some juicy sourness and also sweetness that seems to derive from sweet malt and there is a little fruit sweetness as if they put berries into the beer. Even a little bit of bready, toffee and/or dark chocolate notes in the finish. A quality sipper to have during or after a light meal."
"Drinkability: very easy to consume this beer. Once the bomber was gone, I could have had another."
"I was less impressed with the bottle version of this than i was originally by the draft version. Not as sour as I remember it being. The color, as with the draft, was darker than I expected. Overall a better than average beer from a brewery that's much better than that. At $15 a bottle, a little disappointing."
"Drinkability: This is excellent for the style and one of my favorites from the brewery. Not the most complex, but very smooth. Some of the flavors are subtle, but they work well together. Outside of Three Philosophers and maybe Hennepin, this is the Ommegang beer I will go for."
"I enjoyed this, and found it to be a lighter take on the stylem, which hid its alcohol to perfection. I would have preferred more yeast character, but all in all this is a very decent biere de garde. Huge thanks to henrici for the bottle."
"This is supposed to be a sour Belgian Amber ale. And it is. Sorta. Orange yellow body, towering cream colored cap with a rocky zenith. The aroma offers notes of cider, sugar syrup and mild notes of brett. Taste is like a Belgian IPA with added pale malt, not much spice in this example, plenty of hop bite and a tartness from the yeast. Mouthfeel is dry, creamy, light and airy. Not impressed with this beer and actually not too impressed with Ommegang aside from their Abbey Ale and Hennepin."
"D - Really dig this one. Little heavy on the carbonation for my tastes (almost soda like), but the fantastic glow in my mouth from the aftertaste makes it really enjoyable. I wish this was not a seasonal, makes me want to save it for a special occasion. I'm going to snatch up a few of these while I still can to hang onto."
"D: Nothing amazing; a bit too heavy and not unique enough in flavor to be sessionable. Still prefer JP for this style."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Very clean beer and easy to drink. Not too carbonated which really helps to bring out the fruity flavors from the ingredients."
"D - I wasn't quite sure what to expect here; would it be a rich, malty French ale or would it be dominated by sour funk? The answer, as it turns out, is neither. There is a significant malt character, but the beer is so dry that it sucks the life out of the grain and just leaves a burnt toast character that I don't care for. There is also a surprising level of hop bitterness and flavor, and while it is good hop character, it is not what I would have expected in this beer. The European hops enhance the dry toast flavors of the malt, and all of this is further set off by the similar character of musty funk that the brett has contributed. The funk is not particularly complex or powerful, just a dull musty character that blends into the malt and hops. I don't want to suggest that this is a bad beer, it is well crafted and all of the flavors work together well, but it doesn't do much for me. Overall it is kind of one dimensional and lucks both the richness that I would want in a Biere de Garde and the liveliness that I expect from a wild beer."
"Drinkability: Crisp mouthfeel, low abv, fairly balanced and easy to drink."
"Coppery orange in color with a dense, active white head. The color is like an ipa but the head is stickier. Smell is funky, like wet hay. Also has a cinnamon and orange thing going on. Taste is much milder than the smell. Tastes of lemons, followed by a sourness that mellows into a sharp, wood-like flavor. Pepper in there, and the aftertaste is like caramel that isn't sweet. Whatever that means. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and sticky as gum on a hot day. In Houston. (I would know). Drinkability is good, although it dissapears a bit quickly and leaves me not....quite....satisfied. A good one. Reminds me of a milder geueze. I like it!"
"Pours a clear orangish amber color with a large white head that never really goes away. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Expecting a funky aroma and was greeted with a mild farmhouse type smell. A lot of fruity esters are detected. Just a faintest hint of funk. The flavor likewise is dominated by fruity esters, lemons, pears, and bananas. A faint hint of funk. Not picking up any charactor from the malt or hops. Finishes dry. The body seems a little thin and it also a touch overcarbonated. If a drinker is looking for a Brett beer, he should look elsewhere. But this beer does have some nice flavors that will not offend anyone. Easy drinking but it is overly expensive."
"Another solid brew from a great brewery, easy to drink fair representation of the style, but a shade underwhelming for me."
"D: Good. Turned out to be a more enjoyable bottle than I expected with nice fruits and yeast ester flavors. If the carbonation was turned down, I would have enjoyed it even more. A word of warning when you get to the bottom of the bottle: there is practically a yeast cake down there that ruins the delicate quality of this beer once it gets in your glass."
"At a dry 6.5%, this is a drinkable beer. I think it is best paired with food, however. Otherwise, the medicinal quality may get tiresome as you down the 750ml bottle yourself. In any event, this is a cool attempt at a sub-style of a style I wish more brewers would attempt more often. We need more bieres de garde!"
"Yes. This is a pretty wild brew, and to my mind, it's doing what Ommegang does well: taking a very decent Belgian style ale and twisting it slightly off-kilter. They really up the funk on the aroma with this beer, but bring it back to a more traditional basis on the palate. Very nice indeed."
"It had it all until I tasted it. Hazy orange pour, lovely Kool-Whip-like head. Smelled of sour apple and blackberry, followed by sweet malt. A relatively complex blend of aromas. Tasted OK, but no where near the level of the nose. A subtle sour with the malt and a slightly bitter finish. I liked the mouthfeel for its near perfect balance of weight and ease of drinking. Way too much money to get it again."
"I love the nose, but the flavor is really bland. This is still a good beer, and worth a try. Though I have had better Brett beers."
"There was a lot of carbonation in this beer which goes very well with this style. Overall, a very drinkable beer. My favorite so far from Ommegang."
"M/D: Medium bodied, very crisp and carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good. A very solid beer."
"D: Great. Had about half a bomber but would have very much enjoyed drinking more."
"Aroma is dispassionately faint. There is some sourness and funkiness and a bit of maltiness in the background. Flavor is pleasant and smooth with nothing particular standing out. The brett funkiness is still there in the background along with some grass hop notes. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is high. Very drinkable. Much better than the only other brett beer I've had, ommegeddon."
"This beer is cool...rare vos is very similar just without the extra funk. At least try it once..it costs a lot but money is common and this not so much."
"I enjoyed this beer. Enough funk to leave a tinge on the tongue but not nearly as heavy as you would think. This is a drinkable beer, with a boozy fruit (although not a strong ABV), nutmeg, and pumpkin? taste."
"If I were to choose a sour or American Wild ale from Ommegang's lie-up I'd start with Ommegedon. Maybe after that I'd go for Ommegang Rouge, just more sour bite in both of those. Each beer was targeted after a different style of course, and in the case of Biere de Mars they apparently targeted a biere de garde (at least by name). So maybe they put their own fingerprint on the style with the Brettanomyces bruxellensis, and it's a good touch, but finally if it's sour I'm after I'm gonna choose Ommegedon."
"D: Very drinkable, rustic provisional beer. Too bad it's $15 a bottle, but when I can get Hennepin or Rare Vos at half the price I don't think I'll ever have it again unless it's on-tap. Fun beer to try though."
"A 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. The beer was a hazy orange color with a thick white head. It had that slightly barnyard aroma, and also had a sweet, spicy aroma. Taste was mostly fruity, with some cinnamon and allspice. I thought it was a bit on the fizzy side, but still very enjoyable."
"My last bottle of this beer. Batch 1. Decidedly crackery nose with toffee, a little dust and some mellow Brett fruitiness. Earth, pineapple, candied clove, allspice and a little nutmeg are present. Pretty good! The palate opens with a surprising fullness, a dextrinous malt/wheat body with layers of toffee, earth, honey, floral flavors ( rose, jasmine) and all the Brett characteristics - spice, pineapple, some dust and earth. Drying on the finish with a long lasting blend of burnt sugar, spices and earth, this is pretty impressive stuff. Thanks again, Danny! 4/4/4"
"Well worth a try."
"Very nice beer if your a fan of a touch of funk."
"Drinkability: To me this beer is just Ommegang's Rare Vos but made with brett. It has all the fantastic characteristics of Rare Vos but with a bit funk of sourness. A nice beer if you're unfamiliar to Bret. At double the price of most Ommegang's 750s its not really worth it. Go with a flanders red or Orval. It is a bit filling though I struggled to finnish a 750."
"Smell a little fruity with some muskyness. Kind of subdued. First taste was a burst of fruityness and gave me a champaigne kind of feel. After a few sips it becomes somewhat bland. A little fruityness and some sourness but the taste is subdued. Mouth is initially very bubbly but the carbonation drops off quickly. Overall this one is somewhat of a disapointment. Nothing bad or off about it but it just has no wow effect."
"On a side note, I recall the Portland BAs sharing a bottle of this a tasting held back in February. THAT bottle was stunning, perhaps the bast of anything we tried the entire afternoon...were I reviewing then, scores would have been even higher."
"Poured from a corked and caged bottle into a tulip glass, according to Ommegang this is Batch#2 from october of 2008. Pours a dark orange color with a nice slightly off white head. That lingers for a little bit then disappears. The nose is full of apple orange and cloves, with notes of honey. Taste is certainly funky, I can taste ginger, some tea black tea flavors, that horse blanket flavor, and others that i cant quite figure out with little to no alcohol presence. This stuff could be from the Martian surface itself but in a very good way. Mouthfeel is nice and tingly with a semi dry finish. An easy drinker but it doesn't go down too fast, I found myself sitting and trying to figure out what I was tasting. I would recommend at least trying this one. Ommegang hasn't disappointed me yet and this one is no different I will be getting this one at least once more, and would like to pair it with some of the recommended food."
"Drinkability overall is excellent one of those challenging brews that add so much complexity and enjoyment to your everyday beer drinking experience, a got to anytime I see this anywhere. Excellent quality Belgian style pale ale, moderate alcohol makes for great session beer to be shared with friends or solo you be the judge."
" Wow, I can't wait to explore more of this, BRAVO!"
"D - I may end up finishing this 750 by myself [I did] and I'm ok with that. It's good all around but doesn't present any outstanding features. Just a good bier. It probably should have been consumed in May or June. I think the age may have mellowed out some of what could have been the finer point to this bier."
"D: Very drinkable. I've been drinking a 750ml bottle and not finding any reason to stop drinking it or not drink it again. Very enjoyable. And at 6.5% I can enjoy it all night long. A very pleasant find."
"D- Highly drinkable. The flavor is light enough on the barnyard funk and has a delicious backing of fruity sweetness that adds some great complexity. The 6.5% makes this even more manageable."
"Batch #2. 750ml corked bottle served in a Chimay chalice. Poured a reddish gold with a finger of white head. A bit of brett in the aroma along with some citrus and sugar. Light bodied, very refreshing. Dry with a spritzy mouthfeel. Lightly tart, could be a little more for my taste. Nothing substantial, but very drinkable. A training wheels Brett beer. Considering the price, I don't think I would buy it again."
"It was a great experience."
"Cloudy orange-amber with yeast particles floating around. Aroma of citrus, lemon zest, and a bit of funk. Taste is zesty, citrus, slight funky undertones, peach tart in the center. Light bodied and crisp with medium carb. A crisp, fruity brew that goes perfectly on a summer day."
"Drinkability: Ommegang makes some great beers and this beer is somewhere in the middle of their line up. If you're a fan of Ommegang beers or if you would like to start out in the Brett yeast beer world, then you might want to buy a bottle of this beer. As for me, I don't think I would turn down a bottle if this was offered to me."
"Drinkability is excellent in spite of the aftertaste. I will review a fresh on in case this one does not age well."
"D - This is a pretty good belgian-style ale. However, it did not leave me wanting to go buy another."
"I had my eye on this beer since I first heard about it. I've always had a soft spot for Rare Vos and the brett version seemed right up my alley. It turned out to be an excellent beer. Thanks for the bottle, Dyan!"
"The color when poured in to a tulip glass was hazy deep amber with a orange hue, with all kinds of little floating chunks of whatever floating in my glass. It must be peach or apricots. The flavor has a sort of sour taste, as in a fruity flavor, but, not really that good. Fizzy and sour, fruity flavor is what first stood out upon my first sip. Just not a lot of flavor, what little there is!"
"D: Definitely would have liked to see more funk and sour but a decent beer without having much. Drinks very easy and is hitting the spot after today's hot and humid day."
"Overall, a good beer that missed the mark for me. I really like most of their other beers so I'll stick to those. One and done."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Today is yet another rainy day, but this would be particularly good on a summer afternoon, outside with some bread and cheese. I suppose I will make do."
"D: This beer gets significantly better with warming to achieve the best taste at room-ish temperature. It went from a 1.0 to a 3.5 and gets pretty tasty actually. I would not buy again or order another glass, but I'm glad to have tried it - no regrets there."
"D: A very good, smooth experience. Just the right amount of brett and abv at 6.5% makes this a very drinkable brew. Smooth, justifiable in multiples and future purchases."
"Pours cloudy golden with some yeast chunks and a large white head. Aroma is fruity and spicy. Hints of apples and some funk. Aroma is pleasant and inviting. Flavor is a standard ommegang belgian style dominated by yeast. Some funk in there but not overwhelming, the acidity level from the brett was a nice compliment. It didn't overpower the beer yet it was present in the undertones. This is a well done brett brew, somehow managed to control all the competing flavors and put out a quality product. By far the best I've had from Ommegang. I love the saison type of brew and this is exceptional. I will seek this out again."
"Easy drinking and enjoyable. At 6.5%ABV, it's a little on the high side for sessioning, but I'd say that it would be a wonderful session brew, anyway. Very tasty!"
"I didn't like the excessive foaminess while drinking. Maybe it's too young. Perhaps I need more..."
"Drinkability- Acceptable brew, but nothing too exciting for me."
"..I wish I could play little league now, I'd kick some fuckin' ass."
"Overall this is an above-average beer. The flavors and aromas from the wild yeast are kept well under control."
"Not as drinkable as it could be. Splitting a 750 is recommended, but I'm surprisingly daunted by the whole bottle to myself."
"This is a very solid, crisp and clean beer from Ommegang. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability is on the lower side, in that this basically has no taste and was very expensive. Disappointed to say the least, a definite miss by my book for Ommegang."
"Overall, this is a great beer, although it lacks the depth of flavor I was hoping for (given the price - $14). Nonetheless, it's a nice light beer with plenty of Brett influence."
"Thin and bubbly is exactly how this beer needs to be, and it is."
"Pretty disappointing to be honest, i thought there was supposed to be Brett and some funk in this. Not that my palate could detect. Overall, a very mediocre beer, very unlike Ommegang."
"Reddish copper color with nice white head. An initial funky brettanomyces barnyard nose that gives way to big pleasant banana aromas. Light creamy mouth feel with light bret sour flavors, complex and layered to fruity banana character with a clean, light fruit/hop finish. A wonderful brew that clearly shows that bret ales don't have to be outrageous, extreme or crazy sour and over the top. This one is very drinkable with pleasant character and flavors. Final finish is one of carmel and toffee. Nice."
"taste is of fizzy carbonation, sweat and sour fruits, malt, spice, and wheat, end is a little dry, and a little bitter."
"Mildly and oddly (that's the style) spicey Belgian with a barnyard nose. Very pleasant body with soapy white head. The taste is more than decent and the beer is drinkable over a meal, but I would not seek it out again. OK for the style. Above average mouthfeel, though lightly acidic."
"D= pretty good. Mild but good. Nice beer to sit back and relax with but nothing special. I might buy it again when I'm in the mood."
"D= I thought this was incredibly drinkable, but then I am no huge fan of sour beers. Could serve well as a gateway beer into the world of sour ales..."
"This was a little more funky than I'm used to, but definitely an interesting beer. The abv is relatively low and not detectable."
"D - Drinkable for sure. The carbonation slowed my consumption of this a little, but not much. An enjoyable brew."
"A good beer, finely brewed. I love the funk. Another excellent beer from the folks at Ommegang."
"D- Not bad drinkability, nothing that makes it awfull. However I was expecting much more for what I paid ($12) for. Overall a decent beer, I'm considering getting another one and putting it away for a year or two."
"The flavor begins with a rush of carbonation followed by more bretty goodness. Nice and dry with more of the horseblanket brett flavor and less of the pineapple like brett. Clean and crisp and to the point yet it has a nice balance overall. Very refreshing this is a very nice brew that is not as complex as a lambic or geuze due to a lab cultured brett yeast and not spontaneous fermentation."
"Biere De Mars deals in pastels when most beer geeks prefer bright, bold colors. Guilty as charged. That said, this is an enjoyable drinker that is well-crafted from stem to stern. Given the choice, I'd still go with Ommegeddon."
" Look for me to review more wild ales, as my taste buds prefer the funkiness created by Bretts."
"Drinkability was good. Nice lightness to the beer with no alcohol presence."
"D: Not bad, if you can get over the sour apple funkiness that is so dominant. Easy enough to drink, but not something I will buy again at $10 a bottle"
"In true Ommegang fashion, the beer is a crystal clear example of the Bier de Mars style. I would like to see a little more play between the clean character exhibited here, and the challenging rogue yeast and bacteria character that I have found in authentic Belgian versions. A bit more age will bring the beer closer to center and mellow out those fresh hops. The beer seems to be influenced by Orval and does very well by the mentorship."
"My first Biere de Garde, so as far as I know- this is very good."
"Not my favorite from Ommegang, but this will do until I can find more Ommegedon this year!"
"Clean tasting, fairly high carbonation. Malty, off-sweet, hints at fruit (peach?) without actually getting there. Hoppy for a belgian, balances out the finish so it doesn't cloy. Overall mouthfeel is a bit weak, not so much watery, but really doesn't have much behind it. Carbonation is fairly high, keeping up drinkability. Don't really know what to make of this, tastes OK but nothing amazing, especially for the price. Hardly tastes sour at all."
"A very tasty brew, could have used a little more sourness, but overall a very complex and tasty brew."
"I really wanted to like this beer, as I love the brewery. I am, however, starting to wonder if I wasn't overly impressed with Ommegang early on because I hadn't sampled enough other beers at the time. For a Biere de Garde that's American or, hell, from New York, go with Southampton. Any of theirs beats this sucker by about three lengths."
"Pours a very nice hazy golden light amber color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus foamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast notes, slightly fruity, and a touch of caramel. The taste is malty, some yeast notes, very slight cherry taste, and some caramel tones. This one is alittle bit to bitter for my taste. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, but I've had way better BDGs."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Ugly cloudy, amber color with a ton of suspended yeast. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Yeast nose. Flavor is dominated by the yeast, some citrus. Who said this was a Belgian amber?? Pricey at $13.20 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Again, I don't get to a lot of these, but it's a great style that plays within its means and can slow the game down nicely. There's a $#!+load of Beautiful Chemistry going on here but it remains light, crisp and mighty drinkable. The tightness makes it more of a sipper than a less complex style would be but I absolutely enjoyed the hell out of this one."
"D- pretty drinkable, especially for a Bretts beer. I could have two or three of these, if I had two or three. If they cost less than 12$ a bottle, that would help, too."
"Interesting and nicely done, I really enjoyed the way that the Brett character interacted with the malt and fruit and spice rather than being obtuse or going overboard. It's reminiscent in a way of some of the wines of the southern Rhone. Charming! Worth seeking out!"
"A funky version of the style with a nice malt base and a touch of spiciness. A well-done, unique, interpretation."
"D- Overall, this is a pretty good beer, I definitely enjoyed it. The beer really started to open up as it warmed up in the glass. Recommended."
"D - Very drinkable - this would be ideal on a warm day and the ABV is perfect."
"Bottle courtesy of Cletus Batch #1 tasted in April 2009: Poured a clear medium amber color ale with a quite big bubbly head with minimal retention and some light lacing. Aroma of zesty Brett notes with some great Belgian style malt. Taste is quite a complex mix with some dry Bretty notes, some zesty refreshing notes with a lightly sweet bold Belgian malt backbone. Body is about average with some good carbonation. Very well done and something I wish I could have more often."
"A light to medium fizzy body and rather dry. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden and the light body make this very drinkable."
"D: very drinkable, but lacking character (if that's what you're looking for). Aging might be good for this beer. But if you are looking for a nice refreshing belgian amber this is the beer for you."
"The flavor is dry and acidic, with a slightly tart, funky overtone. Sweet pale malt, a dash of cinnamon, and tart, fleshy fruit. Well carbonated, with a light, vibrant body. Finishes with tart, bretty funkiness and floral hops. Good stuff."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable to me. ABV is quite manageable. For the over the top amount of carbonation here, I find this beers ""stomach weight"" to be light. Palette fatigue is the only problem I would have with this beer as the sourness does get a little bit repetitive."
"Well balanced and interesting, but perhaps not as complex as I hoped for, considering price."
"I love the Ommegang Brewery and their dedication to bringing high quality Belgian style beers here to the states, so I'm glad I tried this. Give it a shot, but I'll stick to the 3 Philos!"
"Corked and caged bottle into an Ommegang tulip pours a slightly hazy amber with a nice frothy eggshell head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma was a nice plethora of sweet fruits, sour brett notes, citrus hops and spices, fragrant and intriguing! The taste is a wonderful complex blend of sweet malts, puckering brett funkiness, spices and an interesting touch of citrus hops. The beer is light and crisp and the sourness is more tolerable than most beers of the style. This one may be a bit pricey, but it's quite enjoyable and one any Belgian lover should try."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable."
"I found this to be quite drinkable, with a friendly 6.5% ABV, and well worth the $12."
"if you leave this in your mouth for a few seconds it gets a lot funkier."
"Overall a good beer but I don't think I need to buy it again."
"Poured into my Maudite tulip. The beer is a light amber color with a good inch of off-white foam. The foam is retentive and the moderate carbonation maintains it for a while until it settles to a 1/2 inch, and more dense, layer. I like the smell of this one a lot. It makes me think it will be similar to a saison because I can smell dry, metallic overtones and a little malt at the bottom. I am assuming the brett will make it funky, I am hoping it will be a bit more sour than the Ommegeddon. The first tastes brings a light, cold, dryness to my tongue. Lively with carbonation and an earthy, woody taste. No sourness, but a nice dirty, mineral taste. A like this one a lot. Simple, mild, and interesting. Very Belgian."
"i usually dislike the overly sweet, almost cloying malt character of many bieres de garde. but here, i actually wanted more of it. this is drier than i'd like, without enough funky brett complexity to compensate. still a decent beer, just unspectacular."
"D - a descent beer and one I was most thankful to try."
"Wow! More complex than Hennepin and much more enjoyable. As drinkable as a better Fantome. Exceptional rendition of one of my favorite styles. Curious to know how this one will be with six months in the cellar. What a pleasant surprise, even at this young age."
"Easy drinker, very refreshing, would rather have this than a hoppier one, good drinker. Yes, a nice one for this style. Prefer Jolly Pumpkin version to this though."
"Drinkability: A pleasant, keenly refreshing Bière de Garde lightly layered with the intriguing complexities of the Brett keeps this one in on the ""easy"" side of the drinking spectrum. My favorite Ommegang by a wide, wide margin. Recommended."
"Nice example of a funky beer. Definitely an acquired taste and I would say that they scored a hit with this one. Not for everyone."
"750ml Batch #2 October 2008 $12.49. Hazy orange color and an aroma that is definitely bretty, but I only caught exactly one whiff of funky barn, the rest was just kind of yeasty and a little chemical. As it warms up it turns into a really nice juicy, fruity aroma. Very interesting flavor with the slightest bit of tartness at the end. I am really struggling to define the flavor but it seems mostly yeasty with a hint of citrus but the brettanomyces is definitely noticeable. This was interesting but nowhere near worth $12.49."
"Brass and copper come together for a bright amber hue. Great, champagney bubbling. The head is a minute long and spritzy that leaves no fom a little faster than I would like. Horse blankets, very ripe crab apples. Pretty funky and tart aroma. Makes me think of a farm. Very tart fruity, mostly crab-apples, maybe some tart blackberries upfront. Then some more funky, yeasty farm field and dry grass. Earthy tartness, but not too funky. One of the better Biere de Gardes I've had."
"D - I am really starting to like brett in this style of beer. This one has a nice complexity from the brett without a lot of funk."
"The aroma is a tiny bit funky with spice, cedar, malt, and grass. The appearance is nice with a huge head and orange gold color. The flavor is like the aroma with a nice sour dough bread finish. The palate is too thin. Overall this is good but maybe it needs more time to mature."
"This poured a hazy light copper with lots of chunky sediment and fluffy white head. It smelled like lemon hops and sour wild yeast and sea salt, with juniper and metallic copper and overripe oranges, and a bit of pine. It tasted like lemon and orange hops, with sour wild yeast and sea salt, and some metallic copper hops. It was slightly thick with lots of carbonation, and had a sour and bitter aftertaste. Overall this was good but not as unique or delicious as I was hoping. It had decent body but was overly carbonated, and the flavor wasn't great. Southampton's bière de garde was totally different and much preferred to this. Ommegang is a great brewery, but this beer lacked malt for balance and depth. Perhaps aging would help this?"
"M: Fuzzy, thin and overall something that seems fitting for the genre but not particularly for my tastes."
"Nice offering from Ommegang. I wish more brewers would attempt this style. Pours a glowing orangish brown with a silky beige head. The nose has a subtle famyard funk presence over delicate malts, tart citrus, fruity hops and peppery alcohol. Very well balanced flavor profile. Spicy yeasts, sour oranges, musty oak, Brett and quiet hops. Medium body is well carbonated. Would pair well with a variety of meals."
"D: Easy to drink, pass it around. Not a crazy brett statement, just right. How will it age?"
"Dark amber pour with a creamy white beige head. Head is easily coaxed back to the top with a gentle swirl. Very slight lacing - no stickiness. Very nice appearnace. Smell is a bit of bitter orange peel, with a nice spiciness and brett assault. First thought is that the brett makes itself more known here than it did in Omeggeddon. Taste is spot on for what I expect from a Biere de Mars. Not as good as the superb version released by Schlafly or the more sour JP, but still very nice. A bit of musty bitterness with just a touch of orange peel. Mouthfeel is great. Smooth and oh so sippable. This lends to great drinkability too. The only downfall is the price. A nice beer, but if I want the brett bug, there are cheaper options, and better ones at that price. Still, a very good beer."
"This beer is well balanced and very nicely put together. It never leans too far towards tart or sweet or funky or spicy. (Actually, a bit more brett funk would be welcome here.) The flavors harmonize well, and the texture is appealing and refreshing."
"D: Great beer. Certainly will pick up on next visit."
"Overall, a solid, if unspectacular beer. Worth grabbing one if you've never had, but I prefer the more sour Jolly Pumpkin's"
"Body is much thinner than I anticipated, and while I knew the beer was simply ""finished"" with Brett B-, I was hoping for more wild character. Reading some other reviews, looks like this beer is hit or miss. I may try it again, but I'm not going to go out of my way to find another bottle."
"Notes: This seems to be a very restrained example of a Brett beer, and I will be curious to see what it does in the bottle over the next year or so. Good mouthfeel, and it's not overly astringent which makes it more ""drinkable"" (i.e. finish the one alone or maybe have another)."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, keeps you interested."
"D. A nice beer. Very unique. I like the spice blending with the touch of funk."
"Drinkability: A perfectly pleasant brew, fantastic up front, and though it stumbles at the finish line, it's still very good. The brett adds quite an interesting dynamic, and though age might make this one more interesting still (particularly in the taste), I don't know how much it can do without a little more in terms of malt complexity. If it weren't so expensive, I'd definitely buy another bottle to age!"
"D: Very."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a nice, tightly beaded head and some sediment. Smells very lightly sour, grassy, and citrusy with orange and lemon. Slightly metallic smell at the end. The taste is a bit more complex and also a bit earthier. There is just the slightest bit of clean funk, some spicy earthinesss, and some prickly citrus. Tart flavors tempered by spicy/earthy hops. Quite nice. Quite prickly and carbonated in the mouth, but very refreshing."
"The taste has a more subdued tartness, maybe a funk? Definitely can pick up the belgian yeast, maybe that is the bret? Has some spiciness near the end. Has a citrusy, fruity malt character. I was a bit disappointed in the mouthfeel, it seemed a bit watery to me. This beer has excellent drinkablity."
"Not the best I've had of this style, but a solid effort from Ommegang."
"Found this unexpectedly today in Davis Square, guess I can scratch it off my wants list now. Anyway, I poured Ommegang Biere de Mars in a Duvel tulip. Color was orange, with a slighr red twinge to it. About two fingers of white heading shows up, along with a large amount of yeasty sediment floating in the glass. Musty nose, with lots of fruity funk, hay, dark grains, more fruit to go around. Funk is not as present in the taste, which starts off with some nice juicy fruit, then takes a turn for the grainy and dry. Body is right there in the middle, with a nice balance between the hops, malt and wild yeast. Alcohol warmth can be felt after going through about half a glass, but that did not deter me from finishing the bottle. Although there haven't been many, this is one of the best of the style I have had. If this were available all the time, I would buy it often. Cheers"
"A very pleasantly flavored and well balanced Biere de Garde. All too often this style is overdone in terms of sourness and/or mustiness, but Ommegang has done a successful job where this style counts most: balance. Certainly worth a try and a return trip."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a deep golden orange color with plenty of yeast floaters, very active carbonation that feeds a beautiful puffy head that left some real nice lacing. A nice farmhouse funk aroma, sweet and peppery, noticable candi sugar presence. The farmhouse funk is also in the taste, some lemon tartness, a metallic twang and a slightly bready malt. Enough of a malt presence to distinguish this from a saison. The feel is fairly light, very airy from the carbonation. Perhaps a bit overcarbonated. Finishes slightly tart. A nice and tasty brew. Closer to a saison than most Biere de Gardes, not a strong malt presence."
"Refreshing, complex, and subtle - and very satisfying. A great effort from a great brewery, one of my favorites from them."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. the brett gives it a neat extra dimension and i think the dryness makes it a little more drinkable than some BdG's, which can sometimes end up overly sweet to me. i'd be curious to try this one with a little more time for the brett to work, so i'll have my eye out for another."
"Pours a hazy dark amber/orange, neat colour, thick off white head forms, big bubbles, and drops some spiral lacing on the glass while settling to a thick ring and layer, looks pretty good. Smell is nice, yeasty and spicy, honey sweetness, biscuits, a bit of dry grapes and fruity funk, mango, lots of tropical fruit, icing sugar, musty, earth, barnyard, pretty cool, brett hasn't quite taken hold yet but its present. Taste is lightly tart at first, some lemon acidity and orange peel, light coriander, honey, toasted bread, very earthy, grapes and wood, light lemony funk with some horseblanket, very dry and wheaty in the finish, alcohol comes through a bit. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, nice light funkiness, very drinkable and refreshing, if not the most flavourful. Nice beer, thanks Russ!"
"It pours a hazelnut-orange color, quite clear, with steady streams of fine bubbles feeding the lofty off-white head, which fades pretty quickly and leaves only a little lacing down the glass. The smell is like wet wool, alum, and marigold. The taste calls to mind Joyce's phrase ""foul flowerwater:"" bitter marigold, wood-sorrel sourness, the tannic qualities of strong black tea, with a lingering grapefruit aftertaste. The carbonation is full but fine, the body clean and medium thick, the finish nicely dry. It's a tad intense for more than a couple of glasses, but the moderate alcohol makes it easy to put away. A very nice beer."
"Batch 2, October 2008. Typical Omme presentation, Belgian bomber, caged and corked $11.99 @ De Cicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours dark peach amber, cloudy, light tan head, better then decent retention and leaves plenty of splattered gobs of lace. Bit o' funk, and sweet fruity spice in the nose. Spiced up up front, lightly horsey in the midsection and quite dry and puckering in the finish. Imminently crisp, tasty and refreshing. Yum...great accompaniment to light and spicy foods of all sorts. Fine addition to the Ommegang family."
"Glad I had a chance to try this.. I'll leave the rest of the bottles for other thirsty BA'ers"
"Overall: I much prefer their Ommegeddon ale which brings the brettanomyces character to the front. There are interesting characteristics in this beer, but they don't quite meld, and the brett character, which is advertised on the bottle, is very faint."
"It was good, but I was hoping the Brett would play a much bigger role than it does."
"6/4/6/4/14 (3.4/5)"
"Chilled from the fridge, poured a medium coppery color. A bit of fizzy head which left some lacing. Smells light, a bit spicy and a bit of Brett funk. Taste is good, belgian pale tasting- light malt background with just a little hop. Not crazy funk like most Brett'ed beers I've had. Very well done with the yeast. Drinkability is way better than the other wild yeast beers I've had. Smooth and crisp."
"This was a great beer put out by Ommegang earlier this year. It came across as a nice Belgian pale or amber that is slightly funked. It definately has some brett character, but it is not overpowering at all, which is perfect for my liking. Wish I had a constant supply in the cellar and hope they brew this one again."
"The beer pours a light amber in color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is quite exceptional. It has a dry pale and light caramel malt scent along with mild farmhouse funk to it. It's spicey with a touch of horsehair. I was expecting a larger Brett aroma, but I think over time it would become more pronounced. The taste is much the same. It has a crisp Rare Vos taste with the Brett character in the finish. Again, the Brett is basically complimetary and not too aggressive. I wish it were more sour, but I think they were shooting a subtle quality. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. I've been waiting for some time to try this. Thanks goes out to Arpit for the chance to sample it."
"While note nearly as Brettanomyces influenced as I might have preferred (give it time though and it might get there), this is fantastically drinkable and quite well balanced and flavorful right now. A very enjoyable beer even if I do find myself wishing for a touch more complexity. One of those beers that I could have paid much more attention to picking out the nuances, but was distracted by how down-right quaffable it is so I drank the damn thing instead."
"Nicely drinkable beer."
"A big thank you to BeerWorld for this one."
"Served: in a Ommegang Hennepin flute."
"I wish I had more, I hope to enjoy it again, so easy to drink, and so much character."
"Thanks to RomanW70 for the opportunity to try this one. Poured a light, translucent copper. White head was composed of tiny bubbles that quickly dissipated. Mild nose with a slightly chemical character. Taste follows nose; hard to distinguish the flavors, but the chemical flavor is also present in the mouth. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with some carbonation burn. In terms of drinkability; liked it, but didn't love it."
"D - nice tip toe into a brett influenced beer. pleasant overall and one I'd say would be nice on a warm day over some pub fare in a beer garden."
"Bottom line: I *love* this brew and I want to say thanks again to Alan. This bottle put a *huge* smile on my face."
"Drink up and enjoy!"
"D - Tons of fun to drink as it hits a lot of interesting point with each of the senses. The wild funkiness of the yeast is great, but not an overpowering force...which = big drinkability points!"
"D: Ommegang has never disappointed me (save for the raspberry saison). The ale's tartness is spot-in, a very easy sipper."
"Overall, quite a good and interesting ale. I feel so foolish for not buying any of this. I guess it's an excuse for another road trip! Do try it if you get a chance to go."
"Picked up a few bottles at the Ommegang brewery over July 4th weekend. Color is an unfiltered orange-brown with a white head that laces well. Earthy aroma, very natural. Taste is fantastic. Quite complex, with elements of hops and more so malt, a little sour and earthy. The label states that it is fermented with Brettanomyces Bruxellensis, which I suppose accounts for the funkiness. A little bit of a citrus aftertaste, this is an incredibly easy drinking beer. I""m only sorry that I didn't pick up more bottles; hopefully they will expand their distribution plans."
