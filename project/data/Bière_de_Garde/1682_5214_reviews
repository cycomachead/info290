"O-This is a good, but not memorable beer. The flavor profile is pretty solid for the style with nice toasted malts, and the alcohol is very well-integrated into the beer. It is also pretty good-looking and true to style in that regard. The smell and feel are a bit lacking, and I could have used a bit more hops or sharpness to balance the sweet malt profile, but these are not major criticisms."

"O: This beer is a lot maltier and heaver in body compared to other beers in the style (sort of like a comparison between a bock and a doppelbock), but it's light enough to be rather drinkable, especially since any traces of alcohol are very well hidden."

"Poured a reddish brown with large voluminous head that gives off massive lace patches. The malts are strong in the aroma, as I pick up good amounts of caramel and dry bread (touch of roast) as well as some leafy hop zest. Medium-bodied and filling thanks to yeast, smooth, sweet thanks to caramel and some sweet fruit notes, touch of sugar, and there's a crisp balance thanks to moderate citric hop base and good carbonation. Finishes easy with a nice crisp bite to it and a tad sweet and I swear there's a minor wine-like fruitiness on the end."

"Bottle: Poured a hazy brown color ale with a large frothy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bready yeast with fruity ester is quite nice. Taste is also dominated by a huge semidry caramel malt base with nice yeast ester of fresh bread and light fruit. Body is quite full with limited filtration and good bottle conditioning with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Much better then expected and a nice example of how good the French bière de garde can be."
"I have a suspicion my bottle was off. Look forward to retrying at a future date if I come across this again."
"* I should point out that I opened this one around 55° F, and that further chilling would have reduced, and possible prevented, the foaming."
"Overall really nice, not what I was expecting (Biere de Garde was more of a Saison in my head) but still very enjoyable."
"Fuller bodied with much more of a malt presence than expected. Slightly spicy with citrus and dark fruits. Medium carbonation which helps the mouthfeel. Alcohol not well masked. Average at best."
"Drinkability: Some very strange flavours in this one, quite unique. Probably couldn't manage more than one. Well worth a try. 3.5"
"Pours a cloudy, amber/brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, brown sugar, citrus, and slight pale hop. Fits the style of a Biere de Garde. Mouth feel is smooth and sharp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale hops, alcohol, tart malt, sweet malt, slight citrus, and brown sugar. Overall, a darker and more malty biere de garde than I'm used to having, but still rather good."
"750ml bottle courtesy of RomanW70 (thanks Dan) served in my ST tulip. 25.04.07 indicated on the label. Poured a hazy, plum color with a three inch off-white head that sizzled and popped as it receded into a frothy quarter inch cap; sheets of watery lacing, but no legs. Nose was dark fruit, vinous and somewhat acidic with a hint of chocolate towards the back. Taste follows nose, with a bit of sourness/astringency at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and sparklingly effervescent with a little bit of prickliness across the tongue. I've had the opportunity to try a few Bière de Gardes, and I tend to not really enjoy the style. That being said, this brew seems a little closer to a belgian strong dark in style, and I was pleasantly surprised. As such, my rating reflects the beer itself and not its attributes relative to the style."
"not too thin, decently smooth, but slightly watery. lively carbonation, but not enough to completely wash away that sweet, phenolic, cloying character."
"A great artisanal French biere de garde."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The beer is rum brown with a fluffy white head. The head recedes quickly, leaving some lacing on the sides. The aroma is earthy and sweet. It is sweet on the tongue, with taste of caramel and alcohol. The beer is medium bodied with above average carbonation. The beer is smooth and easily drinkable. This is my first Biere de Garde so I do not have any thing to compare it to, but I do like this beer."
"Pours darkish copper, not much light coming through. Short head, dissipated, leaves a very thing ring and slight swirl of lace. Not that carbonated. Slightly sweet and nutty nose, a bit of malts as well. Taste is also sweet up front, a little caramel-y and nutty, some dates or some other dried fruitiness. Its strength is noticeable enough to make it enjoyable. It's a bit thin going down, lighter as it should be."
"D - A food friendly ale worth grabbing if you see it. Very nice stuff."
"Poured into my Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass a very nice clean/clear golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy/fizzy off-white head, which leaves a nice big island in the middle of the glass and some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, with some spice and yeast. The taste sweet, malty, yeasty, and a nice touch of spice. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a nice one, thanks Joe."
"picked this up to try out of curiosity. it pours a nice amber orange color with a nice offwhite head. this one didn't work for me as well as some other biere de gardes I've had as this was more of a marmalade and caramel effect than what I expected. Bottle notes its from 4-25-07."
"D: This will make a good pair with some goat cheese and honey. Goes down with ease despite the 8% ABV."
"The French beer scene is a lot better than most poeple realise, this is a good example of what they are missing."
"Pours a deep amber color, bordering on brown, with some bright highlights. The smallish head leaves a bit of lace on the glass. The aroma is low on esters and skews toward the malt side, with plenty of bready, almost German malts and a dusty tobacco note. On the palate, big carbonation and smooth, sweet maltiness alongside some dextrins. There's a bit of orangey fruitiness evident on the edges. Good acidity toward the end. The finish is long and a tad sweet, while the mouthfeel is full and malty overall, with a bit of hop acids at the end and plenty of soft carbonation throughout. Overall, this is a tasty biere de garde, skewed toward the malty side, without much of the herbal/earthy notes often found in beers of the style. Still, it's a rich-yet-light, interesting beer that would probably be great with food and cheese, so still a definite thumbs up."
"Overall: My first bière de garde. I like it, but I wish it didn't have so much ABV."
"Not a bad beer, in that it pours a orangish amber, fairly clear (I didn't get any yeasty bits floating about as mentioned in other reviews) and only moderately carbonated. The beer has a smallish head that does retain and does lace to a degree. The smell is quite musty, full of caramel malts, perhaps some cherry, yeasty alcohol aromas, some tartness in the smell too. The smell is not overly enticing, but keep going because the taste is better. What you'll find is a very caramelized malty, tart, sourish, cherryish ale that is quite sippable and refreshing. The caramel comes out the gate quite strong but near the finish, some of the other complex flavors emerge, some tart apples, some cherry notes, a yeasty tang, some sweet malts, some sourish hops. The beer is not overly carbonated, quite light bodied for its 8% ABV, and quite soft on the tongue. There is nothing here that will offend. Right out of the bottle, the caramel was a bit much and I thought it was too much like a strong Marzen, but then the beer's other qualities emerged. Not a bad beer, worth scouting out, very good sipping beer on a cold winters evening. L'Chaim."
"D:	This one is a bit too sweet for my liking, but I think it does a pretty good job of fitting in with the style. Despite its high ABV, it was highly drinkable. I certainly recommend it as it is an interesting taste experience from France."
"Review translated from french 7-9-2008."
"Recommended. A unique, tasty brew. Just how I like them."
"Smelled primarily fruity with apples and cherries. Taste was tart and dry -- tangy, sour fruits with a somewhat bitter finish. Carbonated, crisp somewhat thin mouthfeel. Enjoyable as something to sip with a light meal on a warm evening. A little fruity and sour for my general tastes, but a decent choice overall. Definitely interesting and complex."
"This beer was interesting in that the mouthfeel, flavor and finish were all what I would imagine the result to be if you mixed a Lambic and a Flemish Sour together. At various sips and times, I detected fruity, sweet, sour, spicy and a hint of the 8% alcohol. Different, but not bad at all."
"Medium-bodied and smooth, this is a nice sweet treat. Despite the alcohol level (which is hardly noticeable) this makes a nice summer night sipping brew choice. Also would pair well with lamb. A classic for the style!"
"It poured a hazy amber with 5mm of head. It exhibited a cherry fruity-sourness in its bouquet. It didn't have a dry-sourness (like a Berliner Weisse would), rather it had this sweet-sour dichotomy going on that certain fruits provide that makes you pucker. Tart would be the best word I suppose. Not very drinkable/sessionable, but I still enjoyed it."
"Full of bready flavors, mingled with clove and brown sugar. Peppery finish with hidden ETOH. Smooth and drinkable."
"Caged and corked 75cl bottle; poured with an immense head of tight foam and a beautiful tornadic swirl of yeast-inspired carbonation. When an aroma can finally escape, it is slightly spicy and tart, not unlike a freshly peeled blood orange. The flavor, however, is much more full-bodied. This is very earthy with a brown-sugary base, and a viscuous flowery aspect. I enjoyed it quite much. (#2798, 4/15/2007)"
"drinkability: Goes down smooth but no cravings for another sip."
"the whole time i can't help but but wonder if this is really a BdG. nice brew, though"
"Sampled from both can and bottle. Among any of the better amber ales or biere de gardes, seems the most popular of this brewery. Pours with fairly weak retention, a crystal amber in colour. Strong aroma, good mouthfeel and agreeable flavour. Light roast caramel malt, some chewy presence, though mouthfeel a little light, tad watery. Alcohol becomes more noticeable as it warms. Overall good malt, nice subtle blending, among the best of French beers I've had."
"Flavor lives up to aroma. Light on the mouth with a nice touch of liveliness but the body still seems substantial, if that makes sense. Caramel malty flavors at the top. Yeasty spicy flavor from the beginning goes all the way to the finish. A touch of sour fruit in the middle counters the malty caramel component. The back has some alcohol esters and pepper components. Finishes with a touch of a floral element and some residual sugars. Complex, delicate, full flavored. I need to get this again."
"BB 14-03-08. Nice and due to good feed by the prearling bubble well lasting light beige head and anberbrown beer. Nose is fruity apricot and strawberry, bretty and wheatmalty with nice phenolic hoptouch. Good taste though missing bitterness IMO and bit yeasty hangbitter. But next to that bretty, tasty, bit of sourness and overall tasty. Well carbonated and easy drinkable brew."
"D- goes down fairly easy for a beer with an ABV of 8%, a very interesting style, I look forward to trying more vareties"
"This was one of the sweeter Biere de Garde's I've had. Not much in the way of earthy flavors, unfortunately, it seems less of a 'rustic' beer than other BdG's (i.e Jenlain.) A good beer overall."
"Maybe my choice of shrimp and beef wraps were not the best with this great ale, but I loved the ale anyway."
"Overall: Surprised me I have to say, I first sampled this years ago on a trip to France and the Fermie-Brasserie Beck and their marvelous Hommelpap. Back then I recall this being less palatable, but now, it impresses, maybe its changed, who knows?, I do note with interest that my penciled entry into my Woods/Rigley Beers of France book from the late 90s has it listed at only 7.5%, interesting. Cost me $8.99 and whilst it is at the higher end of what I usually pay, it did not disappoint. Well worth a try, or a revisit if you were disappointed first time around like I was."
"An OK beer is the best I can say. Not any obvious faults except the low carbonation, but not that drinkable."
"Overall - An excellent beer, very drinkable. Recommended !!"
"Always a strong choice for an amber biere de garde that I oft skip over in favor of Jenlain. Very earthy beer in many respects."
"cheers..."
"I feel this is a little thick and syrupy going done, and the high ABV does limit drinkability. Nonetheless, this is an excellent beer and I will be buying it again."
"Im currently reading Markowskis Farmhouse Ales, which is a wonderful study of the biere de garde and saison styles (like the bottle label, he lists this as a biere de garde). While his descriptions are great, tasting is believing. This particular example combines a healthy dose of malts with complex aromas and flavors, and does it all without being overbearing. Zen-like subtly and balance."
"The label says Biere de Garde, but it's here as a Saison. Whatever. Poured out to a pumpkin orange color with a well formed 1/2 inch head and good lacing around the interior of the glass. Aromas of caramel, sweet spice, pumpkins and some earthy notes. Taste was medium bodied and slightly complex; flavors of fruits, spices, sugar, and ginger were present, as was some hints of herbs. Not bad. Mouthfeel was fair, not too weak yet filling enough to make the beer quaffable. Fair drinkability, this brew wasn't bad overall. I'll likely try some of the brewers other offerings."
"This particular Choulette might keep its pants on, but it's in no way less alluring."
"Nice, this beer looks great sitting in a chalice.Tawny reddish brown with white lacing. malt on the nose with hints of hops. This is a very rounded amber farmhouse ale. Autumn flavours make this almost like a French Fall beer. A slight Belgian type finish lets you know the region. Very drinkable and quite straightforward in its approach."
"A snort is earth, either a particular traumatic adolescent shove into the dirt or an exploration of vegetable garden biology the initial contact is of soil. Soil and natural syrup, nut oil and bark, charged floating honey, the sweat of voluntary labor and expectation haunt this brew."
"Satisfying smooth but unexceptional biere de garde, well carbonated even harsh. Attractive light brown rum color. Moderately fruity yeast, grape like, lemon, sugar, nuts, pepper . Musty initial aroma, mild barnyard. Medium mouthfeel, probably good with fish."
"750 ml bottle, corked and bailed. Best before end 05 on label."
"75 cL bottle with undistinguishable freshness date. Clear copper color, fluffy off-white head, fading as i type. Smell is sweet and funky, you can definitely smell that belgian yeast, with some subtle licorice scents. Taste is full and fruity, with pepper and licorice, slightly sweet, yet butt and large with hops and alcohol finishers. A very nice beer, I like it, although it is only my second saison. I would recommend this one."
"This is more sophisticated than I would have expected. Really a subtle, beautiful, well- balanced beer. Just tops."
"The packaging consisted of a green 750 ml bottle, with a champagne style cork, and a wire cage. When the cork was pulled, a satisfying pop revealed that the yeast had been nicely active in the bottle. Poured into a 16 oz wine goblet, the body was clear amber red with moderate carbonation, and could be easily mistaken for a wine. The aroma was also somewhat wine like, with notes of cherry and oak and very little if any hops. The taste was smooth and refreshing. The body was very dry and woody with an astringent tartness, but almost no sourness. Fruits like cherries, red grapes, and pears were also abundant. Floral hops showed up in the middle of the peppery finish. Mouthfeel was surprisingly full. This Bière de Garde tasted much maltier than my previous experiences with beers from the related style Saison, and exhibited fewer funky flavors. Overall this was quite an enjoyable beer, which will most definitely turn me into trying more of its brethren."
"PS: The label says 8.0% abv."
"$6 for a 750ml in MI (that's cheep!)."
"Thank you to Hart at the Sharp Edge for the recommendation. A really nice biere de garde, with a good apple sweetness that fits quite nicely. Quite good, and despite the cost, this is one that I'd have again."
"Appearance: Amber tone great amount of off white cream colored head very nice lacing belgian style fine webs. Aroma: Vinous grape tone, sweet barley wine like malts are lingering with a touch of honey infused there wild tones farmhouse bready yeast and bites of peppery qualities. Taste: Awesome wine like tone to it, amber malts send a caramel spot of flavor tart apple in the finish with the spices and slight farmhouse funk playing a factor in the overall flavor, good stuff. Mouthfeel: Soft in the Belgian sense, soft water brings about a lighter to medium bodied ale with a creamy texture to it. Drinkability, definitely good stuff effortless to consume I may have to try this one again. A bit expensive but well worth it especially if you in to the biere de garde."
"My buddy calls this beer the ""French Defender"". Pours a orangy amber color with a thick, soft beige head. Big malty aroma with hints of fruit and mustiness. A bit fruity (concord grape) in the taste, with an ambery, biscuity and nutty malt profile. Yeasty with a honeyed sweetness as well. Finishes a bit dry and smooth. Recommended if you like the biere de garde style. Alcohol is noticable, but surely not overwhelming."
"This beers highest marks come in the nice pour a big pillowey head that settles nicely and sticky a nice medium amber color to enjoy.Aroma is like powdered sugar almost with some slight spicey notes and pizza dough aromas.Taste is definently malty with a little irony taste I didnt think it was overly sweet.Supposed to be good with food will have my other with dinner."
"Flavor has nice malt at start, very sweet, but finishes very dry with a like acidicness that keeps it from being cloying.  More body then other bier de gardes samples, also more alcohol in the finish.  A nice spicy hop finish.  Malt is still very simple, but great complexity with nice muskyness working well with floral and estery character.  Well balanced.  This was the best of 5 bier de gardes sampled in one night.  Still though, I dont really care for the style."
"Very nice biere de garde, deep amber colour, lots of caramel malt flavours, slightly sticky sweet start, but quite dry, bitter slaty finish, i quite liked it, but a bit sticky for me."
