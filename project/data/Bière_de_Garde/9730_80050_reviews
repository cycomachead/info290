"Food match: I give up on this one... cheese platter? Brasserie food? My tongue is far too confused for my brain to make the call."

"To me this is a perfect day for a French country ale,a beautiful spring day.Pours into an oversized wine glass a clear light golden with a half finger white head leaves a sheet of lace as it settles into a frothy mass.Musty notes in the nose along with bready malts,faint leafy hops are detected as well.A little sharp and prickly in the mouth from a good amount of carbonation.Dry on the palate with real crisp breadiness, herbal sharp hops in the finish,the dryness makes it very drinkable.A quaffing country beer that is uber food friendly,a good choice to start the beer drinking day."

"Overall : a medium beer in the style Golden Ale."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice effervescence and head, a little spider web lacing. Nose is yeasty and spicy. Yeast, citrus pith, and spice. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"O - Not a bad BdG but Tres Monts is a far better example."
""
"Good moderately high carbonation."

"M&O: moderately effervescent, medium-minus bodied, the flavour profile is intended to be complex but the result is a messy beer where the esters rein freely, hops fail to compete despite so much effort invested (3 hop varieties?) and the attenuation level could’ve been tuned higher to render a better drinkability. I really find very little to like about this beer, so will not try it again for sure."

" The flavor is somewhat herbal from the hops with a light fruit tinge from the yeast which has a subtle apple/pear like flavor with mild sweetness from the malt and a slightly honey like tinge with subtle grainy quality. Overall this is a tasty bier with some nice yeast components in the flavor with mild maltiness and fruitiness making for an interesting belgian ale. I would recommend this if you enjoy the style."

"This is pretty good! I like this representation. Not terribly crisp, nor very fruity. Lots of esters that mix with the hops to create complex flavors that border on tropical. I'd go at it again, for sure."
""
"Pours a light gold. Aroma of musty yeast and sweet grains. In the taste, quite Sweet, like refined sugar. Not very bitter. Metallic. Herbal Saaz type hops. Only faint bitterness. Alcohol is mild. Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation. Overall, this is an average, everyday table beer. The strength was there, but the flavors could have been more pronounced, this was quite light."
""
"Overall: as I said, perhaps not the most complex bière de garde, but one which has a subtle sophistication that really rubs me the right way. Wonderful stuff."

"Very nice - tasty and balanced. It looks good, with a predominantly yeasty aroma/flavour illuminated by subtle aromatic hop notes. The body is great; it glides over the palate like silk. The influence of Belgium and the US are discernible, with a yeast profile that reminds me of a Belgian blonde and hopping that recalls an American pale ale. A solid effort that goes down almost too easily; worthy of your time if you come across it."
"O: This was a pleasant surprise (found it at the convenient store next to the BYOB restaurant I was having dinner at and bought it on a whim) and had some decent hints of saison as well. Easy to drink and paired well with the spicy pepperoni pizza I was enjoying."

"Interesting and quite quaffable."

"D: Very high. This is a pretty complex beer, which is pretty easy to overlook because it is so well constructed. Despite the complexity, and because of the construction, it is highly, highly drinkable."
""
""
""
"D: An eminently drinkable brew. Very nice for style. Delicate, complex, and intriguing. Refreshing and wonderfully sessionable."
"It's light and bright, and slightly sweet. Carbonation is soft. This is easy to drink, and would seemingly pair with almost any food. It's a nice beer."
"O: Very nice biere de garde. Very saison-esque but it's lighter and crisper than most with a nice hop presence (but it's no west-coast IPA of course). I guess I would describe it as a mild ipa and a saison hybrid. Tasty."

"Nice to see France getting in on the American-influenced beers (along with Britain and Belgium) - this is pitched as an IPA/biere de garde hybrid. Three hops in here (from 3 continents, apparently), and I'm guessing there's both traditional and US in there, along with NZ tropical fruit. Adds up to a multi-layered hop kick which, together with a very soft body, makes this very easy to drink and a great dinner table beer."

"I recommend that french beer 'Bellerose' for all the beer lovers who want to discover and appreciate new flavor and taste! Enjoy."
"To sum up my ""Bellerose experience", I would say it is the perfect beer to share with some friends around couple of nice French cheese!"
"My drinking beer buddy on his recent trip to France and Belgium brought back some local bottled beers for me to try. Bellerose was one he found in France. Who knew the French make some pretty great beers besides wine. This Belgian IPA pours like a typical IPA with some medium carbonation. Smell was right on with American craft IPA with hints of hops and taste was hoppy but not overwhelming so probably IBU in middle of the pack. Overall this IPA is one I like but my local beer store does not carry it."
