Flavor is overall sweet and richly malty up front. Bready, honeyed malts with floral noble hops. Slight acidity and dryness in the finish make if refreshing in spite of the initial richness. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight with a prickly, strong carbonation which works so well with the flavor profile. Pretty good stuff.","goochpunch","Jan 03, 2014"

Once I past that hurdle, using a flat head screw driver as a wedge to remove the staple and a little luck removing the cork barefooted, get the joke, I was pleasantly surprised at how much the taste of this fine brew grew on me until the next morning when I awoke to go to work and couldn't remember who won the football game I'd been watching. After a quick Google search I discovered it was the NE Patriots on top and this close to addicting beer on top too. In other words this is one incredible beer!","BeerFooting","Dec 23, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some good spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of grape, apple, hay, grass, pepper, honey, earth, pear, lemon zest, bread, and light fruity funkiness. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength and complexity; very pleasant. Taste of apple, grape, honey, herbal, hay, grass, pear, lemon, pepper, earth, clove, bread, and cracker. Light earthy tartness and herbal spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, hay, grass, earth, pepper, clove, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of fruity flavors and earthy spiciness; with nice complexity and no cloying flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly crisp and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed on the finish at all.

It goes well with anything you'd use white wine for - cheese, fruit, delicately seasoned seafood.

Excellent carbonation, and fantastic lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is spices, some yeast, malt, and slight funkiness. Very smooth, refreshing, and clean smelling. Taste is similar to the nose- nothing different here. This beer is super smooth, spicy and refreshing. I don't get any of the 8.5% ABV in the taste at all. This would be an incredible summer beer- if you don't mind the higher alcohol, and don't want a session brew. Overall, this is good- but maybe a hair short of great. Still, I would get this again.

3.93,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"3 Monts pours a crystal clear goldenrod, with a buckshot of lemon shining through upon being held up to light. The fluffy white foam that sprung up after each pour always had good height and head retention. Lacing started out solid, and only got nicer with each subsequent pour. The nose is a little timid, but does feature a very nice, delicate balance between pale and stone fruits and peppery aromas. The flavor is a bit more robust, but still centers around that fruit-pepper dichotomy. There's a bit of honey that joins in with the apples and pears up front, and a subtle warming from the alcohol that comes in along with the spicy phenols. The mouthfeel is absolutely phenomenal. The body is surprisingly light given the solid malt presence, and the carbonation is expansive and active, Belgian at its finest. 3 Monts is a great beer and a very good Biere de Garde, one I'd be more than happy to have again.","axeman9182","Nov 03, 2011"

A little dried ginger, especially on the finish, this beer is crisp with a light fruit character - red apples and maybe some pears? The flavors on this beer are so delicate that the power of suggestion definitely has its way. The finish is gorgeous.

The flavors were similar to a Belgian beer without so much emphasis on the yeast. Tart apples, lemon zest, sugary-sweetness, pepper, herbal and grassy notes and a light mustiness.

Pours an interesting clear straw color, with 2 fingers worth of fizzy white heading. Lots of carbonation appears to be in this beer as evidenced by the many bubbles rising to the top of the glass. From smell I get lots of grain and hay, a bit of funky barnyard...yeah that is about it as far as smell is concerned. Very complex flavor, minerally, spicy yet sweet, more essences of funk and bright grain tastes. Mouthfeel is light, and as expected, very carbonated, almost like sipping on funky champaign. Leaves an interesting numb feeling on the teeth as well, which I suspect is the strength of the beer talking. Drinking a glass or two of this is no problem in my book. I can see how some might consider this to be a cousin to Saison in that they share some of the same complexities and farmhouse connotations. 3 Monts is a winner for me, paired nicely with some sea salted pita chips and hummus.

I must admit that I was a little apprehensive when I purchased this,because my last experience with a Flanders Red was not so enjoyable. I will never let my naivety rule my beer purchasing again,I made a wise decision picking up the 3 Monts! I will try a Flanders Red again,but for now I think Biere de Garde is the top dogg. Upfront it's a bit spicy and complex with light fruits(pear and white grape) and graininess that is earthy and seemingly aged to perfection. Subtle alcohol warms the belly and drys the pallet. The carbonation is something I have never experienced,it's very soothing and soft,a nice contrast to the peppery flavors that bite the tongue.

It was a very light yellow and highly effervescent. Aroma was very faint and smelled like lemon zest with a bit of maltiness. Flavor was a bit sour (that lemon zest again) with a lot of maltiness for such a light smelling and tasting beer. I would recommend this beer as I found it very interesting.

Pour of golden hue, with super creamy fine froth, off-white. Flavor is a bold fresh spicy lemon zinger and bright white teas. The estery attitude bowls over the rising alcohol notes in a furious percolating battle for top spot.

I am new to Biere de Garde, and I now am in love with it. It is in a brown bottle with an oblong golden label and an annoying metal strap ontop of a cork. When you get through the ""obstacle course"" of entry containing the mines and ""booby-traps"" you can enjoy this tasty beverage. I poured this golden ale into a snifter and had about an inch of head that leaves pretty quickly. The carbonation was perfect to me, lots of bubbles espcially in a snifter. The smell was great, like honey, brown sugar, medium hops and a goon malty smell. Now for the taste... This is a good beer, pretty hoppy and almost like candy. Pretty sweet but not overpowering, a good ratio of sweetness. kind of fruity, as it got warmer it had an after taste of an apple maybe, just a hint of a delicious golden apple, also as it warmed, i noticed that the warmer it gets, so does the throat most likely because of the alcohol which is very evident from the beginning. The 8.5% ABV will creep up on you quickly, I was giggling like a schoolgirl after about 2 in a row. This is a great beer and is probably now one of my favorites, I like the beginning the middle and the end of this beer, well not the end because that means it getting empty, but you get the point, I highly recomend this beer to anyone.","KALIKGOLD","Dec 06, 2005"

With all of the carbonation this beer dances across my tongue. The finish is sharp and herbal, with a peppery bite from both the carbonation and the yeast by-products. In fact, this beer is quite floral in some ways, quite dry as well. Contradictorilly, this has some the nice clean notes of a pilsner (crisp malt notes up front), which compliments the other flavors quite well. This is very akin to a dry white wine, perhaps a Savignon Blanc, though it is not as acidic. It does have the sharp, spicy, dry fruit that a S-Blanc has.

Mild tartness upfront in flavor yields to a combination of bittersweet alcohol and lingering light caramel malt.  Mid palate dry, cracker - like graininess and understated hop bitterness contrast the light caramel sweetness.  Moderately bodied, w/ a lower carbonation than the norm for style that allows for immediate enjoyment of the smooth mouthfeel.  Minimal outgassing is necessary with this brew.

The finish has slight hints of bannana.  Complex, bold, smooth and fruity.  It is something to savor.","frank4sail","Aug 29, 2002"
4.47,13.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: This is a pretty special brew, so complex and is better off pairing with a hearty meal. Grilled kielbasa with sautéed yellow squash and zucchini (butter & 3 Monts) was a perfect match.","Jason","Jun 17, 2002"
3.94,0,4,5,3.5,4,3.5,"Light yellow, fine/frothy head.  Big estery aroma, some grass and earth notes mixed in.  Lots of banana.  Really exceptional smell.  Vinous flavors, fairly complex and wine-like with other notes of earth and rum-raisin spice.  Complex at the swallow.  Real notes of bittering are notable in the acidic side of the brew.  A little over-carbonated to my tastes, it becomes more pleasant if allowed to sit about 10 minutes.  I'm sure fans of the style love it and I'm making an effort to extend my appreciation as well, but not a favorite.  Hail to beer diversity, however.","ADR","May 13, 2002"
4.38,11.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The first sip was shocking. Earthy and bold. This beer had a mustiness about it that, initially, I thought was odd. Add a hop bitterness and low key tang. Each successive draught made it clear that 3 Monts was a complex farmhouse type ale that I was compelled to drink. Like licking a 9 volt battery, unpleasant and exciting at the same time. I will buy 3 Monts again because it tastes good and it's unique. This beer really evokes the small European craft brewery vibe that makes me feel all warm and alive.","inebrius","Apr 27, 2002"
4.5,14.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"well, i am never dissapointed by this brew, robust, yet subtle at the same time, amazingly round palate, bitter, savoury, a regular in my fridge!!! Original rating (well it was actually a re-rate of a original rating) starts here: i'm growing hopelessly addicted this beer. which probably isn't good for my bank balance. Light gold in colour with little head. Aroma is of oak, malt, wet paint, kerosene and also a vinous smell aswell. Quite a full body, salty, bittter, oaky and vinous flavour. Theres one thing for shore though this beer is awesome, sit back and enjoy.....","rastaman","Feb 16, 2002"
