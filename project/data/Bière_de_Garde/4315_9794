4.54,17,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Thiriez Amber pours a clean creamy orange  amber with a little haze and a 2” off-white foamy head that quickly dissipates. Caramel and fruity notes dominate the nose augmented by spice and floral notes. Light short cake covered in stone fruit and a trace of caramel dominate the palate with a moderate hop accent on the finish and a touch of tartness for balance. The carbonation is superb with fine soft bubbles that give a luscious mouth feel. It is very smooth and thirst quenching. The body is medium.","pat61","Dec 04, 2014"

3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O: This beer tastes unique for a French bière de garde because it's a little sour (but not to the degree of a Jolly Pumpkin beers) and pleasantly adds an interesting twist to the taste. It is quite easy to drink and the bit of sourness also masks some of the grainy malts and earthy yeast.","metter98","Jan 27, 2013"

3.92,1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A decent farmhouse amber ale, the inherent fruitiness rolling nicely with the friendly yeast jabs, and an agreeable, varying hop bitterness helping keep things interesting. A wee bit complicated, so better if you've the time to sit back and contemplate. Otherwise, it also slips down alarmingly fast, if that's your bag.","biboergosum","0"

4.12,6.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a very hazy amber with an absolutely massive white fluffy head. Head persists throughout, sticks all over the glass. Aroma is very musty, grassy, and has an apple fruit sweetness. Flavor is similar to the nose; sweet/tart apples, pale mallt sweetness, and finishes with a slight metallic/acidic sourness. Some grassy hops in the finish, but it is muted by the yeast spice/funk character that is associated with a saison. Llight to medium body & well carbonated. Slightly more malt forward than your average saison, but this one is still very refreshing. Drinking really well on this hot, dry day in Boston.","muttyd","Dec 24, 2010"

4.17,7.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"M&D--Both are excellent, although the ABV is a touch high for such an inviting beer. Hey, can't complain. Overall the creamy champagne feel is where it's at--I'm sleeping in the hayloft tonight. Viva la funkay!","TheycallmeTim","Sep 11, 2008"

4.3,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a cloudy orange that carries a brown touch. Nose is slight antiseptic. Flavor carries the same. A bit wilder than I would have expected really. Slight citrus is there (oranges). But the antiseptic really keeps a constant presence. I have to say that it's really dry too. Feel has a well bodies liquid and the carbonation is slightly lower. It's interesting that this is a biere de garde. It strikes me as fairly wild. Overall this is something worth trying, but you really need to be open to the slight funk that lambics and wild ales bring to be able to fully appreciate this one.","RblWthACoz","Mar 31, 2008"

4.22,8.8,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The taste was a complex malty blend of sugar, toffee, with some raisin and apricot and some peppery spice, along with the faint sourness associated with belgians. The flavor was long-lasting and finished with the pepper and extended with some satisfying hoppiness.","farHillsBrewer","Jun 24, 2006"
4.18,7.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"1 pint 9.4 oz bottle $9.99. The aroma is sweet candy sugar, sweet malts, mild raisin notes, some citrus and spice a soft floral aroma that is very inviting. The body is a bright copper/amber color and supports a massive three fingers thick head that is ivory white, fluffy and lasting. Fore is dry and grainy with toasted breads, mild baked raisin and caramel flavors, honey and sweet malt. Very tasty. The carbonation is biting and gives some crispness to the rounder, lightly sweet base flavor.","Jredner","Beers"
3.48,-10.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Thiriez Amber isn't a Biere de Garde that I can recommend. I find it interesting that the most delicious and most accomplished version that I've ever had--of what is one of the most Belgian (and French) of all styles of beer--was brewed in Michigan, USA. For the time being at least, Jolly Pumpkin's excellent Oro De Calabaza is the style leader in my eyes.","BuckeyeNation","0"
4.07,4.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer poured a hazy copper color with a bubbly tan head. Nice nose, less spice forward than many beers of this style. Its more about the yeast. Just a ton of yeasty bread dough followed by light spice, a little cardamen, some white pepper. There is some dark fruit dates, and a little pomegranate on the finish. Flavor has more of the yeasty quality, I really find that refreshing. More spice than I get on the nose, I think this beer may have a little pepper in it. The heat on the finish feels more like pepper than alcohol, but I could be fooled. Loads of sweet malt come through midway. More of the pomegranate, dark caramel, a little bit of pear. Nice light mouth feel, Good drinkability. The only thing I dont like about this beer was the shower I got when it opened. It was a little too carbonated.","carln26","Apr 30, 2006"
3.31,-14.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Overall: I had the distinct pleasure to visit Brasserie Thiriez way back in April 2003 during my annual Easter Belgium trip with Wakefield CAMRA. At that time I wasnt too taken with the range of beers to be perfectly frank and the Amber was my least favorite of all of them when I sampled it at the brew at the Brewery. Even now with some improvements, it still not one of my favorites. Needs to do more to earn its farmhouse moniker, right now, if youve ever seen the Thririez Brewery youll know what I mean when I say, that it is too stainless and clinical and still AAA - An Average Amber, at best. An Amber Alert Thank You to BigHuge for sending this one West, much appreciated.","TheLongBeachBum","Apr 22, 2006"
2.77,-28.6,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"So this beer is an orangeish amber color. Dirty white head. And LOTS of it. More than half my glass to begin with. Aroma is lemony, pepper and yeasty. Some hay as well. Herbal hop traits too. Taste is candy like in swetness, but earthy in the hop department. The mouthfeel is quite spritzy and very gaseous. Not impressed.","Bighuge","Apr 09, 2006"
4.32,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer is light and refreshing, yet still manages to have a nice heft to it that makes it a bit satiating as well. Refreshing, yet satiating I really how the beer strikes a balance between these two, disparate descriptors. As the beer loses a bit of its spritzy carbonation it begins to become a touch more satiating, but it is still not heavy or chewy. The malt character is quite nice here as well; I really like how the best Farmhouse Saisons can have such a pronounced malt character despite all of the other exotic yeast characters and flavors.","Gueuzedude","Feb 24, 2006"
4.42,13.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Large bottle, capped and w/o freshness dating, bottle calls this a "rustic farmhouse ale", not sure how it lands in the "American amber/red ale category"?... Pours cloudy, dark amber, with active carbonation and lots of tiny bubbles continueing to stream upwards. Head is light tan, frothy, long lasting and leaving coating and thick lacing. Nose is brightly of citrus peels and some light chocolate. This ia a brightly flavored and tasty brew, notes of vanilla, honey, citrus, chocolate, caramel and toffee,yeasty breadyness, floating under the surface, lovely stuff, complex, smooth and nuanced. Well worth a try, yes they do brew world class beer in France!","Billolick","Dec 17, 2005"

3.96,2.1,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Taste: Excellent presence in my palate, much more malt body than I expected, it finished off chewy with an unripe exotic fruit flavor, like a caramel coated mango. This is my second solid offering from Thiriez, I'll try to seek them out more.","Goldorak","Oct 19, 2005"
3.85,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a very drinkable beer. I very much like it. Now is this something I would be in the mood for often? No. It hits the spot today and I would think this would make a great session beer or a great beer with baked fish. I purchased by bottle in Iowa City. Worth a try.","bditty187","Sep 01, 2005"
3.73,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability & Notes  One of the more drinkable farmhouse style ales out there, mainly because of its subtle flavor and alcohol on the low side. Amber is a good intro to French/Belgian farmhouse ales for those afraid of funk and unidentifiable flavors, which are sadly two of my favorite things.","OldSock","Aug 04, 2005"

4.6,18.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Scented delicately of cinnamon, vanilla, blueberry paste and caramel, this very amber colored liquid produces a mouthful of glazed nuts, chipped concrete and brown bread flavors. Very clean, yet unmistakable as a farmhouse ale. Tangy, bruised peach and nectarine fruits toy lazily with mildly astingent earth and nutshell flavors. There is nothing aggressive or gaudy about it, just serene, shy farmhouse ale prettiness. Drink it with boullion and boiled leeks.","putnam","Oct 12, 2004"
4.16,7.2,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Unclear, amber, with some carbonation seen rising up through it. No real head at all, just a bit of white dusting and some dusting gathered in a ring.	Amazing aroma! Fresh tobacco, maybe styrian hops? Nicely hoppy scents, slightly skunky, but good. Smooth feel, low carbonation, you just barely notice it, but by no means flat. Nice hoppiness, caramelly malts, bit herbal. Catching scents of chocolate towards the end... sweet, milk chocolate, but there is no flavor of chcocolate. Very good, very drinkable, very freakin special.","shapudding","Beers"
3.7,-4.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"It started as a jeyser, I probably lost half of the bottle. My floor smells like beer now... By the time I had tried to clean it a bit, there was still a very silky head on the glittering orange ruby color body. Smell is nice and intriguing: some dark malts combined with a sweet and citric fruity aspect, hints of chocolate, and a grassy and woody hoppiness, quite sharp and fresh. Some pilsner-malt graininess in the taste, sweet and dry. Citrus, wood and light hints of chocolate combine to give the brew thickness and solidity, and the result is a very good mouthfeel: dense, full, round and smooth. I didn't like the aftertaste that much though, grassy and citric, slightly mouth puckering. Quite weird for an amber beer. I wouldn't imbibe my floor with that again.","tjd25","0"
