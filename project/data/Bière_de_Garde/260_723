3.52,-7.1,4.25,4,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours a clear orange tinged dark red, two fingers thick of cream colored and very dense creamy head. Settles slowly to a half inch, thick sheet of lace to the end of the glass. Smell: lots of caramel, notes of cherry, dates and peach; toasted honey wheat bread, sourish bread note, subdued spicy hopping. Taste: date bread, caramel, stale grain... then a weird tonic water flavor...then herbal, caramel and toast in the finish. Aggressive, too high carbonation, sticky finish. Mid-sip the carb ruins it, but otherwise it would be quite good.","babaracas","Jan 18, 2015"

4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, 1320 bottle coding. Pours very hazy/cloudy reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, apricot, cherry, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance an complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, apricot, cherry, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. A fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, cherry, apricot, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, wood, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Biere de Garde style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 01, 2014"

High retention and finally left massive lacing. Aroma is sour light fruit, cherry and apple with a faint sweet malt. Taste is quite different, light fruit; apples, pears and stone fruit. Slightly tart, but with a sweet caramel malt backbone. Very interesting. Finishes rather abruptly with crisp, slighlty oxidized fruit and sweet, slightly toasty malt. A slight hop kick in the finish. Light bodied, but active carbonation gives a pleasant spicey mouthfeel. Definitely hits all the Biere de garde notes with a bit of a Belgian yeast suggestion in the background. A tart but not overly sour ale I enjoyed this quite a bit.","LiquidAmber","Apr 11, 2012"

When I tasted the Gavroche, I was reminded of the Sesame Street song "One of These Things is Not Like the Other". Despite my palate being somewhat muddled by the darker beers, I felt this was a bright, light beer that might be a good intro into Lambics. I'm not a fan of Lambics, but this is as close as I've come to one that I liked. Sweet fruit was balanced well with pale malt and the minimal amount of hops necessary to bitter the beer. Definitely open to trying again.","Philousa","Jan 29, 2012"

There is a very slight alcohol burn at the end. Medium to full-bodied and fairly active. My first thought upon the pour was that it was almost "bubbly", which is fitting, since it's from France.

Flavor is a mix of toasted malts, big caramel, and loads of fruity esters. I get lots of apple and pear. A sweetness is present on into the finish, but never feels overpowering nor does it stand out all that much while intermingling with the other flavors. Finishes with a great balancing bitterness and a leafy, herbal, earthy hop presence. The aftertaste reveals an almost roasted malt quality. Mouthfeel is on the verge of chewy yet has a very active carbonation (which never gets so overbearing that it stings). I'm highly impressed by this. Tastes rather "English" to me.

The smell could use some more strength, but the smell is respectable nonetheless. The taste is a bit sweet, with some pale malt flavor up front, a little toffee, and some yeast. It's a little tangy as well. The beer seems to hide it's alcohol pretty well. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, with a nice amount of heft. It fits together pretty well.

I get a mild musty earthyness, with a light tartness that reminds me of cherry, along with a faint tannin-like spiceyness. I like how these all work together to round each other out. Flavors are much different from the aroma. There are lots of fruity notes of dry raisin to almost fig, with a solid musty earthy undertone. As it warms, a spicy cherry-like character comes through to add a nice complexity to it. There is definately a lot going on in this one. It is nice. The feel is moderate, with a very active carbonation. It is both filling yet light as I drink it.

4.13,9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Body and drinkability: Light to medium/light, easy to drik and quite enjoyable. The only downside might be the almost chalklike dryness that may surface now and then.","xymyl","Sep 03, 2006"

2.05,-45.9,4.5,2,2,3,1,"Not a good beer..again reminds me of something Ceres would brew. Chemical, hot, boozy..this beer just sucks and I feel totally ripped off for buying a 4-pack of this.","Mitchster","Jul 22, 2006"
2.63,-30.6,3.5,3,2,4,2.5,"Orange-red body, hazy yet homogenous. Big billowy head, this beer take a little while to pour. The head fades slowly, leaving a little lace. Smell is sweet malt and a little earthy, a touch of honey. Taste is sour with sweet bready malt and a little pepper. Bland, but also touches on cloying. I don't like it, too sweet, annoying. Mouthfeel is sharp but also a little buttery smoothness. I wouldn't consider getting this again.","TastyTaste","Jun 12, 2006"
4.38,15.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I don't know that I trust the French, and I am even more unsure if I trust a French beer ... based on past experience, but here goes with the Gavroche. Pours a sparkling, dark amber red color with a really thick, dense light tan head that lasts and lasts. So fa, so good. Nose is quite malty, but flirts with a strong hop presence. Carries a nice fruity scent as well. Smells quite rich and earthy. Palate is slightly biting with a malt assertiveness up front. Rich and fruity without being too sweet. Make no mistake, there is substantial hop flavors here, balancing out the maltiness quite well. Alcohol is present and detectable. This beer is medium-bodied and finishes quite dry, thanks to the hops. I'm really quite impressed with this beer in every regard. A very good Biere De Garde ... almost a Belgian Saison bred with a German Bock if I were to describe it in comparisons. I like it, I say! My beret off to the French for this one.","beerphilosopher","May 26, 2006"
3.59,-5.3,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a murky brown color ale with a super huge foamy head with good retention. Aroma of grainy malt is quite dominating with a light funky touch coming from the yeast. Taste is quite complex with some caramel malt that end up a bit dry with some sweetness and a light funky and bitter finish. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden. Better the most take on this sometime ambiguous style.","Phyl21ca","May 23, 2006"
3.47,-8.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, Gavroche isn't bad. It would go well with some pungent cheese, as would most fermented French beverages I suppose. In fact, I can sense some earthy characteristics that seem familiar to me from whenever I've had a glass of wine. I wonder if they fermented this in a wooden vessel.","edskirk3","May 22, 2006"
4.2,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D: on the balance, this is a full-bodied ale and, to me, is more like a winter-warmer which I could play withvery satisfying and not to be consumed quickly. BTW, it's very thirst-provoking too, despite its strength...","wl0307","May 20, 2006"

3.67,-3.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Shared this bottle with my brother at UJ's on the Manatawny. The beer poured a hazy redish color into the glass with active carbonation and a medium tanish head. Based on the name it could be confused for a flemish sour or Flanders Red but it is really a Biere de Garde and that comes across in the taste and smell. The aroma is a clean an fruity (cherries, grapes, etc). The taste is a bit fruity with some good hop bitterness and carbonation. They did a good job of masking the high abv in this one. The beer has a medium body but due to the active carbonation, it is not overly drinkable, at least for more than one.","ggaughan","Mar 19, 2006"

Big mouthfuls of fizzy fruits are bound tightly with dry wood tannins. Brandied, boozy, dried red and yellow fruits are abundant. Glazed with burnt sugars. Packed with powdery, dry, sweet brown spice tannins. Dry vanilla husk flavors infuse the dusty, floury finish.","putnam","Feb 17, 2006"
