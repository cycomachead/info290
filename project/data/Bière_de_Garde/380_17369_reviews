"O: A very light brew.  Reminds me of some Belgian Pale ales, like Cuvee de Trolls, but much more foamy in texture.  Got it in China, seeing it’s a Biere de Guard, but not overwhelmed. Cool bottle."

"Solid blonde Biere de Garde, clearly different from a Belgian blonde, not great but worth a try."

"Overal, a good beer. The brew is very refreshing but is somewhat subtle. This is good on a hot summer day but also doesn't make it stand out very much"

"O: This beer is pleasant to drink and doesn't have any strong flavors so it would be well suited to pair with a meal, especially with a dish that uses apples."
"O: The buttery notes brought down the ratings. Otherwise not too shabby."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable - fantastic with food. Kind of wish I had it in a different glass as I think the smell may have come out more, but otherwise a good beer. Definitely one of the better French beers I've had."
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; so please disregard those scores"

"O: what is unique in its (malt) flavors and mouthfeel are about all that makes its ale noteworthy - all in all, it's okay - i could see having it again if I came across it on draft"

"N.B. I tasted this after the official date of expiry .... however, I am quite certain, the beer sustains cellaring of one to two years after bottling quite well ..."
"Nothing here is bad, nothing is too much, it's well balanced. But nothing is terribly interesting either. Overall this is a mild improvement over Leffe as far as regular beer choice goes here in northern France, although it's so close to cider I would just buy that if this didn't have a leg up in the ABV."
"On the nose, we think of lager but with a subtle touch of brown sugar. The body is light, scent, with a bitterness that makes it dirty mouth while she is far from good. A feeling of artificiality complete the observation that beer is just ordinary. Pleasant to drink but there are much better unless you're an absolute fanatic of""Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis"" movie"
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was picking apart the complexity of the aroma. The strong musty earthiness is actually quite inviting, and asks the drinker to dive down deeper. What was even nicer was how many of the aromatic credits made appearances in the flavor, with a surprising cameo from some bittering hops right out front. We found this to be a nice example of the style, as a whole, and were pleased that it was able to contain many of the primary characteristics of it within."
"D - Not one to go for. Smell and taste muted. There are much better expressions of the style available."
"D: Not too interesting for the style. Its fine to drink now but I probably won't buy again."
"I was at the Blue Martini Bar on St. Martin/St. Maarten recently. Besides all of the usual Caribbean beers offered, I noticed they had Leffe on draft. So as I sat down, I saw they had a few Ch'ti bottles behind the bar, so I ordered one instead. First up was the Blonde. Poured into a Ch'ti Triple goblet. Hazy yellow body. Slight carbonation with a moderate sized head. Taste was very nice; something I had not had on this trip: a nice yeasty and sugary Belgian style ale. Mouthfeel was smooth and full. This was a terrific find, and a great beer in comparison to all the other lagers I had been drinking that week."
"Reminded of chablis! Summery, but not as much character as other in the style."
"This is a crystal yellow beer. Smells fairly good. Reminds a good Belgian blond (close to Leffe, perhaps...). Not bad for a French beer. Despite of the 6.4%, you do not feel much alcohol, which helps the drinkability. It should be a good option for a sunny day, followed by a barbecue and listening to Gainsbourg... :)"
"Overall, not a bad brew, but I won't need to revisit."
"I love this beer. I don't care how it looks, I care how about everything else and that's where it scores well for me. I enjoy Maibocks quite a bit, so finding something slightly dialed back just hits the spot for me. Plus, with a ~8oz bottle, at 6.4% you could knock back plenty of these for a good session."
"this one at the Gatineau Select SAQ. Pours light blond with big thick white head, less so in others' cups. A mild spiciness, lighter easy drinking mouthfeel. In fact, I found this reasonable hoppy bitterness, with some sugar and malt, and something akin to an American take on a Belgian blond."
"CH'TI is not the best example of the Bière de Garde style. I'll limit my consumption of it to sitting at home in front of the television or over a low-stakes card game."
"A delightful beer - highly recommended and a great accompaniment to food."
"Overall, very good one, although it felt too light. Very, very drinkable and alcohol could not be felt at all."
"Exellent and refreshing. I'll buy it again."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear golden color ale with a huge pure white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of floral malt with some light fruity yeast notes. Taste is also a very well balance mix between fruity yeast notes with some floral malt notes and a very unique and interesting grain bill. Body is quite full with some great carbonation. Very well done and refreshing with some nice complexity."
"This is totally refreshing, but has a slight warming effect in the end making this a very diverse beer to be enjoyed no matter the temp outside."
"Overall, a decent enough brew; drinkable, but not worth going out of the way to buy."
"Review added 11-18-2007, translated from french 2-13-2008."
"Poured in its own CH'TI glass, golden straw colour, with a big head that lasts forever. Leaves a good lace. Aroma is weak, grainy and lemon, with maybe some honey. Taste is mostly the same, grainy, lemon, with some fruit. I can't say nothing special, not a great beer, but not too bad. Refreshing."
"Pours a gold/straw, slightly cloudy color with a fluffy white head. Smell had slight mustiness, spiciness, and some caramel flavor. Taste was unexpected, but not in a good way, with the caramel flavor dominating and some mild sweetness. Thought this tasted too much like a brown ale or dubbel. Light bodied and not difficult to drink but nothing interesting about it that would make me want to try it again."
"Drinks pretty easy, a nice quencher, nothing super mid-blowing here, but the cleaness of this helps drinkabilty. A training wheels saison, but I preffer this to some OTT saisons I've had"
"Again no real mouthfeel, so no drinkability either!"
"D: A bit repulsive at first, I grew to really enjoy it. Once room temperature it becomes a rather interesting beer."
"The mouth is moderate with just enough carbonation to get by. Pairs well with sharp cheddar and monterey jack. A good beer but nothing I would seek out in a store that has a large selection."
"ChTi was a decent, albeit relatively expensive ($10.95/750ml) Blond Biere de Garde. It appears to have been brewed by the Brasserie Benifontaine, the same brewery which produces the notably less expensive Castelain Blond Biere de Garde. All things being equal among Blond Bieres de Garde, Chti was enjoyable, but not as much so as its relative Castelain."
"Another Ireland purchase. Never seen any of these Ch'ti beers here in the US. Pours clear and golden with a large pillowy white head. Smell is rather funky, musty, earthy and grassy. Quite herbal and dry. Earthy notes of hay and dried fruit balance the herbacious hoppy finish. Bubbly carbonation. Finishes dry. As this beer warmed it began to grow on me more and more, though it still is not one I would seek out again. Nonetheless, it's worth a try."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. Purchased at OUAV in Richmond for $10.99. Back label has stenciling that is 12/01/05. The bottle says Biere de Garde, this beer is not a Saison and not quite a Biere de Garde. A very light and refreshing beer, I could see opening a bottle while sitting as a small cafe in France."
"The head was decent but didn't last long enough. Hard to get anything from the smell in the bar; some notes of wheat and anise. The taste is interestingy round, very creamy, almost like sour cream. Notes of white wine, fruity but a bit dry. The mouthfeel is quite thick and a bit chewy with some spicy notes. Kind of still from the tap, but I liked it."
"I paired this one with some sharp cheddar cheese to draw out the apple flavors. A competent take on the bière de garde style, but nothing amazing. If you're interested in trying a bière de garde, I'd recommend starting with Jenlain's first. Still, a decent beer and legions away from the lamentable French macros."
