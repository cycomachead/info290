"O: Good drinkability. Good beer"

"Not my favourite, to be honest."
""

"It is a mix of a Tripel, Sour and a bit of Belgian IPA. Worth a try, not sure I would have this again."
"BOTTOM LINE: I probably wouldn't get this again because there are better beers for the price, but I would get it again for about $5 per 750ml. Nothing really special about it."

"O: I remember drinking this beer way back in the mid-1990s when this was a very interesting beer but unfortunately it did not stand the test of time for me, the industry has moved on but these guys have not changed in the least."

"A fine beer, and definitely in the Belgian blonde wheelhouse. I could drink more of this; main complaint is the lack of carbonation. I see it's listed here as a biere de garde, but that's not how it strikes me."

"All in all not bad for being teen years old."

"Overall / Drinkability: Very very very drinkable beer. I wish I had another or two of these which makes them quite dangerous at 7.5% ABV. Smooth, simple, tasty. Went fantastic with fettuccine Alfredo, and I believe this would be great with a lot of other meals as well. Fantastic beer."

"Notes: Not impressed."
"D ~ A decent example of the style, but things didn't cohere through the course of the beer. A bit overpriced. Will not revisit."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth with light carbonation, a medium body and a light feel. A real nice beer that went down easy and would be a good session beer. Not the most complex beer, but very drinkable"
"O - I really wasnt a fan of this beer. The metallic aroma and flavor destroyed this beer for me. Theres hints of something really nice to the beer, the good green apple skin qualities, but its all wiped clean by the metal."
"This Blonde is a bit sweeter and bit richer in body than I expected. And it’s a fairly potent brew for the style, but overall a nice, easy-to-gulp brew."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the surprising inclusions throughout the taste. After a somewhat questionable aroma, the beer delivered to the tongue some esters and phenols which were totally unexpected. There was some nice blending throughout, and even some hop on the finish, giving this brew a little rejuvenation."
"Clear amber color. Nose a little white wine (one feels indeed raisins) with light winds of tannins (probably due to the cork). Entry into mouth a little acid, but the drink quickly became silky mouth rounded and has good hops (and usually cereals) fairly well controlled. The finish reproduces the hops, with a lemony side, to provide a good aftertaste."
"For beeing a light lager this Blondie is not pale at all. First I thought the smell was unusal and confusing.But the strong elements of citrus and herbs from north France are actually very tasty after drinking the beer at several times. You will learn how to love it. Jenlain has more of an attitude of an amber redhead blonde with special elements of honey and apricot notes, nice colour, crispy at first. Served at 8 degrees it tends to feel more creamy and has the foam that goes well with food. Warmer, Jenlain has a full body taste and is something of a springbeer. Jenlain Blonde is also more worth while for the female tongue. Dont ask me why.Ask your girlfriends.And remember thatJenlain is indeed french...You hated Piaf at first too, gave her bad reviews, you did not see the splendor, the rest is history"
"Drinkability: This is my first beer of this style, and I rather liked it. It seemed a bit too heavy on sweetness and a lack of balance prevents it from being great. Still, a good beer and one I wouldn't mind having again- I'll definitely try to find more brews of this style in the future."
"Overall - A solid beer"
"Not a bad taste, though. It's malty in the center, some spice all around and a semi-strong crisp snap. I don't the anise that I tend to expect from BdG's. It's a good beer, easy drinking, but I think the blond style gives it a bit of lighter touch."
"D: A high amount of sweetness reduces the drinkability of this beer. The next time I have this, I would try pair it with dinner."
"drinkable, nice example of style. Not the best Belgian blonde I have had, but certainly not the worst either. Would make a decent gateway beer for a beginner."
"Drinkability- Way more drinkable than the one bottle I got from who knows where. If I find more I'm getting it. I'm somewhat shocked by the lower ratings it has received."
"Poured into snifter. Pours a hazy brownish-orange, a little head and some lacing. Good retention. Smell is a bit tart, some sweet malt and grain too. Taste of sweet malt, slightly caramelish, with some fruit...mainly the sweetness. Mouthfeel was a little fuller than light (if that makes sense) and smooth. Overall a good beer, just not quite there. I do have to say the ABV was masked very well."
"Typical of the style there is some mouth to the brew and it lingers in the finish with a malty, slightly alcoholic note."
"Overall, this was a bit disappointing as I'm a big fan of the Biere de Garde style, which I think is a very underrated style. I probably won't reach for this one again without lack of a better alternative, but I would like to compare it to some of Jenlain's other offerings."
"Not a beer which I'd go back to. It was too sweet to be enjoyable. There are plenty of better options in this style to spend your money on."
"D-This is a tasty little beer with a fair bit of character."
"The off flavor makes this one less drinkable for me."
"blech... 3monts was so much better..."
"The pour was a light amber color with a two finger white head. The nose is faint but it was bready malty with notes of yeast. A full body creamy beer with a bready malty taste hints of caramel and nuts. The finish was slightly sweet and very clean. Overall an okay beer but it has a price tag."
"D: not a bad drinker; definitely a beer to be shared and paired with something bold that complements its sweetness (a spicy dish strikes me as ideal, like Mexican or Indian)."
"This beer started out with some promise, but alas no. It pours a golden orange color with a decent creamy, slightly efforvescent head, a bit of lacing too. The aroma right out of the bottle was definitely a bit musty, but that mellowed to a sweet maltiness, and some fairly typical Belgian yeasty floral notes are coming through. The taste is quite off. There is a bite to this beer that is not good, although there are some of the clove type hints, a big palate, and Belgian type yeasty floral sweetness, but this is all terribly compromised by a finish that is not good. There is a cheapness to the finish, that detracts substantially from what could have been a decent Beglian Blonde. The finish is a bit perfume like in its bite and it just lasts and lasts. This one is going down the drain. It's unfortunate."
"Not bad..."
"I actually kinda dig this one. It's far from a great beer, but I think I like it. It's really like a Euro Macro Lager brewers version of a Belgian Pale Ale. Kinda cool."
"This was a very satisfying, refreshing brew. It could maybe be just a touch drier and not quite as sweet, but still a very tasty beer."
"The taste is candied oranges up front, and relatively ends on a sweet note."
"Pours a clear amber with a nice sized crème head. Nose is nutty and woody. Flavor is smooth with a slight woody tone to it. Touch of sweetness there, but not overdone at all. Its just a touch. Feel is good. The right level of bubble on the tongue and a smooth liquid experience. Highly drinkable and very much worth trying."
"Pours out a chill-hazed blonde with lively bubbles and a frothy, decent sized head. Leaves some sheets of lace. Smell is a mix of honey, fresh baked bread, stone fruits, and floral hops. Has an interesting cedar-like mustiness to it that is just great. Flavor leans toward a sweet and jasmine-like flavor with hints of white raisins, mint, and passion fruit. Bready and overall nice. Feels rather soft in the mouth and has a solid low-to-medium weight. Nice drinker and reminds me of a mix of a pilsner and a blonde ale with a lot of interesting complexities."
"Pours a clear, gold with moderate head development that settles fairly quickly. Smell is sweet and malty with a faint, underlying skunkiness. Peppery spiciness to the aroma. Taste is sweet with a nectar-like quality. Mouthfeel is a little on the sticky side. Carbonation is adequate and finish is dry. Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. Fairly average, but definitely worth drinking."
"Drinkability was pretty high for me, as I really enjoyed it, and it went down quite easily. I've got a penchant for the more sugary beers though, so I can see how some might not care for it. Still, with only two glasses, I'm not sure how easily I'd be able to suck down another bottle or two. My favorite style, and a pretty nice example. My biggest complaint would be the slight metallic tang, evident in both in both the aroma and taste. Also, best served cold to keep it clean and light."
"Drinkability: Would go really well with almond encrusted halibut. Wish I had some now."
"Drinkability- Not bad. A good every once in a while beer ."
"Note: There's a stamp on the label that says 09/2005 so this sample is pretty darned old but it was still a tasty brew. I'd like to try a fresher one for sure."
"I was hoping to be able to say wonderful things about this beer, but sadly it didn't live up to my expectations. A good beer that I was expecting to be great."
"A very nice easy drinking beer."
"Thanks to Stephen for finding this rare example."
"This is an enjoyable beer but a little too strong for sipping on a hot summer day like today. I'd probably enjoy this more in the early spring or late fall."
"Poured a light soft yellow amber with a thin white head and no real lace or retention. Smell was light and fruity, apricot, figs, and a grainy aroma mixed in with a nice light body. First impression was very nice on a warm night. Lots of body, a little slack on the carbonation, but not slick or oily. A good solid performer. Lots of intricate flavors, especially as it warmed. Overall this was very nice, and a good Blonde ale. I could easily put down quite a few and was pleasantly suprised by this. Definatly a recommended one here."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, decent representation of style but it just seems to be lacking a little something that causes it to fall short of being a really good beer. There are definitely better beers available within the style."
"M&D: light-bodied, quite spritzy but not overly fizzy on the texture, but it drinks pretty thin overall due to lack of body and rich flavours. I'm afraid this beer is a (nearly) total disappointment (to me), even though it's not terribly expensive (1.39 quid)."
"Looks ok ,slightly hazy golden , small tight ,bubbly white head. Smells OK too, mostly malty, with a small hope presence. Very sweet taste, but it goes fast to leave a slighly buiscuity semi dry finish.Some fruitiness too . Mouthfeel is average. Not bad over all. Would be nice in July/August."
"Overall - Pretty disappointing.. i enjoyed the Ambree and was expecting more from this... Just too sweet and bland for my liking..."
"Opinion: Obviously I didn't care for this one. It is not just that the beer is old and way past it's prime, it is that you can tell that its prime wasn't all that great to begin with. Perhaps it is that I am not much for most (not all) French beers. They seem to have a common flavor that is rather sharp and metallic, so I guess it is the water. Anyway, I won't be seeking this one out again any time soon."
"BB 14-09-2007. Bit of white head and pale and clear golden beer. Nose is quiet papery and oxidised malts. Sweetish in nose as in taste and missing any bitterness and quiet watery with it. Hard to believe this has 6% abv. Watery mouthfeel and runs down easily."
"Slight chalkiness is evident. About average for the style in drinkability. Overall- pretty pleasant."
"The nose was very lame. The palate redeemed itself. The mouthfeel was lovely. And this beer is damn drinkable. What the hell? Why are Duyck beers jiving with me so? This would make a great summertime beer; Id drink this when Id want something beefier then a Pils or Kolsch. I purchased my bottle in Council Bluffs, IA. I bet I buy more. It is simple but quite nice. Try one, I say."
"Overall: An enjoyable beverage, if a rather expensive one. A nice change of pace but it lacks finesse to justify the high end price tag, so I will not be picking this one up again. An expensive above average Blonde which has many lower priced domestic equals."
"Drinkability- Found nothing really wrong with this beer. Nothing really stands out about it being bad and nothing really sticks out about it being exceptional. It was fairly refreshing and I would probably buy it again as it was only $5.99. Definitely worth a try. Looks like I got the only unskunked bottle out there."
"Avoid."
"The taste is poorly balanced, to extreme, no definition...am wondering what they are trying for here? Over sugared grapefruit seems to be the result."
"Drinking this beer would have been better on a hot day, to quench a thirst. Overall, not a bad beer, and definitely not bad for the price. It is not one to seek out, but if found cheap, it can be a good purchase."
"Jenlain Blonde is a Euro pale lager that has designs on something greater, but has no idea how to get there. It's my first beer from Brasserie Duyck and it just might be my last. I'm fairly confident that the French can brew good beer, I just haven't seen any evidence of it so far."
"The Dignified Little Sister of Jenlain Amber. The bottle boldly proclaims Neveau! Its lightly sour in a very interesting and refreshing way. The microscopic but assertive carbonation plays masterfully with your tongue. The nose is rather dull, slightly musty with a bit of hay and grass and a little lemon. The head is like white moose. The taste is a bit like a light version of Affligem Blonde would taste. Not very impressive."
"not my cup of tea.. er, beer. Not terrible, definitely not worth scouring the store for. for me one goblet was enough."
"Overall Impression: Interesting. Its like a light Belgian strong pale ale. I enjoyed the bottle and found it worth a possible session."
"Fizzy and light. Drinkable but boring. Maybe I just expected more than a Heinekin clone from the makers of the fine biere de garde."
"Well, I'll have to say that I'd take a pass on this one. If I get stuck with one in the future, I'll update this review if the skunks are hiding."
"Drinkability: While I was able to finish the whole bottle, I'm inclined to think it was due more to a lack of good judgment than anything else. This brew has no balance, no complexity. It drinks like a lager and not a good one. I suggest you skip it."
"Overall, this was a decent beer but not interesting enough among the belgian pale ale elites. I'll stick to Jenlain's biere de garde instead."
"Next time I am in St. Barths I will buy some more of these. Not that they are THAT good, but rather they are unique and a conversation piece. Much better than Carib or Red Stripe."
"The bottle I am drinking does not look like the picture provided, and instead it looks like the picture for the biere de garde but says ""original french blonde ale"" Anyways the beer poured a pale golden color with orange hues to it. The head was light and fluffy and settled nicely. The smell was dominated by sweet malts and a light tropical friut scent. The flavor was good and if you are a malt lover that you will feel right at home with this baby. The big malty flavors hit you right off the bat with a complex sweetness that is not overbearing but the thick mouthfeel kind of kills the drinkability for me. Good to try but not going to make it to my regular rotation."
"Large green unusual bottle, rarely seen in these parts, pours golden and clear, slight haze after the last pour, but I saw no yeast on the bottom of the bottle. Large rocky white head, with better the average retention. Leaves nice, fine and well spread out lacing. Nose is dry, with a slight juniper note. Quite dry and crisp, but also with notes of more juniper, and a slight soapyness later on. Finishes dry. Lacks the usual yeast, floral notes and spice expected in a Belgian pale. tastes like a pilsner, Heineken?"
"I chose not to drink the whole thing (not even a pint) given I have the choice of other better beers to drink tonight instead."
"Pours a very clean golden with a huge rocky head leaving big globs behind on its way down,staying with the clean theme this beer has a clean aroma dry biscuity malt and herbal hop almost like a good German pils.Taste has a light herbalness to it with a firm dry malt backbone with an iron note showing thru but light.A Belgian Pale Ale?I think not more of a German pilsner and at 6% I think incredibly easy to drink.Am I drinking the same beer as the others who reviewed this?Mine wasnt skunked Iam sure that helped."
"Nice foamy white head, mountainous. Clear gold hue displaying minimal carbonation. Big malty aroma, pils like with an exquisite sea air component melting well with the grassy and hay-like farmhouse elements. The straw scent may come up a bit too much up front to my liking, but it definitely makes me feel for a pils. Musty, mellow weird herbs, alga or with an aquatic feel anyway. Light palate, malty despite a hop crunch toward the finish, but it never becomes too dry. Pleasant foamy mouthfeel, biting carbonation, rounder than a pilsner, but just as refreshing."
"Very disappointing."
"Pours out a pale golden color with a nice amount of carbonation that stays with you until the end. So far so good right? Well the smell was pretty average. Light dose of hops along with some slight malts, and some grainy like aromas along with some fruitiness hidden in the background. Smelled almost like a pils. Sweetness and more sweetness. This beer got more unbearable the more you drink it. The cloyingness is just too much. Some hops do bite, but it's so sweet that it doesn't matter. Some fruit also pokes through, but again, the sweetness takes over. Mouthfeel was light-medium with some medium carbonation, but it's quite cloying. 22oz bottle of ...yuck! Never buying this again, but I will try their beire de garden to see if they can redeem themselves."
"Flavor matches aroma with a sweet grainy body that drops quickly out of the way and moves to a dry crisp finish."
"24 ounce green bottle."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is decent. It has a mild pale malt scent with a slight green bottle skunkiness that lingers on the nose. It smells refreshing, but is a bit dry. The taste is a little above average. It has a very sweet flavor. It boasts of pale malts, light hops, and a thick finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a weird brew. It's light in color and aroma, but it has a thick mouthfeel and a super sweet taste. I guess it's good, but nothing I would ever buy again."
"A huge disappointment from Brasserie Duyck after the excellent Jenlain Bière de Garde. I'm still interested in trying their bière du printemps, but I'll steer clear of the Blonde in the future."
"Comes in a beer bottle that's kind of interesting to look at, but I ain't too sure it's really beer. Try it if you're curious, otherwise give it a pass."
"It appears that this beer is a dumbed-down version of a Biere de Garde. Clear, more mild. There is no exotic fruit, nor earth, nor even the slightest peppery bite of yeast to give it structure. It is malty and sweetly alcoholic. The texture is vaguely creamy. The intention seems to be good, but the result is a beer that is in a stylistic limbo. Well crafted nevertheless."
"The best part about this beer was its bottle. Otherwise i found this beer very bland. Golden in clolour. Dull malt nose. Somewhat dry, with a light malty finish. I think MississaugaMatt hit the nail on the head when he said, ""vegetal and corn-like."" I don't think i would ever buy this beer again."
"Very drinkable and light would make a great beer on a hot afternoon on the middle of the summer."
"650 ml bottle. I don't normally remark on the packaging - as it differs from country to country, etc. - but the tall, painted label, green glass bottle with the ridged neck is very nice. There's only one problem... the beer is skunked! That's fairly disturbing since it's not cheap! It pours a hazy golden with a very light orange cast and a thin, creamy, bright white head. I can't pick up anything in the aroma beyond the skunkiness. Based on that I'd guess that it's got a fairly hoppy aroma when fresh, but I can't be sure. The body is medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that leaves it creamy and surprisingly smooth in the mouth. Interestingly, it does not seem to be bottle conditioned (no yeast in the bottom of the bottle), although it might be with the yeast still in suspension (explaining the haze). The flavor is very nice but quite one-sided. There's a light fruitiness (soft summer fruits) and a rich, very soft and nicely rounded, sweet and lightly earthy maltiness that's well entwined with a light hoppiness. Surprisingly malty! What hops are present seem lightly grassy and fairly spicy. The bitterness is well-balanced and supports the rich malt character and dries out the long finish as well as leaving a lingering bitter note. I'd hope that I can one day taste this beer without the skunked character."
"This is a very mild and drinkable beer that would seem very appropriate when you are looking for a light-bodied beer, particularly in the summer.  A great example of a lawn-mower beer."
