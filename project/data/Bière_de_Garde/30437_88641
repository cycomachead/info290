This beer does not have the sour or earthy tones I expect from a Bière de Garde.  I find this one to be far more drinkable than most.","smcolw","Dec 15, 2014"

The taste was nice with heavy malt starting off and in the middle giving a very mellow and earthy tone to the beer while the finish had just enough hops for a refreshing crisp end. Liked this one a lot.","WhiteHillsStore","Oct 30, 2014"

Looks and tates a bit like a barleywine with obviously less ethanol. Wonderful spicy cinnamon aftertaste with lots of roasted malt and a pinch of hops. Looking for an IPA alternative that goes well with both meats and dessert? I would definitely recommend this!","shigg85","Nov 21, 2013"
