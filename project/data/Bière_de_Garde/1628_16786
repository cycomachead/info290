Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear golden amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweet biscuit, light toffee, orange zest, a twinge of lemon peel, and a slight hint of what may or may not be apricot.  The taste brings in more of the same, some spices tossed in for the sake of it, particularly black pepper and mild clove.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a pretty nice beer, one I could see drinking again, though it's unlikely to find its way to the top of my prospective list.","TMoney2591","Feb 03, 2015"

That being said, I would look for this again, and would look for the Brewer again as well.","JLSIV","Nov 30, 2014"

Aromas of caramel, toast, pear, apple, grape, bread, clove, pepper, floral, herbal, light coriander, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, bread, pear, apple, clove, pepper, light coriander, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, bread, light fruits, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with decent robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. A bit too dry on the flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good biere de garde style. Good complexity and balance of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

The smell upfront is a strong spice which I can't quite place, but I'd describe it as savory. This is a beer that may need some meat to back it up, definitely needs to be paired with a meal. The spice fades a bit as I drink on revealing a sweeter honey like flavor beneath. Lacking in hops I wanted something with an older mustier taste to it.

A sweet honey taste wins out over that taste, however, and is followed by a hoppy and sort of abrupt finish. There's a bitterness to the finish. The beer becomes further complex with an alcohol zest that lingers after the swallow. It's a really interesting beer and complex but fairly refreshing and easy to drink. One criticism, however, is a slight wateriness to the mouthfeel that may be overlooked if your not looking for it, but it is noticeable.

Taste follows nose - very tasty and lacking some of the bitterness I've come to associate with beers of this style. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and a somewhat crisp finish. A pretty nice beer I have to say. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.","Jwale73","May 28, 2010"

In terms of Belgian beers, it was on par with Leffe. It was agreeable, but a little sweet and without much depth. It had a herbal sweetness liek gum or tea and a cleaner amber bread flavor than you usually have in a Belgian. Good beer, but not great.","tempest","May 08, 2010"

I'm sure that's not something a brewery wants to hear, but that's how I perceived this one. I have five more, so perhaps there will be something that I don't notice in the next few.","irishking1977","May 06, 2010"

Tastes very juicy and fruity with a nice orange peel bitterness that builds and some accents of coriander. Some bready notes round it out. Very refreshing and a wonderful thirst quencher on a hot Southern day- but with enough flavor to keep things interesting. A solid beer in a style that's hard to find.

A nice sweet malt body that is pushed around by the coriander flavor, some pepper, honey, and a general fruity flavor. Not overly sweet seems to have good balance to the sweetness. The coriander is a bit too present for my liking. A nice moderate body with crisp carbonation, drinks very well. Finishes sweet for the most part with perhaps a slight earthy bitterness.

The taste is similar, but not so heavy on the citrus; the malty qualities of grain, with sourdough and marigold tang, dominate, with an exceptionally rich malty aftertaste and a surprisingly bitter finish. This is one heck of a complex beer. It's highly carbonated but not fizzy, fills up the mouth very well.

The retention of the cap was great, the lacing good. The aroma was of dried apricots, barley, pear and yeast. The flavors were of wheat, lots of biscuity malt, light alcohol, some honey sweetness and pear. The dry and grainy flavors of the malt made the alcohol a little pronounced, but that's good for the style. The bitter finish lingered on my tongue.

It has the funkey barnyardy mustyness, but its not the dominant aroma. I get lemon soaked raisin and a light graineyness. Nothing too big, but working very well as a group. Flavor is very nice as as well. Initial swallow gives a slightly tart, musty feel, but it does not linger much after the initial swallow. I get lemony citrus and light grainey notes, but nothing really The aftertase is just slightly musty, lemoy and even a touch sweet. The feel is light to moderate with a moderate carbonation.

4.57,21.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Auburn in color with a billowy off-white head and even carbonation. Aroma is light, mildly spiced with a grape like sweetness to it. Light and invigorating are the keywords for the flavor as well. Starts off with a bit of lemon/orange crispness -- just a hint tart but not at all puckering. The beer develops a sweeter character in the mid-palate which strengthens as it warms. Finishes with a gentle, floral hop flavor, and just a delicate note of burnt/roasted malts lingers into the aftertaste. Somewhat creamy in mouthfeel from the head and even carbonation, but overall light-bodied and refreshing. Very, very easy to drink a whole bottle of this. Another winner from Southampton.","mzwolinski","Jun 03, 2005"

4.72,25.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Love the big classy bottle as it suits such a refined beer as this. Mid dark gold with a very fruity nose consisting of peaches and apples that are left on the orchard floor. The beer tastes very old but young at the same time. I loved the attention to detail and the fact that it tasted like straight from the farmhouse in France or Belgium. Food friendly yet able to stand alone as a sipper. Thanks to malto for exposing me to this wonderful brewer.","canucklehead","Apr 12, 2005"

4.13,9.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Carefully poured in an imperial pint glass, formed a 2" dense eggshell head, with lazy but plentiful bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. A orangey golden brew, with spotty yet heavy foam lace. Nose is spicy pale malts, with a tad of funk making things interesting, and a hoppy crispness. Taste is a slightly sweet maltiness, coupled with a clean hop snap, and closes a bit dry on the tongue. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. Enjoyable brew.","ppoitras","Mar 22, 2005"
4.5,19.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This was a 750 ml corked bottle shared with 2 friends. The color is an amber/orange blend with a thin head that goes readily to laciness. The beer is spicy with a pale malt aroma. The flavor is a sweet citrus combination of orange, tangerine, and a clean malt flavor. The beer taste rather crisp because of its carbonation. The citrus flavors leave a lingering sweetness on the palate as well.","BrewMaster","Oct 17, 2004"
4.32,14.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A well pronounced grassy and herbal hop profile greets my tastes buds, along with notes of butter and caramel, rhubarb, odd spicing and lemon. Yeast character of another Southampton beer reminds me of Fantome. Funky, complex, dry and very very good.","Crosling","Sep 30, 2004"

4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Cloudy orange bodied with a nicely laced white head sticking to the snifter. Big malty aroma. Baked malt, cookies, bready dough and clove-ish yeast. Candyish donut sprinkles. Somehow hoppy too, though its subtle and definitely not an/some american hop(s). Rather yeasty palate which procures a moderate dryness all the way through. Very surprising taste after smelling, both are very different with a sweet aroma and a dry palate. Youve got to respect a beer that surprises you. Still, I found cloves flavors to be a bit overstated, but I love the gentle mustiness, earthy and cerealic (almost oaty) flavors. Nice balancing ending bitterness. Lively carbonation, fluffy mouthfeel. Much more flavorfull than I anticipated. Great execution (of course). Cheers to biruchan and schoolteacher!","Rastacouere","Sep 06, 2004"
4.16,10.6,5,4,4,4,4.5,"This is an exceptionally well-composed replication of a Belgian ale. The taste is comparable to light Belgians such as Duvel, but with a tart wheatiness. A true pleasure.","RedDiamond","Sep 01, 2004"
4.07,8.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy orange-copper color. It is pretty well carbonated, which supports an off-white to tan colored head. I get sweet fruity aromas of pear and apple up front, as I dig deeper I get notes of toasted biscuits and malt, plus some subtle spice notes as well. The beer is fairly dry up front, with an initially gassy middle and a sweet cider like finish. This is another fairly clean, yet interestingly malty interpretation of the style. Almost has a meaty-chewy malt character to it. This is quite tasty and has a hearty medium bodied quality to it that is most likely from this being an all malt interpretation of the style. The fruity yeast notes are nice, though it could perhaps use some more yeast spiciness, but this is a rather weak complaint on this otherwise wonderful beer.","Gueuzedude","Jul 28, 2004"

3.94,4.8,3,4,4,4,4,"Once you get past the initial aroma, the volatiles escape, things settle, and a really very decent Bière de Garde shines through. A nice treat and well-worth trying. And man, watch out for that skunkweed ... it's pretty damn intense!","Todd","Jun 27, 2004"
4.42,17.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer extricates itself from the 750ml green bottle an obfuscated copper color, the head Brontosauric in size, creamy in texture and after dissolving the lace forms a thick and clinging blanket upon the glass. The nose has a the aroma of over ripe apples with a nice yeast presence, citrus crisp, also notice a hint of mustiness, a fine sniffer this one, start is lightly sweet, pleasing malt presence with the top light to middling in feel. Finish is ferine in its acidity, the hops dynamic in their spiciness, very dry aftertaste, a very fine representative to the style, quite pleasing to the palate and a great beer to share on Fathers Day with all the fathers past, present and future, also my thanks goes to the Evil One his own self, Master Davo, Great BA, Great person, and best of all a Great Friend!","Gusler","Jun 20, 2004"

4.47,18.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," The body is pretty big, but not huge. The flavor is absolutely wonderful. Dark sweet fruits and balance well with spices. There is a big malt presence, but the spices and herbs really make for an interesting experience. It is very smooth and rich. As the temperature starts to rise, it becomes even more deliteful. This is yet another winner from Southampton.","ElGuapo","Apr 12, 2004"
