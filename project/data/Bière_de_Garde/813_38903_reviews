"O: Okay, but not my favorite flavor."

"For the most engrossing, captivating beers elements of time and place either evaporate entirely or they are irrefutably reinforced - this beer does neither. It embodies neither the proud (often overlooked) French brewing tradition nor the proper capacities of the Bière de Garde style. While it's a fine enough beer, it doesn't leave much to recommend it for."
"O - At 8.5%, this is incredibly smooth, easy drinking and dangerously drinkable. Easily one of the smoothest 8%-ers I've ever had. I will be grabbing another bottle of this."

"Pale amber colour, 2 fingers of fluffy white head, good lace here as well. Smell is yeasty with a bit of spice, apple and candied fruits, crisp grainy malts with just a bit of lemony hop, finished with more spice and some earthy points. Taste goes south a bit here, some of that candied fruit from the nose, light bitterness but moderatley sweet all the way through, hard candy flavours with a odd smoke like flavour toward the finish here. Medium carbonation and medium body, pretty nice feel. Not a bad beer, but I am begining to suspect that I'm not a huge fan of this style though, still fairly drinkable and would drink it again if someone handed me a glass but otherwise I'm not going looking for it."

"Overall - Good not great. Worth trying once but not something that really stands out enough to buy again. It became a little boring to get through the 750ml size bottle."

"Overall, decent, but not great. Not something I would return to."

"Overall I enjoyed the experience. Would I race out to grab another? No. Would I recommend trying this for the Biere de Garde novice? Sure. I will say I would love to try this from the source."
"Overall a good summer beer but know the 8%ABV sneeks up on you."

"Not a terrible brew. Overall, decent. I'd have it again, but not often."

"O - A fine, clean Biere de Garde. A little overpriced, but I'd definitely seek out another bottle and open it at a more appropriate time of the year."
"A delicious Belgian pale ale/golden ale that's kinda what I like to think is similar to the monk's paterbiers. But I'm used to more aged character or even a more cork-like woodiness in beers listed in the Biere de Garde style."
"O: I haven't had a lot of beers in this style; this one isn't bad, although I don't think the style is to my liking. Still, an ok tasting beer, I don't regret the purchase."
"O: A beautiful bière de garde, well worth seeking out."
"Dr: Disguises its ABV remarkably well, but fails to offer the wealth of flavour expected for the style and presentation. Fairly drinkable, but disappointing overall. Not really worth a go unless you're into generic would-be abbey beers."
"Carbonation seems to belie the big head. It feels a bit thin and I think more bubbles would give it a very nice 'pop' to it."
"Picked this up at a Wegman's in Buffalo because I thought it looked interesting. Pours a bubbly orange colour with thick white head. Great head retention with lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of grassy hops with some sort of fruitiness. Lots of yeast in the aroma too. Fairly sweet flavour. I'm really enjoying this beer. I would definitely have this again."
"Poured into a glass and there was a decent amount of head. Smell is very good with a light amount of fruit. This beer is very smooth with a great feel. The beer has a sweetness to it, and a nice flavor. Just a well made ale. It would be good to have after dinner. Cheers."
"250ml bottle, poured into leffe chalice. Half finger head, clear, amber colour. Sweat yeasty smell. This isn't a complex beer, it had a nice sweet taste, there were hints of pear and apple. It was smooth, as the alcohol was well hidden its possible to drink a few of these but it could get dangerous at this strength."
"This one starts off so nicely in its presentation and it starts to lose me at the first sip. I still found myself finishing the whole bottle with the help of some blue cheese and crackers, which it paired with exceptionally."
"It is pretty good, they could have dialed down the sweetness but other than that a solid, subtle brew."
"Easier to take this one down with a better mouthfeel. A little slick, and it seems to showcase every tenth of the 8.5% abv."
"D - While this isn't the best beer for the style its still a damn good beer that I could drink again worth picking up to try sometime"
"D A pretty good beer, alcohol isnt really noticeable in the flavor. The brewers did a good job of disquising it."
"A nice beer that drinks well. Easy enough for anyone to drink, yet has complexity to satisfy the beer geeks."
"Bronze. Alcohol if this one might think in a beer of this ABV. In the mouth, the hops are good but a little too quiet. Rather we perceive the sun cereals, which are inevitably think of cakes or biscuits wheat just baked. So rather fine taste slightly woody aroma with a bitter aftertaste rather light."
"Taste has a base of light caramel/ dextrine malt, which gives the beer a nice malty backbone. The yeast adds a fruity character with notes of apricot and apple. Bitterness is low. The mouthfeel is a little (too) sticky. This beer appears to be quite similar to Duvel, but without the dryness and bitterness."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a slightly hazy tangerine-gold color. The head was a half finger of yellow-tinted foam that faded to a skim that left pretty good lacing in sliding curtains The aroma was totally appropriate for a Biere de Garde, caramel malt, spicy hops, fruity esters and yeast. The flavors were quite similar and enjoyable with a well balanced malt profile, an alcohol punch in the middle, and a clean finish. The caramel malt really came off clearly and was well met by the fruit notes and citrusy hops. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation good. Biere de Garde is a difficult style to make well and this was one of the best I've ever tried."
"It was a beautiful day outside, worked for 8 hours... Just went for a 40 mile bike ride get back to my house and cracked this bottle open and sat outside in the sun on my deck and just relaxed.... I couldn't have asked for more... You wont be disappointed if your looking for a good beer to just relax with..."
"Pretty drinkable. I wouldn't go looking too hard, but I would enjoy this one again."
"The mouth feel is smooth and creamy, leaving almost no bitterness on the tounge. A very drinkable beer to say the least."
"Drinkability: A very different biere de garde, but the combination of the sweet and herbally bitter flavors don't cut it for me"
"D: It's very drinkable and any tastes of alcohol are well hidden. This beer would make a perfect complement to a nice dinner with French food."
"This beer is lacking toasty, caramel and cellar-like notes that are supposed to mark the style. On the other hand it has enough tartness and spicing to resemble its close relative, a Belgian Saisson. It is better than most macros that can be found on the shelves locally but nothing that I would go back to, at least not on a regular basis."
"From the 750 ml. bottle marked 12.28.09-L27.1.11. Sampled on March 27, 2010. Served about 45 degrees. As I popped the plastic cork often found on these French beers it really opened with exhileration and a nice puff of carbonated mist. The aroma was noticeable right out of the bottle before pouring. The pour was a cloudy orange-pale yellow with an eager, foamy white head that fizzles down after a few moments but leaves a thin lacing all around the glass. The aroma bursts with sensations of wheat, malts, coriander, and other tantalizing spices. The flavor has a bitter tanginess with a dry finale of hops and spices. While the aroma had a non-distinct alcohol scent the taste had a bit more alcohol in the mix. Drinkable? If by drinkable you mean it is easy to drink quickly...then I would have to say yes. It was easier to drink this one than savor it. The 8% ABV hit me lightly at the end. It had its own variety of characteristics which were commendable on the face of it but I still tend to favor Belgian Abbey Ales, at least over this one from France. Still, it was not a bad beer overall. I found it in the Price Chopper Grocery Store in Keene, N.H. It was kind of a stand-alone among the typical nationally known macro and micro brews you see in grocery stores or other bottle shops."
"D: Very drinkable, but the overall flavor is somewhat generic."
"Poured a clear, light orange bronze colour, with a snow white, foamy, craggy head. Smell was average for the style with it's mild, barn-yard ""funk"". Taste was mildly bitter with some nicem European style hops, and mildly sweet, too. A very gentle beer to be 8,5%. Mouthfeel, to me, was a bit light to be so high in abv. Very easy drinking beer, all things considered, and solidly crafted. Glad I got to try this one."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but not entirely flavorful enough to keep me intrigued."
"Nice brew!"
"Drinkability- This is drinkable and somewhat malty, I'll drink this one but I have a feeling that it will be my last for a long time. The other will wait in my cellar and will be ""kept"" hopefully until it becomes better."
"Out of a 750ml swing cap bottle. Pours a pale copper color with a very nice dense white head that left a wall of lacing on the glass. The brew has a fruity nose; some oxidized grapes, sweetened granny smith apple skins, and hay. There is quite a candied aroma to it. The taste is of a weak caramel and apple juice. There is barely enough caramel malt to carry the Biere de Garde classification. The feel is quite light and has soft carbonation which leads to a flat feel. An average Biere de Garde at best; not nearly malty enough. It is a bit tin-like but holds it own. A very blah biere de garde. I would like to see more caramel malt to bring this brew around."
"Overall, I think this beer is decent. Nothing special or something to go crazy in a search for but worth a try. Fairly drinkable."
"Rather good. Easy drinking and pleasant."
"D- I could drink this up like no other but for the price I will pass."
"D-Decent brew, easy to drink."
"poured with an off white huge foamy frothy textured head and a boat load of lace. Color is a slightly hazy medium to light amber. Aroma is yeasty, malty, a bit hoppy sweet. Flavor's about the same. Body is quite thin but ok carbonation. Not bad beer all in all. Finish is nice. Would have again."
"Overall, this beer is okay. I don't really find it to be very enjoyable to drink as this is not my kind of beer."
"D - This is a nice biere de garde. It has some nice complexities and depth."
"Poured from 330 ml bottle into Unibroue tulip. Best by date is 2/28/09, so we are 7 months past that date but I don't think it is a bad thing that this bottle is out of date. Large white head pillows upon pouring and slowly moves on. Beer is golden in color. The aroma is quite funky with a bit of banana like fruity, clove-like smell beyond that funky Belgian wild yeast. 8.5% ABV is well hidden in this one, maybe because the bottle has mellowed as its gone past best buy date? Pleasant beer to drink, assuming you can get used to the funky nose. If you like witbiers, this beer may be a good transition into the world of funk as it possesses qualities of both."
"An interesting beer that went well with the French dinner, but at at 8% had to go light, as I could feel the effects of just two."
"Nicely complex and enjoyable."
"D - I really dig this beer. A great representation of the style. I'm impressed that there is still some hop bitterness, as this brew is getting close to its ""Best Before"" date. This is totally a beer to pair with food - the acidity and the minerality make this brew a great fit with mussels, scallops, or oysters, and the fruity notes would make this a match for a fresh goat's milk cheese or a wedge cut from a younger, fruitier wheel of Cabot Clothbound."
"Drinkability: A Bière de Garde with nice, subtle nuances and surprisingly quaffable considering the ABV percentage."
"D: The ale doesn't taste as heavy as it is, both a blessing and a curse. An enjoyable ale that is taking me a long time to get through."
"I could throw back the whole bottle, though I'd choose Castelain's biere de garde over this one."
"drinkability: overall a decent beer for my first biere de garde. very similar to a saison which I think it's supposed too."
"D- Excellent! I could drink this stuff till' I went blind. Well worth a try."
"The mouthfeel is right on. A bit of sweetness up front but finishes nice and dry. Carbonation is light but ok. Overall a very nice BdG. Some yeast notes are over the top but still tasty."
"D - kinda pick up the alcohol in the aftertaste but very minimal, enough going on to where its worth trying out again"
"This is a very tasty, sweetish, and floral Belgianesque beer. There is a slightly sharp bite in the beer that is more from the yeast than I think from any residual spices added. This is a medium bodied beer with an 8% ABV that is well hidden. There are some orange rind flavors, some slight citrus notes, some golden blossom as well. A very complex, big palated beer, that is a delight to drink. Well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"This beer pours a cloudy golden orange color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into a firm half inch cap of foam, and leaves sticky lacing all down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of barnyard funk with leathery notes, and a nice bready malt backbone. The taste is more malty than the aroma. There is still some funk, but it is more in the background. The finish is of nice lingering toasty malt. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, I really like this beer, and I would love to drink it again."
"I split this with a friend and I didn't really feel the desire to have more than half a bottle, decent but after this we opened up La Goudale and we both preferred that"
"D- Not hard to drink although i dont know i would drink too much. One bottle was all i needed to know what the beer tasted like and might not get it again. It didnt taste too special."
"I haven't been blown away by any of the three Les Brasseurs de Gayant offerings that have found their way into my glass. La Divine might be worth a look if you love the style and think a French biere de garde sounds interesting. For me, it's one and done."
"Once again a fine beer from France, I really must try and get some more when the chance arises."
"OK, I mainly bought this because it came in a cool bottle. It turned out to be a great tasting and balanced beer but not something I would really seek out."
"D: It goes down easy for a beer at 8.5%, but I'm in no hurry to have another. Unfortunately it doesn't have most of the desirable characteristics of a bière de garde."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry malt with some traces of DMS. Taste is also dominated by notes of DMS with some lightly sweet caramel malt notes. No spices or ester form the yeast are really noticeable and DMS is a bit too omnipresent. Medium body with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol."
"Pours a pale orange/yellow color with a nice, bubbly, three-finger head that had very good retention and left behind some very lovely lacing. Aroma is reminiscent of Orval, some sweet Flavor is lightly sweet, a bit of light fruit taste to it, some pears and orange comes to mind, hints of lemon and grass. Very nice. It's sort of light bodied and the flavors aren't screaming out at me, but it's very tasty nonetheless. Easily drinkable. I like this beer a lot. Plus, the bottle will come in handy for homebrewing!"
"I like this beer and will buy it many more times."
"date consumed:	3 Nov 2008"
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a big dense white head that hangs around for a while leaving decent lacing. The aroma is very bready with some toasted grains and corn on top of the subtle Belgian yeast. Maybe some spices in the nose as well. The taste mirrors the aroma with toasted grains and spices along with a little alcohol presence coming through in the finish. There is a sweetness that grows as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is smooth and clean with a slightly dry finish. An interesting beer that didn't stand out in any way for me."
"Overall: Classified as a biere de garde, this could almost pass as a tripel but for a lack of phenolic forwardness. Very nice beer, definitely worth seeking out if you are a fan of the style."
" This one made me wonder, I knew the French were not exactly known for their beer's and the price for a 750 ML bottle being $4.99 really makes you wonder....why so cheap?? i still think this is a good deal for what it is."
"that full-ish mouthfeel and lower carbonation coupled with the emerging brettanomyces character tells me this beer might very well age gracefully, changing all along the way just like Orval. A year or two from now it should be drier, more effervescent, and very earthy - yumm! I think I'll get a couple of bottles to forget in the back of the fridge and see how they are next year."
"The aroma is yeasty and sweet with malt and spice. The appearance is golden with a better than average head and nice lacing left on the glass. The flavor is like the aroma and fairly well balanced with some emphasis on the sweet. The palate is thin. Overall it's nice with a slightly fruity finish."
"D= My first beer of this style and I have to say I was impressed. This could be a really great warm weather alternative to heavier bodied Belgian ales or to pair with food. I could certainly see myself having more of this around the house! Highly recommended!"
"A very drinkable, solid beer for this style, that quite honestly took me by surprise. This was brewed in France?"
"D = Good drinkability, a very approachable beer. I could happily drink this sitting outside enjoying the afternoon in a French cafe."
"A great beer, and quite possibly the best French beer I have had to date."
"M: A rich, medium body. Smooth carbonation and feel... Goes down nicely. Not really anything huge going on, but a 'safe' and inoffensive."
"This is really excellent beer, and I would say the same about the other two beers I've had from Les Brasseurs de Gayant. I think this is kind of a benchmark for beers internationally. I wish this was supermarket beer."
"Drinkability: A decent, even borderline good beer. Alcohol's a little high, though not for the style. All in all it's an attractive, pleasant smelling, nice feeling beer, but just not interesting enough to send me back for more, I don't believe. Still, worth trying at least once."
"I was quite impressed with this stuff. Very glad I decided to pick it up, very disappointed it was the last one on the shelf."
"It reminds me a lot of some of the more vibrant Belgian strong pale ales. If that is your bag (it really isn't mine), I'd check it out."
"Mouthfeel is light and very dry. The carbonation gives a creamy texture. An interesting selection indeed."
"D - Damn. For the type of beer, I was expecting something closer to a saison or even tripel, but this is superb. It actually has enough malt character to balance out the interesting but often overwhelming phenolic characteristics. I won't have much of a problem downing the whole bottle this evening."
"T/M/D - taste is smooth and slighty malty sweet, again reminiscent of a triple (with less of that candy sugar sweetness, and less complexity). It has a slightly crisp aftertaste too. An interesting beer that I'll try again."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Although not what I would think of as a hot weather beer, it will be great with any traditional summer foods you are serving, especially a good homemade brat."
"An OK beer but it is just that OK, not outstanding. Nothing bad about it but it just doesn't make you say WOW."
"This beer poured a clear yellow gold color and formed a nice foamy white head that coated the glass with lace as it quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, spices, yeast and a slight barnyard background. The flavor was of malt, yeast, and spices that I can't really separate. The body is medium light and slightly creamy. The finish is slightly tart. Not a bad beer."
"**this artisanal brew from France have just hit New Jersey store shelves at a very reasonable 4.99/ 750ml. Its definitely worth a shot."
"Large bottle, with swing top, best before dating on the front label. Pours clear lightish amber, bubbles continuing to rise to the top, under a long lasting fine and tiny bubble white head, that leaves plenty of sticky, classy looking sheeting and lace. Spice, a hint of soap and yeast in the nose. Belgian style yeast and spicing in full flame here, nice take on the style, crisp, flavorful and lively brew. Puckering hop crunch late. Bring on the cheese and salads and enjoy with this one. I liked it, nice to see French brewers getting in on the up scale beer thing."
"Not my favorite style of beer , but this ones worth a taste."
"Drinkability : belle finesse pour une bière aussi forte"
"bittersweet combo. Lacey, with abundant white head on orange body. Yeasty aroma. Smooth drinking with spice mix. Medium bodied and drinkable. Smokeless Joes. Dry finish. Not best biere de garde, and quite yeasty. Above average beer. Grows on you and you could take a lot if you had to."
