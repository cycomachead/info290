"O: Super malted and nice sweet palate. I would like to age this and see where it goes. I would have liked to have more funk and musty notes but overall it a well done beer."

"The mouthfeel was maybe a bit undercarbonated for the style. There was a light scrubbing zestiness and amedium bodied heft."
"O - I am not sure how old this one is but either way it was not too bad but it isn't something I would go seeking out."
"M: The mouthfeel is a little thin, too quick to fly away. The assertive malts and lighter fruit flavors are a nice reminder of the BdG style."
"D ~ I love the balance and how consistent this one improves. So drinkable and with the 7.00 abv, I don't have to worry about not being able to have a few more bombers."
"O: The beer smells great but the sweet apple cider in the flavors make it a bit tough to drink though it does get better as it warms"
"This is my first Biere de Garde. I picked it up while in Florida last week (definitely didn't expect to find Krebs there). It poured a dirty, mop water like copper in color with a one finger off white head that laced the glass. The aromas are interesting. The first thing I think of is oatmeal. It smells like dry oatmeal just after you open the package. It also gives off honey, yeast, pale malt, and some Dortmunder like qualities. It tastes pretty good. It features a good amount of yeast and honey, pale malt sweetness. It kind of has a sweet saison thing going on. I keep thinking of oatmeal with honey. It's pretty tasty. It drinks medium in body and is pretty drinkable. The alcohol isn't present at all and the aftertaste is appealing as well. I found this to be a pretty good beer."
"Pours a very light copper color. It initially has a white head, but can't hold it at all. There is very, very little lacing. Even a goo, heavy swirl won't bring the head back. The nose has some subtle light malt and a bit of faint earthiness. There is a small quantity of dry caramel in there as well. The taste has some light earth and slight hop dryness along with some bread. Pretty basic, but okay. Light body with moderate carbonation. Drinks fairly well; this was enjoyable, though not terribly memorable."
"Drinkability: This was an interesting beer, though it's such a yeasty beer it makes it hard to drink. I mean, I don't mind yeast. I always finish the bottle, yeast included, but this was perhaps a bit too much."
"Thanks BlueOkie!"
"Overall, this one reminded me a lot of a saison, but had some other flavors going on. Decent. I think this is better than the bells jazz series and they were all BdG."
"Bottle. Pours a hazy orange amber color with a slight off white head that collars arouns the glass. The aroma is very biscuity with some real nice highlights of belgian yeast with spice and banana. Some fruit notes as well. Medim mouthfeel. Sweet type flavor up front with some clove and babana belgian yeast flavors. Slight lingering bitter type flavors. No real lace to speak of. Alcohol is not real evident. Overall, pretty tasty."
"Nice, especially for the price. The fruit gets a little too big, even for the style. Paired well with some nutty Jarlsberg."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Thin off white head and orange-amber hazy color. Aroma is fruity, spicy phenolic...well. Belgian. Flavor is a balanced blend of toasty malt, spiciness, fruit esters. mouthfeel is fizzy and light bodied. Boring finish. Overall, a good experience."
"This beer is strange. The longer it sets the worse it gets. Even with different temperatures. It's great right off the pour. Weird."
"D: I was not expecting much from this beer, but it was quite enjoyable. Light and easy to drink with good fruit character."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours a slightly hazy toffee amber with a decent 2 inch white head that leaves just a slight bit of lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma starts off as slightly grainy. Warms up with over ripe apples, pears, and almost a vinous character. Mild caramel and toffee notes. The flavor is very similar. Over ripe apples, yeasty biscuits, a bit of toast, and toffee. There is a slight bakers chocolate bitterness at the very tail of the flavor profile. The one thing that slightly bothers me, is a mild tartness that lingers in the middle/end of the profile. Why I do enjoy it and think it adds a whole level to it, I don't know if its supposed to be there. The mouthfeel is very dry. Finishes leaving the palate craving another sip. Over all this is a mid to upper mid range Biere de Garde. I'm glad to see a brewery in OK trying their had at traditional styles that don't get brewed enough."
"Taste has some nice maltiness to it, a bit caramely and toasty. Belgian yeast strain is prevalent, but still seems a bit cidery and sour (assuming there was no lacto added on purpose). That said, it is still strangely enjoyable and drinkable even with the off-flavors, I easily finished the bomber. Not bad, and I would like to try it on tap to see if it was meant to taste like this."
"I don't come across many good Biere de Garde, much less American versions of the style. This is a gem from OK that I would love to drink again. A soft but noticeable maltiness, fruity yeast esters and a touch of earthiness make for a good brew. Thanks for the bottle, Russ!"
"Poured into a chalice a very nice golden amber color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger foamy/creamy off-white head, with some very nice thick creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slightly yeasty, fruity/flowery. The taste is awesome, one of the best of this style I've had to date, malty, yeasty, fruity, with some caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this one is a joy to drink this afternoon, thanks Lane."
"I had heard great things about this and was pretty let down. Not very flavorful or complex."
"Thanks to TheHand. Unknown abv, it certainly is above 6% and could be in the high 7% plus. Large off-white foamy head on medium yellow body. Some lace. Malty, and lightly spicey aroma, pleasant. Very easy mouthfeel and drinkable. I have had better of the style, yet still a better than average beer."
"D - This is a pretty good American version of the style. Pete's/Choc makes some very fine brews."
"This beer was a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting a much richer, smoother and more complex flavor profile from this brew."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Great flavor makes this brew an enjoyable experience. Smooth drinking. The best thing ever to come out of the entire state of Oklahoma."
"Been saving this one for about 6 months or so. Poured from 22oz bottle into McChouffe tulip, a rich medium golden-orange amber color, with 3"" of dense frothy head. Lots of fine bubbles continue to rise. Head sticks around for a while, leaving a little thin lacing. Aroma is fruity, a touch funky, with apricots and bananas in the mix. Tastes a little spicy, fruity, lots of nice complexity, more than I can identify. Long lingering finish with a little bitterness and touch of alcohol heat on the back of the tongue. Feels medium-light bodied, smooth, very refreshing, medium carbonation. Overall a great beer, easy to drink. Went well with the pasta and salad I made. Probably my favorite of the Choc lineup."
"Drinks great for the style, a very good stab at the style! Nice & refreshing, I'm guessing this one checks in slightly under 5.8% ABV"
"Very good drinking to be done with this bottle. Light enough to enjoy many, and often. The alcohol can creep up on you, though, so watch yourself!"
"Drinkability is above reproach. A quintessential session beer. The abv is medium-high and hidden, so watch out 'cause you will want to have a few bottles of this excellent brew."
"Good beer that I recommend."
"D: its drinkable, but not a good representation of style. Almost takes like a belgian blond."
"Can't say that I've had a lot of beer from Oklahoma, but perhaps I've been overlooking the state. This is not bad, not bad at all. I'll be picking this up again."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, even though it may not be one of my favorites, this is a good, complex beer to relax with."
"Drinkability: Not bad! It's a treat to finally try something from the great state of Oklahoma."
"This is a pleasant, and well rounded brew. Sweet and fruity, with a mild character. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall pretty good, if it were available in my area I would pick it up from time to time."
"A fantastic addition to the Choc lineup. I wish I could try more examples of the style. Pours a spectacularly clear light amber topped with a 3/4 inch fluffy white head that settles to a ring in a minute or so. The nose is all malts, nice light sweetness to it, maybe some sour green apples too. Mouthfeel is very silky. Well balanced, malt forward with an ever so slight tease of what I presume to be hops at the tail end. Maybe it is the power of suggestion but I do pickup a some of the muskiness that is expected with this stlye beer. I consider myself a ""hop head"" yet I am drawn to this beer."
"This is a pretty good rating for my first beer of a style, but I will be looking for more of these in the future. Hopefully the compare."
"I have put back several to see how they cellar..."
"No bias here. This is a very good beer, and the Kreb's bunch should be very proud of this one. I'm in the mood for a little road-trip and a bit of Italian food to pair this one with now!"
"Pours a golden orange with a small, off-white head. Slightly cloudy due to the bottle conditioning and perhaps some proteins? Seems to have the signature hefeweizen aroma. Taste is malty and sweet, with a bit of bananas and cloves as well as a slight lemony flavor. Perhaps they have a little wheat malt in here? The hop bitterness is there and rounds things out, but is somewhat faint. Rich mouthfeel, full bodied. Good carbonation. This is a very good beer, it would be very easy to drink the entire 22oz bottle by myself. Not too overpowering, would make a good session beer."
"I like this beer a lot. I suspect I'll appreciate this beer even more on the second try and will pick up a lot more complexity than this first try. It truly is a world-class beer. Way to go Kreb's Brewing! You do Oklahoma proud!"
