"O: nothing to look for in here, next."

"O - An interesting brew with a great fruity flavor profile. I really enjoyed this."
""
""
""
"O: Could've been a bit more robust, but overall, a decent bier de garde."

"Riding the fine line between drain pour and latent redemption that is never realized resides a beer that should probably throw in the towel before it finds itself falling off the ledge of no return for good."
""
"O-This beer has a nice appearance with a light smell, taste and mouthfeel that leaves the drinker refreshed without the overwhelming flavors some beers are known for."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is decent. Interesting hue, nice head, no real lacing. Nose is nutty with some strange sweet notes. Woody malt flavor with a slight bitterness and hop. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
""
"O - Overall this is a nice drinkable beer. Not the top of the line up for Southern Star but a quality beer."
""
"The body is light but with a particular thickness to it. It's got a crispness that leads to a creamy, mouth-filling smoothness."

"2.75 seems high for an overall. it tastes like the shit beer we drink here in nj.. you know, when we're 16. i'm a grown ass alcoholic now! c'mon! no really though, this is pretty awful... tastes pretty much like a ""ok that's the best they had on tap at the dive, but i'd still rather drink rolling rocks in bottles"""

"O: Overall not a bad beer. Reminds me of a Belgian style strong/quad but much lighter. Easy drinking. Interesting take on the season, i'd give it a try if you enjoy the style."
""
""
""
"O: I think a little more hops could have brought a lot more to this. It goes down easy, but I would have enjoyed more complexity."
""
""
"I didn't really get those farmhouse flavors I would expect from this style. This beer is just a bit under attenuated for my palette. I enjoyed this beer and would drink it again. I think it is great that breweries make the effort to brew beers like this. Maltier beers tend not to fly off the shelf like the ""latest IPA."""
"O - Sweet and candy-like."
""
""

"Pours a hazy burnt orange with no real head just a thin brown covering that fades quickly. The smell is sweet, fruity, with a hint of alcohol and malt. Taste is almost a weak barleywiine, not so much biere de grade, and as you sip a bit more malt like characters come out. The beer isn't as sweet as the smell would indicate, starts with the fruit and barleywine characteristics and finishes with the malt characters. A solid medium mouthfeel, borders on going heavy, but a smooth beer the flavor isn't overpowering. Overall a good beer, nothing amazing but still tasty. Not a typical for the style, but good nonetheless."

"O - I didn't really like this one. Too sticky and sweet for the style with no real balance. Glad I tried it, but not disappointed I don't have it regularly available to me."
"3.5 D: This is a very tasty beer, but the taste could you some more power and the nose could use a lot. Still, I enjoyed this much."
""
""

"Overall: This is a very good reddish beer. My only complaint is that the flavor wasn't stronger. Southern Star is usually known for having a kick and this one, while great, didn't possess as much of a kick as the Pine Belt Ale and the Buried Hatchet. Other than that, good contribution to the line up from the Conroe brewery."
"O: I'm not a fan of this beer. It's really thin, and the flavors are all over the place. I'm not sure how many other biere de gardes I've had before, but I just can;t imagine that this is a good example of the style."
"Overall, this is pretty average effort at the style. It's decent, drinkable stuff. But I'm not going to seek it out at inflated ""seasonal"" pricing."
"O: An easy drinking, good shot at a biere de garde ""frenchy"" beer from Texas."
"The taste is pleasant. It is also unusual - unlike anything. I am not sure if I ever had this style before - maybe once. I would buy it again. I am no sure if it is a good value. IT seems to keep well in the can."
""
"The beer pours a cloudy dark copper with a thin off white head that quickly vanished. The smell reminds me of fresh peaches, with some caramel malt, a hint of apples and spice. It tastes sweet and bready with a hint of green apple and caramel. It's medium bodied and smooth with very low carbonation. I thought this beer was good all around but could definitely improve in some areas."
""
"Fairly bland. The sweetness dialed up a bit without anything to balance them out."
""
"O - Overall this beer is slightly above average. The qualities aren't bad...just kinda one note. Glad to try but something I wouldn't seek out again."
""
"A little more carbonation would be nice though."
""
"This beer has a lot of good qualities, but the mouthfeel has a lot to be desired."
"O: A pretty solid beer, but nothing really special. Does make a good beer for a hot day."
"Light head that dissipates quickly. Toasty-sweet smell. Not strong but evident. Not a lot of hops, but malty. I don't know what this style should taste like but the flavors seem a bit muted. I'm getting a feel for what I should be tasting but it's not really coming through. Mouthfeel is thin. I love everything else for Southern Star, but this one is a miss. Very drinkable, but it doesn't fit the style profile described."

"Pours an opaque brown color with a tall khaki colored head. Sort of watery and bland overall, but there is a mildly interesting aroma of fruit and yeast. Some bready malt is also present. Moderately sweet with a bit of toffee, bread, and caramel. Some yeast notes along with a bit of green apple. The flavor is fairly watery, too."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decently tasty beer and one that's satisfyingly refreshing. I'd like to try this during a hot summer Texas day. I'm not too impressed but it's just fine as it is."
"The flavor of Vivant is anchored by a strong showing of specialty amber malts and fruity, Belgian yeast that lend it flavors of sweet bread and apple. Tingles on the top of the tongue with just enough hop bitterness to counteract the sweet stuff. Grain lingers in the finish with a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is crisp and light on the tongue despite the medium-full body. Overall, a decent beer, but probably not a repeat purchase for me..."

"O- Easy drink, has an enjoyable character to it with the unique combination of flavors. Favors more of the fall side to its fall/winter seasonal category. Another great can by Southern Star."
"O: eh, it's ok. I enjoyed this in the mitts of a number of pales and IPAs, so it was a surprise to find out what style of beer that it was. My wife liked it, if that means anything. Haha."
"O: A very easy drinker with some interesting and unexpected flavors."
"Overall - very well done! A great beer for the colder months, even in Texas, as this is on the stronger and maltier side. I really love that Southern Star chose such a unique style to be their first canned seasonal and look forward to their future releases. Cheers!"

"Very nice beer, glad to have another good one out of the region."
""
""
"This is a lighter, subtle, refreshing beer that is malty up front but has enough fruity/floral hop and yeast notes to keep things interesting."
""
"Overall, it's nice and pleasant. I could drink this often. It's not overly sweet and there's a nice drinkability to it."
"Taste is lots of caramel malts, slightly sweet and reminds me a bit of the bombshell blonde as far as the breadiness and creamy body. There is a toasty aspect that is different and the yeast does not quite throw off enough esters to really shine as a farmhouse ale. More like a decadent Amber Ale with a touch of yeasty fruit. Not bad, it kinda grows on you after a couple tries...first can I had I was a bit disappointed, this particular sample is my 5th can over the past couple weeks and now I am thinking a couple more 4-pack purchases will be in my future."

"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"O- Great new seasonal from Southern Star. It makes me want to try other brews from the Biere de Garde style. Definitely recommend picking this one up to try. The 6-row will also please most macro-only drinkers."

"This is Southern Stars newest seasonal. I think it is a late fall, early winter release. At first try I really enjoyed this, but after a few more tries this does not hit the mark. Good effort though."
