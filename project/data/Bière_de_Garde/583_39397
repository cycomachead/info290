Iâ€™d say this is one of Schlaflyâ€™s top 3-4 offerings. A totally responsible representation of the style. The beer is one of those beers that when you want some real suds, you ask for this one.

3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22 ounce exquisitely painted bomber with a gigantic yeast cake hanging out at the bottom of the bottle. Poured into my Tank 7 glass. Full and frothy white head. Color is a deep copper, darker than I was expecting. Aroma isn't as strong as I would have hoped, though it is certainly there. Notes of barnyard are the first thing I notice. There's some residual sweetness just under the surface as well. I get some light cereal notes followed by cherry and white grape. This is highly carbonated. The mouthfeel is very bubbly and effervescent, and bubbles go on for days in my glass. The taste starts off tart (almost mouth puckering so) and then leans towards the sour end of the spectrum. Again I think of really tart cherries chased by pear juice. The fruit flavors give way to a brief bit of grainy maltiness. Some alcohol is definitely present in the beer, as it is most likely accented by the esters given off by the yeast during fermentation, and as the beer warms these alcohol notes are accented, which can be good or bad depending on your point of view. This has somewhat of a chewable vitamin finish. The Biere de Garde style is a cousin to the Saison, one of my favorite styles of beer. I've had some very good Saisons, and while this one isn't quite top notch, it's not bad, and the flavor profile is certainly in my wheel house.","eclaycamp","Sep 29, 2010"

Lifts a large loose medium khaki head, gong to a 1/4 inch film and nice lace all the way up to where the top of the head was. Musty, fruity and malted up nose. Complex and inviting BDG, some spice, some mustiness, a Belgian yeasty note. More flavor notes floating across the tongue need to be mentioned, ripe pears, and light raisins, with earthiness abounding. Yeasty final pour, adds the expected cloudy light brown look and a hint of nuts. Really enjoyed this one.","Billolick","May 28, 2010"

3.98,3.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a hazy honey brown color with a nice frothy off-white head that slowly settles into a very puffy cap. The aroma has a tart lemony twang along with some belgian or hefe yeast phenol characteristics. The taste takes a 180 from the aroma. The taste is of caramel malt with a rye like spiciness, and brown sugar all resulting in an earthy flavor. There is also some metal and lemony flavors along with some subtle yeast phenols. The flavor is pretty spot on for the style. The beer has a moderate body with airy carbonation, an almost creamy texture; sweet throughout with some sour/tart notes popping through. A good Biere de Garde. It showcases the malt, has a nice earty spice quality and drinks easy. This is a real quality style when made well.","Gmann","Apr 13, 2010"

I typically like their brews quite a bit with some among my favorites but this one is far from the cut. Supporting the idea of a bad bottle or a badly crafted brew I had an intense last pour. Unapologetically I poured the end including all yeast and sediment. Very hazy final serving with ugly to average presentation but at least the flavor picked up a richness close to what this should be like: timidly fruity, very sweet, spicy with cinnamon and sugar dominating. At least it had some aroma with character... Still no tartness, sour or complex earthy notes at any point.","Daniellobo","Feb 04, 2010"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice screen-printed mag bottle. Bottle conditioned, and the pour was appropriately slightly turbid. Aggressive tight head required a careful pour.

Hops are there for a bit of balance, but pretty much just along for the ride. This is quite tasty, surprisingly sour (in a good way) and slightly funky. Carbonation is creamy and smooth and adds another layer of complexity to the drinking experience. Different from most farmhouse ales as it has a darker, heavier malt presence.

3.06,-20.3,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours a very hazy burnt orange color. I mean, I really can't see through it, but I can see bits of yellow around the edges in the light. The head that form is great, nice and white, rises up about an inch, then falls back to a nice ring, leaving bits of lacing around. It looks about right. The smell has quite a bit of tartness, like raw, underripe berry fruitiness. Smells a bit yeasty, maybe a little strong with some fruity alcohol - quite a bit of that fruity fermentation smell thrown out there. I'm not sure how much I really like it. But then again, there isn't just one way a biere de garde should smell. The taste keeps it up with the fruity frementation flavor - the raw yeasty taste. It kind of hides the rest of the beer, as well as the peachy alcohol flavor. As far as everything else, there's a distinct graininess, way more than barley, but it just tastes like raw crushed grain, maybe some oatmeal and/or other cooked grains. I think it has the kind of stuff that you expect, but I think I'm wishing that it was just lighter all-around - it hides some of the things I was looking for. As far as the mouthfeel goes, the beer is a little too heavy, and the carbonation is a little too sharp. Overall, this kind of reminds me of a first attempt at something that a homebrewer tried. I've tasted something surprisingly similar made by a friend. A few of my beers have had this taste. I think it needs work, maybe it should be lightened up, aged a little more, so that the flavors that the yeast should impart can come to the front. The ABV on this seems a little higher and harder than I want too, so it's harder to drink than I'd want as well. I'd be interested to try this again with some improvements. I want to see what kind of yeast character this has.","taylorhamrick","Sep 15, 2009"
4.21,9.6,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy, orange/amber color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, citrus, yeast, hops, and slight alcohol. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, citrus (banana), tart malt, yeast, hops, and alcohol. Overall, a great body, blend, complexity, and aroma.

4.1,6.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle (2007 bottle, orange crown and 7.0% ABV). Served in a Gulden Draak tulip glass, the beer pours an amber/orange color with a 2 inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. (The first glass poured clear, the second was cloudy from the yeast that settled on the bottom of the bottle.) It smells like yeast, Belgian candy sugar, slightly tart orange, peppery spice and a bit of funk. Taste is similar to the aroma, I can taste pepper, earthy malt, yeast, citrus and some funk. It also has a spicy, dry finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with zippy carbonation that goes down and smooths as the beer warms up. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and quite refreshing.

Head lasts and lasts, constantly replenished by the streams of tiny bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Lacing is sporadic but chunky when present. Aroma is clean and citrusy, with a light earthiness. Taste begins lightly sweet, quickly turns to the lemony citrus, which carries through but recedes somewhat at the close to let the sedate mustiness peek through.

4.03,4.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Schlafly seems to pull of these complex Belgian styles effortlessly. This beer pours with bright rust color, moderate haze, and fantastic off-white head formation, retention and lacing-- an overall impressive look. Aromas are part-malt / part fruits with an emphasis on toasty, bready notes. Bruised oranges, lemon rinds, apples, and appricots round out the estery aromas. Mild plastic and peppery phenols also add to the complexity. Woodsy and musty late. Flavors of malt and fruity esters continue their balance. A light toasty flavor is accentuated by herbal hops, and light acidic flavors. Remaining spicy and citrusy til the end. Body is quite full for the style, but lifted off the palate by an airy carbonation. A well attenuated character helps to keep the beer palatable, but it still has a weight that seems high. Finishes with a hit of appricots, lightly grassy-citrus notes and a musty cellar-like quality.","BEERchitect","May 16, 2008"
