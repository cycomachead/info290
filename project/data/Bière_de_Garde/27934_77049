The taste was sweet caramel malts, fruit and Belgian yeasts with a slight earthy tang. It was more subtle than the Shlafly biere de garde but with enough complexity to keep me interested and coming back for more. The Scrachin’ Hippo was great and puts Adelbert’s firmly on my radar.","brurevu","Oct 01, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but nothing too memorable.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 29, 2013"

It’s got thick lacing too! The aroma is dry, very fruity, apples, grape and berries come through very well. Mildly tart, it is medium bodied, some spices do come through cleanly, phenolic alcohol tastes pretty good and is accompanied by mild bready flavors. Some fruit flavors do come through, there is a mild hop flavor in the aftertaste, but it is barely detectable. This is a very good beer and it goes down very smooth.","vickersspitfire","Beers"

3.15,-13.2,3,3,3,4.5,3,"The taste was practically more of the same. Mostly citrus with some young tree bark thrown in. It's got good yeast character that gives it an excellent mouthfeel and some character that prevents it from being thin, citrusy nastiness, but I'm not getting much malt character. And earthiness? Meh. It's just fruity, primarily on the citrus side. Surprisingly fresh-tasting citrus at that, considering that it was brewed 6 months ago. That didn't seem to mellow it any. I'm going to have to NOT suggest this. If you're looking for citrus, but with body (in a way that works oddly well), go for it, but if you want malty and earthy like it claims to be, don't expect much.","ElCommodoro","Aug 13, 2012"
4.17,14.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"750ml corked and caged, the way God intended! VERY assertive "pop" of the cork, this beer wants to be drunk. I know how it feels. It is hazy copper with a big head that settles into a rocky, sticky off white. It smells of bananas, brown sugar, hay, and vanilla. The taste is wood, leather, biscuity and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is tingly and sticky and I know there's a joke in there somewhere. Overall, its a very good beer. Good flavor, not quite as "refreshing" as I tend to imagine when I think of this style but more interesting at the same time. This hippo can scratch me any time. That is what the kids are calling it these days, right?","roblowther","Aug 11, 2012"

Lots of apple and pear fruit notes, maybe white grape, and a hint of banana. There is a mild yeastiness, too. Really an odd, though not unenjoyable, beer.","womencantsail","Jul 18, 2012"

2.54,-30,4,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Corked and caged 750ml bottle. Cork comes out quickly with a loud POP! This thing is crazy carbonated, and a borderline gusher. Head hasnt quit coming out of the top of the bottle. The pour is dominated by head, but has a nice amber orange color to the pour. Great looking beer after it settles down, really nice head retention. Smell- band aid funk, nice breadiness, brown sugar, candied sugar. I theorize that the carbonation issues either come from yeast gone wild in the bottle conditioning process (too much fermentation process in the bottle) or some sort of infection. Tight white bubbles are visible on top of the beer, it reminds me of what some of my favorite wild ales look like. Band aid/plastic smell appears more after the head settles down. Taste- band aid, stingy carbonation. This lacks backbone. I wanted to have some sort of malt presence, but all I get here is a watery presence. I burped, got hardcore band aid. This beer is not good, I will blame it on the bottle being apparently infected, but I'm not sure I will give it another chance. Gross.","lnashsig","Apr 17, 2012"
