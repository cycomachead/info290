"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy amber color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing. Aroma is mostly malty, it smells like dark fruit (raisins), toffee, caramel, apples and some sweet spices. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like dark fruit (raisins, plums), apples, caramel, bready malt, brown sugar, and some cinnamon. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and has a good amount of carbonation. I liked this, and I think it's worth a try if you come across it."
"This is one of the oddest smell-to-taste transfers ever, feels like 2 different beers. The scent+appearance had promise, but it just really lacked elsewhere."
"biere de garde is not a style I personally associate with holiday beer in my head, so this was a nice treat, and a rethinking of the Christmas beer paradigm for me. you could have told me this was Belgian and I would have agreed, the yeast is distinctively so. medium range amber color with some soft hazy and a large foaming off white head od teeny tiny bubbles. ring lacing as it sips. smells of sweet malt, subtle herbal spice, and Belgian yeast. there is a candy sweetness as first in the taste, but it is replaced quickly by a sharp spice profile that isn't immediately attributable to the usual suspects. my guess is that a good amount of the spiciness comes from the yeast, which has carbonated this beer robustly enough to clean up the richer sugary malt. a strange thin fruity finish to this one, caught me by surprise a little bit, apples and pears as it closes. a different take on a Christmas beer for sure, but one I enjoyed quite a lot."

"My second La Choulette biere, I spotted this at my local and I figured I would give it a try since I had hadn't had any La Choulette Ambree' in about ten years. This one pours a rustic muddled amber brown unsure of what color it wants to be in my glass with a big thicket of foaming khaki tan head. Fine lacing left behind on the sides of the glass this is definitely a french style farmhouse ale, not as funky as Belgian saisons/biere de gardes. Aroma has tart apples/green raisins and a thick layer of fresh baked breadiness, very nice mineral water tone as well binds things together with light herbal hops blended in. Flavor is complex a light air of musky horse blanket, with tart apples juicy plump raisins or plums, with a thick slice of bread with caramelized toasted malts playing the key role here. Strength is well hidden I wouldn't have guessed this had that much booze in it with a blind taste, mouthfeel is a nice juicy round middle with a big dry finish. Medium bodied effervescent airy carbonation very nice texture rolling off the palate with each sip. Overall a likeable biere albeit a bit expensive at 9.99 a 750ml bottle. However, I'm glad I decided to revisit this French brewery not bad at all."
"This brewery is a survivor. They've been doing their thing - the French farmhouse thing - since 1885. Unlike a lot of Belgian ""abbey"" breweries, you can be assured that this artisanal French operation is the real thing. Although the true art of Bière de Garde is basically as lost as the music of the Aztecs, you still have a chance to try the distinctiveness of Europe's forgotten brewing country - buy a La Choulette product."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink; the spices keep it interesting but don't overpower the taste."
"O: A caramel candy sweetness reigns in this beer. I can't say I'm a huge fan, though others may like it. Personally, I wouldn't buy it again. But it's not a bad beer - I just tend to prefer drier ones."
"Even though this is a Christmas beer, I think this is a pretty textbook example of biere de garde. It adheres very close to style, with minor Christmas-spice accents. Recommended for fans of the style. Good by itself, but as usual, begs for a nice food pairing. It would easily fly with Christmas dinners of all stripes."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the French style ""Bière de garde"""
"Drinkability: Pretty high - the almost effervescent mouthfeel goes a long way here."
"D: Highly drinkable. An excellent example of style. I believe this is also a very accessible quality brew...bring it to a holiday party and watch the converts discover the true joy of beer."
"How about dessert? This would be great for dessert. The smell is very sweet, but the brew itself is not overly sweet. It has that malty dopplebock-like caramel backbone. It is very smooth and easy to drink, but not too watery."
"750ml bottle on sale for $10. I was not sure what to expect from this beer but I was a little surprised how much I enjoyed it. It was a dark amber color with a good head. The smell was spicy and dusty, not bad. The taste was spices, dust almost like a dark saison but also made me think of Christmas spices which could be the power of suggestion at work. Overall I thought this was a good beer but I would not revisit it. I will however purchase their framboise next."
"Note: This bottle has been cellared for over a year (improving). Also, note that this review was done while the beer was approx. 50 degrees F... and the aromas/flavors/mouthfeel change considerably as the beer warms."
"A very enjoyable beer. I will pick up more of this next time I see it. Something I would recommend."
"Drinkability- Under carbonated, fairly monotone and unmemorable."
"Poured into a tulip a nice golden dark copper color, some carbonation, tiny fizzy off-white head, some islands left behind. The nose is malty, slight yeast, figs, raisins, plums, and some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty/yeasty, with some dark fruits thrown in, and caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a different Biere de Garde in my book, tasty, but quite not the same. Very easy drinking brew."
"D - nice, approachable and I got it on a discount!"
"Overall I thought this was a fine noel and a really good choice for the evening. Sometimes the style can wear on me but I think this was done really well. I would defintly get this one again next year!"
"Drinkability: Bottled at 750 mL, it shoudl be shared. I would not suggest drinking more than a half bottle. Easy drinking without alcholic notes. A nice holiday beer without the heavy body."
"It seems to lack in richness and depth. Not nearly as impressed with this one as I was with other offerings from this brewery. And, pretty mediocre for both a biere de garde and a Christmas ale."
"Drinkability: a pleasant Christmas time beer that is enjoyed slowly. Worth giving this a try."
"Picked up a bottl e on sale as a whim. Opens nice, pretty good color- much like magic hat #9, very little head and no leg left on glass.Smells sweet and slightly citrus like. Taste is up front and lingers nicely. Would pair nicely with goose or duck. Probably would not buy again."
"Poured a rich crimson red color with an off white head that subsided to a thin ring of film around the edge of the glass. The aroma is sweet and malty almost like a scotch ale but much more estery. The taste is very smooth and creamy, it begins with the most unobtrusive malt sweetness that builds as the beer rolls over the tongue. The usual belgian high carbonation levels arent found in this one and it is a refreshing example. The mouthfeel is very nice yet i might revisit this beer later as i think i might have got a bottle the leaked gas through the cork as it just dosent seem carbonated enough. Very tasty and drinkable yet a little flat for a belgian."
"D: Although it's not one of the super-elite Belgian Christmas ales, it would be hard to argue that this one's not worth its cost. It's more of a mainstream ale than some, yet it's still full enough to keep you interested - and in a certain way, it's very much more drinkable. And as this is indeed a Christmas ale, I'd be more than willing to offer it to guests before, during, or after a holiday feast. Quite enjoyable!"
"Notes: Slight metallic twinge at the end of each pull was a distraction. The taste lays down on the palate for quite some time and its a bit cakey. Overall I'd say this is a below average offering and certainly not worthy of another purchase at its current price."
"The drinkability on this was pretty high, although it can be a bit cloying, but that depends how quickly you want to drink it. Letting mine open up was a good call, and had the evening provided more time, I could certainly have had another. Overall this was an enjoyable experience, although I should have known that with a Noel Biere de Garde, I was in for an unusual treat. The best buy date is in 2 days, although I assume it's an 06 brew b/c the year boxes are 6-9, so I'm surprised that they don't call for it to be aged. Apparently they already did the 'garding' and found the sweet spot!"
"A nice, pleasant beer but I'm not really thrilled by it. I was hoping for a little more from a Christmas beer. I would drink it again though. It's pretty good."
"Pours a deep cherrywood with a thin, frothy, light tanned head that doesn't stick around much before it becomes a thin layer of bubbles on top of the body. However, it leaves some lacing rings with each sip. Nose starts off with a whiff of vanilla, cherries, chocolate, molasses, and bread. The background alcohol in the smell gives this sort of a cordial quality. Flavors also offer a very similar profile with the vanilla, berries, dark malty flavors of bread, chocolate, and cane syrup. Finishes with herbal hops, mild bitterness, and a sticky sweetness. Reminds me of a doppelbock at times, but with a Franco-Belgian twist on it. Lingering aftertaste reminds me of those all-natural fruit roll-ups. Mouthfeel is rather full with a barely-there carbonation, which works rather well with the flavors. I really enjoy this, but its kind of a heavy one to drink a lot of."
"This offering pours a dark maroon leaving a thin tan head that leaves very quickly. The aroma is bready, tart unripened fruit, strawberries, cherries, sour dough bread, and a musty dank aroma. The taste is tart upfront, sour cherries, strawberries, lemon, leaving a syrupy mouthfeel that coats the palate. The hops are brisk but not astringent, malty fruitness really finishes this beer off but is balanced by a tart fruitness that really makes this beer great. Overall this is a nice beer, I haven't had it in a few years but glad I went back to it for this Christmas."
"Drinkability: Very pleasant but not particularly distinctive"
"I opened this winter offering after cellaring it for at least a year, maybe two. Not being familiar with the brewery (other than that it is in France, close to Belgium), I wasn't sure what to expect, but was quite pleased. The beer pours a medium dark color, slightly cloudy, with a small, white head. The aroma is very pleasant, with some sweet malt aroma along with yeasty plum esters. Flavor is sweet from both a nice malt composition and the spice/candy sugar flavors present. Vanilla and raisin come through strong. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a very small amount of alcohol warmth present, but perhaps a slight bit thin. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised with this winter beer from France. I'd definitely drink it again, though it would be interesting to see if it's as good without such a long conditioning time."
"White head piles up fairly well after a good pop of the cork, but fell rather quickly. Dark cherry color that turns to cherry sour red with a little light behind it. Strong yeasty smell in the nose with some malt, no hop. Nice malt base, a bit of alcohol, and overripe cherry, raisins. Strong bite in the taste that mellows nicely after several washings over the palate. Light roast flavor underneath the malt, giving it a strong body for the style. Overall, very pleasant. Bit pricey at $8.50 but worth it for a try."
"A very good drinking choulette, and one I would readily have again. Excellent with dinner. Palish biere de garde colour, heavenly spicy scent. Easy mouthfeel, understated carbonation and it;s in its prime, nine months before expirey. Slightly candy sweet that works nicely with the spices. Sour notes well under control."
"Biscuity bread quality with a huge nutty flavor that makes this taste like a brown, more than a Saison. Highly drinkable, as the 7% is completely masked, and quite tasty, though unlike any Saison I've ever had."
"A very worthwhile beer from La Choulette."
"This brew was the hands down favorite at our Christmas Eve beer tasting."
"Very drinkable. Alcohol almost a non-issue, and nothing to get sick of. Great with roasted poultry skin!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. The ale is smooth and balanced, neither hops or malt overwhelm. Worth a shot if you consider it to be a brown or red ale, and not a saison."
"I like the flavors, despite the fact that they are not what I expected. Next time I'm in the mood I'll spend the cash on something closer to style"
"One of the more drinkable Saisons i've had. Poured out to chestnut brown color with a small foamy head. Medium level of carbonation. Nice lacing. Aromas were light and fresh; crushed cashew nuts and malts, with some caramel and sweet molasses notes. Taste was rather enjoyable; honey, dark fruits, light malts and some nutmeg spice blended well. Mouthfeel was medium to light bodied and quite crisp, with a crystal clean finish. Decent drinkability; i'd have this again when in the mood for a saison. I may try some of the less seasonal offerings from Brasserie La Choulette, as this was suprisingly good. Recommended."
"A Saison? Quite dark and malty for the style, with less complexity and spiciness than others I've sampled. Consider this a Biere de Garde. Categories aside, I find this to be a bit on the lean side in both body and complexity, but it still has an interesting and pleasing flavor profile. I prefer La Choulettes Ambree to this offering, but it still serves as an excellent winter warmer."
"Pours very deep brown, not cloudy though. Nice head, very nice lacing. Smell is immediately extremely spiced. Finally, a beer with a lot of spice. Wintry mix of spices, including mint as well. Some sweet notes as well. Taste follows with a powerful spiced blend and nice sweet maltiness. Wonderful."
"I'll enjoy the rest of this bottle, but it's not going to set the woods on fire..."
"750 ml bottle, corked and bailed. Best before end 05 on label."
"Drinkability- I can't see saison in this beer. But, overall it was pretty tasty. If I see it again next winter I may pick up another."
"Overall, a REALLY intriguing beer. One that, if I could get it again, I would."
"The beer pours from the 75cl green wired and corked bottle a clear burnished copper color with the head minimal in size, the texture frothy and the color a very light tan, after its quick demise the lace forms a thin sheet upon the glass. Nose has an over ripe fruit aroma, plum like, sweet and refreshing, the start is sweet with the malt presence adequate; top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is strikingly acidic and the hops delectable in their spiciness, the aftertaste almost vinous, dry as a desert bleached bone, a fine drinking beer and one that hits the B spot, at least for me."
"$6.5 for a 750ml in MI (that's cheep!)."
"The syrup hues I've repeatedly mentioned are no so much indicative of a fullness of body as simply undercarbonated, and thus full of blunt, unopposed flavors. It's not overly thick, just simple of mind, and unfulfilling. And what presents itself doesn't merit any praise."
"Big pop to the cork. Attractive mostly clear dark chestnut color, luminous. Pale yellow head is composed of some bigger bubbles that break the head down in under 40 seconds. Laces in some strings and dots in the first glass, fuller in the second. Aroma is festive, nuts combined with apricots and darker figs. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is quite soft. Sweet malts dominate the flavor profile early, the nutiness from the smell is amplified along with a syrupy almost cherry sense. What gets a little out of hand is a hint of wood, almost sawdust -- ever suck on a tinkertoy when you were a kid? Dries a bit at the close, slight hop assertion, but continues to fill out in the aftertaste. A good-looking beer, but its color and flavors don't match a Saison, and the maltiness seems a little flawed to my tastes."
"Murky ruby-brown color with an off-white head that diminishes. The aroma is malty and herbal with a yeasty, kinda corky smell. The flavor is malty and phenolic with a cardboard, corky taste. Medium-light in body, semi-drying. Not what I was hoping for. I'd skip it next time."
"This is a clean brown/amber beer. Has a spoonable creamy beige head that leaves a good lace. The aroma is light and sweet with a hint of fruit/apple. The flavor starts with an inviting honey and molasses character. The finish is a nice easy alcohol warmth as it settles in."
"Cellared since last Christmas. Pours a clear copper color with a large beige colored head. Big malty nose, lightly fruity and yeasty smelling, but mostly malt and some kilned candi sugar notes. Initial sip threw me a curveball. I thought it might have a bit of tartness to it judging by the aroma, but there was none. Just sweet, malty and a hint of green apple. A bit minerally and a watery aftertaste. Carbonation is good. Pretty good for a darker biere de garde."
"This is OK for drinkability and it tastes nice, but nothing urging me to go back and get more."
"Upon reflection, the hyper sweet character that I have been sensing may in fact just be the aged character of this beer kicking in, it is not distracting, and perhaps adds a certain something to this beer."
"Overall: Brewed from Flanders and Hallertau Hops, as well as Pale and Special Malts, it sounds impressive but drinks like a run-of-the-mill sweet Brune. Not that special for a Xmas offering to be brutal, and certainly not worth he $7.99 I paid for it. Not bad, but dont waste your cash on this one, not unless its around the $3-4 mark for an (outdated) 75cl."
"750ml bottle. Pop the cork. A dark ruby red couloured brew with a large head of white/off-white foam. Aromas are of sweet belgian malts and candy sugar, as well as several kinds of fruits and hops. There are also some Flanders Red ale notes on the nose with some cherry-like aromas and some funky lambic-like tartness. The taste follows through with some lovely oud red flavors of cherries and some other sweet malt like flavors. The mouthfeel is nice and full and the drinkability is excellent. Nice."
"Ruby Brown color and a big huge that lasts for a while. Spicy, fruity aroma. Medium bodied, fruits and spices in taste, but also a metallic tinge. It is warming in the peppery finish. I liked this, but the metallic tinge I was getting was what I didn't like."
"I solid seasonal that I will put up again next year."
"Poured beautifully into my chimay chalice glass  rich thick head with excellent sweet smells emanating. The look was also enticing with a clear red/amber glow. The taste did not come through immediately when it was cold but become apparent once it warmed. Nice caramel and honey undertones with a pronounced malt profile. There was a definite alcohol warmth but at 7%ABV, it is missing that winter warmth. It also does not have any distinctive winter characteristics  it is too thin and no spices to speak of. This beer is crisp, clean with nice flavors but fails in the winter ale department and was kind of pricey at $9.50 at Berkeley bowl. I remember Trader Joes used to carry a French xmas beer and it was good but it was like 4 bucks. This beer has a best if drunk by date of 2004. Not the mark of excellence."
"A very drinkable seasonal in that it will warm you, but not knock you out. The beer pours a brilliant, and very, very clear, almost wine like deep blazing orange-like a glowing fire. Soft in the mouth and in the aroma, with mild chocolate,some banana like fruitiness, and creamy malted milk. A nutty, toasty flavor prevails on the tail end. A malt driven and really quite refreshing brew that is easy to drink and easy on the budget as well. This one came in at around six or seven bucks!"
