4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice bright golden amber color. Pretty clear, but I can see a lot of floaties in the bottle. Big off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Aroma is full of sweet pale grain flavor. Lots of fruit. Pears, apples, grapes, apricots, dates. Mild herbal, grassy hops. A faint medicinal note. Just tons of pilsner malt favor. Taste is similar. It starts sweet with that fresh, pale malt flavor but finishes dry with some funk and mild hop bitterness. More light fruitiness, big pear note particularly. Some musty apple/grape skin flavor and feel. Feel is light but full. There's some prickly carbonation but it's generally quite smooth due to the full body. Very easy to drink. Goes well with some soft goat cheese. Fun to find a nice example of the style.","popery","Feb 23, 2013"

An equally flowery yet subdued flavor, somewhat malty but not overly so, with a rounded swipe of pilsneresque hops at the very end. There's a bit of breadiness and grass in the glass as well. For a 7% beer this does not overpower or cause undue wobble, nor does it warm as it slithers its way down the gut. It's refreshing and delightful and I want another.","gfreed","Apr 29, 2010"

It certainly has plenty of pop from the cork and it pours a pale yellow with a nice white head, some retention, a loads of white lacing. It almost looks like sugar particles clinging to the sides fo the glass. The smell is green apple, citrus, maybe some honey aromas, and other faint smells of floral leaves. The smell is second to the taste, which is quite good. There is quite a complexity to this beer. There are perfumed scents, tart apples, citrus, floral spices such as lavender, and grassy notes as well. This is a very refreshing, pleasing, relatively light beer, well worth seeking out. There is a moderate degree of carbonation, the finish is somewhat tart, and the mouthfeel is light and refreshing. The aftertaste is quite mild for a beer with a 7% ABV. The warming alcohol throatiness does pop through as the beer warms and settles, but the ABV is well hidden behind a melange of complexity. L'Chaim.","albern","Nov 06, 2007"

A very versatile beer. I'm relatively new to this genre and these & Saisons are growing on me in their simplistic complexity.

The most dominant aspect is that earthiness. On the palate, candied ginger and hops first off, then some sweetness at the mid-palate that vanishes in a flash toward a medium-length, slightly hoppy dry finish. Everything here is fabulously balanced -- there's citrus and herbs and malts and earth, but nothing overpowers anything else. The mouthfeel is fairly big, owing to some robust carbonation -- it's more gourmet and delectable than it would be thirst-quenching.

The taste starts out pretty mild with some malt and yeast flavors but livens up towards the sour/tart finish which shows some of the spices.

Almost a creamy, buttery mouthfeel. A touch of toast. Lots of flavorful honey characteristics and a touch sweet. Earthy but not too raw. A bit nutty. More of a subtle earthy, yeasty phenolic flavor. Fruity flavors are there but I can't put my finger on which fruit. More citric and some hoppiness in the finish. Drying. Light acidity finishes it off with only a touch of honey.

Refreshing malty sweetness, floral bouquet, and a touch of oak in the nose serve justice. The mouthfeel is fantastic; wonderfully smooth and brisk, leading to an entirely quenching brew. A lightly malted front is met with soft floral hop notes that is undeniably satisfying. The whole beer in itself almost takes on a creamy and feathery feeling as it does the walz on your palate. The finish is impeccably balanced and ultimately ends up leaving behind the sweet maltiness that was imparted in the mouthfeel. Good care and quality.","Hhawk06","Dec 24, 2005"

My first french blond ale so I'm not familiar with all of the characteristics of the style. Poured with a nice 1" or so head with large loose bubbles. Crystal clear, light golden color. Can't come up with any good descriptors for the smell other than it smells like it tastes. Light caramel sweetness and a grassy, fruity, floral bouquet. Nice, light mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Worth a try if you like the style.","ILhophead","Oct 11, 2005"

4.7,16.6,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"My first Biere de Garde. Poured out to a hazy golden color with a nice foamy head and minor lacing in the glass. High carbonation. Smell was very pleasing and similar to a belgian ale such as Duvel; aromas of malt, earth, yeast and mild spice filled the nose well. An excellant start. Taste was very palatable and complex, yet not overbearing. Flavors of malt, grain, mild hops, yeast, and a dry sweetness blend wonderfully. Mouthfeel is fantastic; carbonation excites the tastebuds and the flavor gives them something to be happy about. High level of drinkability, I'm sure I will be seeing more of this in the cellar, as well as more of this style. Highly Recommended.","Frozensoul327","Sep 14, 2005"
4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"D-This beer is very light and crisp and has a nice sweetness to it that is very faint. The malt and hops have good depth for as light as they are. Very pleasant to drink and the subtle taste makes me want to take another sip.","rhoadsrage","Aug 04, 2005"

3.9,-3.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Cork popped out of 750ml very gently and remained in my fingers. Pours a little darker gold in color than other biere de garde's that I've had. Very high carbonation with whole hand's worth of head that dissipates into a pillowy 2 finger head that remains minutes after the initial pour. Aroma is sour. Some aroma of grass and earthy smells. First sip reveals a very grassy flavor with a slight tang to it. It seems like it would pair very well with goat cheese. Very smooth mouthfeel and goes down very easily for a 7.0% ABV.","mjohn27603","Apr 13, 2005"

I'm new to the style so please forgive me in my review. Sweet in the nose, with some spicy hops. Very complex; I can't begin to do all the flavours justice. All I know is I could smell this beer all evening and be happy. Spices (I get some coriander) with malts in the taste and a gentle hint of lemony gueuze-like sourness. Lovely and complex. Still can't get over the nose. Mouthfeel is nice. Wow, this is a nice beer. If the rest of the exampls of of biere de gardes are like this, I might have found my new favourite style.","foamer","Feb 16, 2005"
4.15,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured a light golden color and formed a thin foam ring about the glass. It looked like sparkling apple cider, but had a slight haze to it too. The smell was of wheat, malt and light fruit. The taste is wonderful and reminded me of candy. It was cidery and elicited an apricot flavor as well. The mouthfeel was light, but not watery, very balanced. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and would definitely buy another bottle!","tomthumbsblues","Jan 20, 2005"
4.27,6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Taste is fruity and lightly sour. A nice spicy finish, peppery. Sweet with hints of alcohol showing through but drys out in the finish a bit.

I'll have another...","ViveLaChouffe","Jan 20, 2005"
4.15,3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Flower petal intrigue and mild bitterness are highlights of the flavor. A smooth, thick, bready texture and one-dimensional honey/malt flavor makes this good but not at all excellent. I wonder if it's trying too hard to seem natural.

4.1,1.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"An appropriate beer to be consumed on this fine Labor Day. Nice depiction of a scene from the French revolution, which was due to an uprising of the laboring class, on the label. 75 cl cork and caged bottle pours a golden pils color with some bronze hightlights and a big off-white head that doesn't necessarily last, but leaves good lacing. Some honey-like and hay-like pilsener malt tones, light yeast fruitiness, and subdued low-alpha hop notes. Tastes light and crisp, soft water notes like water drawn from a well, pear-like fruitiness from the yeast, and sweet in its malt, but maintaining a simple overall feel with a small undercurrent of subtle spicings, which gives it a complexity and depth. Quite enjoyable in the fact that it's very drinkable and pretty simple, overall. Feels like it's less than 7%. I've had this before and I'd purchase it again. This beer's proof that the French are no slouchers when it comes to brewing some artisanal beers.","crookedhalo","May 13, 2004"
4.05,0.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: A very nice beer, easy drinking, flavorful, but, perhaps, a bit lethargic. I would very much drink one of these again, but I'd seek out something more interesting after the 2nd one in a row.","Afterburner","Apr 29, 2004"

Overall though, the aromas are quite light. Mmm, this beer is much tastier than the faint aroma would suggest. The beer is lightly sweet and it has a medium full body, which is a nice surprise. The taste is redolent with lemon, green apple, bergamot, grain, and a tannic bite. There is a bit of bitterness in the finish, which is followed by an astringency and some tingling acidity. A nice bit of toasted biscuit and toasted malt flavors come through as this beer opens up. This beer is definitely quite malty.","Gueuzedude","Mar 15, 2004"
3.83,-5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"750ml thanks to MartinT. The appearance is a nice clear shining gold. White head, well-laced, but pretty thin. Aroma is spicy, something along the lines of chive, very dry and farmy, almost closing to a wheat field in that respect. Slight floral and yeast notes complement the nose, but overall, it seems a bit harsh in its dryness, like a farm in summer that didn't receive enough water during spring. Palate is also very dry, not unlike a white wine, grapey with notes of orange, grapefruit, bread and lemon. Subtle hay and tartness come and go leaving a pleasant yeasty/spicy finish.","Rastacouere","Jan 18, 2004"
4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Sans Culottes is great with a meal or by itself. Its rocky head accents its wonderful golden color. The aroma is fruity and complex.

4.42,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"No, it is significantly different, all my jokes aside, it is smoother, fruitier, without the lemony/orange citric taste, very mellow, easy-drinking, a perfect choice for dinner, picnics, celebrations, patting yourself on the back, whatever it takes. Very well-rounded, the malt meets the hops almost perfectly, and the flavor remains king. Mmm, tasty, and this is so amiable and perfectly integrated, that, were it more affordable and readily reachable, I'd take it on more often as an everyday brew. Just loosen the belt, lose the fancypants and go "sans culottes", I says...","feloniousmonk","Sep 24, 2003"

4.65,15.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"As another reviewer noted, a "French Masterpiece" The beer pours a brilliant Golden with awesome purity and clarity of color. I can't help get the image of a beautiful "French Blonde" out of my head as I ruminate over this fine specimen-lovely creamy white head and sticky lace that clings to the side of the glass and does not move. Aromatically, this beer screams out of the gate. I could smell the warming, malty richness even as it was being poured. The beer exhibits as well an earthiness that some may call barnyardy, yet the French may call, terroir. Though the aromas may be that which I have smelled inside a French Barn-some weathered wood aromas come to mind-I personally don't find the smell of a French Barn to be negative. In fact, it is this very rusticity that I love about, not only French beer, but the wines as well. To each his own. The mouthfell on this beer is that of butter. Creamy and rich this beer melts on the palate. The carbonation is very fine and acts as yet another catalyst in the creation of this voluptuous French blonde. Once past the awe of this beers silken texture, the flavors kick in. Rich maltiness adds a robust quality to the beer and a pretty sweetness. A very slight, yet ever present bitterness keeps things in check balance wise. Still more butter on the palate in the way of perhaps butterscotch? Warming alcohol comes off more soothing than hot and is integral to the beers character. A beer you'll love to curl up with and enjoy very, very, very slowly-this is one tasty French Blonde! SANTE!","moulefrite","Jun 12, 2003"
4.57,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This beer totally and utterly agreed with with me. Very nice floral subtly oaky aroma, very nice tastewise. Very subtle and elegant, with a tremendously satisfying bitter finish, very savoury, a very juicy little brew (grape-like as VENOM says), totally awesome. We get the Choulette Ambree down under, but not this, i'm sure the importers could get this if they wanted to. I'll just have to wait till i get to europe to try it again until they do.","rastaman","Mar 02, 2003"
4.35,7.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"Golden blonde in hue, topped by a fluffy, thick rocky head. Brilliant clarity. Rough, frothy lace remains. Combination of a sweetly floral and chlorophyll - laden, fresh cut grass like hop nose is dominant in aroma. Undertones of yeast must and black licorice along with trace clove add, herbal rustic depth. Becomes progressively more peppery and phenolic as the volatile hop oils evaporate, but retains a purposeful, understated elegance. Softly spoken, yet enticing aromawise. Mellow, lightly perfumed, Blossom - esque honey sweetness upfront in flavor is quickly complemented by mild yeast and base pilsner malt derived breadiness. Subtle phenols emerge mid palate accompanied by light, pearish esters, only to be superceded by a firm, but judicious light caramel malt presence that serves to both extend malt sweetness and counteract the high apparant attenuation by contributing dextrins. Agreeably smooth, innocuous and soft in mouthfeel. Non descript, but well calculated hop bitterness offsets residual sweetness well and provides a cleansing dryness. Finishes mostly clean, with notes of sweet cracker and hints of lightly citric lemongrass. San Culottes is a dangerously delightful and soft brew. It's as light on the palate as a fine Helles but adds the subtle spice and fruit of a Belgian pale. A nearly quintessential Biere de Garde, that's only a hair shy in malt character. Very enjoyable.","marc77","Nov 09, 2002"
4.2,4.2,4,4,4,4,5,"Hazy looking straw color. A dense off-white head recedes to a collar and a few islands. The aroma is musty and fruity with a spattering of grapes. The fruitiness on the nose is very muted on the tongue. Instead, there is substantial must, a little leather, tinges of alcohol and some evidence of lime juice. This is a unique beverage. Some very slight sourness and tartness. A little bit of a dry finish. Body is light to medium and mouthfeel is effervescent. Nice little farmhouse ale. Very drinkable.","Bighuge","Jul 01, 2002"

4.02,-0.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Upcharging and pretty clear deep yellow color, hazy and sparkly head.  Sharp and winey aroma, with a sense of yeasty and woodsy mustiness.  Flavor is full but not piquant, more like elements of malty sweetness and oak barrel flavor with some unfermented grape.  Reasonably full-bodied, nice in the swallow with aftertaste of muskiness.  Enough hops to make it balanced for style (I guess, this style is pretty new to me).  Pretty enjoyable...","ADR","0"
