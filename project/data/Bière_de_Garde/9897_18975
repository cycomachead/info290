Taste starts with sour punch shifting into grapefruit and wood. Slight pucker at finish. Very little alcohol detection for an 8% beer. Mouthfeel is light, but with mild carbonation. Very easy drinking--I'm definitely going to pick this one up again.","AppaZappa","Mar 24, 2015"

Pours a bright honey-gold hue with a translucent clarity, a rocky two inch, bright white head and copious tiny bubbles present effervescing in solution from the base of the glass to the underside of the cap.  Head eventually settles into a 1/4 inch lid with beautiful spots and swaths of textured lacing coating the walls of the glass.  Interesting note - buttery oak notes, a spicy/peppery quality and  wet grass.  Taste follows nose with the addition of an herbal/medicinal quality as well as a slight sour mash quality towards the back.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a bright carbonation and a pleasant acidity.    Overall - a wonderful beer.  Very appealing to look at in the glass and the oak in the nose is quite wonderful.  I'm generally not a biere de garde fan but I found this quite enjoyable.","Jwale73","Jan 03, 2015"

4.3,4.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/31/2013. Pours lightly hazy deep golden color with a 3 finger dense and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart lemon peel, orange zest, apricot, pear, green apple, white pepper, clove, wheat, cracker, bread, hay, straw, grass, wet wood, musty funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, pale malt, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of tart lemon peel, orange zest, apricot, pear, green apple, white pepper, clove, wheat, cracker, bread, hay, straw grass, wet wood, musty funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy spiciness and light tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon peel, orange zest, apricot, pear, green apple, white pepper, clove, wheat, cracker, bread, hay, straw, grass, wet wood, musty funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding Biere de Garde style. All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 26, 2014"

Certainly good, and always worth trying, but I would seek out other Jolly Pumpkin brews first if you are having trouble choosing.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 20, 2014"

4.25,3.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a good example of a Biere De Garde and it was another good example of a funky Jolly pumpkin beer, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style along with some nice balance. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, not too acidic, a little refreshing, not filling at all and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think two of these would be a good amount for me and I could see myself having a couple while sitting on the porch on a warm summers day. What I like the most about this beer was balance, no aspect was too overpowering and the flavors and aromas blended well with each other. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, it's good just the way it is, but I do wish it was just a little cheaper. I would buy this beer again and I think I'll be keeping a couple bottles in the fridge for this summer. I would recommend this beer especially if you like like a nice lightly funky Biere De Garde. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and I thought that nice bright lemon aspect was a little impressive. It's up there as one of the better Biere De Garde's I've had and I think it might just be my favorite of the three year round Jolly pumpkin beers that made it into 350ml bottles, but it's pretty hard to choose between this one and La Roja. Good job guys, I really enjoyed this beer, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","Jun 11, 2014"

4.22,2.4,4.25,4,4.5,4,4,"Oro De Calabaza has a hazy, yellow-orange appearance, topped with a thin layer of pure white. It's got a zesty aroma, reminiscent of orange rind, pepper, cloves, and vinegar. An array of candied flavors fills the mouth upon the first taste, like taffy, jolly ranchers, and sweet melon, as well as other aspects that include dark grapes and Cabernet. Excellent. There's moderate acidity present here, and it finishes with a pleasant numbing of the palate. I only felt the slight sense that this was a relatively high ABV beer. Overall, this is an almost surprisingly good example of the Biere De Garde style from an American brewery. If you're relatively new to this type, like myself, this is a good starting point.","Neorebel","Oct 12, 2013"

The first thing that hit my palette was the sour, not mouth puckering, but not terribly weak either. Next the waves of Brett, some hay,funk and that signature fruity-turned-funk goodness. Coronation is pretty nice, small tight bubbles roll over the mouth, but the lacing is minimal. The overall package is well done, not as sour as some of the JP offerings with a more pronounced Brett character, really well done and a great stepping stone beer for newbies in the realm of your/wild brews.","ChadChaney","Jan 25, 2013"

Smells yeasty with a smattering of light fruits (orange, pear, lemon, green apple). A slight aroma of funk and dry hay lies deep within. Tastes tangy up front with a following of sugary sweetness. Obviously fruity as with the smell. Has a touch of brett, spice, and just the right amount of sour fruit and hoppiness to bring things full circle. Light to medium in body, and has that distinctive Jolly Pumpkin crispness. My favorite JP brew so far.","stephens101","Apr 30, 2012"

Aroma is really grapefriut and lemon rindey with a bit of funk, but not a ton. Big pungent aroma, not at all subtle. Flavor has a bit of soft sourness along with a lot of funk and nice green apple, citrus rind and some champagne fruityness.

You get slightly sweet citrus fruits, almost some pineapple, lemon, a lactic sour, and some funk. The flavors are nice as well. It's very light and features a light pineapple along with lemonzest, grass, hay, and a bretty and dry funk. Nice, although somewhat simple flavor. It's light and very drinkable. This is a pretty approachable sour and a poor man's Temptation, minus the chardonnay barrel. I like it. This is a nice beer from a brewery that specializes in sours.

Taste was very light, grassy, touches of apple skin, lemon zest and white wine, pale malts, yeast, and light spice; no element was really dominant. My wife claims that it had a subtle resemblance to a soft drink from Dominica called "Quenchi," but I wouldn't know.

3.96,-3.9,3,4.5,4,3,4,"Oro de Calabaza pours a mildly hazy lemon yellow. There's maybe two fingers of head, and the foam shows a little bit of retention, but next to no lacing. The nose is an excellent blend of a classic biere de garde and a wild ale. There's some honey and bready malt sweetness dueling with straight up funk for the role of primary aroma. A light clove spiciness stays firmly planted in the background. The flavor doesn't quite live up that. Most of what was found in the aroma is still here, but the deeper, bready malt notes are a bit lost here, and the honey that's left behind isn't sturdy enough to balance the beer. The funk and slightly peppery phenols still play to good effect though. There's just something off about the mouthfeel though. The body is a little thinner than the typical biere de garde, which I suppose is to be expected given the different wild yeast/bacteria at work. The carbonation though just falls totally dull and lifeless by mid sip. I'd like to come back to another bottle of Oro de Calabaza that has a bit more age on it, though I liked it fresh I think I'd probably enjoy it more after giving the critters some more time to work their magic.","axeman9182","Oct 06, 2011"

This beer needs to breathe. At first it was nothing but tart. And somewhat disappointly one dimensional sour beer. But as it sat... And we had it with food too... Soprasoda, an english blue cheese and duck pate... The beer has that beer de garde undertone that was so interesting in the face of the sour. Hints of twig and spice and a noble hop grassy floral note. It complimented the meaty salty with a sour salty and hay earthy hint. Well stored and perfect after 9 months in the bottle. Interest take and accurate to the style just initially sour dominated. Better as it warms. Quality greatly increases if with food.","rtepiak","Aug 27, 2011"

In the taste, apple cider vinegar, but not sweet, there is a moderate bitterness that has to be some hop character peeking through. Nice sour, almost puckering, quite funky.

Abundant scoops of foam & lacing rings on sides. Green apples, subtle malt, musty wood & resin on nose. Esters are well hidden but sour acid fruit flavor remains on palate, undernotes of spices too. Wild yeast tartar mouthfeel & aftertaste. Mildy resinous hoppy & woody finish. Medium body, high but gentle carbonation. Excelent & refreshing drinkability - a good alternative for Gueuze lovers when a paused drink in cold weather is required. Alcohol is not felt. Perfect representative of the Style, the only objection might be a little unbalanced flavor.","GONZALOYANNA","0"
4.03,-2.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A very opaque brightly golden yellow beer with a dense thick head and just a bit of belgian lace. Farmy, dusty and slightly flowery. More brett and funk then barrel. There is that signature JP aroma. Some interesting belgian yeast quality, a little lemon and pepper. Clean crisp malt and high notes at first followed quickly by brett-y horse blanket and damp hay. Some spice and delicate flavors. A somehow fuller mouthfeel presents itself. On the finish there is a lingering sourness, not all that clean.

Nose features a big hit of de funk, some nuanced oakiness, not overpowering, tart dry aroma, some coriander and lemony esters, lemon became more pronounced as it warmed. Taste is fairly fruity, may be attributable in part to the oak, lemony nose, taste like they used Dupont yeast in this, a very complex flavor profile IMHO. Not sure this is a first use oak barrel, nice subtle oakiness, more saisony than Bier de Garde due to yeast. Medium light mouthfeel, lip smacking tartness, dry attenuated finish. More tart than sour, alcohol is fairly noticeable. Thanks Maltmaster 420 for doing the legwork and bringing this to Oregon.

There is definitely a sour smell to this ale, along with a bit of barnyard funk. Also picking up some lemons with a bit of zest and spices. Very nice smell to this. Very interesting taste as well. Never had anything like this before. Initially, I get a sour taste along with some herbs and spices (pepper, oregano, mint, etc...). Then I get some very strong woody notes, followed by lemon and maybe a bit of orange. Kinda a bit of alcohol taste at the end. The sourness is not overpowering at all, in fact, it makes this beer better. I just haven't had a Biere de Garde this sour before. Then again, I haven't had very many of that style. The taste seems to get better as it warms up. The mouthfeel is very nice. Not too light, and very crisp and refreshing (still full-bodied).

A first taste reveals slight banana/citrus/clove notes with hearty wheat presence. The back end provides a slightly oaky finish that mingles with the rest of the pallet but doesn't take over. It cold be easy to overpower this style of beer with too much cask and not enough good old beer flavor. Luckily the blend is perfect, the flavors meld together complimenting not fighting for superiority. The flavors are more subdued and reminiscent of themselves vs a strong separate character.

Very spicy both at the front and the end - the oak in the front and the high ABV lending notes of pepper to the end. In between the beer is very sweet, with a very large mouthfeel provided by the heavy Belgian yeast. The finish lingers, reminding me of Sweet Tarts, which I haven't had since I was a kid.

Musty brett notes again, with hops giving it a slightly bitter, very dry finish. The alcohol is noticeable in the background, though barely save for the warming finish.

Aroma has some lemon, orange peel, white pepper, and dry brute champaign. Taste is full on with the sharp acidic flavors of lemon, grass, grapefruit, yeasty notes, and quite a bit of wild funk. Body is light, sharp, acidic and carbonated nicely. Drinking this bottle was not a chore at all, as there was a nice balance of sweet, sour and dry overall.

It's a bit pricey ($10.49 for a 750ml at Liquor Mart on Colorado Blvd) so I won't be buying a ton, but I'll definitely pick up some more in the future.

Citrus is one of the more noticeable flavor profiles. Also it reminds me of white grape peels. While this beer has pronounced flavors in the front and tail of the taste, the middle was pretty watery.

Taste is initially sour, but quickly transitions into spices, malts, apples, and some hops. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side and the beer is well carbonated.

4.03,-2.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a pale, bright golden color, with a big, high-carbonation-powered white head that leaves lots of lace and lasting pillow of foam on top of the beer. The nose has a mixed sour smell, with some of the funkiness of brett along side some sweeter wild yeast smells. In addition to the yeast, there's a substantial Belgian pale malt presence and hop-and-black pepper combo. On the palate, initially funky, followed by a sweeter middle in which those pale malts and some fruity Belgian yeast esters come to the fore. There's a pear element to the fruitiness. Toward the end, things get drier and more sour, with a slightly puckering feel. The finish is sharply acidic, which comes out of nowhere for this relatively soft sour beer. Mouthfeel is brisk with both acidity and some stony carbonation. Overall, this is very interesting, tasty and complex beer. The sourness is well-integrated with the Belgian golden ale aspects of the beer, so things are interesting while remaining tasty and drinkable.","geexploitation","Beers"

The feel is quite light almost watery, it is well carbonated, and you can notice the 8% ABV in the end. Finishes on the tart side.

Aroma is a soothing mix of tart yogurt and barrel aged apple cider with an air of fruitiness and herbal hops thrown into the mix as well. Definitely spiced with another aspect of band aids coming in as well and this particular Oro is from a green bottle that's a first and this is like at least the fourth time I've tasted it batch # 223. Peppery pineapple and other passion fruits blend nicely as well especially as it warms. Flavor wise very dry with tart apples and pineapple and a strong assertive spice ridden peppery note that rides throughout, tart lactic notes throughout really thick in this one. Again finish is dry like plain Mediterranean yogurt and green apple cider kinda intense. Mouthfeel is effervescent and body here is medium to light in range, overall enjoyable again the dryness is overwhelming and the acidity would sting if you had any open sores on your gums kinda like that orange juice burn. Drinkability is actually much better than my description impairs and again it's great with food for the peppery, spicy, citrus, and dry palate cleansing qualities.

Cheese wise, I see this as more akin to lambic pairings, with tart goat cheeses (a tomme perhaps) being apt, certainly not nutty parm. Indian makes an interesting mix, provied its a mild curry using coconut or cream in its base- the acidity would help. I'd see this better paired with thai sweet/milder coconut curries.

Carbonation can be seen racing to surface, very intimidating. The aroma is really amazing: spices are very predominant (not sure if added, or ferm. byproduct), with a solid cinnamon and nutmeg character along with some clove. In addition there is a tart, sour cherry note with some bright citrus overtaking the bulk of the boquet. On the palate, a wheaty, lightly toasted malt fills the mouth. Some other slightly medicinal and astringent flavors come through providing the requisite "funk". Hops are very muted. Mouthfeel is where this beer both shines and fails. It is perhaps one of the most carbonated beers I've had in recent memory, to its dissadvantage. But, it was incredibly smooth and creamy helping the drinkability.

4.35,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"If anything, this is a very, very complex beer with quite a bit going on. The beer pours a cloudy, hazy, orange-gold color, with a thick, frothy head and lots of lacing and retention. The smell. Wow, the smell is vinous, yeasty, lemon zest, and clove. There is a very obvious oakiness to the beer and you can smell the wood age in the yeast and malt. There is a slight medicinal quality and perhaps a little mustiness in the smell as well. The aroma is certainly an indication of even more complexity on the way. This is a light to medium bodied, fairly well carbonated beer with enough haze to indicate bottle conditioning. There is not the typical sediment or yeasty bits floating about. The taste when the beer is chilled is strongly tilted towards the floral bouquet, spices, lemon zest, mustiness, and wild yeast all over the palate. The oaky vinous qualities are more pronounced when the beer is chilled. When the beer gets a chance to settle, you will get more apple, spiced fruits, perhaps some hints of coriander, clove, rind, and some pepperish bite. There is an undefined taste that others may be referring to as funk. I guess I'll use that one as well. The "funk" remains pretty constant from the first pour to the last. The beer is overwhelmingly yeasty, and the yeast does dance all over the rainbow of other tastes and flavors of this beer. There is just so much going on with this beer it truly is an experience. Trying to pin down specific tastes is difficult, things blend, dissipate, reappear, and re-blend. This is an exceptionally complex beer well worth seeking out.

Smell is slightly sour scent of cloves, lemongrass, pepper, sour apples, and a hint of yeast. A tiny hint of vanilla goodness from the oak aging in the nose as well. Taste starts off with a bit honey sweetness with a blend of mandarine oranges. Towards the end a bready yeast flavor emerges and continues into the aftertaste with a hint of spicey pepper. Other than those flavors, it seems a bit empty and watered down in terms of taste. Mouthfeel is light and fluffy with a bit overpowering carbonation.

The taste is all top of the mouth to begin with - spicy, hoppy, citrus rind, sour fruit ... all nicely balanced with a refreshing effervescence that is never too overpowering. Gentle sour fruit lingering aftertaste, The 8 per cent alcohol is hardly apparent. Overall a full, rich, complex and satisfying beer that gets close to top marks in my book.

On the palate this beer is quite rich and sweet, with flavors of honey, pineapple juice and some citrus. The hops kick in a bit on the finish, giving this beer a slight dry/peppery flavor, which keeps the beer from becoming cloying.

As with other Jolly Pumpkins I've had, alcohol is not present in either the aroma or flavor. Lighter in body with a lot of carbonation. Pretty drinkable for the ABV and flavor combination.

The aroma has a gueuze-like funk with notes of clover honey, pear, wet wood, sand and old pennies. Some hops make their presence known, but subtly. Flavor starts with some fruity malt sweetness (like asian pear), then the brett kicks in, resulting in a drier, mildy sour finish with a faint grassy aftertaste. Metallic twang from the higher carbonation level, but not offly so. The mouthfel fares well with the carbonation and leaves it bubbly and prickly all the way through the swallow. A very nice bière de garde that has a significant Belgium/French border feel to it. I only wish it was as "spicy and peppery" as the label claimed. Regardless, a very nice ale.","crookedhalo","May 30, 2007"

Very sour with a decent amount of citrus fruit. I thought the aroma was actually more peppery than the taste. Once you get used to the funkiness, its a nice smooth sipper. Carbonation is about right.

Smells is tart, slightly sweet and sour, apple, pear esters, slight white grape quality, maybe some white pepper, (nice nose). Taste is crisp not very malty, the carbonation and hops keep it active though, and there is how ever just enough sweetness to get you through. I definitely like the slightly tart acidic flavor this manifests defienty a possible good food beer. The sourness reminds me of a slightly young apple, the idea of a tiny amount of wide yeast makes this makes so much more sense.

Wheat malt, light sweetness (powdered sugar) and fresh hay come through mid-palate. Tart, refreshing acidity stays throughout, although the finish becomes warmer and sweeter, showing more complexity.

4.18,1.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Bought at Beumont Market in Portland, OR. No date, poured in a goblet. Big foamy white head atop a deep golden ale. Smells sweet like orange popsicles. Tart snappy bite and more orange popsicle taste. Hops are there too. Dry finish of well water and orange essence and honey water. Mouthfeel is a tad bit thick but soft carbonation lingers for the 45 minutes I swirled it. The head lingered too, and even laced the glass. Very interesting beer and worth seeking out more from this brewery.","rayjay","Sep 09, 2006"

Well, put a keg tap into a bag of Brachs' spicy gum drops with some fine festering yeast and spring water and here's what you have: a tart beer gumdrop. A peppery confection that froths with an infected head. I mean this in a good way. Like when a rich pumpkin pie and whipped cream begin to swirl and meld together from a thorough forking.

Aroma of pepper is surprisingly quite dominating with some sourness (brett) and some traces of oak. Taste is real interesting mix between sourness, sweet malt some pepper and other spices though not as much as the aroma was suggesting. Carbonation was a tad too excessive and body was above average. Another impressive effort from this fine brewery.","Phyl21ca","Jul 06, 2006"

The fine brew poured a cloudy white head with a robust, fluffy white head that lasted for awhile. The aroma I get is of a sour funkiness, a bit earthy and a bit soapy. The taste was a very enjoyable fruity and sour mix that was perfect on a hot summer day. The body is medium with some good creamy texture and a solid carbonation body.

Nose is quite aromatic - peppery spice, citrus oil, wild funky yeast and a robust sourness. Taste follows the nose - sharp and peppery, misty citrus, with a dry, funky barnyard yeasty sourness. My girlfriend aptly pointed out its resemblance to a sparkling dry white wine. Mouthfeel is crisp, tart, and dry. Only my second biere de garde, so I'm still a novice in the style. This reminded me of a much more drinkable version of the oude gueuze that I was not able to finish. At 8%, the alcohol creeps up on you, but is well hidden within the funk.

It pours a very deep gold but very foggy with a massive white head that has a golden tint. Smells very hoppy with many citrus and yeasty tones. Tastes mostly citrus to begin with hints of alcohal and sour notes. Leaves a dry misty taste with citrus overtones. This beer is very carbonated and yet refreshing, a decent mouthfeel, but nothing that was unexpected. Not a beer that I could drink many of in one sitting, too much carbonation and very overpowering after one glass.

When I opened the bottle and let it sit for a minute, it bubbled out the top of the bottle! The bubbles in the head are massive as well! Aroma of citrus and a hint of sourness, which is also what I get from the taste. Immensely drinkable, dangerous at 8%. You certainly cannot tell from the taste. An excellent bier de garde from Michigan!","rrwiltse","Apr 04, 2006"
4.12,0,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Bright golden ochre color, hazed but translucent. Very charged bottle, big snow white head of medium bubbles and a mousse-like consistency. Laces in broad looping rings. A good aroma, tart with elements of sweet raisins and a mild yeast background. Mouthfeel is almost medium, but there's a lot of embedded pin-prick carbonation. Crisp flavor with Northern Spy Apples and bright white pepper. Malt is decent, slightly honeyish but by-in-large muted by the initial astringency and a lot of carbonation (the CO2 will make you belch on this brew). Unsweetened lemon finish. The aroma works well with this beer, in some ways it has that sharp snap that approximates one end of a spectrum that other North American examples leave blank, the latter often being thicker and maltier.","ADR","Mar 26, 2006"

The tangy tart leave lambic aftertaste, but up front there is a spicy-grassy, honey hopped flavor.

Taste is highly unique and complex; flavors of malt, spice, light pine and oak, grain and citrus blend in very nice harmony as the carbonation keeps the nuances of earth and bitterness present toward the finish.

It's just too much. A fine tasting beer but the bubbles get in the way. For the price, I won't buy it again. I paid $7 for a 750ml bottle. Stone IPA is much better and way cheaper.

3.83,-7,4.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Very cloudy golden orange body. Plenty of white foamy head covering the glass in sheets of lacing. Big yeasty aroma with a backing from various spices. Light citrus fruit notes and a bit of biscuit. Flavor starts with some pears, apples and a bit of lemon before the doughy malt sets in. Light funky notes are there. Yeast and spices take over on the finish. Mouthfeel was way too carbonated to enjoy at first after letting it sit for a bit it was less so. Drinkability was hurt a bit by the over carbonation but otherwise was good. Solid example of the style that I would have again.","meathookjones","Jun 29, 2005"

This is a described "golden ale" and pours a straw-yellow with a light haze. It had a full head on pouring and maintained a thin head and produced nice lace all the way down. The nose gives uo notes of citrus, flowery herb and some spice. One may taste all of these notes as well. Average to Good mouthfeel.","maybrick","Apr 18, 2005"
4,-2.9,4,4,4,4,4,"This one pours a nice hazy gold with a nice fluffy head that hangs around for a long time. It smells citrusy and spicy. There is definately coriander in this brew. The taste follows the nose. There is a nice citrus flavor with the light spiciness of the coriander. Nice malt sweetness. Good mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. Very drinkable. I highly recommend this one.","Brian700","Apr 14, 2005"

4.32,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This shares many of the characteristics of the Luciernaga and the La Roja, but for some reason it just seems to work quite a bit better in this beer. This beer is quite well integrated between the up front apple and lemon character, the soft spiciness and the barrel funk. There is a certain sharpness in the finish which seems to have notes of higher alcohols, tannic woodiness, and hot estery alcohols. None of the sharpness in the finish is overwhelming, in fact it adds sort of a balancing note to the soft creamy fruitiness. While this beer does not wow me quite like the Calabaza Blanca, it is incredibly well balanced and certainly tasty to boot.","Gueuzedude","Jan 29, 2005"
4.1,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Received as part of a trade from CRJMellor, the 750 ml brown bomber was handsome, with a colorful artistic label. When poured into a tulip, the body was golden orange and cloudy, and was capped with a decent sized head leaving sticky spotty lace. The smell was semi tropical in the vein of bananas, apricots, peaches, and fresh tilled earth. The taste was rustic and earthy with peppery spiciness blending nicely with the malt that tasted like buttered French bread. There were also delicate lemony sour notes imparted by the yeast. The mouthfeel was creamy and full, with a dry hoppy and woody aftertaste. Well crafted domestic beer that clearly highlights the old world origins of the style.","rajendra82","Jan 24, 2005"

4.3,4.4,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Solid example of an under-represented style (at least in Michigan). Pours a cloudy straw color, decent head given the ABV. Nice lacing on the glass. Slightly spicy aroma, some phenolics are present. I pick up abit of orange on the aroma as well. Taste start spicy and full rounding into ripe citrus fruits and just a hint of the Alcohol that is present. Full in the mouthfeel, and lush. Wonderful carbonation. I really like this style and this beer, I will seek it out again, but I don't think I could make a night of drinking these. If I were to add a suggestion, it would be for a slightly fuller malt character.","deejaydan","0"
3.72,-9.7,3,3.5,3.5,5,4,"Clear amber, light off-white ring. Softer aroma than other Jolly Pumpkin offerings yet it grows on you. More vinous than others, it has a strong cork flavor to it (bottle has no cork, but barrel aged.. ), musty vinegar flavors, vinous earthiness in a peppery fashion. Slightly astringent around the edges and probably too vinous for me to enjoy it as much as other JPs, but very interesting, unique, charming. Herbal, spicy (rosemary) and lightly meaty even with a pleasant balsamic touch. Velvety texture, medium biting carbonation.","Rastacouere","Dec 17, 2004"
4.3,4.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a frothy 1 1/4" of creamy off-white head above the murky reddish caramel-hued brew. Head lasts, probably due to continuous streams of teensy bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass, and laces well with foamy bits here and there. Aroma is of spicy yeasts, with slight wood notes in the background. Taste is smooth, spicy pale malts upfront, fading into an oaky alcohol flavor, and then departs with some token warming. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, with the mouthfeel down just a tad because the barrel notes are still a bit biting for my tastes. Another enjoyable brew in the Jooly Pumpkin stable.","ppoitras","Dec 15, 2004"
3.31,-19.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,2,"Purchased this bottle in Ann Arbor (not far from the brewery) in December 2004 and consumed it a few days later. Pours a cloudy light straw color with a small amount of guiness-like frothy bubbles that form a finger-thick mat of white head. Looks like a Belgian White. Smells of caramel and oranges. Sweet and enticing. Fine sharp carbonation bites early with a closely accompanying malt sweet and then a yeasty sour typical of belgians. Orange. Clove. Woody. Yuck, for some reason, I had in my head that this would be a smooth, clean, and sweet lager. Tiny bubbles continue to stream to the surface, keeping a complete layer of head across the surface. I find that the tiny carbonation bubbles that form on my tongue distract from the flavor and mouthfeel (which appears to be medium). As the beer warms, the clove and yeast-bready flavors become stronger. A smooth sweet is present, like the flavor of a green melon (muskmelon?). An odd combination with the sharp & fine carbonation and potent sour. I do NOT like funky belgians, and this beer is doing nothing to change that. A complete disappointment (but my scores reflect judgment of the beer in relation to its style). For the first time in my life, I'm going to dump a beer down the drain (2/3 of the bottle remains).","mentor","Dec 13, 2004"

4.15,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours a murky red color with a foamy egg white head. The nose is quite strong with flavors of spice, smoke, and burnt residual sugars. The taste has a very dominant bourbon flavor to it. I could tell this was oak barrel aged at first sip. The oaky bourbon flavor is strong but I notice a mixture of light and dark fruits along the edges and a decent amount of tropical spices. The flavor is sweet but the finish is dry and yeasty. The finish seems to be a bit weak and the flavors, though having good depth, seem a little young. I bet this could age really well. It's great to see a brewery of this quality in producing Belgian beers come from Michigan.","granger10","Oct 23, 2004"
