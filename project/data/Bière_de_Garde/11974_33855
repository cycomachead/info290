4.42,6.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/29/2011. Fast gusher upon opening as expected, but didn’t lose any. Pours very cloudy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy bright white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming off the sediment. Aromas of huge tart lemon, peach, sour apple, pear, apricot, pineapple, pepper, clove, oak, hay, straw, funk, and earthy spiciness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity, spicy, and funk notes. Taste of big peach, tart lemon, sour apple, pineapple, pear, apricot, clove, pepper, hay, straw, oak, funk, light leather, and earthy spiciness. Moderate tart acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon, peach, pear, sour apple, pineapple, apricot, clove, pepper, hay, straw, oak, light leather, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of tart fruity, spicy, and funk flavors; with nearly zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, acidic, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged wild golden ale. Huge complexity and balance of tart fruity, spicy, and funk notes; and very smooth to sip on. A highly fantastic offering. As the carbonation died out because of the gusher, it became slightly harder to drink; but with full carbonation this was absolutely insane.","superspak","Oct 19, 2012"

It's nearing something of a Saison. I had an initial concern with the sticker shock creating disappointment, but all was relieved. At $13.50 for a 750ml, it would be more of a special occasion beer than every day drinker. It was great on an unseasonably warm January afternoon (blue skies and temps somewhere around 40).

This beer, to be honest, is less funky than I was expecting (in comparison to say the Bière De Mars from JP). However, this adds to its drinkability.

4.48,8,5,4.5,4.5,3,5,"Shocking straw golden color. Verging on Sunkist. How's that for a technical term? Great refreshing tartness, but has a sweet citrus side that reminds me of ripe grapefruit. If you are a fan of extreme beers or big, in your face fruit flavors, it's worth tracking this beer down. I would argue it's better than Jolly Pumpkin and I wish it had wider distribution (i.e. Massachusetts, please). Mouthfeel was fine. Like I said it seemed to have some residual sugar which definitely gave it some body. Drinkability? 22 oz. was gone. Rapidly.","andymurray","Dec 18, 2009"

Shared on the stoop with the Lady at the end of a long hot day. Pours a beautiful vibrant golden, almost florescent looking, slightly hazed, healthy two-finger head receding slowly into a creamy covering layer. The nose is full of oak and funky citrus zest. Lemon-lime, sour apple, orange zest and a nice woodsyness. Reminiscent of the finest gueuze Belgium has to offer. First sip is like stepping into the past. Maybe that's because I'm reminded of the good times I had when last drinking this beer, but it also has that old world, rustic farmhouse vibe to it. Initially tart, giving way to loads of complexities. Funky bugs, musty, earthy, dusty, spicy, slightly floral and a subtle herbal hop profile and passive pale malt. And then lots of citrus. Familiar lemon rind but also a deeper juicyness to it. I'm getting notes of fresh squeezed OJ here. Pineapple maybe. As it warms I'm almost reminded of Gatorade. An artificial flavor indeed, which amazes as this beer is of course all natural. Despite a lot of acidity and a wrenching, dry finish, this beer is somehow extremely refreshing. Truly an artisan product. Will search this one out on my travels again and again... Supple and delicious.","twelvsies","Apr 19, 2009"

Taste has the before mentioned sour fruits with some grains and crips hay. Popcorn, oak, vanilla, and a touch of vinegar midway with a puckering lemongrass aftertaste. Light and refreshing body with a crazy crisp feel from the extremely active carbonation. The overall mouthfeel of this beer really leaves you begging for more, very champagne-esque.

Why bother picking up half a pound at the Bedford Cheese Shop when you can get it here. Actually. It just makes me want to take a bite out of some hunk of cheesy goodness.

Citrus sorbet explodes into the tartish, dry, bitterish, refreshing finish. Medium body with a soft, smooth feel underneath rolling, bottle-conditioned carbonation. Very drinkable and damn good! I'm excited for this brewery and wish them luck on their forthcoming facility. In the meantime, you can't go wrong with having Ron at JP helping out!","alexgash","Jul 29, 2007"
3.8,-8.4,4,4,4,4,3,"The energy and substance of this beer is revealed by a rising column of foam from the neck of a freshly opened bottle. It pours very pale and clear yellow. Aromas of marsh grass and moldy lemon peels. A dry herbal attack of lemon and grapefruit is supported by slick, muscular texture. Very tart. Bitter finish. Bubblegum powder stitches chipped basement rocks to yellow leather flavors. Begs to be served with grassy alpine cheeses, kraut and organ meats.","putnam","Feb 12, 2007"
3.82,-8,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall impression: A light, refreshing, funky French-style ale. Not my cup of tea but well done. Drinkability suffers a bit for me due to the sourness. Not overdone but 12 oz would go along way for me let alone 750 mL's.","mattcrill","Dec 31, 2006"
4.25,2.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"D- The beer is quite refreshing and would live up to it's purpose according to the bottle of "drinking on the beach". The complexity and the sourness keeps you begging for more. All together a great beer to quench my thirst today.","zdk9","Nov 20, 2006"
4.45,7.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I didn't know what to expect from this brew as it was my first biere de garde and this is only its second review, but I was really impressed. I can't imagine a much better example of the style. Amazing beer, especially for such a small brewery I'd never heard of before. Definitely worth seeking out this Leelanau offering.","WeisGuy","Beers"
