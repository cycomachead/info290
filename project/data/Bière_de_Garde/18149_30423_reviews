"O - A really nice, accessible biere de garde on the sweeter side of the style.  A great table beer for thanksgiving."

"quite a bit of carbonation, lacks flavor depth for me, probably the style of beer"

"On tap at Lost Abbey in San Marcos.  Not my favorite style but this was really disappointing."

"O: strong (ABV) for style."

"This is an extremely drinkable ""extra"" ale with no bite at the front of the taste. It is very smooth throughout, with just a bit of hops on the back of the tongue, with a bit of tangy citrus as well. The flavor is mild, which is both good and yet also leaves you looking for a bit more taste, too. Well crafted, it's greatest quality is it's smoothness."
"Very nice table beer - won't overpower any foods, esp lighter summer fare. Great value for the money, too. Got this corked and caged 750ml for under $9."

"O: first experience with this style of beer, was interesting and I'll give gift of the magi by LA a try too"
""
""

"Overall - Straightforward, but tasty."
""
""
""

"Despite the name, this isn't avant garde for the style. This slots in nicely between Lost Abbey's Devotion and their Abbey Dubbel and would be a good introductory beer for the style."
""
""
""
"o - overall BdG isn't my favorite style, but this is a nice offering. a bit rich and syrupy and chewy for what i like in this style, but the toasted malt is nice. the caramel and thickness make it feel like an old barleywine. this beer should've been consumed a while ago."

"Overall a pretty solid beer. Its not doing anything crazy but still a satisfying beer. Gets pretty bitter once it warms."
"O: 4.5"
""

"On draft at Pizzacato in San Diego. Pours deep golden, clear, with a big creamy white head. Hay aroma, some yeast, with light pale malt sweetness. Flavor is very light hay and hops, again with light malt honey sweetness. Does not finish particularly clean or crisp, and there is lingering yeast on the palate. relatively light bodied with medium carbonation. This tasted much like a standard Helles lager to me when I was expecting a bit more farmhouse and light yeasty goodness. Only OK in my book."

"O - This was an old bottle. I'm sure if it falls off with age or improves. Fairly drinkable with a curious taste."
""
"My first Lost Abbey beer to try.Pours into my Hennepin glass a slight hazed peach color with a great looking thick one finger off white head that leaves a nice full ring of broken lace as it settles ever so slowly.I pick up vanilla with a peaches cream-like note,some mildy nutty pilsner malt as well.Flavors of nutty pilsner malts,vanilla,and a light tart green apple in the finish.A great food beer with alot of richness and subtle flavors."

"O: Nice overall, just not something I'd go out of the way to search out"
""
""
""
""

"The body was was on the light side of medium, and the finish was so light as to be non-existent. Drinkability would have been OK, except for the weird funk and ashtray taste. Overall, not terrible, but I was expecting more."

"O- A good beire de garde, typical of the style from my experience ( which isn’t a lot for this style). A beer I could drink in the summer sitting in the yard relaxing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Started out really great with a beautiful appearance and really great and aromatic presence in the glass. Unfortunately perhaps the age hurt this one with the medicinal bitterness overpowering the more delicate fruitiness. Maybe I will seek out a fresher bottle for comparison. Had high hopes on opening and suffered a bit of a letdown in the taste test. Still plenty drinkable and enjoyable, but what the aroma promised could have been something great if the flavor lived up to it."

"OV: I really like this beer and feel the Biere de Garde style is underrated. The flavours were really nice, which is the main aspect of any beer. It paired very well with my mushroom burger on multi-grain bread with salsa veggies and swiss. Definitely a good food beer for light to moderate fare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good, not great. Every beer I've had from this brewer has been fantastic so my expectations were high. Not a repeat buy for me."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has some interesting aromas and flavors, but the dryness seems unusual for the style and cuts through (instead of emphasizing) the malty and earthy flavors."
"a fun, if understated brew. the pour is a little hazy, light orangey yellow with a finger or two of white head. nice lacing left behind. the nose is yeasty, just past neutral on the acid front, some fruit and gentle candy sugar notes. the flavor is surprisingly subtle, not intense or aggressive at all, more of like a high class session ale, well balanced, interesting flavors, and good carbonation with an airy texture and an easier feel than 7% abv would usually allow for. some sugar in the finish, but it isn't too much, and there is a summery vibe to this beyond a saison. grassy and spunky, exacerbated by bright bubbling, I like the feel of this more than anything. clean finish, but not dry, especially compared to some other lost abbey stuff. overall a very well made beer, one that could be an every day drink for me if it wasn't so expensive, but damn its refreshing, satisfying, and yet undifferentiated in some ways..."

"Bright orange in body with white bubbly head that stays as a thin film. Aroma of citrus, horse blanket, vague grass, circus peanuts. Tastes of citrus notes, fresh kiwi, wet grass, mild horse blanket towards the finish with light booze and orange rind bitterness. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Very prickly. A pleasant drink that features more citrus than horse blanket. Good choice for food pairings with its bubbly mouthfeel to clean the palate."
"Soft delicate fruits on the tip of the tongue, apples and peaches and rose petals. Brisk carbonation with a rolling body. Cuts clean and crisp with European hop bitterness. Mild alcohol on the back of the fruit lends to a slightly Fruity finish but again this is balances by the nice balancing crisp bitterness. Semi sweet with a balancing quality. Warm buttery finish yet the finish is still clean. Faint earthiness."
""
""
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 3 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big apple, pear, pepper, orange peel, caramel, bread, floral, grass, coriander, earth, honey, light funk, and herbal. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of pear, apple, pepper, citrus peel, coriander, bread, caramel, clove, honey, floral, grass, earth, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, pepper, bread, coriander, clove, caramel, floral, grass, honey, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; with a very nice malt and yeast spiciness balance; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Biere de Garde style. Very nice flavor complexity and balance; very smooth and crisp to sip on. Really enjoyed this one."
""

"This pours a cloudy copper color with bubbles constantly rising to the top for a thick white head. The aroma has a yeasty, banana, farmhouse ale scent. The initial flavors are wheat mixed with citrus that create a well balanced flavor with the yeast. The texture is superb while being light tasting to the tongue with a dry finish."
"O: this is an excellent saison, great use of yeast, excellent balance, I'm not huge fan of this style, but this was great."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A very drinkable example of this style and I will search long and wide for the sour version because layering some sour notes one will make a fantastic beer."
"Overall a real pleasant brew to be having."

"Overall, it’s not a bad brew. And for 7% it doesn’t impart a tremendous amount of alcohol taste, nor does it taste bad. The Lost Abbey collection has not been a preferred one for me although I am planning a nice motorcycle ride down the coast to their tasting room soon."
""
"O- This can quickly become your ""Sunday Evening Ale."" It is an impressive ale, though, if the aroma was much more deeper than I expected it to be, this could definitely entice me A LOT more to make it into my weekly rounds. Price shouldn't be an issue with this one, if you see it, try it. It is by far, not disappointing, but also not a must in my book. ~bottoms up! :)"
""
"O – This beer is kind of all over the place. It looks fantastic and smells great, but the flavor and mouthfeel share this woody astringency that takes away from all the good flavors included. It doesn’t make it a bad beer, but it’s just not as good as it could be. Still a tasty beer, and I’m very glad I got to try it."
"Pours a hazy deep yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, earthy and cheese like notes. In the taste, tart and earthy, with notes of white grape. Quite smooth and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness that leads into the tartness of white grape in the aftertaste. Missing some hop presence, yet nice tartness, smooth and quite enjoyable."
""
"This beer had a nice cloudy color and I was looking forward to trying it. Since I am a fan of smelling the beer, I was expecting a strong aroma, but unfortunately this beer has little odor at all. Obviously that doesn't discount this beer, it's was just deceiving. The first sip had a nice mouthfeel: nicely carbonated but not too muc. The taste of this beer is subtle. If you are looking for a bold flavor, it does not exist here, although I found the crisp, mild taste to be quite enjoyable. I say you should try it..."
"O: Great beer that showcases the malt in a fantastic way. Well balanced sweetness/alcohol/hops. Good beer to keep on hand in the cellar."
""
"O - A nice intro to this style, a good spring beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty tasty, good for drinking at a picnic with light farmers market foods as the day winds down. Be aware of the alcohol."
"Overall: A nice Biere de Garde that I often overlook. It sure makes a fantastic base for sour beers."
""
""
"O- a very tasty brew, drinkable at 7.0, but one is enough."
""
"750ml bottle. Pours hazy orange with a thick, long lasting, white head. Aroma is of Pale malt, barnyard yeast, alcohol, hints of grassy hops and ripe apricots. Body is full, smooth and creamy. Taste is of bready malt, barnyard yeast, peppery, earthy hops, alcohol and apricots. Finish is massive, dominated by peppery hops and alcohol. Wonderful brew."

""

"Overall: tasty! Could be better - mouthfeel is a bit of a letdown. Still very nice beer and super stoked to try."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear honey gold with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty weak and is of grain/malt and mild spices. Taste is of grain, spices, and some slight citrus flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but it tastes better than it smells."
"Overall: a solid tasty beer where one can have more that one glass in a session. Very quaffable."
""
"C+"
""
""
"Overall this is not what I expect from a Bière de Garde. Lacks the vinous quality, the carbonation... just didn't measure up to the few other versions I've had in this style."
""
""
"O: This isn't worth how expensive it is, plain and simple. Glad I tried it, would never foot the bill again."
""
"one of the light and bready beers, thats impressive when you can pull it off, but not necessarily going to bbe something I'm all about as a recurring customer. I'm not a biere de garde guy, but as far as they go, this one is decent enough. There's a fine hop quality, very small, built with a belgian yeast, light body but bready quality that is probably a relatively difficult beer to pull off."
""
"O - average at best, was hoping for more. Disapointed in this one."
""
"750ml brown bottle with cork. Thanks to Julien and Pierre-Luc. Golden blond ale, a white thick head is on top. The nose is unidimentional, grainy and fruity (cherry). The grain is omnipresent and ackward. The taste doesn't differ from the nose with grain and maize. Some hops in the aftertaste. Medium bodied. Overall an easy drinking bière de garde that would have benefit from less grain and more malt (!!)"
""
""
"Overall decent but I probably wouldn't get it again. So many others out there to try...."

"I was won over with this beer's fruity tendencies. The sweeter side of the malts are uncovered over time, almost rewarding you for continuing to drink and discover. I am always complaining that Belgian beers have too much candied sugar in them. Well, this beer seems to know how to solve that. Please make the malt for your Dubbels more like this one! I had to get some to go, and will look for this in local stores as well."

"O: Not a bad beer, paired this up with some brie and wassa crackers. Worked out pretty well. Would be a good weeknight beer on a hot summer night."
""
""

"A bit disappointed for my first (EDIT: second) Lose Abbey beer. The look was the part of his beer."
""
"Nicely made and drinks well, without pushing any boundaries. Lacks X-factor, though who's to say Lost Abbey thought this needed it."

"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pours a lovely clear amber with a very thick and rather persistent white head. Crisp, malty aroma has a sharp fruity tone like a good cider. Satisfying flavor is mainly malty and has an undertone of sour apple, not complex but fine for sipping. Smooth, firm-bodied texture has a fair amount of fizz, and it leaves a malty, fruity, slightly woody finish."
"Poured this de Garde into a large wine glass and it has a light golden tone with one finger of bright white head. It has a smell of fruit, such as pear and orange, also some spices. There are some malts as well with a bit of earthiness to it. Upon sipping, I can taste pepper. hops, cloves and yeast. All of it is balanced very nicely. MF is medium in the body with a similar carbonation level. All in all, this is one of the Biere de Gardes that stands out for me. Not an inexpensive beer, but worth it."
"O: a little disappointed in this as I am normally blown away by any lost abbey beer. Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of biere de gardes? I give it a 4 out of 5"
"D/O: A good drinker and overall a good crafted brew."
"O=Overall a nice enjoyable beer, refreshing and light goes really goes down good and is refreshing."
"Had this in bottle in early 2010 and liked it a lot better than this tap version."
"Another brew with thanks from Mrkennedy and it pours a hazy yellow golden hue which leaves a two finger head that slowly settles down to a one finger layer and little clingy lacing,the smell is baked bread,yoghurt,honey and vanilla,the mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and very nice for the style almost like liquid bread but the tastes of baked bread,honey,candied pears,light boiled candy and warming stonefruit towards the end dont really jump out at me to say WOW its more of just a good Biere de Garde than a great one cheers."
"O - A nice, light beer with easy drinkability. A little fruity but not in a terribly bad way."
"O-this beer was actually very difficult to finish. i love strong beers but the alcohol note was just too evident. this was just a gross tasting beer. don't even try it."
"Overall a nice enjoyable beer, refreshing and light goes really good with some cheese."
"D&O: The drinkability was very good and refreshing, as I find most Bière de Garde to be. I would like to try this one again."
"4.5 D: Best LA beer I've had yet. This is a relatively simple, great tasting beer. I might actually pay what this costs regularly if it were available in my area."
"A good Biere de Garde that is very drinkable"
"O - Not a bad hot-day sorta brew, this is fairly sessionable despite the 7% ABV. I just wish the flavor stacked up to the nose, and that the unpleasant metallic flavor wasn't there."
"O: I am surprised and impressed by this beer given some of the lack luster reviews I have read. It is a really solid Biere de Garde that I would seek out again."

"750 mL brown Belgian bottle, cork and cage, with no freshness date. Brewed with two-row, honey malt and house-toasted malt, hopped with Brewer's Gold, Strisselspalt and Saaz, and fermented with lager yeast at ale temperatures; OG 1.060, FG 1.008. Pours crystal-clear amber, with low carbonation and a short, loose head that leaves very light lacing. Smells of sour grapes and vinous malts at first (how long was this on the shelf?), but it smells less aged with breathing. Becomes floral and sweet, with notes of toasty/bready malts, spicy/perfumy hops and a bit of alcohol. Tastes fairly similar, clean, with a hint of sweetness, a creeping bitterness, and a mild malt astringency. The body is light and moderately-carbonated, with a dry and warming finish. Easygoing and fairly good for the style, but it is way overpriced for what it is."
"Pretty tasty. Poured a hazy golden brown with a large head that settles down but doesn't completely dissipate. Nice lacing and some carbonation. Grainy, bready aroma, with a definite presence of hops. Similar taste, very grainy, hoppy with some fruitiness to it: citrus and light Prunus fruits and a touch of almond. Medium mouthfeel. I'd drink more if given the chance."
"Narrative: ::Ding dong:: he's here already? I havent even finished me eye lin- ah but who cares, he's so easygoing that he wont even notice that I only flatironed my top chunky layers. His bright blonde locks, cool disposition, who am I to keep him waiting. ""Sorry I'm no rea-"" oh well that's a new bit of panache, a step with a ball turn into the marble foyer and he leans lazily upon the ballustrade. ""-eady."" His light breezy air is welcoming but not cloying, you exhale and turn around closing the door, noticing the sunlight cascading through an eddy of dust particles dancing on a sunbeam and- he's gone. But you aren't worried, you have 21 more ounces of this fellow, to lithely waste away this verdant afternoon."
"A great beer experience!"
"A very nice surprise from Lost Abbey. I have been disappointed with a lot of their offerings. Not with this one though. I wish there was a bit more fruity flavors going on, especially for a Bière de Garde. Though overall, very nice. Something I would recommend."
"O - Overall I like it, I'm going to pour another glass and go sit on the porch. I'm going to cellar another bottle and come back to it and see how it is in a year."
"O: It was a nice beer and worthy of my drinking.... nothing else."
"take me out to the ballgame."
"First the only bad thing I will say about this beer is the way it is bottled. I had to saw off the top of the cork and use a cork screw. Lots of carbonation in this one, resulting in a four finger head of dense foam, and wonderful clinging lace. The color is a 9 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is floral in character, with solid fragrances of apple, orange peel, lemon, and earthly tones. Great taste, of green grape, citrus, green apple, and hops. Creamy in my mouth, but a little drying on the back of my tongue and back sides of my throat. Carbonation is just right. Overall a great brew, easy to drink and a great taste."
"D- Not very familiar with this style, but this is one tasty beer. Will definitely be buying this again."
"Definitely worth trying, definitely worth buying again. Bring on the summer so we can really enjoy this one."
"Taste: Big and fruity. Sharp bitterness that sticks to the sides. A tiny bit alcoholic, but well-balanced by the creamy and smooth feel."
"T: In my notes, I wrote that it tastes like a saison but without the funk. Something very earthy about the taste. Freshly baked bread in the taste as well along with a slight hint of earthy hops."
"Avant Garde has a pretty nice, complex flavor, but wasn't the best of the style I tried that day."
"D-A very satisfying, delicious, and easy drinking beer. The frustration with the cork that I experienced was enough to make me consider avoiding Lost Abbey in the future."
"The beer had a medium body with extreme carbonation, but the right carbonation. The beer was smooth, creamy and easy to drink. This was my first for the style and was a little unsure of what to expect but I will definitely be trying more."
"It poured hazy golden. Lingering bitterness on the back of the pallet. And not in the good way. Nose rather unimpressive, mostly lagerish. It did follow a rich malty aged nick. Still, drinkable, yet really not sold on this ale. Still want to try their other styles."
"Pours a yellow-orange color with a white head and a moderate amount of lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward quite a bit of grain and bread with some mild yeast presence and a touch of a farmhouse character. The taste is mostly just a bit of grainy malt without too much else. The finish is oddly dry and a bit too bitter. Not terribly drinkable."
"The mouthfull had to much carbonation, but as for the drinkability it was a beer I could have anytime."
"Beer is medium bodied and boring. There is nothing of note that would make you think that this beer is a Biere de Garde. It has that graininess that I feared from the aroma at the back end of the mouth. I suppose when push comes to shove it's just an OK beer, a pretty big disappointment for me personally."
"D: The drinkability is fine but the uninspired aromas and flavors will likely keep Avant Garde from being a repeat purchase."
"Mouthfeel is great for a belgian style ale and is right up there with actual belgian beers. This beer does an excellent job of blurring the lines between a belgian style and an authentic belgian beer. Very refreshing and drinkable this is a great food beer and would go well with poultry or light fish dishes."
"Pretty tame beer. Good, but tame. I expect more from Lost Abbey."
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer is a dark, pale gold color, with no head. The beer had a sweet nose to it, with a pinch of hops. The beer tastes of very light flavors blended together, including undertones of peanut butter, oddly enough. There are also bits of hops sprinkled into the flavor, as well. The beer has a body somewhere between a gold and an amber. Not overly full, but smooth. The beer is light and loose finished, and the taste just up and dies in your mouth."
"Very fresh and clean on the palate, appetizing, refreshing. The lees add some complexity but mainly this is a nice fresh tangy brew that is simple and pleasing. Quite dry, with a balanced bitter finish. Not challenging or funky in any way, but very nice."
"Avant Garde appears a hazy, yellow straw color. There is a half inch of head that leaves a bit of lacing. The aroma is pleasant, with a mild funkiness. The beer has some nice herbal and tea characteristics. I do wish it was more funky and bold. I do not believe that the beer is aptly named, as it is simple and certainly not out of the ordinary or ""avant garde."" Worth a try, but not something to avidly seek out."
"D: And by drinkable do you mean taking down the whole bottle by myself? Then yes. An enjoyable beer. Glad I can get this one year round."
"Good stuff. Much enjoyed."
"D - This is a pretty decent beer not my favorite from Lost Abbey but one that I won't turn away worth giving it a try sometime"
"D: it drank exceptionally good due to how light the flavor and the body was but was still a decent beer but not a beer that I would be excited to drink often."
"Medium bodied but creamy beer. The carbonation is very good in this beer, making the beer very appealing on the tongue and in the mouth, without excess gas. Alcohol is barely noticed in the beer, and I could have easily finished the 750 ml without noticing it."
"Overall an interesting take but definately needs to be paired with food. As the label suggests: bread, apple, cheese; any of the three will do."
"Interesting, if a little uncomplicated, beer. Body is fairly light so that makes for easy drinking. Not my favorite from LA, but one I might pick up again to compliment a meal."
"I suppose that helps explain the maibock similarity. Still, that's not a bad thing, this beer just stretches the style to make a complex and interesting beer. Definitely worth checking out."
"I thought this could go fast, but it isn't complexity and some strength of flavors (chemical booze and bitter) keep this to a sipper range. Very good brew. Glad I gave this a chance."
"The medicinal bitterness puts me off, but it's not terrible and I can enjoy large parts of this beer, just not the part that counts most - my remembrance of each sip."
"Pours a hazy, copper/gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, yeast, sweet malt, alcohol, and slight wheat. Fits the style of a Biere de Garde. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, yeast, sweet malt, slight wheat, alcohol, and a hint of floral. Overall, good aroma, body, and blend."
"A really nice beer and a very good Biere de Garde. I think it could use a tad more acidity on the palate, but that is just what would turn a very good beer into a spectacular one. This is a lovely drop."
"Avent garde pours a slightly amber golden color with a tightly packed head that is just a shade too dark to be called bright white. The head sticks around forever and leaves wonderful lacing on the tulip glass. Before I go any further, I just have to give Lost Abbey props for the name. It is both clever and classy. The aroma is fairly subdued, but quite nuanced with a touch of toasted malt sweetness, a hint of acidic fruit and a bit of musty tartness. The flavor is balanced, but slightly malt forward with a definite breadyness that mixes with noble hop flavor, apricot, lemon and a touch of toasted malt. That cellar tartness is in the flavor as well, though it is not as funky as say, your average saison. As the beer warms, the esters from the yeast really take over and it becomes a bit unpleasant. The mouthfeel is medium with a nice slightly dry finish that has a spiciness to it that is not nearly as prominent before swallowing. The drinkability really suffers from the yeast taking over as it warms. This is my first biere de garde and I am looking forward to trying others in the future."
"D- I like this but have had better in the style, the toastiness is the main attraction here and thats alright by me. Alcohol is a tad high but who gives a shit. I drank it quick, a quencher."
"D- this is a tasty brew. Very good for the style and I like it nuff said."
"Very clean and crisp pale malt with a load of Noble German hops. Yeast character is subtle with only some esters to enhance maltiness. Smell is of German spice. Taste is spicy, pale malty, and alcoholic. Bartender mentioned that this is brewed with a lager yeast at ale temperatures."
"D: Somewhere between a session beer and a sipper. A whole bottle wouldn't be far-fetched."
"Light to medium body. Fair amount of carbonation, could use a bit more to clean the palate. Only a bit of alcohol is felt. Pretty nice beer."
"Drinkability: A flavorful yet easy drinking beer. I could see visiting this one again, but it doesn't make it out this way, so no luck."
"D: Easy to drink. a very good beer. cant wait to have this one again."
"Been a long time since I've had a beer of this style. This one sort of seems in between a saison and a tripel. Can't say that I'm a big fan of it, though. A bit too much herbs in it for me, and I don't care for the aftertaste. Still, interesting to try, but I'd try a different beer of this style next time."
"Not exactly my thing. This beer is all over the place like some BIG beers can be but this is very subtle and it's still a mess. Not a good integration of flavors. Pass."
"This one pours a murky orangish-copper color with a big head due to lots of carbonation. I pick up a bit of spicy and grassy notes when smelling it. A bit of sour fruitiness as well...maybe a little funky. After sipping it, I get flavors of fruit, spicy yeast, and bread. This beer has a decent drinkability and has a great mouthfeel."
"D- A super-quaffable. The alcohol is exceptionally well hidden. A perfect beer for a warm afternoon on the patio."
"D: Flavorful and balanced; not too wild."
"This is a really nice beer. Good drinkability, with a good balance of hops and malt. A good entry into a style that I don't have much experience with."
"Overall - A pretty decent brew. Glad i tried it but at the price not something i'd be going back to."
"Pours a murky gold color, plume of fizzy white head, quickly diminishing but leaving enough behind for lacing. Smell is a very faint blend of fresh cut grass, dried grains, fresh baked bread, mellow lemon and faint spice. Taste is akin to biting into a fresh loaf of artisan bread with a faint kiss of herbs. Lighter side of medium bodied, moderate carbonation levels. Finnished as dray as any liquid i have ever ingested. A nice beer, somewhat mild, but a plesent drinking experience."
"Pours a hazy, milky golden color, capped off with an inch or so of rocky white foam. Smells lightly malty, with some grassy hops and maybe a hint of lemon. A nicely carbonated beer, with a decent malt backbone and some citrusy hop flavor. A nicely balanced, decently refreshing beer."
"Overall it is good but not great, I enjoy the Belgian produced ones a bit better."
"Ok, this just about tastes like a nice malty bock. Crazy and unexpected. Super munich maltiness, and I love me some munich! A bit of toastiness. Not much in the way of hops in this one. Perfectly balanced bittering, but not enough to get in the way of the malty goodness. Maybe a slight noble hop flavor reminiscent of Sazz. Very light belgian spiciness, but again, the malt prevails. Pretty clean for a Belgian style actually. A little EtOH comes out as is really starts to warm up. I'm diggin this one. Oh, and it has carbonation! Not just that, but perfect carbonation!"
"Drinkability: I really like this beer. A very good and bready beer with just the right spicing. Nice and malty, I cannot wait to have this again."
"D - This is a good Belgian-style ale from The Lost Abbey but seems to be a little style-confused."
"D: I would definitely drink this beer again, perhaps more if I could buy it in my state, but then I might get sick of it. Very tasty, low ABV and reasonably priced if you don't factor in the 8 hour drive to get it."
"A very drinkable beer. Blonde Bier de garde can be easy drinking and delicious when done well, which I believe is an appropriate description for this beer."
"Drinkability - Relatively so - a bit sweeter than I was expecting. I'm going to pair it up with a bit of cheese right now and see how that goes. I'd rather buy a JP style Bière de Garde in the future."
"Overall I was surprised by this beer, as I had been slightly disappointed by some of the other Lost Abbey offerings. This one however hits the mark, and I'll certainly be having this one again."
"Not a bad brew by any means. This is my first taste of any Lost Abbey offerings, and it was enjoyable. It was shared amongst friends and enjoyed. The rarity of this brew where I live means that enjoying this brewery's offerings may be few and far between."
"Ahh take the long way home have a saison, life is good. Introductions are familar yet have their own signature. Earth tones grip your palate and finish with a dry crisp note as they should. mellow times come quicker with the Avent Garde as they should at 7.0% abv. Take a sip, take it slow, enjoy the sunset."
"D - Very drinkable, very good example of the style."
"Tastes nice, but again not what I expect for the style. It's almost like a combination of a saison and an English barley wine. Big, sweet malt is balance by crisp, lightly citrusy malt. Ends straight-up sour, like a regular de Garde, with nodes of peach and lemon."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. I think this would go extremely well with a blue cheese."
"Medium bodied with a lot of earthy spice and sweet fruit flavor. Kind of nutyy too with a strong malt backbone. Hints of zesty peppery spice, citrus peel, citrus hoppiness, cinnamon and sweet alcohol. There's also a bit of a syrupy mouthfeel that I'm not really feeling. Unique interpretation of the style but average at best."
"Poured a hazy yellow color with good carbonation and a fluffy white head. Nose is yeast, fruits, spice, and booze.Taste is biiger malt up fron,t spice, sugars, grassy and a sticky, buttery note that sordove lingered around, it sordove declined the mouthfeel since was not pleasant and would not go away. Ok beer but not a go to beer either."
"A delicious albeit slightly sweet saison driven by intense fruit character, a great brew."
"Poured this beer into my Chimay glass from a 750 ml bottle. The appearance of the beer was a clear blonde/gold color with a quickly dissipating head. The aroma of the beer was dominated by a sweet, grassy maltiness. There were subtle hints of a citrus/lemon fruit ester. There was a buttery note present in the aroma as well. Could of been diacetyl or caramel malts or both. Hop aroma was low to none. The flavor of the beer was a malty/biscuit taste with more of that butter aroma coming through in the flavor. There was nice hop bitterness to balance the bready malt. There was a slight pepper/alcohol in the finish, but you still get a clean, lagered impression from the flavor like a well-attenuated beer should be perceived. Overall, I really enjoyed the interplay between the biscuit malt and the butter notes. Additionally, the alcohol gave another layer of complexity that I enjoyed."
"Bought last summer, poured into a wheat glass. Label has a nice bucolic scene of beer and cheese by an open window. Rich clear copper, huge fluffy head settles to a super thick 1/2"" head, lots of steady carbonation. Looks great. Smells really nice, sweet munich malt aroma. I assume there were a lot more hops in there originally, but since it's 1+ year old I'm sure they're faded out of there. The flavor is great, sweet and spicy with a good solid bitterness. The yeast seems to lend a nice black/green peppercorn earthy muskiness. Mouthfeel is good, rich but light, finishes clean and only so faintly coating. Drinks so easy, no sign of the 7%, I could chug this stuff. This a really delicious year old beer, I'd like to try it fresh some time."
"Draught at the brewery. Gold color with a white head. Bready malt, some dough, and a spicy hop note in the aroma. The flavor is pretty similar with moderate bitterness and a medium body. Pleasant, but not too much going on. It seems to follow more of the cleaner, lager-ish take on the style, and does it well but I think a funkier take would work better for these guys. I guess that's what Gift of the Magi is for, but I wish you could get that character in this small of a beer."
"I like the taste, there are some spices and fruit flavors going on that mix well together. Very drinkable, I'm enjoying the bottle myself tonight and not getting sick of this beer."
"D=drinkable for sure, but not one I'm going after really often."
"D-Goes down easy. This style, when done properly, is one of my favorites. I think it is an overlooked and ignored style and this is much undeserved. I find this to be fresh, bright and spot on, well done!"
"Drinkability: A beautifully balanced beer, not the best biere de garde I have ever had but still ranks high, and is a very easy drinking beer for 7%."
"This is an old favorite by now but it's a beer that had to grow on me. It's not intensely estery and alcoholic, not sour, not Bourbon or coffee infused, just a pleasant drinkable ale. I'm starting to think we need more like this. This is the beer I pick up virtually every time I'm in the mood for a Biere De Garde."
"D: Unbelievably drinkable. Wish this was easily available to me."
"Nothing wrong with Avant Garde, just very pedestrian, & I've had much better within the category (I'm lookin' at you, Schlafly)."
"The tatse is good and smooth very easily drinkable. Not your traditional farm house, much better to drink."
"Drinkability is top notch - very impressed."
"Thanks Mom. Next time we'll meet at Lost Abby to have some on tap."
"drinkability: good"
"This is very much like a collision of a sour ale and sparkling wine, and is all the tastier for it."
"drinkability is decent. the flavors are a bit less distinct than they could be. overall the brew is tasty and a bit boozy, but remains quite drinkable."
"D: A nice, sippable beer. Good with fruit and cheese. This beer comes off stronger than it is but it still is fairly drinkable."
"D - Not a bad brew, will quaff the 750 easily."
"Average in every way. Beer is also not typical of the style."
"Biere de garde is one of my favorite styles, and this isn't a very good de garde beer. The yeast profile is way too neat and clean. However, it's a very tasty beer, with no obvious flaws, well worth buying again."
"Drinkability: Would've stuck with the Gooze if it were still an option for availability / my wallet, but definitely fun to try. I might pick up a bottle if I ever see a particularly good sale on it, but it didn't blow nor drive me away. Quality, easy-drinker."
"This drank pretty good for the size but I wish that the flavors had gone a bit deeper. Quite refreshing with the lighter body. I'm glad to have tried this but one bottle was enough."
"D: Certainly not bad, but not outstanding, either."
"D- Delicious. Very enjoyable farmhouse ale."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a tall white head that has good retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has a touch of funk, but mostly comprised of citrus notes and a little breadiness. The flavor is quite fruity (citrus) with a touch of sour and funk. The carbonation keeps things light. Reminds me of a barnyard version of a witbier. The mouthfeel is light-medium and the drinkability is good. Tasty."
"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle into my basic tulip glass. Appears a cloudy muted orange color with about a finger of quickly fading fizzy head. The flavor and aroma is of spicy yeasty bread, citrus such as lemon and orange peel, a touch of caramel, grassy bitter hops. Just about a notch more than medium bodied with ample carbonation. Rather quenching on a warm evening."
"Not to bad, but not good enough to justify the price of a second bottle."
"Overall, a very drinkable Biere De Garde. Flavor is unified, with a tasty orange peel finish. Certainly worth a try."
"D- smooth nice beer for a hot day"
"Pours a clear dark golden color with a fluffy white head that dissipates to a cap. Nice lacing on the way down. Smells of bread and oranges, fig, a bit of honey. Taste is semi sweet with bready malty sweetness with orange and citrus flavors peaking through an almost earthy character. Lingering alcohol in the finish. Full body, slick mouthfeel, medium carbonation. I really enjoyed this one! Not to phenolic, light and fruity with a touch of alcohol."
"M/D - Light bodied and very crisp. Excellent carbonation and an easy drinker. Nothing remarkable about this beer, but a nice one all around."
"- Super drinkable because it tastes so good.. and not very strong at all as I am guessing this brew fits its style to the 'T'. A very good brew and a must try!"
"A tasty beer but the fruit flavor and overly orange notes challenge the notion of beer."
"D: Pretty easy to down this one. Unfortunately, after two flat bottles of this, I'm not going to be buying more, especially at the price."
"I don't have much experience with Bieres de Garde, most coming from American interpretations or the more commercial French exports, but I have had a few really good ones. It's a style of subtlety and simplicity. These beers wouldn't be worth ""keeping around"" if they weren't something special. Like Tomme Arthur's other Old World reflective pieces, this does the European rural towns proud. And it also makes me happy."
"Not as active on the carbonation front as I would expect from most Northwest European styles. Full body is certain appropriate, though. An interesting if perhaps challenging brew."
"Soft drinkable brew."
"M/D: Medium to near full body. Carbonation is a bit high and slightly prickly. Drinkability is decent as well. A pretty solid beer."
"750ml bottle served in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a quarter inch off-white head. Nose was alcohol and muted candi sugar. Taste follows nose, but also picked up some grassy notes. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent with some astringency and a lingering bitterness. Not really a huge fan of the style, but seems like it would pair well with many dishes."
"Pours hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. Nose of yeast, citrus, candied sugar, and alcohol. Full malt flavor up front, follwed with a strong grassy flavor at the finish. Both aroma and flavor were fairly mild. Low carbonation and medium thick mouthfeel. A good offering, but a little disappointing from Lost Abbey"
"D - Super easy to drink considering the ABV. Would love to sit under a tree and drink this away during a summer afternoon."
"Bottomline: Good beer, moderate price. I found it on sale and grabbed it, not to be disappointed. This beer would go excellent with a loaf of freshly baked bread, your favorite cheese, and fruit (apples)."
"Taste follows suit with a light fruitiness, sour apple perhaps, and some lingering dried fruit/fig flavors. Carbonation is high for a Lost Abbey brew and quite welcome given my other experiences. Plan to research the style for more info, nonetheless an intriguing brew. I give it the benefit of the doubt, yet I have my doubts..."
"D - Pretty descent drinkability. Goes down smooth and I could session with it."
"D: Kind of a let down for me but still a good beer. I had to bring this across state lines so I always expect more in a beer I do that for."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a one finger white head. Aroma is belgian yeast and doughy will a hint of fruit. Taste shows more of the fruit with a spicy malt backbone and belgian candi sugar. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium body. Drinkability is pretty easy due to the creaminess. Overall a good first impression of a regular line LA beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"D- Pretty easy to drink and pretty interesting brew."
"D - Great beer. Will have to buy a few more. My wallet is cringing."
"D= Another quality ale from Lost Abbey. While this is not the best Saison/Farmhouse/Biere de Garde ale out there, it is certainly good and one of the best from the U.S."
"D: This is a decent enough beer that I wouldn't turn down. But for some reason, I didn't find myself enjoying it all that much."
"Lacks complexity, and it ends up being a below the average biere de garde. Another disappointment from this highly regarded brewery."
"Very quick, and blochy white head that recedes to nothing in a short amount of time. Golden, bright copper amber. Very tiny bubbles help make for a mediocre appearance. Faint green apple skins, a little grassy hops, toasty malts, and maybe some bretty-like yeast in the nose. Very dry toasted malt, maybe a little champagne in flavor. Then the earthy, grassy hops, and add a little lemon peel. Crisp palate with hard to miss earthy hop and yeast notes. Pretty hoppy biere de garde. Pretty good and quaffable."
"Very easy drinker, nice flavor and aroma and feel has it go down nicely. Not a great beer, but a good one, missing the funkyness that I seek for this style. I prefer a bit of sourness or funk in mine, otherwise it would warrant an ""A"."
"Drinkability was good. No signs of 7% in the beer and overall it was pretty mild."
"Poured from a 750ml caged and corked bottle and served in a tulip. This poured a golden orange hue with a light haze and a thin head of off-white foam that quickly settled. The aroma included light skined fruits, grass, bread, and some spicy yeast esthers. The flavor had dry apple, pear, faint orange, fresh grass, a hint of caramel, and some mildly funky, spicy yeast. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had moderate, aggressive carbonation. Finishes dry and very crisp. Quite refreshing. Not the most avant garde beer, but very well made and quite tasty."
"Overall, this is currently my favorite Lost Abbey brew and one of the best beer's I've had in a long time. I will be recommending this as much as possible to all my fellow Stone (and related) drinkers. I give it an A-."
"Pours a somewhat hazy orange colored body with a big foamy white head, lasting. Sweet floral aroma. Some musty dark fruit too., also some nuttiness. Nice light floral taste, some spiciness. Soft carbonated palate. Some nuttiness balancing the hoppiness. A little bitter hoppiness, along with some dustiness. Tasty."
"From a 750 mL bottle. Pours with a large foamy head, has a slightly peachy hue. Hazy, well carbonated, color is dark gold. Aroma is yeast and tart green apples. Starts sweet and petillant becoming dry with an apply tart finish and aftertaste. Medium body and moderate alcohol. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"D-This is a decent to pretty good beer. Not the best LA beer or Biere de Garde I have had but still a very interesting brew. I wish the taste were as good as the smell-but it falls short for me. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a slightly hazed copper/amber, thin white head forms, drops quickly to a thin ring around the glass, not as much head as would be expected, but looks okay. Smell is pretty cool, heavy caramel graininess, quite fruity, apricot, neat floral character, wheat, very malty, very fragrant, bit of coconut and light spice. Taste is neat, some vanilla and coconut, caramel, fruit, mango, wheat, sour fruit in the finish, slight oxidation, very malty, some floral, some candi sugar, pretty interesting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, not as complex as I would expect but still pretty neat. Thanks Russ!"
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced. definitely an american take on this traditional flemish style - betrayed by the aroma more than anything - but still quite nice."
"D - This is probably an off bottle but based on it I would buy it again. Everything but the taste was well presented but taste is what really matters in the end and this one didn't measure up."
"Very smooth and easy drinking. Not an over the top, mind blowing beer, but rather it is well balanced and very enjoyable. I enjoyed this one with a plate of soft cheese. I will be tracking this beer down again."
"Very sweet and fruity tasting, but refrains from becoming cloying. Earthy undertones don't reach the full level of complexity I would hope for, but may offer a suggestion of aging opportunity. Reminds me more of an American take at a Belgian styled tripel than a Biere de Garde. Very slight hop bitterness perceived in the finish. The carbonation is light and approaches being under carbonated. The fruity esters dominate this brew that provides an alternative vision of the Biere de Garde style. Worth a try, but slightly overpriced for the experience."
"D: Very well made and enjoyable. Good but not life changing."
"Pours a cloudy brown orange color with a dense white/yellow head. Looks good and dirty and rustically brewed. Interesting fruity odor, strawberries and satsumas with a sweet malt and a tart wheatiness too. Taste is mildly sour up front with persimmons and caramel sweetness. Fruity alcohol flavor and a hint of roasted barley. Finish turns into a big ethanol and cardboard flavor with a strong orange rind note that i dont like at all. Medium bodied, fairly highly carbonated and a bit watery on the finish. An interesting, but in the end fairly lackluster, Biere de Garde. Too much of an unpleasant flavor on the finish for my taste. Not my favorite."
"This beer was brewed in San Marcos, CA. I hope you enjoy your next Lost Abbey beer."
"Overall impression: Not great - too hot for my tastes."
"A deep golden color, with a three finger thick white head on top. The head laces slowly down the glass. A definitive yeasty fragrance at first scent, that is followed by a spicy sweetness. That scent brings along some fruitiness and a touch of grass at the end. A very mild, mellow malty flavor at the front, followed with a bisuity flavor, along with a sweet spiciness. A mild hop citric bitterness hits the back of the palate at the end. A light mouthfeel, not watery though, it has more character. It tip-toes across the palate, bringing the cleansing feeling carbonation. This is my first expierence with this style and this brewery. The style is unique, the malt and spiciness are strong and disstinctive. This went well with a mixed green salad and balasmic vingerette."
"I have not had much experience with Biere de Gardes, but this was a fantastic beer and very flavorful."
"D: This beer grew on me the farther i got into the bottle. I'd have again, if I can locate again."
"D. Drinkability isn't to high its too sweet for me and for the price it wasn't worth it"
"The first of the Lost Abbey I have purchased in NYC. The price renders this a rare treat but the beer itself is very good."
"Overall while not my favorite of the lost abbey beers, it was defintly solid as far as I was concerned. I would have no issue with trying this one again anyday, though at the pricetag I am not sure I would really try and track it down. Still though a solid and very respectable beer that i would not turn my nose up to."
"I'm glad I had the chance to try this beer, but I will most likely not try it again."
"Smell is yeasty with some citrus fruit undertones. Taste is more acidic citrus with some yeast and spice. Pretty unassaulting and common. To be 100% truthful, I was expecting a little more from this beer. Still tasted and went down smooth, just nothing worth hunting down."
"D: A very good French farmhouse ale from the USA. Probably one of the best brewed on this side of the Atlantic. Look forward to sampling more from Lost Abbey"
"Overall, a good but not great beer. Can't really recommend unless you can easily get. This is my 3rd Lost Abbey and so far not been real impressed with any of em. I think they might fall into the overhyped cause they are hard to get category."
"Drinkability is ok, an average amber ale loosely in the Bière de Garde style, not bad but not worth seeking out. Another beer reinforcing my impression that The Lost Abbey is pretty over-hyped."
"D: While this beer does not look or smell out of this world amazing, I found it hard to put this beer down. I sipped and sipped and before I even noticed the bottle was empty. Overall a very tasty, highly drinkable, biere de garde."
"The highlight is the apricot taste, with a slight floral zip. True to style which is worth a lot, but I don't feel this is a beer I'd aggressively seek a repeat of."
"Drinkability: Pleasant enough, and a good session beer if you are eating something to balance out the malt sweetness, but it wouldn't be first on my list."
"D: A familiar flavor, but very well done. I don't remember the last time I had this beer, but it needs to make its way into regular rotation. For the price and the proximity, it's damn good."
"Drinks fairly easy, an alright/good stab a the style"
"Pours out a deep hazy orange color with burnt orange in the middle and a nice head. The smell is of straw and old citrus. The taste is similar but becomes stronger. Straw, dried grass, and yeast round out what the nose delivers. Dry in the mouth and lighter than I expected in the body. Very awesome beer but I was thinking it would sweep me off my feet more. Regardless, very happy and appreciative I was able to try it. Lost Abbey is awesome."
"Drinkability is excellent and makes this a great one for sessions and snacks."
"goes well with cheese and crackers."
"An avant garde brew certainly worth trying."
"For a farmhouse ale, I thought it was alright. It had a nice yellow/orange appearance with a nice two-finger head. The taste on the other hand was a bit weak...wish it had just a little more of that citrus and yeasty flavor to it. The mouthfeel was okay, with the right amount of carbonation. The beer was also very easy to drink and would probably have it again."
"D: Not too bad. Not the best Lost Abbey brew, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"smooth, not too thin. fluffy but otherwise gentle carbonation."
"D: This is a good offering from the Lost Abbey, not as strong as Red Barn, but still tasty and servicable. A nice California take on this French style."
"Notes: Tastes like a Dragonmead brew. After looking at the other reviews, this bottle may be a little off. Neither the rocky head nor sparkly body is here."
"Pours a hazy, orange color and smells of lemony sweet tea. Taste is mild, dry dusty sweet lemony character. Light to medium bodied and a fizzy mouthfeel. Pretty unique, and very drinkable. I liked this one ok, but it was a bit sweet."
"D: Mellow, malty, and sublime this is a very drinkable brew but not nearly as complex as I was expecting."
"Not at all bad, but it looked so damned good, and it's so easy to drink, that you kind of wish it had a little more going on."
"Monk's/$13.50/750 ml"
"Pours a lustrous golden with a fine head and constantly straming bubbles. Smells of red apples and honey. Juicy and fresh aromas. The taste is like a candied red apple with a hint of cinnamon with some nice herbal bitterness at the end. Very fresh and nice. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, but with an underlying sweetness and enough body and spice to keep it interesting. A very nice summer or fall refresher."
"Very nice solid beer. Pairs well with spicy food or with a simple ploughman's plate kind of thing."
"750ml bottle courtesy of KingG, thanks! the cork gave a very loud pop when I opened it but the head was not out of control. This has a nice light-orange color with some white bubble action. very subtle sweet honey on the nose, bready flavor with a bit of fruit on the tip of the tongue , oddly easier to drink than the Red Barn I had last night. As it warms the alcohol shows up a but the flavors really get stronger. This seems more refreshing despite the higher ABV, maybe its the lack of spiciness? In any case another interesting and worthwhile beer from Lost Abbey."
"Recommended, but not at the price I paid for it..."
"Worth seeking out to try, enjoyable, but not one I'd retain as a regular in the collection."
"Honey, honey, and more honey. I couldn't get over the floral honey stench that poured out of this glass. It was the flower, the honey, and the bee all in one, so to speak. The bee is the sting in the spice, which came with the nose and lingered on the tongue. Anyway, this beer poured a beautiful color out of the corked and caged Lost Abbey bottle which is adorned with some of the most ridiculous copy I've ever seen on a beer bottle -- but I loved it. This was a surprisingly complex and easy to drink Bière de Garde at 7% ABV and it really had everything you could ask for in an American version of a Belgian beer, a theme which dominated the tasting this bottle was a part of. Brews like this really get me going, when they which pour beautifully, feel great in the mouth, and have something expressive and interesting to say about a specific well-treaded style. Lost Abbey is a hell of a brewery."
"Thanks again, Joey!"
"T: Medium body with high carbonation and a very strong flavorful finish. Body has interesting combination of flavors like smell, balancing an earthy, slightly sour taste with a sweeter, honey like flavor. Not much hops present. Very refreshing on a beautiful spring day, but the finish is a little too strong and earthy for me to be more excited by this. As another review says, this starts as another saison at original serving temperature of 45 degrees but as this warms up, there is more a malt presence and a little more sweetness."
"I found this very refreshing and it really hit the spot on a cool spring day. I'd love to grab a few more of these."
"D: Definitely a bottle to share with good company. This could be the best Biere de Garde I have had yet. Like the saying goes, ""Port doesn't fall short"
"Solid, golden orange with a nice fluffy white head, not much retention or lacing on this one. Aromas of deep bready malts, with a slight funky barnyard backbone and very subdued hops. This malt machine is tasty and has a great blend of malt/yeast compelxity with a nice drying sweet/hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, carbonation is very smooth, drinkability remains good. Very, very French in it's stylings"
"Drinkability - Good for one glass but not something I could make a night out of. The alcohol taste is a little to much for me but if I wanted a glass to relax with I would be happy to drink this again."
"Drinkability is about right. I feel like the alcohol flavor makes it a little hard to quaff, but it's not too bad, especially for the style. The carbonation is nice but these two things in combination make this a semi-sipper."
"Overall: A very inviting farmhouse ale that would be great in the summer a real thirst quencher. Wouldn't know it was 7 % ABV. two thumbs up"
"The body is light to mid. Carbonation is a bit high but ok. Overall this is a good beer to drink but feels more of a Belgian Pale than Biere de Garde. Very easy to drink and nice flavors but is missing style. I wonder if I were to add the yeast/sediment in next time if that would make a difference."
"This beer does not get enough credit, best one of their year round releases I have tried, not a particular fan of this style and still very good, would definitely drink again, especially on tap in the tasting room next time I am down in San Marcos, recommended"
"Drinkability is good for this beer. It's not overpowering in any area and if you like this variety of the style. then you should have no problem with a bottle."
"This is a well balanced beer with a great mouthfeel and flavor. I think aged for a year or two would make this a terrific mellow beer."
"My first bière de garde was interesting, and Port/Lost Abbey lead the way. Now I wish I had apples growing in my back yard."
"All Lost Abbey beer is worth finding, though this one doesn't merit its own pilgrimage."
"Got another from bitterbill - thanks Bill!"
"I mean, tree ripened apples from my grandmother's old orchard, of course."
"D: I could have another."
"Pours a slightly fogged gold amber. Nose is like woody apples. Strong sweet tone is there too. Flavor is a tangy wood. Almost like this was aged in some type of wooden barrel. Feel is thick on carbonation and typical on liquid. Overall this is not really a favorite style of mine. Quite the opposite really. I can say without hesitation that it is one of my least. This one is pretty well made though and is even and consistent. If you can dig the style, give it a shot. For me though, I can't say I will try it again."
"Good mouthfeel and good drinkability, got super cloudy as the bottle went down from all the delicious yeast sediment. Some fruitiness did pop through in the taste around the middle of the first glass, but it was very fleeting and didn't seem to come back at all. Overall, a good beer, but not worth the price. I was really expecting a grand slam here--more like a single."
" good beer. almost worth 12 bucks."
"Enjoyed this week on the back porch, with our unusual 70 degree weather. Poured into an Allagash White glass. Bright orange color with a yellowish tint at the bottom. Gorgeous looking glass, with a pillowy three fingers of white foamy head. Aroma of dry biscuit, honey, wheat and with a faint touch of lemon zest. Refreshing taste of spice, light orange wheat & green apple. Dry, semi-hop finish. Highly enjoyable."
"Avant-garde: (noun) unorthodox or daring; radical. Even though this is good beer, The Lost Abbey/Port Brewing Company missed a golden opportunity to brew something truly special, something truly avant-garde, something deliciously daring. Instead, they've brewed something simplistic and safe. The fact that I'm still enjoying the result is a testament to Tomme's skill around a brew kettle."
"Not my favorite, but good."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, toasted malt scent that boasts of pale and victory malts. It's quite inviting with a slight yeast fruitiness. There is definately a bit of mustiness as well. The taste is decent. It has a very rich malt flavor that boasts of pale, Munich, and Victory malts. It goes down easy and finishes with a fruity yeast presence as well as a mild warming. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent drinking beer. I'm not sure this is my favorite style, but this one is pretty good."
"Purchased from Southbay Drugs and Liquors. Thanks, Joey!"
"D: I am generally not a big fan of the style, but this one has a nice malt base and funkiness that makes me look forward to each sip."
"Belgian bomber, caged and corked, no fresness info. Pours apricot, cloudy, gauzy eggshell head, leaving thick film, tiny bubble sheen and plenty of ringed and delicate lacing. The nose I pick up is minty, yeasty and fruity. Light peppery notes, yeasty goodness, nutty, caramel, complex, tasty, heady, another high class, BA worthy brew from Lost Abbey. The only problem I have with this brewery is that they do not distribute to NY state..."
"D: The alcohol is bigger then it should be, but a great flavor and a nice sipping beer. As I said, a very filling beer. Haven't had much experience with this style, but more complex and flavorful than the New Belgium Biere de Mars, in my opinion. This is a great beer to wind down a long day. A solid offering."
"Drinkability: Tasty and well balanced."
"Lost Abbey does a nice job for the style."
"Upon its departure from the 750ml cork and caged bottle it forms a nice crown of white over the golden amber body, with the resultant lace a thin covering upon the glass. The nose has a peach like aroma, backed by the malt, crisp and clean to the senses. Start is sweet; the malt adds nice bread like taste, with the top middling. Finish has a delectable hop presence with the acidity unobjectionable, nice and dry, a fine drinking beer"
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side while still having a nice creaminess to it. Ample carbonation, the beer goes down easily and is refreshing. Overall, this just doesn't match up with some of the better Biere de Garde's I've sampled. Doubt I'd seek this brew out again, but I look forward to sampling some of the other Lost Abbey brews."
"Pours a hazy orangey golden color with a massive frothy rocky head. Lacing left through the finish. Aroma is yeasty and malty with some fruitiness. A slight grassy hoppiness is noted. Tastes malty sweet up front with some nice fruity flavors balanced well with a slight hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is exactley what I like in a beer of this style. Smooth and easy drinking with the perfect amount of carbonation to balance and give it a nice bite. Overall this is another excellent beer from the Lost Abbey brewery. I think I'm starting to like this more than their Red Barn Ale. Hmmm... that's a tough one."
"Poured into a chalice a nice golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one finger creamy white head, which leaves some nice small islands and sticky lacing throught out the drink. The nose is malty, yeasty, and slightly spicy. The taste pretty much follows the nose. Medium body, a complex brew to an extent. Drinkable, this is a nice brew from LA/PB, recommended."
"D- This is definitely a unique style, but the acidic finish puts me off quite a bit (almost an aspirin-like quality), it is also has the look and smell of a lighter Belgian, but the taste and mouthfeel feels like a heavier beer, overall it lacks any unique qualities that would make me want to get another one in the future (especially given the other great LA offerings)"
"Very tasty and well done, but a challenge to do justice to in the description. I'll happily drink it again, and I encourage you to go try it for yourself!"
"I think this is my first Biere de Garde. A slightly hazy lighter golden orange color. When poured aggressively a shallow wispy white head fades in a flash. A lighter, yet interesting lacing pattern forms. As it warms up, the smell is a real kick. The complexity is challenging for me to place; sort of a sweet musty candied pear and banana, fruity yet earthy at the same time. The mouth opens with a tingle, but settles to a lighter almost watery texture as it warms up. The mild yeasty malt flavor is much less sweeter than the nose. A spicy peppery finish lingers nicely. A good drinker. Really glad that i had the opportunity to try this one. Scores points for imagination."
"Deep gold and slightly hazy, a thick cap of off-white soapy bubbles appeared after a hard pour. Sheets of sticky lace clung to the glass as the head slowly receded. Lemon zest and bread appeared first in the aroma, followed by notes of cereal, yeast, and ripe fruit. Most of the flavour was quite mild, a little bread and fruit, some lemon. But there was a strong, bitter clove character and alcohol warmth that overshadowed the rest and were quite distracting - the spicy bitterness lingered long into the finish all by itself too. Nice texture though, with a peppery tingle on the tongue and generous, airy carbonation. Not bad overall - I got used to the weirdness in the flavour after a while, maybe it just wasn't as prominent as it warmed. Either way, still worth a try."
"I absolutely adore this beer-complex, balanced and highly consumable."
"I like this beer. I have enjoyed everything I have tried from this brewery, and I would highly recommend any of them. I thought this beer was gorgeous. I poured a 750ml bottle into two tulip shaped glasses. It was a clear orange honey color with a thick white head that really stuck around. The body had very active bubbling, and the head left a nice bubbly lace behind. The aroma was pretty subtle with light roasted malts and slightly doughy yeast. The inital flavor was smooth and malty and qqickly evolved into a nice sour aftertaste that was mellow and a little fruity. The mouthfeel was light bodied with slightly creamy texture and a fizzy carbonation. This is a nice light summer ale with very good flavor and great appearance. It pairs nicely with simple foods like buttered bread or a selection of cheeses."
"I'll be honest, I love Pizza Port beers, I loved the Lost & Found Ale and I quite enjoyed the Red Barn Ale, but this one leaves me disappointed. Not really sure why, to be honest, but it just doesn't grab me. Maybe I need to try another day and see if it an off batch or it's me."
"Thanks, ppoitras, for the experience"
"Bottle: Poured a medium yellow color ale with a big foamy white head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of medium sweet malt with a distinctive yeast presence. Taste is dominated by medium sweet malt with some bread and yeast notes and a slightly dry finish. Body is about average with some great carbonation. Interesting but lacking some character to make this truly interesting and I cannot see this beer aging well."
"A very fine beer indeed...."
"Drinkability- With the belly warmth and accompanying fuzziness about the limbs, I'm quite surprised this beer weighs in at only 7%. I'm glad to have tried this obscure brew from the West Coast, however it won't leave any lasting impression."
"Overall, pretty good but did not live up to my higher expectations."
"4 / 2.5 / 3.5 / 4 / 3"
"Drinkability: There were times where AndoBrew and I thought ""What did we get ourselves into? This is never going to come together!!"" But when those wonderful smells start coming from the beer, when the flavors begin the meld, when the obscenities start flying, and the smiles start shining, we knew that it was all worth it."
"This beer didn't really make a huge impact on me. It was very good, but pretty even all the way around. Nothing in particular really jumped out at me, except for maybe the color which I liked. It is a deep gold color almost bordering on orange. A sunset gold color. There was a faint earth and citrus aroma but nothing really pronounced. There was no head to speak of nor lacing on the glass. Not unlike its aroma, it has an earthy, ripe sweetness and a palatteable breadiness that makes the beer very even in taste and body. It has a nice heft in body, but is still very easy to drink and the tastes help make it very refreshing. Without a doubt, a very good, sublte example of the style, but not a beer that overwhelmed me."
" I have taken the advice on the label and paired this with a Granny Smith apple, some French Bread(bad imitation), and Port Salud cheese. It makes a nice ploughman's lunch at 2:45 AM, which is dinner for me after closing the bar."
"Pours a hazy peach, light copper with a small white head. Aroma is some honey sweetness mixed with lemons, some sweet and tart apple along with a grassiness. Very subtle and soft sweetness up front in the taste, some lemon and tartness mid taste mix with a peppery and grassy finish. Also some graininess in the taste with some apple and alcohol in the finish and aftertaste. Light to medium body finishes crisply. A refreshing beer that would be great for a picnic in the spring."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer and highly recommended!"
"750ml bottle: Im happy to see some of their beers making it to the east coast now. This one pours a dark, clear golden color with only a small, non-lasting head. The aroma is pleasant. Some yeastiness, spices and apples. Taste has notes of malt, apples and spice. Tastes somewhat sweet, yet with a dry finish. This is nice."
"750 ml. bottle. - color of pale gold , with a frothy white head - nose of sour apple (green) , yeast , anise , malt , citrus (orange peel), grass , spices , and slight candied (pears or apricots ) taste of sour grass , chalky , cobwebs , candied orange , honey , alcohol , and cloves - body is dry , well carbonated , but creamy  aftertaste of honey , yeast , and dry"
"Drinkability- Really nice brew with some interesting qualities. Worth a try."
"Honey gold with a thick parchment cap topped with big bubbles. Slowly settling to a thin skim, dots of lace a left behind. Swirling, fast moving columns of fine bubbled carbonation break the surface. The aromas are of bread dough, green apples, honey, cracked peppercorns, and Anjou pears. The flavor of warm white bread drizzled with honey opens up into sweet apple and pear flesh. Plenty of peppery spice works itself through the finish. There is a fair amount of fruit sweetness as well as a bit of lemon pith which arrives at the tail end. As it warms a bit of alcohol becomes noticeable. Medium body with an initially tingle carbonation, this calms down to become almost still. This became a bit monotonous during consumption, and it seemed to be missing some spark."
"Interesting...definitely an American take on the style."
"Overall, a good beer that's very agressive with it's flavor profile in comparison to a classical BdG. Not bad, just different and it would be better with a drier finish."
"It came down between this and a Saison I really like at the store, but since I have not tried this style yet, I thought it might be good to try something new. The look of this beer was very impressive, with a hazed orange color, and a perfect looking white head. Smell did not reveal too much, though I suspect it might have been because it was sitting in the fridge for quite a while. Smells I did pick up were pepper, yeast, and some interesting funk you might find in a Saison. Taste was a big improvement. It starts off crisp and somewhat bitter, then ends slightly fruity, with the yeasty funk still present. It also displayed some dry champaign character in it's overall taste. I was also somewhat surprised that it was sort of syrupy. I was expecting something much more on the light side. I want to drink this beer all night...I should have bought two bottles. This was a real treat, and a great introduction to this interesting style. Great art work on the label as well. Well done."
"This offering from Lost Abbey pours a foggy orange with tiny carbonation bubble leaving a strong brown eggshell head on top of this beauty. The aroma is yeasty, fruity, dough, hay and grass. The taste starts sharp tart and lovely with enough sweetness to balance that bitter tartness upfront. The alcohal is warming and in control in this one. Followed by a bitter herbal hoppy and grass notes, hay, lemon grass, orange, citrus rind tarness, refreshing high carbonation make this finish fantastic and one helluva beer."
"A lacey beer on tap at Port Carlsblad. Darker than the blond colour described., with a white head. A barleywine like taste, well malted sweeter than expected mid-sip, with a dash of peach fruit juice, that finishes lemon and sour. A sure cross-styler that does not taste like most other biere de garde"
"Sampled at the Monk's Cafe Lost Abbey beer dinner. The beer poured a golden color with a slightly hazy body and a medium white ring around the glass. The aroma was of sweet tarts and a bit earthy. The taste had more of the sweet tart quality and a wheaty character to it with a touch of bitterness on the back end, making for a medium body and easy drinking beer."
"750 ml bottle. Aroma is bready and grassy with lots of floral and citric notes. The body is dull golden color and holds a diminishing thumb thick white head. Fore is bitter and herbal-like with some dry fruit notes and a green herbal-bitter finish reminiscent of the fore flavor, but even more concentrated. Seems to lack appropriate carbonation level as well."
"Thanks to boolshot and Marvz and the Double Trouble BIF for the enlightenment."
"Received in a trade from BA dogfoodog, this 750 ml. brown bomber came corked, and caged. The uncorking went smoothly, and the beer was poured out into goblet, where it sat golden pale in color, clear, and mildly but steadily carbonated. The steady streamers formed a thin head that refused to go away. The floral and hay aroma was delicate and gave subtle hints of orange peel, and an occasion whiff of earthy yeast. The taste was sweeter than I was expecting, with a toasted maltyness similar to an American Amber Ale. Spices were too light to provide a lot of balance, and there was no hop presence, so the malt pretty much dominated the palate. It had a medium thick body and felt soft in the mouth, and was quite soothing. A good beer to have in autumn, as the back side label seems to suggest."
"Had at Toronado in S.F. from their bottle selection. For a beer as hard to find in Northern California at a bar, it was very reasonably priced. Around $9.00 for a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Looks like your average Biere de Garde, pale amber in color with a good sized head pouring from bottle. Fragrent odor of citrus, a very nice yeasty taste and silky moutfeel. This went down smooth despite the 7% abv. But maybe that was because I was about 3 pints deep of Pliny the Elder. A very good beer. Nothing I would seek out terribly hard and not Port's best effort. But a very good beer. I don't think they make anything that isn't."
"A nice beer but not really a great one. Very mild mannered and lightly flavored this would go well with more subtle food flavors like fruit and salad."
"D- It is a very drinkable beer. I wouldn't say its one of my favorite but if it was cheaper this would be a great beer to have when just in the mood for a nice refreshing beer. I could see this going well with most foods also. Since it is on the lighter side but the flavors do come out nicely. It's not a weak flavored beer."
"Poured in a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" white head over the clear golden amber brew. Head lis quickly down to a layer of bubbles, with minimal lacing. Nose is sedate, but interesting with slightly spicy malt and lightly flowery hops. Taste starts with a biscuity maltiness upfront, comes on a bit fruity and alcoholic in the middle, and closes with light bitterness and lingering spices. Mouthfeel is quite bubbly for such a minimally frothed brew, and this brew is quite drinkable. And quite tasty."
"Notes: For the price I'll have to pass on this in the future. Is it good? you bet. At the end of the day though this is average even when considering within the style."
"pretty good drinkabilty, i guess my only gripe is that it's very subdued. certainly not bad, but open the bottle knowing that it's a delicate beer thats going to do the opposite of bowl you over with flavor, you have to hunt for it a bit."
"Taste has a buttery-like aspect, somewhat hard to explain. Fruity and very yeasty. sort of had the rustic taste of a saison. strong banana taste in there along with some other ripe fruits. easy on the mouth, went down quickly and didn't resonate very long on the palate. sort of hits you up front but has nothing to back it up. light-bodied and highly drinkable."
"Drinkability  This one went down well enough. It has all the right components but is a bit too in your face for the style."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Drinkability: This isn't the most spectacular beer, but it's a biere de garde and it's pretty damn tasty. It's nice to see another brewer making this lesser-known style. I can't wait to try more offerings from Lost Abbey and Co."
"D: Didn't like this beer much but as it warmed, it grew on me. Still, I'd imagine its Lost Abbey's weakest offering."
"Last swigs: Clean Bière de Garde that leaves a slick buttery hint. Worth a shot if you can get your hands on a bottle."
"It poured a gold-amber color with mdeium head that dissipated quickly, but the lacing was impressive. The aroma is flan-like; almost a creme brulee subtle sweetness. Quite nice. Tasting it mirrored this with some Belgian tasting yeast and hop presence. I was impressed with the amount of flavor that was achieved without upping the sweetness factor. It was very easy drinking and went well with the Spanish salami-like meat the missus was serving."
"Overall: A great start but I have to be honest and say that this was not as good as I expected. Despite its unquestioned pedigree, I dont think this is the Bees Knees, just yet at least, but the whole Lost Abbey arm of Port Brewing is a very welcome development in sunny SoCal and it can only get better and yield more high quality offerings. That said, with a cool head, removing the Port brewing accolades and with an unemotional stance mixed with a candid reflection, I am not sure I would splash the beans for this one again. Even if it would have had a keener price, I feel a bit let down overall."
"Overall: This beer is great. I will befinately be buying this one by the case."
"(750 ml brown wine-like bottle, corked and caged)"
"This is the first I've tried from the ""Lost Abbey"" and it's a sure sign of great things too come from them. Cheers!"
"Note: Michael Jackson's beer of the month, and I believe this is the first of Pizza Port's new line of Belgian style beers. Truthfully, I have to say that I'm a bit let down."
