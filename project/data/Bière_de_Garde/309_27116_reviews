"Overall a very fine, traditional example of a hard to fine style."

"Glad I found this beauty, we don't a lot of variety in this space in Australia. Dan Murphys has started stocking it alongside the regulars like La Chouffe and Chimay. It's replaced La Chouffe for me if presented the choice ( and I LOVE La Chouffe )"

"O: Good drinkability. Good beer"
""
""
""
"Overall: a very nicely put together beer - orchard fruits and spice, toasted malt and the honey is a very nice touch. Not a terrible price either, at AU$105 for 12 x 750mL."
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Blanquette de Veau with lyonnaise potatoes, or Pavés du Mail would be a nice pairing, the creaminess of their sauces countering the cloying sweetness whilst keeping with the French theme of this brew."
""
"Not too bad, I really enjoyed the sweetness but it may be too much for some. I might feel a bit different once I get towards the end of the bottle..."
""
""
"O- Not a bad beer but a little too sweet for my liking. Could only just finish the one. Gets rather sickly after a while."
"Overly sweet beer with low complexity, not really pleasant after warming up. I kept lowering its grade. Definitely overrated."
""
""
""
"O: The hop bitterness and flavor comes on a bit stronger than in other examples of the style, but is still never in any danger of usurping the malt character. In fact, the flaw of this beer may be that the body is a little more weighty and dextrinous than it should be, and this makes it less drinkable."

"A bit too sweet and lacking in complexity, and the texture is a let-down, too. The basic flavors and aromas are nice, but the aforementioned faults make this a tepid recommendation at best."

"definitely worth checking out!"

"This poured out as a very nice clear orange color with a thin white head on top. The head fades quickly, no retention or lacing. The smell of the beer is sweet smelling with some grain aromas. Maybe a hint of honey on the nose too. The taste is sweet, caramel and honey-like flavors with minimal hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is light, a little watery, some moderate carbonation and drinkable. Overall is starts out sweet with a dry finish, it's a. Good brew but nothing something I would rave about."
"750 ml that's been sitting in the cellar(hall closet) for 6 mos. or so...sweet and brown,amber maltiness...very slight booziness in the aroma and taste but it's not hot...the sweetness lingers and makes me take another taste because it is pleasant...decent head after a fast pour...subsequent pours yield a thin head with some lacing...initial taste showed standard carbonation...wanted a Euro biere de garde after drlinking Two Bros. Domaine Du Page, which isn,t too far off...overall has a taste up my alley and one that I'll revisit soon"

"O: I liked this beer very much and would highly recommend it."

"Very sweet but perfect for those cold winter days when a something stronger or darker might feel like overkill. Highly enjoyed this beer if only for the fact that it has a taste one can enjoy without waiting for an ""occasion"" to do so, versatile and tasty."

"A bit sweeter than I normally like, but a great farmhouse ale. Used to drink it frequently when I worked in Burgundy. It has a sweet aftertaste and the mouthfeel is a little like cotton candy (not in a bad way). A little pungent to the nose, but a rich, like chestnut color. I scored the overall a high 4.5 because it's a great experiance if you like the sweeter ones - normally I don't, but this one is an exception."
"Malt forward, but not totally to style: too sweet and fruity for a Biere de Garde. A light, easy drinker, though - and probably pairs well with all sorts of food, which is the point, I suspect."
"D ~ I really enjoyed this. Having had the Jenlain Blonde an hour before, I discovered that this is the superior beer. Nose was better, feel was more cohesive, & flavors were better executed."
"jd"
"Dr: The high ABV is pretty well concealed, and she drinks easy enough. The price is good by French standards, but the quality just isn't there. A good beer for a night in with the lads, but not a good beer for a proper tasting."
"D - Good smooth flavor; easy drink; I would have another"
"Doesn't seem to have any off flavors or hint of spoilage, so I totally don't get this beverage."
"The real question is... when will Beeradvocate stop running irrelevant ads?"
"Watery and weak for the style. I'll not be getting this again."
"Flavour - Very subtle; each sip drew me back for another taste of its elusive layered malt and subtle nole hops presence."
"Overall: Way too sweet without any significant complexity; can't recommend this one"
"D: Way too much iron-copper metal flavor. Maybe a bad bottle."
"O: This is okay; I'm not too familiar with the style but this is enjoyable."
"It has a good mouthfeel, and is very light-bodied. The finish is medium-dry, and I have a feeling I`ll be able to get through the rest of this 75cl quite easily."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the surprisingly fruity aroma, with the contrasting alcohol kick at the very finish. While the abv is not apparent throughout most of the taste, it comes in full force in the end with that nice peppery burn. This was in wonderful contrast to the sweetness presented in both the nose and in the taste, making for a nicely balanced brew, all around."
"Very solid, clean beer. Enjoyed it."
"I need to visit this one again if I get the chance to get some more deatiled notes. Overall the group consensus was this was a respectable example fo the style, I just need to try a few more before I can make a more objective judgement."
"Highly underrated."
"250ml bottle, poured into leffe chalice. 3rd of a finger head, dark orange copper colour, clear. Smells a bit like an ESB. Can taste marzipan and malty caramel. You know the abv is there, medium mouthfull. I could drink a few but wouldn't want too many."
"D: Any traces of alcohol are completely hidden from the smell and taste. I would definitely try this again and pair it with food such as pork chops."
"Pours a golden copper with a nice white head and some good lace. Nose is fairly tame, but has nice characteristics of light fruit, toffee, nuts, and a dash of earthiness. Taste is mildly sweet and fruity. A bit of soil in there. Feel is light and rewarding. A mellow, well integrated beer that is one of the better Biere de Gardes that I have tried."
"This umber brew gives just a trace of thin white head that's gone immediately. Smell is also pretty mild, just a faint dark sweetness. Taste is a fruity plum-like sweetness, a bit of yeast, earthy but clean and crisp. Feel is mostly flat and medium bodied. I have no idea what to expect from this style, but it's pretty interesting."
"Overall, a nicely drinkable, multi-faceted ale. Well balanced, even reserved, but solid nonetheless."
"D: If you're in the mood for a sweet beer, this really hits the spot. I had this on a hot night in Paris, and it went down well."
"I had this bottle in my cellar for quite a while (actually beyond the so called expiry date), but it still tastes fresh and crispy ... the brew has a sort of 'artisanal touch', everything somewhat looks 'handmade': starting with the bottle, the muddy appearance and a not very elegant balance .... actually to my surprise even though this brew is rather tweedy, it's great pleasure drinking it ... caramelized toffees paired with vanilla, anisette and pineapple - sounds rather 'exotic', and perhaps is but for sure worth a try ... if only they could work on the slightly unpleasant sticky bitter-sweet aftertaste ...."
"The beer is slightly prickly on the tongue and quite refreshing but overall fails to impress."
"D: This beer is an easy sipper. Good but not great but ultimately, it's worth trying."
"This was a welcome treat, much more flavor than expected. This will be a more regular purchase."
"It's malty and floury. I'm not a pro, so all I can say is it has a very complex array of flavors. The malt hits strong. There's a kind of tree-bark aftertaste. Almost port-wineish in a way."
"Mouthfeel is fairly thick and creamy. Excellent drinkability."
"Beer is sweet, malt bomb alert. I like it. Beer is overall mild, there is some fruity character, like sweet berries or apples, in the midpalate of the beer. Drinkability is really high, mouthfeel is moderate. Beer is medium bodied, not sure what I expected, overall its a clean and simple beer. I should seek out more Biere de Garde."
"D: Solid across the board. Quite enjoyable."
"Overall a tasty beer. Complex."
"Nice enough, nothing too complex, but not bad at all."
"D - This is a nice Belgian style ale. It has a nice balance of spice and sweet."
"D-I'm pretty sure this is the best beer I've ever had out of a 50 cL can. It is not complex, but it is just plain good."
"I wouldn't drink too much of this. It isn't worth revisiting."
"Edit: after reading some other reveiws, it seems as though my opinions were not that far off from the lower end of the spectrum. Perhaps the beer is just an overall failure. The guy at the store is still a jerk, though."
"An enjoyable beer from Jenlain. Quite sessionable for almost-8%."
"Brilliant clear caramel body, thin white head. Earthy grass, tree bark, and hoppy notes in the aroma. Rich caramel malt sits atop an underlying earthy notes. Simple, but oh so good. Smooth, full bodied, but still very refreshing. Seems like a big, earthy, easy drinking amber, not like any Biere de Garde I have sampled. I loved this beer."
"this ain't too bad. just avoid the blonde at all costs."
"Pours a lovely clear orange-ish colour. The orange is so strong that it makes the head looks brownish. Subtle nose of toasted malt, caramel and licorice, and a mild but agreeable phenol and a promise of complexity which it delivers in a strong spicy taste and aftertaste. Surprisingly strong carbonation in the mouth. Agreeable and long-lasting aftertaste."
"Full coating mouthfeel, light carbonation, with a slight alcohol burn in the finish. It's not overwhelming, though, still quite drinkable."
"If you like barlewines, go for it, but this misses the mark in terms of earthiness and must and dank and all that cobwebby crap that I love in the style."
"Poured from a 500ml can into a standard pint glass. Beautiful clear copper color with orange hues, bubbles persistently rising from the bottom of the glass with a small (2-finger) off-white head that dissipated but left a slight lacing. Aroma was malty and musty. There was a 'dampness' to the smell that was hard to place; very slight hint of dried fruit, but this was very faint. Flavor was bready with biscuit notes and some yeast character. Very little to no hop presence - definitely a focus on the malt. As the beer warmed, there seemed to be some alcohol warming, somewhat revealing the beer's 7.5%. Medium-light body, effervescent to bubbly on the tongue. Overall, not my favorite style of beer, but shows as a good example of a Biere de Garde. Recommend, especially if you favor malty brews."
"11.2 oz. bottle with no freshness date, unpasteurized, brewed with three malts (including torrified wheat) from Champagne and hops from Alsace; aged for one month before bottling. It pours a sediment-laden orangey amber, with low carbonation, and three fingers of light beige head, receding quickly to a clingy 1/8"" froth that never goes away. Toasted and biscuity malts in the nose, sweet, with notes of caramel, chocolate?, molasses?, a light fruitiness, earthy hops and an acidic twang. It has a complex malt flavor that is nutty/earthy, with caramel and lots of sweetness. Spicy and floral hops cut right through the middle, contributing little bitterness but loads of flavor. There is also a touch of sourness, with fruity esters that lend prunes, white grapes and overripe apples. It has low carbonation, but what is there is fine-bubbled, and helps the beer go down smoothly. Lightly tingly, dry, with a medium malty finish. There is an interesting drinkability - it went down very quickly, but it has a little too much sweetness for prolonged drinking. I tried this one fresh in France, and it was pretty different; tastes like it has aged a bit, but has done so gracefully. I enjoyed this beer very much - it's complex and tasty with no trace of the alcohol, and would complement almost any meal nicely. Definitely worth a try, whether fresh or lightly-aged."
"Overall, quite good."
"Soft drinkable brew."
"D - Good."
"75cL bottle. Dark, hazy amber with a medium pale yellow head. The foam dissipates to a solid half-finger cap, leaving some nice lacing behind. No sediment. Smells of sweet, honey-like malt and barnyard yeast, along with some citric tang; slightly earthy towards the end. The earthiness becomes much stronger on the taste, with toasted malts really taking over. There's a distinct lack of the expected funk. Sweet finish, though a hint of hop bitterness is detectable. Thick feel, but carbonation is a bit lacking. Kind of disappointed in this one."
"One I would be interested in having again, enjoyable beer."
"all in all, an interesting take on a bière de garde that almost hints at an english barleywine. The earthiness is there, the french and the funk isn't quite what i was anticipating, but I'm certainly enjoying this one as I sip on it. Rich and complex flavor profile. Definitely will consider revisiting again."
"d) Ends up more EPA in flavour profile from my angle. Malty characters in the forefront. Quite drinkable, but nothing particularly outstanding."
"D: Definitely different. Seems a nice take on a style I'd never had before. Worth a revisit when the mood is right."
"6/4/7/4/12 (3.3/5)"
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. There is a light nuttiness as well as a subtle cellarlike aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a sweet malty flavor that boasts mostly of crystal malts. It goes down real easy even at 7.5%. There is a slight hop presence, but nothing to pronounced. It's clean in the finish with no esters to speak of. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great example of the style. I just read Farmhouse Ales and they said this is one of the original Biere de Garde beers. I really enjoyed it. Recommended!"
"Pours hazy amber with a good size head and plentiful lacings. Sweet aroma. Taste is like an amber with lots of alcohol. Sweet malts with a minor amount of hops. Mouthfeel is good for the style. Sessionable? Too much alcohol to be sessionable. If you like powerfull beers and are O.K. with a sweet brew give this a try."
"mouthfeel ok - but the flavor is tough to drink too many of these."
"D: A classic biere de garde, I liked this one a lot, definitely has a raw, rustic feel to it, and it is endlessely drinkable until you get pissed, will buy this one again and again."
"A nice, very drinkable, well-balanced, classic interpretation of a Biere de Garde."
"Pours a very nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, very nice creamy off-white thick creamy head, with some small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is slightly malty, very slight yeast, with some caramel and spices. The taste is malty, slightly yeasty, woody, with some nice caramel notes. Light-medium body, very tasty, subtle, the alochol is very well hidden. Very drinkable, very different kind of Biere de Garde, very tasty though."
"D - Great drinkability, especially if paired with rustic fare or french wash-rind cheese."
"Mouthfeel is just fine although I'm a bit let down by the brew. I love a good Biere de Mars yet this doesn't say ""winter's end"" to me. Finishing dryness helps the drinkability but not by much."
"Overall this is okay, but not the ultimate Belgian beer I've been searching for."
"D: Bit too spicy for my pallet but a good creation."
"Popped the cork off a 25oz. champagne bottle with a bottling date of 20/09/2008. A nice pop greeted my ears. Pours a nice clear copper color with some serious carbonation. A nice head that settles to a decent ring. Smells of a very slight skunkiness(thank you green bottle!), nutty caramel malts, and subtle spicey hops. Light mouthfeel. Nutty malts mingle well with a multi layered hop spiciness. A very well balanced beer. The best French beer I've had to date. Worth checking out."
"D - This is a great beer, thanks to importation, a well crafted beer for the Belgium and Biere de garde lovers."
"Pours out an, essentially, still orangey-amber body with a thinnish head that reduces quickly. Leaves some here-and-there lacing. Smells of big caramel, toffee, sweet malts, toasted malts, and a touch of herbal and earthy hops. The intense caramel/toffee doesn't come off AS much in the flavor, but it is there. There is also more of a nuttiness and a toasty punch toward the finish, accompanied by some more pungent herbal hop. I get also a tad of orange in the aftertaste. Little bit of alcohol is perceived, but works well to balance some of this sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of a sticky feel. Bubbles could relax a little more for my taste. Solid drinker and a solid overall biere de garde."
"D: A good solid brew, with a warm fruity character, big caramel palate and very dry finish with a velvety finish. Malty and very enjoyable."
"Pours a clear amber with a nice sized crème head. Nose is nutty and woody. Flavor is smooth with a slight woody tone to it. Touch of sweetness there, but not overdone at all. Its just a touch. Feel is good. The right level of bubble on the tongue and a smooth liquid experience. Highly drinkable and very much worth trying."
"The Ambree was truly excellent with Thanksgiving Dinner -- and what I especially appreciate, it was equally good with the main course and the dessert: it paired faultlessly with the turkey & dressing, gravy, veggie casseroles, and sweet potatoes, and then turned around and sang in harmony with the pumpkin pie, pecan pie, and apple crisp! Vive la biere francaise!"
"This is an enjoyable beer. Wouldn't make it a regular in the fridge, but will definitely purchase again if the occasion arises."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall- A beer I'd have again. It has the flavor of a nightcap beer without the overwhelming alcohol effect."
"Review translated from french 5-27-2008."
"No idea how old this one is. It came from Wine World in Penascola several months ago."
"Drinkability: I could be blunt and caustic here, but hey, it's Friday!"
"D - fix the nose and this was a very enjoyable beer. As I experienced it only average."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked & caged bottle. The color is a redish brown with plenty of suspended yeast floaters. The head was very dissappointing, no lace, no cap. The smell is sugary raisin bread and honey. The taste is of raisin bread, carob, sugary with a bit of an alcohol burn. No hops detected, nothing that I would describe as earthy to help counter act the sweetness. The feel is flat and slicky, almost syrupy. The smell and taste aren't bad, but this sample seems to be old and flat, which brings out the sugary characteristics of the brew."
"Drinkability - This was a good beer. And that was with a cold so I couldn't get the best experience from it."
"ooh, it's sweet. and really not what what fits my criteria for ""farmhouse ale"". hoppy flavors, and plenty of fruitinessthe sweet, red kind. the finish boasts some more sophisticated hints: oak or vinousocity"
"Poured a dense coffee froth colored head that fades slowly and left rings of lace. Sweet aroma is a mix of caramel, wheat, and lemon grass. It tastes like a mix of caramel and spring flowers with a dash of lemon zest. The don't exactly blend together, but they are complimentary. Towards the finish a mild bitterness and a dash of alcohol kick in and cut the sweetness. Averagely full body with light carbonation makes for a soft beer. An interesting beer that was well worth the 2.10 euro I paid for it in downtown Paris."
"Its appearance was pretty good, with an amber color with a macro-looking head composed of tiny uniformly sized bubbles. It didn't smell like anything. Flavor was very malty sweet, and a bit unpleasant."
"Aromas and appearances were deceptively misleading, as this beer has the heart of a brown ale! Creamy mouthfeel is coupled with intense nutty/sweet malts indicative of the best brown ales. Finish is sweet and nutty as well, though tempered somewhat by a touch of herbaceousness to balance things out. Alcohol is masked entirely, which is surprising considering its strength. An all around enjoyable, easy to drink beer."
"Taste is more aggressive than the smell with sweet malts taking the center stage. They get toasty towards the end with a mild biting hop character tidying things up. Sugared fruits and spicy yeast accompany this one on its way. Mouthfeel is a little slick and sweet, but is nicely carbonated and medium bodied. Fits the style. I'd get this one again as it was just shy over 4.50 for the 750ml."
"This is a simple, refreshing, and smart beer with an understated elegance thats easy to cozy to. Youve heard of comfort food. This is like comfort beer; gently sweet with relaxed properties. Recommended."
"Overall, nice to have once and a while. but the flavor isnt something i would enjoy. many others within the style that i prefer."
"Had a bottle at Boneyard Bistro in Studio City. The appearance was a muddy red, with very little head. What head there was disappeared entirely after only a couple of minutes. The aroma was non-descript, vaguely malty and a little metallic. Taste was better, offering a touch of plum. Palate was nice, smooth but unremarkable, and drinkability was in the ""ahhh, what the hell"" category. Not bad, but not sure if I'll be trying it again."
"An OK beer, but not one I would visit again."
"M&D - thinner body than i expected, but not bad mouthfeel, nice blend and balance, a nice french ale, not amazing but good"
"Pours a clear tawny copper brown with a 1""+ light tan head with good retention and showy Belgian lace. Sweet malts and Belgium cellarlike musty, woodsy aroma that almost become caramel like with warming. Little evidence of hops. The flavors of floral spicey contentental hops are subdued by the soft water profile of this style and a dominate sweet but complex maltyness that quickly looses the sweetness and finishes med-dry with higher alcohol and a almost balance of hop IBUs. Medium body and higher carbonation yield a creamy mouthfel with some warmth from alcohols otherwise well hidden by the malts (Vienna,Munich blended with Pale and possibly some crystal type malts) An extended lagering of the artisanal farmhouse ales helps produce this fairly strong malty character as the lighter hopping fades with longer aginging. Fermented on the lower range of yeast temperatures makes this a great entry level to the higher ABV Belgian styles. IMHO more fit for winter season than Bier de Mars (a similar style)"
"Taste is sweet and doused in alcohol with spices and surprising heft to the mouthfeel. Aftertaste leaves you wanting more although there isn't one thing in the flavor that really hits me as being outstanding. A solid pick up if looking for a ""starter"" Belgian before going in for the heavy duty stuff."
"BB 28-06-2007. Some head and clear dark amber beer. Nose is caramellic malty, fruity and some eau de cologne note. After a while an aple juice arome comes up and oxidation is more noticable. Not bad at all though but again like other Duyck beers quiet decent but low dosed, Taste is quiet alcoholic but has some caramel malts aswel as decent bitterness in aftertaste. Alcohol quiet dominant though witch is also making mouthfeel unbalanced and fuelled. Low carbonisation also not really fitting brew. Drinkable beer."
"Pretty tasty stuff...would like it better with a little more carbonation."
"Overall, this beer is decent. Not something I would go out of my way for."
"I don't have a whole lot else to say about Jenlain French Farmhouse Ale. It isn't true to the stated style and isn't even that good regardless of style. I know that the French are capable of brewing great saisons and bieres de garde because I've tasted them. This one isn't anywhere close to proving that statement correct."
"Decent amber color, white head, trace amounts of lacing. Slightly sour, green apples, cherries, and maybe even some strawberry. Taste is of nice sweet caramel, with some very subtle fruit undertones. Higher carbonation, heavier side of medium bodied. Pretty good beer, I don't know that I'd get this often but I'm sure there are plenty of occasions in which it would work quite well."
"Moderate mouth with just enough carbonation. I would like to try this again and see what it pairs best with."
"Recommended for a time when you just want something tasty, not too complex, especially if you want a break from hop monsters."
"Mouth: Cool mouthfeel with a lightly fizzy and stinging carbonation. Flavors of hay, toffee, earthy minerals. Sweet up front and more sour in the back and aftertaste, a warm alcohol exhale and no hop bitterness."
"Funny, I had this on Thanksgiving and I don't remember it being anything like this. Malty, dry, and earthy. Easy drinking though the notion of alcohol finishes each sip. Definately something to pair with a meal."
"It's good enough to try later, but not enough to freak out and look for the freshest bottle possible, but if by chance I find it it may be mine."
"This would be a good summer ale with a picnic...and some air."
"This is probably one that is much better whenst paired with food. As a stand alone beer this doesn't work too well for me."
"Clear, deep ruby color, no head, no lacing. Smells earthy, ginger. Tastes earthy as well, hoppy, gingery. Interesting. Mouthfeel is slick, oily, wet. Fairly drinkable, but seems more alcoholic than it actually is. I'm on the fence on this guy- I like it but I don't. Worth a try."
"In the aftertaste again frsh hay, with a good dry finish."
"Clear amber with a short cap of off-white head. Bit of lace and fair retention. The aroma starts with sulfury hops, but these quickly dissipated. What remained was a grainy malt sweetness that was just short of caramel and mild floral/spicy hops. Mild flavour with some caramel and brown sugar sweetness. Floral/spicy hop flavour and bitterness follow through into the finish. Medium/high carbonation with a lightish body and slight slickness. Not bad, though I much preferred the flavour to the aroma, though it did improve with a bit of time out of the bottle. Thanks Wintermute!"
"Tropical fruit and a hint of chocolate appear on the lose of this medium gold-copper brew. There's raisin and clean, fruity notes on the palate along with sweet malt. The proper bitterness imparts a near perfect balance! This marvelously easy drinker is crisp, clean, and refreshing! Superb!"
"Drinkability: Meh. It's certainly not offensive, but instead of straddling the fence, I'd rather drink a nice Brtish mild or a full-on saison. Maybe this is why they waited so long."
"500 ml can, bought in France. ABV is 7.5%. Deep amber colour, nearly clear. Large off-white head. Pleasant malty aroma with notes of aromatic hops, leather and oak. Malty and oaky flavour with tolerable hops, notes of toffee and caramel. Not bad at all for a canned beer!"
"Overall - An excellent beer, very drinkable. Recommended !!"
"High in drinkability due to the lightness of the body and the good flavor... (I just wish it were heavier...)"
"D- This beer has interesting qualities that remind me of a really good fresh kolsch but it also has some more depth and complexity in the malt. I guess there is a faint ""cellar"" taste that sets it off but it is not really a distinct flavor."
"This beer should be commended on its combination of lean body with an abundance of complexity and flavornot an easy feat. This is a bit leaner bodied and less sweet than some of the other biere de garde Ive had the pleasure of drinking. While I my own malt cravings would prefer a bit more malty sweetness in this one, its leaner body makes it refreshing and an excellent accompaniment to a meal."
"Overall worth a shot if you can find it."
"Poured a brilliant amber/orange hue with a foamy head that collapsed quickly. The aroma was that of sweet malt with notes of oak, chardonnay, and cider. The beer had a medium/heavy mouthfeel and the maltiness was reasonably sweet - along the lines of a Marzen. After the main malt rush comes some nuttiness with a slight alcohol warmth. The noble hops help balance things out, but definitely take a back seat to the sweet malts used. The carbonation was fine and tight. Rich in flavor, but very drinkable."
"My first beer of my trip to beer hell (Rural Southern France) and also my first Biere de Garde. Surprisingly this readily available treat isnt half bad. Still its nothing to write home about. Rich amber color on the orange side. Thin white head that disappears immediately. Relatively bland. Sweetish with light caramel malts. Silky. Little to no hops are found in this. There is a faint odor of fermented fruits. Nothing particularly special going on here."
"I highly recommend this beer and I would say it is very drinkable."
"Pours a crystal clear dark amber with a finger of bubbly head. Nose is subtle grassy tones with hints of apple skin. Taste continues with light grassy and overripe apple juice notes above a caramel malt base. Mouthfeel is clean amd crisp, but overall lacking. This beer reminded me of Viking's Honey Moon braggot, which I couldn't finish. I was able to finish this one, but it didn't quite sit well with me. It was refreshing, but not tasty enough for me to want another. I'd like to see what some other biere de gardes taste like before I write the style off however."
"Taste: Low carbonation that gives the malt all the room to shine, the yeast isn't the cleanest but but it's mellow, and with that subdued corky flavor (a bit more and I wouldn't have liked it), it reminds me more of an old ale, one with a little extra spice, but aged to perfection."
"Excellent example of a style I didnt think I liked!"
"D - This is a great beer!!! Great to sip after dinner while unwinding."
"Full, rich mouthfeel with supple carbonation. Two bottles of Jenlain, some nice, crusty bread, brie and your secial other would make a perfect romantic spring picnic."
"First sip reveals an average body with fine carbonation. Flavor is sweet with some lite fruit hits aof green apple and then caramel again. Some biscuity yeast comes through and a faint white grape presence as well. THe finish is tasty and clean. I expected a little less structure to thebeer with more funk and off beat flavors. But I still did enjoy the beer."
"This grew on me as I went. At first it seemed just fine but added a bit more interest as it went along. Perhaps not enough to push my numbers higher, but worthy of giving it a solid rating and recommending it to myself to perhaps grab again sometime."
"330 ml bottle. This beer pours out a reddish brown color with a huge head. Aroma of malt and herbs. Thick malt flavor with sugar. A little bit of metal taste. I kept expecting the flavor to become a little sour or tart, but it never did. Sweet all the way through. Some grassy, herbal flavors. Hops are mild. Good drinkability. This is a pretty good beer, but I never really got into it."
"I'm not blown away by this beer, but I am still firmly impressed. As drinking goes, this goes down with the best of them. Maybe a bit shy overall, but pounds it out nonetheless."
"This beer is so underrated. Amber color , nice head, nice lace-just a fabulous unique beer. This is your Thanksgiving beer as I could see it pairing perfectly w/ Turkey, stuffing, crannberry, etc.Smell is so subtle and mild, there is some woody elements going on--this is a nice beer. Just take my advice and buy this shit if you have the opportunity."
"Another great Belgian / French beer. Its got a dark yellow - golden color, a bit hazed with a champaign like head and carbonation. Aromas of wine, musk, grapes, pears, apples and earthyness. Mild sweetness of honey combined with tart lactic acids create crispness and complexity. Not as musky, earthy, or pungent as some other Biere de Gardes. Lighter notes make this beer a better drinker. Finishes dry, tart, and crisp. Light alcohol is woven into the tartness and fades nicely."
"Tasted: 07/09/05"
"There are better biere de gardes, but once this is in my mouth, I find it hard to complain about a lack of transcendence in my glass...nice beer, 'nuff said."
"Pours a clear but quite bubbly gold under a one finger snow white head that lingers for a bit before settling to film and collar. Only a couple drops of lace cling to the glass. Sweet fruity nose, very strong of spice and raspberry. The mouth is very light, with subdued carbonation. Very sweet taste, with light fruit dominating. The spice is also sweet, adding to the natural sweetness of the wheat. No noticeable hops. The finish is sugary, while the aftertaste reminds a bit of a raspberry frozen popsicle. Not for me, thanks."
"Fine beer, nice way to end a week. My first biere de garde, methinks I need more."
"Creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel....goes down smooth. A tasty brew overall...but it's not something I'd drink regularly...nice for a change of pace. The sweetness gets to be a bit much by the end of the bottle."
"The malts used for this biere de garde lend a sweet taste, and the finish lingers with a bit of caramel flavor. Drinkability is good, I'm not overwhelmed in the ABV area or with palette destroying flavors."
"I'll try this with food next time to see how it works."
"A coppery red to orange caste to this biere de garde. The aromas are of fruit tea, raspberry, liquer-ish (not licorice) with a hint of an herbal hops prescence. The taste is smooth buttery malt with the aforementioned fruit character and a nice balance between the malt and the hops. A dry finish, very satisfying, great with just about any meal I can think of."
"This is not far from the beer mainstream. Yet it has more character and durability than bona fide mainstream styles that saturate the market. Not cerebral. Get some to enjoy with plates of steamed sausages or liverwurst sandwiches and kraut."
"Small 11.2 oz bottle from a four pack...clear light brown with an orangey-red caste to it, bright and luminous. Whitish head rises above 1/4 of an inch and has average staying power. Simple lacing but a nice spread across the glass. Aroma is spicey, verging on metallic and with ample citrus qualities. Medium body, less carbonation than in some Biere de Gardes. Begins malty, biscuity and sugary lemon bars with powdered sugar frosting, some sweet apple pie. Makes a nod toward drying mid mouth and finishes with some yeasty tones and a very subtle hop. Could tighten up even more for me, the aroma had me thinking a dryer finish was in store. Still, this is a creamy and quaffable brew."
"A smooth easy drink. Strongly carbonated, refreshing. Like an amber with a purposeful off taste, some nuts, citrus, corriander, parsley salt,carrot, and malt. Different and it works. Good thing Volo Caffe held on to an LCBO bottle from a couple years back, although I think that took away from aroma."
"Received this in a 10 pack Beers of the World gift pack so I had no real expectations when trying this one out. Noticed a good review in Michale Jackson's beer guide and feel not too far off. Enjoy the vanilla smell and after taste. Hard to judge its appearance since I'm not sure what a Biere de Garde is but it poured a nice head and solid lacing. Color of a copper unfiltered wheat. Will not seek this out specifically but it's worth a try."
"I'll look for it at my regular store, and sample it again."
"Simple but impactful flavors begin with some honey-ish malts and doughy feel. This is a total conversion beer. It's got some luxurious qualities to it with a slightly spicy mid-palate, but this is driven by crisp, simple taste."
"12oz bottle stamped with a best-by date of 03/2005. Poured into my Duvel tulip a dark amber hue with a nice, frothy 1-inch head. Good carbonation. Aroma of Belgian yeast, sweet malt, and light fruit. Mouthfeel is nice and sturdy, not too thick, not too thin. Palate is very fruity, with essence of peach and grapes, sweet malt, and light floral hops. Yeastiness comes through towards the back of the mouth, along with a bready character. Slightly bitter aftertaste is a bit unpleasant and keeps this from being a more drinkable beer."
"Thanks to merlin48 for bringing this beer my way. It pours a light amber color with a small head that dies off fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is reminescent of hay with some malts and a little hop. The flavor reminds me of a farm a bit. Caramel flavor with a bit of hay and dirt. Not bad, just not my style."
"This beer comes to my lips through two BA's. Thanks to merlin48 for sharing this with clvand0 who is sharing it with me. The beer pours a amber golden color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is lemony with a touch of biscuit in there, I think. The flavor is odd. I get some biscuit maly, somce lemony tartness and a decent bitter on the finish. I don't know about this one. Its not bad, but its weird. The feel is light to moderate, with a nice carbonation on it. Drinkability sufferes from the flavor that I just don't like all that much. Don't get me wrony...this is not a bad beer, but its not something I would have again."
"A clean effervesent dark amber ale with a foamy off white head. A slightly sweet malt aroma with a very strong sour apple and cinnamon presence. The light malt sweetness starts out the taste. Followed quickly by aburst of carbonation that brings an appley flavor along with it and a spicey hop finish."
"Overall, a pretty good beer, of a style that is not easy to come by in my area."
"Easy drinking and a nice change of pace. Really crisp."
"I like the style. It's refreshingly different. Light and mild, overall, and the floral hopping combines with the malt presence very well."
"Drinkability is a bit harder for me to quantify. It's a fine beer, but I've only had half of it and feel like I've been hit by a tractor driven by Jose Bove on his way to tear down another McDonalds. Sacre bleu!"
"Obviously, this is a very rich beer. I would highly recommend this as an alternative to dessert. This could be featured as an apertif."
"Flavor follows with a little bit of a cork to the mushrooms coated in caramel. Finish has spiced, sour apple finish."
"Cork popped rather easily off of this 750 but thankfully there was nol rush of beer. Poured a nice coppper color with a quickly dissapating white head. Smell was delicate and floral. Taste is full of subtlities, slightly sweet and mayber pepper?? I don't know if my mind is playing tricks on me. A lot of malt is present though which grows stronger as it warms. Pretty drinkable in my book. A nice treat every once and awhile."
"It's perhaps not the most intricate biere de garde, but it's fully realized, cohesive and delicious. Just a joy."
"The head was thin but dense and creamy on an orange mahogany color body. The smell was mostly malty but overall kind of weak. The taste was more interesting, although not exceptional. Some fruity notes of citrus and of red fruits are combined with a deep malty character.The mouthfeel is quite round but not overly complex or thick. Not sure I want to drink that again. I just had a cookie and I liked the cookie better."
"750 ml bottle corked and bailed. Very refreshing and easy drinking beer."
"IMHO: A fair brew with a nice mouthfeel, but not a lot of memorable qualities."
"Pours a rich copper with a nice two finger head that settles nicely,aroma is definently spicey all malt and sweet caramel with a touch of bread.Very firm malt taste to this beer lightly sweet with a vegetable flavor that lingers in the mouth,I get a light burnt note as I drink more along with some over ripe melon.a rich and tasty brew that Iam sure goes well with hearty fare."
"This was a very pleasant, very mellow, dry and a very flavorful and traditional Biere de Garde. Farmhouse characteristics. Burnt caramel, toasted malts, ripe fruits, perhaps a hint of ginger and a lingering suggestion of pit fruit on the finish. Lovely."
"This beer poured a reddish amber color and formed a samll foamy off white head that left circular lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of light citrus and grass. A flavor of malt, slight bit of cherry, almost a medicinal quality to it. The finish was sweet and also had a slight medincinal aspect to it. Pretty good beer for the price."
"500ml can: This one is an amber color. The beer is a bit fizzy with a slightly off white head, but it dies down quickly. The aroma is mild, but somewhat caramel malty sweet. The taste is better than the aroma. There is a medium bodied caramel sweetness to the taste, but also a fairl amount of complexity. Some nuttiness, fruitiness, with a hint of spices and hops. Flavor could be a bit stronger. Really excellent for a can beer!"
"Murky looking brown with an orangish tint to it. Thin but bubbly off-white head. Retetion is adequate. The bubbly collar leaves some sporadic lace. Aroma is spicy, herbal, hoppy and earthy. Awesome. Nice earthy and herbal characteristics. Great farmhouse brew. There's a nice sweetness, but also a nice dry, hoppiness on the finish. Fruit nuances of pear and apple check in to add depth. Nice medium-full body. Perfect amount of prickly carbonation. Very refreshing. A 750 for $4?? Yeah, I'd be buying a hell of a lot more of this if it was available in this area."
"This is not something that I could drink all the time, but it does go well with some stinky French cheeses and a nice crusty baguette. It is a cloudy amber and a decent sized head. The aroma has some orange and prune notes. The oily body finishes slight spicy with notes of anise."
"The best beer I've had in France so far, and I was beginning to give up hope. Looking forward to trying Brasserie Duyck's Blonde also. A fine introduction to the Bière de Garde style."
"Big, soft, round & juicy on the tongue. Prickly carbonation."
"My beer of choice this year at Thanksgiving dinner. 750 ml bottle. Poured an unfiltered medium-to-dark amber with a large head that remained throughout most of comsumption. Musty, malty aroma. I almost wonder how long this bottle has been sitting around on the store shelf as it was the dusty sole remaining one. Very musty flavor. Reminds me of a cellar or basement. Some sweet, stale fruitiness. Malt is hard to detect. Hops are mininal at best. Spicy or peppery alcohol near the back of the throat. Not a beer I was opposed to (it went pretty well with dinner) but I think it's an acquired taste. I'd like to seek out another bottle (hopefully fresher if this one was decrepit) and give it another shot."
"Lovely rich amber colour with a small off-white head. Very fruity aroma with hints of cinnamon. Absolutely incredible tasting beer, very fruity with hints of peaches and other stone fruit. Very soft in the mouth( a party for the palate! ). A beatifull beer to reserve for special occasions, But i could probably only drink one or two at a time. Would go great with fruit or strong cheese."
"very food friendly."
"An amber colored ale that pours with a flourish of a foam that settles to thin veneer of bubbles. The aroma of toffee, nuts, fruit and sugar combined with a faint mustiness bursts from the glass and then fades, but is still noticeable after a few minutes. This beer is soft, malty, then fruity, with sugary notes. Finishes slightly dry, yet a bit slippery, with a tartness that tickles the side of the mouth. A medium bodied ale with a soft mouthfeel but slighty rough carbonation. There's some unsual fruity flavors towards the finish that are very interesting. I like this beer, especially at $2.99 a 750ml bottle. A very enjoyable, peculiar beer. Based on what I know about the style, this a very good Biere de Garde."
"Ooooh if it were not for my cheapness I wouldnt have bought this bottle of 75cls of a medium beer. nor in terms of taste, nor looks nor actual overall desirability is this beer going on anyones top list. just because a thing has an uncommon name doesnt necessarily put it within the interest. this is a one timer. boo."
"Pours with a medium head, leaving some lace. Nice amber color. Malty, citrus orange nose. Starts sweet and fruity and finishes with some tartness and underlying hops. Medium bodied. Very different for a French beer. Served at Passports in Glouster, MA ($4.75)."
"As a side note, the cork appears to have some mold on it. Stored upright and I don't think it affected the taste."
"I don't know what this stuff tastes like normally, but my bottle was mega old and way past it's prime. The beer poured a greasy looking amber, with tons of particles floating in suspension. Aroma is winey stale, and the beer was just sour and old. I always have to take a sip, just to be sure it's not totally unpalatable. I imagine this stuff is pretty good when fresh, and I plan on buying it and rerating it. Just beware, because it certainly doesn't age well. I hate liquor stores that don't rotate stock."
"Fine if you like some sweetness in your beer."
"-F"
"11.2 ounce bottle. It's brilliant amber/orange/peach blends...and the head is a solid inch of fluff. Very sweet malty aroma, as well as peppery if you really sniff it. It's all about the malts here, caramel as the background, spicy alcohol, creamy then crisp in the finish, medium bodied. I enjoyed the hell out of this. I didn't know what to expect from France, but I was very pleased with the offering."
"I enjoyed this French biere de garde very much. It is distinct from its Belgian cousins but very drinkable."
"Orange-tinted golden colour. Very light chill haze. The head is quite small and drops to a thin ring and covering layer. Still, it's quite appealing. Aroma hints at the flavours to come - a couple phenols, some citrus, maybe a slight mustiness. The flavours themselves - there's a sour hint to the beginning, followed by sweetness, hints of lemon, hops fade in and out. A dry finish leaving the throat crying out for more. A very respectable beer. There's pleasant flavours, nothing is out of proportion and everything is restrained in a wonderful understated harmony."
"Notes: Big and beefy French Ale, treat this one with respect and bring it along on a picnic with assorted cheeses, beer bread and fruit. More of a “treat yourself beer” or something to toast with other than champagne. Obviously complex and sophisticated to say the least."
"486"
"IMHO Biere de garde is made to have with food. Especially comfort foods. So much more of the complexity of this beer is brought out by food than by drinking alone. This is meatloaf and beef or chicken stew beer."
"Not impressed....colour is nice, deep golden honey with very limited head...taste tho, is lacking as it quickly departs and leaves no memories....is kinda like a full bodied water.....maybe an aquired taste."
"A classic Biére de Garde. Flavourful, refreshing, and impressive when unleashed on your non-beer drinking friends. Comes in a 750ml corked and crowned green bottle. Nice pairing for nearly any food type."
"Very drinkable biere de garde, not as complex as say, 3 monts, but very pleasurable drink, spicy, light to medium body, hints of caramel, but maybe a bit sweet at the start, decent."
"I agree with Jason's review but found it a little too sweet tasting for my liking.  Had this in a 11.2 oz bottle."
