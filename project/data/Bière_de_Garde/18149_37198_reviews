"Overall a good beer, but not really all that true to style."

"Pours a light brown color with a slight haze.  Fizzy head that dies down to a ring, with carbonation rising up and creating a foam island in the middle.  The aroma has brown sugar, butterscotch, toffee and dark fruits.  The flavor has more dark fruits, caramel and citrus. Slight earthy flavor like dry wood rounded out with a kiss of alcohol.   Really damn smooth for 12% abv.   Impressive beer that reminded me of a Trappist quad."

"Final score: 3.55"
"Pours an orange red with a three finger light mocha head that sticks around for quite some time. The nose is very yeasty and spicy. Orange peel, coriander, currant, and a sweet bready malt. The flavor follows the nose pretty closely, but there is an unexpectedly strong hop bitterness. Normally, I find a strong hop presence distracting and out place in this style, but here I like it."

"Although you notice a slight warming as you drink the beer, the rich flavors for the most part keep the alcohol hidden."

"O-Overall a decent biere de garde from Lost Abbey nice balance of fruit and spice and yeast and malt."
"O: Apparently this is only the third Bière de Garde style I've had. I need to try more. This particular bottle is not a bad beer but I doubt I'll actively look for more. I didn't pick up any of the brett mentioned on the back label"

"Can't really remember where I picked this beer up but my beer guru noticed it and said they were a really good brewery so we gave it a run. Good, but not great looking beer and smell was similar. Good taste but nothing outstanding. Gains some bonus points overall for ABV that does not come across as boozy. Overall I would not buy this again."

"Overall, quite nice, and dangerously drinkable."

"Overall – Just a little rough during the after taste.. other than that, a great scent and a solid flavour. Another great beer from this brewer."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2013 vintage. Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense and rocky light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big plum, pear, peach, apricot, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, light mustiness, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, apricot, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, clove, pepper, toast, herbal, floral, grass, light mustiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, apricot, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, clove, pepper, herbal, light mustiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent biere de garde style! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - Bright, herbal, and spicy. An off-beat, well executed beer."

"Overall pretty good, a little too malty sweet for me, but it still has some nice balance as to not be too overwhelmingly sweet."

"O - 4.0 - Not too bad, nice holiday beer, one of the better ones I've had. I'm a little dissapointed I didn't get any brett out of it though? It probably hasn't been aged long enough."

"Reddish brown, with a huge tan head. Great lacing and spots of retention. Nose is malty, fruity, some brett, light spice and some musty character. Taste is malt forwars, yeasty, musty, darker fruits, bitter finish. Medium feel, medium high carbonation. Nice malt and yeast character, but the hop bitterness that lingers detracts from this for me."

"Amber with blood cherry notes and a loose, thin sheet of light cream foam. Smells of plums, raisins, amber malt, some bread, some dry desert dust and a little bit of clove. Taste is not what I expected - sweet malt, bitter over steeped tea, some hibiscus and rose petals. Really pleasant flavor profile here for me. Medium on full bodied with fine, overpopulous carb and a wet finish. Nice beer. Quite surprised by this one."

"kind of a strange one here, sort of a holiday saison if you will. pours a nice deep copper to red color, with a dull glow and a bright white head with fine retention. excellent lacing is left at each sip, and there is just a bit of sediment settling out. the nose is spiced a little like a holiday beer, but to me yeast was the star here. its funky and farmy, but this isnt a sour beer despite the brett. its like a lesser version of their red barn ale in this respect. flavor has some sugar to it up front, and a dried fruity character with some tartness, maybe cranberry in complexion, with a lighter grain bill and that wet animal yeasty finish. the alcohol was a little much for me in this one. usually i like the huge ones from the lost abbey, but i thought this would have been a better beer around 8% abv. its just got real boozy as it warmed, which went oddly with the yeast and the residual sugar. made the mouthfeel a bit strange as well. carbonation was decent, but i think would be better if it was even more ramped up. body was a nice full medium. a must share bottle, i would have been wasted if i didnt have a few people around to help. good stuff for the holidays, outside of that context its less impressive."

"The taste is a lot bolder than the aroma with many of the same pale malt, yeast, and sweet notes progressing into a more virulent biting pepper bitterness lingering to the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, very smooth and really sweet. easy to drink, alcohol is well hidden. I'm new to Brett beers, but I think this will be even better with some age. I think I'll look for another bottle and cellar it for a while to see what happens, but, it is really good fresh too."

"Served in a tulip, a slightly hazy amber pour, with a small off-white head that receded to a ringlet, and left a few dots of lacing on the glass. In the nose, fruit esters, yeast, light spice. More of the same in the taste, dried fruits, caramel malts, ginger, a bit of yeasty funk, a bit of hop bitterness, and a fairly potent booze kick. Nice melding of flavors. Medium body, moderate carbonation, hot, but drinkable."
"D: This was quite delectable and went down easy. I found it very drinkable making it something to be wary of due to the high alcohol content."

"Overall, this is a very nice high strength ""BdG"" that affirms Lost Abbey's brewing cred."
""
""
"Overall, a solid enough beer, but somewhat disappointing given the high expectations I had for it (which, in hindsight, were unreasonable as I initially thought this was a wild ale when I bought the bomber). The flavors were good, but too subtle. If the Gift of the Magi tasted as good as it smells, I would be picking up another bottle of this. For now, I'm content to try something else from LA. Certainly drinkable and I can appreciate the craftsmanship, but not really my cup of tea. Maybe BdG's just aren't my thing. I'm still very excited to try other offerings from the Lost Abbey."
"The taste is slightly subdued compared to the scent. Thankfully the mouthfeel has more carbonation that leads to a creaminess I would not expect given the seemingly lack of carbonation. Back to the taste. It starts of sweeter than expected and personally desired with a toffee caramel flavor. The flavor gives way to the spicy and fruity hop presence. Altogether, I would have preferred a drier finish as this comes of a bit cloying personally. Also the interesting yeast complexity did not come through in the taste. That said it is still a good beer that I am nitpicking a bit."
"Overall: this one is pretty sharp and acidic almost burning the palate. Very flavorful, a little over carbonated. Definitly a must try."
"D - Really nicely done, the malty, farmhouse ale base beer is taken to new heights by a brilliant application of funk and fruit from the Brett. I particularly like how vanilla and cake flavors mix with mango and pepper in the finish to leave a dessert like impression that is sweet and thick without even coming close to becoming cloying."
""
"An interesting sipping beer that defies categorization. Maybe it's an Imperial Belgian Pale Ale, but I wouldn't call it a Bière de Garde. On tap at Leroy's Kitchen in Coronado."
""
""
"O: Delicious. What a Christmas time beer should be. Definitely the perfect ale for sharing with friends or with your significant other on an intimate evening opening presents."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruits, and a caramel aroma. Taste is much the same with a medium spice bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice flavors."
"Pours a deep reddish orange amber color with a thinnish white head that shows moderate retention but little lace. The aroma strikes me as quite musty like a barrel room. Hints of sweet malt with a lot of non descript spices. Hints of bretty funk add to the mystery of what sits in this glass. The flavor is complex and a bit odd really. Up front I get an aged barleywine kind of oxidized caramel malty sweetness. Some spices that I don't recognize sweep in to counter what is left of the malty sweetness. This all finishes with a healthy does of funk and spice with a somewhat menthol herbal edge. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy bubbly spicy mouthfeel. This beer is honestly like nothing I've ever tried, its quite different. Its quite complex, but some of the flavors don't agree with my palette. I'm glad I got to try it."
""
"O - Pleasantly surprised by this offering from Lost Abbey. I really thought this was a fine play on a Biere de Garde and the addition of Frankincense and Myrrh is an inventive way to think outside the box."
""
"O: It was a very interesting beer, solid overall. Glad I shared the bottle, wouldn't want to finish the bomber myself. Great beer for the cooler nights to sip on, not a beer you're going to drink quickly."

"O - A good beer that I may revisit in the future. I was a virgin to the style and if this is any indication of the norm, I will be pursuing the style much more aggressively."

"Wow, this beer has really held up well, there is almost no oxidation. In fact, I think it could go another two or few. The alcohol is still big though...too big for the malt really. Dial this one down to about 8% and I think it would improve the beer quite a bit. I like the mild spice flavors I am getting, not sure if it is the yeast or actual spices...it kind of has a cinnamon-nutmeg thing going on. I don’t find the brett to be that much of a factor, which is probably a good thing in this beer's case. It already has a ton going on. Pretty good, I like it enough to buy another bottle next time I see it...although next time I will share it, lol."
"O: Brett character is subdued, but noticeable. Spiciness is in the forefront, but I can't place the spices used. The beer is drinkable, compelling, interesting, and highly recommended."
"This poured out as a muddy looking amber colored beer. The head on top was a light tan color. The smell of this beer gave off some soft dark fruit aromas as well as some Belgian yeast. Some bread-like aromas were on the nose also. The taste of the beer was a little on the sweeter side which wasn't too bad, there were more spicy fruit flavors in there also. The mouthfeel of the beer was medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Overall I thought this beer was pretty good. I would probably drink it again."

"O - I'm gonna stop short of calling this truly comparable to Boulevard's Saison Brett...but it is the first thing I can think of to compare this to. Bought a couple of these bottles on clearance and glad I did. I remember this beer being decent when fresh, but 4 years of age have helped this tremendously. This is really brett-y in a very good way. Alcohol is noticeable at 10%, but actually kept in check pretty well. Gonna have to go back to the store I got these and hope they still have a couple more of these left."

"O: Not bad but not great. A solid beer and a steal for 3.99"
""
"I think the alcohol content kept this beer back. The alcohol burn took away from the light feel that would have made this brew stand out from the rest. The aroma seemed subdued for some reason as well. An interesting beer, but I'd go with an old standby over this one."
"Bottle, Russian River snifter"
""
"Pours a clear, dark amber color with a medium, off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very malty with some farmhouse aroma and wild yeast...brett? Some burnt malt and English hop aromas. Some dark fruits and bread as well. Taste is very malty...caramel and biscuit malt with some light, bitter hoppiness. A bit of brown sugar and brett flavors. Floral notes and booze as well. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth. Drinkability is fair. Overall, it is a decent beer, but nowhere near my favorite offering from Lost Abbey or Biere de Gardes."
"O: A good change of pace from the normal. The Brett, malt, and hop flavors are all very good, but they get masked a little in the end with the burn and flavor of the alcohol. Still a decent beer."

"Lost Abbey Brewing Company (the Belgian inspired arm of Port Brewing) releases the Gift of the Magi (Biere de Garde) as their Christmas ale, featuring bitterness from the bark of Frankincense and contains the smallest amount of Myrrh which is an herb that has roots in ancient winemaking as well . This brew pours a hazy amber with flashes of gold and a very thin head that leaves no lace. The fruit heavy nose features hints of honey, malt, and spice. The spiciness is very evident on the pallet, with oak, vanilla, dark fruit, biscuity malt and even funky earthy flavors from the Belgian yeast. A lower level of carbonation helps all the flavors play out well in this medium bodied ale. A great beer to pair with a well rounded Christmas dinner."
"Love this beer. Not sure it is the style indicated. Hardly taste alcohol at a lll. Worth a try and then some."

"Overall – very good brew! Interesting label, interesting (and pleasant) taste, just good all around."
"A Lost Abbey beer that I never had before? The streak couldn't last forever, and it turned out to be a pleasing experience."
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, bubbly and tingly on the tongue. Not bad, but I wasn't really feeling the herbal and boozy notes on this - I prefer the Avant Garde from them for this style."
""
""
""
"Overall: Fairly complex. Drinks much heavier than it looks. Drinkability is fairly high."
""
"Overall pretty interesting, the malts and yeast really play out in this one almost as if they are battling for the most dominant characteristic. A bit boozy but that's what it presents so no surprises, and good for a Xmas like beer. Decent esters, fruits, malts, sugar additions, spices, etc etc. I think I remember the bottle version of this being better, which would make sense with a beer this big, and bottle conditioned, but it could also be my memory playing with me."
"The alcoholic quality to the beer is very distracting. Too bad as the rest of the flavors and aromas are quite good. It's still a very good beer overall, it's just a slight bit overdone"
""
""
""
"jd"
""
""
"O-well, the quality seems to die as it goes away. also, the carbonation goes away quickly. started out great, but could not stand the test of time. pretty hot also. definitely wouldn't be a bad beer to share though."
"O: not bad, but was expecting more from this Biere de Garde. Was expecting some more funk and Belgian-French characteristics. Seemed like an average craft amber to me."

"Apparently the Tap House has a 12 Beers of Christmas thing going on. I wonder if the bartender realized we weren't gonna be back any time soon when she gave us the punch card... Either way, this stuff pours a hazy sunset amber topped by a finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises orange zest, caramel, brown sugar, nutmeg, and light fig. The taste holds notes of pine resin, caramel, sharp Swiss cheese, brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and rye bread. This combination does not sit well on the tongue at all, and a touch of booziness makes the experience all the more unpleasant. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an almost chewy feel. Overall, I did not enjoy this beer. I think my note of ""kinda boo", though a bit weird, is more than appropriate."
""
"Overall I liked it. The first of this style for me so I didn't know what to expect but it was very interesting, I would try it again."

"The sample I got fizzed like champagne, so have a towel ready! What did come out was a barely transparent warm golden brown with a very thick and fluffy, and somewhat persistent, light tan head. Aroma is malty and fruity, the latter mainly pear with a little apple, and inviting if not strong. Malty, fruity flavor has an earthy undertone and quite a fierce alcohol bite for 10% ABV. Sorry, a half point off there. Full-bodied texture is edgy and a little tingly. OK, not exactly golden (maybe frankincense or myrrh?) but still a worthy brew."
"From a 25oz bottle, 2009 vintage. Orange pour, medium head. For all the trash I’ve talked about Lost Abbey this one is pretty darn good. At first blush is sweet and with the signature Lost Abbey heavy malt, briefly, but a refreshing and crisp hop presence finishes on the dry side. Some nuts and spices abound. Very fresh and bright. Enjoyed more than most Lost Abbey offerings, I may actually be rating this too low at 3.9."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. This was a pleasant surprise for me, bringing a bold and diverse flavor profile. The Brett is a little bit understated and could use some development, but I prefer its current state rather than it overbearing the other notes. I would like to try this again a little bit fresher!"
"Appearance is a light copper color with 2 fingers of head. The nose has malts, citrus, sweet candies, very inviting in general. Upon sipping this heavier Biere de Garde, I am hit by some funk, which is nice. Also, there is pepper, caramel and some more citrus. It is a beer which warms you with the alcohol, but also has a pleasant bitterness in the finish. Perhaps with even more time in the cellar, it would continue to mellow out. It was a nice beer in any event."
"O: I'm a Lost Abbey fan for sure, however, this was a bit rough... even in small doses. I'm glad I tried it, but I expected more. This was a 2009 huh? It's still quite rough. If I were to score another bottle, I would bury in the ground and hopefully someone will dig it up and taste it in about the year 4080!"
"O - This is a very good biere de garde. Sampled on the 4th of July but it still worked well."
"A lot going on here across the ratings spectrum. The flavors are a bit of a let down; a bit more earthen and muddy than I would've liked."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer. The flavors are not wicked pronounced, but they're decent."
"My server presented it to me in a 10-oz. tulip, although the aforementioned Spanky was going to let me have a pint at the same price. No, thanks, amigo mio. There was no head to speak of and the beer was a slightly hazy golden-yellow color. Leaning in, I noted an obvious Brett presence on the nose. Mouthfeel was medium with an intense tartness on the tongue. Now, when I say ""tart", I mean like fresh-squeezed lemon juice! Puckeringly tart and dry. Finish was Sahara Desert dry. Dry as the Zephyr winds. My entire palate and mouth felt scrubbed squeaky clean. Frankly, this seemed more like something I would want in the summer in lieu of a wheat beer."
"o - overall, reading some reviews going into this left me with some pretty low expectations...although this seemed to be the brew that would fill what I was looking for based on what I had read, so I popped it open. At first I was pretty blown away by the look and smell and it was on the money, but then when I tasted it, I began to understand some of the lackluster grades. I'm a big fan of a boozy beer, but this one was even a bit much for me. as it warmed, the booze did not fade into the background, but rather, it seemed like I was drinking more and more rubbing alcohol...ultimately this brew met the drain and I moved onto something else."
"The appearance, aroma and mouthfeel are all spot on. The initial taste is even okay too...but damn that aftertaste is one of the worst things I've encountered in a beer. I was wincing and yeching after every sip. I tried soldiering through it, but I had to tap out. Can't remember the last time I drain-poured that much beer."
"Dark brown appearance with a very frothy head. Strong fingers around the glass with heavy lacing. Used a New Belgium tulip glass filled it down the side till the last .1L and it was very active. Has an oaky alcohol smell with some hop undertones. Taste is a little bland to me. It seems to be lacking any real characteristic. It has a lot going on but nothing defining. Overall a good beer. Just not one I will be keeping in the fridge."
"Pours a five+ pillowy, light khaki head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy amber/brown color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Nose is a yeasty malt, flavor is spice, yeast and hints of caramel. Sweet and slight bitter finish. High ABV is hidden. Warming. Bottled Dec 2010. $8.99 for a caged and corked 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Really enjoyed this overall. A pretty unique and balanced offering without an obvious comparison. Found the 10% ABV a bit high and somewhat detrimental to the drinkability."
"Drink and Overall: Overall, it's a good Christmas beer. I'm glad I purchased this bottle, maybe better fresh? I thought the age may have been beneficial, but I probably won't find out. I'll pass next time."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice amber color, red in the light with a bizarre 4 finger head (on every pour). There is a strong hop aroma over powering most other smells leaving spice and clove in your nostrils. The taste is not as overpowering. There is a nice malt balance to the spicy hops. Very thick syrupy hop body with strong carbonation. For our session this was my favorite and despite being 10ABV was quite drinkable."
" ~ I'd certainly suggest this to a friend. I wouldn't mind having this one again. It has the making for a good fall season drink. I like it as a good medium paced sipper."
"An easy drinking Biere de Garde with a surprisingly high ABV. A good and interesting effort."
"I have had this beer a bunch, it always seems to accompany some kind of occasion. Like if an office friend is leaving to go work somewhere else, or at a birthday party, that kind of stuff. It adds an element of, i guess, 'specialness' to this beer for me, that always knocks it up a notch. I also really appreciate its wonderful smell, and its incredibly boozy taste. I always think i took a shot of some kind of liquor when i taste this beer for the first time in a night. Heavy malts and that bourbon note really hit home and i usually can only make it through one of these before i need to move on to something else. I still haven't really found a food that pairs well with this beer. I'll keep looking."
"Overall: not up to lost abbey standards most of the other beers they make are better in my opinion."
"The beer is very drinkable; in my beer budget, it is a treat because it's slightly pricey but well worth it. Also, it's a nice beer to share with someone that appreciates quality!"
"Overall a solid beer but not as special as I expected from Lost Abbey. Give it a try if you like the style."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color to light brown color with a light tan head. In the aroma, spicy and a dry, tart white grape fruitiness. In the taste, dry cinnamon, somewhat fruity, especially tart, white grapes. A spicy bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry cinnamon and small tart flavors in the aftertaste. Nice spice and nice tartness, in good collaboration with each other. Hides the alcohol, quite nice for the season."
"I'm pleased with this beer. I definitely think that putting some time on it did it well. I wouldn't want to try this fresh, I think the alcohol would be a little more obvious."
"D - This one is a sipper for sure. The alcohol flavor kind of subdues the maltiness at times though ill see how things go as it warms up a bit. I'm interested to see how the 2009 batch will taste in comparison. Maybe this one was past its prime but its still a good beer."
"D: An interesting beer. A nice sipper for a winter evening."
"medium-bodied with some crispness; medium carbonation. very drinkable for such a big beer."
"Note: 2008 vintage"
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer had a very pleasant dark red-amber color with a light head. The beer has smells of nuts and greens. The beer has a very round flavor, with a good balance of malty-sweet and hops, with peanut undertones. The sweetness stays prominent through the finish. Very flavorful beer, and very easy to drink."
"D: even though it did drink pretty good I was still dissappointed on the lack of carbonation and hate to see that these issues are a real problem throughout all their offerings. I honestly hate to see this from a brewery that I really look up to."
"My bottle is 2008 release tasted in December 2010. It was aged in good conditions. It's a day after Christmas and Gift of the Magi ale seemed like a nice choice."
"Overall I'm a little surprised at how this beer has been rated overall. Very drinkable, spicy and bretty."
"Nice sour/tart flavor that is complimented by an earthy oak presence and a touch of vanilla. There is a good balance of this flavor as well as some peppery spice and dark fruit notes. Hints of cherry, raisin and plum. Slightly funky with a bit of caramel and subtle hops. An excellent balance of sweet, malty and tart with a slightly dry finish. Very good."
"Mouthfeel: Best part of the beer, nice medium-heavy weight and a good creaminess. Not one to try a second time."
"D: Interesting beer and certainly worth a try. Good for sharing a few ways, as it's a bit unusual and best in small quantities."
"This one pours a medium copper color with very little carbonation. But there is enough to generate some fizz and make the mouthfeel very good. Smells of winter spices, and tastes of cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. Light in flavor and very drinkable. A very tasty winter beer."
"Drinkability: This brew didn't blow me away, but I feel like The Lost Abbey is putting together those brews for the folks who want a long time with it. These are beers that need to be taken in slowly, noticing the changes in everything, and I think that's the point by the end, which makes me have to take the drinkability up to where it is. This is only the second one I have, but I do have a few more that I'm waiting to try, and I'll be giving it the same window of time to see what develops -- seems like this is one for me that deserves all the time you can give them."
"D: All in all this one has good drinkability. ABV is surprisingly well hidden, but will catch up with you. To this point I have loved everything from Lost Abbey that crossed my lips...can't say that here. Still a good beer from a great brewery, but a comparative disappointment."
"D - this is a sipper, its a little alcoholic but very delicious."
"Vintage 2008, purchased at Archer Liquors. Pours a cloudy dull orange with a thin beige head that quickly recedes to thick lace. Nose is awesome with sour funk, raisin, slightly oxidized nutty notes, cherry, green apple, and some fresh lemon. Flavors are caramel, brett, citrus, a hint of cherry, and a nice bitter finish. The body is full with average carbonation and a long bitter finish. This beer is really good and well worth the aging."
"I <3 Lost Abbey."
"The beer pours a hazy dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a smooth and rich caramel malt sweetness with some nutty notes and a touch of fruitiness. There is a faint roasted character as well. I'm not smelling a ton of Brett here, just a subtle offering at best. The taste is decent. It has primarily a caramel malt flavor that's sweet with a light roasted character and a touch of fruitiness in the finish. Again, the funk is limited and mostly a background effect. It does have a mild alcohol ridden feel. It's nothing you would have to sip at, but it's ever present. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a solid offering, but probably the weakest beer from this great brewery."
"d - A decent beer but not one of my favorites from the Lost Abbey. The taste had a lot more spice than I was expecting or wanted and the alcohol was a little too prominent. A decent beer I would try again, but probably wouldn't seek out."
"Very good beer. Doesn't reach the stratosphere, but tramples some well traveled ground & reaches for a slice of originality. And it's appreciated."
"what an incredible beer, damn!"
"This is a solid, spice filled beer, from Port Brewing. The sweetness, spice and noticeable alcohol are a bit much, but this is still a pretty tasty beer."
"This is a pretty interesting beer. At first i wasn't too terribly keen on the beer. The hop stuck out a bit too much and none of the sweet malt aspects really showed. As it has warmed up though, the rich raisin and sweet flavor really balances out the bitter/dryness."
"Very hoppy beer. Looks good in the glass, nice mouthfeel, but this just isn't my type of beer. Too much hops, not enough malt. I haven't have too many beers of this style. So I don't know if it is representative of the style or not. But if this is what a de Garde beer is....I don't like them. The head dissipates quickly and its not a good enough beer to buy again."
"D: It's sweet and there's a richness about it. One glass in a sitting is good but I could not have more than that. Given the opportunity, I would drink it again."
"The alcohol flavors, spiciness and dryness present a little challenge to me at first. The flavors are good. As the beer warms up the flavors meld much better and the dryness and spicy flavors mellow a bit. This beer took me a little while to get accustomed to, but once I did it was enjoyable."
"2008 vintage. The beer pours a brownish-orange color with a white head. The aroma is brett funk, citrus, caramel and pepper. The flavor is more of the same with some nice orange notes mixing with the brett. The brett gives it a little leather flavor and there is also some spicy pepper as well. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - Never tried beers of this style and I'm not totally familiar, but this is too sweet for me. A glass with dinner was enough for me. Interesting though and from one of the premier brewers - perhaps the most premier - of Belgians in the country in my opinion."
"D - Not my favorite Port offering on tap. Ironically, I think I liked this one in the bottle better."
"Drinkability: A very good beer, but not excellent. I do like the plum and holiday spices. Similar to Abita's Christmas Ale. Could have several."
"M/D - very warming, alcohol very present, it was nice to try this one, although i'm a bit disappointed. I don't think I could drink a whole bottle."
"Drinkability isn't all it could be. I'm sure it has its fans but I didn't really care that much for this one."
"Poured from the 750 ml bottle into a Duvel snifter. Very murky ruby red/brown color, with a nice light brown head that hangs around for a minute or two. Aromas of dark fruits (red grapes, raisins, dates) brett and dark brown sugar. On the palate, this one is fairly yeasty, with brown spices, dark fruits, caramel and alcohol. Another solid effort from Lost Abbey."
"Gift of the Magi in an interesting release from The Lost Abbey. Perhaps that's because Bière de Garde is an interesting style. This one has a little too much of a caramel/toffee flavor for me. It just doesn't seem to blend well with the funky Brett flavors. It's alright, but doesn't result in greatness. There's too few bubbles in this one, too. More would be better. That being said, Gift of the Magi is far from bad. Well worth a try, if you ask me."
"Overall, a nice clean, well balanced biere de garde. Not too heavy and with nice pronouced flavors. Definitely a worthwhile Belgian style beer."
"D: I did not recall liking this beer so much in my previous tastings of it, but this was quite good. A real nice fruity beer that hides the alcohol to enough of an extent to be enjoyable."
"Overall a very interesting and fruity brew. Spices bring complexity behind the general candied fruit sweetness."
"Very drinkable, excellent big farmhouse style."
"Floral aromas waft from the bottle, some spice and pineapple from the Brett yeast. Dry, Belgian yeast character. Full body, rich and dry, awash with subtle spice and hay-like hops. Some mild sweetness and alcohol present as it warms. Brett is here in full form, but not in a funky way, more hay/floral/spice. The dryness keeps you sipping on it for awhile. Nice pairing with a washed rind cheese, I had Winnimere."
"Cheers to Lost Abbey!"
"Nice offering here. Definate winter season brew. A bit to boozie and spicy for the reviewer, but true to the style."
"I found myself letting this sit for some time. It isn't as though I didn't enjoy it but, rather, it didn't really grab me. Definitely unique, I must admit that it could be that I had hoped for a little more for the $10.99 price. Still, not bad, and kudos to The Lost Abbey for creativity. Decent stuff."
"The ale poured into the glass to reveal an almost orange color. There was a light tan head and little lacing. The aroma was of clove, brown sugar and cherries. The mouthfeel was much lighter than expected with a slight buttery feel. The taste was mildly sweet with maple and cherry. There was light hoppiness and alcohol in the finish."
"Caramel and spices, toasted grains, bread yeast, and sour apples? Does this sound like a great beer to you? First aroma was of apples...Must have been a bad day for me to taste beer, because my beer king brother recommended this as a good beer, and he's always correct in his reviews, but I found this to be not as appealing to my tastes."
"2008 vintage bottle. Making room in the cellar and decided to pull this one out. Poured at around 50 deg F into a Lost Abbey tulip glass. The head receded really quickly and left no lacking on the top. Right away I get some crazy funk coming on the nose always can tell that aged Brett. The mouth feel in this bottle is no existent. The funk I first smelled has calmed down into a nice fruity complex but does not come across on the taste. The copper color is really nice and the tannins from the oak of the other range of flavors keep this a relatively calm beer. I'm probably going to pop my 2009 vintage and see how it compares in this style of"" keeping beers"". Over all a very nice beer."
"2008 bottle. Pours a beautiful ruby honey golden nectar color. Can smell the funk, but also grain, oak, alcohol maybe pine and caramelized sugar? odd. Not too carbonated, nice and resinous mouthfeel, sticks around and adds to complexity. Drinks like a less burly barleywine, definitely very very interesting, far more floral notes in the afterburn. Alcohol kinda burns, in a good warming on a cold Colorado night way, but I'm sure the year and half in the bottle has mellowed that somewhat. Its a sipper that i feel is just a step away from being highly sessionable. Biere de garde - Beer for keeping ...Just glad i had the chance to try it, so now i know to go but more and age even longer. Love it."
"This is really interesting, different, and odd. There seems like a good Biere de Garde base, but the Brett, Frankincense, and Myrrh make for an odd mix of flavors. Not bad, and worth a try for your more adventurous taste buds."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable change of pace."
"I don't have much experience with the Bière de Garde style but I am assuming this is a bit of an outlier due to the ingredients used. I would like to revisit this beer some day down the road."
"Overall, it went nicely with the spicy charcuterie I was enjoying."
"D: Fairly high in alcohol with the typical accompanying flavors, so not my favorite Lost Abbey brew, but still very nice."
"Quite a nice one for this time of year. Truly a winter warming BDG and a real "" Gift "" from Lost Abbey"
"Poured a orange color with a nice white head, good carbonation. Nose of yeast, spices, citrus and earth notes. Taste is earthy, spices and some booze. Had a offputting aftertaste, like bitter, buttery or something. Mouthfeel is heavy, flay and bad. Not a fan and not drinkable, drain pour on a Lost Abbey, indeed."
"** In my opinion, this greatly improves with at least a year or two on it as the Brett has time to develop and really carves this beer into a much better being that it is fresh ** I have updated this review based upon that."
"D: Good. Complex, but drinkable. This typically isn't my style of beer, but I had no problems getting this one down."
"This beer completely lacked any kind of fruity, funky flavor I was looking for, it was lacking of body, taste, but certainly not alcohol"
"Drinkability is pretty good, nice funky, strong biere de garde. I'm glad I let it sit, based on other reviews of it being too boozy fresh. The strength is here, but it's clean, and fairly well hidden by the brett."
"Overall: Decent beer at best. Maybe carbonation would help. I hope these guys fix their problems soon."
"Next year I will certainly be seeking out a few bottles to have on hand for the holiday season."
"It felt much more like a liquor in the mouth than a beer. I'd say due to the unique taste and thin mouthfeel many would not find it too drinkable. However I found it quite drinkable in a liquor kind of way."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter. It pours a murky,dark, ruby red with a big white effervescent head. The aroma is big on funkiness, also some spice and green apples. The flavors of spice and funky green apples come through, along with a sweet alcohol backbone. The finish lingers with hot alcohol. The beer is very well carbonated, medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel and for me a sipper. A nice complex beer, for me the hot alcohol knocked the score down a bit."
"Drinkability: this is a true slow sipping beer where one glass is all you need in a session. Very flavorful and worth seeking this one out."
"Overall, really enjoyable. I bet this will be even better out of bottle, and after some time."
"D: I was quite disappointed by this. For being a Belgian pale ale, it didn't appear pale. The flavor profile was very one dimensional and hot from the alcohol, I would not get this beer again."
"Overall- Sweet and boozy. Good on a cold winter day."
"This is a very disappointing effort."
"Pours like apple cider... carmel brown with ruby notes, hazy. Minimal head. Scent is mild... bready yeasts, sweet carmel malts, watery fruit (apple, pear) and some very light funk. Taste is once again mild, but good. Belgian bready yeasts, slight sweet carmel taste. Water fruits like apple and pear combine with a belgiany banana flavor. Medium bodies, slightly grainy feel. Good unique beer which could be a bit more agressive in flavor."
"Drinkability is very nice. Booze is a not well hidden...but overall, a very good beer!"
"-i dont really want this ever again except for maybe a sip to check if it was a bad bottle"
"D- After I got over the initial heat of the very pronounced ABV, I really enjoyed this beer. It was absolutely not like anything I've had before. Not sure I would have this on a regular basis, but I am glad I had the opportunity to try something so unique."
"75cl bottle. Dark amber with a medium yellow tinged head and plenty of lace. Hoppy, alcoholic, earthy, and lightly bretty aroma. The flavor has a good dose of caramel a toasty grain and spices, with bitter, earthy hops and a light funky and tart brett edge. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation. There is a little too much alcohol, but it dries out the finish along with the ample hop bitterness. Brett is detectable but very subtle. Alright, but I would have liked this better with less bitterness and alcohol."
"D: Tasty base beer but I really wish the Brett would have taken hold a little stronger. 9.5% is surprising."
"This was a gift bottled for my efforts in the Phila Beer Geek competition last Spring. This is a extremely drinkable beer for the heft. I really liked the balance and smoothness. There was a good bit of yeast at the bottem of the bottle but it all went in the glass. I was picking up a tad of citrus on the finish. Very nice beer overall."
"Taste is even more of the dark fruits. Plum, dark grapes, figs, just wonderful. You get just the most subtle amount of brett in the flavor. I was told to expect more, but it was just lying underneath. Nice component to the beer, but not a forefront flavor. Thoroughly enjoyable. Carbonation was good. Medium mouthfeel and very easy drinking."
"Drinkability is very nice. Complex and very flavorful while keeping the alcohol almost completely in check and the flavors in balance. Extremely well put together beer."
"D: Really different. So far this is my favorite Bier de Garde."
"Not one of my favorites from Lost Abbey, but something I'm still happy to have in front of me. It's worth trying, I suppose, as something different and unique."
"- Slightly rich to have much, but the ability to put a lot of this away is very easy.. great balanced mix of flavors, carbonation was perfect... and that's about it!"
"A corked 750ml bottle shared with psycohops. Poured into a pair of basic tulip glasses. The ale appears a hazed honeyed amber color with about two fingers of quickly fading off white head. Flavors and aromas consist of tart green apple, hints of brett and banana, caramel, herbal and spicy, sweet, yet sour. The ale is lightly carbonated with a medium body and a bitter finish. Different and somewhat tasty."
"Overall there was a lot that could be good about this beer with some minor tweaking but nothing that I found overly exciting. Worth a shot for the curious."
"I'd consider this a failed beer from an otherwise very good brewery. It could be tweaked into a good beer, though, I think."
"If this bottle had been properly carbonated, the first two scores might have been higher. Maybe a few of the final three scores would have been as well. Gift Of The Magi is not for everyone. However, if you like Belgians, Brett and spiced beer, and are open to new and different exbeeriences (hey, I just invented a new word), then give this interesting domestic biere de garde a whirl. Two out of three wise men give it a thumbs up."
"D: Wow, this was one boring beer. Sadly, I've been pretty underwhelmed by LA's year 'rounders."
"The mouthfeel just doesn't work well with the flavors, it's too thick and crunchy with some barleywine characteristics."
"D-I think I have been infatuated with Lost Abbey based on its brewing techniques, minimal distribution, and general-mystique, but I am starting to rethink these intuitions based on a few prior LA tastings. This beer is very good, but doesn't blow my mind. I feel like the Brett did all the work in this one and I could brew it myself - not to say that I would not be totally impressed if I did. Very well flavored and decently balanced, but maybe not worth the $14 I paid."
"Poured from a bottle in to my Portsmouth Tulip glass. Pours a orangy yellow with hints of amber floating around. The head was no where to be found on this particular bottle as was the entire bottle very flat. The aroma was hard to detect but was very sweet. The taste again was extremly sweet and carried a funk to it. The mouthfeel was very smooth as there was no carbonation to the drink. I would hesitate on purchasing this particular brew again, the overly sweet tones were not suited to my taste buds. Will try to grab a fresh pint somewhere to compare and re-review."
"Pours a dark yellow color with a decent head that hangs around and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very weak, but there is a little breadiness in there. Quite a bit of funk in the flavor. Also has some banana, clove, oak, and breadiness to go with the horseblanket. The body is medium and the drinkability is very good for 9.5%."
"drinkability: average"
"Overall: In your face, bold, smooth beer. Refreshingly different."
"Pours a cloudy burnt orange/copper with a medium creamy tan head. The smell is less pungent than I would think with bread yeast and citrus hop aromas present. The taste is filled with alcohol,bread yeast,citrus hops,dark fruit,and orange peel.The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing well.A decent beer,but I was alittle disappointed ."
"If you like a sour brew, this one is a very easy-drinking one. A couple of the spices hit the tongue funky though, so it makes it a little strange as far as I'm concerned."
"Easy drinking. Not super complex, but still enjoyable and goes down easy. Hanging onto an '07 and '08 bottle just to see how it ages."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, 2008 edition. Purchased at Julio's world class beer stop in Massachusetts. Opened with a fairly wimpy ""poof"" and poured murky medium peach, under a light tan head, that left plenty of fine spots and blobs of lace. Light perfume, a hint of cheesy must and ripe fruit goodness in the nose. The label proclaims this one as a beer de Garde with an addition of Brett. I do get some minor funk notes. Cheese, mold and light horsy whiffs. Resiny dryness in the finish. I like. Complex, mysterious and tasty. Bring out some pungent cheese and grilled foods and enjoy."
"T/M/D - again, I taste malt and pumpkin, but really not very smooth and makes me wince a little (and I like pumpkin beers). I'm not picking the brett up either. I gotta wonder if I got a bad bottle of this - no way I'll be able to finish it."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Its a crime I can't get more. I could sip this stuff every night. An outstanding christmas ale from Lost Abbey. Can't wait to see what this stuff does in the cellar."
"2008 Magi poured 4/19/09 at about 55F. Pours clear chestnut color with decent white foamy head after an aggresive pour. Head dissipates relatively quickly leaving a thin film with more bubbles around the glass that leave a spotty lace. Sweet malt, musty yeast, and spices in the aroma. Malty IF with a syruppy, mildly bitter aftertaste. The spices don't come through as much in the flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and syruppy with a mild carbonation. I think an increase in the carbonation might improve the syrupy nature of this brew. It is not flat, so I don't think I have a bad bottle, but the texture is a little on the cough syrup side. This is my least favorite beer that I have had from this brewery, and I probably wouldn't bother to buy it again. I definitely give it a below average for drinkability. Not very interesting flavor and syrupy mouthfeel. I probably won't finish the whole bottle."
"This is a disappointment in my opinion. Too boozy, carbonation problems, and frankly just not all that interesting. It has some nice elements but it's also sort of a jumbled, boozy mess. I was excited to find this at Julio's on the way to EBF, but I don't think I'll be seeking it out again next year."
"I'm not a brett fan, but it's just about the most interesting thing about this beer. Not terribly complex and I didn't enjoy it very much. Disappointing."
"Excellent brew!"
"Overall - I'd drink this one again, but I'd go easier on it and I'd save it for Christmastime. I'm only realizing the significance of the 'Gift of the Magi' name. I'm feeling kind of dumb right now. Derp."
"Interesting how split people seem to be about this brew. Personally, I think this beer is fantastic and a bit different. Pours a hazy orange/amber. Smells sweet with some spicebox, and a bit hot, and with some fruity esters, but fairly simple. The taste is far more complex. Honeyed and long in the mouth with some light spice, some bright but subdued fruit, and a long bitter herbal fruitiness that is just wonderful and nicely balances the sweetness on the front end. Very smooth and delicious, and a nice winter treat."
"This is more of a Biere de Garde than a Belgian Pale, so keep that in mind. It pours a rich woody brown with a thin tan head. The nose has sweet malts, spicy yeasts and a subtle Brett character. Taste has citrus fruits, herbs, spices, and a bit of funk. Medium to full body flows over the palate."
"Edit: I'm sorry who I offend, but anybody who doesn't see this brew for what it is, has their blinders on. A good BSPA out of the gates that is spiced with lord knows what .. Look beyond the spices and sample a very unique brew that pushes the boundaries of what make ""American"" breweries ""American"". Drinking this makes me want to go out right now and homebrew something that is purely American..."
"Overall this was a nice offering. I was pleasantly surprised by the funkiness from the Brett as I didn't know this beer had any it until after. Has a nice complexity of flavors."
"Was hoping for a little more from this one."
"i definitely am not a fan of these overly malty, cloyingly sweet BDG's. and if you're going to add brett, make sure it leaves a stronger signature. not enough here."
"Pours a deep walnut amber. Not much of a head or bubbling. The best part of this beers appearance is the color. For a Belgian this beer lacks some crucial appearance points. The aroma is pretty herbal, can't really specify. Pretty boozey and full of toasted caramel. Maybe a little too boozey. Insanely herbal taste upfront. Sweet, boozey bananas and candi sugar. But a hoppy herbal and earthy finish. Somewhat chalky and sweet, but with a somewhat well whiskey linger. Meant for sipping only. A bit heavy on the booze."
"I think the addition of the brett gives it a unique taste and changes the style just slightly by adding more depth to the beer style."
"drinkability is pretty good. nicely balanced, but otherwise this one didn't really wow me. i'm usually a big fan of lost abbey, but for me this one misses the mark a little."
"Thanks Javier for bringing me this bottle from City Beer in San Francisco. I popped the top, well actually I pushed the cork out, but it made no popping sound. Hmmm, that is weird. Poured with no head. Could this be a bad bottle, I don't think so. Tea colored, hazy. Brett and hop aroma. Same flavors as the aroma. Not bad for what may be a flat brew. The tartness was nice. Overall I did enjoy it, just wish I had more experience with this beer. If I have it again, I will edit my review."
"Pours a slightly hazed reddish orange, almost coppery, thin white head forms, drops a few spots of lace on the glass, looks pretty nice - quite a unique colour, good retention. Smell is neat, quite spicy, honey sweetness, woody, some floral, strawberries and assorted fruit, cherries, the myrrh and frankincense addition is pretty interesting, gives a spicy character that is unique. Taste is similar, sweet at first, honey and caramel, some toastiness, fruit, bark and oak spiciness or astringency, has that neat woody character from the spices, yeast, light bitterness, pretty interesting stuff. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, hides the alcohol pretty well. I liked this one, not their best effort for me but certainly unique and is giving me ideas for my next christmas beer."
"Coles rare beer fest. Lighter carbonation and spiciness. Yeasty. Some apple pie, candi sugar but not sweet as Some hoppiness kicks in at end. Not bad but not too drinkable, better with food I would think.Brett? perhaps. Below average mouthfeel. A worthwhile experiment, more mellow from this brewery and not their best hoped-for result."
"Some people suggested, although in previous batches, that aging would improve this one. I am not sure; it might quiet down the heat, but so far this is disappointing, at best."
"D - Easy to drink and pretty enjoyable"
"Notes: Decent, not my favorite from Lost Abbey. Bit too sweet and thick for my taste buds."
"Overall, an interesting Belgian."
"D - Does not taste like 10% at all. Not overly sweet either, and fairly easy to drink. Me and a few friends easily downed a 750ml as a starter for our New Beer Sunday gathering."
"This is, however, a very good Belgian Pale ale and a beer that like to live outside the style guidelines, which I give Tomme credit for."
"Pours a very opaque tawny color, with a nice off white head on top. Low retention level with a very reserved sticky ringlike lacing. Wonderful fruity aroma, mostly plums and pears, with a big honey note. Light funk in the nose. This smells phenomenal. Smells syrupy. Flavor is just so overwhelming. Major brett funk but the malts just overpower this beer. Major flavors of honey, pears, and fresh plums, with an expectional funk. Some alcohol esters do take away some flavor, but lightly. Mouthfeel is very warming and smooth for the bite. Carbonation level is mellow, which I prefer with the style. I will definitely drink this again."
"this was the 2008"
"It took some time but this beer found its way into my good books. Tomme Arthur must be one of (if not the) most prolific brewers and the idea of using frankincense and myrrh for a Christmas seasonal is an idea I commend. Although this fresh sample didn't leave a great impression, I'm sure allowing the Brettanomyces more time will do the beer well - luckily I'm stocked up with both vintages!"
"The alcohol was apparent but well integrated, nice malt and bitterness blend, the latter more predominant with warming. I thought this was very much a Strong Ale, nicely balanced with an apricot aftertaste and more peach notes. It was not overly dense but had substantial body and mouthfeel, a flash of orange zest here and there and a muted alcohol backdrop. Overall, sufficiently complex with a fleeting but refreshing citrus flash here and there making for a most interesting mouthfeel and very drinkable beverage... thanks, Jan."
"D- This is how spiced winter beers should be. Good solid beer with some mysterious spice qualities that can't be teased apart. All the flavors work well together complimenting each other. They managed to put spice and malt and hops together and it works. I don't know if they used Frankincense and Myrrh but whatever it is its great."
"Drinkability: Complex, but lacks carbonation. After the smell I was surprised by the taste (not positively), particularly the hops and the bitterness. I considered not finishing it, but as I do I find it enjoyable. It is probably a beer that will change a lot with age as brett develops and hops fade."
"this is a good beer I have another to try next cristmas in my cellar. I don't know how much of it I could drink though."
"D: Masks the 10% abv really well. Probably would have a hard time polishing off a pint bottle by myself but could enjoy splitting one."
"They want contemplative...they goddit. Totally a sipper over a couple of hours."
"Drinkability: Looking over the reviews of others, I wonder whether this is not a beer that needs a year, or more of age; I recall Tomme Arthur posting that the Brett takes a while to ferment in the bottle and the lack of carbonation others are experiencing was not an issue in my aged bottle; in any event, to my palate, this was one of the top offerings from Lost Abbey"
"Pours an amberish brown, minimal head, decent lacing around the glass. smells musty, and like candied sugar. Upon tasting, a dry beer, but not very sweet. At first the spices take over, and then a hop bitterness kicks in, more bitter than what I was expecting from this. Heavy alcohol presence combined with the bitterness detract from the overall experience for me, as I was expecting something a little sweeter (more along the lines of how Allagash spiced this year's Fluxus.) Not much of a fruity taste, either. The brett gives a slightly sour presence, but it doesn't dominate. I guess the best description would be like Christmas out on the farm somewhere (or in a stable, go figure). Combines spicing with a dry grassiness. Not a bad sipper, but overall not quite what I was expecting."
"Finish is long and again tangy fruit with some alcohol warmth."
"pored from a 750 mL bottle into a pint glass. Poured out a cloudy amber color with decent white heading. Some nice holiday spices are immediate to the smell with some dark fruits. Heading disapates very quickly to nothing. Immediate taste malt and very very heavy with the alcohol aftertaste with a bitter settling, almost unenjoyable.The first glass I drank was fine the next I must have drank too quickly and woke up an hour later."
"Poured out a deep amber color with a tan two finger head that quickly receded to almost nothing into a 12oz tulip. Lacing slid down the glass with each sip but hung around till almost the last drop. The aroma coming from this beer hit me before I even picked up the glass. It was like a cornucopia of fruits. I could smell cherries, apples, raisins or prunes and it seems they didn't even try hiding the scent of alcohol, which I didn't mind at all after I took a sip. The taste reminded me almost of wine with lots of alcohol undertones. Again, cherries and apples were very present. Mouthfeel was a bit oily on the lips but finished clean. Not too easy to drink due to the alcohol being so noticeable. I wouldn't be able to handle more than one or two of these before calling it quits. A great ale indeed."
"Drinks pretty slow, due to the dryness, the brett didn't really help or hurt this one"
"D- I was really looking forward to trying this beer and picked it as my Christmas beer, and that is exactly what the character is of this one-a Christmas beer. Its a good beer and I wouldn't mind trading for and aging this one but the flavors (particularly the spiciness) come through a little strong."
"2008 edition, in 750 ml corked bottle."
"2007. Seemed appropriate for enjoying on Christmas Eve. It poured with a thin beige cap that formed a thick collar and sheets of lace. Great head retention. The beer itself was a hazy tawny amber with a constant stream of bubbles rising to the surface. The initial aromas were caramel and light herbal and floral hops, a bit grassy too. As it warmed there was a hint of earthiness and tart acidity. Light herbal bitterness with a delicate flavour, a combination of caramel sweetness and cereal grains. Alcohol was present in the finish, along with a light lingering white pepper spice. More earthiness and tartness appeared as it warmed. Moderate carbonation with an airy, light texture. The medium body was a bit creamy and there was mild warmth. Very nicely balanced overall. Mellow, elegant flavours really melded well together. Brett character was light, but definitely a contributing characteristic, and the year it's spent in the bottle may have brought this out more."
"Another interesting and tasty brew from Lost Abbey, though I wouldn't put it near the top of my LA list. The spices really throw a unique twist into the beer."
"Bought at Ledgers Liquors in Berkeley and saved until tonight. Pours a muddy brown with zero obvious carbonation...until a couple of seconds pass and a short head forms. Still looks a little tepid. Smells a bit of spiced malt, but mostly of strong fruity ethanol. Flavor is a lot like the aroma...dry malt with hints of spice but then a massive ethanol attack. Very aggressive and lingering alcohol, distracting. No sense of the Brett that the bottle says has been added at bottling. Syrupy mouthfeel. Nah. Not my favorite."
"Nice beer, although I don't know if aging it a year improved it or not. May pick up a 2008 and see how that compares."
"Overall I was slightly hoping for more of a sour character so I was slightly disappointed, though it's still a good beer. Sweetness was a bit off-putting."
"D - A very complex brew and one I would love to try again. Somewhat restrained but right on for the style IMO. This is an excellent beer and Lost Abbey gets a lot of flavor out of the yeast in this brew."
"All in all a solid beer. I was a little intimidated originally by the fragrances but it pulled through. I probably will not buy this again for a while but was happy to have tried it."
"This beer pours the color of a light brown with a huge white head with good Belgian lacing. The aroma is very floral, almost perfume like, it's malty and not too hoppy. The flavor is of a light malt with a little bit of spiciness to it. Well balanced but the body was substantially lacking. Really thin."
"D - A slight mess of muddled flavors that are not helped by the flat carbonation."
"D- one and done. it took me a little over two hours to finish this 750. this is a good candidate for sharing with the 10% alc. not my favorite LA product but i'm glad i tried it. the amount of flavors in this brew may be off-putting to some though. This probably goes better with some cheeses."
"Drinkability: I definitely like this, and if you like wild ales you probably will, too. It's not the best I've had, but I wouldn't have a problem sipping this all night."
"D: High alcohol, delivers a buzz quickly. Grill some pork, pour a bunch of bottles into a bowl, add some chopped fruit and have yourself a Hawaiin Hoppy Lau Lau for the holidays."
"The Lost Abbey has once again brewed a masterful, subtle ale that is sublime in execution and a joy to imbibe. It's not my favorite of their line, nor a star in the prestigious BSPA field, but an interesting and extreme beer that I'm glad I tried once."
"Notes: This is the last bottle of Lost Abbey brew I had sitting around from my days of trading."
"2007 vintage- Pours a rather hazy peach colour with vigorous head. Nose- brett is very noticable- earthiness from the brett, spice and sweet malts. Taste- a lot going on here- various spices and fruits, toasty malts, funky dryness and touch of sourness. Medium to thick body, no notice of boozy hotness however. A very unique beverage that I think really benefited from a year to dry out and let the brett work its magic."
"Pours a dark auburn with a frothy tan head. Nothing ""pale"" about this. The head sticks around for quite a while and leaves a thick lacing. Perfume aroma of pepper, wheat, grass, oranges, minerals, and funky wood. Fruity, herbal taste. Dried peaches, more orange peel, some white pepper, apples, and caramel malt make up the taste. In the background, there is a constant herb/mineral/oaky taste which I presume is from the Frankincense and Myrhh, but having never tried those things on their own, I don't know. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic beer."
"Drinkability: Though not my favorite of the Lost Abbey line-up, it's still well-rounded and reasonably drinkable as it definitely hides its ABV rather well."
"taste is smooth, somewhat watery, caramel, spice, malt, apricot, some peach, and citrus, end is light, spice in the aftertaste, warm."
"D- one bottle is plenty. the high ABV and different tastes make this one hard to want more than one. glad i got to try it, and glad that its sold here now."
"Taste at the center contains notes of tart apple, pear, and cherry. These fruit flavors are backed by a strong boozyness, and the finish provides remaining lingering tartness that makes the mouth pucker a while longer. Overall, a very different beer being that it's a strong biere de garde. Almost replicates a lighter malted barleywine. Excellent quality by The Lost Abbey."
"d: A contemplative and subtle brew that made me sit and ponder the various flavors I was experiencing. Nuanced, balanced and a welcome change for the holidays."
"M- I swirled the hell out of it, releasing all of the carbonation, but second pour gave me a great chewy feel, with lots of bitter orange peel twangs at the back of my palate. INTERESTING beer. Wasn't expecting this much complexity out of such a young beer (08 vintage)"
"T/M: Practically no carbonation. Smooth but a touch thin. Not as much sourness in the taste. Mostly caramel and malt, with some hearth clove spice, fades to some hop spice, and a touch boozy on the finish."
"Its drinkable, but I feel this beer is simply too young. The alcohol totally sneaks up on you. Unfortunately I'm not tasting much more than the alcohol, but admittedly it is smooth and decent. I love Lost Abbey/Port Brewing. Definitely seek this beer out, and try to age it if you can."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spiced, rum cider-esque comes to mind with a little bit of abv being noticed in the body."
"Mouthfeel is heavy and flat, I don't care much for it."
"Notes from 12/25/07 (yes, appropriate date to pop this one)."
"Turns out this beer is more of a dressed up biere de guarde than a belgian strong pale ale as stated on the back of the bottle, so things make a bit more sense now. Drank a whole 750 of this in about an hour so its pretty damn drinkable, then 10ABV is well hidden and could get you into some trouble if not careful. Very, very good beer."
"Overall, this has aged well. This bottle is not nearly as good as the same-vintage bottle I tasted 1-2 weeks ago, but I still like it better than fresh."
"All around good to welcome in the new president. For a second term I would work on it."
"D: Good drinkability, but pretty strong. I liked this a lot better when I gave it chance to warm up. It was too subtle when too cold."
"Medium full body with some warming from the alcohol...more carbonation would aid in the overall drinkability of this fine brew. This is freshly bottled and more carbonation should come in time, i'll let you know in six months when i crack another Gift open. Great seasonal offering that will improve with age regardless, Cheers!"
"D: Pretty tasty and drinkable, if it weren't for the fact I was at CBS and there were lots of other good things to try."
"I owe 0110x011 a big thanks for sending this as a TIF winner's treat. And yes, I did copy and paste your name to help me in the long run!"
"D: The yeast clumps are unappealing and the ale is generally muddled. Not my favorite Lost Abbey offering."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not too impressive. The aroma is pleasant, but the sheer quantity of yeast rendered the appearance unattractive and the taste was a little bland. On the other hand, the mouthfeel and aroma were very nice. Alcohol is a little high and also, a little noticeable."
"Pours a deep copper orange with a thick off white head. The aroma is medium sweet, yeasty, floral, citrus and light spices. Flavor is floral, orange, herbal, pepper, apple and light pepper. Medium to full body, smooth and creamy texture. Finishes medium with a citrus bitterness."
"Pours to a hazy wheat honey gold color body. Head is two full fingers of rocky tan fuzz that has very nice retention. Nose is faint but includes some crisp and slightly wheaty sour feel. Smooth complexity is teamed with a grassy hop feel and a long dry, almost peppery spice profile that is very consistant. I would think that the brett has not fully taken effect and probably needs a little more time to age. Moughfeel welcomes the next sip and tingles with spice. Nicelyu drinkable now, but would be nice to see what some age does for this one."
"The label puts this in the Biere de Garde style. Here it is a BSPA... Either works, as neither works...An interesting American spin on a Belgian/French style that turns out to be unique, though not one that thrilled me."
"Overall this is a pretty solid brew. Definitely a seasonal worth coming back to."
"Drinkability is not bad. But this one didn't do much for me. It's interesting, and worth a try. But it's a bit too dry and bitter for my liking. It's a good beer, but not a favorite for me..."
"This bottle was obtained via a trade with Smokingmex. Many thanks for the opportunity. Poured in to my Stella Artois glass a cloudy (perhaps from the low temp) orange/red color, with a decent enough looking white head that quickly faded in to a lace crown. First thing that comes to mind with smell is light stone fruit such as Strawberry and Raspberry. There is also a light presence of funk in the smell, which I suspect is a result of the addition of some Brett. Taste is sort of surprising to me in that it is much more hoppy than I was expecting. The brett adds a slight tartness, along some dry grain and fruit in the beginning. Mouthfeel is medium. Drinkability is good, but the alcohol presence makes itself known, making it a brew that would be good to share with friends. Reminds me a bit of the Avant Garde ale in some ways. GOTM is indeed a gift from a brewery that I have been gaining respect for with each new tasting. Hopefully it will make it to Boston soon, like some of its counterparts such as Serpent's Stout, Carnevale, and Devotion. More than worth seeking out. Cheers"
"I've wanted to try this one since it came out but since it was bottle conditioned with Brett I decided to sit on it for a few months to let that do its work. I think it could still use a couple of more months to tone down the spices."
"D-This is some interesting stuff! My first Bier de Garde / IPA hybrid. Very cool of the Lost Abbey folks...a most interesting brew, very tasty."
"The amount of dry hopping in this threw me at first, but after I got past that, this a rather tasty and easygoing offering from the Lost Abbey. And I nearly did a double take when I saw that this was almost 10% ABV as you feel none of it in the taste and body. Good stuff as always from Tomme and company."
"D - Highly drinkable despite this being an extremely complex brew. This has elements of IPA, barleywine and Belgian farmhouse styles that seemed to blend together quite nicely."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a deep clear copper color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of medium sweet Belgian style malt with light funky yeast notes. Taste is also one-dimensional with some medium sweet Belgian style malt with some light funky notes. I thought this was missing some spices or some kind of ester. Good carbonation with average body and no apparent alcohol. I thought this was OK but definitely not as good as expected. Not that it impacts my ratings but I am starting to think this brewer more hype then what he actually deserve - good to great beer but the exceptional ones are fare and few between."
"Not the best from Lost Abbey but still interesting, do not know what to style to classify this under, not in a rush to drink this again but will probably try again next year, worth trying once at least"
"this is a great beer i'd love to drink again in the future."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown with a huge head- great lacing. The aroma is spicy, floral, malty, sweet and overall...very complex. The taste is herbal, spicy, hoppy, earthy and layered, but balanced - this one's on Brett and makes description a bit beyond words. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. This is an excellent brew - a bit odd, but something I'll search for again."
"Hazy medium orange pour with small head. Smell was big, vibrant hops. Somewhat sweet and citrusy with a backdrop of something else intangible to me. Taste was hopped very nicely but not bittered as in an IPA. Tart fresh, bright flavor with a hint of bretty funk, that was pleasantly milder than expected. Nice body and bubbly mouthfeel. Very nice."
"Overall: Delicious, and I love it, and I'll definitely buy it again when I can, but I can't put my finger on exactly why. Ahhh, hell: who needs to know for sure?"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3/4"" ecru head over the cloudy medium amber brew. Fluffy head lasts well, with delicate sporadic lace. Aroma is fruity, spicy, but also has an old grassy hops sort of character to it. Taste follows along, but without what I perceived as the detracting part of the aroma. Alcohol warmth at the close. Small bubbles make the mouthfeel excellent, and drinkability is quite nice as well. Some holiday brews out there could learn something from this brew in regards to not over-spicing. Another nice one."
"Surprisingly light for Lost Abbey."
"D: This is reall, really good. My favorite offering from TLA to date. Everything comes together really well. The flavor is pretty bold, even for the style, but it's not overpowering or tough to drink. I do think this could use to age a little longer as it's still a bit rough around the edges, and I think the Brett hadn't really permeated the flavor yet. Not a sessionable beer. I felt the alcohol from the first sip. Bottom line-I really like Biere de Garde anyway, but taking and making it into this is a really nice peice of work. Highly recommend if you can get your hands on it."
"Alcohol is very well hidden. Medium body, with a slight creamy feel. Very enjoyable."
"Man this is a damn tasty treat....wow. So thick and creamy with huge caramel bursts, banana, clove and flowery finishings. A slight bitterness on the finish and minimal residual sugar. Again light spices with more of a ""teroir"" type feel that only Lost Abbey could accomplish. Can't get over the creamy thick caramel middle. Damn this is fine. There is a bit of alcohol in the chest but this is so tasty it gets a pass."
"Overall I thought this was fantastic, really one of the best I have had and another rare gem from Lost Abbey. I just do not know what it is with them, its like they cannot lose, every beer they make seems to be better then the one before that. This was one of the finest drinks I have ever had and I look forward to having another."
"Mild piney and subtly fruity aroma. Cloudy orange/amber color. Somewhat cloudy with a fair amount of sediment. Nice off-white head with good retention. Some bitterness. Fairly spicy with an astrigency that suggests more spice than I actually tasted. Detected some notes of candied fruit (fruitcake). Slightly reminiscent of Orval."
"Poured into a chalice a dark golden orange/reddish color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, which leaves a nice thick blob in the middle of the glass and some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, some nice yeast strain, spicy, lemon/citrus, and slight caramel. The taste is malty/yeasty, very nice tangyness, nice touch of citrus, and some caramel. The finish is bitter/tangy/dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty BSPA, highly recommended. Another awesome brew from The Lost Abbey. Thanks Bill."
"D: The alcohol is a little apparent in this ale. I doubt I could polish off an entire 750mL unless I was eating. I believe my initial comment was ""Damn, this would go great with some jerk chicken wings."""
"The spicing here definitely contribute a sharp, perfume like character to this brew (especially in the flavor); this is not surprising as I think both Frankincense and Myrrh are/were used in that sort of application. It is hard to get a sense if the Brett has kicked in yet, with the ample carbonation I might have guessed so, but the spice notes are still to fresh to really tell yet. This really needs quite a bit of age on it before it comes any where close to peaking; I'll be trying this in a year or so, but it may actually need a couple to really take off."
"As I noted above, this beer would be much better if not for the awkward finish. I do think some aging would do this beer a lot of good...I can see it developing quite well with the harsh alcohol on the finish diminishing over time. Well worth a try and will certainly get better with age."
"Notes: A good brew. On the spicey end of the Belgian Pale style and fairly dry as well. Price per Value....ehhh....1 bottle a year and I'll be just fine."
"$14 750ml bottle from Southbay Drugs. Nice orange color with an initially huge white head and then nothing. The first glass was clear but they got murkier as the bottle was consumed. Smells sour at first and then sweet. The flavors are myriad and I couldn't pick them out individually at first. My friend commented on how complex the flavor was. At first it was so peppery and it washed over the tongue with a tanginess, then slight fruity flavors, I briefly tasted the funky barnyard hay-type flavor and alcohol comes and goes. While I am not sure it is worth the price tag, this was a very interesting and unique offering. I'll be looking forward to the next Lost Abbey beer from the cellar."
"D). So delicious! Lost Abbey never dissapoints. I love the complexity of all their beers I have sampled and I'm excited to be a patron saint this year!"
"I'm on my second pour now and, as I expected, the appearance has turned totally cloudy. Man, the Brett is just ruling it now so, me being a fan, the drinkability factor just crept up a notch. Great sipping Ale, indeed. I'd buy it again."
"Caramel colored with an off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. Somewhat funky aroma, I swear I get a small amount of resinous hops too. Earthy, hay, maybe a touch of funk, but I still get more of the resinous hops in here. I think I get some tastes of lemon and oats too, if that makes sense. Medium bodied with a dry-ish hoppy finish; higher than medium carbonation. A rather different beer, but still quite good."
"Poured out of 750ml bottle corked and caged bought from lost abbey. Poured into my duvel snifter. Poured a golden copperish orange color with nice thick foamy head that retained for a long time. Smell is of cinnamon, honey, a slight resinous herbal scent. Taste is a citrus hoppy biere de garde with semi sweet dryish musty earth flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and the alcohol while present is very subtle and balance nicely by the malt and hop profile. I am sure this beer will improve when the brett flavor and aromas develope with a little time."
"Drinkability: A sipper. There are some overwhelming flavors in this that would keep one from drinking too quickly."
"D: Drinkable now, no doubt. Given a few months of 'contemplation' in the bottle, this could be a truly 'magical' gift. A pleasing slow sipper this winter evening, one I'd certainly seek out again - though next time getting an extra to see what a bit of age might do."
"D- At the first sip I was kind of weary about it. Drinking more and more of it it really pulls you in to the interesting complexity and variety of flavors this beer offers. I plan to sit on my other bottle for about 6-12 months to see what its like when the bretta kicks in. I can see that making this into a completely different beer like the 10 Commandments."
"D: It's a good beer, but in the end, I wasn't as in to it as I thought I would be after the hype. Definitely worth a try though."
"Drinkability- Would really like to try this one again. Was in a hurry and really didn't get the full effect and didn't quite get to enjoy it as much as I wanted too. As it, it was tasty and quite different from any other beer I've had. Very odd spicy flavors that melded pretty well."
"This is definitely worth a try if you can find it, another fine brew from Lost Abbey!"
"A patron saint was kind enough to purchase this for me at last fridays (nov 23) Older Viscosity bottle release. This Magis label states it was bottle conditioned with brettanomyces. Pours cloudy blood orange with a white head that had orange globs in it. Aroma is mostly dry with black pepper, fresh hops. and barnyard. Has a dry, chalky mouthfeel. Musty dry flavors at first of bready malts, yeast, and tart lemon giving way to a light sweetness and mild boozyness to finish. A fairly complex brew here. Wish I had a bottle to age."
"It will be a dessert in another year."
"Definitely on the sweeter side. All in all, not very good."
