"On tap at Goods from the Woods 2014 with Festero. Not sure why they would confuse us with a name like oxtoberfest, Marzen this is not. Smokey light malty sweetness hints of floral spicy hops and a rustic earthy funk. Nice brew with a bit of a confounding moniker."

"Sour, back end possesses a serious leather taste to me, serious leather taste!! But it's good, I appreciate it.... Far from a favorite though. Oxbow is a good brewing company"

"This is another enjoyable Oxbow beer. I don't like it as much as some of their other offerings, but it is well made and an interesting combination of styles."

"A lot of fun to drink."
"D - Something about the slight saison funk and the slight smoky grain threw me off. Not my favorite Oxbow."
"O - Overall this is not your usual Oktoberfest. While I don't get any typical saison aspects I dont really get any typical Oktoberfest ones either. Its some weird hybred that really works. I would love to have a big mug of this with a pile of German meats. Another delicious beer from Oxbow."
