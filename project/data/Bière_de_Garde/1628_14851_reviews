"Swung out to the brewery to pick up some bottles of this years vintage and grabbed a pint. Brew arrived in a pint. Nice transparent copper color with a thin had that bubbled away quick but left a thin skin of bubbles on the surface. Nice rich color and streaky leaving. Nose is fairly muted but one can detect nice caramel almost buiscit notes. Taste is more if the same but far more toasted. Nice crystallized malt. Really nice body. Very balanced. Really drinkable and enjoyable bdg. makes me really enjoy a style that i otherwise couldn't care much for."
"O: On par, if not better, than last years vintage. Another high quality beer from Evan. This beer is a well hidden christmas treat, for us locals. Cheers!"

"Overall – A decent brew, although nothing really to exceptional for the price. It had a good level of complexity, but in some ways was a bit too complicated and confusing as some of the flavors really did not transition and meld together well. One to try, but not really one I would go to back to again and again."
"Overall another amazing offering from phil-era southampton. I can only hope they can continue this tradition of amazing beers."

"Appearance is a deep orange and copper tone with an off-white head. Its` nose has spice, honey and some caramel. The taste of this biere de garde contains some bread, light malts, hay and a small amount of fruit. It is all subdue, too much perhaps. Mouthfeel is low, dry finish. One of the better choices from this style imho."
"Pours a lightly hazed amber, decent head and retention. Scent brings musty wet hay and spicy yeast before notes of toffee and roasted nuts present themselves. Taste follows scent with an initial push of musty hay, dried grain, moderately spicy and lightly bready yeasts, nice dry toasted nut and toffee flavors throughout. Rustic comes to mind. Medium bodied, lightly grainy on the palate yet smooth. Overall a very nice seasonal offering that doesn't make it all about the spices."

"D: Awesome. Because of the lower ABV and lack of heavy malts and spiciness, this one can be had all night."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, fizzy, and chewy in the finish."
"I really wanted to like this one, but (like a lot of Southampton Brews) this just isn't doing it for me. French Country Christmas Ale *seems* like this should work, but ultimately does not. Simply a fair Biere De garde, and that's a pity."
"I don't think this bière de garde, although it was good, will have the same kind of effect (which is just as well, because nothing could possibly make me love Christmas more than I already do). Southampton is a great brewery but the best of their offerings come in the 750ml corked and caged bottles; given the option, grab those over the bombers."
"Overall, I would say that Southampton's Christmas beer is pretty good, and the drinkability follows suit."
"The beer pours a copper color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet crystal malt scent along with a slight, dry mustiness. The taste is good as well. It has a dry, musty flavor that goes down easy and finishes with some caramel sweetness. It's moderatly bitter with little in the way of yeast esters. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking Biere de Garde. It's true to style and full of character. Nice work."
"This is a good winter beer with good drinkability."
"not the most complex or robust, but the gentleness of the phenols and the lack of overly cloying sweetness typical of many bieres de garde, help with this beer's drinkability for sure."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" light beige head over the clear copper brew. Head recedes gradually, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is moderately sweet, with spicy yeast character. Taste is sweet upfront, lightly spicy in the middle, which kicks up towards the end. Mouthfeel is clean, and drinkability is good. This one was discounted for being a ""leftover"" of the Xmas season. I'll a 20% discount on this any day."
"Excellent beer."
"On-tap at The Farmhouse in Emmaus. This isn't far removed from a Belgian pale ale or amber, but there's a little something extra in the flavor. It's a literally flowery, like rose petals. Beyond that, the beer has an array of subtle flavors that range from dry biscuity malts to light citrus rind hops, and fruity caramel. This beer is not the richest, but the mellow complexities are quite nice. Certainly worth a try."
"Rich and malty, billowing to encompass the taste buds. A lot of people taste this as dry, it doesn't seem overly dry to me, but it does seem nice and crisp. Not too overly sweet even though there is a strong malt component, with not a lot of hops on the other end of the spectrum. A little thin in the middle, not much to bridge the gap after the initial malt. Tastes some of strawberry, peach, mild fruit. High drinkability as expected, it all blends together fairly well. I had no expectations going in to this, but now that I've tried it, I'm impressed. It isn't amazing, but what I presume to be a pretty good representation of a dry, yet sweet ale."
" I thought the ABV% was a bit higher than the actual 6.60% of this beer. Maybe because it's a holiday beer and I expect them to be a bit stronger and celebratory in nature. No matter...this is very easy to enjoy on a night like this and worth a try once for someone who wants to celebrate the holidays witout overloading on spice or alcohol. A great beer to start the new year off with!"
"I remember taste testing this against the Harpoon warmer with the owner's brother at the filling station. I liked the texture of this one as opposed to the spiciness of the Harpoon. This one has a thick, syrupy coating and a smooth, warm, fruity finish. This improves as it warms, with hints of apple and grapes but a light, delicate flavor, in contrast with the mouthfeel. A touch more carbonation would probably help but that could have been lost in the growler fill or the four days it took me to open it. Very good, not great but worth trying."
"Handsome malty-brown color with a bubbly head; quite malty in the nose with definite overtones of peach and strawberry, maybe even raspberry. The taste had less fruit than the aroma but was still very fruity with apples and plenty of malt before a light but sharp hops whack at the end. Decent body with light carbonation; very brisk and tangy. Despite the ABV, I didn't find the alcohol to be particularly present. A decent find, not spectacular but quite nice, especially the berries in the aroma."
"D: quite good. i hope there's some left."
"Crystal clear copper with a fizzy beige cap that settled into a solid collar and thin skim of bubbles. A bit sticky with decent head retention. Biscuit malt aroma with a hint of caramel, stone fruits, and light hop aroma. Very mellow. Low bitterness with light caramel sweetness and some grain character, less fruitiness than in the aroma but still with a nice peach undertone. Hops and a bit of spice appeared in the finish, perhaps a hint of warmth too. Lingering herbal hop notes. Medium bodied yet just short of a sticky, viscous texture. Ample carbonation gave it a lightness without the fizzy rush of overcarbonation. Very well balanced, quite elegant overall. Very drinkable and quite tasty."
"Overall a very solid little beer here, something I would have no problem at all enjoying a little more often. Quite nice and a winner at the party tonight."
"A little bit of this goes a long way, but have to say I really enjoyed this one. It reminds me a bit of the Mad Elf, though there's not as much cherry flavor. This is a great beer for the winter. Very good stuff."
"The guy at the beer store told me this beer was flying off the shelf. I decided to try it since I like trying local brews. Pours a nice amber in to a tulip glass, shwoing off it's clarity as well. Not much in aroma, mostly bready, but not offensive. Sweetness dominates at first, but becomes more structured after the first few sips. Hints of some kind of herb. Very well made, shows it's a substantial brew by the way it sits on your tounge, with a nice long aftertaste. Highly recommended and a bit different."
"Drinkability: The version I am drinking is a contract brewed bomber that says ""French Style Christmas Ale"" on the label; perhaps the recipe has changed over time but I view this more in the Winter Warmer camp than a Biere de Garde, despite what the label says; having said that, I really enjoyed this beer"
"Drinkability is extremely good, with a great taste, lighter and dry, it goes down very easily. Still, it's got enough depth that pondering is rewarded. Refreshing and satisfying, it paired well with the left-over turkey - perhaps not perfect (a bit to brawny), but very tasty. I also tried it in direct comparison to an at least 1.5 year old bottle of Sans Culotte, it was so vastly superior I couldn't have another sip until I had savored the last drop of this."
"I will try as much of this as I can"
"Overall, this was an interesting beer that I may just need to get familiarized with the style."
"Thoroughly enjoyable brew, and I will definitely seek this out again."
"Out of the 22oz bomber. Pours an exceptional clear and pretty copper color, nice fluffy egg shell colored head that settled fairly quick into a light ring. The aroma is fairly light, a sweet toasted malt with a touch a hoppy spice. The taste is of a toasted malt with a sprucey hop bite, lemon rind and a tart cranberry like fruitiness. The brew sits well on the palate, slightly chewy, prickly carbonation, finishes with a spicy sweetness. A nice and spicy biere de garde, more of a hoppy spice than yeasty spice."
"M&D--Expert stuff here. Lively bubbles lighten the load of the barley and the alcohol is well-masked. Perfect beer for a fire!"
" Notes: I got a good beer for my money. No complaints here as it was easy to drink and a pleasure to have. I felt that style wise they got a little creative,but it was done well and I enjoyed it."
"They did not nail the style, likely intentionally. A fine Belgian near sticky yeasty ale with good malting and a significant but not bold spiciness. Fairly easy to drink after a warm (finally) day and went well with the food. Lightly orangey with lots of foamed bubbles. In a word, sweetish Belgian yeast."
"My bottle is in a 750 mL bottle. It has a red label and it says Joyeux Noel 2007 French Country Christmas Ale a Biere de Garde-style Stong Ale. Just thought I'de mention that since there seems to be a lot of variety."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy golden orange/mahongny color, high carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy tan head, you are left with some nice small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly yeast, spicy, apples, blueberries, and some caramel. The taste is tangy/sweet, malty, fruity, with some caramel. The finish is dry, with a nice bitter finish. Medium body, a very nice well rounded/complex brew. Very drinkable, this is an awesome brew, I'm starting to really like this style. Highly recommended."
"I seem to almost be disapointed with Southhampton beers on tap, I've never been to the brewery, but I'm almost always happy with their bottled product"
"This just may be the prettiest beer I've laid eyes on. And the better news is that laying my mouth on it was quite a pleasure as well. It has mellow twists and turns, an intriguing yet innocent complexity, and a cozily manageable ABV that makes drinking it damn near an Elysian dream. Words can't thank The Man adequately, so I'll let my actions speak volumes and try to get my tongue to the bottom of the glass."
"M/D: Mouthfeel was great - medium to high levels of carbonation. I could feel the brew on my tongue for quite a while after swallowing, a sensation I rather enjoyed. Drinkability was very low - I enjoyed the brew a bit at the beginning, but the beer was just way too harsh on the palate. Stinging."
"Bottom line: Here's a brew that's so different from anything I've tasted before, it's scary but...don't be afraid to try it. The adventure is worth it!"
"2005 750ml bottle. Damn that was one of the loudest pops of a champagne cork I have ever heard. Needless to say, it left a mighty noisy and active head. It took a while to settle down. Surprise to see it so clear. Nice amber color. Pleasant nose of caramel and sour cherries/cranberries. Subtle but obvious spices  white pepper, nutmeg maybe ginger. All of this is very light but not impossible to taste- better as it warms. A good interpretation of the style."
"**I hope I have this Beer Review entered properly. If so it seems to me that the listed entry is very confusing (I almost missed it) and ass-backwards being as the Biere de Garde is the prominent text and the smaller text French Farmhouse Style Ale is in much smaller text below that. And I cannot find any mention of the word Christmas Ale anywhere!!! Someone needs to alter the way this beer is listed to avoid duplicate entries I feel."
"On tap at Half Time in Poughkeepsie, NY, we brought home a growler for, what else, Christmas. However, we couldn't wait, so we gave ourselves an early gift. The French Country Christmas Ale poured a rich and deep reddish amber with a thin khaki head. Grassy, but in a fresh sweet way, and hoppy to the nose, there is also a hint of maple syrup underneath. Frankly, I found the taste a touch thin and static--a disappointment, really, given what I found to be the complexity of the aroma. The malts dominated (figs, prunes?), the taste settled smoothly, but it never evolved, and the carbonation seemed too demanding."
"Overall: Fantastic! I've had a lot of good beers lately, but this one is truly superlative. The flavor has so much in it, and I'm still tasting little delicious apricot notes twenty minutes after finishing. Quite a beer."
"I had this with thanksgiving dinner. While a good match, more herbal characteristics (which may have been there but I thought I was imagining them) would have made it a better thanksgiving match."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, spritzy, light and easy to drink. A tasty treat that I could no doubt drink all day. Easily the best Biere De Garde I have ever tasted. Definetly a brew worth seeking out and another fine accomplishment from Southampton. I'm very glad I still have another bottle of this one for future enjoyment."
"Autumnal in color, with an expansive, creamy off-white head. The aroma contains more of a roasted, caramel malt character than I would have expected from other samplings of the style. It is offset, however, by a slightly musky straw-like scent and a hint of grapey sharpness. Caramel malt is strong in the flavor as well, and blends nicely into a subtle woody flavor at the finish. A bit sweet at the start, this beer develops a lot of complexity throughout the sip, including a (mostly) grapey fruitiness and a slightly alcohol-spiced finish. Full in the mouth, yet not at all overwhelming. This is a delightfully drinkable beer."
"Notes: This beer is nothing like Southampton's other Biere de Garde, Biere De Mars. The Mars is lighter (both appearance and taste-wise) and has much more fruit and hop flavor."
"Many thanks to MJR for the kind present. 2004 edition from 750 ml."
"Pours with a radiant orange hue and clean white head. Subtle and small carbonated bubbles remind us of handcrafted qualities. Sour fruit front followed by clean, dry, earthy finish."
"Superb white head, fully laced thrones above the sandy murky amber robe. Peaceful and balanced aroma in which no flavour takes the top on another. The bready yeast gently integrates peppery edges among the generous biscuity malt. Applesauce, grapes and pear reminiscent fruit notes unveil a vinous earthiness that evolves into serious cork notes, not in an unpleasant way in the nose, but perhaps a bit brash in mouth. Quite tart and clovey, the taste is pretty much in line with the aroma, theres just more sourness than youd expect. Not as impressive as most Southampton, but still one of the good Bière de Garde Ive had, so few have been as impressive as my enthusiasm for discovering more from this elegant style."
"Appears a fairly clear bubbly amber with a tall tan head. The head stays at about a half inch cap fluffy cap the whole time, while leaving rings of lace. Aroma is a bit musty and funky with a good amount of fruitiness and spices. There is a bit of sweetness as well and yeast as well. Taste is pretty strong with spice and the musty funk. A bit doughy and there is a slight tartness towards the end. Quite a variety of flavors in the mix here. There is also a slight spicy hop bitterness and this finishes with a lingering spice and funk. Mouthfeel was crisp and bubbly with loads of carbonation. This keep me coming back for more to try and figure out all the flavors. Overall an interesting complex and tasty brew I would definitely have again. Good stuff thanks for the bottle steve."
"Overall, it's a bit darker and more caramel-accented than most of the larger, commercially available brands; but it's certainly far from authentic. This is exactly the type of beer that you might find from a smaller house-brewery along the northern border. Very well done! Enjoy it with venison or a darker meat alongside lightly buttered vegetables on a cool night; or as a relaxing goblet as the sun goes down on a warm summer's night."
"Dark peach colored with a pale beige tinted head. This dissapates to a fine persistant sheen. Herbal fruity nose. Inital taste of tropical fruit touched by metalic sweet malts and grapefruits. the finish also has hints of nutmeg, sour plums and cinnamon. Quite complex but quite medium bodied. A nice regal selection."
"This is a great beer, but after spending about a month in France over the summer and becoming very familiar with the biere de garde style, I think they definately missed the style on this one. There just isn't enough toasted malt flavor and there is a little too much tartness. Still very good though, whatever style it is."
"Smooth and crisp at the start, with a smooth mildly tart finish. Nicely drinkable and quite enjoyable while sipped over a period of time."
"The taste is much different than the nose, or at least I was lead to believe the beer would taste quite a bit different than it does. The taste is quite malty with a finish that reminds me of biscuits and lightly toasted whole-grain bread. There is almost a chalky quality to the palate of this one, it seems to boost the body and make this beer seem a bit fuller. This is certainly interesting, I was expecting much more yeast character; more fruitiness, and more spiciness. This is one of those Biere de Garde's that goes for the cleaner flavor profile and relies more upon the malt character. The malts in this beer really shine, without the amped up malts this would be a flabby beer because of the restrained yeast character. As this beer warms up I get some nice fruitiness up front, with notes of pear and apple."
"It pours a beautiful copper/amber that is mostly clear and has a nice head and some decent lacing. The aroma is mostly earthy hops, but there is a faint woodiness to it as well as some detectable malt. It has a good malt backbone and is slightly tart with some cedar/wood notes and a dry, bitter finish. This is fantastic. I wish I bought more bottles of this beer."
"Overall, a well-crafted and delicious example of a rare style that rarely finds its students sticking to the guidelines."
"Too damn good. This is *absolutely* what the Trois Monts ""Grand Reserve"" should be."
"All in all a tasty brew that I'm very happy to have tried."
"an excellent version....highly recommended."
"Flavor is much less sour than expected, with a pervasive belgian candi sweetness, coupled with hints of pineapple, apricot, and raisin. The beer starts out mildly sour, tapering down to a saccharine sweetness, and finishing fairly dry. Impressive in the way it changes flavors so seamlessly. Light alcoholic warmth in the throat, and almost no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is terrific, with small, tightly knit bubbles. Very authentic, better than the imported versions I've tried thus far. The hops are wierd. They taste almost like hallertau, but not quite. Herbal, but strange. Must be a breed I'm not familiar with. Very good beer. A pleasure to drink."
"I must say thanks to herbjones for sharing this with me. This pours a cloudy orange with a big white head. The flavors, the aroma, are like wet grass, barnyards, etc. For me, these characteristics aren't too appealing. I just didn't like this beer. Oh well."
"Cloudy, murky beer. Light brown in color. The aroma is weak. There's almost nothing there. If you whiff real hard, you can catch some hints of fruit, but it's a chore. Tastes primarily of cherry. Smooth. Good mouthfeel. As the beer drains, it creates a sour taste in the mouth. Kind of like drinking milk."
"A front porch baguette and cheese eatin' brew. Pours a clouded streaming amber under whipped butter. Monumental nose of honeysuckle in full bloom, beach walks at dusk and fruit-flavored marshmallows. A draught is honey-roasted peach on barn board with a side of soil covered garden greens and fallow field stones. I mean earthy, like when you were a kid and played in the lake and dug in the dirt and ate roasted corn and tasted the day on your lips. Playful across the buds. A fine brew. Thanks Loren!"
