"O: This is an interesting Bière de Garde and seems to share some properties that you would expect from a Belgian Strong Dark Ale (except for the higher alcohol content)."

"on tap at j. ryans downtown syracuse. the pour is clear amber to cranberry juice in color, with the red hues really glowing. there is only a finger or two of lacey tan head, but it fades out in a few minutes. the nose is really remarkable, entirely unfamiliar. i smell some purple grape juice or must, the essence of fresh cherries, but nothiing sweet at all. theres also a rich caramel malt sweetness and something curious with the yeast as well, mildly but uniquely spiced. the flavors are really fruity up front, again with what seems to be grape being the most obvious. some spice in there as well, it isnt clove or allspice, but has a peculiarly holiday vibe to it. i appreciate this beers strange but comforting flavor profile, much apart from anything ive ever tasted. mouthfeel is a little odd for me. i would like either more body or more bubbles in this beer. without the body, it feels thin and watery, and without the bubbles, it lacks the pep needed to make a thinner beer feel good going down. that is definitely the weakness here. overall though i am so glad i got one of these, because while it is certainly a christmas beer, there is something unlike any other christmas beer about it, and that originality really makes its something to behold."

"The pour is amber in color with a tall off-white head. Sweet caramel and toffee with a little bit of sugar. Lots of dark fruits on the nose, too. There is a touch of spice and maybe some apples. The flavor is fairly sweet. Mostly sugar with some caramel. A decent amount of dark fruits, especially raisins and plums. Not bad at all."

"O: Pleasant to drink, but it does not knock my socks off."
"O: Too me there was a lot missing here, but maybe that's what they were going for. Not sure, but can't say I'd come back to this again. Another possibility is that it might just need to be enjoyed fresh."
"O: It's alright. Pretty drinkable, not exceptional. Might as well try it if you find one."
"O: Overall, an enjoyable, drinkable, pleasant (if mediocre) beer. The sticker price is the kicker -- $3.99 for this bottle is a steal. Highly recommended if you can find it for a comparable price (I got mine at a Total Wine & More). I might buy another one next season."
"Overall – very interesting brew, more intriguing than I thought it would be. Not a bad taste either."
"Overall: Not great. Not awful. Worth trying."
"Fuller bodied than expected with a nice balance of zesty spice, funky yeast, earthy hops, dark fruit and sweet malt.  A touch of bitterness up front followed by peppery spice that lingers over a slight medicinal character into a dry finish.  Hints of dark cherry with a nice malt backbone coutering the fruit/sweetness.  Hints of caramel malt and biscuit toward the finish.  Complex and much more flavorful than expected."
"A nice salad beer."

"Years ago I thought the Jenlain (Duyck) beers were the best in France, either I've changed my taste, or they've changed their beers!"
"Overall: Each sip was a bit worse than the last. Frankly, I was quite glad to be done with it and, no, I didn't get through the entire bottle. Nothing resembling a quality Bière de Garde here at all."
"Pours a murky semi-opaque dark iced tea color with a tiny 1/2 tan head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. A few stands of random lace on the drink down. Smells of muted caramel, malt, and some citrus juices. Taste is of caramels, biscuity malt, and some light grapefruit flavors on the finish. There is no bitterness whatsoever with this beer. Very light but lively carbonation. Somewhat sticky and coating in the mouth. Overall, a good holiday offering that is still very tasty months after its release."
"Interesting beer. Not what I'd usually consider a Christmas beer, I'd actually prefer something like this in the summer, with its zingy citron and lemon notes married to a bit of brown sugar and bitter orange. Whenever, I'd enjoy this. It pours an orangey amber with a fairly short head that fades to a thin cap. The aroma is pure orange juice with a bit of spice at the end. The taste reminds me of an English lemon barley water. A bit soupy with grain, but in a light sort of way and with a nice citrus overlay that is quite refreshing. It starts out lemony, but as it opens up it tastes more of tangerine and orange with hint of spice. Quite nice. Perhaps a tad too light and seltzery in the mouthfeel, but ovarall this is a nice refresher- but not what I'd be looking for in a winter brew."
"notes od candied sugar, victory malt and complex hop finish. Subtle residual caramel flavoring and impressive belgian lacing. Beer appears to be dry hopped with multiple hops. Light and creamy on the toungue with a distinct after taste. Definitely worth a try, but not worth seeking out"
"d - A below average beer with a slight metal smell and taste. Wouldn't seek out again."
"A lighter, bubblier Christmas ale. Brilliantly clear ruddy copper with an off white head that disappears with little traces on the glass. Smell is quite different. Ginger and citrus with a sweet light caramel and a bit of malt. Taste is sweet and orangey. Spiced chai tea with ginger and sugary sweet malt. Light, well carbonated feel is crisp on the tongue. As it warms the the sugary caramel mellows and blends into the malt structure. Dry clean finish. Hops are subdued to say the least. Refreshing and quite drinkable. Like a sweet lager. Not in the usual holiday mold but then again it is French. Vive le difference!"
"I'm going to forgo the usual detailed review, because I only took a few sips of this beer before dumping the rest (and that's hard for such an expensive beer). The caramel sweetness was overpowering. Unbearably cloying. Seems like an unsuccessful homebrew that hasn't finished attenuation. Consider yourself warned."
"D - Fantastic. This is one of the best balanced spice beers I've had in a while. I also appreciate the use of a lager yeast that adds lightness to the body. Great job on this one jenlain!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Poured a dark copper color, a very thin bubbly head that didn't last long at all. Constant streams of bubbles rose from the bottom. Aroma was very slightly sweet, with earthiness. A touch of malty, with evident alcohol aromas. Taste was very mellow, slightly sweet, small amounts of citrus flavors. Tad of olives and hops flavors. Felt strange in the mouth. Coated well, but left an awkward texture in the mouth. Definitely a beer to sit and sip. Lingering makes it ok to drink, but need to savor."
"While it is in the Bière de Garde style, it seems to lack holiday spirit. Drinkable enough to finish the bottle, but would not seek another."
"D - A pretty good beer overall definitely not like most Christmas beers but not in a bad way worth checking out if you want a different Christmas beer"
"Pretty solid atmosphere on this one. Appearance is better than average, and the nose is really pleasing although I could see how you could get too much of it quick. Good thing this is only a Christmas brew. Flavor is pretty basic, nothing overwhelming, but nice combination of flavors it does sport. Overall, this is a pretty solid quaff."
"Nice stuff. Would likely order this again."
"Drinkability: Interesting beer overall even if I can't really place it, as Biere de Garde doesn't seem to mean much here."
"D-Haven't had many beers in this style and didn't know what to expect. I guess I thought it might be a little richer tasting. A nice new style of beer for me. Enjoyable. Similar a little to a saison which is not one of my favorite styles. Overall this is a solid beer and an enjoyable one to try but not one I would want again."
"this beer pours a crystal clear amber color with a nice dense off white head. the aroma shows off it's farmhouse pedigree, along with a bit of fruit esters. the taste really produces on the fruit flavor, but is lacking in the spiciness that I would hope for in this sort of beer. the body is a good full body with adequate co2, but missing the alcohol bite that could've put it over the top. not a bad beer but could've been better."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry and slightly fruity scent as well as a mild crystal malt aroma. The taste is average. It has a thin and watery crystal malt flavor that does have some light nuttiness in the finish, but overall is dry and boring. It's a bit fruity with some light musty character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average beer, but nothing too great, especially for a once a year offering."
"Drinkable but very worth passing up."
"Drinkability: A very unusual beer that, while both sweet and tart, is nicely understated; other than the aftertaste, this is quite nice"
"Conclusion: This is an ODD, earthy, tart, fruity beer...but it's kind of tasty and unique at the same time. I might give this one another shot next Christmas."
"Overall- The deep robust fruitiness make this a good desert beer."
"D - This is really an exceptional Bière de Garde. I'm always found of the continental approach of making stronger (imperial is perhaps an inappropriate descriptor though) versions of their standard beers to be interesting. This one doesn't disappoint. While I've had other tasty Bière de Garde from other French breweries, Jenlain is the international standard and it is rightly deserved as exemplified in this beer."
"Poured into my Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass a nice cloudy golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/creamy off-white head, there's some nice sticky/creamy lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, nice touch of floral. The taste is sweet, malty, with some yeast, very slight citrus. Medium body. Very drinkable, this brew goes down very easy, highly recommended."
"I'm not sure what else to say. The fact that I spent $7.99 on this '750' makes me want to cry. If you see Jenlain Noel on the shelves, run screaming in the other direction as fast as your legs will carry you. You're welcome."
"Overall, a decent bier de garde. The orange adds a nice flavor for the season. I found I had consumed most of the bottle without really thinking about it - very easy to drink."
"Despite the flavors, this beer has held up really well if it is a 2005 bottling. Certainly not the greatest beer, and even fresh I have a feeling it was not all that great. It is somewhat refreshing, but a bit too simplistic and a bit to sharp in the finish."
"d: overall a pretty enjoyable beer with nice spice present but perhaps not the most festive beer on the ,arket in terms of taste. an overall good brew."
"Review translated from french 5-27-2008."
"Beer is good. Happy French beering."
"Pours clear dark amber with half-inch of thin off-white head. Recedes rapidly to a blanket of foam, excellent lacing. The aroma is peculiar and not very appealing. Musty white pepper notes are dominant, with tinges of metallic hop lurking in the background. Flavor is much like the nose. Lots of musty white pepper all the way through with unpleasant metallic hop notes bringing up the rear. Body is light with plenty of carbonation; somewhat acerbic in the finish. Not good at all."
"The drinkability of this was not that high, the orange got to be a little much. I'm not sure if they used artificial flavor or some type of rich orange variety that I'm unfamiliar with, but it was a little syrupy tasting after a while (though not in body) Still, a good experience and nice change of pace for a Noel. I'll cellar one to see if time tempers the orange."
"Drinkability: I found this to be enjoyable and a bit different from the other xmas beers on the market. Worth giving it a try."
"So I bought this one with great interest. Very similar to its sister (brother?) beer. And it definitely is a tasty beer, but to me, the added spices, the higher alcohol content (and associated roughness to the mouthfeel and drinkability) take this down a notch. I like this, it's enjoyable, but not as good."
"Pours out a pretty copper body with a steady stream of carbonation coming from the center of the chalice. Not much of a head. Starts with a punch of orange juice in the nose with aromas of vanilla, toasted malty bread, and some alcohol. Again, with the flavors, I get a creamsicle like flavor up front which is followed by loads of toasted malt, dried fruit, and a little alcohol. I get noble hops in the finish and a lingering flavor of raisin bread. Too much orange, though. Mouthfeel is moderate to slightly thick and has a soft carbonation made up of tiny bubbles. Tasty beer, but the orange presence can be a bit much to make this something I'd want a lot of. I got tired of the orange real quick."
"Taste is balanced and even, orange candy kind of floats in and isn't too sweet or cloying. Nice malty backbone, even mouthfeel. A butterscotch/diacetyl taste rides through in the aftertaste. A bitter/metal note is the only element out of place, otherwise it's a great seasonal quaffer."
"Taste is a nice biscuity malt followed by the unusual floral hops. Far less dominant in the flavor the hops. Finishes surprisingly clean with a crisp hoppy finish. Mouth is medium. Only faint hops in the aftertaste. Really good and really drinkable. I could recommend this beer for the aroma alone."
"D: Interesting beer. Becomes a bit too much after a while but fun while it lasted."
"Overall: Brewed only once a year and pretty much the Jenlain Ambrée with a little supercharging on the malts and hops. Very nice though and great value at $6½.for once."
"I saved this beer for Thanksgiving and man was that a good call on my part. This beer goes very well with everything at the traditional table from salad to pumpkin pie. In fact, I think it may have matched the pumpkin pie the best. I was really amazed at the versatility of this beer at the table. I'll definately be picking up another few bottles of this for next year. It is hard to say what the aging did for it since I never had it young, but I suspect that orange flavor might have been a tad much when fresh."
"Not like any saison I've ever had. Not sure I like this one, though I don't hate it either."
"Drinkability: surprisingly well-balanced. Not at all what I was expecting (something fruity and sickly sweet), which wound up being a good thing, but not great in its own right, either."
"just a very good balanced taste profile beverage that worked for my friend and I for supper. Orange taste was apparent and not over the top. A nice biere de garde, moderated spicey taste overall , some citrus, not too bitter nor sweet perhaps it was aged some."
"As the label claims, this is a special biere de garde ""ambree"" with a ""new orange flavor."" The citrus is most defined in the bouquet, which has a pleasant orange character. Otherwise this brew pours a light amber and has a light, spritzy body on the tongue. There are fairly pronounced citrus and biscuit flavors too, but they are never quite able to overcome the fizziness of the mouthfeel. It is then, an imbalanced mouthfeel that proved to be this beer's biggest drawback. Drinkability is average, though, I doubt that I would be interested in exploring this brew further to have more than one glass."
"Pours a dark reddish color with a quickly disappearing white head. Smell is of orange peel and some spice. Taste is sort of like watered down orange pop, which isn't a good thing. This could have been so much better, but it wasn't. Mouthfeel was thin, with medium carbonation. I didn't really care for this one, I would maybe try it again in a very distant future."
"It was worth a try, but probably not worth another try for a while."
"Looks and tastes like kiddy champagne, like the apple or white grape stuff that you give to ten year olds at New Years, only this stuff tastes and looks like orange Jello. I will hand it bitterness. This beer definitely has some great bitterness both in nose and MF. That part of the orange tastes real. Otherwise this fits perfectly into Frances love for crappy, fruity light beers to guzzle and get tanked on. This is just candy."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, label in languages besides English, says something about consuming before some date (I think) but I can see no dates.something about Jenlain never makes sense to me, maybe its the green bottles or the fact that the bottles allways seem to be slightly underfilled. Anyway, I digress, this one pours almond amber, cloudy, with a tan head, at first puffy, then fading to a 1/8 inch film and leaving plentiful stringy lacing. Aromatic nose of concentrated orange juice and cloves. More orange notes, soft mouthfeel, taste fades in the finish, worth a try, but nothing great, there are better and more interesting christmas brews and saisons out there"
"Copper, with ample foam. Unpleasant aroma of corn, strawberry, lemon, orange gummy bears, caramel and dying flowers. Upon tasting, sickly sweet and only bareable in tiny baby sips. Tastes of melting plastic, orange seasoning, spice and toasted malts. Yikes."
"750 ml bottle, corked and caged. Purchased at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee. Jenlain Biere de Noel pours out a clear amber color with a sizable head. Fruity orange aroma, and a little minty. Malty and fruity flavor. Light biscuit flavor. A metallic hoppiness comes in at the finish. Just a bit of a woody flavor. Neither sweet nor bitter. There's no sign of the 6.8% abv. I really enjoy the real orange flavor, but other than that this is just a standard amber ale. Still, this is a pretty good deal at $5.70 for a 75 cl bottle."
"This is a great beer that I would gladly serve to family and friends. A complex beer that has some lager characteristics. What a wonderful drinking experience."
"The mouthfeel is the weakest link here. This doesn't really seem like a saison in any way, shape, or form; but I still think it is a hell of a good, drinkable beer. I will surely buy more of this before stock runs out. It is too good of a deal to pass up."
"750 ml corked and bailed green bottle. $6.75 at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA."
"The beer upon its pour from the 750ml green caged and corked bottle sets in my glass a luminous dark copper color with the head mastodonic in size, semi-creamy in texture and the color a nice light tan, after its destruction, a velum like sheet of lace surrounds the glass. Nose has a hint of chocolate and over ripe black cherries, also a touch of mushrooms, pleasant and appealing with the start sweet and the grain profile adequate with the top light to medium in feel. Finish has a disturbing acidity with the hops prickly in their spiciness, somewhat vinous, dry as a bleached desert bone, and a nice change of pace for me."
"Pours a very,very nice reddish color. Almost looks like a pale burgundy wine. Good sized head and a very nice carbonation level. Great aroma of orange and a hint of chocolate. Theres a somewhat cork aroma-almost wet cardboard like. Malty flavor again with the orange. Slight oak flavor. Theres some spiciness as well as a vinuous flavor in the backround. Nice bright mouthfeel-almost has a refreshing feel to it. A very drinkable holiday beer. Well worth seeking out."
"Moderately rotund in the mouth with a stunted carbonation. This is a fantastic biere de garde, nearing the standards and subtle greatness of the Jenlain original (in that it sacrifices jaw-dropping attributes for a round tastiness and all-togetherness), if perhaps lacking its anytime, any place drinkability."
"25cl. bottle: This beer pours a crystal clear amber color. There was a bit of a tan head that lingers for awhile. Some spices and notes of orange to the nose. The taste is a bit spicy, with notes of the orange. A medium malty body backing it up. Not bad for a French supermarket beer."
"Backwash: I was quite surprised (and happy) to come across this at the bottom of a crate of miscellaneous wines. Although Shelton Brothers is expected to bring this back to the USA, along with some of Duycks regular offerings, I havent seen the Christmas version of this beer for a long time. I hope this does return, as its probably Duycks best offering, improving upon the already good regular bière de garde. Although only 0.3% stronger, this is a much richer, warming beer, with a great deal more complexity than the standard expression. I dont remember what I paid for this, but I dont think it was much more than the $3.49-$3.99 that the regular 750's sold for. This price is likely to go up with the Euro and the passage of time, but Im sure this will remain a bit of a bargain. This was one of the earliest Christmas beers I can remember being readily available, and its still one of the better ones. Now if only Sheltons' would bring in the minikegs..."
