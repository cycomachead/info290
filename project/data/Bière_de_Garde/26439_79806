3.82,0.8,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured at Oyster Co in Portland. This is a pleasant surprise as I am a little hung over so a 4 percent beer this morning is just right. An hour from now I will require 7 percent minimum. Normally not a huge farmhouse ale lover,but this was nice. Pours a nice copper color with an Oxbow glass - nice touch. Yeasty floral smell and the taste very much delivers. I like this a lot and still feel good. Since it is only 4 percent, can have two more","BradMacMullin","Jan 30, 2014"

3.76,-0.8,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured on-tap at the Thirsty Pig in Portland. Served in a snifter, the beer is a hazy, orange-brown coloring with a frothy, foamy white head. Nose of floral highlights, with a tangy sweet caramel backbone. Flavors of floral and spice all over the palate, light and slightly sour. Biscuit and clove, jasmine and oregano, all very balanced. Very herbal throughout. Light and crisp bodied while you drink, with a tangy sweet and spicy aftertaste. Clean, fruity, farmhouse finish. Very clean and very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Mar 28, 2013"
