"Overall meh, probably my least fav beer from them yet. Nothing really fun about this beer, too sweet syrupy with way too much booze and the spices are OK but not great for what it is. There are so many better places this beer could have gone."

"o: Not bad as a holiday time brew, dominated by a combination of fruit and caramel malt notes.  But the  result isn't far from resembling a lightweight cough syrup, which both I and my daughter found a bit offputting.  But we drank it all nonetheless. 3.5"
"22 oz. bottle from a Sat., 12/20/2014 Better Beer Authority Bottle Share (thanks, Richard H..), unknown vintage (likely 2014), poured into a *** 2014 ""Holiday Extravaganza"" snifter glass, drank over 15 minutes"

"Fun & favorable; a nice seasonal beer."
"Creamy flavor with light malt (a bit of crystal?) .  Surprisingly thin body but the carbonation is very low, almost flat.  This beer does not have the sour or earthy tones I expect from a Bière de Garde.  I find this one to be far more drinkable than most."

"Two Roads's Holiday Ale is a very typical winter style ale: deep, rich color coupled with a strong-but-not-too-strong taste and an aroma more on the fruit side. Good stuff."

"O: for me, there are better options;"

"Strong but good"

"This was a very enjoyable brew. I appreciated the subtleties of yeast aromas and different malts with the slight spice from the continental hops. Not a ""hit-you-in-the-face"" brew, but a delightful one nonetheless."
""
"One of the better brews from Two Roads that I've tried. This is worth picking up from your local package store in the large format to share with a friend."
""
"Strikes a balance between spices and a Belgian-feeling yeast. Fruits and caramelized sugars are fairly big but overall I think it finds its flavor well and delivers without relying on blatant, in your face flavors. A solid brew all around."

"Pours a mild brown with an off-white head that dissipates and leaves trails on the glass. The smell is sweet from the malt with scents of clove and walnuts. The taste was nice with heavy malt starting off and in the middle giving a very mellow and earthy tone to the beer while the finish had just enough hops for a refreshing crisp end. Liked this one a lot."

"22oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, coppery amber color. There was a small off white head that didn’t leave much lacing. The nose is good. A bit spicy: nutmeg and cinnamon, clove, faint malts. The flavor is quite good. A but bready and malty, with some of the spices in there. A faint earthiness to it. I’ll be looking for this again next year."

"Burnished copper colored with a rocky beige head of firm foam that slowly recedes. Low aroma of clovey yeastiness. Subtle toasted malt flavor, some bready notes, semi-sweet, clove and yeastiness. A peppery bite lingers. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Okay beer overall, could use a bit more depth of flavor."

"On tap at The Harp in Willimantic, CT. Poured into a Founders pint glass. Very earthy brown hue with almost no head or carbonation. No lacing in the glass. Looks and tates a bit like a barleywine with obviously less ethanol. Wonderful spicy cinnamon aftertaste with lots of roasted malt and a pinch of hops. Looking for an IPA alternative that goes well with both meats and dessert? I would definitely recommend this!"
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not to filling, good kick, good Americanized representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Overall: Nice to see Two Roads can do a malty big beer well. This was easily the maltiest of their offerings to date. A nice and complex holiday sipper. I will certainly get this again if it is on tap when I am in town."
