Smell is mild, a bit of honey. Taste is also mild, a bit bland even. Some floral notes, a bit of honey, no bad, but light. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and decent beer.","tone77","Aug 17, 2013"

3.37,-7.7,3.75,3.5,3.25,3,3.5,"The Crack released a good bit of effervescent beer and I waited for things to settle before CANtinuing. My subsequent Glug produced two fingers of rocky, tawny head with decent retention. Color was a deep-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was slightly musty with a honey sweetness underlying. Mouthfeel was on the watery side with a light fruitiness on the tongue. They mentioned apricot and nectarine on the CAN and I got the soft fruitiness, but I am unsure that I would have/could have identified those particular flavors. Finish was semi-dry and the yeast gave it a musty dustiness. I shared it with the Queen Bee inside of her hive and that made it worthwhile. It was not a terribly impressive beer and had I CANsumed it by myself, I might have been really disappointed.","woodychandler","Jul 22, 2013"

This doesn't have nearly as much of that as you'd expect in a described ""SOUR"" beer, but it has a nice character to it. Aftertaste is apple-istic (yes, I made that up) with malt. Not the best of the few BdG's I've had, but it's still a tasty beer, for sure.","Alextricity","Jul 11, 2013"

3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"16 ounce can into tulip glass, no canning date. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of honey, pear, apple, pepper, biscuit, banana, clove, herbal, floral, earth, and light yeast spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance. Taste of pear, honey, apple, bread, banana, pepper, clove, earth, herbal, floral, and light yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, honey, bread, herbal, earth, pepper, and light yeast spiciness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Malt sweetness overshadows the spicy yeast esters, but is not overly much at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian style ale. Well balanced with nice complexity; very smooth to drink. Very enjoyable offering, well done.","superspak","Oct 10, 2012"

3.79,3.8,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,4,"The carbontion is quite low, especially for a Belgian style. This puts the body into the upper midrange, even though it is not a sweet beer by any means. I had 5 or 6 [creative but average] beers at Vivant's ridiculously awesome brewery, and this one takes the cake. I think higher CO2 and more yeasty Belgian phenolics would take this to another level.","dpasotti","Aug 29, 2012"
3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer, I wouldn't really call it a Biere de Garde, but I would say that it is a good example of a Honey Ale, the honey stuck out the most and the malts and hops backed it up nicely and provided good balance. This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the flavor held my attention, but I think one would be enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the taste, I liked how great the nice honey flavors contrasted with the malts and hops, it had great balance and the mouthfeel was also noteworthy. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad and I didn't mind the tart and funky yeast but it just didn't come together as well as it could have. I might buy one more can of this years release, but it's a little expensive, so there's a good chance I wont be having it till next time they release it, I do recommend giving it a try, especially if you are a fan of Honey Ales. All in All this was a good and solid beer, it wasn't everything that I expected it to be but it all ended up coming together nicely, good job Brewery Vivant, I'm on board for the next special release, it's one kick ass series.","StoutHunter","Aug 26, 2012"

4.12,12.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D- The complexities are quite interesting. I had a couple of glasses during my visit, and I wouldn't mind having more. I don't know that this beer really fits the Biere de Garde category, though I don't quite know where I'd put it. The beer it most reminded me of was Trois Pistoles by Unibroue with strong, peppery qualities. While not as potent, maybe it's more of a Belgian dark ale?","GRPunk","Beers"
3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The mouthfeel is light and the drinkability is easy. Honey used during brewing adds some noticeable effects in the body and consistency of the ale. This is a tasty brew that is fit for sessioning. The style may be considered as something different, but currently the reviewer is unsure as to which categorization fits best.","SupaCelt","0"
