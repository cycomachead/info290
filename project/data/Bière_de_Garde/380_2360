3.74,-3.4,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"i dont remember any other beers in this style being quite so sweet, this one has a real lingering sugar content to it, almost distracting and certainly in the way of the more delicate grassy hops and the near saison type farmy yeast. i think the malt is a little heavy in this one, a little less cleaned up than it could be by a very cool yeast strain that has some traits of warmer fermentation with high tone fruit notes and again the sugar, maybe not quite done. still, its a real enjoyable beer, beautiful in the glass, and holding a head all the way, great carbonation, and a lot more body than i think the style calls for, as undefined as it still is. love the yeast flavor and the straw notes in this, i think its got late summer written all over it, but if this was even 20% drier, i think it would be a far better beer. still, nice to see some of the french stuff coming around, and i think it has some cool culinary applications. i enjoyed it with a black garlic and octopus dish at bittersweet on alameda, great spot, cool beer program.","StonedTrippin","Jan 25, 2015"

3.94,1.8,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Poured into a Gouyasse tulip glass. Pours a bright medium golden amber with a three finger white head that dissipates slowly, leaving tons of lacing. Aroma of bready malt, grassy, slightly floral hops and a hint of funk. Flavor begins with sweet malt, apple and pear juice, Belgian yeast, but then turns somewhat drier, finishing with light grassy hops and a more saison yeast flavor. Light to medium bodied with bright carbonation. An nice take on the biere de garde style. Flavor is somewhat subdued, but the flavor transition from sweet fruit to drier spritzer is quite nice. Very refreshing flavor and carbonation.","LiquidAmber","Oct 02, 2013"

Earthy hops are present, and the finish is light with a rather unpleasant Splenda-like artificial sweetness, along with a little bitterness, grassy in nature. Mildly fruity, there's a delicate interplay between citrus and light stone fruit here. Light in body with a fairly crisp carbonation, this is decent apart from the finish.

The taste is of pale malt, grainy sweetness, light honey and metal; unfortunately the funky yeast is subdued by the malt. Moderate feel, tingly carbonation; finishes quite neutral with a touch of a grassy hop. The brew starts off great but just coasts its way through. The rather bland malt crushes the yeast and muddles any of the nice flavors. There is no off flavors and is well made but is just ok.

Very easy drinking, and paired well with the apps we were eating. Not an overwhelming flavor, but a nice accompaniment to food.

Sweetness (pilner malts) is the lead character through the nose and flavors with a sturdiness, but no grainy flavors or bite. The hops bring out a light muskiness and barnyard-ey character, but not intense enough to greatly impact the beer. Feels like a firm pilsner, with hardly no tartness, sourness or astringency.

Although individual malt flavors aren't showcased, maltiness makes its presence known through a full, rich body and silky, dextrinous mouthfeel.  Light caramel malt and toasty Vienna are present as a trace.  Subdued clove phenol is the sole fermentation byproduct flavor in this otherwise clean and highly drinkable brew.  Although mild, an herbal, possibly Strisselspalt hop flavor is perceptible.  Malt notes reemerge in the lightly toasty and sweet finish.  Castelain is a highly drinkable and tasty brew.
