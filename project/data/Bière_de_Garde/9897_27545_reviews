"O:  Spicy beer with a nice bit of sour."

"Drinkin this with my buddy Max at Jester King brewery"
""
""
"Poured into my teku glass."
"O: Intense without sacrificing complexity to do so, this is an interestingly sour biere de garde. Would repeat."
""
"Based on a 2.5 year-old bottle"
""
"I was excited for this beer, and waited until it was Fall to try it. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver. Of all the different JP beers I have reviewed (about 12 of them), this to my memory seems the most watery and the least flavorful. The flavor itself is not bad, but the beer and the flavor just seem so watered down. What happened here Jolly Pumpkin?"

"Solid beer.  Would buy again."

"Sour, but not overly so. Very tasty"

"Spices are subtle, and really balance out the typical JP funkiness. Very good."

"Served in a pint glass on tap.  Pours out a light amber with a thin white head.  Smell has brett, funk, and cidery notes.  Flavor is lightly tart, funky, bretty.  Light sweetness up front.  Touch of caramel and dry cider.  Finishes dry.  Mouthfeel is light, prickly, acidic on the tongue.  Excellent beer from Jolly Pumpkin."

"Surprising gem, bought it because it was marked down from $16 to $8 and I knew nothing about the beer.  Enjoyed it very much, excellent and interesting beer."
""
"This is one of the first Beire de Garde's that actually moved me.  Had some barnyard funk going on in the smell and taste,but finishes dry instead of tart or sour.  Recommend this one.  Would definitely revisit as well."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not as complex and oak funk driven as other JP beers I've had but that takes nothing away from this warming fall brew.  Love the chestnut additions, really add a unique touch.  Extremely well executed scheme which is unsurprisingly considering the things this brewery is doing."
""

"3.95/5: This one encapsulates autumn far better than your typical pumpkin ale does"
""
""
""
"2013. Pours a hazy copper with huge cream colored head, fades slowly with tight rings of lace down the glass. Smell: caramel, nutty, nutmeg, maybe cinnamon and ginger as well, overripe peach, herbal oaky note. Taste: tart peach, zinfandel-ish, grape skin, mild toasted and nutty notes, herbal / oaky finish. This is very nice, more JP excellence."

"O: so glad I got this (on tap). Awesome brew with awesome flavors."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style and a good example of a Jolly Pumpkin beer with the yeast and oak showing up nicely along with some nice supporting flavors. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, pretty crisp, medium tart, not too acidic, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the right amount for me, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have a problem drinking a whole bottle and I think it would make for a nice beer to enjoy on a warmer fall date. What I like the most about this beer was the balance and complexity that showed up n the flavor, it took me a few sip to get all the different flavors that were showing up and they blended well together. What I liked the least about this beer was pretty much nothing, but I do wish the chestnut was noticeable. I would buy this beer again when it's released in the fall and I recommend it to anyone who likes Biere De Gardes or Jolly Pumpkin beers, it's a little pricey, but it's worth a try. All in all I was happy with this beer, I've had it a few times before and my score did not change at all, it's always been a solid 4 in my book and I always look forward to it in the fall. This isn't my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer, or Biere De Garde, but it's still a good beer nonetheless and I enjoyed drinking it. Good job guys, keep up the hard work."

"Pours a hazy, copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of floral notes, sweet malt, yeast, hops, alcohol, spices, hint of nut, grass, and slight tea notes. Fits the style of a Biere de Garde. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, hops, yeast, alcohol, spices, hint of roasted malt, grass, floral notes, hint of citrus, and slight fruit. Overall, the complexity in aroma and body is staggering; good blend, aroma, and body."

"This beer was really interesting. In the light on the bar this beer had a golden almost orange color to it. It had a fruity cherry/plum aroma mixed with the smell of corona (not from the bar, the smell was coming from the Jolly Pumpkin Beer). The mouth feel of the beer was interesting it started with some body to it that fades away on the tip of your tongue to a dry almost acidic like finish. The beer starts with that almost brett spicy funky flavor and then transitions to a light tart cherry flavor on the finish. Over all I enjoyed this beer it's not something that I want to session but it is a beer I would like to drink every now and then."

"O: An amazing and refreshing brew by JP. I love the fact that these are refreshing and interesting beers that you can drink all day everyday. If only my wallet would allow that. Regardless, a must try by JP and definitely getting hard to pick a favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I remember a time, not all that long ago, this style would have rubbed me the wrong way. I'm glad it has grown on me, because this is a fantastic brew I would have missed out on otherwise! Plenty of sourness here to please fans of Warhead and Sweettart candies, but complex enough to earn a nod from the most stubborn beer snob. Well worth your time and money."

"i love jolly pumpkin. we were spoiled to have their stuff on the shelf before the sour/wild ale craze really hit, and now with so many sub standard offerings on the shelves, its nice to revisit jolly pumpkin and taste how its all supposed to be again. delicious stuff this one, done with chestnuts. light brassy color, minimally cloudy, with a short lived fizzy tan head. the nose on this is a true wild ale, bretty and a little sour, with notes of roasted nuts and toffee. like a brittle, without the sweetness. the flavor starts off a little sour and a lot funky, bubbly and tart, but half way through it gives way to an earthy nuttiness that must be from both the malts and the chestnuts. its more like almonds or cashews in terms of flavor, but its pronounced and interesting along with the wild yeasts that creep back in towards the finish in a fizzy whirl of interesting autumnal flavors. i have always appreciated their special releases, cool new takes on seasonal ales, and this one too is excellent. i am going to continue to redrink their lineup, i forgot how much i like all this stuff."

"O: this has two facets of a good beer, nice and sour to begin, nice woody end; however, the combination fails overall, to me."
"Blend 2, bottled 10-04-2012. Bottle from Tipples. Pours a clear orange bronze color with fluffy white head and lots of effervescent bubbles coming up from the bottom. Aroma of pleasant spice, apples, pears, oak, brett. Gentle sour funk with light but not intruding background spice, apples, dry sharp oak finish. Light and easy drinking with lots of soft carbonation. Classic JP brew here."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/9/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart apple, lemon, pear, clove, pepper, coriander, caramel, bread, nuttiness, allspice, hay, grass, oak, light leather, funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of spice and yeast ester notes with moderate malt presence; and good strength. Taste of big tart apple, lemon, pear, clove, pepper, coriander, caramel, bread, nuttiness, allspice, herbal, hay, grass, oak, funk, light leather, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, clove, pepper, coriander, caramel, bread, nuttiness, allspice, oak, hay, grass, herbal, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of spice, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, lightly prickly, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wild biere de garde style. All around great balance and complexity of spice, yeast ester, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours a murky whitish-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, spice, and herbal aromas. Taste is much the same with herbal and medicinal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is much too herbal and medicinal forward for my liking."

"O - Not a beer I could drink over and over, but definitely one to sip slowly and enjoy on a Fall night. A unique taste."
""
""

"overall one of the weirdest beers ive ever tried. much unlike anything else, definitely worth a grab if you see it just to see what you get out of it. recommended."
""

""
""
"Super, super drinkable. Even though it's only about 6% ABV to begin with, there's no touch of alcohol in the taste. Great balance of tart and funk - this beer is as easy drinking as it can get for the style. You could easily crush a 750 mL bottle of this on your own and probably move on to another one right after. Jolly Pumpkin continues to do what they do best."

"Overall enjoyable just as I would expect, know some think they all taste the same JP brews that is, but I enjoy the funky flavors. Have yet to have a bad beer from these guys wish I could get this in town of well always something to look for when out of town."
"Taste: My first of the style, and... interesting. Cinnamon, fruit, sour, tart, sweet... it's all over the place and should be a mess, but it isn't. I've not had a beer like this before, and I'm glad to finally have gotten the chance to try some Jolly Pumpkin. It's a good beer that I'd buy in 12oz bottles, but I wouldn't ever see myself buying a 750ml."

"D - Great balanced and complex version of the syle."
"O - This is one of the better Jolly Pumpkin beers that I have tried. I like the tartness of it. It is quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O: I greatly enjoy sours, and most of Jolly Pumpkin beers for that matter. This is very near the top of the JP list. I will grab several of these each season. I certainly recommend this beer if you enjoy sours, especially ones that are not on the sweeter side."

"O= This is a solid beer. I grabbed it up when I heard that there was gonna be no more JP in MN. This is a nice brew and I hope to pick up a little more before she's totally gone."
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth, foamy mouthfeel that is never fizzy. Closes quite dry, with little residual stickiness remaining on the palate."

""
"O: I like this beer. I don't know if I could drink this all the time, but it's good."
"Nice beer. Unique spice and changes in flavor. The sour might put some people off, but I liked it."
""
""
""
""
"This is a delightful biére de garde, tasty and refreshing with a huge amount of flavor and low ABV at 6.1%. Mahalo indeed. It is a bit of autumn sunshine. It is best to leave the sediment in the bottle."
""
"Overall- another solid Jolly Pumpkin brew I always look forward to see what we get next here in OK and even though it might be old (not sure when batches go out for retail) its always good to see something seasonal thats a touch different."
""
""
"Single finger head on a hazy amber and orange body. Lots of fruits, nuts, spice and molasses in the aroma. Flavor follows that of a mild sour or wild ale with some dark fruits. Spices include nutmeg and cinnamon. Medium body, a little chewy with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. Nice degree of sourness with nice interaction between spice and fruits."
"Batch 902 Bottled 10-21-2011"
""
"Decanted into a tulip glass, a a honey-peach color that started slightly hazy and increased in haze factor as I got deeper into the bottle; moderate off-white head that retained decently. Typical sour/tart aroma expected from JP, woody, notes of light spice and mulled cider. A touch of biscuity malts and caramel in the taste are quickly overcome by a sweeping but not jarring sourness, lemon juice and apple pie, notes of indistinct spice; the label listed chestnuts as an ingredient, but I'm not sure I picked up any of that in the taste...if it was there, it was ""low in the mix"" so to speak. Medium body, prickly carbonation. As my wife doesn't care much for sour beers, I was easily able to conquer this whole bottle by myself. Exactly what I wanted. Cheers!"
"Overall this was another solid brew from Jolly Pumpkin. Would be very curious to try a fresh bottle but I would still recommend to anyone willing to pay the price for a bottle."

"Overall: Between this, Weizen Bam, Luciernaga, Oro De Calabaza, Maracaibo Especial, and Madrugada Obscura. I think my favorite so far is Fuego Del Otono. Beautiful bottle, beer, and people; (when I catch my reflection). Stay attractive...My friends!"
"O-well this is just delectable. There's something about it, I could drink this all night long! It's not too complex or bold but wow it has one of those mild flavor that make it nice for the long run!"
"Pours a slightly hazy dark orange topped by a tight, thin white foam. Delightful mix of aromas include cooked cinnamon apples, sweet dough, and hints of tart citrus fruit. Flavor is a meld of doughy malt but a sour component is also quite prevalent in the middle. Finishes with a nod towards sweet baked cookies and a touch of caramel. A bit funky too - barnyard and wet dog. Medium light in body, moderate to moderate high level of carbonation. Jolly Pumpkin is one brewery I've not sampled many beers from but I like what they've put together here."
""
"O:  As a fan of Jolly Pumpkin this was yet another treat. The fall theme really carries out throw the earthy and spicy flavors. Sour yet smooth and refined. The light feel  and the warming sensation is well executed.  Nice example of the style. "
"This really does remind me of fall. Light funk with good tartness. Not sure I could pick out the chestnuts. Delicate flavors and an inviting nose make this a joy to drink."
"O: Really nicely done. Biere de garde is one of my favorite styles and Jolly Pumpkin has done it justice with this concoction. Seek this brew out if you are new to sours or if you have found Jolly Pumpkin's other work to be too much for you."
"O - Solid beer from Jolly Pumpkin, but not up with my favorites. Still, I would have this again."

"#BOTG 78! Bottled 10-24-11. Poured from bottle into JK Farmhouse Ale glass. Pours a orange cloudy color. Decent head and retention, small bubbles coming up from the bottom. Smell- ripe oranges, funk, sour cherries. Some spice is there, but I can't put a name on what it is I smell. Taste- Nice huge sour blast. Sour cherries, I don't see where the chestnuts or spice is on this thing at all. This is a nice light sour."
""
""
""
""
""

"The palate opens moderately tart, with a lactic sourness and a lot of Brett-derived flavors - cloves, horseblanket, some pepper and a little leather are all present. They mesh rather wonderfully with the chestnuts, delicately toasted but arguably a little overdone. The spices play a secondary but important role here, complementing the Brett funk and the chestnuts. The combination also does bring to mind a little crystallized ginger. Actual oak flavors are minimal here. Drying, mildly tart on the finish with a blend of yogurt-like lactic acids blended with clove, horseblanket, chestnuts and spices, this beer is quite the tour-de-force. Brilliantly integrated. Medium-light in body with medium-high carbonation, this beer is a treat on the palate, and one I would love to drink more often, and would be curious to see what time in the bottle does to it."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Excellent barnyard funk and oakiness. Nectarine/peach flavors are tart and in abundance. Chestnut flavor is subtle but is there. Light-medium sourness, complex, delicate and quite quaffable for a Wild Ale."
"Rusty orange and hazy with a well-bubbled, foamy head. It looks the part of Biere de Garde but beyond that this is a totally different beer. Sour like everything else Jolly Pumpkin brews. Clean and lactic with plenty of funk and saddle blanket. Musty and woody. A fresh lavender floral note keeps things vibrant. Despite the erratic flavors balance is found. Chestnuts in beer? I guess they are present but I don't know what I am looking for. Another unique beer from Jolly Pumpkin."
""
"Not bad; it's probably not a good place for someone new to craft beer to start, but it's interesting and quite drinkable."
""
""
"Drinkability – Very easy drinking. A very nice Bière de Garde."

"Low B-"
""
"Overall: As always, it’s another weird, wild ride from Jolly Pumpkin. It's quite tasty and very refreshing."
"Pours a brownish orange color with a two finger slightly off white head which recedes to a tight head and leaves nice lace. The head stays around for a decent time. The aroma is of sweet notes and malt up front before you get a spiciness and sour in the back end. The taste follows suit with a malt backbone and a hint of spiciness up front. The middle has a chestnut taste followed by a citrus sourness. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it was a good beer, the taste was well balanced and delicate."
""
""
""
"Overall I think this beer is terrific, I do plan on purchasing this again. Anyone that loves sours, ales, and seasonal fall beers will love this one."
"Overall Impression- Another great one from Jolly Pumpkin! I appreciate every beer they brew because of the sour notes available. I'm glad I was able to find another bottle of this because I traded a bottle off to my cousin. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy a Saison/Biere De Garde style but then also appreciate a sour character."
""
""
"O: This is really good stuff. The acid is understated, but maintains itself and is an integral part of the experience. Real good flavours. I've been wanting to try this for a while, weird that it ended up being winter, but so be it. A fantastic beer from Jolly Pumpkin, the price is tough, but this is well done."
""
""
""
"Overall a real pleasant beer. The type of light-bodied beer I'd like to enjoy during the holidays."
"Overall, a nice beer with a nice bright tartness and a strong chestnut flavor. Definitely unique, but not the strongest offering fom Jolly Pumpkin I've had. Some more time in the bottle might brighten this up and increase the funk, which might help."
""

"Batch 909. Bottled 11/15/2011. Pours a slightly hazy caramel-golden color with a medium-small whit head that disappears quickly. Scent is spicy with a lot of pepper and hints of nuttiness. I also pick up that typical JP funk that I love in all of their beers. Taste is quite oaky at first...immediately turns to nuts and earthy flavors. Some lemon and acidic flavors. Nice barnyard funk, and finishes with some chestnut and winter-like spice. Nice, funky tartness throughout. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with good carbonation...very dry. Drinkability is high. Overall, JP never disappoints me. I wish I had access to their beers at all times. Not my favorite JP offering, but I would definitely purchase it again."
"Beer is medium to light in body, nice finish, not too dry, a little earthiness, lactic sourness, a little oak and funk on the end, no bitterness. I might have it again."
"O: Jolly Pumpkin makes some great sours so if that's your thing this one won't disappoint"
""
"Pours a light copper color with a good off-white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries a faint nuttiness atop of some light fruit and some earthy funk. Light oak as well. The flavor has some faint spice and a bit of earthiness to it, along with oak and some faint acidity. Light bit of funk throughout. Really nice balance. Light mouthfeel with good carbonation and a dry finish. Another winner from JP."
""
"Overall this isn't really that exciting to me, but it's actually quite nice drinking and very easy to enjoy. The feel of this beer seems to be the thing I enjoy the most. Seems like a good beer for Fall too."
"If there is such a thing as a generic sour, this would be it. Nothing wrong with this, and nothing bad at all. Just nothing distinguishes this from any other JP beer."
""
""
"O: Interesting. Lots of potential in the nose, but the taste is little weak and mild. This beer would go perfect on slightly warm fall day (occurs often in Las Vegas)."
"A very interesting fall take on the style. Drinkable, but not in anything more than a small amount. I'd tire of it quickly."
""
"O – This brew could stand to be much more sour… Another great quality beer brewed with love from JP. Nice work, Ron. Buy it, if you can find it. Cheers & Mahalo ;)"
""
"Smell is definately some brett, really sweet in general from the malts which give it a nice caremal smell. Taste is a nice brett with some sweetness I have a hard time describing. Really balances the brett out so there great caremal or some sort of Belgian candy sugar. Just a nice taste. Not too much brett like alot of Jolly Punpkin beers. This is just perfect since they really aren't very sour. More sour would be nice but not gonna complain as this is the best Jolly Pumpkin I have tasted in a while. Other favorites are the Pumpkin and Noel. Mouthfeel is thin+ and nice. Overall a nice beer but I really don't buy Jolly Pumpkin much anymore because there are better out there."
"Interesting beer from Jolly Pumpkin. Don't really get any of the roasted chestnuts... JP beers have a very distinct feel to them and this one was no different."
""
"I'd be proud to serve this beer to people, and proud to wear a badge that proclaims I drink it. It's a beer that, if it came across as polarising, I would defend to the hilt. In short, I feel patriotic - jingoistic, even - about this wonderfully complex, refreshing drop."
""
"Yes-- even though per bottle the price was higher than I usually shell out of beers, this brew will be on my must have list."
"Surprise! Looking for left-over King Henry and found this, a bitter sweet victory. Poured into a tulip, a pale golden straw, slightly opaque, less carbonation then anticipated. Not the most attractive beer. Plenty of must, basement and phenols (funk). But there is also a nuanced spice note, and a malty backbone with a clear toasty presence. While there is funk, cherry pie, and oak there are also more subtle flavors or spice, sweetness and yes chestnut/hazelnut/general nutty-ness. A very complex beer indeed. Medium bodied over the palate. This could be one of JP's better showings."

"O - This is a really tasty brew. I really have been enjoying everything Jolly Pumpkin does."
""
""
"And that's Jolly Pumpkin all over."
""
"Overall, a very good sour ale. The funk and vinegar combine with a slight sweetness and the wood flavors for a nice balance. The spices come through very slightly but they are there and they add an interesting element to the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - One is enough."
"Light to medium mouthfeel that has nearly no notice of alcohol. Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"The beer is sunburst hued, rusty orange. The head is over an inch thick, and hangs out for several minutes, leaving a thick sheet of lacing in its wake. The aroma brings the anticipated Jolly Pumpkin funk, with spice, malt, citrus fruits, oak, floral notes. Really wonderful aroma. The flavor is complex, intriguing, and delicious. Super smooth, with a yeasty, funkiness about it. Lingering notes of citrus. No sign of alcohol. I had no problem whatsoever draining my half of the bomber. Recommended."
" Pours a beautiful amber color w/ a perfect off white two finger head. Fairly cloudy w/ great carbonation and great lacing. Nose is that of wild yeast, malt, nutmeg, floral, spices. Fairly smooth for what I was expecting. Very balanced as well. Taste is fairly similar to the nose, w/ the floral notes and oak really coming out. Nice oak aftertaste. Feel is tart, mixed w/ malt and funk. Very nice, especially for the style. Smooth vs. tart done very well. I really enjoyed this beer- great for the style, and close to being 4.5's in several areas. Cheers."
"750ml bottle, Oct. 2008 batch. Having had this beer several times, I can say it needs at least three months after it’s released to really come into its own. It was released way too young IMO. Moving on, it pours a really beautiful glowing, reddish honey with a pillowy beige head. Awesome. Gorgeous, vintage Jolly Pumpkin nose - softly-integrated brett, sour tropical fruits, and of course oak. The flavor is vinous, subtle, and refreshing. There is not that burst of flavor you might expect though. This could be a phenomenal beer if the flavors were more pronounced. I still really like it."
"O - Good. I enjoyed this. Worth the ~$15. Mostly due to the price, I probably won't buy it again unless I want to indoctrinate someone into the realm of sour beer (I'd still probably buy their Calablaza Blanca). Regardless, I love Jolly Pumpkin and I am glad that they brew these marvelous, exciting beers."
"Overall a very nice wood aged sour. I'm not picking up on the BdG aspects. I'd put this in the american wild category. As a biere de garde, it is not very representative of the style."
"the CPJ"
"Bottle purchased about a month ago in Michigan. Pours an amber-orange colour with very thick white head. Nice lacing around the glass. Smells quite spicy, nutmeg and coriander I think. Can tell it is going to be tart from the smell, some apple as well. Flavour is almost sour, still has some sweetness though. Really big carbonation level. Another nice beer from this brewery."
"Batch 625 Bottled 9/28/10 a half month past my birthday...looks brilliant with a nice copper pale malted hue with a bright off white head. Forms a fine even band of lacing that continues with each sip. Nose has hints of cider, coriander, and roasted chestnuts...what a wild ale. Sour ale to the max tastes like a layer of lactic yogurt and tree bark sour and bit all the same. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with higher carbonation not much going on but bone dry finish between the lactic bittrness and tree bark mainly oak ale aging. Drinkability overall is decent but overall it was a bit rough with bark/oak flavor, not much other than that."
"Overall, a solid sour beer.. a nice mix of sour and spices."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Light bodied, crisp and refreshing. Sort of a cooling 'arctic chill' to the entire taste that reminds me of sucking on a mint. A pleasant sourness upfront that transitions to sweet cinnamon apple. Delicious!"
"A nice niche."
"Drink and overall: Very drinkable. Emily says she could ""drink alot of this"". Wonderfully flavorful, earthy, and zesty. Awesome beer. Another fantastic Jolly Pumpkin beer."
"D: Even for a Jolly Pumpkin beer, this is pretty interesting. I liked it quite a bit, but it's definitely different from most of their beers."
"D- Not the most drinkable Jolly Pumpkin I have had, but still good nonetheless. Each time I think that Jolly Pumpkin may finally let me down, I am proved wrong over and over again."
"D- Darn good stuff. I wouldnt have any problem pairing this stuff with a hearty holiday dinner."
"D: Great."
"D- A lot of promise but the mouthfeel kills it a bit for me. Still very tasty and worth trying."
"Drinkability - Extremely quaffable. Slowly enjoying this beer because I know they are relatively hard to come by now (until a new batch is brewed). Extremely thankful I was able to try this, especially on such a utterly perfect night."
"Looks great...but for the most part it's just above average"
"2007 vintage, thanks to nightbrew for bringing this one over. Deep amber color. The nose is similar in some ways to a Flemish; sour apple skin and funk for sure. The taste is a bit of a let down after the pungent nose, it's a little too subdued. Funky, slightly tart apple, maybe a hint of nuttiness amidst all the funk. The body is soft with a bit of sparkle. Overall, a pretty friggin' tangy beer. Sour fans unite."
"Tart, slightly puckering medium body which is on the fuller end of the spectrum. The oak flavor is prominent with hints of vanilla and lacto funk. Nutty with hints of spicy cinnamon, brown sugar and vanilla. Nice amount of soft carbonation with some sweet caramel malt, autumnal spiciness and more funk and oak character. There's a very harmonious balance of sweet and tart notes with a dry finish. Very good!"
"D: The tartness detracts a bit from the drinkability a bit but overall this is a delicious beer. Interested to know what this would have been like fresh."
"Served in a dimple glass. Deep ruby color with a large pillowish head - beautiful beer. Earthiness and spices dominate the nose but you can definitely tell it a JP beer. I also get some raisons and tart plums - actually a lot of plum. Taste is a little funkier than I expected with some oak thrown in too. This beer actually had a nice balance and would pair well with many foods. I get a little oxidation in the aftertaste but I like this one. This is probably the 10th or so beer I've had from Jolly Pumpkin and they are all solid."
"D - Fuego del Otono is a really unique, complex beer that artfully combines fruity, tart, oaky, sour and sweet elements. I really enjoyed the peachy finish of this beer. Very nice!"
"D - Decent beer. I'm a fan of tart oaky beers."
"Bottling No. 3, 2007. Pours golden orange with a white head. Very clear. Aroma is some tart citrus as well as some light funk. Also some spices. Flavor is semi-tart with lots of citrus. Not very funky. Finishes very dry. High carbonation and drinkability."
"D- Drinkable? Hell yes! There is so much going-on here, and no single attribute becomes overpowering."
"Lovely cognac hue, transluscent, two to three finger off-white head on the pour into a Bruery glass. Smell is not that strong, feint pumpkin, spice but not really all that impressive. Taste is very yeasty, sour dark fruit. I'm not getting a lot of other autumn harvest crops. Bitter sour finish is a bit sharp and body is on the thin side. Head reduced to a white array of stagnant bubbles in a thin, creamy froth; solid ring, good sheet lace. This would likely go well with a rich Thanksgiving dinner with sharp and sour notes to cut through the grease; as far as chestnuts go, I didn't get a lot coming through."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer to relax with on a cool autumnal evening. I think there may be other beers in the Jolly Pumpkin universe that I like a bit more than this one (I don't rate it as high as many others here), but it is a unique and tasty beer nonetheless."
"Even though I was displeased with the mouthfeel and taste at first, as it warms (or as I grow accustomed to the beer), it becomes pretty enjoyable. I'm not particularly into sour beers, but this one is pretty balanced."
"*Note - Becomes more pleasant as it warms, tart flavors mellow, malt peaks through"
"I've had Fuego Del Otoño on many occasions now and have each and every time enjoyed it. In fact, I make sure to hide a bottle away for every Thanksgiving. Although it may not be my favourite Jolly Pumpkin offering it is - like all the brewery's beers - truly something to ""sip, contemplate and enjoy"" - all the better with friends or family I might add."
"The aggressive oak-aged flavoring seems to render most of their brews extremely similar... Nothing too special in my opinon about this one despite obvious craftmanship in the making... Noticeable oak aroma, flavor, and finish paired with hints of chestnuts, bread, butter, caramel, and cinnamon... Interesting beer to say the least despite not particularly tickling my fancy..."
"This was the first beer from Jolly Pumpkin I've tried. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. From the moment I poured it out I was taken by its appearance and smell. This was not what I expected from a beer brewed with chestnut and spice. The smell was surprisingly refreshing, while remaining spicy it brought to mind not autumn as much as an image of an exotic place involved in the spice trade yet teaming with verdant flora. The appearance a nice moderate color that brought to mind a well milled table, neither too light nor too dark. A that bordered on golden and orange but was brownish and pleasing. When poured into a wine glass it produced a thick but tight head that again was unexpected in relation to the color. The taste although having some incredibly interesting qualities was firmly routed in what I would expect from the chestnuts and spice. Although the beer did not have any immediate standouts, it felt both earthy and sour at the same time. It brought to mind the qualities common to both cigars and whiskey as well as the zest of lemons and sour apples. What I most noted was an interplay between the sour apple bubbly nature and a woody cinnamon that interplay in a way that is distinctively autumnal. The moutfeel was pleasant and bubbly but not exactly my cup of tea, not bad but not worth writing home about. The drinkability is obviously knocked down by some of the characteristics that make the style. I was surprised though to find myself finishing the bottle over the course of about 2.5 hours. Although I couldn't regularly see myself downing a bottle a glass or two could not be refused. Overall I will say that this is one of the best beers I have had in a long time. It is in a style that I don't usually go for as easily but after hearing good things about Jolly Pumpkin I took a chance on a beer that I truly enjoy and embrace. I will definitely be buying another bottle or two this season and I would love, if I had the ability, to cellar a few. the Fuego Del Otono has inspired me to pursue all of Jolly Pumpkins offerings."
"Don't think I'd drop another $16 on one of these, but if you like the Biere de Garde style, and/or you dig Saisons, you should be happy with this one."
"750 ml bottle, batch three that was bottled in 2007, purchased at Hi-Times some time ago for around twelve dollars, opened with Dave and Matt tonight, poured into a Stone pint glass, color is a golden yellow with some orange tint, nice 1 3/4 inch fluffy white head that left nice lacing at the top, seemed like there were a good amount of floaties in here, aroma consists of caramel, pumpkin spice, clove, various herbs, lemon scents, tart, earthiness, roasted nuts, and grapefruit, taste is full of tart in the beginning, fades into tarty citrus in the middle, finishes dry with earthiness and a few different kind of nutty flavors lingering in the aftertaste, some berries and oak come out by the end but still tarty with oranges and lemons, nice mix of malt and spices to mold with that leading to nice complexity, dry, spicy, tart, and malty mouthfeel, medium bodied, tons of carbonation, taste lingers well, could have drank this whole bottle, refreshing and light on the stomach, a lot going on in the flavor profile but still keeps a smooth fell, nice surprise from Jolly Pumpkin, would love to see a grand reserve version of this, nice tart welcome with a funky finish, would like to drink again, recommended"
"More misses than hits from these guys for me"
"750 ml bottle, sticker with ""Batch 244,245"" on the back of the bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a murky amber/brown color with about a 2 inch off-white foamy head. Head retention is excellent, with a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is fruity, musty, and spicy. It smells like funk/brett, oak, tart apples, cloves, and some cherries. Taste is similar to the aroma. There's green apples, vinegar, pepper, oak, funk, lemon, and caramel malt all noticable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with high but soft carbonation which works great for this brew. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and enjoyable to drink. I like this brew a lot, it's refreshing and a good overall beer."
"D - As anyone can tell, I am a huge fan of Jolly Pumpkin, I love all their beers I have tasted, and this one was among my favorites, looking forward to having this one again"
"It's got vigorous carbonation present. Not sure what foods i'd pair it with, but it's strong enough to hold up to anything. I love it as a sipper and at this low of an abv, this 250ml will be gone in no time at all!!! Love it."
"pours a slightly murky amber, rich but a bit cloudy. Smell is a touch of tart brett with a bit of spicing that hits the nose just right, almost like an exotic christmas drink or cookie. Like there's some caramel malt in there too. Great malt base, spicing is light and mixes with the brett just perfectly. Almost a bit nutty. Great body and heft, a perfect sipper for an evening. Very drinkable. A great offering from JP."
"Batch 336, bomber from DeCiccio's in Ardsley, NY. Pours cloudy, dull, dark brownish amber. The head is thick, medium khaki, the real story is the world class retention. The head stays and stays, then leaves a thick film, ring and gobs of nice looking lacing. The nose is spicy, earthy and infused with sour notes. Simply delicious brew, sour fruit, more earthyness, peppery spice, a waft of sweet malt. The finish continues the theme, sour, spice, earth, malt, pepper. Somehow it all comes together and works. Perhaps my favorite brew experience yet from JP"
"Bottle. Pours a deep clear amber with a small ring of white head. Aroma of nice sour funk, sweettart candies, lemons, and a touch of oak. Flavor of sour brett and bitter, lemony hops in the finish. Pretty similar to any other Jolly Pumpkin beer, but it's still quite tasty."
"Poured a thin copper brown with a two-finger head that died slowly and left some lace down glass. A sweet and spicy smell of caramelized malts, pepper, clove, corriander (I think) and stuff like cinnamon/nutmeg (pumpkin beer material) as well as some heavy fruits; light hop presence. A mix of tart fruits and sweet/spicy malts for a well-balanced and great tasting beer. Medium-body that is slightly chewey that goes down easy and is full of spices/malts that percolate on the tongue and this is evened out w/ tart fruits like apple/grape and something akin to red wine oakiness. A definite sipper as it smooths as it warms and when the tongue gets used to the intial tartness it is even more pleasant."
"Outstanding beer, as I have come to expect from Jolly Pumpkin, and quite unique."
"D - Wow. An absolutely stunning beer. Despite the fact that I'm drinking this in April, this will be my session beer of choice come autumn. I would pair this brew with an aged comté, a hearty beef and root vegetable stew, or drink it on its own. I can only imagine how well this brew would age in the cellar!"
"The acidity level and lactic qualities are similar to most of the other JP brews. It seems that Ron has found a groove in that aspect. I'm not picking up any Chestnuts though so I'm a bit dissapointed. Highly drinkable and the spicing is subtle, and theres plenty of Brett to keep things interesting."
"D: Very nice yeasty nature, never overbearing providing just the right amount of funk with a light assortment of spiciness and citrusy tartness that was very smooth going down."
"Another astonishingly unique blend of flavors from Jolly Pumpkin & Co. As a kid, I would never have dreamed of tasting a liquid with such flavors.... at this age, I know better. You may hate this beer, but you need to try it. I personally liked it and will buy it again. Now! Hopslam and to bed! 3:25. I can do this."
"solid, although on the tart side for a biere de garde. but that's jolly pumpkin for you..."
"Always excited to try stuff from Jolly Pumpkin. I bought this one at Julios today. Cool looking label as well. Poured a lively dark orange, with a half finger of white heading that has a lot of lasting power. Good aroma of funky wild yeast, some noticeable sour notes, musty cellar smell and some interesting spice. Taste starts off sort of citrusy, maybe some lemon, then fades in to a more powerful, medicinal taste. Definitely has a strong layer of leather like Brett in the flavor. Body of this beer is on the medium side, which is not a bad thing. Drinkability lacks a little bit for me only because of the intense funk that is present. Not the best from Jolly Pumpkin, but pretty good either way. Worthy of a purchase. Cheers"
"The complexity in this is a lot of fun. It starts out slowly but burns strong through the night like a good fire. For all its spice and general weirdness it's very clean. Well-crafted."
"D: A nice and complex beer, although one bottle is enough for one evening."
"Drinkability: interesting complex beer that leaves you wanting more whent he glass is emptied. Worth picking one of these up for yourself."
"Suffice it to say, this beer is outstanding. Also, I totally get the autumn flavor aspect to this beer. There is some lovely underlying spice in this beer, and the interplay of light sour funk with the malt and hops is impressive. I could absolutely see serving this fine beer with a Thanksgiving turkey dinner and think it would pair well with turkey meat, dressing, potatoes and even pumpkin pie. This is very good stuff."
"I poured this into my tulip (approx. 50 degrees). It is a lovely golden-copper color and had a silky head that dissipated quickly. The aroma is filled with sour cherry but with a hint of the malty sweetness. Tangy and tart it doesn't evolve into a myriad of flavors as do many sour beers I have had. There is a nice caramel malt presence that provides a comforting balance. It is lightly carbonated and has a pleasant astringency from the barrel. I really enjoyed this beer and was pleasantly surprised by the sourness. I am really growing to like Jolly Pumpkin as a brewery."
"Another solid beer from Jolly Pumpkin"
"The body is a bit thin, but just right carbonation, very nice drinker for the colder days. I may go back to this one, but not my favorite of Jolly Pumpkin."
"Another fine ale from Jolly Pumpkin. Pours an autumn brown and has a silky beige head, quite a beautifull beer. The nose has candy malts followed by tart citrus fruits and oaky funk. The taste has sweet malts up front with a well balanced sour fruit pesence through the finish. Medium body is well carbonated."
"Batch 336. Pours the color of a 50/50 tea/lemonade from snapple. Even has the same sour smell as the 50/50 too, plus the JP funk. This one has much more body than every other JP I've had, and is more sour to boot. The oak provides a tiny bit of bittering, which is nicely balanced by the acidic backbone. Short finish with a bit of nutty spice of some sort, maybe corriander and nutmeg. Quite tasty, and worth the price tag."
"D: Modest alcohol and lots of funk make for a great ale. I like the tartness and the horse blanket. I like most everything about this ale."
"100+ reviews deep and this is one of my favorite breweries. The strong oak aged stuff hits higher notes, but Jolly Pumpkin is all-around delicious."
"Wow...I'm not even sure how to end this. I'm not sure if my rating is high enough based upon the complexity of this brew. It reminds me a bit of a Flemish Red with some spicy peppercorns thrown into secondary. Lovely."
"I heart Jolly Pumpkin!!"
"Well done and tasty, but a touch less complexity in the flavor that the nose led me to believe. A bit pricey, as usual."
"Poured into my St. Bernardus glass a very nice cloudy golden yellow/brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, funky, with some oak notes, and spice. The taste is funky, with some malts/yeast, nice touch of oak/spice. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a nice one, recommended."
"D - Not good. I have no idea what happened to this beer. I paid too much for this; quite a disappointment for a beer that is only a year old. It cost way too much to be a drain pour, so I soldiered on."
"This is a great afternoon type drinking beer. Light and refreshing, with interesting flavor."
"Poured from a 750mL bomber. The beer is dark orange with an adequate wet-looking foam, clarity varies as the bottle drains (starts mostly clear, a little murky maybe, finishes with haze and some sediment on the bottom). The aroma is sour and a little like a wild ale, but not as funky as other JP beers have been. The taste confirms it, the sourness is there but only as an accent to the sweetness from the malts. Dry finish, maybe a little hops in the aftertaste."
"Fun fact: Had my mother sample this much like most of my beers while I'm home in the summer. Her response to it, ""Bland with the essence of vinegar. Least interesting beer you've had."" Ouch JP, my mom just burned you."
"Bright copper with airy carbonation and rim & isle lace. Bready, Belgian golden aroma with notes of heather. Flavor is tart but relaxed. Dry and peppery but with a slight measure of pencil shavings in the finish. Clear at first serving but gets cloudy after the second pour. Very nice beer though the chestnuts were lost on me."
"Drinkability: Extraordinarily complex; my favorite Jolly Pumpkin yet"
"Drinkability- Overall a nice brew. Maybe not my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer, but that's not saying much since I like all of them I have had so far. I would have again for sure if offered."
"Fuego Del Otono (Autumn Fire) is my second favorite Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales offering, after the fantastically delicious biere de garde, Oro De Calabaza. Regarding the rest of his creations, I'd like to see Mr. Jeffries go easier on the wild yeast, so his remarkable brewing talent can shine for all to taste. As it does here."
"Pours up an amber/chestnut color with a beigy bone white head. Aromas of sour dark cherries, some brett funk, brown sugar, maraschino and an oaky woodiness. Mostly tart and dry with a little bit of cherry-like sweetness amidst the malt. Citric dryness in the finish. Carbonation is tight and compacted. Very nice."
"Thanks to northernbrews for the opportunity to try this one. Batch 244,245 served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold color (I can see why this brew is called Autumn Fire). Inch and half creamy white head settled into a dense skim of foam and ringlets. Sheets of lacing with moderate adherence and consistency during the tasting. Scents of yeast, citrus and a subtle earthiness, with a touch of well-hidden funk. Lots of citrus character in the flavor profile as well as a nicely blended spiciness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and effervescent without being overwhelming, followed by some sourness at the finish. I could see this as being a very refreshing brew on a hot day."
"The body is closer to light than full. A slight dryness with a good carbonation. Overall BdG's are all over the place, but even so I think this could have been better without the brett. Then again if aged the brett could come out and just finish this off nicely."
"D: not my favorite from Jolly Pumpkin, but it is definitely good. I will drink it again. Very drinkable and perhaps a a new Thanksgiving beer for me."
"Drinkability is good for fans of funky beers, which is what this one is all about. I love me some funk, and am glad this had time to develop, but the aftertaste can be a bit much, especially the little metallic tinge found on a lot of JP's beers."
"Poured into a Duvel chalice the body is a mostly clear amber with an enormous beige head that settles into a frothy meringue. Aroma is herbal, spicy and citrusy lemon. Some wild funky notes, as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety carbonation and a sour herbal bite. Taste is quite saison like. Dry and herbal, with some floral hopping. Softly sweet malt notes add a richness. Citrusy orange and lemon add considerable depth. Another solid offering from Jolly Pumpkin."
"Poured a cloudy orange with a white creamy head and a bit of lace residue on the glass. Smells faintly skunky and lightly hoppy. As I have come to expect with Jolly Pumpkin, the taste is interesting; very much different than typical ales. The bottle mentions chestnut and ""spices""; further discription on the bottle lists the spices as ""distant forgotten spices," which wasn't much help as I couldn't quite place them. Regardless of my ability to recognize the spices, the blend was nicely balanced. Even the after taste was pleasant. The palate was as close to perfection as I've ever encountered; perfect level of carbonation and the lingering impression of the taste was both long-lasting, and satisfying. A great ale well worth the purchase."
"D- A very good mellow sour brew. I could drink the whole bottle if it wasn't for her!"
"Overall impression: Another nice barrel aged offering from Jolly Pumpkin. They are definitely on a short list of American brewers making this type of beer - and I look forward to more offerings."
"Pours a light gold in color. Plenty of nice rocky head. Nice web lacing on sides of the glass. Smell is funk and some tartiness. Taste is very nice. Lots of nice sour, tartness coming through. Good amount of spice to compliment the tartness. Good, smooth mouthfeel. Another good offering from JP."
"D: For a sour, fantastic."
"An enjoyable beer I'd like to try fresh."
"Overall: Amazing aroma, very complex and inviting, but I think it set me up for a super complex flavor profile that wasn't there. The flavor was pleasant, but again not nearly as complex as the aroma and left me wanting more spice. Still it was drinkable and enjoyable... coudos Jolly Pumpkin for another good beer."
"Overall, it's a pretty typical JP brew, although not one of their better ones. I'd prefer more sourness and less watery flavors."
"Excellent orange appearance. Funky smell, herbal. Lemony spritzy flavor with an interesting finish. There is some sour going on but it is faint and enjoyable. Some biscuity malts and then a dry finish iwth sour edges."
"Hazy soft peach/golden color with a some surface lacing and a thick crown. Big funky yeasty aromas and of melange others like florals, pear, apple, straw, and slightly acidic citrus. Big sourness, very dry, a flat champagne flavor and some horse blanket. Fermented fruits, varying florals, bitterness right out front, and grassy straw notes mingling. Medium body and a thin mouthfeel, low carbonation but still gets some creaminess in a tongue tingle at the end. Citrus becomes more willing as it warms and a funny spice flavor is noted but not quite identified."
"Had on cask at the Brick Store. Always good to see Jolly Pumpkin. Super hazy golden apple cider color, with a very thin head with large bubbles that fades in seconds. Nose is mild apples, malt, citrus hints, and an odd estery ammonia smell. Taste is a punch in the mouth of sour grapefruit. Wild yeast and a barny, boggy spiciness follow, with the hops coming in right at the end. Very interesting. Mouthfeel is decent; it's a bit dry. Drinkability is good but hurt by the sourness."
"D: I had no problem finishing the pint but I think this style is just a bit too different for me. I'll of course try more in the future."
"Pulpy, hazy copper apricot body with golden edges. Rocky, thick, lacy, egg shell white head. Beautiful. Candied wheat backs up aromas of fresh hay, powdered sugar, semi-tart fruits, and mild horse blanket. Complex and inviting. Tangy, tart acidic citrus right off the bat. Light toasted malt notes come in before a fruitier, wheatier body. Tart citrus throughout. Deliciously acidic and refreshing. Caramel, oak, and fresh cut hay notes mix with lingering sour and floral hoppy bitterness in the finish. Very nice. Medium body with a lively, sparkly feel. A solid contestant for my favorite JP brew."
"Pours a copper / amber color with an off white head. Aromas of a sour dark cherry. In the taste, sour cherries with a small caramel end. A sour fruity mouthfell and a dry fruity aftertaste. A very nice fall beer, big body and really enjoy the sour fruityness."
"If youre a fan of this style I would guess this is a real winner."
"Pours a copper color with a very tall head that falls slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is spicy and woody with some toasted maltiness in the background. The flavor has a lot of spicing going on with a little lemony-zesty character as well as just a hint of funkiness. Tasty beer. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but that's ok. The drinkability is just ok, due to the spices."
"Like many other Jolly Pumpkin ales, this brew is full of flavor, juiciness, spiciness, lightly vineous, and with a decent dosage of funk--just enough to make things interesting. Starts with a strong, spicy aroma (nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger), quickly followed by a hearty, bready semi-sweet maltiness. A medium muskiness (not quite moldy) overcomes the sweetness, and takes on a solid vineous aroma. The look of the beer is a standard, agressively carbonated, well headed brew with loosely knit foamstand, Sprinkled with yeast and spices. The flavors take on the semi-sweet barley / bready flavors, but meld well with background tones of oak aged flavor, modest caramel and cashew (buttery, nutty) flavors. As the flavors subside, the vineous character rises nearly to wine-like proportions, stopping only for a tart, sharp, dry finish. Lingers with assertive spices, aged hops, and alcohol. There is very little that differentiates the quality of Jolly Pumpkin ales, but they are all amazing and full of art. Another well done brew."
"Pours gently clouded copper with huge thin foamy head. The beer literally exploded out of the bottle upon opening. Smells mellow and earthy, with plenty of spicy yeast, orange, coriander, pepper, spices. Some leafy funk in there as well. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with added lemon fruit and nutty toasted malt tones. Very laid-back and relaxed overall. Light and slightly creamy in the mouth; perhaps a little too thin in body. A low-toned and pleasant treat for malt lovers. Hop-heads will want to avoid it as there's essentially zero hop presence."
"My first JP gusher. After a gentle flip of the cap, the bottle immediately began to foam over. Trying to pour gently yielded a Duvel glass full of foam. I had to pour into 2 glasses just to stop the steady creep of foam up the neck of the bottle. Funny, but a bit much really. For all that effort, the head does not last and leaves some light lacing atop a murky brown body. Eh, I've seen better from these guys. A great smell as the beer warms. Carmel, sour apples, maybe juniper and just a hint of anise and cloves. Taste is very much like a sour brown ale. Nothing remarakable, but nothing bad. Like most JP beers, this drinks a bit thin, but I'm used to it. A solid offering."
"Pours a light brown with a great, but not runaway, head. Great lacing follows as well. The beer is a little hazy. The smell is interesting. Spice, a light nuttiness, a whiff of light sourness, and a touch of sweetness on the finish. The sour is lemony, the nuttiness hazlenut or chestnut, and the spice is cinammon, clove, and a slight bitterness. The taste is marvelous- the sourness of the style comes through nicely, but its not overpowering and is balanced nicely by a slightly sweet and subtle nuttiness from the chestnuts, all underpinned by a nice dry malt background that lends some chocolate notes. The chestnuts really work here. Their nuttiness is very restrained which I like a lot, and they have their own sweetness and earthiness that is just beautiful. The mouthfeel is lighter than one might expect given the color and ingredients, but true to a Biere de Garde. Very refreshing and unlike any other beer I've had. Quite nice."
"D - A tasty beer that just screams for a nice autumn night by a campfire."
"Great appearence with a pillowy foam. Im not sure I like the subtle wild yeast character. The same character was present in both Biere De Mars and Bam Biere, and Im still unsure about it. After the mid-palate, some interesting fruit character comes out. The mouthfeel is nice and chewy. I wish it had more barrel character however. More oak please. Pretty good and unique."
"The beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an earthy malt scent along with a mildly bitter hop aroma. There is a slightly tart yeast presence along with some fruit esters. The taste is decent. It has a tart/fruity yeast flavor that smacks you in the mouth. It has a moderate malt bill with a bit of hops in the finish. This is a little too aggressive with the yeast esters for me. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with a bit too much carbonation. This was an interesting beer, but nothing I'd buy again."
"The drinkability was not real good for me but not bad. perhaps just too airy and spicy. Many thanks to KMWeaver. Prosit, MK"
"750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a dark amber/brown color with a massive of white head. The aroma is slightly tart with some light citrus, malt and a little bit of funk. The taste is tart with a good amount of roastiness, spice, yeast and some earthy notes as well. The mouthfeel is light and prickly from the high carbonation. Overall, this is an absolutely superbly crafted brew that is highly recommended."
"this beer blurs the line between beer and cider brilliantly. upon first sip, as with the smell, funky yeast is foremost. after a few sips, ripe michigan apples build in the palate, along with notes of caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a host of other subtle nuances. tastes like autumn. this is very impressive. light and crisp in the mouth, and drinkable by the gallon."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown color ale with big white foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is sour with some oak and some Brett character. Taste is quite sour and tart with some oak but really dominating by Brett yeast. While I enjoyed this American Wild Ale very much, I could not really feel any spices or chesnut as mentioned on the label since the Brett really took over. Body is light with some great carbonation. Another great JP beer that could serve very well as a session beer."
" Wavz"
"D: I wasn't sure what to expect with this Jolly Pumpkin beer but I knew it was going to be one hell of a journey. I am consistantly bowled over by the beer that they put out and this has got to be my favorite from them so far. I can't get over the musty attic aromas and flavors that permeate this beer. Challenging to the palate and well worth the effort!"
"Thanks to emerge077 for spotting this one and sending me the beermail."
"A unique and strong example of creative brewing..."
"Dark bronze or brown with decent-sized head. Malty aroma with spritzy citrus notes. Flavour was buttery and a little sour, with a creamy mouthfeel and a surprisingly sour aftertaste. Lambic-like, and I think Jolly Pumpkin does use wild yeasts."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for splitting the bomber with me"
"Originally reviewed on September 16, 2006. 750 mL Bottle. A sweet glow of tawny lemons and horsey grain husk. Grapeskins and fermenting leather blend in a sack of spice. A sweet peach soda pour, with a flowing lace of ivory. Flavor is a sweet sugary essence of malt, while Brett plays quietly in the corner. This beer isnt as nuanced as I would expect. I breathe in some vapors of extraneous nut husks and distant spice conjuring. The reduced play of Brett is deft, as I still get the wonderful sweet lechee juice sensation, but am sparing the scorching acidity. I can also pleasently draw on the crisp malt sugars. This beer isnt particularly nuanced in my opinion, but has a beavenly drinkability, replete with fresh crisp summer hops. The quietly unassuming, but magically appearing hop smack on the tounge, in Euro fashion makes this an expertly balanced beer. This beer is really growing on me, the long drawn carries fresh lime juice and Madagascar Vanilla. And theres spicy mingling. It turns into one of those beers you want to just keep drinking and drinking and hope it will never go away. This is a scarce beer where the backend and smack are the best parts. Damn!"
"Cuvee de autumn fire, a funky jolly pumpkin. Not as vinegary, bold, as the brown ale had earlier in the tasting. Orangey colour. Spicey, hint of roast,drinkable. Cinammon, nutmeg, corriander, lemon citrus, nutty, full mouth, caramel, vanilla from wood"
"drinkability is good. a little smoother and a bit more my style than the maracaibo especial i had earlier in the night. the lighter spicing and hint of roastyness sways me to this one."
"Thanks for sharing this masterpeice Mike! Deep orange/brownish body topped by solid being froth leaving spiderweb lace. Strange spicy grapefruit aroma is a welcome suprise. Lemons, and rinds, lots of funk and brett, with solid yeast and nuts. Very spicy flavour profile, slightly woody/nutty with the solid funk I expect from Ron. Solid puckering brett finish! Yay! This stuff is great except for those who are allergic to chestnuts! :) Thanks Mike!"
"This is one of the more difficult JP's to find. Definitely worth a try if you see any. Expect to pay a few dollars more for this than the other JP regular offering due to the amount of chestnuts used in the mash and during aging."
"comment on anything. I'll tell you who! I'm a friend of Ron. Ron Jefferies. Whether he knows it or not. Put this one in the Hall of Fame with the others."
"This beer is extremely refreshing and drinkable. I just couldn't get enough, but unfortuately I only have one bottle. Totally amazing, I am thoroughly impressed. Seek this one out!!"
"Taste; it's definitely on the tart side, but it's in no way overwhelming. Caramel and cinnamon blend well with the apple flavors, with an interesting lemon twist mixed on with them. The barnyard funk and oak barrel flavors round out the beer very nicely. I wasn't sure the flavor would live up to the smell, but it definitely has, with all of the flavors smoothly flowing into the next. Mouthfeel is on the full side with a lively but smooth carbonation. The only real problem I have with this beer, is that I only had one of them."
"The beer dispenses from the 750ml brown bottle a burnished copper with a portly head that is semi-creamy and a light tan in color, upon its eventual demise the lace forms a thin white sheet upon the glass. Nose is lemon-like in its crispness, hints of caramel, sweet malt at the back with a bit of butter as it warms, start is modestly sweet, the grain presence adequate and the top middling in feel. Finish is decidedly acidic, the hops light on the palate, dry somewhat sour aftertaste with a bit of nuttiness to finish it off."
"This is an exceptionally drinkable beer. If you ever come across this beer and don't buy it I will slap you."
"Drinkability is simply average. A Belgian sour bomb, not my favorite style at all but this is by far the most mundane brew I've had from JP."
"D: Tremendous beer from one of my favorite breweries. So many various notes along the way with complexity happening thru ever stage of the sip to the swallow."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with plenty of fast moving bubbles that race across the tongue. Rather smooth and easy going, would make a good summer brew as well. An interesting brew to be had here, but not my favorite of the JP offerings. Still, I always seem to have an easy time downing these 750's and this one is no exception. Give it a try and decide for yourself! (Pairs well with some mild cheddar also.)"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the slightly cloudy burnished copper brew. Head keeps growing for awhile, with bubbly foam lacing variously on the glass. Aroma is lightly sour malts with a touch of fruitiness. Taste starts with moderate grain, then tartness kicks in, and then mellows to the close, which leaves a lingering fruitiness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pleasing. A nice treat."
"Hazed caramel/orange colour with a short head, good retention with some lacing. Very fragrant, mostly spices - nutmeg, allspice, ginger - with light farmyard funk. Some spice in the flavour, but more balanced. Nutty towards the end, but the malt was quite thinned out. The finish was definitely tart. Lightish body with generous carbonation. The texture was a bit slick. Very interesting - fun and tasty. Another great beer from JP."
"The mouthfeel is good. Seems fairly full for the style. Fairly funky and sour. Not too acidic or tart. Carbonation is decent. Drinkability is good."
"Pours a hazy, brown/orange, small white head, some minimal lace, good retention. Smell is sweet, brown sugar, spice, citrus, farmhouse funk, yeast, wheat, sourness. Taste is sweet and brown sugar sour, hay and wheat, yeast, citrus spice, chocolate in the finish. Medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, very smooth, amazing body. This was most excellent, I could drink this all day. Thanks DrJay!!!"
"Roast vegetables and Jalisco specialties paired well with this beer. Drink it soon before the brettanomyces suck it dry of its soul."
"Fuego is the second Bier de Garde that I've had from Jolly Pumpkin, and while interesting, is another beer by them that I wasn't personally that impressed with. I like the fact that they're experimenting, but the strong, estery, oakey character that their beers all seem to have is not something that I find myself particularly caring for."
"Brilliant striking amber color with a nice fluffy yet rocky tan-white head. Very cool looking. A strong acidic nostril twinge meets my nose as I lean in to inhale. A bit of some darker fruit flavors along with some definite woody notes. Yes, it does seem like chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Taste once again seems to be control by the sour lactic flavors. They're definitely not bad and I enjoy them but they do control a bit too much. A strongly yeasty body drowns out the malts further. Light cherries and other fruits lie as a backdrop. Caramel comes out the further I go. Some tannins make their way through. A touch of oak. Then the finish which I might find in a Lambic with natural fruitiness added. This was quite an enjoyable and unique offering from JP. Once again they succeed."
"from the bottle. poured a cloudy copper with a big fluffy off white to light tan head that left a ton of lacing. aroma sour fruits, musty, orange, sour cherries a lot of sourness out of this beer. flavor, more sourness, tart, once this warmed up a bit got malts and some sweetness (maybe this is the caramel but I could not pick it out) came out, bitter . this beer got better as it warmed the sourness became less evident."
"My final word on this beer is that it is so well integrated, and so well balanced. The wood character, the tartness, the funky notes, the fruit character and everything else just combines to form a really nice drinking, complex brew. Once again Ron has created a masterful brew, so far he is firing on all cylinders and I still have 5 more of these to go."
"Just a quite hit of sweet caramel shows up front. Acidity rushes in next, bringing plenty of spices along with it. Well rounded fruitiness, especially apple. A bone dry finish closes it out. Medium bodied, robust carbonation. Fantastic."
"Drinkability remains high throughout. This brew is not nearly as succulent as the aforementioned Oro de Calabaza with which I am particularly enamoured with right now. It is good. Just not the best Jolly Pumpkin brew. Especially as a sort of limited production. Good. Not the best from the Jolly Pumpkin brewery."
"Pours light yellow in color just a hint of brown above straw color. Forms massive head that takes over the glass. Smell of sourness and cider. I've just recently tried La Folie and Supplication and it reminds me of those. Sip also reveals a sourness but with a rounded edge. This is a great beer. It is less sour than New Belgium La Folie. It is made right next door. How incredible! This is the best Jolly Pumpkin offering I have had by far yet. This one is not to be missed. Just a hint of nutmeg. Very soft in mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"Another complex brew from Capt. Ron that defies my expectations and challenges boundaries and convention. Much more sour and less sweet than I anticipated. This drinks more like an Oud Bruin than a Biere de Garde-- but style be damned, this is a complex and tasty brew that will take some more time for me to fully wrap my head/tongue around."
"Slàinte!"
"Had a hard time pinning this one down for style, but I think that's what the brewer intended. Get some."
