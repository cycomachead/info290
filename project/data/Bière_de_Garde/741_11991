PALATE: warming, unexpectedly creamy body; aftertaste affords more than the ""fleeting experience"" the label foretells--and the aftertaste is not one to hold on to...TASTE: a cinnamon, slightly medicinal/syrupy experience--surprisingly not what a bier de garde is supposed to be; astringent wine-like red blushes the pallet late; a struggle to chew, let alone enjoy ...

3.06,-14.3,3.75,3.25,2.75,3.5,3,"Medium bodied with a bitter earthy hop bite that lingers over the sweet malt backbone and funky farmhouse yeast into a very dry finish. Very dry and resinous with sticky pine needle, grass and spicy spruce tip flavor dominating the palate. Underneath, there is a decent malt backbone with hints of bread, toffee, caramel and biscuit but these notes are overwhelmed by the aggressive hop presence. The farmhouse character from the aroma is very faint and barely noticeable with everything else going on. There is some light fruit sweetness toward the finish but it still feels like its lacking in balance because of the earthy bitterness.","corby112","Feb 16, 2013"

For a commercial, American version, Lakefront does a good job of capturing the complex malt sweetness underlined by simple and subtle yeast components. Unless you've got a major sweet tooth, make this a table beer and share it with a few people, enjoying it with food.","BeerFMAndy","Jun 11, 2012"

Aromatic with baked apples, faintness of raisins, soft herbal tone and a ghostlike broth. Maltiness is dialed up quite high on the sweetness. Hint of metallic crystallized sugar, mild phenol funk from the yeast and some hop flavor. Hops do little to help balance this brew out. Estery, with ripe fruit and warmth. A lot thicker and sweeter than anticipated but not too far off whatâ€™s expected. A decent stab at the style.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 15, 2011"

The taste is smooth with a good malt start with the winter spices all coming in the finish. Dry fruits such as raisin and plum mix with the caramel and sweet malts. Could use a little more hop presence to balance things out. Nice medium body that is smooth and very rich. Decent carbonation as well. This was a nice brew to sit and drink slowly.
