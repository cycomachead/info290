Smell: upfront it's grassy, spicy, with some mineral note; mildly grainy with grape and light stone fruit sweetness, sugar cookie. Taste: nectarine, slightly tart, lemon note, grassy, snappy grain, doughy and sweet backing. Light-medium and creamy for a split second, then some heftier carbonation kicks in, pulling it to medium-plus with a fluffy feel. Finishes dry and fairly hoppy. Delicious, crooshable.","babaracas","Jun 06, 2014"

As a farmhouse ale I find this very tasty, refreshing and satisfying. I'm torn on how high to rate this as I find few flaws except perhaps a slight soapy water note, or some odd herbs, an a tiny mouth puckering dry-bitter finish. Full bodied with sweet amber malts, light herbs, honeydew melon juice, powdered sugar. It's complex and pleasant...reminds me a bit of the Achel yeast.

Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a three finger plume of soapy white head (expected a lot more), good retention. Scent was fantastic, combining light watery fruits, flowers, tangy grain, bready yeasts, peppery spice and and wonderful earthy funk with light notes of barnyard. The taste presented all components of scent and was much smoother then the scent dictated, but still tremendous. Lightly dry and bubbly on the tongue.

Very refreshing, clean, and interesting. Lots of grain husks and grassiness with fruity yeast aroma: pears, apple, wet hay.
