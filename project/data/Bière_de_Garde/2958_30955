Quarter finger/ "nothingish" head-wise. Super-chunky. Funky smell. Sweet/ sour on the immediate palate. Pleasant woodiness from the oak and a refreshing astringency due to the aged hops, both as to be expected. The sweetness was coupled to the rest of the flavors in such a way that is to be truly commemorated. Complementary mouthfeel. Aged for 9 years I was expecting something stellar. I was rewarded with an excellent brew with unexpected subtleties. Enjoy it for what it is and what you expect it to be and you won't be disappointed.","NateF90","Feb 12, 2015"

My only complaint would be the oak is it a bit too forward and overpowers the other flavors.  Probably would be a good beer to age a bit longer to see if the oak fades and allows the other flavors to shine through.  Although not the same style, I much prefer the Rodenbach 2008 Vintage for roughly the same cost.","OntheLambic","Jan 06, 2015"

3.8,-12,,,,,,"Sourness and wine define a sharp dryness, in which warming spices, a lot of oak and slick acidity create a pleasant complexity. Fruitiness developes berry and lemony hints, as the sourness becomes even more recognizable towards the end. Although the alcohol is well hidden, carbonation is too high for the complex character of the beer, metallic notes disturb the fragile balance, as it rolls over the palate. Giving the beer more time to age might help, as it has great potential.","aleigator","Dec 14, 2014"

4.83,11.8,4.75,4.75,5,4.5,4.75,"Pours out a deep, reddish caramel body with a thin, frothed milk head. Smell is of wood, toasted malts, berries, funk, acid, brown sugar. This first flavor impression is acidity, along with light caramel sweetness, chocolate, toasted bread, warm wood, gentle, earthy hop (faintly). Alcohol is very well-hidden, but perceptible. Finishes rather dry. Amazing. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight, with a sharp bubbliness. Acidity strips the tongue. Incredible beer. Not what I was expecting.","goochpunch","0"

4.34,0.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is #00276, brewed in 2007 and blended in Dec 2008. The beer is a murky, amber-brown coloring with a peppering of small carbonation bubbles throughout and no head. Aromatic as soon as you pry the cap off. Wow. Aromas of tart cherry, tannins, old world fruit sweetness in the backbone, apples, roasted notes, and an abundance of spices, including cloves, coriander, and nutmeg. Very layered nose, and more and more comes out as you drink. Great. Flavors are fruit rich forward, with a blast of berries and cherries enveloped in tart and slightly acidic notes, keeping a perfect balance across the palate. Darkly sweet plum and fig backbone, with a spiced blend that warms a bit, as well as provides some edge to all the smooth and rich notes. The tart turns slightly sour towards the tail end of the palate, which does a solid job of cleaning up all of the majorly rich and heavy characteristics. Smooth, mid-bodied in mouth, with a tart and fruity aftertaste that has a slightly astringent feel to it. The finish is crisp, with a slightly sour linger. Very delicious beer worth seeking out.","GarthDanielson","Feb 24, 2014"

Looks and smells like apple cider and jammy fruits with a bright acidity. The taste follows suit; sweet fruits up front (mostly apple with a hint of grape or berry) with a bright acidity. The acidity is moderate and pleasant with a hint of acetic acid/vinegar. A musty earthiness follows with a touch of oak and acetic acid and just a hint of booze at the end of a long finish. The taste is sweet up front and finishes tart. The mouth is dried by some oak tannins. Carbonation is light, enhancing the drinkability. This is a very interesting beer that hides its alcohol content very well. Expensive but highly recommended, especially if you enjoy cidery flavors.","brianmandell","0"

Sits easily on the stomach and the palate. This is the most expensive beer I’ve ever bought at $27.99 before tax. I’d been thinking about buying this beer for nigh on 5 months and I’m glad I finally took the plunge. I was expecting to feel cheated but I’ll be buying this again. When one considers how much people are willing to pay for a decent bottle of wine, this beer seems more reasonably priced. I loved it, and enjoyed it more than any wine I’ve ever had. When I compare it in this way I don’t feel so bad about the price. I look forward to pairing this with some hearty French-Swiss Alpine fare or a berry crumble. Must try.","abeeronthebeach","Feb 17, 2014"

Nice woody, subtly sour, almost vinous nose with hints of balsamic vinegar, oak, and dark fruits. The taste follows suit with even more of an earthy, vinous character with hints of sour cherries, leather, balsamic vinegar, brown bread, grape skins, and vanilla. The mouth feel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation, a tart finish, and huge drinkability for the style. Overall, this was the surprise highlight of a night filled with great beers.

4.13,-4.4,4,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Poured a brown hue with slightly reddish tints with minimal head and lace. Aroma is mostly tart cherries, touch of oak and booze, a little sweetness and dark fruit as well. Fuller body, almost sticky sweet at times, real smooth thanks to oak and the booze is mostly hidden with minor heat flashes on backend. A little bit of mild caramel or sugary sweetness, possibly sweet fruit tastes, but taste is mostly tart cherries and dark fruit with a sour edge. Everything is balanced and well-checked, though, so this beer is never overly sweet or tart/sour at times and is an enjoyable sipper throughout (the ABV starts to hit as you get near the bottom of the bottle). A good treat to have here and there.","clayrock81","Sep 03, 2013"

A blend if flavors fight to come forward, very enjoyable mouth feel. Some fruity sweetness but the tartness is not hidden either. Definitely worth having another!","MattLBC","Sep 01, 2013"

Unbelievably complex, this drinks like a fine pinot noir from Burgundy, but it towers above most peers of its kind - including most Flanders reds, which this is in the same league as, if not more complex. Excellent stuff, if you can get your hands on this vintage - otherwise, I'm sure most would work. One of the best candidates for cellaring in the beer world, period.","magictacosinus","Aug 27, 2013"

It pours a hazy copper-amber topped by a half-finger of glowing lightly off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises red wine vinegar, buttery toffee, light walnut, almond, and spicy greens. There's a lot going on here in the aroma, including a few things I can't quite put into words properly. Suffice it to say it's sour, lightly buttery, lightly nutty, and lightly spicy. The taste brings in more of the same (with the same sort of complexity), with the vinegar coming through as more of a citric-ish sourness. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda lightly gooey feel. Overall, a very nice, highly complex beer, one that's a struggle to wrap my brain around, and I'm all the happier for it.","TMoney2591","Oct 21, 2012"
4.59,6.2,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A rare gem once again procured from The Lion's Pride in Brunswick, Maine. This vintage 2010 brew has a hazy brown color with rusty edges, a polite scattering of off-white bubbles that surround an inner island on top, leaving a respectable lace. The aroma offers a beautiful blend of tart red wine and deep, woodsy malt and intense yeast. A beer you can enjoy just smelling. Wow. The flavor follows with a deliberate lemon sweet tart and briney brown bread malt. Absolutely to be savored! Suggestions of a nice chianti tempered by the deep earthy malt and lemony sweetness. This is so divinely balanced: sweet, tart, seaweed, mellow, sharp. And goes down so easy but you don't want to rush these flavors. There's an underlying vanilla that pushes the malt and other complexities tease the senses. Body is medium-plus, with a somewhat heavy feel, with low carbonation, but just right for this brew. I'm highly pleased and would say this was one of the best flavorfests I've enjoyed for many months. Don't pass on this if you are a fan of the sour/Flanders side of beer love!","Durge","Oct 12, 2012"

There's a small amount of lacing. The aroma is nice and tart, it smells like vinegar, red wine, oak, tart cherries and some plums. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but with the addition of some lemon. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with low/moderate carbonation.

About the farthest thing from beer I've tasted. Not getting a whole lot of the base biere de garde, but berries, wine, oak, grape and a hint of balsamic vinegar make for a great bouquet. Acidity is at about medium with some tang on the end, about medium build, light carb within a half hour. Pretty great stuff and something to sip on for an hour or so.","BARFLYB","Jul 29, 2012"

Taste is an incredible sour cherry flavor, but does not overwhelm with sour, it is very balanced. As I continued to sip, other fruits came through, strawberries and apples most predominantly. There is a still a decent malt/caramel sweetness to it as well. Very complex, I am not sure I can even list all the flavors. Its nice that it is sour, but that does not overwhelm the other flavors. As high as it is in ABV, with low carbonation, and with 3 blends in the brew, it is still rather light in your mouth.

An interesting beer that is for sure, the slight carbonation makes it seem that much more wine-like.

4.47,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2005 vintage, bottle #276. This one was a little bit hazy and a dull reddish orange. It had a frothy ring of off-white foam and produced a bit of spotty, sticky lacing. The aroma was on the funky, tart side, with notes of lemon and berry, leather, straw, salt and faint alcohol. Tart, earthy and funky flavour. Crackery malt with a little bread and some floral, lemony character, plus mild sour/cherry. Medium bodied with carbonation on the low side with an incredibly smooth texture. Light warmth and a bit dry, with spicy alcohol flavour in the finish. Nice complexity, yet surprisingly mellow. This beer drinks like it's 6-7%, which can really get you in trouble!","DrJay","0"

4.32,0,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This limited edition, expensive beer would've had popped a cork if it had one, it was foaming that much out of the bottle like champagne. It was a murky burgundy color and formed a huge light tan bubbly head that vanished quickly with little lace considering how it bubbled out of the bottle. The aroma was a mix of cherry, grape, whiskey and wine. The flavor was of cherries, sour apples and slightly of prunes. It had a medium light body and a tart, sudsy finish to it. A good beer, but fairly expensive and limted release make it a rare treat.","Wildman","Dec 05, 2007"

There was some vinous qualities in the beer as well as some wood tones as well. This goes the same for the taste. There is a sour, vinous taste with some wood and earth notes as well. The taste is really dominated (in a good way) by a sour funkiness.

4.12,-4.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"2005 Vintage. Pours a dark copper to amber red, hazy, with a very small flash of cream and white bubbles that gather on the surface and quickly disappear. Aroma is of nice tart apples and mellow sweet cherries, slightly lemony as well, along with some spices, vanilla, and dessert breadiness. Taste is a good sized tartness, slightly perfumy and soapy. A sweet fruitiness flashes mid-taste before a good sized woody dryness blends with the tartness into the aftertaste. Medium in body, mainly still with a good sized dryness that accentuates the tartness. Very nice aroma on this beer, the taste was very good as well, not as multi dimensional as the aroma though in my opinion. While I definitely enjoyed the tart flavors the perfumy and soapy finish to the tartness was not as pleasing. Alcohol was not completely unnoticeable but did not at all seem to be in the 15 percent range as stated on the label. Very enjoyable and interesting beer.","hoppymeal","Apr 26, 2007"
4.69,8.6,3.5,4.5,5,4,5,"The body is surprisingly thin. Silky smooth. Rounded out nicely in the oak. Little carbonation to speak of. Not even a hint of alcohol.

4.06,-6,2.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Bottle courtesy of IMtheOptimator: Poured a medium amber color ale with a small foamy head with limited retention or lacing. Aroma of oak and tart is pretty enticing. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt, oak and some vinous character. Body was about medium full with some very low carbonation. I could not detect any alcohol which is quite a feat at 14% but could feel the effect afterward. Interesting combination between the malt presence of a Biere de Garde and a Flander Red oak presence.","Phyl21ca","Feb 04, 2007"

4.8,11.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"750 ml bottle, 8 oz sample. This one pours a deep burgundy color with a very light head that settles at a ring around the top of the brew. This one has ruby highlites, with no carbonation and is fairly clear. Nice looker. The aroma on this one is big in tanniny oak, light puffs of alcohol, wine-like vinous fruits. Lots of wine character here. The flavor is even more divine. Huge Shiraz spiceyness and oak tannin character. It has a slight sourness, and a mild alcohol. This one is definately barrel aged first, with the beer being secondary to it. Definate notes of light mustyness as well. I really like this a lot. The feel is moderate, with no carbonation. It is pretty dry as well. I am very impressed with this one. It has a lot of really nice red wine character, with enough of the musty and sour character I like from a farmhouse beer. With the 10% ABV, it is detectable, but not at all obtrusive. I think it even adds a nice complexity here. This one was worth the big price tag.","kmpitz2","Jul 27, 2006"
4.65,7.6,5,5,5,3.5,4,"Truly a very wild ride. Deep brown and rusty in color -it looks like a glass of french roast coffee but shows good color separation. The nose is of bing cherries with a touch of booziness (perhaps from the use of grappa barrels). It's a little floral too, lavendar and exotic spices. Awesome stuff! A great beer to lay down a while (it still shows some youthful hard edges) and definitely a favorite for wine drinkers.","bhooper","Jul 01, 2006"
3.63,-16,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Dark and opaque purple-brown color, head is fairly nice, big bubbles and average duration. Laces in fat rings. Boozy aroma, seems to have a lot of grape influence, but not being an appreciator of wines, it just seems rather heavy and oppressive. Mouthfeel is almost thick, carbonation underdone but still apparent. For me, a lot of the delicate spiciness and yeastiness of the beer (at least what may have been the original beer) is overwhelmed by a heavy application of alcohol as in fortified red wine, especially by the swallow, which has a peppery tannic quality to it. The impression seems very pronounced. Some bittersweet chocolate helps out on this one. Frankly, I can appreciate the time and effort in making this brew, but I'm not particularly impressed with the profile and its not worth the cost to me, but other's mileage should vary.","ADR","Beers"
4.72,9.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"I tried this yesterday at the Seattle International Beerfest. It is really hard to pin down what exactly was going on with it. First of all, it pours a translucent brown with a reddish tint to it. The tan head disappears almost instantly. Smelling it, one gets a wiff of fruit before beer, kind of an apple-grape mixture. There is no bite to it, the taste being incredibly smooth, and it feels almost like champagne on the tongue. Really toes the line between sparkling wine and beer. Aside from being exorbitantly pricey, manages to be a very drinkable beer despite the slight sourness and overall conglomerate of tastes.","nkurz129","0"
