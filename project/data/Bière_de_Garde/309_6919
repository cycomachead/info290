2.82,-14.3,2,2.5,3,3,3,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the surprising inclusions throughout the taste.

3.55,7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear amber color. Nose a little white wine (one feels indeed raisins) with light winds of tannins (probably due to the cork). Entry into mouth a little acid, but the drink quickly became silky mouth rounded and has good hops (and usually cereals) fairly well controlled.

4.3,30.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"For beeing a light lager this Blondie is not pale at all. First I thought the smell was unusal and confusing.But the strong elements of citrus and herbs from north France are actually very tasty after drinking the beer at several times. You will learn how to love it. Jenlain has more of an attitude of an amber redhead blonde with special elements of honey and apricot notes, nice colour, crispy at first. Served at 8 degrees it tends to feel more creamy and has the foam that goes well with food. Warmer, Jenlain has a full body taste and is something of a springbeer. Jenlain Blonde is also more worth while for the female tongue. Dont ask me why.Ask your girlfriends.And remember thatJenlain is indeed french...You hated Piaf at first too, gave her bad reviews, you did not see the splendor, the rest is history","piapopilin","Jun 23, 2010"

2.58,-21.6,4,3.5,2,3,2,"This beer started out with some promise, but alas no. It pours a golden orange color with a decent creamy, slightly efforvescent head, a bit of lacing too. The aroma right out of the bottle was definitely a bit musty, but that mellowed to a sweet maltiness, and some fairly typical Belgian yeasty floral notes are coming through. The taste is quite off. There is a bite to this beer that is not good, although there are some of the clove type hints, a big palate, and Belgian type yeasty floral sweetness, but this is all terribly compromised by a finish that is not good. There is a cheapness to the finish, that detracts substantially from what could have been a decent Beglian Blonde. The finish is a bit perfume like in its bite and it just lasts and lasts. This one is going down the drain. It's unfortunate.","albern","Jun 03, 2008"

Its just a touch. Feel is good. The right level of bubble on the tongue and a smooth liquid experience. Highly drinkable and very much worth trying.","RblWthACoz","Nov 03, 2007"
4.37,32.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours out a chill-hazed blonde with lively bubbles and a frothy, decent sized head. Leaves some sheets of lace. Smell is a mix of honey, fresh baked bread, stone fruits, and floral hops. Has an interesting cedar-like mustiness to it that is just great. Flavor leans toward a sweet and jasmine-like flavor with hints of white raisins, mint, and passion fruit. Bready and overall nice. Feels rather soft in the mouth and has a solid low-to-medium weight. Nice drinker and reminds me of a mix of a pilsner and a blonde ale with a lot of interesting complexities.","goochpunch","Oct 22, 2007"
3.33,1.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear, gold with moderate head development that settles fairly quickly. Smell is sweet and malty with a faint, underlying skunkiness. Peppery spiciness to the aroma. Taste is sweet with a nectar-like quality. Mouthfeel is a little on the sticky side. Carbonation is adequate and finish is dry. Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer. Fairly average, but definitely worth drinking.","hammer09","Oct 17, 2007"

I've got a penchant for the more sugary beers though, so I can see how some might not care for it. Still, with only two glasses, I'm not sure how easily I'd be able to suck down another bottle or two. My favorite style, and a pretty nice example.

3.97,20.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured a light soft yellow amber with a thin white head and no real lace or retention.

Lots of body, a little slack on the carbonation, but not slick or oily. A good solid performer. Lots of intricate flavors, especially as it warmed. Overall this was very nice, and a good Blonde ale.

It is not just that the beer is old and way past it's prime, it is that you can tell that its prime wasn't all that great to begin with. Perhaps it is that I am not much for most (not all) French beers. They seem to have a common flavor that is rather sharp and metallic, so I guess it is the water.

The flavor was good and if you are a malt lover that you will feel right at home with this baby. The big malty flavors hit you right off the bat with a complex sweetness that is not overbearing but the thick mouthfeel kind of kills the drinkability for me.

Quite dry and crisp, but also with notes of more juniper, and a slight soapyness later on. Finishes dry.

3.68,11.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"Nice foamy white head, mountainous. Clear gold hue displaying minimal carbonation. Big malty aroma, pils like with an exquisite sea air component melting well with the grassy and hay-like farmhouse elements. The straw scent may come up a bit too much up front to my liking, but it definitely makes me feel for a pils. Musty, mellow weird herbs, alga or with an aquatic feel anyway. Light palate, malty despite a hop crunch toward the finish, but it never becomes too dry. Pleasant foamy mouthfeel, biting carbonation, rounder than a pilsner, but just as refreshing.","Rastacouere","Sep 02, 2004"

2.31,-29.8,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,1.5,"Pours out a pale golden color with a nice amount of carbonation that stays with you until the end. So far so good right? Well the smell was pretty average. Light dose of hops along with some slight malts, and some grainy like aromas along with some fruitiness hidden in the background. Smelled almost like a pils. Sweetness and more sweetness. This beer got more unbearable the more you drink it. The cloyingness is just too much. Some hops do bite, but it's so sweet that it doesn't matter. Some fruit also pokes through, but again, the sweetness takes over. Mouthfeel was light-medium with some medium carbonation, but it's quite cloying. 22oz bottle of ...yuck! Never buying this again, but I will try their beire de garden to see if they can redeem themselves.","necoadam","Aug 06, 2004"

3.09,-6.1,2.5,3.5,3,3,3,"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is decent. It has a mild pale malt scent with a slight green bottle skunkiness that lingers on the nose. It smells refreshing, but is a bit dry. The taste is a little above average. It has a very sweet flavor. It boasts of pale malts, light hops, and a thick finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a weird brew. It's light in color and aroma, but it has a thick mouthfeel and a super sweet taste. I guess it's good, but nothing I would ever buy again.","WesWes","Sep 29, 2003"

3.23,-1.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"It appears that this beer is a dumbed-down version of a Biere de Garde. Clear, more mild. There is no exotic fruit, nor earth, nor even the slightest peppery bite of yeast to give it structure. It is malty and sweetly alcoholic. The texture is vaguely creamy. The intention seems to be good, but the result is a beer that is in a stylistic limbo. Well crafted nevertheless.","putnam","May 07, 2003"

4.23,28.6,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"650 ml bottle. I don't normally remark on the packaging - as it differs from country to country, etc. - but the tall, painted label, green glass bottle with the ridged neck is very nice. There's only one problem... the beer is skunked! That's fairly disturbing since it's not cheap! It pours a hazy golden with a very light orange cast and a thin, creamy, bright white head. I can't pick up anything in the aroma beyond the skunkiness. Based on that I'd guess that it's got a fairly hoppy aroma when fresh, but I can't be sure. The body is medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that leaves it creamy and surprisingly smooth in the mouth. Interestingly, it does not seem to be bottle conditioned (no yeast in the bottom of the bottle), although it might be with the yeast still in suspension (explaining the haze). The flavor is very nice but quite one-sided. There's a light fruitiness (soft summer fruits) and a rich, very soft and nicely rounded, sweet and lightly earthy maltiness that's well entwined with a light hoppiness. Surprisingly malty! What hops are present seem lightly grassy and fairly spicy. The bitterness is well-balanced and supports the rich malt character and dries out the long finish as well as leaving a lingering bitter note. I'd hope that I can one day taste this beer without the skunked character.","NeroFiddled","0"
