4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly cloudy nearly opaque reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, prune, pear, apple, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt notes and fruity esters; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, molasses, raisin, pear, apple, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, pear, apple, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark malt and fruity ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice doppelbock. All around good complexity, balance, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 01, 2013"

Nose is really quite nice with a good amount of sweetness along with some toffee, caramel, and fruit character. The flavor isn't quite as impressive. It lost a bit of the sweetness from the nose and also has a noticeable level of bitterness. Mouthfeel is really nice and I like the overall level of sweetness in this. Slightly bitter.

There is a complex blend of rich malt characteristics in the aroma, and while some of this complexity carries over into the flavor, it is not as enjoyable.

A very sweet taste in a thick and heavy, somewhat syrupy beer. Still goes down smooth and creamy, as I would say there is caramel, honey, gum and maybe butterscotch mixed in with hints of dark fruit (not so much tropical) and very minor hop presence to balance the beer. Finishes with a dry, crisp yet thick and smooth mouthfeel; definitely a sipper. Great beer and one of the better dopplebocks I have tried.","clayrock81","Dec 01, 2008"
4.3,5.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Taste - Nice mellow sweetness, not as sticky sweet as others that I have had. The alcohol seems to be very well hidden here. Sweet roasted malt with flavors of cocoa more than anything else. Chocolate covered cherries. Now I will also make a new descriptive characteristic for doppelbocks such as this that I haven't used before. This style of beer is "tobbaccoey." Yes, it tastes like raw chewing tobbacco, which I find to be a pleasing taste even though I haven't chewed in years. (Of course now I am pondering, is there such a thing as a smoked doppelbock, and if so does it taste like an ash tray?) All jokes aside, while this surprisingly isn't the best doppelbock I have tried (Ayinger and Sam Adams in my opinion make the best ones) this is still a pretty damn good and very drinkable doppelbock. It was also pretty reasonably priced where I found it so I definately will have some bias towards it.","Bobo77","Oct 24, 2008"

This Tucher Doppelbock is just what I want when drinking this style,big malts,rich caramely decadence,fully ripened dark fruits and gritty/earthy yeast.

Richly malty aromas, with toffee, cinammon, caramel, and even a touch of mint. A bit bready on the end and not hot at all. The taste is equally malty, and even a bit winey. A little thinner than one might expect, but very smooth. The maltiness has notes of raisins, chocolate, light spice, and a bit of herbalness. Nice. Drinks well, but it is rich, although quite smooth. Also, unlike the nose, the taste has a little bit of alcohol heat as well. Still, a very nice Doppelbock.","Georgiabeer","Apr 29, 2008"

The aroma gives a lot, rich caramels and bready malts, some toffee, some nice stuff. But its much better to drink, a range of delicious things going on. There are the rich malts of caramels, of toffee, the fruits dark and juicy, some sweet molasses and perhaps a touch of chocolate. The mouth is nicely carbonated, very fine and even, smooth, clean, good body. This is a fine beer, one I should revisit soon.","objectivemonkey","Apr 18, 2008"

Taste is mostly consistent throughout. Nothing real complex but very flavorful. Too sweet for my tastes but a very good beer for its style. Carbonation is just right.

Body is an attractive blackish brown with hints of ruby when held to light. Nose is spicey and rustic with woodsy malt and dark sweet notes. Maybe hints of banana bread. A mellow malty sweetness enters the mouth with minglings os belgium waffles, toasty vanilla and over ripe bananas. Warms the belly well and tells of the 7.2% alchol without being obtrusive at all. This is not overly malty and thick as some bocks are. Very enjoyable and nicely drinkable. Mouthfeel is slightly thick but only because the taste buds cry for more.","SPLITGRIN","Feb 21, 2008"

I can't wait for doppel weather to return! Smell is plenty of caramel and toasted cereal, this guy is all malt, for certain. Taste, sadly, while very nice indeed, is very average for the style. I was hoping for so much more from this one. Mouthfeel is quite lovely, as well, being very solid, and while not exactly what I'd call "thick", it's certainly full bodied.

4.2,2.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"One of the better doppels, not quite in the class of Celebrator, but probably as good as any of the rest. Pours darker, ala Celebrator, and has similar chocolate-like flavor. Not as much body or taste, however. This one is hard to find around here, but I grab it every time I go by the one store that has it.

Good full body. Great beer.","Sixpack595","Apr 04, 2004"

Sweet caramel malt flavors predominate, body is fairly full and the finish seems rather dry for the style. The carbonation seems a little lower than other wheat beers. There's some nice raisiny notes that I normally associate with a Wee Heavy. Smooth, strong and malty, this beer would frighten hopheads, but on this cool evening, the malt if fortifies and the alcohol warms me up nicely.","marcobrau","Apr 04, 2004"

4.5,10,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A very deep mahogany body reveals ruby highlights when held to the light, and its foamy tan head holds well but eventually drops to a wide, creamy collar and whispy surface covering. The nose displays toffee-like caramelized sugars and lightly toasted bready notes. It's medium-full body and very fine carbonation lends it a velvety texture in the mouth. The flavor offers a luxurious maltiness that's fairly complex with notes of caramel, toffee, plum, honey, brandy-soaked cake, dried dark fruit, light powdered cocoa and some very subtle leafy hops. The rich, and somewhat sweet malt character is perfectly balanced by a firm bitterness that remains in the wings as it crosses the palate, but then combines with the alcohol to dry out the finish. Some malty notes of caramel and dripping dark fruit linger in the aftertaste. An classic example of the style that's quite rich and satisfying but also very drinkable!","NeroFiddled","Mar 03, 2004"
4.1,0.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a mahogany color with ruby tinting. Small beige head doesn't stick around very long. Aroma is of molasses, butterscotch, prunes, and raisins. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with medium carbonation. Taste is molasses and toffee, with earthy hops to bitter. Munich maltiness is here in abundance. Finishes with a bitter toffee aftertaste. Lacks some complexity in flavor and aroma to be top five for style, but is very well done and quite enjoyable.","merlin48","Feb 25, 2004"
4.25,3.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours with a creamily thick tan head of large bubbles, with firm retention. A little sticky cling before the head starts to fade out to off-white swirlers. Color is of milk chocolate; beer appears murky, but with near-orange highlights at the perimeter. Aromas of light caramel and an oily, carob-like sweetness with a cake-and-frosting nosefeel. With agitation and warmth, savory nuttiness emerges and rounds out with the alcohol, suggesting hazelnut liqueur. Taste features more big caramel punctuated by spices--cinnamon, nutmeg. Very sweet but never cloying; root beer sweetnesses meld with the spice (and hops?) into sassafras, a taste that I just really like. Body a bit thin but well-carbonated; a firmness to the spicy yeast and again somewhat pastryish with a leafy finish. A real fine drinkability, at once rich and refreshing; perhaps more of a cool-weather warmer than a truly wintry brew. At the $3.50 I paid for a pint, this was a bargain. I will seek this again.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Feb 03, 2004"

Sweet, sweet malt. More sweet molasses in the front: yeasty, bready. Alcohol is evident when cool. Deep, deep malt fills the middle, leading to a pure malt finish. More alcohol, though it definitely fades with temp. This is an excellent malt monster: yeasty, bready... almost to the point of cheese at temp, but not in a bad way. Major cream.

3.66,-10.5,3,4.5,3.5,4,3,"Well, this is a mottled review. The beer was completely flat...the bottlecap seal was leaky. This beer pours out clear, yet very dark brown, mahogany in color, much darker than other dopplebocks I've had. Their is no head, lacing or retention secondary to the lack of carbonation. The aroma is vinous and sweet, like a port, with an intense smell of prune juice, raisins, maple syrup, rotting black cherries, vanilla extract, and a hint of dark molasses...wow..this reminds me of Sam Adams Triple Bock. Despite the heavy aroma, the mouthfeel and body are suprisingly light, and the sugar content is less than expected. The bitterness is extremely mild, and the mouthfeel is smooth. There is a distinct hint of smoke towards the finish. There is a pleasant warming sensation as it goes down the tube, but the lack of carbonation feels gross. Despite this, I can tell this is a quality brew and am excited to try a fresh bottle. Update to follow...","Mitchster","Sep 22, 2003"

The taste is complex: both sweet and caramel at the fore, followed by molasses and a nice hop bite. The alcohol makes its presence know too...but very subtle.

I see reviews with a grape flavors but I didn't pick up any. I might have got some wine flavor though. Maybe I got a bad batch but not my favorite version of this style.
