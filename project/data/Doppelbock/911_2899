4.17,-3,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"one of the top beers in germany, according to this sight, and i have to admit, its taken me awhile to fine one, and i may have been blinded slightly by the hype, but as i sit down to this frothing glass of crystal clear but super dark brown brew that is kriek cherry red in bright light, do i realize and appreciate just how good this is. sometimes i think we lose track of traditional styles, and how good the good ones are, people dont rave about dopplebock, it doesnt have pounds of dry hops, bacteria, or bourbon barrels, so it slips under the radar, and that is unfortunate because it is deserving of far higher praise. as that style goes, this one is one of the better going. beautiful caramelized barley sugars here in nose and taste, and ancient yeast strain, and a pleasing softness. its so simple but yet so deep, like a well made bread pudding, save some of the residual sugar. feels like the one that is most often copied. its hard to call it as nuanced as some of the crazy wilds out there, but its quality is through the roof. amazing its a lager, i often think that with dopplebock, but especially here, there is so much yeast flavor. affordable world class german beer has the weird distinction of being shelf turd material here in colorado. i hate that, because this is what beer should be, and beer economy, but i can only imagine this fresh on tap at the source. oh baby!","StonedTrippin","Saturday at 11:39 AM"

Dark brown, though not cloudy, light amber shining through. Sweet roasted malty nose, smells of dried cherries and a hint of cranberries. Tastes of milk chocolate, caramel, some cocoa, followed by darker fruits and coffee on aftertaste. Long after the last sip, I detect some lingering metallic tartness toward back of tongue. Very creamy, velvety mouthfeel, low carbonation with a medium dry finish. This is a very pleasant dopplebock with a fine balance, and hides its stronger alcohol well. Not overly complex, great feel and body, a real treat. Will definitely buy again.","sporklift87","Mar 23, 2015"

Once again, clean malt flavor in the taste, with all due caramel.  There is just a hint of smoked meat in the integrity of the roasted malts.  Caramel, dark fruits, raw sugar, but balanced and graceful. Malty, robust flavor. Not too sweet nor strong, this is a world class beer.  Top notch doppelbock brewed perfectly to style.

Rich malt aroma of caramel malt, brown bread, nuts and dark dried fruit. Flavor follows, with dark bready and caramel malt up front backed by dark dried fruit, particularly figs and dates, a little dark fresh fruit, a hint of rye. Mild grassy hops in the finish. Good medium body with active carbonation (not producing much of a head, oddly enough). A rich, satisfying doppelbock with the best dark brown bread character of any I've tried. Lots of depth and smooth into the finish. A tempting malt bomb of a beer. Glad this brewery is available again in the Northwest.","LiquidAmber","Jul 13, 2014"

The flavor provided is big in quantity; it's toasty, bready, a little bit sweet, and has a breath of alcohol whicc compliments rather than disturbs the chemistry of the beer. It's medium full bodied, which is fitting, though perhaps not as warming as I expected given the talk of this beer.

The nose comprises dry toffee and lightly-toasted biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light vanilla bean and watered-down cocoa. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, this stuff is about as painfully average as you can get. Something tells me it's all about unattainability here: Because this stuff requires at least an overseas trade or a vacation or a lucky hookup, it's perceived as better than it really is.

Nose is somewhat dull and doesn't really reveal all that much - just a suggestion of sweetness. Taste is malty, albeit not overly sweet, and somewhat subdued on the backend. There's also a hint of prunes and a faint, German yeast character. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Overall, a very solid and drinkable doppelbock; however, definitely lower in alcohol than many of the other representations of the style that I've tried.

The aroma is amazing. Huge notes of caramelized sugars. Toffee and toasted breads. Dates and figs cover just a hint of booze. Super complex nose. The flavor starts off with dark fruits. Dates with just a little prune. Brown sugar and caramel. Toast mingling with earthy hops. Just a tiny hint of booze as it warms. The mouthfeel is light and creamy with just a bit of dryness on the finish. Man, this a fantastic beer. I'm so glad I finally got to try it.","hwwty4","Oct 17, 2011"

The nose is all toasty malt, with hints of brown bread, caramel, chocolate, and just a touch of banana and dark fruit. The taste is much the same with loads of toasted malt, brown sugar and caramel along with hints of toffee and chocolate. The dark fruits really come out as it warms, and the sweetness becomes more intense. The hops are subtle, but add just enough bitterness to keep it from being too sweet. The mouthfeel is really creamy and smoothe. I'm not a huge bock beer fan, but this is a world class beer that really represents the style well.","beerdrifter","Sep 01, 2011"

4.74,10.2,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"cherry-lacquered brown in color with a dense, spongy, 3/4" tan head riding on top for the duration of the beer. Aroma is delicately composed of french silk pie with chocolate graham crust, stark chocolate toffee, flame licked tree bark, and turtle fudge frozen custard. Flavor chimes in as lighter fairing. Cocoa dusted, crushed graham crackers. Silky chocolate trait folds back the fragile flavor layers. Liquefied chocolate wafers emit a vibe akin to a touch of room temp hot chocolate, cooled at its warmest state with an ice cube or two and dulled it down by doing so. Mildly roasted accents with circumstantial caramel drizzles. Errs on the light side, gently tossing over the tongue with a moment’s respite at more concrete semi-chocolate characteristics. A mild chocolate butterscotch generality gently weaves in and out as we go along.","KrautAficionado","Jul 01, 2011"

The smell continues to get better with time and as the beer acclimates toward room temp, but the smell has the roasted malt smell one loves in this style of beer. The taste is exceptional with its malt, slight hop bitterness, and the overall mouthfeel is exploding with flavor once again as the beer acclimates.

Caramel, biscuit and light toast with a very mild heat on the slightly sweet finish. Medium-to-full-bodied with moderate carbonation and a lightly sweet finish.

The taste is a real nice balance. Slightly sweet with fruit like characteristics and a nice bready, biscuity backbone that balances it all out. Ends pretty cleanly without any apparent bitterness.

The aroma is wonderfully fresh with fresh dough and toffee highlights. Hops are very subtle as the maltiness leads the way. The taste is filled with sweet caramels and toffee-like sugars. A slightly metallic sharpness seems to be a product of the hops and crystal malt. Not all that complex, but superbly layered. A coarse finish produced by the hops creates a perfect balance between the insanely smooth body and mouthfeel. As it warms, the sweetness increases and it goes down easier with each sip.

Taste follows with some sweet maltiness up front, golden raisin sweetness, fruit and berries, caramel, a great molasses quality, toasty grains lead to a nice crisp hop quality in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body, carbonation is on the low side which allows the malty sweetness to weigh slightly on the palate before a small peppery crispness works to balance it out towards the finish.

4.62,7.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear reddish brown with a garnet, purplish hue when held up to the light. A one finger cap of dense, off-white foam appeared after the pour, settling to a skim of fine bubbles and solid collar after a few minutes. Sticky, spotty lacing. Tons of malt character in the aroma, very cakey and bready, rich with notes of toast and biscuit. It had some fruit character as well, mild dried fruits like raisins and figs. Flashes of dry cocoa and darker malts, plus a bit of smoke, appeared as it warmed too. There was a solid bitterness lying beneath the malt flavour, never too far forward yet providing the necessary balance. Light citrus mid-palate hung around through the finish. Alcohol was present from the start, but stayed light and balanced throughout. Malt sweetness played the dominant role, but the caramelized sugar and bread flavours weren't let run wild. Notes of cake and toffee, perhaps a bit of biscuit, floated in and out of focus, along with some dried fruit sweetness and a hint of yeast. The finish wasn't overlong, but a balanced combination of flavours lingered for a while on the palate. Medium bodied with medium/low, well integrated carbonation. Texture was a bit creamy and chewy. This stuff is superb. I was expecting a lot of malt, but was pleasantly surprised by the complexity of flavours present. That quality made this a pleasure to drink, and very easy to polish off a bottle.","DrJay","Sep 21, 2008"

Pours a very dark brown with ruby highlights. The head is not bad, but nothing special, and it fades fairly quickly to a thin swirly head. Smells of dark pumpernickel bread, very dry malt, blackstrap molasses, and an earthy bitterness. Black bread in a glass. The taste is even richer and breadier, but with some wonderful dark bitterness laced throughout. More black bread, and an earthy, grainy bitterness, especially at the finish with dark chocolate bitterness. Up front there is ssome creamy sweetness to start things off. Very complex, chewy, and rich. What a wonderful beer! Creamy, rich, stiff, and bitter in turns as far as mouthfeel goes.

I'd be curious what a fresh bottle of this would taste like, though this one is not noticeably over the hill in any way.

4.78,11.2,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"This is what a "beerlover" like me loves. Best before 28-09-05. Presentation is how you want it to be for a DarkDoubleBock. Perfect, yellowish and longlasting thick head. Most beautifull darkbrown color you can get in your brew and totaly clear. Nose is mostly maltarome with lots of roast. Further sweet and yeastfruity and even some hops in background. Taste is mostly exceptional being as full as it is, burnt, sweetmalty, hoppy and having a bitterweet aftertaste! Mouthfeel is like taste; exceptional and don't know if any beer make so much contact with your tasting pupils; just every one is giving this top enjoyment tinkle. Drinkability is then off course also ok but is maybe overfeeding you. Highly recomendable!","paterlodie","Dec 19, 2004"

Rich, bold, and ultra smooth. Pours a classic, brownish dark amber, white tiny bubble head. Nose is pure rich malt. Wonderfully smooth and rich mouthfeel. Notes of dark caramel, raisins, molasas, rum, tastes like a nice sweet light chocolate brownie. Complex, smooth and satisfying. If you can find some, buy it.","Billolick","Oct 28, 2004"

The aroma is not very noticeable but at first sip all thoughts of weakness are thrown out the window. It has a very noticeable doppelbock taste that is not as bitter as german dunkells but is not week due to this. This is definitely a beer that I will be buying more of. I guess as they say good things in life will come to you if you wait and this was no exception.","paulaner","Oct 01, 2004"

4.67,8.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Generous off-white head forms atop the dark brown body. Head is foamy, frothy, sticky, moderately lasting. Light ruby hints make the color seem complex. A truck of malt in the aroma. Various flavours of smoked fruits, red berries, blue berries, cherries, light smoke, light roast. Terrific integration of the aromatic components. Another sniff gave me mineralic or salty notes. Another hinted me toward bread. Yet another proposed candy sweetness almost approaching honey. If the aroma contained a truck of malt, its 2 trucks you have when sipping. Its intensity is pushed further although always staying in the subtlety grace as opposed to a celebrator. Incredible precision, every angle is well cut. Bolder than the aroma in its leathery expression. Quite dry overall. Nut skin, roasty and earthy light hops finish. Could last a little longer perhaps. It really tastes like fresh and clean water was used. Incredible malt depth they have there. Gets even better as it warms, close to a 10 as far as taste is concerned, I guess just a bit more length would nail it. Polite medium to full body, high carbonation is at the limit of being too much. Stellar doppelbock that grows on you sips after sips. New developments and happenings every time. 2 thumbs up to Stephen and his neighbor for this unique chance!","Rastacouere","Jul 20, 2004"

4.75,10.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"The appearance is a clear, deep burgandy in color. The head was slighly beige in color which slowly dissispated into a thin lace. This brew is about malt, but in a very subtle, not obvious way. The maltiness fragrance was very noticeable on the nose. The body is full and distinctive. The taste can only be characterised as very a smooth, silky mouthfeel. The maltiness flavor dominates up front with some apparent caramel and toffee tones. The hops are present, but solely in a supporting role providing a very delightful dry finish. It has to be one of the finest doppelbock brewed on the planet Earth. I really look forward to having this brew on draft. A truly exquiste brew!!","rotsaruch","May 01, 2004"

4.5,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A brownish dense head disappears into a very thin color. The color is impressive: a beautiful brown-red, almost purple, opaque. The smell is of dark malts, non sweet caramel, and a warming winy grapes aspect. The taste is very enjoyable and complex. Raisins with a sweet and refreshing citric aspect (almost like the soda aspect of Belgian stouts); then dark malts, with a thick almost chewy impression of chocolate; the chocolate announces the veil of hoppiness that covers the mouth without overwhelming it. Finally, a warm alcohol feeling. Very well balanced. My favorite Doppelbock .","tjd25","Mar 30, 2004"

I'm really glad that I did, as this is probably the best Doppelbock being made! This was dark as night, with some rusty edges of maroon and brown. The head was small, tan, and short-lived. The aromas were of fresh bavarian soft pretzels, deepl malts, and slight floral hops on the finish. The taste was extremely malty, not too sweet, and hoppy on the finish. The perfect doppel! The mouthfeel was thick, creamy, and oh-so-smooth going down, and the drinkability was excellent.

It's about 40-45 min. outside of Munich on the S-Bahn (toward Herrsching) but well worth the trip. We had a perfectly clear day to visit this gorgeous hilltop setting with visibility for miles it seemed. As majestic as the scenery was the beer, brewed here for more than 500 years. Superb doppelbock, big with malty goodness, the real deal.  The monks sacrificed little while fasting on this liquid bread.","John","Beers"
