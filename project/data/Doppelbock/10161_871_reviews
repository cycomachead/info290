"Poured handsomely and perfectly clear with ambers, mahogany and a burnt orange blush.  Tan head of creamy foam that lasted well.  Nose is shy and subtle but clean. No alcohol.  A demure hint of dark fruits wait elegantly behind a rich and sweet malt. Taste is smooth and creamy. Not as crisp as some of the german dopplebocks.  But this malt does evolve.  It is rich and has a bit of the bread crust.  Supple smooth and medium mouthfeel. Finishes softly with good balance and begins to show a sweet little nuttiness as it warms.  Dark fruits are vague but substantial enough to finish this one with a light sweetness and a hint of brown sugar."
"Overall:  very good and hearty brew."
""
""
""
"Tried this while out to eat and was pleasantly surprised.  It is a little lighter (to me at least) than some of the German Dop's in mouth-feel, even though the ABV is still fairly high.  I like it!"
""
"Pours a reddish/auburn. Slightly sweet with a hint of caramel. A malty doughy flavor. Smooth and enjoyable. Would buy  it again."

"good flavor. Nice malt foward middle but thin mouthfeel. just under par for this style."
""
""
""
""
"I get a funky taste from this beer.  EBS has the same thing.  I do not like it, so hard to rate beer - Taking the after taste out of it beer has other good qualities."
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely fantastic. And a cool logo to boot."
""
""
"Probably would not get this again, even if I could find a bottle with a recent brew date."
""

""
""
"The apparent content of adjunct and sweetness level did bother me a bit. I would pass it next time."
""
""
""
"Overall- A pretty fair beer, I think this would go good with pasta and the next time I am at an Italian restaurant that carries this beer I will give it another try."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good - not up to German standards perhaps but drinkable enough. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are sweet, malty and mildly fruity. Nice body. Possesses a subtle but rounded character that goes down easily. Worth trying if you come across it."

"pretty Decent beer. Kind of a cross between a brown ale, lager and doppelbock. Heavy alcohol burn at the end. Not really a doppel - more of a hybrid"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep Amber color. Malty but not heavy. Notes of caramel, maple and chocolate."
""
"Very similar to the more common Newcastle, but better."

"I was pleasantly surprised â€“ this was better than I expected and actually was a good doppel bock."
""

""
""
""
""
"I loved this one, it was really tasty. The taste was so smooth and lively, with an very good drinkability for the style. No alcohol was present whatsoever."
""
""
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a big tan head. Smells strongly of malt. The taste is initially a very sweet caramelized malt flavor then a touch of honey, and a hint of bitterness in the finish. Decent mouth feel. Overall a decent doppelbock, though I'd prefer a bit more complexity."

"Overall: Good beer. I would have this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light bodied for the style with modest carbonation. Has an overly sweet aftertaste. I like a good Doppelbock, but this one is far from good. Will avoid in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really very good stuff. For a brewery that makes their dough from yet another pale euro lager, I'm really pleased to see that this is quite widely available as well. It's significantly better than almost anything else the big Italian breweries seem to bring out."

"o: I cant believe this was dobblebock? It was closers to a traditional bock with a higher alcohol content. Many great German versions of doppels are easily available, try one of them over this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an easy drinker. While nothing really sticks out, there are no faults with this beer. It's a solid example of the style."
""
""
""

""
"overall - much better than the regular lager."

"I was intrigued when I saw this beer, as I am a fan of their Euro lager. I bought this for about 9.99 a sixer, which I think it is well worth. This is a straight up malt bomb treat and a perfect beer for the holidays. It has a strong dessert beer quality best enjoyed in short but frequent occasions amid the glittering lights and trees of Midwinter."
"Much more than I expected from one of the big boys of Italian brewing."

"Red and translucent beer with a quickly vanishing head, no lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is cold steel, alcohol, and cough syrup. Very sweet and fruity, sickly sweet even. Lots of banana, like a wheat beer. Thick & syrupy in the mouth, too much for me: buttery, even. Finish is lots of sweetness, too-much-alcohol-burn, and a weird metallic taste."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown in color with a 1-finger tan head that hangs around for a bit. Some spotting lacing was seen with each sip, but not much. The aroma is of caramel, dark fruits with a hint of chocolate. The taste was about the same with some light sweet chocolate nutty finish. Very easy to drink and goes down too easy. A great brew that has no harsh aftertaste at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown, sweet and honey scented to the nose. Little head that fades quickly to a layer of carbonation. Little to no lacing. It's sour and a bit boozy to the tongue. I feel like this beer could do so much more with its flavor. It doesn't blow me away at all. It goes down smooth and doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. Overall, this beer looks a lot better than it tastes. It's not awful but I don't think I'll be buying this again."

"O: pretty darn surprisingly good!... it would stand up fine against your random, no name German version.... better and truer than most American examples"
""

"O- Hey, a good beer. Can't complain about that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste is also sweet and malt forward with a low alcohol burn and quick lingering bite at the end. In some respects it reminded me of a well-aged, mellow barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Nice beer that is much more than I expected from a Italian brewer. It is a bit sweet for my taste but still worth a try."

"It pours out of the bottle a rich, dark-red hue that is reminiscent to Killian's but just more appealing - I felt it looked beautiful. The head pours red-tinged, pillowy, and with staying power - good lacing down the entire glass. I was slightly disappointed with the smell - I could only pull out a vague cherry malt, it was mostly barley and hops. The mouthfeel was good - just the right amount of carbonation, no stickiness or aftertaste, but a tiny bit watery. The taste, however, was superb. I could taste the distant cherry and even honey flavors the beer - I felt - offered, I was rewarded for my random selection indeed. Overall, I was very pleased with the beer - noticed it's high ABV soon after I downed it, and wished I had ordered another one for the road."

"this beer is far superior to the regular moretti. it pours a beautiful ruby red color with several inches of snow white head. the color is dense and deep, mildly intimidating, and very appetizing. the nose is fairly heavy on the red malt, some caramel sweetness, an alcoholic kick, some dried fruit, and plenty of minerals. the flavor though takes on a sort of bakery vibe, lots of doughy and toasty notes of different origins. there must be a good mix of grain happening here. there is a second or so of sweetness, but it doesn't last thankfully. the alcohol really cuts the residual sugar well, and this beer is in outstanding balance. I like it with pasta dishes, seafood, grilled meats, its really quite versatile. its got a lot of flavor and kick, without being at all filling, which may be its greatest asset. its unique in that way, and better than most euro imports on these grounds. I love the crispness of feel despite the color and size of this, and I like the active carbonation, which keeps it on the lighter side. a rusty aftertaste arises, and like the regular moretti, it is that indelible unique factor that makes this beer memorable for me. probably my favorite regular import from Italy, not counting the specialty stuff."
"Overall this beer was drinkable but I'll be looking for some better prospects before we head to Italy."

"Overall a very likable doppelbock that has slightly under-attenuated maltiness. A little lacking in the feel and smell as well."
""
"Nabbed a bottle at gnocco in down town nyc. Poured into branded glassware. Brew poured a watery purple with maroon highlights. No real head to spiral of.and no real lacing either. Smells heavy lager and rather macro. Taste however is much nicer bringing out nice nutmeg and dopplebock flavors. Easy drinker. Nothing supper special, but a fine tick at an Italian restraint."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is heavy and sweet, but not overbearingly so. I get hints of dried, dark fruit like plum, raisin, and fig. A solid brew with an unusual angle."
""
"A nice medium tinted dark beer. Smells nice but nothing overpowering comes through. Has a nice malty flavor with a little bitterness while drinking it but it does linger around the mouth long. medium consistency . A little pricey but overall a really good beer."
""
""
"smells kind of caramel-y, tastes the same, but with a little bitterness. i get the vanilla someone earlieer mentioned. easy to drink. kind of sweet. but very much different from the german version, for sure. nice abv, decent drink. love most stuff italian but not sure how heineken got its hands on it. i like the beer, though, and gave it a 4.5 for taste. more of a 4.25, but that doesnt exist...."
""
""
""
""
"D- A really tasty dopplebock. All the flavours are there but not overpowering. Great lager clean finish. A great winter evening beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy dark crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and dark fruits. Taste is much the same with a slight roast quality on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
"When I poured this one it has a nice reddish color body and no head just a thin lace on top of the body. The smell is sweet and malty. The taste has a nice roasted malt flavor and some dark fruit also with a hint of hop on the back of tongue. The mouth feel is kinda sticky, leaves a nice after taste of malt. Overall this is a good beer."
""
""
""
"o: delectable, would pair well with roasted meat or mild curry"
""
""
""
"Iâ€™ll admit Doppelbocks arenâ€™t my favorite style, but this is a pretty good example. Sweet, but not cloyingly so."
""
"A pretty good beer especially considering how boring Birra Moretti is. The ruby red body is nice. Nothing too strong on the nose or palate, but at least taste-wise you can tell there is a subtle complexity to it. The alcohol never really makes itself known, making for a pretty smooth doppelbock. I like that it isn't as thick or sweet as others in its alcohol range (Celebrator, Optimator), but at the same time a little stronger flavor overall would be nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not the best doppelbock out there, but pretty solid considering it comes from a macro brewery. If the nose did not have the unpleasant stale grain note, I would consider buying it again."
""
""
""
"O - good example of the style, I did enjoy it."
"O- Really surprisingly good and one I would certainly have again ... thinking of Italian foods it might pair with we came up with a cream sauce."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a slight lightness to wateriness around the edges. Carbonation is mid-level, creating a gentle foaming effect on the palate that render the mouthfeel to be smooth and soft. Closes out semi-dry with a hint of residual tannins and a modest sweet-stickiness around the lips. Spicy fusel alcohols (perhaps?) during close along back of throat somewhat detract and are somewhat unexpected for a 7.2% doppelbock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Paired this with some fine Italian cuisine, and have to admit it was a pleasant surprise, so much so, I ordered a second bottle. Glad to recommend."
""
"O: A very malt-centric brew - not surprising given the style. It's very sweet of course with little to no hop presence. Alcohol is well-hidden and it's overall fairly enjoyable, if a little simple. Not bad at all!"
""
""
""
"Not the best or the worst dopplebock I have tasted but definitely room for improvement."
"Atmosphere is very good. Nice body, full lingering head, and some persistent lacing. Nose is well balanced combination of malty character, and sweet and herbal tones. Flavor is subtly balanced tone of malt and sweet and bitters. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the solid malt flavoring throughout, and the smooth and integrated finish. The malts stand up through the entire brew, giving a full quality to the flavoring. By the finish, the flavor flattens out, but remains calm and even, while packing all the punch that it did from the start. Some of the malts, however, gave adjuncts and some borderline offensive mustiness through the middle, making this one just a bit more of a chore."
"RJT"
"O: Highly enjoyable doppelbock. I ordered a second with my meal and would recommend this Italian beer."
""

""
""
""

"O: Decent Dobblebock â€“ this is a beer I could have once in awhile and never more than one at a time."
""
""
""
"Another I tasted fresh in Italy.. Pours crystal clear maroon/chestnut brown. Nice-looking head dissipates rather quickly leaving behind no lacing. A lot more carbonated than expected. Flavors of mild caramel, vanilla, and stone fruit with some mild coffee flavors on the back end. More complex than I expected. Low hopping leaves this a little on the sweet side. looks and feels like an unsoured Flanders Red in terms of color, hopping, and background flavors."
""
"I found this beer and I enjoyed it. A wonderful Italian beer sw what complements this beer? Well I had it in S. Sioux City at Trattoria Fresca while chowing on some fantastic grilled sea food. You know calamari, octapus, and scallops! I drank it while watching AC Milan playing soccer or while listening to Giorgio Gaslini's cd entitled - Plays Sun Ra - on my Ipod!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Considering its strength and relatively full-bodied nature, this beer isn't that difficult to drink compared to other beers in the style."
""
""
"Overall.- Good beer, a bit strong to have more than one."
""
"definatly not my favorite style, but not a bad doppelbock. better than most american takes on the style, but still nothing i would really come back to."

"M: lager character nice ending with medium ending nothing to impressive but good enough."
"O- A malty mess here, not terrible but I would love some sort of balance."
"O- A nice tasting beer."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"O-a decent doppelbock that is very drinkable"
"Presentation: Packaged in an 11.2 ounce custom brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a Samuel Adams Boston Lager glass."
"I never anticipated that I would be impressed by an Italian doppelbock produced by a Dutch brewing conglomerate, but apparently I was wrong. This beer definitely holds its own, even with some of the better German versions of the style."
"Certainly one of the best Italian macro brews."
"Overall--A very balanced, drinkable and delicately complex bock beer. Very nice and pleasantly surprising. It's maybe just a tad too sweet, but I love the look, balance and strength of this beer."
"Overall I didn't think this was that bad. I was given this as a sample and only tried it because it was free. Not my style (AT ALL!!!) but a decent refreshing brew. If you are in to the European yeast danky beers, you will probably love this."
"Overall this beer wasn't that good. And If i'm going to have a doppel it's going to be Troegenator."
"PROST."
"12 oz bottle. Pours slightly hazy dark red with brown overtones and a small white head. Aroma is of caramel malt, cherry fruit and just a slight hint of hops. The body is full and smooth. Taste is sweet, caramel malt, cherry and hints of earthy hops. Long, sweet, but not cloying finish. I would prefer a little bit more hops for better balance in this brew."
"Haven't had one o' these since my beer passport back in college. Might as well try one again, as my d-bock appreciation has definitely gone way up since then. This one pours a clear garnet-amber topped by a finger of dusty cream foam. The nose comprises rye bread, yeast, toffee, butter, and a pinch of nutmeg. The taste holds notes of rye bread, blackened (nigh charred) bread, and toffee. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a nearly smooth, but also kinda watery, feel. Overall, I was not impressed at all by this brew, especially if it's trying to pass itself off as a doppelbock. It's not necessarily bad, just really weak."
"This beer poured out as a decent brown color with a tan colored head on it. The smell was a little malty but mostly had the larger funk aroma going on. The taste of the beer wasn't sweet enough in my opinion, the malts were lacking here. The mouthfeel was decent, giving off a little bit of a fuller body. Overall it's not the best Doppelbock out there and I feel that some of the character it should have is missing. I'll leave this one on the shelves."
"Last beer of the night....along with my pizza at Tulunes Southside Saloon...was La Rossa. Recommended by the Best Bartender in Johnstown....here's looking out Joe!!! The color is a rich ruby red with nice white head that laced quite well. The aroma was on the sweet and malty side. The taste was tough for me....there is a malt used in Europe that gives beer a nutra sweet flavor...and I don't like it. This beer starts off grainy then turns to a sweetness....which I attribute to a malt that I can't pinpoint. Mouthfeel was tough due the higher abv."
"I like it well enough but the higher alcohol isn't quite covered up enough for me I was surprised when I noted it was only 7%. The sort of medicinish flavor draws down a bit also. I like it, but am not in love with it."
"A deep brown with a beautiful thick head that unfortunately fades fast to a thin ring that retains throughout. Lace is left in creamy rings on my New Belgium tulip. The smell is sweet of honey, caramel, and a touch of booze, some earthy hops and something metallic. The taste is sweet and malty with honey and caramel up front immediately followed by spicy black pepper, a hint of roasted malt, a touch of coffee and some herbal bitterness. Alcohol could be hidden better. The booze bite doesn't blend well into the bitterness. It is also attacking my stomach. Overall it is a bit watery for a dopplebock. Not my favorite of this style, but very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"I haven't tried a true German doppelbock, but I'd have to think that this beer is spot on for the style. Really worth trying if you like this style."
"Overall: A passable doppelbock but certainly an improvement over other Italian beers I've had. If this is the direction Italian brewing is moving in, there should be quite a few interesting brews to try from them in the future."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."
"I liked this beer. Yes, it had a dark amber appearance, gentle aroma and carmel/chocolate combo in the taste. I enjoyed the sense of carbonation with a tad bitterness when I held a sip in my mouth. But, for me, it got an Exceptional because I did not feel the need to match this brew with some kind of snack. With that said, port wine cheddar spread is a nice complement to the La Rossa."
"O -Great tasting dopplebock for a nearly criminally cheap price! If you like this style, hit this one up if you haven't already"
"Moretti's Dopplebock (what they call La Rossa, though it is actually brown in color) is a very good version of a dopplebock. It's color and mouthfeel is typical of this type, but nothing exceptional. The most important part, the taste, is Moretti's shining moment. The La Rossa has a very nice, malty taste that masks the alcohol content, which is pretty high for beer. It is a very enjoyable beer to sip or drink."
"Drinkability - Well, the decent body and good amount of roasted malt make this drinkable. In terms of doppelbocks, this is very high on the list."
"Very modest, i don't think i will go back to this"
"Impressive looking beer, clear sparkling amber brown with a large creamy two finger off white head that lasts, with excellent lacing. Nice malty smell and medium creamy mouthfeel, but taste was disappointing. Really wanted to like this beer, but the taste just didn't match the appearance."
"D. It is a an easy drinking beer, but feels lighter than most doppelbock's, not exactly a ""meal in a bottle"". This is not something I'll drink again."
"Overall a nice fruity Doppelbock with a good alcohol warming at the end..."
"This seemed like it was going to be a good beer (appearance and smell), but flat out disappointed with the taste."
"GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"In a few weeks, with that same friend, we are going to have a similar side-by-side tasting of Salvator, Celebrator, Optimator, and La Rossa. After this tasting, I'll be able to give as proper comparison of some of the best dopplebocks available."
"This is one of the few Heineken-owned beers that I enjoy."
"Overall, a complex and good beer. But not the best I've had."
"A very nice dopplebock and a great value. I also had this one a while back at an Italian restaurant paired with some fettuccine alfredo and it was absolutely delicious."
"In the world of fine Italian cuisine, Moretti La Rossa Birra Doppio Malto is a step up from Olive Garden. But it ain't a large step. You can find better Italian beers, and you can certainly find many better doppelbocks. However, it's worth a try, and it definitely does go well with pizza..."
"D--Got better with every sip. It would be very easy to drink several of these if not for the 7.20% ABV."
"D - Well I did like it and as a 10 dollar six pack its decent but I would go with other offerings."
"D-even though I like dark beers, I don't think I'd be able to drink more then two of these in one night. Still, I do recommend trying it."
"Moderate head on pour, with broken lacing that has little cling. Color is a 19 on the SRM Beer color chart. Strong caramel, molasses, and oak are in the forefront of the aromas with hints of coffee and chocolate. Coffee is the primary flavor I detect with wisps of caramel, toffee, licorice and hops. Mildly full in my mouth with a nice bump in the back of the soft palate. A little heavy and harsh for everyday drinking, but would be nice with desert."
"Pours a decent brown color, albeit a bit light for a doppelbock, with a bit of head and just the lightest bit of lacing. Decent malty sweet aroma, but not overly deep and thick. Good malty flavor with decent caramel hints, not horribly thick and strong, but not bad at all. Goes down quite smoothly."
"Pours a beautiful reddish amber with a surprisingly thick head. Subdued aroma. Tastes silky smooth all the way, minimal carbonation, elegant malts with a slight hoppy finish. Although this isn't my favorite style, this is a real quality beer for an industrial scale brew."
"D - A very nice Italian Dopplebock. I think I could stock my frig with this one and would happily recommend it to my friends. Very tasty."
"On its own La Rossa is a shade too sweet, and while I love it's maltyness, the flavor isn't particularly refined. The color is gorgeous though, and overall I definitely recommend giving it a try."
"Overall: As far as I'm concerned, this beer gets no publicity or credit in a growing market for bock beers. Try, try, try!"
"Poured a rich dark hazel with a foamy off white head. It doesn't bring too much to the table when it comes to aromas. It's basically just malt and that's about it. It drinks much better than it smells. It has good, bready yeastyness and a mellow, maple like sweetness. It drinks light to medium bodied and is pretty smooth. The alcohol really isn't present and for a doppel bock, this one isn't too bad."
"D - This isn't a bad beer however its pretty average for the most part not a bad beer if your in the ticking mood"
"Sweet caramel, brown fruit, toffee, overbrowned toast, some hop bitterness, some mineral notes. Nice balance between the sweet, the bitter, and the rich. A little thinner than I'd like in the mouthfeel than I'd like, but the carbonation is spot on. A very easy-drinking doppelbock. Not overdone or over-complicated. A great surprise and at $1.85/single, a steal for something like this."
"Drinkability: Definitely ok, just not something I think I'll crave."
"D- A drinkable doppel. I liked this. Quite enjoyable. Simple yet tasty doppel."
"A decent example of the style from Birra Moretti. Could use slightly more alcohol but otherwise, it beats the other offering I've had from them."
"Final Notes: A solid beer. I thought it was rather delicious, and it far exceeded my expectations for an Italian beer. That said, it just doesn't compete with the best American and German Doppelbocks. Alas, I really enjoyed it."
"D - 7.2 ABV not felt in the taste its a very smooth very drinlable beer would with out at doubt have it again"
"D: Flavorful and easy to drink. ABV might sneak up; its masked well."
"D: Not bad"
"Overall not bad at all, very drinkable."
"This is somewhat sweet with caramel, nuts, roasted malt and a little spice thrown it. Quite a nice doppelbock. Alcohol is well hidden and not overly sweet."
"D - Despite the relatively poor rating I have given this, I actually enjoyed it. Maybe it was just all the delicious olives and bread that I was eating along with it..."
"Light-bodied, and light perception alcohol."
"D - I would gladly have another, although one was certainly enough with the 7.2% alcohol."
"Slick, oily mouthfeel. Light-medium body. Not bad, but a bit thin and light for a beer of this style. Overall a nice, full-flavored, easily drinkable beer, but nothing that particularly stands out."
"A big malt bomb of a beer."
"The aroma is pretty good, with crusty toast and caramel notes. The taste is vaguely disappointing though. While it has a nice sweet maltiness, there's a slight flavor of oxidation as well. It's also perhaps oversweet. Full-bodied, and creamy textured help make up a little."
"A pleasant surprise from Moretti. Good show."
"Poured a dark amber with light tan two finger head that quickly dissapated to thin lacing. Malty aromas with hints grains. Malty sweet on the palatte with a dry finish. Medium bodied with desent enough carbonation. Wasn't really what I had hoped for."
"D: Easy to drink, would buy again. it was a good beer!"
"D - Surprisingly drinkable, La Rossa is so well balanced it's scary. The heavy malting never overpowers anything as it remains lightly sweet and smooth. This was a surprising treat I didn't expect to deliver so well."
"Crystal clear, deep red with a tight beige cap of fine bubbles. Good head retention and some spotty lacing. Very malty aroma, clean and sweet with a hint of caramel. Bitterness had some presence, but stayed low relative to the sweet malt and caramel flavours. Light spicy hop flavour and bitterness lingered, along with a bit of toffee. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation made up of fine bubbles. Nice texture overall. Quite enjoyable. Easy drinking with a pleasant malty character."
"I poured into a pint glass to a couple inches of light tan head. It is brown in color with orange highlights. The aroma is full of sweet toffee and caramel. the taste starts out with the toffee/caramel but then I get roasted malt and a bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous. This beer is better than expected. I am actually enjoying this unlike a lot of the European turds I have been getting at my ""Beers Around the World"" hangout. I would drink this again."
"Overall, its a solid beer that I would definitely drink again and I would recomend trying this. If you are looking a decent Italian beer, its much better than Peroni."
"The body was pretty average for a brew of this type, light, but not helium light. Drinkability was decent, I'd grab a couple bottles to take to the park for lunch. Try this if you if you see it."
"Caramel domination, no hop presence, medium viscosity. A decent enough beer, doesn't offend, doesn't blow any socks off. Can't picture it with Italian food, might be decent w/ Mexican?"
"Beer is medium body, I think the moderate carbonation in the mouth helps to fill it out. The flavors are strongly malty but not overly sweet and some roast in the back. I could do without this much roast but stylistically it is fine overall."
"D - Relatively light doppelbrock with solid 7.2 ABV."
"taste is where this shines nicely. rich mouthfeel with plenty of crisp carbonation. quite balanced, thus letting the malts and hops to unify into a really tasty, sessionable brew. i catch slightly toasted caramel with a veneer of hop presence (being it seems right where it should be). sure, it's malty, but again, balance is evident almost everywhere. very refreshing and fulfilling. the best Moretti i've had yet. surprised. delightfully so."
"Aftertaste: Tobacco, Mexican chocolate and a little bit coffee note."
"D - pretty sweet. This sample is old though and hard to enjoy."
"Easily and infinitely better than the Birra Moretti lager, this beer has some nice flavors to offer. Sweet and roasty malts with a heavy dose of nuttiness...walnuts and almonds. Even a little bit of chocolate is in there. Not cloyingly sweet like some doppels tend to be and has a noticeable hop bite on the finish that is appreciated. Carbonation levels are decent but the beer is still thin compared to the best of the style. There is a mild astringency that comes in mid-palate and lingers a bit that is mildly distracting. Not like this will supplant Celebrator on anyone's favorites list, but this is a worthwhile beer and I am glad I purchased one."
"Taste follows smell with a roasted malt-lightly burnt caramel flavor and enough hops to give a good bitterness to the bite with a lingering softness. Chewy, robust and full of grain, this would go well with a meat-eaters pizza cooked in a wood burning oven."
"Overall great brew! It's a nice alternative to the standard Peroni and Moretti lagers you get at most Italian joints."
"Dr. Actually very good. Surprised me, didn't expect much from an Italian beer...might be my own ignorance..."
"Smooth and easy drinking. Not a bad beer at all. I was not aware it was a doppelbock until I can came to review it."
"D: A good beer. Gives a different twist on doppelbocks but still tastes like one."
"M,D- The feel is above medium bodied, the liquid is smooth, goes down like a champ, no alcohol gets in the way, Carb is low where it should be. This is a nice drinkable dopple that is worthy of a repeat visit."
"the palate comes on sweet, lush and full, like a classic german, then turns firm and dry. not the most complex version of the style, but full flavored and delicious anyway. love this type of beer and its affordable for a rich strong lager. satisfying."
"D - Decently drinkable, although the alcohol buzzed me on this on an empty stomach after one."
"MF&D - Medium body with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Slight alcoholic warmth, but went down nicely."
"appears a brownish amber beneath a somewhat frothy tan head. not much head retention but a decent amount of lacing. smells like caramel malts and brown sugar, a faint amount of hops and an earthy quality i can't quite discern. tastes pretty malty up front with some hops, a bit bready and grainy in the middle with a caramelesque residual sweetness on finish (with just a hint of alcohol). reminds me of an oktoberfest more than a dopplebock. has decent balance on the taste front but nothing that stands out as special. feels pretty smooth in the mouth, it's medium bodied, and carbonation is fairly light. goes down easy, but for a dopplebock its a little tame for me. i prefer a darker one with more roasted smells and flavors. this could just about be classified as a maerzen and i wouldn't be surprised. overall not a bad beer and certainly drinkable but not an outstanding dopplebock."
"Poured a dark, reddish brown with a modest head that rapidly faded to a collar. The aroma was not present for me. The taste was not overly sweet, molasses though not syrupy. There was also a little hoppy bitter that made things interesting. The feel was medium bodied with fairly good carbonation. Drinkability was real good, a reasonable 7.2 ABV. A good beer in a tough doppelbock category."
"Had this at Ippolito's in Sandy Springs. Aroma is strong and malty, not complex but still promising. It pours a nice dark brownish amber with a very thick, fine-bubbled, long-lasting light tan head. Flavor is typically malty, but mouth-filling with hints of hops and caramel. Texture is quite tingly and lively."
"I need to probably revisit this one, to get a proper tasting review."
"Pourd from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1 inch head. Smells sweet, lots of malts. Taste is a bit sour, alcohol with some malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth. Drinkability is about average. Overall this is a fairly decent brew."
"Overall: a decent beer. Not very exciting, but I will never refuse another one. Very drinkable"
"Overall it holds its own in the battle against the Germans but it could use a bit more flavor to properly bask amongst the German doppelbock giants."
"D: Very drinkable. Steady choice when I'm in Italy together with the Doppio Malto from Moretti."
"Usually not a big fan of the mass produced imports and doppelbocks are one of my least favorite styles... both I actually enjoyed this beer. Pours a cool stained wood type of color, decent head to it which dissipates fairly quickly. Perfume like type of aroma, also some alcohol can be detected. Taste wise it's very smooth and creamy. Pretty sweet and a nice body to this one, certainly quite malty and has a bit of an alcohol kick to it due to the 7.2% ABV but it all goes together well. One of the best doppelbocks I've tried, and go figure it's an Italian import. Solid brew."
"Would recommend if you're in the same situation."
"The bottle has been redesigned since the last pic entry."
"I guess this one just works well with my palate. Enjoy!"
"Glad I didn't get a whole sixer of this... I could probably drink this again but with other much better doppelbocks out there, why bother?"
"Poured from as 12 oz bottle into a tall glass. Two fingers of white foam above a clear amber beer. Nice hopped smell with a malt overtone. Tasted less malty than the smell. The mouthfeel is good and went well with the pizza we had at lunch. Above average drinkability."
"12oz bottle. Pours a clear red-brown with a fluffy light tan head. Smells of caramel malt and molasses. Fruity, with lots of raisin/prune notes. Quite sweet. Tastes similar, with brown sugar and sweet malt coming through strongly. A bit of a metallic character in the background, along with a bit of smokiness. Sweet finish. Medium, somewhat syrupy body. Not a great doppelbock, but certainly better than the usual Moretti offerings."
"D: Overall, a decent and unique dopple. I would prefer it had a smoother fade though. seems too dry and bitter."
"Notes: Expiration of November 2009. Label lists that it was brewed and bottled in Milan. This just shows me that Birra Moretti is able to brew a good beer, they just sell much more of the weak Euro Lager stuff I guess."
"Not a bad dobblebock at all, pleasantly surprised - and would have no problem picking up a full sixer instead of the one and done sample tried here."
"Ordered a bottle last night while having dinner at Carlo's Cucina in Allston. Poured into a an oversized juice glass. Dark reddish brown color. Strong pour needed to form a head. A little lacing on the glass. Sugary and spicy smell. Tons of malt with the first sip. A real malt bomb. Thick enough body, but not overly to make it hard to drink. Rather smooth actually. A nice offering from Moretti Heineken. A nice beer to accompany my fettucini with plum tomato sauce and veal. This beer stands up well to a hearty Italian dish."
"I'm pretty impressed with La Rossa. I wasn't expecting much out of it and it turned out to be a decent bock. It could be improved with a couple of easy tweaks. Tone down the dark fruit flavor and the alcohol just a bit. A little more body would probably help, but perhaps not materially. All in all, it's pretty good and better than expected. Perhaps my expectations dropped a little too much when I saw the word ""Heineken"" in the profile. Definitely worth checking out if you run across a bottle."
"d-Im a complete malt head. I wish i could get 12-packs of it."
"Conclusion: This was a fairly unexpected treat; a German-style beer from Italy, I mean, c'mon. I paired this with dried figs and dark bread and it was quite nice. Not a home run, but solid"
"D - I could have it again, and would, but I wouldn't have 2 in a row."
"D- good but may be a bit bitter for the type of beer but it is manageable, good beginning beer!"
"Good dark Italian beer that poured with a decent head; rich deep taste like a porter with a dominant roasted malt flavor, along with sweet caramel, coffee/toffee and faint hops. Smooth drinking with a medium body and light carbonation. Stands out from all other Italian beers that I've had since it has more flavor and all the others seem to be along the lines of a pilsner. It's a little light for a Doppelboack, but still a good beer."
"The drinkability is ok, I can drink a 12 oz of this no problem. Unless I was at an Italian place where this and regulat moretti were the options, I would probably not drink again."
"I drank it but it wasn't as enjoyable as the pour had made the beer out to be. If you like malt you like this beer. Very consistent taste for the name double malt."
"Drinkability- Despite this beer's ultra-filling nature, this is one I always go back to when I'm at the bar, and not in the mood for something new."
"I have to say that I was initially dubious of this beer as seeming too 'mainstream,' but perhaps this beer renaissance we are living in has encouraged too much snobbery in the average joe. Get a case of this for your next casual party and everyone will be satisfied. I really liked this doppio malto on a wet Spring day here in PA."
"Drinkability: A sweet-tasting, easy drinking, relatively cheap beer. So, it definitely has some things going for it."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and slightly dry. The body of the beer is medium body and the finish is slightly bitter. This is good doppelbock, the nose has an edge over the taste. If they would have been close I would have given it a better rating."
"Easy drinking beer but a little too sweet for me. The high alcohol content wears on me a bit. Finally there is a slight metallic taste that I don't like."
"Overall this is just an okay dopplebock. doesnt hold a candle to Celebrator. and actually probably my least favorite dopplebock to date."
"An interesting take on a dopplebock. Appearance is quite good. Nice and dark with a creamy head. Smell and taste are decent- a bit to coffee creamer type for me, Malt was nice and dry though. Mouthfeel is good, medium body and still carbonated. Drinkability is decent"
"halfway decent example of a doppelbock. creamy and tasty, but not to the point of excellence."
"Very drinkable."
" ~ I really like this beer. In fact, I'm surprised I've never had the chance to enjoy one before. This beer should be a regular in everyone's stock. Don't hesitate, go get one now."
"Drinkability would be better if it wasn't so sweet and thin. The alcohol hides well but one is enough."
"This beer was poured into a pint glass and it gave a great amount of head that reduced down to wisps of lacing. The amberish bronze colored beer gave off a cloves, coliander, citrus and of fresh oven bread. The taste followed suit but also gave had a toffee flavoring and a bit of pepper. Overall a great beer that went down smooth."
"Beer pours very nice! It leaves a nice little head in a regular beer glass. Definately a roasty and malty flavor, smooth mouthfeel, but barely any hop bitterness. Perfectly balanced beer, but just a tiny bit more hop bitterness would be nice, even for a doppelbock"
"Pours a deep, clear red with medium off-white head. Flavorful, slight bitter taste with smooth finish. Had three at a restaurant bar before dinner. Definitely better than an Amberbock. Ordered as it was the only import besides Heineken (blah!) among MBC beers. Cheers!"
"Overall: A well made beer but a little bit light for what i was expecting. I liked it but not really more than that. It left me feeling neutral (it's the only word that describes my feeling for it)."
"Gave this guy a fairly vigorous pour. Came out a beautifully clear dark amber with a big brown head, bubbles racing from the bottom of the glass to the top. Smells of caramels and butterscotch and sweet roasted malts with faint resinous hops. Taste is milder than I would prefer but good nonetheless: initially sweet maltiness (caramels and burnt sugar) before the hops come into play and linger on the finish. The taste of alcoholic and metal give this a somewhat chemically taste that keeps me from giving it 4+ on flavor, but its medium-full body is well-supported by moderate carbonation and overall this beer is highly drinkable, especially given its high abv."
"Drinkability: Nice easy drink. Would try again if I came across it."
"Overall Notes: Started off great, but strayed near the end. I would keep sipping this one continuously so that I don't get the funky aftertaste at the end stuck in my mouth. Nice to try, but I'm not sure if I'd get it again."
"For a 7.2% beer, La Rossa is very drinkable. When I reach for a doppelbock, it's usually this splendid little number."
"D: Good beer to sip on. It seems strong to me tonight, but i usually love the booziness."
"D- Great. It's a nice pair with a pizza. Instead of cutting through and overpowering the tomato and crust, it acted as a nice compliment to the flavors."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. The appearance is a pretty deep wood brown, attractive but nothing to write home about I guess. Does have much of a head to it. Smells like an average dark beer. The taste is surprisingly refreshing, bits of chocolate and coffee hiding under the hops. Moderate mouthfeel, not too bubbly and goes down easy. All in all a great beer to have with a pasta in a heavy meat sauce. My beer of choice when I eat Italian out."
"When poured, it was a dark brown with a reddish hue with very little tan foam. The smell of roasted malts, fruit and a hint of caramel had a pleasant aroma to this Doppelbock. After the first sip, a touch of roasted malts and caramel was a pleasant surprise. Then I could taste rasins and dates on my palate. This is a nice refreshing Doppelbock that I will purchase again and again!"
"Bottom line: A nice offering from this brewery for sure. I recommend it."
"Moretti La Rossa poured a dark amber, and I mean dark. Almost appeared brown. Smell was of sweet malt and hints of hops. Smell was a bit on the light side however. Taste was excellent Sweet malt, milk chocolate up front, followed by bittersweet dark Chocolate, finishing with a slight hop crispness. Mouthfeel was good, decent carbonation that helped add to the crisp finish. Drinability was good. Overall I enjoyed this beer a great deal. I can not believe that this is from Italy! This is not what I think of when I think Italian beer. Normally it is just pale lagers but this stuff is not you typical Italian beer. I will buy this beer again."
"D-Pretty good. Found a single of this and I might buy again. Quite filling, as is fitting for the style."
"I haven't had a beer with so much strawberry in it that is not specifically a fruit beer. Does not touch my beloved Optimator, but this is a pretty nice beer. And $7 a sixer is a very nice price. I'd certainly pick this up again. Solid across the board, and easy enough to drink. Better choices than this? Sure. Better choices at the nearest beer store open until midnight or later? Nope, not at this price."
"M:"
"The taste is sweet stewed dried fruit, a lot of raisins and prunes, with toasted bread, fresh grapes, hints of wine and licorice, and overall tasty yet balanced and smooth, with a light alcoholic spiciness and warmth, light bitterness to balance the sweetness, and a full, slightly oily feel. The alcohol is well-hidden for the type, aside from the warm body and light winey quality. It goes well with food, too, which is not true of many bocks or doppelbocks in my experience, and it is unusually drinkable for the type."
"D: Was pleasantly surprised with this one considering its primary brewer (Heineken)."
"An interesting beer to try. Pours a brown color, pretty good tan head but it fades halfway through the beer. Some spotty lacing. Malty, sugary sweet, spicy and sour. Some alcohol does show and it is a bit warming. I did enjoy this one. Nice dopplebock from Italy."
"mid body. low on the carbonation. alright beer. probably will not go out of my way to purchase."
"D- Pretty easy to drink, not quite sure if I'd call it a Dopplebock but I did enjoy this one."
"I must admit that I was expecting either a big let down or something completely unexpected with this beer. Poured a really deep red color with decent head and moderate lacing. The aroma of this one was very good with hints of sweet malts, and a touch of hops. Flavor was exceptional, a sweet doppelbock that tends to bring you full circle with flavors of caramel and other tasty malts. This beer reminded me alot of Heineken's Special Dark only much better. A very good beer all in all."
"Appearance is an amber brown with a thick frothy tan head. Aroma is malty with a hint of caramel. There is an slight but odd macro scent. Flavor is increidbly rich and malty. There are toasty hints and a decent amount of hop flavor. Slight metalllic taste. Very sweet and straightforward brew. Nothing crazy going on here. The feel is smooth and slick. After the first time i had one of these i was surprised to find out that it was a dopplebock! The alcohol is well hidden. It tastes more like the combination of a milk stout and a brown ale."
"Overall this is a clean doppelbock but is missing the intense melanoidins and rich maltiness of the great style examples. Looks great, tastes clean. More malt complexity would surely improve this. Glad I only bought one."
"Had high hopes for this one, but it was undrinkable. Filtered clear body. Small, quickly diminishing foam. Aroma had hardly any character. Maybe a touch of roast. Flavor has sweet fruit notes and some caramel-like malt character. No flaws. Probably not deserving of such a low score, but I didn't like any of its attributes and I didn't enjoy the beer at all."
"Some Italian beers help me realize why my great-grandfather Joe left Italy, however this one makes me wonder why."
"Poured a bright copper/bronze color with white head that stayed a while and left nice lacing on glass. Aroma is sweet roasted malt. Flavor is a combination of molasses, chocolate, and caramel. Flavor is balanced by hops which provide a bitter aftertaste. Alcohol is present in taste. Medium bodied and fairly easy drinking. Decent doppelbock for a country more known for wine."
"Very tasty and drinkable (especially at 7.2 percent). I'd have no problem devouring quite a few of these."
"Malts, dried fruit, and noble hops that help a balance in flavor and mouthfeel and provides a sort of smokiness and spice to match the roasted, caramelly malt. Not quite as sweet or leaning to the malt side as say tommyknocker dopplebock. This beer is a little heavier than most, you may only want one or two. Drinkable but not sessionable. If you can find it, try it. This is the best italian beer I've tried thus far... Peroni blue ribbon is blech (skunky euro pilsner) and moretti lager is so-so."
"This was a very nice beer. I had it served to me in a bottle at Rosebud on Rush in Chicago. This fine beer had a great caramel look to the pour, with a thin head. It had a great not bitter but piney after taste. Sweet and crisp. A very sophisticated beer, that went great with the veal saltimbocca."
"Overall impression: A highly drinkable well balanced bock. Alcohol is well hidden and this is quite enjoyable. Strongly recommended."
"This beer has only 7.2% Vol., but the alcohol is very pronounced and overlaying anything else that might have been there as well."
"Solid beer across the board. Seems like a hybrid between a doppelbock and a maibock almost. Who cares that it's brewed by Heineken (I think some reviewers do, unfortunately), it's a good brew."
"Made for a great beer to go along with a roast beef sandwich or piece of homemade pastry or vegetable soup. I never drank more than one since I was drinking on break from classes, after all... but at $3 a bottle I could have drank em all day if it was closer to home!"
"12 oz bottle in a pint glass. Darke bronze, tea-like. small head, off white color. Strong smell of malt masking a sweet smell. Malty taste with alcohol sweetness. A little bit of chocolate also. Not too heavy on the mouth. Nice alcohol warming, not too much. Good beer, and works well with a lot of food I eat."
"D - Goes down easily, could have a few in an evening, but wouldn't have any more than that, especially when there are so many better options."
"Pours a reddish/amber color with a small half inch head. Aroma was malty with a grainy cereal aroma mixed in. Taste was mostly sweet malts and a little bit of caramel candy. The finish had a very slight hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was light/medium bodied in the palate making this beer quite drinkable and quaffable. No sign of the 7.2 ABV printed on the label. This is a pretty decent example of a double bock, but not near as bold and assertive as say, Salvator or Sam Adams double bock. Good to see this back on the shelves though after not seeing it for 5 or 6 years."
"D: Perfect with pasta. Stereotypical statement? Yes, but it's a true one."
"D - Drinkability is good. All the characteristics for this brew come together to make a good overall beverage. I would have no problem having several of these."
"This beer pours a dark amber/brown color. The head is huge, fluffy and recedes slowly into thick, chunky lacing. The aroma is of caramel a toffee, with a hint of butter. The taste has more toffee than the aroma with a nice caramel finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, which is a little thinner than I would like in a doppelbock. Carbonation is lively. Overall, this is a nice beer, but there are a lot better doppelbocks out there."
"I poured this brew into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a coca colo color with a decent off white head. The smell was caramally. The beer had a sweet taste that was pretty nice and it tasted caramally. The maltiness was nice and I would buy this again."
"Very drinkable. Alcohol well hidden. A tasty beer."
"Drinkablity: Easily consumable brew. Plenty of flavor and a decent kick."
"All in all, it wasn't a bad beer, especially coming from a country that isn't known for beer. It was a decent doppelbock, although it would be considered mediocre at best against better competition. Worth a try, for sure, and should be commended."
"Pours a very nice amber color with medium head. Pleasant malt aroma. Flavor is fairly well balanced, a bit more on the malty side (which I prefer). Nothing to jump up and down about, but a pretty solid and drinkable beer. Worth a try."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Poured a deep brown amber with a sizable off white head that stuck around for a while but finally melded into a nice film on the top of the beer; no lacing. At the first whiff, I couldn't quite place the aroma but after about a minute of smelling I finally got it. Special K. It smelled like a big bowl of corn flakes, plain with no sugar or milk. It tastes primarily of lightly roasted malts. I really enjoy the toasty flavor but there is a fake smoke taste also. It tastes kind of like Beggin Strips smell. Mouthfeel is interesting. Different than about another beer I've had but I cant really describe it. I don't know if Ill pick this up again. There are some good qualities to this beer, but a couple really bad ones to. Its a balancing act that I don't know that they got right."
"This beer was very thin for my taste. The thinness allowed a lot of the grain no show through, which took away from the overall balance of the beer. For a Doppelbock I was expecting something a little more. I would turn it down if given to me, but I won't be buying a six pack anytime soon."
"The ""great beer-hunter"" Michael Jackson, claimed that there was no better beer to pair with piszza than Birra Moretti's La Rosa, and as I sit here eating a slice, I must agree... the complexity of the flavors are great... sweet, yet bitter with a pleasing finish and after taste... appearance is very nice - dark brown almost bordering purple with a creamy frothy head to top it off... smell is rich, dark, and likewise complex... taste is also rich, creamy, with hints of toffee, vanilla, caramel, and sweetness combined with a subtle bitterness... I really enjoyed drinking this brew and the combination of spicy, cheesy pizza fits well with the bitter-sweet aftertaste of this beer... a good drink to pair with food and definitely recommended..."
"12 oz brown bottle. Pours a dark reddish brown with a nice two finger head. Smell is of alcohol with caramel amd a slight hint of dark malt. Taste is sweet and malty with caramel and coffee notes. Mouthfeel is a little watery for a dopplebock. Not bad, but at eight bucks a six, I'll pass."
"Bright and medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Slightly creamy in texture with a semidry finish. Rather different and fairly enjoyable, I suppose its worth a try."
"Overall I was very impressed with this beer. I'd passed on it many times at the large liquor store where I shop, thinking for some reason it might not be that good. Well I was wrong, it turns out to be a real winner and something I'll be revisiting again."
"Pours out a dark caramel/maple syrup body with a nice deal of bubbles reaching the top. No lacing to speak of and a thinnish ring of head atop the beer. Smells of dark malt, caramel, dried fruit, and earthy hops. Has a vegetal not to it. Flavor is full of caramel and fig preserves with little hop in the background. Very sweet, but the flavor profile seems as if it were watered down with seltzer. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight and a little sticky. Carbonation is kind of tingly. Drinkability is solid. Solid beer."
"D-Highly drinkable....by itself...or even better,with a slice of Gallinas pizza(Springfield,IL)!!!!"
"Enjoyed a La Rossa at a nice Italian restaurant in St. Charles, IL. Poured a rich, reddish-brown into a short glass. Good head that lingered. Rich malt aroma with just a hint of hops. Full malt flavor with a nice finish. Really complemented the spicy meal. Mouthfeel may have been hampered by the richness of the meal, but was still above average. Overall, a very drinkable beer that was perfect for the cold evening. Would definitely enjoy it again."
"Drinkability : une bonne biÃ¨re Italienne Ã  servir avec la pizza !"
"D: Its easy to drink, however, the strong sweet flavor is likely to limit my consumption to after dinner and to one per session. There are better doppelbocks on the market."
"D- Nice amber/dopple hybrid that is easy-drinking, the 7%abv is well-masked and this would go well with various Italian foods, this has a little more charisma than the other international lagers I have sampled tonight, but I wouldn't go out of my way to pick it up again (but this may be better than other offerings in your local restaurant)"
"Definitely a decent example of a dopplebock and a surprise that it's from Moretti. It's not extremely complex, but it's consistently a very good dependable beer. This was one of my early favorite beers and it actually withstands the test of time pretty well. Recommended."
"This beer is a deep reddish color with an off-white head. The head is initially quite tall, but falls to a thin film. The aroma is enticing...rich malt and a little toasted grain smell. Almost no hops, but the grain and malt are solid and inviting. The flavor is equally good. Sweet and malty, with a little toasted barley. It's clean, with no fruit esters at all. The beer gets a little bitter right before the finish. There's also a surprising alcohol warming that crops up after a few sips. This is a solidly good beer. Full in body and satisfying. I can easily see this being my go-to beer in Italy."
"D - I won't drink this again, but it's not awful."
"d: i'd had one before & wasn't overly impressed. but 2nd time around was much better - a smooth doppelbock interpretation. certainly a good surprise considering their same makers of birra moretti."
"D: An OK beer, but I was found wanting more. This is no Salvator, but a good, solid beer nonetheless, one of my first Italian beers, pretty interesting."
"Not a bad option with an Italian meal -- though if it were a little drier, it might balance out spices a little more -- and relatively inexpensive to boot. I wish La Rossa was on more Italian restaurant menus. A very pleasant surpise, to tell the truth. Didn't even realize it was a doppelbock until I got here."
"Got a bottle at the local Italian restaurant. It pairs nicely with a good red sauce. I'd call this a simple doppelbock. It comes off just like a strong, dark lager, with a rich caramel and licorice malt flavor. While the flavor is anything but subtle, it's a little bland and lacks complexity. Still not a bad option when it comes to Italian beer available in the burbs."
"Overall - I'd order again. For being 7.2% the alcohol was not noticable. The flavors of the malts, honey, and a little what seemed like choclate malts were evident and blended well."
"Overall, it is drinkable but it helps to not think of it as a doppelbock. Doesn't fit the style. More of an amber lager. Could drink several of these, but the sweetness is a little too much for me."
"Expect more out of your doppelbock. Not bad tasting, however."
"I really enjoy this beer. My favorite thing to drink with a pizza."
"D - Excellent. For a 7% malt bomb, I could down a few of these."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle a rich amber with medium white head and nice lacing. Nose is malts and fruit. Good mouthfeel and nice flavors of caramel and light hops. Very nice to drink. Best Italian Beer I have seen. I will have to look for this again."
"D- Would get again when not out at an Italian restaurant, but defiantly would get again if they had this at other restaurants."
"It has the feel of a doppelbock but is more drinkable, lighter in mouthfeel but still has that substantial flavor and the abv kick. Kind of like a summer doppelbock, if that makes any sense. This was cheaper than Optimator at my local Trader Joes, I think this is my new every-day doppel. Very drinkable."
"This beer aint bad,once I saw Heineken near the same of the beer I thought I got sucked into some euro BMC.I would try it again and I was quite supprised."
"Medium body and very easy to drink, an italian surprise."
"All six entries flexed their muscles, but the one from Italy takes the top prize. Read my previous reviews to catch what you missed from the Euro Invitation. Good night everyone!"
"Might try this one again. Might not."
"My brother recommended Birra Moretti and I thought I'd try it. The ""make your own 6 pack"" shelves at my local store were fresh out of it, so I opted to try the Moretti Doppelbock instead. As beers go, it was good; as a Dopplebock, it likely fell short a few notches. The color was a dark ""Dr. Pepper"" red brown in the glass, with a surprising amount of carbonation. Thin mouthfeel and a faint, dark malt and alcohol smell as you raise the glass. A good Dopplebock will not usually hit you in the nose with alcohol so quickly. This one did. And the moderately thin mouthfeel didn't do much to make it better. I was expecting a much more balanced taste, but the alcohol seemed to almost overpower the flavor. I liked it for what it tried to be, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations."
"If you're into dopple bocks/dunkels, give it a shot. Worth a try, but I won't be running out to purchase a six-pack of it anytime soon."
"The beer pours a very pretty ruby-red to medium-brown color, and the cream-colored head disappears quickly. The aroma is all about the caramel malts, and it is what really drew my attention to it when I first had it at the old Como Inn in Chicago. The flavor changes quite dramatically with temperature. At food-fridge temps, the sweet malts dominate, to the point of giving a sticky-sweet cola-ish impression. If yours is served that cold, give it 10 minutes to warm up. Once it gets a little warmer, the hop bitterness has a fighting chance against all those malts, aided by the alcohol warmth and dryness that starts to gets some traction. This beer never escapes all that sweetness, but it is more balanced at warmer temps. It comes into its own when paired with minestrone soup, dishes with marinara sauce, and other tomato-based courses. If you are happy with a sweeter beer, this is very drinkable; only the sweetness (and eventually the physiological effects of the higher ABV) will slow you down."
"I reviewed this beer a few weeks ago when it came in a compilation box that I purchased, but I recently found it in a six pack and realized that the taste was very different. No doubt that the box that I bought was old, so this review will reflect the much fresher version. Pours a glossy brown color with little to no head. The smell is big, with mostly dark malts dominating the nose. The taste is interesting, but overall really big: the dark malts are apparent but also a taste of candied sugars which give it a sticky taste. Also there is a hit of chocolate and/or coffee in the end of it, with a hint of alcohol. Really a terrific beer that is well crafted, seek it out if you can."
"Originally reviewed on March 3, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Pours amber brown clear, with a light creamy head of tan. Dusty wheat aroma. Hint of caramel. Flavor is bland, incredibly watery sugar and chalkboard malt flavor. A hint of toast finishes this heer, with a few notes of corn nuts. Palate is very watery, but not refreshing, instead sickly, and a touch sticky. This is horrible for a Bock."
"Drinkability is kind of iffy. The Alcohol is a bit much but the sweetness and roasted carmel aftertaste could make this a multiple drinker."
"D: Very drinkable. Was almost like drinking a soda. It went well with salad and calzone."
"This is one that I'd drink cold if I were you. Perhaps I just picked up a bad batch, but the levels of butterscotch here are almost unbearable. Perhaps the Italians (myself being one) should stick to making wine."
"Drinkability: This is a quaffable malty brew and it's definitely the best Italian beer I have ever had, but I still need to try Le Baladin. La Rossa is also cheaper than the good German dopplebocks. ItÂ’s a good one to pick up if you see it at TJÂ’s."
"The drinkability is good, Not a real bold or big beer but quite respectable. Prosit, MK"
"Overall: I like this one a lot. Try it next time you're having a pizza, the combination is excellent."
"This beer pairs well with spicy tomato based dishes. Considering how sweet this brew can be better save this selection for a night cap!"
"This was a unique beer. I have yet to experience this but I've heard this is one of the best beers to drink with a pizza. I bought one with that activity in mind but I just broke down the other night in a vain attempt to convince my friends to order out and drank the quaff by itself. When I poured it into my special Duvel chalice I immediately noticed an actual tomato juice smell which was very intriguing to me. It had an almost vintage ale/ sherry taste to it. Usually I don't like those styles of beer but this was wasn't as strong so I was able to toloerate it. The color was a nice reddish copper that looked very pleasing in the light. Over all it wasn't a bad brew."
"D - I thought it was pretty good, a nice doppelbock."
"This beer poured a reddish brown with a nice tan head. Nose is malty and doughy. Taste is malty, somewhat doughy, and finishes with a dark fruit hop. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and well carbonated. Drinkability is good. I have had this in Italian restaurants before and liked it. Glad I came back to do an official review as this is definitely enjoyable!"
"D- With the exeption of eisbocks, every variant of bock I have had is incredibly easy going down, this one is right up there with them"
"Quick forming head, just as quick to disassemble itself - before a first sip I was left with nothing but a thin, outside trim of the glass. Ruby in the light, otherwise chestnut brown. Great malty aroma. Carbonation a little high but no hint as to the 7% Quite well hidden behind the malt. Flavour is too quick to disapear as well. A decent dopplebock but a little heavy on the amber malt and showcases little else. Too one dimensional. Also, a lack of texture (and the failure in the flavour department) makes this all too macro-ish. No doubt, this is just as close to a ""red"" as it is dopplebock. No character, simply 'lager'. A fairly decent brew still, but certainly held back by characteristicly macro qualities."
"Drinkablity: An exellent beer ,i would love to try it with pizza."
"Pours a dark ruby-red color with a creamy off-white head. Aroma is sweet malts, caramel and some dark fruits. Taste is very sweet, rich and creamy. The alcohol is somewhat present in this beer detracting from the drinkability a bit. Overall, I am impressed with this brew. Who knew such a good beer like this could come from Italy?"
"Drinkability: A bit different from the typical doppelbock -- not as sweet and the bitterness on the finish is surprising; nonetheless, this is an enjoyable beer that carves its own niche and is worth seeking out"
"Pours a brown-amber with a moderate creamy head. Medium and creamy mouthfeel. Bitterness and a generous malting including chocolate malt, mollasses, caramel, dark fruit and I do get nutiness and a drop of roast. Appropriate carbonation.A nice drinking, thanks Biegaman."
"Overall, i think this is a nice doppelbock, and quite drinkable despite the 7.2% alc. Not the best, but i think pretty solid."
"D: Better than expected. This is no Celebrator, but this beer greatly exceeded the low expectations that I unfairly assigned it. Unlike Celebrator, the light character of this one could easily make it a session beer."
"Poured from a bottle to an amber-brown, with thin tan head and okay lacing,. Aroma was sweet malty chocolate with some caramel. As glass warmed, hints of alcohol entered the smell. Flavor was more of the malty wweetness, and finish was smooth, although not all that long, and again, alcohol was more pronounced at beerÂ’s end."
"good stuff"
"Ordered from Carrabbas, not expecting muchÂ… boy was I surprised! Pours a dark cranberry brown color with a stead cascade of tiny bubbles fueling a one-finger tan head that fades slowly leaving decent lacing and a solid ring of foam. Nose is very sweet and malty with a hint of raspberry. Taste is extremely malty, like a malty, sweet caramel candy. The malt is sweet but not overpoweringly so, and soon fades to moderate hops. Mouth is creamy and smooth, with tiny, unobtrusive bubbles. Drinkability is very good: itÂ’s smooth, good tasting, and goes down easily.Overall: I recognized this beer almost immediately as a dopplebock. Though not the best representation of the style, itÂ’s definitely a solid, good-tasting beer. Recommended."
"D: A very enjoyable beer, all the right flavors. Doesn't matter from which country it originates, I'd gladly get this doppelbock again."
"alcohol comes through in the flavor as well, but with a solid malty flavor of caramel. slightly smoky with a dark fruit sweetness. feel is thick and slightly medicinal; finish is sweet and alcoholic. alcohol is slightly too prominent, but it's a nicely strong and complex doppelbock."
"I wasnÂ’t expecting this solid of a beer. Perhaps the ideas of Â“ItalyÂ” and Â“DopplebockÂ” seldom are paired in the human mind, but this oneÂ’s a fine example of the style."
"Notes: The best ""italian brewed"" beer that I've had to date. I would definitely order this brew and will look for it more often when scrambling to find something decent to drink at most italian restaraunts. Reccomended."
"This is an excellent dopplebock --a really nice surprise from Italy. A definite re-buy."
"I've had several Italian beers, and this one is by far the best."
" Well, at least it was less embarrassing than the last time I had an Italian beer. Also, a lot less memorable."
"Drinkability: I sure hope I didn't get a bad bottle, because this beer to me really doesn't taste like a Dopplebock. It's a good thing I didn't buy a six-pack of this. It was a good beer, but I really don't like to have hoppy Dopplebocks."
"Drinkabiltiy: This beer is hugely quaffable. I was almost finished with the three before I had realized how much I had drunk. Just a yummy beer treat."
"Cheers!"
"This beer came in a twelve ounce brown bottle. It poured an amber color, not quite red, with a thick head. Not surprisngly it smells like malt. Sure enough, it tastes like malt through and through, with just a bit of hops to give it some balance. This is a tasty beer, not what I expected from Italy. Definitely worth a try."
"A nice little beer that goes down pretty good for it's strength. I do remember this being a little tastier a few years back, but still not bad"
"Poured out a dark amber with a 2 finger head.Smells of a light sweet malt,light hops,,smell isnt very strong. Taste is pretty strong though.Taste of sweet malt,,slight hoppage towards the end of the sip.Alcohol is slightly apparent but tamed.Mouthfeel is pretty good ,,a pretty good brew and i was surprised by it."
" seems like this would be a good companion to an italtian lunch. All the italian deli's around here have Birra Moretti. Interesting take on the ol' dopplebock."
"($1.49 / 12 oz.)"
"I thought the mouth was a bit thin for this style, but it is a very easy drinker. One was not enough, but two was plenty. I would buy this one again."
"A perfect beer for a windy, cool evening. This strong lager poured a deep red color with a sustaining white head that left some nice lacework down the sides of my glass. The rustic aroma is very pleasing with some raisin-like accents. This is definitely a malt-accented beer (hopheads run away!) with tawny caramel malt flavors that linger on the tongue. The silkiness of this beer is reminiscent of a fine liqeur, with just enough dryness to prevent a cloying character. This beer may be categorized as a dopplebock, but I think of it as more unique than that, sort of a Northern Italian strong red lager, as it doesn't seem as dark as other dopplebocks that I've sampled. Perhaps I'm being too technical. This beer is an old favorite of mine and I was happy to see it in the cooler at my local Italian deli. I'm looking forward to enjoying some of these brews with some smoked chicken ravioli I have planned for dinner later in the week!"
"I don't want to overrate this, since I don't have any doppelbocks to compare it to. That said, it is delicious. I can't believe this has a 7.2%abv ... so easy to drink. A big beer that is super malty instead of super hoppy ... what an idea."
"Pours a brilliant mahagony color with a finger of head that falls to a light coating. The nose is nicely roasted, with nutty tones. Very nice. Flavor is the same. Nutty, slightly sweet caramel. Very tasty brew. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, a nice brew. Tasty but not too big in the flavor. I like it. Dopplebocks often have too much flavor for me, but this one works well for me. Enjoyable."
"Moderate malt presents in the aroma. Big hit right off the bat. Toast, caramel, raisin, and cherry are there, but had to search. Brown with some red highlights. Fair head. Flavor was lacking also. It was there, but restrained. Very lively, medium bodied. Alcohol was not hard to find. Over all a good beer, but not a good example of the dopplebock."
"I had this at a fancy Italian restaurant. It pours a brilliant red with a modest off white head. The Aroma is very malty and sweet, with some peppery alcohol evident. The taste starts off big and malty, with bread and toffee notes. Alchohol quickly becomes evident, as does a cloying sweetness. The finish is thin sweet and highly alcoholic. The mouthfeel is thin and moderately carbonated. This is not a very good beer. It needs more malt depth and less abrasive alcohol."
"Yummy. You know when a guy uses the word 'yummy' that he is humbled. This beer looks great: chocolatey dark with some mohogany colors, light carbonation, and tan head. Just off from clear, this beer looks nice. Smells more fruity than expected in a Dopple. A bit estery: cherries, ripe oranges, figs, dates, plumbs. Mildly spicy and peppery. Tastes quite malty, caramelly, chocolatey, and the same fruits that are present in the aromas. Full rich body. Carbonation and alcohol keeps the beer from cloying or thickening. Alcohol is smooth and sweet. Carboation plays on the palate without numbing. Finishes slick and smooth."
"Pours a clear mahogany. Attractive two finger head retains well and leaves some seriously impressive rings of lacing in the glass. Bittersweet malt aroma. Excellent rich caramel malt flavor with dark fruit and just a bit of smoke character. Hops come in with mild bitterness, just enough to balance and complement the thick maltiness. Delicious. Lasting finish of malt and fruit, with mild alcoholic warmth. This was a great find and an extremely pleasant surprise. I'll definitely be going back for it when I can."
"Opinion: I think that this is a tasty beer. I personally am spoiled by DoppelBocks, so I think that this one is a little on the light side. It blurs the boundaries between a Doppel and a Mai Bock. It seems to me like a fortified Oktoberfest as it does an Oktoberfest. Don't get me wrong...this is an excellent beer, and absolutely worth a try!"
"wow, i wasn't expecting this. i was thinking i would get some sort of mild red lager. this one packs a punch at 7.2% abv. I was in rome last summer and tried a beer called ""ceres strong ale"" it tastes so much like it, it brings back alot of memories. this beer has alot of malt taste and alot of metallic taste. i don't usually like it when my beer tastes like steel. nor do i in this case."
"Pours a brilliantly clear, ruby red color when held up to the light. It is topped by a tan head that is quite thick as well as being frothy and creamy. The aroma smells of lightly spicy hops, caramelized malt and a hint of toasted grain. The taste is lightly sweet up front, but then moves to a toasty, caramel malt note. The finish is dry with a lingering toasted maltiness that is lightly astringent. Overall this beer is a celebration of malty notes. This is a fairly full flavored beer, and at one time was by far the most flavorful Italian beer, with a new wave of craft Italian breweries though this seems like a not quite flavorful enough bock."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This is a really enjoyable beer. The beer started off very well balanced without over powering me with any flavor: whether it be hoppiness or too bitter. I noticed a fairly strong alcoholic taste and dry mouthfeel at the finish of it, but, again, nothing that detracted from my enjoyment. This beer was big surprise for me, and I can say that I'd be willing to have it again if and when I come in contact with it."
"It's a bit boozy on the palate - the alcohol is a bit too readily apparent for my liking. Overall though, it's a decent, enjoyable brew. Well worth trying."
"Medium doppelbock bodied, a little too heavy on the solvent like alcohol so I was not a huge fan."
"I've read about this beer before (Michael Jackson calls it the perfect beer for pizza), and have had it on many occasions, and really do enjoy it. One of the few Italian beers that I like (not that I've had that many)."
"Finger licking good."
"""Doppio Malta", on the label, with new graphics, by the way. Pours clear, reddish, dark honey, with an off white head, leaving minimal lacing, Medium amout of bubble rising to the top. slight nose of the expected malt. Malty brew, subtle notes of honey, caramel and a spicy hint of hot sauce. Long lingering finish, slightly warming, hides its 7% nicely. Worthy brew, best I've had from Italy. (not saying much) Worth a try. Would probably go nicely with some spicy peppery Italian foods."
"Lots of candy sugar malt flavor. Full bodied with low carbonation. Nice warming alcohol in the swallow. Bittering hop is extremely mild and shows up in the swallow."
"A better than average doppelbock. Not on the level of Celebrator, but pretty good."
"This pours a dark reddish brown with a thin beige head that fades pretty quickly, although there is good lacing as it is drank. Aroma is mainly caramel with a little hint of breadiness. Taste is very sweet with little caramel, nuttiness, and even some hops coming through on the finish. Mouthfeel is thin and beer is very fizzy. Overall this is an OK beer, but definitely the best I've had at an Italian restaurant."
"Altogether a very respectable beer in the doppelbock style."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red with a towering offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet and buttery caramel scent with a slightly dry roasted aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth and creamy caramel malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with a lingering sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good doppelbock. It is really malty and easy drinking. It also hides the elevated abv. quite nicely. This is a fine offering from Moretti."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a medium ruby red color with one finger of head. There is some lacing left on the glass. The smell has lots of chocolate and roasted malt. A nice sweet aroma, very pleasant. The taste is nice and sweet too. Lots of roasted malt character with some bittersweet chocolate, and a hint of raisin. The mouthfeel is fairly nice and strong, and the drinkability is good for a doppelbock. I was really surprised by this one."
"Pours a clear dark ruby color and has a ton of carbonation and a rocky white head that leaves quickly. The aroma is very sweet and malty, like a good doppelbock should be, and I can catch a definite whiff of alcohol. The flavor is quite complex, brown sugar, toffee, caramel and alcohol :) It is however quite hoppy in the finish... A lot more hoppy than any doppelbock I have had before. It has a very full body and is superbly balanced. Not bad for a beer from Italy. This is one tasty beer and it deserves a spot in any beer lover's refrigerator."
"Pours a nice deep ruby color with a fluffy beige head. Good toasty malt profile with some cherry-like fruitiness and a whiff of yeasty, peppery alcohol. Pretty thick and slick on the tongue. Good roasty character; but what I liked was the smooth transition to a lightly bitter finish. I really wasn't expecting much hops in this beer but I was pleasantly surprised. Light, smoothly carbonated, showing off its heftier body well."
"Avoided this for some time because I assumed (I know) it was another Italian lager. Pays to read the labels, huh? Pours a gorgeous reddish brown with a small head that dropped to a lasting film and left spotty lace. Smell is sweet, malty, nutty, grass, a little earthy. Taste is just a continuation of the smell with all of the same plus light hops and a light alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is smooth, chewy, a light effervescence and slight warming in the back of the mouth and throat. Drinkability: ""thank you sir, may I have another?. "" A damned fine brew, world class."
"Poured a clear, dark reddish color with a good-sized foamy head that left a good bit of lace. Aroma was malty and inviting. Taste was very rich malt flavors. Sweet with notes of carmel, dark fruits, nuts, and some spicy hop flavor at the back of the tongue. A little alcohol warming in the throat, but the alcohol is mostly well-hidden by the malt. Body was maybe a little thin for the style, but not bad. A very enjoyable beer. My new favorite Italian beer!"
"Pours a wonderfully dark reddish brown with a little light head that quickly dissipated. Smells of fruity sweetness along with a heavy malt, some alcoholness at the end of the nose. Its taste matches exactly! So, you get a heavy maltiness paired with a sweetness (raisinish) and then an alcohol kick at the end. It felt like the the alcohol peaked out unintentionally. Good mouthfeel, but that alcohol aftertaste lost it points. Overall, I'd drink it again, but it isn't my first or second choice for this general style."
"Moretti Birra La Rossa won't make anyone forget the truly world-class doppelbocks, but it's good beer all the same. I'm definitely gaining an appreciation for this style and am glad that I made this beer's acquaintance."
"I could drink it, not sure if I'd ever buy it again as it just wasn't my cup of tea."
"It might be strange recommending a mass-produced Italian doppelbock, but this one is definitely worth a shot if you see it in your area. A great beer for a chilly autumn night if you ask me."
"pours a semi cloudy mahogany thats ends up hard to see thru. The head goes way to quick and hides on the side of the glass, cant tell but it doesnt look like alot of carbonation, the smell is of a dark alcoholic chocolate and malts. has that familiar doppelbock air,....so lets swith from nose to mouth, initial is light caramel chocolate that melts into dark chocolate and then to the malts which is what maintains the aftertaste. mouthfeel is quite full, rolls itself over the tongue and around the cheeks with ease. I can see myself suffering throught one or two of these."
"A mahogany color, transparent, with fine co2 rising from the bottom. The head is tawny colored, full and soapy with low retention and a sticky lace. Smells of malt and caramel with light hop notes. Tastes sweet and malty with fruity notes and a light but lingering hop bitterness. Palate is light bodied and effervescent with a light dry finish. Not a remarkable beer - not a lot of character. Somewhere in the middle."
"Packaged in a 12 o.z. amber bottle with a nice classical label proclaiming this to be 18 degrees Plato.Poured a dark brownish red with an offwhite head that subsided quickly. Aroma is of sweet malt and lots of alcohol with an ironlike metallic tinge to it. The flavor begins with that Iron taste at the front which segues into lots of sweet dark malt and a bit of chocolatey roastyness as well. There is only the barest taste of hop flavor mixed in bu the malt is very quick to dominate. Clean finish with no esters the 7% alcohol leaves the belly with a nice warming sensation. Mouthfeel is a little strange in this beer as it has a pretty soft carbonation level which makes the sweet malt a little bit cloying. I would probably not choose to buy this birra again but it would not deter me from trying other Moretti lagers."
"I was extremely impressed with this one! It poured very red, hence La Rossa. Slightly off-white head that subsided to a thin haze in about 30 seconds or so. Very nice lacing. The smell was very, very malty and sweet. Quite tempting just by the appearance and the way it smelled. Tons of malt in the taste. A little bit of a roasted taste. Very slightly hoppy for just a moment. The mouthfeel was really smooth. Very drinkable. Fantastic!"
"Update 4/19/2006: I recently bought a six-pack of this beer at Cost Plus World Market, and while I would still rate it a winner, I don't think it's as good as I did when I first encountered it. Maybe I was just extra thirsty then!"
"I always have a hard time reviewing Dopplebocks because I always think about Celebrator. Is that supposedly the perfect dopplebock? Either way, this is a pretty solid brew. Maybe not as dark as I would have expected as it was a deep amber color. Pretty small head, but the aroma was nice and malty. Taste is very smooth and sometimes you forget that you are drinking a 7.2%'er. Definately a nice dopplebock to introduce new BAs to!"
"Poured out a clear and dark burnt sienna color with a perfect looking head of creamy cornsilk colored foam. The aroma is appealing, rich and luxurious with creamy sweet malt that is followed by an array of sweet musty fruits and roasted pecans. Some alcohol spiciness squeaks through. The taste is full with pleasantly rich malt sweetness. This starts out sweet and nutty, then finishes like a dry red wine. Solid and flavorful body of spicy sweet malt at itÂ’s core. Surprisingly, this beer kicks some ass! A high quality bock beer that incorporates some Alt bier characteristics.. Very nice."
"Warm caramel aroma. Malt and subtle fruitiness in flavor. Perhaps a little mild in flavor for a doppelbock but has a well-roundedness to it. I expect more Vienna or Munich malt character than this in a doppelbock. This is my favorite Italian beer anyway."
"Searched for this brew, found, much enjoyed. It poured a nice dark ruby red. The head was off-white, creamy foam. Lace was thin but made it. The aroma was more complex than most with notes of dark malts and caramel. The taste carries that carameled malt along with hints of buttered toffee, smoke and a well balanced mix of hop and alcohol. The beers finish lingers with that alcohol on the mouth that ends up dry. The dry feel is aided by a buttery smoothness that helps this beer go with italian foods. Pasta, pizza, hot peppered sauce, all maintain the flavor, boldness and zest when served together."
"Medium bodied, it wore on me quickly, I couldn't finish a second bottle."
"Very nice drinkable and warming campfire beer..wish I had more."
"Pours a gorgeous mahogany/cherry wood amber with a tan head that stays rather well during the session. Lacing is slight. The smell is strong of apple sweetness and a nice refreshing wilderness bitterness. A nice nature breeze sort of smell. The tase is a pleasant blend of the apple/cherry sweetness with the hop bitterness. The fruit syrup/caramel is a tad overpowering but thank god that the blend of hops is detected. A pleasant dopple finaly. Very good."
"back from a recent trip to Italy, where it seems when I wasn't drinking wine, I was drinking belgians or questing for the elusive baladin, alas never to be found. All was not lost as I stumbled upon this beer in the local COOP. My response is that this is a pretty damm fine doppelbock. so much for italians brewing watery lagers. the color of this beer is one of the nicest I've seen- very beautifual mahogany-red with a beautiful creamy tan head. Nose of malts and caramel. I thought the taste was quite nice, a bit of sweetness but controlled and with a definite malt balance. Wonderful mouthfeel too. A thorughly enjoyable, drinkable stand alone beer that served as a nice counterbalance to all the wine consumed. Should also note that it paired very well with proscuitto, pecorino, and numerous pizzas."
"Found this for $3 a bottle, good price for a high alcohol brew. Maybe just a little sweet."
"Finishes pretty strong, so I had two with dinner. Wouldn't buy it in a store, but in a restaurant, yes, anytime."
"High ABV"
"My first forray into Birra Italiano. Looks good, Nut brown color, big off-white head. Doesn't smell like much, maybe a little euro-grass maltiness. I can sense a euro lager hiding just under the surface of this beer. I taste the grassy malts, only they are mixed with a toasted carmel sweetness. Alcohol also makes it's presence felt. Not much to this beer, but not offensive. Mediocre."
"From the bottle pours a deep, rich amber color with a white foamy head. The head disappeared quickly. There was no lace present on the glass. Smells very rich and malty, almost a roasted character. Taste is again a rich deep malt presence, though not as much as you would think by the smell. It seemed lightly hopped in the finish, and ended rather dry. Mouthfeel was slightly thin, but carbonation was good. Overall, not bad. Good malty character in this one, I will probably have it again, but I may not search it out."
"Overall a good beer. I would buy this again."
"Import bottle. Kicked up a rather tall head when poured into a tall glass. The thick head persisted, leaving rings behind. A dark amber body with almost no carbonation bubbles, but little pinpricks on the tongue. Taste is very sweet, more than malty. Hop profile is mild, but somewhat like a Vienna. Has a pretty good lager finish. ABV is a nice bonus, made me decide ""it must be a bock"" before I learned what style it is for certain. Definietly go for this if it's in an Italian restaurant."
"In the aftertaste, a lot of malt again, but well balanced by the erbal hops."
"A beautiful ruby-brown color, with a very pleasant bread aroma. I've had this twice recently at two small specialty pizza parlors in town. The taste is a malty haze, warmed by the alcohol, with a hint of sweetness. Feels great in the mouth. The alcohol is not overpowering at all, but is in perfect balance with the beer. Compliments Italian food wonderfully, but this beer should be seen more often elsewhere. One of my all-time favorite beers."
"This is certainly drinkable, but, being a doppelbock, it's a relatively meal-like beer. I haven't eaten anything besides an orange since noon (it's now a quarter after midnight) and I would think twice about a second one."
"Very drinkable brew, a pleasant surprise."
"Well, I was honestly surprised that this beer was going to be this good, since I was expecting a bland macro lager until I saw the Doppio Malto label and the 7.2% ABV. Just goes to show that diamonds in the rough can be found just about anywhere, and this is certainly one that I'd have again!!!"
"12oz. bottle: It poured a kind of coppery-amber color. Just a hint of haziness to it. A fairly large head that went to nothing rather rapidly. The nose is a bit bready/fruity/caramel, but a bit weak. I had to give the nose a good snort to tell what was in it. The taste is very malty sweet: definitely some fruits in there also. Some alcohol taste. This is a definite not bad. It might also be the best beer available in some Italian restaurants, which isn't a bad thing!"

"I was pleasantly surprised with how good this doppelbock was. It constantly had me coming back for more. Well worth trying."
"Last time I was out at a local Italian chain called Bucca Di Beppo they had this at the bar so I ordered one with my meal I was shocked that since I had this beer one first entering advocacy that it held up to my expectations of my original tasting. Appearance: Dark amber ruby tones with a nice cream colored head fills the glass nicely leaves with lacing evenly strung. Aroma: Deep plum sharp malty tones very big doppio malto or dopple bock or double malt is what these all translate toward awesome with pasta pizza or by itself can't beat the aromatics and complexity of this ale. Taste: I'm of Italian decent with the last name Rasicci and come from the regionne known as Abruzzi very solid taste with rich malt tones with plum undernotes of full flavor excellent just as I remembered the beer amazing amount of malt and flavor excellent. Mouthfeel: Medium to full in body nice carbonation this beer is hard to beat. Drinkability: Have this one next time you go to an Italian restaurant you will not be dissappointed believe me."
"Perhaps my review is a bit gracious because I tried this beer expecting to not like it and to my surprise, I liked it. It's not uncommon to hear that people think the Italian's don't know beer and should sick to wine. This beer might change that perception. It had a subtle aroma and was deep red in color. The flavor was good, a bit sweet and it doesn't linger with an after tatse. It poured with a nice frothy head that retreated as quickly as it charged. I rate it as a ""pleasant surprise""."
"Larssa Doppio Malto (Double Malt) This uniquely styled brew pours a dark rusty color with firm beige head. A big sweet malty aroma offers a bit of damp hay and hop background a bit of alcohol is noticed upon opening. The heavy sweet malt (think 10/40 weight motor oil) is the focus of this brew. Flavors of fresh baked bread and sweet caramel flood the mouth and soothingly bathe the throat. A lemony lime sour bitterness mixed with a faint apple taste delivers a little hard cider-like flavor. The alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering."
"This beer lasted 45 minutes before I finished just half of it, and wond up tossing the rest."
"This one is the best beer from Italy that I've had, but that isn't saying much. Alcohol is present the whole way, maybe a little too strong at times. The balance is exceptional for a beer, but maybe not for a doppelbock. Anyways I enjoyed it but it's not making my rotation."
"Let this one warma bit for better flavor. A nice dark caramel appearance with a decent head. Smell is very malty with alcohol presence. The taste is equally malty with alcohol presence, but with anice smoothness, Mouthfeel is ok, but a bit too chewy for my liking. If you sip this brew, drinkability is fine."
"Nice to know it you went to Italy you could find a good dopplebock around. The bottle I have lists tha ABV as 7.2%."
"A very good looking beer that falls a bit short in other dimensions. This gorgeous brew is a deep ruby amber with a great tan head and superior lacing. The nose is light but gives off malty notes and hints of light spicing. The flavor is malty with very nice spice hops, but it comes with a medicinal overlay that is not as pleasant. The feel is medium with a long aftertaste that is a bit cloying. Drinkable in short sessions."
"Cheers"
"update 24/12/03 found some old bottles of this and it was like saying goodbye to someone who had days to live. it still makes me ask the question of why they had to change it. is quantity more important than quality? it appears so it the case of this brew. im farewelling a classic. vale moretti la rossa."
"I wouldn't believe this was 7.2% if I had not read it."
"Pours to a ruby-brown color with a creamy thick, tan head. It has a very malty, bready aroma. The flavor is malt and bread with a drying bitterness in the finish. A rich, flavorfull beer. It is a medium-full bodied brew, that is easy drinking for a doppelbock. A tasty brew."
"Bottle.Yes, a very good beer indeed! It was very drinkable, the alcohol was pretty well hidden and this was a beer that I enjoyed rating.It poured a large sized ivory head that consisted of fine-large sized bubbles that was mostly lasting.The body was clear with a little bit of carbonation observed and the hue was amber.The nose had notes of malt, caramel and fruit.It had a light bitterness flavor to it and it was on the sweet side.This beer was very pleasant and smooth and it was medium bodied.There was excellent lacing with this beer.I hope I have a chance to indulge in this beer sometime soon!"
"Actually easier to drink than what I thought. Probably won't get it again, unless I knew I was going to enjoy it with a hearty meal. pat"
"Brown color, large white foamy head. Aroma is malty and sweet. Roasted medium malts. Slight hoppyness. Nice hop to malt balance. Full round mouthfeel. Smooth taste, good flavor. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter. Dosn't really taste like a dopplebock."
"Pours to an off white head that falls to a ring of fine foam and floating patches of bubbles. Red-amber color. Aroma is of roasted, almost smoky malt and alcohol. Flavor is sweetish and malty--reminicent of scotch ale or certain kinds of barleywine or doppelbock. It is not bad. I've had better. I confess that I generally don't like this style, but for what it is, it's OK."
"This is some pretty good stuff and it went very well with the pasta dish I had at a very nice Italian Rest...Pours out a amber color more on the red side though with a medium off white head that lingers around for a while. Sweet malty taste was what complemented the food or maybe it was the food that complemented the beer. This was a very good and an excellent choice when eating Italian food..."
"I like this beer. DidnÂ’t know what to expect from the aroma I first got. The complexity is evident in the nose but quickly dissipates. However it does not do that in the glass. The ABV is sneaky too as the over 7 percent is not that evident. You can taste it but not at 7 plus. Nice finisher beer with my dessert."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with a moderate head and some slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty and fruity with a lot of spices. The flavor was a little bit malty with a lot of sweetness behind it. There was also some caramel and spiciness in the flavor, but it finishes a little bitter. Not a bad beer, but I prefer the regular Moretti."
"Tootsie roll-chewy tannins, assertive, keep this delightful confection from assuming the sluggishness its girth might otherwise impose. Excellent."
"Poured a transparent strawberry copper color. Had a good off-white head that sat still, forming a shape of irregular foam and bubbles, supported by good carbonation flying up. Smelled of chestnuts, sweet fruit, maltiness, but quietly quite spicy. Taste was malty, like a Â“redÂ” sweetness, and created a quiet but substantial body of flavor. Had a nice calm dryness with some spice in there, too. A smooth mouthfeel this beer was a delight to drink. Simple but effective and very food friendly."
"A step of from their lager is this offering. Pours a dark amber, and with proper coaching, a good head. The taste is of overwhelming malt. Almost to the point of overbearing. After an initial sip, one gets used to it and can appreciate other tastes such as caramel and toffee. Just above average, this beer is good with hearty foods."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a deep amber, with a smallish head, that didn't last. No lacing present. Aroma is very malty with hints of caramel or toffee. Taste is the same malt sweetness with a hint of caramel or toffee. Slight bitterness in the finish, but no real hop flavor or aroma. Very smooth mouthfeel, you can feel the alcohol in the finish. Not as good as its German counterparts, but still a very good beer."
"Origianlly sampled on 7 April 2003. It pours a pretty red color, crystal clear, slightly malty nose & it has a smooth taste. It's a very drinkable beer. The maltiness is good and, as expected, not much bitterness. I was really surprised by the quality of this beer."
"Drinkability: This is an alright brew, considering it's a doppelbock from Italy. While it's not as good as the best German examples, it does compare favorable against many that come from Deutschland."
"Poured a deep auburn/brown color with nice head.Smell was sweet and a liitle doughy,taste was malty sweet and of toffee,the alcolhol was prevelant in this one.I think this would go well with a deep dish pizza,the sweetness and alcohol would match well.The best Italian beer out there would be my guess on this one."
"Crystal clear mahogany body is topped by a 1/2"" tan head that fades relatively quickly to a very thin layer of foam. It exudes a roasted malt and caramel aroma. Hops? We don't need no stinking hops. Upon sipping this beer, a powerful malt sweetness envelops the tongue, massaging it with roasted malt, caramel, and molassses flavors. There is some earthy bitterness on the finish, but it's just as likely to be from the roasted malt as any kind of hops. The alcohol releases a bit of bitterness as well, with definite alcohol notes in the aftertatse. There is also a slight hint of oak-tainted malt that lingers around as well. The mouthfeel is good, but not as powerful as the flavor deserves. This is a very drinkable, malty dopple. Even what are normally referred to as ""hop burps"" are tainted with roastiness. I really enjoyed this beer. Give it a try next time you see it. Although the name reminds me of a Ricky Martin song title, the beer provides no such horrifying images. The only horror may be that I have just one. For now."
"Thanks to NeroFiddled for the sample!"
"Wow, what a head on this baby, over two inches high after a vigorous pour into the glass. Color is a deep amber and the mile high head was a frothy tannish, light brown. Looks scrumptous, I couldn't wait to drink this. Smells of roasty sweet malt and fresh, sweet bread, a bit faint spice note. Taste of this is pretty good, sweet roastyness, malty toffee, fresh and smooth, very full-bodied feel that has a light chewyness and finishes slightly dry with a hint of spice. Very nice indeed. The head had a life on its own for the first few minutes and the taste and feel is darn right perfect. I thought Italy was known for its wine, but this beer changed my mind about that cultural fact."
"Finally had a chance to try this beer, after a close call in NYC when I saw it on the shelf at a little Italian sandwich shop but found out that they were out of it (damn!). Pours dark brown with a roiling tan head, very thick, with a burnt malt aroma. Very sweet and chewy. Perhaps not as complicated or deep as a true German doppelbock, but truly not a bad beer at all, one that I would be very happy to find on my table in the future."
"This threw me for a loop. I don't know why, but I wasn't expecting a doppelbock. Poured out to a nice dark amber in the glass. Aroma is that of malt and raisins. Taste is that of malt with fruit thrown in. Enjoyable, warming, but not a session beer. Very tasty."
"el_mocoso"
"This brew poured deep caramel in color with a thin beady head. I found the aroma to be very sugary with perhaps a licorice aspect. I must say I really enjoyed the complexity of this beer. Initially, it's like you're drinking candy-coated malts. It finishes a tad differently, where I would compare it to maybe a casky/whiskey characteristic. I was very pleasantly surprised, an awesome beer!"
"The color is surpisingly bright red with just a hint or brown. The head is a bit fizzy but fades quickly. The dopplebock smell is there; it's just a bit less pronounced than it is in this beer's German brethren. Caramel is the most noticeable smell. The alcohol is not overpowering or even very noticeable. Caramel and just a little molasses make their presence known in the taste. The mouthfeel is just slightly on the thin side for a dopple. Overall, this is a very nice beer, especially considering its country of origin. Compared to other dopplebocks, the price is right."
"Nice one here, not up there with the Master ""ators", but well done."
"A couple of years ago, I was in a pizza restaraunt, and the waitress came over for our drink order. When she listed the available beers, it was the usual sh*t, except for Grolsch amber ale (I'd had Grolsch before, and liked it, but never the amber - she brought over a swing top bottle, and I thoroughly enjoyed it with the pizza (and could understand why they had it). I never could find the amber in the swing top in any stores. When they say that LaRossa is the perfect beer to have with pizza (or italian food), I can understand. This is a cross between that amber ale, and Salvator! (it is quite similar!). Amber color, malty, sweet (but not overly so), and quite a kick! This is a terrific beer! Hard to find, but seek it out. You will be suprised. A creamy, warming treat! I'm going to ask my local Italian deli (who carry the regular Moretti) if they can get this for me!"
"Â– Just Needs a better label to stand out from the crowd I think."
"Pours a brownish amber hue with a white head. Tastes great I am surprised at how much I like this stuff. Great rich malty taste, caramel, toffee, a little bit of coffee tones. An underrated beer if I have ever tried one. I would recommend this to anybody who likes doppelbocks"
"While not a beer to make a permanent commitment too she's not one to be kept to a one-night-stand either. As with all memorable affairs, after a round of La Rossa Birra I can't seem to get the taste of her off my mind. I know that I'll return after a time to sample her wanton wiles once more."
"Color is dark red/purple, aroma is thick, luscious, spicy, heady. Smooth, but with a bite. Great malt component. Very lively and delicious! I don't know Italian, so I'll guess at the label. La Rossa Birra=The Red Beer. Doppiomalto=doppelbock? Tastes like one, but by any name, this rossa is a sweet delight."
"Dark brownish-red color, large creamy lasting tan head. Sweet malty, candy like aroma. Sweet candy burnt caremel flavors, full body, thick and full mouthfeel, this is not a bad dopplebock, I would like to try it agian."
"The beer pours a very deep garnet color, the head pertinent in size, frothy in texture with nice sheets of lace. Nose has a sweet caramel aroma with hints of molasses, malt, clean and fresh. Start is malt and slightly sweet, the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is mediocre on the carbonation, hops are quite pleasant and a slightly bitter dry aftertaste, and quite a decent beer."
"All of this and from Italy, some one has done their home work for sure on this World Class Â“Doppio MaltoÂ” beer. I now have a favorite Italian beer and La Rossa Moretti is it!"
"what a pleasant suprise this doppel is!   it pours out a dark ice tea color with a minimal head and no lace.  the aroma really struck me as authentic italian.....not only does it have the obligatory caramel malt and slightly boozy nose, but a definite flare of italian seasonings such as oregano, thyme, tomato and pepper. others have commented on the ""out of the oven"" pizza aroma.  couldn't agree more.  anyway..........the mouthfeel is right on for a doppel... thick but slick...tastes very malty but not overwhelmingly so.  not only lots of malty goodness...but ghostly hints of fruitcake flavors...alcohol warms the system;  way more layered and complex than other reviewers have given credit for.   this is the ultimate mega brew pairing for italian food.  i have a doppel taste test coming up and am excited to see where it might rank among the mighty ""ator's"".     one of the better brews i've tried lately and would not hesitate to go back to."
"Had this one at the wonderful Buca di Beppo here in Columbus. It was so nice to have an Italian beer that actually tasted good to go with some family-style Italian food. Dark copper color with a medium pizza-dough colored aroma (why not). Strong malt with slight alcohol aroma. The flavor was extremely malty, even for a Doppelbock. As such, it was a hearty beer that complemented my hearty food very nicely."
"Who knew Italians produced doppelbocks? Well, apparently Moretti does, and they do a good job with it. This one pours a deep ruby color featuring a short-lived tan head. Nose is of sweet malts, caramel and some chocolate. Taste is similar, bordering more on the sweet side. A bit of roasted malt lingers in the mouth, but the caramel malt is definitely present. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, but a bit thin to share company with the best. Fairly easy drinking, this Italian brew is a keeper."
"Drink up!"
"All the time I spent in Northern Italy and I thought Spaten was Italian for beer. Where was La Rossa when I was munching on my Fruta Del Mar? Pours a semi sticky head over translucent terra-cotta. Nose of cannoli and a steamy latte with Hazelnut syrup. Sweet malts are dispersed by a regiment of bittering hops for a decently balanced--if leaning more toward the malt side--Doppio Malto. Leaves a lively little warm spot on your soul. At $8 a six you can bet I'll be drinking more of this."
"Dark ruby colored brew. Rich aroma of roasted malt and caramel. Flavors blend the roasted malt goodness with a low grade sweetness. Just enough hops to keep the malt in check. Smooth, full, satisfying mouthfeel. A surprisingly well made doppel...a good representation of the style."
"Moretti Birra La Rossa: a Doppio Malto for Italy.  Very deep reddish color, with a skimpy off-white head, minimal lace.  Very impressive beer, heavy malt flavors throughout, very complex malts as well.  There was chocolate and toffee and coffee, but the predominant taste was a sweet and very pleasant raison.  This beer improved tremendously as it warmed up, and left a very soothing alcohol warmth after it was done.  Very nice and relaxing after dinner beer."
"Hazy, dark orangish-brown beer with a beige, creamy head. This beer had bread, sweet maltiness, and banana in the nose. Toasted grains, bread crust, malt and yeast flavors are present, however, the hops were only barely perceivable as a extremely slight bitternss at the very end. Also, this beer had light carbonation and medium body, a realy smooth drinking beer. Overall, good beer, good example of style, but I felt it was missing something in the flavor department in the middle that would have made it a great beer."
"Slightly hazy dark bronze / light ruby hue.  The ivory white head settles readily into a thin, but tight uniform layer that leaves loose lace.  Ripe fruitiness hits the nose at first, then is followed by medium caramel and toffeeish sweetness w/ a light toastiness.  Trace herbal hop nose. Predominantly bocklike aromawise, but there's an unexpected, slight, but pleasant tartness that persists as an undertone in aroma.  Flavorwise, this brew is lighter than the rich aroma implies.  The dominant malt contribution is from moderate caramel malt sweetness, with basemalt Munich adding toastiness. Hop bitterness is above the norm for style and offsets malt sweetness sufficiently to lend a polar balance since there's no hop flavor.  Moderately bodied, w/ an agreeablely smooth mouthfeel.  Finishes with a fading mix of honey sweetness and mild hop bitterness.  La Rossa is a stylistically odd, but intriguing and tasty brew.  It is reminscent of a doppelbock / American Amber hybrid.  Drink this brew at cellar temps like an ale."
"Clear. Deep rosy amber with reddish-orange highlights and a creamy light-tan head that holds well and leaves some very nice lace. The aroma is bold with rich, toasty, dark caramel and toffee malt notes. The body is medium and the carbonation is moderate. The mouthfeel is lightly creamy. The flavor is richly malty and toasty with dark crystal notes, some biscuit, a touch of licorice, some minimal hop flavor and a solid bitterness. The finish is dry and long lasting with malt and hop flavors as well as some residual bitterness. Although it's not a complex beer, it is very rich and engaging. Unfortunately, the alcohol is somewhat apparent, bringing down an otherwise great beer. Very unique in style - like a very big Vienna lager - which makes sense because of Northern Italy's border with Austria. Well worth trying."
"Nice bright amber color with a decent tan head that sinks down at a nice pace.  Nice caramel and biscuity maltiness in the aroma of this one but a little weak smelling for the style.  Smooth maltiness consumes this beer and it is not quite as sticky sweet as a lot of other examples of this style which is something that I actually liked.  A little thin in flavor and body however, bringing those marks down a bit.  The brew still remains rather drinkable however and is one that I wouldn't pass up at an Italian place if they were offering it."
"Dilemma: do I review this beer as a doppel, or as an Italian beer? As a doppel, I'd have to say it's merely average (which is not bad, mind you!). As an Italian beer, however, I'd say this is exceptional. Deep red/brown, with a nice thick head. Smell is malty as heck, quite sweet. Taste is a bit thin, and perhaps a little too sweet for my tastes: brown sugar, caramelized fruits. There is a certain out-of-the-oven pizza aspect to this beer that I find intriguing, though, and it does go really well with pizza and pasta with red sauce. Do you think they planned it that way? I won't necessarily go out of my way to find this beer, but I will order it occasionally when I'm eating Italian, and maybe I'll serve it at my next pizza party. Ciao!"
"This crimson red brew is awesome. I read some articles on this and it claimed to have a ""out of the pizza oven aroma"" and it came pretty darn close. Definitely a beer to try.A liquid bread that certainly is a savior."
"The best beer I have found imported from Italy and while there for two weeks and several cities not a drop of this to be found. Very disappointing, apparently only made for export. Good head, carbonation, dark but not chewy can be savored (the ABV is 7.2%) year round."
"Thanks go out to ZAP for nailing down this highly sought after brew for me."
"A double malt (doppio malto) in every sense of the term - this beer is strong from the malt (7% ABV) and sweet from the malt.  Dull caramel color, no head.  Malty aroma.  Full mouthfeel, the taste starts with alcohol, moves to caramel and finishes with butterscotch.  Pretty much what you would expect with this much malt.  Unless you've got a real sweet-tooth, you probably won't drink many of these."
"218"
"A rich orange in color...nice sweet nose of fresh baked bread...not a thick doppel on the mouth...flavorful though...nice sweetness...kind of a strong sweet dark burgandy cherry fruity taste.I wouldn't say this is complex but it is very good...Hops are not noticable and neither is the alcohol...maybe a tich syrupy sweet on the finish...Not an alltime great but a good solid beer..."
"Nice ruby color with a creamy head.  Sweet aroma, loaded with malt, and caramel.  Rich and sweet, creamy caramel, bitter chocolate and molasses.  Hops are well balanced with the malt.  Finishes slightly dry with a noticeable taste of alcohol.  If you like malt, hopefully you'll like this one.  Skoal."
"Pours a nice light brown or ruby red color with a good off-white head that dies after a bit, leaving a thin lace. Heavy malts in the aroma and on the palate, dark malts, caramel, slight toffee, and hops which create an ever so slight bitterness...the 7.2% is hardly even noticed. This was a very well balanced brew, and very enjoyable a DB from Italy..."
"Just too sticky  and doughy (malty), for me, a bit thivk and cloying in the end, just didn'y appeal to my tastes in the end."
"If we are to keep with the doublebock classification, then I put it in the same class as Sam Adams DoubleBock--a boozy, amber smackdown, but hardly a dopple charmer."
"A real surprise.  I have never given Italian beers much thought, but I guess that this is the exception that proves the rule.  Big, malty, rich flavor.  My new favorite beer with pizza."
"Very tasty Italian version of a doubble bock. I'm glad to see our distributor putting some marketing backing on this beer. I am holding out hope that I will start to see this beer on tap around Portland soon. With it's rich matly goodness I can only imagine how great it will be on tap."
"Very strong and not well intergrated in my opinion"
"I was not particularly taken with this beer.  Nice fruity front, but then it kicked into a candy-caramel malt sweetness that dominated any other flavors.  For such a malty beer, it seemed a little thin.  Nothwithstanding the big alcohol content, it seemed less like a bock and more like an Irish red."
"If you can find this beer, buy it and enjoy."
