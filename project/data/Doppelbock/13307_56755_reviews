"To hell with double bocks, this is a trippelbock.  It's super high ABV, but it's so easy to drink.  Honestly, you'll sip it because it's got such a barleywine character, but it goes down much easier."

"Never had a Triple Bock style. I know that's just a huge Dopplebock but fudge it. We can call it whatever we want"

"Super dark sugar smell with some soy and carmelized sugar. Not as sticky as i thought it would be. Booze is masterfully subdued, not invisible, but almost sessionable. Very simple though, not in the same class as a Celebrator, but really nice on a fall evening."

"01/19/14 From bottle at home. Eeeek! This is a muscular brew. Big nose, big flavor & big alcohol. Coffee/Toffee/And a little Smokey. Almost chewable. Lingering. No burn. Impressionistic. Yummy!"

"i have to start by saying the new label on this one is lights out amazing. billed as a triplebock holy ale, it shows the hand of some spiritual leader marking the forehead of the mikkeller character, but instead of the as wednesday cross, its the mikkeller hat, so sweet! love it! oh, and the beer inside the bottle here is also one of a kind (at least in my experience). only loosely a bock as we know them. malty red shaded dark brown sugar color, with a lasting and expansive white milky head that looks like star san all shaken up in insane concentrations oozing out of a carboy. the nose is understated compared to the flavor, but you dont realize that at first, because of course you smell it before you taste it, and its unassuming. malty and sweet, not unlike other big bocks, but the flavor is radical. its germany meets belgium meets denmark in a style that was never even real well defined to start with! genius! starts sweet and grainy, like unfermented wort with a hint of soy sauce on the finish, but not gross salty soy, gentle subtle soy like you might find mixed with honey in some otherworldy glaze, that is how this thing finishes. not stupidly complex, but pulling about as much flavor out of grain as possible. brewers magic here. like nothing else, and if this is lagered like most bocks are, or are meant to be, then even greater props for it. full body, and its sweet on the front end without being overly thick, and yet the finish thins out a little, and certainly isnt very sweet at all, which is shocking and unique and extremely pleasant. nothing bad to say about this one, except regretting how long i took to finally try one. this may be the final evolution of bock as a style, its that good."

"Update January 2014: Had another bottle of it, a big bottle (with Mrs. Gollem, yes), and I feel the need to up the grade a little bit. My my what a mouthful of delicious beer this is. Still a bit too dark for me, but man, it is so full and rich. I'm looking at the empty bottle, and the last sip, from half an hour ago, is still with me--almost like espresso in the back of my mouth."

"Bottle. Pours creamy brown with tall tan head. Aroma is caramel and blackstrap molasses. Taste incorporates those flavors with bread and cocoa. Thin and oily body. Not as heavy as expected which was a nice surprise. Alcohol hidden well. A nice representative of this style."

"O- Mikkeller continues to deliver. My girlfriend put it best when she said it's like a lighter bodied quad. Well worth the $14 for a 750 mL."

"Initially, this is a sweet, fruity, beer: lots of sugary rum raisins, maple syrup candy. The carbonation stays with this one, and for me, there's a bit too much of it. That said, there is smoothness to it; it's not as creamy as most bocks, but there's a velvety texture that lasts. After the first wave of sweetness, then we get some spice and some sour along with the sweet: orange marmalade, candied ginger, five-spice, burnt sugar, booze. A sipper, for sure."

"O/D - A pretty nice Doppelbock. Complex and strong with a nice sipping character. Complexity and a good flavour with new notes I'm picking up on as I go. A nice beer that deserves time and attention. Good stuff."
""
"Overall: This beer is outstanding. As it got to room temperature so many more of the rich flavors made themselves present. I think the high alcohol may have suppressed some of the flavor that you may get in other bocks, but there is a different level added by the high abv. Another awesome bomber by Mikkeller, looking forward to more."
""
"Overall: a fantastic interplay of intense flavours, that somewhat ironically mellows you out (ahem, 11%..); beautiful for sharing around a fireplace"
"Rich mahogany colour with ruby highlights. Pale beige head is massive, tight, lacy, and fairly retentive. Big malty aroma reminiscent of raisin bread, buckwheat honey, toasted nuts, cacao, and a hint of alcohol. Deep toasted bread flavour, rich dried fruit character, molasses, all very well-integrated into a faux-fruitcake profile. A hint of Restrained sweetness. Firm woody bitterness persists long into the finish. This huge beast of a doppelbock is unbelievably balanced. Heavy with restrained carbonation. Smooth, rich, velvety mouthfeel. Almost no alcohol heat. I can't believe how easy this is to drink. Big, richly flavoured, and gulpable - not much more I could ask for."
"O - Glad I tried it, won't be searching it out again."
""
"Frelser is a seamless dopplebock that weaves together a lot of varying and challenging flavors that are otherwise hard to wrangle. But the beer is ultra savory, succulent, and satisfying to the taste buds, stomach, and mind for a very complex and effortless session."
"D - Nicely balanced doppelbock. Great malty complexity."
""
""
""
"Overall. A very nice, big doppelbock. Not sure I'll make it through this whole bottle, it's quite filling."

"O-Excellent beer! Reminds me a bit of BCBS. This beer will age very nicely!"
"O - I can taste the alcohol but it's hard to believe it's 11%. Oh wait... I'm feeling it now as finish my first glass."
""
"O - extra tasty and drinkable, super pumped on this, highly recommended"
"O – I grabbed 3 more bottles of this for myself and 3 more for trades. It was fabulous and great to get through the LCBO. Loads of flavour and the cocoa and coffee malts over the fruity notes traditionally found in the style make for a delectable treat."
""
"for a solo attempt at a 11% 750ml I had no issues downing the entire thing, I`m not sure if that`s a good or a bad thing. I`m curious how this would age with the hops fading but it`s drinking great right now, another thanks to liamt07 for the chance at this one"
"Deep burgundy, but almost black with a soapy light brown head. Solid retention and lace. Nose has big malt notes, licorice, molasses, caramel, dark fruits and maybe some candy sugar. A bit of alcohol and some earthier hop notes perhaps. Taste is comprised of sugary sweet dark fruits, dark breads, molasses and syrupy dark candies. No alcohol on the palate, but the warmth is felt almost immediately (warmth in the face etc.) Some roast and/or hop bitterness in the finish. Full feel, and big body with a low carbonation. Sticky sweet. A very nice warming bock, going to put a bottle or two away for later this year."
"750ml bottle Pours a dark brown clouded lager in the stein with a 3 finger frothy cap that lasts well and laces the glass. Soft carbonation. Aroma is slightly understated when chilled – dark cocoa, sweet bready malts, some noble earthiness light whiff of fusel alcohol. Big rich chewy malts in front – chocolate, nutty bready with some figs and treacle all balanced well with some really resinous hopping = goes to a long roasty bitter finish with a metallic hop aftertaste. Wow a big beer. But is it a dark (dunkler) triple bock or just a hoppy version of a Baltic porter. Who cares, it’s big, rich, hoppy and at 11%abv it’ll get you warmed up real fast."
"This is excellent stuff, Im pretty sure it's the best bock Ive tried. Complex and very drinkable, be wary of the high ABV though - this one is for sharing."
"Overall, very nice. Not always a huge doppelbock fan but I like this beer."
"I'm tempted to call Frelser a German doppelbock in American dress but that would take away from its complexity. The more of this 750ml bottle I drink, the less I feel to prepared to say - it's such an interesting beer that no general statement can safely be made about it. 'Interesting' does not always (or even often) translate to 'Good', but in this case it has. Mikkeller puts out a bunch of beers not worth their price tags - but this one is."
"M - Medium body with a really big chew at times. Light to moderate carbonation."
"Overall: Good beer, drinks much more like a barleywine than a triple bock in my opinion. Put together well and has a good balance. Can see this one doing well in the cellar for a couple of years to smooth it out. Put down the whole 750ml without too much trouble. Would likely buy again."
"O - Big bocks are typically not my favourite style but this one is the exception - it reminds me of the Nogne RIS and I will definitely be grabbing a few more before they are gone. With a brew this complex you do not always get it, but I definitely got this one, well done."
"Deep brown with ruby highlights, 1.5 fingers of off white head, decent lace down the glass. Smell holds a huge malt bill, some sweet brown sugar notes, toffee, quite hoppy, citrus and pine are both present, dark bread, dark fruits, raisin and overripe plum. Taste like the nose has lots of malt, roasted, chocolate followed by hops, fairly bitter, citrus and pine, some earthiness, some warming alcohol creeps in but otherwise undetected, dark breads and fruits, some soy sauce flavours with raisins and plums. Creamy and lightly carbonated, full body with a good weight and feel. Solid stuff here and very enjoyable, a lot going on here and initially if I tasted this blind I would have thought this was an American Strong Ale but the doppelbock flavours are a little more pronounced as this warms, really good stuff here."
"O- I really do enjoy Mikkeller beers. I think this is probably their best one of the bunch I've tried. What's really nice is here at the LCBO the price is almost 6 dollars less than everywhere I've seen in the states so I'll have to pick up more."

"My first Mikkeller brew did not disappoint, but nor did it completely blow me out of the water. Still, this is an intriguing beer, full of flavour, and well worth pondering over a crisp Easter weekend. The price tag is of course expensive (13$), but what did you expect? Definitely worth a one-time go."
"A nice beer to be sure. This isn't a traditional doppelbock though with a firm, chalky hop presence."

"O - Pretty nice sipper. Imagine a super-charged hot sweet doppelbock."
""
"overall: having both the elements of a trippel and a doppelbock, strong but not overpowering (surprising given its 11% abv), not too heavy, very enjoyable."
"D: This beer utterly disregards the bock style and instead delivers a hop bomb. While it’s a decent brew, I think it’s inappropriate to classify it as a “triplebock.”"
""
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head.. In the aroma, a sweet oatmeal and a small alcohol presence. In the taste, a sweet roast, alcohol, and a nice chocolate presence. A small alcohol bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a a dry alcohol and roast in the aftertaste. A bit boozy, but a nice chocolate and roast."
"Overpriced for the quality."
""
""
"Notes: Nothing for the history books but certainly an enticing offering. Doppelbock are often not something I would necessarily go after. Maybe precisely because this one strays away somewhat from style I found it more enjoyable."

"Overall, I think there's a good dopplebock foundation but the alcohol dominates. I normally have no issue with a high alcohol brew but in this beer the alcohol seems to overpower some of the other flavors. The beer tastes like it's been aged in bourbon barrels. In a way it reminds me of Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine with all of the malt sweetness and the high alcohol. This would get a higher rating for taste if the alcohol were lower."
"O - A pretty good beer from Mikkeller. My first ""trippel bock"" but similar to some beers I've tried. I'd say it's a tastier, less boozy Samiclaus Classic. This is something I'd look to have again at some point in the future."
"O: Not a bad beer at all. This one has a lot of different flavors mixed into it but it comes off rather smooth. For the smell, and the look, this seems a bit disapointing. I'd drink this again, but there are other beers that I would try first. To me the malt is a tad strong, and once I got a glass into this that is what I picked up on the most. Good for a sample, if you like malt I suspect this will be right up your alley."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a dark brown/ruby red color with about an inch frothy tan head. The head stays around for a long time, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like toffee, brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit (plums, raisins), caramel malt and some booze. The taste of this brew isn't quite as sweet in comparison to the aroma. The flavors are pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's a good amount of bready malt/grain and a little bit of licorice noticeable too. It is a little boozy, but it doesn't seem like I'm drinking an 11% ABV beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's chewy, slick, and well carbonated. I thought it was a very nice brew, I liked it. At $13.99 a bottle I'd buy this one again, I think it's worth trying."
"Lovely beer. A bit malt bomb to savour, lovely balance struck."
"A real flavorful doppelbock that will probably only get better with age."
"A really out of balance triple bock. Pours a ruddy dark chestnut with a thick creamy finger of head that does leave a nice lacy trail in its wake. The nice is full of rich caramel malts, raisins and prunes along with a slight oak barrel quality. The taste brings caramel malts that are borderline too sweet without much else - it comes across as almost having a straight shot od grain alcohol being dumped into. Really out of whack and unpleasantly strong tasting - to me stone old guardian was the only thing as similar and the only beer that i have drank that i would say was worse."
"O - Pretty easy to drink beer, and fairly flavorful. A pleasant surprise."
"D - Definitely the easiest drinking triple bock I've had. Not a superb beer, but good for the style and not something I'd turn down if offered. Not sure why this needed to come in 750ml bottles though."
"drinks well. especially for the strength. boozy, but not harsh. a nice, warming, slow sipper."
"An agreeably drinkable, big-ass doppelbock? Oh my, yes. A tripel of the same accord? I'm not going to wank on beer etymology, so I'll just say, whatever the hell they call it, I'm in. If named (in Danish, at that) only for the well-hidden 'triple' or 'quad' level ABV, this is still one enjoyably tasty and bomb-worthy monster bock."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a good off-white head and a bit of light lacing. The nose is roasty with a touch of sweetness and some dark fruits. There is also a very small amount of smokey character in the background. The taste is lightly smoked and roasty and also carries a nice dark fruit presence. Impressively, the alcohol in this is not really all that detectable. The body is medium and the finish is dry, which some plum character being accentuated in the finish. A good beer, though I certainly would have preferred a 375 of this--a 750, even split up, is a bit much."
"This is a pretty alright dopplebock. I enjoyed drinking it. It doesn't achieve the complexity or specialness that Frelser's gigantic pricetag warrants, so I likely won't be returning to this beer. Still worth a try for big dopplebock fans. Finally, props to the label art. It's abstract and almost like a Rorschach test from afar, but up close you see that it is the legs of a goat (paying homage to the traditional connection between bockbier of any sort and goats on their labels)."
"A full bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation that is prickly on the tongue. Quite a warming brew that makes for a decent sipper that is well balanced if you can ignore the mineral/chlorine/green taste."
"Pours a dark thick gem, with white head that leads to alce. From private buying club. Big bold roasty aromas. Bold taste of roast, coffee and chocolate. Not too thick, still quite drinkable. Alcohol well hidden but it warms the body and then fogs the brain. Amazing meal in itself."
"Overall this is a great beer that I am glad I sampled as part of a 4 beer sampler. The price for this in the bottle is probably in the teens and outrageous so in smaller qualtities, it can be enjoyed an appreciated."
"Drinkability: Don't let the fact that its referred to as a triplebock scare you off - there's no soy sauce or infant tears in this one. An excellently crafted doppelbock, crisp, clean, flavorful but elegant. The 11% if fooling no one, so take it slow, but give it a shot if you see it."
"D: Tasty. For 11% ABV this is very drinkable, although for the money, I'll take Troegenator over this any day."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt with notes of warming alcohol and light caramel notes. Taste is also a nice enough mix between some caramel malt with light fruity ester. Body is about average with good carbonation and some alcohol was apparent. OK but still quite different from some staple of the style - lacking some ester that I usually associate with the style."
"An interesting take on the Doppelbock style, and perhaps a sign of things to come if Tripelbock becomes instated within the community. The hops overshadow everything else with authority, leaving a bit of a hodge-podge to be deciphered when all is said and done. Would have been nice to have some balance in the flavour with all the notes present in the aroma."
"And we all thought there was only one triple bock. Hell, this is now the third I've come across. It pours a slightly clear, deep, dark ruby brown topped by a finger of thick, sturdy, light tan froth. The nose comprises graham crackers, dark wheat, black pepper, brown sugar, nutmeg, rye bread, pumpernickel, cinnamon, figs, and what seems like a handful o' raspberries. The taste is very similar, though the berries come through stronger, leading to a bit of a cardamom-y flavor near the end. The breads in the nose are toasted a bit, and some roasted marshmallows are added to the proceedings. Honestly, I'm not sure of this bottle is infected (hence the slightly sour bit at the end), but, even if it is, it isn't (yet) a problem. The body is a rather hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, another very nice brew from the Danish gypsies. And, on further sips, any thought of infection has left my mind. Instead, thoughts of ""This shit's tasty!"" have taken over. Get some!"
"D: Well you certainly wouldn't make a habit of downing pints of this, but this is definitely not hard to quaff. There is no noticeable booze in the mouth, but I can feel it in my throat and in my belly, but this is enjoyable. Definitely recommend this. Maybe a bit pricey, but this is definitely a tasty beer, and I'm bummed that I didn't grab a second bottle."
"D - For an 11% beer this one was pretty easy to drink...but I would watch out as it would probably creep up on you...nice flavors all around from the sweet caramel to the chocolate-like finish"
"The beer pours a brown color with red highlights and a tan head. The aroma is roasted malt, toffee, dark fruit and a little bit of something that resembles trash. The flavor is dark fruit, toffee, roasted malt and surprisingly, no alcohol. The beer is very dry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A pretty lofting rating so far, not sure its that good, but its pretty decent."
"Overall I certainly would classify this more of a doppelbock than a bock based on complexity. It's very drinkable for such a big beer but the sweetness begins to wear on me after one glass. A well done beer in a style I'm not terribly fond of. Worth a shot, even more so if you're a fan of the style."
"D: The only thing keeping the D score from being a ""5" is that the abv, while not intrusive, finally makes its' presence felt towards the end of the bottle. Other than that, this was fantastic! The hits just keep on coming from Mikkeller!"
"This is a very well-crafted mammoth of a brew. Better put your shoes on before you drink it."
"D: Well, let's just say I will be buying a few more bottles and aging at least one, hoping the mouthfeel improves. Thank you Mikkeller."
"ABV is evident but this is really tasty stuff. The Danes pull off a classic German style with a twist."
"I couldn't drink too many but not because of the taste."
"A nice enough beer, but I'm not sure how often I'd want to revisit this."
