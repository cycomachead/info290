The lacing is close to ring-like at first then near the the of the drink is very spotty. The aroma is very nice of dark fruit sweetness and malts for the most part. More going on with the taste as the plums and dates (?) add great flavor to this wonderful brew. Medium+ bodied with perfect carbonation. Goes down smooth with no bitter finish at all. A great brew!

The taste is similar but there's a nice roasted earthy funkiness in the background. The body is just right with a silky feel and finish. This is what I think of when I think of doppelbock.","delta490","May 19, 2014"

It begins with dark fruit, progresses to toffee/caramel and ends with a rich toasty sweetness.

I like it a lot and if I were to detract any points it would be for the very faint head. I give it a solid 4 out of 5, maybe one notch higher. I am not happy about the ownership of the brewery and that destroys any chance of me buying it again.","WissBrauSean","Apr 11, 2013"

Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, raisin, apple, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, floral, brown sugar, light roasted malt, and earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity esters. Taste of caramel, raisin, apple, molasses, toffee, brown bread, toast, brown sugar, light floral, light roasted malt, and earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, molasses, toffee, brown bread, toast, and light roast on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent doppelbock. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 09, 2013"

The flavors all come together nicely on the front end, but it gets this strange bitter/alcohol thing on the finish which lingers.

The malts are extremely prominent: rich and toasty, with caramel and molasses overtones, and a hint of dark, brown bread on the finish. A moderate carbonation level doesn't quite eclipse the dash of bitter that sets off the malty sweetness very nicely. It's very very assertive, but not cloying in terms of sweetness. A hearty, solid German-style beer; a little too strong for a session beer, but a couple of 'em will weigh you down very nicely.","JesseC5683","Aug 22, 2012"

Hops are dry and nicely bitter with a light herbal flourish in the crisp finish. A touch of leafy oiliness lingers stretching it out a bit. Feel is a bit light but nicely weighted with a decent amount of heft and a smooth light creaminess in the back of the overall crisp feel.

Still there is an upfront brown sugar sweetness only this time with a more pronounced toasted grain character. Hops balance through the middle and take it to a bitter/sweet finish.

It's not cloyingly sweet and the ABV is not noticeable. The mouthfeel is full and the flavors linger in the mouth, but it is very pleasant. The carbonation is well done.

4.15,6.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Enjoyed for the first time at a party. Have always enjoyed offerings from Spaten in the past. Pours a caramel color, not much head. smells of bread or brown bread, toasted. Malty, and even sweet. Taste is much the same, bready, biscuity, malty, brown sugar or molasses sweetness. Mouthfeel was o bit too syrupy for my liking, but that did not deter my drinking and liking the overall product. Will drink this again.","gskitt","Jan 16, 2012"

Taste is all of them combined, nothing really dominates, but very sweet. Body is thinner than I prefer, not much carbonation, not overly dry, and easy drinking. This is not my favorite style being a hop head. Wish it was less sweet and fuller.","SawDog505","Jan 14, 2012"

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a deep and dark reddish brown that is rich in both aroma and appearance. The head on this beer lingered for quite a while. The aroma of this beer is extremely sweet molasses like scents with a touch of husky grain and some plum. The beer is intensely delicious with flavors of burnt sugars and grain with a heavy dose of molasses. The finish is slightly bitter but almost overpowered by the sugary sweet raisin and fruit flavors. There is a lingering taste that is almost how a cigarette leaves your mouth. It is a mildly stale and burnt taste. The mouthfeel is heavy and thick and a little chewy which is exactly what I want for this type of beer. Overall this is a really good Doppelbock and a beer I could enjoy any time.","jifigz","Dec 05, 2011"

My nose picks up a lot of dark fruit like raisins, dates, and prunes, with a molasses like sweetness. Tastewise, I love that this doppelbock avoids the trap of cloying qualities. There's nothing over the top about its taste and yet it thoroughly delivers on every nose hint. Its subdued and subtle character make it far more drinkable than most members of its style. A benchmark of its type.","droomyster","Jun 24, 2011"

This is a roasty, malty and slightly sweet brew full of rich carmel notes and coffee hints. I had this in a pint at ""Wolfe's Beirgarden"" in Albany NY.

The smell of the beer has a very nice malt back bone to it with a light sweetness coming though. The taste of the beer brings the malts onto the tongue full force and really leaves a good pleasing flavor in your mouth. Theres a bit of brown sugar in the flavor too with a pretty good bitterness in the end. The mouthfeel isn't heavy but just about medium. Overall I think that this is probably my favorite from Spaten, the Oktoberfest being second.","Knapp85","Jun 12, 2011"
3.82,-1.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Dark ruby, brownish color. One finger head with just a bit of lacing. There is some nice persistent bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass, almost like sparkling wine. Aroma is dark caramel, maybe toffee? grains, and an herbal note. Flavor is much the same, with a bit of a coffee finish, lighter though, like drip coffee. This beer has a really pleasant creamy mouthfeel.

Anyway, this brew pours a clear dark sunset burnt sienna-amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises buttery caramel, very light roasted malts, brown sugar, and Belgian candi sugar. The taste holds notes of buttery caramel, light roasted malts, brown sugar, cinnamon, faint-ish dark greens, and some mild cocoa powder. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.

Tasted sweet, of roasted caramel malt, and a bit of chocolate. It has some hops to balance it and is also a bit sour. The sourness was unexpected. I suppose it's probably just part of the espresso flavour that's to be expected, but I could have done with a little less of it. It was a very nice creamy roasted malt experience.

It's pretty sweet and raisny, with notes of prune and maybe fig. It's very malty and bready. The finish has a hint of bitter juniper and alcohol.

Moderate hop presence, mostly a malty taste, but also has a noticeable alcohol warmth to it.

As the beer plays out in your mouth, raisin flavors emerge from beneath the malt and finish dryly on the tongue. Somewhere in the middle of each sip, there is a faint but present hop character, a fleeting freshness in the middle of a heap of malts.

Rich malty caramel notes with hops support and substantial strength, although not anywhere near as strong as American over-the-top attempts on this style (Samuel Adams for example). Instead you have a well rounded malt showcase that when served (too) cold only improves with the rising temperature.

The lace around the glass is thick, but has no clinging power. Smells like nothing discernable, just a little sweet flowery aroma. OOOO the taste is nothing like the smell. Reminds me of licorice, something like Jagermeister, but missing the big kick. Color is a 29 on the SRM Beer Color Chart, but the color is not reprehensive of the flavor. The flavor is rich and mellow, with a hint of sweetness. The licorice really comes through, with a wave of sweet hops. There is very little bitterness although there is a definite flavor or hops. This is a beer that I would spend hard earned cash to drink.","beerprovedwright","Aug 17, 2010"

When I go out for beers, I typically try something new and then finish off with something I know I like. This has become a frequent finisher for me. If you haven't tried Optimator, then you're missing out. Seriously - this is one of those beers that's so good that it makes you sad when you find your glass empty. On a side note, this beer still tastes exquisite out of a bottle. Some beers, e.g. Young's Double Chocolate Stout, taste much better from a tap than from a bottle.","jmeador85","Aug 17, 2010"

It has a distinct, lush, prune-like smell with hints of licorice. A bitter taste but not overbearing. Not very heavy, and this is deceptive, because you will feel quite a nice buzz after drinking a few. The first time I tried this beer I drank it straight from the bottle and could not really appreciate it. Upon second taste I rather like it.

More herbal hops than I had expected, but they are still far in the back ground. I find that this beer lacks a bit of the doppelbock punch you usually get, and while good it is a bit subdued.

The mouthfeel for this one is pretty good, not as heavy as you'd expect from a beer at this ABV, but I wouldn't call it thin by a long shot.

First thing about the nose is it's very sweet and nutty. Reminds me of Dinkel Acker. Lots of almonds and molasses in the nose with a creamy sweet maltball character. The taste offers more candied nut flavor like brown sugar coated pecans, roasted almonds and lots of maple syrup. Very malty up front and not much in the way of hops anywhere, walnuts drowned in molasses in the finish and a little shot of dark chocolate. The mouthfeel was medium in thickness and even though it wasn't over carbonated the size of the bubbles gave it feel like a soda pop. Somewhat dry for the style. Good example and an old school classic.","natelocc787","Nov 30, 2009"

The taste is sweet and full of grains and caramel up front, a slight earthy bitterness and then a medicine-like alcohol and fruit/nut finish. Quite dry and a lingering of alcohol and the earthy bitterness. The mouthfeel is not quite chewy but almost, very full and this seems to almost stick to your teeth.

Once I plunged my nose deep into the glassware, memories of my grandmother's kitchen came to mind, as the distinct smell of vegetable soup came from this beer. The Optimator carried a bit of vegetable soup taste to accompany the nose, but the biggest part of what I tasted was bitterness. The mouthfeel was decidedly creamy, almost milky (perhaps skim).

It does not have the substance that I anticipate from a doppelbock and really does not bear the flavor all that well. It drank far better on tap and although vaguely differed from regular Spaten's crispness, the bite and refreshing finish really did it for me.

3.85,-1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Hadn't had one of these for a while and so picked up a sixpack. My mother-in-law was coming to town and she likes malty, dark, German brews, so I figured this was perfect- fits the bill without being too challenging. She had a couple before I realized that these were 7.2%! They certainly don't taste that strong and it had been years since I had any. Pours a very dark chestnut, not quite opaque and with very little head. Nice estery and malty nose with some light spiciness, malt, warming alcohol, and thin caramel. For me, what comes through mostly in the taste is the thin caramel rather than a rich maltiness. I like my Dopplebocks a little maltier tasting than this, but it does have a fairly elegant profile. Relatively thin in the mouth, but very smooth and way too easy to drink. I'd prefer a Celebrator if I'm having it alone, but this does pair very nicely with food with its smooth maltiness.","Georgiabeer","Oct 26, 2008"

Some of that dark fruit, mixed with some malt and I swear a touch of sweet chocolate, just a touch. Slight taste and warming effect of alcohol as it goes down but I found the mouthfeel slightly thicker and oily which I didnt care for as much.

There is a warming alcohol presence, not over the top, but you know you are drinking a fairly high ABV beer. There is a slight nut brown and raisiny flavor to the beer, overlaid with what is your typical malty bock flavor. There is very little carbonation, its consistency is syrupy, and there is a thick mouthfeel. The aftertaste has a slightly throaty quality, like you've had an alcohol soaked aperitif.

The head was off-white and quickly descended after the pour but retained itself well as a collar and laced well too. The aroma was mostly toasted malt but also possessed hints of nuts, alcohol and fruit sweetness. The flavor profile was full of malt richness augmented by fruit sugars. It was rich, chewy and nutty reminiscent of German candy but kept level but underlying hops bitterness. The finish was a little acidic but crisp.

A brew shouldn't have that kind of affect on a man, and I think I'm smart enough now to know my boundaries on higher alcohol brews, so I'll try it again. Pours a dark reddish brown with a resilient two-finger tan head. Once it fades an inconsistent, but chunky lacing is left behind. Smells of huge roasted malts with some caramel thrown in for good measure. Tastes malty and sweet with an undercurrent of hops and spice. Smooth and delicious with some roasted nuts in the mix as well. Carbonation is good in this light to medium bodied brew.

Anyway, this beer is kind of average for a dopplebock in that the flavor and aroma are pretty standard, however not as bold as most. There is a malty, slightly chocolaty aroma and the flavor has a bit of a dry mouth aftertaste where a hint of hops is detectable. It is slightly on the lighter side of moderate body and gravity, so it isn't hard to get thru and doesn't weigh you down (not til the 2nd one at least). If you're looking for a bold dopplebock, this may not satisfy. However, it drinks nicely as a mellower DB while walking around Epcot's world showcase..

The flavor is thick and full. Coffee and a hint of peanuts. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, this is way better than I expected. If the abv. wasnt as high, I would drink this as a session ale.

Slight roast to the malt makes for a very interesting taste. The mouthfeel is motor oil, props on doing that Spaten! The drinkability, for me at least, is fairly low.

It accomplishes this without being too dry. In fact, that finish is what distinguishes this from most of its dobbeplbock breatheren and makes it easy to drink quite a few of these. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, but with a silky substance. The drinkability? Dangerous, my friend.

Alcohol was faint, but detectable. Flavor was sweet, like dark, honeyed bread. Raisins and plums came to mind, as well as just a little bit of chocolate. Hops, again, clearly had a secondary role - a little balance throughout, but mainly present in the finish and aftertaste as a slight bitterness. This beer was lighter than I expected, with a body landing somewhere between light and medium. It was very smooth, almost creamy. Carb was light, but seemed appropriate for the beer, and you certainly enjoyed a warm glow from the ABV. Overall, quite good, but I would give the nod to Celebrator with respect to flavor complexity. This, on the other hand, is a little easier to drink since it is a bit lighter. ABV will sneak up on you...","","Sep 27, 2006"

Smell is hoppy actually, faint alcohol even in the aroma, distinctly german, with a sweet-spicy kind of mix. Taste is dark, sweet, full, domanantly malty, with the malt profile not as caramel dominated as expected, and overall mild on hops. Desirable caracteristics, and a bit sweet, with that alcohol note present and lingering. Mouthfeel is too overcarbonated and bitey, but medium. Overall this is good but not amazing.

The flavour had hints of fruit sweetness, but the dominant character was warm caramel and toffee maltiness. There was also a kiss of floral hops in the finish.

This was sweet and fruity almost even to the extent of a fruit lambic, but there was much more of a toasted malt character to set it apart from a lambic. It has a dry, slightly chewy mouthfeel.

There is a fairly active carbonation and the head consists of very small bubbles. Some dark fruits, molasses, caramel, nuts, hops, and skunk (from the green bottle?) in the aroma. It is very thick with crisp carbonation, coating the mouth well and leaves a warming sensation from the alcohol. There are lots of sweet malts that aren't cloying, and there are leafy/grassy hops with a nice bitterness. There's also notes of caramel, molasses, and nuts but there is a noticeable skunkiness that lowers the taste points.

Aroma is of rich sweet dark caramel and no sulfur to be detected means the lager yeast was treated correctly. The taste is an initial blend of deep caramel sweetness, munich malt roastiness, and a subtle noble hop bitterness which segues to an even malt flavor and finishes with a touch of anise, more malt flavor, and an alcoholic warmth. Mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired however as it dosent lend a smoothness to the beer. The carbonation is artifical and it leaves a harsh carbonic bite which i dislike in a lager.

Somewhat light on the palate, though only in so much as I was expecting it to be a bit thicker, it is actually about medium full in the body.

Taste is similar to the nose. Lots of swwet maltiness here. Caramel and toffee run the show. Hops appear just in time to lend a delightful balance. Alcohol is well concealed.

This beer starts gritty with a caramel bent, then turns bitter and nutty (walnut, maybe) as it rests on your tongue. It is a full-bodied brew with a finish that reminded me of cough syrup (not exactly as pleasant as the smell suggested).

I'm a sucker for malt and this one has it in spades, like I was hoping it would. A little more complexity would have driven this beer into the upper echelon of great tasting brews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless.

A vaguely fruity, almost grapey hoppiness brings things to a close. Flavor is lighter than I expect from a doppelbock, and sweet; near-syrupy maltiness with more touches of caramel. Pleasant butterscotch and otherwise buttery flavors meld with a hop bitterness that emerges as the beer warms. Yeast is present in the midpalate but never crosses the line over to breadiness. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, consistent with the sweetness of the aroma and flavor; not exactly firm, but consistently smooth with a clean finish.

The taste was strong in the malt department, mainly with caramel but also some chocolate and earthy malts as well.

Had no clue what I was getting myself into at the time, and I didn't even know what a dopplebock was. I think I thought it was really thick and off flavored at the time, so I saw it on tap at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse had to give it another shot. This beer is definitely toned down in comparison to most dopplebocks that are made today, but this isn't a bad thing because it is still a solid representation of the style. A deep ruby red tone with a thin cream colored head settles quickly. The aroma consists of a light bouquet of malty goodness, and with the first sip I couldn't get over how drinkable this beer is. With a nice trace of figs and plum to the taste, this beer had a very sweet finish very balanced and enjoyable. Like a said a little on the lighter side for a dbock, but the lighter body gives this beer an increased drinkability.","WVbeergeek","Feb 20, 2003"

This seemed very light for a Doppelbock, and I had no idea the ABV was over 7%. It's very easy to drink and would make a great session beer. Spaten...the Terrrrminator.

It is very smooth with a low carbonation, and a well-hidden alcohol content. I was very happy with this beer. It is certainly not amazing, but I was happy after waiting so long to try this one.

Moderate carbonation, medium to small sized bubbles. Nose is malt, malt, and more malt with a peppery hint of alcohol, some faint noble hops, and loads of caramel. Mouthfeel is thick and somewhat cloying, but not as syrupy as Celebrator or Salvator. Taste starts out with some bold flavor hops, fades to a potent amber malt background of figs, dates and raisins, gives a big peppery kick of alcohol and some spicy bittering hops, and ends in a lingering burnt-caramel sweetness with a soft metallic tinge. For the timid, this is a really good introduction to the world of dopplebocks. Not quite as cloying and sweet as Salvator, not quite as complex as Celebrator, and somewhat more drinkable than both.","Mitchster","Jan 25, 2003"

The alcohol is noticable on the finish, and it warms the throat on the way down. The finish also has a lingering sweetness, most likely also from the alcohol. This is not a beer for the hop fan, but malt lovers should but it by the case. The mouthfeel is very full and creamy. The drinkability is good considering the alcohol content.

The body is medium/full with a very fine and slightly moderate carbonation that leaves it smooth and creamy across the palate. The flavor delivers a rich toasted malt that's laced with fruit and some minimal hop flavor; as well as some clear alcohol. It's very well balanced and the sweet malt is always kept in check by a firm, underlying bitterness. It finishes dry with just a swirl of fruit and alcohol; and the malt never clings to the palate.

As a whole the bouquet is pleasant; I just had to work at smelling it. The palate is plenty malty, it is chewy and both lightly roasted and tasty sweet flavors appear. Chocolate covered raisins and a note of hops finish the beer nicely. This is a fine doppelbock, simply lovely. Medium-full in texture with low, natural carbonation that helps produce a relaxed mouthfeel. I was inspired to sip yet this is an easy drinking doppelbock.

3.85,-1,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I guess I'm spoiled by Celebrator and my expectations weren't met by Optimator. A fine beer but just not as chewy and full flavored as the former. Side by side the comparison probably would of been worse. A nice, malty example, but not the German brewer's doppelbock art.","QXSTER1","Mar 07, 2002"

4.03,3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I'm working my way through some different doppels and this is another good one but not one of the top ones I've tried...It is dark brown in color...minimal head...malty aroma with some alcohol on the nose..I like the way it tastes...It's sweet but easy drinking...not as much taste complexity as Salvator or S.A. Double Bock Still a very good doppel...On the deep finish I do sense a bit of a hop bite trying to balance out the sweetness but it's hard to distinguish immediately...Overall this is solid, but not spectacular...","ZAP","Feb 28, 2002"
2.74,-29.6,4,2.5,3,3,2,"Deep amber color, small head, mild sweet flowery smell.  Caramel-sweet taste, not strong alcohol - or anything else.  Sticky, thin mouthfeel.  Wouldn't want to drink more than a couple of these.","nklatt","Feb 26, 2002"
4.28,10,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This is a damn fine doppelbock.  Goes well with meals or just as it is.  Quite a bit of complexity to the taste.  More than just a beer.","mmthompson33","Nov 03, 2001"

4.06,4.4,5,4,4,4,4,"Toasted caramel aroma and solid malty caramel body.  Finish is sweet and moderately bitter with nice separation between the flavors.  Not as good as Celebrator IMHO, but pushes a close second.","Brent","Oct 13, 2001"
