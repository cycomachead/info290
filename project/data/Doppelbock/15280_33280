3.48,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 9/2014. Pours crystal clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas of dark/roasted/bready malt, dark fruit, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, herbal, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Good complexity and robustness of dark/roasted/bready malt, dark fruit, and earthy hop flavors; with a solid bitterness/sweetness balance and some light cloying bitterness on the finish. Pretty clean on lager flavor with no overly estery notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly creamy/sticky, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid doppelbock style. Good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, dark fruit, and earthy hop flavors; and smooth to sip on for the big ABV. The cloying bitterness/stickiness definitely killed the mouthfeel, but there was some good malt complexity overall. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 26, 2015"

3.79,9.2,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"My introduction to the Atwater family of beers. It pours a rather dark sienna topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises deep caramel, light roasted malts, graham cracker, dark breads, and a twinge of cocoa powder. The taste brings in more of the same, with the sweetness inherent in the smell coming through a bit subdued, the breadiness taking firm control. There's a touch of vague fruit in the finish, but it doesn't stick around long enough for any sort of positive confirmation. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a pretty nice d-bock, one that doesn't overdo it in any category save drinkability.","TMoney2591","Jul 20, 2013"

I have had some in the style that were syrupy sweet. For me, less sweet = a good thing. Mouthfeel was big and full to the point that I thought that I had a spoonful of pudding in my gob. Whoa! This was extremely smooth with faint tastes of coffee and chocolate and some heat. I got my first swallow down and a moment later, it hit me with the kick of a Missouri mule.

When first tasting one starts to gets a slight tingle on the tongue with nice Roasted Black coffee notes with slight very slight sweet notes. This was great I love the Roasted taste and I love the black coffee but the alcohol and hops destroy any other flavor coming through and for a doublebock its not that sweet.

Aromas of rich, smokey molasses, and sweet caramel invade the nostrils. Flavors give a roasted coffee character first and foremost, with an underlying hint of the dark, rich molasses, a smokey highlight, and a hint of licorice. For all of the sweet attributes, the beer remains very well balanced. The aftertaste is more of the smoke and roasted coffee, with the sweetness regressing rapidly from the palate, leaving you with a crisp, dry finish. Tasty brew.","GarthDanielson","Nov 18, 2011"

2.87,-17.3,3.5,4,2,3,3,"Overall I thought that this was an OK Doppelbock. For being classified as a Doppelbock, it really doesn't have a lot of things that you would associate with the style, it's pretty dark, had some chocolate and coffee flavors, and had a low amount of sweetness. The thing that really surprises me about this beer is the drinkability, it goes down super smooth, I don't pick up any booze in this beer, I don't know how the hell they hid the 9.5% but they did, it would be easy to drink a couple of these in a sitting. What I liked most about this beer was the drinkability and aroma, it goes down super smooth with no harsh booze taste, and the aroma was pretty chocolaty, not normal for the style but still good. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor and the body, the flavor was just too plain and subdued and the body was just a little too light. I won't mind drinking these in the holiday pack but I won't seek them out on their own. This beer is still worth trying, the drinkability will really surprise you. It seemed like Atwater sacrificed flavor for drinkability, I wouldn't mind a little sweetness and booze as long as it had a more robust flavor to follow it and more dark fruits. I love how smooth this drank but hate how flavorless it is. Some major tweaking would really help this beer but I don't know if you could add more flavor to it while keeping the alcohol so well hidden. This beer really doesn't fit the style but it still comes out as the best of the Holiday pack, for how smooth this beer goes down for being 9.5% makes it pretty easy to get drunk. but the lack of flavor really hurts it. Even though this wasn't a great Doppelbock I am glad they added it to the Holiday Pack, this is the strongest beer I have ever seen in one. I haven't been impressed with the new beers I have tried from Atwater but they do have a way with hiding the booze, this and VJ Black are dangerously drinkable.","StoutHunter","Oct 05, 2011"

Has that same unprocessed grains feel, dry and crunchy even, plays well off the round maltiness. Some black licorice too. The carbonation might have a touch more prickle to it, stir the flavors up some. Drinks smoothly but after half a glass you're starting to lose interest.","farrago","Jun 18, 2009"

Taste consistent with nose, but a chocolatey character dominates. Mouthfeel is what ruined this beer for me. Somewhere between light- and medium bodied, but way too much carbonation made it difficult to drink.

3.98,14.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Flavor is very malt heavy as well. I get brown sugar and molasses with a bit of chocolate too. Some warm alcohol comes through on the finish. Fairly drinkable even with the mild heat. No hops on this brew. Pretty nice beer, but could be a little sneaky with the hidden 9.5%.","sulldaddy","Sep 05, 2007"
3.8,9.5,4,4,4,4,3,"Pleasantly surprised, as my tastings of Atwater brews over the years haven't been very pleasing. This is one of the better attempts I've seen at the style (for Michigan). Not up to par with the Germans, Atwater has some refining to do for this brew, but it has promise.","Mitchster","Aug 29, 2007"

4.12,18.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer got better as it warmed up in the glass, and was a fine all around beer. It's big at 9.5% ABV, but the brewers did a fine job masking the high alcohol content. I'd be happy to revisit this one once the weather starts to cool off a bit.","Atlas1","May 24, 2007"
2.22,-36,4,2,2,3,2,"This beer just simply doesn't have much going on with it and almost tastes like it's a little infected. Sour notes rivaling that of a Jolly Pumpkin brew. The only real flavors are burnt caramel and chocolate squares of different variety. Mouth is a bit creamy but there is no finish to help this stand up and out. Very dissapointed after sampling there Dunkel which I found to be very sessionable.","mcallister","May 21, 2007"
3.33,-4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"I remember trying to figure out why this beer was a couple dollars more than the rest of the Fathead's take out selection and always had a hard time figuring out why. After trying it out besides the higher alcohol I'm not sure why the price mark up happened but this brew appears a very dark ruby brown tone with alarge tan head formin thick and leaves behind even streaks of lacing. Aroma has a roasty cocoa powder, a bit muted or even dumbed down with mild fruit raisin and other dried fruits soaked in alcohol with a minimal herbal hop nose. Flavor is sweet and roasty in the malt department provides some cocoa powder and mild fruitiness the alcohol is actually hidden pretty well in the taste with a touch of caramel, but overall I'm not getting a real authentic doppelbock feel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a harsher kinda abrasive carbonation touch of a sticky texture that tends to cling onto the palate. Drinkability is decent but I'm overall underimpressed and another factor in this beer is the need to watchout for the hidden alcohol.","WVbeergeek","May 03, 2007"
3.68,6.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste starts out with smooth milk chocolatey sweet malts. Scorched Sugar Babies, and candied cooked vegetables follow. Slightly meaty and tobacco-y. Sweetness stays throughout, with mildly bitter noble hops in the finish. Not bad. A fairly straight-forward example of the style, without a ton of complexity. Medium-bodied with a very creamy feel. A tad thinner than I like. Very smooth and the 9.5% abv hides itself very well.","alexgash","Apr 02, 2007"

3.98,14.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"12oz. bottle poured a dark brown with a small tan head that didn't leave lace as it quickly dissipated into just a slight film over the top of the beer. The aroma of this beer is a very faint caramel malt and no noticeable smell of alcohol for a 9.5%. Taste and feel seems a bit watery at first with some slightly darker fruit malt flavors like plums and raisins. This brew seems to lack in the flavor department but is a very easy drinking beer with a well hidden ABV that I'm sure would sneak up on you if your not careful.","Alkey","Mar 12, 2007"
3.85,11,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Mahogany in color, with some ruby highlights. Off white head holds well for a few minutes, then fades. Lightly roasty, toffee, and fruitcake aroma. Caramel and toffee flavors, but does not have the depth of the classics. Very smooth. Sweetness in the beginning. Medium body, with lower carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden. A decent brew, but not at the top.","Bierguy5","Mar 11, 2007"
3.95,13.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A welcome break from most bastardized American versions of such a classy brew. VoodoVator at least measures up to the style pretty well. A muted aroma or syruy malts, fruitcake, caramel, and rum promises rich flavors and good drinkability. The flavors closely mimic the aromas, following up with a light peat-moss smokiness, and complex dark / dehydrated fruits (dates, figs) and solid toastiness. The feel is sweet, but not heavy. The alcohols are well hidden, but warming and sweet. The finish gets a little 'cola' like in it's sweetness and tackiness -- falling back on it's darker color. Overall, a very solid brew, but lacks the punch to be considered great.","BEERchitect","Mar 09, 2007"

4.2,21,4,4,4,4,5,"This one has a nice label. It pours a very dark color with a tall head that falls slowly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty and sweet with some hints of chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is very sweet. Plenty of malts are upfront with the sweetness and there isn't much hop character to be found. There is a hint of astringency that comes across the top, but doesn't take much away. The alcohol is hidden extremely well. The body is moderate, surprisingly, I expected it to be thicker than it is. The drinkability is very good for the level of alcohol.","clvand0","Oct 24, 2006"
