"Dark Amber color with mild head and mild carbonation. Not a lot of aroma. Mild hops and some sweetness. Copper metallic flavor. Slight hop and sweet flavors. Not very good."

"Smells of nutty malts, lightly sweet bread, mild tofee, and a bit fruit (figs?). There is also a well incorporated perfumed warmth. Doesn't taste as good as it smells unfortunately.  Moderate sweetness up front, sweet bread and toffee mostly. The finish is warm, dry cocoa that tastes out of place. This is light bodied and under carbonated."

"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a beer that is slightly foamy, primarily smooth and slightly stagnant mouthfeel. Fitting for the style and weight of the beer, but a bit more carbonation would be good for both feel and aroma. Closes dryly, with lingering, heavy stickiness on the lips and palate."

"Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock pours a completely clear mahogany to maroon. There are gobs of cherry highlights when the beer is properly backlit. There are about two fingers of light caramel foam crowning the beer. Head retention is alright, but lacing is a nonentity. Not a huge hang up for me given the style though. The nose doesn't come through super well, but what is there is solid. It's a roughly 50/50 blend of plum and fig fruitiness and rich toffee. The flavor is a bit more potent, and brings a bit more variety to the table. Dark fruits and caramel still carry things, but there are secondary notes of biscuit and milk chocolate that give the beer a greater depth of flavor. The carbontion is nice and low, it keeps out of the way of the malts. The body though, just isn't full and rich enough for such a big malty beer. Sled Dog is a solid doppelbock, and one that I would certainly drink again. I don't think I'd seek it out though."
"Taste was what really matters to me....and it had a really pleasant feel in the mouth and a nice flavor with hints of chocolate and mild spice. I kinda felt like I was drinking a stout lite...(not meant to be a negative comment). It was real smooth, yet a little thick and malty. If ya never had...I suggest ya try it!"
"O - a fine example of a dopplebock; plenty of interest and good intensity"
"Notes: It’s not the most complex Doppelbock but there is something about its basic character that I like and find enjoyable to drink."
"This is my first taste of Wagner Valley (Vineyards) and I'm duly blown away. I like the label although I like the packaging for their IPA slightly better. Pours smooth, a dark ruby color with a struggling off white head (either because of the alcohol, or more likely from my glass). Huge malty sweet, brown sugar aroma that is impossible to avoid. The flavor is not overcomplicated, 4-5 flavors that are used well: brown sugar, malt, prune, and I swear something like a ripe apple in the back end, but maybe another ripe fruit would be more appropriate to describe it: lets say Asian pear to be really fancy. The mouth feel is silky with a medium to full body. The finish lingers for what seems like hours. If there are hops detectable it is only slight and maybe in the finish but balanced beautifully. My only concern is maybe a tad too carbonated...and in all fairness maybe I served it slightly warm, but it did foam up a bit on initial taste; however, this is nitpicking and in the grand scheme of things unnecessary."
"Overall - Although not a spectacular beer, I found the Drinkability to be quite high. The alcohol was well hidden and it seemed like the beer was gone in a flash. Not sure I'd seek it out again, but I'm curious to try some of the other Wagner Valley offerings."
"D - Sweet I could drink a few of these no prob...let it come up in temp."
"Poured clear and reddish-brown from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness date or ABV on label. The head was thin and disappeared quickly. Aroma is hard to describe, more like molasses mixed with wheat husk mixed with some hard sugar candy. Taste is a mix of malts, tart and sweet fruitiness. The ABV slowly takes over after a few sips, mouth feel is good. Decent lacing, indeed a different double bock beer, very complex and is definitely worth a try."
"Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock is a very clear, ruby lager that's topped with a khaki ring that leaves decent lacing. It smells sweet, melanoidal and grainy. It's full bodied and syrupy with a dry, chewy finish. It tastes slightly sweet and bready. Alcohol is present in the finish. It has a slightly medicinal bitterness. It's a solid doppelbock."
"Heavy, thick, sweet flavor. Candied fruit comes to mind. Not a session beer, but makes for a nice, slow sipping drink."
"D- The big plus to this beer was the ""clean"" mouthfeel, taste isn't anything spectacular, but it is worth trying. It's a good alternative if you want a refreshing doppelbock rather than a heavier one."
"Even mouthfeel, finishes tingly, fairly full. Tasty and drinkable."
"This beer is syrupy in the mouth with a small brisk carbonation. It is a very inviting beer that is easier on the palate than it's ABV suggests. This is a winter beer all the way."
"D: The bockbier doesn't feel like an 8.5% ringer. The bready base that improves over time."
"D: One thing I noticed was a wicked alcohol kick, didnt realize this brew comes in at over 8%. My first Wagner brew, didn't have many expectations, but this is definitely a great beer."
"A nice, warming interpretation of the style!"
"Pretty good Dopplebock in my opinion. Poured it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Has an amber/brown color that has good clarity to it. It had a cray slightly orangey creamy colored head. All in all a pretty good looking beer. The smell is good, very sweet. Mostly compiled of sweet malts, and dark fruits. Has a sweet toffee type aroma as well. The taste is also pretty sweet has all the characteristics of the smell, maybe a little heavier on the darker fruits and has an aftertaste of butterscotch. I thought that you couldn't taste the hops at all until about a minute after one of the sips, it's feint, but present. The mouthfeel is really good too, pretty creamy and smooth, reasonably full bodied. Only a slight bitter bite from the hops, more like a little pinch on the back of the tongue. Pretty drinkable beer of this style, nice sipper on a winter night."
"I really enjoied this beer. It is an excellent doppelbock that is great for cold nights with a rich bowl of beef stew."
"Reviewed on 8/11/09. Bottle. Pours a clear dark amber with a small tan head. Aroma of vegetal notes, bready malt, toffee. Flavor of bready malt, some cola notes. Wow, this is the same beer as the Amber Lager (maybe a little better? It hardly matters really). Pretty lackluster overall."
"Starts off underwhelming. Didn't even tip the glass when I poured, and it didn't really come close to overflowing. In other words: very weak head, and little lacing. However, the smell is big and malty, with sweet caramel and dried fruit dominating. The taste is pure doppelbock; bready malt, caramel, nuts, and dark fruit, with a bit of a sharp bitter aftertaste. I really liked this one, and the cherry on top? It was brewed just twenty minutes from where I grew up in the Seneca Lake."
"I haven't had too many Dopplebock's to compare this too so I'll keep it short. This beer has a great flavor. It was dark but not cloudy and the head hung around long enough for me to finish the beer. The smell was nice and it didn't sit to heavy on the palate. As for drinkability well it went down good and the crowd of people that were half in the bag would agree with me."
"Overall a solid example of the style. Nothing earth shattering but it does its job. I would not turn it down."
"The drink is silky-smooth and on the lighter end of the medium-bodied spectrum. Carbonation is quite mild and the brew is plenty drinkable. Thanks to Lum for the bottle!"
"Drinkability? A good solid, tasty example of the style that fits the style very well. I'd drink more, for sure."
"I guess we're trying the whole Wagner Valley line here. This one pours a clear amber brown with minimal head. Nose is malty and sweet. Flavor is pretty nice. Seems like a touch of apple tones. Smooth feel. Overall nice to drink. Not too shabby really."
"D: Drinkability is nice and this one goes down pretty easily. The flavors are a good, but the aroma and feel is a bit off. This is still drinkable and it would be a good session beer except for the supposed ABV. Is this thing really 8.5%? I mean really? This doesn't even seem like its close. Crazy. Good beer but not the greatest doppelbock."
"Date consumed: 29 June 2008"
"This is my first brew from Wagner Valley. It's not a great doppelbock but it's solid enough to give a try. I could see myself picking up a sixer each year to drink on these cold evenings. Thanks Israel!"
"Big bodied, a bit filling and a thick and heavy feel. Really a great beer for a cold fall evening. I could not drink another anytime soon though."
"Very drinkable, but only just one. It's strong and malty, and one should do you for the evening."
"You can buy these at the brewery, and I have a few bottles that I've picked up for pretty cheap. For 1.45$ you'd be hard pressed to find a beer of this quality at a bar."
"A syrupy caramel appearance with no head lowered the appearance score for this brew. Smell was disappointing..alcohol, but with a subdued malt. Taste belied the smell..it was rich, malty, syrupy, tongue coating. Mouthfeel was excellent..extremely smooth. Drinkability for the high abv was good...easy on the palate."
"D - This is a pretty good beer a good sipping and relaxing beer"
"Deep copper color and tan head. didnt leave much lace though. Sharp carbination.The aromas of rasins are mixed in to a nice blend of caramel and bread aromas. Malty rasiny tart flavor up front, slight roast, turns phenolic in the end. Seems a little bitter for th style. Light mouthfeel and dries out nicely. A good beer."
"Dark thin head. Dark amber in color. Bready smell. Nice malty taste and it is very smooth. Not very complex in taste IMO since all I get is the malt backbone. Not very boozy for 8.5% and it is very drinkable. I am a fan of the style & this is a good doppelbock. Cheers!"
"Overall a tasty and relatively complex doppelbock."
"The taste is a bit of a let down from the smell. There's a definite bready, malty, syrupy thickness to this brew, but there's some buttery, sour, tart cheese notes in there that is off-putting. A little too dairy for me."
"You can definatly taste the alcohol in this beer. Kinda interesting tastes of grapes and raisens but not too much complexity."
"Pours amber brown in color, clear, a very small light tan head hesitates then surfaces before quickly fading to nothing. Aroma is sweet maltiness and fruits, some strong melon aroma with some cherry and darker fruit as well. Taste shows a hint of the fruit but is overwhelmingly a sweet malt powder taste. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly thinner than I expected from the aroma, or maybe its just my perception from the low levels of carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste, just a gentle warmth and somewhat drying finish lets you know its there. Overall not a bad doppelbock, the taste was a little to straight up carnation malted milk for me, I could have used some other flavors to mingle with the sweetness, no problem finishing the beer however."
"D: Very good dopplebock. Smooth and easy to drink with plenty of complexity to keep it interesting."
"Poured into my Hennepin glass. A rough pour produces a 3/4 inch head that quickly settles into a 8th inch thin film. The smell is malty cola, with butterscotch and floral notes. The beer is a deep mahogany with reddish highlights when held up to the light. The taste is similar to the smell in having a deep roasted malt character along with that butterscotch twist. Very light gummy bear and floral hops add an edge to the overwhelming maltiness. In the aftertaste there is a nice nutty taste that I enjoy in Belgians and American and English Brown Ales. The alcohol is also covered up very well. I like this beer a lot, and from what I remember I didn't pay too much for it. Guess I better pick up a sixer next time I'm out."
"Finishes with more alcohol. Not something I would revisit."
"This dopplebock pours a clear mahogany hue with a thin khaki colored head. Lacing is very minimal with very little stickiness. Smell is a woody malt with a very subtle alcohol tingle on the nose. Smell also carries a nice brown sugar/molases hint to it. Taste is well done. Powerful malt presence that is quite sweet/sugary. A creamy/bread flavor appears a bit in the aftertaste that is actually quite enjoyable. Mouthfeel is quite smooth. The only real issue i had with this beer was the complete absence of hops which takes away from its balance. Alcohol isn't present which makes this quite drinkable for an 8.5% abv. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy your bocks."
"So, yeah, I'd drink 'em. A lot of 'em, I suppose! Ha! And this stuff is local and inexpensive? Heck, if I didn't homebrew so much I'd drink a lot more of this stuff!"
"When I think of this style of beer, I think of Ayinger Celebrator, or Spaten Optiomator.This beer is not even close. Pours amber brown, not much head,and minimal lacing. Smell is weak,but boozy. Some dark fruits,and malts. Taste was boozy,but again weak. More like a very light Belgin Brown, than a Dopple Bock.Dark fruit,and rasin mostly,but very week.This beer is not awful,but not a good representation of this style."
"On tap at the Pizza Plant on Main,poured a deep crimson color with a touch of brownish tint a tight 1/2 finger white head atop.Aromas of dark fruit soaked in alcohol mainly prune and raisin a faint roasted nut quality showed itself as well but it was faint.Deeply malty to be expected with brown sugar and raisin being dominant a touch of earthy-like unsweetened chocolate shows itself in the finish and the alcohol becomes more prevelant as it sits.A bigger malt bomb somewhat sweet and quite sustaining,well made in my opinion."
"Cheers!"
"Pours medium brownish-reddish with light carbonation, a little flat. Tiny bit o lacing. Smells of light malts, light caramels, and a little funk. The funk also is noticeable in the taste, which ruins it a bit for me. I like higher ABV beers and even the ones that taste like alkie, but this one was funky, maybe it went sorta bad in the bottle. Overall, I think this one is better fresh."
"Drinkability: Decently drinkable considering the ABV. I could see this being quite dangerous."
"A pretty solid Doppel here. Favorable in much of its character and beery aspects. Drinks down pretty quickly as the body is easily gliding in a non-sticky creamyness and silken maltyness of sweetness. Could have quite a few of these, no prob."
"Somewhat syrupy. This whole beer just screams thickness. Remains on the palate for a few minutes afterward. Have to sip this one due to it's thickness. I will now drink ""one"" for every variation of the word ""thick"" in this review."
"The beer is heavy on the palate, with light carbonation. There isn't all that that is special about this beer. Infact; each of these beers from Wagner Valley has been so-so. Not really great, but not bad either. I probably won't buy this again just because I want to try other doppelbocks. Overall not a bad beer, if I wanted a doppelbock and this was the only one I wouldn't be opposed to buying this again."
"D - Fantastic. I could drink this everyday. It is a bit sweet, but an ideal dessert beer. Would go perfectly with unspiced meat dishes, particularly lamb."
"This is an awesome brew. A couple of these will make you feel really good. I last had it at their brewery on Seneca Lake, near Ithaca, NY about 7 months ago, but I don't get the pleasure of drinking this beer as often as I'd like. The brewery is also a vineyard and it is situated on one of the most beautiful pieces of land I've ever seen. They have a huge outdoor deck where you can sit and drink pitchers or pints of their beers while looking across and up and down the lake. It seems like you can see for 50 miles in every direction. The sky seems to go on forever. I'm thinking about that view as I taste this and I'm dreaming of going back this summer and hopefully sharing a pitcher of this with a friend. I suggest you do the same. And certainly try this if you can find it."
"Drinkability: decently drinkable, overall a slightly above average doppelbock."
"I dont know if it was the freshness or an evolution of the recipe, but it is a bit better in my latest tasting."
"Pours a deep red color and creates a minor head. Smell is malty. The taste has a strong cherry aftertaste and the malt is very prevalent in this. There is also there is a warm kick to it. Mouth feel could be described as slick or oily with little carbonation. I overheard a employee of a local beer store recommending this one so I decided to pick it up. In my option it was a bad call."
"Small, dense, light brown colored head fades quickly to a ring. Glowing mahogany colored beer with a ruby hue. Faint aroma of sweet caramal malt and a bit of grainy burnt malt. Moderately thick beer with a smooth, almost slick mouthfeel. Mildly sweet caramel and dough flavors up front. There's a sort of cherry flavor that kicks in towards then, and it all fades as the alcohol warms your stomach in the finish. I bought this out of the cooler at the brewery just over a week ago, so I doubt it's old. There's something just not right about the aroma, and the flavor takes a wacky turn towards cherry cough syrup. Disappoinnting to say the least."
"On the whole, this was completely nondescript and uncomely. I had hoped for more when I first picked this bottle up in Albany, NY."
"I sampled a 12 ounce bottle, couldnt find any freshness dating.. Bottle openend without any gaseous release, and poured w/ a minimal tan head and light lacing left behind, low carbonation, but not flat. Faint sweat malty nose. Lighter bodied DB, notes of plums, berries, maple and caramel. Sweet throughout, no hop presence/bitterness. this is a pleasant dark, wintery quaffer. Would go well with hearty winter fare, stews, roasts etc."
"THe brew pours a clear mahogany with some garnet tints as well. A quickly dissipating thin layer of beige colored head foams up quickly and is gone. Aroma is chocolate, rich ripe plums and pears, raisins and maple syrup. QUite enticing aroma I think. First sip reveals a fairly thick body almost chewy with next to non-existant carbonation. Very smooth. Flavor is similar to nose witha mix of chocolate, red grapes, toffee and dark fruit. Very rich and lingering syrupy sweet palate coating finish. Quite enjoyable brew."
"Thanks to Francisweizen for this one. 12 oz bottle with no freshness date. Hard pour generated a couple bubbles, but no head over a somewhat cloudy brown liquid (had a reddish tinge when held to light). Smells of caramel, chocolate, and alcohol. Bock character is present, but much more subdued than I was expecting. Tastes sweet with noticable alochol. This beer is thick, sweet, and lightly (not?) carbonated. Some bock character is present as is a hint of chocloate and/or roasted grains. An acceptable doppel. Where's the carbonation?"
"Sled Dog will never become lead dog or win glory in the doppelbock version of the Iditarod (to stretch this metaphor to the absolute breaking point), but he's a good hound all the same. The world needs those competent plodders who get by on sheer force of will alone. This one will not let you down if you give him a chance."
" A decent brew and solid Winter Warmer but a lackluster Doppelbock."
"Served in a nonic pint glass. Nearly nonexistent head, but great color. Taste matches aroma nicely. Nice dopplebock flavor, it has that sweet maltiness that kind of eases into your taste buds. Drinkability is the draw back here, and maybe it's because of the style, I'm not sure. Better than most, but not as good as say, Celebrator. Definitely worth a try."
" The flavor carries out what the aroma threatened with a boldly fruity (raisin, plum) character right up front, some toffee and light creamy chocolate mixed with brandy as it warms, and a drying alcohol finish with lingering sweet malty notes throughout the mouth. Definitely a beer to be savored! Though the alcohol is a little distracting, it's also somewhat unique and fairly enjoyable. Worth trying."
"Pretty drinkable given the 8.5% abv. Great tasting version of the style! I was left surprised and impressed by this guy. Worth a try IMO."
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 1/2"" tan head which laces well. A darkly reddish amber brew, with a strong malty and dark fruits aroma, with a smidgen of alcohol. Taste is very similar to what the nose portends, which is a good thing. The dark fruits and alcohol become even more pronounced on the tongue. Mouthfeel is excellent for the style, and drinkability is great as well. Worth the search to experience. Nice to have a Dopple that doesn't go too far over the edge..."
"Overall: A fairly middle-of-the-road doppelbock, but certainly worth a try. My one problem with this beer is that it's a bit too sweet, reaching almost the point of being cloying after only a couple."
"This is some funky stuff, and not in a good way. Overly sweet to begin, the mouth then fills with a diacetyl/labrusca wine flavor which is highly unpleasant. This is made by Wagner Winery in Lodi NY, and it almost tastes like grapes instead of malts were used in the brewing process. I'm traveling to the Finger Lakes this weekend, and planning on making a trip to Wagner. I'm going to give this one another try at the source. Hopefully the bottle I had was skunked."
"It pours a dark mohagany with a slight haziness and a thin tan head. The aroma is fruity and malty with some chocolate and caramel in the nose. The carbonation is a little low for my taste, but it is not bad. The body is smooth and very malty. It is nutty with some roasty quality as well as some cherry and prune. It is slightly bitter in the clean finish and the alcohol lingers a little."
"A nice little dopplebock ... and cheers to running4beer and BiF for allowing me this samplinjg"
" This beer is a winter seasonal done up in the style of great German beers such as Celebrator and Optimator. The colour was reddish brown with a nice head but the first taste was pretty bracing. I noticed a predominate sweetness that never really left the beer. The malts and hops were out front but a lack of balance and finesse made this beer suffer in the drinkability area. Kind of reminds of Dick's beer from Washington; a bit unrefined but ambitious in attack."
" The color is a nice dark amber. The alochol content is pretty high but their is no harsh alcohol taste. It is sweet, but not to sweet. There is a little chocolate taste but not to much. It is has a medium body and is quite drinkable."
"Big disappointment here. Not recommended."
"Taste is very fruity/chewy without being overly thick or sweet. It strikes a nice balance between the malt and fruit. Hops are nowhere to be found in this beer. Not too shabby. Good brew for over the cold months. Could definitely see eating some good sharp cheddar with this."
"Good doppelbock that smells better, but not a convincing taster."
"The beer pours a dark brown/amber color with a nice off-white head that later fades and laces. The aroma is malty with the smell of roasted malts and nuts. The taste is also very malty. There is that warming from the elevated abv.. There is a very dark taste. This is not a weak watery ale. This beer has some character. The mouthfeel is nice, although I could use a bit more carbonation. This is a heavy bodied beer , that goes down smooth. A good drinking beer for those cold nights when you need a warmer and a good buzz."
"Maybe not your classic doppelbock in body but the flavor more than makes up for it...enjoyable...if I had access to this in my neck of the woods 12-to-24 of these would be in Zap's belly every winter/spring..."
"Notes: I have had better double bocks but this one did me just fine. Its worth a try that is for sure  the chocolates played nice with the malt flavours as well."
"Overall I had no trouble drinking this quickly...then I noted the 8.5%...mmmm...pour me another"
"This beer has received some mixed reviews, which should be your first tip-off that something beyond the ordinary is going on here. I could criticize this beer for lacking some of the spicy, zesty hops that most German doppels posess. Also the mouthfeel is crisp, clean and refreshing, instead of sticky and cloying like most German dopps. Furthermore, the flavor is roasty and alive, instead of being the sweet, caramelized, austere, wood-varnish, difficult-to-finish, cloy-fest that many other doppelbocks are. Maybe I'm being harsh on the style in general, but this is a damn good beer! Forget style connotations, do yourself a favor, and enjoy. There's a maple-syrup/brown-sugar forest vibe oozing from the brew (makes sense since this brew comes from the coniferous northern climes of this fair land), and the yeast is magnificent: alive, fruity, robust, healthful. Anyway I should just say, simply: I really like this beer. Any extraneous exuberance or verbiage can be attributed solely to the 8.5%"
"As I said, not my style but nice......ABV at 8.5 scares me.....but just a little."
"Crisp start with a blast of cherry fruitiness. It quickly dries out to a more roasty flavor and has a bit of alcohol in the mix. The aftertaste is like toasted pumpernickel with hints of rye and alcohol. A dry cherry lifesaver flavor lingers behind on the palate and really comes in at the end. A very interesting brew here, and it excites me to have some more from Wagner Valley."
"474"
"Thanks go out to Davo for my first sampling of Wagner Brewing."
"Pours a very dark, reddish-brown with a thin head. Nutty, almond-like, caramel aroma. Although the smell is very good, it's not nearly as intense as a great dopplebock. The beer has medium malt-sweetness. Creamy, full mouthfeel, with slight carbonation. The beer is drinkable and enjoyable, but not an outstanding example of the style."
"The head was small and color was a bit like dark cider and cloudy in appearence. It had a very malty nose and smell of dried dark fruits. The taste was good and sweet with mainly swet caramel and white chocolate accents . The mouthfeel was some what syrupy with little carbonation coming off tap. Over all this was a bit too sweet and syrupy missing some of the true doppelbock charateristics but a good beer none the less if you like sweet. I do."
"Murky brown color with a plummy aroma. Malty caramel, with a candy sugar character. Fruity, and quite bright, overall this seemed to have some Belgian aspects, along the lines of a dark strong. My favorite from this brewery."
"Clear russett brown with a short creamy light-tan head that holds fairly well and leaves some minor lace. The aroma clearly exhibits some alcohol and fruity toasted malts (Vienna?). The body is medium/full with a mild and very fine carbonation that leaves it quite smooth and creamy in the mouth. Nice! The flavor carries out what the aroma threatened with a boldly fruity (raisin, plum) character right up front, some toffee and light creamy chocolate mixed with brandy as it warms, and a drying alcohol finish with lingering sweet malty notes throughout the mouth. Definitely a beer to be savored! Though the alcohol is a little distracting, it's also somewhat unique and fairly enjoyable. Worth trying."
"Then the kids needed tending to, and in the subsequent maelstrom of flying toy Thomas the Tank Engines and associated track the beer sat and warmed up a bit to around 60 degrees. The brew really blossomed - on top of the above, a spicy hop flavor made its way out of the glass and balanced things out wonderfully. Definitely a beer to sip over a longer period, or to serve at a somewhat warmer temperature, as that seems to bring out the most in it."
"The ""Best of NY"" in April 2002 at TAP NY. Every attribute is solid across the board with this fine brew. Rich chocolatey/amber color. Great balance of sweetness, roasted malt and hops. Had it fresh on tap at the brewery, which btw, is a cool place with a view on their deck overlooking Seneca Lake that rivals even that of Andechs. I recommend a visit to anyone in the upstate NY area. Outstanding doppelbock. 8.5% abv."
"Little carbonation, smooth, slight hop finish."
