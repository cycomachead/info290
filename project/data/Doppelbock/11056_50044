If what i described above is reminiscent of the type, then it is an excellent example. I will likely try it again after comparing other doppelbock.","iRikal","Sep 24, 2014"

4.15,-0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a dark brown with some burgundy highlights, and some darker reds around the edges when held to the light. Big fluffy tan head initially, but fades to almost nothing, and leaves behind an extremely thin collar. Nose has some dried fruits, sweet malt characteristics, and some earthy and woody notes - almost akin to a softer version of what I remember picking up in their Altbier. Taste continues these sweet woody and earthy notes, with some candied flavours in there as well. Big, sweet and malty - fairly appropriate and standard from what I've seen in the style. Some spicy wood comes through in the finish, with touches of caramel and alcohol. Full mouthfeel, and low carbonation. A unique take on the style I think, and something I'd easily recommend.","liamt07","Sep 16, 2011"

Otherwise, to be honest, it was a bit hard for me to think that this beer was really going to be a DoppelBock when it was coming out of a caged bottle with the words "Grand Cuvee" on top of the label. I thought for sure that this was going to be a "Bock" that uses a Belgian yeast as a lot of them are doing. That was not the case here...this REALLY IS a DoppelBock. It is just packaged a little weird for the style, but I am sure that you can get over that like I did. It isn't Weihenstephaner Korbinian, but it is no chump either.

Hints of figs, taffy, chalky yeast, brown bread and molasses cookies in the aroma. Big malty mess slams the palate, but a good mess ... some chaos can be a positive thing. Toasted and sweet, almost roasted, with undertones of coffee and cocoa. Ripe fruit and a warming alcohol are noticeable, but on the side. Modest hopping in a toasty, sweet finish.

Quite sweet, so would make for a perfect dessert beer, but can be easily enjoyed on any occasion.","andrenaline","Aug 08, 2010"

4.33,3.6,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Pours a dark reddish-brown with thick white head. Very beautiful. Smell is quite malty, of grain and some raisin/plum too. Flavour has a bit more of hop bitterness to it than the smell led on, but with rich malts to go with it. It is very creamy, great mouthfeel. One of the best (although I can't think of any that is better) dopplebocks I've had.","kwjd","Jul 30, 2010"
4.5,7.7,4,4,5,4,4.5,"'09 vintage poured into a Chimay goblet, the beer pours a beautiful brown/red with almost no head retention. At first the carbonation was too high to really notice some of the depth of flavors but as the beer settled it was on! The fruit flavors are big and bright(cherries & fig) with a nice malt backbone. This is by far the best Doppelbock I've had and I highly recommend it.","ELDAVIS69","Jul 21, 2010"
4.07,-2.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Carbonation was definitely a distraction but the beer became a lot more enjoyable over time when it dropped out a bit.","Viggo","Jul 11, 2010"

4.23,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Body is medium sized, but it is pretty big and sticky feeling. Alcohol is there as it is warming. Certainly worth a try for the style and one that I would think will age quite nicely.","Bung","May 29, 2010"
4.1,-1.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Really outstanding. Poured with a huge tan thick foamy frothy head that slowly settles down and some lace. Color is a clear (?) very dark cherry wood. Aroma is excellent with roast malt licorice pipe tobacco caramel rye. Flavor is like aroma plus even more: cocoa nutmeats. I like the sweetness of it pretty much as that's according to style; however, it is perhaps just a tad too sweet. Body is superb and so is carbonation just according to style. Finish is like flavor and again perhaps a tad sweet, but still great. Proly not session.","drpimento","May 24, 2010"

4.18,0,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Caged and corked bomber, $11.99 @ DeCicco's In Arsley, NY. Let me get this straight, German style beer, in a Belgian style bottle, brewed in Canada...interesting... Pours a very dark shade of brown under a quite puffy dark tan head, mid level retention then a moderate collar, tiny bubble film, spaced out light lace. The nose is full of caramel malts, and light chocolate. Malts o'plenty, caramel, dark bread, chocolate malted, good depth of flavors, complexity and malty goodness. Alcohol present but in the background. Well done, highly enjoyable brew.","Billolick","Mar 15, 2010"
4.25,1.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle poured into a massive 2l dipple mug. Pours a deep chestnut brown with a huge fluffy tan head that slowly slowly dissipates into a rocky cap. Not sure if it is the pure volumn of beer I just poured but the head retention is awesome. The aroma is big and boozy, meaty, spot on dopplebock aroma. Big raisin and prune with a meaty soy. Quite meaty and boozy in the taste. Alcohol soaked charred beef, if there was such a thing, raisins and prunes, carob and enough of a roasted malt to keep the others in check. This is a big heavy dopplebock. The aftertaste is good, nice and woodsy with hints of chocolate. The feel is moderate to full but not chewy, nice tingly carbonation helps cut through the malt. ABV is noticable, you know it is there. A French Canadian German style brew. Well they did a great job. Authentic flavors, big and bold like a dopplebock should be along with a nice roasty malt body.","Gmann","Mar 12, 2010"
4.25,1.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Taste is exceptional with chocolate, malts and molasses or syrup. This is a complex beer. There is also some spice and hops with roasted malts and a hint of smokiness. This beer could pass as a sweet stout. That may be the only drawback. It is a little sweet, but that makes it appealing as you drink it. The mouth feel contains some nice bite and it is very smooth as you drink it. This is a desert beer due to it's richness. I should have invited someone over. Drinking this bottle by myself will be fun but I will be full!! It is also quite strong ABV for the style, but I could not tell it by the taste; just the after effect. I can't wait to try some other beers from this brewery, it appears they really know what they are doing. Beer this nice is hard to come by.","daledeee","Feb 27, 2010"

4.02,-3.8,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"So a third of a bottle was about right for me. While good, I don't think I'd want a whole 750 ml of it at one time. Especially at 9.5% alcohol.","MAB","Oct 20, 2009"

3.9,-6.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"My overall impression is that this is my third beer from this brewery and I keep on being impressed by them. As for the beer itself, it's great but may be just a tad too bold and rich for its own good. Or mine. I'm completely looped man.","MeisterBurger","Sep 24, 2009"
4.2,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A pleasantly up-sized doppelbock, the booze quite nicely integrated, making this all seem like a big ol' slice of sozzled German chocolate cake. Given that the intensity here, when compared to this style's typical component flavours, seems so heightened, perhaps the "Grand Cuvee" naming scheme should be amended with an "Imperial" designation, along the lines of some this brewery's other more jacked-up offerings.","biboergosum","Sep 09, 2009"
4.05,-3.1,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"D- Overall, thus is a pretty solid dopplebock that is definitely worth picking up. Recommended!","cjgator3","Aug 27, 2009"
2.98,-28.7,3,2.5,2.5,4,4,"$10 corked 750ml bottle. Pours a clear, dark, brown color with a large-bubbled, very slight, and quickly-disappearing head. The aroma is sweet-ish dark malts, but not the good German toffee-like goodness I love. The flavor is sweet dark malts up front, then turning into a lingering roastiness. Carbonation is low, and the mouthfeel is quite thick. This brew tastes like a fairly sweet, dark, strong lager (ale?) which has been blended with a roasty porter or stout. If you want to call this a doppelbock, then it's definitely a New World idea of a d-bock and nowhere close to an authentic d-bock from the Old Country. Still I think it's a good, strong, dark, "beer". For what it's worth, I found this brew to be quite drinkable when paired/contrasted with some buttermilk blue cheese! On its own, I'm not sure if I would have finished the bottle.","ohmybock","Aug 23, 2009"
4.42,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. I tend to find myself being rather critical of doppelbocks, even though I continue to consider them a favourite style. That said, this big brew was done exceptionally well, full of flavour and wonderfully balanced. I'm quite happy to have tried it and certainly recommend that others give it a shot, as well.","Proteus93","Aug 16, 2009"
4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"An all round decent offering, I'd rate the drinkability higher but after a while this doppelbock does tend to become cloyingly sweet and the alcohol presence does start to become somewhat boozy, making a bottle this size a prime candidate to share rather than allowing it to over stay its welcome. Or rather it's not unwelcome, but does become a bit overwhelming after a while.","IronDjinn","Jun 20, 2009"
4.35,4.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"While I think this is a great beer, I think it's too intense to drink often. I can foresee having trouble with finishing this 750ml on my own, the alcohol is pretty strong. This is not the smoothest beer I've ever had but I'm enjoying this new style.","eat","Jun 18, 2009"

4.33,3.6,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Overall impression: Tastes to me almost like an imperial stout that's been lagered. Also reminds me in some ways of an eisbock albeit less vinuous and more carbonated and roasty. This is definitely not your standard doppelbock. It's the third beer I've tried from this brewery and they are impressing me more and more. All in all - this beer kicks ass and I want more.","imperialstout27","Jun 08, 2009"
