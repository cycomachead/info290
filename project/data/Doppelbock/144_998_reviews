"Continuing being underwhelmed with Sprecher beer, I had this one. Maybe it is just that nothing stood out. Maybe I was just in a weird headspace (my dog had just eaten my sofa), or maybe the beer just wasn't anything special. This beer again, was okay. It hit the low standard I have for craft beer. Is it a macro? no? then it's okay. I'll drink it."

"This pours a medium brown color with not too much of a head. The aroma is very malty. The flavor is very well balanced with a delicious toasted, malt flavor and a bit of carbonation to give it some volume. Probably one of the better seasonal offerings from Sprecher's. Overall very nicely made."

"OVERALL: A nice malty bock from Sprecher. I could easily drink mass quantities of this. Good flavor!"

"Overall: just a repeat of the nose and taste comments. Good not great."

"Medium to medium-heavy body with fairly modest carbonation, creating a smooth, but slightly stagnant mouthfeel. Finish is semi-dry and slightly sticky."
""
""
"Overall a different take on the style with an assertive bit of smoke and hop bitterness. I like it."

" ~ The more i drink the better it gets. Try it by a fire in cold weather for a nice winter treat."
"O: Not bad, but really a pity that the flavor couldn't live up to the smell. Still, worth a try."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a single-finger off-white head that fades quickly into a fairly-thick collar. The nose has a bit of caramel and dark fruits along with some bread and a fair amount of sweetness. The flavor is pretty sweet without much else accompanying that aspect. There's some dark caramel and brown sugar plus a bit of fruit. Medium body with a slight alcohol burn in the finish. Decent example of the style."
"drained last night with Marquette's final four hopes. Solid offering from Sprecher who specializes in German style offerings. Toasty caramal malts with a nice balance long finish and quite smooth drinking ability. Very nice beer and one that I would seek out again in Milwauke or Philly."
"Mouthfeel is of medium bodied, sweet, raisiny, and lingering."
"Sprecher makes good beer at a good price, plus it's more local to my hometown of Chicago than beer from California or Europe. Less shipping equals less fuel used and the savings are passed onto me, the consumer. Not great, but pretty damn good."
"I have had several great Sprecher beers (most notable the Russion Imperial Stout and Black Bavarian) but this won't find its way back into our house."
"D - I've had it before and been more pleased. Maybe it was the batch, and maybe the ""small batch"" difference is why I can't write more to its praise. Still, I ain't dumping it down the drain (not that I would any beer). Actually, after a glass, it seems a little more satisfying - just not quite."
"Drinkability suffers a little from the noticeable alcohol and from the slightly excessive bitterness on the backend. Not that it's not drinkable, but it's definitely not something I'd go for more than one of at a sitting."
"Thanks to BeerFMAndy for this extra!"
"Decent beer. Probably my favorite of the style so far, and I will admit, this is not one of my favorite styles in general. Recommend."
"D - Tasty brew! Would definitely buy again. Don't know if I would want to drink more than one in a session, but very enjoyable"
"Although a lot of the Bock and Dopplebock beers taste the same to me, this is the time of the year to have them as the days are milder and the nights are cool. This beer fits the season well since it's dark, strong, but not heavy and warming like other dark styles are. While nothing in particular stands out about this, it's worth finding if this style is up your alley!"
"D: Good."
"(D)- A solid Dopplebock that is perhaps one of my seasonal favorites from Sprecher. A good drinker for a style that I usually dont typically find very drinkable. Definitely one I will always look forward to each Fall!"
"After getting it home, I let it be for about 24 hours then cracked it open and poured into an Imperial pint glass. Still had good carbonation and produced a nice foamy half-inch head. Dark amber in color, very malty. Very high alcohol content, but with a misleading sweetness...I could have finished the entire jug on my own if I hadn't reminded myself that I had a paper due the next day."
"Not a bad brew. A lot of interesting and complex flavors going on. Plently of superior brews out there but this one is worth a try."
"D-It is very drinkable I am a bock/ alt fan and would like to expierence more of them!"
"My first experience with This Doppel was at Milwaukee's Germanfest 2009. I primarily drank the Doppel also tried the Hefe Weiss and Black Bavarian. Very tasty brew, malty, great ABV (7.85%). Drinking this Doppel caused me to fall asleep very quickly once I got back to the hotel."
"Standout doppelbock."
"D-Quite possibly the best American dopplebock I have had. Not to sweet, dry finish and not lacking flavour....a great combination!"
"D - This is an easy drinking Dopplebock with a well-concealed ABV, especially for the style. Next to the Black Bavarian, this might be the best brew I've sampled from Sprecher thus far."
"D - This beer certainly has it's place but when it comes to drinkability in quantities more than one you may want to look elsewhere. Its definitely a sipper."
"16oz bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a deep reddish brown with a thin tan head. Slightly metallic aroma to start. Mostly caramel malt in the aroma along with some noble hops. Malt dominates as would be expected. Fairly rich with a long dry malty finish. Malt is a little muddled for my tastes, but that is pretty typical of an American dopple."
"D -- Scary good. Starkbierzeit ist gut, ja?"
"D- This beer is pretty drinkable considering the higher ABV. Overall, Sprecher Dopplebock is a solid beer that is definitely worth a try."
"D: Not bad."
"Cloudy amber pour, off white head. Large amount of small carbondation permeating throughout. Malty/sweet malt aroma. Lively mouthfeel. Good mix of roast and sweet malt flavor. Strong toffee/caramel, hints of raisin. Very medium bodied, with a little stickiness to it. Excellent version of the style, better than some German versions I've had."
"Very dark burgundy color, with a collar of light tan foam. Wort-like nose, with some nice malt elements of caramel and raisins, butterscotch and honey. Flavor is tremendously lacking and poorly flavored, doesn't have the intensity I would like. Not extracted well."
"D: Relatively easy to dispatch for the style."
"Sprecher Dopple Bock poured a very dark brown, even appearing black, with a fluffy nice tan white head. Smell was of brown sugar and chocolate. Taste was excellent. Chocolate and sweet dark malt. Wasn't overly sweet though. Mouthfeel was good. A little thick but very nice. Drinkability was good. Didn't feel overly filling, but with almost 8% ABV have to be careful with this one, because it goes down really easy. Overall this is a great doppelbock. One of my favorite styles, from a brewery that is becoming one my favorites. Well done."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew, nice strong malt aroma"
"D - I'm super-impressed with this one! Maybe my enthusiasm stems partly from the fact that I haven't had a doppelbock (one of my favorite styles) in a while, but this is nevertheless a really tasty beer! This was perfect for a rainy and slightly cool day like today!"
"First beer from this brewery and got it because it was on sale, look forward to try new beers from this brewery, might drink again, recommended to try once at least"
"Note to self: visit brother more often."
"I couldnt drink more than one of these at a time since it is so sweet and raisin-y, but it was pretty tasty nonetheless."
"A little too thin for my liking but damn, if I don't love the flavor. For my money Sprecher and their brothers at Capital are churning out the best German beer outside of the Rheinland."
"D: Overall, I think it's a really good beer, the taste makes up for some of its flaws, easy to drink, I'd like to delve more into this one."
"drinkability is good. the high alcohol makes this one a good warming winter brew, but may shy some drinkers away. all in all, this is a solid doppelbock, on the upper half of the bell curve. another solid brew from Sprecher. cheers!"
"drinks fairly slow, would try this again closer the source, obtained from liqorama, bit I rate this a pedestrian DB at best. I do wonder if it's a bit old? No matter, DBs should hold up"
"A must try if you like the style."
"Sprecher's Dopple Bock went very nicely with a couple pieces of fudge, for future reference. The 16 oz. bottle poured well into the pint glass, a nearly black hue leaving little froth, but giving lots for the nose to contemplate--plenty of chocolate, caramel, and yeasty good tidings. The taste is rich and smooth, smoother than many dopples, in fact, and somewhat (though a little less) comparable to Sam Adams' first-rate Double Bock. I also get a nice hint of berry. Decent carbonation deprives this of what would be a better mouthfeel, but this is a terrific beer, a great dopplebock with sweets on a very cold Midwestern day. Cheers!"
"I think this style gets extra points and there is a narrow range on the main suppliers of it, not always deserved. Yes, this particular beer was roasted and gave off a roasted and licorice aroma, and was black and in fact smooth mouthfeel. But it was fairly ordinary and certainly a bomber was too much. I have enjoyed this style produced by others."
"Drinkability: Remarkably tasty. So good, the police got involved."
"The taste was very nice, real smooth and chocolatey. Not a lot of complexity there but very nice. It had a medium-heavy body for a lager and the carbonation enhanced that a bit as well. Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"Nice beer. I gotta start hitting up friends more often to bring back new beers when they travel."
"Poured this one out of the bomber that has thick brown wax(like) sealing the top, which made it hard to even get it open. But when open finally, pured with a rich, brown, bubbly head that lingers. Matly nose with some of the 8% alcohol showing up, and a bit of spice, like anise--fairly sharp. Creamy chocolate taste and extremely smooth, the kind of smooth that I imagine got people to switch to lagers from ale once upon a time. But, in spite of the exceptional smoothness, the beer isn't light in the mouth, but very solid and full."
"Beer is good. Happy doppel beering."
"A big and hearty beer? I guess it's pretty good. Pretty hard-charging alcohol. If in the mood for doppelbock, though, I may go a different route."
"Dopple Bock may not be Sprecher's finest accomplishment (see Black Bavarian), but it's a damn fine beer in its own right. I wonder, for the millionth time, why the Wisconsin breweries don't distribute to this state when we're a mere Mississippi River's width away."
"The Sprecher Dopple Bock pours a deep copper and has very decent lacing. The smell is bright for this style and resonates of a deeper substance. Flavor is really pleasing. Cocoa hints as well as coffee with a slightly nutty finish. This beer strikes a unique balance of interest and style. One of Sprecher's best."
"D - A little too sweet and lackluster to be really enjoyable."
"Rich creamy mouthfeel with a tinge of alcohol and ripe fig/plum characteristics. Very smooth and satisfying, with a warming sensation as the temperature rises. Another winner from Sprecher. Not the most complex of beers, but an excellent representation of the style."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a small light beige head that disappears quickly. Aroma is of sweet malt and fruit. Thick, rich & sweet malty taste along with some molasses and caramel flavors. A hint of alcohol taste is also present. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but the body is much lighter than other doppelbocks I've had. A warming alcohol bite is noticeable as it goes down."
" This one is worth finding. Don't be put off by the weak nose, the taste more than makes up fo it."
"Drinkability: Not a bad doppelbock, with good sweet malts and toffee profiles. But the imbalance with the booze and odd thinness leave this a little harder to drink than other doppelbocks. However, the woman I spoke to from Sprecher said that the brewer was working on the recipe, so this is a beer I'll return to. This is definitely one to try, though it doesn't stand up to German or other Wisconsin doppels."
"D- This beer has some nice features but they are balanced by just as many off-flavors."
"Drink: Nice and easy. Not too thick, but loaded with flavour. I like."
"Deep crimson color with moderate carbonation showing. A bit of a nutty caramel aroma with some burn but its none of the flavors are too prominent in the smell. Taste is loaded with malts and rich deep dark malts at that. Lots of plummyness here. Quite figgy with toffee undertones. A shot of some liquer thrown in. The initial roastiness subsides to a creamy feel at the top. The finish comes back with some roasty and spicy notes but the maltiness is always there. Intriguing, tasty, quite good. Those Wisconsin brewers can sure brew their lagers right."
"Pours a deep dark blackish ruby with a decent white head, shrinking to a thin film, with lacing in thick sheets cascading down, strings catching on the glass here and there. Aroma is slighly sweet toffee on top of heavy malt base, some toffee and caramel hints. Taste is heavily malty, nice hints of toffee and even brown sugar. Can slightly get alcohol hints, in both taste and aroma, nice. This is one of those beers that is just good, all around, no weaknesses, but no real strong points."
"Mouthfeel- What a nice blend of dark and sweet and bitter and sweet. Definetly an American interpretation of the German dopplebock. But very well done I must say."
"Pours out a Dark, dense brown with a good off-white head leaving great lacing. Great malty aromas with hints of caramel. Big but balanced mouthfeel with a hint of sourness of dark fruits. As it warms, it gives off even more spiciness. One of the finest Dopple bocks I've tasted."
"16 ounce bottle. Pours out a dark brown color topped with a couple inches of off-white head. The aroma is sweet and somewhat roasty. A little bit of a sour smell in the background. Chewy malt flavor. Slightly metallic. Hops are there, but not too strong. Finishes spicy and fruity. Like the aroma, the flavor has a sourness lurking in the background. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. No sign of the nearly 8% abv. Pretty good drinkability. If it weren't for the sourness, this would be an excellent dopplebock."
"drinkability: 16oz is the ideal serving size"
"Deep chestnut with a thin but full tan crown. Very Belgiany. Lively flavorful yeast. Vinous in the extreme for a bock. Dark fruit front, toffee middle, and spicy/citric hop finish that improves as the beer warms. Very drinkable for a bock as well. A tad thin but still creamy enough to be enjoyable."
"Medium bodied, still a fairly rich brew. At $1.70 for a pint bottle, it wont break the bank."
"Drinkability and Notes  This is a solid beer with good drinkability. However there is a lot of room for improvement, the appearance and mouthfeel could use some work as well as some added complexity and power in the aroma and taste. Still one of the better American Doppelbocks I have had, and a pretty good deal for the price. This was particularly disappointing after being really impressed by Sprecher's Black Bavarian."
"Pours a hazy bright dark amber-brown with a decent foamy lasting off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Has a sweet fruity and bready aroma. Sweet and malty fruity and caramel flavors, medium body with a slick and smooth mouthfeel, finishes sweet, alcohol well hidden, very nice."
"I continue to be surprised by this brewery, maybe because I bought a mixed four-pack for $2.95, but this stuff is great! Surprisingly authentic tasting. Pours a deep dark brown with some crimson shining through, and a white creamy head. I love the milky creamy tastes and smells coming from this beer. There's also a decent amount of complexity in the taste. First of all, it's a malt explosion. Soft and sweet for the most part, but a bit of bitter coffee been rounding out the finish. There's a nice almost merlot character to this beer which I'm finding quite nice. A great dopplebock from a great brewery."
"Pours a dark crimson ruby color, with large tan head. The carbonation slowly fades away. Smells of caramel and roasty, definitely sweet and fruity. Taste is sweet and resinous, but not thick. Dark fruits and caramel dominate the taste with some residual bitterness at the end, but not much. A little bit of the yeast profile shows towards the end. mouthfeel is not thick, but not too thin, on target for the style. Very drinkable, one of sprechers better brews and a top notch Dbock"
"Cloudy medium brown boasts a lasting off-white head. Excitingly vinous aroma full on the currants and blackberries jam flavors. Sweet Iced tea like caramelic malt comprises a generous roasted raisin bread overtone. Nutty with more roasted candies and pumpernickel complexities all while deploying a savant fruit knowledge. Fitting lagerish body with moderate carbonation may not carry it to excellence, but doesnt affect negatively either. Remarkable take on the style mostly due to its unique deep roastiness."
"A surprise of a dopple for sure, this beer poured out very dark with a small amount of head. I couldn't decipher the bottled on dates of these bottles, but I will guess they are over a year+ old, but i didn't notice any ill affects because of that fact. The taste was very malty, but not with the syrupy brown sugar flavors that many young dopples have. A dryer, more porter -like flavor with increased acidity and coffee flavors. Alcohol is very present. Mouthfeel is right on, and I proved to myself that the drinkability is very high."
"This is one of my favoirte offerings from this brewery. Get it if you can find it!"
"As I have said before, Sprecher doesn't have the ability to knock your socks off, but they are truly one of the greatest, low-priced, breweries in the country. This seasonal dopplebock was decent overall, but didn't have the normalities that I look for in a dopple bock. It seemed a little too dark for this style. It was remnant of a porter in both appearance and taste. The was a nutty, roasted presence that seemed a little off-balance, but the finish was very nice and malty. A great seasonal that is definately worth a try!"
"The beer pours a chestnut hue with garnet tints and develops a light beige head that fades quickly to an edge layer. Mild toffee aroma and some general fruitiness mixed in berries and pears I think. First sip reveals a small yet prickly carbonation and average body. The flavor is sweet and sugary up front with toffee and brown sugar dominant, some ripe fruit as well. The finish is rather dry and allows some hints of vanilla. There is a bit of a sweet coating on my tongue after the swallow almost a syrupy feel to it. Overall a very nice brew and easy to drink. Wish I had bought more than one bottle!"
"The carbonation was quite bitey up front, medium-bodied throughout w/ a nice sweet alcohol burn at the end. Drinkability was pretty decent...not my favorite dopplebock by any means, but a nice find as well."
"Sprecher beer has always been available at the airport in Milwaukee, and has been there to keep me company in flight delays. I was very happy when this beer became available here in MA. This dopplebock has a deep brown color with a medium tan head , not too much lace. A candy, malty aroma from the roasted malt dominates the nose. A thick, rich malty taste with a light alcohol back. No hops to be found in the flavor. Heavy mouth feel with a great drinkability. Many dopples are dominated by alcohol, this one really puts the malt forward. Nice beer."
"Drinkability: a little light for my liking giving this beer questionable drinkability considering the style. a good beer but not a Paulaner Salvator either. overall, nice complexity and balance."
"Brown-burgandy, fairly clear. Not much in the way of head; what's there certainly fades quickly. Caramel and sweet, wet malts. Deep down there's an almost fruity sensation that reminds me of a squished fig newton. Smacks of roasted bitterness in the middle through the end. Somehow remains ""light"" and drinkable. Stays very smooth even through the hop bitterness; never gets astringent, something I've found common in some bock and dopplebock beers that are trying too hard for balance. Just a trickling of prune juice across the tongue washed away by more dominant ""pure"" malt flavors. Quite a nice doppelbock."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2 inch tall beige head. Would like a bit longer head retention time, but for a dopplebock, we'll forgive and move on. Amazingly deeply reddish brown in shade, a thing of beauty in front of the light. Heavy malt nose, with alcohol apparent. Sweet malty flavor, with undercurrent of berries or cherries, and that alcohol that was present in the nose is only found here in the warming feelings of the mouth and tummy. Exactly what I'm looking for in a dopplebock. Mouthfeel is excellent as well, and the drinkability drops down just a tad, because although I want more and more, I know it'll kick my ass later... So glad Sprecher is now getting distributed in MA!"
"Thanks to an exceptionally patient BigHuge for this one!"
"cheers to zap for letting me sample this enjoyable brew!"
"Pours with a two-finger bubbly head that goes quickly and leaves no lace. Medium carbonation. Deep ruby color. Nose is malty. Starts with a sweet molasses flavor and finishes sweet especially as it warms. Light to medium bodied. $1.95 for a 16oz bottle that was brewed on 12/18/03."
"A tart lemon/lime bitterness and over-ripe apple taste balance the malt sweetness. A bit of bourbon-like alcohol fuminess gives this brew a different angle of the Dopple Bock style. It ain't bad!"
"Sampled 2/1/04"
"698"
"Drinkabale, but maybe two at a sitting, tops."
"Big thanks to Jeffboo for the bottle!"
"Had this on tap at BW3's in Indy. Poured a deep brown with ruby red hues. Not much head but plenty of lacing on the glass. Aroma was malty sweet with a hint of fruit thrown in. Add to that a touch of the hops. Taste is oh so good. Malty sweet, but not overly so, with a little tanginess that really balances it out. However the mild carbonation and thin watery mouthfeel detracted from it slighly. All in all a very good doppel bock in my humble opinion. I can't wait to have this on tap again!"
"Deep reddish sienna color with a creamy 1/4 inch head on a hard pour. Coats the glass lightly, little lace. Malty aromas, some sense of fig and raisin. Decent mouthfeel, consistent but somewhat lighter than stickier Doppels. Very pleasant taste, slighlty buttery caramel with even some chocolate notes. Well-balamced, hops are background players but are noticeable in the light raisin tones. Overall, this strikes me as meeting style, but middle-of-the-road -- in the Salvator category with slightly more limited body. A drinkable beer for sure, though."
"Hoorah, for Sprecher, again!"
"Ruby red chestnut color with a nice deep glow, thin tannish head that sits for a good time before simmering down to a very thin haze and ring, lacing is drippy leaving sparitic spots and globs behind. Aroma is a bit like purple grape juice with a tangy sweetning sense, with touches of caramel, raisin, and alcohol with some roasty tones to it, but overall a bit to light and subdued. Taste is mildly malty with a dull sweetness of fruityness upfront that flows right into a nice roasty end that has some cocoa and burntish notes. Moderately rich and creamy feel with a solid medium body and a touch of chalkyness and restrained sweetness intermingling with roastyness in the finish. A very drinkable brew with a clean, soft smoothness and quiet roasted character."
"Time out for a cup of coffee! Typical deep chestnut color. The head fades very fast. Aromas start malty, then quickly head towards coffee. In the mouth more coffee. The alcohol comes off slightly out of balance and overwhelms the flavor and warming richness of the style. Finishes with a bitter burt sugar note and a touch of sweet malt and raisin. A bit too carbonated-almost soda like-maybe they intended it for the root beer and it got mixed up? All in all a pretty good beer despite."
"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and bready. A full-bodied bock. Deeply roasted malts, the malt flavors are really quit complex, nutty, sweet, fruity and woody. There is also a touch of bourbon like quality to this beer. Hops are very mild, only slightly bitter. Smooth taste. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"I have to say this is one of the better American doppelbocks I have had.Poured a rich dark brown color with some ruby tint,smell was sweet and caramelly with some fruity esters,taste was sweet a little earthy and caramelly.Alcohol came through as it starts to warm.I have really liked all the Sprecher beers I have tried,each time I come home I get as many Bells and Sprecher brews I can get my hands on."
"My bottle was two months past its best before date, it has held up very well. Sprecher makes a damn good doppelbock."
"Poured dark brown with ruby hues. Light tan head. Aroma primarily consisted of malt. Not much else that I noticed on the nose. Mouthfeel is smooth and full-bodied. Rich oily, roasted malt flavor with coffee-like tones. Hints of a mild fruit sweetness (raisin and plum). Finish has a mild bitterness to it. A fine example of the style from Sprecher and a very enjoyable brew."
"Sprecher's dopplebock is a solid, well-crafted brew. Pours a deep ruby color, although the head is absent, leaving no remnants behind. Smell is mainly of sweet malt, toffee, etc. Taste is similar, albeit a well-balanced blend of the malt, toffee, a touch of alcohol and a hint of fruitiness. Very smooth and a bit creamy in the mouth. A classy dopplebock, for sure, this one could be consumed often."
"Somewhat pleasing, but not overwhelming.  However, sometimes I like to be a little overwhelmed by my doppels.   Still, good stuff."
"Burgandy color. Nice frothy head. Roast Malt aroma. Sweet and roasty taste. Some stout qualities in this one. Sweet taste. High quality Dopple. I would include this one in my top tier of Dopples (with Bell's Consecrator, S.A. and Ayinger Celebrator)."
"Very dark brown/blackish...fruity on the nose with some alcohol and raisens...great brown sugar taste on the finish...very sweet, but not syruppy or oversweet..balanced...on the sweet side but not overdone...would make my top 7-10 doppels...definitely worth trying if you see it.."
