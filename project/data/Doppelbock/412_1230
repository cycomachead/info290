The nose is...beer!  We spend hours coming up with adjectives and descriptors for all sorts of brews while 28 just flat out nails it. It smells like beer, it tastes like beer- sweet, sharp, grain, and booze.  It packs of punch of alcohol that seems to carry a tiny note of every beer you've ever had.  It's plenty thick on the palate and more complex than most.  German copper totes the load, this ones a stud.","Foxybrau","Mar 14, 2015"

It can be a little pricey but worth every penny.  It has so many rich flavors.  Dark, earthy fruit notes seem to push forward the most, but this is not a sweet beer necessarily.  The flavor intensifies as it warms in the glass, and the last sip tends to be divine in my opinion.  Drink from a chalice or even wine glass for sure.  The color is a decadent rouge/ molasses.","DaveStewartBrown","Nov 02, 2014"

Finish the same as taste. Alcohol seems to be well hidden, but comes thru more as it warms up. Overall seems a bit strong for a doppelbock, not bad ( if sipped accordingly).","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

EKU 28 is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell is rich with sweetness and caramel. You pick up on some grains in this brew. Not a bad brew so far. The taste is sweet with some grains. There is a slight bitterness to this brew. but nothing over powering. I'm guess the brew get it sweetness from the high ABV. This brew goes down smooth with no bad after taste. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. Kulmbacher Brauerei AG did a nice job with this brew. This brew is nicely balance with a high high ABV. The high ABV is it is not notable in this brew, goes down smooth and clean. This brew is better than what I was expecting. I will get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jun 26, 2014"

4.04,2.5,3,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottle code 2054134. Pours crystal clear orange-copper color with a 1-2 finger off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, grape, molasses, raisin, prune, toast, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, raisin, toffee, molasses, prune, toast, grape, and light herbal spiciness. Light spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, earth, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; with no cloying sweetness at all. Fairly dry on the finish surprisingly. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is insanely well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Dangerously smooth to sip on. Overall this is an damn nice doppelbock! Nice flavor balance and complexity; and surprisingly smooth to sip on. Really enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Sep 17, 2012"

I get a bit of raisin in there. Taste is pretty spectacular. A big smack of alcohol comes straight away, followed by creamy caramel and fruity goodness and then finished with a bit of spice from the alcohol again. Surprisingly, it's not out of balance at all. And that alcohol is really nice and warming. It's a beer to be reserved for night caps and it makes for a great change of pace as such.","TheRealBigC","Aug 11, 2012"

Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, alcohol, caramel, caramel hop, and subtle fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This one was definitely on the slightly boozy side if I am honest, however there was enough other things going on here to help cover that up slightly and balance it out. The mouthfeel on this one was spot-on though and definitely helped with the drinkability.

Lacing is not left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. A wispy cap is left atop the beer after the head dissipates. The beer smells very sweet and the alcohol comes through in the aroma as well. The aroma is slightly bready. The flavor is dominated by bready sweetness from the malt and the alcohol heat does come through in the flavor. It's grainy. The body is full with little carbonation. The finish is dry. The alcohol content makes this beer a sipper, but it is an easy sipper. Overall, this is an excellent beer for the style.

That taste is incredible, a spicy alcohol punch that is muted by the sweet, caramel malt backbone. The alcohol is there, but does not overtake the flavor, which nice given the ABV, but still provides a nice warming effect. Definitely a nice beer to sip and enjoy the mixed flavors.

4.34,10.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Cellared for two years. Pours a brilliantly clear shade of tawny amber with bronze highlights. Soapy, off-white two and a half finger head showing respectable retention for a fortified beverage, but leaves no lacing. The nose is heavy with Apricot brandy, dark crystal malt, and deeply toasted notes like Special B or Aromatic malt. A background aroma of cider gets stronger as it warms, as does the faintest trace of perfumey noble hops. Immense caramel and roasted nutty flavor on the first sip; sweet isn't quite a sufficient definition. Raisin phenols and apple ester add more depth to the malt profile, while a mellow yet firm hop bitterness begins to round out the formidable sweetness. True balance is achived in the aftertaste, when a dark fruity booze character provides the slow burn that gradually dries the residual sugar. Full-chewy body with a fine carbonation that seems intentionally light to emphasize the malt complexity and thick mouthfeel. This is a sipper and not intended for hurried consumption, and it also never becomes cloying or overwhelming; the alcohol is warm but not hot and the malt is tremendous -but fades out allowing a very managable finish. Certainly worth the wait as this is simply too abrasive when young, and could perhaps benefit from another year in the cellar.","PBRstreetgang","Jun 26, 2007"

4.48,13.7,4.5,4,5,4.5,4,"Big malty/toffee aroma you pretty much only get from a true German bock brew. Very, VERY nice! Actually, there's also a strong fruitiness which you don't get all that often in a German lager. Even so, it's a ""clean"" fruitiness so you know it's still a lager. Beautiful amber color with a slight head, but one that seems to stick around. After pouring it into a glass, the appearance and aroma of this brew just make me want to immediately take a sip! Carbonation is decent and appropriate for the style, but some previous bottles have been too low. Flavor is a malt assault on the tongue combined with some heat from the alcohol. The flavor improves on the aroma with a huge malty/toffee explosion on the tongue. I get ripe fruits...perhaps some apple, but even more I'm getting some beautiful ripe pear flavors. Have you ever forked over the money to buy some Harry and David's Royal Riviera pears? They're expensive, but ohhh so good...nature's candy! Anyway, I definitely get some of that great, ripe, Oregon pear character in this brew. When I first tasted this beer ten years ago, I wasn't crazy about it. Now, it's one of my (occasional) favorites. It's not something I would drink often, but I love to keep some on hand for the times when I'm in the mood...and it seems to hold up incredibly well in my fridge for long periods of time. There's no denying EKU 28 is a malty brew...even for German standards, yet it still has a nice, clean-fermented lager taste. Even though the malt character is strong, I don't think this brew goes too far with its maltiness. Take Vetter 33 on tap in Heidelberg for comparison. Vetter 33 is too over-the-top malty, and has way too much of an unfermented malt-syrup taste. EKU 28 on the other hand, is much more drinkable and thoroughly fermented. I really enjoy this brew, but I can imagine that some don't because it's a bit extreme. EKU 28 has definitely become a brew I've come to love over the years.

Smell was very boozy and fruity...apples seem definitely there. Taste was on the malty side, with viscous honey, raisins, and more booze. This beer seems to explode when it swishes around the palate, bursting with flavor in every way. It is a bit carbonated, not not too much. While this is a drinkable beer for sure, it is also pretty strong and heavy. One or two bottles at a time seems appropriate to me. Final Thoughts: A nice beer for sure.

The nose is full of brown sugar, dark bread, and the scent of pecan pie, which may very well be the first time I've said this about a beer. Very interesting. The taste is a near-cloying, caramel and light brown sugar experience. I honestly don't think there's more to it than that, but it tastes wonderful, in very small sips. The mouth might be one of the thickest I've ever come across, with almost non-existent carbonation. But really, I can't see a ""combat"" beer like this having any bubbles to lighten the load, it just wouldn't feel right.

An affordable night cap ($10/6-pack) or a good value for the ABV alone. Not as complex as the super heavy weights, but fills a gap mssing in the 6-pack motif.

Smell is very heavy malt fruitiness with figs, gates, cherries, prunes and just about any dark fruit you can think of present. Distinct alcohol presence (as would be expected). Taste is sweet and syrupy, with a coat-the-mouth feeling. Malt completely takes over with an over-ripe dark fruit. Alcohol is there, but is well hidden, which increases the drinkability of this beer. Definitely a slow sipping beer, because as it warms, the flavors become more intense. Would make an great after dinner drink.","tgbljb","Nov 06, 2005"

Flavor is similar with a cloying sweetness that distracts from other characteristics, with notes of honey, molasses and caramel and some toasted bread, floral and mineraly hops, some oaky and vanilla flavors, some slight fruity esters and a moderate alcohol burn in the finish.

It's surprisingly drinkable given its full body and high alcohol content. And although the alcohol is noticeable, it helps to thin the malt sweetness, ultimately helping the beer more than it hinders it. Unfortunately, it does limit the head retention, and it's short cap of white quickly dissipates above its crystal-clear, orange-amber body. The nose is not particularly complex, revealing its rich maltiness and a waft of alcohol, but its flavor becomes a bit more complex as it warms with notes of vanilla and almonds as well as some floral hoppiness in addition to its concentrated Munich-malt-like graininess.

3.2,-18.8,4,4,3,3,2.5,"Really attractive orangish, reddish amber color. Not much of a head, but a thin collar hangs around. Very sweet alcoholic fruity nose. Not bad at all, just really sweet. I like it! The first sip reveals a very strong alcohol presence. A bit of a medicinal note in there as well. Alcohol warms the esophagus as you swallow. Residual sweetness is pretty high on this one. A slight hint of bitterness slips in after a few sips, but it is dissolved by the alcohol. I think this needs to age for a few years. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. This is almost like a Marzen or maibock diluted with spirits. Definitely not for the weak. Now the question is, how long will it take to finish this one? Not a bad beer, but nowhere near a session brew. You WILL know this is a high ABV offering. And you will most likely enjoy it. Slowly.","aaronh","Nov 22, 2003"

After noticing the 11% abv on the label I knew that the first sip could tell me a lot about the beer...here goes nothing...PURE ALCOHOL! Just like the label on the back of the bottle says ""treated like a fine port," this was a different taste for an Eisbock. As it warmed up I began to enjoy it much. The flavors began to come out and weaken the alcohol taste. Overall, lets just say one bottle of this will hold me over for the next couple of decades.","ALESwhatCURESya","Nov 22, 2003"

The head recedes quickly to almost nothing but a very small smattering of a lace on the surface. There is a very small amount of carbonation seen flowing from the bottom. The aroma is of rich sweet malts, lots of dark fruits (plum and raisin), a small amount of alcohol, and some notes of rum. The mouthfeel is quite thick, almost syrupy. Somewhat smooth start, but it doesnt take long for the feel of the alcohol to tear through the palate. Very warming on its way down, and doesnt take long at all to feel this one in the blood stream. Quite sweet and, at times, I felt that it was almost cloying, with notes of plum and rum raisins. The finish has a slight bitterness that picks up a bit and lingers for a moment. I definitely couldnt drink more then one of these. Its a good sipping beer though.

The full effect and flavor can be gathered from a very small sip, just as with a straight bourbon or scotch, making it a perfect beer for slowly sipping.

The flavor gets extremely close to cloying. But it never is. The thick, rich malt is the main player. I liken the richness of this beer to the richness of boiled shrimp. It's very appealing, but if you take in a lot, you're going to pay for it later. Some dulled apple tones come in here and there. There's also a little whiskey barrel oakiness to it.

Then the taste, watch it now, it says ""hi"" very quickly. You say hello back by going, ""Whew, wow, holy smokes thats strong!"" You sip again and the dark fruit and maltyness just settles with very nice tones of caramel, cherry, toffee and other fruits of ripeness lingering around in there. Super complex, inviting, subtle and strong, I'm sorry,did I already say it was strong.

It wasnt the alcohol, malt, or esters, but something else. Some sort of sourness that was unexpected I just didnt care for much. The first sip almost knocked me out of my chair. What a drink! A huge buttery malt (but I dont think diacetyl) floods the mouth and was balanced not by hops but by an alcohol/solvent burn. The tongue was left tingling for much of the moderately long salty caramel finish. Hops were minimal at best and kinda go unnoticed, by me at least!

At first I thought it was just pretty. Now that I think about it, though, this is just the color nature tends to paint things when it wants to warn people to *stay away*! Ah well, if the color doesn't get ya, the aroma will. Huge nose of alcohol, which mellows a bit to an aroma of rum soaked raisins with lots of sweet caramel malt underlying. The third warning is the lack of any evident head -- you can just see the carbonation struggling to make its way up through the massive levels of alcohol in this beer. Ok. Time to take the first sip. I absolutely could not believe how creamy and smooth it is! The caramel and alcohol combine together to produce something not entirely unlike a rather nutmeggy, spicy dark cola. Dr. Pepper for grown-ups. Alcohol and malt dominate the main body as well, with some nice fruity, orange-like esters developing. Then the beer finishes off with a nice combination of peppery spiciness and understated hop bitterness. Finish is sweet, but just barely. Not nearly as cloying as it could have been. This beer handles its alchol *very* well, and provided it is shown the proper respect, is quite a nice bed-time beer.","mzwolinski","Dec 08, 2002"

Sparse bubbles rise slowly through the apparently viscous brew.  Sugar coated nuts and caramelized sweetness upfront in aroma, toasty malt and fruity melanoidins follow and grow progressively more intense as the brew breathes and warms.  Smells like a ballsy hellesbock, with alcohol notes milder that the strength would indicate.  Although the flavor profile is assertively sweet overall, it is not one dimensionally so.  Rich, non - diacetyl buttery malt is the foundation for toasty, nutty and perhaps decocted Munich malt, which complement crystal and residual sweetness to lend a toffeeish character.  Mellow, yet bright fruitiness combine with the sweetness to form a red licorice note.  The body is deceivingly light while the mouthfeel is viscous and a bit syrupy, yet not cloying.  Hop bitterness is virtually absent.  Finishes expectedly sweet; brown sugar like sweetness coats the tongue.  EKU 28 struck me as cloyingly sweet at first, but it became increasingly complex as it breathed.  It's a fine dessert beer that would pair well with simply rich vanilla or coffee ice cream.","marc77","Sep 12, 2002"
