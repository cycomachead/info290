"I prefer darker beers and sweeter beers, so perhaps my pallette gives this brew a little more creedence than others, but if you come across it worth a try for sure, and if you don't like it (comes in a six pack) send me the other five!"

"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Extremely drinkable, I didn't expect the abv to be above 6%. Nice malty taste nothing overwhelming, medium body, slightly oily mouthfeel. Smells slightly alcoholy."

"Very drinkable, with dark chocolate notes."

"Pours a clear brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with and almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but nothing too exciting."

"Overall - The best way to describe this drink is like a Mona Vie. It is not a drink for everyone, and many might find it down right disgusting at first, but after a few you will find yourself craving one every now and then. My recommendation is to try some other drinks first, but if you elect to buy a case, make sure you have more than just one. This beer takes some sophistication (possibly more than I currently have.)"
"* I did not read the previous review beforehand, but this is the most obvious quality of this beer."

"O: Unimpressive Bock that has tons of potential. Firstly, you'd never guess that Lobotomy is 10.8%. It tastes like a 4-5% brew--although I guess this is a plus for some. Mouth-feel and taste are forgetful. Lobotomy is too filtered and restrained for its own good. If I had to describe this brew in one word it would be ""withdrawn"". It has a lot less personality than I was expecting and I predict it will speak to very few individuals."
"Wouldn't buy again"

"It's almost hard for me to believe this is a 10.5 ABV beer.... At first, the pour into the glass seems to nice.... That is, until you realize there isn't much head or body to it.... Though it's a dark beer, it doesn't have that deep of a taste to it.... Pretty bland characteristics.... I tried the Indian Wells ""Insomnia IPA", and again, I wasn't too impressed with it's lack of hoppiness.... I'm still waiting to find a beer from this brewery that I fully enjoy."
""
"I like the lobotomy bock, not to harsh, smooth, taste great! I found this at Central Market HEB in San Antonio, Tx. I was looking for Lobo Bock which is a Texas double bock but they are still a small brewery so when I came across this I was continent and have been on the lobotomy kick since!"

"Cheers!"

"When I drank this, I thought it was supposed to be a regular (not doppel) bock, and quickly determined that it could not fit that category. Any claim that this is supposed to be a doppelbock is incredible. That said, this is enjoyable enough to drink and warrant somewhat decent ratings from me. If I were to score this strictly as a doppelbock, the score would be far lower, but that is not my way, and I only factor the style in as one element."

"Body is weak for a stout but thick for a bock. No idea what style they were shooting for here, but they got a real mixup on their hands. "
""
"O: This is pretty awful stuff. Drinkable yes, but I’d rather just drink a soda."
"T: deep flavour to chocolate, altough is a little crispy on tongue, the alcohol presence is not noticed at all, medium body, strange taste for a doppelbock"
""
""
""
"Overall, I was happy to try this but glad I had just a few bottles. It's strange and not really up to doppelbock snuff for me."
""
"Never been a fan of this brewery, this just isn't my kind of style of beer, but even stuff I like, these guys haven't been able to fit it in an appreciable way for my palate."

"Overall not a bad beer. Like many others on here I don't think I could drink this alone all night, (and with so many fine brews out there who would?) but I would definately drink the whole bottle."
"The first thing I noticed about this beer is how extremely dark it is. This beer is darker than most stouts. When poured into a glass, I noticed an excess of head and lace. The beer's aroma is of charcoal and burnt malt. The taste of charcoal and malt are a bit overpowering and actually degrade from the overall taste of this beer. I wanted to like this beer, but I am a bit underwhelmed to be honest."
"Overall, just an average beer. The brewmaster needs to realize that making beer that taste like a bad homebrew doesn't belong on the market."
"Overall, very average. I don't think I'll have another."
"Kinda a weird little taste to this beer but that not necessarily a bad thing, I kinda liked it for a one shot type drink, can't say I'd like to drink a six pack in one sitting."
"Overall - I don't really love the bitter/chocolaty/roasted part of this taste, but I do like that it blends itself pretty well."
"No thanks, I'm over this."
"My first Indian Wells experience wasn't a true horror story like I've heard. This one is just overly sweet and strong on the raisin."
"For such a strong beer (Nearly 11%abv), it's alcohol is hidden quite well...very easy to drink, just not sure if I really want to have another."
"If anything, the abv is well-hidden in this beer, making for an easy drinker."
"D: Do not want this one again."
"This was first brought to me by some family members in Ridgecrest, Ca who came to visit me. I visited the brewery when i went to visit them for a camping trip. I was amazed at how smooth it was for a bock. I didnt get a bitter after taste like with some. This one hit me with almost a smokey wood flavor that i loved. Since i was camping while drinking it, it was perfect. I recommend this beer for a nice camping trip or backyard BBQ."
"It's a big malty doppelbock for sure with just enough hop bitterness to give it a crisp finish."
"After later having the opportunity to visit the Brewery and try the other beers they had to offer, I would have to say that the Lobotomy Bock is one of the top beers currently being produced from Indian Wells Brewing Company. Overall, with the limited breweries in this area, I would absolutely drink this beer again."
"Has kind of a burning plastic chemical taste to it that is wholly unpleasant. The malts are deeply roasty and not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be. Alcohol is surprisingly well hidden. Body is not thin, but not really all that full for a rich doppel. Overall depth and flavor is just a bit lacking. Not as bad overall as I was expecting, I'll easily be able to finish this bottle with nary a cringe to be found."
"The body is on the light side, lots of carbonation. Not much feel, except for a chalky finish. Only decent marks here, is how easy it is to drink. Give a couple to your friend who doesn't like beer with a whole lot of flavor and watch him get bombed in no time."
"The mouthfeel is good, smooth and creamy buy not thick like a porter or stout. It goes down real easy which is dangerous because of it's alcohol content. I get none of that abv at all, this is definitely my favorite brew from indian wells, at least of the ones I have tried so far."
"That's two from these guys, and I'm unfortunately quite disappointed."
"The most drinkable beer from Indian Wells I've tried so far; in the greater world, a mediocre example of the style, But for IW, a triumph!"
"For the first time in my life I actually left 3 bottles of beer in the fridge! I purchased this at a Whole Foods while on vacation in San Diego from my native Wisconsin and would like to save fellow beer lovers my cruel fate. Next time I'll check out Beer Advocate BEFORE I buy!"
"Poured the first one of these down the drain. Actually looked for the receipt to return the other five. Couldn't find the receipt so kept in fridge to be drunk in emergencies. God this is awful beer."
"Pouring dark with a finger or two of tan head that dissipated so quickly I wondered if there was really any head at all. Very mild malt aroma, upon first sip I was astonished how well they managed to mask the heavy alcohol content reported on the package. However, by the time I was halfway through this brew, it became abundantly clear that the advertised ABV is an outright lie - that is, unless these folks at Indian Wells managed to include some magical substance that counteracts the inebriation otherwise incurred by consuming alcohol! Very light body, lively albeit watery mouthfeel with a slightly sour flavor. Glad I got this one on sale."
"My recommendation would be to keep moving on if this beer looks interesting at the store, you can find a better beer."
"This doppelbock seems to have been brewed in the light bodied American lager tradition. It's a bit of a different take on the style. It would be a good choice in hot weather."
"This is the same beer as Fireman's Brew Brewnette. They are both made in Indian Wells, both claim the same 10.8 percent abv, and both beer reviews have the same claim that no hint of the alcohol is present. I wonder if that's because it's not there. I've drunk down 2 in less than 30 minutes and felt no residual effect. That's the equivalent of kicking me into above .08 bac and not feeling it. With all that said, it's vaguely enjoyable, finished dry and cocoa-ish."
"Overall no. This one was not working at all. I was hoping for something more, but did not get it."
"Oh, the review. I suspect from the dishwatery taste that the beer was infected and the residual malt fermented from the bacteria. But I can't explain why the alcohol would evaporate. The flavor that is left is unpleasant though not sour."
"Taste: Quite smooth and easy to drink. Almost too easy with the flavors very muted overall. Not as sweet as one would expect from the nose, its quite wine and grape juice like in a bad way up front. The middle is mellow with brown sugar notes and a hint of ripe fruit. Oddly, there isn't even a sign of the 10% ABV even in the absence of flavor. I guess it's a lager and the ""clean"" flavor is perhaps desirable...however I personally don't find it so. Finish is balanced. Some brown sugar / fruit syrup sweetness but is lackluster. Definitely needs to warm up to let the flavors out."
"This is really not very drinkable at all. Drain pour in the end - didn't feel like wasting my sobriety on a shitty beer that's almost 11% ABV. I can't believe this is rated overall as an above-average doppelbock. I really don't want to know what a below-average one is."
"Pours dark brown, almost cola color. Tan head. Light smoke is noted on the nose, with some caramel as well. On the palate the caramel is present again with a brownbread flavor that comes through. Medium bodied and does not seem to be anywhere near 10.5% as indicated on the bottle. Relatively easy drinking, but disappointing for a doppelbock."
"D. The beer masks it high ABV content easily. Not my favorite Doppelbock, but a decent option that is very drinkable and affordable."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears a clear, but dark chestnut brown color with a finger of fizzy light tan foam. The head dissipates within a minute. Nose and flavors consist of sweet caramel malts, a touch of cheap milk chocolate, alcohol, dark cherry skins, raisins. Thin body with decent carbonation. Leaves something to be desired."
"D- If this beer really is 10.8%, then it's really hidden well."
"Abv wasn't noticed at all making this average tasting Doppelbock more drinkable. Caramel, mild chocolate, and caramel malt character. Was expecting better than this. Can't help appreciating this beers one great feat which is managing to make an 11% beer taste like a 7% beer. Mouthfeel is a little wet and foamy-nothing creamy or dry like you see with the top examples of this style."
"Your mind shall be blown"
"Worth a drink, (or two or seven) to get the full affect."
"I have heard a lot about this beer from friends, and looked forward to trying it after many failed attempts when it was out of stock at Whole Foods and a restaurant I know that had it, Ultimately, I was let down. The good tastes were there so I appreciate what the brewery was doing. I liken it too a high school cheerleader who's had too much to drink at a party. Too much alcohol, too little substance."
"The mouthfeel has a metallic twang to it and also has a crisp dryness. The beer coats your mouth in the finish and the feeling reminds me of eating that thick greek yogurt. As a whole I don't think this a bad beer but it isn't great. I find myself bored halfway through the glass and not really interested in any more."
"It's drinkable, complexity that's intriguing but not burdening."
"If somebody handed me a pint of this at the bar I'd drink it. It doesn't taste terrible. I am however offended by its claim that it is a doppelbock. It's watery. It's so watery in fact that I don't believe the claim that it is 10.8%. Maybe the first batch that they brought down to the lab tested 10.8% but it doesn't taste that alcoholic and it doesn't have the effect on me thinking nor me balance that I expect from 10.8%."
"Poured into a Celebrator glass. Dark ruby brown color with a thin tan head. It dissipates quickly and the resultant halo is constantly replenished with streaming bubble columns. Looks very fizzy and thin. Aroma is deep dark breads with artificial banana notes. Nutty and a bit roasty. Flavor is toasted bread with a touch of char as if the bread was left in the toaster a little too long. Weakly brewed coffee, with a blatantly watery finish. On one hand this beer is very watery for the strength, but on the other hand I don't taste any booze at all. Not sure how they managed that. Overall way too thin and simple."
"I am a bit conflicted on this beer, from a stylistic standpoint this beer is a complete mess, but it is actually not half bad, especially if you think of it as a Belgian interpretation of a DoppelBock. In the end though the body and flavor is lacking the richness and complexity that is need to really carry this beer."
"Atmosphere leaves a little to be desired. Appearance is a bit underwhelming, but nose is okay except for a musty tone. Flavor is not bad, just lackluster and washed out. Overall, this is an okay quaff. Again nothing offensive about it, just kinda' ""yep, that was a beer."""
"I could drink a few of these if I liked it more. I'd say it's sessionable if you like it and can stand up after a few 12 oz 10% ABV beers."
"not a bad beer, but definitely not the best representation of a good doppelbock. not quite a drain pour, but eh, it's unimpressive."
"Poured a dark brown color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of nuttiness, roasty, and caramel. Tastes of nuts, lighter roast, chocolate, and caramel. No way I would have pegged this one at over 10%."
"This beer really is like a bad joke, because it is nothing like it is advertised."
"Got a six pack of these because they were cheap for a doppelbock and the artwork looked foxy as hell. Poured them into a pint glass each time and the head never stuck around, regardless of how hard i poured it. Smelled ok, like a bock. Tasted thin, really thin for such a big (alcoholwise, stylewise) beer. The mouthfeel was thin and it just didnt have the malt backbone the style demands. Probably won't get this guy again. Although, it did hide the alcohol shockingly well."
"D - For a doppelbock? I could drink a bunch of these. I may have to try it to comment on the ABV."
"Pours a dark clear reddish body, wit ha small head off-white in color and quickly diminishing. Sweet molasses aroma, dusty, with some alcohol. Some dark chocolate. Has some sweet coffee, light roast. Some nuttiness. Pretty tasty. A little watery."
"D: Drinkable, but that is part of the problem with this beer. I expect a doppelbock to have full blown qualities and this beer does not."
"The flavor is a milder version of the aroma. There's really not much sustenance to it, save a mild note of caramel toffee and a crisp mineral finish. Where did the dark fruits go? Where is this 10+% alcohol? Disappointing to say the least. Still, the mouthfeel is that of a crisp, medium-bodied German lager and finishes dry and clean with a hint of residual sweetness. THANK GOD, because Indian Well's IPA finished with notes of bitter aspirin and stank veggies! Lobotomy isn't the best dopplebock out there, and I'm still scratching my head as to how this beer can register at such a high alcohol level, but it's certainly drinkable."
"It's kind of boring, and not all that drinkable. The alcohol is hidden."
"Very sub-par."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink. Plain, simple beer with some flavor."
"D- Not bad, but not too impressive either. The flavor is good, the soda like appearance is not so great. The alcohol is rather hidden so be careful."
"Very drinkable although I'm not sure I would want to test it out and see if this beer really does have 10.8% alcohol. Might have two or three in a night and thats about it."
"Overall, a high ABV sparkling cider, with only hints of chocolate or the bock flavors that I anticipated being walloped with. Drinkable, and with the ABV crazily well hidden, but not just as substantive or tasty as it could be."
"Drinkability: average at best. One 12 oz bottle is more than enough of this one. A bit disappointing for a big bock beer."
"Drinkability: I'll finish the two I have.... but will not seek this out again. One dimensional taste and thin consistency are the biggest detractors of this beer. PASS"
"Thanks to SacodeToro for the bonus brew!"
"MK"
"Very little change compared to what I had fresh at the brewery. Worth a try, but not a very good example of the style."
"As for drinkability, I had trouble finishing it. Thin, sweet and under-carbonated put this beer at the bottom of my list of recent acquisitions. The worst part is that I bought a full six pack."
"I hope that in the future, the focus is more on backing off of the ABV for fine tuning of the ingredients."
"Drinkability- I really had no idea how to rate this beer. I rated it as a bock rather than doppelbock. I came it with a lowered expection, but came out kinda liking this beer. I am, however, calling extreme bullshit on the listed abv. There is no way in hell this beer is over 10%. I would guess between the 6-7 range..if that."
"Notes: I came across this in my search for the worst beer ever. Sadly, it's not as bad as I was hoping, but it is decidedly mediocre."
"d - drank easily but probably because i was ready to get it over with. hard to believe this was 10.5 ABV."
"Pours dark brown with a thin but lingering sand colored head. Light aroma of raisin bread. Tastes surprisingly bland. Maybe just a hint of coffee with sugar (I prefer mine black), with an aftertaste that wavers between sweet and bitter without ever settling into a pleasant balance. Mouthfeel is thin and watery and the 10.5% ABV touted on the label is virtually undetectable. Not as enjoyable as I had hoped."
"Drinkability: Though it seems I'm the only one to think this, I felt the beer was a treat from start to finish."
"Bottle from Park Lane Liquor in Lancaster, CA. Pours dark brown with a reddish hue around the edges. Thin beige head that has decent retention, and spotty lacing. Medium (bordering thin sometimes) body with a smooth texture. Sweet roasted malt flavor with very light coffee and hops behind it. The finish is smooth and sweet with a hint of dark fruit and hops aftertaste. There is no way I would believe this beer is pushing 11%. Overall it is on the bland side."
"On the bright side, it leaves your mouth clean with no aftertaste."
"Got this in my beer of the month. I feel cheated this month, to be honest. The Lobotomy Bock should be mind altering if it lives up to it's name. It doesn't. The appearance was typical for a bock, Dark tan, a little transparent. It didn't really have much of an aroma and the head quickly dissipated. It definitely does not drink like a +10% beer. The alcohol is barely discernible. I'll be able to finish the other 3 I have left, unlike Lobotomy's Gold Mojave cousin."
"Mouthfeel is a bit too watery and fizzy given the ABV. Drinkability is good though."
"D: Not a bad bock, it certainly needs some improvements, I'd definitely give it another shot on my way to Lone Pine on the 395."
"Drinkability- Not the best bock, but pretty good."
"Could drink a lot of this even though there is a whole lot of alcohol in it"
"Notes: I enjoyed the amber but not so kind to this offering."
"drinkability: fine"
"mouthfeel and drinkability were average, but I don't think I would get this one again. I just thought it was not much more than a watered down version of a good high ABV beer."
"Drinkability  This is a wacky, off-style Doppelbock that some will love for the high ABV."
