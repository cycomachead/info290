3.46,-11.7,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"500mL bottle served in pub glass.  Beer pours orange amber in color, and somewhat cloudy, showing evidence of bottle fermentation.  Sweet, fruity aroma, a little plum.  Flavor is on the sweet side, too, finishing with a small dose of German hops, but not at all dry.  Fortunately that rules out any of the chalkiness sometimes associated with bock beers.  Also the alcohol is not at all present.  The parallels with a English Barleywine are somewhat remarkable: raisin, stone fruit, molasses.  But this high gravity beer is unmistakably german.  Easy to drink, but I'd prefer the former.","hreb","Mar 27, 2015"

As the beer warms a hint of chocolate comes forward. Light caramel sweetness underneath There is a dark fruit presence. Some prune, raisin and a faint whiff of alcohol. Taste is malty and rich. breaddy malt, dry and crisp. The middle of the drink is fruity. The edges have some grassy hops in them and the finish has a touch of medicinal alcohol. The alcohol dries out the palate and the malt lingers with a light bit of that caramel sweetness. A bit of bitterness comes from grass and form alcohol to finish this one dry. Lighter mouthfeel than some dopplebocks but medium and full enough. Slight warming from alcohol.","utopiajane","Aug 20, 2014"

The bitterness is about right but it lacks the malty hit I like to see in a doppelbock. Overall I would choose this over any mass market product and it does fit the style, just not as exciting as I would have liked. May be one of the few doppelbocks I;ve ever tried that I would almost consider a session beer. I like it.","slusk","Feb 10, 2014"
3.68,-6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/2013. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, pear, plum, apple, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance of malt and fruity yeast notes with solid complexity; and good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, plum, pear, apple, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, pear, apple, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish. Nice balance and solid complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice doppelbock. Good balance and solid complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 07, 2014"

This doppel bock was paired with spicy lentils and basmati rice for lunch to create a sweet-bitter balance, but it was such a caramel treat that I think it also would have been better had for dessert. This is an overall great doppel bock for the cost and is very satisfying. My only negative with this doppel bock was the too high alcohol content. I'm a lager type of beer drinker that branch out from time to time (hey, change is good), but I never drink to get drunk so would have appreciated a lower ABV. This one definitely hits you hard without tasting like it would so consider yourself warned (unless of course you like it that way).","shanny1981","Jun 01, 2013"

This is no summer-time-grilling-burgers-hopping on the riding lawn mower lager. This beer is alcohol heavy and meant to warm you up on a cold Bavarian night – and it does the trick nicely. The flavor of a Salvator goes really well with a good steak or any other food with substance. It’s a great ski lodge brew and I heartily recommend it.","bogggyboys","Oct 23, 2012"

Second time it had more to offer. Would recommend to drink it slowly, not to be too cold and to leave it a bit in the glass so it loses a bit of alcohol aroma. It's brown with nice head which doesn't stick around for too long. It has interesting taste with touches of bitterness and toffee. Still a bit sourish ending and strong alcohol feel.","rale","Oct 11, 2012"

It’s a hazy dark orange/brown colored brew with a smallish head that falls pretty quickly and leaves decent lacing. Rich aroma of alcohol, dark malt, and dark fruit (figs, prunes, plums). Sweetness is evident in the nose as well as the taste. This sweet flavor is offset by a mild alcohol presence, a bit of yeastiness, and lots of fruit flavor. Wonderfully complex with excellent biscuity malt. Carbonation is fairly low, with a very soft, rounded mouthfeel that’s easy to drink and has just the slightest amount of creamy stickiness. Medium-full body. I’ve always enjoyed this beer in the bottle but the draft version is noticeably better and more complex, with flavor subtleties that are easier to pick up. A must-try for doppelbock fans and a good warming beer for a cool evening. Big but not over the top. Very tasty.","tobelerone","Oct 30, 2011"
4.42,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer was way up ahead on taste too. Rich, smoky and sweet malt panning to a bittersweet end with almost everything in between. A lot of caramel and toffee, plums and figgs and yeast breadiness made it a mouthful. Just about the right amount of carbonation made it buoyant enough to be engulped within no time. This beer was a real screamer, and by the end of the 500 mil, I was feeling pretty happy. The 7.9% hides well enough under the guise of high drinkability to set you in motion.","BeerSingh","Oct 30, 2011"

The bee`r `pours a dark maroon-brown color and has the look and feel of red wine. The beer has practically no carbonation, which is awesome and smells of a hint of red wine, bordeaux possibly and goes down smooth with a hearty dinner.

3.95,0.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Found a six pack for about eight bucks which seemed reasonable. Had tried once at the airport in Seville and was okay with it then so I have it another shot. Nice dark orange brownish cloud free pour into my Tusker pilsner glass. Slight head which went away quickly but laced mildly. Rich malty smell. Taste is not overly complex but pleasant malty breast flavor. The high alcohol is somewhat masked. Medium body for a beer that is supposed totaled me through Lenten fasting. I imagine I would be rather imbibed if I did not eat and relied on this for sustenance but overall a pleasant but non sessionable beer.","jhtipton","Oct 19, 2011"

4.52,15.3,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"If you like doppelbocks and quads then you probably already know this one. If not, you've been missing out. Although you hopheads out there probably won't appreciate the caramel malt flavor explosion, I think most folks can appreciate the delicious malty flavor and great aroma. It pours out a caramel color with decent carbonation and lacing that persists for a few minutes. The smell is somewhat seasonal with hints of nutmeg, fig, raisin and bread. Once it touches your lips the malty flavor hits you like a ton of bricks, which makes it much fuller bodied than about anything I've tasted short of Ayinger Celebrator, Chimay Grand Reserve, or Aventinus Eisbock. Considering it only costs $2.29 for a 16.9 oz bottle (at 7.9%) it's cheaper than Coors Light (by alcohol volume), and it tastes better than all but the top ten beers on Earth. You absolutely cannot get a better beer for that cost. Hands down best bang for the buck, and delicious.","BryanRex","Sep 16, 2011"

The nose is pretty plain with a bit of sweet malt, bread, and caramel. Nothing too much in addition to that, and even those are pretty faint. The taste follows along the same lines--there really just isn't that much going on and I'm not impressed with the complexity of this one.

Overripe fruit in the nose, quickly followed by a sweet and malty fragrance, then a waft of alcohol. It has a very creamy, strong malty and sweet flavor at first sip, while being almost chewy in texture, with interesting nutty and ripe fruity notes that seem to make their way through the alcohol presence in spurts. No noticeable hop appearance that I could make out, just malt, malt and more malts. There are some very faint yeast notes that come through at the end of each sip, followed by a moderate amount of carbonation that tackles the larynx.

There are certainly some caramelized malts. Another sweet taste I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe some type of sweet dehydrated fruit followed by a hint of alcohol. This has quite a unique taste.

It was funny watching the carbonation bubbles struggle to make it to the surface. Definitely a heavier beer. The beer is tasty, but due to it's syrupy thickness it may be hard to drink in quantity.

As you go through it there is also some licorice alcohol in a mid-bodied blend with grain brightness. It's well carbonated, frisky but substantial with caramel and brown sugar.

It smells malty, like brown sugar a bit and caramel with a slight bit of hop presence in there.. The appearance is extremely light for the style, its an amber color with some orangish hue to it, totally clear with very little head. Taste is malty, a bit of caramel. ITs very crisp, more like your typical lager or such (think Sam Adams with some extra malt?) Its very light in mouth, not watery though. Its super crisp and easy to drink but its lacking in the richness of flavor and feel that you find in most doppelbocks. If I was blind tasting it I might guess it was a maibock.. I don;t know if its due to exposure to the more American ""big beer"" type of stuff that you come across more often, but its overall not just rich enough compared to otehr doppelbocks.

The smell was a blast of malt and alcohol vapor. Pretty much the same in the flavor. Got some notes of raisins and peat/evergreen as I sipped it, but this is a very malty beer. Alcohol is a bit hot too, so it's definitely a sipper. I preferred this beer in the wide mouthed mug over the slender Celebrator glass. It seemed to let the beer breathe a bit more.

The smell is sweet with an under lying scent of freshly harvested hay. Black cherry and banana notes are also observed. Salvator has a big, malty flavor with a prevalent yeast character.

The mouthfeel of this beer was a little heavy, with a bit of a dry feel after it leaves your mouth. Overall, this is another quality brew from paulaner. Recomended for fans of paulaner and fans of dopplebocks.","KodyBrannon","Jan 28, 2008"

3.52,-10.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"I remember this beer much more fondly than is probably warranted. I had this almost 20 years ago when anything over a 6% ABV was very hard to find in this country. The beer pours a reddish, copper color, not much head, no lacing, not much retention. The beer has a slight medicinal smell, malty, and that sweet caramel aroma that is very characteristics of marzen style beers. There isn't a heap of carbonation in this one, but thats quite characteristic of the style. The beer is tilted towards medium bodied. The taste is acerbic towards the finish, a bit flat throughout, sweet malts in the middle, and almost a candied fruitiness in the background. I let this beer settle hoping for better, but I still got that medicinal, slightly metallic, candied fruitiness, and flat taste. This is not my favorite by a stretch. I had much fonder rememberances of this and I almost wish I didn't re-try it. This is a complex beer, but that doesn't mean that I want to try it again.","albern","Jan 21, 2008"

A strong malty fragrance dominates the aroma, touches of dried fruit, like raisons and currants follow. It does end the slight twinge of alchol at the end. As expected malty sweetness envelops the palate and dominates the flavor almost all the way through. That is when slight bit of bitterness at the end, but is almost non-existant. The feel is a medium-heavy feel, with a sticky texture, it clings to the palate. This is a very good beer, a big surprise the Germans make good beer. This brings strong malt flavor for a lager and would be a great counter to IPA or Double IPA in a tasting.","cameraman","Jan 12, 2008"

The smell is of lightly roasted malt and candied fruit. A bit surprised to smell a roasted aroma due to the light appearance of the brew. Salvator starts off with a big caramel malt blast, bready, which is followed by a subtle but noticable alcohol hit. There are some candied fruit notes. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, finishes on the sweeter side with a bit of an alcohol burn. Not what I expected in a doppelbock. The alcohol is there but I expected much more malt.

There are caramel malts up front with a slight aroma of spices. Taste is pretty much the same except there is a warming alcohol tinge at the tail of the beer.

Nose is medium-bodied yet bold and pretty complex with a solid malt base complemented with some medium-ripe fruit and spice.

If one didn't know better, the current Salvator is a good beer. The crime is that it replaces a truly great beer, a beer with a history that began in 1634 and inspired many other Doppelbocks.

Aroma is a clean, slightly grainy maltiness, with hints of brown sugar or caramel in the background. Taste starts off clean and even a bit light but rich sweet malt quickly dominates. This beer achieves a great balence between the being rich and sweet without being syrupy. There is just a bit of roasted flavor in the aftertaste, and no real hop flavor or aroma.

The finish is of sweet bread, mild fruit and malty. Medium body and low carbonation leaves a thin, silky mouthfeel that is fair at best, but I was wanting something more chewy.

One instance why in particular stands out. I had painstaking half put together an edges-only jigsaw puzzle of Monet's ""Palazzo de Mula"" on the coffee table in her little apartment's living room when we got into a minor squabble. I had been razzing her about whatever people do and she got so incensed that she smashed the puzzle off the table and my week of work went to shit. With nothing else to lose I put it to her real good and she ended up so angry that she finally stood on the couch and somehow kicked me full force in the chest. I had a little wheezy bubble of defeat and disgust in my windpipe. This is the kind of feeling I get from the old Salvator but in not so severe a manner. It's like what I imagine the aftertaste of smoking menthol cigarettes would be like but with a full body dark beer primary taste included. Kind of like what you get from Bailey's Irish Creme. I like it, it's good, but I didn't care for the little hiss of creamy citrus alcohol at the tail-end. Not from a woman or a double bock.","thelagerheads","Jun 15, 2006"

Now I see that there is a date on the beer that says it is about a year old, but there is no detectable skunking...this beer should age well, no? Very unappetizing. Hardly drinkable at first. People like this? Hmm. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonated...nothing too notworthy...light compared to other dopplebocks.

There is some perceived noble hop flavor as well as slight bitterness. Alcohol makes itself known, but it is not too assertive. Leaves a long malty aftertaste.

The brew came out too cold, but that just allowed me to feel the nose bloom as it warmed. Starting from nothing, first some grain came through, then the sweet caramel and finally some floral hops. Lovely. The mouth was very prickly, light and surprisingly clean - I had remembered more viscosity. The taste was much like the nose, starting off as little more than a dunkles with its sweet caramel, but slowly blossoming into something stronger, with more of an espresso bite. By the end, the brew was everything I had remembered, both sweet and bitter, with a bit of fruit behind. Very nice indeed.","Globetrotter","Mar 08, 2006"

Aromas of roasted malt, spiced candy, caramel, and dates were detectable. The taste followed the aromas with an explosion of sweetness. The texture was thick and bready, making it exceedingly rich and smooth. Delicate flavors danced across my tongue and generated varying levels of sweetness, coating my entire mouth easily.

Molasses and oats are most apparent. Taste is completely spot on, all I could ask for from the style. Super sweet, reminds me of drinking maple syrup with the sweetness and thick mouthfeel.

I like the complexity, but on the other hand this beer is not too complex because i can still pick all of the flavors apart. Mild overall hops presence. Mouthfeel is watery at first, refreshing, but then leaves an oily coating as it evaporates in the mouth.

Theres a wonderful candied fruitiness of raspberry and plum, and a pleasant little hop bitterness. The finish is long-lasting and sweet with bit of alcohol, kind of like a tawny port.

Again the caramel, raisins, mild hints of grapefruit. A bit of bite in the mouthfeel, and just right on the carbonation. Could use a bit more ""pepperyness"" for my taste.

Tastes good but almost too sweet and the alcohol is very prevalent, which both lower the taste score. Beer is thick and smooth, leaving a warming sensation as it goes down.

Sniffing from the bottle after popping the cap I get a very peculiar leathery, seasoning salt smell. A cream-coloured, almost light red head forms, about 4 cm, leaving healthy thick patches of lace. The beer is almost red, but more of a dark orange, and extremely clear. The head narrows to a thin, but fine covering. The aroma is spicy, and extremely salty. I get massive whiffs of seasoning-salt here. Leathery, chemical-like, extremely unique. I smell tomato-juice, and celery salt. Some of the smells are hard to define. I do get some red-malt aroma, some butterscotch, and very pungent acidity. The taste is not half as full or mysterious as the aroma might suggest: instead of much spiciness, I get more of the leathery malt, and some astringent sour properties, and some basic caramel malt in the finish. Some taste akin to barbeque sauce, or tomato juice. Sweet malt, more salinity, butter, metallic notes, sour cheese. The mouthfeel is actually quite oily and dry, but very full. This was not my favourite beer when I first tried it a couple of years ago, but it has grown on me, especially after trying many different barleywines and old ales. I would still not drink more than two of these in a night, equally out of respect for its taste and its strong gravity.","Cwrw","Dec 16, 2004"

Sweet malts dominate most of the flavor profile but not in a way that makes it undrinkable, and there is a great dry/hoppy character in the finnish that perfectly balances out the maltiness of the front end.

Suggestions of maple syrup carry over into the flavor, although the main focus is still on toffee and butter. Dense flavors of allspice and cinnamon prevent the mellow, rich sweetness from ever becoming cloying. Walnut-skin dryness at the roof of the mouth leads into an aftertaste that recalls caraway seeds and woodsy hops. This is happily bitterer than I had expected. No tangible carbonation to a mouthfeel that is on the light side of medium in body and drier than the aroma would suggest.

The taste is in the finish, where the maltiness turns sweet & sticky and the alcohol turns spicy. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin at first then becomes syrupy, which detracts from the drinkability.

Interesting flavor profile, but that's just because I love the style and this one doesn't have any of the balancing elements (smoke, light bitterness) that top examples like celebrator can boast about.

Rich malty flavor and a little sweetness. Fruity top notes, maybe raisins and some carmel. Finish includes a taste of hops and alcohol warmness. A little bit of banana in the aftertaste.

Full velvety mouthfeel, it is a pleasure to have this roll over the tongue and wash over the palate. Very drinkable for a higher abv beer, in the fact that I could see myself turning this one into a sessional (one that I have no doubt I would regret the next morning), as well as that I'd reach for it again the next time I am out beer shopping.

The first taste was surprising; a little more tangy/metallic than I remembered from the tap, but it wasn't bad - if there could be a cross between something like pineapple and caramel, I think you could find it here. The sweetness sort of pervaded, perhaps just a little too much. I think this one should be enjoyed with certain meals, maybe involving sausage or steak... definately steak.

Smell had a definite alcohol scent, but it was offset but a fruity aroma. Flavor was sweet, with a strong alcohol accent...reminded me of an after dinner cordial. Mouthfeel was very full and robust....don't guzzle! a definite sipping brew. For the alcohol content, very drinkable (if you sip). Not the kind of beer to drink all night, but I certainly would have one before bed to help me sleep.","edchicma","Sep 04, 2003"

4.45,13.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A tasty looking reddish-brown brew with a cream colored head atop it. Pretty good head retention for a doppelbock. It does stay for a while, but it goes away for the most part eventually. Lots of caramel sweetness in the nose, and an almost candi sugar-like sweetness as well. Grainy undertones are also noticeable. On the palate, it's big caramel malt up front, very smooth. As it reaches the middle, it gets a bit more intense, and a cereal grain character is added to the mix. More caramel intensity at the back, with just a hint of hop leaves. This continues into the finish, which is suprisingly almost dry. Rich and malty throughout, as a doppelbock should be. Excellent, one of my favorites in the style. Can't wait to have another!","hyuga","Aug 10, 2003"

Aroma is very complex with carmelly malts and a hop balance with a definte alcohol scent. Flavor is sweetish with carmel notes and a hallertauer hop character and a malty finish. Body is light and refreshing which seems to hide the strength of the alcohol.

Smell was of toasted malt, with fruit and floral notes. Very creamy mouthfeel. Taste was of toasted malt, fruit, a hint of caramel, and a minor zap from the hops to wind things up, just enough to keep the malt from being overpowering. The fruity aspect reminds me a little of fruitcake, except it's good!

This sample was a 12oz bottle that poured crystal clear brown with a thick tight head that dissapeared in a couple minutes leaving only a few tiny dollops of white foam. Only slight lacing as well. Aroma is super sweet and malty with a hint of alcohol. Flavor is also very sweet and nothing but malt. It improves as it warms and flavor loses a little sweetness.

The appearance is copper in color, I expected it to be darker being a double bock. It poured with a nice thick head that lasted about 3 or 4 minutes. Aroma is malty with fruit and a bit of alcohol. Its taste is a bit like a barley wine, sweet, fruity and alcohol, but nicely balanced with the malt and hops - that is to say not overly fruity which really turns me off. It is not overly carbonated. It left a nice malty caramel aftertase. This beer is very drinkabe, although not everyday. This one to sit back relax and enjoy slowly - definately not a bar type of beer.

Nose was of caramel, beauiful roasted wheat, and a nutty malt that also gave off a corn scent. Taste was a hearty malt, roasted only enough. Clear and clean, but with a creamy tone and one ounce of sweetness. Then came an opposing burnt sensation at the finish. Mouthfeel was fairly oily.

The carbonation level was not great, it sort of felt like an alcoholic syrup covering the inside of my mouth. All in all, I thought it was pretty good, but I wasn't that impressed.

I believe that Salvator is another world classic that has been overshadowed by more recent, over the top beers. I have never been disappointed by this beer.

The taste was malty, but with some slight hop tones (maybe I was just searching for them). There was no indication of ABV for my tastes.

No bitterness whatsoever and no hint of the 7.5% ABV, making it temptingly dangerous. :) I don't feel as if I could drink many of these in a row though.

A bit of bitterness cleans the palate on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, with mild carbonation. Drinakbility is very good as well, especially for malt-lovers. I feel like I didn't say enough about this beer. It's pretty complex and top notch in every respect, but it defies description for me tonight.

I look at it as enabling me to drink more of these than I could Celebrator and though I enjoy the taste of Celebrator more, the lighterness of this brew in comparison helps it's drinkability.  Now as for the beer it has a very unique red tint to its dark amber color.  The head is light and cabornation is even lighter.  The taste is a rich toasted malt with a trace of an alcohol aftertaste.  Leaves a slight lace around the ale glass I am drinking out of.

3.55,-9.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Salvator Double Bock:  Deep brown color, very clear, with a coffee and cream head.  Cocoa aroma, with a hint of booze.  Biscuit malt flavor, with but a hint of hops.  Rye bread, and a hint of alcohol warmth on the way down.  Thick, strong brew.  I’ll buy it again when the temperature drops.","jackndan","Sep 07, 2002"
4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice dark copper with an eroding white head, good malty taste,  Easy drinking . It will sneak up behind you and knock you out.  So treat it with the respect it deserves.","jtw5877","Jul 24, 2002"
4.7,19.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Wow!  Superb!  Has to be my favorite brew from Paulaner.  Pours a very clear caramel color almost like a dark tea.  The 2 finger head is a light tan and dissipates fairly quickly, but still leaves a lace down the glass.  The taste is a slight caramel with a slight earthy tone and well balanced hops.  This a light to medium bodied brew that is very very drinkable!  Prosit!","BeerAngel","Jul 16, 2002"

4.47,14,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This one's a nice amber with an off-white head that dimishes but sticks around to the end. The smell is malty sweetness with just a bit of hop kick. It starts out very nicely but just gets better as it warms. Caramel and toffee flavors become more pronounced as the beer sits in the glass for a while. It has neither the aroma nor taste of a 7.5% abv beer. It's smooth and very drinkable. I also found the ""ale"" reference on the label to be surprising. However, ale or lager, this is a top-notch beer.","mickeymac","May 29, 2002"
4.38,11.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thick, off-white head.  Malty, spicy aroma...sometimes with a sense of ripe fruit.  Heavy sweetness and noticeable alcohol.  Extreme malt presence.  For years, I've personally enjoyed Salvator more than Celebrator.  This is a consistently great doppelbock.","Suds","May 27, 2002"
3.98,1.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"First I was surprised like many at the lighter color of this doppelbock.  It's a nice dark, red amber color with a copper head to it.  Not to heavy of a aroma to it.  Lighter, slightly tangy taste to it.  Nice flavor.  Celebrator is by far the better, but this is still a keeper.","Wildman","May 17, 2002"

4.57,16.6,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Very nice copper, caramel color with soft creamy tan head. The smell was unbelivably sweet and smooth. I tasted alot of carmel, spicy sweetness, maybe brown sugar and cinnamon to start.Nice bitterness on the finish. Was a little sticky and syrupy on the tongue, but pleasant. Not as delicious as the Celebrator dopplebock, but easier to drink more than one, and very very good. A new favorite. Cool label as well, a beer deserving of it's name. Freshness date was 4/03","StevieW","Apr 17, 2002"
3.7,-5.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"An evening of Doppelbocks for me last night.  Clear orange amber.  Consistent 1/2 inch head.  Sweet smell, slightly cinammon bread.  Thick malty flavor, bold front to back, verging on heavy bodied.  Falls spot on as far as style, in the smell, stickiness, and flavor departments.  Falls into the somewhat ordinary as far as complex flavor or impression on the mind.  Malty as all-get-out, but hard to classify the taste other than sweet and dense, maybe slightly brown sugar.  Respectably brewed.","ADR","Apr 09, 2002"
3.94,0.5,3,4,4,4,4,"This beer is copper.  Looks more like an alt than a dopplebock to me.  (Although I guess ""deep amber"" qualifies for a dopplebock.)  Some nice malt on the nose and a little bit of the fruity esters too.  Pretty good taste, but not great.  I just had the Celebrator and this is not in that class.  Maybe one notch below.  Smooth creamy mouthfeel.  Pretty full bodied and definite malt tones on the buds.  I detect a little bit of bitterness in this doppel, but not a lot.  Pretty easy drinking.  Good Doppel.","Bighuge","Apr 08, 2002"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"I think this is an old bottle. Label says 10.02. I'm assuming this is Oct of last yr. Didn't read the label before I left the store; I wanted to get my last doppelbock kicks in before spring hit full swing. Can't vouch for its storage but seems in reasonably good shape; still pretty sturdy if not ideal. Head disappeared quickly and the more robust malty characteristics are blurred. Any hops are totally obscured. However the flavor has mellowed in an interesting and pleasant way. A little more liqueur-like, sweet on the palate but a hint of matured bitterness at the back of the mouth. Evocative of apples. Not as filling as doppelbocks tend to be. I'll hopefully review this again when I get a primo fresh bottle.","Thrasher","Apr 01, 2002"
4.38,11.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It just gets better as it sits.  I have not had a better dopplebock.    As I have said, it really bolsters itself up as it warms...seems somewhat thin when cold.  But silky, malty bliss otherwise.","cokes","Mar 09, 2002"
4.58,16.8,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Deep orange hue, almost the color of a nicely aged scotch. Bubbly tan head that stays for a while, then fades away to let you really take in the beautiful hue. Caramel aroma, faint dark fruitiness, almost like a barley wine in complexity. Tastes of toffee and hard candy, like the kind my grandmother used to have around the house during the holidays, followed by a peppery alcohol finish. Man oh man, this is the Savior!","mophie","Mar 05, 2002"
4.45,13.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Oooh..Love it!!! Amber/dark copper color, but with minimal head. Mild sweet, malty nose...mmm. Medium-full body, and medium mouthfeel.......!! Love the taste...sweet, malty, a touch nutty, smooth finish.. again: mmmm! Can drink this any time of the day/any day of the week/any week of the year.....you get the picture!!!!","Alewife","Feb 26, 2002"
4.18,6.6,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Dark red hue.  Crystal clear like a well lagered beer should be.  Thin but persistent head with fairly low carbonation. Very visually appealing.  Toasty, biscuity, melanoidin malt aroma... you can smell the decoction.  Domestic microbrewed doppels always lack this.  Huge malt sweetness dominates initially and is then followed by toffee and caramel flavors.  Very smooth with a medium body-- it definitely doesn't seem too rich and thick.  Incredible balance.  Very low hop bitterness and flavor-- there's no shortage of malt flavors in this brew.  Alcohol warmth very noticeable in the finish.  Yum. I only want a bit more body in this beer.  But that's just me.  This is a tremendously flavorful doppelbock.  I have yet to have a microbrewed version as good as the widely available Ayinger, Spaten or this one.","marc77","Feb 21, 2002"
4.82,23,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Boy do I love doppel's..I have a hard time picking a favorite between the big hitters.  This is another dandy...Copper/bronze in color...soft lace throughout...tremendous aroma...fruity with dark red cherries coming through on the nose...very malty and sweet on the buds...but at least to me, not too sweet.  Just a hint of alchohol on the finish..very smooth...and a very complex taste...tough to identify everything I am tasting but at different spots I taste the dark red cherries...bread...a hint of caramel..a hint of maybe bourbon...very complex but wonderful.  As I grow as a taster I hope to better characterize what I am tasting in beers like this, but for now this will have to suffice..(there is a lot more here in this taste than I can put to words though)...","ZAP","Feb 03, 2002"

4.5,14.8,5,5,4,4,5,"This is one complex brew.  It's very tasty, but hiding behind caramel and fruit notes is the slight kick of hallertau hops.  This is definitely a beer to try. Mmmm.. Hallertau...","bk3nj","Oct 28, 2001"
