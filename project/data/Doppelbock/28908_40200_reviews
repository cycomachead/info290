"- good attempt at a german classic"
""
""
"Overall : time to invest in a six pack. Probably the best Doppelbock I've had to date, and by far the best Wasatch beer I've tried."
""
""
"Much recommended."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of sweet malts. Taste is malts, dark breads, a touch of sweetness at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
""
"Wasatch The Devastator Double Bock,not a fan, no thank you"
"Draft.  Good looking medium to dark brown with a touch of mahogany; minimal head that didn't last.  Not much of a smell, but predominantly sweet--couldn't say specifics.  Taste is a bit on sweet side, too.  Clean, smooth, tasty, decent texture.  Alcohol wasn't present much in taste.  I enjoyed it and would drink it again; in fact, I did order a second and my friend had three!  I would drink this as an easy social beer or in a restaurant with my meal instead of a Shiner or dark Vienna Lager."
"Must have been a bad batch. Did not taste good. Drain pour."
"Was not a fan.  First the smell reminded me of the smell of throwup at a college party.  And the taste got worse with each sip"
""
""
""
"Was not a fan. May have been the batch, but smelled and tasted unbelievably funky"
"Had one a piper down a few weeks ago and enjoyed it. Rich and smooth"
""
""
"V - Bought single, not sure of 6 pack pricing."
""
""
"Conclusion: A very nice American double bock. True to style, and doesn't get off track or flavorless like some American interpretations do. Harder to pull off, and earns my respect. Could be more complex, but I would much rather it taste good and simple like this, than compromise true flavors for increased ""complexity"". The original and classic German versions are better (than pretty much any American versions), but this is worthy of respect and I would drink it all the time."
"Had on tap. Chocolate malt leads a malty bomb of goodness."
"Utah native.. My go to"
""
"Pours clear dark Amber with very small head and low head retention, nose of bready bready malts practically no hop detection definite grain and heavy malts. Thick mouthfeel with a sweet bready taste that gets more savory afterwards, great beer, the sales associate that helped me described this beer as ""the beer shiner wants to be""."

"Pours a deep reddish-mahogany in color with a thin beige head. A decent amount of sticky lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is very pleasant and is of caramel malts, brown sugar and dark fruit. The taste is even better with some toffee, and the dark fruits (dates, raisins, plums) sweetness coming through but not overly sweet. Goes down easy with no bitterness at all. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation for this style of brew. Overall, really liked this one."

"O: I enjoyed this beer, and I didn't have too high of hopes after trying Polygamy Porter last night. Devastator is a much better crafter beer -- nice toasty caramel sweetness that brings a good kick of maltiness without being cloying. SMooth and drinkable, even at 8%. Great job."

"O. Overall this beer was a pleasant surprise. I decided to try it because it was almost sold out at the local specs. But there could have been another reason for that. After I got home I noticed my receipt, they only charged me 1.25 for a six pack. Who knows why this was the last one on the shelf but I am glad I tried it. I don't dorm to many craft lagers but this one I would purchase again."
""
"Dark brown in color with great clarity. A fingernail of khaki colored head obverse three quarters of the top. The aroma is comprised of dark malt,chocolate,and sourdough bread. The flavor is chocolate,dark malt,with a bit of a sourdough component. The mouth is moderately carbonated and smooth."
""
""
"The Devastator is just that if one tries to session. Having this in Park City during our vacation. The 8% abv makes it a toughy....but it was quite flavorful beer. There was hints of caramel and molasses in the taste with a backdrop of alcohol. The mouthfeel is full body with good carbonation. Overall this was a solid offering from Wasatch."

"Great drinker. Excellent at high altitude! Warm amber color. Strong, clean taste on the palate. Minimal hop taste, but subtle and invites exploration. Pairs with most everything. Should be exported outside Utah. Sucks at tap abv. Head does not last long enough. Question choice in yeast."
""
"Overall: It's really hard to go wrong with a dopplebock in general. With a name like ""Devastator"" it can't be a bad beer. I have no complaints with this brew, I have had better dopplebocks, but taste is a matter of opinion. If you're debating getting this beer, go ahead and give it a try, it's tasty and goes down almost too easy considering its' 8% ABV."

"O-This is a pretty simple brew. I kept waiting for more complexity or depth, but each sip stayed fairly uninspired. There were hints of greatness with the tobacco and ripe, dark fruits of the smell, but those faded quickly as the brew warmed. I could have used more cocoa or deeper fruit flavors. Ho-hum."

"Overall- Matches the heavy malt bill of most doppelbocks but lacks the integration of some of the better ones and is definitely not in the same class as Ayinger. If you like doppelbocks, then give it a try. If not, you can pass."
""
"Overall:A solid doppelbock that is dangerously drinkable. This one is good and sweet but not overly complex. I will pick this up again at some point."
""
""
""

"this is a pretty nice offering, and the first beer i've had from this brewery. i wouldn't mind seeing what they're capable of with other styles."

"O - This is a good dopplebock. My first Wasatch brew was a good choice."
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste has a candy-esque sweetness supplemented by slightly burnt caramel and toast. Alcohol is well hidden up front but flashes a slight sting on the finish. Mouthfeel is modest for a doppel and the carbonation is fine-bubbled. I don’t really like the near-burnt bready alcohol finish, it is a little acrid. It’s a passable doppel, but it might be awhile until I grab a sixer of this at the store."
""
""
"A solid, definitely above-average doppelbock. I like it; its main faults are that it doesn't measure up to the best in depth and complexity. But it's tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This brew is nice and malty with a slight sweet tone to it that is smooth. Really smooth. And I think that is what the definition of this beer is: smooth. I really don't have much to say beyond that really."
"O-"

"O - Pretty good doppelback, but doesn't really stand out. Alcohol is not apparent. Just a bit too thin."

"3.5 D: Tasty beer, but pretty standard doppelbock."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, with a solid head and lots o' lacing. Nose is basic and not so exceptional. Flavor is thick, syrupy and full characterized by malt and a cloying sweetness. Overall, this is a pretty decent quaff."
"It's a clear, tannish red with a small amount of foam. The aroma was plum and caramel. The taste was rasin, canelope, more on the earthy side. The taste and body seemed a tad thin for the style, sepecially for an 8% brew. After finishing the glass, I might debate it isn't really 8%, since I didn't really feel the alcohol. I would probably have this again. I mostly chose it because it was one of the few items on the menu I haven't tried yet."
""
""

""

"O – Hard to really say much more about this one. A solid enough double bock, but nothing that would make me really remember this or rush out to buy it again."
"T: the ABV is perfect, but it is rather simple for a double bock; caramel, toasted grains; a touch of honey and lemon in the aftertaste"
"Devastator is devastating – could use a little more flavor -- but it is drinkable for its strength and fairly tasty."
"a boozed up malt bomb here. pours a bright clear copper color with a small just off white head. smells like german malts and a candy sweetness. the sugars are less intense in the taste, but the malts are diverse, earthy, thick, and lasting. hard to place this one exactly, similar to one of the troegs bock beers out there, maybe like a lesser version of the troegenator even. feel is fine, average carbonation and a bigger than medium body. really cool artwork on the bottle and well priced for an 8% brew. i wouldnt want more than one of these, but im glad i tried this."
"Tasty even if it does not show off that much depth. Very clean and almost too easy to drink for an 8.0% brew. Well done."
""
"M: well-balanced and very drinkable, a bit thin in body compared to nose"
"12 oz single from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $1.99 Pours a clear light brown,small light tan head..goes fast leaves loads of lace. Aroma is a lot moe subdued than i expected what there is is of course caramel malts and raisins Smooth toasty,caramel,fudge maltiness in the taste, rather simple and no real depth, has alcohol present in the end. Pretty thin for the style on the palate. Overall not impressed..this seems to me like maybe a regular dark bock not a dopplebock"
"Overall- It's a solid beer, but a bit pricey for what you get and not terribly interesting. I probably wouldn't pick it up again, though I may recommend it to a friend that's not generally into darker beer but wants to try one."
"Overall this wasn't bad but it didn't fit it's style IMO. I really think it tasted more like a Scotch/Scottish/Wee Heavy than a Doppelbock but not a bad choice if you get the chance. Thanks to Rim Liquor for this one."
""
"Pours a orange/amber color with tan soapy foam. Aroma is very malty, with caramel and honey undertones. In the taste, some toffee, caramel, brown sugar, but not too sweet. Balanced with little hint of alcohol. Smooth, medium bodied feel. Overall, a tasty and deceivingly strong bock, too much could prove devastating."
""
"O- This is a very interesting beer, not what I expected at all. Its more of a tripel or Quad then any other style of beer. This beer has a big feel to it and is definitely a sipper. A very enjoyable beer if your in the mood for something this crazy."
"O. A pleasant enough beer to drink but not a great doppelbock. They've got the malt-forward aspect right but it's a bit on the sweet side, and there's definitely an old ale character to it."
"Handsome dark amber in the glass. Fragrant with some dark fruit in the nose. The odd perfumey flavor with an earthy aftertaste is not one I care for at all."
"O: A decent beer. A bit to sweet in my opinion. It's slightly complex. Haven't had many Doppelbock's to compare to so take what I say with a grain of salt."
""
""
"Meh. Served at a good temperature and with an average sized light tan head and a bit of lace. Color was a clear dark amber. Aroma is malt, caramel, solvents. Flavor is sweet on top, then like nose and some carbonic tang. Body is ok, ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, of average length, but with the lingering solvent sweet thing. The label is a little weird with the ""Big Love from the Land of Zion"". Doubt i'll be having another."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"The beer pours a brown color with a large, off-white head. The aroma is very malt as is expected. I get some toffee and bread notes, as well as some vinous notes. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of toffee and a little bread, as well as some grape-like fruit notes that mix very well with the malt. The alcohol is detectable but not overwhelming. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice doppelbock."
"It is an okay american dark lager."
"Overall: A different kinda doppelbock, one that I really enjoy. I originally bought it for the cool label, but the taste and alcohol gives you a nice buzz. Happy Labor Day, y'all."
"This is a ""big"" beer which I think holds its own against any other in the style. I could drink this all year long, but am looking forward to a few of these in the fall. Another great point to make was that this was a relatively inexpensive beer, especially for what you get. I will definitely be buying this again."
"The body wasn't as full as I like for the style, but that kinda helped drinkability. The beer was pretty smooth and went down pretty easily. Overall, a solid example of the style. I wouldn't mind having more of these, and if it were local to me it would be a semi-regular for me. Worth trying when you get the chance."
"A pretty decent beer, but slightly more of a caramel taste than I was hoping for."
"Smells like pecans, just like another astute BA already pointed out. Also I get a vague honeyed smoke scent off this one. Odd. Its almost as if it couldn't decide on whether to be a rauchbier or a doppelbock. Hides the ABV perfectly and has pretty decent body, texture, but the flavor is much weaker than the nose hinted at. The shortest finish on any craft beer I have ever tasted, and in this case that is a bad thing because the sweet malt that is there is quite delicious, just a total mismatch to what the nose is telling me, is all."
"Medium brown cloudy body, minimal effervescence almost still, little if any head resulted in no lacing. Caramel malts in the nose and wet cardboard, ugh. No plum/prune/raisin esters, a bit of burnt brown sugar, not much in the way of flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty watery, no stickiness. No go, won't do this again. On the low end of the tasting scoring. IMHO, not very good."
"Poured a dark orange color beer with an average size head which quickly dissipated. It smelled of burnt caramel, brown sugar, honey, yeast. It tasted of wheat, honey, tea, yeast, toffee and some malt. Can't taste the alcohol , generally this can be good or bad, in this case it is bad because the beer just seem slightly flat with a weird aftertaste. Doesn't stay true to its style."
"Drink- Average Dopplebock and I was expecting it, not too suprised. Nice to try for a state not known for beer"
"Overall - a pretty decent brew, but not very intriguing in terms of its taste."
"Taste was of pecans and roasted nuts. Tasted much sweeter than a normal double bock. Almost seemed like it was a straight up pecan beer. Mouthfeel was decent. Lost some carbonation as I kept drinking. Overall, not impressed. Was a slightly below average double bock that was too sweet and didn't keep carbonation long enough. The alcohol was not detectable, which was a good thing, in my opinion."
"Poured into pint glass with very light head and a moderate amber color. Light malt smell. Taste a bit sweet, light malt flavor. Before you know it you are ready for another drink because the taste is gone. Definitely a week doppel but very drinkable. No hint that it is an 8% so a positive there. Would chose another one to drink while out in a bar but I would not have to have another."
"Sweet toffee. Alcohol is well hidden. Short with flavors well blended. Could use some more biscuity and cereal notes that I enjoy in most doppelbocks. Lots of chocolate covered notes in the taste as well as the smell. Light and sweet."
"D: An easy drinker for its weight, but it doesn't make me lust for more."
"Sub oar in any regard. Not a DoppleBock, and not all that enjoyable. Not something I would recommend."
"Decent example of a dopplebock. But there's nothing special enough here to warrant a second purchase."
"Quite easy to drink for an 8.0, but still, no real need to as there are a multitude of better choices in this style."
"Opinion: Well, if you read my review, you would know that this beer disappointed me. I am really critical of this style as this is what I primarily brew and drink, but I regularly drink the classic examples. I live in Texas, where the origin of this mis-guided ""Bock"" characterization has occurred, so I am no stranger to drinking a Brown Lager that has the words ""Bock"" printed on the side of the bottle. You don't typically find that with a brewer that will print ""Double Bock"" on the bottle, but that is what you have with this beer. It is the same Americanized ""version"" of the Bock style, but the alcohol is cranked up a bit, so I guess they printed Double on the side. I will stick to my Weihenstephaner Korbinian and leave this on the shelves for someone who just wants a quick buzz with no real Bock flavor."
"D: Good with the exception of that weird aftertaste. Some room for improvement here."
"That 8% alcohol is nowhere to be found in the flavor. I drank this one like a much smaller beer, I can see how it could have devastating effects over the course of the night. I only have one bottle though, so that was not a problem for me. Pretty good beer though."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and smooth drinking. I really like this beer. Simple, solid flavors that are really pleasing. Definitely my favorite of the 3 beers I had while waiting for my flight."
"I really enjoyed this beer and it was very tasty. I would really enjoy this as a premeal beer or perhaps with some pork."
"Decent taste, nutty, malts, not too overpowering for 8% alcohol. For the lack of head, the mouthfeel is pleasing and suprisingly carbinated. I think the drinkability is very good- although you need to be carefull due to the alcohol content."
"Drinkability is good, and this is evidenced by all of the drunk Utah hipsters raving about this beer. I though it was alright."
"Wasatch's Devastator Double Bock is a solid interpretation of the style that might have earned higher scores across the board if I was more of a doppelbock dude. Please take that into account and buy accordingly."
"This doppelbock lacks heavily in the nose and taste department. The sweetness is overpowering, overly lingering, and also not of the rich, dark, heavy bread-fruit-nut flavors that I associate with the best of these. With this high of an ABV as well, I don't see myself having many."
"12 oz. bottle proclaims that this beer ""will earn some Big Love," and that ""Utah will never be the same."" It's deep copper, with light carbonation and a finger of tan head that leaves light lacing. The rich Munich malt delivers sweet and toasty melanoidins - nice and aromatic. Very rich malts are toasty/bready, lightly sweet, and blended with a bit of hops that deliver a mild bitterness. Medium to light body, with nice attenuation for a big lager. Very easy to drink, but it's better to sip and slowly take in its deep maltiness. These Utah brewers did indeed earn some ""Big Love."""
"I found this at the Wasatch Pub in the Salt Lake Airport. An Autumn coloured beer that is extremely drinkable for the style; not too sweet and enough complexity once it warms up. I wished this was not so high in alcohol as it would make a great Fall drinking beer. I hardly noticed the ABV in this beer but felt it on the plane ride to Seattle"
"D: I was expecting this to be pretty bad, given the gimmicky label and the fact that I bought it at a crappy liquor store in Vegas, but I actually enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: Taste is too bad to want to drink more than a 12oz bottle if you can get through that."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"This one poured from the bottle like liquid caramel glistening in the sun. Nice aromas of caramel and earth hop, give way to apples and fruity hops on the palate. A different and interesting dopplebock."
"D: This is a sipper and as state earlier the alcohol harshness makes this a bit difficult to swallow but I like ho the sweetness doesn't overwhelm like it often can in this style"
"I just went back and saw prior review. I don't look at prior reviews before I write mine. However, and respectfully, I really feel like I was tasting a different beer. Bottle I had was as indicated above."
"Alcohol is entirely hidden, beautifully balanced and fully flavored. This is an entirely respectable and very tasty example of a style that can easily vary from superb to completely mundane. This falls short of the absolute best German examples (Curator, Celebrator), but a worthy beer that's easily able to stand on its own two feet."
"It's a bit one-dimensional, but not a terrible offering."
"While I appreciate the complexities and the little things that jump outside the doppelbock realm, this beer is severely lacking in oomph for the style. Not a bad beer to have purchased and enjoyed - don't get me wrong - but this is not a doppelbock, so adjust your expectations. This is a good lager beer with some subtle flavor notes, but generally speaking just a little too sweet and light-bodied."
"The body was nice and full. A sticky doughy feel coated the mouth nicely. The alcohol was pretty subdued by an abundance of flavor and body, very well done."
"M/D- Thick bodied, medium/high carbonation. Low drinkability. This is a very poorly made doppelbock."
"Thanks, Douglas88, for the opportunity"
"drinkability: was not impressed and seemed to be a weak beer for it's style."
"Poured this dark amber beer into a pint glass. The foam of this beer was a fair amount and reduced to faint wisps of lacing. The aroma of caramel, and malt. The taste of caramel is ever present in this beer. Overall a good initial tasting but then a tart roast flavoring is the remains of the beer."
"Mouthfeel is nothing to write home about really. Main claim to fame would be decently strong beer from Mormon Country."
"Needless to say, not my cup of tea... But for bock lovers, I would definitely give it a whirl and see if it strikes your fancy..."
"Finding I like it better on the second try."
"This 12 oz bottle poured a rich and clear deep copper color with a robust light tan head and very nice lacing rings as it settled. Nose of caramel malts with lots of other aromas of nuts, ripe fruit, and even some smokiness. Rich and creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is slightly sweet with some yeasty fruity flavors. You can detect the alcohol in the finish. Pretty darned good."
"Drinkability: Thanks, but no thanks. A tad lacking for a doppelbock, really. I'd prefer something more bready, more richly melanoidin laden instead of all this sharp graininess."
"i've been pleasantly surprised by these wasatch offerings."
"Drinkabilty: Nice and malty, just like I like 'em. A great example of the full bodied doppelbock that really feels like you are getting a hold of something."
"D - Drinkability is average for this beer. The alcohol is balanced well with the other flavors but the beer as a whole just comes across as average. I could easily have another one of these but there is not really enough going on here to seek it out again. The appearance could really use some tweaks and the tea in the flavor was just off-putting enough to knock it down a notch. Very glad I got to try it though."
"Thanks Wasatch for sending this along in a recent trade."
"Drinkability - This was a decent beer."
"Overall while being very solid, I was expecting a bit more. Not as true to the style as I would have liked, but still more then decent. I would have no issue with trying this one again, but I would not seek it out by any means."
"Dry and not the least bit sweet which scores points for me."
"Pours clear and amber with a 2 finger off-white head. Good retention and lots of lacing. Smell is strong of dry malt and some bread and yeast. Taste is a malt-bomb. Biscuity dry malt, some yeast, a touch of sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium, moderate carbonation. Overall I didnt feel this was too drinkable given the high ABV. I should note that I am not a huge malt-man. I like my beers hoppy, or at least balanced. This was not very balanced and was a biscuit-malt mess."
"Medium-low carbonation but, at least at first, it doesn't feel smooth on the palate."
"Overall Drinkability- This is a really nice beer. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys bock beer. Style is dead on."
"D- Was surprised to find an 8% in SLC, but decided to try the Mormon radical. Has a picture of a ram and the Mormon temple on the label. Something that could be kept in the fridge for those wanting a change every now and then. Wasn't undesirable, but not a must have."
"drinkability: ok"
"This concludes my tour of Utah beer."
"A nice dark coffee color with a firm but thin light tan head and great lacing. The aroma is a deep coffee malt and peat, deep and edible. The first mouthful reveals a medium bodied tangy medley of coffee smoke and apple malt. This is almost a porter, quite drinkable but there is a bit of alcohol presence enough to avoid guzzling. Some grassy notes. Smoothly carbonated, very unique, highly recommended."
"D = This is a decent beer and I could definitely see enjoying a couple of these at a beer garden, but I think it is pretty squarely average for the style."
"This is delicious. Highly recommend getting yourself some of this."
"via colts9016"
"I wouldn't want to put away too many of these, but it's good for what it is."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"D: The beer tastes bigger than it is, deceiving in its innocuous strength. Not the best doppelbock around, but I'm pleased with it."
"Overall: A very malt concentrated beer with some other nice flavors to accompany it. The mouth feel has a nice alcohol warming to it. The finish is sweet inciting you to keep drinking."
"D: I wouldn't hit this one all night, but I will go back and grab some more to keep on hand. Really a good example of the style, and a solid beer all around. Especially the label. Ramfireytemplesquareawesomeness."
"This beer poured a rich caramel color. About an inch head that retained through most of the beer, decent lacing. The smell is rich with malt, caramel, and possibly a hit of chocolate. The taste is quite good. It's sweet and spicy - this is my first double bock so I have nothing to compare it too. Mouthfeel was decent in character, not too light and not too heavy. For my first double bock - it was highly enjoyable, I could see myself settling down to this for an evening."
"D: good drinkability alcohol is barely noticable, I could easily drink a few more."
"single bottle from a state liquor in slc while on business, brought back to va"
"This beer pours a clear reddish-brown color. The head is one fluffy inch in height, and recedes very slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is caramel, toffee, and roasted malt. The taste is very malty. It is full of caramel and nuts. It tastes more like a big brown ale than a doppelbock. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could drink again."
"D- Overall, this was a monster. It was very big on alcohol and very strong. I don't know if I would have this again. The doppelbocks I enjoy tend to be better with less alcohol. Go figure."
"Tastes wet malty sweet of toast, caramel, vienna chalk. Almost biscuity with a Liberty hop tinge. Hop flavor is blackberry, as if they used Northern Brewer. Clean alcohol flavor with noticable alcohol sting. Some cherry sour and mild hop bitterness. Hops and alcohol blend nicely and serve to provide an almost sun-baked drift-woody dry finish. Without this, the beer could have been sticky. Some tannin in the aftertaste is a bit of a detraction. Md body with some dextrins. Modest carbonation and decent drinkability."
"Drinks easy the ABV is well disguised, the dryness detracts a bit . A very good dopple IMO"
"Mouthfeel is a thin creamy texture. Great to try something new."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a good beer overall, but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
"D- great drinkability for a dopple bock, but mouthfeel is a bit thin for style, one of Wasatchs' better brews, worth a try"
"Taste: Carbonation is vivid and prickly, taste is quite similar to the smell, with the caramel just enough in the forefront to subdue the alcohol heat, which in turn brings all the flavors together. After drinking that many low ABV Beers, the mouthfeel on this one was quite powerful and I enjoyed it a lot."
"D: Pretty good, I enjoyed it."
"Overall- A very easily drinkable Doppelbock."
"Not a good example of this style."
"D - it's ok, but there are much better dopplebocks."
"This is not a bad beer, it just doesn't quite have enough richness and malt complexity for me. Because of this it is a bit disappointing, though the slight off-notes don't help things either."
"The mouth feel is a bit heavy for a bock which is surprising to me considering how clear it is. This is a full flavor beer that'll invigorate you; you'll enjoy the crisp flavor is this Wasatch beer unless you drink more than a few and then you'd better be ready. This isn't just any brew and for that I say ""thank You Utah Brewers for showing that smart people, even if they live in our region, can make GREAT beers!"
"The drinkability is off the hook due to not having the syrupy overpowering kick yo ass of most double bocks I have had, thus the 5.0. I could drink a sixer no problem... until I have to wake up the next morning. Job well done."
"Bitter-sweet malts and a powerful alcohol note make for an interesting flavor profile. Spicy hops, complex malts, and a fruity/peppery yeast note make this one a bit difficult to describe taste-wise. The body is of medium thickness, and slightly viscous. A syrupy-sweet finish ensues, bringing with it a behemoth alcohol warmth. Overall, this beer was okay, but it was missing something with respect to the Doppelbock style."
"D- I was expecting a heavier, darker beer than this, but I was not disappointed. I don't typically drink this style beer, so it would be hard to say if this is to style. If I were at a bar and this was the drink of choice, yes I'd have another."
"Drinkability pretty good for abv, even though it does show, but too sweet for too much. A nice one to warm up with."
"This is a nice brew, a bit thin for what I like for the style, but on the other hand that adds to its drinkability. Certainly worthwhile."
"Drinkability is this beers strong suit. Not an overly flavorful beer, but it is tasty enough, and very easy to drink considering that this is an 8% ABV brew. Not bad at all... worth a try."
"No doubt, I would buy this beer if I had it available to me... it may not be a strict doppelbock.. but a damn nice beer none the less. Another big thanks to John.. I feel sorta privileged to be one of the first reviewers of Devastator."
"Thanks again John for giving me a chance to taste this one."
"thanks to barefootbrewer for sharing this beer with me."
"This beer poured an amber color with a quickly dissipating head. The aroma is grainy, bread-like, and sour with the yeast noticeable. The taste is malty and sweet with some spice noticeable. The mouthfeel is full, but I would have enjoyed a bit more body. Overall, this is a very tasty brew. It seems to get more complex as it warms  definitely recommended."
"D: A pretty nice doppelbock, but somewhere in the midrange of quality compared with all those fine ones out there. Easy enough to drink, worth a try, but probably not a 'must have'. Still, I applaud UBC for adding this to their regular lineup..."
"Pours a super clean/clear dark golden brownish color, nice carbonation, small fizzy off-white head, very minimal sticky lacing. The nose is very malty, slight vanilla/sweetness, some spices, and lots of caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet at first sip, spicy, and lots of caramel. The alcohol is hidden very very well, just a slight warming effect. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, it's no where near a Celebrator, but it is nice, very drinkable. Also, I would consider this brew, more of an hyped-up amber ale."
"Pours a clear, orange-amber with golder edges. Thick finger of dense, clingy, light khaki head. Rummy fruit and sticky bun malt aromas with a spicy, vegetal hop backing. Light grainy-nuttiness with herbal hops up front. Sugary dark fruits and sweet bready malts swell, with a soapy edge. Faint cocoa and vanilla notes mix with cooked vegetables before a sticky, spicy, noble, mildly bitter hop finish. Medium body. A very clean, well-made doppelbock that is on the lighter side in terms of color. Nice!"
