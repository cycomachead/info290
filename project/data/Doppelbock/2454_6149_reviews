"pours a very dark brown, kind of reddish, dark brown. Smell is toffee with some hints of caramel and coffee. Taste is of roasted coffee . Smooth flavor, easy drink, but not an overly complex flavor."

"Overall, a fine beer, but the lack of sweetness on the palate with refreshing quality pushes it more towards the taste profile of a porter than a dopplebock to me."

"pours a very dark brown, almost black. nice pleasant rich malt aroma, a bit nutty. same with the taste. smooth and nice flavor, but one-note, not overly complex. easy to drink for a stronger beer. on the thicker side, low to medium carbonation level."

"Overall it kind of tasted like the porter I had from them but it should have been a bock. Lower score since it's no on par with the style."

"I know this beer strays from typical Dopplebock and leans on the porter side. But as a beer goes without trying to compare what it should be the flavor is tasty and probably my faviorate beer from Thomas Creek. Definitly one I will go back to and reccomend for more open minded less cynical beer drinkers :-}"

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 2/3/2012. Pours fairly clear dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass; with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, raisin, prune, toast, toffee, chocolate, molasses, floral, dark bread, light roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt notes with yeast fruitiness; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, dark bread, raisin, prune, toffee, molasses, chocolate, roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, molasses, dark bread, raisin, prune, roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt flavors with a light-moderate fruitiness; with nice robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good doppelbock! Nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a chilled glass, nice dark brown almost black color with a 3 fingered creamy tan head that stayed for a while, laced well on the glass. Aroma held roasted malts and chocolate hints, taste went the same way with some coffee in the back ground as well. With a medium mouthfeel it goes well with dinner as it drinks like a food course, rich and full flavored for sure. Overall a nice brew and I would try others from this brand, if you like Stouts and Porters you'll enjoy this for what it is."
"This beer pours up an absolutely beautiful obsidian black with a lucious 2 finger foamy caramel colored head, great retention, and awesome lacing. And right there the awesomeness ends. The nose, especially as it warms is malt and alcohol. At 6.25%, the odor of alcohol just shouldn't be present. Taste is more like a porter with some roasted nut notes and malt. The finish is a sort of burnt coffee flavor. Mouthfeel is sort of thin, but there is a decent amount of carbonation. I wouldn't refuse one of these, but neither would I search one out."

" I won't go out on a limb but I think the South makes a totally different Doppelbock from the North."

"Nicely put together brew. Will try several more times probably."

"The beer pours a deep red color with a tan head. The aroma is fairly sweet and has a lot of toffee and dark fruit notes. The flavor is similar, with some toffee and lightly roasted malt standing out the most. There is also a little bit of coffee. The beer is very dry overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"Perhaps a little hoppier and less full bodied than you'd want, but I enjoyed this one nonetheless. Not up there with the top examples of the style but deserving, in my opinion, of a higher rating than the one the BA community has bestowed upon it."
""
""
""
"O: pretty good example of an American dopplebock, but disappointing given the outstanding brewery that produced this."
""
"An okay doppelbock. Not the worst, not the best. Has a strange mixture of smoke and sweet candy flavors that doesn't sit well with me."
"o: This was clean and well made overall, I just wasn't quite big enough imo."
"Pours a very dark copper. Thin head that's gone almost immediately. Smells of toasted malt and light chocolate. A bit too highly carbonated...this gets in the way of getting a good taste right up front. The taste is of heavily roasted malt but the finish is watery. Nothing special."
""
""
"As this beer warms the flavors become something more akin to a traditional doppelbock. At first it was more like a porter meets lager, but after a little while it's a very delicious doppelbock. This is a great beer and another home run for Thomas Creek."
"I had a sample of this on tap at Brewgrass and this bottle isn't what this beer is supposed to be. Still, if you have dicey capping procedures, I reckon I'll let the review stand for the time being. I liked the sample I had, so I intend to give this one another shake."
""
"O - A pretty solid beer from Thomas Creek. I wouldn't pay a whole lot for it but that being said, I would definitely make this a session beer. I think it's tasty, smooth, and incredibly drinkable. 3.5"
""
"Medium bodied with a balance of sweet and smokey malts along with some zesty spice and bitter hops. Slightly acrid and dry with lots of deep roasted malt. Hints of burnt coffee bean, toast and dark chocolate along with some caramel, toffee and peppery spice. The ABV is well balanced but it's a bit harsh and one dimensional. Could use some balance with more sweetness. Again, doesn't really taste like a typical dopplebock."
"I was more into this brewery's double ipa ""up the creek""."
"Poured this into a pint glass from the bottle. Deep brown velvety pour with chocolate and vanilla aromas milling off the head with a slight touch of molasses and caramel sweetness. Smoothed out body enhances a sugary sweetness to the beer which is offset somewhat by a subtle dusty woody touch. Overall this brew has a nice dash of drinkability and deep complexity."
"A so-so example, light on the alcohol, light on the body, no really true to style in many ways. Good malt forward beer, just not up to doppelbock strength."
"D/O - Drinkability is pretty low. I hate to say this, because the first moments of this beer are highly enjoyable, but the sudden drop off really hurts it. If it could sustain the momentum that the initial taste delivers, this would be a nice doppelbock for sure, but the way I view it now is as something that could have been."
"This is actually a pretty darn good doppelbock. The flavor is not traditional, but it's very nice and fairly complex. Definitely a good beer. Recommended."
"The beer appeared a darker color, perhaps it was brown, and a thin white head sat on tap that was not all that well retained. The aroma was weak, light roasted malts, not much else. The taste was not that impressive, again some roasted malts and a touch of wood. The beer had a light feel to it; high on the carbonation...I didn't even finish the whole pint. Overall, a pretty weak beer all the way around and one that I will not go out of my way to have again."
"Also had this on tap at the Liberty in Greenville. I think I like the bottled version better. I have not been impressed with any of the Thomas Creek brews I've tried."
"O: it seemed like a lonely station at beertopia so i went over there to taste something. after tasting it, and i don't mean this as a put down, but i can see why they were a little lonely. nothing great. tasted okay. probably wouldn't order though in a bar."
"All in all, not the best doppelbock I have ever had but certainly not a bad beer. Could use a little more roasted malt and a little less of the little green cones in my opinion."
"Thomas Creek uses the right malts in Deep Water Dopplebock, they just don't use enough of them. There's some potential in this offering, but it needs to be fleshed out in a major way. Oh well, a buck and change for the single isn't going to break the bank."
"This dopplebock was very different than others I had become accustomed to. None of the sweetness or depth of flavor that endears me to this style. Drank more like a thin stout or porter, two styles I am not much of a fan of."
"Notes: A little on the sweet side for a doppelbock as well as a little thin. That said, it provides those nice dark, sweet fruity and bready flavors you expect. Not a bad doppelbock, but there are better ones out there."
"Clear, dark brown with a small tan head. A lot of chocolate in the aroma with some dark breadiness and dark fruit. Chocolate, cocoa powder and a coffee-like bitterness with a touch of raisin sweetness in the finish. Medium bodied with slightly harsh carbonation. While the potential is there, this one misses the mark a little but I still enjoyed it."
"Taste is thin but there are flavors of coffee and malts with a very dry finish. Very easy to drink, but much too thin for this style of beer."
"This is a bit of a mess, and for me requires an accompaniment of a meaty stew, rather than on its own or with cheese. For me Dopplebocks are more a treat, and this example, while worth trying, is well outside the style range."
"Overall impression: Very enjoyable dopplebock that went nicely with a medium-rare burger."
"Overall, this is my favorite Thomas Creek offering that I've had so far. A tasty, robust beer that looks good and goes well with a bit of cold weather and a hearty meal. Good showing, TCB."
"Taste was slightly toasted malts. Again, very mild. Gentle alcohol twinge. Weak mouthfeel. I guess it's kinda drinkable, just boring."
"D - Really easy drinking and great flavor, good show!"
"Very nice to drink. One of the better offerings from this brewery."
"single from the Charleston Beer Exchange"
"I would say this was one of the lighter beers of the style I have had.Poured a chesnut brown color with a thinner but pretty well sustained off white head,very light aromas,I picked up some caramel and a passing iron note.Flavors seemed to be a bit watered down to me,light caramel and dark fruit mainly with a little toasty malt,but again the flavors dont show through that great due to thin feel.Eh, an average to below average take on the style in my opinion."
"12 oz. Burgundy pour, solid cream colored head that stuck around nicely. Roast malt and humid smelling. Mostly malt, caramel, some mild red fruit and raisin. A definite creaminess to it. Didn't really get any coffee out of this. On the light end of medium body. Was fairly surprised by this one, drinkable, I enjoyed it. I thought this was slightly better than rated here."
"Drinkability: Not your typical doppelbock due to the somewhat bitter cocoa sweetness. Outstanding and easily drinkable. Put another one in the win column for Thomas Creek!"
"Medium body feels a bit light for a doppelbock. Not quite the meal in a glass others are. That said, the carbonation level is outstanding, and leaves a soft, plush texture. Maybe not your textbook doppelbock, but an enjoyable beer nonetheless."
"Very difficult to compare to anything. Nice complex flavor like a stout with a body similar to a porter."
"Nicely drinkable, but lacking some real character. It's fine, but won't be remembered in a month."
"Drinks easy enough, the dryness would probably make me move on before the ABV would. A pretty drinkable doople that has a few stylistic flaws, that makesthink this could be a porter, would've scored better..."
"Poured into a mug. Color was deep brown. Looked somewhat watery. Little to no head to speak of. Smell is mostly of roasted malts? Taste is more like a stout than a doppelbock, in my humble opinion. Mostly roasted malts. Some caramel sweetness in the background. A dry and slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery. Drinkability is descent. It's nothing great. There are much better Doppels out there. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"10oz serving on cask at Raleigh Times, with ""a special concoction of cocoa powders"" added to the mix. Only the second cask lager I've ever seen (Foothills Torch Pilsner being the other, passed over for the other two firkins offered that night) and the first I've had. The beer is a nice murkey brown with a decent frothy khaki head that diminishes to a thin layer that leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is a decent amount of brown malts and slight cocoa. The taste is a wonderfully smooth amount of brown malts with cocoa accentuating everything very nicely, especially in the finish. The beer is quite light and smooth. This one certainly benefits from the cask offering, very enjoyable. I'd love to see more Doppelbocks on cask."
"Drinkability: i enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability: It's not your typical doppelbock, with its somewhat unconventional use of chocolate and roasted malts, though I'm kind of digging that. I still fear an onset of infection would've been the future for this particular bottle, and, regrettably, I see no ""born on"" dating, so maybe stick to draft with this one."
"I could drink this all night, I'm not sure what it is, but it is delicious."
"Not a bad dopplebock but not the best example of the style. A little too sweet, like that of a poor brown ale."
"Drinkability: This hides the 6.25% abv well. I could have several. While this is not the best of the style that I have had, it is very good. I like the sweet caramel tones."
"Drinkability: Not all that great. The slightly thin mouthfeel, the acidity, and the burnt, roasted off-flavors that definitely do not belong in a doppelbock make this beer almost difficult to drink."
"M + D: It's got a nice little sting of carbonation on the tip of the tongue and on the roof of the mouth towards finish. Quite tingly. It's a touch thin, but not a complete deal breaker. I don't mind this one, and don't have a problem with finishing the six-pack... I don't know how eager I'd be to buy it in the future, though."
"D: This is an unexceptional beer. It's not horrible, it's not great either."
"Fairly drinkable, and a good attempt at the style, but off on a few marks, most notably the heavy presence of roasted and chocolate notes on the palate and the too-light-for-style body. Still, not a bad go from a somewhat-local brewing institution."
"First whiff when I opened the bottle was fruity and cider-like, while the second was smokier and maltier but still with a strong hard cider overtone. Pours an opaque chocolaty brown with a thick, frothy, not too persistent pale tan head. Flavor is rather wan, though - more like cider than beer, just a hint of malt and a touch of hops and smoke, and a little watery. Texture is thin and watery, like flat cola. I have had better, but this is OK."
"Also called the ""Deep Water Dopplebock"" on my label. Poured a deep brown, until held up to light and the redness really comes out. After this, the experience is a little bland The aroma is almost as deep as the color, but the intrigue seems to end there. Mouthfeel is quite decent almost reminiscent of a light porter, but the flavor is a little bland, and the alcohol definitely makes an appearance. Not bad, but not the best. I expected more from the guys that make a delicious vanilla cream ale."
"Roasted malts, a tad cola like in fizzy flavors."
"Had one on tap at the Thomas Creek Brewery Bash. Now called ""Deep Water Doppelbock"". Pours a dark almost black brown with a thick creamy head. Aroma is of dark roasted coffee and chocolate malts. The taste is what throws this beer off. Way off style, more like a cream stout that an doppelbock. Not a bad beer, just one I would not seek out."
"Smells sweet, with roasted malts. Taste like roasted malts too, but there's some sourness that really feels out of place. Well carbonated, but maybe only slightly too much so. Tastes better as the beer warms up (or my palate deadens further) but still not great."
"D: Decent drinkability for a doppel, especially with a respectable ABV of 6.25%"
"Drinkability - better as it warms, nothing grand but a tasty doppelbock session beer."
"I tend to favor local beers whenever I get the chance; TC definitely qualifies as a local brewery for me. Of the three I sampled (Amber, Doppelbock, and Pilsner) at dinner, the Doppel (excuse me, DOPPLE)bock was my favorite. It served as a stand-alone dessert after a great meal, but would pair nicely with good chocolate and ice cream, for certain. It would also be a winner with anything blackened (catfish, even). Not too sweet, not too bitter, a good balance. Definite coffee notes abound. A nice, oily finish stands out in my memory."
"Pours a rich, dark reddish brown with a substantial brown head. Good lacing. Smell of caramel/brown sugar with faint hops.Taste was caramel-coffee mix with a nice touch of sharpness from the hops What stays behind is the prmamry taste and a slight touch of hops. Chewy, medium-bodied mouthfeel medium with a very light apparent carbonation. Drinkability: Not bad."
"Overall, not appealing and not very true to style. I wouldn't return to this one."
"This is the best TC brew so far that I have tasted. Really not bad and drinkable for sure. I would have preferred a bit more going on with this one but with a few tweaks it could be something prett damn good. Thanks to mikesgroove for this one!!"
"A bit light for the style. Chocolate malt presents up-front, and the beer then thins out a bit too much. Some mild astringency that seemed out of place for the style. On the positive side, the beer was very smooth and the alchohol not at all prominent. Not on par with the traditional German doppels, and at best an average example of a more restrained American take on the style."
"D - Overall this was very good and my favorite from Thomas Creek thus far. Great consistency and highly recommended, nice try from the boys in Greenville."
"Thomas Creek is OK beer. I don't know what went wrong with this."
"Initially pretty strong with creamy coffee tones and enough carbonation to suit the style but loses its way before the finish and then regains its footing somewhat for a mellow, respectable aftertaste. While not containig the depth or complexity of a classic doppplebock, this is a pleasant sipper that has me giving props to the boys in the Palmetto state."
"this is an ok beer...not much hops to it...but nice and malty, not too sweet...goes well with burgers and fries.."
"12 ounce bottle. TCD-08 on label."
"Always a sucker for a Dopplebock...even the bad ones. This beer falls somewhere in the average catagory. More boldness and maltiness than usually found in American renditions. They really piled on the chocolate malts to bring out a robust flavor along with mild over-ripened fruits. After the initial sip subsides, faint flavors of baking soda (soapy) and vegetables (corn) begins to come through. The beer falls apart a bit in the finish giving off a cola-like sweetness and flavor. I still liked it pretty well though."
"Good, drinkable, a little too pronounced on the alcohol."
"Thanks goes to Ross from another place for this. poured a deep mahogany with a nice sized tan head that left some nice lacing. aroma, a ni ce sweet chocolate malt with dark cherries or is it choclate covered cherries? got some caramel when it warmed. Flavor sour cherries, bitter sweet chocolate, malt, alcohol."
"I had this beer on tap at the Knoxville Brewer's Jam 2001 and really enjoyed it. I haven't had it since then, until now, and wow was it better on tap. This pours well but even the nose is soapy and kind of foul. The taste is very similar to the smell. Not much on the front end and a bitter unpleasant bite at the end. I will need to test it on tap again, but if this bottle is indicative of the beer, I must have been drunk 5 years ago."
"Pours a dark brown to black with a decent head and some lacing. Smells strong of chocolate and coffee...not the most pleasent I have encountered either. The taste is definitely that of a stout more than anything else. Too watery and sour though. The flavor is decent but not exceptional. I would recommend trying it if you are into stouts and bocks but maybe not otherwise."
"This one was undrinkable, as well. It had the same awful characteristics."
"14/3.61"
"Aroma is tart and sickly smelling like rotting fruits. Dark brown/mahogany in color with a quickly fading tan head. Fore is more rotting/overripe fruits..syrupy mandarin orange notes. Chocolate and caramel malts behind that. The finish is decidedly watery and off tasting."
"This beer pours a dark chocolate brown with an off white head that is delightfully frothy. The head dissipates to a thin film that laces nicely down the glass. The beer smells mostly of semi-sweet dark chocolate and is quite nice. Unfotunately this beer seems to fall apart at the taste There is the same underlying chocolate taste but there is a very forward overy sweet almost bad candy like taste to the beer. This is very unenjoyable. The mouthfeel is not to bad with the thickness and carbonation. Overall I cannot say that I would grab this one again. Poor taste just leads to a poor overall experience drinking the beer."
"Great drinkability and a great beer from Thomas Creek. I will definitely sample this one again."
"This is an easy drinking beer. I do like it. Id drink a few in a row if I could. Ill beat the dead horse once more; this beer is lousy as a Doppel but tasty if you just drink it as is. Thanks timtheenchanta for supplying me some South Carolina beers!"
"Mouthfeel is quite thin for the style IMO and the carbonation is just too high...making this a one and done for me. Many other fine examples of the style, but glad to get the opportunity to try this offering from Thomas Creek."
"Not bad, but the roast is distracting for what should be a dark and yet smooth beer."
"-UF"
"Body is light to medium with a grainy and dry sort of texture. You really can't call this a dopplebock, more of a black lager or shwartzbier."
"Drinkability: Although it is not on point for the style - not quite a porter, not quite a doppelbock - but somewhat tasty"
"The thin body and the lack of strength made this a drinkable beer. Judged on its own merit, it is not half bad. But slapping a label proclaiming the contents to be a well known style does not make it so. And just for that atrocity, a few points were shaved off the rating."
" I was worried that the growler may go flat before I drank it all. Not to worry, it was gone before nite end. If you're looking for a bock, I say skip this one. If you're looking a really good, drinkable dark beer. This is up there. I've yet to have a Thomas Creek I don't like."
"9/16/02: Dopplebock? More like just a dark bock. It's a bit hoppier than I like for a dopple as well."
"Beer poured a pale brown and due to festival tasting and 2.5oz shot glass servings I couldn?t fairly judge the head. The aroma was of malt and hops. The taste was malty but fairly hoppy which I wasn?t expecting and didn?t really enjoy. Very dry as well, I will have to revisit this after I?ve tried other, but I wasn?t impressed."
"A little too thin and not malty enough to qualify as a true doppelbock in my opinion. Although the appearance is fairly good, it looked a bit too pale for doppelbock status. Taste was indeed on the malty side, but the hop bitterness didn't seem to fit well. It was quite drinkable, just not in the way it should be. A decent beer overall."
