Pours slightly cloudy dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, nuttiness, biscuit, herbal, toast, and light earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of raisin, biscuit, caramel, molasses, nuttiness, toffee, toast, light chocolate, and earthy spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, caramel, toast, nuttiness, toffee, light chocolate, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity; almost zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice doppelbock! Nicely balanced with good complexity; very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 24, 2012"

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a dark brown and w/ low lighting at bar almost black w/ a large tan head that disipates quickly and left spots of lace. A good blend of smells in the aroma as I pick up roasted malts as well as raisins and figs (the raisins I think is power of suggestion from the bartender) and some dark fruit like black cherry. Taste is more complex as a medium-bodied brew passes over my tongue remaining smooth, almost chewey, while finishing w/ a dry snap thanks to the alcohol flex. The high ABv gives the beer a warming sensation as you drink but doesn't overpower your tongue as you will def taste some sweet sugariness, some spiciness and minor citric/floral hopping and a good chunk of roasted malts in there. I found it very balanced and it is a hearty sipper to relax with.","clayrock81","Beers"
4.07,4.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured a dark reddish brown, with a translucent body. Transient tan head fades to some whisps and a thin collar. Nose of black licorice, molasses - big, rich malts and some generous sweetness. I can already feel the warmth. Taste is rich and comes across as almost syrupy initially, more molasses and licorice as the nose suggests. Sweet and sticky throughout, lingering sweetness and some dark fruits come through on the back-end. Sweetness is large and just borders on being inhibitive, but I was in the mood for this as I rated this. Quite drinkable for the alcohol content (beers just went down too easy that night), which isn't readily evident. Good, bone-warming stuff.","liamt07","0"

3.94,1,3,4,4,4,4,"Poured a 1/4"" off-white head which soon completely dissipated. Clear burnt umber brown in color but when held to the light it had maroon highlights. Both smell and taste are mega-malty. The higher alcohol has a burn presence plus there's a slight acidic zing which gives a pretty long finish. Body was medium light and less than I expected.

3.03,-22.3,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"This Doppelbock was a little different than I expected. It poured out like a normal Doppelbock with a really nice deep amber color and yellowish white head. The smell of the beer had some sweet malt aromas and and some subtle hops in the background. The taste was strange to me, it gave off this sour flavor for some reason. Perhaps a bad bottle but I'm unsure. The tase I was getting from this brew kind of hindered my thoughts of what started out as a good looking brew. The mouthfeel was medium and had a light carbonation to it. If it wasn't for the taste I would have enjoyed this much more. Perhaps having it again would be a good choice.","Knapp85","May 09, 2011"
4.24,8.7,4,5,4,4,4,"Sampled on May 10, 2011. It begins with a gorgeous deep mahogany brown-red pour with an inch of hed that settles down to a small, long lasting ring and leaves considerable lacing. These aromas are all over the place and quite exceptional with figs, molasses, licorice, dark fruits, and toffee. The body is medium to full.

Pretty plain. Mild dark fruits in the background. The flavor is really plain and the mouthfeel is fairly watery for a beer of this style and strength. Mild malt sweetness and a touch of caramel.

4.2,7.7,4,4,4.5,4,4," This beer is dark brown with a slight crimson tinge. the cream colored head dissapates quickly and turns to a thin film. Lacing is not real prominent, as the alcohol probably reduces it. Aromas consist of dried grains, caramel, toffee, some chocolate, and roasted notes. Hops aren't real present on the nose. Flavors are awesome! Dried dark fruit, horsefeed, toast, caramel, and even a slightly earthy quality envelop the tongue the minute this beer hits it. Hops round out the finish with a slightly dry, grassy character. Full bodied and chewy, this beer has alot going on. One of the creamiest doppelbocks I have tasted.

Almost no lacing on this beer. Smell is good, heavy on malts and darker fruits like dates and figs, sweet smelling. The taste picks up where the smell leaves off. Same tastes of dark fruits and a big malty flavor. Also notes of roasted barley with and with a toffee and buttery finish. Could have been power of suggestion, but I feel like you can taste a bit of the alcohol too, but not bad for being 9%. The mouthfeel is good, as light as a full bodied beer could be in my opinion, it's smooth. A pretty drinkable beer, more of a sipper though in my opinion. Cracked it open Christmas evening of 09.

Taste is roasty and toasty, hints of coffee and chocolate, semi-sweet, light dark fruit, some grape, a bit of burnt caramel. A bit astringent for my taste. Bitter and dry on the finish. Lightbodied, almost too thin for the style. Carbonation is overly-lacking, doesn't give the light a body a real pop. A bit thin, a bit watery, not enough body for a good Dopple.

Mouthfeel is thin but smooth. This has got some balls to it at 18 proof but goes down fairly easy and I'd drink two or three at a time if I had them available. This is an above average doppler and worth looking out for.","daliandragon","Feb 22, 2007"
3.67,-5.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Chilled and poured into small pilsner glass. The head rose and fell, lingers about a centimeter off the surface with off white foam. The body is dark mahogany with warm brownish red highlights around the edges. Smell is fruity and aromatic, notes of barley, hay, rum or brandy soaked spiced fruitcake with some dark fruits like plums, rasin candied cherries and nuts. I also get notes of chocolate, hints of cinnamon and caramel the whole thing reminds me of a fruity bunt cake. Taste is similar to the smell, with lots of richness. Very chewy mouth feel nice helping of caramel notes, rich malty chocolate flavor balanced with generous hop bitterness. Alcohol is present in the taste, but not a deterrent especially in the light of the rum cake character. Personally the bottle is enough for me I doubt I could drink more than one in a sitting. I very much enjoyed this brew however Id personally prefer a slightly more complex yet alcohol subdued doppelbock like celebrator. All the same this a good representation of a doppelbock well worth a try, especially if you could compare it to its European counter part.","mmcave","Feb 18, 2007"

Aroma was very malty with some dried fruit and maple present. Taste was very reminiscent of maple syrup, some caramel malts and dried fruit show up as well. There is a good level of carbonation and nice alcohol warmth in the mouthfeel. While this isn't at the top of my list when it comes to dopplebocks, this is a very enjoyable beer.","atsprings","Feb 09, 2007"

Slightly smoky, rich malt, with stewed fruits, brandy, and a tartish, vinous character. Sugary, malty, dark fruity flavors dominate up front. Toasted, spicy, vegetal hop edge flashes here and there around mild chocolate, licorice, and tobacco. Light, vinous tangy to it; maybe even a little tart and sour creamy in the otherwise woody, bitterish finish. Nice complexity to this doppel and I'm pleased that it's not too sweet. Medium-bodied with an almost dry feel. Goes down very easily!","alexgash","0"

3.65,-6.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a ruddy brown with a small tan head that dissipates quickly. Carbonation is active and tiny-bubbled releasing a bouquet of roasted malts and toasted walnuts. Not much in the way of fruits. Taste is malty, but the bitterness of the walnut that was in the nose comes through in the taste. This might be a welcome and interesting flavor for some, but I am not a bitter nut fan. The mouthfeel starts off fine, but the oils in the finish thin this out too much. Good, but not great. One or two at most is plenty. Certainly affordable though. My 500ml bottle was $2.50.","pentathlete","Dec 03, 2006"

Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied. Hard to believe this beer is 9% cause I sure as hell can't taste it. Drinkability is good for a beer of this strength.

Nonetheless, this beer pours with a deep, deep red color, thats translucent only when held up to a bright light. Smell is deep and malty, mostly of the dark kind. Taste is terrific and heavy, with nothing really developing until about half way through the trip down, then it really bursting with malty goodness.","Toddv29424","Jul 27, 2006"

Sugary molasses, caramel, a touch of burnt toast, clove, and alcohol in the nose. Very clean, but nearly empty of flavor; slightly sweet syrupy malts up front with hot fusel alcohol finish. Almost still oily and syrupy body. Not a beer I'll revisit. The aroma is OK, but the flavor is almost entirely missing apart from the over-strong alcohol.","dgallina","Jul 24, 2006"

I would expect that it would be more dry or more rich, but it just sat in the middle. The recipe is supposed to be from 1609 so I guess if they called it a Doppelbock back then, they are grandfathered in on the convention. I like it quite a bit, I just wasn't expecting what I got. It does go great with a good sausage though. Also, this beer doesn't seem quite at 9% Alcohol.","xymyl","Jun 12, 2006"
4.2,7.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured out into a flute, this was quite dark in color, and had a two finger head at first. The head faded quickly to a very thin ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. As can be expected with a 9% ABV beer, there was not much lacing. The aroma was very rich, with the dark Munich style malts allowed to emit a toasty sweet smell. The taste was also sweet, but not cloying. The dark fruit ester taste was very dominant here, and was followed shortly by a spicy phenolic kick. Although they did not use any malted wheat in this recipe, this was somewhat similar to a Weizenbock. This was quite an easy beer to drink considering all the complexity and strength. No wonder this Abbey/Brewery has been around since 1330.","rajendra82","Jun 11, 2006"

4.11,5.4,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I haven't had it since then until now in June 2008. (I wiped out my old review and replaced it with this one.) This new bottle tastes much more like a traditional doppelbock than what I found back then. I'm not sure if the difference is with me or with this bottle. Whatever the case, I like this bottle quite a bit better. This brew (still) pours with almost no head, but the aroma is nice. It smells sweet with a dark, dried, fruit aroma. The taste further expands on the aroma. The body is quite heavy, and there's very little carbonation. There's a slight spiciness, but otherwise it tastes of long-boiled toffee/melanoidin malts and dark stewed fruit. This beer definitely has ""that special German bock character"" which rarely seems to find its way into bock beers produced in other countries. It has that lovely dark, malty flavor, but without a roasted character which you sometimes find in other inferior non-German bock beers. This Curator is the real deal. Add some more carbonation and this d-bock might be one of my all-time favorite bocks.","ohmybock","0"
