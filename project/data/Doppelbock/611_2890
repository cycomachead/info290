3.56,-3.5,4,3,4,3,3.5,"Wagner Valley Sled Dog Doppelbock pours a completely clear mahogany to maroon. There are gobs of cherry highlights when the beer is properly backlit. There are about two fingers of light caramel foam crowning the beer. Head retention is alright, but lacing is a nonentity. Not a huge hang up for me given the style though. The nose doesn't come through super well, but what is there is solid. It's a roughly 50/50 blend of plum and fig fruitiness and rich toffee. The flavor is a bit more potent, and brings a bit more variety to the table. Dark fruits and caramel still carry things, but there are secondary notes of biscuit and milk chocolate that give the beer a greater depth of flavor. The carbontion is nice and low, it keeps out of the way of the malts. The body though, just isn't full and rich enough for such a big malty beer. Sled Dog is a solid doppelbock, and one that I would certainly drink again. I don't think I'd seek it out though.","axeman9182","Oct 30, 2011"

4.2,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is my first taste of Wagner Valley (Vineyards) and I'm duly blown away. I like the label although I like the packaging for their IPA slightly better. Pours smooth, a dark ruby color with a struggling off white head (either because of the alcohol, or more likely from my glass). Huge malty sweet, brown sugar aroma that is impossible to avoid. The flavor is not overcomplicated, 4-5 flavors that are used well: brown sugar, malt, prune, and I swear something like a ripe apple in the back end, but maybe another ripe fruit would be more appropriate to describe it: lets say Asian pear to be really fancy. The mouth feel is silky with a medium to full body. The finish lingers for what seems like hours. If there are hops detectable it is only slight and maybe in the finish but balanced beautifully. My only concern is maybe a tad too carbonated...and in all fairness maybe I served it slightly warm, but it did foam up a bit on initial taste; however, this is nitpicking and in the grand scheme of things unnecessary.","alexkeil","Mar 20, 2011"

Aroma is hard to describe, more like molasses mixed with wheat husk mixed with some hard sugar candy. Taste is a mix of malts, tart and sweet fruitiness. The ABV slowly takes over after a few sips, mouth feel is good. Decent lacing, indeed a different double bock beer, very complex and is definitely worth a try.","CaptDavyJones","Nov 29, 2010"

4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pretty good Dopplebock in my opinion. Poured it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Has an amber/brown color that has good clarity to it. It had a cray slightly orangey creamy colored head. All in all a pretty good looking beer. The smell is good, very sweet. Mostly compiled of sweet malts, and dark fruits. Has a sweet toffee type aroma as well. The taste is also pretty sweet has all the characteristics of the smell, maybe a little heavier on the darker fruits and has an aftertaste of butterscotch. I thought that you couldn't taste the hops at all until about a minute after one of the sips, it's feint, but present. The mouthfeel is really good too, pretty creamy and smooth, reasonably full bodied. Only a slight bitter bite from the hops, more like a little pinch on the back of the tongue. Pretty drinkable beer of this style, nice sipper on a winter night.","AndyAvalanche","Jan 30, 2010"

4.24,14.9,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Starts off underwhelming. Didn't even tip the glass when I poured, and it didn't really come close to overflowing. In other words: very weak head, and little lacing. However, the smell is big and malty, with sweet caramel and dried fruit dominating. The taste is pure doppelbock; bready malt, caramel, nuts, and dark fruit, with a bit of a sharp bitter aftertaste. I really liked this one, and the cherry on top? It was brewed just twenty minutes from where I grew up in the Seneca Lake.","tlinner","Dec 12, 2009"

Aroma is sweet maltiness and fruits, some strong melon aroma with some cherry and darker fruit as well. Taste shows a hint of the fruit but is overwhelmingly a sweet malt powder taste. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly thinner than I expected from the aroma, or maybe its just my perception from the low levels of carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste, just a gentle warmth and somewhat drying finish lets you know its there. Overall not a bad doppelbock, the taste was a little to straight up carnation malted milk for me, I could have used some other flavors to mingle with the sweetness, no problem finishing the beer however.","hoppymeal","Jun 10, 2007"

The smell is malty cola, with butterscotch and floral notes. The beer is a deep mahogany with reddish highlights when held up to the light. The taste is similar to the smell in having a deep roasted malt character along with that butterscotch twist. Very light gummy bear and floral hops add an edge to the overwhelming maltiness. In the aftertaste there is a nice nutty taste that I enjoy in Belgians and American and English Brown Ales. The alcohol is also covered up very well.

A creamy/bread flavor appears a bit in the aftertaste that is actually quite enjoyable. Mouthfeel is quite smooth. The only real issue i had with this beer was the complete absence of hops which takes away from its balance. Alcohol isn't present which makes this quite drinkable for an 8.5% abv.

I last had it at their brewery on Seneca Lake, near Ithaca, NY about 7 months ago, but I don't get the pleasure of drinking this beer as often as I'd like. The brewery is also a vineyard and it is situated on one of the most beautiful pieces of land I've ever seen. They have a huge outdoor deck where you can sit and drink pitchers or pints of their beers while looking across and up and down the lake. It seems like you can see for 50 miles in every direction. The sky seems to go on forever. I'm thinking about that view as I taste this and I'm dreaming of going back this summer and hopefully sharing a pitcher of this with a friend. I suggest you do the same. And certainly try this if you can find it.","johnniemarg","Feb 04, 2006"

There's a sort of cherry flavor that kicks in towards then, and it all fades as the alcohol warms your stomach in the finish. I bought this out of the cooler at the brewery just over a week ago, so I doubt it's old.

Very smooth. Flavor is similar to nose witha mix of chocolate, red grapes, toffee and dark fruit. Very rich and lingering syrupy sweet palate coating finish.

Hard pour generated a couple bubbles, but no head over a somewhat cloudy brown liquid (had a reddish tinge when held to light). Smells of caramel, chocolate, and alcohol. Bock character is present, but much more subdued than I was expecting. Tastes sweet with noticable alochol. This beer is thick, sweet, and lightly (not?) carbonated. Some bock character is present as is a hint of chocloate and/or roasted grains. An acceptable doppel. Where's the carbonation?","mentor","Mar 10, 2005"

Taste is very similar to what the nose portends, which is a good thing. The dark fruits and alcohol become even more pronounced on the tongue.

I'm traveling to the Finger Lakes this weekend, and planning on making a trip to Wagner. I'm going to give this one another try at the source.

The colour was reddish brown with a nice head but the first taste was pretty bracing. I noticed a predominate sweetness that never really left the beer. The malts and hops were out front but a lack of balance and finesse made this beer suffer in the drinkability area. Kind of reminds of Dick's beer from Washington; a bit unrefined but ambitious in attack.","canucklehead","Mar 23, 2004"

I could criticize this beer for lacking some of the spicy, zesty hops that most German doppels posess. Also the mouthfeel is crisp, clean and refreshing, instead of sticky and cloying like most German dopps. Furthermore, the flavor is roasty and alive, instead of being the sweet, caramelized, austere, wood-varnish, difficult-to-finish, cloy-fest that many other doppelbocks are. Maybe I'm being harsh on the style in general, but this is a damn good beer! Forget style connotations, do yourself a favor, and enjoy. There's a maple-syrup/brown-sugar forest vibe oozing from the brew (makes sense since this brew comes from the coniferous northern climes of this fair land), and the yeast is magnificent: alive, fruity, robust, healthful. Anyway I should just say, simply: I really like this beer. Any extraneous exuberance or verbiage can be attributed solely to the 8.5%","Thrasher","May 29, 2003"
