This brew pours a crystal clear brownish red with a nice off white head of tight beaded foam that settles to a thick ring and light lacing.  Nose of some of the usual suspects.  Rich caramel malts, a hint of toffee, a little bit of nuttiness, and a hint of raisins.  Absent would be the bread notes.  Flavors follow the nose with sweetly roasted malts, a light raisin flavor to the rear, and a light nutty aftertaste.  Still absent is the liquid bread goodness known in the style.  Finishes lightly sweet and roasted.  Makes a decent enough session brew, but a little lacking in the doppelbock category.","Brutaltruth","Mar 20, 2015"

3.28,1.5,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer, but I didn't think it was a good example of the style, it just seemed to roasty for a Doppelbock and the big nutty aspects felt out of place too, to me it tasted similar to creamy dark with less roasted flavors and more nutty flavors.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was very smooth, pretty crisp, slightly prickly, a little creamy, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these, especially in the spring time.  What I like the most about this beer was the was the taste, it wasn't bad tasting beer, it just wasn't true to style.  What I liked the least about this beer was how off from the style it was, there's no way I would guess this is a Doppelbock if i tried it blind.  I might buy this beer again, but not if I want a good Doppelbock.  I think this beer is worth trying, but if your expecting a true to style Doppelbock you will disappointed.  All in all I liked this beer, I just didn't think it was a Doppelbock, to me it tasted much more like a brown Ale.  It's  not a favorite from this brewery and it's one of my least favorite Doppelbocks.  I appreciate the effort, but I think this beer should just be rename and just start from scratch, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Mar 02, 2015"

Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, molasses, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, molasses, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, molasses, light chocolate/nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid doppelbock style. All around good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. The mouthfeel and robustness of malt flavors were lacking, but the taste was generally what I expected in the style. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 20, 2015"

Doesnt fulfill my German beer cravings the way it should but its a decent shot and better than the Leine wheat beers with apple, honey, raspberry, etc. (2.5) Mouthfeel is in the light to medium body range with some substantial light syrupy textures carbonation is a bit too much but doesnt ruin the experience.

All malt (the chocolate kind) in the nose with the same in the first sips. A subtle tartness follows and then a touch of bitter roasted flavor that is really a great change of pace from the heavy flavor I expected. This is not a sweet beer and that makes it even better.

It had an aroma of dry spicy hops with just the slightest touch of roasted caramel malts. When I swirled it around, a mild whiff of cantaloupe emerged. When it warms up, the cantaloupe aroma gets a little stronger and conquers the spicy hops and malts. I don't want to know why there was cantaloupe in the aroma. The taste was WEAK and THIN! Not only that, but the flavors weren't good either. The taste was that of bitter hops with a dash of caramel, a hint a roasted malts, and with a slight alcohol head butt at the end. It was more hoppy than malty and that just doesn't seem right to me. What isn't right is all those weak and thin flavors in this beer. The mouthfeel was way too light, heavily carbonated, and with an aftertaste that has more taste in it than what's in initial taste. The roasted malt aftertaste should have been in the initial taste instead of showing up late in the aftertaste. Basically it looked really nice, but looks can be deceiving.

Aromas a quite faint, but do include all of the necessary dried fruits, light spiciness (lowly hopped) and malt heavy sweetness. The flavors show an emphasis on the malts with lighter fig, dates flavor with backup flavors of nuts, smokiness, and chocolate. Though the flavors are present, the are light. Thus the beer tastes and feels under-malted and not as full and round as needed. The overcarbonation proves distracting. The beer shows a raw grain flavor late with a mild grain husk astringency.

The mouthfeel was not so pleasant, the overcarbonation combined with the bite of flavor take away from the experience. It is an ok beer to drink, but I recommend the other offerings from Leinenkugel's. They have the best cheap beers around.

If you are considering trying Big Butt, be forewarned that it should be drank at 40-45 degrees. This brew gave an aftertaste that smacked of stale coffee when warm. I was impressed with a rich creamy tan head that poured out. It dissapated quickly and left little lacing for the rest of the beer.

It pours a nice dark brown and with a tanish head. It goes down with a light sweetness followed by a roasty malt and molasses profile.

One dimensional, and thin in malt character from the excessive filtration. Weak body, with a watery mouthfeel. Low hop bitterness allows the paltry malt character to present itself as brown sugar like residual sweetness. Finishes dry and slightly husky. Big Butt is an utterly forgettable, half - ass effort of the style. It's about as much of a ""Doppelbock"" as Sam Adams's Cranberry Lambic is a ""Lambic.""
