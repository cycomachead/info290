Color is a clear amber cherry with some bubble trails. Aroma is a pleasing blend of toffee, caramel, malt, roast, fruit. Flavor's much like nose plus coffee, toast, and just enough bitter and carbonic tang to balance. Body is great while carbonation is perhaps a touch light. Finish is average length and very easy drinking although after a bit some booze comes thru. Wish I could get more.","drpimento","Mar 12, 2013"

Smell is of dark bready malt, brown sugar, chocolate and hints of roast and coffee, some darker fruits, raisins, nice yeasty presence as well. Taste is quite sweet up front and almost unpleasant, once the sweetness subsides dark fruit and bread comes through, chocolate, coffee in the finish, some astringency as well, alcohol is quite noticeable at points. Tastes better about halfway through than it did at first. Light-med carb, full body, syrupy and sticks to your palate. For a style that I have started to gain lots of appreciation for in the last little while this offering is fairly mediocre, great nose but the taste leaves lots to be desired, average drinkability but wont be seeking this out again.","peensteen","Mar 13, 2012"

Nice aroma of dark fruits, raisins, nuts, earthy malts, bit of spice and some caramel. Good, strong flavours without it being overpowering or bold. Lots of caramel throughout, with the fruits and malts rounding out. Very little bitterness; what is their seems to be from roasted malts. Very smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Quite soothing, actually. Deceptively drinkable. One could view this as a session beer, until the 7.2ABV kicks in. Asides from a poor appearance, a wonderful beer.","slitherySOB","Dec 28, 2010"

3.87,0.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"There is very little hops to speak of, but it does finish clean and robust. There is even a slight spice hidden at the end to help clean this beer off your palate.

Taste of dark fruit, prune, very forward but with a syrupy texture and mouthfeel, only a little bitter in the middle and hardly any malt as far as I can tell. Alcohol quite noticeable, heavy, dense body; sweetness of the darker fruit increases with air. I'm not a fan of this style and this offering doesn't convert me.

4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Big initial foam, settles swiftly down to a thin coating of off-white cream across the surface, no real lacing. Mahogany brown with strong red and lesser yellow tints, closer to transparency than opacity. Milk chocolate, rum raisin ice cream, molasses sweeten the nose immediately, finds balance in accents of rye bread, wheat, brazil nuts and almond slivers, while allowing for fig, date, plum fruit scents, stays full a good long while without getting tiring. Medium-bodied, active carbonation adds sizzle to the mouth entry so you can take more time to adjust to the newfound sweet thing swirling about your tongue. Probably less thick and syrupy than many any Doppelbock beers, not to say there's a paucity of caramel, brown sugar, chocolate goodness, same for the plum, date, fig, maraschino cherry fruit flavors. Here you get less of that rye, pumpernickel bread bite yet it's definitely there alongside unshucked corn, raw nuts and a soft yeastiness.

There were some hops springing to my nose and a faint smell of malt, but not really a good smell here. The taste, on the other hand, was phenomonal. One of the smoothest and creamiest beers I've had in a long time, but still manages to pack a malt wallop with bread, coffee/cocoa, caramel and I'm sure other things (like brown sugar) that I'm missing, but I hope the point comes across. Balanced well, it has a slightly dry aftertaste while also maintaing its sweetness. If it wasn't so filling after a bottle and also a little up there in ABV, I'd session this - nonetheless, if you haven't tried this do so ASAP.","clayrock81","Apr 20, 2008"

4.32,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark mahogany brown with amber highlights and magnificent clarity. A very dense and creamy one and half finger head of pale biege foam shows passing retention and spotty lacing. Deeply roasted crystal malts and fragrant honey aromas dominate, with a rich vinous scent and spicy german hops in the background. Dark caramel and rasin/berry phenols strike the tounge first, then robust and bready dextrins deepen the malt profile. The dark honey and wine character appear again, but are subtle and compliment the malt sweetness. Light but balancing noble hops in the aftertaste- soft and floral like Hallertau with a very mellow bitteness. A suggestion of alcohol further puts the formidable malt flavor in check while adding a degree of complexity and becomes more apparent as it warms. The body is full and the carbonation is light- allowing a residual sweetness to coat the tounge-only offset by mild hops and a hint of booze. The beer finishes rich with malt flavor and gentle steely caramel but not syrupy or cloying; it remains highly quaffable to the last sip due to its uncanny smoothness. An outstanding example of the style; luckily it is both common and inexpensive where I live!","PBRstreetgang","Mar 12, 2008"

Thin, foamy head on top which fades quickly. Big foamy bubbles collect along the sides as the head dissipates. Sweet, malty fruit aroma. Dates and raisins. Maybe some vanilla. Some plum hidden deep in there as well. Tastes sweet and malty as well, with some of the same raisiny-date flavors. Finishes tart, with a smokey aftertaste; I don't think I've ever quite had a beer finish like this before. It's interesting, if nothing else. Weird aftertaste, for sure. A little thin in the mouthfeel, but tends to become a bit chewier as it sits and warms up. This is not unusual for most doppels that I've had. The alcohol is slightly noticeable here, but does not detract from the overall odd characteristics of this beer. It's probably not one that I'll come back to, but it's worth checking out if you're a fan of doppelbocks. I am, and this one is unlike any others I've had.","Atlas1","Feb 12, 2007"

Not necessarily unpleasant flavors but they are not well-balanced. Thin, prickly, somehow greasy mouthfeel is very, very twangy; slightly sweet aftertaste. Drinkability starts out okay, but is impaired by the imbalances and my growing disinterest. At least the alcohol is well-disguised. Not awful, but nowhere even near worth the $5.50 I paid for a 1/2 liter bottle.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Jan 28, 2004"
3.45,-10.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a dark brown with a decent head that went away pretty quickly. Scents of dried fruits and dark malty bread. Taste was just OK. Typical Dopplebock malty sweetness, Mouthfeel was a bit undercarbonated leading to believe that the seal had been comprimised. The drinkability was OK . Overall there are 7-8 dopplebocks I can think of that I would rather have than this one.","TinusTime","Jan 12, 2004"
3.42,-10.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer came in a half-liter bottle with a swing-type top. Sweet, malty, distinctively dopplebock-esque aromas escape on the pour. Appearance is a deep mahogany color in a clear, nearly still liquid. Slight, creamy head that quickly disappearsI shouldnt have been surprised, since the carbonation is negligible. Toasted malt flavor throughout. Pleasing dopplebock sweetness, but not as well matched with the aroma as a Celebrator or Salvator. Also, the beer is a little lighter bodied than a top-notch dopplebock. Slightly annoying metallic tinge. Finish is lingering, but not really cloying. The bottom line is that this is a decent, but not outstanding example of the style.","Suds","Jan 10, 2004"
2.65,-31,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Not very drinkable, not something I'd try again. Not a good doppelbock, not malty enough, too many off flavors. Not something I'd even like without weighing as a Doppelbock.","mschofield","Jan 07, 2004"
3.75,-2.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"poured a chestnut brown with a thin head. The smell was all sweet malt sugary sweet and the taste was much the same. Plum and caramel flavors predominate. Paired with a hunk of parmesan regiano made for a nice contrast, Good body nice for the style. The fairly high abv was well disguised. Good beer for an occasional, but couldn't do too many more than two, maybe three.","counselor","Jan 03, 2004"
3.8,-1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The most obvious thing about this beer is the cool bottle, another great find at my local farm market that decided to become a craft beer store, no complaints here. pours a medium brown with a small tan head, chocolatey malty nose with a medium bodied malty taste. Not the most overpowering of the style, but a keeper none the less.","jtw5877","Dec 13, 2003"
3.97,3.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste is very smooth for a ""bigger"" beer (7.2%). Lower in carbonation than I expected for this style of beer. I wouldn't say under-carbonated, just not what I expected. The ending has a great balance of bitterness and sweetness. I would buy this beer again and will share with friends.","CharlesRiver","Nov 25, 2003"
3.75,-2.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Dark brown yet very transluscent. The head quickly subsided. When first poured it had a slight fruitiness, banana. Once the head subsided it has the malt, sweet, raisin aroma. The flavor is malt and alcohol. It is sweet on the tongue and then fades into caramel and alcohol in the finish. The body is big and round. The drinkability would be higher is there was not so much alcohol in the finish.","GCBrewingCo","Nov 01, 2003"

2.86,-25.5,4,3,3,2,2.5,"Another sticky sweet doppelbock. Soy, caramel, toffee, with some roastyness/burntness and some chocolate, not much in the finish, minimal bitterness. Too upfront and sweet. Sometimes this style really impresses me (Andechser, Celebrator), and other times its one of my least favourite dark beer styles, but some nice flavours.","rastaman","Sep 08, 2003"
3.62,-5.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I thought this was a good doppelbock, but nothing exceptional. Poured a dark mahogany, with a big tan head. Smell was dark and toasty, with hints of dark fruits and molasses. Taste was dark, toasty and a little bit chewy, but not as complex as some doppels I've had. This beer sneaks up on you. It doesn't seem to have the amount of alcohol it has, and I think a number of them could have quite an effect on you.","woemad","Aug 19, 2003"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A clear mahogany body is capped by a short head of dense tan foam which fades away shortly but maintains a creamy collar and initially leaves some minor spotty lace. Although the nose is somewhat restrained and lacks the rich Munich malts found in many examples (ie. Optimator); it is fairly complex with a gentle touch of fruit (apple, soft prune, mild background cherry), deeply caramelized sugars, and a waft of mineral character. In the mouth it's very fine carbonation gently tingles the tongue; thinning and smoothing out the medium/just-bordering-on-full body. The flavor delivers some light fruit upfront; followed by a rich, deeply toasted and caramelized molasses-like maltiness as it warms across the palate. The bitterness is quite evident beneath the malt at this point - suggesting that it will finish bone dry - yet it oddly fades away as the sweet but deeply toasted malt steps forward to linger on the palate. It's crisp and refreshing then as the malt erodes and some dark fruit steps back in; leaving an impressive and complex finish! A very unique Doppelbock that holds enough malt to satisfy, and is exceptionally well-balanced. The alcohol is very well-hidden; and except for the fact that it does eventually hit you, this is a really drinkable doppelbock. Most impressive!","NeroFiddled","Jun 29, 2003"

3.5,-8.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours an unambiguous mahogany color with the head light tan and miniscule in size, the residual lace patchy. The nose is plummish, caramel, sweet and underpinned by the malt, fresh and pleasant I would say, start is cloyingly sweet, loaded with malt, the top is middling in its feel. Finish has a delicate hop spicy bite, the acidity assertive and the aftertaste dry and linger, a Celebrator or Optimator it aint, but drinkable nonetheless.","Gusler","Mar 28, 2003"

4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Clear, deep ruby color. Fair/decent head following a vigorous pour. Aroma consists of dark ripe fruit, toasted caramel, molasses and chocolate. The flavors are intensifying as this warms. More pronounced are the chocolate malt and dark fruits, which have become more defined...prune-like. Alcohol warms the throat. A good doppelbock will leave you feeling as if you've just had a treat, and this one is no exception. Very nice.","John","Oct 13, 2002"
4.36,13.5,5,4,5,3,4,"Redish Brown in color, this Doppelbock look more like a Salvator then an Optimator. It has a nice body to it but it could be better. Although it doesn't have the richness of an Optimator it have a beautifully deep and complex malt. Small bitter to balance and a nice little fruityness. All and all a good upstanding Doppel.","mattmaples","Oct 06, 2001"
