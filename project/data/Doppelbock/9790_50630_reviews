"O: Quite a solid beer. Not classically like a dopplebock, but that's not a bad thing. Drinkable."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: What a very interesting beer. i wish I had a bigger glass of it to work out all the flavors. Very drinkable - this went down quickly and then that higher ABV let me know it was there. I could easily see myself getting a 6 pack of this next time I can do so. It reminds me a bit of Ayinger Celebrator, but not as deep in flavor. The mouthfeel was a tad disappointing for this style, but otherwise a very good beer."

"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed vase, the beer is a auburn-highlighted brown coloring with a thin, sparse, cream colored surface coating of head. Aromas of rich toffee and caramel forward, with date, raisin, and cherry sweet and rich highlights. Roasted highlights keep the sweet reigned in, making this a very balanced nose. Flavors are roasted heavily on the forward tongue, with rich toffee, chocolate, and caramel notes. The old-world fruit characteristics are present in highlight form, and there are some earthy notes, as well. This is a tasty malt-bomb! Smooth and robust in mouth, with a slight effervesced edge to keep the drinkability up. The aftertaste is surprisingly crisp, keeping all the sweet characteristics from becoming overpowering. Smooth, slick finish with only a minimally sweet linger thanks to the carbonation. Solid brew!"
""
"Peace!"
"The Rest: Really, really good. This is a top-notch Dopple. Great balance, great flavor - I really enjoyed this one."
"O: The mouthfeel on this is weird as it starts out syrupy an thick then kinda thins out. The aroma is fantastic and the taste delivers nicely as well. Rich roasty meal in a glass."
"O: an exceptional dopplebock worth seeking out."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of low intensity, resulting in a mostly smooth (9/10) mouthfeel with just a touch of foaminess (1/10) that results in very slow sips of a lingering nature. Some more carbonation could be present and the beer would benefit in both aromatics and drinkability. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness lingering on the palate, just right for the style."

"O: This beer has very good drinkability for the style—it isn't bogged down with malty flavors or much in the way of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall –This one has nice and big sweet flavors with lots of malt. A rather tasty doppelbock that is well worth a try."
"The beer appears a dark shade of mahogany with a half inch of foamy beige head. The aroma offers dark malts, brown sugar, bread, alcohol, ripe plums, raisins. Sweet brown bread, cookies, alcohol, yeast. Definitely true to style. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A solid beer."
""
""

""
""
"O: I think this is a really nice example of the style that is quite enjoyable. Alcohol is pretty well hidden and it is easy to drink."
""
"Poured a brownish body with one-finger offwhite head that died a slow death with no lace. A thick, rich aroma, mostly bready and roasted malts along with some dark chocolate sweetness. Taste and mouthfeel is more of the same as the beer is thick, fuller-bodied, not sticky nor watery but a nice thick smoothness, mixed roasted and breadlike malts for dryness with dark chocolate, toffee, and caramel for sweetness. Not typical of other DBs I've had in terms of the dryness and the finish, which is less sweet more dry, and not much in terms of any fruit flavors at all (can't say I really got a hold of any dark fruits or minor citric hops) but still a pretty good beer."
"Overall have to agree Duck Rabbit is the dark beer specialist, they sure got this one right. Glad I was finally able to get some of this one just never seemed to be in NC when it was released."
""
"O - This is a really odd doppelbock. Not a huge fan of the style, although this is better than most I have encountered. Lots going on here... I can see where the hype comes from, just not for me."
"Overall: Potent in many of its aspect, it's not the best doppelbock to be had, though, I'm sure you could do worse."
"overall: Nice Dopple. Not a standout imo, but decent enough brew."

"Another great Duck-Rabbit beer, and a solid doppelbock that I'm happy to have made in NC. Really need to make that trip to Farmville!"
"Not a bad Doppelbock! It had an interesting color, a sweet aroma, a dry roasted taste, and an alcoholic mouthfeel. I think this NC brewery did a good job. The aroma could have been better, but everything else was good. Would I drink another one? Yeah, I wouldn't mind another single."

"Overall, I am very unimpressed with this offering from Duck Rabbit. There is just an overall lack of everything from the aroma to the flavor to the mouthfeel. Way too much DMS and a lack of much malt or hops. Maybe this has improved since the batch I got but I really can't recommend."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is of malts, alcohol, caramel, some dark fruits. Taste is a bit boozy. Some dark fruit and malts, alcohol is prevelent. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"O- not much of a dopplebock guy, but this isn't bad. A little too malty and sweet for my tastes, but definitely enjoyable over the course of time"
"I really should've reviewed some of the earlier Doppelbocks I had from this mixed case, as maybe I've left it in the cellar too long, given the discrepancy between my experience and the overall BA community."
"O: As stated, I feel this brew is very true to the traditional doppelbock style. I have a soft spot for a killer doppelbock and this baby delivers the goods. I searched for this brew for over two years and it was definitely worth the wait. I can heartily recommend searching it out."

"I had this on tap expecting an awesome doppelbock, but got something else. It looked good, nice deep amber color, good off white head. The smell was ok, malty, a little whiff of pepper. The taste was off, it was way too sweet, and not malty sweet, it was cherry sweet, no bitterness. I took a drink of water to make sure it wasn't something else, nope same thing. It was thick and chewy, low carbonation. I am bummed by this, I love a good doppelbock."
""
""
""
""
"O- Top tier doppelbock. Not in Ayinger Celebrator's league, but not far from it."
""
"3.93/5.00"
"Overall it's pretty awesome! I didn't check the ABV until after I tasted it and I'm pretty shocked. This beer masks its alcohol very well with its full body."
"O: great selection, must try"
"Maybe I just got a bad bottle, as the reviews are generally positive for this one, but it’s got all the Infected Duck-Rabbit characteristics going on aside from the gigantic head...in fact this one is nearly flat after the initial pour. Aroma in particular reminds me a lot of their 2012 Barleywine disaster. Never had a sour or funky Doppelbock before, so I’ve got to assume this is not what the brewer was shooting for. In an effort to be fair, I will try one more bottle just in case this one was an anomaly and will adjust my review accordingly if needed. As it stands right now, this is a terrible Doppelbock. Fought through half the glass, but the rest is going down the drain..."

"The chestnut colored body clear, and the beige head was fed by gentle carbonation. The smell was ripe with figs, dates, cherries, and dark raisins. The taste was not as sweet as I had anticipated. The malts appeared to be well roasted, giving a bitter coffee effect at first sip. This was followed by a fruity tartness, semi-sweet powdered cocoa, and a woody, dry finish. This was a surprisingly complex juxtaposition of flavors for the style. The body was not as silky smooth as the best examples of the style. Quite a different experience from others of this style."
""
""
"O: Definitely a good beer. At this point in my taste buds' career, I want flavors that are a bit stronger, but I appreciate the high drinkability for a fairly alcoholic beer, and the many subtle flavors. Even if I did appreciate the balance more, however, I feel that a doppelbock should ram you with its two horns (I'm so clever) a bit more roughly. If the malty, toffee flavor could be a bit more rich, and then you could discern the others flavored I mentioned, just a little more faintly, I think this beer would be outstanding."

"Pours a slightly hazy dark amber color with a thick head that dies down to a soapy film of bubbles. A strong caramel aroma with some peat and a touch of cherry. Very clean aroma. A bit of toasted malt flavor at first that blends with a bit of cherry and a nice butterscotch flavor. A medium feel with a nice smooth body and a bit of syrup. Coats the tongue with a sweet finish. On par with Optimator and Salvator. Another dangerous session beer....great flavor and you can't detect any alcohol."
""
""
"Mainly, considering the $14/6-pack it costs, I'd prefer to buy a fair amount of other things for $10. So I'm glad I tried it, but also glad I got a single bottle for $3."
""
"Overall a very solid offering from Duck Rabbit. This was the first real beer I loved from them and the 2013 batch is no different. For some reason these are only going for $7.49/6 pack right now and at that price I'm going to be picking up a case."
""
""
""
"This is a very nicely flavored doppelbock. It's complex and very drinkable with a well hidden ABV. This is another solid offering from Duck Rabbit."

"Pretty drinkable, not world-class, but pretty decent. However, at $14 a sixer, I would probably pass on this one again in bottled form. This one did grow on me as it warmed..."
""
"Overall: This beer was just what I wanted tonight. Full of malt goodness. It would be extremely good if it were a bit smoother, but I really enjoyed it."
""
""
"O - I really enjoy this beer. I have had this last beer of a 6 pack since August '11 so it has aged about 6 months on top of the brewing/aging timeline. I look forward to getting to NC so I can get somemore."
""
""
"Overall this beer company impresses me every time with beers and to make a dopplebock almost 9% this smooth and creamy is exceptional. I would buy it more often if I could find it in more places."
""
"Overall a good beer that I would purchase again."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip, bottle dating is not notched. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense tan head with nice retention that reduces to a thin cap that sticks around. Small bits of lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, biscuit, chocolate, molasses, toasted malts, dark fruits, and spicy hops. Very nice aromas here with good balance. Taste of big caramel, toasted malt, chocolate, molasses, biscuit, dark fruit, spiciness, and a bit of booze. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toasted malt, biscuit, and spices on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol has a decent presence with a decent warming on the finish. Overall a very nice and impressive doppelbock. The alcohol presence is a bit much, but overall still very enjoyable."
"Good, but definitely not your typical doppelbock. Malts are the centerpiece, but they're quite roasty and slightly smoky. Smell is the highlight. I think the best qualities of the taste are pulled down by that odd alcohol bite. And the mouthfeel is just too bubbly."
"Overall a really solid dark beer that I enjoyed greatly, and hope to enjoy again!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: unusual doppelbock, and nicely refined. A deviation from what I usually anticipate to be too sweet and overly esterized, this one is nice."
""
""
""

"Overall. This is a onsie-twosie. Not something I would drink more than 2 of in a night. Maybe a desert beer. Give it some body, lose a little alcohol, and it could be Duck Rabbits money maker."
"Bottle poured a clear reddish brown with a small lingering tan head. Aromas of molasses, caramel, toffee, cocoa and light fruittiness. Palate was medium bodied and crisp. Flavors of molasses, toffee, caramel and light cocoa with a crisp lingering toffee finish."
"Pours a deep dark brown color with a decent tan head that shows moderate retention and minimal lace. Smells of dark dried fruit, caramel, and burnt sugar with a hint of ash mixed in there as well. Taste is dark malty with a hint of mineral and ash. All the usual suspects are here, caramel, dark sugar, prunes, plums, raisins. Light roasted grains are a bit out of place. Little to no hop presence, but there really shouldn't be. Medium to thick body light level of carbonation with a caramel thick mouthfeel. There are better examples of the style, but this is one damn fine brew. I quite enjoyed this one, roasted grains and all."
"D - this is a really solid doppelbock from Duck-Rabbit. It has a really nice balance of chocolates and dark fruits. I feel most doppelbocks are one dimensional on the malts, but this has a really nice interplay in and out of a variety of flavors. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it!"
"O: An atypical doppelbock that seems to border more on a porter than a doppelbock. Still, it is quite tasty with a nice combination of sweet chocolate and nutty flavors and aromas."
"EDIT: Wow. So that alcoholic tartness definitely gets to you further down in the beer. I had to lower my score a bit."
"Rich, full-bodied, light effervescence. Slightly ashy note in the aftertaste. This is a really fine bottle of brew. Now if they would only distribute in Florida."
"A dark mahogany colored brew with a decent tan colored foam on top with nice lacing. The aroma brings big peanut butter malt with a hint of ham and muted licorice cotton candy. Quite nice. The flavor favors licorice malt by far and it’s delicious with banana bread sweetness and a little charcoal and lemony grass hop. A really good doppelbock. It has a resinous feel, silky smooth in a medium-heavy bodied brew with tiny bubbles that keep it a touch lively. Quite a brew. Enjoy."
"Poured out as a really deep brown color with a thin fizzy light tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer has a light peppery note to me followed up by some big malt aromas. The taste of the beer was pretty good, I feel that I've had better tasting Doppelbocks before. This one just didn't seem like it was all there. The mouthfeel of this beer is well carbonated and leaves a caramely sweet feeling in the mouth. Overall it's a good brew to try but I don't think I'll buy it again."
"O - great glass for a nightcap, nice example of the style. Just one per evening I think."
"Overall, aside from unexpected licorice this is kind of disappointing. Too watery for my tastes."
"It is a measure of the high regard that I hold this brewery in that this beer ranks as a slight disappointment."
"O: I was really looking forward to this one, but it fell a bit short of expectations. It's not a bad beer by any stretch, but it's a bit pricey and I'm not sure I'll be seeking it out again. I think a change in the body of this beer would do wonders for it."
"O: Duck-Rabbit's Duck-Rabbator Doppeldock is a pretty impressive offering. It's one of the more flavorful Doppelbocks I've had, and certainly did well with a year in the ol' cellar. The mouthfeel could use some touching up, but otherwise this one gets a hearty reco' from me."
"o - Overall a very good doppelbock. Lots of fruit and malts and a great nose; would like to have it again."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet up front and surprisingly dry at the end of the beer. It is sort of bitter with a coffee like roast on the end. It was nice but not the best doppelbock I've ever had. Interesting with the roast character though."
"M/O: Very crisp and drinkable beer. Very balanced flavors and not too overwhelming with the alcohol. The beer presents well and also really has some nice complexity."
"O: A malt-bomb. Big roasted flavors, lots of sweetness and a bit of balancing bitterness makes for a dangerously drinkable beer. I have yet to meet the dopplebock that I didn't like, and this is no exception. Worth checking out, especially if you like heavily malted beers."
"Overall, this beer is flavorful and easy to drink but it's a bit too one dimensional and sweet for my liking. Another solid offering from Duck Rabbit but nothing extraordinary."
"Overall: A very enjoyable doppelbock that I'd score higher if the taste was as good as the nose. I like what Duck Rabbit is doing and this is no exception."
"O- Pretty good overall. The bite of alcohol can be a bit off-putting, but it works very well with the dark chocolate taste in the back of the mouth. Will definitely buy this again."
"Duck Rabbator pours a *very* dark brown, it's almost stout-like in appearance. A three and a half finger caramel head pops up and fades fast and clean at first. At about a finger and a half though things slow down and some serious head retention kicks in. There's a solid amount of lacing left clinging to the side of the glass as well. The nose is a bit unexciting, it's very heavy on biscuity malts, with just a hint of plums showing up as well. With my expectations somewhat tapered, the first few sips then were a revelation. Duck Rabbator is a seamless blend of just about everything one could want from a malt heavy beer. Biscuit, caramel, toasted nuts, cocoa and dark sweet fruits all have a turn shining through. The body is spot on, lush and full. The carbonation though is a bit lackluster. Don't get me wrong, in a beer like this I'm looking for the carbonation to be a bit on the low side, but it's almost nonexistent here and the beer is bordering a bit on being syrupy. In some ways Duck Rabbator is a world class Doppelbock, but it's also a somewhat uneven brew."
"D - The booze is hidden well for the style. Pretty sweet beer but not out of line with the style. A nice beer and a solid doppelbock but not the best around."
"Poured a dark brown with a huge frothy off-white head that lasted throughout and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of roasted dark bread malts, a sweet leathery yeast with hints of coffee, chocolate, toffee, raisons and a mild alcohol scent. It tasted lightly sweet with a mild coffee overtone at first and ended with a chocolate-coffee flavor with notes of raisons and had a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel was medium in body and kind of watery in texture and had a flat carbonation.Overall a tasty brew but not too exciting."
"Trader's Note: Many thanx to cdflem for a 6'er of this one!"
"Drinkability: An excellent doppelbock, and I'm upset I hadn't had a chance to try this one sooner. At 8.5%, it's dangerous, though not stylistically, and that 8.5% is nowhere to be found. This one's a definite winner - probably the best Duck Rabbit brew I've had (I think I'd put it a step above any of their seasonals, with the possible exception of the Baltic Porter), and a real flavorful bomb. Very nice."
"Well overcarbonated, this dark concoction (with little head) attacked my palate and did not go. Heavy, a rich chocolate, pepper, tabbacco. I was OK with it, but got more than my fill of beer today from it. For this style, turn it down, less is more, and closer to the target."
"Slightly viscous for the style with a low carbination level. Not best enjoyed quickly, this one is better slow and with a good read."
"D - This was surprisingly good, and is probably the best thing I've had from Duck Rabbit. I'd definitely include this in a doppelbock showdown. Went through my 12oz shockingly fast."
"It tastes intially sweet with blasts of malty goodness. Finishes with long yeastie fruity notes, not bitter at all. The alcohol seems more noticeable in taste than in smell. Medium-plus bodied, very full and creamy mouthfeel. Another winner from a great brewery."
"This is a very nice doppelbock. It doesn't taste like a traditional German doppelbock, but it is a very interesting take on the style."
"I poured from a bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is deep black with amber highlights, about a 1 inch head, light lacing. The beer has a ton of dark, sweet fruit on the nose. The beer taste like it smells, dates, plums, and a bit of warming alcohol. It has a lingering sweet finish. A full bodied, well carbonated brew. A very good doppelbock."
"Overall it is pretty good."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Color is dark mahogany with a nice tan head and some good retention. The nose is dark fruits, roasted malt, caramel, nuts, chocolate. Really nice and presents an elegant complexity. The taste is the same and some brown sugar mixes well with the fruits and chocolate. Fairly thick body with good carbonation. Drinks quite well overall and is very nice."
"drinkability: good"
"D: About average. It was interesting, not un-pleasant, but not necessarily something I would hunt out again."
"Bottle. Poured into the duck rabbit snifter, score! Pours a dark brown color with a reddish hue. Slight tan head that collars around the glass. The aroma is a sweet malty caramel with some slight vanilla. Wow, this has an almost butterscotch flavor with a bit of carmelization and roast. Some dark fruits as well. Medium mouthfeel. The ending is slightly bitter that lingers on for a while. No lace at all. Overall, not bad but not outstanding either."
"Overall, a decent dopplebock. Some heavy flavors here. Somewhat drinkable. I dig it."
"D: Not sure what style to compare this to on a drinkability level. Almost drinks like a lighter scotch ale."
"Thanks to Bucketboy for the generous extra. Served in my DFH Goblet. Pours the color of cola with a thin head that dissipates into a cluster of bubbles, forming a thin band around the perimeter of the bowl. Nose reveals cocoa and dark fruit - very similar to a Baltic Porter in character, with a slightly acidic quality in the mix. Taste follows nose with a slightly earthy quality, some licorice and a sour mash character that reveals itself as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation that is slightly higher than optimal. This is a delicious and drinkable brew; perhaps not quite style consistent and closer to a Baltic Porter than a Doppelbock, but incredibly tasty nonetheless."
"Close to three fingers of dark tan head, a lot of larger bubbles interspersed throughout, pops and sizzles down to the surface at a steady gait, the lacing slides down the glass side in solid sheets. Very dark brown in color with a mild orange tint, no murkiness at all, just darkness, a pleasing package visually. There's enough roast to the nose to evoke coffee, dark baker's chocolate and a pinch of chicory, softened by butterscotch, rum raisin and date to fig fruit notes, very light banana too, the hops more like straw or hay than anything fresh and green, muscular tenacity in your nostrils. Full-bodied, dry and crisp mouth entry, the carbonation well-defined and brisk. Sip by sip you get more chocolate, butterscotch, nougat, molasses and coffee hard candy. The raisin, fig, date, maraschino cherry flavors not overly sweet and strongest past the mid-palate. More of foresty, mossy sort of herbaceousness here, wetter and livelier. Minimal citrus or spice, sticks to the core message. Richness without heaviness."
"The odd animal mixture pours a very deep mahogany which can only be seen in true form when penetrated by a very close source of light. Atop is a nice tan head that is quick to relinquish its grip on the surface of the beer. The smells bring many thoughts to mind most of them tasty. The main aromas are a molasses and booze, but there is also a nice paring of pineapple and caramel as well to make it very interesting. The taste is clearly of the sweet molasses, but that's not all. There are hints lemon zest, plum and smoked malts with a prominent spiced rum kicker in the back. The mouthfeel is rather decent while the beer is perfect in its consistency and carbonation the booze content is a bit on the acidic side to where it attacks the sides of the tongue. This is definitely a pleasant beer to drink and a pretty good doppelbock, one I would definitely recommend."
"D: Wow, this was great, I'll be going back for a six pack of this!"
"The flavor is subtly aggressive, coating the palate with dark fruit notes of raisin and fig. Powdered chocolate and toasted amber malts follow suit with a larger-than-expected burst of resinous hops. Sticky, chewy body, but the mouthfeel never becomes a chore as the carbonation level is spot-on. All in all, a well-crafted doppelbock from the geniuses that dwell in Farmville, NC. A must-try for fans of the style."
"Drinkability: It would be better if the sweetness was toned down some but I still enjoyed it. Even though it doesn't approach a couple of German doppelbocks like Celebrator, it's a nice beer and competes at the top with American doppelbocks."
"Flavor is good. Not the best dopplebock out, but VERY solid. Loads of dark toasted notes, more tobacco, chocolate/caramel sweetness. Medium body, medium carbonation, and medium booze warmth. A little hoppy for a DB...then again...it's super fresh and that may fade. Would be interested to see how this one ages. Tasty beer...like most Duck Rabbit beers!"
"D: 'Duck-Rabbitor', huh? A stretch...names and odd label imagery aside, a freakin' stellar beer! The maltmasters at D-R dun dun it agin'; a gorgeous, highly flavorful wonder that I'm lovin' every bit as much as its Germanic brethren."
"Goes down pretty easy for 8.5%."
"d: Really nice take on the style, great beer overall."
"Tried a bottle of this one at RFD in Washington, DC. Its' initial pour emits a razor-thin head crowning a body of dark brown. There is no lacing. The nose detects a faint hint of raisin tinted with molasses. The palate gets hit with an obvious blanket of cocoa powder. It does not overwhelm and finishes quickly with a well balanced mouthfeel - nice mix of hop and malt, with the malt having the smoother edge. The body is somewhat heavy, albeit one with intense carbonation and the obvious alcohol content that is common with the style. Certainly not the best of the style - and not the best from this fine brewer. Still, not a bad one."
"D: A deep, enjoyable after-dinner brew or one for the cooler days of fall approaching. The 8.5% ABV is not really present in the flavor, but a bit in the feel. It also packs a boozy punch and has that effect on the imbiber. Beware the drinkable Rabbitor!"
"Drinkability is high because it's tasty, balanced and refreshing in body while being rich and filling. The alcohol isn't detectable in the taste, but it is in the feel."
"D - Interesting and easy to drink."
"D: I was kinda shocked at how easily I polished off this beer considering the alcohol content. It drinks very smooth and I will be eagerly seeking it out again. Excellent."
"Dark. The light reveals mahogany to garnet hues. Topped by a modest khaki foam - about 1 finger at first, then sticks around as a thin sudsy sheet. Molassas, dark fruits and some complex chocolate malt aromas. Nutty with a touch of chocolate malt roastiness that adds a little to the bitterness and also contributes some cocoa powder flavor. A hint of plum tries to dig through the roast, finding it's way through from time to time, more-so in the aroma. A tad minerally, but just barely, adding some sharpness. Kind of reminds me of a strong brown ale. There is an overall complexity to it that is hard for me to describe. Alcohol is detectable, but fairly well hidden until it smacks you upside the head. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth except for the sharpness. Assertive and solid. Improves as it warms; the roastiness starts to give a little way to the dark fruits and hints of cherry. A tad roasty to be truly traditional, but still a nice beer from the dark beer specialists. If this wasn't labeled a doppelbock, I would probably give it a bump for taste."
"I agree with my predecessor: rabbit. It pours a translucent dark ruby-brown topped by nearly a finger of dark tan foam. The nose comprises biscuits, caramel, toffee, light roasted malts, brown sugar, and a pinch o' nutmeg. The taste shows us that those biscuits were left in the oven a tad too long, blackening their bottoms. The caramel is similarly burnt. Everything else is normal, but muted somewhat in the face of the charcoal-laden bits. That may sound entirely negative, but it really isn't...just different and kinda unexpected. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, a different doppel than I'm used to, but tasty nonetheless. Get some!"
"Had to take it slow, as this drinks so easily. Definitely a huge flavor, not much subtlety here, and I imagine age could change the shape of this beer in various interesting ways...but I don't think the remaining bottles are gonna make it for very long around here."
"Bottom line, this is a very solid US Doppelbock that is easy to put back. Highly recommended if you like the style, this is better than most. I will certainly buy it again. All hail the Duck-Rabbator!"
"This beer is very much in the vein of the traditional German dopplebocks and is so rich that I would not have been surprised if it were an eisbock. This might well become my favorite Duck Rabbit beer."
"D - This is a very good dopplebock. Duck-Rabbit scores again."
"Overall one of the best things I have had in a long time. I would love to have this on every day."
"Pours a dark brown color with a nice tan head that retains reasonably well. The aroma has a big molasses and caramel sweetness upfront, along with some licorice, honey wheat bread, cherries, plum, date and a little cognac. The flavor is similar to the aroma with a broad sweetness initially (notes of caramel, toffee and molasses), along with some dark fruits (fig, date plum, cherry), toasted wheat bread, licorice, anise, cognac, and some flinty hops. The mouthfeel is full and rich, and drinkability is excellent. An exceptional dopplebock from DR, it's complex and delicious...easily the best American iteration. Highly recommended"
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a deep not-quite opaque brown with a decent light tan head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is toasted dark malts and burnt caramel. The taste is a very enjoyable amount of toasted malts with mild accents of dried fruits and molasses, the taste blows the aroma out of the water! The beer is medium bodied but it is quite smooth and easy drinking. I enjoyed this one on-tap last Summer, and I'm glad it's getting a yearly release now!"
"Poured a clear tea colored brown with a small head that quickly disappeared. Aromas were very sweet and molasses-like. Very flavorful, with strong toffee and brown sugar elements initially dominating before a nice roastiness emergees to balance them out. It was sweet and phenolic enough to be dessert."
"D - good and quite unique, but the tobacco just a bit overwhelming for me as it pretty much takes over the entire second half of the drink."
"Maybe not quite up to the German versions, but still very tasty and another very good one from Duck Rabbit. They should think about bottling this at some point."
"D-So smooth and rich it is almost sinful! An excellant creation by Paul and the DR crew! Hopefully this one isn't a one off!"
"D - Duck-Rabbitor drinks like a champ for an 8.5% Dopplebock. I really enjoyed this one, perhaps enough to crown it as my favorite Duck-Rabbit release thus far. This one definitely exceeded my expectations."
"D - Average for the style. Not incredibly drinkable."
"~10 oz. pour at Foundation, Raleigh, NC"
"D: Pretty good for the style. Alcohol taste doesn't hold you back, but I've never felt like dopplebocks are the kind of beer for sessioning anyways."
"D: Fantastic... maybe a little extra roasted malt flavor than your typical authentic doppelbock, but whose complaining? The ABVS are higher, but hidden."
"Drinkability: this is a slow sipping beer that will last a while. Can't see having more than two pints in a session but this will last you a while."
"This is one hefty doppelbock here,poured a deep dark amber-brown with a thinner off white head atop.Big caramel and dark fruit in the nose with a tad bit of sweet dough,flavors have a big sweet dough base mixed with alcohol dipped dark fruit,the big malt tones are the main component of the beer,its bigger than most I have had of the style.It has big flavor and complexity but its rich and a a bit heavy even for the style."
"Drinkability: A really fine stab at the style; a bit pepperier than the Germans make it but that is actually a nice touch"
"The mouth was a little disappointing. Fairly wet and slick. Expected a bit more carbonation on the tongue, but it was not there. Pretty weak and thin. Flavor was of big chocolate, and pumpernickel bread. Huge mealy taste. Very heavy and fulfilling beer here. Finishes slightly bittersweet, like coffee. Hints of minerals in there as well, which in my experience is a common thread for all DR beers. This is really good. I wish they would bottle this."
"The drink is full-bodied, smooth, syrupy-rich and creamy in feel. Carbonation is mild and the brew silky-sweet and highly sippable. Hella potent to the point I doubt the ABV is 'only' 8.5%, and a damned-excellent first-lager offering from the Dark Beer Specialists in Farmville!"
"Duck Rabbit, you have out done yourselves with this one!"
"Another treat from The Brick Store 12th Anniversary. A 10 oz. pour into the very nice Duck Rabbit ""multi-head"" snifter. Pours a medium to dark brown color with a thin tan head, not too thick, as some light makes its way through. A nice aroma from the dark malt provides a mixture of chocolate and dark fruits. The taste is far stronger in these characteristics, as it a delicious mixture of chocolate, coffee, and raisons. There is a bitter tip to it at the end, maybe a slightly more pronounced hop presence? Not as thick as a lot of Duck Rabbit's offerings, it is much more medium bodied. While thin, there is no overabundance of carbonation, so it is still a smooth sipper. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, further proof of Duck Rabbit's strong presence in the dark beer world."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub during their 12th anniversary celebration. 10 oz poured into a Duck-Rabbit branded snifter. Very nice beer and a great first attempt at a lager by this brewery. Pours a dark brown with a bit of transluscence and a relatively thin, swirly head. Smells malty, but a bit thin. Slightly sweet in the nose with some raisins and molasses, but not at all syrup like, a good deal dryer than that. The taste is very nice. Rich and very, very smooth with restrained sweetness but a firm maltiness. Some notes of chocolate, molasses, lots of caramel, some raisins and plums, and maybe even a tad of coffee bitterness. A touch of lager yeast tang throughout, but this is very subtle. Silky, not sticky in the mouth. I love how smooth and wonderful this is in the mouth. Silken and so nice. Slightly sweet, but there is a bit of burnt caramel and a tiny core of bitterness that helps balance everything. A lovely beer, and I'm glad I got to try some."
