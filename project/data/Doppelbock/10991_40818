There was significant side glass lace throughout the session and the overall look of it was quite thick. The aroma was of slight smoked variety. A little bit of roasted malt with a touch of caramel to sweeten in up. The taste was remarkably smooth and delicious. Great full body on this one, definitely not thin. Nice and mellow smoky flavor with a huge earthy and bread like back. A nice caramel sugar sweet finish brought it all together. No taste of alcohol at all and overall it was a very easy drinker.

3.85,1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D: Emancipator is a very drinkable brew. Dominated by sweet malts but never cloying. Balanced just enough by some of the dark fruit notes and subtle herbal hops.

3.77,-0.8,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"A good looking selection from a recent BOTMC delivery, let's give it a whirl. Popping' the top the brew yields a cinnamon raison bagel smell. Pours to deep reddish brown with a short tan head. Taste is a nice roasted malt but with sweet molasses like notes a little bitter more than that expected for a doppel. Mouthfeel is silkly smooth excepting some fizziness perhaps too much from the carbonation. It really varies from the style, not the roasted malts but the slight bitterness, but I like this twist of roasted malts and a little hop bite. I am rating this one on pure flavor and not style conformance. This beer should be imbibed closer to room temperature to get the full flavor range.","mooseisloose","Apr 13, 2010"
3.92,3.2,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured to a pure amber. I wouldn't really describe mine as light or dark. Just pure. The head fizzed away in about 5 seconds. Didn't put a stopwatch to it but.... maybe I'm guilty with not a vigorous enough pour?? The jurys out. I'm smelling sweet dark fruits. Catching a roasty vibe in there also. Sweet sweet malty flavor. I can taste some alcohol but it seems hidden quite well. Caramel with that sip. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Full bodied. I agree with the BOTM description as ""chewy"". I would most def purhcase this beer again. Probably not one of the more sought after d-bocks but I found my 3 brews very enjoyable.","zebco","Apr 12, 2010"

The aroma is very sweet, molases, dark fruit, figs. The flavor is not as sweet as the aroma, but has the same notes. It finishes with a lingering sweetness. IMO it is thin for the style.

It tastes like bready malt and caramel, along with some toffee and prunes/figs. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it could be better. Overall I think it's a decent enough brew, however if I was in the mood for a dopplebock this wouldn't be close to being my first choice.

4.15,9.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"D - This is a great dopplebock. Not quite up to Celebrator standards but among the best I've had. I tend not to be as big a fan of most lagers, but this fits the standards well and, were it not a limited local to Cincinnati brew, could be a regular rotation for me.","Med","0"
3.77,-0.8,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a translucent brown in color that has ruby highlights around the edges. A head forms on the pour, but quickly is gone. Smell is all malt and toffee. Taste is much the same, but I'm getting a nutty, almond like flavor that I'm liking. Good, solid offering from CM. Well done.","FtownThrowDown","Mar 27, 2008"

I can't wait until they move the brewery back to Cincinnati and put a brewpub in the Historic OTR brewery district. I think this brew would go great with a strong tiramisu.","pwoods","Beers"
