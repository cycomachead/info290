There’s also an element of nuttiness in the flavor, which is perfect for a chilly snow day. This is everything a solid doppelbock should be. The body seems a tad light, but the flavor does not suffer. A solid drinking bock, and at a strong 7.5%, this is a deceptively enjoyable brew. Bravo!","secondtooth","Nov 18, 2014"

4.08,10.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"i have a confession to make. i am friends with the brewer at one location, and i got to try this before is was released to the public. it was about two weeks away from general tapping, but the beer was more than ready in the horizontal lagering tank in the cold room. he poured me a mug, and i had to drink it. the beer was sensational straight up. he was worried about the abv, and about the hops in the finish, thought a few more weeks would make it more acceptable to the masses, but i am not the masses. it was creamy and rich brown sugar in color, with a two inch khaki colored head that did not recede at all. the smell was cara-munich and cara-red malts, which affect the color as well as the nose, giving it a sweet doughnutty aroma. flavor is true to that at first, but a surprising hop kick comes in with a little wintery spice mix in the finish to crisp it up. this is what any winter lager should taste like. i hate to give this much props to a chain, but this is a brilliant holiday offering, better than most craft stuff on the market. the freshness of the hops might have made this for me, sort of english barleywiney in ways, but german malty. its special, and i hope its just as good in other mediums, but somehow i am doubting that it could be. for now though, suffice it to say that tis beer is a wonderful thing. heavy and light at the same time in feel, with a full body, sticky like honey, but like a memory foam pillow in the finish, in the sense that it fits your shape and rlaxes you slowly. this beer was top notch, and i wish that everyone could try it as i did tonight.","StonedTrippin","Dec 13, 2012"

I was really disappointed in the two times I visited the brewpub in the ATL, but this beer shows some promise. A little more smooth chocolate maltiness and hide the ABV some and this could be a good beer.

A mild, sweet malt smell of roasted and cocoa malt dominate the aroma (hints of coffee). Not a particulary thick bock, but not thinnish or syrupy either. A mild-mannered but pleasant sweetness, with hints of chocolate, caramel, toffee, butterscotch and other sugariness I can't think of. Not overly sweet, mind you. Has minor roasted notes and hops for a slick but hints of dryness on the backbite; not a milkshake here. Mildly warming also.

Anyways, the head quickly recedes to a thin lacing. Smell is rasins, light prunes and very strong sugary- caramel malt. Taste is ripe apricot, rasins, and fruit followed by a drawn-out sweet, tasty caramel malt. Alcohol is almost undetectable. For how available and inexpensive this beer is, I'd say it's a fantastic brew but I had pretty low expectations...","jgap","Feb 10, 2009"

This one is somewhat enjoyable, but I'd probably not seek this one out again.","atsprings","Jan 15, 2009"
3.97,7.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Got it at Gordon Biersch in DC. Poured a solid tan head on a near black beer. Kind of a standard doppelbock, sweet and slightly spicy in both the nose and flavor. Not in any way bad, and actually really accessible (had a couple non-beery work friends there who really enjoyed it). One of the better brews I've had at GB.","soupyman10","Jan 03, 2009"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours dark brown with crimson hues and is topped by a good amount of tan head which doesn't fade too quickly and leaves a few spots of lacing behind. Clusters of carbonation bubbles cling to the glass as more shoot through the middle of the brew to the top. The malts smell of sweet caramel. Behind that are subtle notes of spice, cherries and vanilla. Tastes of sweet malts, cherries, coffee and hops. Mouth-feel is slighty creamy and it goes down smooth. Excellent winter ale, but not as spicy as some others.","stephens101","Jan 02, 2009"

Oh, and it goes well with pizza.","DoubleJ","Dec 05, 2008"

Not nearly as clean as some of the better German examples of the style I've tried recently, though not terrible either. Dried fruit and nuts, a bit of spice.

And I guess I'll review this as the ""Vegas"" location (drives me nuts how every GB has a different location when from my understanding the bottles are produced at the same plant). Anyways...nice thick and creamy head, very dark ruby (clear) with a ton of lacing as it goes down. Smell is almost a hefe crossed with a stout. Some fruit aroma as well as a nice touch of caramel. Taste was good, very much in line with other ""winter"" beers. Somer dark fruit, caramel, touch of chocolate, and a stronger than expected straw or grass taste as well. Mouthfeel was pretty thick due to the low carbonation but I didnt really enjoy that, it tasted a little too flat for me.

3.6,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Impressed to find this beer floating around the Columbus area. Starts off with a rusty / plumby color with a mariginal head formation, but retained well. Aromas of rich malt and a light alcohol scent with a meaty, bready, savory character. Flavors are simple and clean and closely mimic the character found in the nose. Emphasis on the rich malt flavors, light on esters, and fermentation by-products. Heavy on the meaty notes.

4.17,13.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Served in a large mug with just a short cap of light tan foam across the surface, the very dark brown body revealed ruby highlights when held to the light. The aroma was malty with a hint of roastiness and a suggestion of chocolate. In the mouth it was medium bodied and smooth with a median carbonation that gently tingled on the palate. The flavor was fuller than the aroma suggested, and in addition to deep caramel with an almost scorched edge, there was some dark fruit, a hint of spiciness, and a bit of chocolate in the background. It could have been fuller, but I think that would hurt the drinkability. As it is it's quite nicely balanced, and very enjoyable. It didn't seem strong as the alcohol was never noticeable, and I'd imagine that it would be easy to order a third glass of this and head into trouble!

Nice lightly roasty qualities to it with some almost chocolate-like qualities and some slight warming alcohol presence. This is borderline doppel territory here. Big bready, chewy and heavy body to this brew with a silky smooth mouthfeel. This put off my grumbling stomach for a bit with its huge body. Awesome cool weather brew, excellent for warming you up and filling you up as well. I would drink this all winter long if I had a GB near me.
