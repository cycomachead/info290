"I really enjoyed this beer.  Many complex flavors.  Not sugary, but a bit of ""sweetness"" to the finish.  Medium ABV at 8.2% so a couple of these is all you need.  Nice head when poured from a tap.  Rich color.  Low bitterness at 25IBUs."

"I'm a bit disappointed in this one. Although a complex and flavorful beer, some elements of it are slightly off putting. I was particularly bothered by the burnt malt flavor and booziness. The finish left a medicinally boozy aftertaste that reminded me of Jaegermeister. (which I do not like) I was looking forward to having this one because I love doppelbock. I will give it another chance, however, it does not look like it measures up to other german doppelbocks I've had."
"Fantastic brew, malty with the right balance of bitterness and alcohol prescience"
""
""
"Taste is malty, almost dry-like, and satisfying.  Well-balanced flavor profile for a beer of this style.  The 8.2% seems to be well covered up, as I don't notice the alcohol so much.  This is a tasty beer.  I like this style a lot, but this is definitely in the better half of dopplebocks that I've tried."
"This beer was dark heavy and filling. Strong caramel. I was not a big fan."
"Enjoyable filling. Felt heavy on the pallete"
""
""
""
"Appearance pours a beautiful deep amber brown in color, tight lacing that clings to the inside of my glass - good carbonation bubbles - Aroma is of some deep raisin and figs - the hops are subtle and mild with a slight grass tone coming through - The taste is as advertised - a huge malt base with hints of rum, honey and slight licorice. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation with a nice malt base that holds up on the tongue well without breaking down - Overall an impressive Doppel with just the right amount of flavor complexity combined with a nice ABV to warm the soul - will seek out again now that Troegs is available in the great state of CT"
"O - Love the style, been a way on a visit to ipaland for a while, glad to revisit, this is a good representation."
""
""
""
"Overall, a fantastic dopplebock and on par with ones made from Germany. I can't think of  better one and highly recommend it to everyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Did not care for at all. More of a whiskey kind of after taste."
"Hard to discribe lite smell strong alcohol Finsh good bock overall"
"Received a selection box of Troegs beers for Christmas, and this is by far my favourite. Nice rich flavour."
""
""
"On tap, tastes a bit off. Not as sweet as a typical bock. Not awful Just kinda weird"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of malt, natch, but pretty sugary and where’s the brown bread? Bottled 3.3, 9 months ago - I’d have thought doppelbocks would age well but maybe not. Not the best example of Troegs or the style. 3.75"
""
""
"Overall:  This is a very good American version of a German Doppelbock.  Malty, sweet, lots of flavors of dried stone fruit and slightly bitter, this beer is very reminiscent of German doppelbocks.  Recommended to Doppelbock fans."
"Nice head which fades but leave nice lacing. Malty but a aftertaste that just didn't sit well. Not sure I would have another."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good Dopplebock, close to some of the better German Dopplebocks."
""
""
""
""
""
"We really like this one. The balance of hops was perfectly crafted. We Will be getting a second round of this one for sure!"
""
""
""
"Perfect for frozen weather. Strong maltiness, melanoidins, with some toastiness. Very rich, almost a subtle milk choco. Almost ruby in color. Could use a bit more lager crispness."
""
""
""
"Bland. Not very flavorful. deep red color"
""
"Good smooth finish. Enjoyable and not over powering."
""
"This thing is beautiful in the glass and has the malt backbone to easily hide the over 8%. I loved the rich dark fruits flavor with just a nice subtle burn from the alcohol."
"Very good bock, top ten that I have had"
"Pours a dark mahogany with amber highlights.  Aroma is very much what I like - primarily bread-crusty type malty notes.  Flavor follows suit, with a lingering sweetness on the back end.  Perhaps too much.  The bready notes are all there though, which is a big plus.  Not much feel to this one - I expected more.  Touch of body on the front end, but with a watery finish.  Expected more feel throughout.  Good beer, no question, but not among the best I've had."

"This is a good one, full of flavor and complexity."

"Probably the tastiest Bock I have had, it feels like I am in Bavaria at a monastery."
""

"The taste is incredibly sweet and malty with a moderate bitter finish. It is quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Utterly disappointing. Tastes like they dumped in extra flavored like caramel instead of having them form naturally."
""
""
"O: Solid indeed, for a US crack at a doppelbock.  It could stand a bit more fruit character to round out the flavor profile, but overall, not bad."

"BOD 8/13/14.  Beautiful clear dark amber pour that has a heavy dose of dark ruby making it almost red.  Normal head, lacing and slightly below normal retention.  Light nose of caramel malt with bread undertones coupled with a light alcohol note.  As it warms, dark fruit notes (fig, raisin, plum) are noted.  Full bodied with a rich creamy texture.  Normal carbonation with a nice effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is well balanced and complex.  It begins with a bready malt that flows into the dark fruit notes.  In the middle, caramel sweetness comes forward then yields to a mild hop bitterness.  The finish is where the alcohol becomes a bit unhidden as the other flavors fade."

"tis the season now for this monster. one of the better bocks in the game i think, and truly a genre defining beer for many and rightfully so. this is big sticky brown with a tanned head on it that doesnt budge. its enormously viscous with notes of molasses and dark dried fruit being the dominant aromas. chocolate malt may be in there up front in the flavor, its dry before its sweet. but when it gets sweet it gets real sweet, maple and brown sugar and sticky bread pudding all come from rich darker german malts. the finish is long and just a little hot. a pint or a bottle of this is an interesting proposition. one has you stoked and feeling amazing. enough to make you want another. then it gets you buzzed and too mellow to know your full and well on the way to drunkenness. a third is night night for many, time to get weird for others, but if you are having a fourth in one session, you will inevitably exhibit your inebriation in an unflattering way. just the way it is with this seasonal staple."

"This is the first dopplebock I've tried so I'll rate it more generally as a beer and not as a dopplebock. It is a very good beer, it's got me interested in the style now."

"O: I've heard so much about this beer and haven't had too many doppelbocks, but this doesn't taste like any of the ones that I've had. Sorry Troegs, not a fan."
"O - Have not had a ton of Double Bock's in my day but this is one tasty brew. If your in the mood for a sweet malty beer pick this one up if you can its worth a try. Really enjoyed this one , cheers!"
""
"This may well be my favorite offering from Tröegs, even *gasp* better in my opinion than Nugget Nectar. I like Bocks. They are one of my favorite styles of lagers for their color and flavor and doppelbocks are very tasty. This one is no exception. I bought this around Christmas time (Yeah, yeah, I should have gotten some Mad Elf but I wasn't too familiar with Tröegs at the time). Altogether this a good beer for many different applications. It is a little bit high gravity to be a perfect session beer, but the flavor is both strong and not intrusive with plenty of the malt characteristic that I like and the hoppiness I expect from Tröegs, though not as much as in Nugget Nectar or something like that. Good for before, during, and after dinner and very good as the first alcoholic thing I drank after finishing my wisdom teeth pain medication."

"O: I enjoy bocks and the rest of the lager family, but doppelbocks aren't my favorite. Just a little too harsh for my taste. The Troegenator is actually a decent double bock; don't let me put this down for you. For me, I find that the flavor isn't balanced enough with hops to compensate for the high alcohol content. For the style, this beer is above average, but it can be found pretty much anywhere. If you're a fan of high-gravity lagers, check this one out!"

" Good, but it takes a few sips to get used to. I've had a few other d-bocks lately, but they've been the hyper-smooth big boys (Celebrator and Optimator), and I'm not used to one that's as rough around the edges as this."

"I like this Double Bock, it has a dark reddish brown color and a rich tan head that holds up pretty well with lots of lacing. You only get that nice head if you serve it cool not Ice cold, the flavor and aroma also open up when it's about 45 degrees. It's malty and fruity and very drinkable for a beer with an ABV of 8.2... If you have tried it ice cold and didn't like it I would recommend that you let it warm a bit and try it again. It is my go to beer for now!"

"Just an ok beer. Felt like it was missing something that I couldn't figure out."
""
"Overall- I thought this was quite satisfying. To have a beer with over 8% abv covering that fact up so well and adding nice complexity is a solid craft. No wonder the ratings for this Troegs offering rank at the top of the doppelbock style. Troegs nailed it. Since it is so heavy, it may not be a beer that is bought often but is a must try for sure!"
""
""
"Overall - It is not the best doppelbock I have had, but I would certainly drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"This is an ignorant-as-all-hell review because I'm not sure I've had a Doppelbock before. From what I know about them, this is what I'd expected. I didn't think I'd love them, and I don't love this beer. However, the feel on this beer is great, and it's very drinkable at 8%. I'm just not high on the style, simply because I find it -- or at least this beer -- relatively uninteresting. I reiterate AGAIN, it's still enjoyable, and very well crafted, without a doubt. A great choice for people who love sweet, malty brews."

"Overall: Mmmmm, I'm starting to enjoy doppelbocks. Especially during this blizzard here in Boston."
"O: I'm not ""wowed"" by this and it's definitely not Troegs' star brew, but it's not bad by any means. The flavors aren't overly complex, but they're satisfying and it offers exceptional drinkability. It's dangerous in the sense that it's flavorful and feels sessionable even though it's donning an 8.2% ABV. Not outstanding, but I'd recommend it to fans of the style. Worth picking up a bottle if you can."

"Overall (4.25/5): I have to agree with the majority of people that this is among the best American interpretations of the German doppelbock style. While there aren't that many domestic breweries that have put their spin on it to begin with, Troegenator is, simply put, a damn good beer that's great during the cold months and a great alternative to an imperial stout if you're burned out on that style but still want something big and dark in your glass."
""
""
"I plan on going on a bock/doublebock tare this spring, I will return to the Troegenator."
""
"Overall- a fanastic double bock !"
""
""
""
"O...overall a nice doppelbock, I'd take celebrator over this one, it is a good warming winter brew that I'd have again"

"I poured this beer into a.glass. it has a dark mahogany color body with no head. The aroma is of dark fruit and raisin. The taste has malt back bone and has a dark cherry and raisin flavor. The mouthfeel is good and overall is a good beer. This style is not one ts"
""
"O: Very inviting look, dark fruit scent/taste, great warming sensation for cold weather, very smooth. Very proud to live in Pennsylvania."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I was expecting a bit more complex malt and fruit and a bit tastier finish. Not a bad beer but not great. Two glasses was more than enough to satisfy my curiosity. Its better than some double bocks and something I may seek out again. Tried it a bit warmer and in a bottle and updated my rating. Good second or third beer after a rich stout."

"o: A tasty, rather Belgianish dopplebock."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: For my money, still the best 'Murican-made doppelbock on the market. There are many occasions, in fact, where I'd even drink this over Celebrator. This is such a great winter-time staple, I really wonder why I haven't made it happen (that is, stock it regularly) for real."
"I had this before from a bottle, but the legendary woodychandler hit me off with a can. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a pretty crimson color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, caramel. Taste is bready, malty, alcohol is present, a touch of caramel sweetness, tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality brew worth checking out."
""
""
"This was the first brew I tried by the Troegs brothers, and it instantly became one of my favorites. Coming in at 8.2% ABV, it certainly packs a punch, but without overkill. It has quite strong characteristics, from smell to mouthfeel, but being a double bock that is to be expected. Having tried many of the other brews Troegs makes I have found I am not a big fan in general, but their Troegenator Double Bock is definitely worth giving a shot!"
""
"It must be humorous, somehow, to put a high-gravity beer like this into a tallboy. The Crack! was loud and the inverted Glug required the practiced hand of the CAN Master to CANtrol from an overflow. I had an initial two fingers of foamy, light-tan head before it began to fall, leaving great lacing in its wake. Color was a deep-ruby or garnet (The ex-Old Lady and I also had that debate during my visit), (SRM = > 27, < 34), with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with dried, dark fruits like raisins, prunes, and dates along with a fresh-baked breadiness. I could envision fruitcake from when my maternal grandmother used to bake it. It had an earthy richness to it that likewise put me in mind of B&B Brown Bread, also in a CAN. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very much like brown bread with raisins! I like slicing off a piece, putting it in the microwave briefly, putting some butter on it and then eating it. The bread, I mean. The beer probably would not be as enjoyable coming out of the mike, but it was darn tasty coming out of both The Fridge and my fridge. I really did not notice the alcohol until the finish when I got a slight burning tickle in the back of my throat. The beer hides its ABV well, which CAN be a dangerous thing if you are not careful. The finish also left me tasting caramel along with the fruit and it just occurred to me - molasses. Wow! This is definitely a rich beer and on a cold day like today, it was just the ticket before hitting the hay."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Still just as great as the first time I had it quite a few years ago.  Such an approachable beer while still having some rather intense flavors."
""
"O: first beer I've had in almost two weeks, and not a very memorable one to come back to. the relatively high abv (8.2) isn't noticeable, but then again very little about this beer is."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the better doppelbocks. I don't like it quite as much as the one from Andech's but it's not far behind. Good stuff."
"My favorite beer from the Troegs Brewery. Generally I don't prefer a beer this sweet, but the malty profile is absolutely delicious, and it extremely smooth and drinkable for a brew of such high ABV. as I said, it may be on the sweet side for some, but it's definitely worth a try for fans of any style. Probably one of the most drinkable heavy beers, even for people who generally don't like something this strong. A fantastic beer overall."

"This is quite sweet. Not too sweet, but it's close. It seems more like a Belgium than a doppelbock. From the ripe fruit smell, to the tangy grape on the back sides of the tongue, a dark fruity sweetness dominates the drink. Don't get me wrong. It's very delicious. I would probably get this again. I will say this: it really masks the alcohol content."
""

"Overall very good beer. I wont go buying a case or anything crazy, but this is good and I'll grab one here or there to try again in the future. Insanely drinkable, no noticeable alcohol. cheers."
"O-an excellent doppelbock, rivaling some of the German variants I've had."
"Good beer easy to drink and very good to enjoy in the fall.. not much lacing no head but like most doubles I've tried not much of a head.. still learning the craft of tasting but I did like this one... good to drink with most foods any cheese or choclate will work lol.."

"Bottle from trade. Pours a deep dark yet clear red with a small creamy yellow colored head. Aroma is sweet malts, some plums, cherries, brown sugar maybe. Flavor is cherries up front with big fruit sweetness, raisins, clean finish. Not as hearty as I expected but a solid medium plus mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. This drinks really easy for the ABV. Basic and not super exciting but done well enough."

"Overall: If did brew my own beer, might buy on occasion."
"Enjoy. I did."
"Overall this beer is probably my favorite, I love the rich taste of it and living in harrisburg currently has allowed me to try all the troegs beers in the tasting room. This is definitely a beer worth trying, it will be unlike many beers you have ever tried."

"Overall: This is one of the better doppelbocks I've had brewed in the US"
""
""
""
""
"The flavors I enjoy are definitely predominant, and the American citrus peel addition is a good change from the German clove flavor. It feels like it lacks more of that robustness I crave in doppelbocks, and the alcohol isn't necessarily subtle or anything. Otherwise, it's a strong take on the style that I'd definitely have again once the time felt right."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, certainly a fine double bock. Overall for the alcohol content, I wish there were stronger flavors going on. But a really nice beer and goes beautifully with food."
"Overall, this brew is nicely styled. More innovation would draw me back to it more frequently. But growlers to go home for spicy barbecue meals never disappoint."
""
""
""
"O- Delicious. Malt bomb perfection. Sweet. A little bready. Great stuff."
""
""
""
""

"Very good beer - a tiny bit over the top with the overall intensity, but big flavors that are well-layered and a great beer to have with robust food. Paired with beef, roasted taters and winter root vegetables - held its own very well and complimented the meal."
""

"3.8/5"

"Overall this fits the style, but it was just too much sweetness for me."
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is lightly foamy and fairly thick and chewy. Little to no ethanol felt in the nostrils or on the throat. Closes semi-dry, with substantial stickiness lingering on the lips and palate, typical for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall, I have to say I quite liked it. Might be time to revisit other Doppelbocks to see if my palate has changed with regard to the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not too shabby. A bit on the bitter side for my preference for this style, but it's no slouch. The aroma and mouthfeel are absolutely top notch. The spicy hop character almost reminds me of Capital's ""Autumnal Fire""...and that's a serious compliment!"

"One of Troegs' best beers, one I will always love."
""

""
""
""
"Overall: A tasty, complex, sweet-but-not-too-sweet doppelbock. More balanced than other flavorful dark beers in that it's neither more toasty than roasty, nor more sugary than spicy, etc. No one flavor dominates, making the complexity that much more enjoyable."

"Pours dark mahogany with a vibrant ruby hue. A tan three fingers of creamy foam sits aloft this fantastic pour into a pilsner glass. Superb retention but no real lacing. This beer is very enticing. Nose is dark ripe fruits, a little chocolate and plenty of carmel malt. As it warms the nose opens up with raisin, cherry, the promise of a little spice and a faint breath of floral hops. On the palate the complexity builds. It’s creamy and sticky with fruits and a full malt presence that expands with some biscuit. The malt has depth and is resilient and forthcoming during the drink. It finishes sweet and off dry with a smacking of hops bitter to coat the mouth while the malt stays up sweet and crisp . It’s light enough to drink but it’s on the heavier side of medium body. This is a big hearted and velvety doopelbock . Rousing and fat. Again Troegs does not disappoint."

"I'm not a fan of this brewery, and this beer is just another reason why. This is a standard beer that I think isn't worth a shot at."

"Overall, I would LOVE to try this on tap as I find it pretty dang good in the bottle. Personal feelings about the beer aside, I think this fits into the style excellently especially with the roasted notes and also pulls off a pretty amazing cover up of the alcohol and provides some nice roasted notes. I would say that this is pert near being world class and gets a solid 4.5 out of 5 overall from me."
""
"O - A damn good doppelbock. I've yet to meet a bock I didn't, so obviously I'm partial, but this is a delicious beer. Highly recommend to any bock fans, or any beer fans in general who enjoy robust, tasty beers with lots going on."

"The finish has a bit of a nutty aftertaste that I really got a lot of from Paulaner Salvator. However, this has more aroma, rounded flavor, and sweet caramel malt. It’s quite decent. The aftertaste is a bit of an issue for me."
""
""
"O: 3.75 - dopplebocks were one of the cross-over styles to craft beer for me, especially Spaten Optimator and Hooker's Liberator; as you can gather from the above, this one is particularly malty and sweet, and maybe I've grown out of this need for jolly rancher beers; however, there are redeeming qualities to this beer that pull it out of the candy house like it back-end bready malt character and lager yeast flavors"

"The beer is dark plum to amber in color with an inch of beige head. Audible fizzing. The aroma brings lager yeast, dark fruit, plums, toffee, caramels. Sweetness that was present in the aroma carries into the flavor. Lingering sweet toffee chews, candy. Hints of brown bread. Malty throughout. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. With Ayinger Celebrator sitting around on shelves at most decent beer stores, it's hard to choose another doppelbock. Still, this is worth a visit."

"Overall/Comments: Wow! This brew was a real treat and excellent on every level. Extremely tasty with a fairly complex build. Troegenator came highly recommended and did not disappoint. Classified as a Doppelbock at 8.2% ABV. Consumed 1-31-13."
"Troegs can do no wrong, even with this iteration, which seems just a tiny bit too sweet. If there's such a thing as a session doublebock, this would fill the bill. I prefer their hoppy ales but this is very nice for what it it tries to be. I could get into this on a snowy winter evening, especially with a little less sweetmess/"

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Troegenator is a deep amber-crimson color with a thin, fading head that dissipates until all that is left is small amounts of fine carbonation that rise lazily to the top of the glass. The nose is all malt; sweet molasses and toasty-bready notes dominate, sweet alcohol lies just percievably above the radar. The flavor is also all malt and alcohol, I pick up some black licorice notes that I didn't notice in the nose. The mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. The finish is slick and the alcohol has a warming sensation. Overall, a well done dopplebock. Definitely a good one for a cold winter's night!"

"O: A great beer to enjoy while warming up by a fire. Malt forward yet balanced and oh so drinkable. The hops bitterness is too strong for the style."

"Pours a deep brown to amber color. Decent head at pour but disappates to just around the rim quickly. No lacing. Smell is darker malts with maybe a hint of smokey. Taste is somewhat strong up front - again malt flavors. But then moves to a sweeter - caramel - yet still somewhat smokey on the finish. Nice body and smaller carbonation."

"Troegenator pours a dark, rudy red color with a half inch caramel head that disappears after a minute or so. Smells of candied fruit and just plain sweetness. I get a whiff of something that resembles raspberry jam! Taste follows the nose... very sweet, with a nice bready kind of taste to it. Slight hop presence ties it all together. Slight boozy-ness lingers, which I guess is on par with the ABV. I don't drink this style too often, but I can't imagine picking another of its ilk over Troegenator."
"Overall definitely one of the better doppelbocks out there. Very enjoyable and hides the alcohol very well."
""

"Overall one of, if not the best American doppelbocks. Quality beer at an affordable price. This is also the beer that got me into beer as I know it now."

"Poured into snifter. Not a ton of head, but nice color, though. Smell is raisiny, musty, fairly earthy. The taste is not bad, just not anything overly spectacular. The mouthfeel is pretty appealing, feels fairly substantial. Overall, this is a nice beer, but not at the top of this great style category. I would have again, but I would maybe look for other d-bocks first. Still, a pretty good brewery."

"The appearance was excellent. It poured a dark brown and clear color. Aroma was very malty. The taste wasn't too heavy. It fit the double bock criteria. Mouthfeel was a medium to heavy, but not over powering. Overall a delicious beer. Very hard just to have one of these."
""
""
"A dark, reddish brown, translucent beer with a finger of off-white head. Aroma was of toffee and dark fruit, almost a cherry flavor. This beer is sweet malt upfront with a raisin or plum like flavor in there. A small bit of hop biterness that helps keep the sweetness in check. The beer masks it's high abv pretty well too. A pretty good drink overall!"

"The beer pours a gorgeous rubied brown with a lightly tanned head of medium sized bubbles which fades away quickly and leaves a thin drizzle of lacing. When you swirl this beer, it leaves nice light legs of alcohol on the sides of my mug. This is a pretty looking beer. The beer smells wet with caramel, bready malts, dark fruits, and brown sugar. There is even a slight tint of chocolate in the nose, and all around it reminds me of a Belgian quad with its malty complexity. There is a nice tinge of alcohol in the back of the smell as well to remind you of the beer’s ABV. The beer tastes much lighter than you would expect from the smell. There is some good brown sugar maltiness going on in this taste, which blossoms at the end of the swallow, but really is quite tame and clean in the initial sip. Dark fruits like plum and raisin are also present, and there is a lingering hint of dark chocolate in the mouth. The mouthfeel is incredibly drinkable and smooth on the tongue, leaving a nice skim of saliva and tingle of the carbonation on the tongue while leaving the entire mouth with a damp feeling. Overall, this is a very drinkable 8% beer, with some lovely sweet malts but not too much. I’ve never had doppelbock before, so I’m not quite sure how to rate this on its style, but I definitely enjoy it. This is a nice offering from Tröeg."

"O: Really good Doppelbock here.The aroma and flavor are great, and the mouthfeel is so smooth."

"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into pilsener glass. Deep red color with moderate fizzy head that doesn't stick around. Smell is malty, bread and some sweetness, perhaps apple. Taste is very sweet up front, dark fruits abound...finishes with a little drying pinch of something. Very drinkable, alcohol not noticeable at all. Mouthfeel is smooth, full yet a bit watery."
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer is not bad. Very dark with lots of molasses aroma and taste. With a vigorous pour large head which dissipates very quickly and no lacing. A thick mouth feel that is drinkable but not is you don't like molasses which is not high on my list. Decent beer."

"Overall:  Good effort overall.  Appealing raisin and caramel aroma and flavor.  Sweetness is to style, but is more cloying than I prefer.  Fans of sweeter beers will be pleased."
""
""
"O: I have had this beer once before and thought it was good the first time drinking it out of the bottle. Not so much now that I've had it in the glass. The alcohol is not hidden at all and there is not a lot of malt character here. This is a so-so beer for me!"
""
""
"Nice dopplebock. Full of malt flavor and sweetness. Lightly toasted, sweet, slight caramel...no roasted or burnt flavors...very malty. Low hop flavor...just enough bitterness to balance the beer. It's a chestnut brown color with a slim, quickly fading off-white head. Clear. The aroma could be a bit more intense, but gives a huge malt smell nonetheless. The taste is solid and powerful. Spot on. The finish is sweet, but has enough bitterness to keep it from being cloying. Full in body. Hides its alcohol well. Nice."

"Thick rich malt flavor - caramel & molasses followed by a nice sting of carbonation. Finishes with a bitter molasses & tart fruit bite = very nice. An excellent double bock that is priced very reasonably."

"Red-tinted beer with a bubbly head that dissipates quickly. Has a really enjoyable maple syrup, biscuit and toffee aroma. More breads and molasses in the flavor accompanied by some fruitiness and spice. This is a really smooth, easy drinker for a doppelbock. Could be a session beer but for the higher abv."

"Cost: $9.99 for a six pack."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 2/9/2012. Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color, with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with nice retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of caramel, molasses, biscuit, raisin, plum, banana, light chocolate, herbal hops, and a touch of alcohol. Some pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, biscuit, molasses, chocolate, raisin, banana, toffee, nuttiness, herbal hops, and light spiciness. Lingering notes of raisin, caramel, molasses, biscuit, chocolate, and herbal hops on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor complexity and balance. Nice maltiness that is not cloying at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy, chewy, and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming after the finish noticed. Quite smooth to drink, but is still a sipper. Overall this is a damn nice doppelbock. Nice flavor complexity and balance; and very enjoyable."
""
"Troegs Troegenator pours a clear dark mahogany, with some gorgeous amber and cherry highlights. There's almost two fingers worth of khaki colored foam crowning the beer, and it displays pretty good head retention. Lacing is also very nice. The nose is very heavy on cherries, that dark fruitiness is what immediately jumps out of the glass. It's supported by a firm note of burnt brown sugar. The flavor develops a bit of caramel to go along with the cooked sugar. Despite that, cherries and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is superb, with a rich and full body. The carbonation tends towards the lower end of the spectrum, with just enough presence to keep the beer from becoming syrupy. Troegenator is a damn tasty beer, but it seems like it's got a lot of fruity flavors and not as much of the nutty, biscuity, and more malty flavors that I'd expect from a big German-style lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Mmmmm. A big bruiser of a doppelbock. Paired with steak and Gorgonzola cheese and worked incredibly well."
""
"First time having a Troegs, they got a little bit adventurous with an already sweet style and cranked the malt sacrificing the hops and lager character. It's not a hot mess, somewhat complex but by far the sweetest and heaviest lager I've ever come across. More like a wee heavy or plain old ale than a bock. Borderline cloying, probably worth revisiting if you want a meal of dessert in a glass."
""

"A lightly chill hazed fluid as it sits right now. The light brown head has a decent size and retention. It is clear now and there are bits of lace starting to cling as I sip this wonderful nectar. The aroma has a sweet caramel malt core with a banana fruitiness and firm toasted graininess. There are figs and dates as well with a touch of alcohol. Taste is rich, smooth, and malty. Sweet caramel and toffee in the front with a bouquet of dark fruits. Almost Belgian style banana note as well. This is a clean, lagered malt bomb however. Mocha and cocoa powder flowing into more pronounced roasted coffee and grains. Hops are firmly bitter with a crisp dry finish that is clean with just a hint of mint and herbal leafiness. More malt and bread flavors lightly linger. Feel is nicely weighted with a nice thickness that at the same time is highly drinkable and supple. A great overall version of the style and my favorite so far. This beer is always welcome in my house."

"Overall, worth a try, but definitely not one of the best brews Troegs puts out."

"Overall: Why a 3.5 overall when all but mouthfeel was in the 2's? Because this is a pretty good beer when only focusing on drinking enjoyment, but not a good example of the style. The beer, rightfully for a double bock, leans toward malty sweetness but balanced enough to avoid being cloying- it's a drinkable beer. Bannana aroma detracted and not typical of the style- not a typical clean lager fermentation. Maltiness was rich but lacked melonodian depth that exemplifies the style. Being part of a mixed 12 pack won't deter me from purchase but I'm sure not buying a straight sixer. Disappointing considering the other brews Troegs puts out."

"This beer pours a cloudy ice-tea color with a thin head and no lace. It's aroma has a hint of chocolate at first then caramel takes over. The flavor is one dimensional, purely sweet malt with a hint of brandy in the finish. The flavor is sweet to the point of being sickening, like the hops were forgotten. The mouthfeel is thick. Troegs Troegenator Double Bock is a not a good beer, a poor representation of the style. Not recommended!"

"Pours a rich red-brown color with a one finger off-white head in my imperial punt glass. The head eventually settles to a ring around the edge of my glass. The smell is of dark fruit, a slight red apple, and some rich malt. In the taste I get more of that dark fruit, maybe a touch of syrup. Not much of a discernible hop presence. Mouthfeel is generally thick. An enjoyable beer, but not one of my all time favorites."
""
""
"Overall, heavy malts, lots of sugar, very sweet complex fruit smell and taste."
"O: A very pleasant and flavorful brew to sip on. The thick mouthfeel makes it rather filling, but the abundance of dark fruit flavors is delicious."

""
"Poured to a mug the beer is a deep rich brownish red amber color with a cream colored hear about 1 finger width with good retention and lacing. The nose is that of biscuits and grain, hints of chocolate, toffee, and darker fruits. No detectable alcohol. The flavor expands on what was found in the nose: biscuity malt base from which the fruit builds: figs, raisins, prunes. Caramel and chocolate also in the mix. Hides the alcohol very well. Rich. Easy to drink. Mildly bitter. Finishes smooth and rich. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this was a treat. Good beer. Super approachable and easy to put down. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"This beer pours smooth, but has a medium thick head that. Right fresh from the bottle it is very dark, and an amber bock. It is not very carbonated. Consistency wise it is pretty light, with a spicy, sweet, tangy taste right off the bat, followed by a chocolately taste after it goes down. After a while it tones down some, with a lighter malt coming out and is good beer to have with a nice meal."
""
""
"O - Honestly, this beer is in my top 5 as far as my personal favorites go, so reviewing it was a breeze. It's a delicious beer, and THE prime example of how a double bock should taste. It has a fairly high ABV as far as beers go, but you would never be able to guess it by drinking it alone, and that's the beauty of it. I'd more closely compare this to a fine wine than a beer, and it should be enjoyed like the thing of beauty it is."

"Another excellent beer from Tröegs. This chestnut brown double bock has a nice head and some lacing. Pleasant malty aroma with some noticeable alcohol in the nose. Plenty of flavor here - the malt, hops, and roasted flavor combine with spice and fruit, and a slight bitterness balances the sweetness wonderfully. A thoroughly satisfying brew that stands up really well to the German greats."

"Overall: You won't be drinking this beer, I tend ot think you will be inhaling it, so smooth you crave it for dessert. No it not that sweet but it is that appetizing. Salud!"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’m enjoying this one and its good enough that I’m drinking it faster than I like, but its also not quite as challenging as some of the other dopplebocks I’ve had. That said it’s a tasty, drinkable beer which I’ve had more than once and will continue to have when the mood strikes."
"O- Not at all my style of beer and I have little to compare this to in the same genre but I like it. It's a nice ""one and done"" beer. I am happy to try this"

"This is as close to sessionable that a doppelbock can get."
"I don't think it's quite a classic but I do think it's quite good. I definitely approve of this, but it packs quite a kick obviously, so I will continue to take it slow."

"Well I guess this really fits the definition of a ""double bock"" beer. Its just not what I had expected after trying Ayinger's masterful Celebrator. Still good, though."
""
""

""

"Overall, not really my thing. I've had a few of Troegs better offers (nugget, hopback) so I was pretty disappointed with the Doublebock. It was my third try at it from this sixer too, so I gave it a fair shot."
"Alcohol is not apparent in the taste but is felt at the end. A sipping beer for me. Not one to pound several but that isn't what a dopplebock is about. I think my favorite is still Celebrator but this is definitely up there on my list of top doppelbocks. Worth drinking again...and again...and again."

"O - Seems like a good Americanized version if this style of beer. Definitely doesn't seem to be strictly to style, but adds a nice balance."
"This is a good one. If the color was a leather, you would call it oxblood. Lovely but quickly dissipating sepia head. Lacing is light, but consistent and appetizing. Smells like so many good things, I'm gonna go with...banana bread with a smear of Nutella? The taste is a similar miasma, grain notes dancing with that banana ester going on, some faint spicy hops, and a little bit of alcohol on the back (it is 8.2%, after all). Mouthfeel isn't syrupy as you would think, and makes this fairly heavy beer extremely drinkable. This is a beautiful, all-season beer. Highly recommended."

"Overall, a very good dopplebock, good representation of the style. I love the sweet flavors in combination with the roasted malt. Very good beer."

"Poured from a bottle into a pokal, the beer is a vibrant, clear, dark ruby-blood red coloring with a nice, light, inch and a half biege colored head. The head quickly settles into an eighth of an inch. Rich aromas, with a strong old world fruit presence of date, raisin, and fig, with a malty backbone. Flavors are dark and sweet, with the raisin, fig, and date present again, as well as a light roasting and toasty feel, and a slight boozey highlight. The aftertaste is slightly cloying, with an oily slick finish. Strong flavors, and a tasty brew."

"Overall, just a great example of this style. Definitely a little biased as this one my first real craft brews I tasted, but this is good representation of the doppelbock malty clean flavors."
"pours a clear ruby copper color with less than a quarter inch head that quickly fades to a skim cover and a spotty wispy lace. mild smell of dark fruits, sugary with hint of alcohol. taste is very good its complex and very sweet up front with fig, dried plums, raisin, caramel and toffee slightly spicy warm finish. mouthfeel lacks carbonation tends to flatten out. overall not bad taste really saves this beer."
"O: I like malty beers and bocks, but this is only the second doppelbock I've ever tried. Good, but not as good as Thomas Hooker's Liberator, IMO."
"D - this is a delicious doppelbock. Lots of really good malts flavors blend together to form a really solid example of this style from this side of the Atlantic."
"Poured a nice almost Mahogany color, not much head wise. The taste almost reminds me a of a trailmix snack bar,minus the sweetness. I got heavy notes of fruity goodness in the smell.Finishes a tad dry,only wanting another swallow to test that dryness again. Tasty brew overall."
"Overall this is a staple for the style. I use this beer as a gateway for my non craft drinking friends, and they all love it. Another knockout from Troegs."
"I could taste too much alcohol. Nice hints of raisin. You get a sweet raisin taste up front followed by a malty bread flavor then it ends with a slight hop bitter. The alcohol flavor overpowered everything else. I am not a huge bick fan this beer is true to the style if you are a big bock fan give it a try its just not the beer for me."
"Worth trying once, but I was a little underwhelmed by this one; felt like the sweet malt was a little too dominant, even for the style. ABV was pretty well-concealed."
"Drink- I love her to death for putting up with my beer habit. I thank her very much for finding this on a shelf, but its my fault for not teaching her to look for bottle dates. This one is on me. I wanted to be blown away like I was with Thomas Hooker and Ayinger but sadly wasn't. Ill try this one again someday fresher."
"Honestly, surprisingly awesome. Quite the well balanced beer with lots of surprises a beer drinker could want. Dangerously drinkable."
"O: Another solid effort by Troegs. Very drinkable for a relatively heavy beer/style. No sign of the 8.2% at all."
"<FlOglida>"
" Overall this is one of my favorite lagers,I usually get a sixer about once a month. Very good lager!"
"Notes: Easy as it is, and considering that I´m not too crazy about doppelbocks, it works pretty well. Not something that I would ever actively seek out, but worth the experience."
"O: Decent beer, but came across as a bit too boozy with a sticky sweetness."
"Overall - I think I expected more with this beer. It was good but no where near one of the better dopplebocks I've had. Happy that I gave it a try but I'd buy something else next time."
"This was my first attempt at cellaring a lager style. The main noticeable difference from its fresh counterpart seemed to be the elevated sweetness, while the original pungent qualities seemed to combine into one smooth continuous palate with the familiar dark fruits and sweetness hitting at the end."
"delicious for a beer with a high abv."
"O/D - For a beer that fits my style, I couldn't rank this up there with the better ones I've had. It has way too much residual sugar sweetness, causing roughness. Probably wouldn't reach for this again."
"D: strong sweet/malty character probably limits the number you would want to throw back in one sitting, overall not very complex but a tasty beverage"
"overall grade: A-"
"Overall I give it a 4.5"
"O - Easily one of the better Doppelbocks I've had, and one I'd happily drink again (and that's saying something since I'm usually not a fan of the style!)."
"Pours a dark amber with a with a pinkie size, white head. Almost no lacing left on the sides of the glass. Head diminished quickly and it looks like this beer is free of carbonation. Smells of raisins, sweet malts, and a bit of alcohol. As I'm typing this my dog dropped a wicked fart (must be the off-brand treats we got him), but I knew this wasn't part of the beer, but nonetheless through me for a loop and was a god awful smell. Taste is very sweet. I catch notes of dark fruits, mainly plums and raisins. The carbonation is light and the mouthful is thin. Not a very crisp finish. Overall this is an average beer (hint all 3's). I'm not a huge fan of the style; received this as an extra and glad to have tried it, but will not be disappointed if I never drink it again."
"O: Awesome Doppelbock. A nice sipping beer @ 8.25 % alcohol by volume. I’m liking this brewery more and more."
"O-Good example of the style and a very tasty beer. I haven't had a lot of troegs beer but thus far I have not been disappointed."
"Overall impression: A big, malty, immensely drinkable dopplebock. Worthy to sip and savor."
"A good beer overall, but a little sweeter than I like in a doppelbock."
"O: Solid beer, great experience, definitely will go back to this."
"Cheers"
"D/O- First and foremost, what really makes Troegenator, is the nicely hidden ABV for being 8.2% I don't believe it shows...which greatly enhances drinkability. Troegs nails it again, and while not the best dopplebock, Troegenator certainly holds it's own."
"O: Meh, mediocre doppel to me. I would like the beer to be a hare turbid, produce some head, more complex and layered flavor profile, a better feel and long finish ."
"Overall a very good, if slightly sweet, interpretation of the Doppelbock style. Would certainly go back to again if given the chance."
"I liked this beer. I may pick up more for Oktoberfest."
"Overall: I'd recommend trying this one out. It's a safe choice but also has some features that should keep you interested."
"The beer pours a burgundy, copper color with an off white head that quickly faded. It smells mostly of toasted caramel malt with a sugar cookie background and a hint of roasted malt. The taste is very smooth with flavors of buttered toast with some bread and chocolate. The beer is very smooth with moderate carbonation and a bready finish. This is an excellent double bock the ABV is well hidden and it's extremely smooth and drinkable."
"Finish is mellow, bitter but mild."
"O: All around a pretty good brew. Normally, I'm not a doublebock kinda guy, but this one hit the spot."
"O: I'm surprised at my rating. This used to be a beer I was VERY enthusiastic about. A great American staple of the style."
"Overall: It a nice dopplebock. I would like a bit more balance in this beer to tame the massive amount of malty sweetness. But...thats what a dopplebock is all about...the malt!"
"Overall I was pretty dissappointed with this brew"
"overall- a very solid dark beer. the first dobblebock i've tried."
"O - Very nice offering form Troegs. I would definitely have this again."
"O: I like this, there's a lot of spice character to the nose and flavor that really fits the body very well. Well rounded, and a nice handling of a style that can be a bit monotone with its dark fruit notes. This is definitely dark fruit jams, and not a two tone date/fig bomb. The cardamom spice flavor gains complexity as it falls into a mellow woody flavor. An earthy dark fruit spread that I wouldn't mind having on rustic bread. The mouth feel and taste make this a likeable offering."
"O: I only have the faintest memory of the one or two doppelbocks I've had in the past so I can't offer much in-style comparison or judgment here but I can tell you that this is an enjoyable beer. Packed with so much flavor it's just as much a snack as it is a beer. Refreshing, intense, good-- definitely worth giving this a shot."
"D - I wish this was a brewery that was more readily available in my area. This was a very solid brew, and in my opinion, a good variation of the style. Definitely worth a try!!"
"Good mouthfeel, flavors last fairly long thru the finish. Very drinkable. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Poured into a pint glass a hazy chestnut brown with a small, creamy, white head. Aroma was pretty weak, but roasty malts abound for the most part. Toasted bread and malts in the taste, dry and grainy, with hints of raisin and apple skin. Pretty strong alcohol sensation. Medium mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable, but only if it's my only option."
"(Notes from June 23, 2010)"
"D- 4 I definitely enjoyed this brew. It has a fairly strong aroma/taste combination that would be quite satisfying when in the mood. I feel it would be better enjoyed in the colder months like a winter ale would be (June at time of review). I could see myself having a few of these at that time, but probably no more than one or two right now. It is bold, but it is solid."
"Pours dark amber with a thin tan head. I only really got malt in the nose. Sweet flavor that has a lot of roasted malt as is to be expected in the bock. Not as heavy as some bocks I've had. Has a grat mouthfeel and finishes well. This is the beer I expect from troges"
"O: I will say that I quite enjoyed the Troegenator Double Bock. Was it the best of the style I've had? Not exactly as it didn't pack the same hearty character of German Dopplebocks. However, it was a great value for a more full flavored beer at 8.99 a six pack and served as a great stand in when I was quite feeling a stout."
"Overall, this is not a beer I would want to seek out."
"This is an exceptional beer, one of the best (in my opinion) I have ever had. Since I normally favor milk stout - I was surprised how much I really liked this beer - but I really do just love dark beer in general and this one is awesome! I had this at the ""Spotty Dog"" in Hudson, NY and also took a growler full to a Zombie Walk in Albnay later that day. This beer was great straight form the tap, slightly chilled, in a pint and also fresh from the growler out of a red plastic party cup! This is a deep, dark, malty-roasted, slightly sweet brew with a very distinct flavor - pleasing and thick. I may try from a bottle, but tend to find beer usually tastes best from the keg."
"Amber-red in colour. Pale taupe head is develops well, but falls short in retention and lacing. Nut and dried fruit aromatics, bready, a wine-like quality, even a hint of milk chocolate. Rich and malty in a way that makes allusions to liquid bread appropriate. Deeply concentrated raisin flavour. Honey. Finishes with an extremely light bitterness. Alcohol nearly imperceptible. Medium-bodied and lightly carbonated with a sticky, sugary mouthfeel. I have no idea what this beer is like fresh. I bought this bottle back in 2008, the same year I visited the NY state fair, and it has languished at the back of the beer closet since. With that said, this tastes really good now. It's not complex, but there is a great deal of depth and concentration in this with no real off flavours. This was a real pleasure to drink, and I'm glad I finally got around to pulling it out tonight."
"This has been on my to drink list for a while,finally after paying all my unpaid parking tickets I bought some.Now after chilling it some I'm enjoying this fine malted beverage.Its no doubt a good example of a dopplebock.It is low in carbination nor much of a head on this.SMELLS kinda fruity,with some hints of bread there.TASTE has a hint of fruit,dark liquorice,and a malty aftertaste to enjoy."
"O: It's interesting. I bought a six pack of these, and the flavors seemed to get a little dull after the first. It's my first foray into doppelbocks and I don't have a ton of experience with bocks, so I'll give more of these a taste and see how this one compares."
"Overall this is a very nice brew. Well balanced and refreshing. Hard to think that I would want to drink a beer this dark on a hot summer day but I do."
"A very sweet Doublebock, very drinkable and the alcohol very well hidden. I am glad that I bought this beer to try it and add it to my beer advocate collection."
"Anyway, mouthfeel is full and chewy but still on the lighter side, once again from the lager yeast (it just strips the full/fruity delicious maltiness from everything it touches). Don't get me wrong this is still a very good tasting beer, and one of the best of the style I've ever had, but will never have the complexity and flavor potential of a comparable ale with a similar malt bill."
"drinkability: would have liked it more stout like celebrator, but a good dopplebock"
"This was probably one of the first Doppelbock's I'd ever had. I didn;t know too much about them or what they were. What I quickly founf out though was how great this one tasted. I found this beer to be very nice from start to finish. The pour was a deep mohagany brown color with a nice looking tan head. The retention was pretty good through out. The smell is sweet with dark malts and some fruits in there along with a touch of hops. The flavors of the beer are pretty intense. The first thing you get is the sweetness of the malts and perhaps some brown sugar. The second thing I get are the roasted malts with some hops tingling my tongue. The aftetaste is try with some subtle sweet flavors still lurking in there. The mouthfeel is very drinkable I think. It makes this brew a little dangerous because of it's high ABV. However, it's a really nice brew one of the best from Tröegs without a doubt."
"O- A nice, easy to enjoy beer, and the 8.2% ABV is not noticeable at all. Definitely worth the money."
"Overall: Again probably would have enjoyed this one better if it wasn't so hot outside. I'm not the biggest fan of doppelbocks to begin with, but this one was enjoyable, although I have had better."
"Taste is very much like the aroma. This is a good doppelbock. Very bready/yeasty with rich fruits. Overripe red apples and caramel and some pine. Rich and complex sweet malt flavors swirling around in there. Well done."
"O: Yum. 4"
"D - Very drinkable for 8.2%. Not as thick and meaty as I'd prefer, but a delicious, kind of yeast-fruity treat."
"O- A very solid example of the style. One that I will purchase again."
"O- Some people might not light the extreme sweetness of this beer but I love it. I could not stop swooning over this beer. Almost reminds me of a Mad Elf"
"I want more."
"Pours a dark burgundy, minimal head and lace. Nose of dark fruits and some vinous qualities. Loads of malt, with a subtler sweetness overshadowed by bigger dryer dark breadiness. Some caramel notes also. Taste has more dark fruits, dry dark breadienss. Good mouthfeel, smooth, full and relatively dry finish. Alcohol doesn't come through substantially but can be sensed. This warms the bones nicely and is a nice dopplebock."
"O - A good brew, hard to drink more than one I would imagine due to the sweetness makes it relatively heavy even though the body is medium."
"Excellent doppelbock, one of the best in the states. A very bold fruity component, no doubt from the amount of munich malt. Fantastic."
"D: a strong, malty showing. alcohol isn't as detectable as i expected. overall, has the strength of a big sweet, chewy ale but the smoothness of a lager. a well made beer."
"The body is thin and the carbonation is mild. Overall, another doppelbock and another satisfied customer. This style is becoming a new favorite style for me. I would definitely drink another of these if I had a chance."
"A darn good doppelbock, though definitely on the sweet side. Fruity and sugary, which I like, but I recognize others might not. My advice: pour slowly, and you'll enjoy it much more."
"Overall a pretty weak Doppelbock. Then again, I haven't had any Doppelbocks brewed in America that can compare to what is brewed in Germany. We must find their secret..."
"Overall it was ok, the alcohol wasn't disguised at points in the taste, and the impression that lasted the longest was GRAPEFRUIT! This isn't my favorite Doppelback but it was a solid beer none the less."
"Overall, this is a good beer. It is definitely not a session beer as the sweet malts become too overpowering on the palate for more than one in a sitting."
"I miss having ready access to this stuff whenever the mood struck me to grab some. Oh well, that's what trading's for, right? It pours a clear dark garnet-russet topped by a relatively short-lived finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises caramel, figs, red grapes, toffee, butter, light cinnamon, and light rye bread. The taste seems to want to follow this directive, but a sharp nip of orange peel and astringent (though kinda light) coffee detract somewhat from the otherwise pleasant flavors. It's not enough to completely torpedo the proceedings, but enough to be negatively noticeable. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, lightly grainy feel. Overall, though a teensy bit thin and that touch bitterly unpleasant on the tongue, this is still a very solid d-bock. Generally good times."
"Verdict: I'm not a fan, but it's balanced well enough that it will appeal to many people."
"O= I can handle one per setting, that's about it. Not one that I enjoy for more, though. A nice experience for just the one. Maybe good with whatever would go well with a darker red wine."
"Overall-A well-made, clean dopplebock. Everything you look for: complex aromas and flavors, alcohol legs, warming. Needs more complexity in the flavor to truly be world class, but will definitely warm you up on a cold night. One of the better offerings from Troegs!"
"The Troegenator holds its status as one of my go-to doppelbocks because of it's availability and the fact that I can get it in 6-packs. All things considered, it's a pretty good doppelbock."
"Good solid beer. Great name."
"O - Very solid dopplebock an another good one from Troeg's"
"O: This one is extremely easy to drink. Nicely balanced. Had it later with Red Velvet and it was a perfect combo!"
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are really nicely balanced. There is a nice amount of dark fruit flavor, but it blends with the rest of the flavors really well."
"Pours a dark copper with a small off-white head. Smell is caramel. Taste is sweet throughout. Caramel. A litter herbal hops. Butter toffee. Very well balanced rounded taste. Full bodied. Very easily drinkable. Overall a very balanced and taste beer. Really great for an American doppelbock."
"O: Not the best doppelbock I've had tonight, but not a bad one by any means. Some deeper character and a bigger malt presence would help. 3.5/5"
"O - I've yet to meet a Troegs offering that I didn't like. This dopplebock, despite the relatively high ABV, is pretty drinkable."
"D- This one definitely grew on me from start to finish but still wouldn't warrant purchasing another one at the end, not nearly as drinkable as some of the other Troegs products like Nugget Nectar."
"O - Worth trying, but not my preference for the style."
"Cheers."
"D - A nice brew; not overly sweet, and not too boozy. Another good offering by Troegs."
"drinkable - yep - very."
"A dark copper with ruby edges flows out of the bottled adorned with an interesting looking character set off with bushy white hair and a nasty set of horns. I assume he is The Troegenator. Smells like bread and spice. Not a lot of hops here, but I do get some sweet, toasty bread, some spice in the finish with a bit of chocolate in the aftertaste. Not really bitter, and the 8.2% ABV is sneaky."
" Its a medium mouthfeel and goes down pretty easy. Its really drinkable, but maybe not at first. I came around to this beer quiet quickly."
"Fuller bodied than expected with lots of sweet malt, subtle chocolate and spice. Lots of clove, cinnamon and brown sugar balanced out by hints of sweet caramel malt, chocolate, toffee and hazelnut. Slightly toasted with some rye, toffee and biscuit flavor. Spicy up front, quickly balanced by the full malt body. Silky and flavorful with a well masked ABV making it dangerously drinkable."
"Pours reddish copper with a big tan head that recedes leaving some residual head behind. Smells of caramel malts, and has a breadiness about it from the yeast. Reminds me of another beer I can't quite place yet. Contains a hop bitterness and spiciness which is welcome along the warming alcohol flavor/sensation. Big body here which is helped out with a nice dose of carbonation. Big alcohol helps keep a slow and steady pace."
"Even though it's not a weak beer, I could easily have a few in a sitting. This goes well with tonight's NFL Network Top 10 Marathon and light snow that's falling right now and even though it's not on the level of Troegs' most popular beers, this is well-crafted and the sweetness hides the more potent aspects of this. Certainly worthy of the horned illustration on the bottle!"
"D: Sweet, malty, smooth brew. easy to drink, took me a bit to get used to but very enjoyable after a few sips."
"D- I could probably knock down a couple of these, but the high alcohol and sweetness would likely come in my way."
"D: Extremely drinkable for the style; this is by far the easiest-drinking (not to mention best) doppelbock I've had. I cannot BELIEVE this is an 8.20% ABV beer considering the light body and complete masking of the alcohol in flavor and scent. I've had it before and I'll have it again. Highly recommended if you have a chance to pick it up or trade for it."
"D. perhaps too sweet to drink several of them. i wasnt left wanting another right away, but i would drink this beer again down the road."
"D: I believe this one has aged nicely. The alcohol is completely gone and has a really nice malt presence. Definitely worth cellaring for a few years"
"Pours a dark crimson - almost looks like blood. Head is weak and so is carbonation. The color though. Very nice! Smells sweet, sugary, with a fruity smell of raisins, dates, apricots, and prunes overpower the malty goodiness of this beer - on top of everything, alcohol is hot and not hidden well. Tastes like it smells. Only the mouthfeel is killed with a hot alcohol finish that burns the mouth on down the hatch - not smooth which also doesn't make it extremely drinkable since after 2, you're either overly-intoxicated or just can't stand another sip of this overly-sweet bock. Troegs, I still love you though. I'm going to save a pair of these until next year and see if some time smooths out the flavor."
"The Tröegenator didn't really do it for me flavorwise. Really weak head, less than a finger, but with a nice, deep earthy malt aroma. Poured a nice deep reddish-bronze in the glass. Full-bodied, dry sweetness, with some bready flavor and a savory finish. The finish also had some unpleasant, lingering buttery/diacetyl things going on that severely cut down on the drinkability for me. I've had much more balanced doppelbocks, for sure, and better offerings from Tröegs."
"D: Dark, yet light body with lots of flavor make this beer pretty drinkable."
"1306"
"this 22oz bottle is another good winter beer, not repulsive at all even with double the alcohol of most other beers. A good treat, will definitely grab again."
"D: Actually easy to drink despite the high ABV. Fairly refreshing."
"The soft, plush mouthfeel stands out more than any actual flavor. Taste is mostly blah Munich toasted sweet with a chocolate malt whimper in back. Little hop spice."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. Pours a dark clear reddish color with a smallish creamy beige head. Smell is lightly smoky and sweet, musty malts. Tastes lightly smoky and a touch tart with toasty biscuity and caramel maltiness. Slight taste of alcohol in the finish. Full body and soft to medium carbonation. One of my favorite doppelbocks."
"Great beer. Good depth of flavor. Strong malt taste and pretty good drinkability. I had it a little cold at the start but when it warmed up ( I had a large bottle so on the second pour it was closer to ideal) the spicy notes came to life. The color of the beer was very appealing as well. I will say I think I enjoyed the beer more because Notre dame won while I was drinking it ha ha"
"D - Easy drinking, deceptive for it's ABV"
"I'd recommend this as a great American doppleback, I'd have again."
"Great example of a doppelbock and one of the best that I've had."
"Has a nice smell of malts, nuts and molasses. Has a great taste, a little hoppy for me but nice taste and medium mouthfeel. Drinkibility is not that great at least for me b/c of hoppiness."
"D -- Goes down smooth, a lot smoother than you'd expect from an ABV of 8.2%...lookin' forward toafew more of these while watching the JETS beat the PATRIOTS this afternoon! CHEERS!"
"This was an impulse buy at the local pizza shop. I've had Troeggs HopBack, and love it, so I thought what the hell. This is definitely a beer that can kick your ass before you know it. Pours with a head that goes quickly, but the hint of carbonation stays with it. Very malty, with a distinct alcohol aftertaste not found in most beers I've had. Great color! Not a fan of most bocks, but I'd buy this again."
"This is the first Troegs beer that I've tried but I want more!"
"D- Troegenator is a delicious brew. The flavors are so unique and you can really drink a ton of these.... until you realize it's 8.2%. Great job Troegs!"
"Smooth and somewhat creamy. The juicy dry finish makes me keep sipping."
"Drinkable yes, its not boozy like other doubles. The 8.3% abv hides well, but will sneak up later."
"D: Highly drinkable, easily can have more than one--the 8.2% ABV was somewhat of a surprise. Alcohol hidden very well. A very enjoyable beer."
"Very balanced in taste with the malts and sugars. Bananas on the finish with chewyness and guess what... HOPS.. imagine that. This is a GREAT tasting brew and I would have no problem drinking again for a doppelbock."
"Overall this was a nice doppelbock with some hints of cherry. Very well balanced and easy drinking!"
"A very nice sipping,slow drinker. Flavors and feels change as beer warms"
"D: Great beer. This has quickly become a ""go to"" beer for me and I tend to have some on hand. Has become a ""crowd pleaser"" with my friends."
"D: Pretty high for an 8.2%. Hardly a hint of any alcohol."
"D: A nicely crafted Doppelbock to chase the chill away. The 8.2% ABV warms while the robust malt body gives you something to chew on, almost literally. Good amount of fruity and herbal hop spiciness but very malt forward character is delivered here. More flavors jump out at you as the brew warms up a bit, which is recommended given its heft."
"D: at 8.2, this is a dangerously drinkable lager."
"It's easy to see why this is a popular brew. It's a very satisfying beverage."
"Overall: Overall the beer was a complex fruity doppelbock with hints of bitterness. I havent drank many of this style, but I enjoyed it, and would recommend other beer drinkers to try it."
"Cheers papa."
"This beer drinks very easily. I would to see this on tap somewhere, so I could enjoy more than the 11 ounces I have here."
"22oz bottle. I bought it to try with a duck. Pours a dark red with no head and Champaign like carbonation (I had to switch a glass to a flute). Aroma is of cherry, caramel malt with slight hoppy notes. Full, sparkling body. Flavor starts off sweet, caramel malt, dark fruit and molasses with some alcohol and earthy notes at the end. Quite tasty, heavy brew."
"D - Nice flavour but too sweet for me."
"Overall: A great beer. Festive and bold. Feels like it really captures the spirit of --ator type beers as a winter holdover."
"D - Very drinkable for the style. The sweetness isn't overpowering and the hop blance keeps it fresh on your palate."
"D - Just the right sweetness for doppelbock. Good beer overall. I would recommend it."
"This is a surprisingly easy drink for its ABV; very rich in flavor but not overpowering. I need to check out more of this style."
"Pours a dark red bordering on mahogany. A very clear beer. Light tan head fades fairly quickly. Aroma is muted, but some toasted grain aroma comes through. The flavor is pretty big, and is dominated by toasted grains, some caramel, and alcohol. The alcohol presence is pretty big for a beer of 8.2% abv. Mouthfeel is good for the style, but drinkability suffers from the noticeable alcohol flavor. I love doppelbocks, and love six packs, and Troegenator is one of the few American options as far as this style is concerned. It is, however, still not up to par with the German brews of this style."
"Overall a good Double Bock that I enjoyed drinking. Saw it at the super market and it picked my curiosity since it was a brand I never saw before. Flavor and colour was good, with an enjoyable aftertaste. Tasted the same throughout the bottle. A bit strong at 8.2% alchohol content."
"D - It's a brew to sip with it's strong, aggressive body and rich sweetness. The flavor is a sad departure from the deep nose offering a rather bland malty sweetness. Good dopple otherwise."
"D: Easy drinker, probably on the sweeter side for some. For me its alright, not doing anything special for me really. Maybe a decent example of the style, but really its a huge malt bomb that is actually hard to drink towards the end from the sweetness."
"This beer is dominated by a really nice, malty sweetness that completely disguises the 8% ABV. Color is a dark reddish brown. Not a huge kick-up of head, and not a ton of retention, but the carbonation is restrained well, making this a very drinkable brew. This malty mammoth is a keeper."
"Overall, this one was a bit of a challenge when it came to identifying all of the flavors. What surprised us about this brew was the vibrant red coloring, and the overt hoppiness to the beer's final taste. This is certainly a unique doppel."
"D- Smooth, clean, and a great beer. Lots of flavor and quite complex. Hops and malts mix well together to give this a very good taste that easily hides any trace that there is 8.2% alcohol in this wonderful beer. I really do like this brew."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. It's a full bodied well balanced beer that starts strong and finishes clean. Waited a long time to try this, not the best dopplebock I've ever tried, but I like it and it's very readily available. I'm sure I'll get it again."
"Bottle. Pours a clear reddish brown mahagony color with a nice 1 1/2 cinger slightly off white white that collars around the glass. The aroma is rather subtle and clean with notes of malt and caramel. Medium mouthfeel. The flavors I get out of this are raisin, plum, banana, all mixed with a slight bitterness. The alcohol notes are also rather subdued. The mild bitterness as the end is not something I am super keen on but otherwise this is a pretty nice drinker."
"D -- Good drinkability, even at 8%. Very true to German style, makes me reminisce of the Salvator Keller."
"D - Fairly high for a double bock with this much ABV. One of my go to beers when I am at a bar with less than desirable options on draft. A great example of the style and great for a cold day like we have been having around here lately."
"Maybe I had an old or bad sample? Worthy of a name like Troegenator? Not today. And I'm generally a big fan of Troegs."
"Troegs, you have made these hard days simpler."
"D- Complex and deep. Very robust and savory. Strong with a bit of rum sweetness and bite. If served cold you don't notice its 8%. Smooth and goes down very easy. It will sneak up on you. Each beer gets better."
"Definitely worth getting."
"D- After 3 of them, i started to get full, and a little bit of a headache. I don't know if it had anything to do with the Phillies going back and forth with the Giants all night, but I only drank the 3. I think I could have finished 6 to myself, but I would probably end up pretty reckless. Needless to say, you can definitely drink a lot of these."
"d - Really drinkable for the ABV, it tastes like 5.5 or 6%, tops. I could have 3 or 4 in an evening, easily."
"Pours a moderate brown color bordering on chestnut with a nice off white head. However, not much lacing at all as it goes down the side of my pilsner glass. The nose brings some lighter amounts of dark fruits as well as caramel and toffee. The flavor is mainly dominated by a bit of caramel and some bread. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation and a bit of booze. Drinks quite well."
"After writing this review and still nursing the second half of the bottle, it occurred to me just how close the aroma and smell of this beer are to rum cake from the Bahamas (good rum cake you get from asking locals in Nassau where to get it, not Bacardi cake from the airport). They're very similar... noticing this has made me like this beer quite a bit more."
"The beer is a lovely full bodied brew as it settles after the pour with a creamy head that is slow to go away. The color is dark with a shine in the light. The smell is full of robust caramel and nice malts. It tastes like a very well brewed doppelbock should. It is big and strong, slightly bitter, and very robust. It feels big, strong and robust as well and is drinkable but not a beer you wan to have too many of. The Troegenator is a style I really like and a brew that I think is great."
"d- totally drinkable, i'm not a bock fan in general, but i gotta say that i didn't hate this one, the best (and only) dopplebock i've had haha."
"Pretty tasty, easy drinking. Definitely worth some more goes."
"Taste is better than any doublebock I've ever had. Excellent mix of sugar and dark fruit - with a medium body that is very smooth. No discernable alcohol flavor, overall very enjoyable drink."
"Drinks: easily. For a dopplebock, Troegenator's not too overbearing and pretty enjoyable."
"Of course it pales in comparison to Salvator, but it can compete surprisingly with some of the other German doppelbocks, very nice from Troeegs."
"Believe the hype. This beer has garnered a cult status over the years, and it's a delicious beer that easily ranks within our top Doppelbocks worldwide."
"D - Well put to gether Doppelbock. Medium bodied easy drinker. Some taste of dark malt, caramel and nutmeg. I got this as an extra in a trade. I recommend this brew!"
"(14)"
"D - For an 8.2% this is nearly sessionable, good stuff, and a nice surprise."
"meh. drinks ok. nothing special, very safe. though alcohol is apparent, its not as strong as it could be for an 8+% beer."
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to sip (the alcohol is well masked) but there's no way that I could have more than one of these in a single sitting given its high alcohol content."
"Deep mahogany red in color with a thin beige head that didn't hold up for long. No cap or lacings. Sweet malty aroma, including dark fruit aromas, dark cherry and plum. Medium to full bodied. Smooth and a bit syrupy. Flavors are similar to aromas. Sweet malty flavors in the beginning that lead caramalized fruit with a bit of spice and malty sweet finish. Nicely balanced and easy to drink,"
"Probably the only thing holding this beer back for me is the sweetness; frankly, I'm partial to strong beers. But it's definitely worth trying at least once."
"D - Smooth, clean, and a great beer. Lots of flavor and quite complex, yet its easy to just ignore that and quaff a glass or two."
"Over all a good Beer, creamy, warm flavors."
"D: I would love to drink a sixer of this, but am regretting buying the bomber. Was hoping for something more unusual."
"Drinkabilty - This aint a bad beer. There should be much more to it. I wouldnt buy a case of this, nor would i order it out. Maybe since ive had Ayinger Celebrator im spoiled but man, the difference is huge. Troegs where is the kick?"
"Overall: I am a big fan of Troegs, however, this is one brew in their line-up that I think could use some work. Admittedly, this style isn't my favorite, but this is still sort of a ""by the numbers"" Doppelbock."
"Overall its a good brew. Not my favorite from Troegs by any means, but I was impressed this time around. I had the pleasure of doing a brew tour earlier in the spring and tried this, didnt think too much of it then but after giving it another chance it was good. Will definitely buy another case in the future. Nice way of introducing me to the Dopplebock style, thanks Troegs."
"Pours a deep, dark-reddish amber with a decently thick, respectable amount of light brown head. The smell is fairly simple, with pronounced malt tones - a given. Taste is, again, malty with a hint of bread and caramel. Throughout the drink, the head subsides more and more, with little-to-no lacing, as the mouthfeel begins to seem more and more light (and hot); a stark contrast to how it began. Moderate drinkability because of the high ABV (8%), but I would reckon that could be the main selling point of this beer (it was for me)."
"great dopplebock. Looking forward to another pint"
"D: A double bock is, personally a very drinkable style. I find this Troegenator to be very well done. I would love to have this all the time. Great PA brew."
"Overall this beer smells clean with a slight alcohol note. Served from a tap it poured nicely with a thick tan head and mohagany body. Carbonation is slight and lacing is very present. It has a rich full malt body with nutty and salty notes. Very roasted and thirst quenching. It is somewhat light on mouthfeel for this style and is not drying. This beer is drinkableanytime and is not as heavy as most dopple bocks. Relatively true to style."
"I can see why its one of Troeg's flagships. This a good beer that is always a good bang for your buck."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little below average carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's an excellent beer overall. It's very flavorful and well balanced for the style. It doesn't feel like a big beer either and went down remarkably smooth. Very good overall."
"D - This is a very tasty dopplebock. I'm glad I got to try this one."
"Despite it's high ABV and its style as a double bock, this one is not overpowering or too complex. The different flavors balance each other out, making this one frighteningly easy to drink."
"D- the alcohol taste puts me off a little, as does the complexity...but its not a bad beer. Good example of the style"
"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a perfectly clear, ruby-red color with lots of rising carbonation and three fingers of tan head that quickly fell back to a one-finger layer. The retention was so-so overall and left small spots of lacing. The aroma was a malty blend of raisins, caramel, toffee, alcohol, currants and hint of sourness. The flavors were similar minus the sour element and plus some wood, nuts and some light toasted malt. The raisins really came through in the middle and though it was surprisingly (dangerously!) drinkable for 8.2% the alcohol heat did really come through towards the end. As it warmed up I also picked up some semi-sweet chocolate. Rich and maltastic, this one really coated my tongue. The mouthfeel was average, the body full and the carbonation good too."
"Drinkability is good for what it is. I wouldn't want this after a long run, an afternoon of yardwork, or a barbeque in the dog days of summer. On the other hand, I'd say it's a good warm-weather dessert beer drunk cold and out of a goblet."
"Overall, a decent doppelbock. Fairly easy to drinking. Big and malty with some rich flavors which is good for the style. Glad I got a chance to try this one."
"I'd drink this again, but probably wouldn't go too far out of my way for it."
"Drinkability- Although it isn't a typical Bock, Troegenator's Double Bock is delicious enough to drink a few of. Just be careful if you make a session of it because of the 8.2% abv"
"D - Pretty drinkable. This is a very interesting tasting beer and Troegs's crafting decisions with this are clearly very bold. This is not an ordinary Doppelbock. Tastes a lot like Founders' Curmudgeon if Founders had more modesty with that brew (God love them - they are great - but I think they could have done better with that brew). You come to expect great things from Troegs - this is what they do time after time - and this is another great brew that I hope I will have the chance to enjoy again sometime soon. Solid."
"One of the go to beers. Alcohol prevents sessioning but overall a very good beer."
"Pours a rich mahogany color with 1 finger of head that fades to a thin cap with no lacing. Big malt aroma greets the nose, with lots of toasted and molasses notes mixing. The taste follows the aroma, with a big, toasted, malty body. This beer is all malt, with just a hint of piney hops on the way out before a very astringent finish. Body is full, and I would rate drinkability as very good, but I'm partial to the style. Overall a very tasty DB that hides it's 8.2% ABV very well."
"I may be exaggerating the ""cough drop"" tip a bit, but I'm calling it like I see it. This is a pretty damn fine beer, nonetheless. A great take on the style. I will be abusing a sixer at some point in the future."
"Drinkability -- Thought it was a bit heavy and under-carbonated. Given the deep red hue I was expecting more roast character, but to no avail. Not great, but certainly not bad."
"D - As I said, combination of the overthetop taste and mouthfeel make it hard to have more than one or two in a sitting. I guess that's what 8.2% will do."
"o - simple beer. not too much going on, although the taste good."
"Pours a very dark amber, almost brown colour. Started out with a thick white head, but that dissipated without too much lacing. Smells very fruity, almost like prunes or raisins. Taste has the fruitiness, with a grainy roasted malt flavour. I think I'm getting some nuttiness too. There is a little bit of bitterness, but not too much. Very smooth carbonation."
"Clear, dark amber with a creamy tan head that quickly burns off into a thin cap, a bit light looking for the style. Sweet, roasty malt, chocolate and some dark fruit make up the nose. Rich and toasty malt flavors are nicely balanced with spicy noble hop bittering. The alcohol is really well hidden. Medium bodied with bright carbonation. A dangerously drinkable 8+ ABV dopplebock."
"I tried this in a bottle recently and just had it on draft. I'm rating the draft version because it was just a little better but not much difference. Right before I tried the bottled version I tried a very expensive (and German) beer of the same style. I was impressed that this beer really held its own. It has a slightly thick dark brown/reddish color and a slightly viscous feel. Dark fruit and malt comes through, very little hop presence. I can't wait to revisit this one in cold weather."
"Troegenator appears a clear dark amber color with a thin lace of tanned bubbles across the top for a head. Faint rising bubbles of carbonation rise to the surface and collect around the inside perimeter of the glass and appear with a color that is slightly stained yellow. Aroma of this beer is pretty much dominated by the scent of malt leaning towards being a bit like dark caramel or a bit like molasses, only a faint trace of hops is present and the slightest touch of butter. Taste is malty sweet with flavors of caramel, slight molasses, and just a bit of buttery tones with a minor hop bitterness and nice alcohol warmth. Medium feel with a modest amount of carbonation and a increasing amount of alcohol character as the beer warms. Once Troegenator warms, it displays a greater depth of the malt profile with flavors that are at times a bit nutty. Overall pretty good."
"After not being that fond of Victory's St. Victorious, I've come to the conclusion that I'm just that big a fan of this style and rarely seek out another bock after finishing one. Knowing that this is a personal preference, I rated it against my impression of St. Victorious when it came to ""drinkability"" to be fair."
"The main difference between the aged version and the fresh version is the aroma and taste. The aged version is much more raisiny and is starting to show signs of oxidation from the flavors of figs and slight sherry. I'm glad I found this bottle. Delicious. I recommend buying a few of these and tasting them as the years pass."
"D: Very drinkable for the style, despite not reflecting the style very well IMO. Overall, a fun beer to try, but not overly impressed and certainly doesn't compare to the true doppels of Germany."
"Overall a great beer that hides its high abv with silky smooth flavors. Not a beer that will blow you away, but a beer that does a great job of representing the style"
"Overall a decent doppelbock, but not quite what I was hoping from Troegs. It's way too sweet, not enough dark wheat and toasty malt flavors, and a slight bad lager aftertaste. However, its still a solid beer."
"I have to be careful on the drinkability rating- I prefer a beer with more hop notes (and many times WAY MORE hop notes), but this was the first Dopplebock that i've tried and It's not a favorite. To be fair, I'd have to say that if you like malt forward brews you may very well enjoy this."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability is very good, overall pretty balanced, and a good beer to have with a meal. Im glad I tried it, but nothing super special."
"It appears slightly hazy reddish brown with a tan head that falls to a ring. Smells of sweet roasted malt, caramel, honey, dark fruit - a rich and sweet nose. The taste is trailing the smell somewhat. Rich and malty, nutty some caramel but doesn't have the depth of the nose. The body is medium and the carbonation is average in level. Overall a decent brew but certainly not great."
"Thick dark brown brew with mahogany highlights when held to a light. 3/4"" of mocha foam settles to a dense and bubbly layer. Hearty malt nose, dark candy sugar, a bit of smoke, warm mulling spices. Scotch-like flavors of smoke, leather, tobacco... pretty unique and enjoyable. I'm finding a bunch of different things in here as it warms... thick malt backbone, loads of bread, burnt caramel, grapefruit rind, mulling spices, walnut, black cherry. Finish is long and moderately bitter. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, good carbonation, EtOH well hidden. Very hearty and filling."
"D-it's not a bad substitute for Ayinger Celebrator in terms of availability and price, but not taste. for 8% or so it goes down very easy. that alcohol is almost virtually hidden, so be careful."
"Troegenator is a dense, vermillion lager with a dense, beige head that fades to a film with oily bubbles that leaves outstanding lacing. The aroma is a little faint with notes of slightly sweet malt and bread, along with something herbal and grassy. It's medium-full bodied and pretty smooth. The finish is a little starchy and syrupy. All of the flavor comes late in the taste. There's a pretty prominent herbal bitterness and the sweetness hints toward dark fruit and raisins. Alcohol is present in the flavor as black pepper and it provides some warmth. I find it pretty difficult to get excited about lagers. I don't go out of my way for this kind of beer but I would gladly drink another one of these."
"Pours dark amber/red, nice pour, bubbles nicely and reduces to a light foam around the edge. Taste is malty, sticky, syrupy, thick beer, I haven't had alot of the doppel, but I have had similar beers I have liked more. Taste the hops slightly, has a bit of a sticky after taste. Somethings seems to be missing for me, I think it could use a little more flavor, a little something extra. Maybe it is just staying true to the style, but I think it is pretty average overall for a premium micro brew. I would expect something like this from Sam Adams, I guess I was expecting more. My 1st Troegs, I'd try a different beer from them though. If doppelbock is your thing you might be more into it."
"The pour is a red/chestnut brown with a sizable off white head after a pretty aggressive pour. Smells of sweet toffee and caramel. A pretty staggering amount of sweetness for me. Lots of caramel malts and some dark, dried fruits (cherries, prunes, and raisins.) The alcohol was hidden pretty well. Pretty smooth going down, just too sweet for me."
"Color was a unique dark reddish-brown with a decent off-white head that stuck around for a while. Not a whole lot of scent until it warmed up a bit, earthy malts. Taste is very sweet and molasses-like. Hardly any hops to speak of, but in the end, good. Like a beer shake. Creamy feel and very easy to drink."
"(Bottle into dimpled mug - sampled 3/9/10) Poured a flat reddish brown with a one finger head that fell fairly fast. Scents of the rich molasses and toffee took over at first and with a little sit, some heady fruit odors came forward, in particular some raisin. A nice medium body with a small carbonation enhances the flavors that come through, again the molasses, and actually a hint of melted butter, which, while off putting at first, grew on me. The alcohol is definitely present, which serves to warm you up quite a bit, leaving you quite content after drinking. I wouldn't recommend any more than 2 at a sitting, however!"
"Overall, I liked it and enjoyed sitting around with my buddies on a warm spring day with huge mugs of beer. While not my favorite dopple, it remains pretty true to style and is something I would enjoy again when I'm in a malty mood."
"D- a litTle too sweet for me but nicely drinkable for such a big beer. Alcohol is discreet and feel is so smooth that this one could disappear a little too quickly."
"Troegenator is pretty to-style, but it didn't wow me. I appreciated the low carbonation and drinkability of this still hefty brew."
"1/2 finger white head, quick dissipation no lacing. Medium brown clear body. Nose is caramel malts, a bit sweet, minimal roast presence. Taste follows the nose, a bit boozy. Mouthfeel not very effervescent, close to style. Drinkability pretty good despite ABV. Not my cup of tea but close to style, worth seeking out for DB fans."
"Overall this is the best bock I have had to date. I really enjoy this offering from Troegs and find myself liking them more and more with each beer I try by them."
"d-this beer is good for sipping and enjoying this beer was very filling and probably would not be the best beer to drink for a longer period of time"
"Drinkability - Given that this is a hefty brew in every sense of the term, disrespectful things can be done with this beer. Session beer? No. This is by far the most drinkable beer at this ABV I have enjoyed to date."
"D- This is a very easy drinking doppelbock. The 8.2% is not obvious at all. It drinks like a much lower abv beer. A very nice doppelbock for the late winter season."
"D: Very much so, considering how well-balanced it is."
"The appearance of this brew was quite nice. It poured a deep red amber with an off white head. Little lacing left on the glass. However, the smell was bit of an oddball for me and I couldn't quite tell what I was smelling, there was a definite fruitiness to it as well as some caramel. This beer has a perfect amount of carbonation, it didn't tingle too much but nor was it non existent. The initial taste of the beer was somewhat sweet with an interesting dark fruit and malt flavor. The finishing flavor was wheat and alcohol. Can't say that the alcohol is masked during the drinking process, but it is very pronounced at the end. Overall, this is an interesting brew, definitely worth a try."
"Pours dark muddy crimson, small off white head. The smell is sweet, ripe dark fruits and bready malt. The taste is very sweet dark cherries (real ones) and other dark fruits with bready malt in the background. The finish is a little bit cloying. Mouthfeel is pretty thin and I found the alcohol very noticeable. I didn't expect quite this level of booziness. Due to the sweetness and alcohol presence in the taste one is more than enough. I got three Troegs beers as extra in the trade and this is the first that has kind of let me down. That being said I am starting to think I just don't like doppelbocks that much in general."
"D - Very drinkable and almost refreshing after the heat."
"It's far too delicious to sip, a danger at 8.2% to be sure. Not a perfect dopplebock by any means, but a seriously tasty one."
"D: At 8.2%, dangerously drinkable. Very sweet with a thin body that makes it go down easy. Big malt profile is nicely balanced so that this isn't just a beer for someone with a sweet tooth. Not really much else to say here except try it. A great beer in my opinion!"
"Just had this beer on tap and wow another great beer from troegs.A great ruby color with a creamy 3 finger head served in a 12oz tulip glass.Slight bread aromas are present with a touch of sweetness.The sweetness continues in the palate but nothing over powering.Perfectly balanced.Finishes smooth."
"D - Very good drinkability as the alcohol remains mostly hidden. I could easily down a couple bombers of this with how smooth it goes down."
"This is not a ""bad"" beer. It simply is nothing special and not all that food friendly or drinkable. However, bottle has a cool label, I'll give it that!"
"Pours a deep, reddish, chestnut brown with a respectable creamy head on top. A big hit of dark stone fruits hits me with my first whiff, but further sniffs reveal a bready malt sweetness that I'd expect from a doppelbock. The flavor is almost an inverse of the aroma, with a dry caramel malt sweetness first and the dark fruits creeping in underneath. Certainly not overly sweet, though, and a combination of spicy/earthy hops and alcohol follows to provide balance. The texture continues on a similar theme, with an undercurrent of sweet smoothness at the base, and a prickly combination of carbonation, hops, and booze riding on top. It does seem a bit boozier than I would have expected at 8.2%, but it's interesting, complex, and a welcome diversion on a cold, rainy winter night."
"Overall a nice example of this style, plan to age a few bottle to see how it does....quite a nice brew from the Troegs bros!"
"D- A really solid doppelbock; reminds me of some of those I've had in Germany, but with a bit more toffee and caramel flavor."
"Pours a clear, deep amber color with a little more than a finger width of head. Doesn't stick around long and leaves very little evidence, however. Has a great malt nose with a mix of sweet notes like caramel and toffee and some roasted nutty/earth scents. Taste is delicious and a bit unique for the style. The ratio of hops to malt is fairly balanced with some earthy/spicy hops making an appearance in the palate. Has a full mouthfeel without feeling heavy or chewy. Consistent the whole way through. A fantastic offering from Troegs and a personal favorite of mine."
"Pours a dark reddish color with half inch of tan head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Hardly any lacing is left on the glass. Good aroma with a toffee malt element taking charge. Hints of nuts, probably almonds is also quite noticeable. Strong malt flavor as well. Toffee and almonds being the most noticeable elements. Not as sweet as other doppelbocks. Alcohol is completely hidden. The body is not as full and rich as I would like. Still maintains some substance and a nice soft carbonation. More drinkable than other doppelbocks because it is not as sweet. The alcohol being as hidden as it is could make this one sneak up on the drinker."
"D - How did I manage to go so long without reviewing one of my favorite brewery's flagship beers?! Shame on me! This is another one I take for granted simply because it's available all over Central PA. Great during the colder months, Troegenator is simply just a fine example of a dopplebock."
"Had a snow day in NY, so I decided this would be a nice one to have during a lazy movie marathon. Pours a dark colour with a red tint you can see in the light, with a big foamy tan head. Smells sweet and hearty, like stone fruits and nuts, especially almond. There's a strong, yeasty kick, too. The taste is equally pleasing: its got a big flavor, and whatever those fruits are (plums? raisins? Can't put my finger on it), you definitely taste them. The sweetness comes through but has a nice balance with the bitter, strong, hoppiness that you get towards the end. The mouth feel is thick, heavy, but smooth. It's substantial but easy to drink more than one of these. Thoroughly enjoyed this brew."
"Drinkability: Fantastic beer but the only reason I wouldn't have a few of these in a night is its abv. However it's a great brew that is designed for days you want to warm up."
"-D- Amazing. So smooth. Each sip I had left me wanting more. One of my favorites right now. I prefer this one at at a warmer temp so it got even better as the glass went on."
"Interestingly, Troegenator improves enormously with age. Softens nicely, and shows many of the complexities of a barleywine (plus roasted flavors) in a relatively light, compact form."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with no bottled on date. This is a beer I have had many times and certainly enjoy each time. A dark amber tan color with about 2 inches of abundant head. Malts and caramel dominate the flavors. With roasted almost nutlike scents. Mouthfeel is great and highly drinkable in nature."
"Very relaxed and drinkable dopplebock. I would have no problem having several of these in a row."
"I'm definitely buying this one again."
"An average drinkability that paired quite well with a brie cheese beef burger on a lightly toasted English muffin."
"Dangerously drinkable though. Good rich flavour, and very pleasant."
"Cheers!"
"This is an exceptionally drinkable brew. It has such a wonderful clarity to the palate, which leaves it quaffable and delicious despite the alcohol content. This is truly comparable to the best German examples - once again, the US shows me what it is capable of. Tröegs really know what they are doing with this brew, and showcase a truly world-class doppelbock. Astonishingly good."
"Overall, sort of disappointed. Even among a style that I'm not particularly a fan of, this isn't among my favorites."
"The beer pours reddish-brown with an off-white head. The aroma is very malty with cherry. The flavor is more of the same, with sweet malt and a heavy cherry flavor. You get some caramel malt but the sweet cherries are the predominant flavor. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Pours a nice reddish amber color with a big creamy head. Aroma is of fruity malts, caramel, and bit of cherry. Taste is lots of malty flavors, with some spice and a hint of caramel. A very good brew with a lot hidden inside. It is extremely drinkable, very smooth, medium mouthfeel, and medium carbonation."
"Overall the first time I had this it tasted like a hop fest but it has either mellowed over the years or my taste for hops is more tolerable. Regardless it beat the pants off my last years ""tastes like a spicy lager"" to now ""a damn great bock!"""
"Has a very nice semi spicy taste to it. Has spice taste sort of similar to Midas Touch; but it doesn't flare, build, and disappear like Midas Touch does. It's just there and stays there."
"This was my first experience w/ a Doppelbock. Very thin beer w/ little head and lacing. The color was a light amber brown you could see though. There was really no scent going on, very bland. The taste was a little better but I suppose this isn't my style. I will say it was a high drinkability and goes down pretty smooth. Definitely a Troegs beer."
"Drinkability: Its a pretty decent beer, but I wouldnt seek it out. There are better dopplebocks, lots better. I wouldnt turn it down. Overall, its just not big enough tasting malt wise."
"After my first glass, it reminds me somewhat of the Spatan Optimator. This is a compliment to the accuracy to the beer style. Would go great with some traditional German fare. Tonight, I had it with a bowl of homemade chili and I thought they went very well together."
"A treat to find this in Massachusetts now."
"Overall this is a well-crafted Doppelbock by Troegs and certainly one of the more approachable for the style. Recommended."
"D-this is very good! lots of sweet malty flavors and a huge body, a definite winner for me"
"head is thin and just sits flat on the top, great clear amber color with perfect little bubbles floating around lightly. Not really getting much on the smell, just a hint of malt and hops, nothing pronounced. On the first sips I am getting roasted malts and light hops, on the next couple I am picking up a nice caramel taste at the end, very well balanced flavors all around. As for mouthful it is def thick and chewy leavy your mouth dry, wil probably follow this up with some water. Makes a great winter brew on these colder days to warm me up, will start adding this one to my regular rotation, another great one from troegs"
"D - Very good drinkability here. Smooth flavor and mouthfeel makes for a beer that goes down easily."
"Drinkable...not my favorite for the style, but a decent brew none the less."
"Overall: You can tell that the Bros at Troegs brew the beers that they enjoy - to the benefit of their customers! If you are fortunate to be able to venture to Harrisburg, you should definitely stop in for a Saturday tour. I also recommend picking up the locally, hand-crafted Trogenator ceramic drinking horns. It holds the full 22oz and the only downside is that you can't put it down once it's filled! :-D"
"Another great brew from Troegs and a must have for the winter season."
"D - I wouldn't want to drink too many of these. Aside from the high ABV, it is a bit thick and filling. Enjoyable, none-the-less."
"D: Despite the high ABV, this is a pretty good session beer. Still, the ABV is hidden so well, it can definitely sneak up."
"This was a pretty good beer with good flavor."
"Overall a pretty good beer."
"D: All night. A very well made beer, really no complaints. Troegs strikes again!"
"D: highly drinkable. The 8.2% alch is hidden well. Very nice full tasty dopplebock that cleans up enough for another drink...but not so much to forget about it."
"D: It's solid, but not particularly amazing. I wouldn't mind having this again, although I doubt I'll make the effort to trade for it."
"Poured copper brown into a pint glass, with a thin off-white head, but very good lacing. The smell was very malty, with some hints of caramel and molasses. The taste revealed the same, but was very malty sweet. What aids the consumption of this beer is the thinner than expected mouthfeel. Certainly helps the sessionability too. One more thing...the alcohol content is fairly well-hidden."
"Very sweet beer, with a taste of roasted malt and a touch of carbonation and hops. Overall, I find it to be well balanced all around. The 8.2% abv just starts to show itself in the end. This is a great change of pace from my usual favorite IPAs. The only negative I can think of is that it may not be the best session beer. I'd much rather sip and enjoy this than pound down and be drunk after a few beers."
"This beautifuL beverage was poured from a 22 oz into my favorite pint glass. The copper color and medium head was a sight to behold. The sweet smell was second only to the ultra-sweet taste. No hops at all, this was all malt. Mouthfeel was surprisingly thin for the alcohol content. This was dangerously easy to drink."
"D: Really good for a dopplebock in that I could have a few and not feel too full, but I'm sure I'd be pretty intoxicated."
"rather than detail each individual attribute, i'll just say that I really like this beer. It's a great example of a double bock. It has a heavy, smoky, rich flavor with great maltiness that finishes pretty clean. Definately a strong beer; not overpowering, but not for the faint of heart. Great beer that I love to drink every fall/winter!"
"Not a bad choice for a doppel."
"D- This is not my go to style for beer, but I am excited about pairing this with the turkey to challenge my wife's red wine pick. Overall a good beer that I am glad to have had an opportunity to try."
"D) A nice doppelbock. Well crafted."
"Beer is super smooth, wonderful. Malt sweetness, nice medium to full body. No harsh flavors or solvents. Finishes nicely, has some dryness on the backend. Drinkability high."
"Drinkability: An average dopplebock. Certainly not the best. I prefer the German versions better and this one certainly doesn't stack up. Still worth a try though."
"I'm really surprised with how easy it is to take down this beer and giving it a second chance (I didn't like it the first time around) was a great idea. It's way too drinkable and certainly one of the better American versions of this classic German style."
"Sweeter than your average doublebock, but nice if you like the style."
"d- not bad for being a boozy beer,"
"this also is a good beer for cellaring."
"D - High. This stuff is really great. One of the better examples of the style. Makes me proud to say I'm from the 'burg."
"D - I recommend drinking this at almost room temp. The flavors are much more pronounced at that point. Really easy to drink with no offensive smells or tastes. I just want more body!"
"Probably my favorite beer from Pennsylvania, and the first bock besides Aventinus that I've had a chance to truely enjoy"
"Overall I like this beer alot and would definitely seek it out on my future journeys to the beer peddling establishments I frequent!"
"D: I started struggling to finish towards the end of the drink."
"Drinkable, but a bit sweet, and the alcohol does creep up on you."
"I liked it alot. Not what I was expecting, but still a very enjoyable beer. Would go great with asian foods. For some reason it reminded me of something I get at asian (Japanese) restaurants. Which is what made me think of ginger. But still can't quite put my finger on it."
"Not great, but another nice effort by Troegs."
"dr. As Diana Krall would sing, ""S'wonderful. S'marvelous"" Really, really good. The sweetness could get to be too much after a bit. But, man one ought to be enough!"
"A very solid rendition of the style. I have been targeting doppelbocks lately and so I find myself being harder on this one just due to comparison to others. This a a very easy drinking version of the style, but is a step back from some of the top German ones, and is way behind in intensity you see in the Sam Adams version. This might actually be a gateway to the style. You don't taste or smell the booze in this one, and the flavors are clean and bright and balanced, but seem a bit lighter than I would have wanted. Still, I would buy this again. Great beer for the Fall or Winter."
"This beer is ultra drinkable, its sweetness hides any abv in aroma or flavor. Very delicious brew on a cold 30 degree morning."
"D - I had several and they were very smooth so I would say pretty darn drinkable."
"D - nice and slow on a cool fall evening. Perfect!"
"D: absurdly drinkable and overall enjoyable 8.2% beer. this from a guy who doesn't like lagers!"
"This is a solid beer but it starts to get a little sweet and syrupy for my liking after a while. Not in the top class of doppelbocks, but pretty good."
"D: I'm not the biggest fan of bocks, but this one was fairly good. I had no problem taking this one down, so I'd have to say it has high drinkability."
"Delicious beer, would love to have a case of this."
"Taste is quite malty and pretty sweet. Again kind of boozy but it's got a good taste to cover most of it up. Overall pretty good but not amazing."
"Poured a reddish brown with a one moderate head that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma was lightly malty. The taste was maple syrup sweet. The feel was barely medium bodied with little carbonation. Drinkability was good. Pretty good, but not that close to the best in class."
"Overall: First double bock that i've encountered and boy was it interesting, it was good to the last ""dopple""."
"Drinkability: It goes down quick and easily, by the looks of it you would not expect this. You don't even really notice the high abv till later on."
"I will buy this again for sure."
"Easy and fun to drink"
"This beer has an amazing brown town hue. The smell was not to my standards at all, at bit funky in my book. The taste is very unique and differnt upon other beers i have sampled. points for orignality. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth even though lotta alchol. Drinkable nonetheless and yours truly"
"The mouthfeel is light to medium and goes down extremely smooth with a medium-low level of carbonation. Extremely drinkable, especially for an 8.2% doppelbock."
"Pretty carbonated, but feels relatively light for a doppel, but the high ABV does show it's form."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm a HopHead, so this is a little out of the norm for me. That said, this is one good beer. Full of flavor and very smooth for being 8.2 percent alcohol."
"D - Lots of flavour and fairly drinkable. Obviously not for sessioning, but good for every now and then."
"D: Frankly, I love this beer. It is not overly complex, and the balanced blend of flavors culminate in a very enjoyable beer."
"Taster's Note: Many thanks to Deuane for this fine PA brew!"
"D - Moderate. High ETOH content keeps it from being a session beer."
"Fine brew!"
"M/D: Very full and extremely smooth body, yet remarkably drinkable hiding the 8.2% ABV very well."
"Pours a nice dark amber color with a one finger head to it. The smell is of deep and strong roasted malt with a slight hint of cherry to it. There is also caramel notes to it as well. The taste is big and flavorful, there is a lot of roasted malt with caramel. The malt is very big and bold, there is a hint of cherry and fruity hops to slightly balance out the total taste. The mouthfeel is moderate to light carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer, big malt taste that could put off some."
"D- Enjoyable beer that no one should have much trouble finishing. Most likely will enjoy another one of these."
"Pours a clear, dark coppery-red with a fairly thick but not persistent off-white head. Aroma is malty and subtly yeasty but not strong - inviting nonetheless. Flavor is better than the aroma suggested - strong, malty, mouth-filling with hints of hops and caramel. Texture is fairly smooth and just a little tingly, leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste."
"D- Suprinsingly excellent Doppelbock. Definitely prefered this to recent tastings in the style of Sam Adams, but maybe not quite as authentic compared to some Germans. That can be good because some German beers taste too clean for my tatstes."
"As far as craft beers are concerned this is a special effort. An easy step for new beer enthusiasts to take--This beer is not overwhelming and has little deficiencies. Perhaps not my kind of session beer, but an ideal beer to drink while cooking dinner or sharing with a friend. Prototypical Double Bock."
"Overall, this is a really good example of a German Doppelbock from an American brewery. It is not quite Celebrator, but very good an a worthy competitor."
"Drink: Great for a Doppelbock.... drink up!"
"D: A nice relaxing beer that is best enjoyed slowly, definitely one to be savored."
"This brew is drinkable, a brew to be careful with. A nice party starter, but a brew that will knock you out if your not careful."
"D: quite high for the abv. a slow-drinking beer, but great for slow marathons."
"Drinkability- Good."
"Finger level of mixed bubble sizes, thick foam slides effortlessly down the glass sides. The liquid is clear and transparent, has a deep redder tint to the brown base color, more orange around the outer rims. Thick malt influences in the nose, caramel, brown sugar, fried butter, chocolate, then comes candied cherry, apricot, banana and raisin fruit scents, mixes in pumpernickel and cinnamon stick notes, nothing pushy here. Medium-bodied, curious lack of heft and bottom, presents a mineral to streamwater aspect, the clove and cinnamon spice more obvious here, the apple, pear, peach to cherry and raisin fruit not very sweet. Fruit bread, pumpernickel, crust flakes, has a vague kind of sweet breadiness. The chocolate, caramel aspect is dry, echoes through the finish more than spreads widely. The carbonation about average. Trails off at the end, however, has the tact to do so cleanly."
"Really a perfect american style german doppelbock. It's a bit hop heavy compared to german styles, but overall very nice."
"This is one of my favorite beers. I love the maltyness of it. The abv can sneak up on you if you are not careful. The Troegenator I'm drinking right now is over a year old so it has picked up a bit of a boozy taste. I've gone through a few cases in the past. For a while it was one of my session beers. I wish I had the Troegs Drinking horn to use with one of these fine beers."
"Notes: This a great beer the robustness of it is so wonderful for a cool night. Even better for a cold winter night. Cheers"
"As I poured this beer into the glass I was a bit suprised by how dark amber the color was. The aroma was fairly light an malty as was the mouthfeel. The mouthfeel was especially light for and 8.2% avb beer in my opinion. You can taste the roasted malt from the first, but it gets stronger in the finish and aftertaste which yeilds a nice alcohol warmth."
"Troegenator is medium bodied and well carbonated- It's a very drinkable double bock and a solid one all together."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, moderate carbonation, not bad at all. This adds up to a pretty drinkable product, no Nugget Nectar, but not shabby at all."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice beer and may be the best I've had from Troeg's. It's nice, a little heavy, but very sweet so it's going great as my desert right now."
"Medium body, with lower carbonation. So smooth, and almost too drinkable for the size. Very well made."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a sipper and an enjoyable drink. However, I just really didn't fall in love with it and feel that one is really enough for the night."
"D: Though the ABV is not overwhelming, the mouthfeel is inhibiting my ability to drink too many of these."
"Troegenator is a special beer and an outstanding example of doppelbock."
"Drinkability: A good filling beer. Not an overly complex, but a beer strong in its simplicity. A good warmer winter beer, no doubt. I would wager it would also be good with meat and potatoes type food."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear crimson/brown color with about a finger of light ecru foam. Nose and flavor is of sweet and toasted grains, caramelized malts, chocolate, a touch of molasses, sweet fruitiness, a bit of alcohol, and another dose of sweet malts. About a notch better than medium in body with ample carbonation for it's style. High drinkability despite the ABV."
"Troegenator is a pretty impressive Doppelbock in all respects. There's more than an ample amount of flavor here and there aren't any big missteps along the way. It's not a huge standout in terms of flavor. But, it is a very well assembled beer and a good representation of the style. Troegs has made better and worse. But, this one's pretty damn far above average and is definitely worth checking out."
"Final Thoughts: I enjoyed this very much. I'm a mostly dark beer drinker and this is one of my new favorites. The pretty mellow taste is enjoyable and not over powered by the alcohol. Definitly worth a try."
"The ABV is on the high side, and this wouldn't be my first choice, but it's definitely drinkable."
"Pours a deep brownish red color with minimal head. I was expecting a bit more head and this being the last in my sixer I have learned that you need to pour vigorously to get much of one. Smells slightly of some burnt surgars and molasses. It's a smooth, crisp beer that hides the abv well. Tastes great with notes of molasses and dark sugars balanced with a bit of hop bitterness at the end to finish things out. I never would guess this as an 8.2% abv and could easily polish a couple off. This is a solid beer, especially for the price."
"Smooth and drinkable."
"I've never had a bad beer from this brewery. Keep it up."
"im not a huge fan of the bock style, but this one was much better than i expected it to be. i would recommend it if your looking for a nice american rendition of the style."
"Full body with medium carbonation creates a nice creamy texture, very drinkable for a dopp. Lacks the depth of the best German brewed examples but is one of the better American versions."
"This one hides it's abv well, so be warned."
"D - I must admit this is one of my favorite db's and it doesn't dissapoint on tap w/ an all around great drinkability for such a big beer. very spicy for the style, but suits me fine and went well with my chipotle chicken pita and sweet potato fries"
"D - For a high ABV brew, this goes down easy and gives no hint of it's 8.2% alcohol content! A very well balanced doppelbock. Not too malty sweet, but all the definitive flavor and then some! Will have to pick up a 6 pack of this in the future."
"This is fairly drinkable, but the high abv may get in the way."
"Final Thoughts: Compared to the tap, the bottled version holds up. Still the only Tröegs I have had. Well worth a try."
"i still respect bocks and DBs, but this just isn't my favorite style. still a highly recommended bottling and all should try this."
"medium body, starts smooth, but the otherwise moderate carbonation accentuates the phenols and gives a slight overly astringent character."
"D: It opens up well as it warms up. A relatively prototypical doppelbock."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams Boston Glass, the beer pours a dark red/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is average, lacing is good. It smells like caramel malt, toffee, and some dark fruit and chocolate. It's a nice aroma, however it is a bit weak. Luckily the taste is stronger than the aroma. I can taste caramel malt, dark fruit, bread/grain and a bit of chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has moderate carbonation and it's creamy, smooth and a bit slick. Drinkability is very good, it's pretty easy to drink. Other than the light aroma, I think this is a good overall brew. I'd buy it again."
"The taste is quite boozy. There are definite sweet malts, lots of caramelized malts, crystal malts, and some rum soaked fruit flavors. The beer is strong and the ABV is coming through pretty loud and clear. The beer is smooth and creamy, but it has a slight but noticeable throaty burn from the ABV. The nose eventually emerges on this beer and it really is floral. The sweeter raisin and fig tastes come out a bit as the beer settles, but the ABV is more than I bargained for. It's all okay, I'm not a big fan of the style, I will account for that in my ratings, but I'm still not overly impressed."
"Nice example of a doppelboch (or double bock) from an awesome brewery."
"All in all, a good doublebock, but I think I like Tommyknockers Butt-Head a little better. Give this a shot though!"
"Drinkability- Well the taste is alright but not exactly what I expected from a Doppelbock. As someone who used to drink the Optimator like it was job I thought it would be more like that. Also I think its a little sweet and I HATE that in beers. Either way glad to try but definitely not one of Troegs better brews. Thanks Adam!"
"One of the better offerings from Troegs especially if you're a big dopplebock/heavy beer fan!"
"Overall: this is one of the best Double Bocks that is made in the USA!"
" This beer is very drinkable, I got my friends to drink this and they liked it. All they every drink is miller light of crap like that. I think Yuengling should have sampled this bock before they made theres"
"Dark amber colored beer with slowly fading head.Aroma is dark fruit.Taste is butterscotch,caramel,bread and a tweek of alcohol.A very good solid choice.Smooth,creamy and tasty.I never had this before and was taking a chance buying a case,but in the end it's worth it.Recommended!!"
"Very easy to drink. Wouldn't mind more."
"D: Hardest Troegs beer I have had to finish. I would not pass it up if handed to me but I will not be ordering anytime soon. Onwards and upwards back to their hoppy stuff."
"I expected so much from this beer from the other Troegs beers I have had and the appearance when first poured. It went downhill after that. When I think of Doublebock, I think of a rich, malty, strong beer with a robust flavor. This is only malty and none of the rest. Overall, a ok beer."
"D: I wouldn't want more than half of this bottle - the alcohol wasn't overwhelming or anything, but this usual type of taste isn't the kind of thing I want to be sipping on all evening."
"M: medium bodied for the style. Mild carbonation level. Very smooth, almost creamy. Very well balanced palate."
"Second beer i've tried from this brewery and they continue to impress me. This might not be as good as the best german doppelbocks but it's not far behind!"
"D - Not my favorite beer or style, but certainly worth one or two."
"D: Not my favorite style but pretty damn tasty."
"Cheers Shawn!"
"Drinkability - not a bad beer over all I would drink this again."
"Thanks for picking this up sstacko!"
"This beer pours a clear beautiful ruby red, almost mahogany color when held up to the light. The head is and off white almost tan frothy color, about a finger thick. Head retentions is decent, nice lacing throughout. The nose is marked with notes of cherries, raspberries, caramelized malt, and a touch of breadiness. The taste is of almost caramelized cherries, hints of raspberry, touch of honey and malts, and a bit bready. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Goes down smooth, very sweet though with a sweet yet bitter aftertaste to it. This is a very drinkleable beer."
"Overall a very solid doppelbock. Not quite as complex perhaps as Celebrator, but very clean and smooth, especially for the high abv. I could drink many of these!"
"Another solid beer from a local (state-wise) brewery. I like the style, like the beer, like the brewery. Nothing bad to say."
"Brew poured to a nice deep amber color with red and copper highlights. Has a nice fluffy two finger head that has very good retention and left chunks of lacing. The aroma is of sweet and roasted malts, has caramel and a nuttiness within these properties as well. The flavor does not come across as sweat as one would expect based on the nose, more of a roasted taste. Has a chocolate flavor tat is a little more dry than sweet. Some fruit flavors are mixed in nicely. The end has a slight bitterness to it that at times seems to go well with this brew and on other sips seems to take a little (emphasize the little) bit away from this brew. As this brew warms the alcohol comes out a little more in the tail end of a sip. This is a nice sipping brew which I will milk for a while as I listen to the Phish concert from March 6th, something about listening to phish and drinking a nice brew ... nice ending to the day."
"I kept trying to pull out more flavors throughout the session, but despite my effort and concentration, this is just a beer that lacks character. Not bad by any means, but I was expecting much more. It's drinkable enough, just not very exciting."
"I'm probably a little bias because I really dig a nice Doppelbock in early Spring, but this brew truly delivered. Great interpretation of this style of beer. Mighty smooth and drinkable at 8.2% ABV."
"D - The drinkability is there because it's a Troegs beer...a nice representation of the style"
"Taste is similarly flat. Hoppy bitterness but little balance or fullfillment. As a newcomer to doublebocks it might be this particular beer or the style which I am not a fan of. Either way, too strong for my taste buds"
"Drinkability: I really like this dopplebock. It is on the sweeter side for the style but a very good version for the style. It hides the alcohol very well. I would have this again."
"A very solid beer by a very solid brewery. I would have to say this is possibly the most drinkable Doppelbock I have yet to try."
"A nice doppelbock not as heavy as others and easy to drink even during the warmer weather."
"Another Troegs winner, if not for the high abv, a sure session pleaser. Easy to drink with a well balanced palate."
"A very drinkable bock because I would describe it as well-balanced."
"Being somewhat true to the style, I probably should have rated it higher (I rate most things really high). But I don't want to buy this again."
"D- I usually drink my troegs right up but i took my time with this one. While i enjoyed it i was not so eager to finish it. The abv is not the problem, it's probably the aftertaste. All and all I enjoyed this."
"I've had plenty of brews that showed more alcohol at 5% than this does at 8.2%. Really a solid brew here, just doesn't have anything that jumps out at me to put it over the top."
"I could really drink a lot of this if given the chance. Good all around doppelbock in my opinion."
"Drinkability- I would, and did, drink another one after my wife drank half of the first one. I would, and did purchase another one as well. I'm not over the moon about this, but good dbock for the price."
"A solid bock, but for the money, Smuttonator is a better call."
"Overall: The mouth feel is medium and slightly carbonated. The finish is light and doesn't linger for long. This doppelbock is a bit thin and doesn't have the rich malty flavor as really good beer have. It is just an okay beer not great but okay."
"Taste is mucho sugary and thick. Not neccesarily in a bad way, it still tastes pretty good. A slight vegetal flavor creeps in in the middle, followed by a toasty and mild hop bitterness. Overall, one of the better American D-bocks out there. Looking forward to some more Troegs..."
"This is a pretty great beer overall, sweet and bitter meet up in a nice little package. A good beer for any time, and would probably please most all types of palates."
"Purchased a bomber at Bauer for $4.99. Poured into a Rapscallion snifter. Ruby amber color. Very thin head that was gone in no time. Wonderful smell. I got a distinct hint of cherry juice with the first sniff. Taste was pretty malty, but it didn't overpower me. While this is a decent double bock, it left a lot to be desired. My main problem was how thin it was: where's the body? While it had a really nice taste, and the over 8% abv was not really noticeable, this beer just didn't grab me. This is the first Troegs I've bought, so I'll expect a bit more next time."
"Pours a rich caramel with good initial head presence that last sin the lacing process. Smell is a deep malt with molasses notes. Taste is deep and rich in malt and molasses with a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth rich and deep. Drinkability is excellent, considering the abv. It is smooth and silky...unusual for an extreme brew."
"12 oz bottle. Orange/brown pour, with an off white head with descent retention. Malty toffee with some citrus and pine aromas. Tastes of caramel and toffee also. Solid medium body, enough carbonation to keep from being syrupy. Not too warming, the alcohol is nearly non-existant. Finishes with some malty sweetness, but fades cleanly. I think this could use some more fruits to fit with the style. A well made brew of a version that in my experience is either very good or poor with not much in the middle. This definetely falls into the good. My first from Troegs and will be seeking out more."
"Smelled super malty, a malt-bomb with a hint of sweentness in the smell. I expected just a thick gooy disaster that I would detest from this smell but the taste was actually pretty light and refreshing. It was malty sure, but it didn't offend my precious hop slanted palate one bit. I saw one guy refer to this as a ""gateway doppelbock"" and if that is true, then this beer achieved it's goal admirably. It has always been a style that just hasn't done much for me, but Troegs has caused me to take pause. Not my favorite beer, but I enjoyed it and would certainly seek it out again in the future when I want a break from Hop-laden nectar"
"Surprisingly balanced for such a malty style."
"Medium bodied, not as silky as it could be, med-low carbonation. Quite good."
"I just, generally, want more than this, from the style."
"D: For a doppelbock this is greatly drinkable. The sweetness is very mild. The heartiness of this beer is amazing. This doesn't have the sweetness that most doppelbocks have. Instead it is more like a meal with all the bread and fruit coming through. I am going to have no problem putting this bomber down and i can probably put down another if I had it. Overall, a good to great doppelbock that is well done and damned tasty."
"Thanks to the great trader jac5084 for this one. Pours deep, dark amber with significant tan head that has pleanty of retention. Smell is sweet, ripe apricot and fig with some alcohol hints. Taste is very sugary ripe fruit, caramel, and toffee. A lot of apricot in the taste. Smooth alcohol finish. Doesn't appear to be a very complex beer at all. Fairly one dimensional. I just don't think this is my style"
"Notes: paired very well with a packet of Williams-Sonoma dry Tuscan Bean soup mix that I beefed up with some chicken and served with a crusty roasted garlic bread (the kind with chunks of garlic in it)."
"22oz bomber from the Liquor Shop in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours a brilliant translucent red-brown with a half inch of light tan head. Caramel, nut, toffee, and a slight background of herbal hops characterize the aroma. Caramel and toffee hit first in the flavor, plenty of nut, slightly herbal hops in the background, and just a hint of alcohol warmth, though it does not taste like an 8.2% beer. Toward the fuller side of body with moderate carbonation. Not viscous like some dopplebocks, makes this one more refreshing and drinkable than expected. All around, one of the best dopplebocks I have ever had. Well-balanced, drinkable, pretty. No complaints here. Glad I can get this in Tyngsborro!"
"A solid offering. Troegs seems to not always just hit style guidelines with pin-point accuracy but also land right on the mark with regards to quality as well. These are the two areas where I've found the most consistency with this brewery. Oh, and if you count my tremendously enjoying their beers, that makes a third category they've excelled at as well."
"A decent beer, not the best I've had from Troegs(Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf are definitely better imo). Still there aren't a ton of good American doppelbocks out there so I'm glad to have a chance to have tried this one."
"Sweet, but not overbearingly so. It just has a medicinal quality I can't get past. Similar to Mad Elf with that one respect, except in the case of Mad Elf it endeared me to the beer. A little fruity, but the cherry notes just kind of slide into the background. Actually a little dry side to the finish that I wasn't anticipating. Mouthfeel is good, does well to keep things feeling fresh. Part of that medicinal quality comes back in a funky aftertaste at the end. Not bad per se, but I'm not warming up to it either. I tried not to let my expectations temper my review, but I think the fact that I was expecting something bigger leads me to a bit of disappointment. It's not a bad American representation for the style, it just could use some work. If it had less of a medicinal syrupiness and kick to it, that would help a great deal."
"D - No trace of alcohol; endlessly sippable. Delicious doppelbock. The only real drawback is the metallic twang in the nose. Otherwise, this is a fine beer."
"Still I liked Penn St. Nicholaus more."
"D- This is a good example of the style. It is nothing compared to Celebrator but it definitely holds its ground and is very drinkable. This beer drinks like a 5% rather than an imperial lager. Another great job done by Troegs."
"Doppelbocks are usually a little heavy inherently. Maybe this one doesn't have the sweet spice that those stellar traditional German examples offer up but it's solid as hell and even better on tap."
"dark copper with a ruby hue, the finger of head disspiated wuickly and left decent lacing on the glass. mild aroma, caramel, brown sugar, hints of vanilla. taste is sweet with a mild alcohol burn on the finish. a bit thin on the mouthfeel, with lingering sweetness. pretty easy to drink considering the abv. nice for a cold winter's night!"
"D: My first Double Bock, overall very nice brew... Pretty complex.... Very flavorful and enjoyable."
"Is this a true dobbelbock? It almost feels like more of a barleywine. Seems to be missing the classic Troegs hops flavor I find in most of their lineup - not a bad thing given the style."
"Pours a crystal clear dark ruby red, cranberry juice colour, thin off white head forms, quickly drops to a thin ring around the glass, some lace spots, good retention, head really holds. Smell is sweet, brown sugar, caramel, corn syrup, biscuits, toast, some honey, very rich and malty, quite fruity, quite sugary but really nice. Taste is similar, very sweet and malty, treacle and honey, toffee, toast, biscuits, brown sugar, light fruits and raisin, very clean finish, some iron, alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, very smooth and clean. A real nice doppelbock!"
"drinkability is great. great balance. nice depth. good stuff."
"Love this beer and need to find it on tap. Thankfuly its coming to Massachusetts this month!"
"D = Very smooth and drinkable. Can definitely see drinking this one over and over again."
"Notes: That's ""2 for 3"" for Troegs for me as their Mad Elf was one of my favorite Seasonals last year and their Hop Back Amber was a nice surprise. This one was not to my liking."
"Drinkability - This is a fairly rich beer and one I wouldn't want to drink many of in one evening."
"Notes- I don't mind creativity and originality in beer making; I think they are wonderful. But I do get frustrated seeing some American craft brewers claiming their beer is in a certain style, while producing something completely outside of that style. Troegenator does not fall into this category, it is a solid, sweet liquid bread, which does exactly what you would expect a dopplebock to do."
"D- A nice dopplebock, not my favorite style of beer but if you enjoy nice malts and yeasts this is worth trying."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied with very crisp carbonation. A touch over-carbonated for the style. Still rather easy drinking."
"It pours a dark amber color and gives off a slight sweet (vanilla) aroma. There is little head retention, but then this is a style where one is not needed. There is an upfront sweet malty taste followed by a small hop presence in the after taste. All in all this is a very solid beer and it is well balanced. The phenol notes are not noticeable which is great considering the high alcohol content."
"Wow, excellent. I'm from the Harrisburg, PA area, yet as a beer newbie, I haven't gotten to try this before. The only other Troegs beer I have tried in the past is Mad Elf last year. I'm only 23, and have never tried a dopplebock before. Anyway... Opened the beer from a six pack, hit with a nice soft scent from it, not what I was expecting. Poured into a standard glass a dark amber, when held up to the light, it reminded me of a port wine, and minimal lacing. One interesting note is that it left large bubbles in the bottle, something I've never seen before. Smell was of the malted barley up front, followed by a lingering scent of the hops and a bit of alcohol. Taste was just as the smell, sweet malt followed by slight bitter of hops and warmth of the alcohol down the back of the throat. It surprised me how easy it is to drink, everything is layered together, but in a great way. One does have to worry about the 8.2% alcohol level, it can sneak up on you. Excellent beer, wonderful for a nightcap or just a winter warmer."
"This beer was thick and toasty, like a traditional dopplebock, but the weight gets in the way. You can almost see the high alcohol content in the beer, and definitely taste it. The beer is very rich and flavorful, though the undisguised alcohol flavor interferes a little with the palette."
"Poured into a pint glass and poured a dark reddish color with an off white heading that settles quickly.Looking closley into the glass I noticed some type of isomer's if that is the right term for this.A very sweet smell of caramel and some fruits. Again a very sweet taste with a very nice aftertaste left no lacing. Not a can't miss but if you see it give it a shot."
"1/8 dark head on pour that fadded to nothing really quick. Dark purple opaque body, thin ring of lacing. Barely sweet aroma, not getting a lot, but the style doesn't isn't usually known for smells. Great sweet malty taste though. Just a hint of alcohol on the tongue, but otherwise a great crafted brew, balanced. Some grapes in the flavor too.Thanks to Jwale73 for the offering."
" Overall, I can say that I wish i would have tried this earlier."
"This just might be the best Dopplebock this side of the pond."
"I'm a total ignoramus when it comes to doppelbocks (thus my conservative scoring). I wanted to try Sixpoint's emasculator when it came around but missed that bus, so this is my first. It reminded me a great deal of Long Trail's triple bag. Anyway, if Troegs is anywhere close to the Germans on this, I'm looking forward to my next foray in this style."
"Even with some flaws in my book, this is still one of the best American doppelbock I have tried. Very drinkable, I finished the bomber with no problems at all and was left wanting for more. Good job Tröegs, you haven't disappointed me yet. my score's maybe low in a couple areas but I am comparing it to Imports of this style"
"A light mahogony color, with touches of amber. A ligth beige colored head forms on top about a quater inch high, but dissolves away quickly. The sweet scent of malt is very dominant, with another scent of dark bread at the end of each scent. The malt comes right out at the front along with a breadiness, that dominates the taste for almost the entire flavor. Then at the end a mild grassy bitterness comes through and lingers there for some time. There is hearty, chewiness in the feel, though still leaving that crisp finish you find in the lager. The dopplebock is a hard beer to brew and this is a great dopplebock. The great maltiness and heartiness that one expects from this style, are the strengths of this beer."
"D: Nice drinkability with very good flavor and enjoyment that wont disappoint."
"Subtle flavors become more pronounced as Troegenator warms. At first, a thinned-down caramel malt presence is all that can be detected, but soon a spicy rum and raisin sweetness wash over the palate. Finishes with a nutty hint and a boozy warmth. The mouthfeel is accentuated by a carbonation level that complements the spices well, and the medium-thick body achieves a near-creamy consistency. Overall, a solid offering from a brewery that has yet to let me down. I'd easily pick this up again."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"Comments: A very solid brew, very solid dopplebock. In my opinion the aroma is lacking compared to others of this style, but it's a very smooth and tasty beer."
"Pours a dark amber, lighter than usual for a Dopplebock, with a foamy fizzy head and lots of visible carbonation. Aroma is both floral and of charcoal, along with some cane sugar. Taste is a soda-like Dopplebock with a lot of fruityness and light raisin notes. Seems pretty thin for a dopplebock and overly ""processed"" for a beer. More like they mixed together Dopplebock syrup with water and carbonated it. Not altogether terrible, but this definitely doesn't remind me of the amazing brewing of German beers you'd find in Ayinger Celebrator or Spaten Optimator."
"another great treat from troegs. i am very glad to have tried it. i would gladly drink this again."
""
"I like most of what Troegs does and this is no exception. I would have liked to pick up a few of these when back East but unfortunately didn't. This is definitely worth a try."
"D - Very good Double bock, another great Troeg, and a wonderful beer"
"4.0 D: This is the dopplebock for the guys out there that like barleywines. That said, it has much better drinkability than most barleywines."
"The feel is basically chunky and chewy. Tart, bittersweet, cherry and barleywine/winter ale qualities. Decent, not great."
"A pleasant, ""lighter"" seeming doppelbock. Not really ""liquid bread," but not bad at all."
"The Troegenator is fantastically drinkable. This is a beer you could down all night before realizing that it packs an 8.2 % ABV."
"Not a lot of aroma coming from this beer. Dark mahogany color with a super thick, large brown head -- delicious. Excellent mouthfeel, super creamy, fabulous texture with almost no carbonation. Taste is a malty, toasted coffee with a prune undernote. Very good doppelbock, super enjoyable, but the rating is hurt by a lack of aroma on the pour."
"D-Is good. The alcohol is noticed and felt at the end of a 22 oz. bottle but not overtly so. I could go for another sometime."
"D: This is an inconsistent effort from Troegs. Some aspects of it were good, but others were not as well done."
"No date on the bottle I could find. Poured dark brown with a wispy head. No lacing on the tumbler to speak of. Initial flavor and aroma of sweet caramel. After it warmed slightly in a few minutes, a rich raisin flavor began dominating, with a slight tea bitterness at the finish. Maybe a note of brandy in there. Slight alcohol presence, which warmed me up as I drank. A good, rich mouthfeel. Enjoyable late night sipping brew."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a standard pint glass. The beer is caramel in color with a fluffy white head. The head has excelent staying power and nice lacing. Alcohol, dried fruit and nuts are pervasive on the nose. The main flavor is the dried fruit-perhaps dates and raisins. The alcohol is a pleasant mouth filler, adding to the dry finish. The beer is very full bodied, decent carbonation and way too drinkable for 8.5% abv. A very good beer."
"Drinkability: An excellent doppelbock, a style that's attempted far too infrequently by American breweries. Alcohol's fantastically hidden here, and though the appearance and intensity of the smell leave something to be desired, the taste is really good, and enhanced by the smooth, creamy mouth. Recommended."
"D: I love their stuff. Nothing is bad. We are (barely) getting this in NY and it is about time. They do have some commonality running through their beers but I do not think that is a bad thing so long as you like whatever that is."
"D. This one is dangerous. A six pack will be the end of you, guaranteed. But that is the allure of the Troegenator. Its sweet and very well crafted, and can lure you to drunkeness easily."
"D: I found its flavors particularly savory and light, which makes it quite an easy drinking doppelbock, despite its high ABV. A hallmark of Troegs beers seems to be ultimate drinkability, and Troegenator continues that tradition. A nice beer."
"definitely like this beer. a bit of a pleasant surprise."
"Pours dark brown with thin tan head. Smell - malts ans some caramel perhaps. Quite nice. Taste is great! Malts and caramel plus some fruity armas on the back. Very balanced and smooth. Goes down very well. I loved that beer. It's so simple and so complex at the same time. Alcohol is very well hidden. Great!"
"Great brownish color for a bock and served in a heavy mug at a Brooklyn bar(Dram). Enjoyed a few of these without any ill effects of the high alcohol content for a bock, hence why I rated it a 5 in drinkability. Smooth mouthfeel with no lingers. Would love to try this from a bottle at home as the environment was not that to enjoy a unique and hard to find brew."
"Drinkability: An excellent doppelbock, a style that's attempted far too infrequently by American breweries. Alcohol's fantastically hidden here, and though the appearance and intensity of the smell leave something to be desired, the taste is fantastic, and enhanced by the smooth, creamy mouth. Recommended."
"it pours dark with nice thick head. Very tasty, obviously very malty, but its got some hops to give it balance and its got a tiny sweetness to it, probably chocolate. Crisper than i thought it would be, i like the texture, average drinkability for a double bock, but overall a good specimen, very good"
"Overall: Crisp doppelbock, uncharacteristic for the style doesnt have the buttery smooth sweetness that is normally akin to the style, really crisp and abnormal. Still a good beer... just not what I had hoped for."
"D: It's sneakily drinkable considering the full body and big ABV. Very tasty and an interesting brew."
"Drinkability: for a 8.2%beer i could drink this with ease...very great beer"
"Pours a hazy orange brown color with a nice dark tan head that thins but stays around until the end. Smells of sweet malts and fruits. The taste is heaven, a nice malty nutty taste with a light wheat and dark fruit flavor in the background. It is one of the smoothest cleanest beers I've ever had. An amazing aftertaste that leaves you wanting more."
"Very nice tasting beer, and this was my first Doppelbock. A nice introduction to the style."
"Would work well on it's on or with food, I think."
"I feel privileged to live in a city that has a brewery that brews fine beers...Thank you Troegs."
"Pours a medium brown with a light tan head, sort of dark but not black liek a stout. Smells of grapes, fig, malty.. its nice since most doppelbock's just smell sweet and malty without a ton of distinction easy to detect. Tastes malty, lightly of fig, roasted barley (Standard double bock). Also detectable, though, is a bit of apple, which is nice. Its quite fruity in its sweetness (moreso than syrupy). Mouth is a light moderate, sweetness isn't overpowering. Very nice carbonation. Very drinkable, not too much gravity and finds a nice balance between sweetness and drinkability."
"Overall I'm a fan of this beer, but not a huge fan. I would certainly drink this again, but I won't go seeking it out."
"A very good beer. A strong beer, yes, but there is no harsh alcohol taste or smell."
"This beer is fantastic, I had a case deliverd for my wedding, it's one of my favorite beers."
"MF&D - Overall, very good. I do wish that the beer was a little thicker and more sticky. A little thinner and not as rich as I like my doppelbock, but very good nontheless."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy, but lacking carbonation."
"I'm still not entirely certain that I like Doublebocks, but I think I liked this one."
"D - Perfectly drinkable and I'm guessing it's better on tap. I'd drink it again but would not necessarily seek it out. Probably food friendly."
"Thans to seanpachefedda for the sample or however you spell his name"
"Hard pour from a 22 oz. bottle reveals a thick, robust sandy head with good retention. A clear, dark red color, smells of caramel, banana, chocolate, malt, dark fruit, and raisins. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with substantial carbonation, with a little slickness. Taste is burnt caramel, raisins, plum, banana sweetness, a slight coffee and chocolate undertone. I am not familiar with the bock style but this is decent. Drinkability is moderate due entirely to the high ABV, all other factors render it a high drinkability."
"On tap at Fatheads in Pittsburgh. Dark with a creamy head. Bitter chocolate taste with dark fruit in the background. A strong interesting beer that was very heavy and overwhelming. Not something to drink on a full stomach, as I was doing at the time. It didn't compare well to some of the German doppelbocks I have had in the past, but it is worth trying."
"Its not bad to drink all night, just gotta watch yourself, they'll kick your ass at 8.2 ABV"
"Pours brown in color with ruby highlights around the edges. Decent inch of frothy head atop the beer. Smell is slight toffee and a bit of a lager smell as well. Mouthfeel is pillowy soft and very nice. Taste is lacking a little complexity and strength. Needs more toffee/caramel and a supporting flavor. They nailed the mouthfeel though."
"I give the drinkability a low score considering the alcoholic aftertaste that taste like cough syryp. It lingers on far after you have finished this beer."
"Pours a brown color with ruby highlights, nice dense tan head that left some spotty lacing as it settled. The aroma is of toasted malt, caramel, honey, a bit of pepper/tobacco. The taste is a nice smooth slightly burnt caramel flavor with a bit of stale grassy hops to balance. The brew has a thick body with soft carbonation, very smooth, slightly sticky; nice and malty. A very nice dopple bock, sweet, thick and bready. I usually wait for my dopple bocks til November but didn't want to wait for this one."
"D - I like this beer if it was available to me i would regularly buy this beer good taste thats easy to drink its worth trying"
"Aromas of deep candy and raisin flavors, along with caramel malts, chocolate, and nutty sweetness dominate the nose. The flavors are the same except become sweeter with the addition of the mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is dry bitterness upfront, turns to almost sugary sweetness and finishes with an slight alcohol dryness. All in all a very flavorful, drinkable beer."
"D: I can barely drink it, but someone who appreciates massive fruit and alcohol might."
"all in all, a bit underwhelming for the style. i have come to know such greatness in this category..;."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a deep red glow. Smell is caramel malts and brown sugar. The taste is strong of brown sugar and malt with some fruits and spice. Mouthfeel is a little acidic, heavy but clean. This is a drinkable beer but very rich. I wouldn't recommend having more than a couple given its higher-than-average ABV and heaviness."
"Notes: Got this from Dyan - thanks dogg."
"A good, but not great dopplebock. Pleasant and easy to drink, just lacks a little complexity and depth that define my favorites in this style."
"Poured a nice bronze color with a tannish head that faded as I sipped. Nose was caramel, brown sugar, slight hops and malty. Taste was caramel, sugar, Munich malts and maye even choco or caramel malts too. Hops was not a typical US hop profile, very subtle. Tase also carried a nice amount of dried fruit like raisins and figs. Mouthfeel was alright."
"The Troegenator is one badass dude. Equipped with dungeon dark looks and deep full-bodied taste. A great mouthfeel that enables you to keep this brew in the palate for a while to embrace a syrupy brew with sweet plum-like aftertaste. Highly drinkable doublebock allows for a tripping billies type of night. No unsatisfying tastes to be found here! A brew that is not too overpowering in flavor or substance; it calls to be drank at any time of year, but with 8.2% alcohol, it doesn't call for anytime a day. Cheers, Let's go streaking!"
"T/M/D - this beer is surprisingly smooth, with that raisin and brown sugar taste mellow in the background. It doesn't linger on the tongue for long and masks the ABV pretty well. Very tasty!"
"Served in my Warsteiner pilsener glass. Poured a semi-translucent brown with ruby red highlights. Half-inch off-white head composed of tiny, tight bubbles reduced its volume to half its original size within seconds before settling into a thin slick of tiny effervescing bubbles; no lacing present during the tasting. Nose was bready sweet with a pleasant dark fruit character and hint of chocolate. Dark fruit and toffee flavors detectable in the mouth on a malt backbone with a mild booziness at the finish. Mouthfeel was between light- and medium-bodied (but closer to the lighter side) with a mild carbonation to add some character. Excellent drinkability in that it was not overly sweet. Troegenator went down quick and easy and left me wanting more."
" There are more complex, balanced doppelbock's out there, but this is a delicious malt bomb and a gem for the price and availability."
"D: Good for a newcomer to this style. This was much sweeter than the Sam version, and lighter for that matter as well. One that I would pull for in colder weather or for one long good drink with a book at night."
"Overall, a pretty good doppelbock."
"Thanks to Tbn2 for trading me this beer to try."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is a very flavorful and well made beer. But it's a bit much, and not all that easy to drink. I'm still glad I got to try this one, I just couldn't have more than one in a sitting."
"Someone send more."
"D- I enjoyed this one. Went down pretty easy and smooth. I would normally sip a doppelbock but this one was just good enough to disappear pretty quick."
"Overall: This would taste excellent on a cold winter's night. A little sweet for my taste, but I still enjoyed it."
"Cheers."
"D : If I could get it on a regualr basis, this would be a constant beer in my fridge."
"Bottoms up..."
"D: The late astringency coupled with the dryness makes it hard for me to want more than one."
"Troegenator has some really nice attributes but remains somewhat uncomplex. I would definitely not mind having another one sometime if I could get my hands on it easily."
"D= dangerous esp with the higher then usual alcohol content"
"Drinkability: Another impressive offering from the good folks at Troegs. I got a single to try for $1.69 and am glad I did. I'd have have a hard time though passing over Ayinger Celebrator for an extra buck or so a bottle when it comes time for a repurchase."
"Solid brew all around but it's a bit too sweet for me. There are many other doppels I'd choose first."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip pint glass. This beer poured a reddish amber brown. Fairly clear with a 1/4 inch white tan head. leaving behind rings of lacing after each sip. The smell was malty sweet with slight hint of alcohol. The taste started sweet with hints of raisin, roasted slightly bitter malt with slight hop spice on the tongue midway through and a mild alcohol finish. Nice medium bodied slightly oily mouthfeel with a smooth alcohol warmth. Another success by Troegs who refuses to make a bad beer."
"Another Troegs success. Although this double bock tastes like many other of its style, it is very tasty and drinkable. Poured this beer into a 16oz pint glass from Bubba Gump shrimp co.. The amber color is dark but not clear enough to see through. Tastewise the hops at some bitterness and a interesting complexity when combined with the caramel malt (not sure if actually used), or whatever malts were used I definately liked their contribuations. The high alcohol content adds a kick at the end of the taste experience. Thanks Troegs for another great beer."
"Not a bad beer and keep in mind this is not my favorite style of beer. It is a heavy beer that is probably best on a cold winter day in front of a fireplace. It has a good initial taste with a deep caramel flavor. However, the aftertaste is strong in alcohol taste and it is too obvious that you are drinking a strong beer. There are better beers out there."
"Fairly strong carbonation, medium heavy mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable."
"Poors a deep dark red/brown color with nice off-white head, average retention, and good lacing. Smells very sweet, lots of caramel, brown sugar, and molasses notes as well as figs and raisins, and the slightest bit of chocolate, hops, and alcohol. Tastes of sweet malt and chocolate and dark fruit beginnings with molasses and nuts in the middle with a earthy hop and alcohol finish. Medium/full bodied with nice carbonation, smooth and creamy with a crisp finish. Very sweet with a good strong alcohol presence. Not something I could drink a whole bunch of, but a very solid dopplebock that I'll enjoy when I'm in a dopple mood."
"Certainly not completely perfect, but this is a very good Doppelbock indeed!"
"D: 8.2% alcohol, limiting me to only having 1 or 2 at a time."
"Notes: When this beer warms it smell of alcohol deepens and also in flavor. I really compared this to the Sam Adams Dopplebock and while both were good,Sam Adams was great. The masking of the alcohol for the Troegenator was really the only flaw I noticed. Good beer.Good work Troegs."
"D: Based on the above a one hit wonder for the night (very filling), unless your skipping dinner, that said, an enjoyable beer overall. The 8.2% is barely noticeable."
"D/O - Another great offering from the Bros at Tröegs. I will definitely be drinking more of this in the future. Cheers!"
"A definite crowd pleaser even for those that prefer milder beers."
"Dark brown translucent body with a pencil-thin white head... handsome and appropriate--zero tracings on glass, however... soft and malty.... sweet but not obtrusive, surprising for a double bock... a subtle, almost laid-back bock: body is light to medium, and at thie alcohol content, an achievement... mellow and savory to the taste.... malt is sweet but not overbearing... works on the middle and back of the mouth, with little hop presence... this is a tricky review... Troegenator is not domineering the way the German forefathers command, and yet, does that make it a ""bad"" or ""weak"" bock? or a successful variation on the style? overall, this beer begs a second taste... that bespeaks complexity..."
"Thanks to Muenchenerkindl for this as part of my Troegs megapack."
"D - Nice brew, could enjoy one or two but not a true session beer..."
"This poured a hazy mahogany with tan head. It smelled like caramel malt with brown sugar and a bit of yeast. It tasted like a mix of semi-sweet earthy malts and caramel malts with some hay, but no real hops bitterness. It was watery with a bit of carbonation and slight alcohol warming in the aftertaste. Overall this had a definite lager character, but it was still decent."
"D- a good beer but not easy to put down. This is a beer you have one or two of the whole night. I couldnt see myself drinking a sixer of this in one day. great beer though!"
"Taste is dominated by malty toffee and caramel flavors, subtle fruit in the first few sips. A slightly dry, warming finish. Fuller bodied, very smooth. Hard to slow down and sip when it's so drinkable. Reminds me a little of Autumnal Fire from Capital in WI."
"D: This is one hell of a dopplebock. It was aged about a year and just came together great."
"Overall this is a very nice beer from Troegs. Malt enthusiasts will enjoy this one greatly."
"D_Another winner from Troegs. A lot of American Dopplebocks end up being too sweet and syrupy but this one is clearly not. Not on par with the Celebrator but a winner nonetheless."
"A bit weak on flavor and aroma. Not too bad, though."
"Pours a crisp clear brown with a thin head that diminishes to barely even a ring. Aroma is a nice blend of sweet malts and fruits. The taste is nice and malty,with a decent hop presence backing it up, there is also a presence of sweet malts. The beer is on the light side of medium with well hidden alcohol. This one is a very enjoyable American Doppelbock."
"Pours a clean amber color with a tan head. In the aroma, sweet caramel, malty, and a small alcohol hint. In the taste, sweet roasty maltiness and a small alcohol riding the whole way through. A small bite, medium bodied mouthfeel and a dry roasty malt and a small alcohol presence in the aftertaste. OK representation of style, yet alcohol is very present all the way through."
"One of my favorites from Troeges to date. Nice strong sweet aroma that melds well with the hop profile. More drinkable than some other Doublebocks i've had, hides the abv pretty well. Nice dark ambor color. A bit on the sweeter side for mouthfeel but very enjoyable, definately worth a try!~"
"Poured an attractive amber/brown color with small off-white head that disippated pretty quickly. Aroma is sweet and of toffee, brown sugar, and chocolate. Flavor is also of toffee, chocolate and molasses. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is high for a beer of this abv. I liked this very much."
"D: Mild carbonation makes this somewhat drinkable. You'll feel the alcohol quickly though so I can't say I'd drink more than a second glass in one sitting."
"i enjoy this beer alot. its a great double bock, more on the sweet bread caramel end of the style spectrum but extremely drinkable"
"The taste was a nice mixture of sweet malt and molasses. It had a nice amount of carbonation and the mouthfeel was thick. A slight hop bitterness came into play near the finish, but it proved to balance out nicely. I was left with a semi-sweet molasses flavor that lasted a long time. Very nice brew indeed."
"All in all , a good offering, something to consider from time to time, but wouldn't go too far out of my way for it."
"Mouthfeel is rich and crisp. Drinkability is good for a beer that strong. A nice beer, but not in the same league as the other dopplebocks I have had."
"Drinkability is middling. As a beer, not bad. But as a dopplebock it's a tad dissappointing. Was expecting a better look, heavier body, and a little more maltiness."
"Overall, quite a nice beer. Hard to enjoy more than one in a sitting, but you probably knew that already."
" Troegnator is a double bock, which is typically an amber German-style beer that is like a high octane Oktoberfest. Double bocks aren't usually flavor bombs, like a big porter or stout, but they are pleasantly balanced beers which make them amazingly easy to drink. This beer is rich and creamy with a strong caramel flavor but a light enough body to go down easy. The beer holds big amount of brown sugar and sweet raisin flavor with a solid floral German hop bite to counter the malt sweetness. Double bocks in general and Troegenator in particular are tricky. These are big beers, alcohol-wise, but it's hard to tell. Resist the urge to gulp and sip this one slowly. Troegenator is a year-round release and available at many better beer stores in Hampton Roads. Pick up a six-pack and watch the leaves fall as you taste a bona fide world class beer that we are lucky enough try."
"The alcohol is well hidden behind the up-front malty sweetness. Improves as it warms. Good American example of this style."
"I got a good batch of this stuff. Pours a nice head and good lacing down the glass. Has some burnt caramel flavor with chocolatey malts and medium-full creamy mouthfeel. Really a nice dopplebock. Very strong and hidden well. Smells of chocolate and caramel. Sure fills you up. Warming feeling with each sip. Red to an almost opaque black color on the top end. Not bitter very malty as true with the style."
"Troegenator didn't wow me, but I have to admit it's a pretty darn solid example of the style, (save for the appearance) and if it were available in my state I can see myself picking it up now and again. A good -- not great -- job by the Brothers Troeg."
"As I mentioned the initial mouthfeel is brighter and very crisp with good carbonation. As the brew sits on the tongue for a moment the texture begins to lean more toward a smooth velvety feel. Very appropriate for the style and flavor profile. A bit of warmth comes through in the finish. An overall medium bodied beer. A very nice selection with a character all its own."
"D: For a bigger style, it's an easy drink... and perhaps that's a little bit of a con, if expecting a full dopplebock. While a decent tasting brew, it could improve here a little."
"Pours a light brown/clear Ruby with little head. creamy smooth nutty smell. Taste is a bit heavy on the alcohol at this point with some caramel and dark fruit taste with creamy notes. Mouthfeel is good, but a bit thick, overall good. A bit viscous and alcoholic to be slamming, but ok drinkability. A good offering from troegs, should be better with a little time."
"Dreamweaver Wheat from Troegs was an absolutely great brew, and while their Doppelbock was good and above average, I wouldn't go so far to say that it was an ""above and beyond"" sample... Pours a ruby-red, mahogany-brew hue with minimal head... smell is full of caramel and malts... very malty flavor with caramel and butterscotch flavors bursting through... very rich and thick taste, although I've had much better representations of the style... very sweet and somewhat overpowering, which detracted from the overall taste and drinkability...extremely malty and thick flavor dominated by a brown-sugar base that is really powerful... copped this singly from Total Wine and More, and probably wouldn't buy this again, although I wanted to give it a shot... Although the appearance was good, this beer was average in all other respects... worth a try, but there are better depictions out there..."
"Pours a nice deep red hued brown with a tanner head that stays around for a short bit. Nose is Like wet wood with some sugar mixed in. Nice, full, and robust. Flavor is mildly sugar with a smooth wood tone. A thinner molasses seems to kick in on the back end. Good liquid body and a smooth and silky carbonation. Extremely drinkable, even with a higher ABV. Another damn good brew from Troegs."
"M - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation as noted earlier, nice and smooth"
"In all, if you are in the mood for a solid example of what American brewers can do with a traditional European Style, this is a good place to start."
"This is a quite amenable and pleasant brew, if definitely on the strong side (I've had higher ABV beers that hid their strength and seemed lower than this one's 8.2%)."
"Highly recommended"
"D - I enjoyed this one. Went down pretty easy and smooth. I would normally sip a doppelbock but this one was just good enough to disappear pretty quick."
"Roast malt aroma, although faint. Dark amber, crystal clear, with a light tan head that pours big and lasts. Flavor is malty and toasty, but rather mild. Good hop balance. Body is a little thin for style. Alcohol apparent, but not overpowering. Nice doppelbock."
"Poured deep red-mahogany with very thin head that rapidly dissipated. Light malt aroma. Very sweet, malty flavor. Seems a bit on the thin side. Easy to drink and masks the alcohol well, but lacks pizzaz. I was looking forward to trying this,a nd was a bit disappointed, I had to go back and check the bottle to confirm it was this year's bottling."
"Overall a very nice dopplebock. Tasty and complex."
"Taste is malty and very full. A good big malt backbone of munich malts gives most of the character to this beer. There are the caramel notes that add a light roasted and deeper taste and some nutty tastes. I expected from the smell to be more sweet, but the beer is not sticky. The yeast is clean, but has some light sulfuric notes. A great beer that can compete with the German examples."
"D - easy enough to drink, but I wouldn't drink more than a few."
"Drinkability: Actually, as an Octoberfest beer, I would sit back a guzzle quite a few. Unfortunate mislabeling. (3.5)"
"This beer seems to have a simple flavor profile that is well balanced and quite drinkable. A nice example of the style."
"Drinkability is where this beer gets complicated. On one hand it is very good, and there is not much that someone would be angry at; not super hoppy, not super boozy, not a whole lot of intense flavors going on, not a lot of carbonation. So that's a major plus and can certainly be a beer that a person who is a fan of Yuengling Lager (or in PA, Lager) could step into and like very much. On the other hand, it is a boozy beer, coming in at 8.2% alcohol by volume, which means that after a couple of these beers it may be quitting time. It's also, with its almost syrup-like body and long, thick coating mouthfeel, would be a beer that if it were warm would be a beer that would put a lot of people off, and one that a lot of people would pass on for a lighter, more refreshing beer. With ALL that said, however, it's a nice, classic, drinkable beer, one that after dinner would be very good(it has shades of a toned down quad) and for the price, assuming you live in the PA-area is tough to match, dollar for dollar."
"This beer poured a dull but clear orange-copper color that was quite bright. The beer had a nice head of medium sized bubbles that stuck around for quite awhile. Aroma was malty and cereal-y. Flavor was not overly sweet and cereal-y (what I don't like about bock beers!) but was lightly caramel-y and also had some sour notes and abundant maltiness. Mouthfeel was rich but not over-the-top thick. I really enjoyed it."
"I feel like this is a beer that is incredibly drinkable but doesn't blow me away or make me think about the style in a new way. Perhaps it was too built up, but if the point of a doppelbock is to be inoffensive and roll down your throat without making you go wow!, then this one does it up. In all, a great drinkable beer, but I was expecting to more malty fireworks."
"Overall: Very drinkable. It's downright pleasant, but hides a big kick. Resist the urge to drink it fast."
"Overall- 1 pint will suffice. Otherwise the sweetness and cloying become too much."
"Bottle at Firewaters in Atlantic City. This brew pours a dark brownish-amber color with a thin off-white head that dissipates fairly fast. Spotty lacing throughout. Roasted malt aroma with hints of alcohol and raisins. Medium, smooth body with sweet malt and caramel flavors, accompanied by notes of hops here and there. The finish is on the sweet side with caramel and malt, followed by touches of hops and a bit of burning alcohol. Above average Doppelbock for my money."
"Definitely a tasty beer, especially if you love malt. If you like any Bocks, Wee Heavys, or just anything malty, give this one a try. Recommended."
"D: This is highly sessionable for a heavier bock. It is definitely not a true doppelbock, but splits the difference nicely for a really enjoyable malty experience."
"Overall impression: Nice variety of malty flavors. A bit of alcohol burn lowers drinkability a bit, but still a solid offering."
"My only other thought on this one was the lack of fresh hop aroma that Troegs seems to use in so many of their beers. The lack of it disappointed me. I look forward to it."
"YUM!"
"This is a wonderful doppelbock. It has a great dark caramel coloring with a nice head. It poured out easily and left nice lacings, too. It's scent wasn't as strong as other doppels I've had, but still had a nice deep malty scent. It went down smooth and had a wonderful robust, dark, and deep flavor full of caramel hints and malty goodness. Would make an excellent digestif."
"This poured a clear dark brown color with a thin creamy head. The aroma is mostly of malt and caramel. The taste is also of caramel and malt. These are deep flavors with a slight hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is full, but not overbearing. This is a beer that you can loose yourself in  Ill definitely be on the lookout for this in the future."
"Pours a pure and clear ruby with a creamy head that dies eventually and laces. Smells of caramel and a mild bit of hops. Tastes creamy, vanilla, chocolate and a tid bit of hops at the end. Medium in the mouth with great carbonation. Drinkability is great. Could have a great sessionable day with these. Try it!"
"Pours a nutty, woody, dark copper with a beige head that doesn't hold up too strong. Leaves some soft, sticky lace. Few bubbles inch their way to the top through the thick body. Aroma is pretty faint for a beer like this. I get some alcohol, dried fruit, toasted bread, and sheepish hops. Flavor is much stronger than the smell. Lots of dried fruit and big malt sweetness. Hops are shy but offer an herbal edge, and, along with the slightly medicinal alcohol, gives this something of an herbal liquer character. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky with calm bubbles. This one tastes really good, but the intense sweetness and sticky mouthfeel tend to curb the consumption."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass it had a dark brown appearance and a seemingly thick quality about it. It had a heavy mouth feel and a filling taste. It had a strong aftertaste as well. I can see pairing it with a heavy meal suck as a steak or such.."
"Hella drinkable for the style. As some have said before I could see people drinking a few of these and then falling off of their chairs for not knowing how strong this stuff is, alcohol wise. This beer is a good way of satisfying a malt craving."
"I really enjoyed this tasty brew from Troegs, who is quickly rising to the top of my favorite brewer list."
"Yet another Troegs beer. Poured from a bottle with a cool looking label into a sniffer. Color was brownish amber, with no real head, just a white ring around the glass. Smell was very milky, with a bit of powdered chocolate in there as well. It also just had that sort of robust doppelbock smell that is difficult to explain. Taste had milk chocolate, caramel and toasted grains. It starts off sort of carbonated, then becomes very silky smooth. This might be a little light for this style, but the malt still makes this seem pretty big. This is my kind of doppelbock in that it is not too light and not too big, with lots of tasty flavors going on. I would get this again for sure if it were available in my area. Cheers"
"Drinkability- It isn't a bad beer. I wouldn't drink this on a regular basis."
"Pours a dark amber with a thin layer of head that leaves good lacing. This beer has a complex nose revealing floral hops as well as sweet bready malts and caramel. The 8.2% is well hidden, but the flavor lacks some of the depth found in its scent. Malty bready flavor that doesn't develop, but is nonetheless enjoyable. Lacks the sweeter flavor found in many other doppelbocks and focuses on a bread like taste. The mouthfeel is creamy, yet medium to light. It's a lighter take on doppelbocks, but still packs a wallop of alcohol that is well hidden. A very drinkable beer and an interesting take on a classic German style. Another solid offering from Troeg. Pairs well with a hearty German meal, but be careful you'll feel stuffed!"
"D: I really would prefer a different dopplebock over this one. I guess i'm just spoiled on celebrator. I guess I COULD drink a lot of these, but the question is why."
"Pours a deep, honeyed mahogany color with minimal head that fades to a ring. Smells are of dark, doughy bread crusts and sweeter, molasses-y smells. Some cloves and raw alcohol are in there as well. On the palate, this beer is rich and smooth with substantial bitterness, followed by some orange rind and slight alcohol burn. It reminds me quite a bit of Spaten Optimator, but with more of a bitter chocolate note. Mouthfeel is high gravity, with some raw alcohol and surprisingly robust carbonation, given the size of the head. Overall, this is a very decent doppelbock, with good drinkability and solid flavors. It doesn't compare to the best of the genre, but it's good enough for regular purchases."
" Overall this one just really underwhelmed me. It lacked the certain something that makes it stand out above the rest. I actually prefered a local Dopplebock, which has scored much lower then this, to be much more appetizing. Maybe it was me it just did not impress at all. I would say it sessionable only because it was so light and the alcohol really did not show through. Will have to try some of the other in the category, to see how it holds up, or maybe I just got a bad batch. Will try one again if it comes my way to make sure. One thing I will give it however was it was definatly not heavy and well suited for a warm summer night!"
"Hey, at least it was cheap."
"The beer is very drinkable, probably too drinkable considering its 8.2% alcohol kick. If there was a such thing as a session dopplebock, this is it."
"Nice appearance, copper colored and clear with thick chunky foam. The smell was sweet malts buch not the definitive smell I get from every Optimator, Salvator, etc. Taste was understated too, not bad but not great. I'll drink both beers no problem, but they're not the special treat I'd hoped they'd be."
"Scott"
"Recommended."
"Clear, darkish sienna brown with bourbon highlights. Thick, creamy, resilient, dirty khaki head. Nose of chocolate Twizzlers, licorice, caramelized brown sugar, root beer, dark fruits, and snappy noble hops. Sweet caramelized fruits, cola, and cookies up front. Becomes slightly tangy and vegetal with raisins and licorice. Spicy, vegetal hops in the finish along with vanilla and cookie dough. Lasting herbal bitterness. Not bad. A little bit hoppier than more traditional examples. Moderate body seems a little thin for the style. All in all, a nice interpretation of a doppelbock, but would benefit from a fuller mouthfeel."
"Drinkability - Another winner from one of PA's best, this brewery could definetly give the boys from Victory a great run for their money (not to mention Stoudt's and Weyerbacher). I really loved the cleaness of this deep, flavored lager and after this and a great Pilsner (Troegs Sunshine Pils), I'm definetly looking forward to seeking out more great Lagers. A must try."
"D: Good flavor, alcohol well hidden. Easier than some doppels."
"Pours a two finger foam, deep amber color, little lacing. Nose is all sweet malt and fruit, plums and prunes. Tasty, although not too compleext. Taste is similar to the nose, pure plums, brown sugar, just a hint of citrus fruit as well. Hides the fairly high ABV pretty well. Body is medium to a little thin for the style. Overall, a tasty beer; not necessarily the best of Troegs nor the best of the style, but good nonetheless."
"Overall a good beer. This is a style with which I'm not overly familiar, but this stacks up fairly well with the few other doppelbocks I've tried. This beer was quite tasty and enjoyable. In fact, I think I might feel a doppelbock kick coming on. Recommended."
"This double bock has a medium body and is very smooth. All in all a pretty mild example of the style. I could drink a couple of these before realizing it is a bit stronger than your average beer."
"The beer poured a clear amber body into my pint glass with a slight tan ring around the glass. The nose of the beer gave me a malty and sweet quality with some citrus notes as well. The taste is also malty, toasted and sweet making for a refreshing bock."
"Poured a modest light tan head that quickly subsided. No lace. Aroma was beery and malty. Color is a hazy dark amber brown. Taste is malty with a bit of caramel and honey. Body is a basic malty beer thined a bit with this strong alcohol which is completely hidden in the flavor. Pleasant finish that is sweet. Thanks to Paul B. for this sample."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden brown/amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy head, some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is of sweet malts, and caramel. The taste follows the nose. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Drinkable, a slight twist on a doppelbock, just about like many other's I've had from this brewery."
"Very nice dark slick brew. Thick dark fruit and malt aromas, sweet and resinous. Chewey- big malt sugar presence with a slight spiciness- very nice. Great balance with a slight cooling hop aftertaste to counteract the warming effect of the high alcohol content. Especially liked the thickness of this brew- a very tasty meal in a bottle."
"Received in a trade with markgugs."
"Very full mouthfeel left me wanting more, but at 8+ %, I knew this wasnt a beer to session...it was one to savor!"
"Overall-At 1st I didn't get this beer but I guess that is why we try six for BC selections. I have now tried five and like them quite a bit. It is a nice beer with mild less agressive food possibly some nice german sauasages (bratwurst, knock, etc.) or a grilled chicken dish. Also is nice if I am not looking for a hop monster (rare but happens). I believe that this beer meets the style quite well."
"My first Doppelbok, so bear with me I guess. Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. Very dark (almost black) body with an off-white head with average reterntion that was nice. Reduced to a nice lacing. Smelled very malty and alcoholic; hint of a little bitterness, but I am leaning more in the direction of very high malts. Tasted very, very malty and a little bitter/too sweet (could not really tell the difference, that is how malty it was) and yet it was pleasant (maybe it was the alcohol quickly kicking in). Nice, pretty thick mouthfeel; good overall. I would say this is drinkable. I would not attempt to drink more than one of these in a row, or at least in quick succession. Definitely a slower paced beer, which is nice to have when you are just hanging out watching tv or something. Very. very filling. Have not tried it yet, but maybe interchanging these with a lighter beer between each Doppelbock will a) probably lighten the ""full"" feeling and b) keep you sober longer so you can drink good, solid beer all day!"
"Drinkability: Ok, this is pretty good stuff but there are better and more available DBs for me."
"I was quite impressed and look forward to sampling the other Troegs offerings. Well played brothers Troeg."
"A: Yum. A decent beer at least, and quite roasty sweet. Strong, dark and wonderfully malty. A couple of these is realistic, as it's heavy. Leaves a slightly bitter and semi-dry aftertaste that's roasty. Kudos to Troegs."
"This is easy-to-drink for high abv - Nice taste. An all-round good doppelbock."
"I consider this beer OK as a sipper, it's flavorful and rich, but overly sweet and not enough hops. It's not my favorite style, but interesting still. It's just too high ABV and too sweet for me to want to drink more than one of these."
"D- This beer has good malt flavors but they are very smooth and a bit muted. The pot caramel flavor was not overpowering but just enhanced the malts. The hops balance was just enough to finish the beer with a nice lagered quality making this very drinkable."
"T - Malt and caramel flavors come through initially. Almost a soy sauce taste at the back of the mouth. Hops come through lightly in the finish. Stellar."
"Poured a nice amber color with a decent off-white head that stuck around and left bits of lacing. Smell is of biscuits, slightly floral, but very light aroma. Caramel, biscuit, a hint of dark fruit, as well as a slight metallic taste and a watery finish make up the taste. Full bodied, medium carbonation. Honestly becomes a bit cloying, nothing real special here, probably won't try it again."
"Drinkability: Even at 8.2%Abv this is drinkable stuff, no abbrasive qualities. Certainly one of the best doppelbocks I've had, and one that will always have significance in my craft beer life."
"Very drinkable, I think. It would not be hard to finish a few of these in a sitting regardless of the higher alcohol percentage. Yum!"
"Bottle (Courtesy of Adrian910ss): Poured a clear dark brown color beer with a small brown foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of sweet malt with some dry figs and plums is very enjoyable. Taste is very sweet with good caramel malt and some dry figs and plums. I thought this was closer to a BW then a doppelbock though; I could not detect any of the banana or cloves characteristics that I usually associate with the style. Body is about average with medium carbonation and alcohol is well hidden."
"It's a fairly heavy brew but easy enough to drink in the half-liter, all around a solid beer. Recommended, although I will stick with Celebrator when it's available on tap."
"Bottle bought at the Drafting Room in Springhouse, PA. Pours into my orval goblet crimson hued with hardly any head at all. Smells of cherries, candi syrup and fusel alcohol...alcohol being the most prominent odor. Taste is a dense and spicy malt + alcohol. Alc. is host and to some extent dominates the flavor. Some sour strawberry and pomegranete tastes. Somewhat thick and syrupy. A bit harsh overall, what with the alcohol being poorly hidden. Maybe it would be better if sat down a few months, but i'm not so sure."
"Very tea like in flavor, somewhat thin, with the same caramel, and sweet malt that showed in the nose. Watery also, floral, and less milk chocolate than the nose."
"the flavors are nice, but it lacks the depth and assertiveness that i've found in celebrator or korbinian"
"Drinkability is above average. I think this beer is better than advertised and deserves multple opportunities. Pushing the envelope for the style with ABV and carbonation."
"You know, it's OK - doesn't show its alcohol too much, not hard to drink, but not really something I'd go for if I'm out for a doppelbock. Not bad, but I think you can do better."
"Drinks very easy for the abv. Lack some style points on asthetics, but a really nice dopplebock, if I could get this all the time it would be in the rotation to be sure!"
"Drinkability: Not shy in revealing its alcohol content. Doesn't take too many to become plainly inhibited. Yet fine flavor with pleasant complimentary attributes."
"Thanks to fitzIPAtrick for this one."
"D: Enjoyable, but a bit too sweet for me unfortunately. High abv of 8+ goes unnoticed. Glad I got to try this but having more than one of these would be too many."
"Overall, good, but not great IMO for this style, but I tend to prefer the darker beers in this style. I would definitely drink it again and it is an enjoyable pour from a good brewery."
"D: This is one of my favorites. A nice dopplebock for (almost) any beer lover."
"Thanks to JohnnyM2002 for the trade."
"Clear coppery amber with a short, whitish cap composed of fine and coarse bubbles. The foam subsided quickly, but left behind some nice lacing as it settled to a ring. Very nice malt in the aroma, fresh grain, crackery, with just a hint of something richer - chocolate maybe? A bit of caramel as it warms too. The flavour's very similar, low bitterness with mild, malty sweetness. There's a bit of fruit towards the end that seems to accompany a mild alcohol warmth. Notes of floral hops and spice mingle in the finish. Solid body, well-integrated carbonation with just a little residual sugar. I quite enjoyed this beer. Not quite spot-on as far as the style goes, but very tasty."
"Poured into an Ename chalice, the is a deep brownish amber color, with a small, creamy brown head with small bubbles that dissipated fairly quickly, leaving little lace. The is a aroma of is sweet and rich, a mix of almond, maple syrup, raisins, nutmeg and alcohol. The taste was mainly malty and less complex then the aroma, with more emphisis on the alcohol, and the finish somewhat balanced by the bittering hops, but not enough for you to forget the +8% ABV. The mouthfeel is creamy and not as heavy as one might expect, but the best flavors in this beer do not remain in the aftertaste, which quickly fades to a bitter dryness. I'd guess the brassyness of this beer would mellow nicely with extended cellaring. Overall, it is a fine Double Bock but nothing extraordinary."
"poured out a dark amber brew with a fluffy 2 finger head. Has a low profile smell,malty but very subtle.taste of a sweet malt,mildly hopped,,and a twinge of alcohol.not bad,,just not something i would want a couple of.mouthfeel not bad, a decent brew"
"Very drinkable for a doublebock,can't believe I'm drinking one. So smooth,tasty,delicious,doesn't even seem filling. Could be a dangerous beer. A great doublebock,one of my favorites,will drink this one many more times."
"The beer pours a translucent amber brown with a thin off white head that doesnt hold or stick at all. The smell is some dark but mostly munich malts. The taste is a reflection of the smell with very little hops but tons of sweet maltiness. The mouthfeel is a little thin with nice carbonation. Overall not one of the upper tier dopplebocks but nothing really offensive about it."
"Very drinkable. As I said before, it's easy to drink. ABV is a little high to session, but if you are at home with some, enjoy!"
"Drinkability: A great beer for drinking on a cold autumn day. Thanks Muenchenerkindle. It's a nice brew."
"D: Tasty, easy-to-drink, very well-hidden ABV, but slightly filling, this is a beer that is worth staying with for an evening."
"D-This is my first Doppelbock,I liked it,I have 3 more left for the week that I will look forward to enjoying.I can see you enjoying this in the winter season.I dont really think its that boozy.I reccomend."
"Thanks, TheManiacalOne"
"D- Is alright. Nothing amazing and has a couple weird tones but at same time is pretty darn good. Think I prefer the Spaten Optimator."
"D: The flavors were nice, but the cloying stickiness made me lose a lot of steam moving through this one."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The beer has no off flavors or smells. This beer is a very pleasing and satisfying beer treat. Troegs delivers big time on a great beer drink."
"Seeing as how this just won a silver medal at the GABF and I have been meaning to try it for ages I figured it was time to pick some up. Nice, caramel brown color to it. Malty aroma with a slight mustiness to it. Bold malt flavor. Treacle like and somewhat nutty. Just a trace of bitterness to it. Suprisingly dry in the finish. Body could use a boost to be a bit more full. Very drinkable and enjoyable beer. Nice to see it is a year round offering."
"D - An excellent Doppelbock that goes down very easily and it suitable for a yearround selection (if you're into these tastes in the summer :-) It's one of my favorite Doppelbocks."
"12oz. bottle. Light copper in color, clear, modest light tan head. Aroma of grapefruit was first to make an appearance, but this faded as it warmed. Followed by caramel and molasses, cherries, bread, and a faint whiff of alcohol. Taste was sweet - dark fruits, cherries, almost vinous. Hops were quite mild, contributing a little bite at the end and some balance throughout. Body was medium, carbonation seemed fairly high for the ABV. Texture was slick, and the alcohol warming was noticeable very early on. A very good beer, which struck me as almost port like, but lighter in body and not as sweet. I also thought, given the other Troegs products I have tried, that the hops would be ""bigger", but they stayed pretty true to style."
"Overall I really liked this beer. It wasn't overly sweet, as some doppelbocks can be, yet still had a nice doppelbock flavor, making the beer very drinkable."
"Pours a light brown color with a small head. Lots of malt in the nose, with a hint of hops. Taste is very malty, much like a doppelbock should be. Very light amount of carbonation with helps the delicious malts seep through. Very good example of a doppelbock."
"This looked and smelled wonderful, but the taste and mouthfeel just weren't there. I felt so, anyway. It poured the caramel amber colour of 100's of other doppelbocks with a big fluffly sand coloured head. Lots of sticky lacing. It looked nice. The smell was quite lovely, as well. Plenty of sweet roasted malts, some brown sugar, heavy maple presence. I was quite excited at this point. Taste had sweet malts and a bit of a dry finish, but quite honestly, it was very dull and empty. Lifeless and unexciting. Ho-hum. Mouthfeel was very thing for the style, I thought. My overall opinion of the beer was very average and boring."
"The third beer in the lineup at a doppelbock tasting with the three BAs below, provided by expatsteve"
"Drinkability/Overall: sweet, nutty, spicy - not what you expect in a doppelbock, but interesting nonetheless. 8.2% booze is all but invisible, so kudos for that. Not a bad offering from Troegs, but it struggles to compete with some of the other doppels we drank that day."
"Drinkability: Good; solid with in the style and easy to put away. THe first time I had this it seemed very bitter with too much cocoa, while this time the diacetyl notes were a little distracting. Good for a regularly available beer, but a little thin and underdeveloped for the style."
"drinkability: fine for the style"
"Pours dark amber to brown in color with a very small amount of off white head that fades quickly. Aroma is a very nice big malty sweetness like cooking up a rich wort. There are also a nice aroma of dried fruits, prunes, raisins and strawberries. Taste follows with big rich sweet maltiness and prunes. Light to medium in body there is a little slickness on the palette with a slightly drying finish. This ber was like dessert, a nice malty treat, very enjoyable."
"Overall, a nice, strong db that hides its alcohol very well. I'll reach for another - I bought a case!"
"D - A solid dopplebock but it seemed a little light for the style. Very easy drinker for 8%+."
"again, another above average beer from troegs. not their best though. still ok. then again, i'm weaned on liberator."
"Mouthfeel is thin, letting this fairly high ABV beer go down easily. A real enjoyable doppelbock, one I'd have no problem returning to again."
"Fairly highly carbonated, a little sticky, but still nice. Fairly drinkable, but the lack of integration would begin to bother me."
"Another great brew sent by BeerBeing - he's the brew man!"
"Drinkability: The beer is very drinkable, a little too strong though (costing it a bit). A nice interpretation on the style."
"Poured into a flute glass a cherry maple color. Kind of looks like a lite coffee. Thin beige head that quickly recedes to a thin rim of lace. Smells of caramel and burnt toast. Taste wise this is a malt bomb and a very delicious one at that. Caramel up front, bready, with a very nice toast finish. Long lasting toast aftertaste. Thick and chewy in the mouth. Very drinkable for 8%. The alcohol is hardly noticable. I haven't had many dopplebocks, but if they taste like this I am going to explore them further."
"This beer poured a semi-cloudy burnt orange. There was little head. The smell is sweet and malty. The taste is somewhat sweet with a nice fruity aftertaste. The fruit taste is similar to pears. The mouthfeel is smooth. There is little indication of the higher abv. I could drink this beer again. One of the better beers of the style I have had."
"Glowing mahoganny colored beer sits all by itself, because I never got much of head out of this one. Malty sweet flavor with a mild nuttyness that picks up towards the finish. Smells a bit like caramel mixed with grapes. Fairly thick beer with just a touch of carbonation. I wasn't expecting a lot of carbonation, but a little would be nice in both the mouthfeel, and maybe put the rest towards a 1/4"" of head. Big malt beer that is pretty good, but after 6 beers over the last week it never really excited me."
"D - rich, tasty, highly drinkable brew with a firm alcohol presence. Sweet tasting, full flavored. Highly, highly recommended."
"The 8% plus alcohol is nowhere to be found in the flavor, but does warm you up and could be a dangerous one if you had a sixer of this."
"Prost! MK"
"Pretty good doppelbock, and the hints of hops make it just a bit special. Not for mass consumption, but for a glass or two of enjoyment every now and then."
"Overall, a very nice beer, and an above average doppelbock, imho. very tasty."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. Frankly, it's a fine brew, and one that I wouldn't mind drinking more regularly, but it just isnt near the level of some of the other fine doppelbocks out there."
"This one is definitely best savored a bit on the warm side. So much of its identity is obscured fresh from the fridge, so let this one warm up a little for sure."
"D - I never get tired of this one. Troegs has a gem in Troegenator. It is very easy to drink, perfect with so many foods and cheeses. This is one of the few beers I routinely come back to enjoy. In my opinion, this is the greatest doppelbock in the world."
"Have had this beer many times before but only in bottles and this time it was from a growler. What a difference! I loved it before but the tastes just jump out this time. The biggest difference that the freshness made was a strong nutty flavor present in the beer, which I absolutely loved. There was also more head and it was longer lasting. Other than those things it was pretty similar to a bottle but that was enough to impress me thoroughly."
"Drinkability: This is not the best doppelbock in the world, but I think would come through in a pinch if you're desperate for a decent doppelbock. It's too bad the beer wasn't as good as the label, but at least it had a name with the doppelbock -ator suffix at the end."
"D: The flavor of this beer wasn't too bad, but everything else about it kind of let me down. However, I am not a fan of dopplebocks, so don't take my word for it."
"Nuff said."
"Definitely not one of my favourite doppelbocks, but good to have in a local brewery (at least, it was local when I was working in NJ)."
"D - Decent drinkability. Thanks to Maltygoodness for this beer!"
"Definitely get malty and a hint of caramel with this, basically no hops. Finish is clean, but fades fast. Medium-rich body with the alcohol smoothly coming through in the body. Light sweetness but not much."
"I had a friend buy a case of this a little while ago, and he really picked out a good one. Gorgeous red amber coloring. Strong sweet malty beer. The alcohol really doesn't overpower the caramel, slightly fruity flavoring. Nice on a colder night. I will buy this beer again"
"Troegenator Double Bock (like Boston Beer Company, Troegs insists on using the Anglicized version of the name) isn't much of a doppelbock, but is a pretty fair maibock. Worth a look."
"Not a big huge example of the style, but a pleasing one."
"cheers..."
"Somewhat of a strong malt aroma. Light brown to copper in color. Very clear in appearance, with moderate carbonation and a slight head. Very easy going down, no bitterness or aftertaste. A very smooth overall mouthfeel. I consider this a good tasting beer with no harsh aftertaste. Will buy this again."
"Overall: I'd been living in the Philly area for two years when I finally got around to trying this one. It's exquisite, and I should have gotten to it sooner."
"Poured a rather translucent medium brown color with a soft white colored head that left behind just a touch of lacing. The color was not nearly as dark as I had expected given the style. It seemed more like an amber ale than a Doppelbock. Aromas of alcohol and grains dominated the scent. I really couldn't get much out of this and it was my first indication this beer wasn't what I had hoped it would be. The taste was understated, to say the least, with a very subdued malt presence. The beer was sweet overall, but it didn't taste as if different types of malt had been used, though I'm sure they did. Even as the beer warmed, I couldn't get much in the way of other flavors; fruits, earthy tones, etc. Every other flavor was so subtle, I could decipher what I was tasting in subsequent sips. The mouthfeel was just as average as the taste with not much intensity or texture. The beer felt rather thin in my mouth as if it had been watered down. Despite these apparent flaws, I love this style of beer and so I could see myself having more than 1 in a sitting, especially with the right cuisine."
"Makes me wish it was colder this winter...."
"D- I can put a couple of these down even with the abv. Very interesting beer"
"Tastes like bread crust with a bit of a bitter bite to finish, pretty good balance. It's not incredibly smooth, I can definately notice carbonation but it's enjoyable. I was not disappointed."
"like the oatmeal stout from troeg's.. this is solid. Very available here and I will certainly be sticking a 6er of this in the fridge. Just tasty all the way around. Very drinkable for the ABV and a nice in between option if you are in the mood."
"I have been drinking this beer for a while now, a very worthy beer. Better than its score, a ""good drinking beer"" Its taste is quite malty, but not overbearing, perfect for this style of beer. Pours a dark brown, little or no head but has a decent lacing. Very smooth and hasd a pleasant aftertaste. If you can get some, drink it!!"
"Nice fluffy head that sticks around, coats the glass and fades to a rocky texture. The color is a crystal clear reddish brown and the head is tan with golden highlights. The aroma is fairly clean, with a maltiness that is a little soft and almost fruity. The flavor is dominated by sweet maltiness, with some toasted character and a hint of toffee, and almost a licorice like note. The sweetness is stays just under the point where it gets to be too much. The hop character seems to show up only at the end as bitterness for balance. There is a slight alcoholic warming that is appropriate although its a little rough."
"None of these characteristics made Troegenator a bad beer, but it was much too far off the mark from the style they were aiming for. If you like it for what it is, then good for you, but dont look at this as a prototypical example of the style."
"The 8.2% abv is well-hidden in this gem and I'd love to try it with braised lamb. Thanks to my Secret Santa froggyfrog for providing the goods!"
"A ho-hum amber color, minimal head or head retention. Light color for style. Aroma is toffee like. Taste is strange, a slight corn flavor. Slighty twangy/sour. Alcohol, while present, isn't obtrusive. Not one of my favorites for this style. Mouthfeel is good, slightly thick."
"Well, I didn't have any flutes or pilseners available (they were dirty) so I popped a brew and poured it into a Burgundy glass (my favorite glass for viewing/reviewing a beer). Rusty red with a minimal head and a solid ring. Smell is roasted malt with a sugary, almost marmalade odor. Some zest but not overwhelmingly citrus. Hops are nearly non-existent. The tongue senses some astringency in the water mixed with some malty flavors. Mouthfeel is far too thin for this style. This is a tasty beer but lacks for the doppelbock style, yet it is very drinkable. Don't pass it up. Check it for yourself. Not bad at all."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers"
"Pours a nice reddish color with an off-white head that does not last long. Slight lacing around the glass. Smells of complex malts and possibly some noble hops. The taste is warming with a presence of alcohol that lasts in your stomach and throat. Very clean taste and yet a syrupy body in the presence. Hops are slightly present. This feels and tastes like a good dopplebock.The aftertaste is very malty and sits well on a cold winter night. Nice beer and I think it fits the category well."
"Poured a deep copper/amber color with a thin head. Lightly carbonated compared to other beers, but nothing to worry about; just a characteristic of this particular beer. Very sweet, malty smell with hints of caramel. Taste mimicked the smell. Was a bit thin on the mouth but very refreshing. For a fairly strong beer, would like this one in the summer."
"This is an easy drinking beer, though, and it tastes alright. Pretty malty, with a mild hop finish. I would like to try it again out of a bottle to see how it compares, and this beer has also made me want to try out some more of Tröegs' offerings."
"It's basic, if not truly remarkable, malty goodness. Nothing here shines overly brightly, but all shine enough to be notably enjoyed. It's sturdy and reliable, like a good, trusty pair of shoes, never wearing out its welcome and impressing enough not to be forgotten. The ABV has some backbone, but is not crippling, and rather it just warms nicely. This is one very pleasant, well-crafted interpretation of the style."
"Drinkability is decent. A nice regional doppelbock."
"Body is a bit thinnish, not as thick as I expected. Drinkability is really good though. Nice and refreshing and easy to put down. Dangerously drinkable"
"A sweet, warming beer that goes well with dessert. Not an incredible head but very well carbonated. A fruity, bread like aroma with hints of alcohol and a dark amber color. Smooth, malty taste that leaves your entire body warm while the carbonation tickles your tongue. A good choice for those cold fall or winter nights, and despite what the Troegs web site tells you, goes really well with a chocolate brownie."
"D- Easy sesison beer"
"This is a good doublebock; sweet, malty, with a good kick from alcohol. Poundable, but watch out!"
"thanks to weeare138 from the bottle. poured a dark amber with a with a off white head. not at all what I expected fr a doublebock. aroma, malts, a maple syrup and molasses, caramel, plums. flavor the malts take the lead on this one than got some sweetness , caramel, honey, and dark fruits"
"overall: i'm not convinced this is a doppelbock, but it's a good beer none the less. don't be scared of the ""troegenator""!"
"Poured a 1 inch light tan head in a pint glass that disappeared quickly. Deep copper color, very clear. Sweet malty molasses with a faint chocolate smell. Taste was all sweet malts, a bit too sweet for me. There is low carbonation and a glycerin type feel in the mouth, like a big red wine. It seemed to leave some alcohol in the mouth. Very drinkable, I didn't notice the high alcohol."
"-UF"
"poured a clear copper color with moderate tan head. Smell is of dark fruits (plums, cherries) with a touch of alcohol. The alcohol scent fades as the beer warms and becomes more enjoyable. Taste is truly impressive with great maltiness. The 8.2% is undetectable and and is a very drinkable beer."
"This is a good american version of a Doppelbock. Troegs has done a good job of packing some nice smooth chocolate malts in this beer. The smell is fairly week, as is the very small quickly disappearing head. All in all a good beer with a semi-sweet flavor. The abv doesn't show through and is hidden well with the malt flavor."
"Pours a slight off red in color with a slight but resilient head. Aroma is malts and slightly of lager yeast. Taste is very sweet with a slight hint of alcohol. Kind of a sourdough bread thing too. Also has strong toffee tones. Hops come through as unripe fruit--but just barely present. Mouthfeel is a bit chewy. Not sure if this is my thing or not."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts along with a dry lager yeast aroma. It's sweet with a toasted feel. The taste is good. It has a warm, malty flavor that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts as well as some raisin esters in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a solid doppelbock; another fine offering from Troeg's."
"D&N: Well done, Trogner Bros! Biased, to be sure, but the fact that this is from my home state gives it a big drinkability factor, it's local and it's awesome. Definitely worthy of recommendation."
"Light reddish colour, good suitable hops, creamy easy drink. Well malted including chocolate malt, carmel. Damn good for the style. Well carbonated. Bit of yeast, toast. Light spiciness and orange mid-sip. Light bitter finish. Unique, I like this brewery."
"Pours a brilliantly clear ruby red color when held up to the light, otherwise it is a full amber color. The head is frothy, about a finger thick and is a tan color. The aroma is rich with notes of cherries, carmalized malt, toasted bread, and fresh cooked biscuits. The cherry note is quite interesting, and though not strong adds a sort of fruity back drop to the aroma. Nice... this beer is thick and creamy from the beginning, as I take my first sip it just coats my mouth. There is a nice sweet full maltiness here that is characteristic of a doppelbock. The flavors that I can pick up remind me of caramel coated biscuits, honey, vanilla (though I think this is more a product of the creamy mouthfeel), and a hint of fruit notes; cherry and orange perhaps. There is a light bitterness in the finish that just barely tries to balance the rich maltiness that dominates this brew. This is a very good Doppelbock, and I am quite enjoying it."
"Draught: This one poured a clear, dark reddish/coppery color. Mine had almost no head to speak of. There was some sweet caramel malt to the nose. The aroma also contained some spicy floral notes. This one has a nice, sweet caramel malt taste, with some hints of fruits. A hint of bitterness and some spicyness in the aftertaste. Very Nice!"
"Drinkability - goes down very easy, one of the easiest drinking doppelbocks I've had."
"Drinkability and Overall: It's been some time since I last had this beer. Since then, I've had many more Doppelbocks, including many good true German onces, and this beer is still killer. Quite a good representation of the style, without having that normal American bock flavor."
"Pours a deep amber, almost red with a thin white head that dissapates quickly, with moderate carbonation. The aroma is dominated by malt with hints of raspberry, caramel, vanilla and oak. The taste is quite malty just like the smell and you get just the faintest hint of hopping in the background. The malt flavor is not overwhelming and is quite well rounded with a tart fruit flavor (raspberries or perhaps strawberries or even cherries) and a smooth vanilla flavor as well as a molasses sweetness that follows. The finish is slightly dry and bitter but that makes it all the more refreshing. I haven't had many dopplebocks but i enjoyed this one. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation, and it hides the alcohol fairly well. Not an ""excellent"" beer but pretty damn good, and it seems like it could be sessionable despite the high alcohol."
"Pours a clear reddish brown/rusty color with an off white head that settles down into a minimal covering. Fairly active carbination. Aroma is of carmel & a little vanilla. Flavor is a bready maltiness, with more hints of caramel and vanilla. Little to no hops present in the flavor, this is NOT a brew for you hopheads out there. Sweetness is cut by a hint of alcohol, but its well hidden for a beer listed at 8.2% abv. Medium body & texture. Has a fairly clean, slightly bitter finish. Overall, one of my favorite beers, it turned me into a Doppel lover!!"
"Aroma was hidden to me. I couldn't pick up a whole lot with this one. Taste was a malt bomb with hints of candy brown sugar, chocolate and caramel. Not overly sweet at all which leads me to believe there is some balancing hop there but I am not picking it up in the flavor. The alcohol is well hidden. Its slightly chewy and fairly medium bodied. Smooth and easy to drink for sure. I would buy this one again."
"Very Drinkable, Well hidden ABV makes it easy to have 2-3, Will definitly buy again"
"Another beauty to behold - warm cherry amber hue with a clinging, cream colored 1/2"" head of loose foam. Nose rang of light yeast, but hinted at the richness to come. Boy, is this nice and rich, full of mellow malts that finished like it started - rich, very smooth, almost creamy, and full of rich malts. A very enjoyable and highly drinkable brew, but be careful of that high ABV...could sneak up on you as you enjoy this."
"There I go with all 3's again. Basically, I didn't think the beer was bad or anything, but it didn't have enough other characteristics to knock my sock off. Appearance, clear amber, no real head to speak of (and I poured it myself). Aroma is a bit light actually, mostly low malty notes. Tastewise, the initial sweetness seems a bit one note. I think it does a good job hiding the alcohol. After that initial sweetness, the finish seems a bit thin and undone. Also seems a bit flat, unfortunately."
"Nice amber appearence. I was expecting a very hoppy beer from this brewery. Nope. Nice balance of malt and hops. It is very strong at 8.2 ABV but you don't notice it until you stand up. No strong alcohol burn like some other strong beers. This is a nice replica of a german Dopple Bock. After drinkin it, I was reaching for another. However, make sure you are at home and not driving if you reach for another. The carbonation is real light and not much lace clinging to my glass. I think it could use a little more mouthfeel for a beer that has that much malt. Overall, it was definantly worth $26.50 for a case. Great value for your money."
"Thanks to merlin48 for the bottle of this one. Pours a ruby color with a moderate head that falls fast and doesn't leave too much lacing on the glass. The color seems wrong on this one. Aroma is full of malty goodness with some nuttiness. Nice. The flavor was much better than I expected. Very nice. Smooth and almost creamy. Lots of malty caramel goodness and a slight chocolate and roasted character. This one surprised me and I liked it a lot."
"Thanks merlin48! This beer pours a clean, ambered red color with a small coating of head over the liquid. The nose is caramel and nutty roasted in nature. I like it. The flavor is nice, with a prevalent caramel sweetness laying heavily over a roasted nuttyness. Very nice. I like the balance in the flavors. The feel is thick, with minimal carbonation. I find this beer to be very easy drinking. The flavors are really nice together. Good show."
"Drinkability: Filling and sweet, like a doppelbock should be. A decent beer that I wouldnt mind having again."
"The head is dense and cream-colored. It dies filmy. Very nice color to the beer: a clear, red-brown. Spots of all sizes lace the glass. Aroma is quite peanutty. Nutty, fruity, bubblegummy up front. The middle is a thick, caramel malt; sweet; nice butter. Finish is nutty, fresh, bitter, grassy, corny. A very nice, tasty, full, rich, fruity, nutty, bubblegummy beer. Quite buttery and milky. Delicious: what I'm looking for when I pop a doppel."
"A balanced, smooth brew that hits me as well on style. Finishes with a tad of warming alcohol. Easy to sit back with a few of these."
"Reviewed in Jan, 2005. Hard poured to obtain almost no head...just a tiny ring around the glass. Looks like a gorgeous bock, dark rust orange in color, but is mildly cloudy. Smells of caramel, chocolate, and I get a hint of orange. Whoa, the taste is sweet malty and smooth. Caramel, bready, vienna (or munich) malt, and a bit of baker's chocolate (which I certainly wasn't expecting). Has a piercing fine carbonation that adds a hint of sour/acid immediately after the swallow. Any hop bitterness is gentle, but I do get a bit of zing late that could come from hops. Tough to tell, as the zing could be the result of alcohol and carbonation combined. This beer contains some bock character mixed in with many other non-traditional bock characteristics. Medium thick body with moderate carbonation (but the carbonation forms piercing bubbles on my tongue)."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer is a clear amber with not much head retention. The aroma is nutty, fruity, and a little sour. The flavor is dominated by the malt. There is little hopiness. A bit of fruity tartness. The high alcohol content is noticable. Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't really call this a doppelbock. Actually, I'm not sure what style I would put this in."
"On-tap at the drafting room in Exton. Maybe next time I won't be having a big fight with my significant other when I'm sampling this one ;-) Either way a very nice Double Bock. Dark ruby with brown edges and a nice enough head of whipped coffee foam. Aromas are all about sweet roasted malts, chocolate malts, caramel malts, and MALTS. The taste follows suit, and as I find most Doppels, it is quite one dimensional, but still damn tasty and good. Where is the 8.2%? Mouthfeel is creamy and thick. Warming, chewy, and filling. Drinkability is great for a bigger abv lager. Damn good stuff. I hope to try it again next Winter!"
"I stashed this bottle for several months to see what would happen. 12 oz. with no freshness date. Served at about 50 degrees. Pours a reddish brown (more red than brown) with an off-white 1 finger head that leaves little lacing. Scents are very sweet - caramel, butterscotch, chocolate, bubblegum, raisins/plums/figs, alcohol and perhaps a hint of roses. Hop spiciness is the first flavor to hit, but followed closely by thick, chewy malts with more bubblegum, chocolate, dark fruits, and alcohol. Citric hop flavors and hop bitterness eventually make themselves known. Has a nice warming feeling. Too thick and strong to make a good session beer but makes a wonderful after-dinner beer. I don't remember the other 5 beers from the six-pack smelling/tasting this complex - even though I don't have tasting notes from those I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the aging had a positive effect on this beer."
"Try with some marinara and cheese stuffed pasta of your choice. Unsuspecting folk may even approach the glass as if it were red wine because in the right light, it looks as so. Such folk are in for a bit of a suprise."
"Hard to believe this is 8 percent ABV. Nice."
"Pouring the Troegenator into my glass, it appeared an amber/chestnut color that was clear and clean looking with a nice 1"" head that eventually dissipated leaving a nice edge layer around my glass. Upon smelling it, I got the scent of plums and berries throughout it's body. It also smelled very clean and malty. Taking the first sip, i got a bitter and smooth taste with less carbonation than expected. The carbonation that WAS there tickled the front of my tongue a bit and then the fruit dark malts came through in the flavor. It finished with a smooth almond flavor or roasted malts. Mouthfeel was pretty decent in that the carbonation was a little tickly at first w/ a SLIGHT alcohol burn at the swollow. However, much time spent in my mouth was smooth and pretty light in body - lighter than expected. Another nicely done product by the Troegners!"
"I filled a growler of this at the brewery. The beer pours into my pint glass a clear chestnut color with beige spongy head. Aroma is generally sweet with fruit, (white grapes, plums and berries), some toffee and a lite floral hop presence. Overall appealing but mild. Flavor is sweet up front as well with caramel and toffee giving way to a bit of earthy hops in the middle and then a roasted malt and nutty almond finish. THe body is pretty thick and texture is smooth and very easy to drink. The finish is fruity and chocolate and lingers on my palate for a while after swallowing. Nice complexity for a clean lager. Lots of malt and only a faint hop presence. QUite a tasty brew in my book!"
"This was not what I was expecting. I have not tried too many of this style but I really expected something a little darker in color and stronger in flavor. This poured a copper color brew with a thin white head. The smell was very malty and sweet. The taste is malty and sweet with not much else going on. Slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste along with lingering alcohol. Smooth mouthfeel but not very rich. Good drinkability. This beer is good tasting but not what I was expecting at all. I wouldn't turn it down, but I wouldn't search it out either."
"Dark honey colored with an off-white head that rises up to a half-inch and lingers long. Aroma of sweet malts, lots of caramel, some light brown sugar. Flavor is very rich, full of sweet malt, some pear and honey, finishes with some cinnamon and a faint hop flourish, plus a warming tingle of alcohol in the back of the throat. Very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"Nice beer, but could be a lot better."
"I am still glad to have tried it, much thanks to Shapudding for the beer!"
"Overall-very good interpretation of the style, the alcohol doesn't overpower it and it's surprisingly drinkable. Retains the high quality of Troegs in its own fashion and while I prefer some of Troeg's other offerings (only because this isn't my most favorite style) I can still recommend drinking it. Beware the Troegenator."
"Pours with a two-finger head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep, clear amber color. Low carbonation. Nose is malty. Medium bodied. Starts with semi-sweet raisins, finishes mellow, the high ABV is not noticable. $1.55 for a 12oz bottle from Vintage Cellar Blacksburg, Va."
"This beer poured a dark copper color and was a little cloudy with bubbles rising from the bottom. Thin foamy head produced a nice lining about the glass. The aromas I detected were of cherry, spice, and maybe just a hint of chocolate. The taste was interesting. At first I encountered a strange nutty, perhaps chestnut, flavor in the beginning. Upon subsequent sips I found fruit, and a bit of spice and bitterness creeping in at the end. The mouthfeel was good, but nothing too exciting. My verdict: not a bad beer. I'd only drink it if there were no better alternative."
"Drinkability is very good, obviously not someting you are going to make a session out of due to the high ABV, but definitly something I would keep on hand if it were available in my area. Highly recommended."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" light tan head over the clear coppery brew. Head is frothy, yet somewhat short-lived, but does lace more than most of the style. Aroma is lightly of sweet maltiness, but wish it was more intense. Taste is sweetly malty, as the nose, with deep grain flavors prevalent. A touch of alcohol becomes apparent at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. Quite drinkable for the style, and worth the search."
"The taste is very good, again with a hint of fruit, tangy and somewhat spicy. There is a hint of hops in the aftertaste, which lingers nicely at the top of the mouth. The label says 8.2% alchohol, yet there was no alcoholic taste and did not seem that strong after finishing one bottle."
"Troegenator Double Bock: A malt afficionados dream come true. Pours a murky brown, with a slight head, off brown, leaving a slight skim on top, with a grayish pallor. Aroma is heavily malts, with decided scents of caramel and dried fruits. The taste is very nice, warm rich taste, very malty, with a bit of a coffee flavor on the backend. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and creamy, terrific. I can see having more than one. Thanks BIF for the sample."
"Drinkability: Although it is not a match to its best German counterparts, this is nevertheless a very drinkable brew; in fact you can drink this more readily than a German as it is less of a sipping beer"
"Worth another try."
"I am admittedly, a dopplebock fan. And this one is, although different, a very fine example. As mentioned in several other reviews, this beer does not have the overly viscous mouthfeel nor the sticky sweet finish that other DB's have, but it more than makes up for it with the malt hammer of flavor! Fruit and crystal malts predominate, and the carbonation is just a tad more than I would have expected. All in all, a great session beer (if you don't mind the 8% + ABV) and one that you should seek out if you're in PA. or wherever it is distributed."
"A nice doppelbock, but unlike any I've tried from Germany. The light body promotes excellent drinkability, but the alcohol will easily sneak up on you if you exceed moderation."
"ng"
"12 ounce bottle, with no freshness dating. Poured a nice dark coppery color, tiny bubble carbonation, wispy lacing, a fine looking product. Nose of ripe fruit. Flavor notes of pleanty of sweet malt, a hint of bubblegum, nice smooth light chocolate finish. Yummy and warming with alcohol present. This style usually is strong and tasty and this version did not disappoint."
"Drinkability  This was good, but it sure as hell is no German Doppelbock."
"Served out of a logo pint glass, beer poured a hazy deep amber with a frothy, cream-colored head. Very sweet smelling beer. Hint of mollassas in the aroma. Taste is domminated by sweetness and malt. Almost a syrupy candy-like flavor to this brew. I almost would go so far as to say that no hops were injured during the brewing of this beer. The brew does hide it's 8%+ abv very well. Pleasing mouthfeel, and a pretty drinkable brew, especiall with the fairly high ABV."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy deep ruby red color with two fingers of off-white head. There is a little bit of lacing. The smell is very malty with caramel coming through, and a hint of nuttiness. Only a bit of alcohol present. The taste is also very malty, lots of sweet caramel and alcohol present under roasted malts. A touch of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, yet smooth. The drinkability is pretty good too for a double bock of such strength. A nice solid brew."
"Pours a clear, ruby-tinged brown in color with a thin layer of tan head rimming the edges. Aromas are sweet, with some raisins also noted. Flavor is quite tasty. There is a dark fruit flavor present, mixed with a toffee-caramel malt character. Finishes with a funky cardboard aftertaste that knocks 0.5 off the flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied. Decent carbonation. Quite difficult to tell that this weighs in at 8.2%. Another tasty beer from the Troeg brothers!"
"Drinkability: Not immensely drinkable. It's not bad to sip or to sample, but I don't think I'll revisit this one. I had 2 tonight because the first may have been too cold, and I feel like the second was a bit forced. I'm glad to have tried this, and I love Troegs in general, but I believe the rest of the six pack will depart in a slow manner."
"A certain sweet nutty character pervades the mouth upon first sip to be followed by a very bitter hoppy finish. Not the double bock characteristics I was expecting, though not a bad beer."
"This one pours a brownish red color with a thick foamy tan head. This one smells a bit fruity with notes of chocolate and caramel. The nose on this one is not strong at all. Malty sweetness is what comes up front in the taste followed by a slightly bitter finish. This is a medium bodied beer that goes down smooth. The 8.2 percent was not noticeable which defiantly helped the drinkability. An above average Doppelbock that is good but not my favorite of the style."
"for it's chewy/sweet nature, this is HIGHLY drinkaleit's noticbly smooth nature. Good drink ay time of the year"
"Notes: Good beer. Not an outstanding example of the style, but it gets the point across and is flavorful. The thin mouthfeel was the downfall of my experience with this beer."
"Orange-amber clear body, thin off-white head. Aroma of cedar wood smokiness, wet soil, sand, peat malt. No alcohol is noticeable to me, but were there some, itd feel pretty whiskey-ish. Palate is lightly tart, very earthy with more smoke and peat malt stuff going on, but not much flavor developments. Sand undertones, mild bitterness. A rather quaffable example without much complexity and a airy medium body."
"This bier pours a nice clear dark red amber color, not much head or lacing. There is a nice malt, and slight caramel nose. Taste initially is sort of a sweet maltiness but finishes a lingering slightly bitter coffee taste. But there are hints of dark fruits that seem to disintegrate on your tongue, slight astringent alcohol tate/smelll This is defiantly a very drinkable brew."
"It's an ok beer."
"A great beer! poured a rusty-brownish red hazy body with a thin light brown head. Malty and fruity smell. Tastes great with notes of biscuity malt, fruit and warming alcohol. Very flavorful and complex but very drinkable. Another fine example of Pennsylvania brewing excellence."
"Would compare favorably to Sprechers Doppel which I also find very tasty..better than Schells and Leinies....not as good as the heavy hitters (Optimator, Salvator, SA, Tucher)..still very enjoyable...I like Troegs and Troegenator is another fine beer of theirs..."
"Thanks ZAPONATOR."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a clear dark amber, with a smallish head that didn't stick around long. Aroma is nice and malty with a hint of caramel and fruit. taste is more of the malt, with a hop twang that isn't usually present in a double bock. Mildly carbonated, slightly thin mouthfeel that has a nice quick sweetness followed by the hop twang. Even with the higher alcohol this is an easy drinking beer."
"Thanks to beerluvr for the sample"
"This is not the classic dopplebock, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it is an excellent beer. It pours a clear mahogany with an off-white head that dissipates rather quickly but leaves a nice ring of lacing most of the way down the glass. The aromas are strongly double bock-like with a strong maltiness overlying a caramel base with lots of fruitiness, mostly raisins and figs. The taste is strong, caramel, and malty until the fruitness of raisins and prunes kicks in. The final touch is a bitterness of hops that is unusual in a double bock. For me, hops is never a bad thing so this didn't bother me, instead it enhanced the flavor. It is thick and sweetish in the mouth and a little ascerbic as well. This is a drinkable beer from first sip to last and always makes me want another one."
"The beer seems like more of an imperial export-style lager than a doppelbock. The hopping is way overboard, I think, reducing the huge malty sweetness that the style is famous for. A bit disappointing, considering how good their other beers are. It's not a bad beer by any means, I just don't think the hops work with the malt. It seems to clash, both on flavor and with what's customary for the style"
"Not what I was expecting from a double bock. Poured an redish brown with head that fars quickly to small ring of bubbles. Smells of alcohol, bread and light fruits.Tastes light crisp yeast mixed with fruit flavors along with a alcohol finish. Medium bodied brew not like any double bock I have had before not bad but pass me a Salvator next time."
"troegs keeps reelin' me in further with each brew i sample of theirs, and i can make that statement even after sampling their troegenator, which, while still a good, enjoyable brew, has probably been my least favourite of their offerings thusfar. it pours a nice amber colour and is quite clear, with a 1/2 inch light tan head that hangs on for a while but leaves a decent stickiness behind. the smell is of malt, earth and a slight sweet cherry. the brew itself is medium bodied and starts off with a bold malt flavour, moves into a sweet cherry middle and has a nice warm alcohol finish. this one is not as hearty or complex as other doppels i've sampled. at times, it didn't even seem like i was drinking a doppel, but it was still good in it's own right."
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a very slight dry aftertaste. The malt flavors last on the tongue for a while after swallowing. This is a little lighter in body than other doppelbocks, which adds points to the drinkability scale. Very tasty brew."
"Poured a very dark orange with a small tan head that dissipated very quickly leaving little to no lacing. The smell was malt and alcohol with some hints of grain and caramel. The taste was very sweet, and malty/caramel. The malt was defiantly the dominant flavor, very little hop taste and some alcohol in the background. Also some fruity notes were evident, raisons perhaps? Mouthfeel was good. This was a very full bodied filling beer, although I see that others felt it was thin for a doublebock. Reminded me of a barley wine in it's sweetness and consistency. Drinkability was good as well, I would have another if I happened to have more than one. I would defiantly try this doublebock again."
"Dark amber color. Medium head. Aroma is roasted malts, caramel and dark fruits. A medium bodied dopplebock. Malts are rich, fruity and sweet. Touch of toffee, bread and molasses. Very smooth tasting. Hides the 8.2% alcohol very well. Perhaps a little thin? A nice dopplebock. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"I'm a big supporter of local brews and I'm real happy to have Troegs Brewery in nearby Harrisburg. I really enjoy this beer."
"This is one of my fav's when it comes to US brewed dopplebacks. It was a very nice dark color, almost motor oil, with a tan head. The head retention was very nice and lasted quite a little time. It then fell to a thick laceing. The taste was nice and fruity, more of the plum variety, plus had many different malts included. It resembled the belgian brews quite well. I would recommend this one for anyone that is looking for a solid US brew."
"I said that dopplebock was my least favorite style, and I dislike most of the malt monsters, but this is so well-balanced, that I genuinely can enjoy this one. A great beer from a great PA brewery, and one I'll be looking for again."
"Light amber color and head that quickly dissappears. Aroma is fruity alcohol and not much more. The fruit that comes to mind in the aroma is peach. Behind that fruit is a hint of malt. Flavor is sweet and then quickly leads to dry finish. The beer is very crisp. The alcohol is subdued which is surprising due to the amount of alcohol that is sensed in the aroma. It is a fairly drinkable beer despite an 8.2% ABV touted on the label."
"Overall: Just a great beer. Enjoy it in moderation. Respect it, ot it will plow you. One of the best offerings by Troeg's."
"Drinkability: Very high on my scale. This is a warming, sweet, rich brew."
"Appears a deep ruby with a caramel tan head very nice appearance lacing is sporatic and scattered but it's all good. Aromatics takeover deep over ripened plum tones drizzled in a milk chocolate sauce and a touch of floral hops lingering. Taste conists of waves of malt this is one malt monster very nice and it gets more and more appetising with every sip. Seems chalk full of caramel malts with some type of specialty thrown in to give it the chocolate finish very smooth and not overly sweet a great strong lager that's still a bit dangerous when it come to drinkability. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied but incredibly smooth at the same time no cloying textures one great easy sipper. This beer is great year round especially when your in the mood for a malty dbock with trace hops."
"It is very rich and smooth till the last drop. Loads of dark malts welcome you into a well-made doppelbock. I think the fact that this beer was very heavy and I had it in 90 + sun at work may have hurt my experience a bit, but imagining what it would be like under more flattering conditions, I bet it would be great. Some coffee and chocolate flavor in the mix, it had a good deal of complexity. I will return to this one in the winter."
"If the hops could be changed and the malts enhanced (slightly roasted?), this beer would be much better off."
"Thanks Jarod!"
"Overall: A bit of an excursion from what I expect from a Doublebock, but not bad, the lack of inherent life and a head took the edge off of a solid offering that could have notched to this to a Plus-4 beer. Thanks to Nero for this one!"
"Pours a deep copper/amber color with a light but sticky head,the a aroma is bready and malty not much sweetness in the nose.The tasteTaste is very bready and not really sweet for the style some lingering caramel notes but not much,the ending is rather dry and hoppy for a doppell.Not bad but not sweet enough for me."
"A rather respectable dopple with malt being cables that keeps this bridge afloat. Smelled of chocolaty sweet malts no noticeable hops in the nose but that goes along with the style. Beer was having a problem being poured and would foam over almost every time that is was poured so had just a slight carbonation with it finally settled so the initial pour had a huge head but when I was finally served it just had a little head on it. Taste is of sweet chocolaty malt no real alcohol flare and mouthful is thick and nourishing. Tastes to good to be this strong."
"The alcohol taste is not strong for as high as it is, great flavor and very drinkable."
"Poured out a nice orange amber color with a big creamy head. Complex aroma of caramel fruits and malt. Not overwhelming though. There's some grassy hops in there, too. The taste is very nice - rich with complex flavors and malty sweet. Very drinkable and the beer has hidden the alcohol well. A very nice and flavorful Dopplebock."
"Overall impression - Another solid brew from Troegs. A bit one dimensional perhaps, but extremely well crafted, well balanced and drinkable, and for me, drinkability in many Dopplebocks is sometimes lacking."
"Finishes up clean and sweet, the alcohol making a lasting impression...liquid bread indeed! I think I'll indulge in another ""slice"" or two :o)"
"($6.99 / 6-pack)"
"Pour a dark red with a tan head. The head gives away quickly to very little lace. The aroma was malt and hint of sweet caramel. There is a very slight hint of hops mixed in. The taste is sweet caramel & malt up front followed up by a wave of alcohol. There is no bitter after taste with this beer. Maybe a bit weak on the malt taste when you match it with other beer of this kind. With the 8.2% alcohol, it is very easy to drink. Overall a bit above average."
"I was a little disappointed with this beer, it wasnt my idea of a true dopplebock. It pours a nice dark copper color with a small white head that fades away quickly. The aroma isnt as sweet as most dopplebocks that Ive had. Caramel, hops, and roasted malts are the most apparent scents. The taste is much like the aroma with a slight caramely sweetness detected upon the first taste, with mild chocolate undertones. There is, however, a dominating taste of alcohol noted during the entire drinking experience. The body is very thin and bitter. This is a decent beer from Tröegs but not the best that Ive had from them."
"I've enjoyed troegs brews in the past so when I saw this one I snatched it up in a hurry...unfortunately, it disappoints for those expecting a ""dopplebock"". Dark reddish amber with a smallish head and very little carbonation. It has decent malty scent but the taste is slightly sweet, fairly hoppy and watery for the style. It seems american breweries just can't compare when it comes to this style. On the plus side it's very easy to drink and the alcohol is nicely masked, but I find myself noticing grainy & hoppy american pale ale characteristics while drinking. Decent brew, but way off the mark for the style."
"Fairly light compared to other double bocks Ive had. By light I mean in color, texture, and flavor. Color is light brown with orangish notes. Head is off white and quickly fades. Flavor is predominately sweet malts but not as strong as offerings such as Paulaner's and SA's. Theres some mellow, and let me emphasize 'mellow' hop flavor in there. Alcohol is not noticeable. In fact I was surprised when I saw it was 8.2% when I looked it up to write a review...A good double bock if not somewhat out of the ordinary."
"Not the Moravian malt, triple-decocted, melanoidin-infused, deep-lagered doppel I've come to love.......but still a pretty righteous brew."
"A crystal-clear reddish-amber body lies beneath a creamy light tan head that both holds well and leaves nice lace throughout the glass. Some alcohol is noteable in the aroma, but it adds rather than detracts; mingling with a gently toasty maltiness and light floral hoppiness. It's medium/full body is enhanced by a very fine, median carbonation that gives it a touch of crispness on the tongue before releasing its gasses and becoming creamy-smooth. The flavor is quite bold with a rich, bready and toasty malt. It doesn't have the lightly chocolatey character that some doppelbocks have, but it does contain a mild fruitiness. Floral and spicy hops balance with both flavor and a gently restrained bitterness. Again, the alcohol is present but not overwhelming, and helps to dry the finish and leaves a touch of spiciness at the back of the mouth. An interesting take on the style with more fruitiness and floral hop flavor coming through than many darker & malt-laden versions exhibit. In fact, it's very much like and ""XL"" helles bock! Quite enjoyable; and probably too drinkable considering its strength! Well worth trying!"
"This is an interesting offering in the world of American Double beers. It pours a facinating shade of reddish pinkish brown. The malt is pronounced, but not overpowering, and the finish is quite sweet. The alcohol is well hidden, which is interesting, considering it weighs in at 8.2%. All in all, a good lighter-style Double for the warmer summer months, though nothing outstanding. Reminds me oddly enough of a Spanish or French Rose wine."
"Pours a medium copper color topped with a thin tan head. The head slowly fades to just a ring of foam. Strong caramel aromas are blended with hints of roasted malt and hops. The hops are noticeable immediately on the tongue, but then a myriad of flavors fall in behind it. On the first sip I get roasted malts, caramel, a bit of alcohol, touches of lemon and a bit of a black licorice note. A bit of a toasted butter note finishes out the first taste. The second sip is sweeter, with touches of dark molasses with a slight dark chocolate component. This is an impressively complex beer. The ABV is noticeable, but some time in the bottle may help diminish the alcohol esters. The mouthfeel is smooth, but not heavy as many dopples tend to be. This is a big beer that could be enjoyed easily on a warm spring day. It has decent hopping rates, a clean mouthfeel, and a great finish. An excellent beer from Troegs, a brewery I am gradually becoming more familiar with that continues to impress."
"This beer is hefty. The malts are strong and filling. The nose is malty and the hops don't really shine through. The beer is all about malt. The head is quite thin and fades to almost nothing. The beer is quite red with some brown as well. The alcohol is quite present as you move to the middle of the brew. This beer is a meal in itself and is quite a treat to close out the winter season. Cheers."
"NOTE FROM OCTOBER, 2003. Later Troegenators have had nice, thick and full heads with good lacing. Either I had a bad batch or perhaps an old one? In any event, I am updating my review and changing some numbers accordingly."
"Appearance is a dark brown, barely able to see through. Slight head that fades quickly and settles to a 1/4 inch collar. Smells are that of all malt, dark, roasted. Big malt taste with a nice balance of hops in the end. Slightly short mouthfeel, a little dry, with a tart, short finish of hops I can't put my finger on. Very drinkable as the alcohol is not easily detected. Nice beer from Troegs."
"First I’d like to say that every-time I drink this beer it gets better and better and new and exciting flavors seem to emerge. So I might have to re-review it from time to time. Now, this beer poured into the glass a crystal clear, lightly carbonated red/orange color. The head was thick and creamy, and the color was a beige color that had a orange hue to it. It was a long lasting head that never really disappeared and some remnants were still there at the last sip, and the lace was much like the head, it was sticky and it stretched to almost the bottom. The aroma was fairly simple at this time, the first thing that hit me in the face was oranges, fresh oranges, then a slight wave of floral and citrus hops bit at my nose, some creamy chocolate malt seemed to also be present (I noticed it before, but it is very slight), but mostly I smelled oranges. The taste was more complex then I would have thought. I tasted fruit (oranges) some light citrus hops (which made it slightly bitter), a light creamy milk chocolate, malt in the middle, kind of made my mouth feel watery, and hints of alcohol were also present in the late middle and at the end. The last taste to come to me at the end were citrus hops, but it was well blended. This beer was creamy in texture and very satisfying, a good beer to always have somewhere either on tap or six pack. Also a very sneaky beer. You feel fine and great while sitting and having 2 or 3 but watch out when you get up, because you will have the “jimmy legs”."
