"Nice head to start, but quickly dissipates. Dark, Sweet, reminiscent of a fine Belgian abbey ale, but this is german all the way. Big flavors of raisins, caramel, and black strap molasses.  As a doppelbock, it's got the appearance of a porter but the mouthfeel of a much lighter beer. The sweetness creates a slight syrupy quality."

"Tasty and user friendly Bock beer this is worth a taste."

"Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this one. It has a bit of a roasted flavor in the finish and it ended kind of dry. Good flavors, just bad mouthfeel/finish."

"Overall after hearing this one costs around 10? dollars a bottle so for two dollars its ok. Not really the best just not terrible."

"O: Much more bitter than I'm used to for the style. Instead of caramel and sweet dark fruit this doppelbock tastes of lemons and molasses."
"@ $20 a bottle in Canada have your friend buy one and then go Rock, Paper Scissors for the cool dog tag.."

"This beer made for a stellar drinking experience. True, it tastes a lot like a dopplebock. However, the caramelization of the wort on the hot stones during the steinbeer process does add a lot of depth and intensity to the malt flavor. If you're a fan of malt bombs, you have got to try this beer (or some other traditional steinbier). Be advised though that this beer won't relinquish all of its secrets if you just absent-mindedly sip it while watching television. You've got to concentrate and tune in all your senses. Do that, and this beer will reward you."

"Overall: A really nice example of the style, even after over two years in the bottle; not as sweet and fruity as some but very easy to drink"
"Review from 6/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Poured a deep red amber with a trace of off-white head that left no lacing. Sweet malt aroma. Flavor is sweet caramel malts with dark fruit, quite pleasant start. Finishes somewhat abruptly with a dry, slightly astringently bitter finish. Medium bodied, low carbonation. A bit uneven, but enjoyable dopplebock."
""
"A good dopple, but I believe this isn't in top condition, still very drinkable"
""
"A decent doppelbock, not too big, not too small, and if I may say, quite close to just right. However, the warmth becomes a bit too forward, at times, but overall, that seems forgivable, as the complete flavour trumps (uber) all(es)."
"Pretty much a textbook ""Ye Olde-School"" Doppelbock."
"Pours a slightly murky dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty with some dark fruit and brown sugar aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, dark fruit, and some mineral-like flavors on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the mineral-like flavors are a bit off putting."

"Flavorful, but simple. Easy drinker."
"The body is medium, maybe a bit light for a doppel, and while a crisp note opens it out and it's fairly smooth, it goes a little flat."
"Poured a half inch creamy tan head which held solid at first but ended up rapidly deflating. The body is a dark raw umber brown, almost coffee. It smells very nicely of deep malt, kind of like fresh rye bread, too. The taste also is malty but a little less than the smell, and I pretty much only get malt out of it. The body is quite light, more so than I'd have expected from such a dark beer."
"Not the best one I have had, and i can firmly say now that this beer is best enjoyed as fresh as possible."

"I would have expected a dopplebock to age reasonably well and not be terrible in a year or so. But, this is likely going to be a drainpour."
"1365"
"Overall I Don't really know why but this bottle grabbed my attention and I had a good feeling about it. Needless to say I was pretty let down. Being produced in '09 I feel that this beer is just past it's prime. I'd definitely like to try it fresh, but I do not recommend drinking this beer with substantial age."
"I don't find this very drinkable but it's certainly an interesting catalog of flavors not often encountered. Tastes like an elderly English winter ale of some sort."
"Poured a dark brown body which left 2-finger head and lace. A strong, sturdy malt base smell as I pick up bread/cracker - a dryness, and also some sweetness and a touch of hoppy fruitiness. Strong, medium-bodied, a clear smoothness makes it easy to drink and there's a balance in the beer as it finishes crisp thanks to carbonation. A good malt base as I pick up that touch of dryness, but mostly a syrupy figgishness as well as some caramel and dark chocolate. Also some fruit flavors akin to dark fruit and/or black cherry. A quality dopplebock that isn't as heavy and the mildness makes it an easy to drink brew."
"Draught @ Cambridge House; This one pours a cloudy. ruby tinged lighter brown color. There was a small tan head that leaves a little lacing. Lots of caramel malts and earthy notes to the nose. Some dark fruits down there also. Plums? Raisins? The taste is very good. It is very well balanced. Just dry, with a faint sweetness in the finish. Maybe some smokiness also. Lots of caramel malts in this one. Hints of the dark fruits. Very nice!"
"D: This is one of the better Doppelbocks I've tried recently. Drinkable."
"Overall, this is a fairly solid doppelbock, which appears quite impressive but is slightly above average for the style. At $5 for a bottle, I'll probably forgo further adventures with this beer."
"Super rich malt bomb upfront. Toasted malt, and an awesome yeast give the palate a great swirl of depp roasted cereal and bread grains. Flavors of plums and prunes, with a little black cherry abound. A little alcoholic warmth and a soft, yet syrupy palate finish it off. The finish does have a slight, too earthy flavor. It takes away from the depth of malt flavors."
"Would I buy more of it? - It was worth trying once but I doubt I'll buy another bottle as there is too much else out there that I still need to try!"
"Notes - I passed over this one for a long while at my favorite spot and am completely regretfull I did. I really like this beer alot and suggest it to anyone."
"Granitbock, in my humble opinion, is the single best beer these guys brew. Granted, I've only had three offerings from them so far. If you're a big fan of Deutsch Doppels, then $4.99 isn't too much to spend on 500 ml of medium-dark, mostly malty, bittersweet enjoyment."
"D- all things considered, this could a beer fanatics session beer. not too high in ABV and certainly easy to put away if you have the palate for maltier beers."
"D: My first steinbier and it was pretty interesting. I actually liked it quite a bit. Don't know if I would drink a ton of it in a sitting, but I finished my glass."
"Reviewed on 1/9/2010. Bottle. Pours brown with a small ring of white head. Aroma of overcooked vegetables, raisins. Flavor is much of the same with sweet malt, raisin, prune, some crackery notes, and overcooked vegetables. An interesting concept but to me, didn't improve the beer (although that would've been a freaky beer pre-granite)."
"On tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt. An authentic German steinbier, I've been looking forward to this. Dark copper in color, cloudy, opaque. Ample carbonation feeds a lasting head. It's malty on the nose, heavily caramelized but also very earthy, mineral, almost metallic. Hops seem to be buried beneath it all. The palate shares the same mineral and earthy notes. It's semi-sweet, very caramelized though not as metallic as I was expecting. The use of hot granite in the wort does add a unique mineral quality to the beer, but it's not overwhelming. I enjoyed this far more than I was expecting."
"D - Quite drinkable with a smooth, rich malt profile. There is enough complexity from the dark sugary notes to keep the beer interesting, but it is still smooth and well balanced. The hops are just sufficient to keep the malt from becoming cloying and they provide a herbal bite that lingers on the palate."
"Not terrible to drink, but those metallic flavors really hang around."
"D - Very nicely drinkable, a good doppelbock."
"D: This is one of the better doppelbocks I've had."
"D: The beer was very easy to drink. I would definitely consider trying this beer again given its unique style with the hot granite stones caramelizing the sugars in the malt. No traces of alcohol are detectable in the aroma or taste."
"500mL bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint a crisp copper with a decent light tan that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is dark malts and slight caramel. The taste is sweet malts and some sweet malts with an interesting caramel finish, there is also a hint of brown sugar. The beer is on the light side of medium with its alcohol nicely hidden. This is certainly an interesting beer, one I could see trying again if the mood hits me."
"Guess I'll never learn. Opened a gusher near my desktop. Luckily a mess everywhere except the pc.Poured with a smallish tan head that settle to a light cover which lasted and a little lace. Aroma is toffee, malt, a little molasses and dark ripe fruit. Flavor's like aroma and very malty sweet. Of course with a beer this sweet the body is very full and thick with good carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of medium to long duration with a bit of alcohol at the end."
"Medium bodied and mellow carbonation. Pretty tasty brew and intriguing how it is brewed with red hot granite. Glad to be able to try it, thanks Dave!"
"D - I would not buy it again, but if it was at a party I could go for a few."
"This one is odd-ball but tasty. Definitely one to look for in the late spring."
"D- A very drinkable dopplebock. Based on the label, I thought this would have been a Steinbier... and I was expecting a little smokiness accordingly. This tastes more like a solid- quite drinkable dopplebock."
"Drinkability: Better than many doppelbocks yet can't reach the heights of the best. It's good and easy to drink without any complexity."
"Poured almost perfectly into a .5 liter stein a chesnut brown with a large fluffy almond colored crown.Aromas were mainly sweet caramel with a touch of toast thrown in,flavors are big in the caramel sweetness department,a tinge of dark fruit,and some toastiness in the finish.Nice flavors but it can get a bit sweet keeping the drinkability down a tad,a pretty good doppelbock beer."
"Alcohol does show, but still pretty drinkable. A bit too sweet and boozy, though a decent sweet, warming sipper. Very, almost too, caramelish."
"An interesting beer really sticks in the mouth. I like it."
"Drinkability: No trouble here finishing my portion. A fine, upstanding bock, providing you like'm sweet and malty."
"Drinkability? Though the abv isn't much of a factor in the drinking, I can't say I'd yearn for more when I'm done here. It's good but not inspiring..."
"I can see quite a few shades of brown in my glass right now. If you'd like a brief selection, grab the box of 96 crayons and read the sides of those that at least vaguely look brown. ...Or I suppose you could just look at a glass of Granitbock for yourself... Either way. I realize that I've been circumventing a real description, so I'll fill in some gaps by saying that the core is lovely dark mahogany and, as the eye prgrosses outward, this bleeds through a few shades into a rosy walnut. A deep haze pervades throughout. Not quite as pervasive is the aroma, though I've tended to find bocks somewhat lacking in the scent department. What's there is some weak cinnamon, brown sugar, and wheat. As weak as they have been for me, I have enjoyed their grainy/spicy quality. And, even better, this translates beautifully in the taste. Reprising their roles are the cinnamon, sugar, and wheat, but a woodiness and nuttiness are also present, culminating in a nice almond-laced aftertaste that lounges about for awhile, sinking into its newly-purchased muscular sofa. I feel this bit helps distinguish this particular brew from its similar cousins. The familiar familial traits of medium body, light carbonation, and sevefrely smooth feel are all here, and I think baldness is as well, but it's still too soon to know for sure. As much as I often feel bored with them, I always find myself enjoying my time with the Bocks, and now I have a new friend in Granit."
"500ml bottle served in a Blvd. Tank 7 Tulip. Poured a reddish brown with a finger of tan head. Aroma of caramel malt and molasses. Medium bodied, malty. Maybe a bit thin for a doppel. Some dark fruit and caramelized sugar. Quite metallic in the finish. Very disappointing."
"Exceptionally delicious, and the burnished toffee notes offered by the utilization of hot stones in the kettle is, though somewhat subtle, quite nice and interesting for a Doppelbock. My second beer from Brauerei Hofstetten, and so far I'm in love."
"Very little head, barley gets to a half finger, dark tan in color, zero lacing. Red to auburn brown, noticeably clear, more of a metallic shine around the rims, very pretty. Super-rich nose of caramel, nougat, honeyed nuts, raisin bread, dried apple and pear fruit, cinnamon stick, there is a flinty to stone and tar element which distances itself from all the sweetness, highly credible lingering in the nostrils. Medium-bodied, the initial wave of sugary sweetness settles into a steady pulse and a drier finish. Still, replete with caramel, molasses, brown sugar, nuts, candied orange peels, bittersweet chocolate. The apple, pear fruit here has some plum and cherry in it but not much of a dried fruit character. The hops don't coalesce into distinct flavors at the end but texturally create more uprightness. The carbonation is medium grade, neither noticeably absent nor present. Well-layered, if not complex, very drinkable."
"Edit: Got a chance to try this again and still found it to be sweet, but with an odd mineral/iron character going on, too. Not terrible, and probably less sweet than I remembered...but still nothing special at all."
"This is a pleasant Dopplebock - great mouthfeel and tasty."
"D: A very good example and wonderful drinking experience. The 7.3% is spot on providing just the right amount of warmth and alcohol without hindering enjoyability. I could definitely go for more of this."
"D: Decent, but for some reason I expected a little more."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass Chimay chalice, formed a 1/4"" beige head over the cloudy orangey brown brew. Head quickly falls to an uneven layer of bubbles, with average lacing at best. Aroma is sweet, with tannins and alcohol apparent. Taste follows the nose pretty well, with the tannins blossoming and bringing out an impression amount of complexity. Mouthfeel is reasonably smooth, and drinkability is good. Not quite what I was hoping for, but a good brew."
"I really wanted to like Granitbock, what with being from Austria and a Steinbier and all. A pity you cannot win them all - Granitbock is decent, but for the price is difficult to recommend."
"Pours a murky chocolate brown color with a small and short lived head; looks flat after settling. The aroma is not overly strong but has the traditional dopplebock aromas; a bit meaty with some raisin notes. The taste is big with the dark fruits, raisin in particular, light roasted meat, honey, and iron. Again, not very robust. The feel is light to moderate, though it drinks light, there is a tingley carbonation and it finishes sweet. An average dopplebock, definitely on the sweet side as the dark fruit flavors are predominate. I would like to see a touch more of a roasted malt presence to add some depth."
"It was interesting to try, and I'd try another ""stone"" beer, but the underlying bock has to be a little better to begin with. Not worth the price of admission ($5.49) for sure...."
"Sweet brown sugar and caramel aroma. Very malty and only mildly toasty. The flavor follows suit, big brown sugary doppel flavors with little in the way of smoked flavor. It's chewy, rich, and supple with a mild apple flavor from the yeast. Not bad to try, it's a little too sweet for me to return to over drier Doppelbocks like Asam-Bock and Celebrator."
"Drinkability: this is a slow sipping beer that is a bit too sweet to drink quickly. If you are in the mood for a malty beer this one will work."
"Would I buy more of it? - It was worth trying once but I doubt I'll buy another bottle as there is too much else out there that I still need to try!"
"Drinkability is great.I could have had a lot more of this."
"I had this beer in a pilsner glass. It was a medium brown color with some red highlights. A medium sized tan head. Strong malt aroma, some dark fruit. Sweet. Big malt taste, sweet raisin. This was a chewy beer. It reminded me of the brown bread I used to eat with my baked beans. Very nice."
"$5.50 per .5L bottle at Knightly Spirits in Orlando, FL. This brew pours a clear, brownish/dark red, and there's a small, but lasting head. Carbonation leans toward the low side, but is not inappropriate for the style. There's a superb, rich, toffee aroma in this beer that most American breweries never come close to emulating when trying to brew a bock. The flavor is even richer than the aroma. The delicious bock flavor in this beer is also something which is rarely found in bocks brewed outside of Austria and Germany. I'm really digging the malty, caramelized toffee flavor of this brew. This is an incredibly smooth doppelbock and one of the best I've had in a while. There's a strong maltiness, but that's what I like in a doppelbock. A little more carbonation would make it less syrupy, but it's excellent just the way it is. This beer is too expensive, but it is a very good example of a traditional doppelbock."
"Flavor is sweet malt through and through with caramel and toffee, some biscuity notes and a bit of brown sugar. Again no hops to be found, there is just a faint wisp of bitter alcohol on the finish, but overall this is a malt lovers beer. Not overly complex but certainly drinkable and enjoyable."
" A damn fine Bock for this Granite-stater."
"This is my kind of beer much of the time, and the only thing that limits its drinkability for me is the price per bottle."
"A very good option..I look forward to this on tap."
"Not really much to say about this one, unfortunately. It's a little on the dull side but good if you want to chug your doppelbocks, I suppose."
"Pours a light tea-like brown with a small tan head that recedes quickly and leaves traces of lacing. The aroma is dominated by the caramelized malts and fairly sweet with hints of a toasted character and spices in the back. The taste follows the aroma with caramel malts and a bit more sugary sweetness. The mouthfeel is light to medium for the style with decent carbonation. This is a very good bock and certainly original in the brewing process."
"On tap at the Brick Store Pub. According to the menu, ""white hot granite stones are dropped into this brew to get its caramel smoothness"". Others have done this as well, and it does taste somewhat similar. Pours dark chestnut with a very nice head and some decent lacing. Smells fruity and malty with clean caramel throughout. Tastes richly fruity with caramel, somewhat sweet, and with fairly sumptous flavors without being heavy. Some slight char on the finish, but light and clean thrroughout. Quite soft and creamy in the mouth. Pretty much as advertised, this was a nice change of pace. Nice."
"drinkability: a bit challenging"
"Really well done and quite tasty."
"Rich dark fruit bock, enjoyed at right temperature at Dunderbanks new location in Tampa. Old ale aroma, thick caramel, reddish dark colour, above average mouthfeel. Sweetish, sugary,for drinking, but not cloying. There is a secondary hop.This is bock, baby!"
"Overall this is a nice beer, though it's not as rich as some of the better doppelbocks. Still, I like the flavors and could have a lot of these if the ABV were a bit lower. Worth a shot, if for nothing else than the granite."
"An interesting new beer. Not bad at all."
