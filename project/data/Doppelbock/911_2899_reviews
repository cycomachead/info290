review_text
"one of the top beers in germany, according to this sight, and i have to admit, its taken me awhile to fine one, and i may have been blinded slightly by the hype, but as i sit down to this frothing glass of crystal clear but super dark brown brew that is kriek cherry red in bright light, do i realize and appreciate just how good this is. sometimes i think we lose track of traditional styles, and how good the good ones are, people dont rave about dopplebock, it doesnt have pounds of dry hops, bacteria, or bourbon barrels, so it slips under the radar, and that is unfortunate because it is deserving of far higher praise. as that style goes, this one is one of the better going. beautiful caramelized barley sugars here in nose and taste, and ancient yeast strain, and a pleasing softness. its so simple but yet so deep, like a well made bread pudding, save some of the residual sugar. feels like the one that is most often copied. its hard to call it as nuanced as some of the crazy wilds out there, but its quality is through the roof. amazing its a lager, i often think that with dopplebock, but especially here, there is so much yeast flavor. affordable world class german beer has the weird distinction of being shelf turd material here in colorado. i hate that, because this is what beer should be, and beer economy, but i can only imagine this fresh on tap at the source. oh baby!"

"pours cola brown with khaki head and lots of sticky lacing.  smells of licorice, fig and chocolate.  mouth coating feel with a load of spice and a little alcohol kicking in the forefront, and a raisonette background .  overall really subtly complex and delicious"
"Pours two fingers foamy, brown head, great retention, very firm lacing. Head fades eventually to a thin film, with odd little islands of froth amidst the film. Dark brown, though not cloudy, light amber shining through. Sweet roasted malty nose, smells of dried cherries and a hint of cranberries. Tastes of milk chocolate, caramel, some cocoa, followed by darker fruits and coffee on aftertaste. Long after the last sip, I detect some lingering metallic tartness toward back of tongue. Very creamy, velvety mouthfeel, low carbonation with a medium dry finish. This is a very pleasant dopplebock with a fine balance, and hides its stronger alcohol well. Not overly complex, great feel and body, a real treat. Will definitely buy again."

"Overall very easy drinking, so smooth, delicious"
"Excellent beer. I first had it in D.C's Churchkey and it knocked my socks off. Excellent sweetness to counter the dark chocolate-like bitterness. Overall really well balanced. You almost expect it to be darker and more viscous than it is. If you're a fan of Samual Smith's Oatmeal Stout then you might be a fan of this too (they definitely aren't identical of course, just same kind of sweetness and balance from a darker beer)."
"o: This beer is focused. It certainly knows what it wants to be and is just that. A solid doppelbock."
""
""
""
"Overall a fantastic example of the style and well worth the wait."
""
"Overall an outstanding brew."
""
""
""

"O-Wow, what an awesome beer. This thing really blows me away. I have always enjoyed doppelbocks, but this is a whole new level of complexity, balance, and flavor. If you want hops, go elsewhere, but if you want a delicious, full-body winter beer, you will have to work hard to do better than this."

"Picked up at a bottle shop in San Fran, might have been old because while it looked and smelled okay, the taste was just off, and certainly not worthy of the praise this one typically gets.  Would be willing to try again though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some mocha on the finish, long subtle bitterness. Not Celebrator, not by a mile, but still a beer that the maker should be proud of."
""
""
""
""
"O.  Really good dopplebock.  I would prefer a little less of the dark fruit and more roasted malt.  Still very good but Ayinger Dopplebock still my go to."
"On draft at Papago.  Pours a deep brown with a thick tan head.  Once the head went away beer was sweet and malty. Low carbonation. Great German beer character."
""
""
""
""
"O - I don't get any of the cocoa that is mentioned in other reviews. This is exactly what I expect from a dependable German Dopplebock.  I don't rate is as highly as others but it is a good beer."
""
""
"Fantastic beer. Malts, caramel, dark fruits. I could have this all day long"
"Thumbs up. A very nice dark bockbier"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with a white head and good clarity.  Aroma of caramel, brown sugar, toffee and slight alcohol.  Once again, clean malt flavor in the taste, with all due caramel.  There is just a hint of smoked meat in the integrity of the roasted malts.  Caramel, dark fruits, raw sugar, but balanced and graceful. Malty, robust flavor. Not too sweet nor strong, this is a world class beer.  Top notch doppelbock brewed perfectly to style.  I feel lucky to have found such a wonderful, indigenous German doppelbock so close to home.  Absolutely beautiful."
"Everything the brewers notes claim it to be. Pours perfectly and drinks perfectly.  Nose is rich and crisp malt.  Taste is enveloping malt with a touch of hops to back it up.  A delight of complexity as the malt unfolds with bread cocoa and dark fruit.  Perfect mouthfeel with the right little bite from carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ A very nice doppelbock being a little more roasted and chocolate and less fruity then others.  While not the best out there, it is very good overall and is certainly one to try if you get the chance."
""
"A complex yet easy drinking beer, perfect for this time of year.  This bottle was very reasonably priced at 3-something for the bottle."

"WOW. For real, this is the kind of beer I'm always looking for."
"* After hearing about this brew for the past thirty years, we FINALLY have a wholesaler that is bringing in the S&H Brands portfolio of which the Andechs brands are included, and yet for some reason said wholesaler doesn't bring in Andechs!  What a shame: I'd LOVE to try this side-by-side with a Korbinian or three..."

"Pours dark copper color. When held up to the light a vibrant red with hints of gold is revealed. Almost no head and minimal lacing. Smells of toffee, cookies, butter, wood, banana, malt, and sweet bread. Taste is bready with hints of roasted caramel, very light brown sugar, and more toffee. Not as sweet as the nose had initially suggested. An light and airy mouthfeel with very little carbonation. Good balance to the flavors. Finishes fast and pleasant without much linger. A very drinkable and delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
"Super balanced, smooth, and easy drinking. An excellent Doppelbock!"
""
"Pours into a half liter stein a deep garnet color with a off white crown atop,love the rich full color.Buttery caramel and dark German maltiness in the nose,it has an iron/metallic tinge to it.Buttery rum flavors,almost like a rum ball with that butteriness sticking around for awhile with some chocolate coming in the finish but not overly sweet.Worthy of the praise this beer is not in your face and it doesn't hit to hard in one aspect,just a great all around doppelbock."
""
"Very smooth drinking with less of that port wine, rummy taste characteristic of the style. I would still prefer a weizenbock but this is very good. Not too sweet, fully loaded with caramel and burnt sugar.  I would rank this third behind EInbecker Winter Bock and Korbinian."
""
""
""
"No hindsight required here. It's truly deserving of a ""5" in my book. I'm glad I had an opportunity to indulge and will seek this one out again."

"The nose is heavy malt, caramel, dried dark fruit, some belgian yeast, figs and biscuit.  The flavor is so smooth and easy drinking, dark fruit, raisins, caramel, a little cocoa, and a little nutty finish.  This is impressive, well balanced, medium bodied, a little chewey going down, but still very good.  I like it."

"This beer came in a mystery six pack of bombers and other large beers. I'm glad this one was in there. A real treat."
""
""

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium to dark mahogany amber with a thin khaki head that had decent retention and light lacing. Rich malt aroma of caramel malt, brown bread, nuts and dark dried fruit. Flavor follows, with dark bready and caramel malt up front backed by dark dried fruit, particularly figs and dates, a little dark fresh fruit, a hint of rye. Mild grassy hops in the finish. Good medium body with active carbonation (not producing much of a head, oddly enough). A rich, satisfying doppelbock with the best dark brown bread character of any I've tried. Lots of depth and smooth into the finish. A tempting malt bomb of a beer. Glad this brewery is available again in the Northwest."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"T: A rich wave of rye and nuttiness right away. Middle is primarily dark fruit, with a bit of banana and raisin skin. Light cocoa, molasses and rye crust on the finish. Very well balanced. A really solid doppel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A brown, reddish body with a solid 2-3 finger head; retention is average a bit. Aroma is brown suggar, bread, banana and molasses. Strong malt flavor, liquid bread, banana chips, very bready and chewy. A nice doppelbock to have."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I've heard rumors that this beer has gone downhill and/or has infection reports, etc., just wasn't sure how true/extensive it was. Though this wasn't awful, it was easy to see this isn't the beer it could or should be. Not sure if recent reviewers are obliviously blinded by its past reputation and overall rating or if I just got unlucky on this bottle, but either way, an unfortunate disappointment."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a rock-solid doppelbock, among the best I've had. Glad we can finally get these stateside."
""
""
""
"O: I've had this quite a few times vom FaÃŸ at Brauhaus Schmitz recently before finding this in a bottle, plopping down, and recording my thoughts... this was great the first time I had it, and it's growing on me more and more... this is a beer by which other beers should be graded... hopefully, it'll stay around town here for a long while"

""

""

""
""
"o: Just a beautiful beer. Different from, but on par with, Celebrator."
""
"Price Point - $4.25/16.9 oz bottle"
""
""
""
"The bottle date was late December- perhaps the beer was past its prime. Nevertheless, quite good."
"Pours a dark brown copper red color. A large head forms and fades but overall good retention. Smells of sweet toffee and a strong malt presents. The taste starts with a strong toasted malt and sweetness of toffee, carmel with raisin and chocolate. There is a subtle complexity. A faint bitter and dry finish. Creamy, smooth, and perfect carbonation. Overall, a great doppelbock. May not be at the same level as Celebrator but close. I'll be looking for it in the future."
"This just happens to be the standard bearer of the style. It's clean, delicious, full of flavor, and simply mouthwatering. I dare you to dislike this beer. It's impossible. Now that it's in the states it will be a staple in my fridge."
""
""
""
"Overall: sweet but nicely quaffable; this is an archetypal doppelbock."
"Pours a beautiful dark copper, slight hints of red (clear) with a two inch light tan, bubbly head. This a very well balanced and flavorful beer. Amazing notes of caramel, roasted malts and dried fruits. Smooth, a bit sticky on the lips in the finish. Medium bodied and goes down easy. Can easily see the high rating for this and I'm glad I was able to finally grab a bottle."
""
""
""
"O: Interesting beer. Never had a doppelbock that tasted like those hard root beer barrels you had as a kid. I assume it's some sort of herbal quality combined with caramel sweetness that is making the association for me. Very unique brew. Strong flavors for only 7.1%. Great complexity and balance too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow. This doppelbock is the bomb. At less than $4 a bottle, revisiting this beer again is going to be easy."
""
""
"O - a bit of a surprise here. I was expecting better. It's still really good, but I was hoping for a little bit more from the #2 ranked doppelbock in the world."
""
""
""
"O - Most importantly the taste takes the cake here. It totally raises the stock for me in this one. So unique and savoring. Although the other attributes aren't quite there, the taste of this beer is truly world class."
"O: An amazing example of how good dark German beers can be. If you live boozy dark Belgians try something like this and you'll be amazed"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall a very good doppelbock, approaching Celebrator and Samichlaus."
"O -- A very classic rendition of the style, yet definitely projecting its own character to distinguish itself. The Andechs is a little drier in the finish than other Doppels, yet the dark bread character up front is just what German (specifically Bavarian) brewers produce so much better than the majority of US micros can duplicate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yet another tremendous beer from Andechs. Worthy of stocking in the fridge and repeating often. Great, great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Bottom line - This is Korbinian with not as great of an appearance, but with a slightly better mouthfeel. Andechs and Korbinian are top Bavarian doppelbocks, with Celebrator slightly behind them because it is not as robust."
"I'd sum up Andechser's Doppelbock as a robust Dunkel lager. While it doesn't quite have the depth of flavor that Celebrator (my and many others' top pick for doppels) has, it does nothing wrong."
""
"Verdict: Magnificent beer and definitely the standout for the style, sorry Celebrator. I'd been longing to try this for quite some time and to find it on draft was a real joy. I had no trouble downing a liter of this over dinner and I can't wait to find a few bottles."
""
"Ancechs Dopplebach Dunkel it by far the best Dopplebock I've ever taster. Brewed in a monastery in Bavaria Germany and sold throughout the region, It's a wonderful bold full bodied beer with a molasses finish. If you ever get the chance to drink one, I highly recommend it. There are not some distributors in the US that are selling this, but I've yet to find it."
""
""
""
"A great doppelbock, rich and flavourful."
""
""
""
""
"O: Oh, yes. Much better than the first one I had but then it hasn't travelled 9000km around the world. Crap head though. It disappeared after 30 seconds."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has a complex taste; although it is a little fuller in body, this beer is still relatively easy to drink because any traces of alcohol are well hidden from the taste."
""
"Purchased on New Year's Eve at RSVP in Portland, Maine, I'll make this one a frequent purchase in 2014!"
"O: Extremely balanced, smooth and complex. Not as sweet as Celebrator, but more complex and integrated. Very well done."
"Cheers!"

"On the fuller end of medium body with a smokey roasted malt presence that gives off a decent amount of lingering bitterness. Â Hints of toast, smoke and subtle BBQ/smoked meat followed by caramel and toffee sweetness. Â This is balanced by a strong bready yeast presence as well as some hazelnut and a touch of rye spice. Â Sweetness nicely counters the roast/toasted malts. Â Finishes dry and slightly tart. Â Well balanced and refreshing. Â ABV is barely noticeable making this complex beer very easy to drink."
"O-a great Doppelbock, great rich flavors and an enjoyable beer to savor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the top doppelbocks out there for sure. It could use a little more body, but that's the only complaint. It's very easy to drink and is quite complex. Good price at $3.49 for a 500 mL bottle as well. Not easy to find in the states (at least not yet) so get some if you happen upon it"
""
"Pours a clear orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and bready aromas. Taste is much the same with toasted malt and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very malty and toast-like presence in the aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
"O - See my Ayinger review for more detail but with the Ayinger, the contrast between the various flavors is more pronounced / bolder. The Andech's has more of an integrated / balanced flavor plus a firmer mouthfeel. In this head-to-head comparison, the Andech's wins by a nose. This is the best doppelbock I've ever had. I enjoyed everything about it and look forward to having more no that they are available in PA."
"This is quite a rich beer and stands right up next to Ayinger as a world class doppelbock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really nice and smoky classic dopplebock. The smokiness allows this to be sweet but never cloying. Amazing on tap. I would certainly pick this one up again."
""
""
"A nice beer, but not quite worth the rating it has here. The difficulty for Americans to get it probably drives up its rating a notch or two. Still a nice beer though."
""
""
""
"Served in a 1-Liter mug. Brown in color with ruby hightlights and a large, beige head. Really pleasant aroma, heavy on roasted malts, raisin, and fig. I found myself going back over and over again to smell it. Medium bodied, not overly sweet as some dopplebocks can be. A touch of alcohol in the finish. Overall, a very enjoyable beer and maybe the best in its style I have had to date. One I would order again in a heartbeat."
"I looked forward to this beer for so long. It just seems so different from the standards of Celebrator & Korbinian that I've come to love."
"Taste is similar, primarily malty and sweet, with trace amounts of nuttiness and a slightly bitter finish. Faint metallic notes at times. Feel is adequate though it seems a little watery. Seems more like a Dunkel or Euro Dark Lager. Overall it's good, though not as great as I'd hoped. Would probably reach for Maximator, Optimator, or Celebrator first, but it's definitely worth a try."
""
"Overall- Really good, solid beer. I'm not the biggest fan of doppelbocks but this one is a good example of the classic style. I prefer Ayinger to this, but Celebrator seems to me an anomaly among doppelbocks. Glad that this is finally being distributed in Oregon. This is a must try and will be a repurchase if it continues to be distributed here."
"O- Decent. I'm not superbly impressed, but it has some really good caramelized characters."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good Bock that isn't too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a great beer but I was hoping for more of a toffee/caramel angle that's just not here. Still going to have to go with Ayinger-Celebrator for the standard and one to beat, but this is no slouch."
""
""
""
"4.5's across the board."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: A great dynamic brew this is one you have when you are looking to drink beer, not party not have drunken good times but really drink a brew. One thing pops into my head $2000 call girl, you spend some time enjoying that"
""
""
"This is a medium brown color, fizzy with a slight head. The smell is very sweet and heavy on the malt. Dominant smell is brown sugar. Taste is sweet and heavy, with hints of roasted marshmallows and almost no bitterness. Mouthfeel is slightly on the lighter, fizzy side for something this strong and tasty. Alcohol is hidden very well. Overall, one of the best of the style I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice beer."
""
"O: What a treat to try, among my favorites of this terrific festival and among the very best of this beer style that I've tried. Extremely easy to drink (as were the other three from Andechs at PIB, I should add...). Sweet at times, fruity, nutty, and a balanced bitterness - bold and satisfying. Very glad to have tried this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was very pleasantly surprised by this, it's damn tasty stuff, easily my new favorite in the entire style."
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
""
"Overall quite nice, cross between a nice German dunkel, and Belgian like monk style beer."
""
"4.33/5.00"

"This doppelbock is ruby brown in color with red and orange hues which add an extra texture to the appearance. That's not to ignore the good amount of lace which whip around the glass. The nose makes me think of a meal in a glass, a strong dark sweet bread note, but trailing it is a kiss of chocolate. The flavor provided is big in quantity; it's toasty, bready, a little bit sweet, and has a breath of alcohol whicc compliments rather than disturbs the chemistry of the beer. It's medium full bodied, which is fitting, though perhaps not as warming as I expected given the talk of this beer. Make no mistake, this is good stuff that I would recommend you taste when you come to Bavaria."
"Overall- One of the best Dopplebocks I've had. Truly a fantastic example of the style."
""
""
""
"Brownish ruby colour, ring of off white head, light lace on the glass as well. Smell is a nice mix of malt and dark fruits, comes off quite jammy with some nutty/almond like points, but great aromas of malts and fruit all the way through. Taste isn't quite as nice as the nose but retains the flavours of malts and nutty dark fruit, a bit jammy as well, plums and a bit of chocolate mid palate into the finish, more dark fruits in the aftertaste. Medium carbonation, medium bodied with a nice feel. A really good doppelbock but not as good as Celebrator, still really nice to be able to try this though."
"Dark brown with mahogany hues, beige head with great retention and good lace. Nose is bready, jam and dark fruit notes, nuts and toffee. Taste has mroe bready flavours, dark fruits, toasted grains, a sweeter 'jammy' flavour pervades but dries out in the finish. Medium full, real smooth lower carbonation without any alcohol. An excellent doppel, would doppel again."

"Goin' after some big fish here, the current top-rated doppelbock. Let's dance: It pours a dark-ish sienna topped by a finger of sandy khaki foam. The nose comprises dry toffee and lightly-toasted biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light vanilla bean and watered-down cocoa. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, this stuff is about as painfully average as you can get. Something tells me it's all about unattainability here: Because this stuff requires at least an overseas trade or a vacation or a lucky hookup, it's perceived as better than it really is. (I call it Westy syndrome.) Sometimes, it's still good, but it's never nearly as good as reputations hold it to be. Huge case-in-point here."
""
"Deep reddish amber appearance with a layer of beige head. Nose is very malty with hints of smoke, cereal grains, a bit of vegetal character and some notes of corn. I get some aroma of dry dog food as well... Ehhh... Not so good. Taste has a one dimensional fruity sweetness with notes of grape. A bit of a tart turn at the end. Taste is a bit sloppy. Mouthfeel is moderate with light carbonation. Overall, not a huge fan."
""
"Bottle bought in the Hague. Since i'm becoming a fan of this style i thought i would give this one a try. Well, i never thought i would drink a German beer that was so complex. It's definitely got that extra something that only the best beers in the world possess. Drink it!"
""
""
""
"Goes well with the their interesting SpÃ¤tzle dish."
""
""
""
"Overall - I've been wanting to try this one for a while due to the high reviews. It's a good beer.. but nothing mind blowing. My bottle is best before September 2012, but still.. it can't have changed all that much."

"O: A rewarding beer. A veritable loaf of bread in a glass. Extremely glad t have tried this, and a beer I will revisit whenever I get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great beer and worthy of being highly ranked as (one of) the best in it's style. This is more subdued and balanced than some of the American Craft takes on doppelbock. It's in the same league as Ayinger Celebrator in my book."
"D - This is a very good doppelbock, but I think the unavailability factor may drive up the scores a tiny bit. Still, it seems mellower than Ayinger Celebrator even though it's a bit higher in alcohol. I could easily drink a half-litre on my own and I'll make sure to do so next time I'm in Europe."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest to effervescent level of carbonation. It is crisp and somewhat lighter in the feel for 7+%. This is a solid integration of flavors with nice complexity. It has a lingering cling on the palate almost like butter which is my only gripe. Overall a really nice experience that was significantly better than I was expecting. No wonder this is #1 in the style. Get it."
"Smooth, not too heavy, and very enjoyable, this is definitely a top-notch doppelbock. Definitely unique, but hot damn I would love more of these."
""
""
"I've had this one on tap, served in a 1 liter glass directly at Andechs monastery. The trip and ambiance played certainly influence my perception and appreciation of this beer. Very nice dark roasted malts without being too sweet which makes it one of the most easy drinking doppelbock. Wish they would import bottles of this in Canada."
"O: Decent Bock, very interesting taste and smell, balanced aromas, overall a good dark Doppelbock, but the mouthfeel is a little disappointing."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Just a fine example of a wonderful style. Wonderfully layered, sweet, savory and rich. Glad I have more!"
""
"Big thanks to Thirsybird for bringing this back from Germany. 500ml bottle. 6/9/12 indicated on the label. Pours the color of mahogany with a translucent clarity and a loose, quarter inch, tan-colored head that dissipates into soapy swirl. Nose is somewhat dull and doesn't really reveal all that much - just a suggestion of sweetness. Taste is malty, albeit not overly sweet, and somewhat subdued on the backend. There's also a hint of prunes and a faint, German yeast character. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Overall, a very solid and drinkable doppelbock; however, definitely lower in alcohol than many of the other representations of the style that I've tried. That said, not a beer I would recommend for extended cellaring."
""
""
""
"This beer starts out as ""pretty damn good"" then finishes with ""crap, it's gone."" Very great overall."
"O: Very impressed. Great flavor profile and extremely easy drinking. Mouthfeel is superb."
""
"Beer is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, creating a smooth mouthfeel that's a bit pillowy and creamy. Slightly warming from ethanol, but this is expected. Finishes dry with some stickiness on the lips."
""

""

""

""
""
"A very good beer, but I have to admit, itâ€™s not as outstanding as I had imagined. I realize this is among the gold standard for the style. Very happy to have tried it."
""
""
"Pours a deep reddish orange with a frothy tan head that slowly recedes to form a cap on top. Smells of caramel, raisins, burnt sugar, melanoid, slight earthy aroma. Taste is quite sweet with lots of darker and burnt sugars, dark dried fruit like raisins and prunes. There's a touch of alcohol heat but it disappears just after I notice its there. Long lingering sweet malty prunes on the finish. Medium to full body with a moderate level of carbonation, and a sweet almost bubbly mouthfeel. That's a nice bock here, I only wish it were a little easier to come by on this side of the pond."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear garnet with a fizzy body and no head. Weird, off look on this. Nose is sweet roasted chestnuts, malted chocolate balls, a signature doppelbock malt. Thin and fizzy in the mouth. Flavor is heavy roasted chestnuts, malted chocolate, a nice dry earthy quality. Either this is an old bottle or something else went wrong as the texture and appearance are all wrong. I'd like to give this another try down the road as it has a lot of nice, warm flavors going on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: There is a reason this is a sought after beer. Very well put together, this is the type of beer that I would drink again."

"Best by date 06/06/12. Poured a 500ml bottle into my Hennepin globe glass. This beer pours a mahogany brown,with a decent 1 inch head that leaves just a little lacing. The aroma is amazing. Huge notes of caramelized sugars. Toffee and toasted breads. Dates and figs cover just a hint of booze. Super complex nose. The flavor starts off with dark fruits. Dates with just a little prune. Brown sugar and caramel. Toast mingling with earthy hops. Just a tiny hint of booze as it warms. The mouthfeel is light and creamy with just a bit of dryness on the finish. Man, this a fantastic beer. I'm so glad I finally got to try it."
"Thanks a lot Todd!"
"Had this on tap following the brewery tour at the Andechs Kloster. Nice mahogany pour with two finger off white head that fades pretty quickly with minimal lacing. The nose is all toasty malt, with hints of brown bread, caramel, chocolate, and just a touch of banana and dark fruit. The taste is much the same with loads of toasted malt, brown sugar and caramel along with hints of toffee and chocolate. The dark fruits really come out as it warms, and the sweetness becomes more intense. The hops are subtle, but add just enough bitterness to keep it from being too sweet. The mouthfeel is really creamy and smoothe. I'm not a huge bock beer fan, but this is a world class beer that really represents the style well."
"Thanks, Doodler, for the opportunity"
"Prost!"
"O: Overall this is an easy drinking beer for 7.1% and is quite enjoyable. I would drink a ton of it if I were in Germany."
"Overall: I think I can say that a few weeks out from the brewery, this is probably more than worthy of 'the best dopplebock in the world' title that it receives here on BA. Even now, with four months having passed since the 'best by' date, this is still probably my favorite dopplebock I've ever had. I love the strong, toasty bread and caramel flavors and the way they balance with a hint of dark fruit. The hop bitterness is just enough to keep this from becoming cloying. Really well done. Thanks again to Kate for this awesome treat!"
"This was a nice taste and I am glad to get to try one of the highest rated doppelbocks, but the graininess is a bit much for me. I am much more of an ale drinker."
"O - this is pretty good."
"O-solid brew, Germans know his to make their beer..."
"Pours A golden brown. A nice touch of tan head. Smells heavily of barley and other maltiness. As simple as i could ever expect. Tastes just like it smells. Simple. Barley, malts, overall not too crazy but solid. This is a boring style in my opinion but this brew tastes great. Incredibly simple while still being tasty"
"O - A cracker. Very easy to drink but well worth savouring. Deserving of its high rating."
"O - Pretty great beer. This is a style that is hard to do tons with, but it is rich, with good flavors and balance."
"Overall: Very drinkable and highly enjoyable!"
"cherry-lacquered brown in color with a dense, spongy, 3/4"" tan head riding on top for the duration of the beer. Aroma is delicately composed of french silk pie with chocolate graham crust, stark chocolate toffee, flame licked tree bark, and turtle fudge frozen custard. Flavor chimes in as lighter fairing. Cocoa dusted, crushed graham crackers. Silky chocolate trait folds back the fragile flavor layers. Liquefied chocolate wafers emit a vibe akin to a touch of room temp hot chocolate, cooled at its warmest state with an ice cube or two and dulled it down by doing so. Mildly roasted accents with circumstantial caramel drizzles. Errs on the light side, gently tossing over the tongue with a momentâ€™s respite at more concrete semi-chocolate characteristics. A mild chocolate butterscotch generality gently weaves in and out as we go along."
"drunk from a snifter glass. pours dark brown with some orangy huhes. medium sized off-white head. aroma of caramel, raisons, very roasty, sweet,with a bit of alcohal. flavor is sweet and caramely, dark malts, very flavorful. just a bit of alcohal at the end. probably my favorite doppelbock although i have only had about five different ones."
"Overall a good doppelbock, went great with a cheese sandwhich too."
"Again... perfect drink for pumpernickel bread slices. Marvelous winter warmer."
"Wonderful beer! It's almost worth a return trip to the Munich area."
"medium mahogany with a big light beige had, great retention and lacing... epitome of a doppelbock, molasses, prunes, bready... the taste is just like the nose but with a touch to much alcohol on the finish... not my favorite style but its great for the style"
"Overall: For those who enjoy a good Doppelbock this is easily in the upper echelon of the style so consider it a must. This beer sets a standard. Make a mecca and go see the monastery. The food and beer are extraordinary and will set the mood for the best, most palatable, experience."
"Yeah, I'm not particularly impressed with this. It's a malt bomb; it's quite plain. I don't like beers that are this sweet but this commits the double sin of lacking nuance or complexity."
"Overall: A good beer, not the best beer, but a solid representation for the style."
"Overall a solid doppelbock, the best? Maybe."
"It's not a bad brew, but it's far less complex and far less exciting than some of the other brews I've had the privilege to try this evening. I feel I've had much better doppelbocks, and I'm a little disappointed that I saved this one for my 1200th review."
"this is a classic and a proper formed beer. but in the face of some fresh examples in germany this is just on par with some other solid beers. color is dark bronze with a nice healthy head that was consistent through the easy drinking 5 minutes the glass when down. a wonderful balance of bock. some leather smokey, some hay, some toastiness. but still not as smooth as expected. lean like a lager and no abv in sight. this is a proper and food ready doppelbock."
"O- Amazing beer. Strong and dense in body and flavour but still as amazingly drinkable and balanced as the best bavarian beers are"
"D: Doppelbocks are great and this one is a great exampel of the style. The brewer doesn't mess with anything besides the basics and that is what makes this beer fantastic. The only thing that could make this beer better is time - I'm so happy that I bought myself a whole case and put most of it in my beer cellar for the future. Maybe I'll review another bottle from this batch in a couple of years after storing it properly..."
"The CPJ"
"D= A very drinkable beer. Each sip left me wanting another, and the ABV is dangerously well hidden. I could see drinking a few of these in a sitting!"
"I really like this beer. I first had this beer while in Munich. The look of this beer is very good with its brownish red color and the medium foam once it is poured. The foam does abate after a couple of tastes. The smell continues to get better with time and as the beer acclimates toward room temp, but the smell has the roasted malt smell one loves in this style of beer. The taste is exceptional with its malt, slight hop bitterness, and the overall mouthfeel is exploding with flavor once again as the beer acclimates. I feel that I could easily enjoy two of these beers at one sitting being carful to remember that it has a 7.1% ABV. Prost!"
"D: Excellent drinker, I would love to have a stein of this one day. It certainly deserves it's #1 Doppelbock status on here, its very refined and balanced as opposed to some that are just kind of all over the place. Excellent beer."
"If I had to choose three beers to take with me to a lonely island this one would be on the shortlist."
"D: Insanely drinkable. It took a lot of willpower to drink this as slowly as I did. My highest recommendation."
"Right off this thing is super creamy and smooth, light carbonation is spot on, it makes it velvety and smooth without over doing it on the palate. There is a bit of an iron taste to it which is the only detracting thing about it. The dark caramel, and molases comes through really well. You can almost taste the alcohol, but it's don't very well for 7.1%, it's there but it's not in your face. Easily one of the best doppelbocks I've ever had, and certainly deserving of it's spot in the top 100."
"d - Overall I loved this beer and am so glad I got to try it/that it didn't disappoint. It looked amazing and I really enjoyed the caramelin the taste. I felt like I could have drank a ton of this, and wanted to. Would love to have again and something I'll be on the look out for if I ever go to Germany. Up there with Ayinger Celebrator for my favorite of the style."
"D - You will not find a better Doppelbock anywhere"
"Mouthfeel is semi slick with medium+ body and high carbonation."
"(D)- An excellent Dopplebock. Rich and sweet, but smooth/clean and an easy drinker for the style. Great stuff."
"D - Very good dopple. Great drinkability. I really like the malt presence in this awesome German lager. They know their dopples!"
"D: Overall fantastic. Super smooth and drinkable. I could easily have polished this bottle off myself. Thanks again Matt."
"Pours a fairly clear deep brown color with a copper tint. Two-finger tan head with great retention and lacing. Crackery malt and toasted bread mix with caramel on the nose. Caramel, biscuit and light toast with a very mild heat on the slightly sweet finish. Medium-to-full-bodied with moderate carbonation and a lightly sweet finish. Somewhat drinkable as the alcohol is fairly well-hidden and the flavors are clean and decently complex. Very good doppelbock overall, but I've had a few much more widely available examples of the style that I like a bit more."
"Bottle. Courtesy of drabmuh on BA. Pours a dark copper brown red color with a big 2 1/2 finger head that settles down rather quickly to a nice offwhite coaster head. Malty aroma for sure with notes of raisins, plums, nuts, caramel, and slight spice like cinnamon. Minimal lace left on the glass. Nice medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. The taste is a real nice balance. Slightly sweet with fruit like characteristics and a nice bready, biscuity backbone that balances it all out. Ends pretty cleanly without any apparent bitterness. The alcohol is very existant in the flavors. I imagine drinking this from a huge stein in Germany with all my BA & RB buddies, wouldn't that be sweet!?"
"Overall, a very nice lager. One of the top imo. The toastedness really ties this beer together. I am a fan of this one. Pretty drinkable."
"Pours a light brown with a slight bit of head. The aroma is light and is mostly nuttiness and some musty malt. The flavor is very nutty with a caramel maltiness. It is fairly light and lacking rich complexity, but it is a damn near a perfect session style ale (well, the ABV is a bit too high for that perhaps). If this was imported it would possibly be my ""go to"" beer for everyday drinking situations. Just so well balanced and zero off-flavors."
"Beer leads off with some sweetness, gives way to a medium bodied beer with some toffee notes in the midpalate. The whole thing is well connected and finishes cleanly with no aftertaste. Its a simple beer, simpler than expected, lighter than expected but it makes no mistakes. Its sweet but not cloying, its balanced with no bitterness and a moderately dry finish. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely drink it again. I'm glad I have several more."
"I wish I could have tried all the Andechser beers at this place but unfortunately could only get through three. Next time..."
"Beer has a great mahogany colour, is smooth without too much carbonation but I just drank a cheap french lager. Can smell smoked dark chocolate, it also tastes like smoked beer. There are hints of coffee and dark chocolate. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste. Too heavy to session but still very good. This is a beer I can recomend to fans of doppelbock but I won't be drinking it every weekend"
"Overall I didn't find this beer as mind-blowing as I'd hoped, and in fact I'd rate Celebrator higher, it's still a very good beer. To be fair it was noted by Joe that it was substantially better on tap. Worth a shot."
"D Good, but for me, not really worth having another. 3"
"On the nose there was almost a burnt bready woody medicinal smell. On the tongue it is pretty dry, vinous with a flavour reminiscent of treacle and molasses. Tasty but it does not have the richness of classic Aventinus and I can't help but feel as if it was almost closed like a young tannic wine. Makes it slightly on the stern side as well. Very good but despite its initial promise in the end it flatters to deceive."
"Overall, tremendous brew from Andescher! I thought this brew would be hyped simply because it is non-imported, but it is a delightful brew to sip. Basically non-imported + tremendous brew = ISO. Glad I have another bottle."
"drinkability: This is classic history here. Great dopple, but I rank it a little behind Celebrator and Liberator."
"0.5L mug served vom fass with a rich creamy tan head. Deep amber/maple color. Rich full toasted barley taste, sweet, maple, faint smokey flavor. While almost a meal on its own, surely it is an amazing compliment to cheese products or salty meat dishes (available at the cafe!) Reminiscent of a Nut Brown, but with a much fuller and conscious substance. Truly delicious, particulalry at the source. Enjoyed at Kloster Andechs - I highly recommend you visit this place."
"D. Not so much."
"Not at all bad. Sampled at a ""blind"" beer tasting at De Klomp, LinkÃ¶ping, Sweden. We did nail it."
"Drinkability: This beer has certainly convinced me that there are great bock beers out there and I will most certainly be having this one again many times in the future."
"Nice brew, recommended."
"I will have more!!!"
" D- The full rich dark malt with some lager qualities and no real nougat melanoidins notes. This is a big beer with a nice supporting bitterness. It is a full meal in a glass."
"A very good beer thats maybe too easy to drink? I don't know if thats possible but I think it tasted too simple to me. I would have liked more flavors to linger on my tongue for me to ponder. Instead the beer just made me more thirsty."
"D: A pleasant drinking experience! My glass was empty before I knew it. I wish this was available in the states... I'd drink it every time I grilled some sausages. Glad I was able to finally track this one down."
"D: Excellent drinkability, especially for a doppelbock. Went through 2 liter glasses quite quickly. Possibly my favorite beer."
"D: I really liked this doppelbock, which is becoming a style that I enjoy very much. Good flavor and mouthfeel, and easy to drink."
"The mouthfeel is is on the heavier side and carbonation is relatively low. Excellent mouthfeel overall. Drinkability is good, it's a very flavorful and easy drinking beer. I really enjoyed it and would gladly have another, but would probably opt for something more available here in the U.S. in the future. I liked Thomas Hooker's Doppelbock just as much, if not more anyway."
"D- I didn't even realize how fast I finished it. Definitely very easy to drink. Went down really easy."
"Overall - I have no idea how I didn't think this beer was anything particularly special the first time I tried it."
"Drinkability: Don't serve this too cold, it definitely got better as it warmed a bit; ABV was a bit higher than I expected (and was felt/tasted)"
"I drank the beer during a game of cards. Then it's very drinkable."
"Overall a good beer that I would drink again."
"D: Man I wish I knew how to get this stuff in the states!! One of the best dopplebocks I've had."
"Overall I will be trading (with hopefully my regular germany trading partner) for this many more times. Gunna keep this one around for others to try."
"Notes: Very nice malty beer. Sweet but not overly sweet. Just a very easy and enjoyable beer to drink. Luckily the taste also lingers a bit. It doesn't seem like a beer that blows me away or really shocks me, but rather a beer that I would happily drink everyday. Very rich flavors, but it isn't too much or cloying. Wonderful beer, if you can try it, do so."
"Ultimately I find the flavor too strange to drink extensively. It doesn't sit on my taste buds in a great way."
"Not as much of a malt-bomb as some 5% Munich Dunkels due to the fruity complexity of the higher alcohol. Perhaps the definitive doppelbock - it's the highest rated lager on BeerAdvocate and with good reason. A truly superb beer."
"This is one of those beers that just strikes you as really awesome. Supremely drinkable. Will seek this one out again for sure. Pretty sure this clocks in as my favorite doppelbock of all time."
"D quite good, very smooth, perfect amount of carbonation"
"D- Perfect. It is spot on for a dobblebock."
"This is definately the top Dopplebock is Germany, only wish it had a cool ""-ator"" name however, I guess The monks at Andechs were too busy brewing perfect beer to spend too much time on names, it speaks for itself"
"This one succeeded where others have failed and I am not left any choice but to give it highest ratings. Andechser is the reigning king of my own little Beerverse."
"D: The combination of the elegant mouthfeel and complex taste make this one well worth coming back to sip after sip. Thanks again to Alex for letting me try this one, although I'll definitely say that my search will only intensify as we get into bock season and this one keeps springing back into memory."
"Granted, I'm not the hugest fan of this style but that metallic quality is really off-putting. Great mouthfeel, just spot on carbonation level creates a nearly chewy body which is just excellent with the breadiness and creates a supremely drinkable brew. I was left a little underwhelmed overall, and kind of annoyed by this rust flavor, but would happily give this another shot down the road."
"This is a drinkable beer and one in this style that I'll seek out again."
"I just love this one, it's one of the finest examples for German beers and I would highly recommend trying it out."
"The taste is sweet, some caramel, and a lingering aftertaste. I could also taste a little of the alcohol as well. This was a good beer, but not the best I had on the trip. Some questionable mouthfeel."
"Very drinkable for the style and spot on what it should be. A great beer."
"The floral hoppiness is kicked up a notch in the flavor, and thankfully so, as crisp, sweet caramel malts balance a bitter, semi-piny finish. Tastes very organic with a simple, clean profile--no off-flavors hidden by an overload of malt in this doppelbock. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but smooth and crisp with a well-carbonated body that accentuates the hops nicely on the end. All in all, a very easy-drinking, very tasty beer. One of the more unique takes on a Doppelbock that I've had the good fortune to try. Not quite at the top of my list for the style, but right up there..."
"D - I see can why this one is rated to high here on BA. I didn't expect to be so blown away by this one. It easily surpassed my expectations. I don't know when I'll get to try another, but I am already looking forward to it."
"Body is only medium with a respectively full level of carbonation. It definitely still feels like a drinkable lager. A very finely crafted lager, looks and smells great, good flavor, and feel reminds me that this is indeed a lager, feels too light though, almost like a pilsener. I came into this with absurdly high expectations, however, and as far as taste goes I found this to be quite a good doppelbock, but probably not my favorite."
"Creamy slick mouthfeel, with soft carbonation."
"D: Pretty good. Wonderful malt bomb."
"Drinkability? If I had another bottle, I'd pop the cap on that puppy too! Incredibly drinkable with neither a hide nor hair sight of the alcohol. Man, if this was an easier beer to find like, say, it was in town, I'd be drinking it several times a week. One word sums it all up for me...Incredible!"
"O: High drinkability. One of the best German beers, for sure. Very rich on smell and tte. Not recommended, but mandatory"
"Soft carbonation and a creamy foam-up on the toungue makes it fairly easy to drink."
"I really, really recommend this beer. A great doppelbock."
"Even mouthfeel, a bit slick, finishes somewhat powdery and dry. Tasty beer, decent drinkability, but could use more complexity. I expected much more based on the over-the-top reviews. Thanks to BuckeyeNation for sharing."
"Drinkability: I would drink this all day if I could. It tastes great, not heavy at all and the finish is just sooo damn clean and refreshing."
"Thanks Charlie for turning me on to this one. It was well worth it."
"D: Very manageable ABV and very drinkable... could be dangerous, though. Everything with this beer is perfectly balance. Nothing extraoridinary but just done so well in all areas that it makes a great beer."
"This beer definitely lives up to the rating. I only wish I could get it regularly. It would definitely be a permanent fixture in my fridge."
"D: I had no problem enjoying two maÃŸen of this beer. I'd love to visit Munich again someday, and this will be one of my definite stops if/when that happens."
"D - Overly sweet and very candy-like, this is a pretty good Dopplebock overall. But the best ever? Hmmmm. We sampled this side by side with Celebrator, and this definitely fell short."
"D: As for doppelbocks go - a style I sometimes have a hard time dealing with due to the cloying sweetness some of them showcase - this is one of the better I've had. The sweetness is not overly powerful and the ""dunkel element"" in this one adds lots of levels and flavors. Nicely balanced. But still, it's not the most interesting beer in the world, and after one bottle I've had more than enough."
"This beer is THE example for the Doppelbock style; deep color, rich aromas, sweet and malty flavors with an oilslick for a mouthfeel. Few brews are better under the chestnut trees when the weather turns cold in Bavaria than this one. The only negative I have is that I'm never able to drink an abundance of them. Introduce this Doppel to an acquaintance and you'll have a friend for life."
"Wonderfully drinkable, liquid bread indeed."
"Mmmm... mmm... good!"
"Had NO IDEA this beer was so highly-rated on BA. Had I known, I might have picked up more bottles on my recent German adventure, but judging from the # of reviews here, maybe it's available in the states? Nevertheless, now that I know it, I will definitely be on the lookout for more. Yummy, and that's putting it lightly."
"Guess what drinkable eh!!!"
"Drinkability: A great German brew that is worth seeking out. I can't imagine a better doppelbock than this one. Spectacular aroma and closely matched taste. An awesome brew."
"It's a religious experience just drinking this beer, but I feel extremely lucky to have gotten the chance to drink it from the source. It's required traveling for any beer lover, and I cannot wait for the next chance I have of making the pilgrimage."
"The flavor is amazingly rich for a lager. Sweet fruit notes of prunes and plums are noticeable, and the malt is sugary sweet and toasted with a low level of alcohol. A hint of oxidation imparts sherry notes. It's at a low level and isn't detrimental to the great flavor. The finish is rich, with lingering fruit notes. The beer is medium full bodied with a lower level of carbonation that works quite well with the rich malt and fruit."
"D - A very nice beer. Not sure its worth the hype for me, but I like it!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with solid medium body. Quite drinkable and somewhat like a meal in a glass. ""Liquid bread"" is not a bad way to describe this one. Well worth tracking down if you love doppelbocks. I would love to try this at the source sometime."
"Damn I can see why this is so well reviewed. This bottle is probably over two years old. Shows hints of oxidation which add a sherry like quality to the middle and finish. Beginning is all toffee, caramel, mollasses brown sugar and a walnut type nuttiness. Some other dried fruits intermingled in as well. A slight roastiness on the long, decadent semi sweet finish. Mouth is round and chewy with light carbonation."
"I must once again say thanks to Dave from FL for giving not one, but two of these up in a trade - the first being damaged. He was right in saying this was one of the best beers he's had yet on the best of BA."
"Drinkable, though I'd prefer to savor a smaller glass."
"I had very high hopes for this difficult to find brew, but unfortunately it did not win me over. This is a better than average doppelbock but definitely not one of the best (and certainly not a top twenty-five beer, in my opinion). I am perplexed as to why this beer garners the attention that it does."
"My brother-in-law brought me back a bottle of this from Germany. I told him to pick up anything, and was surprised to see this waiting for me. This pours a brilliant rusty, deep copper body with maroon highlights and perfect clarity. The head was very bountiful and bright white. The aroma is wonderfully fresh with fresh dough and toffee highlights. Hops are very subtle as the maltiness leads the way. The taste is filled with sweet caramels and toffee-like sugars. A slightly metallic sharpness seems to be a product of the hops and crystal malt. Not all that complex, but superbly layered. A coarse finish produced by the hops creates a perfect balance between the insanely smooth body and mouthfeel. As it warms, the sweetness increases and it goes down easier with each sip. Although I am not a huge dopplebock fan, this one is very well done and credit is due. I am glad I had the pleasure to taste this."
"Overall, thanks again dyan for hooking me up. If you are a doppelbock fan, this is definitely the perfect example of the style. We need to figure out a way to import this into the U.S."
"OVERALL: Quite drinkable, goes down very easy, but unfortunately it's not quite memorable. Kind of neutral and overrated in my view. This is one I'd have again, but wouldn't go out of my way to find."
"I had this so many times. Always perfect quality. Straightforward like all German beers but still very flavorful. Loads of malts in both aroma and flavor. Nice sweetness, balanced bitterness, toffee and some butterscotch. Once had 6 bottles of 0,5 litres in a row and could still walk straight and no hangover. Great brew."
"Finally able to try this one. Poured into my nonic pint glass from a 500ml bottle. Appears a clear ruby red and brown color with a healthy two fingers of tan foam. Notes of dark fruits, bready grains and caramel malts are obvious in both the nose and taste. Really delicious and complex flavor full of sweet caramel malt, dark fruit and a touch of chocolate. Medium in both body and carbonation. Best doppel I've tried so far."
"One of the best of examples of the brewers art I have found."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"A malt bomb of the highest order, Andechser Doppelbock is in a league of it's own. Prost!"
"Overall, this beer is worthy of all of the praise it's received. A must try!"
"And to think that my wife's sister can get it in a regular supermarket for the equivalent of around 2$... Two dollars!... I want to cry..."
"Notes from 12/17/07."
"500mL bottle. Pours a clear chestnut color, capped with a fairly large khaki head. Enticing aroma; roasted malt, grain and hay take the forefront, and are nicely complimented by dark chocolate, molasses, and mild hops. Grain and roasted malt are the dominant flavors, with alcohol, chocolate cake, and dark fruits rounding things out and adding complexity. Fairly long finish, with chocolate and malt lingering on the palate. Very drinkable. The best doppelbock I've ever tasted. World Class."
"UPDATE: I had a few more bottles tonight, and I have to say it's just a damned great beer. I just can't believe the ABV, given the mouthfeel. A lovely damned beer. Tops in the dopplebock category, particularly because of it's prevalance in Germany and ubiquitous distribution. (I bought this round in a gas station.) I can't believe such a brilliant beer is so readily available."
"Had a liter of this on tap at the pub in Munich and was yearning for more as I left, simply a phenomenal beer. I'm inclined to say that this beer has to be tried on tap to fully grasp how good it is, as the fresh bottle I tried earlier in the year simply did not compare."
" Prosit!"
" ~ I must admit this is one of the finest, if not THE finest, doppelbock I've ever had. I will look again for this brew and hope to someday enjoy one on German soil with my good friends, Bill and Marla. Did I say thank you?"
"In the end, I was utterly blown away by this one. One of the best beers I have ever had, period. It was just so smooth it almost defined logic. I could not simply imagine having something this good, and here I was enjoying it. This one needs to be tried by everyone, it defined the style for me. What a happy night."
"T + M + D: A nice, rich body with almost a creamy butteriness to the feel. This complements the warm malts very nicely. A bit of a butter-icing flavour. A sparkling carbonation adds a nice touch to the already great feel. A delicious doppelbock, and perhaps one of my favourites to date. The warming of alcohol comes out a little bit towards the end of the bottle, but keeps fairly well hidden for the most half. Makes for quite easy drinking, with a little kick on the way out."
"150 reviews as of this writing. Thanks to redhaze for the chance to try this gem. I've had a number of US interpretations of this style and enjoyed them. This.... This beer set's the standard for me and is one I'd be happy to enjoy again except for the whole getting access to it. If you like your dopplebock malty, crisp and oh so easy to quaff try this one. If you get the chance definitely go for it!"
"Pours dark amber with a small butter cream colored head that quickly recedes to a ring. Aroma is of caramel, brown sugar, some very nice toastiness that mixes well with the sweet maltiness, crackers and bread, and a bit of graininess. Taste follows with some sweet maltiness up front, golden raisin sweetness, fruit and berries, caramel, a great molasses quality, toasty grains lead to a nice crisp hop quality in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body, carbonation is on the low side which allows the malty sweetness to weigh slightly on the palate before a small peppery crispness works to balance it out towards the finish. Very enjoyeable and highly drinkable beer."
"Clear reddish brown with a garnet, purplish hue when held up to the light. A one finger cap of dense, off-white foam appeared after the pour, settling to a skim of fine bubbles and solid collar after a few minutes. Sticky, spotty lacing. Tons of malt character in the aroma, very cakey and bready, rich with notes of toast and biscuit. It had some fruit character as well, mild dried fruits like raisins and figs. Flashes of dry cocoa and darker malts, plus a bit of smoke, appeared as it warmed too. There was a solid bitterness lying beneath the malt flavour, never too far forward yet providing the necessary balance. Light citrus mid-palate hung around through the finish. Alcohol was present from the start, but stayed light and balanced throughout. Malt sweetness played the dominant role, but the caramelized sugar and bread flavours weren't let run wild. Notes of cake and toffee, perhaps a bit of biscuit, floated in and out of focus, along with some dried fruit sweetness and a hint of yeast. The finish wasn't overlong, but a balanced combination of flavours lingered for a while on the palate. Medium bodied with medium/low, well integrated carbonation. Texture was a bit creamy and chewy. This stuff is superb. I was expecting a lot of malt, but was pleasantly surprised by the complexity of flavours present. That quality made this a pleasure to drink, and very easy to polish off a bottle."
"This is truly a beer that has been perfected over the ages, and by ages I mean centuries!"
"Thanks to RedHaze for the chance to try this beer. Very generous in a trade, and I'd probably not have had the chance to try this otherwise. Pours a very dark brown with ruby highlights. The head is not bad, but nothing special, and it fades fairly quickly to a thin swirly head. Smells of dark pumpernickel bread, very dry malt, blackstrap molasses, and an earthy bitterness. Black bread in a glass. The taste is even richer and breadier, but with some wonderful dark bitterness laced throughout. More black bread, and an earthy, grainy bitterness, especially at the finish with dark chocolate bitterness. Up front there is ssome creamy sweetness to start things off. Very complex, chewy, and rich. What a wonderful beer! Creamy, rich, stiff, and bitter in turns as far as mouthfeel goes. I could drink this beer all day- its just that wonderful and perfectly balanced. By far the best dopplebock I've ever had, and much less sweet and fruity than most."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. love all the fruit and caramel. a real treat. thanks again eric!"
"Pours a clear dark reddish orange, light brown, thick off white head forms, quickly settles to a medium ring, some lace spots on the glass. Smell is glorious, very bready, yeast, biscuit, caramel, bit of iron, dark fruits, bit of orangey citrus, rich and delicious smelling. Taste is great, brown sugar sweetness, citrus, light floral, then caramel, lots of dark fruit and iron, raisins, maybe a touch of chocolate roastiness, very dry biscuity finish, light bit of spice, very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, bit of warmth but very smooth. Definition of liquid bread, fantastic doppelbock."
"I'll go ahead and 'fess up on this one...I wasn't expecting to be this impressed. I'm really not a huge Doppelbock guy. This had ""overrated"" written all over it for me. But, it delivers. It's not perfect, but it is no doubt damn good. It's simply a ""must try"" for all BAs. Thanks again, Eric."
"Thanks to brdc for the trade. Just phenomenal."
"M&D: silky smooth and soft on the mouthfeel vis-Ã -vis a full body and rich flavour profile, while the texture gets slightly ""oily"" as the beer warms up. Although the sweet fruitiness and caramely characters come a bit overpowering at first, they are quickly balanced off by the complex maltiness in the mid-taste and further softened by the lingering hop bitter-sweetness and a burned undertone in the very end. This second bottle proves more pleasant than my first encounter with this beer three years ago; or, should I say, my palate is better trained now that I can finally appreciate the goodness of such a beautiful nectar?!"
"D: This is an extremely well-balanced and drinkable dobblebock. I'd probably put it a strong second among dobblebocks I've tasted. Highly recommended!"
"Thanks to Bananaman (and his father of course, who brought this from Germany) for sharing this bottle!"
"Very impressive, and certainly more drinkable than the average doppelbock given the nice balance and dryness."
"This is a really good Doppelbock with a distinguished taste/smell of dark bread. Very malty wich is pretty common for the style, but not too sweet."
"Complex and full flavors make this an interesting and enjoyable beer."
"Overall, a spectacular example of my favorite style; perhaps one of the best I've had. It was just what I needed to fend off the mass of German pilseners I had been consuming."
"I've had about twenty bottles of this so far between Germany, and the bottles I've brought back, and each time I've had this I discover another flavor that I didn;t notice before."
"Pours a very nice dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, little fizzy tan head, very minimal sticky lacing follows. The nose is very big on malts, sweet, and lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, and lots of caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty doppelbock, but I would definitely put up a Celebrator up against it, recommended. Availability is the only thing I can see that makes this special. Thanks Eric."
"The drinkability here is also amazing. This is certainly a beer that could put you in the gutter if you're not careful."
"I never thought I'd try this beer. I never sought it out. I believe in Beer Karma. Low and behold... I got a bottle thanks to RedHaze (fresh from Germany, I should add). There is some fairly high beer geek hype for Andechser Doppelbock in much the same way there is for Timothy Taylor Landlord. Both beers delivered. I thought this beer was amazing, very tasty and quite easy and enjoyable to drink. Is this the best Doppelbock in the world? Not sure. Best beer from Germany? Not sure. Is it a damn good beer? YES! Thanks again RedHaze."
"I had to review this beer because it is so special and to give thanks to BA RKHaze who brought this as a gift from his visit a year or so ago. Big, noisy rich and malty pour made my mouth water instantly. The taste is perfect with lots of baked bread, chocolate and raisins in a very refreshing package. It is a bit lighter than I expected which earns it a 5 in drinkability. I would drink a lot of this if I was in Germany. Thanks again Randy."
"Have been told this is only available in Germany so I feel pretty lucky to have been able to try this, by far the best dopplebock I have ever tasted by a large margin, best German beer I have had period actually, wish I had more after finishing this, would drink this again in a heartbeat, very highly recommended"
"D: Very easy to drink a ton of this. I wish i could find more and easily."
"(Reviewed from notes as was in Germany -5/2/08) Poured into a pint glass this beer was a light to medium amber color, semi transparent with a tan head that had decent lacing. The aroma from this beer is of roasted malt, some slight spice, and strong clove. The taste is a little sweet, some caramel, and a clove after taste. I could also taste a little of the alcohol as well. This was a good beer, but not the best I had on the trip."
"It's a smooth destinctive beer whose interesting taste leave you wanting to take anther swig just to feel the burnt coffee, leathery notes bounce around on your tongue."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this isn't normally a style that I drink much of but this beer is definitely one of the first ones that I'd pick if it were available and I wanted to drink a Doppelbock for a whole evening."
"Overall, this is an very tasty brew. Silky smooth mouthfeel and highly drinkable."
"This just gets better as it warms up a bit and I work my way through this glass; I can't quite pinpoint why (though I don't think it is just the alcohol), but it just is so rich, chewy and drinkable all at the same time. A wonderful beer, that I will most definitely have to get more of at some point in the future. I'd be curious what a fresh bottle of this would taste like, though this one is not noticeably over the hill in any way. This perhaps started out a bit slow (though still really good), but it has picked up lots of steam, finishes incredibly strong and I am now wishing I had more of this sitting in my glass right now; this is really quite fantastically tasty. Letting it warm up really makes this beer shine."
"Drinkability is amazing. Is this 7%? Really? I've had a litre of this every time I've been to Andechs (3 times now) and was A-OK every time. It's smooth, tastes amazing, doesnt sour, and isnt overly sweet. Perfectly balanced and an amazing brew. Prost!"
"When you taste it , it doesnt seem as sweet as you'd expect. Malty bready and biscuity with honey and fruity elements as well. Almost clean and crisp in the finish which is quite commendable considering that this is a somewhat sweet style to begin with. Also elements of nuts like hazelnuts or almonds too. Very nice indeed but I am not sure its really worthy of all the hype."
"Damn good doppelbock!"
"Overall a very nice example of the style but don't go expecting anything overwhelming with flavor. The taste is very balanced and kept in check. Very drinkable... Thanks to HopHead1982 for bringing this back from Germany..."
"D: The abv is moderate but it seems to really hit hard, although you'd never know it from the taste. Big thanks again to HumblePatience for this beauty."
"Even though the beer was 7.10% ABV, it was nice calm. I could sit back and enjoy several of these throughout an afternoon or evening. The beer was successful in achieving the dopplebock dunkel style and I would recommend this to anyone. Especially if you can go to Andechs southeast of Munich to enjoy it."
"Dark brown with a darkish head that disappears leaving lace around the sides. Smells very sweet - roasted malts, caramel. Taste is incredibly rich and sweet, brown sugar, toffee, nutty, butterscotch, a bit of coffee. Hops barely come through for some balance but theyre really missed. Light carbonation. This beer tastes so good I can't stop sipping. Like all dopplebocks, it seems to sit very heavy in my stomach. Nonetheless, highly drinkable, and though I'm not experienced enough to say whether it takes the cake as #1 German beer, I'd say it'd be difficult to make a more superior version of this style."
"I don't really know this style well enough to do a full review yet - maybe I'll edit later - but, as they say, I know what I like!"
"Prosit und ZumWohl, MK"
"I picked up this bottle at the Delirium Cafe a few days after Christmas. First time I have stumbled onto this treat. The beer poured a deep brown, almost black color, very dense. There was a nice tan head on this bad boy. The nose of this beer was malty and had a touch of citrus and maybe a little sweetness. The taste has a strong malt presence, some slight sweetness but also has a nice balancing affect with some bitterness. Although this is a pretty full bodied beer, it is a really smooth drinking beer. I liked this beer so much, I took a bottle home with me."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with a zippy bite of carbonation. This is a very well constructed beer (like the world doesn't know that already). Cheers."
"Drinkabilitz: I now have a second favorite Doppelbock. Glad to be in Bavaria at the moment, and looking forward to a brewery tour in a couple of days. Hopefully the beer there will be as good as this Andechs offering.."
"Smooth and rich without being heavy, this is unbelievably easy to drink."
"Thierry (14/10/2007)"
"This one was hard to track down but I think I would look long and hard again for another glass of this delightful brew."
"Thick, creamy, tan colored head sits silently on top of the hazy mahogany colored beer. Smells of chocolate and sweet malt with undertones dark bread. Sweet roasted and caramel malts mix with a fist full of raisins. Finishes with a mild dark malt astringency that never quite overpowers the firm sweetness of the brew. Good lord the aftertaste lingers. There is almost more flavor left on my tongue then I could detect in the liquid I drank. No complaints, just unique. The alcohol is barely noticeable, especially if the beer is not too cold. A solid beer with a full mouthfeel and some nice flavors."
"This is warming to the palate and will serve good as a winter treat."
"This has a dark brown/reddish body with only a little head. There is a huge malty aroma with caramel notes that pours from the glass. The taste matches the aroma with big sweet malty flavors with caramel and some accompanying bitterness that builds at the end. As it warms up, the caramel presence increases until it is nearly the primary flavor. This is only medium bodied with good drinkability. It is a good beer but I did expect slightly better because of the reputation."
"Overall - A pretty good Doppelbock but not the best in my opinion.. the Weltenburger Asam-Bock is easily better than this... definitely worth a try though..."
"Overall, not as outstanding as I'd hoped but a very good beer nonetheless."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a deep brown color doppelbock with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of banana bread with some light ester is quite interesting and enjoyable. Taste of banana bread and light ester is interesting and the creamy texture provides an even higher level of enjoyment. I have to admit that my expectations were quite high and I was glad to have been able to secure a bottle but I still believe this a notch below the Ayinger. The bottle had a BB date of 07/2007 which probably didnÂ’t help as I would think fresh bottle of this stuff would be better Â– hopefully I will have the chance to try this one gain in the near future."
"be trying it pretty soon."
"Faithful to style, and quite drinkable. Not a session beer, but you could put a few of these away before the ABV got to you. An excellent beer."
"The beer is a nice mahogany in color with some distinct reddish overtones. The head is relatively small for a dark bier but has a slight creaminess to it. The aroma smeels nicely of grain, both fresh and toasted. The taste is very malty, with again, a lot of fresh and toasted grain flavors. These balance nicely with the sweetness. This was my bier of choice at the Kloster in Andechs."
"Drank fine, gone without really knowing I drank it. Hmmff."
"Bought this in February during a trip to Germany. Poured out a cola brown, dark but see through, with a creamy tan head. The nose is fruity, malt, ruity pebbles, cotton candy, vienna malt, a nice toasty roasty aroma. The taste is big, huge, tremendous, then drops off to a clean crisp palate. Along the way it drops malt and dark fruit bombs, fresh grain taste, green grain, roasted lovelyness. Has a fantastic crisp mouthfeel, the effervescents lasts on a now prickly tongue, but not too sharp. I love when such a big beer is this incredibly drinkable. A rare quality, definitly appreciated here."
"D: Incredible! This beer has forced me to reconsider my self imposed aversion to malty beers. This is so different (to me) it boggles the mind."
"and for a 7+%er, this is easy drinking. way too easy, in fact. i highly recommend this dopple to anyone who has the means to acquire it."
"Pours a thick pillowy head that falls very quickly and leaves barely any lacing behind. The color is deep dark brown, but still you can see through it. The smell is of slightly chocolate malts with some roastiness, also a lot of breadiness. The taste is very bready with some chocolately tones and some sweetness in there as well. I enjoyed this one. Mouthfeel is very good. Overall this is avery drinkable brew and I hope to have it again someday."
"Pours a dark amber color with a strong, off-white head that retains very well. Smell of burnt caramel, slight bit of earthy hops, and some dark fruit, most noteably some cherry. Smell still is a little weak for what I was expecting, good, but not very strong. Light toastiness in the taste. Certainly some burnt caramel is noticed as well as some slightly grainy flavors. Sweet caramel finish, that ends up being dry. Higher than medium carbonation with medium body. Very nice beer to drink, I think it may be even better when enjoyed straight from the brewery."
"Drinkability- Certainly gives Celebrator a run for it's money as well as Asam Bock and Korbinian. Might edge them both out. Awesome beer that I wish I had access to on a regular basis. Thanks for the great gift Randy! Hope you enjoy the Big Sky Barleywine as much as I enjoyed this."
"Previous score: 4.5/4/5/4.5/4.5"
"D- very drinkable for the abv, i was pretty thirsty drinking this and was knocking it back, could be pretty dangerous in a session, enjoyable."
"Md thick body and heavy carbonation."
"D: The drinkability of this beer is astounding. There might be other doppels on the market that are in comprable in taste but are generally thick and chewy....which is fine...but this beer is almost ""thin"" yet packed with flavor. I could drink gallons of this beer, in one sitting."
"D - Superb. Surprisingly easy to drink."
"Klosterbrauerei Andechs has had since the Middle Ages to perfect this beer. One sip is all it takes to prove that they did so long, long ago. I might not even mind a several week, monk-like fast if I had Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel to sustain me for the duration. This is one of the three best versions of this style that I've ever had the pleasure to drink. I'd like to thank the incomparable feloniousmonk for his much appreciated generosity."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Drinkability: I want to like this, but there's so little to recommend. Other reviews trend higher, but most other examples I've had of this style are better."
"I think the body of the beer is too heavy which seriously inhibits the drinkability of the beer, it is just too sweet and sticky."
"Zum wohl!"
"Stuck to my mouth, giving the palate time to take in the taste and flavours, so complexed, it is hard to explain. If you have never tried it, try and find some, it is very, very good."
"Had this beer on tap at a Kloster Andechs bier stub in the Marien Platz in Munchen! Pours a dark brown molasses color with a little head and light laces around the glass. Smells of chocolate, espresso, dried fruits, and spices. Tastes of caramelized figs, prunes, spices, dark chocolate, espresso, and cooked fruit. Rich mouthfeel, feels thick and slightly chewy, but isn't overly heavy. I would like to have this beer again...I wish they sold it in the states."
"Drinkability: I sure as hell didn't have a problem drinking this one down, but I truly thought this beer was going to be like the label, (liquid) gold. Instead it was like what the label stated (only if my translation was correct), it was really an Enjoyment for body & soul. Better yet, if you go or a friend goes to pick this beer up in Germany, it's very affordable. My friend only paid 0.95 Euro for a 500 ml bottle of this beer. I'm glad I got to try this fine Doppelbock!"
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head above the clear dark amber brew. Head fades down to a layer of small bubbles, with ample slow-falling lace. Aroma is heavy caramelly malts, with strong dark fruit highlights. Taste is grain husks upfront, gradually fading into light soft bitterness. Mouthfeel is like plush velvet, and drinkability is incredible. Worth the wait. Have to facilitate drinking this again..."
"Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and the drinkability is way too good for a 7%+ beer. Watch out!"
"medium-high carbonation with a slightly syrupy feel. starts malty and caramel sweet, then finishes with a touch of bitter cherries, some sour, and some alcohol. has a bit of an odd aftertaste, but a very good beer."
"Truly a world class beer."
"Pours a deep amber to brown color with a light head over top, leaving most of the liquid bare. Clarity is perfect. Nose is excellent balance of sweet doughy bread with a toasted crust playing in the bakcground. Its all about bread and toast. There is a light raisinyness there, but faint. Flavor is very nice. Good toasty malt, light notes of brown sugar very mild raisin. Everything is in harmony here. Feel is right at the cusp of being thick, with a very light carbonation. Velvety smooth and almost chewy. An incredibly tasty beer. I would have to say this is the best dopplebock I have ever had. A treat I hope to find again at some point."
"A huge ass thanks to Kev for sharing this one!!! Half a liter bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium ruby red color with two fingers of head that die off slowly, leaving a little bit of lacing. The smell is sweet and malty. Lots of caramel going on, with a slightly toasty aroma. Just the slightest bit of alcohol. Very full. The taste is smooth and malty. Both sweet and roasty, a perfect balance. Lots of biscuit malt in there. The harmony of flavors is unreal. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick, yet smooth as silk. The drinkability is deadly for a 7.1% brew. This is awesome."
"9-26-05"
"Drinkability is unparalleled because it's not so potent that you can't have more. I had three 1/2L glasses in one sitting and I could've had even more. It's just amazing and it pairs very well with food, too. I highly recommend it with the wurst and the monastery, or the meat trio at the Am Dom hall."
"I was surprised when a homebrew club member showed up with one of these and had no idea how good it's supposed to be. Pours a brown color with a small head that falls quickly and leaves a little lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very pleasant - a lot of nutty and bready things going on with some caramel maltiness backing things up. The flavor is better than expected. Very smooth. Lots of notes of nuttiness and caramel. Hitns of fruits. The drinkability is very good as is the body. Wonderful beer here."
"I have an affinity for toasty-dry Dopplebocks that have the same malty components that is evident in this beer, but these succulent and sultry flavors and textures superscede my preconcieved notions of the Dopplebock style. This beer has many of the intangibles that separate great beers from very good beers."
"Dated best before 26 04 06. Pours out a dark brown with reddish highlights and a tall tan creamy head. The head returns quickly to the body leaving speckles of lace. Sweet caramel and dark fruit come on strong with a nice mild dark chocolate in the background. Good amount of roastiness and smoke with light bready malts. First taste is some caramel with a backing of roastiness. Lighter notes of fruit sweetness and bittersweet chocolate mix in well. Very light alcohol is noticeable with a mild earthiness at the finish. Really rich and full flavored brew that I could drink all day. Body is hefty enough to carry deliver the big flavor and goes down smoothly and easily. If only this was available in the states."
"Bham UK"
"I always have to tell myself to drink it more slowly and savor it because it's that drinkable. I feel really lucky to have brought back no less than 21 bottles (one broke in my checked bag, RIP, ruining my Rick Steves Italy book in the process. It smelled really good after the trip though.) from Germany this summer. Beermail me with a good offer if you want one of the 8 or 9 I have left."
"tastes awesome, like all the smells only in beer form. very thirst-quenching, not too strong, drinkable. I'll have another !"
"Intense bold flavour, bit of everything. Roast, whiff of smoke, some sourness, dark chocolate, molasses. Medium-full chewy mouthful. Dark chocolate colour, chocolate aroma. Creaminess and really interesting range of flavours with multi-course meal. Thanks Mr. Madsberg from Denmark."
"Finally! David said I could open up one of the bottles I brought back with me this past year. Freshness date was still good. Shared the bottle with David and Uncle Jimbo. More than cola colored, I poured a thick chewy tan head that was full of a nice Germanic pumpernickle bread. The carbonation was really nice, not too little, not too much. Full bodied, but the spot on Germanic breadiness, and smooth hoppiness make this more sessionable than other Doppelbocks I've tried. It lives up to the hype, if you are not expecting overwhelming alcohol. Would drink it again, and I can, 'cause I still have a bottle left."
"500 ml bottle, bought in Germany. ABV is 7.1%, not 7.0% like the brewery website says. Deep chestnut colour, large and creamy light tan head. Very nice roasty aroma with notes of rye bread, caramel, hints of liquorice and chocolate. Fairly dry roasty flavour (roast malts), notes of coffee, toast and rye bread. Dry and hoppy bitter finish. An excellent doppelbock, not as smooth and sweet as some others of this style."""
"This brew pours a deep copper chestnut color with amber hues and a nice offwhite head about a quarter inch thick.. In the nose there is a strong aroma of dark fruits consisting of figs and grapes with just a touch of sugar. In the background there is a slight fresh wheat tone mixed with some lucious caramels.. For flavor this beer initially starts off quite fruity with strong figs, date, and grape like flavor.. There is a smooth transition from the fruitiness to a beautiful arrangement of caramels and malts with some slight hints of spices in the mix. The finish to this beer is just absolutely wonderful with a slight sweetness and a very nice doughy bready malt backing.. At the very end there is just a slight bite from the hops but its more of a spiciness than a bitterness. This brew has a beautiful creamy mouthful with a subtle carbonation that just dances on the tongue.. As for drinkability this beer is amazing.. For all the fruitiness and sweetness up front, the nice malt backing and hop finish eases this beer off your palate readying it for the next sip... My god this beer is good.. Thank god i now live in Germany where I can happily get it!!"
"Fruit and slight nut taste up front get overran by alcohol & body, lots of body! Licorice also is there. Beautiful brown to black color. Tried this numerous times after purchasing in getranke markets and on base class-six stores. It was the perfect beer for cutting the chill on the long chilly German winter nights. All the beers from this brewery are great. Wish I could've visited the monastery..."
"A pretty enjoyable dopplebock"
"I can hardly recommend the experience at the monastery too highly, except for one thing -- get there in the morning! By late lunch time, the tour buses show up, and its SRO with long lines for beer all afternoon. Don't eat breakfast, have an early lunch at the monastery -- HUGE portions, so share! -- then sample beers for a couple of hours. Then walk around."
"Final Thought: I was so happy to taste a beer in Germany after living here for now over two months that reminds me of the great porters of America, a wonderful find and a World Class Beer!"
"This was the last beer of the evening on my second night in Germany. I was still jet lagged but that night I had the best night of sleep of any night in Europe. This beer isn't high in alcohol but with the sugars and alcohol together, this was lights out for me. I look forward to drinking this beer again when I am in Germany."
"The alcohol taste and burn were muted. This was my first German beer on this trip. I think I made a good choice. Started the trip off with a nice beer."
"Many thanks to my fiancÃ©eÂ’s parents, Marlis and Bill, who went to considerable effort to obtain this beer in Germany and hand-carry it back to me."
"Overall Impression: The taste expresses the obvious quality of this brew. ItÂ’s just masterful. It strikes me as the most roasted beer ever. I found myself craving roasted chicken while drinking this. Truly a gem; Wish we could get it down here in Texas."
"Drinkability: This is a very enjoyable beer, and could definitely keep a man warm in winter."
"I was sad to only have one of these, but many thanks to Bourre for bringing this guy over from the old world."
"	Thank for this one Horst!"
"This is what a ""beerlover"" like me loves. Best before 28-09-05. Presentation is how you want it to be for a DarkDoubleBock. Perfect, yellowish and longlasting thick head. Most beautifull darkbrown color you can get in your brew and totaly clear. Nose is mostly maltarome with lots of roast. Further sweet and yeastfruity and even some hops in background. Taste is mostly exceptional being as full as it is, burnt, sweetmalty, hoppy and having a bitterweet aftertaste! Mouthfeel is like taste; exceptional and don't know if any beer make so much contact with your tasting pupils; just every one is giving this top enjoyment tinkle. Drinkability is then off course also ok but is maybe overfeeding you. Highly recomendable!"
"A very good doppelbock."
"Poured a reddish brown color with a small thin, fluffy, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of dried fruits, sweet caramel and honey, light alcohol. Sweet chocolate, caramel, light roastiness, musty cobwebs and light alcohol as well. Creamy mouthfeel, this is a solid Doppelbock."
"16 ouncer,, with ""mindestens haltbar bis"" dating of 020305, Fresh as far as I can tell. Brought back by a neighbor from Germany. This classy brew is a treat. Rich, bold, and ultra smooth. Pours a classic, brownish dark amber, white tiny bubble head. Nose is pure rich malt. Wonderfully smooth and rich mouthfeel. Notes of dark caramel, raisins, molasas, rum, tastes like a nice sweet light chocolate brownie. Complex, smooth and satisfying. If you can find some, buy it."
"0.5L bottle from German dept store in Cologne...cost of about $2.50 US...thanks to Richard Todd for bringing it back!"
"What a treat."
"The color is a dark redish black with a strong head at first but slowly dies down. The aroma is not very noticeable but at first sip all thoughts of weakness are thrown out the window. It has a very noticeable doppelbock taste that is not as bitter as german dunkells but is not week due to this. This is definitely a beer that I will be buying more of. I guess as they say good things in life will come to you if you wait and this was no exception."
"A huge HUGE HUGE Thanks to Bierman VA for bringing me back not one but three of these Gems back form his trip to Oktoberfest.. Now given my wifes loves for Dopplebocks-- I need to lock these up somewhere!!!"
"John"
"Generous off-white head forms atop the dark brown body. Head is foamy, frothy, sticky, moderately lasting. Light ruby hints make the color seem complex. A truck of malt in the aroma. Various flavours of smoked fruits, red berries, blue berries, cherries, light smoke, light roast. Terrific integration of the aromatic components. Another sniff gave me mineralic or salty notes. Another hinted me toward bread. Yet another proposed candy sweetness almost approaching honey. If the aroma contained a truck of malt, itÂ’s 2 trucks you have when sipping. Its intensity is pushed further although always staying in the subtlety grace as opposed to a celebrator. Incredible precision, every angle is well cut. Bolder than the aroma in its leathery expression. Quite dry overall. Nut skin, roasty and earthy light hops finish. Could last a little longer perhaps. It really tastes like fresh and clean water was used. Incredible malt depth they have there. Gets even better as it warms, close to a 10 as far as taste is concerned, I guess just a bit more length would nail it. Polite medium to full body, high carbonation is at the limit of being too much. Stellar doppelbock that grows on you sips after sips. New developments and happenings every time. 2 thumbs up to Stephen and his neighbor for this unique chance!"
"This has replaced Deadguy Ale as my house beer, I can hardly believe it. This is a great after dinner beer. This should be required drinking in EVERY beer appreciation seminar."
"Note to self: 3.0 L of beer in one sitting is too much."
"The appearance is a clear, deep burgandy in color. The head was slighly beige in color which slowly dissispated into a thin lace. This brew is about malt, but in a very subtle, not obvious way. The maltiness fragrance was very noticeable on the nose. The body is full and distinctive. The taste can only be characterised as very a smooth, silky mouthfeel. The maltiness flavor dominates up front with some apparent caramel and toffee tones. The hops are present, but solely in a supporting role providing a very delightful dry finish. It has to be one of the finest doppelbock brewed on the planet Earth. I really look forward to having this brew on draft. A truly exquiste brew!!"
"Got to hand it to the monks at Andesch, for they are gentle, benevolent geniuses, and those who know their work are doubly blessed!"
"A brownish dense head disappears into a very thin color. The color is impressive: a beautiful brown-red, almost purple, opaque. The smell is of dark malts, non sweet caramel, and a warming winy grapes aspect. The taste is very enjoyable and complex. Raisins with a sweet and refreshing citric aspect (almost like the soda aspect of Belgian stouts); then dark malts, with a thick almost chewy impression of chocolate; the chocolate announces the veil of hoppiness that covers the mouth without overwhelming it. Finally, a warm alcohol feeling. Very well balanced. My favorite Doppelbock ."
"Like any true heartsick man in love, I will visit my sweet Andechs again...hopefully within the next year ( a friend is getting married in the Netherlands in March 2004...Bavaria is close enough...only a few hundred miles away...I look forward to a trip after the wedding to Brussels for the Belgians and then Bavaria for the Best of the Rest....my mouth is watering already...keep posted...is anybody really reading this??? CHEERS!).!&$@&@#$"
"On-Tap! At De Vildeman in Amsterdam, Holland. I've heard much about this brew, but when I failed to get a bottle from Germany, I decided to try this when I actually saw it on tap! I'm really glad that I did, as this is probably the best Doppelbock being made! This was dark as night, with some rusty edges of maroon and brown. The head was small, tan, and short-lived. The aromas were of fresh bavarian soft pretzels, deepl malts, and slight floral hops on the finish. The taste was extremely malty, not too sweet, and hoppy on the finish. The perfect doppel! The mouthfeel was thick, creamy, and oh-so-smooth going down, and the drinkability was excellent. This stuff is like liquid crack...amazing and highly recommended by this BA!"
"Prost"
"Thanks to TRBeer for this beauty."
"Truly a beer to be sought."
"Thanks to Tim"
"Sweet bread and chocolate ice cream hit the nose. Some syrupy caramel and molasses float beneath. Medium-full bodied. Very nicely textured -- meaty but smooth. Very, very, very sweet, malty flavor with some toffee notes. A little bitterness on the finish cleans up and balances. Eminantly drinkable. Great beer."
"I wish I could remember more about it.. But I wish I could have another one even more!"
"Originally sampled on 1 April 2003. This beer is a work of art. Nice dark brown color, w/ a tan head and a malty nose, I'll have one anytime. Typically, I'm not big on lagers, but this Doppelbock is great. Wonderful maltiness, this is simply a world class beer that any beer geek/snob needs to try."
"That is why we drink Andechs here!"
"Maybe one of the smoothest dopplebock in the world. Tastes in Munich at the Kloster-Andechs special restaurant, near St. Peter's church and close to the Marienplatz. Dark, delicious and very drinkable, the alcohol creeps up on you at the end of a couple half liters."
"A Bighuge thanks to Shit and Mrs. Shit for securing this dandy for me."

"Pretty darn good stuff. Nice little roasty caramel sort of flavour, slightly sticky, but pleasantly so, slightly sweet aswell, but well balanced, lots of flavour, decent bitter flavour."
"Note: Heavyweight used this yeast strain in Perkuno's Hammer Imperial Porter."
"What we have here is an outstanding beer...and even better if you fortunate enough to have it at Kloster Andechs. Truly a great experience. It's about 40-45 min. outside of Munich on the S-Bahn (toward Herrsching) but well worth the trip. We had a perfectly clear day to visit this gorgeous hilltop setting with visibility for miles it seemed. As majestic as the scenery was the beer, brewed here for more than 500 years. Superb doppelbock, big with malty goodness, the real deal.  The monks sacrificed little while fasting on this liquid bread."
"Probably - no, definitely - one of the best beers on earth. It is worth the trip to Munich (and S-5 train) to get here. What makes this exceptional is its' unavailabilty in the states. In fact, this beer is so good, they only serve it on weekdays to keep down the throngs of thirsty Munichers."
