"Overall: Overall, not a bad beer. I'd think it shades more into the bock category than a doppelbock, but it's tasty nonetheless."
"Its a doppelbock that tastes like a doppelbock."
"I think this beer needs to be re-classified as a bock instead of a dopplebock. I personally would have rated it much higher if that were the case."
"Review is optional why is this site not working right"
"Flavor reveals a sweet toasted malt backbone, fairly rich, with toffee notes. Fruity specialty malt notes are subtle, but add depth. Nice example of the style. It's just a touch too sweet."

"It's no wonder this won a Silver at GABF, it's really that good.  Just like all of their beers, Moerlein doesn't disappoint with this Doppelbock. Earthy, Nutty Malt backbone with a deep brown color."

"O-Overall very nice. Reminds me of celebrator. B = 86-7"

"I poured this wonderful beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. Boy wish I could get more of this one. The beer had a nice caramel taste to it. The beer was terrible looking and poured no head at all. I was going to swear it was flat until I tasted it. The beer is a little sweet but not too bad for me. This truly was a surprise find and I would certainly buy it again."

"This is by far the best offering I've had from Moerlein. They've knocked it out of the ballpark with this beer. (No pun intended? Sorry, Reds joke.) Definitely pick this up if you're into the malt-heavy styles."
"Overall: a decent doppelbock that is malt centric and easy to consume."

"Overall, a good beer with a nice flavor profile, but I think it needs some carbonation to wake up the palate. Moreover, I think it lacks the complex maltiness and chewy mouthfeel that the best dopplebocks (e.g., Ayinger Celebrator) have. Still a good beer that I'm proud to call ``local''. I'd love to try this on tap."

"O: Tasty, if you're in the mood. Better than the Spaten Optimator in my opinion."
"Dark red beer with a soapy, tan head. Wonderful, smoky floral and spice aromas with some fruit and bread notes. Flavors of creamy caramel, spice, fruit and hints of brown sugar. A very complex, very enjoyable brew with a very rich body. Definitely not a beer that can be consumed in mass quantities."
"D - Kind of simple... would get boring."

"O - I enjoyed this beer overall its well made and easy to drink with a good flavor profile worth getting sometime to try"
"Poured a deep dark russet brown with a small, maybe an inch or so of off white head grazing over the top of it. There was significant side glass lace throughout the session and the overall look of it was quite thick. The aroma was of slight smoked variety. A little bit of roasted malt with a touch of caramel to sweeten in up. The taste was remarkably smooth and delicious. Great full body on this one, definitely not thin. Nice and mellow smoky flavor with a huge earthy and bread like back. A nice caramel sugar sweet finish brought it all together. No taste of alcohol at all and overall it was a very easy drinker. I could have easily had another. The carbonation stayed very nice throughout the session"
"no doubt, this is a tasty beer. It's shy of the greats, but certainly one to try."
"T: Syrupy sweet with caramel, brown sugar, malt and rye bread. There's a little warmness as the beer goes down that leaves a nice sensation, but overall, not a fantastic doppelbock. A little too syrupy for me."
"great product from my home town of cincinnati!"
"All told, Emancipator isn't bad; I actually find it fairly enjoyable. It just seems rough around the edges. I don't know the abv, but there isn't any alcohol heat. (4.0)"
"Christian Moerlein Emancipator Doppelbock has nothing to do with trees or with Abraham Lincoln. It was brewed to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the repeal of prohibition. Although it's from great beer, that's something we can all raise a glass to."
"I liked This a lot was very sweet and refreshing would be nice on a fall night during an outside activity."
"this is a good double bock...but since i've had it...i would try a different brewers to compare."
"The flavor brings caramel & toffee with some bread dough and cracker maltiness. A healthy dose of bittering hops balances the sweetness well. Mouthfeel is crisp, yet creamy with a vigorous carbonation level that thankfully doesn't wear at the palate. All in all, Emancipator is a solid American-brewed doppel. Goes down easily, packs just the right amount of flavor, and I'm headed back to the fridge for another one right now."
"Comments: A beer of the month selection. Overall, a good example of a doppelbock, it has renewed my interest in the style."
"D: Emancipator is a very drinkable brew. Dominated by sweet malts but never cloying. Balanced just enough by some of the dark fruit notes and subtle herbal hops. At the risk of sounding too clich√©, I wish I had some wienerschnitzel with spaetzle to go along with the beer. A biergarten would be nice, too."
"Overall: Admittedly I'm not a huge fan of the style and wouldn't have bought this if it hadn't come in a beer of the month pack. I could see it being nice sitting by a wood fire or in the winter, but the sweetness is a bit much for me."
"Pours a clear brown with minimal head. The smell is pretty indistict, some sweetness and a little wheat. Mmmm, tastes much better, big sweet caramel and some banana, charged with bubbles. This one is going down real easy and I could easily down another."
"Body was on the light side with little carbonation. Finishes sweet and the flavors come out a little more as it warms up to room temperature."
"This goes down pretty easily due to the sweetness in the finish. Looking forward to another."
"A good looking selection from a recent BOTMC delivery, let's give it a whirl. Popping' the top the brew yields a cinnamon raison bagel smell. Pours to deep reddish brown with a short tan head. Taste is a nice roasted malt but with sweet molasses like notes a little bitter more than that expected for a doppel. Mouthfeel is silkly smooth excepting some fizziness perhaps too much from the carbonation. It really varies from the style, not the roasted malts but the slight bitterness, but I like this twist of roasted malts and a little hop bite. I am rating this one on pure flavor and not style conformance. This beer should be imbibed closer to room temperature to get the full flavor range."
"Poured to a pure amber. I wouldn't really describe mine as light or dark. Just pure. The head fizzed away in about 5 seconds. Didn't put a stopwatch to it but.... maybe I'm guilty with not a vigorous enough pour?? The jurys out. I'm smelling sweet dark fruits. Catching a roasty vibe in there also. Sweet sweet malty flavor. I can taste some alcohol but it seems hidden quite well. Caramel with that sip. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Full bodied. I agree with the BOTM description as ""chewy"". I would most def purhcase this beer again. Probably not one of the more sought after d-bocks but I found my 3 brews very enjoyable."
"IMO, Ayinger Celebrator Dopplebock sets the standard, but this was a very good US version that did the job well and is quite enjoyable. Easy to drink, I recommend trying this beer."
"D: A little too much chocolate/roastiness and too little body to warrant drinking many of these. Maybe doppelbocks aren't my cup of tea. But I'll still rate to style."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a clear amber with a 2 finger white head, no lacing. The aroma is very sweet, molases, dark fruit, figs. The flavor is not as sweet as the aroma, but has the same notes. It finishes with a lingering sweetness. IMO it is thin for the style. A solid beer, yes there are better doppelbocks, but this is very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is a little on the watery side. All in all makes for an average drink."
"D-This is a nice, unassuming drinker with some redeeming qualities. Doesn't compare to the top doppels. My suggestion would be to label this just a ""bock"". It's a decent beer but just not really a doppel in my eyes..."
"EDIT: A little further in, the caramel sweetness becomes a little more forward, but still not great. Bumped the flavor from a 2 to a 2.5, that's all."
"D: Somewhat strong for a session beer, but lot of flavor and characteristics would make a great replacement for a red wine in pairing it with a main course."
"D - Although not a great beer, this is a pretty good American example. Could certainly drink a couple of these."

"If I do find it fresh, I will pick up a bottle just to give it a try fresh vs. aged, we have to hope that aging was the bad choice here."
"M/D - Very clean with low volumes of carbonation so flavors stick out very nicely. It's a very easy sipper and should be served around 50 degrees so the aroma and taste opens up. Not much trace of ethyl alcohol taste but only the warming sensation towards the end."
"In my opinion, this beer is quite drinkable, because it's only down side is the aftertaste. Everything else is quite nice. And I can easily get past that. I know a little trick... keep drinking."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours an amber/ruby red color with an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. It smells like toasted malt, caramel, and some bready malt. Aroma is nice, but seems a bit weak to me. Luckily the flavor is stronger than the aroma is. It tastes like bready malt and caramel, along with some toffee and prunes/figs. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it could be better. Overall I think it's a decent enough brew, however if I was in the mood for a dopplebock this wouldn't be close to being my first choice. With that being said, it's not a bad brew at all."
"D: A so- so beer. Not impressed in general with this brewery or this beer. Decent, but not really memorable..."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is smooth and a little flat. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is light. Okay, this beer lacks some serious flavors it is bland and uninteresting."
"D: this is a great beer, As far as bocks go I'll be revisiting this one."
"Drinkability: High. This is really a solid beer that doesn't overwhelm, just does the trick. A very manageable ABV and a very refereshing beer to enjoy after a very long day of work while watching a Reds game. I wish I would have bought more of this."
"D: I got two of these from my neighbor after sharing some Kentucky Breakfast Stout with him. I'm glad I have another since I look forward to having this one again. I would say it's highly drinkable."
"D- Very easy to drink and would be a great addition to a winter/fall lineup."
"Drinks easy for the style & ABV, not as much guts as I hoped, but still a darn good effort from a brewery I haven't had in a while...Would buy again & tell my self I'm drinking a Bock...."
"The mouthfeel is sticky but smooth going down. I wouldn't have a problem drinking a six pack of this but I probably wouldn't go out and buy one."

"Bottle from Party Source. Not sure if this is similar to the original Christian Moerlein Doppelbock as I never tried that one. This beer pours a mostly clear dark mahogany color with a medium and frothy beige head that diminishes slowly. Patches of lacing on the glass. Toasted malt, caramel and hops in the nose. Medium-bodied and smooth with sweet malt, caramel and hops flavors along with a touch of chocolate. The finish is moderately sweet with notes of burnt malt and hops lingering. Pretty enjoyable from start to finish."
"Drinkability: Hell yes, have 'em all day long. This is one of my favorite doppelbocks, if not my favorite. Is there another doppelbock that can come along and de-throne the EMANCIPATOR????"
"Interesting and certainly a good example of a Doppelbock. This is actually better than I expected and once it starts to warm up a bit, from its initial serving temperature of 50¬∞F / 10¬∞C, the body starts to get a bit more rich and has a fullness which helps carry the rich malt flavors."
"This is not bad, but I wonder about the freshness of the sample."
"Well, so far, I've been pretty impressed with what Christian Moerlein is brewing and I'm kind of surprised that there aren't more reviews for their beers. People, you're missing out on some good stuff."
"Notes: An extra from moose3285 - thanks Mike! Very enjoyable stuff."
"D : Pretty good doppelbock. Better than I was expecting."
"Overall, this was a good doppelbock, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy it."
"Notes from '08 NHC."
"Almost medium body, with ample carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. Nice."
"D - This is a great dopplebock. Not quite up to Celebrator standards but among the best I've had. I tend not to be as big a fan of most lagers, but this fits the standards well and, were it not a limited local to Cincinnati brew, could be a regular rotation for me."
"Pours a translucent brown in color that has ruby highlights around the edges. A head forms on the pour, but quickly is gone. Smell is all malt and toffee. Taste is much the same, but I'm getting a nutty, almond like flavor that I'm liking. Good, solid offering from CM. Well done."
"Danke pimpp"
"Bells and Victory have since restored my faith in this style."
"A really well balanced brew. Not too heavy and nowhere near being light. I will certainly have this while it's around (especially since it's in walking distance of the office)."
"Drinkability - very tasty. I really am impressed with what CM has put out in the past 12 months, this is a finely crafted brew. I need a blind head-to-head against some of the better rated DB's to see how it fares against its peers."
"edit: Let it be known that I've not eaten at all today, I've been up about 14 hours and I'm on my second glass of this, I am not really all that hungry, by the time this glass is done I will prolly be full. The bros are right when they say that this style is a meal in and of itslef."
"D: Very good and I'm so thrilled that Christian Moerlein is putting out great beers like this. I can't wait until they move the brewery back to Cincinnati and put a brewpub in the Historic OTR brewery district. I think this brew would go great with a strong tiramisu."
"Final Thought: Wow, I've had their doppelbock before, but this emancipator ""brand"" feels like the high-end model of their original beer... outstanding!"
