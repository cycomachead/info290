"great color. Nil scent. Farty taste. Smooth feel. Not terrible overall."

"Boston Beer Summit. From a 16oz. can. Poured a dark caramel color. Smelled of dark fruits and yeast scents. Caramel. Flavor was more of the same. It's combination of yeast, caramel and fruit with an almost spicy flavor is pleasant. Would like to take in a whole can. Fuller, thicker bodied. Not enough of this style in the market so I welcome Doppelbocks whenever I can get them."

"An outstanding winter warmer that'd I recommend."

"O: Even for the style this seems a little under attenuated. It comes off a little too sweet and syrupy. A decent stab at the style, but nothing I'd revisit."

"Went to the brewery and tried this beer. Light in color and weak in smell. Color a little towards the red side. But the taste was very good. Beer from the tap always tastes much better. I also had the chilli stout which was great. The brew pub had good food and the city had a great port city feel."

"O: Ok, so its probably not fair to this beer, cause I think its more the style in general than this one in particular. I just cant drink doppelbocks. Something about them just makes me physically ill. This is only the second drainpour of my life."
"O - Hits the malt notes but seems to lack some complexity."
"OVERALL: Very much a traditional bock made in America with a strong German influence. Fits the bill for a solid dopplebock."
"O - This is very solid and I would try it again. I'm drinking it on a 90 degree day, but I'd rather have this brew on a fall day for some reason. Overall, very solid"
""
"Taste is mild bitter malts, some dried fruit and a bit sweet. Nice balance but a little mild in flavors. It hides the abv very well, and its easy to drink. Overall, nice brew but not my fav dopplebock."
""
""
"Overall smell is good and appearance is usually everything but taste is all that matters to me and this beer is way too lager like and not enough Doppelbock. Not bad for a free old beer though."
"Overall - Not a bad beer, very malty and carbonated. Itâ€™s a nice warming winter ale."
""
""
"O: not a bad brew and its a fair representation of a dopplebock. Would like some more aroma involved and perhaps a bit more body."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy, amber-copper coloring with a low profile, dense, foamy off-white head. Aromas are rich and malty, with a burnt toffee backbone and some roasted coffee highlights. Smells rich and complex. Thankfully it tastes rich and complex, as well. Roasty and smooth, there are some nutty sweet overtones blending with the toffee and biscuit profiles, which all lends itself to the overall layers throughout the brew. Smooth and bold in mouth on a mid-body feel, the beer leaves a fantastic lacing along the glass. The aftertaste is a hint of the tangy sweetness and roasted flavors, leading to a slightly lingering, smooth finish. Good brew."
"Poured deep copper orange with a thin white non-lasting head. Aroma of sweet malts and a touch of fruityness and citrus. You can percieve the alchohol in this and it has a bit too much bite to it, but not bad overall. The aftertaste lingers fairly too long on the back of the palate!"
"Fisherman's Navigator pours a very dark almost black color, but is translucent, there was a small white head. There is a nice malty, doughy smell. The taste is malty, and nothing to different from a typical doppel bock. It appears a bit lighter then other doppelbocks, but very easy to drink. Overall nothing to special, but still a good enjoyable doppel bock."

"This beer pours a clear, bold, reddish-orange with a thin head and lasting lace. It's aroma is of spice and molasses with a hint of citrus. The flavor has notes of molasses and vanilla. Malt sweetness if followed by a hop snap and a mild alcohol finish. It has a medium mouthfeel and is well balanced. Cape Anne Fishermans Navigator is a decent beer, a good partneer for Wiener Schnitzel and Sauerkraut. Recommended."
"The body is a bit on the light side for the style, but is very gulpable!"
"D-drinkability is good, it is on the heavy side as it should be, a nice take on the style"
"D: pretty solid beer, not sure if the bottles make it down around here but I'll keep my eyes open. At the bar I'd be more inclined to try a new beer rather than get this one again."
"Drinkability: A very good representation of the style. this is the best non-pumpkin beer from the brewery. A super malty treat that I could have a couple of over time."
"Drinkable, sure. But a lame double bock."
"D- This brew fits the bill for dopplebock-but its a pretty mediocre one-and an above average brew overall. The alcohol isnt powerful in this brew-it just stands out because there isnt much flavor there. Still cool to try this local."
"You can actually detect a little alcohol in the aftertaste...surprising for the ABV. That being said, this is still pretty drinkable. Not a bad offering..."
"This beer pours a nice dark reddish brown color with just a touch of haziness to it and a nice off white head that recedes slowly with no lacing left. Smells a bit faint, like dark cherries, molasses, a touch of burnt wood and some medicinal herbal aromas. Taste is a bit off for me as i feel the alcohol burn on this one. off balanced with astrigenty bitterness that overseas the malts. leaves a very dry, bitter, austere flavor of old cough syrup. Mouthfeel is weird becuase its got a tingly thing going on with the carbonation. rolls off the tongue well but leaves a bitter dry feeling on the palate. Drinkability is low becuase it just doesnt taste good. really off putting and nothing i would think would represent the style well. Interesting enough to try once, but wouldnt get this again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark reddish brown with a thin bubbly head. Aroma was sweet and malty with a small touch of peppery spice. Taste was clean, kind of life a white bread that had been covered with a peppery spice rub. Felt outstanding in the mouth. Coated very well, not to thin, and a touch of carbonation. Overall, very pleasant to drink."
"poured a clear dark brown color with a toasted almond head that sticks well. nice bready, caramel malt aroma. flavor is pretty close to style, with a good showing of bready malts and a good dose of caramel. aftertaste is a bit on the sweet side to warrant a great drinkability rating, but i love a good bock so i enjoyed these thoroughly."
"D--Good for winters up here in Maine. I like the nuttiness, but its just a bit sweet. Overall, its a pretty solid beer."
"D: Overall, I really liked this brew. Especially for a cold New England winter day, where I could definitely enjoy some of these."
"Overall: Overall, it was a decent beer. If you like fruity/nutty beers than this is one you might like. Personally, I found it too fruity but one or two can be enjoyable."
"F: FInishes sweet still, with more toasty malts and lots of brown sugar, molasses and syrup lingering. Not as sticky as I thought it would be. A slight roasty porter flavor on the finish too. Hints of bitter spicy earthy hops too."
"I hate to say it, but I did not like this beer. The taste was not good to me, it has a smokey taste to it that's very strong and ruins the taste of the beer for me. I don't think it has anything to do with quality, it is just the brew and ingredients in the beer, don't appeal to me. That being said, someone else may like it. I've had red ales that I have liked....this one did not do it for me."
"Picked up a six pack for $6.99 at Macy's in WR for last Friday night. Poured into a standard pint glass. Light brown color with a clear body. Noticeable carbonation. Some lacing. Smell was not as pronounced as other doppelbocks I have tried. Taste was good overall though. Some dried fruit notes with a hint of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel was smooth but not as thick as I was expecting from this style of beer. While its smoothness aided in the drinkability, it let me down a bit, as I was looking for a heartier beer for the evening. The abv is well hidden. Navigator is a dopplebock for those looking to drink a few in one session."
"Interesting flavor that matches the chocolate covered caramel. Some of the darker malts do come through. Slightly sweet with a light hop background. Rich body and below average carbonation."
"Would I buy more of it? - yes, especially if I see it in tap somewhere."
"Notes: The flavor and the color stand out among everything else. It's a decent dopplebock that is rather drinkable. Cheers."
"Poured into a standard pint. Clear mahogany color with a nice thick head to start but slowly changes to a thin film with good lacing. A sweet roasted malt aroma. Strong caramel flavor with that great double bock flavor. I enjoyed this brew and the place I purchased it at was sold out when I went back there. Cape Anne is putting out some good stuff."
"Nice looking brown/red color with a sliver of head that dies out quickly. Smell is heavy on the caramel malts, however for a dopplebock it doesn't really seem to have the punch that I would expect. The taste follows suit. A pretty tasty malt profile, but too watery to really get excited about. This is definitely a good beer to have with a meal, but not something that I really would be interested to drink again on its own. Medium/full bodied. Not bad I guess. Actually it reminds me more of a nice English Brown Ale, and if it was classified as such then I would possibly give it a higher score."
"D: very satisfying; could drink 2 or 3 happily"
"Pours a deep rich amber though the head is almost nonexistent and gone quickly. A nice nose with prominant Dark fruit, and tobacco. The taste dlivers figgy and strong without alotof alcohol to warn of the strength. It feels heavy of the toungue a little too sugary and thick to drink alnight but you could do alot worse."
"This beer pours a nice clear, deep amber color with about a 1/4 inch of offwhite/tannish head to it. Head recedes quickly, barely a film left to it, spotty lacing left on the glass. Nose is of caramel malts, toasted malts, some dark fruits and a touch of hops. Taste is of caramel malts up front, with dark fruits moving in to the backgrous - raisins and dates mostly. The finish is a hop presence that evens this beer out. Medium body, moderate to light carbonation, goes down smooth with a dry finish. This is a nice offering from Cape Ann and certainly one you could sit with for a night."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's not a style that I usually drink nor is it a brewery that I usually like but this is a good beer to drink for a while."
"D: The ABV is hidden pretty well, but this one will sneak up on you... Not a session beer. The overall affect is very warming so one of these on a cool night will hit the spot. I have not had a lot of this style of beer, so I'm new too it... This one was very enjoyable."
"D - The body and sweetness make this a great beer. I would order a pint or two of this in the cooler months."
"Taste is similar to the smell in that the controlling flavor is caramel malt, good carbonation level, nothing too overwhelming and unfortunately for this beer, nothing too special. A fairly run of the mill doppelbock and if I didn't know any better, I'd almost classify this as a regular bock because there's none of that wow factor with flavors or alcohol strength that other doppelbocks come with, although I guess it is good that the 7.5% is well-hidden."
"In my pilsner glass this beer was a cherry amber color with a medium-sized white head. It had a sweet, fruity aroma. It had a caramel malt taste, a lot of fruit. It was a little on the bland side. I thought it was too sweet and on the thin side. I've had better doppelbocks."
"Drinkability: if you are inthe mood for a malty and sweeter beer this will hit the spot. Definitely worth a try if you see it on the store shelf."
"The taste is quite sweet, a bit syrupy and a touch cloying. The sweetness has a touch of brown sugar, sweet caramels, some fig or raisin, and then there are some rust like tastes. This get sweeter and less rusty as the beer settles and warms. I never found the bocks to be overly complex and this one is no exception. The beers don't have much carbonation and remind me too much of flat cola syrup with a bit of a hop bite in the finish to let you know you're not drinking a non carbonated beverage."
"Pours rustic amber, almost rust-brown with little fanfare. Smells strongly yeasty and sweet, with an almost citrusy smell. Slight sweetness throughout, an interesting hop punch at the end. No malt punch, no taste of dark fruits or anything like that. It has something undescribeable about it, it almost taste rusty (not literally rusty, but like a little dingy). Finishes dry and toasty (toast like bread). Seems to have a metallic aftertaste. Low on carbonation, seems fairly light in body for the style. Lacks creaminess, doesn't really flow well. Overall, a hearty meh. There are so many better examples of the style. This one doesn't actively offend, but the metallic taste seems to come out more and more as it goes on. That's the big offender here."
"Pours a clear pretty dark brown with a thin eggshell creme head. Nose is a toasty malted thing. Flavor is a bit cloying on the sweet side. Beyond that there is a thick malt presence. As times goes on (and the drinking does too), the sweetness becomes less intense and more smooth. Though the malty sweetness does remain. Feel is thicker, slick, and smooth on liquid. Carbonation is lower and appropriate. Pretty easy to drink and overall not too shabby. It's a difficult style to pull off."
"Notes: Not a bad bock and not bad overall,yet I got the feeling the metallic tone would hurt the rating and it did."
"It's weird that outside of the North Shore of Boston, you don't find much of the Cape Ann Brewery's offerings in pubs around. It's more bizarre to find a few of their beers then in Brooklyn. Oh well, I suppose it gives more 'cred' to the skinny-jeaned beard posses....Regardless, I was happy to find & indulge. A nice shimmering pour of dark brown-honey sat with a short head but some good white lacing. The aroma was good & malty, almost a caramel spread on toasted wheat bread with raisins. The flavor continued this, but added a strange almost garden soil & pepper taste, which added some girth, but odd nonetheless. Dry hops finished the taste off. A strange but appealing dark lager; I wouldn't quite call it a doppel bock though."
"Drinkability: It's not exactly the most graceful, adroit dopplebock on the dopple block. The slightly astringent graininess in the latter half mars the overall experience."
"It's a dry interpretation. Maltiness is there, but subdued. Not ""bad"" but not a big fan of this one - not really what I look for in the style."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern. Poured brown with a light tan head. This beer was a little light for a doppel, certainly a bit more attenuated than imports I'm used to. The aroma and flavor, however, have a pleasant vanilla character with plums and sugar candy. This is still a well-made dark lager, just not a true-to-style doppelbock. I say it's worth a try, I enjoyed it."
"D, notes: A nice, big rich dopplebock. Missing some light ester highlights that probably would have improved the beer. For a bigger alcohol beer very drinkable."
"Pours a clear but dark ruby red with a small head and slow moving carbonation. Aromas are very subtle: sweet caramel and a some phenols. Taste is cloying but bearable: some spiciness and dark fruits at least make the powerful sweetness interesting. Not a bad beer but far from my favorite of the style."
"I can't find much to say about this one. It's on the sweeter side of Doppelbocks, and the alcohol is well hidden. It seems like this is closer to a darker Bock than a Doppelbock. Worth a try."
"Not bad! a great example of a dopplebock, with a bit of the smoky and woody notes that don't always come forth in dopplebocks. I could see drinking a few of those before growing tired. Not one I would regularly drink or necessarily seek out, but definitely a solid offering and a great example of the style. Worth drinking a bottle or two if you have the opportunity."
"Hard to knock more than one down. Good rep of the style, but 1 was enough for the night. A 6 would take a while for me to get through. Very decent beer, though, if you like the style."
"(D) Without an acquired taste for ""Bocks", this brew becomes a sipping beer."
"Very drinkable. The 7.5% is completely hidden.. This one could sneak up on you..."
"A clean dark amber beer. Has a small fizzy beige head that disappears quickly. There is a solid sweet nutlike malt backbone in the aroma with hints of spices around the edges. Great toffee malt notes rush over your tongue with hints of vanilla dancing on the sides. A quick glimpse of hops on the finish but the malty character takes over again with coffee and spice notes."
"I look forward to more offerings from this fine brewery."
"In summary, a highly drinkable product. I'll pick up another 6-pack if I come across it again in my travels."
"Overall- Syrupy sweet and cloying. Good for 1 pint."
"single from Norm's in Vienna, VA"
"This is my 5th doppelbock to date. Considering the other four where (Celebrator, Liberator, Instigator, and Sam Adams) I feel this stacks up pretty well for the style. Not as sweet as Sam Adams and not quite as good as Liberator or Celebrator, but I feel it is at least equal to that of the Instigator"
"D- A good attempt at a doppelbock, worth investigating."
"Overall a nice, smooth dopplebock. A pleasant spiciness as well."
"Pours an amber brown color, with an impressive, creamy head. Good head retention to this beer, and it had good lacing. On the nose one gets a complex aroma of malt, ginger, and citrus/bitterness from the hops. On the palate, one gets a roasty, malt flavor initially, but it finishes with a touch of dry bitterness. There is some cherry and melon flavors, but not all that much. Frankly, I could wish this beer had a bit more too it. It was interesting to try and was not like any doppelbock I've had prevoiusly. Ultimately, I thought this was an OK beer, though nothing special."
"I think that as an after-dinner beer shared with friends, or maybe as a fireplace-with-a-book sipper, it's really nice. But the drinkability just can't pull through for a full pint with so much spice in it. And the 22 oz bottle doesn't help - I wonder if it's put into 12 ouncers? Overall, it's an interesting spiced lager that's probably worth trying."
"A decent attempt...by no means a drain pour. Just not something I'll pick up again...even at $3.95 a bomber."
"unfortunately, this beer is a drain pour. some bright points.. but not enough to be able to drink a bomber by myself. a severe disappointment."
"Pours a cloudy copper with a decent head and good lacing. Smell is sweet malts, sugars and plums? Sweet maltiness continues in the taste, with a clean hop not on the finish...alcohol undertones. Medium mouthfeel, with just a tad of cloying. Smooth overall in the drinkability area...nice dry finish."
"Pours a two finger light brown head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a little lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nutty nose. Starts malty but not very sweet, hops are there, finish has a bite. Not as sweet as the usual dopple bock. Alcohol isn't noticeable. $5.20 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"D - easy to polish off. Very drinkable brew. A little lighter than I would've thought for a doppel bock but definitely a treat."
"This is a good full flavored beer that's more balanced than other winter seasonal brews."
"Overall a pretty drinkable brew with no hint of alcohol anywhere. I wish it had a little more body and maybe some darker malt base but other than that I liked it!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" beige head over the cloudy copper brew. Head lasts nicely, with average to good bubbly lacing. Aroma is fruity malts, with a whiff of alcohol mixed in. Taste is surprising robust grains upfront, light fruitiness in the middle, and a slightly bitter close, with subtle warming. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both nice, very approachable for the style. Could be a nice crossover into the style."
"M & D: Very good mouthfeel being well balanced. A tad on the heavy side, but not overpowering and to my liking. Carbonation is medium to low, but thats a good thing as it doesn't take away from the spicy malt flavor. Drinkablity on this is pretty high depending on your love or dislike of dopplebocks and malt. I would have another bomber if it was in front of me. Good work by Cape Ann--keep em' comin'!"
"All around this was very drinkable. My first pucker at the fruitiness made think it was going to be a battle to get through, but after warming up to it, I seriously enjoyed the hell out of this beer. I recommend the draught version at the SG&T as IÂ’ve yet to try a bottle."
"This is really a great beer that easily holds it's own against the other big 22oz bombers on the shelf next to it. The fact that they're doing a big lager is even more impressive. Cape Ann has found a real winner here. It's a shame this beer isn't more prevalent."
