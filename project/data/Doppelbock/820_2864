Smells mostly of Drambuie: honey, caramelized sugar, malt syrup, rummy booze and a touch of indistinct herbs and spices. Tastes pretty much as it smells, but with a weird, earthy sherry-like quality and a hint of something like licorice or black cardamom that reminds me of a Chinese apothecary. All of this might be nice in a beer with more body and depth, but this feels shallow, emaciated, and weirdly sour. Not like lambic sour, more like raw bread dough sour.

The bottles are not dated and I have found this beer to taste very differently depending on how old it is. I have had this beer off the tap in Munich so I have some vague idea of how it is fresh. As the beer ages some of the sweet and bready notes vanish and the hops become more and more prominent. This means that what at once a fairly rich beer full bodied beer becomes a drier thinner and inferior version of itself.","bgkeeley","Jul 21, 2013"

Lovely nose, big dark fruit notes, especially prunes, raisins, dates and dried cherries. Ludicrous that this should emanate from a lager! Vivid and luscious, recalling licorice and See's candies along with dried fruit. The flavor departs a bit from the fruitiness to showcase creamy caramel and molasses, but there's still a significant unripe raisin note. There's a slight metallic tinge as well, but it's not nearly as prominent as in some lesser doppelbocks and the subtlety actually works okay with the other flavors. I don't get any alcohol on the palate at all, which is great. It's obviously there but the only evidence is a slight warmth, a slight oiliness, and a slight buzz. Finishes dry for a chewy beer (much appreciated). This is honestly up there with Celebrator. I can't believe how good this is. Bravo.","illidurit","May 19, 2011"

A basic brew but a good one; has a medium body that goes down smooth and has a chocolatey taste along with some caramel and syrupiness (beer is slightly sticky). A slight fruit taste along with some hop bitterness that gives off a slightly dry finish. A quality dopplebock that hides the ABv well and is an enjoyable drink.","clayrock81","Sep 28, 2009"

Very sweet. Taste is also sweet, with many of the same, almost cane-syrup-like characteristics, but also a distinct, slightly chocolaty roasted malt taste that makes it more pleasant.

3.69,-5.9,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Good thickness and retention to the creamy brown head, eventually settles into a thin layer across the surface, the lacing doesn't stick. Fairly clear brown liquid with equal red and orange influences, few bubbles to be seen. The nose comes up with suitable doses of caramel, milk chocolate, raisin, apricot and bing cherry fruit, there's a smoky touch along with peat moss, forest floor matter and dried oranges, the bread notes are dense like pumpernickel, little airiness. Medium-bodied, nowhere near as sweet as one might have expected, has a mineral water sort of freshness and p√©tillance, not really carbonated in the strong sense. As a result it does not have density and flows by at a pace detrimental to the flavors soaking in. Soda bread, raisin bread, rye and grains elevate here, the caramel, creamed coffee and butterscotch components fade off. The cherry, apricot, peach fruit finds some traction in the mid-palate. Warming doesn't seem to help flavor expressivity. As it ends the stage mostly held by the herbaceous earthiness. Not sure what the goal was here.","farrago","Sep 13, 2009"

Overall this was a good, solid doppelbock. It wasn't quite as rich as the top doppelbocks I've tried, but it still had a nice clean flavor with good body.

Lacing is thin and sparse but nonetheless an appetizing brew for sure. Aromatics contain big ripe layers of raisin, green apples, and plums with a touch of sour acidic wild brew action and maybe a smidget of cocoa powder. Flavor is toothache sweet almost like liquified green apples and raisins sits a bit heavy on the tartness and sweetness together. The strange tartness and unique yeast flavors don't really work in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied and is basically a meal compared to most lagers out there, sweet throughout the session does weigh in a bit cloying with absolutely no balancing act going down. Carbonation is pretty mellow but overall it's tough to stomach, overall drinkability is weak but it's a less alcholic version than Salvator or Celebrator both of those kick this versions ass.","WVbeergeek","Mar 06, 2009"

3.9,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"It has a moderately full and creamy mouthfeel, some fizz and decent body. A nice doppelbock, not too deep or profound.","horndecker","Jun 27, 2005"

3.8,-3.1,4,4,4,4,3,"This has great potential as a dessert beer, or as a way to introduce new Beer Advocates to better styles. It got me on the road to better beer because it was very approachable, without a great deal of hop bitterness that might have turned me off at that point. But now, even having tried and enjoyed hoppier beers, I must say that this one still impresses me.","bceaglejoe","Apr 26, 2005"
3.94,0.5,3,4,4,4,4,"This beer is the color of Pepsi, there is a tiny glaze of a head and a ring around the edge that just can't quite form lacing. There is a strong smell of sweet yeasty bread dough. There is also a wine like scent with a hint of prunes or rasins. The taste is similar to the smells above. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and appealing. Drinkability is good.","bigbubba","Apr 23, 2005"
4.35,11,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From notes. This beer poured a ambered brown color with a small ring of head over top. The nose was fig with a slight nutty and bready quality. The flavor was big, with a nice fig and bready. The feel was moderate with a nice active carbonation. Overall, the beer was well balanced. I liked the flavor and and feel. I'd try it again.","kmpitz2","Apr 05, 2005"
4.3,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours into the glass with a decent light tan head over very lightly hazy dark maroon liquid tinged with brown. Sweet malty nose with some chocolate and slight raisin aromas, very good smelling. Soft and smooth malty mouthfeel with great sweet maltiness with light underlying roastiness and sufficient hop bitterness. Some alcohol felt in the back of the throat after swallowing. Finishes nicely bittersweet with a malt and alcohol kick. Very tasty and drinkable. Haven't seen this around my area in at least 17 years, welcome back I say!","beerluvr","Apr 04, 2005"

Sweet maltynose, this is a strong, bold, flavorful German classic. Lots of chocolate, alcohol, and malty sweetness. Fine brew for a nightcapper.","Billolick","Mar 05, 2005"

4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a tawny brown color with a huge tan head. Aromas of rum-raisin, pumpernickel bread, brandy, slight cardboardiness and light hopping. The taste envelops a plumminess that accompanies the dark roasted malts very well. Hopping is fairly low, aside from a faint vegetal astringency in the finish. Slight notes of chocolate and miniscule nuances of anise. A little sweet, but not outlandishly so, it's balanced very well. A very nice doppelbock that's recommended.","crookedhalo","Feb 04, 2005"
3.88,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A very nice, well made Doppelbock. Probably moves into my top 5. Enjoyed at the Brickskeller in DC. Pours a ruby-brown with a nice head and orangish lacing. Aroma is sweet, malty. Taste is quite rich, malty, pleasantly sweet with hints of dried fruits/raisins, maybe a touch of brown sugar and a roasty, bitter finish. I would say that this would be an excellent "everyday" doppelbock since it has a little of everything. Just a very well made, solid beer. The malty richness may limit the number of these you could drink in one sitting, but I'm a malt head so I still give it high marks for drinkability.","ChrisBowers","Jan 25, 2005"
4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Deep ruby brown body wears minimal head, but displays a nice little haze. Its aroma is rich and bold, claiming for the big leagues in the doppelbock community. Moderately complex flavor suburb ranges from the floral almond skin to the woody and almost cheesy sweet fruits. You bite into that honeymelon only to uncover a grape branch and vinous berries. Upon tasting, I once again am taken aback by more unexpected character showing up in the form of a earthy and roasty bitter finish, though I pass through the fruit and nut appetizer at first. Soft carbonation accompanies the medium body. The global experience remains constructive, more warming toward the end, but as interesting in its unveiling mysteries form the beginning. Interestingly multilayered in its boldness.","Rastacouere","Jan 22, 2005"

3.17,-19.1,2.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Overall: Not doing a whole lot to recommend itself to me. Maybe I'm spoiled because I'm currently working my way through a case of Celebrator, but as a doppelbock this brew was somewhat disappointing for me. The taste is pretty average, and it doesn't look or smell particularly great. There's so many great alternatives in the style that I can never see myself wanting this one again.","whartontallboy","Jan 12, 2005"

4.04,3.1,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"All told, this seems like a realized bock. It's a bit thinnish in structure, and a bit tame in overall flavor to be hailed as a dopplebock. But as such, it is tremendously drinkable and enjoyable just the same..","cokes","Sep 02, 2004"

4.64,18.4,4,5,4.5,4,5,"Drinkability: Most doppelbocks have a very "in your face" flavor profile. This doppel is subtle. It whispers where other doppels scream. An outstandingly well-designed beer.","Afterburner","May 16, 2004"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"There's a lot of mouthfeel going on in this beer - a rich, syrupy texture and lots of carbonation (along with the toffee/caramel malt flavors) make it a tasty brew.","jahred","May 04, 2004"

4.39,12,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5," A fine doppelbock, with complex layers of malty flavors, dominated by the molasses taste that seems to be the bechmark of a first class doppelbock. Certainly, this is one I will try again soon, and it would be fun to taste this one alongside a Celebrator, or Salvator.","merlin48","Mar 27, 2004"
4.23,7.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark ruby colour with a minimal khaki head that doesnt last to long. Smell is of rich roasted malts. This is gonna be a meal in a glass. Taste echos the smell. Dark Breads, dried fruits, a hint of cigar tobacco, and more malt on top.. enough hops to keep it in line, but none to speak of. Mouthfeel is lighter than i would have thought. The alcohol is well hidden but still there. This beer would go great with roast duck with some red cabbage.. YUmmm .. This beer and Celebrator are the cream of the Dopplebock crop to me.","TinusTime","Mar 11, 2004"
3.65,-6.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,3,"The aroma is of pungent malt and a bit of caramel. Poured a dark coco colored head that faded quickly to a film. Dark brown in color with slight amber hue. The flavor is nice, creamy malt, fresh caramel, and some raisins. Creamy, moderately thick body, caramel in the finish fades slowly. This reminds me of why I like doppelbocks.","HappyHourHero","Mar 04, 2004"
3.18,-18.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Clearly a doppelbock, although the bottle only gives the cryptic identification of "dark beer." Pours a ruddy brown with some sediment evident throughout the pour. Nomimal head, and carbonation was fairly reserved. Aroma was sweet caramel and prune juice. Body was substantial and a bit syrupy. Flavor was quite sweet, with caramel, toffee, molasses and dominating prune flavors. Alchohol was noteworthy in the background, with some black pepper. Overall, the beer was just too heavy-handed, even for the style. Although there was nothing in particular about the beer that was bad, the overall effect was that I found myself trudging through it, and not enjoying it all that much. I suppose this one should be chalked up to personal taste rather than beer quality.","Brent","Feb 10, 2004"
4.04,3.1,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This was a very nice doppelbock. It was a dark ruby/purple colour with a small and quickly dissipating head of white foam. The aromas were of coffee, plum brandy, port wine, alcohol, deep roasted malts, and slight German hops. The taste was of chocolate, caramel, port wine, alcohol, malts, and hops. The mouthfeel was thick to medium bodied and totally acceptable for this style of beer and the drinkability was great for a doppelbock!","francisweizen","Dec 15, 2003"
3.97,1.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A deep purplish brown color, this beer began with lots of carbonation but showed little of anything through the session. Smelled chocolatey with a big pock-textured malt that was grainy, sweet, and nascently bready. Also tasted chocolatey, accompanied by a winey malt and scruffy wood notes and tart snaps. Almost syrupy smooth, this is a complex beer, though the finish could be less hectic and sloppy. Warming immediately, filling, drinkable, and pretty cheap for an import. A good pick.","nomad","Dec 15, 2003"
4.12,5.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Very little head, but nice lacing...dark chocolate appearance. Rich smell that was sweet, with a hint of spice and some alcohol presence.

4.13,5.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"The flavor is very full of malt and pungent fruitiness. The feel is full and tends towards a syrupy sense because of the thick fullness. Limited drinkability due to the ABV and heavy body feel.","AtLagerHeads","Oct 27, 2003"
3.95,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The head on this beer is nonexistent. Aroma is lacking as well. In the aroma are roasted and chocolate notes, but not the expected raisin and malt. The flavor is roasted and chocolate and then the sweetness fades into a dry chocolate finish. It does go down smooth and have a good drinkability. I like the beer, but cannot review it highly as a dopplebock.","GCBrewingCo","Oct 27, 2003"
4.08,4.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"On first appearance, a nice looking brew, dark and rich looking, with a nice tan head and lace. It had sort of that burnt malt aroma, but not overpowering. A wonderfully complex beer, with dark malt flavors as well as a smoke-like taste. Easy to drink for such a strong beer. Not too filling either- perfect for fall.","AaronRed","Oct 05, 2003"

4.02,2.6,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Flavor is powerfully malty, with a strong roastiness. A bit of sweet chocolate and molasses, with hints of dates, fig, and green raisin. No apparent alcohol.

4.04,3.1,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours amber brown. Head is there during the pour, but is eliminated immediately. Very bubbly brew in the glass. Strong tantalizing aroma of powerful sugary malt and dark fruit, particularly plums. Mouthfeel is a little thin...I expected a chewier, breadier doppel. Could use a thicker body. Taste is wonderful and complex enough. Highly malty and balanced well with a caramel sweetness. Only a slight hint of alcohol. Not the best, but certainly a winner.","IrishRedRock","Jul 09, 2003"
4.17,6.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A very nice Doppel, but falls short of the greats like Celebrator. Big malts provide a caramel flavor without too much sweetness, a bit bready with a balanced bitterness.

3.99,1.8,5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This brew poured a medium head of finely sized light brown bubbles and asemi-opaque dark brown body.

4.2,7.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I found Maximator to have a profile similar to Salvator, but the rye flavors were richer and the liquorice sweetness was much more noticeable. Much flatter as well.

4.6,17.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"So smooth and chocolatey from vom Fass at the brewery/restaurant itself. Alcohol has to be about 8% ABV.

A flavor of malt, hops and caramel. I found it to be fairly creamy and easy to drink. It wasn't bitter as some darker beers often are, and I found it to be one of the few dark beers outside of the British Isles that impressed me. May not be in the top tier, but definately worth checking out as one of the German beers.","Wildman","May 22, 2002"
