review_text
"A richly flavorful and well balanced example of an American doppelbock. This is a style of beer that I’d like to see more of in this country. Penn pretty much nailed it. Thanks again, Ozzylizard!"

"Outstanding, surprised me, better that I expected from Penn"
""
"overall-  I rated this high because it is better imo than any other Christmas beer I had this year. It slightly beats out Ayinger and is heads and tails above Spaten the other usual suspects"
"2013 release. Malts have come more forward with cellaring."

"whoa baby! my first beer from these guys (if i remember right), is enormously delicious. a christmas beer without spice, i love it. this is a classic dopplebock type lager, cold fermented, patient, and clean as they get in the finish for a beer that begins this sweet. dark brown, with a grayish black tint in color, heady and alive, foamy and frothy, almost soapy looking head, it doesnt fade either. the nose is german dark malts, lager yeast, and a strong booze element, almost like an ice beer, in a good way though, not a cheap way. the flavor shows the grain just unfolding in cool layers, dried fruit, raisin, molasses, dried apricot, bakers chocolate, tobacco, figs, pudding skin, and dusty german ritualistic stale grain. its fun and different, and its the only beer that screams at me christmas, without actually containing pine needles, honey, sugar plums (whatever they are), or anything else. one of the best bocks going as far as i am concerned. thanks to my buddy chris for sharing this one from his impressive cellar. lucky i am to be your friend mate!"

"This is a surprisingly good bock which I found in my cellar yesterday and chilled overnight.  I find most of Penn Brewery’s stuff to be mediocre at best, but this old bock is unexpectedly good – good aroma, tempting appearance, smooth palate, and pleasing flavor."
""
"O: Interesting. I find most doppelbocks to be quite sweet but this one is surprisingly dry. Almost too dry. It gives it a crisp, easy drinkability for the ABV but it's a little too much at times. Otherwise has nice malty and yeasty flavors. I enjoyed it, a little different than your typical doppelbock."
""
""
"O - I particularly enjoyed the flavor and taste of this brew. It's up against of recent heavy hitters as noted above but it stands up well and is worth revisiting. Glad to have received this as a holiday gift."
""

"Picked up this 2013 version bomber at the estimable Krugel's Georgetown Deli in Wilkes-Barre. Pours beautifully into the goblet. Fluffy head packed it in early but ring and lacing look nice. Extremely deep brown; almost black. Slight spice or something to the nose; otherwise aroma somewhat muted. Not the chewiest DB I've had but decent heft. Alcohol is pretty muted; very drinkable. Very good flavor. Nice beer overall."
""
""
"O - A world-class beer. I can't believe this was only $5.50 a bomber. If you can get this beer, get it. I am going to buy a case of it so I can cellar it for a year or more... FANTASTIC!"
""
"I was pleased with this Pittsburgh born Doppelbock. It wasn't overly roasted or sweet. It took the middle ground between the two. Would I drink it again? I probably would. I don't think I would sit on this beer for very long."
""
"Overall, solid beer and one I wish I had waited to crack open in the colder months but just couldn't stare at it in the fridge any longer. This would be the perfect beer on a cold October/November night by the campfire."
""
""
""
"I recently had a Randall-ed version with rye whiskey-soaked oak chips (2012 vintage) that I thought was excellent. I know this beer rather well. Private Reserve always treats me right and it was fun pulling this from the cellar and seeing what was up. Flavors mellow slightly and the body falters a bit, but the complexity is quite a feat. Recommended for all you German beer lovers out there."

"Taste is heartily malty sweet to start, dark fruits in the middle, maybe a touch of fusel closing with a light bitterness and alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is slickery smooth, and drinkability is good. Nice rep of the style, and an enjoyable brew. Was worried about excessive spicing in a holiday brew, but this one's safe."
""
""
""
"A pretty tasty beer, a bit cloying but good and manageable. Would have it again around the holidays, but a bit rich to drink a lot of."
""
"Overall - Excellent, balanced well and super easy to drink. Nothing over the top, straight up soild, and add to the face you can score this for between 4-6$ a 22oz'er, makes it a value also. Worth a drink every holiday season."
""
""
""
"O- I'm in love. I think I cracked this it the right time. maybe could have gone longer but I'm quite satisfied with having imbibed it when I did. All this in mind, you had better beat me to the Penn Brewpub this winter, because I intend to get as much of this coming years vintage as my wallet will allow for."
""
"O: This beer probably has a better value than 90% on the market. At $4 a bottle you would be a fool to not buy it. Wonderful balance, very nice presentation, should age well. Cannot go wrong here."

"Sorry Redliner8, thanks for sharing it tho."
"Pours a dark brown, pretty much opaque. Aromas of dark fruits, brown sugar and molasses. In the taste, sugary malts, caramel, fig, raisin and dates make for a tasty beverage. Roasted malts are in the background. The presence of alcohol is on the small side, with just a little warmth. There is a hint of spice. Malty, semi sweet, and having little to no bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with medium carbonation. Overall, glad I finally got to try this one. A nice malty bock that hides its strength and is easy to drink. I believe it is bottle conditioned and would like to try it in that format next."
""
"2.5 D: I'm pissed that the new operations managed to ruin this beer as well. It used to be a favorite of mine."

"Batch 1 shared by BeerRay. Pours a beautiful garnet hue with no head, just a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Nose expresses dark fruit reminiscent of fruitcake and a bready character. Taste reveals wet cardboard, subdued dark fruit, some toffee notes and a suggestion of noble hops. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even, crisp carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Overall impression is that this is a decent brew; however, perhaps a little past its prime."
"This is such a good offering from Penn Brewery. They did absolutely stunning things with the Bock style. This, quite possibly, is the best American offering of the Bock style. Please, pour me more!"

"Picked up a bottle of this back marked Batch 001 in 2008. The selling it had been trying to get rid of these for a little while. At that time I really wasn't into buying bombers... I just wanted 12oz. bottles and one day I caved and bought this one. I saved it for a little while and then opened it with some friends. The beer poured out as a dark brown color. The head was a light tan color, the retention and lacing were minimal. The smell of the beer was malty, it had just a little bit of spice to it. The taste of the beer was pretty good, lots of malts in there to sweeten up the brew, some grains and a touch of booze heat in there as well. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty good, I can't really say that there was anything wrong with it. Overall the beer was drinkable, I've never had the urge to find this brew again since I had it."
"O - It's on the nose for a bock, or so the Germans would have you believe, and a solid enough beer."
"Pours a deep brown with great garnet highlights and a smallish creamy off white head that recedes much to quickly. Smells of malt, yeah I know right a bock that's malty go figure. Sweet toffee and caramelized sugars mixed with some sweet plums, and hints of cocoa. Taste is sweet with dark fruits, melanoidin, cocoa, and toffee. The taste is wonderful in its malty sweetness without being cloying. No hop presence detected. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, light to medium level of carbonation, sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I enjoyed the hell out of this while watching the Steelers get it handed to them in the Superbowl. Very nice bock."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into dimpled mug. Pours a brown mahogany body with a small beige head that leaves some spotty lacing. Aroma of malty toffee, herbal hops, and hints of cocoa and pears. Medium body and carbonation. Taste is rich maltiness, with an emphasis on toffee. Herbal hops impart a sturdy bitterness Vague fruity hints are less assertive than in the aroma. A pretty good American bock but I was hoping for better."
"D: Keeper this one is. I wait all year for this and never disapoints.This year snagged a few extras and gave them out as well appriciated gifts. (2010)"
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. Alcohol is definitely there, but not as hot as the ABV would suggest. Great flavors that combine well, and it wasn't hard to finish the whole bomber."
"D: A nice sipping beer for a cold winters day. One or two in a sitting for me. One of my favorite bocks."
"Not my favorite style but this is the epitome of a bock, if you like that give it a shot."
"Beer is medium bodied, leads off with a nice sweetness and a strong malt character. The finish is really nice. Bocks are sexy beers, they aren't huge in flavors and alcohols but they are transparent. This beer has a slight roast at the back, a full palate experience and a great finish. I really like it, if you are looking for a good bock, this is probably it, I'd have it again and I'd be interested in the NON-brewer's reserve version of this. Hopefully I can get some when it's released this month."
"D - I think our tasting group was somewhat underwhelmed by the straightforward nature of this beer. The main comment tossed around was that it was very ""bocky"". I don't drink bocks very often, but if I did this would be a very solid choice."
"Pours light brown to amber in color with a bit of a white head and some decent lacing. Pretty good retention. Nose brings some light malt and some caramel, bread, nuts, and light hops. The taste is caramel and some lightly-toasted bread. Good feel and nice drinkability. Definitely one of the better beers I've had from them."
"Thanks Davolebomb for throwing this in as an extra."
"Notes: Bottle is from batch #002 and it lists 7.5% as the ABV."
"Drinks great- 8.5% is super smooth and malty."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is about perfect, creamy, but not cloying. This is very drinkable beer, and it's been a pleasure to try."
"If I could score bottles like this again for $6.99 I would do it. Recommended for local Pittsburgh flavor. I have a feeling that by the end of the bottle it will taste really good."
"750 from Whole Foods, Reston - Batch 002"
"4/4/4.5/4/4"
"tatse: this is pretty good got some carmel Smooth, roasted malts figs rasins. i was totally not expecting this. the body was really thin but the etoh is very hidden. I drank the whole bottle in one sitting by myself."
"Medium dark brown with reddish highlights. Tan head that falls to a skim. Taste is rich sweet malt - really nice. Plum, raisin, molasses. The taste follows the smell - quite tasty. Little bit of licorice on the aftertaste. Maybe a touch of alcohol too. Medium body and nicely carbonated. Fine structure and pretty smooth. Overall a tasty bock that I luckily have one more of!"
"Regardless the ABV it was very enjoyable"
"Drinkability: Going down easy but watch out for the abv which is well hidden."
"You could throw down a lot of these. I don't think anybody would hate this beer. Grandma's, cousins, friends all enjoyed it. Only concern is the alcohol content."
"Drinkability is very good for the style. Overall this is a really nice beer."
"D - good all around bock, however it didn't blow me away either...with snow coming down again, the warmth of the beer helped out"
"These people make a great lager. I could have finished this myself but it was much more fun to share this brew with friends"
"drinkability: good"
"M + D: Medium body, a little spicy warmth on the finish. An easy going drinker, but certainly not a difficult one to imbibe in."
"Drinkability: A great brew that I imagine would have been much greater about a year ago. It's funny, 'cause I've been trying to crack this one at tastings for about that amount of time now, but for some reason, it just never worked out. Alas, as it's a great beer. Hopefully, Penn makes this one again this year and I'm able to pick it up. A traditional bock that - at 8% - is really actually quite drinkable, and definitely qualifies for the modifier ""Reserve."" Kudos."
"D- Nice...better than the original St. Nikolaus Bock"
"Nice bock. Enjoyable."
"Batch 002 enjoyed on 12/26/09 and nothing from the original review has changed."
"This beer poured a deep brown with ruby highlights that are even more pronounced when held to the light. Head is about 1- 1 1/2 finger of thick foamy off white head. Spotty lacing is left on the side. Nose is caramel and toffee malts, touch of chocolate mixed in here. There is also a hint of fruit in the nose - raisins is what I mostly pick up. Taste is of bitter chocolate, mixed nicely with caramel and toffee malts. Some earthiness follows the malts mixed with the fruity raisin presence detected in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium to full body, creamy feel that goes down nice and smooth. This is a nice beer to sit with on a cool evening."
"Overall: great"
"D: Wow, this is one of the best I've had in a while. Kind of pricey at $12 a bottle, but as a once and a while thing definitely worth it."
"Cheers."
"Smooth, yet complex. Oh so drinkable. A good amount of roasted malts and caramel. A very enjoyable bock. Recommended."
"D - an excellent beer I could drink it year round but I love it more knowing I can wait to have it as a celebratory bock for christmas. The lager is very drinkable for an 8% beer."
"Most of this beer in the store was priced at $11.99, but on one shelf it was priced $5.99 and I got the last one. I don't know why it was cheaper. Maybe it was old. But it makes sense that it would age well for a bock because the alcohol is higher than average for the style."
"Drinkability is excellent. Until I saw the listing on this database I assumed it was around 5 or 6% alcohol because that is what it drinks like. Very good and has held up very well. I would like to try this one again, fresh would be nice. If i see this one around for a reasonable price I will pick up a bottle to pop open for next christmas."
"Drinkabilty is ok, not that exciting of a brew, but the ABV is well hidden, although the spiciness certainly isn't smooth. I know people like to score things high around here, but to me this is just an average dopplebock..."
"Aother solid beer from Penn and I'd like to get my hands on another one."
"A very good beer from Penn. Tastes great and super easy to drink. Definitely try it if you get a chance."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat rich but also a little on the light side. Very drinkable and smooth. This is a very good, slow-sipping holiday beer."
"Bocks were traditionally brewed for special occasions, including religious festivals like Christmas. I personally would consider the Winter Holidays to be a perfect time of year to enjoy this style and Penn Brewing has treated me with this late Christmas gift. There is no doubt St. Nikolaus (note the German spelling) would be especially proud of this rendition of the traditionally German style - I bet he'd like to have one too after a long night's work!"
"D- a delicious bock and a very worthy holiday offering, i gotta thank relatives from pittsburgh for sending me this st nick. fresh and satisfying, its starting me off all warm and sweet on a christmas eve."
"Hopefully, Pennsylvania Brewing Company will see the wisdom of releasing St. Nikolaus Bock Bier Brewers Reserve each year. If not, we can at least console ourselves with the standard version, which is every bit as good. I love the bright red velvet bag that the bottle was sold in. It makes a special holiday beer seem even more special."
"I'm not typically a fan of the style, but I enjoyed this beer. The flavors were spot-on, making for a tasty and drinkable beer. If you like bocks, then I suggest you seek this one out. Recommended."
"Batch 001. This poured a semi-translucent dark chocolate brown with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like earthy caramel and sweet molasses malt, with honey wheat and a bit of copper hops and alcohol. It tasted like roasted chocolate and barley malt, with copper hops and a bit of sweet yeast. It was very thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very tasty beer with clean flavor. It had great body, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was very easy to drink. It's hard to complain, but considering the cost and fancy packaging, I wish this was a doppelbock instead of single. It needs something extra to make it truly special. Maybe a couple years of age will improve it?"
"In the end, wow, this was damn good. Who would have thought I would have been drinking a Andescher and this is in the same three day period is just absurd. There are far too few of these good bock biers out there anymore and it is a shame. This was one solid beer I would love to see in regular rotation."
"Crimson sunset chestnut. Big head and nice lace. It diew quickly though, minimal lacing and retention. Aromas are all big fat German malt. Yeasty fresh baked dark berad, a bit of chocolate and americano. A nice blend. Taste is big malt and bread with plenty of malt and yeast complexity. Hops are lacking. Mouthfeel is big and warming. Finish is dry and hot. Drinkability is good."
"A lovely drinking bock, and happy for me I found it at StateLine Liquors. Pours dark, not overly foamy. Malty yet not too sweet.A tad of sourness, good moderate roastiness and mdoerate chocolate. Balance, above average mouthfeel. Great after dinner digestive. Spot on."
"It is becomming increasingly difficult to find quality Bockbiers. Lighter than a Dopplebock, but not a watery, bastardized American version either. A solid brown- cola looking color with mild carbonation, creamy head formation that whithered slowly, leaving light traces of lacing behind. Aromas of caramelized sugars and malt give a meloidin rich molassas scent with a rich, meaty, malty, broathy note. Esters of dates, nuts, plumbs, figs, and grapes. Flavors are less sweet, less estery, more malty and with more of a toasty-dry flavor that provides a lot of bittering. A well attenuated, clean, caramel malt flavor remains simple, pure, and unmuddled. Textures are firmly malty with no residual sweetness, cloying, or astringent. A refreshing herbal, grassy hop taste and bittering complements the toasted grains and gives complexity to the flavors and textures. Finishes with crisp bitterness, toastiness, and the first signs of nutmeg, allspice, and clove. The beer would be much better without these- but hey, it wouldn't be marketable as a Christmas beer without them now would it?"
"Drank very easy, this one took a little while to open up; my suggestion: serve closer to ale serving temps than lager. A very good bock as good as most or better than ones I've had in the fatherland or any where else!"
"D: The 8.5% and 750 mL bottle leave me content with the one I've got. This would be a excellent Christmas Eve beer."
"750 ml batch 001, many thanks to BEERchitect for the bottle! Pours a cloudy chestnut body with a small beige head that leaves delicate patchy lacing on the glass. Aroma is malty toffee, some cocoa, herbal hops, raisins, and some ripe pears. Medium body and carbonation make for a smooth feel. Taste is highlighted by malty toffee with cocoa undertones. Herbal and earthy hop bitterness is up to the task for balance. Dark fruity notes(figs) and some fresh pears in the background serve up some welcome complexity. Very nicely done."
"Special thanks to jcdiflorio for sending this my way."
"Drinkability: Although I would like to see a bit more carbonation, the aromas and taste of this beer are extraordinary; I wish more bocks moved in this direction"
"Drinkability - why not just make *this* the Nikolaus Bock? Darn tasty."
"Thanks to EGledhill for this one...great trader!"
"Jet black body with milky soft brown, swiftly settling head--intimidating in its snifter! Malt is considerable, but not obtrusive... smooth early, with a bit of effervescence and a warm finish--not feeling like 8.0%... a bit of peat; rich, full-bodied malt, a little smoke and a pleasant finish... I've had bocks with a third of the alcohol that strained the tastebuds more--smooth! As winnings from a fantasy football wager, this beer (courtesy of Ryan, again!) 2007 batch #001 is a winner also, the second pour producing a smoother, creamier drink--a fitting February/March pleasure."
"Penn Brewery's regular St. Nik bock leaves milk and cookies for santa. The brewers reserve leaves santa a bottle of Jack and a Louisville Slugger. Get some get loaded. Short of the high abv i'd drink this stuff nonstop. Another great small batch brew from the guys at penn."
"Now I'll have to try the regular St. Nicholaus to see how it compares."
"D: Super easy drinking. Goes down smooth. No hint of the ABV even though it is low. Really great effort from Penn brewing. Hope they make batch 002 next year."
"Overall, Tom Pastorious' ghost will haunt this brewery as much as I want their Penn Dark, Penn Gold, and St Nik Bocks to return to their glory days...I'm a realist, and the amount of bad kharma exchanged during Tom Pastorious fallout with a company he started in the late 1980s has scarred this company exponentially!  Hit or miss like all of Penn's beer...that's right I can't even spell it bier, you know why because this used to be the best German style brewer in the US.  Nowadays chocolate meltdown and nut roll ales are overshadowing their German roots which formed this brewery, for that and that alone the current shareholders and administration will pay for what they did!  Physically assault Tom, when he was trying to revive his creation after a horrible deal where brewing operations where moved to the Lion Brewery in Wilkes Barre, PA...Tom is the reason we all drink Penn in the Burgh...and he is the reason we still drink Penn brewed in the Burgh!!!  Get back to your roots or die, Hofbrauhaus doesn't need you to survive but Pittsburgh core beer drinkers do need you!!!"
"Beer is good. Happy big bock beering."
"If you like the normal release of this beer (Regular st. niklaus bock), You will LOVE this beer. Even if you don't, this beer is still definitely worth your time."
"what an outstanding brew"
"Crystal clear, mahogany brown and a small but nice white head that leaves slight lace down the bottle. Aroma is slight malt and less hops, but with some solvent-like characters. Flavor is rich malt and some alcohol, with hints of hops. Solvent-like, slightly estery late in the flavor. Medium body, supported well by the malt. Aftertaste is slightly sweet but with touches of hops as well."
"i was a big fan of the regular st. nick bock and this one surpasses the latter. only downside is it's a little pricey but definitely worth treating yourself if you liked the original"
"Pours a dark brown with a tan head that leaves a lot of lacing on the way down. Clean malty nose with a not a lot going on with it. Still nice though. Flavor is nice and smooth with a good leafy edge and a sweet tone that hits on the back half. Nice robust qualities to it. Smooth feel with a slightly higher level of carbonation. A very easy drinking bock with good robust tones. Goes down very smooth. And you've got to love the nice little bag the bottle comes in."
"D = A very good lager. Tasty and definitely worth revisiting. Too strong to session drink, but who cares?"
"batch #001... i think this is a great beer. i've actually always been impressed by their stuff. fairly clear, dark amber - almost brown - with some rubyish highlights. cream/light tan colored big, thick head that holds very well and leaves impressive lace. nose is nice and subdued but clean and wonderful. malt, dark fruit , roasty -almost campfire style -, and hops in the background. taste is even better. complex, well balanced mix of nose and a real nice roasty finish. medium body. very silky. another top notch beer from penn. i'll have another."
"750 ml bottle, Batch # 001. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. The aroma is very malty, it smells like dark fruit, burnt wood (oak?) and a bit of spice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some spicy hops and a small amount of alcohol noticable in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has moderate carbonation and a nice rich feel to it. Drinkability is pretty good too, it's very smooth and goes down very easy. I think it's a pretty good beer, I'd definitely recommend it to others to try."
"750ml bottle that comes in a red velvet bag that resembles santa's sack. Pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is very malty with a nice array of holiday spices. The taste much like the aroma features a nice big malt backbone dark fruits and spices dancing around on the tongue. The drinkability is very high for this beer, especially considering the high ABV. Overall, this is a really nice beer that is highly recommended!"
"Pours a nice dark brown with great head and lacing. It has a fantastic scent, a very rich and malty aroma. Same for the taste, a great malty and thick beer flavor with great spice undertones. The alcohol is just noticable and gives it a great warming sensation without overpowering or covering up the great taste. Goes down nice. I will definitely be having several more of these this Christmas season."
"Extra smooth and creamy,has a very light mouthfeel,just melts away in your mouth. Unbelivable drinkability,just kinds of slides down. Just can't belive there is alcohol in the beer. You do feel it though. Must try beer,get it while you can. I'll be looking for a case."
