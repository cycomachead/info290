Very underrated and under appreciated doppelbock. GLBC make a lot of great ales, but I don't think any American brewery does lagers like they do. Lagers are forgotten in today's beer universe, but I'm telling you right now, this as is all GLBC lagers some of the best on the planet. If this is released again grab it and try it. It's a top notch doppelbock.","BradtheGreat7","Jul 12, 2013"

The mouth feel is very nice, creamy and smooth. Overall this is a really good beer by Great Lakes.","chefhatt","Aug 14, 2012"

(translated: I can't figure out what fruit this reminds me of) I usually can't stand bocks or doppelbocks, but this one is nice.

3.9,1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 5/29/2012. Pours very cloudy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice thick cap that lasts. Some decent soapy lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of raisin, caramel, prune, molasses, biscuit, toasted malt, nuttiness, chocolate, pepper, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, bread, toasted malt, honey, chocolate, earth, nuttiness, and light herbal spiciness. Big malt flavors on the finish with some spiciness; with lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, molasses, biscuit, chocolate, and toast on the finish for a bit. Flavors were not as robust as I was hoping for, but were still extremely balanced with good complexity. No cloying sweetness at all; with a slightly dry finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel which is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Very easy to sip on. Overall this is a really nice doppelbock. Nice flavor balance with good complexity; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 30, 2012"

Not a lot to the initial flavor profile, but the finish is deep, roasted nuts. Tastes more of a nut brown than a bock. Certainly not the favorite bock or dopplebock I’ve ever had.

Taste is fairly sweet with a counter of burnt sugars. Some dark fruits come out in the flavor but this one lies heavier towards the melanoid side of things. Medium body and level of carbonation with a sweet burnt sugary slick kind of mouthfeel. Nice beer, perhaps not on the level of some of the German beers of the style, but a nice drinker nonetheless.","johnnnniee","Mar 04, 2012"

Smells of malt and sweet bread and a bit of fruit that I can't quite place. A nice little bite on the lips in the front end that gives way to a nice rich malty mouthfeel that finishes clean. A nice example of the style and there's a decent bit of carbonation that mixes with the malt to keep it from being too rich, thick or alcohol heavy. Another solid offering from Great Lakes.","Blueribbon666","Feb 10, 2012"

Boozy aromas sneak in as it warms up.Smooth, thick and creamy feel. Sweet roasted malts up front with dark fruits and chocalte malt in the middle and an herbal hop bitterness at the finish.

3.7,-4.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the uniqueness in flavoring. While it upheld all of the classic parameters of the style it presented with some unusual components, specifically in the grain department. Here it deviated away from the sweeter, slightly roasty grain profile to something closer to that of a porter. This gave thorough bitterness, and a deepness of flavoring not found in your average doppelbock.","TheBrewo","Jun 19, 2011"

4.12,6.7,4,4.5,4,4,4," Deep roasted malts were commonplace here, with tons of sugary notes residing inside of them. Lots of nuttiness coming through now, the sweetness still there, but really being blended out now. Really very big and complex aroma, very nice and strong.A rich nutty caramel wave came crashing through my mouth upon the first taste. Really rich and smooth, it really just kind of sat there letting you absorb all of these rich flavors that just, well were wonderful. lots of caramel and earthy grain like flavors then coming in behind it, deepen the profile and adding a good bit of backbone to it. nice and sweet and grainy. The finish was quick, nothing really dragging on for too long, but not crisp or clean; a smooth drawn out sugary close was to be expected.","mikesgroove","Jun 01, 2011"

Lots of caramel malts in the nose, nutty, with some toasted bread. Similar taste, roasty malts, bready, nutty, caramel and toffee, and a touch of figs and plums. Also a definite coffee quality present in the taste; not as pronounced as a coffee stout perhaps, but a coffee essence was definitely present here. Not much alcohol noticeable.

Smell is str8 forward german malts with a slight touch of peat and dark fruit if you sniff for it. A roasty appeal and a raw nuttiness with warming. Taste is ok up front but the aftertaste is not so hot. It starts off bold mixing caramel, other malts, and grassy hops, they just dont jive afterwards with the peat or some other type of nasty taste. Starts great, finishes ugly. Nuttiness and a hint of fusel alcohol. Feel is up to snuff a approaching full body with enough depth to coat the tounge momentarily. Carb is nice, semi bitey though, fizzy. This is an OK dopple from a Brewery that shines with German offerings, perhaps a tweak down the road will help things or perhaps this bottle just needs to rest for two months or so. It does not have a long shelf life (expires on 6-24-11) so I guess this is meant to be enjoyed fresh.","BARFLYB","Apr 25, 2011"

The flavor has some mild caramel sweetness and a touch of bread. Pretty tame. Medium body with no real alcohol noticeable.

There was a bit of roast and then caramel and toffee, but none of the licorice and berry fruit notes I'd expect from a true doppelbock. It's like it's just too clean, and yes, it tasty, clean beer - an American take on the style I suppose. The body is also appropriately thick and smooth.

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A great doppelbock with awesome and simple flavors -- something with so few ingredients should be just like this; with a near 8% ABV I don't know if I could have more than couple, but on a cool early spring night, it's pretty fitting.","bamadog","Beers"

3.75,-2.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I was hoping this would be a little bolder but it isn't, and it doesn't have that great thick malt I associate with this style. It's good for drinkability but I think I might go for something else in this style.","smakawhat","Mar 09, 2011"
3.8,-1.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Overall, this is good, but a little lackluster for Great Lakes. Maybe I just miss Blackout...","ne0m00re","Mar 08, 2011"

4.33,12.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D- Very drinkable. Full flavored brew that soars above most of the other ""spring seasonals"".","projectflam86","Mar 06, 2011"
3.73,-3.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D- Not a bad beer altogether, but lacks the clean flavor that really defines the style. I would prefer to pick up a Celebrator, but I have no problem finishing the rest of my 4 pack.","Lolli1315","Mar 05, 2011"
4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D-very drinkable like most doppelbocks. not a bad brew at all!","brew3crew","Mar 05, 2011"
4.13,7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle, best by 6/1/2011. Served in a mug, the beer pours a clear reddish/amber color with an inch frothy tan head. Head retention is good, with a lot of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like toffee, caramel malt, dark fruit (figs), and a bit of brown sugar. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, just full of malty goodness. There's also a nutty taste noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is great, it's very smooth and enjoyable. This is a good brew, and a nice addition to Great Lakes bottled lineup. I'd definitely buy this again.","bluejacket74","Feb 28, 2011"
4.01,3.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: This one went very fast - highly drinkable on it own, and went quite well with a meal (ravioli). I could easily see having another although by the end of the glass I'm starting to notice that higher ABV since the beer was finished rather quickly. Overall very easy to drink and a bit dangerous with how easy it is to drink.","damndirtyape","Feb 21, 2011"
4.08,5.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall I was very pleased with this beer. The head was not as thick as I would have preferred and the scent was a little lacking. Great complexity in the flavor with an excellent mouthfeel that makes this as drinkable as a Bock.","output01x","Feb 11, 2011"
4.88,26.4,5,4.5,5,5,5,"After trying it on tap at the Brewhouse and then in bottles, I can honestly say this is the best beer i have had.","VncentLIFE","Dec 12, 2010"
3.73,-3.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"This is a very sessionable beer. However the alcohol eventually will catch up to you. If this is the same price as the rest of great lakes 4 packs I would say its not worth the money but if its less give it a shot. I am very sad that this took Blackout's spot for february because that is a far superior beer. I do hope this is not a permanent seasonal.","beerhan","Nov 15, 2010"
4.03,4.4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"D:Score is all around on this one, does not represent the style well but is actually really tasty and easy to drink. Fruits and sweetness dominate this one and make it pleasurable. GL definitely hit something different with one.","SuperNova777","Beers"
3.88,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The only thing I really don't like about this beer is the mouthfeel is a little under for what I think of a Doppelbock. Although, with this beer it is good. A good try in this style from them....good job. Can't wait for this to come out in 4 pk's.","alleykatking","0"
