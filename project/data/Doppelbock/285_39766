4.5,19.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Perhaps a quarter finger off-white head. Fades quickly and leaves no lacing. Clear and light amber in color. Smells  like a barleywine, smelling bright golden raisins, prunes, brown sugar, and floral notes. Tastes very much like aromatics, picking up notes of honey. Very much like a barleywine or even a mead in certain aspects. Mouth-feel is very gentle, which surprised me considering the strength. Medium syrupy body. Minimal carbonation and warming sensation from alcohol, yet sweetness overcomes the drying feel I was expecting. Leaves a slick, oily feel on mouth, with a lingering aftertaste. Very interesting beer, one I'd be happy to pick up again, and will try to save some for cellaring.","sporklift87","Mar 17, 2015"
4.38,16.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"From taste notes. Appearance: Pours brilliant garnet, almost looks like a mix of a chardonnay and a red. Has legs.  Smell: Smells more like a wine with perfumy notes than a beer. Taste: A touch of fruit in the taste suggesting cherry, a little sweet but a deft hop touch on the end provides balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel: Full body, very low carbonation, a little hot. Overall: Sweet and hot. Something you would reach for instead of a mixed drink or a port.","pat61","Mar 15, 2015"

4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"330 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with solid retention, that reduces to a ring of lace. Minimal lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, honey, brown sugar, golden raisin, plum, fig, cherry, apple, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste big of caramel, honey, brown sugar, golden raisin, plum, fig, cherry, apple, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, honey, brown sugar, golden raisin, plum, fig, cherry, apple, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small-moderate warming after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Helles doppelbock style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2014"

Prunes, plums, dates, and figs underlie rich, sweet treacley malt, with notes of toffee surfacing late. Flavor is very sweet, but there's a bitter, dry finish, and sherry notes present themselves in the aftertaste. Figs and plums underlie caramel malt. There's still some alcohol warmth. I was hoping for less sweetness and more complex esters, but still a nice brew.","barczar","Aug 15, 2014"

Underneath, the date and sugar-plum take hold. It is a German beer, and later in the taste, that becomes more evident to me. A spice note grabs the beer first to counter the sweet, maybe clove or nutmeg in nature, but it's not enough. Letting the beer finish, there is an obvious bitterness that creeps in to balance the sweetness, but it probably comes just a little late.","cjgiant","May 11, 2014"

No head after pouring, the beer seems barely carbonated. Aroma is not nearly as intimidating to me as it was to other reviewers. Not unlike the regular Samichlaus Bier offering. Then again I love big beers. It smells good, but I am mostly getting just very sweet caramel, syrup, and malty notes here. Taste - It tastes aged, and I just now realized this was bottled in 2007... As I sip I am reminded of Sugar Daddy candy, until there is a distinct sharpness on my tongue and a somewhat drastic warming in my gut. Some earthiness to it as well and a tiny hint of chocolate.

The smell is of malts, toffee, booze, and apple. It's an inviting aroma. The alcohol comes through pretty strongly in the taste. I catch the rest of those flavors I picked up from the nose. There is some hop bitterness on the back end, but it has that cloying taste that sticks to the mouth. There's enough carbonation to make the aftertaste disappear quickly. It becomes more bready as the beer warms up. The body is medium to full with abundant carbonation. This is a sipper. Overall, this is a very good beer.

Not alot of head or lace, just a good old fashioned, high alcohol beer here! The aroma is sweet and smells of fermented grains and sweet alcohol, with a nice bit of singe to the note. The beer has a nice taste of grains and alcohol and really warms up as it is going down. Leaves a wonderful slight burn on the tongue and is a very worthy contender in my book as one of the top 10 beers I have tried, without a doubt.

There is a woodiness, and then sweet. A hint of pepper, then just sugar syrup. Mouthfeel is syrupy with nice carbonation. Drinkability is just going to depend on you.

The taste is overwhelmingly sweet and one dimensional. Whatever hops were used in this beer are long gone, leaving only a lingering bitterness that can't compete with the residual sugars. Even the high alcohol content can't cut through the cloying sweetness. The mouthfeel is more thick and chewy than expected even for such a high gravity beer...more like a liqueur.

Honey, Euro hops, clove and alcohol ( it IS 14%). This beer is on fire, plenty of alcohol in the taste. Some honey and bread are all that were left. Thin and astringent in the mouth. I found it odd that a beer this strong could be watery. Some lingering cloying sweetness and fire in the belly. 14% but not a lot of depth. This one is "one and done".

It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a sweet aftertaste with a bit of alcohol warming. Overall this was borderline too sweet but was otherwise very tasty.

No real sulfers or corn flavors, so pretty clean upfront, just a lot more estery than expected from a lager. Flavors jump on the peach, pear, mango, appricot, papaya flavors and wonder into a mead-like / zinfindale acidity and alcohols.

3.82,1.6,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Tastes good. The alcohol balances the caramel sweetness perfectly. This is a slow sipper and sweet but not cloying or over the top sweetness. The mouthfeel is rich and carbonated. Drinkability is good for such an abv powerhouse. Over a long evening, I would welcome 2 of them but probably regret it later. In all, a very tasty beer, ideal for a nightcap or winter warmer.","JayQue","Apr 15, 2008"
2.77,-26.3,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"From a 750ml swing top bottle. Pours a clear pale amber color with minimal head/lacing/cap. The aroma is somewhat faint, notes of juicy fruit and white wine. The taste is sugary sweet, some honey and a bit of berry fruit but really just a sugary alcohol bomb. The feel is light and quite fizzy, very slick and sticky, finishes very sweet and suprisingly astringent. The drinkability is very limited with this one. If you are looking for an after dinner brew, maybe 6oz this might be a fine selection but other than that this is almost undrinkable. Very sweet and the alcohol is not hidden, no malt or hops to help mask the booze. Not all that good. Not sure how dopplebock was decided upon, maybe the first uber imperial helles lager??","Gmann","Apr 13, 2008"

I am not a huge fan of this offering, it is just not my thing.","cjgator3","Feb 08, 2008"
4.25,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Red label Samichlaus Helles was picked up in a 12 oz., brown bottle, and poured into a goblet. The beer came out fizzy and developed almost no head, but the body was a crystal clear, pale gold. The smell was quite a fruity and alcoholic treat. Lots of pears, apples, and grapes on the nose, soaked in cognac. The taste was warm, sweet, and ... well it was hard to get past the sweet. The spices (anise and pepper), vanilla, and fruits were all drizzled in lots of powdered sugar. Some might find this level of sweetness cloying, but I found the strong countering by the drying alcohol a sufficiently palatable combination. As I got further along, some hop bitterness showed up as well. Very richly textured, and oh so warming. Some might consider this a good fireside sipper, but I'd be beware of igniting the vapors. Fits all the classic definitions of a cellarable a beer, and I sure will be stashing away some for a decade or more to get it to peak.","rajendra82","Feb 06, 2008"

There's a strong, dry alcohol flavor, in line with watered-down vodka. The malt just comes off like a very concentrated light lager with caramel malt ad a touch of grassy hops. It's not all-out offensive, but I won't be finishing this one. I'll return to this one after I let a bottle mellow for a year or two.","tempest","Beers"

Odor is fruity, clean. hints of teak, apples, mild cherry, brandy. Taste is burning, warming alcohol, grapes, raspberry and sweet toffee. Alcohol is almost a flavor in itself. Sweet malt backbone. The whole thing seems understated, but at the same time huge and demanding. Mouthfeel is syrupy and thick, like congealing Jell-O. Overall its a sipper, a beer liquor.

Warming alcohol is very whiskey like. A nice sipper on a winter night but I prefer the regular Samichlaus to this Helles. This one could use some more aging.","merlin48","Jan 05, 2008"

My girlfriend (the veterinary technician) claimed she smelled male rat musk. Hmm. Serious rubbing alcohol flavor bringing up secondary aromas of new band-aids. As the beer warmed up there was a more pronounced flavor of honey/ mead, and then aroma turned into an urban alley frequented by beer drinking bladder relievers. There was good and bad in this. I don't think it wise for a beer with so much alcohol to be attempted with such lighter malts, as all manner of trouble shows through.","dedrinker","Dec 07, 2007"

I will say that this is a prime example of a Helles on steroids, it is much boozier, and certainly a bit sweeter than i would expect of an Helles, but other than that it does remain true-to-form (so well as I know the style) and if half of one didn't make me as tipsy as this one has, i would really be in the mindset of drinking a few of these...."","bradleyseven","Nov 24, 2007"

At first I by passed it as it looked the same as a regular but then noticed it was a special edition so I had to pick one up. It poured a nice pale golden yellow with a smallish head that faded quickly. The aroma was full of malt and grass like smells with a touch of alcohol, but that is to be expected. The flavor was much sweeter then I thought it would be with a nice rounded caramel tone a good amount of brandy like alcohol thrown in. Some bready and cereal like malt base making up the rest with a sweet sugary finish that was sprikled with a touch of floralness. Overall this was a good bit different then the normal, seemed to be a bit sweeter, defintly lighter looking and a touch hotter with the alcohol. Very intresting find and will have to go back to the store and grab a couple more.","mikesgroove","0"
