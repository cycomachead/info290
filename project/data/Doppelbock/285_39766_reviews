"Perhaps a quarter finger off-white head. Fades quickly and leaves no lacing. Clear and light amber in color. Smells  like a barleywine, smelling bright golden raisins, prunes, brown sugar, and floral notes. Tastes very much like aromatics, picking up notes of honey. Very much like a barleywine or even a mead in certain aspects. Mouth-feel is very gentle, which surprised me considering the strength. Medium syrupy body. Minimal carbonation and warming sensation from alcohol, yet sweetness overcomes the drying feel I was expecting. Leaves a slick, oily feel on mouth, with a lingering aftertaste. Very interesting beer, one I'd be happy to pick up again, and will try to save some for cellaring."
"From taste notes. Appearance: Pours brilliant garnet, almost looks like a mix of a chardonnay and a red. Has legs.  Smell: Smells more like a wine with perfumy notes than a beer. Taste: A touch of fruit in the taste suggesting cherry, a little sweet but a deft hop touch on the end provides balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel: Full body, very low carbonation, a little hot. Overall: Sweet and hot. Something you would reach for instead of a mixed drink or a port."

"I'm not really sure what to think of this beer. Sweet, strong and malty."
"Hard to find beer. Had one from 2007 and it was absolutely amazing."
"Overall, I figured this one would be very sweet and I was right. I really wanted to enjoy this one but it just isn't for me."
""
"Overall: A great celebration beer; big bang in each taste, great mellowed alcohol, a Sugar Daddy like candy quality that can be a bit overwhelming and demands either sharing the bottle or taking the long, slow route with a water back. I'm going to enjoy this as a Christmas present from Illudium; Cheers!"

"Yum! Such a rich flavor"
"Overall: Very tasty and interesting beer. I am still amazed at the clean and simple taste of this rather old lager. Well worth a try for me."

"Nice amber colored beer with a very sweet initial flavor followed by a strong alcohol bite.  very little head.  Overall an Outstanding beer, excellent as an after dinner follow up.  Highly recommended."
"330 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with solid retention, that reduces to a ring of lace. Minimal lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, honey, brown sugar, golden raisin, plum, fig, cherry, apple, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste big of caramel, honey, brown sugar, golden raisin, plum, fig, cherry, apple, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, honey, brown sugar, golden raisin, plum, fig, cherry, apple, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small-moderate warming after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Helles doppelbock style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Bottled in 07, it pours with large floaties and a modest, foamy head that disappears. Prunes, plums, dates, and figs underlie rich, sweet treacley malt, with notes of toffee surfacing late. Flavor is very sweet, but there's a bitter, dry finish, and sherry notes present themselves in the aftertaste. Figs and plums underlie caramel malt. There's still some alcohol warmth. I was hoping for less sweetness and more complex esters, but still a nice brew."

"The taste starts almost overwhelmingly sweet, like straight sugar. This evolves to a light brown sugar and maybe into a molasses flavor. Underneath, the date and sugar-plum take hold. It is a German beer, and later in the taste, that becomes more evident to me. A spice note grabs the beer first to counter the sweet, maybe clove or nutmeg in nature, but it's not enough. Letting the beer finish, there is an obvious bitterness that creeps in to balance the sweetness, but it probably comes just a little late."
"Pours a thin layer, white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Very light carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is sugar and hints of alcohol, flavor is smooth and sweet, dark fruit, almost cloying. Similar to their classic. NOT a session beer - the 14% ABV is noticeable . . . savor this beer. $5.99 for a 330ml bottle, from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA. Bottled in 2012."

"The taste is toffee, raisins, grapes (brandy overtones), and lots and lots of sugar. The mouthfeel is syrupy yet a bit sour. It's an interesting combo that makes this a unique brew. I can't say it's my favorite doppelbock (Aventinus is probably the examplar for me), but this winter warmer works despite the aggressive ABV. Yeah, it's a bit boozy and hot, but not as bad as many barleywines or TRIPAs I've had."
"O: This is a great beer. I don't think I could have more than one in a sitting, but one is just fine."
""
"O - It is a lot better than I anticipated. It has a pleasant fruitiness with no alcohol burn. Plus it makes me feel warm all over on another arctic evening in the Midwest."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is not a favorite of mine. It is very sweet and tart and might cater more to a wine drinker but for me it is too overwhelming in that respect."
""
"Overall: A lot sweeter than I imagined. If it didn’t have the booze at the tail end this would be a very mellow beer, but it is still enjoyable."

"Overall - interesting beer. I think this would be good to pair with some sort of dessert like bread pudding maybe, and split with someone else. Definitely a good sharing beer based on the ABV and sweetness"
""
"Don't know what to say about it exactly, probably should have tried an older vintage, pretty sure it would have been way better. Will buy one to set aside for a while."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Tiny chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, fruit, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and toffee flavors on the finish. There is a decent alcohol kick with each sip as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is super tasty but quite boozy and strong."

"O: I've had lots of dark Samichlaus - this is my first pale one. The only thing that could improve this beer is a couple of years cellaring - but my character is too weak..."
"Overall too sweet for me but quite drinkable for a beer with such high alcohol. On the bottle this is described as malt liquor! Wouldnt buy again but not unhappy that i tried it."

"Pours much like a soda into my pint glass - very fizzy with a thin head that disappears instantly. Color is a a muddy, multicolored brown that almost has a hint of green. No head after pouring, the beer seems barely carbonated. Aroma is not nearly as intimidating to me as it was to other reviewers. Not unlike the regular Samichlaus Bier offering. Then again I love big beers. It smells good, but I am mostly getting just very sweet caramel, syrup, and malty notes here. Taste - It tastes aged, and I just now realized this was bottled in 2007... As I sip I am reminded of Sugar Daddy candy, until there is a distinct sharpness on my tongue and a somewhat drastic warming in my gut. Some earthiness to it as well and a tiny hint of chocolate. Full-bodied and noticeable heat. If you are a fan of the regular Samichlaus I would say this is worth a try."

"O: I cannot give it anything but the highest accolades, read the description on the back of the bottle, and you will agree, "" one of the rarest specialities in the world ""."
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear medium copper with a quickly dissipating frothy white head. There are lots of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The smell is of malts, toffee, booze, and apple. It's an inviting aroma. The alcohol comes through pretty strongly in the taste. I catch the rest of those flavors I picked up from the nose. There is some hop bitterness on the back end, but it has that cloying taste that sticks to the mouth. There's enough carbonation to make the aftertaste disappear quickly. It becomes more bready as the beer warms up. The body is medium to full with abundant carbonation. This is a sipper. Overall, this is a very good beer. It's certainly worth a try if you like you want to try a different sort of doppelbock that pushes the limits of the style."
"I don't love all aspects of this, but there is a lot to enjoy here. Sipping is nice as it is so robust that is fills the mouth with so much enjoyment with such little amounts. Glad I tried it."

"DOA"
"Pours a deep pumpkin orange with a finger of off-white head that falls over within minutes. Decent lacing. The nose is still pretty aggressive. Big boozy licorice with a bit of dark wood and raisin. On the tongue, this is just sherry and not much else. Confusingly oxidized for its age and comes across way hotter than 14 percent. Mouthfeel is fine but overall the beer is disappointing. ""The World’s Most Extraordinary Beverage""? Extra ordinary, not extraordinary."
"Wow! What a great brew! The beer pours a beautiful orange and gold color with a perfectly clear tinge. Not alot of head or lace, just a good old fashioned, high alcohol beer here! The aroma is sweet and smells of fermented grains and sweet alcohol, with a nice bit of singe to the note. The beer has a nice taste of grains and alcohol and really warms up as it is going down. Leaves a wonderful slight burn on the tongue and is a very worthy contender in my book as one of the top 10 beers I have tried, without a doubt. A bit expensive, but worth every penny."
"This is without a doubt, a beer that needs time to come into its own, and a lot of it. Is it worth the wait? Only time will tell - but so far, it has been very telling."
""
""
"Over all, don't let it warm up too much, it is better cooler, not old, but certainly not as warm as some other beers. Very similar to some of the other classic long term cellar beers"
"O: The sweetness of this beer is almost overwhelming. Tons of raisin and alcohol makes this beer definitely a sipper."
"[88/100]"

""
"Overall: Really rather sweet but I enjoyed the flavor profile"
""
""
"Overall- I really enjoy sweeter offerings, but this is almost too much. I would prefer it if it had more to offer than the heavy raisin. Because this is a good beer, and I can almost imagine how this would be if it were to make the leap to great."
""
""
""
""
"D - Definitely a sipper. I wasn't sure what to expect, as I've been holding on to this one for some time. Nothing like I'm used to, as above, more a cognac than a beer for me. I could see enjoying this one maybe once a year on St. Nick's Day (eve?), and next year, maybe splitting the bottle..."
""
"Thank you Brad Beerguy for supplying this one. 2007 Vintage. Pours a rich golden color with little head and some serious haze. Smell is all booze at first, but opens up to caramel and toffee malt character. Hops don't give their presence until a sip is taken. For how boozy this beer it is it is very well-balanced. All is toned down by a sweet, caramel malt profile and some serious floral hop notes at the end. This stuff is very tasty. Not a session beer, as one will do in a given night. Worth trying though. I want more."

"Flavor is big and sweet. Like the regular Samichlaus. I think the less-octane Eggenberg beers are better. They just have to find a way to cut the sweetness just a bit."
"Drink- Overall, I felt this was a pretty average attempt at a beer with some age. Yes the ABV is well above normal, but needs more smooth vs. harsh and more flavor besides sweet. I am glad this was on sale when I got in KS. No need for full retail on this bottle."
"Woohoo, this beer is a feat of beer engineering, with its high abv and barrel aging process. It's a little too one, note, but once you start getting into the 14+%, it's hard not to be incredibly sweet, especially for a helles style. I wouldn't drink more than one, but it's not a drain pour. I kinda dig."
"Had to grab this when I saw the bottling date (2007). Was skeptical on the pour as big wafts of a very alcohol-dominated wine smell came my way. Still a nice small had forms and some champagne like bubbles throughout. Smell is very dark fruit with a hint of wine-like alcohol and a tad of honey sweetness. The taste is very sweet with again, wine-like heat that reaches the nose. Body is thick, almost syrupy with a hint of carbonation throughout. Overall you still get tons of darkfruit character, a very nice doppelbock profile. On the whole I would rate this very much worth trying."
"Not sure how to rate this beer since BA has it in the Doublebock catagory. It is not a doublebock in the traditional sense at all. It is a double helles maybe, but that does not really exist. I would say it is a strong lager and a good one at that."
"An enjoyable sipper for the 1 bottle. No way would I have another even if I *had* another bottle at my disposal.;^)"
"D-This one is so sweet and almost hard to get down. Almost medicinal in its taste , its not nearly as palatable as its sibling: the regular Samichlaus."
"O- Very different beer. It's so sweet and is almost difficult to drink the whole bottle. Although it is a 07' vintage, and drinks smooth for the abv."
"As advertised on the bottle this guy is intense in it's sweetness. For me it was like an overly sweet candy so much so that it masked the alcohol you'd expect to experience in a 15% abv drink. I'd rate it lower if it weren't exactly what the brewer was aiming for but I can't be too generous because it's not for me. They really mean it when they say intense sweetness so if you're not a candy sort of person pass on this."
"O- The big sweetness and big alcohol balance into a delicious beer candy with nice fresh wort flavors. As the beer warms a bit too much it gets fusel heat but that is only the last few sips."
"Thin head that disappears almost completely in about a minute. Bronze colored body. Tons of caramel in the nose. Taste of caramel, grape skin, and a little bit of apple. Kinda tart in the finish. The alcohol is there but not as noticeable as you would expect from a 14% beer."
"O- Tasty, great flavors, lots of complexity. I'm glad I picked this up. I'll have to pick up another one when I get the chance."
"Yes, it's something I'm glad I tried, and I'll look forward to comparing it to the original Samichlaus—but I'm pleased the experience is over."
"This bottle was about 5 dollars. I cannot express how over priced that is given this beers qualities. The classic Samichlaus has many qualities that make me certain age will improve it. It has some darn nice effects. This is just alcohol and sweetness to say “look how big I am.” The reason this beer was last brewed and bottled in the 80’s is because there wasn’t anyone begging for more."
"This has a pretty surprising color for a Doppelbock, This beer has a very nice honey golden color with a head that fades rather quickley. The 14% abv is hardly hidden in my opinion. It's a strong tasting beer, as it should be I just don't know how much I enjoy the flavors the Helles gives off. The mouthfeel of this is on the thicker side. Nothing too heavy but not watery either. Personally i like the darker version much better but thats in the eye of the beholder."
"An old friend raves and raves about this, so I had to try it. Good recommendation, for my tastebuds. Intense, but refined. If you want to know what beer tastes like 5,000 feet above barleywine, this is it."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden color, very nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, sweet, nice little spice note, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, alittle spicy, with some nice caramel notes. Medium Body. Very Drinkable, this one is very tasty, a true delight. Thanks Ben."
"This one might smooth out after a couple years, but fresh, the alcohol is just too hot. Boozy, and not very sneaky about it. There are some good notes, but the alcohol is too much."
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle, 2009, into a snifter. The color is medium caramel with a fizzy 1 inch white head, no lacing. The aroma is sweet with lots of astringent alcohol. This beer is very sweet and has very hot alcohol, kinda out of balance. It finishes with dates and raisins. The body is medium and the carbonation is good. IMO this is a mess, too much alcohol, very overpowering. Maybe lay it down for a year, but I will not buy it again."
"Samichlaus Helles, in my humble opinion, is light years away from being the world's most extraordinary beverage. It's a decent sipper if you're into high-octane beer, but that's where it ends. I'm okay if Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg wants to wait another 21 years between bottlings."
"drinkability: Amazed at how smooth this monster is."
"Wow, great malt bomb. This stuff is very nice. Try it."
"Helles or doppelbock? I'm confused but I'm ok with that. Pours golden amber, clear and bubbly, with a head that quickly settles into a thin off-white covering. Smells like candied oranges, caramel, and a slight nuttiness. It smells good but like it may be too sweet. Let's find out. WOW! That is sweet. This could probably give diabetics a contact high. There is a woodiness, and then sweet. A hint of pepper, then just sugar syrup. Mouthfeel is syrupy with nice carbonation. Drinkability is just going to depend on you. Do you like your pancakes to be nothing but large sediment in a vat of light corn syrup? Then you're good. For me, not so much. It's like Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"". You want to experience all the legend has to offer, and now you have so you don't have to drink, er read, it again."
"D: Um....yeah. This beer is too over the top for its own good. The extreme alcohol heat and cloying sweetness make this beer a night cap at best."
"it's been a long time since i tasted the ""dunkel"" version, but i would love to taste them side by side"
"D-Not up to the standard set by regular Samichlaus, but it's worth trying with a few years on it."
"D- Strong but alcohol well hidden. Definitely a sipping beer. Slightly easier to drink that the original. Lighter and alcohol masked better. Sweeter."
"Poured out a bottle dated 2007, the burnt amber fluid produced minimal head, with a very slight ring of retention. Exceptionally sweet malty smell coaxes me to imbibe this strong doppelbock. Surprisingly at 14% abv, the alcohol has mellowed very well through the years to produce a sweet, slightly cloying and full bodied concoction balanced with good carbonation. Slightly sticky but by and large, very enjoyable for a beer of such potency."
"D: Too sweet and too strong to be drinkable, but still really good. Highly recommended, but not as good as the Classic."
"Pours an apricot-shade of orange... Minimal head, quickly fades. Carbonation tosses the yeast about for a few minutes before it settles down. Nose of a great doppelbock... Alcohol content clearly high, doing a good job hiding spicy hops. Picking up complexity of aromas: Raisins, plums, cherries, apples. Sweet start with fruity nose making a strong showing in the taste. Carbonation is decent throughout. Alcohol creates a bitterness in the finish, but becomes clandestine, showing up under a pleasant, bready aftertaste. Medium body. Alcohol presence increases slightly with warming. Drink one and you'll be good to go."
"got it at Ledger's Liqour in berkeley. they have them refrigerated and the labels are pretty moldy but who cares. iirc the bottling was 2008."
"D: If this had only 10-11% abv, I think it would be much better."
"Mmmm, all 14 % blonde doppelbocks should be this good!"
"Fairly similar to the other Samichlaus, but sweeter and lighter, maybe bordering on too sweet. I prefer the other, but this beer is an experience not to be taken lightly, worth trying at least once to say you did."
"I am able to enjoy a malt bomb. The more barleywine, the better, I always say. But I am having trouble locating anything positive about the taste profile of this malty brew. After the first sip, I braved one more, but then could not continue. The label proudly boasts, ""The world's most extraordinary beverage"". I, for one, would use a different adjective."
"The original Samichlaus is actually very good (as is Samichlaus Helles's cheaper counterpart, the Urbock 23), so I would emphatically recommend avoiding this beer."
"D-this is just too sweet to really enjoy. it has some nice flavors; but all of the sugar and sweetness in this make it almost difficult to drink. the huge abv is hidden very well, however."
"Definitely give it a try though!"
"Taste is a somewhat sweet with a warming alcohol undercurrent. Negligible carbonation and a slick, watery mouthfeel do little to excite the palate. Drinkability is respectable at 12%, but alcohol is noticeable as the brew warms. Worth a try, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Overall: A bit too sweet for me. OK brew. Able to finish the bottle, but will not be thirsting for another anytime soon."
"The taste is super sweet as well, with strong banana and malt prominence. Through the intensely sweet and syrupy-thick mouthfeel, the 14% of alcohol rapidly warms the mouth and throat. It is similar to drinking a sweet pastry (lol). Drinkability, for me, is less than ideal. The alcohol is a tad harsh, and the sweetness is near cloying."
"For a sipper, this one is good. As noted, the alcohol is well-concealed, and it's an easy one to sip on."
"d - Middle of the road for me. I enojoyed the smell more than the taste, as the alcohol came out a little too much in the taste and feel to me. I have one bottle left that is in my cellar that I plan on holding onto for a few years to see what happens, but right now I wouldn't look to drink it again."
"M + D: Body is a little thin, but fairly hot, giving it a chemical-quality... it's not horribly bad, but it doesn't seem to perform as well as its equally strong brother. I don't know if I'd readily go back for another... it seemed to lack some of the complexity that the other can showcase, and was something of a disappointment, ultimately."
"Edit: looking at other reviews, I get no ""caramel"" or toffee.. instead, it is just a verging on cloying pale maltiness."
"This is a delicious, rich, and decadent beer, but even after 3 years in the bottle, it still begs for more time. I bought a 4 pack, with the intention of enjoying 2 now, and 2 later. After having my first, and really enjoying it, I've decided to age all three of the remaining bottles for some time, as I think they'll be more enjoyable in the future."
"This beer isn't super easy drinking, but the overall complexity of the experience makes up for it. This is a great beer, and a super treat for anybody who can get their hands on one (or a few if you want to lay them down for a while)."
"My first impression of this beer was that it was a syrupy sweet, boozy mess. Big Karo syrup sweetness up front, followed by a pungent alcoholic bite. Flat bittering followed, wallowing in the sweet malt. Much as I was not engaged by the first few sips, I found myself nonetheless continuing to drink to conclusion. An odd disconnect between drinkability and overall flavor I am at a loss to explain."
"This is a brilliantly clear, orange beer that smells like raisins and booze, almost like a port. It's very boozy and syrupy, which is to be expected from a 14% beer. It has a honey, mildly hoppy aftertaste. It goes down pretty easy for a massively strong beer, but it has none of the crispness that you'd expect from a lager. I'm not sure what makes it a helles."
"D- I loved the initial malt flavor but couldnt take what it changed into. Definitely wouldnt have more than one in a sitting, I barely made it through this one."
"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into a snifter. Quarter inch head that lasts only seconds. Very clear beer with a light copper/amber color. Aroma is a very sweet baked pineapple. No hop character in nose. This beer smells like a dessert and should probably be served as a dessert beer. The taste is overwhelmingly sweet and one dimensional. Whatever hops were used in this beer are long gone, leaving only a lingering bitterness that can't compete with the residual sugars. Even the high alcohol content can't cut through the cloying sweetness. The mouthfeel is more thick and chewy than expected even for such a high gravity beer...more like a liqueur. As far as drinkability goes, I can barely get through one bottle. Better to split a bottle with friends (or uninvited guests) in sherry glasses. Good luck!"
"This beer was a bright orange color out of the bottle with a tiny layer of off-white head. The collar retention was good and the lacing was ok as well. The aroma was very complex with lots of Belgian yeast, toasted nuts, smoked meat, caramel malt and alcohol. The flavors were similarly full of elements, BIG candy sugar (probably used to cover up the hulking 14% ALC!), caramel malt, toffee, candied nuts, some oiled leather, dark fruits and, of course, boozy alcohol. The mouthfeel was average, the body was medium and the carbonation medium too. Tasty but very one dimensional. Just too sweet and alcoholic for my tastes."
"Medium to heavy body, silky, and quite drinkable. This would be a perfect dessert or after dinner beer."
"I'm really eager to try the Samichlaus classic I have in the cellar, but damn, if that is only half as good as this, it will still be the second best doppelbock I've had."
"Poured with a nice frothy head. This beer was reminiscent of Avery's ""Beast"" but much better. The nose was all booze, vanilla, cognac, corn syrup and grain. While others noted the taste wasn't complex, I had a different experience. Nice graininess, high alcohol which was warming and soothing, bourbon, vanilla bean, heavy caramel malt and sweet, sweet oak chips in the taste. I loved the high alcohol, I suppose the same people who make a sour face when drinking liquor straight might say this was too much. It was just right for me, very tasty, much to offer. Slick and oily mouthfeel with mellow carbonation-just right. This is like a V.S.O.P. version of the style. The cognac of beer no doubt. Would absolutely love a case of this. This is what a boss should drink."
"D - Yeah, one. One will do."
"D : I guess i should have cellared it first, could finish with great difficulty"
"I imagine this beer would age well, removed the warmth from the front end and mellow out the solvency of the flavors. This is a relatively young for a Sami."
"D - If looking for a strong ABV might look for this otherwise would not."
"Bottle states it was bottled in 2007 and states it as ""The World's most Extraordinary Beer"" so I had to buy it! Pours a real dark brown amber color with a small tan head. Smells very sweet and strongly of alcohol but I guess that should be expected with a 14% abv. Taste is very very sweet almost syrup like with a touch of roasted malts in there. Maybe if it was aged a few years longer it would be better but I think I'll pass on this in the future."
"It should be said that this is certainly not an everyday beer. It is an excellent dessert beer though. It's very easy to drink, but you'd regret drinking multiples in a single session."
"This tremendously malty, sip at, treat is quite nice and tropically set within a gooey mush of yummyness. It will warm any palate quickly and swim any head that drinks it down just as quickly, as it should."
"MF&D - as mentioned above, i think the drinkability will suffer because it is too sweet, maybe it should be a dessert beer. the feel is pretty good, right amount of carbonation and the body is just enough syrupy to be a x2 bock. I'm guessing that because it is the helles bock, the feel is a bit thinner. understandable, but not desirable."
"D - To me this beer is just over done. Too much alcohol, too much sweetness without any hop character."
"D- This beer is wonderful as a nightcap, but I couldn't have more than one in a sitting."
"Unfortunately, this beer wasn't what I was expecting. It poured a golden orange with a fizzy soda pop head that disappeared and I couldn't make it return, no matter how much swirling. I have to say, the smell was the best part. Honey, Euro hops, clove and alcohol ( it IS 14%). This beer is on fire, plenty of alcohol in the taste. Some honey and bread are all that were left. Thin and astringent in the mouth. I found it odd that a beer this strong could be watery. Some lingering cloying sweetness and fire in the belly. 14% but not a lot of depth. This one is ""one and done"". I would sample again, if offered, but it would have to be aged for 5-10 years."
"Overall I'd say that for a beer brewed 3 years ago this is still very young, if you've got a cellar going toss this down there for a few more years and give it another go. I wouldn't drink this fresh again."
"This is drinkable but the ABV is very apparent. Tastes & smells almost more like liquor than beer."
"Pours dark amber with little to no head. Malty aroma. Accents of malt, chestnuts, and pears. Alcohol makes a VERY strong presence at the finish. So sweet as to induce gagging. An unpleasant brew; felt like I was drinking cough syrup. On the other hand, I admire the bottle design."
"Poured from the bottle to my tulip glass, golden pour, tiny head that left a light lacing. Strong nose of malts...strong taste of alcohol and malts...however the lightness of the mouthfeel made is most enjoyable. I also detected a fruitiness in there mixed with the malts. A truly superb beer from start to finish, not for all to enjoy, only those with a true appreciation for the higher ABV's will appreciate this Helles."
"Smells of honey, tropical fruits, dried fruits, and even almonds or hazelnuts or similar. Licorice, caramel. Silky sweet, maybe too sweet, flavor. Palate is similar, orange, honey, hazelnuts... only add a touch of oak. The finish is more like an orange liquor than a brandy, a difference to the Samichlaus we all know. The only ""bad"" thing that I could find is that I would have like it a little less sweetness, but when you have a beer like this, who cares?"
"I'm not enamored by this one, but it's definitely a solid beer."
"The flavors definitely reveal themselves as this beer warms. Much more pronounced, but so is the big alcohol character of this beer. Very drinkable at 14%, but 2 is enough for anyone. There is no doubt, this beer warms from the inside out."
"One of my favorite beers. The foam was a light wheat/white which dissapated very quickly witha small ring afterwards. The color was nice golden honey with hints of red and orange in the light. Taste was exceptional - it was darker and heavier than percieved by color. It also had berry undertones. Smell - crisp, clean and a variety of exotic complex fruity hints. Mouthfeel was deep. Drinkibility - smooth and rich a nice aquired taste."
"A 750ml bottle shared with my wife. It didn't look like a doppelbock, being a pretty light amber color with a small white head. Caramel malt and honey aroma. The alcohol hits you in the face when you take a sip, followed by a strong malt presence, and a pervasive incredible sweetness. This beer was way too sweet, and the alcohol was way too intrusive. I doubt I'll be drinking this beer again."
"Conclusion: This is not something I'd drink often, but it would be quite nice to split with the lady after a nice meal"
"Not my favorite dopplebock and quite light in color for the style, originally thought this was a hopped up version of a Helles Lager and I seemed to be wrong after the very first sip I took, not in a hurry to drink this again, a little too strong in my opinion, worth trying"
"Pale colored beer with a thin, wispy white foam. Strong malt aroma hints of light golden fruits and caramel. Flavor is intensely sweet and intensely flavored. Nicely balanced, with well hidden alcohol, this beauty deliverers strong, complex malt notes of golden raisin, caramel and toffee. Should drink well for a decade."
"Picked up a single at half off pricing. I had the regular Samichlaus years ago and remembered it was sweet and that I took a nap afterwards. The Helles follows, very sweet but not cloying. No nap this time!"
"This is definitely a bit too sweet. I was expecting a malt bomb (good) but instead this seems like a sugar bomb (bad). I'm not sure how well it would age but I'm sure it'd be sickly sweet by then."
"Too sweet for me. I can barely finish this beer by itself. It would go well paired with something equally sweet. Not my favorite but worth a try."
"Overall? A good beer, not great. This would be a nice dessert beer to go with a cake or something. It's a little too sweet at the end, and a little less than sharp in the mouthfeel. But it is worth trying to see something different."
"Overall, about what I expected, and a good choice to loosen things up."
"Overall: I like this one better than its cousin. It has a spicy warming alcohol mouth feel. The finish is sweet and linger on the palate for a few moments. The is a very strong beer that will put u at one or two sheets."
"I just don't understand how both Samichlaus are rated with a measly B+! These are world class beers in my opinion, easily the two best Doppelbocks ever, and I've had quite a few. I can sum this beer up in a few word: I need more."
"D: A warm winter lager that lights you up like a Christmas tree. Cheers."
"Pours a light copper color with a ton of initial head, although it goes away quickly; no lacing, but a lot of lasting carbonation. Very deep scent, extremely malty with some caramal undertones and a hint of cinnamon; a very strong hint of alcohol. Deep taste, slight fruity esters to go with the deep malt and caramal notes, although the alcohol sticks out enough to take away from some of the flavor. Fairly rough due to its high ABV, although not as rough as it could be. A nice helles/dopplebock merger. The history of the beer is great, although the cost is pretty prohibitive (luckily this was a gift from a friend)."
"I really enjoyed this one, and wouldn't hesitate to drop some coin on some of these in the future."
"Tastes sweet, fruity and shows less of its alcohol than anticipated. A little too sickly sweet for my tastes. Syrupy mouthfeel. A very slow sipper. The alcohol isn't as difficult as the sweetness and really holds back the drinkability of this beer. Exciting concept that fails with me in practice"
"Very sweet, very drinkable for it's potency and a kick-ass brew to boot...worth the experience for sure."
"very nice brew, more of something to sip and not gulp. very warm on the way down."
"Huge beer, requires patience and determination to finish. Worth it, though."
"D: This is definitely a beer to be appreciated very slowly and infrequently. I didn't quite know what to expect from this one, and I have to say that I was surprised. I have another 11.2 oz bottle of this that I will probably let age for a couple more years. I cellared this one for about 11 months."
"Oh man. The finish is amazing. The banana/plantain thing comes in and out of focus for minutes after the sip. I'm going to go make some seared dry-rubbed Pollack and some red beans and rice to have with this!"
"Drinkability -- If it weren't for the obvious -- and detrimental -- alcohol heat and astringency that overwhelms the rest of the drinking experience, maybe it'd be more drinkable. As it is, this stuff is very difficult to finish, even when sipped slowly. Certainly not a drain pour-type of beer, but probably just a beer that's not ""ready"" yet. Let these babies sit in your cellar (or on the retailer's shelves) for a year or two before popping one open."
"Deliciously delicate and hard-hitting. A must-have for any fan of big, malty brews, and for fans of Doppel- and Eisbocks alike. Doppelbock is really a misnomer, as the Triple Bock designation given in Don Russell's book ""Christmas Beer"" is much more appropriate for a Bockbier this huge."
"The mouthfeel is very full, the bite of the gingery spiciness combined with the sweet fullness of the creamy cherry-spice flavor make this a fantastic holiday treat. I hope to enjoy each year. Cheers St. Nick!"
"An interesting beer, though I'm not sure I'd want to order it again. The combination of sweetness and high alcohol is just too much, and make this a difficult beer to drink."
"Drinkability: Well, what do you expect with a 14.0% abv beer? I enjoyed this one very slowly, perhaps over an hour and a half, so I don't feel too terribly buzzed, but you really gotta be careful with this one - I can't classify a beer I had to take an hour and a half to savor as ""drinkable."" Nonetheless, it's a fairly tasty and definitely interesting concoction, and though it's not something I'm gonna buy a four-pack of so I can whip one out after mowing the lawn, it's still something you should try at least once."
"Definitely worth a try here. Reminds me a bit of an Old Ale and other high abv styles, which I haven't been a big fan of, yet this is certainly well crafted and impressed me. Really nice if you're in the mood for it."
"Pours a pinkish blush color with miniscule white head that dissapears very quickly. Sweet aroma of alcohol, cherry and candi sugar. Very sweet tasting with cherry, grape, sugar cane notes and a very strong alcohol presence. This beer is not very flavorful and the strong alochol warmth makes it not very quaffable."
"Pours a clear caramel with no head or bubbling Makes me think cognac, not a dopplebock. Very cool looking. Caramel drizzled strawberries, pears, and peaches with a spanking of alcohol that makes presence known, but is well intergrated. Carameled and sugared peaches starts the flavor off right. Lots of other soft yet sugary sweet fruits dance around the palate with a turbocharge of alcohol. Lots of sweetness with this palate, very syrupy.The alcohol helps cu the iscociy a little. Any bitterness you notice is not from hops, but the 14% abv. Great sipping beer. One of the best sipping lagers I've ever had."
"This poured a clear light copper with a bit of white head. It smelled like an old ale, with heavy honey wheat and and molasses and alcohol, with some apricot hops. It tasted much bigger than the Dunkel or Urbock, like very sweet honey and caramel and cane sugar, with a bit of barley, pineapple, new oak and alcohol. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a sweet aftertaste with a bit of alcohol warming. Overall this was borderline too sweet but was otherwise very tasty. It was clean and had a nice body. The big flavor and noticeable alcohol makes this a definite sipping beer. This was very much like an old ale, which is one of my favorite styles. But I wonder if age would make this one too sweet?"
"The flavor is doppelbockesque with a thick, rich, malt base that has a high-octane orange charge in it. What the brewer has mastered though is the blending of the big alcohol and the sweetish malts. It's like a liquid malt love of some kind. Either way it is an amazing production and as a helles DB in a class all by its lonesome self. This is actually one of my favorite beers of all time."
"D: I generally prefer that the beers that I drink do not burn my sinuses. With that being said I'll pass on this next time, or at cellar for many years before attempting to drink it again."
"Apparently, this is a lighter version of this beer for the American market - time will tell if this works, though I can't imagine that anyone but beer enthusiasts buys this lager and they are not going to be put off by a heavier beer. Personally, I don't think this matches the original beer and I think I'll stick to that but I'm interested to see how their experiment works out."
"Drinkability- Alcohol is nicely hidden in this one. Really hard to keep from chugging this rather than sipping. Super easy to drink. Will have again in the future. $4.99 price tag."
"Pours a clear amber/golden, decently sized white head for the ABV forms, quickly settles to a thin ring, no lacing, some legs on the glass, looks nice. Smell is very sweet and boozy, candi sugar, corny syrup, caramel, alcohol, lots of sweet tropical fruits, a bit buttery, bready, but very sweet, melons, not too bad. Taste is similar, very sweet, sugary, candy, melons, tropical mango and grilled pineapple, alcohol is actually pretty well restrained, bit of malt comes through in the middle, some butterscotch, bit of bready, spicy alcohol finish, lots of fruit. Mouthfeel is thick, very full bodied, almost syrupy, low carbonation, big alcohol heat but not as bad as I would have thought, in line with the regular Samichlaus which amazed me too with how easy it is to drink. The helles is a bit hotter like malt liquor, kind of tastes like a more refined version of Max Ice, but isn't too bad for the ABV."
"D: This is 14%? Man, perfect for dessert. Forget port, pick some of this up instead. Again, this is 14%? I knew it going in and I know it now, but geez, it doesn't taste like it."
"D: The lighter cousin of Samichlaus, definitely a good beer, even if I prefer the darker version. In my opinion, definitely recommended."
"Overall, I think this is an ok beer and it makes for a decent evening beer given it's sweetness and high abv. I'd recommend it for a try."
"The flavor is of high alcohol and big fruit. I would love to drink another, but 1) I don't have another one and 2) I don't think I could get the cap off - this one hits kinda hard. Drink this one slowly and carefully by the fire or after a huge meal - this would be a great digestive."
"D: This is like drinking maple syrup directly from the bottle. Its a taste bomb but only tolerable in moderate amounts."
"How is this a doppelbock? Imperial Maibock is more like it, although that's just my own silly interpretation. Whatever the case, don't pick up the red-label Helles if you're expecting the normal Samichlaus--this ain't it (and that's better). It's enjoyable to some degree and there's something to be said for being able to make an 11.2 oz. bottle last some 90 minutes or so. Proceed with caution--it's not the greatest of the big classic big beers."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability: Would take either one of us a long while to finish an entire bottle. We split it which worked out ok, but neither one of us wanted another. Sweetness is sickening at times, and alcohol is extremely high. This was more of a novelty than anything."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Overall, nearly undrinkable."
"Drinkability - I am wondering how easily I am going to finish this one. Not nearly as easy to drink as the regular Samichlaus, and the bitterness doesn't really sit very well. I'm glad I found it to try it, but I will stick to the regular one."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Definitely dry finish on the palate. Lighter on the palate than one expects for a doppelbock, carbonation, the color and the clarity of this brew lead to this impression. Medium bodied. This is one that I'm glad I've had the opportunity to try, but I doubt that I'll reach for it again anytime soon. There are much better out there....just nothing all that great about this brew, nothing to pull one back to it time and time again."
"Good. Not as good as samichlaus, I don't think. My memory of the other... From just last night... Had the malt flavors as being a lot more complex. This seems like, well, a helles version of the same beer. Weird. I mean, it's good and I'd definitely drink it again, but I'd rather have the other one, I think. I suppose I'll have to buy both again and compare side by side to really know. Maybe. Anyway, seems to have less mouthfeel and even less bitterness. Still rich and thick with a complex malt profile. Still sweet and smooth. My wine-drinking buddies said that it tastes like a nice Sauternes."
"D - More like a beefed up Helles than the dopplebock listed on BA. Very sweet with a good touch of alcohol. I wonder how this would do with some time to mellow."
"The drinkability of this beer is pretty low. All alcohol and no flavor. I can detect the ""Munich Helles"" behind it, but it's not as subtle as I would like."
"This is a wonderful beer, I think a bit of age on the bottle would help remove some of the harsh alcohol aromas from the nose, but the flavor was wonderful..."
"Worth trying, but if it has to be one or the other I'd go for the Bier."
"Body is big, sticky, and slick. The sugars make my lips stick together. Limited drinkability due to the ass-kicking strength."
"Suggestions of herbal hops and alcohol lead off the palate, but are quickly overwhelmed by sweet, sugary malts. Rummy fruits and rich honey sweetness dominate. Chewy and almost cloying, with hints of vanilla, tropical fruits, and cotton candy. Avoids being too cloying with some warming alcohol and some cooked vegetable flavors in the finish. A big, warming, dessert beer! Similar to regular Samichlaus, but maybe missing some of the depth and carameliness of the original."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"If not for the easily identifiable alcohol, this would be rated higher, guess I'll need to buy another bottle to age and see if it mellows out."
"Pours golden with very little head. What head there is fades to nothing very quickly. Very malty aroma, quite honeyed and bready. Quite sweet with some definite heat and some lingering spicy bitterness on the finish. Up front it is quite smooth abd honeyed, a bit like nougat. Very smooth, but a bit hot in the mouth. This is fairly pleasant, but I find it a bit more one dimensional than the regular Samichlaus."
"D: for a high alcohol beer, I find it to be very drinkable"
"Had this as a night cap last night and man did it help me sleep easy.Poured into a pokal a full rich clear golden with a minimal head wich was to be expected,whoo the sweet alcohol really hits in the nose with some caramel and grain but the alcohol shows itself in a huge way.A full bodied sweeter sipping brew,it has a big caramel and fruit flavor with sweet burning alcohol showing thru more as it warmed,in the finish a passing vegetal note comes thru.A decent brew but its made to be drank slow and easy."
"Appearance is slightly hazy orange with a frothy white head that lingers for a moment then settles in a ring around the glass. Faint smells of bready malt with notes of cherries and raisins in the background. Noble hops finally appear as the beer warms up a bit. Tastes much more upfront with loads of bready malt blended with flowery noble hops. Medium to medium-full body balanced decently with moderate carbonation and you can definately detect that 14% ABV with a decent alcohol warmth as you swallow, but it's not a harsh finish at all. Overall a nicely balanced beer for such a high ABV and definately worth seeking out."
"Finish is warming with plenty of alcohol presence."
"D: Enjoyed more sips then didn't. Due to the heft and oiliness of the beer I can't see having to many in one sitting. Plus with the 14% you might not be able to stand after 2 bottles. Very good after dinner beer as a desert."
"The super sweetness makes this one a tough drink."
"A very sweet brew that has enough ABV to really kick your ass. Alcohol presence is not nearly what you would expect from a 14% beer that can't hide behind strong ingredients (like hops). Decent, but the regular Samichlaus is far more interesting."
"A subtle twist on the standard Samichlaus with a lighter color, and more finess in the malts, but with a lot of fruity character comming throughout. A standard pilsner-straw color comes through with light carbonation and with only a trace of head formation and retention. Aromas are strong of pilsner malt, honey, and zinfindale. No real sulfers or corn flavors, so pretty clean upfront, just a lot more estery than expected from a lager. Flavors jump on the peach, pear, mango, appricot, papaya flavors and wonder into a mead-like / zinfindale acidity and alcohols. An herbal hop flavor is noticed in the aftertaste and provides low-lying bitterness. Very syrupy and viscously textured while warming the mouth into numbness. Light on fusals. Finishes with a long, sweet linger of fruitiness, sugars, and herbal tea."
"Drinkability is fantastic for the ABV & pretty good for the style, nice digestive/nightcap dopple, not one to trifle with or to attempt to session on! Next time I see it I will buy more & hide them from myself & see how the aging improves or doesn't this fine dopple"
"Definitely a sipper of a beer, strong Juju Magic here. This is OK but at $8 for the bottle, I will be drinking Firestone Union Jack a lot more than this one."
"Tastes good. The alcohol balances the caramel sweetness perfectly. This is a slow sipper and sweet but not cloying or over the top sweetness. The mouthfeel is rich and carbonated. Drinkability is good for such an abv powerhouse. Over a long evening, I would welcome 2 of them but probably regret it later. In all, a very tasty beer, ideal for a nightcap or winter warmer."
"From a 750ml swing top bottle. Pours a clear pale amber color with minimal head/lacing/cap. The aroma is somewhat faint, notes of juicy fruit and white wine. The taste is sugary sweet, some honey and a bit of berry fruit but really just a sugary alcohol bomb. The feel is light and quite fizzy, very slick and sticky, finishes very sweet and suprisingly astringent. The drinkability is very limited with this one. If you are looking for an after dinner brew, maybe 6oz this might be a fine selection but other than that this is almost undrinkable. Very sweet and the alcohol is not hidden, no malt or hops to help mask the booze. Not all that good. Not sure how dopplebock was decided upon, maybe the first uber imperial helles lager??"
"While it isn't as interesting as the darker stuff, this bright beer is a lethal alcohol delivery system thanks to its incredible drinkability. Treat this bottle with respect and enjoy!"
"This is a sipper. I shared this with 3 people. Don't know if I would be able to down an entire bottle myself"
"A slow, slow sipper. A bit raw, maybe aging would mellow the sharpness of it. Interesting to a degree, though not in a complex way. I didn't enjoy this as much as the other Samichlaus."
"M/D: Medium bodied, semi-high carbonation, alcohol is there obviously. Drinkability is fair. Not as good as the other Samichlaus dopplebock."
"Overall, a very pleasant beer. Definitely an easy way to get drunk."
"HV"
"Drinkability: Many of these high ABV beers are a joy to drink and deftly hide their alchol amidst a truly succulent taste. The Samichlaus Helles is neither of those! As with its darker brother, hopefully some time locked away will bring some sense to it."
"Drinkability: a malty high alcohol beer that is a very slow sipper. One is enough in any session."
"Overall, this is not a beer I'd pursue ever again. Yes, it's undeniably complex, but the taste is a little on the tough side."
"Overall, it's remarkably well done. The alcohol is kept in check, and it's balanced. The flavor is rich and satiating, but not cloying. (This is truly ""liquid bread""). The appearance is great, but the head could be much better; and the aroma is right on. Worth trying! I could even see using this as a cordial at a Christmas dinner. Very nice."
"11.2oz bottle poured into a chalice. Pours a golden orange color with a very thin white head that quickly disappears. The aroma features some malt, a touch of caramel and a good whiff of alcohol. The taste to no surprise starts out smooth and malty and finishes with a warming alcohol punch. I am not a huge fan of this offering, it is just not my thing."
"Red label Samichlaus Helles was picked up in a 12 oz., brown bottle, and poured into a goblet. The beer came out fizzy and developed almost no head, but the body was a crystal clear, pale gold. The smell was quite a fruity and alcoholic treat. Lots of pears, apples, and grapes on the nose, soaked in cognac. The taste was warm, sweet, and ... well it was hard to get past the sweet. The spices (anise and pepper), vanilla, and fruits were all drizzled in lots of powdered sugar. Some might find this level of sweetness cloying, but I found the strong countering by the drying alcohol a sufficiently palatable combination. As I got further along, some hop bitterness showed up as well. Very richly textured, and oh so warming. Some might consider this a good fireside sipper, but I'd be beware of igniting the vapors. Fits all the classic definitions of a cellarable a beer, and I sure will be stashing away some for a decade or more to get it to peak."
"Very drinkable for a 14% abv beer"
"Looks a clear gold, without much head retention. The aroma is of white grape and sweet, bready malt. The flavor and mouthfeel is rough to say the least. There's a strong, dry alcohol flavor, in line with watered-down vodka. The malt just comes off like a very concentrated light lager with caramel malt ad a touch of grassy hops. It's not all-out offensive, but I won't be finishing this one. I'll return to this one after I let a bottle mellow for a year or two."
"Prosit Und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Highly recommended..."
"Very nice brew, easy to drink even with the booze wallop - but the $17 for a 4-pack of 11.2ozs puts a hurt on the wallet."
"Pretty good in small doses, but know what you're getting."
"Overall: An interesting experience...but really makes you appreciate some high ABV beers that do a better job of hiding it. This definitely needs some time in the bottle."
"A nice beer to sip on a cold evening. For malt lovers only!"
"D: A great beer, yet I like the doppelbock version a bit more. The alcohol is certainly there but it's not overpowering, strangely enough. This is like a beer-brandy. Great nightcap."
"Bottle from City Wide in South Bend. Pours golden orange to yellow. Soda like bubbles ringing the outside. Laces like a scotch. Odor is fruity, clean. hints of teak, apples, mild cherry, brandy. Taste is burning, warming alcohol, grapes, raspberry and sweet toffee. Alcohol is almost a flavor in itself. Sweet malt backbone. The whole thing seems understated, but at the same time huge and demanding. Mouthfeel is syrupy and thick, like congealing Jell-O. Overall its a sipper, a beer liquor. Warming a smooth and pretty impressive."
"D:Great considering it was 14% alcohol. It did not taste hot at all. Definitely something that can get me in trouble."
"Still good, but I'd take the original over this one any day. Also, in a blind test, doppelbock would not come to mind. More like an old ale (but obviously it isn't an ale)."
"2007 bottling with the red and silver label as pictured. Pours a clear pale yellow body with a skimpy white head that quickly falls into a film. Aroma is malty and bready with some phenolics that suggest a Dogfish Head 120. Some vague floral hops. Medium body with a somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Malty and earthy taste with some floral hops. Warming alcohol is very whiskey like. A nice sipper on a winter night but I prefer the regular Samichlaus to this Helles. This one could use some more aging."
"This is definitely a good beer, although I don't see how it's all that much different from the regular Samichlaus (besides the color). I guess I'll have to force myself to do a side-by-side at some point. Nonetheless, this is a good beer to end an evening and a must-try for lovers of strong beers. Recommended."
"D = Depends what you want. This is clearly a good beer, but it is very strong. I think it needs some time to age before drinking, right now (1 year old) it is too sharp, but next year I wll happily try this again (and put next year batch down to rest)."
"I am by NO means a Helles Bock expert, so this is my mucho ignorant review. a transparent gold/amber color, no head just a haze here and there. smells very sweet borderline barley wine smell. tastes like a weak barley wine sweet, tangy, but not a ""whoa"" neck-twisting finish. the mouth-feel is kind of tart, a nice kind of tart though, and a bit crisp as well. as for drinkability it's not such a quick drinker, or a multiple bottle in a night kind of beer. i will drink this again, but in about 5 to 10 years, once it has had time to mature."
"Pours a thin clear lager yellow with little to no head. nose is of an intense lager. The taste is very very interesting. It is very thin up front but quickly turns to some dark fruit taste (didnt expect that) This is very tasty and has almost a barleywine sugar taste to it. The mouthfeel is nice and thick and the aftertaste lingers forever!! I actually occasionally prefer this to samichlaus. Good brew, should do great in my cellar."
"D - For the high alcohol content, this was a smooth drink...but dangerous."
"Light honey/ gold color with virtually no head and little carbonation. The aroma was that of sweet malt and alcohol. My girlfriend (the veterinary technician) claimed she smelled male rat musk. Hmm. Serious rubbing alcohol flavor bringing up secondary aromas of new band-aids. As the beer warmed up there was a more pronounced flavor of honey/ mead, and then aroma turned into an urban alley frequented by beer drinking bladder relievers. There was good and bad in this. I don't think it wise for a beer with so much alcohol to be attempted with such lighter malts, as all manner of trouble shows through."
"I couldn't drink more than two of these in an evening, but for its strength it's an easy beer to drink. Urbock 23 on steroids. I hope that Eggenberg keeps making this one."
"Pours medium gold, very clear, and with a medium but quickly fading head. Aroma is almost pure malt, very little hops, but some. Alcohol does come through, although very cleanly, in the aroma. Palate is full, and appropriate. Flavor is a wonderful malty, alcoholic and very clean beer. Uber-maibock anyone?"
"Quite an interesting brew, and one I'll certain to keep around for winter and spring."
"Drinkability: well, i would be hard pressed to drink more than three of these...if only for the fact that walking would be slightly difficult afterwords...I am currently half-way through one and the feeling in my throat is starting to remind of the days when i drank scotch on a regular basis. I will say that this is a prime example of a Helles on steroids, it is much boozier, and certainly a bit sweeter than i would expect of an Helles, but other than that it does remain true-to-form (so well as I know the style) and if half of one didn't make me as tipsy as this one has, i would really be in the mindset of drinking a few of these...."""
"Last brewed in 1986, I hope they keep release this beer yearly from now on."
"Ok so I saw this one on the shelf and was a little curious. At first I by passed it as it looked the same as a regular but then noticed it was a special edition so I had to pick one up. It poured a nice pale golden yellow with a smallish head that faded quickly. The aroma was full of malt and grass like smells with a touch of alcohol, but that is to be expected. The flavor was much sweeter then I thought it would be with a nice rounded caramel tone a good amount of brandy like alcohol thrown in. Some bready and cereal like malt base making up the rest with a sweet sugary finish that was sprikled with a touch of floralness. Overall this was a good bit different then the normal, seemed to be a bit sweeter, defintly lighter looking and a touch hotter with the alcohol. Very intresting find and will have to go back to the store and grab a couple more."
