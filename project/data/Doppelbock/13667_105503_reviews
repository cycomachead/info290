"O- a good doppelbock.  I would love this in the restaurant with some cheesecake."

"Wonderfully clean and malty, pure silky sweet, excellent example of the style."

"I'm not a huge fan of doppelbocks, but this offering from Starr Hill is, IMHO, exceptional. The appearance is a bit off in that it is a bit too dark for the style, but the clarity and fine wreath of persistant foam are perfect. The aromq is a bit understated, but, with a nice swirl in my hand-warmed goblet stimulated a beatiful caramelly malt cloud. Very appropriate. The flavor is what aces this beer for me. Very well balanced between a rich malty sweetness balanced by a spicy but gentle hop backbone snd a dry mouthfeel. Speaking of that, many doppels are syrupy or teacley, but not this one. Again, bery nice balance of dryness, spice, and malty sweet ess with a touch of caramel. The finish is clean and dry. Well done!"

"Sweet and malty, with some caramel and licorice notes."
"Overall... wow.  This one is one of the few beers so far that really amazed me the first time I had it, and it's just as tasty as I remembered the second time around.  Yeah, this is good stuff.  Definitely one of my favorite beers so far, and by far my favorite from the Starr Hill variety pack.  If the fact that this is only rated ""good"" on here--rather than ""very good"" or ""outstanding""--means that other doppelbocks I haven't tried yet are EVEN BETTER, then I'll definitely have to seek out more in this style in the future."

"Nice dark tasty good sipping beer."

"Overall:  I really, really like this beer.  It’s a massive malt bomb, which I’m a fan of, nicely sweetened and flavorful.  Highly recommended for fans of malt."

"Overall this is a Doppelbock that has neither the rich nutty taste nor the strong malts of other Doppelbocks."
""
"O: Easy enough to drink and enjoyable but not exceptional - probably would not go for it again but not unhappy to have tried it. Alcohol is well hidden."
"O -"

"Mouthfeel: Medium+ body, sticky for a lager."
""
"Very bitter not a pleasant after taste.  It was drinkable but for me it wasn't enjoyable.  This is a one and done for me."
"12/19...pours medium dark brown, very little foam and the finish is still. Stale malt nose, small dark fruit. Sweet cherry vanilla taste, sneaky carbonation and then a right turn to a toffee malt close. Rum raisin? Light bodied."

"Good, warm, winter flavor and smell"

"Great beer, enjoyed bottled and tapped. Too bad I can't get it all the time around me."

"Pours a nice deep caramel color with decent head and lacing. Aroma is of sweet caramel and malts, quite nice. Taste is good with hints of caramel and a good mix of malts. Overall, feels good going down and is a quite easily drinkable doppelbock. Nice Job !!"

"Good body, excellent head retention and lacing.  Very soft mouthfeel, makes it very enjoyable."

"aroma slightly sweet, black cherry, root beer, a little spice.  flavor notes are hints of sugar, coacoa, cinnamon, vanilla, licorice.  some floral notes detected"
"Pour one and a half bottles into a half liter stein a deep roasted chestnut color with a blooming light beige head atop.Caramel and toast in the nose with a light tinge of iron.Buttery caramel flavors with more of the toast,some dark fruit is detected in the finish.The finish is a little thin wich takes away from a pretty good flavor profile.Honestly not bad."

"After tipping over a cornhole players beer i bought this for him. great flavor"

"A screw-top bottle made it easier for me to get started but I was startled when I got foam coming through the neck right afterwards. I quickly began the pour and I got some pseudo-cascading action as it generated some tawny head. Head retention was very low, however, and quickly turned into a skim of wisps atop the beer. Color was a dark-brown with ruby highlights (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was sugary malty sweet with an alcohol burn that tickled my nostrils. This may get me where I am going in one quick hurry! Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was of caramel, anise, malt husks and of course, a little bit of alcohol burn for good measure. Man, but this was super sweet as compared to the AIPAs that I usually drink and I began to sweat as a result. Finish was sweet, no two ways about it and the alcohol burn was literally breathtaking in the throat. Phew! One of these at a time, please. No wonder the monks could be held over all day after one. Bro. Woody has spoken."

"O: Overall pretty decent flavor wise, nice finish, decent, and perhaps a few shades light of a good recommendation but nothing to get to finicky about."

"O-not terrible, but not nearly as full-flavored as its German originators."
""

""

"O: I like this doppelbock. It lacks the complexity of say... a Celebrator but it's a very nice beer. I would like to see it a hair bit dryer but I would buy this again."
"O: For better or worse, this is a lighter doppelbock. It's not bold, but it's easy to drink. It's only problem is there are a couple other examples out there that ARE bold, while retaining its drinkability. I wouldn't put this one on my ""must purchase again"" list, that's for sure."

"Good beer, true to style. A tad on the lighter side for doppelbocks, but they didn't skimp. Really thought this was a good approximation of the style. If you're a fan of the style, then you should check this beer out."
"pours a clear ruby brown color, not really any head. sweet and nutty aroma, all malt, no hops as expected for the style. taste is one note - slightly sweet caramel malt. okay flavor. lower carbonation, full mouthfeel, but still drinks easy."
"Not at the top of it's class, but a pretty good brew. There's enought going on to keep it interesting. I'd try it again."

" This strong bock has a nice malt flavor which is in the dark caramel and toffee range with some slight chewy raisiny flavors and mild yeast elements in the taste add to the enjoyment with subtle spice and an almost cereal like toastiness. I think this is a decent bock, pretty apparent strength wise in the taste, but enough malt to fit the bill and pretty clean lager characteristics-I would have this again."

"Overall – Nothing too special here. It is a decent run of the mill doppelbock."

"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours dark with an dark amber color when held up to the light. Head is a caramel color and about a quarter of an inch but dissipates rather quickly. Typical double bock style with a malty flavor and pretty low carbonation. However this beer has a sort of spice that lingers on the back of my tongue. I can taste some chocolate and some bread. Troeginator is one of my favorites and if I had to compare Snow Blind to it I would say that they are similar but that Troeg's just tastes a little better. Still a great beer though."

"I understand what Starr Hill was going for on there season Snow Blind offering. I think they nailed the overall taste and finish of the beer. Very delicate and complex upfront and great going down. Almost too smooth for a dopplebock. The biggest detractor was nose at first sip. The caramel aroma was weak and had a slightly off aroma to it. If smell is not very important to you this beer is perfect for a late nightcap by the fireplace."

"O: my first few steps I liked it, it had a spiciness of a winter beer. The taste didn't grow on me though. There are some interesting flavors, and it does fit the seasonal style, but my palette was left wanting a little more body."
""
""
"Overall, a slightly sweet take on the doppelbock style, not bad just could be a little less sweet for my liking; flavors are appropriate and strength is good."
