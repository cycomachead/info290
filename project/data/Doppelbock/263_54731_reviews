"I appreciate the beer but am not as big a fan of this one.  Would not turn it down if offered one, and might even grab one once in a while for a change of pace."
""
"Someone else has said this is like a bbq in a bottle . . . And it is. But I like it. Smokey with a capital S ! I honestly, this would go great with some wings."
"Great in the glass at the Schlenkerla Tavern watching the tourists blunder about and great from the bottle in the USA poured int a snifter to enjoy!  Recommended!"
"Ummm...Bar-b-que in a bottle..."
""
"Very smoky, but very good."
""
"Overall: It's a very nice and unique beer especially if you consider the smoke flavor and aroma. For this reason alone I would say give it a shot. It's not the malty sweet caramel Doppelbock you are probably used to, but it is its own beast. The spicy quality of the beer wins a merit on their own. This is a great beer to pair with food. Have fun with it."
""
"The flavor profile is near World Class.  It is reasonably intense, a bit complex and exceptionally well balanced.  It begins with a burst of oak smokiness that lacks the meaty aspects of the nose, that slowly blends, rather than fades, with a rich underlying sweetness.  Both caramel and biscuit notes are present.  Here is where the rich malts of a doppelbock kick in.  In the middle, a balancing mild bitterness emerges over a vanilla note.  The finish is a slow fade of oak smoke and sweetness with a slight note of alcohol."
""
"Overall: My first encounter with a Schlenkerla, and assuredly not my last. I'd call this more of a rauchbier than a doppelbock, as the primary characteristic is the smoke - there's nowhere near the level of bready, toffee, caramel, nutty, or dark fruit flavors I would associate with a doppelbock, nor the sticky mouthfeel. I greatly enjoy this beer, but I am forced to rate it as a doppelbock because that's how it's classified, and therefore that's the style-specific ranking it will appear in. Were this lumped in as a rauchbier, use of oak instead of beech notwithstanding, my rating would be far higher - easily over a 4 in every category."

"Heavy smoke and oak flavor, smooth but too strong of flavors"

"Overall: A magnificent beer, and one of the best from Schlenkerla that I've reviewed so far. The smoke character in this one is much similar to the one in the Urbock-- it is not 'meaty' like the Märzen. A great beer and one that I found is very approachable for the style. Looking forward to trying the rest of the Schlenkerla repertoire."

"O: It's not the smoke I mind, it's the alcohol bitterness and the heavy mouthfeel.  It's pretty rough, not very smooth.  Will take some effort to finish."
""
"Oak, smoked sausage, leather, tobacco. The smoke is what it is. I'm not the biggest fan, but I can appreciate that this beer is well done. The Doppelbock underneath is a bit too sweet and one-dimensional and cannot fully stand up to the smoke. Needs food to pair it with, something that's very big and savory, but not too sweet in itself."
"O: [4.00] I have had one other smoked beer, from Germany, and it was over the top.  This one is nicely balanced with more malt character.  I really enjoyed this one.  Very crisp and refreshing.  No sense of alcohol burn, no drying or bittering.  I think you could session a few of these."

"Pours a cloudy brown color.  One inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of strong smoke, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, and a hint of wheat.  Fits the style of a Doppelbock.  Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level.  Tastes of slight alcohol, strong smoke, sweet malt, slight wood, hint of pale malt, and a hint of wheat.  Overall, good appearance, simple aroma that is mostly smoke, great feel, and good body."

"O: 4.5 - This would be a very good beer without the smoke. With it, it's great."
""
""
""
""
" The flavor is rich with malt flavors with slight smoke on entry and sweet nutty flavor with light hop in the taste balancing some toffee in the middle with caramel and mild brown sugar with a slight fruitiness in the yeast with a slight dried apricot and mild bready toasted flavor adding to a slight cinnamon and vanilla accent with slight golden raisin type sweet and earthy flavor. There is a mild aromatic smoke in the dark fruity and woody finish which is not downplayed at all and compliments the layers of malt with slight taste of alcohol in the mostly dry finish.  Overall this is wonderful and I think the oak smoke in the dopplebock fits very well with truly delicious results.  A great example of how smoke can enhance and already great example of the dopplebock style -enjoyable in its subtlety yet fully flavored and rich w/ out any alcohol in the flavor which makes it deceptively drinkable and the smoke perfectly implemented in the aroma and flavor. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys smoked beer, strong lager or a dopplebock fan"
""
""
"O – The smoke really defies the doppelbock category, but otherwise is a great example of the base style.  Smoke is mild enough to allow its inclusion, but it’s a unique entry.  Very good beer, seems to accomplish its intended goal very well."
"It is their christmas brew but i think it could be great in early spring or fall"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice malty doppelbock with the twist of adding the smoked meat and sausage spices to the brew.  This one is definitely an interesting brew for those wanting to venture off the beaten path from your standard doppelbock."
"Overall, this is just a great beer."
"Smoked taste takes a lot of place. Unfortunately, the doppelbock side is quite hidden."
""

"O: Really awesome and original. Never had a beer like this at all, and wasn't disappointed."
"Syrupy, full-bodied, utterly balanced."

"Love the oak smoke malt flavor. Great cloudy color and awesome nose. Would be perfect wish some smokey pulled pork with a nice South Carolina vinegar dipping sauce."
""
"Overall this is a fantastic beer and well worth drinking.   I cannot recommend it enough.  I will definitely be drinking this one again."
""
""
""
"Had so much promise on the nose; lots of character but it just feels muffled. Still a fascinating palate, I have to give kudos for the complexity."

""
""
"Food match: Triamisu [if you haven't figured this out by now I am totally making this shit up]."
""
"Smoke is far more prevalent in the aroma than the flavor, which is actually fairly balanced. Would be a little sweet for a doppelbock, but the smoky notes prevent that from being noticed."

"A pretty deft application of the rauchbier treatment to a big doppelbock, the German version of overt style blending, I guess. Everything comes off well enough, the smoke having its way with my palate, before ceding the floor to the equally sturdy, strong like bull, base lager. Once again, a tad scary at first contact, but by the end, it's got me wondering about the times when all beer tasted at least a bit like this."
"Another excellent addition to the Schlenkerla lineup. Sweet malt accented with the deep smoked malts, reminiscent of smoked meats. Copper body with small creamy head, fine carbonation and lots of suspended particulates. Aroma of wood smoke (from a fire), taste comes in with sweet malt and smoked meats. Abrupt finish with some lingering smokiness. Rauchbiers are an acquired taste, but this is a fine example."
"The taste is alive with smoked cheese and smoked goodness. Caramel malts and mild hops seem secondary. I love beers with a good smoked quality and this one really does the trick. I could have it multiple times."
"World class smoke beer. Well brewed and nicely done. Would definitely drink again as I'm a big fan of this style."

"Pours a nice dark amber that looks almost ruby reddish given the right light. Nice lacing. Smell of smoke is not as intense as the darker cousin. Tons of white particles. This beer has substance and is alive! Lots of faint fruitiness. Tastes great and not too heavy. A nice summer smokey alternative to the darker beer. Great beer!"

"Served in short glasses, at a tasting. Very nice appearance. Not a beer I would drink every day, but very unique! The smokiness was overpowering at times (leave subtleness out in this one!), and agreed from previous comments that this is best had ice cold. I would buy again for a group tasting to get a variety of opinions. Glad to have tried this one."

"Overall a great doppelbock and smoked beer. Definitely recommend if you like this style."
""
"Oak Smoke is another outstanding beer from Schlenkerla. The smoke is more subdued than most of their offerings, besides the hells, and therefore more approachable. This even handedness with the smoke allows the bready sweetness to shine through so the base can be enjoyed as well. Recommended."
"O: i believe this to be a great approach on a doppelbock, it gives it an extra ""spicyness"" to the flavor profile and at the same it allows the doppelbock to be a doppelbock. For 8% this is a brew i would definitely go back to again and again given the right circumstances."
"Overall, one of the best smoked beers I have tasted. A classic German smoked beer. look for it."
""
"O: Change of pace beer to have once in a very long while, but I only got halfway through the pint, and am not interested in coming back anytime soon."

"Highly enjoyable."

"Lack of head/poor lacing detracts from the appearance, but served closer to 50 degrees the head is quite nice. Another good rauch from Bamberg."

"Sharp and sturdy brew."

"Mahogany colored with minimal, yellowish-tan head. Smells of oak smoke, ash-pit, pine, strong aroma fills the nose, pungent smell which permiates the nose wuickly. Tast is similar to smell, yet even more smokier, tastes like a beef jerkey stick. Malt undertones and with some toasted hints, and a hint of dry Carmel flavor, not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected, very drinkable, smooth texture and light-medium body is memorable, since I would expect much more heaviness in texture with beer of this many layers.  Would pair awesome with sausage, salmon, cream-cheese, dill, herbs, mustard, smoked trout."

"I'm enjoying this one to a certain extent, but I""m not entirely sure that if the smoke were gone, I'd still enjoy the beer underneath it. If it's smoke you really like, or if you're just in the mood for something different, this might be the one for you."
""
""
"This intense of a smoked beer will never be my favorite thing, but I still did enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a quality doppelbock. In the true style, I have no doubt that this is loaded with malts and would no doubt sustain the monks through the Lent season."
""
"Taste is smoke through and through, just as I expect and want from one of their brews. Sweet here and there. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth over the tongue, and drinkability is wow. I'd get this one again. Quickly."
"Prost!"
""
"O: If you like smoke, cured meat/charcuterie, etc you will love this. Definitely distinct & well made. But probably not for everyone"
"Pours a crystal clear medium golden color with a smallish white head that dissipates to a cap. Smells of campfire, bbq chips, and a hint of alcohol. I really can't get past the smoke in the aroma. The flavor is sweet and malty deep underneath a smokey woody facade. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet phenolic mouthfeel. Really smokey, a bit one dimensional, but damn it was easy to enjoy."
""
"Another great beer, I don't see how Schlenkerla fits this much smoke in a beer, it's really good."
""
""
"o: I might have had an older bottle. I liked this but I might have loved it if it wasn't as sugary. Are there any other smoked doppelbocks to try?"

""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with low levels of carbonation, resulting in a smooth, slightly placid mouthfeel that actually complements the thick smoke and caramel flavors of the beer. Closes dry, with medium-high stickiness clinging to the lips and palate."
"O: I was pleased to buy this very good especially when you are craving a Doppelbock. Give it a try"
""
""
"Good, as always a nicely complex and interesting rauchbier from Schlenkerla. It's not my favorite of theirs but the bigger/doppelbock take on this one definitely supplies its own unique charm."

"The taste is like toasted biscuits, sweet molasses, with a slight hop bitterness, as well as the mesquite-like flavor of the oak smoke. No detectable alcohol notes, except for a slight warming sensation. Medium-full texture, prickly carbon dioxide release on the tongue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: interesting beer. Glad I tried it. Unlikely to revisit."
""
"Pours an auburn hue into my goblet. There's a very thin ring for a head, but the beer has a great gem-like clarity to it. Minimal to no lacing. Aroma like that of charred embers, oakiness, and a savory characteristic. Like their other selections, the flavor is pleasantly complex. Charred wood, molasses, brown bread, smoked cheese, and peppercorn notes can be detected within the mix. The finish is soft, with a faint bitterness. Medium bodied with a noticeable ABV. So far, this is my favorite of the three Schlenkerla Rauchbiers I have tasted..."
"500ml bottle served in a pilsener glass. A slight gusher off the bottle pop. Pours a dull amber hue with a loose, fizzy, one-inch, cream-colored head the sizzles and pops as it dissipates into a broken slick. Nose expresses smoked, salt pork, some malty sweetness and a hint of toffee in the background. Taste is really quite interesting - the malt and toffee come out in the foreground, with the smoked, salt pork pleasantly integrated into the background - a juxtaposition of the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and some residual saltiness. Overall, an interesting beer - not my favorite from Schlenkerla, but a pretty unique example of the style."
""
""
"Overall: I could possibly justify calling this my favorite beer ever."
""
""
"OK...so I'm an admitted fan of Schlenkerla even though the smoke is often off the charts (hint...age it 3 years and it'll smooth out, all their flavors mellow out wonderfully with age), and this one is as intriguing as the others, but different. As a doppelbock this is way smoky and flavor-wise bodacious, but also very drinkable to those that appreciate a good smoked brew."
""
""
"To me it tasted like the brewery combined the Rauchbier style with the Doppelbock style. A part of me wished that there were more smoky flavors in the taste and aftertaste. I think my taste buds were jealous with what my nose smelled. It was the aroma of this beer that made it for me. Would I drink this beer again? Probably not. If I want a smoky beer, I'll order a Rauchbier or a Smoked Porter. If I want a Doppelbock, I'll order a Doppelbock. I don't want to cut any corners and get another bottle of a Smoky Doppelbock."
""
"Pretty damn good - if I had to choose, I'd say I like this better than the Marzen but not quite as much as the Urbock. The smoke flavors are a little more balanced in the way that the malt character seems to be much more ""loaded up"" in this one. The oak makes a very solid contribution to the flavor as well. Very enjoyable to drink - Heller-Trum is quickly becoming one of my favorite overseas breweries."
"O - I like rauchbiers. This is no exception. It may have invigorated my love. This beer leaves me craving salty snacks and pork products. This would be great with barbecue or anything with bacon involved."
"O: A very good smoked doppelbock with just the right amount of smoke to compliment the huge amounts of malt used. One of my favorites when it's available"
"As a big fan of smoke beers, this may be my favorite from Schlenkerla. The fact that doppelbocks are among my favorite styles earns this beer points as well. Poured into a glass, the beer had a murky brown color with variations. The aroma reminded me most of smoked ham. Even though I do not eat/like ham, I love the aroma. In the initial taste, one gets the best qualities of a doppelbock and a smoke beer. The sweetness of the malt jumps to the front, but it is nicely balanced by the character of the smoke. In both case, the sizes of the taste are huge while balancing each other out. The malts sour slightly in the aftertaste, while the smoke lingers on the roof of the mouth. The thick texture allows the smoke to stick. This is a well-developed smoke beer, and a fabulous example of a doppelbock."
"Started to gush upon opening. I was at first concerned about infection. Nice golden amber color. Very clean looking. Moderate amount of smoke in the aroma. Mild malt behind all that. Big huge smoke flavor. Label says oak but I really get the cherrywood smoke in there. Sweeness from the malt. Very clean even with the huge smoke flavor. Damn solid mouthfeel. More and more enjoyable as it goes down. Really worth trying."
""
""
"Someday I will do a side by side of all of this breweries beers. This one seems like one of the more complex ones, maybe because of the higher ABV and darker malts. What a great brewery."
""
"I do somewhat prefer the Rauchbier Marzen because the darker malt flavors make it so drinkable. However, this is quite amazing."
"Purchased on recommendation of Matthew of Virginia Wine Warehaus in Charlottesville, VA fame. His admonition: don't let Beer Advocate hype strangle yr taste & instincts. Respect. Pours a nice amber. Pretty ho hum. No indication of the tidal wave of taste to come. Odor wafts up with soft smells of smoke. Where there's smoke there's FIRE. The taste is immediate: charred, smoked, burnt, formerly on fire. Swallowing doesn't erase the memory of the inferno. Years can't erase the memory."
""
""
""
""
"Not the best of the Aecht line up. I'm not sure the heavy malt-sweetness works well pressed up against all of that smoke, but it may be that they just need to adjust the ratios a bit."
""
""
""
"O: I had super high expectations and that led me to be a bit underwhelmed. Not as phenomenal as I had hoped. Oh well."
"500ml Bottle. Pokal glass. Enjoyed on feb´13. Brownish amber color, clear appearance. Tan froth creates a close, small bubbled crown. Good retention & rings left on sides. Intense smoky aroma & caramel malts underneath, leather hues. Delicate malty upfront is attacked by clean bitterness but gentle Bamberg touch provides creamy sensation. Medium body. Moderate to low carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Floral & earthy notes in the middle linger into a dry bitter finish. Slight burnt wood on the aftertaste. ABV seems to be well masked but it quickly climbs to your head!"

"Initially, I thought the smoke was way too strong, but the taste is growing on me. The sweet/smoke combination seems to work better than dry rauchbiers. Comes across like an Islay Scotch--still a beer but with a solid dollop of smokiness in the smell/taste."
""
""
""
"M - Full body, low carb level, finishes dry. alcohol well hidden."
"This is one of the more interesting beers I've tried in some time. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and the smoked doppelbock is something I'll definitely keep my eyes open for from now on."
""
""
""
"Overall- This beer is a unique character and one that every beer drinker should try at least once; Perfect companion with smoked meats!"
""
""
""
""
"The aftertaste continues with malt and smoke flavors. Hops are very low down anywhere as is any booze flavor. Overall, this is a great German bier and a very easy drinking doppelbock."
""
"This smoked doppelbock is superbly balanced. There is no denying the smoked malt here, but it is so controlled and it lets the rich malt sweetness shine through, which brings its own character to the table as well. I would revisit this beer anytime. Very good, and I easily downed that 500mL bottle by myself."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber/red, with a thin tan head. Aromas of freshly smoked barbeque, and some toffee. Taste is a powerful smoked meat flavor up front, followed by some dark caramel, then some oak flavor, then a bit of earthiness from the hops. The finish is similar to that of some wonderful smoked meats. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall an amazing beer, I wish I could get this from my local stores."
"Meaty, smoky, sweet. I like. The sweet malts do a good job balancing the smoke. The 8% abv is hidden extremely well."
""
""
"O: Not your typical Doppelbock. If you like woody flavors, this is for you. A different kind of smokiness compared to their other beers but it's an awesome departure from this style. These guys can't make a bad smoke beer. I can't even imagine drinking these brews at their brewery. It will happen."
""
""
"Pours a gorgeous, clear, dark amber color with a two-finger off-white head that doesn’t hang around too long. Some lacing left on the glass. The aroma of smoked ham and toasted bread with a grainy, earthiness to it. Smoky flavor up front, then the sweet caramel malts come forward. There is a nice earthy hop flavor and some dark fruity flavors that linger. A hint of alcohol in the finish. Definitely a dopplebock and the smoke flavor doesn’t cover it up. Nice balance. Medium body and a nice low level of carbonation, smooth and silky. Overall a very drinkable beer at 8% ABV, and a very good and unique version of the style. The oak-smoked malt is definitely more subtle than their beech-smoked offerings. I have to say this is my favorite from Aecht Schlenkerla; If you didn’t like smoked beers you’ve tried before, (I didn't) I would recommend trying this one. It is definitely unique."
""
"For what this is, they really hit the mark here. Beautiful meld of sweet toffee and caramel meets the aggressive smoke character."
""
"Big thanks to Illudium for the sample!"
"O - Offers a complexity not usually found in dopplebocks, but doesn't over power the palate. Schlenkerla works magic in my book, and this may be the best of all."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: Very tasty; an excellent rauchbier!"
"O - Definitely putting this one in my top 3 for smoked beers. I probably couldn't drink more than one bottle in a sitting, but I thoroughly enjoyed this bottle. If you are holding this beer, thinking ""should I try this?'' The answer is yes. This is a must try for anyone who enjoys good beer, and I'm positive the majority of those people will enjoy it as well."
""
"This was some amazing smokey stuff. Oak-aged beers can have a vanilla flavor to them, but this is oak-smoked. This beer is woody and smokey, with plenty of sweet caramel malt backbone, but dry enough to invite the next sip. To recap, there's wood, there's smoke (bacon), there caramel malts and pleasant finish. Hops? No flavoring hops noticed here, but the bitterness is an important component to balancing things out, but this is not bitter. Is this a malt bomb? Yes, and a darn good, smokey one. Quite possibly my new favorite smoked beer."
"O- my new favorite from schlenkerla..."
""
"O - as a fan of anything smoke, this fits right in! While I think I would still prefer the rauchbier unbock or the weizen, I would still look forward to this one during the holiday season!"
"Very interesting beer."
""
"This is a tough one to gauge since I like smoked beers for the most part, but this one I think needs to grow on you."
"Taste is definitely heavy. I get lots of wood (hahah), smoky meat, and a nicely warming, dry finish (this one is 8%, after all). I get more wood here (no doubt the malts aged over smoked oak adds to this heaviness more than the regular Schlenkerla's beechwood-smoked malts). Absolutely a pinnacle of rauchbier goodness, this Schlenkerla is tough to find (at least in my area), but well worth the experience."
""
""
"Another great smoked beer from schlenferla,possibly the smokiest of them all."
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of smoked malt is powerful though well balanced by some caramel malt. Taste is a great balance between some caramel malt with some light sweet notes and a good level of smoked notes. Body is not as full as expected with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed and not as smoky as expected since the malt really cut through some of the smoke."
"O: an enjoyable beer, overall. More of a rauchbier than doppelbock, but still tasty and drinkable."
"Really enjoyed this beer: I've been to Bamberg a few times and have struggled to embrace the whole rauch scene in general, wish I'd found this during my visits, it might have changed my view of smoky brews: oak obviously does it for me rather than the beech!"
"I was a little surprised by the lightness of the feel, though it manages about a medium body, considering both its style and the robustness of its overall character. Crispness is on an even keel with smoothness, if not more, though it's not overdone."
"A really excellent rauch-bock. Tons of smoke and malt flavour. Very good."
""
"Overall: I really liked smoked beers, and I do not get them very often. I am happy to have had the opportunity to try this one. I would get it again."
"A distinctive doppelbock with its oak smoked malt. A classic doppelbock character predominates, the smoked malt adding a slightly different perspective but without overwhelming everything. Even if you find Schlenkerla's rauchbiers too much for you, it's worth trying out this milder cousin from this fine brewery, especially if you like doppelbocks."
""
""

""

"A real experience of a beer. A really nice incorporation of a huge phenolic barbequ-ey smoke into a rich malty doppelbock. A big beer, with a lot of rich malty character to match the intense smokiness. If youre up for it, this is a solid smoky doppelbock worth trying."
"Pours a rich amber maple syrup with a scant haze. Thin layer of white froth perched atop the liquid. Intriguing smokiness in the aroma reminds me of bbq ribs, perhaps a wood fireplace. Some rich malty sweetness is present in the background, far less apparent than the dominant smoke. Despite the strong smoke in the aroma, the flavor leans more towards your traditional dopplebock with caramel/toffee malty sweet, a subtle prune fruitiness, and a touch of herbal hops. Smoke is certainly here and lingers into the finish. Medium full body with a moderate low carbonation level. Overall an interesting blend of doppelbock and smoke beer, well-balanced and enjoyable."
""
""
"I won't buy this one again."
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours slightly hazy reddish copper with a soapy white head that dissipates quickly. There appears to be a moderate amount tiny bubbles in the beer. The smoked malt aroma immediately hits the nose. I can detect some of the breadiness and sweetness from the malt. The smokiness in the flavor is quite intense. The oak smoke really comes through here. It blends well with the breadiness and sweetness from the malt. It's rich, but not overwhelmingly so because the smoke helps balance everything well. It all helps mask the 8% alcohol. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish does stick to the mouth briefly. This drinks pretty well for such a big beer. This is an excellent beer."
"A nice balance of smokey and sweet on the palate. Campfire and just a hint of bacon and lots of caramel and toffee notes. Medium bodied and a bit creamy as well. This could certainly make a great holiday dessert beer."
"this is a unique beer. i like everything ive had from these guys, but this one might be my favorite just because of how different it is. it pours a dusty bacon red color with a lively and frothy one inch just off white head. the nose is smokey as hell. just as much as their rauchbier i think, its close anyways. there is a sweet malty richness thats quite obvious, and the smoke profile is odd. its a lot like the weber when i do a pork shoulder over oak chips, a really similar vibe. the flavor isnt oaky in the barrel aged sense, but in the burning oak sense, really far out. it tastes like a big old turkey leg or something, midieval and hearty, almost arrogant. its really meaty in feel too, thick and saturated with flavor. good carbonation too. overall this is a great beer for this time of year. it tastes like october to me, but it isnt something i need to drink a whole lot of. i was still tasting it this morning. really powerful flavor here."
""
""
"D - One is more than enough. Good to try."
"4.0 D: This brand is the one to go to when you want slapped silly with smoke. Very tasty."
"The smell is smokier than the taste and, very likely, therein lies this beer's success - the overall experience is balanced. I'm glad I finally picked up a bottle of this."
"A very nice smoke beer, among the best. Keeps me coming back to the classic of classics when it comes to this style. As with their other beers, a nice balance of smoke to malt."

"Glad i finally got to try this. a welcome addition to the schlenkerla family"
"Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche pours a crystal clear amber, with about two fingers of off white foam crowning the beer. Head retention is short lived and lacing is minimal. The nose is fairly one-note, but it has a nice hickory smoked bacon aroma. The glavor gas a solid bready malt opening. The rauch malt then comes in to finish out the flavor profile with a pleasant smoked meat/barbecue presence. There's a nice sturdiness to the body, while staying short of being overbearingly chewy. The carbonation is subtle, just enough to cut through the malt. Even if Aecht Schlenkerla's Eiche is classified as a doppelbock, the use of smoked malt renders it a bit idiosyncratic for the style. While it's intensely smoky, it's not too much, once one takes a couple sips and gets acclimated."

"O - There is a definite strong smoke presence here, however it seems to flow well with everything without having any harsh edges. I admit that I'm not normally one for a smoked beer, but this was an extremely well crafted product"
"Not quite on par with the others from this brewery. Too sweet, and the oaky smoke and sweet malt seem a little discordant rather than complimentary as you'd find in the urbock/marzen. Still really enjoyable though."
"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a clear orange amber, modest white head and lacing. Malt and smoke aroma. Moderately sweet caramel malt, smoky malt, smoke. Hint of smoked meat, minimal hops. Nice flavor, smooth and mellow. Medium bodied. One of my favorite smoked beers."
"Very, very interesting indeed. I'm not sure how much difference the oak- verses beechwood-smoke character makes (it's still exceptionally smoky), but I feel as though it has a smoothness that isn't altogether to do with the extra body and extra malt. An exceptionally interesting brew."
""
"Overall, I probably liked this one the best of the 3 I had. It was pretty one-sided but had no off-notes I found in the others (marzen and urbock)."
"Mostly full bodied with a light, almost faint, effervescence. A sipping beer, for certain, especially considering the ABV, and a very good one if you ask me."
""
"While their Marzen is my favorite from Heller-Trum, this one isn't bad either. The smoke is more nuanced and less sweet, and for an 8%ABV beer, it's pretty easy drinking."
""
"O: Wasn't sure what to think at first, but I started to enjoy this more as I got near the end of my little sample, suggesting this is something that needs to be savored in larger quantities. An acquired taste to be sure."
""
""
""
"O- I could not choke this down. This flavor is just not for me I guess. My experience with smoked beers is limited, I have had some that were okay, but the smoke flavor in this one is very strong."
""
"Overall quite a novelty and always an enjoyable treat. But not a beer to be consumed regularly. For special occasions."
"Another great work of brewers art - my favorite from this brewery."
""
""
""
"Overall, worth a try, but I wouldn't choose this over the standard rauch offerings from Aecht Schlenkerla."
"Truly truly delicious. Just want to drink this outside before a roaring fire with a plate of quality Aufscnitt."

"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours cloudy reddish orange color with a small 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of big wood, smoked meat, charcoal, raisin, molasses, caramel, toffee, banana, apple, and herbal spiciness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. The smoked aspect compliments the standard doppelbock aromas nicely. Taste of caramel, molasses, raisin, smoke, wood, ham, toffee, biscuit, pepper, light citrus, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of smoke, caramel, molasses, biscuit, and fruitiness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of flavors, with more standard doppelbock flavors going on; without the smokiness becoming too overwhelming. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a nice creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all. Dangerously smooth to drink for 8%, but is definitely great to sip on. Overall this is an excellent and highly enjoyable smoked doppelbock. Great balance of flavors, without the smoke being over the top. Great stuff."
""
"O: I've gotta give this a 5. Definitely my favorite smoked beer so far."
"P.S. Some will suggest this with BBQ or smoked meat. I think that smokey meats may overdo the whole smoke flavor. I had it with a chicken caesar salad. Salty with lots of bleu cheese. Very nice contrast of smokey and salty."

"Darn good."
"Clear light amber body, thin ring of head retained around the edge of glass. Big ass smoke presence in the nose, a bit sweet from the oak smoked malt, hops buried by the smoke, an amazing smelling beer. Yeesh, smoke permeates the taste, smoke in the water, mailt in the sky. Mouthfeel a bit on the light side of medium. Not for the smoke averse. Not as much depth re caramel as the Marzen version but a great smelling and tasting beer nonetheless. Worth seeking out for all the Smoky Joes out there."
"O- Not nearly as strong flavored as I thought it would be. Nothing great, although I was actually expecting NOT to like it, so it worked out. This is something I'll have every now and again."
""
""
"Pours a light copper hue which leaves a creamy two finger head and creamy cling lacing aswell,the smell is bacon,smoked ham,honeyed spices and a light touch of plum,the mouthfeel is light bodied and abit too light for me with tastes of toffee,marzipan,candied peaches,a light touch of smoke and the finish is nutty and fruity and overall its nice but i was hoping for a little bit more cheers."
""
"Medium bodied, this beer rolls smooth over the tongue. Carbonation is low, but that is no issue here."
"Consumed from an Aecht Schlenkerla pint glass, this doppelbock may not be quite to style, but it adds to a comfortable, cool, late afternoon."
""
""
"O: Tasty beer... I'm always surprised by how much I love Schlenkerla's beers. They do amazing things with their smoked flavors. I'm going to now finish the last bit of my drink and enjoy every second."
"The bronze colored body was clear, and the head that formed was a very small ring of bubbles. While the looks were quite timid for a Doppelbock, the smell was anything but. The smoked Bamberg malts were prominent, and gave this beer a smoky, sweet aroma evocative of pork ribs. The taste continue the theme of the smell, with a real smoke laden flavor backed by good deal of sweetness. The hops were there in the finish, but only provided a restrained drying note, instead of an overt bitterness. The sticky and smooth feel on the palette and a drawn out smoky finish that ended each sip were both very classy. The smoked malts seem to do very well in a Dopplebock style. Now please brew a Trippelbock like Samichlaus with these."
""

"This is one of the rauchiest beers I've tried to date. Pretty good, if you can handle the smoke!"
""
""
"Schlenkerla is one of my favorite breweries so I am excited to try this offering for the first time. Pours a dark brownish color with an off-white head. The aroma is filled with smoke and malts. It honestly smells like smoked meats. The aromas with this brewery are amazing if you love smoke. The taste is smooth, malty, sweet and deliciously smokey with some hops in the finish. Overall, this is another fine offering from this great brewery."
"Could this really be a new Schlenkerla? I only remember ever seeing 3 varieties of their rauchbier -- and this one claims to be a doppelbock as well? Very exciting -- 16.9 oz bottle. As soon as I crack it the smell is unmistakably smoke, just like smoked gouda. Flavor is dead on as well. Slightly sweet, not too bitter. The way the beer falls into the glass it looks over carbonated (big bubbles, no head) but in the mouth it's just right. Very smooth -- the smoke flavor is not at all tiring or abrasive, and while it does have some lagery qualities, I never would have guessed this is a doppelbock or the associated alcohol content. Alas the beer doesn't have much else going for it, and maybe it's a little gimmicky. But what there is is amazing."
""
"A wonderful Rauchbier!"
"Overall, good as an occasional beer due to the uniqueness. Far from a complex, multi-layered masterpiece - but that's not how its advertised either."
"O: Beers like this with smoked ingredients are good every once in a while, but they aren't something I'd drink all the time. Still, a well done beer."
""
"O - Just like their brilliant rauchbiers, yet sweeter."
"O - With most smoked beers I find that that the smoked scent/taste overwhelms every other aspect of the beer; in essence it's like drinking a smoked pig... Fortunately this beer rises above that silly preconception and offers something more for the drinker. A nice doppelbock combined with some smoky flavours and delivering a satisfying overall feel."
"That overwhelming sweetness just didn't do it for me. I am a big fan of smoky flavors in tea and scotch whiskey, so I was optimistic that I'd be a big fan, but I'm sorry to say I'm disappointed."
""
""
"overall - one of the more unique beers I have enjoyed, first time I had beer that made me think of (and desire) bbq ribs, good overall but probably wouldn't purchase again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Now I found a beer that is even worse than a sour one. This is not my kind of thing. I stopped smoking 8,5 years ago and this beer tastes like I have started again. This beer still get some points for the Doppelbock undertone which is is undoubtedly nice and wonderful."
"O - Another amazing offering from Schlenkerla, the Cantillon of smoked beer. Rich, smoky, and sweet with that signature Schlenkerla smoke profile, I love this stuff!"
""
"O - Very unusual and very enjoyable, the smokeyness really adds another dimension."
""
""
"Much lighter than the other Schlenkerlas, a dark caramel beer with a weak off white head — but my glass wasn't immaculately clean, so I'll give this the benefit of the doubt. Aroma is smooth and mellow, but strong and meaty. Lovely notes of sweet barbecue char, fruity kalamata olive, rich oaken vanilla, maple leaves, and apple hum a rich, enticing, autumnal harmony. Smooth on the tongue as well, with a smoke flavor that's sweet, rich, and dominant but not overpowering, allowing pleasantly rich fruit and caramel flavors in along with a nice slap of bitter green noble hops. The mouthfeel falls a bit short, with a pleasant tingle but a lack of body that doesn't carry the flavor and allows the raw alcohol flavor to intrude. Quite a nice beer, though, and one I'd love to try with cheese or chocolate."
"Very smooth and mellow with a nice smoky flavor. Great sipper."
"Carbonation is medium, mouthfeel is full but not too sweet. A very enjoyable rauchbier that I could drink multiple pints of in a sitting."
""
""
"A nice smokey sweet brew. Not the most bockish dopplebock that I have had but the smoke makes the beer."
"Overall: I think if I lived in Bamburg, I'd like this, but growing up in Canada and not being exposed to this very often, I really don't have a big fondness for this style of beer. However, it is INCREDIBLY interesting, AND probably better than the regular Aecht Schlenkerla."
"I love the smoke flavors from aecht. This carries it through very well along with excellent flavors on both the aromas and feel."
"O: very well crafted. It's a little strong, as bocks are intended to be. but the high alcohol makes it a little bit overwhelming in many ways (sweetness, alcoholic warmth, etc). works great in winter times for sure"
""
"O- A very nice smoked doppelbock that is an exceptional beer."
""
"Everything's good about this beer, but I'm looking at the 10 oz. left in my glass & wondering how the hell I'm going to finish this. Don't estimate this - it's a rich, full beer that kind of tricked me at first, & I've reached my saturation point pretty shortly in. Good, but best to split."
""
"Drinkability: Incredible. This is all I want for Christmas."
""
"Another quality beer from this brewery. Not really that different from their other beers."
"D: A good drinker."
""
"The doppelback flavor is lost in the smoke and the appearance was average. Still a good drink."
""
"The booze made this feel much stronger than it actually was and if I wanted a fermented ham and cheese sandwich, I'd crack this open and be thankful that I don't have to go about making one the hard way. The smokiness is a lot to take but like so many beers I've had before, this can ""warm up"" if the person drinking it has an open mind and patience. This isn't for everyone but there's enough here to like, after the initial shock wears off..."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with some yeast sediment. Head is large and frothy when poured. Complex aroma of oak smoke from the malts used, and beech smoke aroma from the kettles and vessels used in brewing. In the taste, bacony, campfire, cured meats and char. Some buttery diacetyl is noted as a byproduct of the yeast. Hints of a small malt sweetness and bitterness, but both are cut by acrid smoke flavors. Not as sweet as your typical doppelbock. Alcohol is felt, not tasted. In the finish, smoke, chalky yeast and slick on the palatte. Another fine smoke beer from Aecht Schlenkerla."
"Hazy yeasty beer in color with very small head. Smells of grilled meats, with slight oak. It tasted of a wheat with lots of malt, a good strong smoke taste with slight oak. It was pretty much a full bodied beer but a very drinkable smoke beer compare to their marzen."
""
"O: Can't help but give this a 5 overall, simply blew any smoked beers I've had previously out of the water. At such a great price, I'll be sure to pick more of this up."
""
"Overall this is another great smokebeer. I was a little disappointed with the foaming and chunkies, but ultimately the taste and aroma won me over."

"O.. Great beer. Expensive ($5+/16oz. bottle), but well worth the experience. Look forward to having again."
"So good."
"Sorry, but I just couldn't get paste out of my mind and that definitely affected my feelings of this beer. Although I had a bad reaction to the smell, the taste wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it was interesting to say the least. I'm surprised this came from Germany. If I had to guess without knowing who made it, I'd have said Rogue because of the super strong smokiness. I appreciate what they are trying to do. I just wish I had it with some barbeque, as I think it would make a great pairing. Gotta give it to them for hiding the 8% so well, too. I wouldn't necessarily buy it again, but it was an interesting experience."
"I love smoke beers and I have to say that the ones from Schlenkera are probably the best examples made. Just perfect for a fall evening."
"Pours a rusty orange brown, with a nice dense cap of just off-white head. Creamy and thick retention, solid lacing. Some floaties in the body, there was a bunch of yeast at the bottom of the bottle that I only poured a portion of into the glass. Nose is typical Schlenkerla smoke, campfire and charcoal with some caramel and leathery notes. Taste is sublime, loads of caramel, dark fruits and sweet malts. Smoke is direct, and of greater intensity than the nose but doesn't stay on the palate for long. Smoke reappears in the finish, and there only a slight unpleasant bitterness/dryness that sets this back from perfection. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, carbonation is a magnificent medium low. Wow. Did not expect to be this blow away opening this on a Tuesday evening. Exceptional, and I can only imagine this being just a tad closer to perfection on cask in Bamberg. Brilliant and God do I love smoked beers..."
"Very nice dopple that screams Bamberg"
" I dont think I would buy it again but glad I tried it"
"Overall: Amazing beer! I was really overwhelmed by just how smokey this was. I will most certainly be having more beers from this brewery!"
"Dr: Actually very drinkable, and not just for the ABV. It's more drinkable than their Marzen, which I didn't expect. A good quality beer, its only flaw its simplicity. In the style, I believe it's among the best I've had."
"500 mL bottle poured into a dimpled Eichhof mug. Tips the scales at no darker than bronze, with a solid khaki head. Luscious smokey aroma, recalling smoldering bonfires and smoked cheese especially. Not quite as meaty as the other Schlenkerla offerings. Flavor is smooth and salty, plenty of ham/bacon notes, wood, black coffee, fire. An excellent smoked beer, full and nourishing on the palate."
"Overall a very pleasant Rauchbier, not sure why this one is filed as a Doppelbock instead."
"O: This is a disappointing one for me and I do wonder if its been subject to the elements. I would go to their Urbock over this beer any day of the week. It seems to carry few things which I associate with its doppelbock style."
"So smooth, yet so intense. Liquid smoke meets sweet malts and a kiss of alcohol. Body is light and I think that helps not make it too heavy-feeling of a brew. Pretty amazing brew and after a couple Schlenkerla brews that were not as smoky as Ur-bock, this one is damn smoky and enjoyable. Love it."
"Pours a murky light brown with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a thin film. There is really no lacing on this one though. Smell is obviously of smoked cheese, smoked meat, smoked wood, campfire smoke, etc. Taste is of the same but it's not as potent as other Aecht Schlenkerla beers with the smoke flavors. This is actually very pleasant, especially since I love smoked meat and cheese. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly thick mouthfeel (can the smoke do this?). Overall, this is a good beer that is much tamer than the other rauchbier I have had from this brewery."
"O: Don't know how much of this I could drink in a night, but one or two glasses of this are a game changer. Steve and I were lucky enough to have tried this on draft a couple times earlier this year and I was thrilled when he brought this guy over."
"16.9 ounce (500 ml) bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a somewhat hazy dark golden/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. The head sticks around for a little while, but there isn't much lacing at all. Aroma is very smoky, the brew smells mostly like smoked meat, along with a bit of bready malt. I just love the smoky, meaty aroma of this brew! The beer tastes like smoked meat, bready malt and a little bit of caramel. There's also a nice lingering smoky finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a pretty good overall brew. For just $4.99 a bottle, I'd definitely buy this again. It's certainly one of the better (if not the best) smoked beers I've had."
"This beer is delicious, if the rating doesn't sell you on it, then you're stupid. Just try the beer."
"I love smoked beers and Schlenkerla does them better than anyone on the planet. This particular beer is one of the top smoked beers I've ever had. It's bigger and more complex than most and has the absolutely unmistakable Schlenkerla character. Everyone should try this beer, but smoked beer lovers HAVE to get their hands on this one."
"Beer pours a dark straw with no head but this delicious smoke aroma. Taste is “like a honey baked ham.” The smoke lingers on the palate and the smokiness comes back in the finish. Not as pronounced a smoke profile as some of the other beers I’ve had in this series. This dobblebock is like a dessert to a smoked main course."
"D- This is superb. The smoke doesnt dominate. Its everpresent but doesnt get in the way of the malt richness of the doppelbock character. Lager clean finish makes it easily drinkable with no suggestion of its alcohol strength. A rich doppelbock with that classic Schlenkerla rauch flavour. Superb!"
"dave"
"Overall, nothing really wowed me, and I’ll say I like the Urbock better. Don't get me wrong though - it's still a great beer."
"D: This is definitely my favorite smoke beer. It wasn't as intense from the bottle as on tap, but it still had a great woody scent and taste that was amazingly clean without any harshness. It had great body too with no alcohol noticeable, so it was really easy to drink. Probably not for aging, but who knows how it might develop over time. Highly recommended."
"O - I'm enjoying this Smoked beer. Not to heavy, good after taste, excellent flavor. It is yet another new beer into my world that will open my eyes even wider for new stuff. I'd love to purchase again."
"Different yet intriguing. Smoky but not, yet a rather smooth Doppel.. Liking how the smoked malts balance the sweetness even in the absence of an aggressive hopping."
"Overall, this is a real treat - definitely different than most beers due to the domination of the smoked wood in the smell and taste, but masterfully done."
"Overall this is a nice approachable smoked beer. It is tasty, but hard core smoked beer fans might be wish for a bit more here. But that's no slight on this one, this is very solid."
"M: The mouthfeel is sweet, chewy and meaty. One square meal in liquid form. The smoked oak adds complexity and richness. World class."
"Overall: A good smoked Doppelbock with an incredible aroma."
"Overall, it's pretty tasty, but the smoke really is a lot to handle. Be ready!"
"I did not finish the beer. :("
"Another home run from Schlenkerla."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation, this beer is a little watery in my opinion. While the body is great as you hold it in your mouth, it is swallowed like a heavy water and leaves little coating. A stickier mouthfeel would have helped this beer's flavor profile immensely."
"A very savory and succulently flavored Smoked Dopplebock that relies on malt sweetness to balance the smoke. Avoiding ashy or roast, the beer carries a more meaty character that's very appealing in a beef jerky kind of way."
"."
"I was really excited when I came across this beer at my local shop. I thought that I had tried all the different ones they had until I was proven wrong. The beer poured out as a dark brown color. The head was big at first but quickly settles and almost fades completely. The smell of the beer is smokey but it seems like it was a tolerable aroma than their others. The taste of the beer is loaded with smokey malts and some fresh wood in the background. The mouthfeel is drinkable and not really heavy at all. Overall this beer was probably one of the better ones I've had from Aecht."
"- If you like burned wood, and massive smokey character.. this beer is for you. I feel it is way undercarbonated, may have a decent malt backbone, but is just not hitting high marks with me. I like some good smoked oak etc, age, and unique character.. but holy smokes.."
"O: Interesting and quite good. Still, I wouldn't drink this every day, but I'd have it again... especially if I'm ever in the mood for a Doppelbock."
"Delightlfully effervescent in the mouth with a medium-light body. Definitely a rock-solid smoked beer, and probably one of the more dominantly defined beers from Schlenkerla. Packs a one-two punch of both smoke and hops while maintaining a clever balance with some truly delicious malts."
"No doubt a well-crafted smoked beer."
"Overall: For a lover of rauchbier such as myself, a 16.9 oz. bottle is too small. Two would be better. Well worth seeking out!"
"Overall, this was a rather delicious and well balanced Rauch. Personally ham is one of my least favorite meats of the pork persuasion, so I probably won't be buying this again. I can't knock it for that though, and the dryer finish gives this one a few extra points."
"O - This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down very easy, and the flavor is great. I could easily drink a few of these over the course of a night. Overall, I think this is a very good and unique version of the style. I really like how the nose has a nice big smoke presence, but it tones down in the actual flavor of the beer. I think this is great beer, and I would definitely buy it again. I recommend giving it a shot."
"You will taste the oak, you will taste delicious smoke. If you like smoked beers, I highly recommend trying this brew for a taste of how magical Oak smoke can be. (most other smoked beers are beechwood and not Oak, I'm told by the label blurb)"
"Thick rich malts and tons of smokey bacon flavors. I would seriously say that this is just a bacon flavored beer. It has the smokey essence of a camp fire and is nice and sweet. I must say that I was not expecting this beer to be the way it is at all, I have never had a doppelbock quite like it."
"Overall pretty good, drinkable, much more smooth and mild than the Urbock or Marzen I think. Drinkable and nice smoke qualities."
"D-I guess this style just isn't for me. I have a bottle of their Marzen that I'll try to see if this one was off a little."
"D Fair to good. This is a big, tasty beer. I cannot imagine reaching for a second one of these. It really makes me want to go camping! 3.5"
"Drinkability: awesome and great for pairing with foods. are treat and a honor to try. I had 3 glasses."
"O - Not the best for my taste, but I can appreciate both the Doppelbock aspect as well as the Rauchbier, so it is quite successful in that regard."
"O - Really an interesting beer. I've had a few truly smoked beers and this one takes the cake. Intense and a bit hard to down for 22oz of cured smoke. Enjoyed it, but would rather sample next time."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied overall and maybe a little light for what I like in the style. Carbonation is low and seems appropriate. Overall it was a very smoky beer, definitely one of the smokiest beers I've had. I really liked how the oak wood came out. I really like smoky beers so this one was a nice treat this evening. It would definitely be an intense beer for someone just getting into the style though."
"Remarkably smooth easy-drinking smoked. The smoke is there but its understated under a delicious malt mix. Its on my lips well after I have completed it. It was great with BBQ. Greyish golden coloured body, small head. Mild smoke aromas. A tad above average mouthfeel."
"O - Another fantastic Schlenkerla brew. The balance between the stunning malt complexity and smoke-y depth is just wonderful. Wish I had a liter in front of me right now."
"It pours a light orangish/red with a small head that dissipated quickly. I took a sniff and there was a smell of smoked malts which almost smelled of a smoked gouda cheese. The taste was quite complex, there was a taste of the smokiness like a smoked cheese/oaky flavor. That was then surpassed with a sweeter aftertaste of fruits and brown sugar finish. The mouthfeel is a a full body and heavy beer like most rauchbeirs. There is light carbonation. There is also a slight hint of alcohol, but it does weigh in at 8% abv. Overall, this rauchbeir is probably at the top of my list of rauchbeirs. I can only drink one or 2 of these bottles and then feel full. If you are into Rauchbeirs get this around christmas or whenever you can find this one!"
"Bought this Rauchbier from the Beer Dispensery in Apex, NC. My BA buddy, y2korey, and I broke one open in May 2011... Damn, I love the Rauchbiers. This beer has a nice golden, amber hue. Its nose is like a fresh, burning campfire that pours over into the taste as you drink it down. Mouthfeel is slightly better than average and I feel that this Rauchbier goes down easy for having an ABV of 8%."
"O: I'm a big fan -- the higher ABV gives this rauchbier a depth and force of flavour that the more-popular Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen doesn't have. Multi-dimensional, but always smoky. Recommended."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one more drinkable that I had expected. At first it seemed to me to be somewhat simple and only about the smoke. But as I had more (and as the beer warmed) the flavors became more complex and more interesting. While I’ll not make a great effort to find this one again I certainly would be happy to have another. My overall impression is that this is a well made beer deserving of close attention that requires one to look beyond the smoke and taking some time with the beer to discover the complexity that shows up here."
"With the smoke intense, yet not overpowering, drinkability was good. Not hard to put away, and overall a shining smoked dopplebock example!"
"O: A nice beer, but as a Doppelbock; I'm not sure - way to much smoke. The grade would have been higher if I reviewed it as a Rauchbier. Still very interesting."
"Not as good as their standard lineup I felt, but still a pretty good ""meaty"" smoke."
"D: being a sucker for rauchbiers, i am loving this. a beefed up doppel-version of a smoked lager. just so much aroma/flavor from the smoke makes this very enjoyable. maybe not the best beer to start your palate with, but a great beer overall."
"O: This was a tough beer for me to drink. I could not finish a full beer as it was like drinking a burnt piece of oak. If this is your style, then I'd think you'd be happy."
"As with anything from Schlenkerla, this is akin to drinking a burning log. However, it's not as smoky as other beer from this brewery: the urbock is zillions of times smokier and, for that matter, hammier. Nonetheless, this one has plenty of smoke. There's no ham, however, so I guess that makes it... kosher? Quite tasty and rather low-key for a dopplebock: it doesn't have the boozy, malty smack that most others in this style have. That's a plus in my book, because it's that overtly alcoholic tinge that steers me away from most dopplebocks. If you're a fan of Schlenkerla, you must try this. But if you like your dopplebocks sweet and powerful, you are not worthy."
"Summary: This is a fantastic smoked dopplebock that is almost sessionable."
"Overall I was impressed with this a smoked beer, though nonplused about the assertion that this is a doppelbock. I like my doppelbocks dark, chewy, and sweet and bready. Nevertheless, definitely a beer worth trying, and cheap at $2.99 for the bottle."
"A premium example of a smoky, satisfying, malty German doppelbock. Excellent in nearly every respect. Rich strong smoked malts dominated the aroma and were substantially comnplemented on the palate. A must-try for anyone a fan of the style. Highly recommended... Great stuff..."
"D- I love all their other beers but this beer has bitterness and over the top smoke dominating the flavor making it almost undrinkable. There needs to be some other support, at least a bit, and the woody band-aid notes mixed with the bitter green finish just hang on the tongue."
"T- That Schlenkerla smokiness certainly comes through. This is lovely. Smooth with an oak taste. There is a mild sweetness underneath, perhaps a caramel taste. Perfectly balanced. Some bitterness."
"Don't forget to stamp your passport! Finishing the bottle, you genuinely have the sensation of having experienced something unique and distinctly rooted in a certain landscape and history. I've had some wonderful smoked beers but none honestly capture the distinct character of Schlenkerla rauchbiers, especially not this offering. Buy a bottle, drink up, prepare yourself for one of the most distinctive beers you're bound to try."
"I'd say this is my favorite dopplebock as of right now....there, I said it..."
"Taste is wood smoke, caramelized sweet bread crust up front, hint of spicy-raisiny fruitiness, lingering spicy smokiness just dominates finish & lingers. It’s pretty good, but a bit one-dimensional and slightly sharp."
"Again love this brewery. This is much more drinkable and palatable than their regual run. Don't know if it's the oak aging making the overall smokiness more rounded and laid back or if it's just this beer but whatever it is its damn tasty. Burnt caramel, oak, charred woods, smoked meats, brown sugar, some dried fig on the very finish. Creamy nice mouth with a medium sweet finish that than ends dryly. Quite good."
"I know that I am Biased, I LOVE smoked Beer! Schlenkerla Urbock is one of my favorite all time beers, so i was excited to try this one. Pours a dark but translucent brown with a medium head. Lots of Wood, some meaty goodness and tons of smoke in the nose, I love the way these beers smell and this was no exception. Tasted of wood and smoke as well as bacon but not as intense as the smell. a slight sweetness marries with the smoke perfectly and goes beautifully with food (smoked German Sausage in this lucky mans case!) Smooth and rich on the palate but also light and fluffy as it does not leave any intense flavors in the mouth. Over all a great beer that I will have again but may not love as much as the Urbock."
"D: A very attractive and balanced smoke beer. It tastes completely natural and has a sort of rustic charm that I find quite appealing. "
"Quite full bodied, but not heavy. Nice rounded mouthfeel, but mostly firm. A nice change of pace."
"O - I think its pretty easy to see where I stand with this beer and like all Schlenkerla beers I love it even though the abv is a bit higher than the rest of the line up I can't help but to keep on getting sips of this stuff if you like smoked beers this is a beer that you should hunt down to try"
"M/D: Could have used a bit more carbonation. Overall it was very good, but needed just a little more bite to the mouthfeel."
"Notes: Interesting, complex smoked beer. Smoked meat is the strongest, but this more than other similar beers provides more balance and complexity to the flavor. Has subtle/vague doppelbock hints as well as oak."
"Pours a clearish dark gold/tan color with decent carbonation and head. Aroma is smokey and meaty, not much else. I like this beer and it is a very enjoyable after dinner sipper for me and it is a sipper - chug this only if you want to be ill. Just slightly disappointed only in that while a medium body and I can pick out some sweet malt tastes and a touch of hoppy bitterness, this is mostly a smoke beer. Nothing wrong with that - just that this is not close to a 50/50 balance of rauch/dopple...the smokiness is clearly more dominant. If you love smoke beers with a touch of lingering sweetness then this is yours, but beware if you think you're getting a slightly smoked dopplebock. Perhaps my hope for the latter leads to my review being less than a solid A-, as I like smoke beers and in that case this is another top notch Aecht brew. That being said, a sturdy, fuller-bodied beer that is exceptionally smooth thanks to oak and has a touch of woodiness in it. Smooths as it warms and the longer you sip on it your tongue adjusts to dry smokiness and caramel, toffee, sticky malts and some minor hop flavors come through behind smoke."
"I really enjoy smoked beer, and this one was no exception. The beer is a clear, light chestnut color with a modest white head. The aroma is what catches you first. It's a great mix of wood smoke and rich malt. the smoke is intense, something between a smoked ham and a smoldering campfire. The malt is folded in behind the smoke, but still quite prominent. As for the taste, it's a sweet, malty, dopplebock for sure. The smoke comes forth in the taste as a remarkable spiciness. Firm body, and very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall - While this is not my favorite style of beer, it is the work of craftsman brewers. Both smoke and dopple bock beers are very difficult beers to brew, and this is a great combination of the two."
"1316"
"O - Aecht doesn't disappoint, and this is not an overwhelming beer. The right amount of smoke and malt makes for a drinkable, wonderful beer"
"O: Goes down easily at first, tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick and a bit off for a Dopplebock...it's more of a smoked dopplebock. At first the smokiness is fantastic but as the beer warms, the sweetness and minor alcohol notes come in and hang. A little too sweet to have more of a pint of, but a decent beer none-the-less."
"This beer pours a murky orange-amber color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of smoke, wood, bacon, and caramel. It is a strong aroma. The taste is quite a bit mellower than the aroma. There is still a strong smoke presence, especially in the finish, but it is balanced with a solid malt backbone. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a good rauchbier that I would gladly drink again."
"Beers like this stand as a refutation of any sentiment that German brewing is irrelevant or obsolete. Schlenkeria Oak Smoke is an exciting and amazingly well crafted beer; I don't see how one could balance such bold flavors without hours of work researching and brewing. I'm not entirely sold on the style, but I'm glad there's adventurous beers like this being made so well."
"O. Overall I really don't think this is my cup of tea. I just can't get warmed up to the idea of drinking a glass of bacon."
"As either a Rauchbier or a Doppelbock, this one is really easy to drink... not thick, great, complex flavors, and those unique Schlenkerla aromas make this a fun one to review."
"This is a complex beer, although the sweet and smoked flavors dominate. Extremely enjoyable. I love this brewery's consistency and integration of the smoked malt into all their beers."
"Being a fan of raucbiers, I knew that I would love Eiche. But what I didn't expect was how this beer would touch and tease my palate. Wow!! This might be a great beer to drink during Lent, or...fuck it, how 'bout everyday? The 500 ml bottle went down much quicker than expected, and being a seasonal beer, I'm sure to grab at least a few more bottles before the supply runs dry."
"This beer is hard to drink for me. The taste does not appeal to me. Very unusual."
"D: It's certainly unique, I'll give it that. But it's really hard to drink in any significant amount."
"Easier drinking than some of their other offerings but still smoky and tasty."
"Verdict: Too expensive to be worth it, and too unique to be an everyday beer. Really a novelty only."
"Drinkability: An excellent rauchbier and a decent doppelbock. Schlenkerla's offerings are always unique and intriguing. This one is no different. It's smoky character goes a long way towards hiding the 8% ABV, which makes this beer a bit more quaffable than most doppelbocks. Thoroughly enjoyable and certainly something I wouldn't mind having again soon."
"D: This beer probably has the perfect amount of smoke. Often I find the smokiness of rauchbier to be too subtle, getting lost after a few sips. This beer keeps reminding me, in a good way."
"Holy ****! Absolutely amazing. Smoke intensity heavy in both aroma and flavor, malt characteristics just enough to set it off. I love rauchbier, so I'm a bit biased. But this one is my new favorite."
"another wonderful offering from a world-class brewer!"
"D-an exceellent beer but im not sure how many i could handle"
"Medium body, carbonation is smooth. Some warming alcohol, but not enough to hurt the drinkability. Smoke adds a great complexity to this. I love the Schlenkerla beers, and this is no exception."
"This is so far the most highest rated beer I've ever rated, thank god I seeked it out it is truly world class, and phenomenal. If you find the regular Rauchbiers too smokey (Marzen) or too sweet (Urbock) drink this thing it's the perfect marriage. The head mashes my face and surrounds my nose cause it will not leave me alone, whisking me to another world as the perfect sweet body and taste envelopes me out of this glass. I WANT MORE!!! I am very tempted to rate this as all fives, I am SHOCKED I never thought this beer would be this good or ANY beer for that matter."
"Drinkability: An interesting and enjoyable beer- one that I would like to have again."
"Fantastic. This is the rauchbier to start with (if you could find it). Incredibly smooth and delicious."
"This is a beer to try if you can find it."
"Overall, I was very pleased with this. Drank it fairly quick. One of the tastier more balanced rauchbiers I've had. Hope they put this out for years to come."
"D: Much higher than other Rauchbiers, this is just as drinkable as any other doppelbock I've had, helles or otherwise."
"This is unique, and something I think I would crave now and then. But you have to be in the right mood."
"D: Another spectacular release from one of my most cherished breweries. This is something different, but still on base with the brewer's former lineup. Highly recommended."
"D: Well, with all rauchbiers, there's a sort of limit to drinkability. This is overwhelmingly smoky, which I adore and others loathe. If you love the taste, this is worth seeking out. Otherwise, it's not much milder than any other offering from these guys, and probably a terrible beer for those new to the style. It drinks well, though, smoke aside--stereotypically German."
"Pours from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Pours a clear copper color with a finger-thick white head that settles into a thin film on the beer. Aroma of smoked pork, wood, campfire, well-done bacon, and burnt sweet toast. Flavor of smoked pork, burnt toast, caramel malts, toasted sugar, peat, nectarine, honey, and corn syrup. The flavor drops out a little from the nose. Medium-full bodied, with a smoky, syrupy mouthfeel and a quick metallic, then lingering smoky finish. Sweet and smoky. I can't say this is my style."
"The extreme smokiness balanced with the light malt characteristics make this a very interesting beer."
"Fans of this would do themselves a favor to try New Holland Chartooka Rye for an American take on a smoked doppelbock, equally meritorious."
"D: OK, it is a certainly a smoky beer with nice flavors and decent feel to it. The smokiness doesn't really lend itself to being that drinkable, but for a smoked beer, this was nice."
"Mostly clear copper-orange - little bits of fine sediment suspended in the liquid. Small creamy yellowed head shrinks to a fine ring. Clean, sweet smoky aroma...not as meaty as the other Schlenkerla beers, but there's still a certain greasy quality to it. Caramel malt and a whiff of nobel hops. Sweet, pleasantly smoked, caramel malt - leather and floral hops. Quite sweet, but mild, smooth, almost creamy. Medium bodied. Not for everyone, perhaps a bit sugary, but expertly crafted as usual."
"D - This is a very strange beer, it reminds me in a way of Alba Scots Pine ale (which I wouldn't generally consider a compliment). The smoke character is very different from that found in the other, beech smoked Schlenkerla beers. This is much more spicy and intense with an incense like quality of pine and licorice that does strange things on the palate when it hits the sweet toffee malt. The individual flavors here have some potential, but when it all comes together it just ends up as a sticky, weird, cloying mess. A rare miss from the masters of Smoked beer."
"This was a good beer, I drank it with out pairing it with food. I would recommend drinking it while enjoying some grilled meat."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It is light and I like the flavor. THere is no hint of the 8% abv."
"This beer was served a clear amber color with a decent ecru foam on the surface that was inviting. The nose is almost totally of smoke with bit of caramel in the background. The flavor has a bit of dryer smoke that has a slightly soured finish to it. The flavors are caramel like in nature beyond the smoke, but it's mostly smoke. The mouthfeel is a little on the acidic side, drinkability depended for me, it was hard to drink just by itself, but when paired with grilled foods it was wonderful. So I leave it at that. A nice beer overall."
"Edit: Not ""drinkable"" which I always took to mean ""sessionable," but the best smoked beer I've ever had. Bumped the ""overal"" from 2.5 to 4."
"D -- Even at 8%, I could see wanting more than a couple of these at a sitting. The smokiness doesn't fatigue the palate, and the flavors grab your interest and appetite."
"The taste is similar in terms of what the smoke does. Here I can get a bit of the smoked oak, though I can't say it really adds a positive dimension. The underlying doppelbock is completely gone and I don't get anything that would indicate this was the base. The taste brings a bit too much tannin and is overwhelmingly smokey. I suppose it's not that the level of smoke is bad, it's just that there's really nothing else there. A bit of an astringent, bitter finish. Really not a fan of this though I could see how one could enjoy it. My least favorite Schlenkerla beer to date."
"A rich whiskey-amber color with moderate sandy head. Nose is full of smoked meat--delicious bacon-y goodness. Smells awesome, very powerful. The flavor on it is also very good, though it kind of draws back the smokiness a little (still pretty smokey). No ashiness is noted, which is good because ashy flavor is a deal-breaker for me in smoked beers. Underlying dopplebock is pretty clean, though I might be looking for a bit more sweetness for a maple-smoked bacon profile, as of now it's just smoked bacon with a touch of herbal bitterness and maybe some bready malt underneath. Moderate mouthfeel, a bit prickly. Great drinkability, well-disguised alcohol. Love these Schlenkerla beers, superb."
"Yumm...."
"Very drinkable, a truly great smoked beer, will be looking for more of this."
"Pours a golden colour crisp and clear. A good amount of white frothy white head. Very smokey on the nose. The smoke is not an earth smoke but something perhaps lighter. At the same time, very overpowering smoke. On the tongue there is a lot of sweetness and smoke. Very well balanced. Lacking on the body though. Too thin for my taste. Overall fairly drinkable and an interesting beer"
"D: For those of us who like Rauchbier, this is wonderful. I personally find the oak to be more mellow than the normal beech smoke from Bamberg."
"D: While their beers aren't always my thing, this was surprisingly good. Certainly quite smokey, but enjoyable and different."
"Cheers!"
"Please...buy this."
"D- I like this waaay more than the Urbock of theirs I tried awhile back. The smoke is still the dominant player here, but there is a nice bit of toasty malt to balance it out. Not something I could drink a lot of, but I would definitely drink this again. I can't smell wood smoke anymore without getting a craving for one of these."
"Big thanks goes out to womencantsail for sharing this one on my recent trip to Cali! Served from bottle into a pilsner glass. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of smoked malt and pulled pork (really!?). The flavor was of smoked malt, pulled pork, and slight wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't bad, but it also wasn't that great. All I have to say is, pulled pork, really!?!? That was definitely the first experience I have had with this flavor in my beer. For some odd reason I liked it (I am from South Carolina afterall). There was definitely some good flavors and aromas going on here."
"As I continue sipping and the smoke clears (hahahahahahah!) this is ultimately a doppelbock that happens to be smoke-y. That's my initial impression, and upon reviewing additional Rauchbiers perhaps this impression will change."
"All in all, I'm pleasantly blown away. surprisingly drinkable for 8% and smoke. Taste is amazing and not overpowering. complex and nowhere near as one-dimensional as many rauchbiers. This one is a must try."
"The beer is nothing like the standard Schlenkerla rang and is not as punchy in its smokeyness but works on a lot more different levels. FANTASTIC."
"In short: A fantastic smoked Doppelbock with perfect balance between the smoke and base beer, reflecting the character of both."
"Medium in body, this beer opens sweet with caramel, brown sugar and an earthy smokiness. The smoke character is definitely reserved, providing a faint bacon flavor. Hops appear mid-palate, providing a blend of earth and green, leafy flavor. Moderate bitterness is present on the finish, again, earthy, along with a blend of smoke, brown sugar and a little alcohol. Carbonation is medium-light , working well with the medium body and the complex finish. Oak is present mostly as a little vanilla-sweetness to complement the smoke. As always, I'm astounded by how hoppy German beers are when fresh. Excellent stuff, I will drink more of this."
"This is solid stuff, I just find myself yearning a bit for the usual Doppelbock flavors, such as molasses, sweet dough and dulce de leche, and maybe a bit less Rauch. I knew it would be smokey, but I feel a bit misled, honestly. Sort of a strange mix, though definitely a Rauchbier!"
"Easy drinking, a very solid rauchbier. I'm gonna keep one for a Schlenkerla portfolio night, everything but the fastenbier (tap only)."
"Forgive the silly puns and all. This is a beer that all fans of rauchbiers would enjoy. It's deceptively drinkable and should do a good job of reminding a brisket/bbq fanatic of warm summer days behind a grill."
"This is such an awesome beer. I honestly think it's one of the best balanced smoked beers I've ever had. Fan-fucking-tastic."
"I had a 500 ml bottle at tria the other day. The pour is amber/orange with a quickly receding white head. The aroma is full of sweet smoke, it reminds me of smoked bacon. The beer taste a little sweeter than it smells. Smoked meat is the dominant flavor, the smokiness lingers for a while in the finish. The beer was lighter in body than I expected, had a nice ""clingy"" mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this, I was surprised even the nonbeer drinkers liked it."
"d. drinkable, because of the sensory playfulness, the smell is incredibly potent and unique."
"Toasted malts and herbal hop bitterness up front. Sweetish fruit and cookie malt meld with flinty campfire smoke. Charred cooked veggies follow, with lingering caramel and smoke. Herbal bitterness from some delicious noble hops are a nice foil to the malty sweetness, and they go surprisingly well with the layered smokiness. Not as strong and meaty as the marzen, partly due to the increased malt/alcohol complexity, but also to the oak. Medium-full body with a thick, chewy feel and gentle carbonation. Delicious and dangerously drinkable."
"D: Very tasty. I really enjoy the beechwood smoked version as well and will probably do a side-by-side comparison to see how the msoke character differs."
"Reviewed on 12/31/2009. On tap at DBGB. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of smoky meats, peat, bacon. Flavor is quite minty on the initial sip followed by berries, smoked wood, smoked meats. Hmm, didn't really enjoy this one -- it was too minty."
"Overall - A very good second shot at the Rauchbier style. Though overall I think I prefer the Urbock from this brewery, this beer has a more complex flavor profile, and I'm very glad I tried it. Recommended for die-hard fans of smokey flavors!"
"Notes: Perhaps a more approachable smoke beer, but not as complex as the Marzen."
"Paired this with a charcuterie plate of smoked sausage, coppa, and Cabot clothbound cheddar."
"500 mL from WF Arlington, paired with some sharp cheddar"
"Not my favourite beer from these guys, but still a good rauch!"
"M + D: Somewhat chewy, and quite appropriate given the flavour profile. They work together very well. Notes of alcohol are more apparent as the glass goes, but the smoke does tend to hide those characteristics in many of these beers. While I think I might find myself leaning more towards New Holland's Charkoota Rye, this is a nicely done brew that I would certainly return to in the future."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. I like smoky flavors, so keep this one coming."
"smoked sweet coal, woody tannins and some malt highlights dominate the beer. pretty enjoyable, but having a sore throat, drinking a smoked beer was probably not a good idea. i'm not going to knock it too much for my dumb decision making. I'll come back to this with my next bottle.."
"This is perhaps the most drinkable rauchbier I've ever had. I've had smoked beers that were easier to drink, but they were classified as smoked stouts or porters."
"D: easy drinking for its ABV"
"A must try for smoke Aficianado's."
"Pour is a light clear amber with a quickly diminishing beige head. Little to no lacing. Malty aroma with a slightly medicinal smokiness. Taste is exceptional, especially considering dopplebock is not a favorite style. But Schlenkerla saves the day. There is just a tad of hop bitterness, and a wonderful smoke that tempers the malty sweetness. This is wonderful beer, whether you call it a rauchbier or a smokey dopplebock. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, carbonation light too. Alcohol never really makes itself known. On cold days like today, this could be dangerous. A fantastic winter treat for smoke fans."
"D: Very smooth with a very good smoked presence. The smokiness strong at first quiets and lets the fruity bock nature come through with a good balance. Fairly easy to manage."
"an amber beer that definitely hits the rauchbeer note perfectly with the quality of smokeiness. woody smokey nose that is set in equal parts with a sweet malt fruit. there is a bitter note in the palate and a fruit that seems to separate in the face of the smokiness. this beer seems to be quite temperamental when it come to what you drink it with because it accentuates the malt differently. i would like to see a bit of a different qualities in palate outside of the expected. even though its a doppelbock at 8% abv it still seems to have a similar quality to most all the others. which is a good thing for those that are looking for something that places the alcohol well. but that is the only thing that separates each individual beer. if you're in the mood for a rauchbeer then have this brewery. end of question but i would like to see more accent in the malt tones. it may be because i had beets with it and it give it a particular sweet quality to it. its too sweet... and i'm a bit disappointed."
"D-I love Rauchbiers, and this is one of the best. Would go great with a peppery cigar."
"Finally, I new Schlenkerla variety around here! Me loves the smoke, honey! It pours a clear tawny copper topped by a finger of ecru-cream foam. My nose is inundated with what I can only call a mixture of a coastal breeze (ocean coast, that is) and the smoke billowing from a coniferous forest. So...downwind from a fire in a forest around Puget Sound? Something like that. Some light honey and caramel sit in the back row, no raised hands and grades in jeopardy. The taste has the usual blackened pork chop flavor that I've come to enjoy from Schlenkerla, but it's a bit more subdued than usual. The honey and caramel put forth a stronger effort (the parents were threatening to take away their cars if they fail another class), joined by maple syrup and straight oak. Despite the relative drop in smoke content, this is a decidedly tasty brew, and the weaker smoke acts as more of a compliment to the other flavors, rather than its usual role as lead. The body is a wavy medium, with a light carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, this brew was worth the wait, continued proof that some of the best rauchs continue to come from their homeland. In my opinion, had they upped the smoke a very tiny bit and the body were just a bit more assertive (only word I could come up with to describe my feelings), this might be my favorite rauch ever. Instead, only top 5. Shame, really..."
"A pleasant moderated rauchbier."
"Just a great beer in all and a fantastic smoked beer."
"Hazy orange copper body. Thin bubbly beige head. Lace is sparse. Beautiful smokey nose. Hate to say it again, but like a distant campfire. Or actually, not so distant. Oaky and greasy. I love it. This beer is fantastic. Nobody does Rauchbier like Schlenkerla. And I mean nobody. I can't believe how easy this goes down for an 8% beer. The richness of a dopplebock isn't quite where I was expecting it, but the flavor is delicious. Malts are pretty rich and the smokiness is complex and soothing. Very slightly phenolic, which adds a dimension, and also slightly oily and bitter. Awesome beer."
"craftsmanship, a beautiful example of the style."
"I have never been a big Rauchbier fan. The smoke has always overpowered everything for my tastes, and that is especially true with this brewery. I have always been interested in the style in small samples however. This is just great through and through. Everything is really well incorporated. Highly recommended, and the best example of the style I have come across."
"Was a fan of the Marzen, this one is more refined and maybe even better."
"Finish is good, but you have to like the smoke."
"srinkability - great - by far one of the best smoked beers on the market and now on my list of must get xmas beers"
"D: The beer goes down smoothly and is rather easy to drink because the smokiness is not overpowering and well incorporated into the smell and taste."
"The helles is the only thing better from this great brewery."
"Great to see this bottled offering here in Greensboro.Poured into a 1/2 liter stein a clear bronze with a fluffy white head,the lightest doppelbock beer I have ever saw but its clarity is nice.smoked summer sausage really sticks out to me in the nose along with a bit of iron.Smoked meat flavors abound,I mean it tastes like my moms summer sausage from back in the day,the oak makes this beer different than the others Schlenkerla beers.It tastes like oak fired pork,its an aquired taste,I used to cringe at this style of beer,now I search out this style,not for the faint of heart."
"Overall this isn't my favorite smoked beer made by Schlenkerla but you could make the argument that it's the smoothest and best-balanced. Worth a shot."
"I've become a big fan of Schlenkerla lately, and this is the best I've had. A real winner."
"drinkability: seems like it could be tough but i finished this one with ease"
"The most balanced beer I've had thus far from this brewery..."
"D - I don't like this as much as the Fastenbier, but it's better than the Urbock. In general there's just too much smoke and not enough balance. Glad I got to try it once, but not something I feel the need to have again. If you dig rauchbier, this is definitely a must-try, but I doubt you needed my endorsement to know that."
"Drinkability: This is right up there with my favorite beers of all time. Just an amazing brew. The smoke is there but not overpowering. It sneaks in very subtly. The oak is also there but not too strong. Perfectly balanced. I would love to see this be a regular offering."
"The restrained smoke, expertly balanced sweet and bitter flavors and light body make this a remarkably drinkable 8% beer. I'll be heading back for more before the keg dies."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, yet another nice smoked beer from this brewer to drink for a while."
"Regular doppelbocks can be a bit sweet for me - this one is very well-attenuated, showcasing the unique Schlenkerla malt flavor while ratcheting-up the drinkabilty to an obscene level. Seek it out."
"This was really a treat. The bar had several other very nice offerings and I came close to ignoring those just to have another Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche."
"The taste is like the aroma, tons of smoke and pork, mixed with some light grass. It is wonderful and way to easy to drink."
"Overall another tasty smokey beauty from this proud brewery."
"Awesome stuff! Schlenkerla did it again. My glass went down way too easy."
"On tap at Beachwood BBQ. Pours deep amber in color with a finger of preposterously dense white head with lengthy retention levels that left weblike lacing in its wake. The aroma is smokey, which is no revelation here, but underneath this I could pick up some subtleties of the underlying beer such as caramel malt and a crisp lager character. The flavor is much the same, the smoke dominates at first, but a doppelbock lies beneath it with a moderately malty backbone and crisp finish. Medium bodied and surprisingly bubbly as well. Interesting beer for sure, I think this type pairs better with food in general, but a very good example of rauchbier."
"Surprisingly creamy medium body with a softer smoke presence than I expected. There is still a good amount of burnt smokey malt flavor but the use of oak instead of beechwood results in a much smoother, less extreme smoke flavor. Still, there is plenty of smoked malt, barbecued bacon, butane and burnt wood in this incredibly complex beer. In addition, there is a lactic creaminess and a noticeable earthy wood presence, likely from the oak. Also, there is a slick, buttery white wine taste that was a complete shock to me. It added another level of complexity to this incredible beer. The only other beer I've tasted this flavor in is Allagash Vagabond and this element of Eiche reminds me of that beer. I'm also picking up a bit of earthy roasted nuttiness toward the end of the finish. Lingering dry and earthy smoked flavor in the finish. Highly recommended!"
"D: Wow. The flavors make no sense to me, but I love it anyway. The body is just right, and the 8% is undetectable."
"Drinkability, considering the smoke and the abv, is superb. Fantastic balance and amazing character. Honestly, should come as no surprise given the brewer."
"D: A nice lager all around. The most balanced of the Schlenkerla beers I've had, unique."
"Beer is light in body, tastes a lot like the marzen from the same brewery. There is a strong smoke character. Surprisingly smooth though, not like the urbock that almost makes me choke. This is definitely lighter than the other offerings from this brewery. The smoke lingers on my tongue though. Hard to reset the palate after this one."
"Drinkability: Easily the most drinkable rauchbier I've ever had, and most drinkable doppelbock I've ever had. I could sit in front of a fire and drink myself straight to the abyss with this, never realizing it until the wee hours of the morning when I try to stand."
"On draft @ Rich O's (Kentuckiana represent). I was expecting a much darker color given it's ABV, but it is a pale, golden color something like a Dortmunder, and drinks like a Helles Doppelbock. Overall impression is very good, however I am fond of richness of the UR Bock. The oak plays very nice with the body of the beer."
