review_text
"Lackluster in all realms that should be satisfying when associated with a Bock style beer. Poured it correctly but left no head. Fowl in appearance and in taste. Abv content on label is debatable, definitely a falsely advertised ""big"" beer. A great abundance of sediment at the bottom that's more than acceptable. Would not recommend it."

"Slow sipper, rich and aggressive in flavors, way over the usual doppelbock stats. Counts as a plus, but also as a minus. Careful with this one."

"O: A sticky sweet malt bomb that was complex and smooth enough to be interesting, but became a bit of a chore halfway through the bottle. Good for what it is though, thanks again Eric!"

"O - This is a malt bomb. It is high in alcohol and high is sweet malty flavors. I like it. I think is has aged wonderfully and developed into a very good beer."

"Incredibly complex & nearly as big, this is one of those brews that I'm happy to have experienced, because it's like nothing I've tasted before; it's like a lager was drowned in the liquid & resurrected. Very good beer."

"Previous review was a 4, didn't note which year.  Just had a 2011, which was pretty unpleasant once it warmed up a touch from being in the fridge -- 2.0.  Averaging the two for a 3 rating."

"O: One hell of a heavy dopplebock (triplebock?). Drinks like slightly watered down syrup. Lots of sharp booze which actually cuts the thickness a bit. Quite harsh once it's fully warm, alcohol isn't even remotely hidden. Complex with lots of malt character. I enjoyed this but drinkability suffers from the thickness and extreme booziness. A nice unique brew to try once but nothing I'd get again. Still tasty, regardless."
""
""
""
"Kind of what I expected. Not special, but was still nice to try once."
""
""
"Overall: this is a killer big beer. drink it fast though cause it is more abrasive as it warms. Kuhnhenn's makes some great big beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice offering but with most of their beers, an expensive one to bother purchasing again."

"Overall, I'm normally not a fan of doppel (or triple, even) bocks, but this was nice enough that I wish I had more than the one bottle."
""
"Nice, pretty authentic and rich flavor for an American doppel-triple-bock with a nice aged touch to it. A bit on the sweeter side and alcoholic as expected but fitting."
"Tastes very smooth...cocoa dusted dried bing cherries, malted milk balls and a touch of brazil nut. Maybe throw in some Cocoa Krispies. It fairly sweet as well. Mouthfeel is thick and rich...syrupy almost but never cloying. The malts are really complex and nice. About a 1000x better than Sam Adams attempt at a triple bock."
""
"Dark Heathen hoists a big and boisterous body; sticky, thick, and almost creamy on the mouth feel with low-medium carbonation. I was really taken back by how easy this was to drink... It holds the power of a 20% ABV brew while drinking more like a 6-7%. I wish I could have grabbed a few bottles of this, as it turned out to be one of my favorites of the day."
""
""
""
""
""
"The reviews about this beer are dead on regarding taste, smell, mouthfeel etc. I can only chime in to say if your into a sweeter beer with a heavy mouthfeel and a sweet nose but quite honestly all were perfectly balanced for me... than this is it... frigging 12.5% alcohol but I agree with most to say it's a slight alcohol warmth.... not burn... just try it...."
""
"Overall - I know it's supposed to be boozy, but this is pretty harsh. I hesitate to say I wish it were sweeter."
""
""
""
"O - Complex and a smooth sipper that will creep up on you very quickly. The extreme nature pushes the envelope way beyond the style and I'd much prefer a more traditional Doppelbock."
""
""
""
""
"M: deep body, rich, full, slightly cloying"
"O: Overall for as high in alcohol as this beer is, it is fairly well hidden with only a light presence in the mouthfeel. The beer needs to be slipped slowly but is enjoyable."
"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, Winter 2011 vintage. Pours hazy very dark reddish brown color with a small foamy khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lace instantly. Ni glass lacing, and a fair amount of alcohol legs. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, licorice, dark bread, earth, light nuttiness, wood, and light bourbon. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malty flavors. Taste of big raisin, prune, dried fruit skin, licorice, toffee, molasses, caramel, toast, dark bread, leather, light nuttiness, wood, light bourbon, and earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, toffee, molasses, caramel, toast, dark bread, leather, light nuttiness, wood, earth, and light bourbon on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of malty flavors; with almost zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial bock style. Great balance and complexity of malt flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"(O)- Overall, if you like tons of licorice, this might be your holy grail. Despite that, I was quite impressed with how well balanced this is while still keeping it toned down in the thickness of what it could be as well as the expertly well integrated alcohol. Reminds me of a more balanced, less alcoholic Samichlaus."
""

""

"O- Not only is this the perfect beer for the sub-zero night we are having but it is also one of the best bocks I've had. There was an extremely nice complexity in this with just the right sweetness and alcohol warmth to make you feel it but not detract too much from the taste. I definitely recommend checking this out if you like high abv beers with a nice sweet dark fruit complexity."
""
"Overall: I am really enjoying this beer. I'm not always a fan of the style, probably because it's such a hard one to get right. Kuhnhenn has got this one right."
""
""
"O- still pretty hot for being a year or so old. It's no Aventinus eisbock but pretty good and would like to try a 2 or 3 year old bottle."
"Drink- It was good. I admit I really enjoy Kuhnhenn anyway, It was a bit thin and a bit sweet and boozy, but sometimes a good bock can be that way."
""
""
""
"O/D-Cool beer. Not really my style, but I can now see why Kuhnhenn is a superb brewery. I am impressed by how well the flavors have melded together. Must try more from them somehow."
"Overall, this is an interesting brew. This is definitely not a session style ale and it is full of complexities to consider while sipping. For my personal tastes, this is not something I would go out of my way to procure again. This beer is more of a palate expanding experience for me as opposed to cherished drinking session."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a very nice dopplebock. Heavy on the dark fruits and very malty, this is a strong beer, but doesn't taste quite 12.5% ABV. Definitely worth checking out but a bit of a sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting, though not terribly successful beer. It's a bit too simple and overly sweet for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have never been a huge fan of doppelbocks, but I really enjoyed this one. I will certainly be getting a few more bottles in the future."
""
""
""
"Interesting taste and aroma; boozy, some sweetness, slightly sour and tart yeastiness, lacking the profound malt flavor I was seeking. A bit of breadiness but not nearly enough for my tastes. Some dark fruit, raisin and figs soaked in rum; fruitcake spiciness, caramel and brown sugar. An interesting beer that was entirely successful for me; Iâ€™d try it again but not at the asking price in NYC."
""
""
"Impressive, but it looks flat. There's nothing aesthetically pleasing about this brew. This brew has changed my views on Doppelbocks...I will never run from them again..."
"O: despite what may seem like mixed or hesitant descriptors, I have to say, I really liked this beer. The label says ""triple bock lager"" and I get it. The beer is lager thin, but bock dark - the advertised Vienna and Munich malts are obviously amazing - you have to love them. The decoction process used is no doubt accountable for some of the unique characteristics of this great beer as well."
"Nice strong lager, don't really get much ""bock"" flavor from it. Perhaps a touch of doughy sweetness from the munich malt. Over all a huge malty brew, flavorful."
"4, 4, 4, 4, 4"
"O: Probably the best double bock I've ever had. I think this is actually worth the $8.99/12oz. price tag."
"o - overall i remember this one being a bit better, but pretty sure last time i had the 2010 vintage...so perhaps the heat was toned down a bit. the flavor is great but the heat is on. glad i have another bottle set aside and will probably nab a few more while these are around. kuhnhenn continues to rock the house. their big beers are SO drinkable."

"Poured into a snifter. This is a dark brown or black with minimal carbonation. Smell is intensely sweet, with some hints of molasses, plum, and marshmallow. Taste is very sweet with some roasted graham cracker flavors followed by a slight alcohol burn. Very tasty. Very little carbonation. Alcohol is hidden fairly well."
"A big, sweet, and interesting beer that lacks appropriate body."
"Overall a huge sipping beer."
"Overall: dangerously drinkable. Alcohol is hardly noticeable. I need mo."
"O: a delicious and clean and unique brew with a great complexity and depth 5"
""
"The movie, Gone, was excellent, but maybe the beer made it better."
""
""
"O: This is good, but not $8.99 good for a 12 oz bottle. Always a pleasure to try all things Kuhnhenn but they do better on just about every other release comparatively."
""
""
""
"I really like the Kuhnhenns brews and pub. It takes a few true craft brewers to concoct these idiocenrtrc brews that are isolated aberitions of perfection."
""
"o - kind of hard to drink due to the massive sweetness, almost cloying at times. this is definitely a dessert beer or one to share with a friend. given the $6/bottle price i probably won't be returning to this one."
"Deep dark burnt brown and yes it has ruby highlights indeed. Carbonation is apparent from the bubbles I see, but head is not as it looks still. This is one opaque beer, held to light and can't see through, though it glows nicely. The aroma is faint, but contains some appropriate scents. Raisin, plum and brown sugar, vanilla and caramel. A truly distinct raisin, plum flavor / malt explosion. Undertones of cocoa are present as well. Some hop charecter is present, but faint. Slight flavor of alcohol and hotness. Mouthfeel is full but slick, kinda of oily. A truly tasty brew! A sipper to be sure. More carbonation would be nice."
"Very German in style. Honestly my least fav from them do far. It is good, they've just set the bar high."
""
""
"Heavy and rich palate, very fruity (raisins, berries, dates), some nice Munich malt flavors. Amazed by how German this tastes. There's no booziness at all, and it avoids cloying sweetness. Finishes toasty, slightly nutty. Remarkably clean stuff. I'm impressed."
"I can say that drinkability was very nice, but there's some definite heat, none of which affected the flavour, but it did make me take my time drinking this, and I don't normally find most things boozy. I wish I had got a couple more of these at the Winter Solstice, but it may be around again."
""
""
"O: This is another solid beer by Kuhnhenn. Honestly, do they make a bad one? I don't have much experience with lagers, but this was an interesting try. I think I should probably check out some of their other, less intense lagers and then revisit this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"I had the wonderful luck to try this beer fresh from the fermentation tank when the keg was first tapped and when it was half way through. The initial pours I had were phenomenal. The Munich Malts were so thick, it literally tasted like a milkshake and was grayish-brown in color, matching the maltiness. Weighing in at 13.5% ABV, you wouldnt even know you were drinking a beer unless you were told. Highly recommended!"
"Being that this beer is still super young, the beer looks like dirty mud water coming out of the tap, looks like it was taken from a swamp. A nice amount of swamp water head floats on top like a milkshake, some stickies. It looks terrible, but thats not the beers fault. it's intriging to say the least. Smell is alot of sweetners including brown sugar, some caramel, raisin and bread, it smells weird, but I cant stop sniffing it. Taste is on the sweet side with caramel/toffee influence and some English backbone. I get brown suga, whoppers, yeast, a splash of alcohol(estimated at 12-14%). Feel is kinda flat, the body has not came together yet, goes down like milk. I enjoyed this and am interested what an aged bottle of this would turn into. Much better than that Sam Adams creation by leaps and bounds, even at this infant stage."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"D - Very enjoyable and glad I got the chance to try this one. More like a barleywine then a doppelbock, but who cares, I liked it. Probably not many floating around but try if you can find."
"Overall, I was very impressed with this beer. Way better than the SA Triple Bock. Simply a great beer for the style. Hardly and booze shows as well. I highly recommend this one."
"Bottle. Pours a thick dark brown with ruby highlights and little to no head. Aroma is lots of sweet caramel malts, fruity, raisins, a hint of rum and a small hop note. Flavor is tons of molasses, plums, cognac. Very rich and satisfying with a warming finish from the big alcohol. Thick, sticky mouth feel with minimal carbonation."
"This is a solid dessert sipper and probably better than I was expecting given the reputation of ""triple bocks."" Sure, it's thick and not extremely drinkable but it's got a ton of flavor."
"12 ounce bottle courtesy of hoppymeal, thanks again for sending this Derek, 2006 vintage, last beer I split with Bill yesterday, color is a deep dark mahogany, close to two inches of light tan head that was pretty foamy leaves a small cloud later on, not much lacing though, aroma consists of port wine, caramel, toffee, booze, raisins, dates, sweetness, and rich sugars, flavor starts off quite sweet with various malts, sugar and dark fruits in the middle, finish is harshly hot with a big sweet aftertaste that lingers, wish it mellowed out a little as it warmed but that was not the case, too strong for my palate, sweet, hot, and malty mouthfeel, medium bodied, good amount of carbonation, taste lingered a very long time, had a hard time getting though five or six ounces myself, very strong and heavy, sweetness makes drinkability even worse, for being three years old already this beer still needs to age a lot longer it seems, brew is still quite hot with alcohol warmth, I will be the first to say this is much better than the only other triple bock I have tasted which is Sam Adams, would like to try this another three years down the road to see how it evolves and mellows, worth trying"
"D - The 6oz pour of this was plenty. The ABV is remarkably well disguised, but the buzz creeps up pretty quickly. The sour off-flavor also gets a bit distracting. I get the feeling that Triple (Trippel? Tripple?) Bocks may be too extreme, even for me."
"D - Considering the amount of punch that this beer packs, I'm quite surprised and ultimately relieved that the malts aren't horribly cloying in an effort to mask the alcohol. When viewed as a drink for a one beer evening, it works very well, and is quite enjoyable."
"D- This is the perfect sipper if your looking for a malty treat, it might be a little too sweet for some."
"Dark Heathen's very impressive. I've got a couple of small qualms with the nose and the body, but they're far from substantial. I am curious as to where the damn soy flavor is in this one. As a Tripple Bock, I was expecting some soy. ;~) All kidding aside. This is a damn good beer. Much more impressive than the Sam Adams Triple Bock, if you care to compare the two. Definitely recommended if you can find one. Thanks a ton, Derek."
"Not sure if it's diecetyl or not. Still shows in the mouth but isn't offending at all. Malty sweet with hints of chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, date, caramel, and whiskey. A nice sipper showing creamy accents and very little bitterness on the moderate finish."
"Finishes with a continual onslaught of malt extract, with plenty of sharp alcohol notes that cut through."
"I've been excited to try this beer for a while and I was pretty disappointed with it. It was way too sweet for my liking. I struggled to finish the glass. Maybe the yeast tired out during the fermentation process and didn't complete their job. Overall this doppelbock is unbalanced. This isn't what I've come to expect from Kuhnhenn's. Oh well, you win some you lose some."
"Pours a somewhat foggy rich mahogany with a tiny half finger khaki colored head that immediately disappears after pour. No lacing left on the sides at all, but this seems to be pretty common for this style. Smell is huge caramel malts with tons of dark fruits such as dates, plums, cherries, and raisins. Brown sugar emerges as well with some hints of honey. For 13.5%, there is no alcohol in the nose at all. Sweet syrupy caramel goodness all over the tongue with a good dose of molasses. A bit of vanilla comes about as well with a warming alcohol flavor towards the end. Very interesting mouthfeel, just about no carbonation at all with a huge creamy feel to it. How they hide 13.5% is beyond me. If I had to guess the abv without knowing it, I would say somewhere around 7-8%. My first beer from these guys, and it won't be my last. Thanks again Steve, let's set up another trade :) Please?"
"Pours a ruddy red/brown, small tan head forms, no lacing, head disappears quickly, gone completely, pretty cool colour though. Smell is insane, very sweet, toffee, figs, chocolate, very rich malt, insanely caramelized, some alcohol, a beast. Taste is similar, very caramelized and figgy, toffee and chocolate, sugary malt, rich, full flavour, no alcohol detectable, hidden well, surprisingly light finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation, good warming, very nice! Kuhnhenn scores another winner."
"goes well with dark chocolate, highly.. highly recommended."
"Sampled on tap at the Hop Devil in NYC for their Kuhnhenn night. The beer poured a dense brown color with a slight tan head that provided a nice little ring around the edge of the glass. The beer had a sweet, malty aroma with a slight hint of the high abv to come. The body was a nice big punch of malty sweet, caramel, honey and the big big abv. Some of the other Kuhnhenn beers that night masked the abv well but this one put it right out in front and makes for a nice full body and tasting beer."
"Floral aroma. Scotch colour dark brown and malty scotch aroma. Blind tasting of the baleywine say it was an old ale. Sweetish spice in middle. A real style bender. Full mouthfeel, a meal in itself. Bottles were available and I kick myself now. Alcohol not detectable."
"from the tap at the brewery. poured a deep amber to mahagany with no head. aroma wow big malty aroma with a big kick of alcohol. 13.5%, a nice sweetness like honey from the comb, fruity. flavor , the alcohol was a little on the raw side but not in a bad way ( the brothers usually hide the alcohol pretty well ) but this it just comes right out there and grabs you, malts nice sweetness. good sippin beers that you can enjoy with a good cigar"
