"Overall not a bad Winterbock. I did enjoy this on draft at the Va Beach GB. ABV is reported at 7.5%. Great with the GB garlic fries."

"Taste is, again, very much a roasty, malty, semi-sweet melding of dark malts, with a chewy caramel or toffee character dominating. There’s also an element of nuttiness in the flavor, which is perfect for a chilly snow day. This is everything a solid doppelbock should be. The body seems a tad light, but the flavor does not suffer. A solid drinking bock, and at a strong 7.5%, this is a deceptively enjoyable brew. Bravo!"

"I had this back in early December in San Diego, and didn't take notes. The thing I remember most is that it tasted very similar to Sam Adam's Winter Lager to me, with a slightly fuller body. Overall, very good taste and mouthfeel. Very enjoyable for an everyday doppelbock."

"On tap at the DC location near the Verizon Center. Pours a dark brown with plenty of light showing through and a small brownish white head. Aroma of some light roast and molasses sweetness but not much else. Flavor follows with watery sweet malts, a hint of roast, some dirty lager finish, then leaving some surprising sweet citrus on the palate. Light to medium bodied, not super crisp but goes down easy enough with adequate carbonation. Overall not exciting but not terrible."
""
"Overall – A very enjoyable doppelbock with tons and nice smooth flavors but yet maintaining a nice easy drinking feel."
""

"The Verdict: Not bad. A decent representative of the style, it’s fairly tasty and goes down smooth. Nothing to make it stand out, but nothing to complain about."
""
"Overall its a good beer and being a 7.5 abv it will kick your booty if you try and session with this. This beer came in a variety pack for 10.99 that alone makes it well worth the buy. I will buy again but not because its the best tasting beer. Rather its one of the best deals out there."

"O: A relatively big dopplebock, in terms of flavor. Worthy of the Bavarian references."
""
""
""
""

"O- this one hides the alcohol quite well, but I was looking for more of a malt profile that is typical of a doppelbock. Overall pretty good though."

"i have a confession to make. i am friends with the brewer at one location, and i got to try this before is was released to the public. it was about two weeks away from general tapping, but the beer was more than ready in the horizontal lagering tank in the cold room. he poured me a mug, and i had to drink it. the beer was sensational straight up. he was worried about the abv, and about the hops in the finish, thought a few more weeks would make it more acceptable to the masses, but i am not the masses. it was creamy and rich brown sugar in color, with a two inch khaki colored head that did not recede at all. the smell was cara-munich and cara-red malts, which affect the color as well as the nose, giving it a sweet doughnutty aroma. flavor is true to that at first, but a surprising hop kick comes in with a little wintery spice mix in the finish to crisp it up. this is what any winter lager should taste like. i hate to give this much props to a chain, but this is a brilliant holiday offering, better than most craft stuff on the market. the freshness of the hops might have made this for me, sort of english barleywiney in ways, but german malty. its special, and i hope its just as good in other mediums, but somehow i am doubting that it could be. for now though, suffice it to say that tis beer is a wonderful thing. heavy and light at the same time in feel, with a full body, sticky like honey, but like a memory foam pillow in the finish, in the sense that it fits your shape and rlaxes you slowly. this beer was top notch, and i wish that everyone could try it as i did tonight."

"The flavor’s decent — nice bits of caramel and bread. Finishes clean and keeps the brew drinkable. As doppelbocks go, it’s not as intense as I’m used to or prefer, but I might pick this up occasionally were I at the brewpub in wintertime."

"Found this in Maui in a mixed winter 12 pack was very impressed with the rich malty flavours that came out in this beer. The balance is good with the sweetness being balanced with a dryish finish. I also thought the mouthfeel was just right and looked forward to a second bottle"
""
"If you're in San Diego, the one in mission valley has and excellent brewer by the name of Doug Hasker. Give him your regards as you sample his fine craft."
"O - Glad I found this on tap at the GB restaurant at Raleigh Durham airport. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"D: Looks good, smells pretty good, tastes pretty good and mouth feel is good.. Not a bad little beer... At 7.5 ABV this is one or two beer session for me. Not a bad little brew from Gordon."
""
""
""
"This was a decent beer. Nothing really stands out. It was good once, but I wouldn’t seek it out again."
""
"Overall a pretty good beer that I will definetely keep in my collection. I haven't had many bocks before, but if this is standard for the type, consider me a fan."
""
"The palate opens with a blend of moderate bitterness and caramel and raisin bread. There's plenty of hop flavor, lending an earthy, flavorful backbone to this beer. The palate has too much of the caramel and dark caramel malt character without the bready flavors that you'd get from the better German brewed versions. Toffee, dark fruit, caramel and a touch of brown sugar are all present, along with a mild spicy note, especially on the finish. Medium in body with moderate carbonation (a little too much?), this beer is pretty solid and quite enjoyable."
""
"Appearance is a dark copper in color supporting a thick head leaving nice layered lace. Smell of big upfront malt and sweet dark fruits. Taste comes through as in the aroma with a malt sweetness and moderate alchohol. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Nothing complex thats mildly rough around the edges, but definately warming."
"O- Very impressed with this beer, a full flavored winter beer that is easy drinking. Received a Gordon Biersch sampler for Christmas and really enjoyed 3/4 beers including this one."
"O - Pretty good Winter bock style, I guess my first style like this, but German style beer is not really my thing."
""
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer but there are several others in the style that I would pick first."

"O: A worthy example of a holiday winter warmer or dopplebock. In some aspects better than Spaten Optimator on tap, which I use as my reference for this variety."

"A decent beer, but a little late in the overall taste. Would like it slightly darker."
"O - Very nice and enjoyable bock. ABV is hidden well and almost not noticed. I would recommend to try it if you get an opportunity."
"Shrug. A pleasant enough beer, but nothing so exciting that I'd probably want to ever order it again."
"D: Easily drinkable. flavorful, smooth and balanced."
"D- All in all it's a good beer, could be a little more balanced with a more rounded flavor but still a decent choice. Still gives you a warm feeling on the colder winter nights."
"On tap from GB in Washington, DC. Poured into pint glass. Pours a dark brown, decent head that left a nice layer of foam, but little lacing. Pleasantly sweet aroma of malts with some caramel. Flavors were stronger, and also had some dark cherries and a touch of chocolate. Smooth, just a bit creamy, fairly full-bodied."
"One finger slowly developing light tan, quick dissipation with no lacing. Clear amber brown body some visible carbonation. Nose is roast-dominate with a significant amount of sweetness, medium crystal with medium cherry-ish esters, floral hops in the nose. Taste mirrors the nose, a bit too sweet for style. Mouthfeel is fairly light for style, a wee bit of effervescence. Drinkability is ok, but the cloying sweetness in absence of roast character was a bit befuddling."
"Had this at GB Bolingbrook, IL. Pours a dark ruby not opaque with minimal tan head. No lacing at all down the glass. No discernable aroma, just a malty, sweet smell. Tastes very smooth, almost sweet malty. No hops detected. Mouthfeel again is very smooth and easy going down. Little carbonation feel. NOT a session beer as this made me a little giddy after just one! But is a great winter warmup if you plan to stay awhile and let someone else drive you home. Would drink again."
"A total comfort beer that I'll gladly pick up anytime I'm wanting a flavorful and reasonably-priced American version of this greatest of German beer styles."
"great drinkability....although high in alcohol content though"
"Sampled at Gordon Biersch restaurant in Dallas, TX. Pours hazy-amber hue with a slight tan head. Aroma is of sweet malt and some cherry. Body is medium, smooth. Taste is sweet caramel malt and cherry fruit. Short, malty finish. This brew is too sweet for me."
"Overall an ok beer, but it needs more balance. They should use more dry malts and less sweet malt. I guess the beer would be good if you have a sweet tooth but I do not. Though at the same time I know that the style this beer is tends to be sweet. The beer does have some nice qualities to it. Overall this is a slightly less than average take on the double bock style, though."
"D: Nice and easy drinking, could have several of these. Great beer for a relaxing session."
"D - I'm not a big fan of sweet brews but this was a very drinkable, delicious brew. I've had many GB brews at their brewpub on F street in DC and though not always overwhelmed I'm always pleased. GB Winter Bock is no less pleasing. A nice change of pace."
"A decent pick for the winter, clean and not spiced not anything off the wall. Its focus set on the style, enjoyable."
"Drinkability is solid. Defintely not the best dopplebock I've had, but surely not the worse. Good enough to revisit each winter."
"Overall: Visit Gordon Biersch and try this!"
"Drinkability - very decent brew. Filling, but not quite as filling as it could be."
"Pours a dark clear brown. Big light tan head. Smell is mild roasted malt with some chocolate notes. Taste is sweet and malty. Big chocolate flavor. Very nice full bodied mouthfeel. Creamy. Very easily drinkable. I really like this one overall. Great for a non-German doppelbock and a very nice winter seasonal."
"D - I can imagine that this is quite tasty when fresh. I got this as part of a Winter sampler pack and I think that the bottle went bad. I would buy this again fresh when it comes back in season."
"Easy drinker after walking DC on a 28 degree day."
"A very pleasant dark lager, I wish it had hit the market here before Winter is nearly over, arriving just a few short weeks ago. However it is a nice way to toast the last few remaining days of the season. I've been pleasantly surprised by other Gordon Biersch beers and WinterBock is no exception, being a solid pleasant strong dark lager that I will look for again next year!"
"Drinkability is good. No big alcohol presence, not too sweet. Good sipper, could have had another."
"Pours an opaque chocolaty brown with a fine-bubbled off-white head. Rich aroma is malty, spicy and just a little chocolaty. Flavor is mainly malty with a spicy undertone that is mostly cloves and cinnamon. Texture is pleasant, smooth and fizzy, going down nicely."
"Mouthfeel- Medium to full body, a little light on the carbonation, but not in a negative way."
"D - This is a flavorful dopplebock with lots of malt character. The dark flavors are a nice combination of caramel and subtle fruit, though they do also include some light roasted notes that technically shouldn't be there. Overall a nice beer that fits the season well."
"Carbonation was low with a light mouthfeel and a slight bitterness at end. A good and light but with a bite of bitterness and a smooth aftertaste and finish."
"Drinkability: Not a bad lil' doppelbock, though, it starts to kind of fall apart as it warms (seeming ever more alcoholic), so don't dilly-dally while drinking this one. I've been slowly, respectfully working through the recent influx of Gordon Biersch's bottled offerings and, while not outstanding, WinterBock is better than some of the others I've sampled."
"It's ok. I'd never seek it out, but probably wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"drinkability: a very solod dopple, extrmely impressed and more than expected."
"Drinkability: decent brew. flavor didn't seem as bold as other winter bocks i've tasted. enjoyable nonetheless."
"Flavor follows the nose and is rather light yet full bodied, and somewhat simple/singular at the same time. The body cloaks the ABV well yet delivers a short finish with a touch of cinnamon. Moderate malts work well with the carbonation to deliver a decent feel and drinkability. Nicely balanced."
"Drinkability- This was ok. I have had better bocks but it is still ok. An average bock but that's it"
"glassware: pint"
"Taste consists mainly of sweet burnt caramel and toasty malts, molasses and plenty of fusel alcohol. I was really disappointed in the two times I visited the brewpub in the ATL, but this beer shows some promise. A little more smooth chocolate maltiness and hide the ABV some and this could be a good beer. Overall, it is not a half bad attempt at a DB, but needs a bit more refinement to hang with the big dawgs from Deutschland."
"Beer poured a reddish brown with a nice lasting tan head. Nose initially was heavy on roasted malts, becoming sweeter as it warms. Taste is heavy on roasted malts and finishes somewhat sweet. Mouthfeel is pretty good as it is medium bodied, decently carbonated, and fairly smooth across the palate. Overall drinkability is pretty good. This is a pretty good representation of style and not bad to try."
"Pours a murky brown body, almost black with no lacing but a superfoamy two-finger tan head that takes forever to die. A mild, sweet malt smell of roasted and cocoa malt dominate the aroma (hints of coffee). Not a particulary thick bock, but not thinnish or syrupy either. A mild-mannered but pleasant sweetness, with hints of chocolate, caramel, toffee, butterscotch and other sugariness I can't think of. Not overly sweet, mind you. Has minor roasted notes and hops for a slick but hints of dryness on the backbite; not a milkshake here. Mildly warming also. ABV hidden well - I wouldn't guess a 7.2 except it is on the menu."
"D: Decently drinkable; if I had a sixer I wouldn't have any problems putting it away. I just don't care for it enough to seek out another."
"Drinkability: I wasn't prepared to like this as much as I did, judging from the other reviews, but this is a very nice bock"
"Pours a deep amber with little head which, i'll admit could be my fault as i'm using a new glass and mis-judged the pitch. Anyways, the head quickly recedes to a thin lacing. Smell is rasins, light prunes and very strong sugary- caramel malt. Taste is ripe apricot, rasins, and fruit followed by a drawn-out sweet, tasty caramel malt. Alcohol is almost undetectable. For how available and inexpensive this beer is, I'd say it's a fantastic brew but I had pretty low expectations..."
"A solid offering, no doubt and competitive with the original German versions, just not as complex. As mentioned, a bit too sweet and alcohol-y for my taste and could have used a bit more fruit (fig, plum) aspects instead of just caramel, which simply dominated."
"Personally, I find Gordon Biersch brews to be a little under whelming, but this is a pretty good offering from them for this particular style."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer, reviewed from notes, served a crisp ruby red with a thin diminishing head. The aroma was some sweet malts and fruits. The taste was a candy-like sweetness with some dried fruits and molasses. The beer was medium to heavy bodied with some warming alcohol and light carbonation. This one is somewhat enjoyable, but I'd probably not seek this one out again."
"Got it at Gordon Biersch in DC. Poured a solid tan head on a near black beer. Kind of a standard doppelbock, sweet and slightly spicy in both the nose and flavor. Not in any way bad, and actually really accessible (had a couple non-beery work friends there who really enjoyed it). One of the better brews I've had at GB."
"Pours dark brown with crimson hues and is topped by a good amount of tan head which doesn't fade too quickly and leaves a few spots of lacing behind. Clusters of carbonation bubbles cling to the glass as more shoot through the middle of the brew to the top. The malts smell of sweet caramel. Behind that are subtle notes of spice, cherries and vanilla. Tastes of sweet malts, cherries, coffee and hops. Mouth-feel is slighty creamy and it goes down smooth. Excellent winter ale, but not as spicy as some others."
"all in all its a fairly decent doppelbock, but not close to the better German examples of the style."
"D= This is a pretty solid dopplebock with an easy drinking flavor yet a solid alcohol kick. I look forward to this seasonal release every year!"
"Poured a very light brown/dark gold color with a good frothy head. The aroma was that of light malt and alcohol esters. The flavor was good German malts with that left over real lager twang, finished really dry, not sweet like a lot of bocks. A good seasonal beer."
"Well carbonated, providing a slight, nice prickly kick. Light to medium in body, this is pretty tasty and goes down smooth and easy."
"Deep mohogany opaque hue with a tan two finger head that slowly settles to a thin rim along the glass. Spotty lacing. The aroma was brown sugar with a little bit of caramel. The taste had a little bit of a candy like flavor mixing in with some more caramel flavors. The bitterness was low, maybe a little bit from the carmelized malts. Full bodied. The finish was clean with a little bit of lingering malts."
"The taste is similar, mostly burnt caramel, and raisin, some alcohol, toastiness, sweet with a burnt-caramel bitterness in the finish. It is somewhat full bodied and rather pleasant but the flavours a bit a mild and simple, almost one-dimensional."
"Pours dark amber, almost amber brown into my flute glass. Good head sits on top. The aroma is right on the mark for a doppelbock, raisins, bread crust, some alcohol, sweet. The taste is more of the same. Unlike other doppelbocks out there, this one is lighter on the palate and not quite as malty, making it relatively easier to drink and enjoy. Oh, and it goes well with pizza."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Fruity sweetness with a touch of burnt caramel. Not nearly as clean as some of the better German examples of the style I've tried recently, though not terrible either. Dried fruit and nuts, a bit of spice. Too sweet overall, especially in the finish, which becomes somewhat cloying after half a bottle. A decent beer, but I'm glad that I only grabbed 1 bottle."
"I was suprised to see this in bottles. And I guess I'll review this as the ""Vegas"" location (drives me nuts how every GB has a different location when from my understanding the bottles are produced at the same plant). Anyways...nice thick and creamy head, very dark ruby (clear) with a ton of lacing as it goes down. Smell is almost a hefe crossed with a stout. Some fruit aroma as well as a nice touch of caramel. Taste was good, very much in line with other ""winter"" beers. Somer dark fruit, caramel, touch of chocolate, and a stronger than expected straw or grass taste as well. Mouthfeel was pretty thick due to the low carbonation but I didnt really enjoy that, it tasted a little too flat for me. Overall a very good beer and another strong offering from GB."
"Drinkability: I know this is for the winter time, but this tasty brew could be enjoyed year-round. Very surprised by how good this was. This is on my ""return"" to list, for sure. This dark double bock lager is my favorite out of the Gordon Biersch variety box, by far."
"Impressed to find this beer floating around the Columbus area. Starts off with a rusty / plumby color with a mariginal head formation, but retained well. Aromas of rich malt and a light alcohol scent with a meaty, bready, savory character. Flavors are simple and clean and closely mimic the character found in the nose. Emphasis on the rich malt flavors, light on esters, and fermentation by-products. Heavy on the meaty notes. As clean as you could expect a dopplebock to finish, but with a long lingering malty richness."
"While I think I would tire of this after more than one bottle, it certainly can hit the spot if in the mood."
"Mahogany colored brew with an off-white modest head and medium lacing. Smells of raisin and spruce. The taste starts with alcohol and some more spruce hops, fig and apple. A bit strong in alcohol but it mellows as you go and takes on more malt sweetness. The feel is smooth, medium bodied with medium drinkability. A nice seasonal offering and recommended for a try."
"Pours mahogany translucent with a short creamy head. Good carbonation. Nose is dominated by semisweet malts and a tinge of alcohol. Taste follows with overpoweringly coffee-ish malts, moderately bitter, and rather astringent from the alcohol. It gave me a gag reflex slightly when I first drank it, was expecting a bit more balance and complexity. Overall, not too impressed. Maybe would be better on tap."
"The smell and taste are a bit thin, I guess I was expecting more. Slight sweet maltiness, warming alcohol finiash. Mouthfeel thin, without much going on. This beer is drinkable and not offensive. Maybe I had too high expectations, it was a cold windy day, and I wanted a nice hearty, malty bock beer. Too bad this didn't cut it."
"Served in a large mug with just a short cap of light tan foam across the surface, the very dark brown body revealed ruby highlights when held to the light. The aroma was malty with a hint of roastiness and a suggestion of chocolate. In the mouth it was medium bodied and smooth with a median carbonation that gently tingled on the palate. The flavor was fuller than the aroma suggested, and in addition to deep caramel with an almost scorched edge, there was some dark fruit, a hint of spiciness, and a bit of chocolate in the background. It could have been fuller, but I think that would hurt the drinkability. As it is it's quite nicely balanced, and very enjoyable. It didn't seem strong as the alcohol was never noticeable, and I'd imagine that it would be easy to order a third glass of this and head into trouble! Very nicely done!!!"
"D- Very drinkable winter brew. Perfect on a warm night. This is one of the best beer I feel that Gordon Biersch brews. Very nice Especially on tap."
"D- It is a decent Weizenbock but nothing to go crazy about. There are a lot better out there but it still is a decent beer."
"This beer is very drinkable. It goes down easily, with the 7.5 ABV is not worth having too many."
"When poured, it was a dark brown with very little tan foam. The smell has a mild aroma of roasted malts and a hint of caramel. The flavor was of roasted malts, caramel and a spice or two. Not overpowering on the alcohol or the bitterness/sweetness, but well balance between all three components. A pleasant tasting ale for the old and new year!"
"Comments  Am I the highball here? This was my first beer of the night so we cant blame it on intoxication. It is a terrific beer that I unrepentantly replaced with my usual weizen accompaniment to a dish of weisswurst and red cabbage."
"Overall: I am not overly fond of anything Gordon Biersch as it is. My mom had a few bottles of this, and I snagged one for the hell of it. I doubt I will ever dring this beer again. It was booring and mediocre at best."
"Overall, a very nice seasonal from GB. Perfect for sitting outside on a cooler evening in Honolulu. Very, very drinkable."
"Goes down readily, I think two will give you that ""Winter Warmer"" Feeling."
"Pours a golden dark amber color, nice carbonation, not much of a head though, and left pretty quickly, not much lacing as well, but what is there is sticking to the edges. Scents of sweet malts, slight hops, and caramel. The taste is kinda sweet and malty, nice warm feeling in the throat, there is a nice hint of caramel as well, leaves with a dry finish. Medium body, well balanced brew. Very drinkable, a nice Weizenbock from GB, would recommend."
"The regulars at the bar were lobbying for this to join the standard rotation and I can see why. Well done!!"
"Cheers to a tasty and fairly strong beer here, give it a try if you find it."
"D: Solid winter brew. Good times."
"This is really a different and very nice winter warmer that lives up to the name of 'warmer'...nice comfortable beer to finish an evening with."
"Flavorful and easy to drink, this is definitely one of their best."
"Mouthfeel is malty, sweet with a mild toffeeness hanging on to the tongue."
"An OK but in no way outstanding bock beer. I won't buy this again."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable and worth having if it is available."
"Drinkability: Pretty safe...I like the balance b/t sweetness and dryness. Highly sessionable and this works for me during the colder months. Recommended."
"Hops: Hallertauer Hersbrucker hops"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: No, it doesn't have the mind-blowing complexity of Salvator or the sinful richness of Koribinian. Still, this is a legit -- and quite tasty -- dopplebock that I can get at my local supermarket for less than $7 a sixer; you could do worse. McMicro shoots and scores."
"This is a seasonal beer, so grab one before the taps run out."
"Served on tap at the GB in Pasadena. Its a cloudy amber brown with a thin head on top. The aroma is spicy and flowery with a bit of fruity sweetness. The flavor is malty sweet with a bit of cinnamon and perhaps pumpkin but it is all a bit watery. There is no hop flavor to be found in the beer and overall it lacks quality, flavor, and complexity. There is certainly nothing exceptional about this beer."
"This is extremely easy to drink, dominated by the malt (caramel mostly). The flavor and aroma are extremely clean, but the flavor and aroma arent very strong. In fact, this is an excellently brewed beer without the slightest flaw in any way and theres nothing off-putting about it, but its rather boring."
"This beer was very simmilar to their dunkel but it seemed like an upgrade of the dunkel. The color and head were about the same but this brew had a great touch of spice that made this one worth comming back for. The malt profile filled everything out nicley but it was that slight hop/spice punch that really took this beer to the next level. I wish they would bottle this stuff!"
"On draught at the brewpub. This beer is a dark ruby-brown color with a medium thick and foamy light beige head. Thin lacing. Malt aroma is very pronounced, and there is some caramel as well. Creamy (if slightly thin) body with a fair amount of malt flavor, along with some chcolate and caramel. There was also a bit of a smokey character to it which was a bit of a surprise. The finish is mostly sweet malt, with a pinch of hops. This is one of Gordon Biersch's better offerings in my opinion."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a nice dark tan head that holds on most of the way down the glass and leaves a nice lace. Thick biscuity maltiness with almost chewy aspects dominates the aroma. Giant bready and sweet maltiness is all over the flavor here. Nice lightly roasty qualities to it with some almost chocolate-like qualities and some slight warming alcohol presence. This is borderline doppel territory here. Big bready, chewy and heavy body to this brew with a silky smooth mouthfeel. This put off my grumbling stomach for a bit with its huge body. Awesome cool weather brew, excellent for warming you up and filling you up as well. I would drink this all winter long if I had a GB near me. Much more flavorful than their generally dull brews."
