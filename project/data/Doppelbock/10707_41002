Nose is pungent and malty, with notes of iodine, caramel, and ripe red apple. Also exhibits a slightly metallic tang. Sweet, tangy and slightly bitter at first, along with a slightly unctious quality. Fairly bitter; bitterness lingers and does a great job of offsetting the almost intense malt sweetness. Notes of caramel and fruit which are evident in the nose are all but prominent on the palate, and there are some light honey notes that linger nicely, appearing just after the lingering hop bitterness. Seems a little bit thin, but the mouthfeel begins to come around as the bold, fruity malt notes are accentuated by the type of oiliness that I appreciate in this style. Alcohol is warming to be sure, but not overwhelming. Drinkability is very good, even dangerously so. Overall a very well rounded beer, not to mention an absolutely tremendous value.

Slight bitterness to it, otherwise very little taste of hops. A little bite from the fizz. Light mouthfeel - a tad watery for a Doppelbock. Easily drinkable, and a good beer - it could just use more complexity to it.","ndekke39","Jan 26, 2007"

Malty with maybe a bit of plum or fruitcake in the up front sweetness. Despite the maltiness, it is not a cloying sweetness. Won't say it finishes dry, but doesn't linger back there forever. And as the beer is very clean tasting and nice, any linger is pleasant. Mouthfeel no more than medium, and is perhaps a little light for the style. However, it is a darn easy drinking 7.5% ABV beer.

Smell is very subtle. There are sweet malts present, but they're so faint. So much of a good doppelbock is great aroma to me. I love the powerful caramel/roasted malt smell that so many have; this is nearly bereft of this. The first thing I notice is a halfway decent caramel malt flavour which is quickly overpowered by a pretty offensive bitter/spicy hop flavour. Quite spicy, actually. This would be a great attribute in another beer, but not a doppelbock and clearly, from what I am gathering, not *this* doppelbock. Mouthfeel is fairly average and on target for the style. Overall, I'm am delighted that I didn't spend money on this thing. As I always say, though, I *am* glad that I was given the chance to at least try it out. Not for me.","SilentSabre","Dec 13, 2006"

Nose is stronger than expected and is highlighted by caramely malts with a bit of roastiness. Alcohol notes are pretty noticeable too, invoking something like cherry brandy to me. I was surprised by the hoppy bite of the taste, which offset the malts more than I expect for this style. Mouthfeel is somewhat oily too, but not overly clingy. One bottle was enough for now, but I won't have trouble finishing the six-pack. Not what I expect for a doppelbock, but a decent beer in its own right.","BitteBier","Dec 10, 2006"

The taste is big, much bigger than I would have expected from a beer brewed by Trader Joe's. Malts are without a doubt the dominant flavor, in fact its hard to tease out any other taste to it. You can tell that the beer would be sticky if it were spilled, if you can imagine what that tastes like. This is a decent beer, and for the price it can't be beat.","Toddv29424","Dec 08, 2006"

Already I feel a bit green around the gills. Into the mouth, it discovers a sweet and peppery amalgam of thick liquid Zantac® flavored with things that don't sound appealing, like rose hips and chamomile. Perhaps if I were a starving monk enduring the days of Lent I might be more charitable towards this liquid bread, but as it is, I need a ham-on-rye sandwich to abrade my tongue and get this strong sweet brew off my taste buds.

Malts seem to be slightly lacking but there's tons of smoky alcohol elements. Caramel and figs are noticeable and the finish leaves me with a coating of dark fruits but it seems like the malts were all used for the yeast, nothing was left over.

Carbonation is much lower than I thought from all of the fizz. Thin mouthfeel. This falls short of a dopplebock, but does have a good flavor.

Aromas of malts and chocolate dominate, with some caramel in the background. Taste is medium to full bodied, with a robust overall character. Flavors of caramel, roasted malts, chocolate, and some warming alcohol go fine together, but remain oddly out of place on the palate. Mouthfeel was thin, with a touch of warming due to the higher alcohol level. Average drinkability. Not bad, but not for me...","Frozensoul327","Jan 29, 2006"

It is decently carbonated and is keeping my palate interested. Drinkability is OK, abv is well hidden. This one grows on you as the heavy toasted malts are very overwhelming at first.

Dark grains are way underneath and come across as dry cocoa and a tinge of black soured grains. No hops to my palette in taste or bitter. The alcohol is a bit rough and may be hiding them.

Not very complex and good none the less. The mouthfeel was thick, but went down nice and smooth. It didn't even bother to hide its alcohol content of 7.5%.
