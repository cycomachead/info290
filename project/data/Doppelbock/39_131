The dark fruit, light chocolate and vanilla, caramel, toasted grains, etc. The taste actually reminds me of a weaker version of Dogfish's Palo Santo Marron. It packs a lot of flavor and is extremely dribkable. A winner in my book","Bone53","Apr 02, 2015"

Smooth and creamy, with rich coffee, fig and cherry flavors, flat root beer and a quick burst of malt sweetness.  The total package.  Pairs exceptionally well with high-quality chocolate -- and it comes with a toy for the kids, too.","thebeers","Apr 02, 2015"

4.6,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.75,"Poured from an iconic 12 oz. bottle, complete with miniature plastic ram, in to a small glass mug. The assertive carbonation yields a massive, mounded head of foam that resembles an oven-rising baked biscuit. The beer has a deep chestnut brown appearance with tawny accents. It smells of fresh-baked whole grain bread and a vague notion of sweet nuttiness. Earthy accents of soy sauce and molasses are present in the nose as well. The flavor is very malt-forward, but steers well clear of the cloying sweetness that so many other malt monsters convey. There's some dark fruits, with hints of subtle tart black cherry. A mild earthy hop profile perfectly accentuates the distinct Bavarian flavors. Suggestions of smooth, sweet dark coffee and minerals linger in the aftertaste. The texture of the beer is phenomenal. Rich and creamy velvet perfection. Oh so easy to savor. For such a hearty beer, this is sooo easy to drink. It's simply a masterclass. I've yet to try a dopplebock, foreign or domestic, that I put in the same league as Celebrator. From the iconic artistic style, to the wonderfully smooth texture, to the refined Bavarian taste, this one is just incredible. The definition of world class.","JohnnyI","Feb 01, 2015"

4.45,2.5,4.75,4,4.75,4,4.5,"Pours a dark amber with a deep dark ruby cast.  Excellent head volume, World Class lacing and retention.  Light nose of molasses coupled with a bit of dark fruit (plum, fig) and a slight undertone of spice.  Medium bodied with a nice smooth texture that has creamy aspects.  Below normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence in the finish. The World Class flavor profile is reasonably intense, very complex and superbly balanced.  It begins with a wave of sweet malt that is, at first, caramel and slightly burned dark sugar then flows into a rich molasses.  In the middle as the molasses fades, dark fruit becomes evident as does an ever so slight hop bitterness.  The finish is a slow sweet fade with notes of alcohol.","tillmac62","Jan 12, 2015"

This brew is made to perfection for a doppelbock. Nice tan head followed by lace.  I also reccomend the Smuttynose S'muttonator, a doppelbock.

Pours a dark brown color with a phenomenal thick foamy head that almost spilled over. Furthermore, the creamy lace retains throughout the whole drink. Wonderful aroma reminds me of coffee, dark slightly bitter chocolate, and sweet earthy grains. Taste aligns with aroma and includes an aftertaste that is creamy and with a tiny touch of hops. Furthermore, there is a mild alcohol aftertaste like a dark dessert liqueur. Great feel; carbonation light but tingly on the tongue when served cold. This is the first doppelbock I have reviewed here and I feel like I have struck gold by picking amongst the cream of the crop for this style.

I am in no way suggesting this is undeserved, nor that this is a poor quality beer in any way, shape, or form, but it is not my favorite doppelbock as a devout malthead. The odd notes that seem like hops trying to come a little too forward for my liking cut down on my enjoyment - when I want a doppelbock, I want glorious, unrelenting malt and associated flavors, not anything trying to balance or even display hop flavors. Hence, my rating this beer below other doppelbocks, in spite of my unabashed Privatbraurei Aying fanboyism.","UrbanCaveman","Oct 08, 2014"

Almost no light comes through when held up to light.  Definitive chocolate and malt flavor with notes of coffee and perhaps a distant plum.  Sort of a roasted taste on the back end.  Smooth mouth feel with some bitterness and carbonation.   Reminds me of some porters I've had.  Low alcohol by volume, almost too low but I like beers with a higher than 6% ABV.  Overall a very agreeable beer that I would drink again.","BeerSnobRobinson","Oct 03, 2014"

The aroma is malty, with notes of dark fruit and dark toffee. The taste is equally malty, with a nice herbal hops to balance it and a slight spicy quality to the finish. The body is thick and full, almost heavy like a Scottish ale. A great example of a doppelbock.","delta490","Sep 30, 2014"

4.5,3.7,,,,,,"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 5C). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L4013. AROMA: sweet and pleasant malt aromatics with some toasty, bread crust and caramelly notes. no hop aroma and very faint dried grapes aromas. APPEARANCE: dark Brown color with ruby highlights. good clarity. average moussy head with dark ivory color and good retention. TASTE: very nice flavours ranging from a plethora of melanoidins with toasty notes and bread crust. sweet malty background with a clean lager profile without any kind of diacetyl. low bitterness. finishes semi-sweet. PALATE: medium-full body with moderately-low carbonation. smooth. OVERALL: a very nice exemple of a traditional doppelbock which is delicious and a feast for the senses.","titvs","Sep 28, 2014"

Packaging is beautiful with the dark brown bottle as backdrop for the light blue label punctuated by the amber-red glass of beer. The finishing touch which I love (see picture) is the small goat hung from a red thread--just a classy finishing touch to say ""we’re really proud of our product."" Very eye catching. Beautiful nearly black, amber color so inviting with the creamy tan head, washes smoothly, beautifully over the tongue very complex but well blended flavors with ever so slight chocolaty notes to me, some bitterness on finish but not overpowering. The only thing that detracted for me a bit, resulting in a slightly lower aroma score, was the aroma upon finishing the pour--it was slightly--no other word for it--""tin canny."" Ever so slight but just noticeable. It did not in any way come through in the actual taste of the beer and was then indistinguishable by half way through the glass of beer (drunk from a stemmed, rounded belly goblet that allows aromas to experienced well). This was my first tasting so it may have been an aberration. Aside from that aspect, which I can’t call ""very minor"" since, for me, the pre-first drink aroma experience is part of the overall experience, the beer is superb. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. As a matter of fact I did and he fell in love with it.","JSigsbach","Jul 06, 2014"

AROMA: chocolate, prune, malt, some cola--grapefruit and even some bourbon--in a word, impactful!... PALATE: active cola feel with a subdued effervescence--strong, staunchly full-bodied, and pronounced in its aftertaste...TASTE: ditto on the aroma--stacked malt catapults this past the normal dough/biscuit flavors and into a field reserved for beers I'd break my fast for--the aged alcohol pairs well with the chocolate...OVERALLL: In some ways, a goat's butt to the taste buds--nothing subtle or soft about this doppelbock...a perfect nightcap or dessertif.","dacrza1","May 19, 2014"

I normally don't drink this type of beer, being an IPA guy, but as this beer had great ratings, I thought I'd give it a try. I was not disappointed at all. A: Dark Brown molasses almost, with a nice light brown foamy head that dissipated after a bit. S: Very inviting, roasted caramel, nutty and raisin-like. T: The taste matched the smell with a caramel-nut-raisin taste. I could imagine drinking this fire-side. M: Tasted great in my mouth. Very little hint of the alcohol, if any. Smooth, refreshing. If you stick this in the fridge, be sure to let it sit a good 15 minutes before drinking. You don't want to drink this ice cold. Let it warm up. Very pleased and looking forward to drinking the three others.","Seanem44","Apr 28, 2014"

4.5,3.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a deep brown with a reddish tint and a one finger off-white head that receded to an off-white ring leaving abundant lacing. Very nice looking. Scents of rich caramel, sweet molasses, dark fruit, especially prune, brown sugar and bready malt. Very malt forward and rich and very true to style. Excellent. Flavor begins incredibly malty, with notes of molasses, dark fruit, especially prune and raisin, a light flavor of German hops and a light hint of chocolate, moving into some moderate smooth and warming alcohol and a light toasted flavor. Finish is dry with warming alcohol and slight chocolate. Aftertaste is malty and rich. A very nice, strong, rich, malt forward flavor, a classic example of the style. Excellent. Mouthfeel is full bodied with light carbonation and a smooth feel. Very nice, smooth and easy to drink, yet full bodied. A classic, true to style feel. Overall this is an excellent doppelbock. It hits every last style note in every last category and does it well. A joy to drink and probably my favorite example of the style.","Auraan","Apr 22, 2014"

4.14,-4.6,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a deep brown that nearly appears black; hues reminiscent of dark oak push through only at the fringes. A generous, 3 cm layer of khaki-colored head developed and lingered briefly. Minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel, molten brown sugar, warm molasses, and earthen grains. The flavor amplifies these notes and adds a nice bready background flavor/texture. Some fruity elements - date, plum, and even a hint of pear - push through on the finish. Mouthfeel is superb with a viscous, full-bodied consistency and clean, slightly effervescent finish. Overall, this is something of a “style-defining” beer for me, and I tend to gauge the quality of other dopplebocks against it. Celebrator is well balanced, full-bodied, and rich in flavor; combined with its availability and affordability, it’s a first-class choice.","eclipse54","Feb 20, 2014"

Certainly this brewery is one of the best at executing traditional German styles and I delved into this with high expectations. Enjoyed on tap at Craft Beer Market in Calgary, served in an authentic Celebrator glass. Aroma is full of dark, sweet malt and buttery notes: Dried dark fruits, butterscotch, molasses, espresso, and (unexpected) some celery seed spice. Where am I getting that from? Its there, I swear, probably a yeast phenolic element or due to spicy hops. Tastes like chocolate-covered coffee beans, fresh pipe or cigar tobacco, dates and raisins, prunes ... Smooth, creamy mouthfeel yields a chocolate milkshake effect. Rich and sweet but earthy in the finish, with a moderately thick body that coats the mouth. I found that the bitter, earthy, roasted flavors were more salient for the first half or so, at which point more of the sweet buttery flavors reared their heads. The alcohol is warming but not aggressive. Believe the hype, its one of the best doppelbocks I've sampled and strikes a near-perfect balance between roasted, earthy bitter, and sweet domains.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 27, 2014"

It was definitely worth a try though, and I would recommend it heartily to people that don't enjoy lighter beers and dislike the charred coffee taste of stouts and lagers. It's sweeter and not as harsh as some of the stouts that I enjoy, but I wasn't much of a fan of the alcohol on the nose and palate.

Very dark brown, some ruby when held it up to a light. Very creamy, very sweet but not overly so. Crazy complex flavors. Those biscuits are prominent, some spicy (cinnamon, nutmeg) notes, vanilla, bourbon, cherries, caramel, toffee, smoke, honey, banana, clove, roastiness. I could go on, and on, picking random flavors I recognize out of this. But this beer is more than the sum of its parts. Sweet finish, this is not a beer you'd want to drink a ton of, it's more of a dessert/special occasion beverage.

This 'Doppelbock' style beer pours a very dark brown, almost black with a khaki creamy head that doesn't last long. Not much lacing around the glass for this one. Aroma is very pleasing with hints of molasses, raisins, caramel and butterscotch. The taste is the same with a hint of chocolate as well. One of the best that I had in a while for this type!","BeerWithMike","Jul 25, 2013"

Smell is roasty and chocolatey, with some light caramel tones and a bit of molasses.  The dark roast really shines in the taste, with a slight bit of dark chocolate. This is a really big-bodied beer, very silky smooth. Overall, this is one of the best bocks out there, with a great price!","timontheroad","Jul 25, 2013"

I doubt that is where the name comes from, but this is such a tasty beer, I might buy another one on my way home tonight. We are going to some grand opening somewhere… free appetizers and free drinks. Not sure what, but it should be fun. I don't even know what the place is called! Anyway, I am excited to try a new bar and hopefully they have some good cocktails available. If not, I will leave and find a bar offering Celebrator. CHEERS!","rickyleepotts","May 15, 2013"

Smells of burnt sugar, maple syrup, toasted bread, phenols (a bit medicinal), and of dark fruit, perhaps dates or figs. Tastes boozy on the front of the palate but it is balanced nicely in the middle by the malted sweetness of residual sugars and caramel, followed by a bready hopped twinge at the end but it finishes smooth and stays thick throughout the whole tasting experience. The balance and body are perfection. So smooth on the palate. Sticky, chewy until the swallow. This brew is world class. I haven't had many doppelbocks, but I could tell from the first sip that this was something special. It's very complex as the esters, phenols, malts, booze, and hops balance perfectly with a thick, chewy body on the palate.","Jacurdy60","Apr 28, 2013"

Malts are sweet, but never coming anywhere near cloying. There is a kiss of herbal hop bitterness on the finish as well. Just the right strength...some doppels, especially Americanized ones, seem to think they must clock in at 8 or 9 percent. This is one of those beers that you go back and revisit and wonder why the hell it has taken so long to buy again! This is the best doppelbock out there when fresh, I dont even really think it is debatable. Delicious.","twiggamortis420","Apr 24, 2013"

Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fluffy khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, raisin, toast, toffee, molasses, apple, dark bread, cocoa, light roast, light nuttiness, and light floral. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malty notes and light fruity esters. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, molasses, apple, dark bread, cocoa, roasted malt, light nuttiness, and light smoke. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, molasses, dark bread, toast, raisin, apple, roasted malt, cocoa, and light smoke on the finish for a good bit. Excellent flavor balance and complexity of robust malty flavors and light fruity esters; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent doppelbock! Great balance and complexity of robust malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Feb 09, 2013"

I have trouble envisioning a more finely-crafted bock than Celebrator - it really is the gold standard; the doppelbock that other doppelbocks should aspire to be like, and an amazingly drinkable strong lager that I will definitely pick up again at some point. Highly recommended to newbies as an introductory bock, and something worth stocking up on if it isn't always available in your area.","thehyperduck","Jan 04, 2013"

About a finger and a half of khaki colored foam crowns the beer and shows a little bit of endurance. Lacing leaves something to be desired though. The nose is comprised of a very nice blend of biscuit and toffee aromas. The flavor profile has a bit more depth, as a light dusting of chocolate serves as a bridge from the toasty bread to caramel centerpieces, and a subtle dried fig note appears during the finish. If at least of those secondary characteristics was a bit more developed, everything would be just about perfect. The body is picturesque, full and sturdy, while remaining as far away from viscous as a sub 7% ABV beer should. Carbonation is nicely understated. It's easy to see why Ayinger's Celebrator is considered a classic version of the style.","axeman9182","Dec 27, 2012"

Taste is less fruity, almost like a smoked beer with tobacco, chocolate, savory meat, cinnamon. Nice mix of roasted coffee and mild, sweet barbeque. Raisins, brown sugar, black cherry soda and caramel come through. Overall very drinkable, lighter palate, neutral aftertaste. Fairly decent, but again this is one of the few decent doppelbocks to be distributed stateside. Like almost all German beers, they don't hold up well in the bottle.

The profile begins with a smooth hit of tangy molasses, but directly before that flavor gets to be too much, the profile shifts to a great hit of hop bitterness and a twinge of alcohol. In addition I got a bit of what I think may be coriander, and it was all wrapped up beautifully with a harsh smoke note and a beautiful caramel coffee finish. It is not often I find doppelbock, but when I do I snatch up every bottle I can get my hands on.","RussBecker1","Oct 30, 2012"

4.52,4.1,3.5,4,5,3.5,5," I have had interesting results aging this beer. Most bottles at 2 or 3 years old have lost some of their intense malt and fruit flavors, but have mellowed and integrated into an interesting malty bock. Some bottles lose most of their flavor and are not that interesting. A few others develop into a superb creamy, malty uber-bock that is very delicious. Most of these bottles were from a case that I cellared, so the differences are probably not due to batch differences. The worst of these is still ok to drink and most are still very nice, so it has been worth it for the exceptional aged bottles.","LiquidAmber","Jul 31, 2012"

4.45,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours medium to dark brown, with lighter brown edges, where light passes through. This beer looks remarkably like a cola. The foamy head, the carbonation bubbles that accumulate on the side of the glass and the lighter brown glints around the bottom and edges of the glass are reminiscent of a glass of brown cola. The aroma is rich and quite large. Horehound candy, sorghum, prunes, and heavy brown sugar characterize the nose. The flavor is so big it's nearly vulgar. I said nearly. There was still quite a bit of a tact employed in stopping just short of over the top. It is almost like drinking liquid candy. I respect this beer for how bold it is, if for no other reason at all. I've had imperial stouts and barleywines with less personality. All of this big malty flavor at only 6.7% ABV. Probably because the beer was engineered in a fashion to retain more unfermentable sugars. I detect some chocolate liqueur, brown sugar, and prunes. There's just the faintest bitterness at the finish to help offset the sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied with very little scrubbing on the tongue. This is not necessarily a style that I'd say is in my wheelhouse, but I do appreciate this beer. I wish it wasn't $14.99 a four-pack. Otherwise, I'd keep it in my fridge all the time as an alternative to port wine for an after dinner dessert drink.","DocJitsu","Jul 15, 2012"

Some transparency can be seen around the edges as well as a few bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates into a nice cap of lacing atop the beer. There are faint smells of dark roasted malt, molasses, and some alcohol. It's bready as well as malty sweet and I can definitely taste the alcohol in the finish. There is some dark fruit flavor as well. The flavors of dark fruit really open up as the beer warms. The body is light to medium and there isn't much carbonation in this beer. It looks like it would be a heavy beer, but it's not. It has a crisp and dry finish. This is a solid beer and a great example of the style.","acevenom","Apr 18, 2012"

3.93,-9.4,3.5,3,4.5,4,4,"Found this at McCoul's in Greensboro, North Carolina. It's a deep dark brown color with a modest off-white head and vague lacing. The aroma is modest malt with a hint of raspberry sweetness. The flavor brings on tasty chocolate- cherry malt with a light licorice undercurrent that balances it out. Very nice. It had mild carbonation and is medium bodied with a smooth smooth feel. In the end, this was a fun brew and easily recommended.","Durge","Apr 12, 2012"

Wont even bother to rate the various aspects, from the initial sniff to final drop it is one helluva beer, Sourced fresh on tap made a believer of me.","adjunctjonez","Apr 02, 2012"

Just a bunch of malty goodness. Flavor surely follows. Molasses, burnt sugars and caramel malts lead the way. Some more subtle dark fruit notes and a hint of earthy hops close this one out.

Tons of sweet caramelization, molasses and bread up front, with some dark fruits right behind it. The taste is more of the same with a perfect balance of warming alcohol and just enough hop bitterness to cut through the primarily sweet flavor profile. The mouthfeel on this one is absolutely insane, probably the best beer I have ever had. Overall, this is a very nice beer and definitely worth seeking out.

A very rich, malty beer that is not for the faint of heart. It is quite bold in its approach and if you happen to like Belgian quads, you may find this beer to be a great way to mix things up. Although quite different and much more 'chocolaty', it has the thick and heavy body of a rich Belgian quad and the darker characteristics of a porter. Overall, this beer is COMPLETELY different from Trappiste Rochefort 10, but a magnificent beer nonetheless!","Agent1","Dec 11, 2011"

Taste has some toasted dark bread/cereals, some chocolate, toffee and light grain notes. Loads of malt flavour. No alcohol on the palate but catches up after a couple of bottles. Smooth, sticky and drying body and finish. Opens up and really becomes something else at around room temp. Didn't understand the comparison to liquid bread until I actually got into this.

Feel is medium to thick, a little creamy. The taste is like it smells, lots of malts, almost too much, no real hop balance, but this is probably right for the style. I get a little banana, some dark fruit and lots of molasses.

Too sweet, that is.","ElCommodoro","Sep 08, 2011"

Big and malty, this succeeds where other doppelbocks fail by being not too sweet for what it is. A strong dark fruit component with malts that are tamed a bit and nice dark fruit and bready components. This actually reminds me of Dr. Pepper a bit, but not as carbonated and obviously not nearly as sweet. Pretty big body with good carbonation, this is a winner. Overall, I liked this one a lot and it shows what a doppelbock can be when the sweetness is toned down a touch.","seeswo","Aug 20, 2011"

Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, pretty rich, sticky finish. We started the tasting with this and everyone thought this was the gold standard.

Smelled of leather, toasted malts, molasses, a bit of sweet dark dried fruit. Seemed almost quad-esque, sans the spicy yeast.

This brew poured up a hefty dark mahogany-colored body with a thick one-fingered tan colored with retention lasting long after the beer was gone and amazing lacing effects. Aromas of warm dark bread, caramel, molasses, malts and hops, and a very slight hint of alcohol. Of the doppelbocks, I am sure that this one reigns supreme!

The taste of the beer was had many of the elements that were on the nose, it was sweet upfront which faded into a nice caramel bitterness in the end.

Great exemplar of the style, as its full bodied but light on the finish--no syrupy or winey over-production here. Color is a translucent chestnut-red brown. Nose is burnt toast. Mouthfeel is silky. Tastes like toasted oak (by which I mean the flavor that you get from over-oaked California chardonnays, but in the Celebrator a good thing). So, vanilla, burnt sugar/glaze, and . . . I'm serious, Kraft's dark milk-maid caramels (but without the sweetness). Finish is long and dries, reminding you that this is a beer.

I consider it one of the best possible beers to cook with. It's exceptionally well balanced between malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Plenty of spice to it as well, but not so much that it throws it off balance, in fact it enhances the balance. I don't rave like this about many beers.

Fuller bodied with tight carbonation, smooth up front with a slight resinous feel toward the end.

Off white/beige head fills the top of the glass then slowly recedes, leaving a crackly 1 finger worth of cloud-like head that never dissipates. Smell- Molasses, tea leaves, faint bourbon, bready malt. Taste- molasses first to the back of the throat. A roasty faint coffee flavor next. Oh wow. So much going on here, very hard to describe the complexity of this brew. There is a definite appearance of a bourbon flavor here, but it is offset by the roasty bitterness. I'm shocked. Why the hell haven't I been drinking dobblebocks all along? This is an amazing brew. I now forgive the Germans for their short-sighted Reinheitsgebot laws. Mouthfeel- this is perfection.

Leaves a huge amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is brown sugar, a light nuttiness, roasted malt, molasses, and a yeasty breadiness. The initial taste is a sweet nuttiness with a good amount of roast. Brown sugar is also present along with molasses. The finish has some more nuttiness and breadiness as well as a light bitterness.

The color was a very rich, dark reddish brown, that when poured into a tulip glass cascaded back into itself for about 30 seconds as the head built to a good 2", that lasted until you licked it off the edge of the glass.The head was a dark amber with small bubbles. After the cascading ceased it was a very clear pour. WOW Taste was lightly sweat and bitter at mthe same time, remarkable! Body had a full, creamy, thick feel, and a lively, slightly bitter finishing that was just right. WoW, this is one beer to keep around for youself, don’t share it as the store may run out.

Not a Doppelbock fan so my grade for this beer will not be as high as others. The color was a ruby clear amber. The aroma had hints of honey and malt. The taste was very tart and sweet. Not a huge fan of the sweet malts that are generally put in Doppels. Due to the sweetness, the mouthfeel was rated lower than other beers.","WoodBrew","Apr 28, 2011"

The key to this brew was balance and complexity, there were a lot of different things going on with the flavor and somehow they all came together nicely. This beer seems like it would go good with some nice BBQ are any other hearty dinner, it has good drinkability. Everything about this brew was on par for it's style and I really liked the dark fruit aspect of this beer, it was a nice mixture of dark fruits and was done better then any other Doppelbock I have had. This beer would do a fine job at representing it's style in my fridge, it may share some room with Bell's, but since this is available year round I see more of this brew to come in my future. If you like this style then you have to try this beer, it is a perfect example of it's style and certainly lives up to the hype.","StoutHunter","Apr 26, 2011"

The initial taste has a large amount of molasses flavored sweetness with some of the fig and dates notes. Some of the grape flavors linger around like wine esters.

Dusty cocoa, roasted barley, nuts, fruit bread, molasses, caramel fill out the body which is not nearly as thick or sticky as some in the category, relying more on the smooth dryness.

The aromas are very bready. There's slugfest of yeast and malt with some caramel and brown sugar and it is pretty mild overall. It tastes of malted barley, brown sugar, molasses, and bready yeast. It also has some subtle dark fruits to it. It drinks really well and is light to medium in body. It has good crispness and goes down smoothly. This is an excellent doppelbock, definitely worthy of its ranking.","aasher","Jan 27, 2011"

Dark, roasted, bready malts, nuttiness, chocolate, coffee--really just a complex, and impressively drinkable beer that gets better as it warms up. I recommend not drinking it too chilled as it masks a lot of the flavor. That's the best thing about the beer, is that each sip is better than the last. Anyhow, I recommend this doppelbock to any beer drinker. Unquestionably worth the $14 for a four-pack.","Noahman23","Jan 27, 2011"

The malty sugary smell make up the great majority of the aroma with the caramelized sugar notes, but the stars of the show are the clove and slight banana notes that are present as if a wonderful mild Belgian yeast fairy dropped it into this smooth doppelbock. The taste takes some getting used to still as there is an acidic malt flavor that does tend to ruin what is a wonderful malty and clovelike taste. The mouthfeel of this particular beer is pretty damn smooth. While it isn't the easiest drinking beer that I've ever had it's pretty darn near the top 10.

Aroma is rich maltiness with melanoidin-toasty qualities, dark fruits (plum, prune and dried grapes) originating from the malts used rather than fruity esters of yeast, dark chocolate and some caramel. Malty flavor with melanoidin-toasty qualities, chocolaty with roasty notes, non-harsh alcohol warmth and some hoppy bitterness towards the finish which is quite dry for such a dark Doppel Bock. Very clean lager character with less fruitiness than in the aroma. The body is medium with moderate yet fine carbonation allowing smoothness to this nearly flawless beer.

The molasses and dark fruits in the nose are prevalent in the taste. Prunes, raisins, and dark cherries. Dark, roasted malts (not bitter by any means) make an appearance with a strong caramel presence. The more it warms the more the flavors begin to develop.

The taste is initially slightly metallic and then overcome by dark fruits and sugar. The molasses makes itself dominant mid taste. At the end theres a very nice burnt taste along with dark coffee.

The taste holds notes of caramel, cinnamon, rye bread, dark wheat, light molasses, and a touch of maple syrup. The maltiness is off the charts, in a very good way.

This and the TH Liberator are the only doppelbocks I've had but this definitely beats the Liberator (although that might've been a bad bottle).

This beer is dark, nearly black. Has a nice head and it falls away quickly.

Also some flowery kinda hops smells. It tastes big and malty, with roasted flavors and first and then straight chocolate at the end. It has more of a hop presence than I expected, and this cleans up the sugars nice. As it warms a bit the chocolate may over power it more than I'd like. Anyway, pretty great beer.

The aroma is malt and lots of it with molasses, brown sugar, toffee, slight chocolate and smoke. Also there seems to be a slight musty aroma. The flavors are very good with the malt giving many flavors roast, chocolate, smokiness, toffee with a slight fruit like taste. This brew goes down very easily which is scary based on a 7+ abv level.

Its appearance and smell combine perfectly to deliver the drinker with pure, unadulterated, quality doppelbock. Taste and mouthfeel though are what make this beer great; from the glass it ensconces your tongue and mouth in its velvety consistency.

Invitingly sweet nose of coffee ice cream, caramel, butterscotch and chocolate covered raisins, blends in banana, ginger spice, pecans, all malt with no real hoppiness, very well balance nostril presence and staying power. Medium-bodied, the carbonation definitely smoothes out the sweetness and allows for more structural balance from the hops.

Also hoppier than I figured from my imagination and the smell. Regardless, the bitterness doesn't linger, but there's a little bit of pleasant cloying. Actually, as it warms, it further reduces the bitterness and increases the sweetness a bit. In the end, the bitterness is an afterthought compared to the encompanying malts. Almost roastiness in the mouthfeel. The longer the sip, the fuller the malt experience. Medium-full bodied and creamy, and very drinkable. Pleasantly carbonated. A little let down on the flavor, possibly because my expectations were so high, but the other aspects of my sensory perception do not disagree.

Aroma is strongly malty with some dark fruits notes from the Munich malts. Taste is rich and quite malty, some more dark fruits (figs, prunes, etc.), a bit of chocolate and a moderate hop bitterness. The malt flavor is present throughout whereas the other flavors seem to come and go. Initially the flavor is overwhelming fruity (figs, prunes). Then the hop bitterness appears but soon yields to a wonderful cocoa flavor. The chocolate flavor lingers into the finish where is mingles with a bit of alcohol. The finish is decidedly sweet but this beer is by no means under attenuated. Mouthfeel is good, medium+ body and moderate to low carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, just shy of perfect.

It pours well with a very festive foam and thick creamy head that lasts. The color is a dark black with maybe a hint of amber. It smells toasty with a strong malt essence. After the sip I notice an extremely smooth mouthfeel and a slight sweetness. But then I get a smack bam! With a strong, yet pleasant, bold coffee-ish flavor. The sweetness diminishes and I taste a strong malty goodness. I love this beer and always have. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying out new doppelbocks or is into dark beers in general.

Light has trouble getting through, and when it does, it picks up that brown visual with a touch of red. The head evaporated pretty quickly. The scent is a subtle nutty, woodsy aroma with some mocha. Caramel is the first flavor, which quickly settles into a convocation of coffee, mocha, molasses & almond flavors. Really deep complex flavor, where all the pieces come together one-by-one, creating a new experience.

I also get a taste/scent sensation of split firewood post-swallow, but I'm not exactly sure where it's coming from. The taste is defintely a lager. The mouthfeel is nice and full with mid-to-low carbonation. This is just a very well-made brew.","Spidey13","Jun 06, 2008"

Pouring into the glass revealed a very dark brown, essentially black, brew with a centimeter or two of light tan-colored head. The aroma has a strong dark malt character with toffee and chocolate. Smooth and ample bodied on the palate. Chocolate and coffee flavors commingle with a roasted malt bitter bite and also a slight sweetness. Very drinkable and pleasing.

Short-to-medium finish. Carbonation is long gone a few minutes after pour - first sip is a little clammy; a few minutes later it's very soothing.

I don't know if I could drink more than one at a sitting- I feel it needs food cause the abv seems to sneak up on you due to its insane smoothness going down, perhaps a meal of sausages or game with german black bread. Definitely something to warm you during the cold winter, goes great with a hearty stick-to-your ribs meal (heavy bean stews- had it with Publick House's cassoulet before).","ABCJiugui","Feb 08, 2008"

The pour yeilds a small, creamy off-white head, with great lacing, and a dark brown body. It nearly looks like a porter. The flavor is quite nice with a lightly sweet yeasty taste. Body is medium to full and the mouthfeel is creamy. A lot of character for such low abv.","BMan1113VR","Feb 07, 2008"

Dark brown with red tinges. Looks a lot like cola, actually. Nice fluffy head that slowly became a layer of froth. No real lacing, though. The nose is very sweet. Quite bready with lots of dark fruits layered on top of that. There were also notes of caramel. Taste is pretty complex, with a lot of flavors coming in different waves. First is a great malty taste. Almost like sweet bread. Then comes dark fruits, such as raisins, figs, and prunes. This is followed with an aftertaste of sassafras. VERY well done. Feels very creamy in my mouth. Nice and thick, but with just the right amount of carbonation. Very smooth. All in all, this is a fantastic beer, that I look forward to having again and again.","atrus138","Jan 31, 2008"

Taste is malty, molasses, and some smokey earthiness again. It also has a tart, sourish twinge to the finish and a nice needed bitterish note to it. Alcohol is hidden well, and this an awesome beer overall. Still good, but I didn't like it as much the 2nd time around.","JDV","Jan 31, 2008"

Dark malt, brown sugar, hops, chocolate, dark beers, caramel. I could go on. Taste matches the smell. With tons of dark rich malt flavors. Chocolate, and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is good, right amount of carbonation and not overly thick. Drinkability is good, but you can only have maybe 2 of these at most, because it is like a meal. Or at least dessert.

As i poured this brew it had a light caramel colored head that was beautiful, but did seem to not last that long. Was decent though. The color of this is a dark rich black/brown color. When looked at through the light i can see hints of red as well though. The smell is of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, and a nice roasted barley malt. Nutty wood chocolaty brew that pleases the taste buds. Mouthfeel was a mild to medium carbonation with a slight aftertaste and dry.

Taste is exceptional. Sweet and malty at first, then a touch of dark fruits and ends with a slightly bitter note on the back of the tounge. Very warm feeling and a kiss of alcohol as it goes down.

Has notes of dark fruit and some spice but nothing that I can put a name to, which is fine as it lets the malt speak for itself.

The aroma is sweet like wheatgrass and almost brown-sugar or molasses laced. Flavor is heavy on the carmel bordering on candied dates, slight nuttiness with a maple character which becomes more robust after breathing for a few minutes just creeping into a currant note. It has a smooth, almost creamy feel to the palate but somewhat heavy. A lightly bitter bouquet balances the sweetness very well, making it very drinkable. A great choice for doppelbok fans and anyone who likes to dabble in stouts and porters primarily. A nice experience that highlights the Bavarian character of this style of bier.","BlaiseDemon","Dec 21, 2007"

It goes down very easily for 6.7. A heavier session? Fine by me. This beer may not live up to all the hype but it may just be because I'm a little tired of the style.

The first one that I ever drank totally changed the way that I look at beer. I made the mistake of drinking it freezing cold and it was still delicious. I now let this beer warm to almost room temperature before even picking it up and it gets better everytime I experience it.

I ordered this beer after dinner and it smelled like I had made a great decision... The elevated abv seemed not to overpower, but rather to deliver the flavors to the tongue while wafting into the nasal cavity from the back of the throat!

S: Roasted malts, chocolate, spice, some whiffs of earthy hops. Pretty mouthwatering. T: Chocolate and toffee up front, some darker fruit, the hops providing a beautifully clean finish. From the smell I was a bit concerned the sweetness would be overpowering, but there's a near perfect balance. M: Thick, chewy, long. D: I could drink this all night.

As a hophead, this isn't my favorite style of beer but I was impressed with the ""bigness"" of flavor in a beer that is not a complete high octane / abv bomb.

As with most of my reviews D-bocks are new to me so can't really compare by style. It was good, but after hearing all the hype maybe I expected more. Nose was malty, bready, not much actually.

Great taste with the chocolate making its presence felt in this dark version of the style, alcohol present once again but faint and actually helps create some balance. Sweet malts also come through.

This is one amazing looking beer. Very dark ruby appearance with a wonderful dark khaki colored head that remains throughout entire tasting with a medium grainy lace. Smell is of a nutty chocolate with a toasted malt undertone. Very pleasant smell. Taste follows up quite well after the amazing odor. Lots of malt! Very sweet bready flavors, brown sugar, raisin as well. Little to no alcohol bite which I enjoy. Such a smooth enjoyable brew that has a fair amount of carbonation to it, but doesn't distract from its overall balance.

Finishes more on the drier side once one has sat without taking another sip for a few moments.

The taste is slightly acidic/bitter up front, but then erupts into a roasty sweet chocolate taste on the end which dominates the aftertaste. Very drinkable and delicious - nice bitterness to balance out the sweet roast. Plus it's got a funky little goat necklace for some reason.

Overall, this is a fine representation of the style and a beer that is certainly recommended.","cjgator3","Dec 27, 2006"
4.25,-2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This brew poured a dark amber with a huge tan head and sticky lacing. Aromas of dark malts and dried fruits were present and came through on tasting.

4.1,-5.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Taste is very nicely balanced. The chocolate toasted malts come on first, but they aren't overbearingly sweet, and are offset nicely by a mild lemonlike sourness. Less fruity than the nose suggests, but that said, there is some plumlike sweetness in the back. Earthy hops are present and subtle. Just enough to help balance this out. Finishes dry with lots of chocolate in the aftertaste. Thick and malty and perhaps a little syrupy, but I don't mind that. Carbonation is mild and befits the style. Drinkability is high for a few reasons: Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness/sourness. Sweet but never too sweet. Alcohol content isn't out-of-control, slides down very easily. Well done, and probably the best Doppelbock I've had yet.","trevorwideman","Dec 26, 2006"

The nose is very malty sweet, with a bit of dark fruity vinousness, caramel, toasted malts, and earthy hops (just a tad). The taste is lightly smoky, with deep caramel and toffee notes.

Anyhow it poured out a dark brown almost black color. Nice tan off-white head. Very impressive looking presentation. The nice thick head dissipated slowly and left very little lacing in the pint. Smells of roasted malt and caramel tones. Had a rather interesting alcohol aroma almost like a scotch ale. Very smooth roasted flavor awesome malt character. Mild hop presence in the finish. Extremely enjoyable smooth malted flavor. Great mix of dark and roasted malt. The solid malt flavor is the back bone of this great thick bodied beer. Very impressive and tasty, drinkable but in moderation. It certainly packed a nice little kick with it so it seemed. Great overall flavor and taste. I would certainly give it another taste.

Taste was sweet, almost port-like, but not as strong in the grape/raisin flavor. Dark cherry bitterness in the aftertaste and a coffee flavor kept the overall sweetness in balance. Hops still AWOL. Body was medium plus, carbonation was medium and led to a pleasantly creamy brew. Alcohol warming kicks in about 1/4 of the way through the beer.

This looks great in an oversized pilsner glass. Aroma is mild and delicious: definitely german but not stale and musty smelling as sometimes is the case--more malt aromas than hops but also not that ultra sweet, syrupy aroma. More of a husky, sweet chocolate malt aroma in the forefront with...a bit of peat smoked malt? Taste is delicious. Light but also dark, and so a bit hifi again like some schwarzbiers, though less so than others I've tasted of late, with some midrange sweet malt to balance. Definitely a touch of peat smoke with some drying cocoa flavors from dark malts. Unique flavor among dopplebocks, more complex. Definitely a lager, but that comes with the benefit of the enhanced smoothness factor. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full, and the weight on the tounge is retained even after some de-carbonation, which leaves many a beer watery and bland behind the veil of carbonation. Overall, this is among the great beers, best of style from Germany.

Medium-bodied and smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. This is an easily drinkable dopplebock, with a good mixture of sweet and bitter.

4.47,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Finally! After what seems like ages, the renowned doppelbock becomes available in Alberta. Thanks to Delancey Direct for importing it into the local market. Comes in a 4-pack holder, telling about the numerous awards and a little piece on the side about the Aying brewery. 330ml bottles. The beers all have a white plastic goat-charm on red string around the neck...cool. I have never seen that before. Simple labelling showing two goats and a big glass of beer. Blue and white neck wrapping too. Popping the unlabeled white cap gives smoky bbq aromas rigth away. The glass reveals a cola-dark beer, deep chestnut brown and ruby-reds when held to light. Black, to look at it from a distance. A thin but consistent coffee-coloured head. Impermeable sheets of slow-moving lace. Looks mighty drinkable sitting there in the glass. But first...a sniff, revealing charcoal and seasoning salt firstly. Oh, but give the glass a slight swirl to release some beautiful notes of raisins, roasted peanuts, toast, grape-juice, and some very woody notes, like balsam or fir. A hint of the woodiness I am used to in some Belgian dubbels, but with more salinity. All the usual dark-fruit suspects: dates, prunes, and plums. The mocha/coffee notes arirve with the warming of the beer, adding a dusty bitterness. I get loads of salt in this beer from the roasted malts, giving beef roast and beef jerky smells. Some lactose in the malting too, very minimal. Little bits of German hopping appear now and again, but this is all about the meat-like grains for sure. For me it is similar to Salvator but more balanced: not quite as dusty or sour as Paulaner's doppelbock. Subtle, but extremely appetising. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and light on the tongue, like ice-cream. As soon as you sip you sense the almost airy quality of the body, smooth as oil on the tongue. Salty and sourish malting at first in the mouth, with full vinous grains on the finish. A lot of milkiness up front actually, with the soft sourness of table-cream. Hickory and tree-bark on the middle, some bbq and roast beef as well. A little less smoky or even malty as I expected, the whole taste just screams balance and tastiness. An aftertaste of mollasses and maple syrup, with next to no bitterness...this beer ends extremely sweet. Candy sweet with hints of licorice and brown sugar. The malting rarely lets you see the hops, but occasionally a little burst of continental hopping appears. Like the aroma, this beer just works through subtlety and good elements balanced masterfully. Full bodied and very low in carbonation. The drinkability is profound at only 6.7%. The alcohol is never noticeable. This is a doppelbock I could drink all night long. A noteworthy example of the style. Not trying to go over-the-top, just succeeding in a fine-tasting bock beer. I think that is where its beauty lies: simply flavourful.","Cwrw","May 20, 2006"

Drinkability is fantastic: as this is a thick, rich beer one usually only takes slow sips of it. The 6.7% alcohol levels nearly guarantees that there's no effect from one of these.

Big mouth sweet and malty with a nice roasted balance. I love this in the bottle but on tap man im obsessed with it. If it wasnt almost 7% abv i would drink it alnight avery night all winter long.

4.68,7.8,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Pours a clear, dark brown with a medium-sized, light tan, frothy, slowly diminishing head. Excellent lacing. The smell is quite sweet with big dark malts. Toffee & molasses are the dominant aromas, and are accompanied by a grainy cookie-like scent, some light yeast and some light herbal hops. The taste is oh wow this is good. Follows in line with the smell with the dark malts stealing the show. Caramel and molasses take center stage but are surrounded by a supporting cast of many different flavors, including plum, raisin, licorice, cola, alcohol and bready yeast. The finish is dry and has a very light metallic tinge late, not enough to really detract from the overall quality of the beer. The mouthfeel is wonderful for a doppelbock. Full body, and it feels thick and syrupy in the mouth but goes down very smoothly. Now granted, I am a sucker for a good doppelbock, but this is one of the best ones Ive ever had. Definitely the best bottled one for sure. Very nicely done!","ski271","Feb 10, 2006"

Taste was absolutely superb, with with the nice toasty maltiness predominating, and the dark fruis adding a subtle sweetness and strong background fruitiness. Very complex mixture of taste.

This poured a gorgous deep brown color with a nice creamy looking yet fizzy tean head. The aroma is smoky and sweet, quite malty w/cocoa hint. The mouthfeel is excellent, creamy and smooth. The flavor is malty as hell with some caramel flavor also. A fruityness sneaks in every now and then.

4.2,-3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured an almost black hue with deep, ruby red accents in the light. Voluminous light tan head with considerable persistence and healthy lacing in the Celebrator glassware. Warm, inviting and sweet aromas spring forth with a decided mollases character predominant. Little hop assertion, and dominated by the sweet malt richness of brown sugar and mollases. A dryer finish than expected for this medium to heavy body, with little carbonation or alcohol detectable. Despite this, it's very friendly and warm beer ... evoking the desire to share it with friends (hence the name, I suppose.) Doppelbock is not my favorite style, but this is certianly a supreme exemplar of the style. Drinks easily and invites you to enjoy more ... A LOT of character and substance which almost tricks you into thinking this is a much higher ABV ale. Excellent representation of this Bavarian standard.","beerphilosopher","Feb 05, 2006"

Taste is very big and roasty, somewhat like a light porter in a way but with a clean bright texture which sets it waaay apart from an average beer. Complex flavors unfold as the beer warms and come to include suggestions of mocha, chewy toffee, and a healthy dose of alcohol which isn't completely hidden and warms you quickly as this one goes down.

I'm usually skeptical of dopples as I've only had a few I really like - the cloying sweetness in some of them gets to me. Anyway... 330 mL slender bottle - it pours a brown/deep plum color with a fair amount of carbonation streams and a 1 finger, light brown head that is dense and sooo creamy, leaving sheets of bubbles all the way down the glass, eventually turning into lace. Beautiful to say the least. Smells of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, green hops, a grainy character, and a sweetness that comes close to candy, but nowhere near cloying. Tastes toasty with caramel, molasses, raisins, chocolate?, burnt malts?, vinous malts?, green/spicy hops, and a medium bitterness. I can't think of how a dopple could taste better than this. The body starts medium and smooth, becoming thicker and softer as I go. This beer is amazing (it just dethroned Ruination as my top-rated).

The pour leaves a brownish beer which lightens as your near the bottle, the head is a foamy white. Taste is malty but not overdown or buttery. The flavor really exploded on this one as the temp increased with no hints of the alcohol just the incredible malts. I bought this in a four pack which was four months out of suggested serving time and still loved this. I also had this on tap at redbones a few weeks back and it was wonderful as well, I didn't review it at that time as I was eating the kick ass buffalo shrimp and wasn't in the note taking mood.","WeymouthMike","Dec 13, 2005"

Boozier than I expected for only 6.7%. Bit of alcohol warming in the throat and stomach. Mouthfeel is huge, creamy, and chewy. For such a big and bold beer, this is quite drinkable.

Pours a two-finger light brown head over a dark brown crystal clear liquid. Smells wafting up during the pour were sugar, caramel, toffee, and alcohol. To the nose I get a dry chalky malt, caramel, alcohol, and a hint of chocolate. Ho baby this tastes incredible. Overall, it's wet sweet with distinct caramel and so malty it tastes like barley grains. It starts with a slowly rising sweetness that ushers a sudden caramel zomp (yea, I said 'zomp'). Right after the caramel hits, there's a nice dry chocolate with hints of nutty. An alcohol sting plays quietly behind these candy flavors and is tamed by a sugary sweet. Oh, what a divine combination...each flavor works well with the others and is at an appropriate level to satisfy. After the swallow, the alcohol gets a bit strong (no surprise, that's usual) and the chocolate dries out a bit. I was hoping the aftertaste would hold a final transition to new flavors, but I didn't get that experience. The bock character is present, but not as strong as I would have liked. I won't detract from my scoring of the beer, as I know I like strong bock character (which wouldn't be to style). Medium-thick (almost thick) mouthfeel with mild carbonation.

In the taste that milky creamy characteristic was really the only thing that made it stand out. Yeah, the nice roasted toasted chocolaty coffee taste was nice, but nothing I haven't come across before, in a variety of styles. It seemed like this beer didn't really know if it was a brown ale or a dopplebock or a stout. The mouthfeel didn't match up with the taste, it was a little thin and too carbonated in my opinion.

The flavor is very good for a doppelbock as it begins with a touch of hops blended in with a very rich toasted malt flavor that has a touch of chocolate malt or some other dark malt in the finish. the body is very full and lends a smoothness that is also accented by the lower levels of carbonation.

There is some unidentified complexity (yeast?) that gives it a bit of added tartness (maybe weak hop notes, but not certain). Flavor is toffee & coffee that is incredibly well balanced- bready sweet with light shaprness at the end of the swallow. A great dessert, even though it's not all sweetness. Mouthfeel lush and rich.

A little bit vinous and lightly astringent, helping to balance the deep, dark malt assault. I haven't had a Celebrator in about 10 months, and, maybe it's the right time of year now that it's getting chilly, but it is just hitting the spot.

This bottled version is pasteurized I suspect but it still does not detract from this beers reputation. The pour revealed a deep mahogany- red liquid with a 2 finger rocky mocha cap that reduces in its own sweet time to a lasting sticky lacemild to medium carbonation. Wow what a bouquet of malts!! We have dried fruits, licorice, molasses, tangerines and a lovely musty, earthy over tone. The start is all big tasty malts with a dozen different malt/roast/hop/yeast departures that are so complex they escape my eloquence to enunciate thema veritable orgasm of the taste buds. Rich mouth feel without being heavy or sweet...fantastic balance for a dopple bock.finish is medium with the toffee chocolate tastes receding and the hops creating a wet lasting impression of treacle and limethen a nice warming.infinitely the best drinkable dopple bock in the world.Ed thanksand more please!!!","pootz","Aug 28, 2004"

Very full and complex aroma is rising from the glass with roasted malts, dark chocolate mixing around with a strong ripe dark fruit scent. The taste starts of with a roasted smoky flavor that is back by fruits, caramel and chocolate. Behind that is a touch of coffee and a slightly bittering finish that completes this wonderful flavor. Excellent mouth feel as this is full, creamy and smooth not too much more can be asked from a brew like this. Very good drinkability as its complex flavor and scent keep you coming back for more to discover new elements in it.

Taste is absolutely wonderful... dark, lots of malt, nothing too overpowering, but there's some caramel/toffee, a little cocoa, and a definite hop presence, just a little spiciness to lighten it up, and a little sharp astringent malt towards the finish. Great mouthfeel, smooth and creamy. This glass is empty far too quickly, but I've docked drinkability because I think one or two is the limit - even without the slightly higher ABV, it's just not something that even a lover of dark, malty beers like I am would want to drink all night.","malthead","Aug 06, 2004"

The nose is all caramel and malt but without any candy sweetness. Full, velvety mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to make it rich instead of heavy. The flavor is all malt: caramel notes and just a hint of roastiness and a smooth, rounded sweetness. Does not cut you in the back of the throat like some doppelbocks -- very smooth as it goes down.

Lacing around the glass is relatively moderate. Aroma was that of plums, raisins, and hazelnuts. Taste was vinous and fruity with notes of sweet molasses, caramel, dark fruits, roasted nuts, and spices. There were also some burnt smoky flavors evident. Creamy mouthfeel is smooth like satin.

Sweet and rich, it speaks of raisins and prunes. Fermented sugars and alcohols combine with malted notes to give this an incredibly appealing and complex nose. The taste is on quite the same level. Sweet and very smooth, not nearly as viscous as you might expect. Again, prunes, raisins, nuts, molasses, and light choco taste. There is a flavor very much like candied yams: a sort of carmelized, burnt, fermented sugar taste that makes this oh so delicious to sip. A really unique aftertaste, of earth, sugar, smoke, and nuts. Cashews or something, it's sort of tough to describe. This is really good stuff. The mouth is balanced to perfection. Light enough to be easily drank, but heavy enough to hold the intense flavors. Drinkability is also top notch, as this is good enough to warrant having another. Quite a special beer, and the pinnacle of dopplebocks IMO. Plus it comes with a fun plastic goat trinket.

3.88,-10.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,3,"pours with a simply massive foamy tan head. the head lasts and lasts (and lasts) too. a nice little bonus. body is a nice brown colour with hints of amber. smells of berries (cherry and grape, perhaps) and malt throughout. almost a bit of a sour (not bad)smell here with hints of licorice and perhaps carrots (?). whatever it is, it smells good, but a tad off. taste is a creamier version of the smell. full bodied and smooth with a touch of caramel added with malt all over the place. the problem is, while the flavour is nice, i can't escape that cooked carrot/slightly 'off' characteristic that was in the smell. it's here in the taste as well and hinders what could be an awesome brew. still very good and drinkable, but i prefer something more along the lines of the SA double bock, which, whilst not as complex or bold as the celebrator, i think it's a better balanced brew. you've got to try the celebrator at least once and it is definitely worth your while (and cash) but while this is an excellent example of the style, i've had doppelbocks i enjoy more than this one.","SixpointJMH","Feb 02, 2004"

No head stuck around to evaluate but the wonderful chocolate color was a beautiful sight in itself and as it turned out it matched the beer as well. Aroma was light and all malt with notes of chocolate. The taste was initially a smooth nutty buscuit that finishes with strong chocolate overtones. It's the same kind of chocolaty taste you get from Anchor Porter except this one was more like having a piece of dark chocolate cake in a glass. Mouthfeel was thick and rich and in fact it was so rich and thick I would not want to have more than one of these at a time but I enjoyed this one so much I gave it good drinkability marks. I would definitely have this again if I can find it again. It is hard to find as I've been looking for this for a long time and I finally came across it about 400 miles from home.

Upon pouring, an ample tan head formed on the blackish liquid, and soon settled into a thin blanket of foam, leaving fine lacing in its wake. When the beer was held up to a small lamp, the color is a deep and seductive ruby, like a dark red wine. This one was a sniffer, with an upfront nose of dark roasted malts, with perky and clean accents of ripe plantains and turkish coffee. Fantastic and well-defined character! The beer tasted delicioius as well. It started with a suprisingly bittersweet roasty malt wallop, and was soon joined by flavors of raisins, dark bitter chocolate, and coffee, with faint suggestions of cherry. The finish was fairly dry, with chocolate and cherry flavors lingering. I was highly impressed by the everything but the mouthfeel, which I felt could was just a little too thin. This problem is insigificant however, compared with its exceptional beauty, and the characteristics of smell/taste. After experiencing this dopplebock, I am not inclined to argue with the claim on the bottle.","HiroProtagonist","Jan 24, 2004"

The flavors of chocolate and coffee are evident. Despite its thick body, it goes down smooth. I had a few of these during Christmas dinner and afterward.

Aroma is not as intense as I thought, but definitely complex and appealing with its chocolate and numerous fruits notes. Now that's malty. This beer is as complex as any other beer. Period. Rich roasty black chocolate, some caramel, lots of plum esters, blue grapes, cherries, pecans, coffee, yum yum, butter notes as well as robust earthiness every couple of sips (sometimes, the malt reminded me of Rogue Hazelnut Brown nectar). The palate is as good as it gets, thick, full, round, velvety. Long aftertaste once it warmed a bit that varies from a sip to the other, once it will be the dark chocolate, the other time it will be the roastiness and next time you'll remember those juicy plums, subtly bitter at times. In my eyes, it's fully worthy of these high ratings. That's precisely the type of beers I adore, a big malty phenomenon with a body to back it up. Only critic I'd adress it is the palate fatigue (or I just want the moment to last forever) I get after just one bottle, maybe the sweetness is too much although I never found it stickingly cloying, I wouldn't have two in a row, hell I'd never deserve two i a row!

Two fingers of foam quickly dies down to a thin, dense, and tiny-beaded head of a dirty tan color that does not cling. Garnet translucence around edges of glass when held to light. Hard to smell from a distance, but when nose goes up to glass--wow... an actual tactile, mallowy sensation in the nose, like plowing nose into a thick, rising pillow of molasses, gingerbread, baking spices. Dense, complex, inviting. Flavor is equally complex: starts with rush of sweet malt; seamlessly melds into a midpalate of nutmeg, allspice, clove (?), touch of molasses... liquid gingersnaps! Develops still further into figs, golden raisins, more molasses; allusions to the darkest of Jamaican rums in a warm, soft, dry alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is outstanding, with the same mallow quality as detected in the aroma; soft, velvet smooth. You barely have to swallow. Drinkability is high, but this beer is so nuanced that having more than one would almost be overkill...

Very complex flavor with many subtle, indistinguishable flavors that produce more a general feel than they do individual qualities. The hops are present but underlining, and I think are a unique blend that provides the fruity flavor. The mouthfeel is simply perfect. Carbonated to give a nice, happy kick, but not vigorous.

It pours a medium brown with little bubbles always floating to heaven. The head was a little less then I desired. It pours close to an inch of head that goes away fast. Smells of malt and maybe a hint of coffee or smoke, I could even say maybe a little fruity. Surprisingly drinkable it does not taste like a strong dark beer. The alcohol content is not noticeable. That could just be because I usually drink Belgiums. It actually reminds me of a dark Belgium. I enjoy decorating my office at work with the little goats that come with each bottom.

The taste is equally complex there were hints of nuttiness mixed with raisins and caramel, I swear that I could taste some licorice, too.

Celebrator is a very dark and opaque beer (the lights in the bar were dim so I didn't get as good a look at it as I would have liked) with a thick tawny head. Rich caramel notes in the nose.

4.6,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"It pours a very deep mahogany with a foamy tan head that holds well. The nose displays a mild smokiness and some toasty breadiness that combines with a touch of alcohol to twist it into a more toffee-ish character. A velvety mouthfeel is derived from a medium body and a very fine carbonation. The flavor offers a luxurious maltiness that's fairly complex with notes of molasses, deeply toasted honey-glazed bread, dried dark fruit, mild leafy hop, and a very subtle smokiness. The rich, and somewhat sweet malt character is exquisitely balanced by a firm bitterness that remains in the wings as it crosses the palate, but then combines with the alcohol to dry out the finish. Some lingering malty notes of caramel and subtle bitter & smoky notes add to it's richness. Overall, a smooth, rich, deceptively strong and warming lager with a drying finish. The alcohol is well-cloaked and the smokiness is quite subtle, just adding a touch of character at the offest and then vanishing amongst the maltiness. Quite enjoyable!","NeroFiddled","Jan 24, 2003"

Coyly dark, almost blackish color - but held up to a strong light, a most alluring reddish hue becomes evident. Nose is also toying with me! I want so badly to taste... Hints of its alcohol level and sweet maltiness predominate the aroma, with almost a fruity, ""raisiny"" character. An absolute knock-out taste. What I particularly found was how intriguing its character remained with each and every sip! People here who wrote of its ""complexity"" are dead-on. Discerning the range of subtle flavors with its perfect balance was not an ephemeral experience, especially considering that alcohol at this level can overpower.

Head went adios in seconds and absolutely no lace to be found as the glass was drained. Smell was strong and sweet with toffee overtones. Taste was very sweet yet smooth, malt dominating. Thick mouthfeel is as I assume is right for this style, drinkability is O.K., but I can't see taking this style up regularly.

4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"When poured it was a very dark brown with very little foam. The first impression I got when smelling this beer was of malts, prunes and caramel. The taste was the same and the aroma with the addition of it being sort of a sweet thick and creamy. The only set back was after a short time the flavor on the palate when north and the well balanced bitterness lingered. Still one of my favorite Doppelbocks.","BeerManDan","Dec 13, 2002"

Aroma of rich sweet malt, with hints of raisin and toffee, with some faint chocolate notes thrown in for good measure.  Rich sweet malty taste, full of toffee and hints of chocolate and raisin.

Toffee, coffee, molasses.  The mouthfeel of mercury (I'm guessing because I've never drank mercury!).  I'm picking up a little bit of hops.  This is good but I couldn't have more than one or two.

The taste is also nicely complex, with malt, bittersweet chocolate and a thick, fruity sweetness predominating. There is a nice bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and it coats the tongue nicely. I only purchased one, but I could easily drink a couple.

The head was thick and rich, with a deep chocolate brown color.  The aroma is strong, of cocoa, and raisons.  The taste is rich and very nice, and to my taste, seems like a mix of raisons and sweet chocolates.  There was a spicy hop bite, which balances the strong malt tastes.  There is a nice chocolate richness in the aftertaste, which makes this a great after dinner beer. Some alcohol warmth.  I enjoyed this beer very much, but I am a little taken aback that this fine beer rests at number one.  Quite frankly, it wasn’t the best beer I had this weekend.","jackndan","Oct 13, 2002"

Kind of bready. Fig is also present with the other fruits. A taste brings even more pleasure. Hops are noticeable, but stand back and let the malt rush in, which is, again, very sweet and spicy. Massive caramel, slightly toasted, and subtle hopping. Spicy dried fruit in the middle, reminds me a bit of a dubbel. Nice full body. Smooth yet prickly mouthfeel. A bit more than mildly acidic. A slightly metallic flavor in the background, but that fades as it warms. A grain-malty, but surprisingly dry finish. This doppelbock is spicier than its competitors, which I believe is one of the things that makes it better than a lot of them. An excellent brew, one of the kings of its style.","hyuga","Oct 02, 2002"

The flavors are very sound, if a somewhat compressed version of what the nose offers. Sweet horse manure appears on the the re-whiff. Chamise texture. Pillowy and light.

In fact if you just saw it sitting in the glass you'd probably mistake it for a porter as light only gets through around the edges (when it does, it gives a nice red wine color). The head is a thick, lumpy foam that's a medium tan color. Unfortunately, mine seemed a bit skunky, but I could pick up some good malt aromas with the slightest hint of hops. The aroma was big, but not as big as the appearance would suggest. Caramel, bitterness from the dark-colored malts and some fruitiness I can't place my finger on. This was all followed up by a bit of grassy hops. I also picked up a little black pepper, but it was faint enough, I'm not sure if I was just tasting things.","aracauna","Jun 11, 2002"

4.52,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Deep ruby hue and very clear.  The tan head is thick and well retained.  The rich malt aroma is comprised of sweet buttery toffee, nutty peanut brittle, vanilla notes and mild toasty dark Munich malt.  The malt profile is luscious-- heavily caramelized sugars are combined w/ roasted grain notes that are above the norm for style.  It's lighter in body than Spatens or Paulaners, but the depth of malt character surpasses either of those.  There's more roasted grain and chocolate flavors in this brew and less residual sweetness.  The hop bitterness, although subdued, complements the light roasted grain bitterness to balance the malt sweetness.  It finishes surprisingly dry and roasty for a doppelbock. Celebrator is delicious, flavorful, yet highly drinkable.","marc77","May 27, 2002"

Nice toffee, carmel like sweetness, very balanced with bitterness of roasted malt. Nice smooth feel, almost creamy, and full, everything I hoped it would be. I thought it fuller and more balanced, not as syrupy than the Salvator dopplebock. The last shot of bittnerness at the end, wanted you to have another taste to balance. Beer Perfection.

No hops detected, but there must be some to balance the malt load of this.

Aroma of toffee, caramel, and burnt dark fruits (raisins, dates, prunes). First sip put me off a bit -- there was a slight metallic tang that I didn't expect, but it quickly went away as I adjusted to the beer. Complex combination of malty sweet, toffee flavors, slight hop bitterness, and burnt fruit. Medium carbonation that leaves a tingling sensation on the tongue. Spicy, dry finish.

Despite its syrupy consistency, the mouthfeel is trademark Ayinger: soft, cushiony, and begging to be sipped.
