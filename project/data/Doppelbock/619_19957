Oddly, there isn't even a sign of the 10% ABV even in the absence of flavor. I guess it's a lager and the ""clean"" flavor is perhaps desirable...however I personally don't find it so.

It's so watery in fact that I don't believe the claim that it is 10.8%. Maybe the first batch that they brought down to the lab tested 10.8% but it doesn't taste that alcoholic and it doesn't have the effect on me thinking nor me balance that I expect from 10.8%.","Muchosnachos","Jul 03, 2009"
3.11,2,2,3.5,2.5,2.5,4.5,"Poured into a Celebrator glass. Dark ruby brown color with a thin tan head. It dissipates quickly and the resultant halo is constantly replenished with streaming bubble columns. Looks very fizzy and thin. Aroma is deep dark breads with artificial banana notes. Nutty and a bit roasty. Flavor is toasted bread with a touch of char as if the bread was left in the toaster a little too long. Weakly brewed coffee, with a blatantly watery finish. On one hand this beer is very watery for the strength, but on the other hand I don't taste any booze at all. Not sure how they managed that. Overall way too thin and simple.","illidurit","Jun 28, 2009"

In the end though the body and flavor is lacking the richness and complexity that is need to really carry this beer.","Gueuzedude","Jun 27, 2009"

Poured them into a pint glass each time and the head never stuck around, regardless of how hard i poured it. Smelled ok, like a bock. Tasted thin, really thin for such a big (alcoholwise, stylewise) beer. The mouthfeel was thin and it just didnt have the malt backbone the style demands. Probably won't get this guy again. Although, it did hide the alcohol shockingly well.","drunkboxer1","Apr 18, 2009"

3.57,17,4,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The flavor is a milder version of the aroma. There's really not much sustenance to it, save a mild note of caramel toffee and a crisp mineral finish. Where did the dark fruits go? Where is this 10+% alcohol? Disappointing to say the least. Still, the mouthfeel is that of a crisp, medium-bodied German lager and finishes dry and clean with a hint of residual sweetness. THANK GOD, because Indian Well's IPA finished with notes of bitter aspirin and stank veggies!

Medium (bordering thin sometimes) body with a smooth texture. Sweet roasted malt flavor with very light coffee and hops behind it.

The appearance was typical for a bock, Dark tan, a little transparent. It didn't really have much of an aroma and the head quickly dissipated. It definitely does not drink like a +10% beer. The alcohol is barely discernible. I'll be able to finish the other 3 I have left, unlike Lobotomy's Gold Mojave cousin.","tiger88","Jan 28, 2008"
