"It's one of the best looking German doppels I've ever seen but it's just far to sweet for my tastes.  Still drinkable, but if you are into that thing you'll dig this one for sure."
"O: A nice sipper, with standout fruit flavors--even for a doppelbock, this is complex and rich. I will seek it out again."
"I would seek this one out again!!!"

"Overall- A thoroughly enjoyable beer, this is hard to find in GA so if you can find it, give it a try."

"Creamy mouthfeel, over all, a very nice Doppelbock."

"Overall: Got to love German doppelbocks. Especially monks brewing this beer sine 1330. Cheers to the monks who brew this beer and cheers to all the other people who have had the chance to enjoy this treat of a beer."

"O: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Poured two inches of cream colored head and a dark ruby body. Decent head retention: head gradually fades to a thin ribbon and leaves sparse sudsy lacing. Smell is of roasty malt and heavy on the dark fruit - some figs, some raisins. Alcohol present. Taste follows the nose. Little bit of booze comes through. Medium-bodied with light carbonation and slightly bitter-sweet. Would maybe have this beer one more time, but no more than that. Not to crazy about tasting those dark fruits in my hocks."

"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly cloudy dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, nuttiness, biscuit, herbal, toast, and light earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of raisin, biscuit, caramel, molasses, nuttiness, toffee, toast, light chocolate, and earthy spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, caramel, toast, nuttiness, toffee, light chocolate, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity; almost zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice doppelbock! Nicely balanced with good complexity; very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyable offering."

"The feel is likewise light; this could use just a touch more thickness and body. Otherwise it's pretty smooth."
"Overall: Comparing my review to others, it appears I got a stale version. There simply was no carbonation whatsoever. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this beer locally, but wouldn't turn one down if offered. Overall a middle-of-the-road Doppelbock. I've had worse, but as most others would probably attest, I'd prefer a Salvator over this one. If I can find this beer in-country, I'll post a comparison review."
"O-A decent doppelbock a little too much sweetness up front for me but overall not bad for the price, I got it from a friend for free. Not something I would search out in the future."
"Notes: Nice doppelbock. Would make a very nice dessert (as it reminds me a bit of a fruitcake). Nice sweet, dark fruit flavors are quite strong."
""
"I prefer this over the previous example that I had. There's more alcohol and it has a ""fuller"" feeling."
""
"Drinkability: It’s doppelbock — albeit very fruity. Frankly, it is a kick in the teeth the Trix Rabbit would be envious of."
"Way too sweet, though it does avoid the other main pitfall of doppelbocks, the dreaded soy sauce taste. Not something I would get again, Spaten and Paulaner make a better doppel."
"Good beer I'm happy to finally see in my area. Yet another stop in Bavaria I need to make. I'm curious what their local version is all about."
"o-a nice beer to sit back and sip on. Cannot believe they have been brewing since 1330, unreal."
"A relaxing beer that pairs well with Groundhog Day. This one is comfortable like flannel warm out of the dryer."
"Overall this was interesting, but also out of my comfort zone from normal drinking. Not a true doppelbock."
""
""
""
"Overall it was worth the $4 or whatever it cost, I know it wasnt too pricey. Not the best doppelbock Ive had but it holds its own for sure."
"Great monastery brew! Especially since I have been there and tasted the real stuff fresh from the wooden keg."
""
"Thin head on a murky maroon and brown body. Rich molasses and dark fruit, mostly with a fresh melted carmel note. Flavor is more like a Wild ale with a musty dark fruit note with caramel and syrupy background. Medium body and light to moderate carbonation. Overall reminds me of a wild ale too much but still a good beer."
"D - Comes across more like a Flemish red than a bock, but it is balanced and enjoyable."
"I like doppelbocks. I like Celebrator and Maximator a lot. Sam Adams is pretty good. I like Korbinian well enough. Spaten, one or two others. The style seems like a nice one. But this one tasted like balsamic vinegar mixed with something sweet. So did the Samichlaus doppelbock I tried after that to a somewhat lesser extent. Both were sour and vinegary. Do not like. Couldn't get through a 4 oz taster. I wonder what makes these two come out like this."

"O - The 9% ABV is hidden by some ancient spell, I suppose. The flavors are complex while approachable. It's everything the stereotypical dark German beer should be, and then some!"
"overall, this could be the best doppelbock I can ever recall tasting. Intense malt bill without being too sweet, especially with the 9%abv. Artfully crafted, beautifully made. Utterly delicious!"
"Poured a dark brown and w/ low lighting at bar almost black w/ a large tan head that disipates quickly and left spots of lace. A good blend of smells in the aroma as I pick up roasted malts as well as raisins and figs (the raisins I think is power of suggestion from the bartender) and some dark fruit like black cherry. Taste is more complex as a medium-bodied brew passes over my tongue remaining smooth, almost chewey, while finishing w/ a dry snap thanks to the alcohol flex. The high ABv gives the beer a warming sensation as you drink but doesn't overpower your tongue as you will def taste some sweet sugariness, some spiciness and minor citric/floral hopping and a good chunk of roasted malts in there. I found it very balanced and it is a hearty sipper to relax with."
"Poured a dark reddish brown, with a translucent body. Transient tan head fades to some whisps and a thin collar. Nose of black licorice, molasses - big, rich malts and some generous sweetness. I can already feel the warmth. Taste is rich and comes across as almost syrupy initially, more molasses and licorice as the nose suggests. Sweet and sticky throughout, lingering sweetness and some dark fruits come through on the back-end. Sweetness is large and just borders on being inhibitive, but I was in the mood for this as I rated this. Quite drinkable for the alcohol content (beers just went down too easy that night), which isn't readily evident. Good, bone-warming stuff."
"An OK doppelbock, not super complex, too alcohol heavy (I think), and $4 per bottle. Something to try, but I'm not sure I'd get another given how many other tasty varieties are commonly available."
"Drinkability – This is one of the best DBs that I’ve had here in the US. A lot of people don’t understand how this style should be, it’s relatively thin and lacks complexity, but if you want a lesson buy this beer. This sample has some big spicing that, while thoroughly enjoyed, I don’t remember the character in Bavaria. Other than that, this is a classic example of the style."
"Overall experience- Its not a bad beer i would probably have this closer to the winter time to warm up with, but i feel it is lacking something. i would purchase again but would not go out of my way for it. Its hard to compete with an Ayinger Doppelbock."
"Overall: from stem to stern, I'm impressed by this beer. I think the whole is better than the sum of its parts; this beer is very well put together and I wouldn't hesitate to have it again."
"Drinkability/overall- really really great balance and delicious flavors, alcohol is so hidden, this is a beer i loved when i brought it in to my store the first time cuz i liked it years ago and it still is just as good to me now, still feel very confident i will continue recommending this beer to customers and visit my self again, possibly my favorite german brew"
"O - I stopped at this Kloster about 4 years ago, but was unable to sample the beer there because it was a Sunday. Glad to have thechance some years later, even if now getting a bottle rather than a fresh draft. Well, this bottled beer is good but slightly disappointing; I still want to make a return visit to sample the beers on tap at the source. You should too: the monastery is wonderful. Meanwhile, this brew does taste like it is actually from a recipe from Benedictine monks in 1609."
"O- I can probably count the dopplebocks that I've had on two hands (maybe three), but that needs to change, as I seem to enjoy each one more than the next. This is a damn tasty beer that I will be picking up again."
"Poured a 1/4"" off-white head which soon completely dissipated. Clear burnt umber brown in color but when held to the light it had maroon highlights. Both smell and taste are mega-malty. The higher alcohol has a burn presence plus there's a slight acidic zing which gives a pretty long finish. Body was medium light and less than I expected. All in all a very tasty rich doppelbock."
"This Doppelbock was a little different than I expected. It poured out like a normal Doppelbock with a really nice deep amber color and yellowish white head. The smell of the beer had some sweet malt aromas and and some subtle hops in the background. The taste was strange to me, it gave off this sour flavor for some reason. Perhaps a bad bottle but I'm unsure. The tase I was getting from this brew kind of hindered my thoughts of what started out as a good looking brew. The mouthfeel was medium and had a light carbonation to it. If it wasn't for the taste I would have enjoyed this much more. Perhaps having it again would be a good choice."
"Sampled on May 10, 2011. It begins with a gorgeous deep mahogany brown-red pour with an inch of hed that settles down to a small, long lasting ring and leaves considerable lacing. These aromas are all over the place and quite exceptional with figs, molasses, licorice, dark fruits, and toffee. The body is medium to full. The taste has this voracious sharp raisin-figgy sweetness followed by a dry, flavorful hopped finale. Something out of the ordinary."
"O - A superb Doppelbock."
"Pours a moderate brown color that is pretty transparent. Thin tan head forms and then falls away very quickly. The nose has a bit of chocolate and mild malt sweetness. Pretty plain. Mild dark fruits in the background. The flavor is really plain and the mouthfeel is fairly watery for a beer of this style and strength. Mild malt sweetness and a touch of caramel. Really bland and disappointing. Moderate carbonation on a too-light body. Not a very good example of the style."
"Purchased at Green Life for $3.99! Nose is primarily yeast with some light chocolate notes. Pours nearly jet black with lighter carbonation and a very thin whitish head that dissipates very quickly. Once it dissipates it almost looks like a cola in my stem glass. The taste is intense - chocolate, dark fruits, roasted malt and some sort of wood note - then finishes with a blast of hop bitterness to cleanse. The mouth feel is very nice and almost milky. This is an incredible dopplebock - maybe my favorite so far."
" Grade A Purchased at Stony's - $4.99 ea."
"Drinkability: These go down surprisingly fast, especially for 9.0%. It's not too sweet or bitter so I can put these down one after another with ease. A beer I enjoy on a regular basis."
"Very drinkable, but not overly complex. A solid version of the style."
"D- I really like this beer, hate me if you must, but I liked it more than Celebrator."
"D: I love me a good doppelbock and this one certainly fit. Definitely worth a tick."
"This is a pretty solid doppelbock. Maybe not the best out there, but great stuff."
"drinkability - this is a really good dopplebock, one worthy of a re-visit"
"while there is no indication of the 9% abv, it is too sweet to have good drinkability."
"D: Could hit the spot if you want a Dunkles, but can't otherwise find one."
" This beer is dark brown with a slight crimson tinge. the cream colored head dissapates quickly and turns to a thin film. Lacing is not real prominent, as the alcohol probably reduces it. Aromas consist of dried grains, caramel, toffee, some chocolate, and roasted notes. Hops aren't real present on the nose. Flavors are awesome! Dried dark fruit, horsefeed, toast, caramel, and even a slightly earthy quality envelop the tongue the minute this beer hits it. Hops round out the finish with a slightly dry, grassy character. Full bodied and chewy, this beer has alot going on. One of the creamiest doppelbocks I have tasted. Very easy to drink, despite its ABV. This beer could be dangerous. I want more!"
"I can't say better than Celebrator, not even close actually, but still great and worth consuming/ I wouldn't go out of my way for it but worth a purchase if you see it."
"D: Drinking this beer isn't overly difficult because the alcohol doesn't prominently stand out, however this is one that you should definitely sip considering its strength. This is a perfect beer when you need some alcohol warming on a cold night but don't want to taste the alcohol."
"Notes: For me it was a bit on the sweet side and yet it full of complexity which I do like."
"d: Great beer, damn near world class. Not quite on par with Celebrator, but it comes close."
"Tastes great, but not an exceptionally drinkable beer."
"F: Long molasses sweetness and syrupy, with brown and candi sugars, some earthy bitterness, little smoke, dries well but keeps that hint of sweetness, dark wheat too, with no real stickiness, caramel, toasty malts, and a looong finish."
"This is a very nice beer. The traditional flavors and aromas are fantastic and it seems to be quite well put together. Given the higher abv and somewhat intense flavors, I may be sticking to just a sampling of this, but it sure is tasty."
"Poured a nice rich brown with a small light brown head which was a bit lacking. Smell was extremely malt sweet with a big caramel note. The taste was a bit extreme on the malt bomb side of things, barely hinted at the booze, but became a bit cloying on its own, fared much better with Easter ""dinner"". The mouthfeel was thick and coated the mouth felt as though it left a film coating. As stated earlier the beer was a bit much on the sweetness but paired with food became much easier to handle. Not sure if I would seek this out again But wouldn't turn it down either."
"I do enjoy this beer."
"This is my 1st from this brewery and klosterbetriebe peeked my interest. This may not be my favorite dopple(far from it), but it's pretty authentic in style, one that's not all that complex. At 9% this runs high as is the body so this is not a guzzling beer, more like a big gulper every 7 minutes or so. I'll try more from this brewery in the future, i'll just need to check out the German section more often, one that I tend to overlook alot."
"Mmmmm mm! Gooood beer! Poured a beautiful huge tan foamy frothy textured head and lots of lace. Color is a rich ruby tinged mahogoney. Aroma is malty and dark ripe fruit. Flavor's that and a lot more: pick out figs, dates, plums, prunes, raisins, sweet cherries, a little pear, lots of malt, a little roasty, and booze at the end. Body is very good as is the carbonation. Almost a session, but ya better be careful."
"D - not bad for a dopplebock. I prefer korbinian or celebrator better, but this is a very good example of the style."
"1226"
"Poured from a pint bottle to a glass. Poured a dark cloudy brown with very small head that faded very fast with a little lacing. Smells very sweet and malty. Tastes very sweet with hints of alcohol and fruits. Very smooth mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable."
"The aroma is light and malty with a little caramel. The taste is light not a on there with ok feel and drinkability."
"D: Drinkable. If you're into Doppelbocks, give this one a shot."
"Overall the beer is neat and clean. The mouthfeel is medium body with good carry through and connectivity. There isn't a lot of sourness from the carbonation in the body but there is an odd bitterness at the back of the mouth. There is some sweetness up front that is 100% malt followed by a slight tinge of alcohol. Overall, drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good. I've tasted better doppelbocks and this one has a couple of obvious flaws. I would recommend it but probably wouldn't order it again."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass (almost 2 times). Pours a nice deep brown color with cherry/oak highlights. Had white colored head that went away pretty quickly. Almost no lacing on this beer. Smell is good, heavy on malts and darker fruits like dates and figs, sweet smelling. The taste picks up where the smell leaves off. Same tastes of dark fruits and a big malty flavor. Also notes of roasted barley with and with a toffee and buttery finish. Could have been power of suggestion, but I feel like you can taste a bit of the alcohol too, but not bad for being 9%. The mouthfeel is good, as light as a full bodied beer could be in my opinion, it's smooth. A pretty drinkable beer, more of a sipper though in my opinion. Cracked it open Christmas evening of 09. Very nice on a cold day, warmed me up nice."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"D - Delicious. No recoil or unpleasantness in this one, for sure. Definitely worth the cost ($4.25/pint in my case). I'd definitely recommend checking this one out."
"Pours a hazy dark brown color, few fingers of offwhite head that diminishes quickly and leaves little lacing. Smell is of carmel, molasses, raisin, prune, cherry, brown sugar. Taste is a somewhat over-sweet combination of camrmelized sugar and dark dried fruit (mostly raisin). The flavors are all good, but the sweetness should be toned down a notch or the grain presence boosted. Body is somewhat thin for the style, carbonation could use a boost. Ok beer, nothing fantastic, but still flavorful."
"It is fairly drinkable for a 9% abv."
"Very tasty, hits the spot on a lot of cylinders. I will say the appearance leaves much to be desired, with an unimpressive head and blah coloring. But the aroma is massive and enticing and the flavor is on par with the style, and it lacks the oversweetness that kills so many doppelbocks. Highly drinkable, due to its balance and intangibles."
"drinkability: celebrator is still king this beer was on the sweet side and a little thin on the body."
"For doppelbocks it is pretty high up there, a solid one for this category. I am itching to try the German version as it has less abv."
"Pours dark brown with a pittance of head that dissipates to nothing! No lacing or anything. Very light carbonation, almost tastes like a cask ale. Nose is full of heavy malts, some alcohols, smells rather strong without being too strong. Taste is full as well, somewhat malty but not very heavy, alcohols are a little bit noticeable. Also, slight chocolate notes are discernable. For a 9% goes down pretty frickin' easy. Overall a pretty good beer."
"An OK beer seems a bit thin and lacking in flavor to my tongue."
"I poured the beer into a pint glass. Dark and black. A little bit of a head to it, which felt creamy when I took a sip. I picked up a little malt when I smelled the beer. The taste was wonderful, raisins, malt, a little roasted character. Despite the beer being 9%, I didn't notice any alcohol warmth, so be careful when you drink it."
"Very easy drinking for a big brew. Too bad it's so hard to find and at a fairly high price point. Additionally, its flavor profiles better stand on their own, as opposed to drinking this with food. Those factors make this beer a likely try again, but not for probably a while."
"Drinkability is good for a 9% abv, which is non-existent. Not quite as good as the Ayinger, but still not bad."
"D- Overall, this is a pretty decent dopplebock that is worth a try. However, there are plenty of better dopplebocks out there."
"Overall, a very good doppelbock. The aromas were excellent, but the taste was not as strong as I expected. I concluded this was a good thing, because there was a lot going on in this beer."
"Pours a clear mahogany with a small tan head. Smell is very interesting - almost port-like, ripe cherries and berries and raisins, with an anise/licorice quality that is very intriguing. Fascinating on the nose! All of these aromas carry through to the flavor, which is quite sweet and brown sugary. It's very good but might be too sweet for such a large bottle...I'd be content to just have half this much!"
"Drinkability: Yuck!"
"I really enjoyed this one. There are still others that I would take over it but I think I might be getting this one again sometime."
"Got this beer at ye olde forge in Lanesboro, MA. Served in a small challace. The appearance was dark amber. The smell was that of a higher alcohol content beer with a hint of brown sugar. The taste was smooth and crisp. This was a good yet pricey beer."
"D: A well-hidden whopper at 9%, a nice beer for a cold night."
"Curator might be the biggest ABV German beer I've ever had. That won't make any beer an automatic winner, but in this case the higher alcohol highlights a recipe that's apparently generous with the ingredients. And wouldn't you know, with all that flavor I hardly noticed the alcohol, which is merely a bit player in the flavor. Big malts rule here; its complexity and depth make this a must-try for any fan of German beers, no matter the style. Das ist ein zehr gutes bier!"
"Overall, an excellent, though potent, Doppelbockbier."
"This one was decent, but I'm not very impressed. Better dopples out there."
"Cheers."
"This is a nice beer, though I can't say it wowed me. Nevertheless, it was fun to try, especially on draft."
"D - Moderate with the high alcohol, but this is worth keeping around."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, dark brown with ruby red highlights, with a yellowish-orange hue at the edges. Big bubbled-foam on top of the body, fades quickly, leaving behind light lacing. Strong floral, sweet, fuity, grassy aroma with slight nuances of roasted malt and dark fruits. Taste is roasty and toasty, hints of coffee and chocolate, semi-sweet, light dark fruit, some grape, a bit of burnt caramel. A bit astringent for my taste. Bitter and dry on the finish. Lightbodied, almost too thin for the style. Carbonation is overly-lacking, doesn't give the light a body a real pop. A bit thin, a bit watery, not enough body for a good Dopple. What flavor is there just doesn't lend any complexity to an overly-thin body."
"Drinkability- Not bad but I would probably chose other double bocks if given the choice."
"drinkablility - Pretty good, have had beeter bocks then this. I have had #2 and #3."
"Drinkability: One of the best doppelbocks I've tasted. Some go too strong, some go too complex, some are just too thin... this is very direct and very drinkable without becoming strong or heavy on the palate. Worth seeking out!"
"This is a fantastic beer.. I really am digging it. I normally don't buy dopplebocks that much even though I love German lagers... this one is way up there with some of the best, if not the best I've ever had."
"D - This is a very good dopplebock. Despite a fairly high ABV, the alcohol isn't noticeable."
"Drinkability: By keeping the cloying tendencies in check, this beer ranks among the better doppelbocks out there"
"Not bad..."
"The taste is over the top. Lots of caramel, lots of malt, lots of sweet but overall this is a really fine tasting rich beer. The ABV is rather high but that is OK with me!! As I savor this brew, it becomes even better. This is a rather new offering to our area and I will seek this out again. I try lots of beer but not that many stay on my ""keeper"" list."
"Drinkability: Dangerously so, given the alcohol. I'm not always the biggest fan of dopplebocks, but this one is really quite nice for the style."
"alas, i am stuck with uberraisin juice. the aroma is a little more dynamic"
"D: A great beer. Maybe not quite as good as some of the doppelbocks on the BA Top 100, but as far as I'm concerned, it's at least in the ballpark. Recommended."
"A unique, dynamic Doppelbock in terms of aroma, flavors, and body. Not a Lager I could drink all night, but one of the more interesting German Doppelbocks available."
"It is characterized by a nice hop balance with the sweet malt. It is obvious to me that this one is brewed with loving care -- the balance is just right and the 9% ABV is fairly well masked. Old world understatement melds with pure epicurean delight. Keep this one."
"D - This one is a little too sweet, and not quite complex enough IMO. It's a good dessert beer though."
"D: All in all, quite disappointing. 'Watery' comes to mind to describe it... the mild carbonation of a typical dopple, but the lighter body of perhaps even a substandard lager. While it performs better than some of the beers out there, it's not up to par for its class. Sorry, Ettaler, I hoped and expected for more."
"What a tasty, totally rich & satiating, thoroughly enjoyable beer, while the lack of that TCA like component would have made this perfection in a glass, it still does not hurt it enough to make this less that incredible. This is exactly what I have been looking for in a Doppelbock lately. If you are a malt lover, you have got to try this beer, it will totally satisfy any malt cravings you may have."
"From teh Co-op in Belfast. Pours a nice mahogany brown, very little head on the beer that fades quickly. Smells like very sweet malt. Tastes like malt, dried fruit but not very overwhelmingly sweet like other dopplebocks I've had before, alcohol well hidden. Mouthfeel a bit thin. Overall a really nice beer and for a nice price of $2.99, I recommend."
"single bottle from Grapes & Hops"
"Overall not at bad Dopplebock by any means. This was really a good choice and something that was really cool to enjoy. I really look forward to trying it again."
"Pours chestnut with little head and no lacing. The beer smells strongly of molasses, burnt sugar and with whiffs of yeast and alcohol. The taste is super malty, slightly spicy, sweet, more molasses, but there is also some bitterness on the finish for balance. Moutfeel is slightly slick, otherwise fairly smooth and drinkable. Not my absolut favorite dopplebock, and a little out of balance- too sweet, but worth a try."
"I would drink this again."
"D: Not my favorite doppelbock, but better than the average (at least those I've tried). Gets a bit heavy in the finish, one is more than enough. Also, the oddness of the earthy and weird salty/fishy-taste (to me), make this a version I'd try again, but maybe wouldn't rush back to."
"Bottled version same with a slight better head to start off with (though it does disappear - not unusual for high abv)."
"Drinkability: decent but not overly exciting. Alcohol levels are warming as the glass is drained. Worth a try."
"Deep dark brown color with a medium tan head and patchy lacing. The aroma is bready malt and fruit. Medium-bodied and creamy with roasted malt, fruit (raisins) and caramel flavors. The finish is tart and fruity with touches of malt. A decent enough beer, although it doesnt really fit into the Doppelbock flavor profile that I prefer."
"Drinkability: I may not remember much, but I will never forget the time I shared an Ettaler Curator with my pal, AndoBrew."
"D-A bit unbalanced for me. Not my favorite dopplebock. I personally like a bit more body and rounded sweetness."
"A very attractive dark chestnut brown color with a stiff creamy beige cap that slowly fades but does maintain a nice surface layer to the bottom and some descent lacing. Rich nose of molasses, dark malts, plum and slight hoppy ester. Medium to full body and a thin mouthfeel. Roasted malts, burnt sugar sweetness, fruity tartness like cranberry towards the end but is with a cocoa powder bitterness. Some hop resins at play but very much complimentary...balanced very well. As it warms it becomes a little more earthy, caramel notes develop and the cocoa moves closer to carob flavor. The finish has a burnt malt, burnt brown sugar, and cocoa warmth."
"Drinkability: Well it's touch to sweet for me and the 9% hits you if you drink it to quickly. Still a bit enjoyable as long as it's not in excess."
"This is a delicious dopplebock, and carries enough uniqueness to make it a must find, even if your not a normal fan of the style. Though I am, and found this absolutely entrancing."
"Drinkability is good enjoyable enough but would I buy again, ehh probably not as there are better options out there but worth a try, yes."
"Overall: A very good beer, and a nice combination of a strong lager: big taste of a high alcohol beer but the smoothness and blended character of a lager. Enjoy."
"drinkable?: nope, it could be so good.. if it was cut or cooked."
"Overall pretty dam good but not an everyday drinker for sure."
"9%.... you gotta be kiddin me. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. This brew is very, very, dangerously drinkable. The first time I have had this brew, and while I don't think it's on par with Celebrator, it is still enjoyable, and one I will certainly be tempted to purchase again."
"Drank very easy for the abv. A solid dopplebock, I will say I enjoyed the 7.0 abv German version just as much, if not more"
"I don't know that I would say this is the Holy Grail of the style but it's a good combination of preserving the style and putting an individual touch on a dopplebock. A good beer that I would recommend."
"Pours a clear dark chestnut body with a generous beige head that hangs around forever. Solid patchy lacing. Aroma is toffee, fruitcake, and brown sugar. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Taste is malty waves of toffee, brown sugar, and a hint of chocolate. Notes of port and what seems like fruity hops add a nice complexity. Very little hop bitterness. Alcohol is hidden quite well. Not as heavy as anticipated and much more drinkable. A very nice German doppelbock."
"-Oelergud"
"aperitif"
"Dark auburn red and clear, with almost no head. The smell is delicious sweet malts, very similar to Salvator. So good. The taste is the same, very sweet and malty rich with a thick mouthfeel to coat as it goes down. This is an authentic German doppelbock, and you could do a lot worse for $2.99."
"Pours with a four-finger light tan head that goes quickly leaving traces of lace. Deep clear amber color. Medium bodied and light carbonation. Malty nose. Flavor is sweet raisins, but is balanced, finishes mellow with just a hint of bitterness. $4.10 for a 500ml bottle from Tulley's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"I can't say better than Salavator, and definitively not better than Celebrator...I try not to compare beers in reviews, but the New York Times brought this on."
"D-This is one of my favourite beers. So far I can't say enough good things about this brewery, but unfortunately I have only had this and the helles. Both are a home run out of the park and can't be beat for the price."
"Wow, this was very intensley malty with tons of caramel and ""full breaded"" maltiness. But it's not overly cloying or too full bodied. There was also a note of sassafras that almost made this beer taste like root beer if it only had sugar and vanilla. Lot's of rummy, burnt fruit in the nose and on the tongue. Finishes malty sweet and warm. I was kinda freaked out at the bar - blown away by the best damn doppelbock I have ever had this side of Ayinger Celebrator."
"Drinkability: The only problem I had with this beer is that it's too easily drinkable and the bottle doesn't last long. Before I knew it, the whole bottle was gone. Even then, I still didn't feel the alcohol content. Where did the whole bottle go so fast? I guess I drank the whole bottle in a matter of a few minutes. It left me wanting more. Would I buy another bottle? I sure as hell would if I could ever find another bottle again."
"Bottle into snifter. A: deep brown, light colored head that went down pretty quickly. S: Very malty, some dark fruits and caramel. T: Chocolate and coffee, some berries and honey with a very slight bitterness toward the end. The alcohol is nearly imperceptible, which is amazing being that its 9%. M: Very thick, sticky, not much carbonation. D: A very well balanced beer, nicely subtle for a dopplebock."
"This is called the American version of the beer. I've never tried the German version, but I can't imagine it being much better than this one. It pours a typical doppelbock color (resembles a rootbeer), with a pure white head that lingered throughout the glass. The taste was malty and delicious, with very little aftertaste. The high alcohol content isn't noticable: I thought that this was a 6.5-7% alcohol beer, and was very surprised to discover that this had 9%. I've never had a beer this powerful that was this drinkable. I fully recommend this beer."
"Nice chewy mouthfeel introduces this sweet malt explosion. Notes of caramel apples combine with what I can only describe as plum pudding (a combo of raisins from the malts and bread imparted by the yeast). Alcohol makes itself known by the third or fourth sip, and warms throughout as imbibing continues. This is a nice dopplebock, though not the best available."
"Taste is dry but drinkable and does a great job of hiding the alcohol. Some fruitiness to follow the heavy dark malts and a bit of smokiness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin but smooth. This has got some balls to it at 18 proof but goes down fairly easy and I'd drink two or three at a time if I had them available. This is an above average doppler and worth looking out for."
"Chilled and poured into small pilsner glass. The head rose and fell, lingers about a centimeter off the surface with off white foam. The body is dark mahogany with warm brownish red highlights around the edges. Smell is fruity and aromatic, notes of barley, hay, rum or brandy soaked spiced fruitcake with some dark fruits like plums, rasin candied cherries and nuts. I also get notes of chocolate, hints of cinnamon and caramel the whole thing reminds me of a fruity bunt cake. Taste is similar to the smell, with lots of richness. Very chewy mouth feel nice helping of caramel notes, rich malty chocolate flavor balanced with generous hop bitterness. Alcohol is present in the taste, but not a deterrent especially in the light of the rum cake character. Personally the bottle is enough for me I doubt I could drink more than one in a sitting. I very much enjoyed this brew however Id personally prefer a slightly more complex yet alcohol subdued doppelbock like celebrator. All the same this a good representation of a doppelbock well worth a try, especially if you could compare it to its European counter part."
"I'd be interested to see how much this one differs from the original German Curator. Guess I have to go to Germany to find out."
"Poured a DEEP amber yet not quite brown with a decent head that diminished into a ring that lasted but left no lacing. Aroma was very malty with some dried fruit and maple present. Taste was very reminiscent of maple syrup, some caramel malts and dried fruit show up as well. There is a good level of carbonation and nice alcohol warmth in the mouthfeel. While this isn't at the top of my list when it comes to dopplebocks, this is a very enjoyable beer."
"Overall this beer is respectable, though on the boring side. Malt flavors are lacking and the fermentation flavors could be tamed a bit more. The bitterness was pretty cool, but was not enough to make me want to import this one again."
"Notes: This doesn't stack up against most dopples I've had in my time. I feel that I'm being generous giving it a 3 range but the lack of anything offensive it has to be at least decent."
"Im trying to find faults with this beer and really am having a hard time. Its just a super tasty, rich German Dopplebock. Easy to drink and delicious; I now can see why our friend buys it by the case. If I had the means, I might join him! Very much recommend to the malt-fiend."
"Drinkable, with complex flavors and aromas, lending to a nice finish that is inviting, and tempting."
"Perfect pour into a tall Emerson's glass reveals a clear, dark, root beer/maple syrup brown-amber topped by a dense, soft cushion of beige foam. Slightly smoky, rich malt, with stewed fruits, brandy, and a tartish, vinous character. Sugary, malty, dark fruity flavors dominate up front. Toasted, spicy, vegetal hop edge flashes here and there around mild chocolate, licorice, and tobacco. Light, vinous tangy to it; maybe even a little tart and sour creamy in the otherwise woody, bitterish finish. Nice complexity to this doppel and I'm pleased that it's not too sweet. Medium-bodied with an almost dry feel. Goes down very easily!"
"Wow. Goes right down -- despite the alcohol -- doesn't it? Very drinkable stuff. The doppelbock is making my winter."
"Very thick in body, and it lacks the crispness of most lagers, which might stand to increase the drinkability a bit, even despite the cloying caramel sweetness. Quite nice overall, though I don't often drink doppelbock, so I may not revisit any time soon."
"Its good, and like most of the genre delivers a nice, crisp, spiced mirror to the malts & sugars. Not a boring beer by any means, but not in the league of a Aventinus. Nice thing is that I think this could be both a winter and summer beer, which is not easy. I'd certainly drink it again."
"Pours a ruddy brown with a small tan head that dissipates quickly. Carbonation is active and tiny-bubbled releasing a bouquet of roasted malts and toasted walnuts. Not much in the way of fruits. Taste is malty, but the bitterness of the walnut that was in the nose comes through in the taste. This might be a welcome and interesting flavor for some, but I am not a bitter nut fan. The mouthfeel starts off fine, but the oils in the finish thin this out too much. Good, but not great. One or two at most is plenty. Certainly affordable though. My 500ml bottle was $2.50."
"Poured beer into tumbler at 50 degrees. Beer had a nice brown head that smelled slightly nutty. Very dark beer tasted great with my t-bone. It was a good blend of toasted chocolate/coffee taste with a hint of nuttyness. After taste was harx=sh though and I attribute that to the high Alc. content. It kinda blew away the great taste. I would buy again though."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is thick and full bodied with a fairly low carbonation, and the drinkability is good, especially since I can't detect any alcohol, other than a slight warming in my stomach."
"I hope this is a great example of a German Doppelbock. I really enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying others like it."
"Pours a clear but dark and intense red/brown. Has a big foamy tan head. The nose is sweet apple; maybe some grapes, and some spice coming through. A bit of alcohol. The taste is soft and complex, with a nice bready maltiness, a gentle plum sweetness, and an interesting smoky flavor. Alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is good, with a nice carbonation. Drinkability is up there."
"Celebrator"
"Ettaler Curator Dunkler Doppelbock is fantastic and should be enjoyed by lovers of quality doppelbocks and by most others as well. The fact that the recipe was created by Benedictine monks in 1609 proves that good beer is timeless."
"Aroma is quite malty with a good bit of caramelly notes in the nose. Kind of reminds me of a caramel pudding. Taste is quite malty with a good bit of toasty malt flavors and spicy, clovy hops in the finish. As the beer warmed I could also taste a good bit of molasses along with some burnt malt flavor. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied. Hard to believe this beer is 9% cause I sure as hell can't taste it. Drinkability is good for a beer of this strength. I've had better doppelbocks, but this one is pretty good and not expensive at all in my area."
"Overall, not bad. Not really on par with Celebrator, IMO, but a good backup to seek out when craving a doppelbock."
"The drinkability is good, no defects in this robust DB offering. Prosit MK"
"The real Mccoy of a German beer. Licorice, some roast barley, mollasses, caramel and chocolate malt. Well balanced, very smooth drink, despite slightly noticeable but not obstrucive alcohol. Picked up in Orlando, thanks to the store's website alerted me to look out for it."
"I was a bit stupefied by this being denoted as ""US Import Version"" on this site... I wasn't aware that there would be two different brews for special imports. Nonetheless, this beer pours with a deep, deep red color, thats translucent only when held up to a bright light. Smell is deep and malty, mostly of the dark kind. Taste is terrific and heavy, with nothing really developing until about half way through the trip down, then it really bursting with malty goodness."
"1 pint, 9 fluid ounce brown bottle without freshness dating. Poured clear mahogany with no head or lace whatsoever. Sugary molasses, caramel, a touch of burnt toast, clove, and alcohol in the nose. Very clean, but nearly empty of flavor; slightly sweet syrupy malts up front with hot fusel alcohol finish. Almost still oily and syrupy body. Not a beer I'll revisit. The aroma is OK, but the flavor is almost entirely missing apart from the over-strong alcohol."
"This is a decent enough dopple, but it's rought around the edges, a little unpleasant at times, kinda like Salvator. I'll stick with my Korbinian which seems to be the smoothest dopple I've had."
"The palate was nice and warm, but not too sweet to cloy the taste buds."
"Other notes: Carbonation ran out before I could finish the beer. The beer is quite light for a Doppelbock. I would expect that it would be more dry or more rich, but it just sat in the middle. The recipe is supposed to be from 1609 so I guess if they called it a Doppelbock back then, they are grandfathered in on the convention. I like it quite a bit, I just wasn't expecting what I got. It does go great with a good sausage though. Also, this beer doesn't seem quite at 9% Alcohol."
"Poured out into a flute, this was quite dark in color, and had a two finger head at first. The head faded quickly to a very thin ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. As can be expected with a 9% ABV beer, there was not much lacing. The aroma was very rich, with the dark Munich style malts allowed to emit a toasty sweet smell. The taste was also sweet, but not cloying. The dark fruit ester taste was very dominant here, and was followed shortly by a spicy phenolic kick. Although they did not use any malted wheat in this recipe, this was somewhat similar to a Weizenbock. This was quite an easy beer to drink considering all the complexity and strength. No wonder this Abbey/Brewery has been around since 1330."
"Poured a deep dark brown with some reddish hue with fluffy off-white one finger head,first thing that stuck out to me in the nose was the smokiness that goes along with the dark fruit and brown sugar and caramel sweetness the alcohol whafted a little but its not strong.Sweet up front quite sweet in fact raisins and caramel with some dark brown sugar as well a little bit of an alcohol burn going down.I notice just a slight spiciness and earthy note in the finish,its a smooth,slick doppelbock glides down easily if you like big malty sweet beers to me this would be a good winter sipper to take the chill off I ll be looking for this again come December I think."
"D- Very good drinking beer which hid the alcohol well, I will drink this beer again in the future."
"A good, but not a great, DB. It actually reminds me more of Mahr's Weihnachtsboock than any regular DB."
"Maroon/red when held to light, the head is full and thick, off white. The body is crystal clear with only a couple bubbles of carbonation. Smell is sweet, very sweet with brown sugar and a little banana fruitiness. Alcohol is evident, makes it a little spicy. Smooth and subtle up front, many earthy and spicey flavors reveal themselves. Sweetness is carmel and molasses, and a strong shot of alcohol. A little cloying as you keep drinking. Not sessionable at all, but has a nice moderate-to-thick mouthfeel, and is not a bad beer."
"Not a bad price though, and certainly a beer worth a try."
"Body is nearly medium and needs a little addeed oomph to support the chewy malt structure and bittersweet complexity. Carbonation is easy with a creamy mouthfeel and slick, almost sticky texture."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Drinkable and then some. Only a slight hint of warmth after a while begins to settle in as ya go and tends to slow it down. But for a Doppelbock, this is very solid and a showcase of the style. Import version or not. Me likey! ...yum..."
"Pours dark brown with a tenacious tan head. Smells of sugared prunes, cloves, molasses, and raw alcohol. The alcohol aroma is quite strong. On the palate, this beer is sweet first off, with a twinge of sourness and then bitterness. This beer is medium bodied, finely carbonated, and smooth. Overall, Ettaler's new entry in the U.S. beer market is smooth and flavorful, and a worthy entry in the doppelbock genre, but it's not going to unseat big boys in this style."
"Drinkablility: Good. This is a good dopplebock. Nothing more, nothing less. Enjoyable and one I'd gladly have again sometime."
"A slick and delicious doppel, smooth and very welcome. Yum."
"a classic dop flavor for sure. The alcohol is not hidden here too much but this is so tasty you may just overlook it. very tasty.. glad I picked up a bunch of them!"
"I haven't had it since then until now in June 2008. (I wiped out my old review and replaced it with this one.) This new bottle tastes much more like a traditional doppelbock than what I found back then. I'm not sure if the difference is with me or with this bottle. Whatever the case, I like this bottle quite a bit better. This brew (still) pours with almost no head, but the aroma is nice. It smells sweet with a dark, dried, fruit aroma. The taste further expands on the aroma. The body is quite heavy, and there's very little carbonation. There's a slight spiciness, but otherwise it tastes of long-boiled toffee/melanoidin malts and dark stewed fruit. This beer definitely has ""that special German bock character"" which rarely seems to find its way into bock beers produced in other countries. It has that lovely dark, malty flavor, but without a roasted character which you sometimes find in other inferior non-German bock beers. This Curator is the real deal. Add some more carbonation and this d-bock might be one of my all-time favorite bocks."
