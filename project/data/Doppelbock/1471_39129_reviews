"Enjoyed from the 12 oz bottle in a pint glass.  This unique coffee dopplebock pours a beautiful mahogany color with a fantastic light tan head and light lacing.  Nose of rich DEEPLY roasted coffee, light smoke, brown sugars, and even more coffee.  Flavors are up front bitter black coffee, light bready sweet malts and brown sugar to the sides, and a mild smoke character on the back with oily coffee goodness.  Very coating wet aftertaste.  Never seen one like this before, and truly enjoyed it's flavors of rich coffee being a strong black coffee drinker.  A good finisher for an evening."

"Mouthfeel is light but a little oily. Overall, it's not bad. My wife and I agree that there's nothing outstanding or offensive about it."

"O:  A good beer.  Probably won't be getting again, though."

"Medium brown color. Very carbonated pour. Very odd aroma. Reminds me of a hot sauce smell. Tastes fine. A little coffee flavor comes through over the caramel taste if the body. This beer is just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  This should be called a breakfast doppelbock.  The coffee certainly takes the lead before malt heaven shares the dance.  Very nice."

"Perkulator pours a brown color with a nice lacing head. There is a strong coffee aroma. The taste has a nice roasted malt flavor, with a big coffee flavor. The taste is very full, and complete, with a great feel, perfectly carbonated with nice strong flavors. Overall its a big coffee flavored beer."

"Overall - I am impressed. I used to disdain bocks in general - this may have reopened my mind to them. Thanks Dark Horse."
""
""
"I should have figured Dark Horse wouldn't let me down, despite the disappointing aroma. The coffee grounds as opposed to full coffee beans give an interesting coffee flavor that's not often found in coffee beers -- it's more ""gritty"" tasting. This really as excellent coffee infused beer combined with a nice choice in style. The dopplebock and coffee combination is brilliant, as the sweet malts and bitter coffee grounds come together to make a beer that drinks awesomely, and tastes even better."
"O: likely a contaminated bottle; 1st such ever from Dark Horse. Will re-review with another bottle from a different source. / Similar characterization but more positive in 2nd sample: stale coffee grinds in aroma with notably better flavor."
""
""
""
"O- not my favorite, wasn't really sure what to expect and was left a little disappointed. The coffee was not as present as I would have liked"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think this was a refreshing take on an old style of beer. Wouldn't say this was the best doppelbock out there but I am slightly biased towards coffee beers. Drinks easily for 7% abv, not available locally but hoping to revisit this one in the future"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good, interesting effort- with some clean up- fill out the body and cut down the carbonation, and make the dopplebock aspects stronger, this could be an amazing beer."
""
"Dopplebock character surfaces far more in flavor than aroma, which pleases me. Took 5 minutes to pour the damn beer, but it was worth it. I'm not a huge coffee fan, but the sweet, nutty malt and chocolate won me over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brown body with decent head and some lace. Aroma is coffee dominant with touches of roasted malts, caramel and bread. Beer is dry and fuller bodied, not so chewy, and while alright to drink with touches of sweetness the coffee is too dominant for my liking. This isn't a criticism of the beer as much as my personal preference since I'm not a regular coffee drinker at all. To me, at least, the balance is off as the coffee aspect of this beer overpowers all the other aspects of the beer (which is sort of the point)."
""
""
"Pours from a bottle with a light brown (almost coffee colored) color and a healthy tan foam head. Has a nice coffee aroma. Flavor is a strong coffee with some dark chocolate and toasted malts. Body has a light to medium feel, but is smooth and goes down nice. This is an excellent coffee brew."

"D: a good coffee beer without a doubt. interesting use of a doppelbock as the backdrop, but I certainly dig it. the doppel is not overbearing and let's the coffee do most of the shining. give it a go if you dig the coffee brews."
""
"Overall, an okay brew, a bit harsh on the coffee flavor and underdone on the doppelbock backbone. Maybe the size of this doppelbock needed to be a bit higher to compensate the coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
"Based on this experience I am altering my ratings thus: a: 4.75-3.75; s: 3/75-4."
""
""
""
"Much more coffee than dopplebock. And it's very strange how my senses- both smell and taste- perceive Anaheim chiles in the mix. But all around enjoyable, provided you like coffee."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer, just wish the smell had less burnt coffee and poured with less head. The head has an incredibly burnt coffee taste."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was smooth and medium bodied. Carbonation was just right, a slight bite."
""
""
""
"funny that the name is Perkulator because this beer tastes just like my mom's coffee that she made and still makes in her 60's percolator. i really want to like this beer. i think it is probably a good recipe but the carbonation is an issue. hopefully it was just my bottle or my batch and not how the beer is intended. without the fizz it would be a really nice coffee beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall might be hard to improve on a great style like a dopplebock, though it did smell pretty nice."
"Overall, this is a coffee lover's beer. You can drink this repeatedly and get a steady dose of coffee flavor that is usually reserved for breakfast and coffee stouts, and best of all, you get it with only 7% ABV."
""
""
""
""
"a brown ale base to a dopplebock lager with a boatload of coffee flavor, how can you go wrong? on tap at j ryans in at least a partial dark horse tap takeover, this was one of my favorite beers from them. pale caramel brown color with a bit of yeast in suspension and an inch of cream foam. the nose is coffee heavy, with some darker german malts and chocolate malts, smells like a brown ale more than a dopplebock, but its a good fusion on the malt front. the coffee isn't a dominant flavor, while its prominent, its also in balance with the sweeter grain bill and with the other elements at work here, which are earthy and dusty and wintery, all feelings more than flavors, but present to varying degrees as clear as day. no acidity at all form the coffee, plenty of cocoa notes in the finish too, a great combination of flavors a little more nuanced than a lot of coffee beers. a little sweet, and a little too much body to be all day drinkable, but I really like whats going on here."
""
"Horrible. I did not finish the bottle. Unfortunately I have another bottle that I bought at Woodman's in the $1 per bottle mix six-pack pile. Hopefully it is from a better batch."
""
"Not traditional by any stretch, but an easy recommend for the strong coffee stout lover. If you like 'em to be all about the coffee, as do I, you will love this one."
"I like the body to be bigger in a doppel, but it holds its own. Ultimately, it's about medium in strength, fairly dry, not overly crisp but slightly more than it is smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Decent Doppelbock that is ruined by the coffee gimmick. Some breweries just don't get it. Don't mess with classic styles. The Doppelbock style is about MALT, not added spices and flavorings. At least don't try to call it a Doppelbock if you're going to brew something as mediocre as this beer. (2)"
""
"As a traditional Doppelbock this was not even close but as a coffee beer this stuff is the tops. If you are into coffee beers this is a must."
""
""
""
"D: This was gross. Not sure if it was just a bad bottle or if this beer is always nasty. But I didn't like anything about the scent or taste or body. Tough to choke this down, might be a drain pour."

"One of a few random Dark Horse bottles that I picked up without having tried before. Served in a Pilsener glass. Pours a medium-dark brown color with an opaque body. There was a crazy amount of head development as I poured, but that dissipated after about 10 minutes and there wound up being not much lacing. The smell is mild, with the coffee and malt coming through in equal proportions. The taste leans heavily to the coffee - and I really enjoy that aspect. It's not terribly complex but it doesn't need to be. The mouthfeel is a little odd, but it's hard to put my finger on the reason. Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Dopplebocks can be rather unassuming, but I think the coffee addition makes this beer stand out."
""
"O: I liked this beer as a novelty. Even though it's listed as a doppelbock, I'm not sure it really belongs there given its characteristics. Then again, I'm not sure what it would fit into."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent, but there is something about the mouthfeel that is holding me back from rating this one higher."
""
""
"I have been down on Dark Horse lately. I've sent some bottles out in trades to people who expressed mild disappointment in them, and while I like PT5 and BBPT5, I don't like them as much as the masses and don't see what the fuss is all about. I really enjoyed this beer, though and it has me reconsidering DH as an upper-echelon brewery."

"The feel is nicely slick, almost viscous or creamy, with a dry feel too. This holds a lot of schizophrenia like qualities which makes it a truly interesting beer."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor of coffee works for the style, but the overall effort backfired. Either that, or this bottle isn't that fresh. How would I know without any bottle date info?"
""

"Pours dark brown with reddish hue and a small head. Aroma is coffe and pepper spice. Interesting combo. Lots of coffee up front with light fruit flavor and spice on the finish. Lingering coffee flavor. Prickly carbonation, but heavier body than expected (medium mouthfeel). Nice changeup, though the spice is a bit strange with the coffee. Overall a decent brew."
"Overall a real fun example of coffee in a doppelbock, probably the best one I've had to date."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/5/2013. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of dark roasted coffee, caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown bread, light raisin, light apple, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of coffee, malt, and yeast notes; with decent strength. Taste of dark roasted coffee, caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, apple, raisin, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, roast, toast, toffee, apple, raisin, brown bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt, coffee, and yeast notes; with a fair amount of robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is good; could use more body though. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good doppelbock style. Good balance and complexity of coffee, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. Not as malty robust as I was hoping for, but still a nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is interesting. Very high carbonation and a medium body leaves this very drinkable yet not too thin. Perfect for fall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had high hopes for this beer but having tried it twice now, I guess it is just not the beer for me. I really get the taste of coffee that has been left on the burner for way too long (and not great coffee at that). The mouthfeel is really light for the doppelbock style and other comparable beers - almost like iced coffee was poured into the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this beer is very drinkable, especially at its price point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Worth trying but isn't a go-to for me. Again, the coffee is a nice touch but it could have been done better I feel"
""
"Overall, would like to try at the brewery to see if it's better fresh. I'm hoping this is simply the byproduct of a poorly stored bottle."
""
""
"Very interesting beer all around, and really quite far from what I was expecting. I wanted a malty, sweet doppelbock with a nice, light coffee addition. It tastes more like straight up burnt coffee beans with almost no mention of doppelbock in the flavor or the aroma. It's not bad, but it's not something I would regularly reach for. Dark Horse should stick to ales."
""
""
"Overall a well crafted lager. Smooth and rich."
""
""
"O: I do recommend this beer, mostly to coffee drinkers. I think the appearance is very ""dopplebock-ish"" but the flavor is mostly just coffee. If a person is looking for a good dopplebock to drink, I would recommend they look elsewhere. This is a very good coffee flavored beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: the coffee leads this beer and the dopplebock takes a back set, not that this is bad."
""
""
"The thing I love about this beer is that it reminds me of drinking an iced Irish coffee. It is a coffee dopplebock as stated on the label so obviously coffee is the driving force behind the flavor but as I said before you can slightly taste alcohol, then you add some vanilla cream and sugar and there you have it."
"O: Pretty solid as a coffee beer but somewhat lacking as a double bock. But what would you expect with the addition of coffee? Still, an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"Nice light fizzy texture, crisp, good coffeee taste and aroma.. missing actual beer tastes though, but it's quite a nice drinking beverage."
""
""
"Overall: Eh, it's good if I am in the mood for an iced coffee made with somewhat stale tasting coffee. The sweetness and malts are great, but they take a definite backseat to the coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Follows the trajectory of most Dark Hose beer I've encountered. It's solid, but not great. Drinkable with enough flavor to remain interesting. A good use of coffee coupled with a rich sweet malt base. A little unbalanced in the end and that hurts in this case, but it's par for Dark Horse."
"O: I liked this one better than most. Cool beer."
""
"There is a reason certain beers are brewed under the Reinheitsgebot. The doppelbock is by far my favorite beer style, so I was naturally skeptical that a brewery would seek to alter such a strong and already flavorful style. My skepticism was well founded. I picked up a four pack of this brew, in hopes that it would be a nice marriage of dark beer styles. Sadly, it was not. The coffee grounds did not mesh well with the strong flavors of the doppelbock style. The nose smells of rich malt but then diminishes with the coffee smells. The taste also exhibits a conflicted character with the strong maltiness and caramel notes competing with the coffee notes. This one is a unique experience, but not one I'd seek out again."
""
"Pours a darker brown with a small head at pour which disappates to around the rim of the glass. Unfiltered look - very - almost too much. No real lacing present. Aroma is sweet malts - brown sugar - with a strong backbone of coffee. Taste is great - coffee is a bit more forward - deeper roast along with a good dose of malt flavoring. Heavier. Great combintation."
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid beer. A nice spin on the dopplebock but it doesn't taste anything like a dopplebock in all honesty. Very nice solid beer for the price, but the lack of thickness is a huge turnoff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Coffee dopplebock? What?!? This is certainly a strange pairing, but somehow these people have made it work well. It's malty, but not robust. It's got the coffee kick of bittersweetness and it actually compliments the dopple style brew. It smells malty and a little of coffee. It tastes really good! The bottle I have does not look like this picture but has a big goat headed man on it and looks like it came from a metal video. I think this packaging better reflects what this beer is truly about as it is a pretty unholy union of flavor to create something compelling and interesting and new. This is a high alcohol brew with an easy drinkability. You should try it out, it's not for everyone but it sure is interesting!"
""
"O: All coffee, no doppelbock. This was a disappointment. A very dirty and haphazard beer, and it completely lacks depth."
""
"I am very surprised by this one. It is obviously coffee grounds in your face holes. It's a great twist on a Dopplebock and a solid one at that. I could drink a couple of these in one sitting. It really feels like the perfect marriage of the two main flavors. I like it."
""
""
""
"I cannot say I have had a beer quite like this before, but was pleasantly surprised. Dark Horse did a nice job seemingly combining the roasted oats and coffee of a more robust stout with the nuttiness of a brown ale. I’m not sure it is really a doppelbock, but I think the accomplished their mission."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-This beer is flat out awesome. One of the best imitations of coffee I have found in a beer. Take away the bubbles and it could be confused for coffee. Underrated beer for sure."
""
""
""
""
"A tasty stout-ish coffee brew, good robust flavor and goes down easy. A bit odd for a bock maybe, but worth trying and pretty easy to like."
""
""
""
"I'm not sure how I feel about this. It is definitely what it promises to be; a doppelbock with coffee. The problem for me is that this beer is dominated by coffee which almost completely covers up what could have been a solid, stand-alone doppelbock. It's not that the coffee is bad, but I wish there was a bit more balance allowing each flavor to come through. This was nice to have once, but the next time I'm in the mood for a doppelbock I'll probably go for a classic."
"Overall, a good brew with complex flavors and well balanced. I'd drink it again."
""
""
"O - This is the best coffee tasting beer, aside from the more traditional stouts and porters, I have had. It has a big coffee aroma and taste. This is a great coffee beer to drink if you are not in the mood for the fullness of a coffee stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""

" ~ This is a fantastic beer. I'm extremely impressed with the 'head' and warming effect it has. I will definitely be recommending this to my pals. 4.5"

"i was expecting a little bit more of a mindblowing experience from this one since i hear great things about this brewery, and to be honest the label artwork was so bad ass! i wasn't all that impressed, though it is a nice tasty dessert beer. i believe i paid $5 (plus the shipping cost to get this in nj), which i would say not worth it to do again, but i am glad i finally got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: an average brew - not bad, but nothing really stood out about the beer; not being a devotee of the style, I tried to score it a little higher than my initial impressions would have dictated. My bias: I think I am partial to the notion that coffee flavors in beer are best suited to porters and stouts. This was not a beer I'd return to, but I would not discourage someone else from trying it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Almost like Peche Mortel's younger brother. A solid coffee infused beer that does one thing, and does it well."

"O: this is a tasty brew, particuarly if you like the use of coffee in your beer, the sweet malt backbone balances out the bitterness of the coffe rines, very nice."
"O-Impressed by the balanced of the coffee, wasn't that overpowering. Maybe some more of the Doppelbock could have come out but all in all it was tasty."
""
""
"O: A good dopplebock. A really good dopplebock. This one has a lot of flavors mixed up together and they really do go well. This is a good one and I'm glad I have another bottle."
"O: a very interesting and unique brew. Most dopples are malt bombs, but this turns them on their head with the addition of the coffee. I love thier interpretation and willingness to up the ante on the style. Big fan of Dark Horse and this does nothing to change my opinion."
"O: This has a coffee character much unlike most dark coffee beers: it’s light, it’s aromatic, and it’s much more like coffee and cream than fresh-ground java. I enjoyed it immensely. I could see myself drinking this is in the morning or after dinner, though I think I’ll keep the pre-noon drinking to a minimum…at least until the weekend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: All in all, this is a good brew. Nothing really spectacular going on but worth a try if you like coffee beer. It features mild coffee with overall mild flavors capped off with an alcohol bite. This one would be a good substitute for coffee on a late fall morning in the woods of Maine."
""
"Very light on all the flavors and the alcohol is way too prevelant."
""
""
""
""
"Very nicely done."
"After note : Some dark coffee powder like thing settled down at the end of glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An impressive and enjoyable beer. I like how the bready, toasty Dopplebock notes work in harmony with the coffee."
""
""
"I've passed over this many times. It's now on my radar. Definitely worth a shot."
"Although Perkulator is inspired by traditional dopplebocks, I would prefer more adherence to the malt richness rather than caramel sweet taste. The base beer favors the sweet tooth rather than the savory fullness and bready textures. As the coffee registers with the taste buds, they seem a bit strained and lacking the freshness or silkiness of the classy coffee shop. This version is a satisfying beer but becomes a bit ambiguous."
""
""
"This beer is hazy amber brown with very little of an off white head. The nose is slightly roasty and rather bland. The beer starts out with a smooth feel with toffee and caramelized dark fruits. It follows up with some roasted notes. The last taste of the beer is all coffee, strong, roasty and dry coffee flavors stick on the palate. The beer sounds like an unusual blend but somehow works and doesn't really taste as strange as you may expect. This is a well done and unique brew. Definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
"O: not really complex, but it's good at what it does went for. Unfortunately the coffee drowns out any flavors the doppelbock base would have provided. $12 for a 4-pack at Super Liquor IV in Ann Arbor."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was a pretty good dopplebock. Wish it didnt have that faint offputting aftertaste though. Very unfortunate."
"O: interesting and definitely drinkable"
""
""
"My criticisms for this one all revolve around the doppelbock aspects being somewhat obscured by the loudness of the coffee aspects. I would have preferred a bit more doppelbock backbone supporting the coffee rather than getting smothered by it. A coffee doppelbock is a great idea; but in this brew, it feels as though the two ideas are fighting each other rather than working cooperatively. And for better or for worse, the coffee faction is winning, quite decisively."
"Overall very happy with this years brew. It has been hit or miss in the past but glad 2012 was A O K."
""
""
""
"Solid beer, but ultimately forgettable."
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are better coffee-flavored alternatives out there."
"O: A solid beer overall, if a bit simple. The coffee unfortunately overwhelms the doppelbock aspects, but it's still enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark Horse certainly wasn’t lying when they labeled this beer as coffee Doppelbock. Did this beer have TOO much coffee? No, I think it had the right amount of coffee in it. It was just the quality of the coffee they put in this beer. The coffee was far too dry. As is, it’s not a bad Doppelbock. If you’re ever in the mood for a dry beer with a strong taste of coffee in it, then pick up a bottle of “Perkulator.”"
"I love coffee almost as much as beer and this is good example however the wet coffee ground aroma detracts. The flavors really come together as it gets warmer."
"Poured this at a good temperaturre with a medium size, light tan, foamy head that soon settles and no lace. Color is a clear mahoganey with a plenty of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, coffee, molasses, roast, dark ripe fruit. Flavor's like nose, not overly sweet, slight bitterness, and enough carbonic tang to balance. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, fairly long, and a liittle boozy. Not entirely convinced that coffee can be used in almost anything."
""
""
""
""
"For what this is, it isn’t too bad, as it does seem to successfully find that middle ground between coffee beer and Doppelbock. The coffee definitely makes an impression in this though. This one is interesting. I’d be willing to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer starts out nicely but the earthy dirt-like flavor stemming from the coffee is bothersome. The idea of a coffee doppelbock is awesome but either this is too old or the idea wasn't executed to the best possible way."
""
"Notes: Drank on 3/28/2012."
""
""
""
""
""
"I can dig this beer, wish the coffee flavor were a bit more pronounced and perhaps not as cooked but it did its job and did not distract from the rest of the beer. Most certainly going to come back to this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall...a good idea that just doesn't work in this concoction. add that into the fact that it seems like this is a weak doppel on its own reduces the enjoyment factor even more. good idea, poor overall result."
""
""
""
""
"Murky copper-brown, with a cream coloured head, sticky lace and dense retention. Nose features whole coffee beans, not ground or spent or whathaveyou. Like sticking your nose into a bag of yet-to-be-ground beans. Some caramel and nut notes, but the coffee sticks out immensely. Taste has a weird acidic sourness derived from a vast amount of roast, bitter and raw beans again. Dark breads and gentle caramel. Medium carbonation and an ok body. Coffee was quite interesting but way too raw to make for a great coffee beer in my opinion - however this 'rawness' certainly intrigues me. A curious beer, but I wouldn't actively seek this out again."
"It takes a bit of time to really find the 'doppelbock' in the espresso, but very flavorful nonetheless."
""
""
"very bitter result of all this: Initial coffee taste with a bourbon like secondary. Coffee dominates, its coffee aroma and a pure coffee taste. Copper brown and a nice head. Above average mouthfeel. Hard to finish this one. An idea maybe not the best executed."
"O: Probably one of the worst beers I've had in a while. I don't get coffee and I don't get doppelbock. Probably dumping this one after about 4 sips."
"Flavor is heavy on the coffee, with an almost sweet toffee or caramel hint. A solid dopplebock, and one well worthy of purchase."
""
"Overall- 4 Unique beer! I'm not getting the ""doppelbock"" at all, tastes more like a...coffee lager or something. Probably wont buy again but it's worth a try if you havent yet."
""
""
""
"O - A little all over the place, but still quite an enjoyable beer. Thanks Andy for the awesome trade!"
""
"O: not good. Coffee is too much of an after thought. Stringency is confusing as well. No good."
""
"Overall is pretty good. I'm enjoying it, but have found that the intensity of flavor is light and the ABV is not really apparent, it drinks like a smaller beer."
"O- I just tried the 2011 and not much has changed from 2010. i think aging this one only made it worse."
""
"O-Major letdown from these guys. I've had some pretty good offerings from them, but this one really let me down in a major way. I was really excited to try this too"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - If you really like lightly sweetened black coffee then you will likely enjoy this. I would have liked this more if this were thicker, and had a more substantial mouthfeel. I'm pretty green when it comes to this style but it seems this should have been a bit more full and substantial. Try it if you can make ur own 6pak ;o)"

"Pours a dark murky brown with a tightly carbonated white, but rapidly dissipating head. Sediment is settling at the bottom of the glass right away. Smell is pretty subtle - not very strong at all - smells like an old coffee filter. Coffee taste is very prominent in the first few drinks, accompanied by a strong bitter-coffee finish that hangs around a bit. Working through the glass the coffee becomes less prominent/noticeable and tastes like a semi-sweet roast. Smooth mouthfeel, with some dryness. This is an interesting beer, aside from the nose, which I don't care for, it has a decent flavor profile and drinks pretty easily in small doses."
"Pours a mahogany hue with a thin tan head that quickly disappears with no lacing or retention, but does have moderate carbonation. The aroma is strong with roasted coffee with hints of caramel, and molasses. The taste starts out with a roasted coffee taste that sticks til the finish. There is also some caramel, molasses, sweet malts and hint of bitter chocolate in the back. The coffee taste remains in the aftertaste. Overall this soft sticky mouthfeel beer seems to be a rather nice beer for coffee lovers, but just not my kind of beer."

"Poured mahogany with a half-finger of foam that dissipated quickly and leaves no lacing. Smell is coffee, light roasted caramelly malts. Taste is similar, good medium coffee, light bitterness, caramel and roasted malt, some biscuit, and light sweetness. Coffee flavor carries through from smell to taste and finish. Medium body. Light carbonation. Hits the right notes when you're in the mood for a coffee-forward beer."

"O-A pretty nice beer, only complaint is a little heavy on the coffee bitter astringent bite. If you like coffee- this is your beer."
"A fellow drinker noted that this is the first ""coffee beer"" he has had that actually tastes like coffee."
"overall: great example of a coffee beer."
"The beer is dark copper to ruby hued with a quarter inch of light tan head that leaves random lacing on the glass. The aroma offers coffee, chocolate, malt. Nice smelling beer. The flavor brings milk chocolate, lager malt. Really nice. Lots of chocolate milk flavors. Pretty straightforward. Decent beer. I would have this again."
"D - A very interesting and well executed offering from the fine folks at Dark Horse... Quite unique and slightly different from almost anything else that I've experienced... A must try for true beer lovers and something that I'll gladly invest in another 40pack in the future..."

"O: The beer is an interesting take on the style but the coffee taste somewhat resembles convenience store coffee that has been lingering for several hours."

"Overall: My biggest fear when drinking coffee beers is that it will feel like I am drinking a coffee with alcohol instead of tasting some beer. I am very pleased to say that Dark Horse does it right. Here the coffee accentuates the beer and gives the dopplebock style a different flair. The dopplebock side is very solid. The coffee is far from overpowering and it really works well here. This shoots up to be one of my favorite beers from the brewery because of that. Kudos to Dark Horse to a job well done. I will be picking more of this up."

"Very good Doppelbock. This one is very well balanced, not too sweet, very drinkable, and the coffee adds a nice layer of complexity."
"I enjoy a good cup of coffee and a good brew so I thought I'd give this a try. This brew poured smooth and had an excellent appearance. I really liked the smell but the taste was simply too much coffee for me. The coffee taste overpowered the dopplebock. It's very unique. This was like drinking cold coffee infused with beer. I don't know if this has any caffeine in it or not. If you're a coffee lover give it a try!"

"Chewy chocolate malt base, caramel sweetness with intense flavors of roasted coffee. Perhaps a touch of brown sugar. Heavy malt flavors with moderate carbonation."
""
"Dark, murky brown in color. Light head with a small amount of lace. Get mostly coffee in the nose. Gets a bit sweet caramel malt aroma at the end. Taste is like the nose. Coffee taste up front. Turns sweet very quickly. Very sweet malts take over. A little bitter at the end. But fairly nice. A little burnt taste too. Thinner drink in the mouth. Not bad drink."
""
"I didn't have super high expectations prior to drinking this beer. It poured a murkey almost, but not quite opaque brown with very little head, or carbonation visible. Smell was minerally, biscuity, and just a trace of coffee. Taste was predominately coffee, with some cocoa in the background. Tasted like an iced mocha. Carbonation lightened it up a little bit. Overall, i wouldn't buy this again, but I did drink the whole thing, if that's sayin anything."
""
""
""
"D- very drinkable and unique."
"Excellent."
""
""
"Not bad, but not sure if I like it. Well made, decent balance, and delivers as promised."
"That's about it. Overall I liked this beer enough but I have enjoyed several other coffee beers more. I think this flavor needs to be backed up by a much bigger, maltier beer. Not bigger in alcohol, more so in body and overall flavor. The coffee porters and stouts I've enjoyed have handled the coffee much better. I'm actually curious how they added the coffee, whether it was flavoring, beans, grounds, or straight brewed coffee. Maybe changing the method would work better IMHO."

"Pours a murky brown with a finger of head that has no retention. The nose is distinctly coffee-like as is the upfront taste. The finish is lingering coffee bitterness. This is a spectacular idea - the blending of coffee with a bock beer. Previously, I have only experienced coffee notes in stouts and porters - and most of them have provided only weak coffee undertones. This dopplebock holds up to the rich java flavor and stands as a unique example of the use of coffee in beer."
""
""
""
""
"Very interesting dopplebock, if it was darker and a tad thicker it would seem more like a dry stout with coffee."
"Overall: Bonus points for the unique experience, but ultimately it comes across as flavored coffee with some out-of-place noble hops. I guess there is a reason most add coffee to Porters and Stouts."
""
""
""
"O: Very surprised some of the great sweet notes that came out of this guy. A little more body would have added some good depth to help the flavors stick around for a little while longer."
""
""
""
"Pours a two-finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Opaque dark brown color, yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Roasted coffee nose and flavor follows - a good, almost sweet roasted coffee. $2.95 for a 12oz bottle from Julio’s Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"O: I was good for the style, but not super good, I liked it but pretty forgettable."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with lots of carb bubbles rising toward a bubbly tan cap on top. Lots of coffee on the nose would be an understatement. I think I find hints of chocolate and caramel underneath but honestly I can't smell past the coffee. If its any consolation its a very pleasant coffee aroma not harsh or acrid like some have made. Taste is coffee right up front, and in the finish. There is some melanoid and caramel flavors about midway through but they are quickly displaced by java. Medium body and carbonation level, slick bubbly mouthfeel. Nice drinking beer flavored coffee, oh wait its the other way around. I liked this one but at times had trouble finding a dopplebock in my glass."
"I am going to leave the other ones sit in a warm place and see what happens, i have no worry of ruining these bottles."
"D - Nicely drinkable. Good winter beer. Will be getting this again; this is nice."
"Lots of coffee, but it tastes more like scorched green chiles. Kind of a burnt over the campfire flavor. Thinner body than expected but fairly malty. Sharp and a touch of the sour. Smokey nose. Old vegetable broth with chocolate cherries. Nice golden brown color with long-lasting lacing."
"O- Good, but not great. Coffee was a great conceptual component for this style, but a bit old. Maybe this would be awesome on tap? I did love the nuttiness of the base doppelbock. I would drink again, but probably not buy another 4pk"
"Dark copper in color.Beige lasting foam.Small bubbled crown.Toasted caramel malt,sweet coffee & yeast to the nose.Sweet flavor,dark fruit notes & hints of cocoa.Gentle bitterness.Medium body,soft carbonation.Mildy coffee aftertaste.ABV is felt. Even though drinkability is good."
"lager and coffee... hmmm these guys know what they're doing. good with PH experimentation and adding something like that to a extremely hight gravity wort i'm sure makes for something fun. the beer shines after a bit of air. the coffee the quick drop of a malty lager and the feel pays. but fluffy coffee is a bit redundant. there is balance the abv is unbelievable smooth. a bit of toastiness ... not roasted coffee notes. a nice drop. a nice mineral coffee hint. great great blend. i can see some interesting forrest fruit coming out of a the mix if tweaked a bit. still can't complain. innovative brewery."
"O: A simple coffee beer. Definitely one to try if you love coffee because there isn't much more to this one. It's not like a coffee porter or stout where there are other aspects, this literally tastes 95% like cold coffee with a bit of alcohol in it."
"There was not that much to the smell and taste with this, I like a coffee beer to really pack a punch. I could taste a bit of fruit and coffee, so it seems on for the style but just not what I was looking for"
"O - Tasty and smooth, a refreshing coffee beer; a nice change from coffee porters and stouts. Probably great around a campfire."
"Body is medium, finish is long, but flavor is severely disappointing. There's little joy in this one, and you won't see me drinking another, sorry."
"Poured from bottle into my DFH snifter. No date on the bottle. Pours a rich dark dark brown/black color. Nice off-white head fills the glass, decent retention to about 1 finger. Smell- iced coffee, tea leaves, some mocha notes in there. Its clear that this one is all about the coffee. Taste- roasty coffee notes, dark chocolate in the back of the throat. Perfect balance between the coffee flavors and the dopplebock flavors you would expect. Awesome carbonation here- its on the rich side in terms of carbonation, and it actually does wonders for this beer in making it a refreshing experience. Overall, I really like this one. I would seek out again- a good coffee beer is pretty valuable to me, and I don't get many good ones locally."
"Randall"
"O: Mouthfeel aside, this is pretty much exactly what I would want out of a coffee dopplebock. Easy to drink, substantive without being overbearing. If this had a bit better head, this would be up there with NG's Uff Da for my favorite bock. As it is, it is just half a step below. Truly recommended."
"D/O- Enjoyed overall but the coffee aspect took away from the token dopplebock flavors that I wanted to find in this Dark horse offering. Would recommend to coffee beer lovers but not to dopplebock lovers."
"Overall: I liked it but at the same time i was also a bit indifferent to it. I enjoyed the flavor but the overall impression left me wanting. Wanted a fuller, meal-like beer."
"O - Didn't really enjoy this beer. I can certainly taste the coffee flavor especially in the aftertaste, but it's that spicy cayenne pepper flavor that dominates most of the other flavors in this beer."
"An interesting take on the doppelbock, but this version completely drowns out most of the doppelbock nature and therefore primarily fails, in my opinion. This is more of a coffee bock than a doppelbock (and the coffee doesn't even taste particularly good)."
"I honestly cannot say this tastes anything like a dopplebock, let alone even beer. But..I like it. Simply a sweet coffee flavored brew. Will probably purchase again."
"I'd love to love this one more, but I have to say the sour in this particular beer isn't my preference."
"O- This is no doubt a good drink and well crafted, but it's not really to my tastes. I'm not into the coffee with cream taste. If you are, check this out."
"Fuller medium body, a bit creamy and pretty smooth on the palate. Definitely a pretty strange beer, although it pretty much delivers what the name implies."
"Pours out as a brownish orange color without much head. The beer is a bit lighter in color than I expected. The smell is heavy with coffee. I'm not really able to pull much more from this. The taste has a big and bold coffee flavor to it. There isn't much depth here. It's like drinking a chilled black coffee to me. I wasn't able to get much malt of hop flavors at all. The coffee just really over powers everything in this beer. The mouthfeel in medium and doesn't have much carbonation. Overall this was a little disappointing."
"The appearance is probably the best part of this bottle. nice reddish orange color with a small head. just coffee on the nose. coffee at first with the taste, then sweet. The aftertaste reminds me of a cherry blowpop. Unique flavor, but not very impressed. Once is enough for me."
"Pours a thin brown with a small head. Smell is pretty reserved coffee, not much else. Tastes like a cold coffee poured into a Sam Adams. Finishes with just a hint of sourness. As it warms, more coffee, bitterness and sweetness comes out. It's a bit odd tasting and not particularly enjoyable. This is a bit thinner than expected for a doppelbock. Overall, I don't think this is a very successful experiment. It seems like they toned down a Doppelbock's sweetness and body to allow the coffee to come through to neither's benefit. Not undrinkable by any means, but not nearly my favorite."
"I had a more proper tasting of this just recently on tap at the Trapp Door in Emmaus, PA. As above, I still recommend this beer for coffee-lovers...and ONLY for coffee-lovers. Pours clear, dark brown, with a thin, wispy head. Big aroma of coffee grounds, and not much else. Taste was almost pure coffee, almost like drinking a cold, thin cup of the stuff. There may have been some other subtle complexities present, but the coffee pretty much overwhelms everything. If that's your thing, then great, you'll love it. But it's not really my thing, so I didn't love it."
"D-This is my firstdoppelbock to have and i wasn't that impressed, ill keep trying this style but this beer just tasted alittle to watery for me and also had alittle too much of a smokey taste for me. Felt alittle unbalanced too."
"While the appearance is near perfect with excellent retention and lacing, the flavors just were not up to par in my opinion. I would be very interested in trying this beer on tap as I believe the coffee flavors would really help this beer if they were fresher."
"Drinkability: Interesting beer here. Bock flavors and tart fruityness."
"O- Enjoyable. I am not sure I would buy it again, but I did enjoy it. The appearance could be improved, but not if the taste is lost. A very pleasant beer at anytime in the day, just not more than one bottle at a time for me."
"M - Light to medium body; light carbonation."
"Glad I tried it; had been meaning to try something from Dark Horse. I just won't try this one again."
"D - A good beer at a good price. If you like sweet coffee, go grab this."
"D: Certainly a unique beer. Coffee, nutty flavors, and sweetness. A nice combination, but I was hoping for more of that doppelbock malty sweetness. This is a beer I wanted to love, but it's not quite there for me. The flavors mix in odd ways and just don't mesh well."
"D - Its good but not great, finishes a little warm. Gonna pass next time."
"Drinkability / Mouthfeel - Very drinkable. Definitely a sipping beer that you'll want to spread your bottles out over the nights. Since I can't get Victory at Sea here, this is my new closest favorite local. My second Dark Horse Beer; and it didn't let me down."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass on 09/07. Dark brown body, 1 to 2 finger tan head- dissipates quickly. Nose is filled with dark fruit, a bit of coffee, and caramel. The taste brings more dark fruit, coffee, caramel, and adds some toasty nuts and a bit of roasted malt. A bit of vanilla is also noticeable. Medium body and low carbonation in this one. I'm a fan of Dark Horse and this one doesn't disappoint. Good sipper but a tad too sweet to drink a bunch."
"Well as a traditional dopplebock, this might not fare so well but as an American interpretation of the style (God knows we American's love to fuck with our beer), I think it tastes very good, although the coffee flavor is intense, maybe a little much for those who aren't a fan of coffee to begin with."
"Courtesy of seeswo. 12oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Pours a semi-translucent mahogany with a loose, bubbly, half inch, khaki-colored head that loses half its volume in a matter of seconds and eventually disperses into a band around the shoulders. No lacing on this one. Nose expresses slightly vegetal coffee grounds, a hint of lactose and something sweet. Taste reveals slightly vinous fruit, a sugary character and coffee grounds - less vegetal than in the nose; however, the flavor lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a lively, almost prickly carbonation. There's also some acidity that stimulates the tip of the tongue and the sides of the cheek. An interesting interpretation of the style; however the coffee grounds flavor gets to be a little much."
"I think it's cool that Dark Horse came up with a new sub-style and almost nailed my best expectations. Get rid of the steelyness and with some tweaks to the body and carbonation this could be great."
"D-Above average, but I would not go back for another."
"This beer pours a dark, muddy amber with a one finger foamy beige head. It smells very strongly of coffee beans and sweet malts. The doppelbock definitely comes out in the flavor. There is little coffee and you get a lot of yeast, sweet malts, bread, and some strange fruit. It's appealing but is kind of odd for a doppel. It drinks fine, it's both fresh and crisp with good carbonation. Despite my ranking, I actually do like this because I'm not a huge fan of traditional doppelbocks. This beer has good flavor and is very drinkable. The alcohol isn't present at all."
"d - Good but the taste seems a bit watered down. A bit too carbonated as well. Would like to have again."
"D- Other than the carbonation issue this is a very good beer, I would definitely drink this one again"
"Mouth is very overcarbonated. Good drinker though."
"The palate opens with a big coffee character with some dark fruit character - figs in particular - along with some moderately bready flavor. Mildly wheat-like. Drying on the finish with plenty of coffee flavor with very low coffee bitterness or acidity, emphasizing the fruitiness. Moderate caramel sweetness is present, particularly on the mid-palate. All of this really makes this taste like dulce de leche + coffee. Medium in body, this is rather dry. Carbonation is moderate, but the finish is a little disappointing as it doesn't have much lingering flavor, just some carbonic acid. This is a rather terrible dopplebock, but it is a rather enjoyable beer. The purity of the coffee flavor makes me think of fresh Peche Mortel."
"mouthfeel is smoother tasting that some traditional doppelbocks I've had. lower carbonation. easy to drink, but overall drinkability is maybe limited because it only pairs well with certain foods due to the flavors."
"D - I may have it again if given the option but I could use more body in my doppelbock. Still it was a pretty great beer."
"D: Drinking one at a time would be great. But I would probably not have another one right away. The flavor is a little on the stronger side, so one at a time would probably be better."
"Good drinkability with this brew. The first whiff of the nose made me think roasted, bitter coffee but it was much more balanced that that. The creamy mouthfeel helps it go down smooth. Definitely not a beer you could have a good amount of but a couple at a time certainly isn't out of the question."
"D -- Solid offering, makes a repeat purchase inevitable. Seems just a touch diluted for what I would expect from the style, but very well constructed."
"This beer pours a murky brown with an off-white head. The aroma is totally of coffee with the slightest of malt. The taste has much of the coffee within but there is a slight malt background. It's a really odd combination of smooth maltiness. For a doppelbock this is pretty weird. There is the obvious acidity note that really clashes too much for the mouthfeel of a normal doppelbock. I pretty much like this beer, but that's only because I like coffee."
"D - Like most other doppelbocks I have encountered, it is an easy drink at a fairly high abv, so be careful, but don't hesitate to try this one."
"This is way better than I really hoped, I just thought it was something trendy or some weird idea just to be different. But I feel like this was a well thought out beer that took multiple attempts to get it how they wanted. Thanks Dark Horse, I'll be back."
"D- I like the lightness of the body combined with the coffee and roasted malt. This is a solid beer, and I'm looking forward to drinking it again."
"D: Overall, the drinkability is pretty good. I have had coffee beers that have a much smoother coffee flavor, but the malt is able to balance the coffee bitterness in this one."
"D - Tasty beer - but one is enough."
"D - This is a really delicious coffee brew. I loved the combo of a dopplebock with coffee. I was stunned at the relatively low rating. It was delicious."
"d. very drinkable, but not very enjoyable."
"Very tasty and good aromatics, but I wouldn't want to drink a ton of this one. They did do a very good job of weaving the coffee flavors and aromas into the beer without totally overpowering all of the other flavors."
"wow, really. I swear I had one of these a few weeks back and don't remember it tasting like this. Although my bottle then was at least a year old. I guess the smoke I was thinking I was getting was the roasted coffee. Hmm, well I know i""m bad at reviewing so take it for what its worth. I'll gladly finish this glass. I'm glad I got to do this one blind."
"Drinkability is not the greatest, but not bad. A hint of booze is starting to come through as it warms, with some acidicty and some of the sweetness, but it has a drier finish that helps, and the coffee comes in a good proportion, not too heavy that it overpowers the delicate beer, or so light that you can't even detect it."
"I'll have to try this one again. As it stands, not quite what I was hoping for...I love Dark Horse, and love doppelbocks (and like coffee), but this missed the mark."
"This beer has potential to be something special.. maybe if they rework it a little, they can have something unique. The carbonation really brought this beer down; too fizzy. Nonetheless, solid brew. If you're into bitter coffee, this one is still worth seeking out."
"If it weren't for the aroma that I find awful and intolerable, I could see myself drinking this one again. It's sort of out there, but it's nice enough if you can get past the smell. But I can't really do that."
"DB- The coffee flavor is very intense, I would have to say a bit too much, it feels one dimensional. A strange Doppelbock. The sour, bitter coffee and a bit of alcohol eventually make me tired of this one."
"D - Ehh...just ok for me. This isn't exactly what I was expecting from a doppelbock...even a coffee one. The coffee takes away much of the rich maltiness that I associate with the style. Seems more like Dark Horse is trying to make a Coffee Bender competitor but can't quite match the way the sophistication of the coffee in that brew. Ultimately, I'd say not a bad beer, but it misses the mark a bit for me."
"D: Not at all bitter and very little after taste. If it wasn't for the sweet taste, this beer would be a high 4 for drinkability."
"I'd drink it again!"
"I have mixed feelings about this one. The taste wasn't bad, but the mouthfeel needs to be thicker, and it could be a bit less cloying."
"D - not sure about the age of this bottle, but i enjoyed it much more out of the tap. the coffee just seems to be a bit off, and sweetness is much more abound this time around. still a really good breakfast beer."
"Overall: Dark Horse did well on this beer, but I'm not sure it is for me. They accomplished what they set out to do, marry a powerful flavor to a subtle and classic style. Mission accomplished."
"A good beer for those that like coffee infused beers. Coffee haters need not look for this beer as it is the major player in the beer."
"Finish is a medium bitter ""bright"" coffee character."
"Dark Horse is one of my favorite brewers but this was a iserable failure."
"One of the few Dark Horse beers I had not previously tried and I am glad to have picked this one up. I do love coffee beers and this is one of the more interesting. A few deductions were taken due to style, some characteristics just did not fit. Very nice beer to nurse but I think one is all I need."
"The flavor is a coffee bomb with a late caramel flavor. This beer is super thin, no carbonation, creamy in the mouth, bitter finish. This is not that much fun to drink, definitely better doppelbocks out there."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Color is a dirty, hazy brown with a lift tan head. Nose brings an interesting combination of coffee, roast, smoke, and dark fruits with a bit of caramel malt. Taste is more coffee with the other flavors coming in underneath. Good body with a nice coffee bite. Another interesting concept and another success."
"Mouthfeel is medium and carb level is right where I'd like it and within the style guidelines. Drinkability is average simply for the stale coffee taste. No alcohol flavor or aroma can be detected which is good."
"D - This is solid, fairly enjoyable, and would not refuse it, although wouldn't seek it out."
"D: A coffee dopplebock is a novel approach, and as beers that utilize my second-favorite brewed beverage go, this is pretty great. A little one-dimensional, but very drinkable and very tasty."
"D: Interesting pairing- coffee with doppelbock.. can't say that it's my favorite combo, but I'm not sure if that is more due to the stale coffee character or if it is the pairing I'm not the biggest fan of. Either way, the beer is drinkable, but not very well balanced."
"Very unique with just the right amount of coffee. Very nice!"
"Overall: An interesting idea making a coffee dopplebock. Falls a bit short. A tad too much sweetness and not enough coffee. Alcohol is hidden nicely. Very drinkable but not earth shattering."
"very easy to drink with a intriguing take on the style."
"It just isn't the best 'coffee' beer I've had, but it isn't the worst. Its a good representation of the style at least."
"D- not bad, i dont see myself drinking a lot of these, its appropriate for the colder months, overall an decent brew"
"D:I am really impressed by what Dark Horse did here with the coffee beans in this brew. Definitely not a traditional Doppelbock recipe, but very tasty. Definitely doesn't drink like 7.5%."
"Edit 2: I think this music video is about his beer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftlkegBeNE"
"D - Big thanks to BuckeyeNation for the hook-up. Coffee Doppelbock is theoretically one of the most promising and delicious emerging sub-styles, and this is perhaps a cornerstone example."
"D: I find the ABV to be very hidden and the notes all expressed very well for the intention and style. This is a very smooth and easy going brew."
"D- Nice beer for autumn, makes me wish I would have brewed the style for this season."
"This beer looks, smells, and tastes like a café au lait, sort of a milk stout smell and consistency with a heap of coffee mixed in. It's missing a lot of the bready complexity of the professed dopplebock style, but that's replaced with an acidic lactic burn and a sweet quality that's enhanced by the coffee flavor. Sort of closer to Southern Tier Jahva than Dieu du Ciel Peche Mortel in terms of coffee flavor. A sweet, candy-like coffee beer when I expected something more earthy and herbally bitter. Despite the fact that it hardly fits the style, it's still highly recommended."
"D: It is good, but I feel like the coffee is used as a bit of a cover up. Still. Good, tasty, and fairly repeatable."
"I am blown away by this beer. Has a unique twist on the style, but delivers true to a doppelbock wr the same time. What an experience and what a beer. I will be getting more of this one and could put back a sixer myself I think. A must try."
"Overall a great doppelbock and/or coffee beer. No matter how you look at it, if you like coffee and you like this style, you should love this beer."
"overall - its pretty decent. its a very smooth and the coffee flavor does very well in it. very easy to drink."
"Fairly light bodied and very drinkable. This beer has totally reworked my opinion of Dark Horse."
"D - I like coffee flavor, but this stuff might be a little over the top. I'm gonna have a few more and might have to revisit this review. It can't be as strong as Speedway Stout... right... right!?"
"Drinkable? Like a cuppa joe !"
"This pours a very dark brown, somewhat copper when held up to the light, with a heavy cream-colored head. It has a strong roasted coffee aroma, I didn't really get any of the familiar bock scents, just coffee. The coffee was much stronger in the nose than it was on the tongue. This beer had a strong malty sweetness, lots of caramel goodness going on here, with the coffee only coming through at the end on the back of the tongue. I liked it a lot, neither flavor was fighting for the spotlight and it turned out to be a well balanced brew. Perkulator was a truly interesting beer, Dark Horse gets some bonus points for trying something new with such an established style."
"*sigh* Well, anyway, this guy pours a murky panoply of shades of brown topped by about a half-finger or so of glowing off-white foam. The nose begins with a nostril-stabbing blast of cocoa-drenched coffee beans, sweeter than I've ever beheld such beans before. As this scent slowly fades, some dark toffee, burnt molasses, dark leafy greens, and oak meld together to form a fairly convincing malty backdrop. The taste is pretty much summed up in the smell, though the coffee tapers out a bit into the cocoa, making its inclusion a bit less of an imposition. Unfortunately, everything else is also toned down slightly. The body is a stoic medium, though it seems like its gaining weight, with a light carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, an interesting brew, but nothing I would really jump for again."
"Drinkability: Definitely will be picking up some more of this in the future. Really digging the coffee flavor on this. By far probably my favorite beer of the ones I've had from Dark Horse."
"Dark, muddy brown with a thin beige head that dissipates quickly and no head retention or cap. Strong coffee aromas with hints of sweet, roasted malt. Medium to full bodied feel. Very smooth with light carbonation. The coffee flavors are dominant in the beginning and taper to a roasted, sweet malt flavor. Just a slight hint of alcoholic strength at the end as reminder that this is a dopplebock. If you're a coffee drinker you'll enjoy this.Very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Dark Horse Perkulator is a beer I was not familiar with, but as I finishing dinner at City Taphouse, I thought this would be a nice beer that would pair well with dessert. The beer is very dark even by doppelbock standards and has a light coffee aroma to go with the strong smell of toasted bread, browning butter and burning sugar. The beer is like a latte with a roasted aroma from coffee and toasted malt upfront, with sweetness and body from the caramelized malt. This paired very well with a rich chocolate cake and bread pudding, both served with fresh strawberries and blueberries."
"Update 6-04-2011- It has been almost a year since I last tried this beer, I recently picked up another single and thought it was just as good as the first time I had it. I did notice that this batch had some spiciness to it that I didn't get in the last one. The nose had a frank red hot sauce like spiciness to it that was different but enjoyable, the spiciness carried on to the taste but was much more subdued and didn't over power the coffee, it actually went well with the coffee flavors. I also noticed this batch had better carbonation and head retention. Its nice to have a coffee flavored beer every once in a while that isn't a porter or a stout. This one also had a really kick ass label that the other one didn't, its got an awesome evil, death metal vibe to it that suits this beer, I like how Dark Horse gets different artists to do different versions of their labels, it shows how free thinking and open minded Dark Horse really is. I recommend it."
"Overall, a good but coffee beer that meets the coffee objective but not much else. Not sure if this is normal or if I have an aged bottle so more mellow SINCE THEY DIDN'T PUT A FREAKIN' DATE ON IT. Mild recommend if you can easily get and want to try something from the brewery. Not avail in TX so shipped back during my IN trip. Rotation - one is enough unless I could get a known to be fresh one just to make sure. [N;N]"
"D-pretty tasty, a lot of coffee up front, the flavor ups from the aroma as the taste is not burnt at all, hints of balance and complexity with the malt sweetness in the back. decent beer."
"The mouthfeel is pretty thin for the style with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's pretty close to actual coffee with a little malt sweetness. If you like coffee you will probably like this beer. Personally, I would have preferred a bit more beer flavors to it since I typically love the doppelbock flavor profile."
"D - This was a very interesting take at a hybrid style...dopplebocks are sweet which there was some cream and caramel sweetness...but the coffee part was really nice...fresh roaste coffee all around...worth the try if you like coffee"
"I don't know how often this has been done before, but it should be done more. Obviously, you have to enjoy coffee for this one, not that it overpowers in any way, but its there from start to finish."
"Rich aroma is like fine roast coffee with just a hint of powdery unsweet chocolate. It pours a clear cola brown with a fine-bubbled pale tan head that sticks around for a bit. Mouth-filling flavor is mainly of quality coffee with an undertone of chocolate and hints of malt, caramel and nuts. Texture is fairly smooth and has a good tingle to it. A bock? Tastes more like a porter or stout than a bock to me - but whatever they call it, I call it delicious!"
"This is very solid, one I'd like to try again."
"D - If you like coffee you'll like this one. This is an enjoyable beer and I'd drink it again but wouldn't go crazy trying to find it."
"This is not a doppelbock. Call it something else. Javabock? Konabock? I don't care. I'm all for creativity and trying new things. But uh-uh. FtS!"
"D- a little sweet but not to sweet to keep me from enjoying a few. This drank very easily. I wouldn't mind tracking a few more down."
"This beer starts out as being a coffee lovers dream. Strong notes of dark chocolate and espresso with a crisp creamy after taste. I was amazed after half a bottle. Here's the backlash, this beer becomes incredibly boring after a little bit. I honestly felt sick after my second bottle and was completely turned off on dark horse for a while. Perhaps it was a bad batch because it was only 5.99 a 4 pack at whole foods but I really disliked this beer"
"D: It's pretty easy drinking for a different sort of doppelbock. While it's a decent effort for DH brewing a coffee doppelbock, and I'm fond of coffee stouts & porters, I think I still prefer a more traditional beer of this style. I think it's very much worth a try."
"This is very complex and beyond drinkable. Beer and coffee a great combination. To put the roast bean in this style of beer, even better combo."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Interesting pour, leaving a nice layer of yeast in the bottom of the bottle. Very little head. The aroma is certainly unique. Coffee flavored raisins comes to mind, more specifically raisinettes. I'm curious if anyone else has noted this specific aroma before? Allowing time for warming....pause....Taste is coffee (go figure), raisins and chocolate. Interesting, interesting, interesting. Very easy to drink considering the abv and extremely unique experience. Props."
"D: Jury is out. I didn't not like this, but at the same time, it wasn't great either. It went down easy, but I don't think I would drink this on a regular basis. However, it would make a nice breakfast beer..."
"D- Pretty easy to drink nothing I'd drink all the time. A good change of pace."
"Perkulator Coffee Dopplebock may not be Dark Horse's best, but it's an offering that most craft beer lovers should enjoy. Great balance and good drinkability goes a long way. I'm glad that I splurged and bought a sixer."
"The body is a little light for this style, but this is still a very enjoyable brew. I think I will enjoy another after entering this review."
"Flavor is good...but not great. Not the best dopplebocks out there. Mouthfeel and taste fall a little short due to a lighter than normal feel for style...and flavor isn't as sweet and strong as expected. With that said...its still very good! Has a smooth feel and a good amount of yeast and coffee flavors. Carbonation is mild to high...fits the style. The coffee isn't as strong as some say...but there none-the-less. A very good beer from Dark Horse."
"D: Pretty good. I might order another and I might buy again, but not a six pack."
"A really good beer here for Dark Horse, my only complaint is that it is really one-dimensional in my eyes. Pours a dark brown with some woody highlights, smallish, rapidly fading head. Smell is straight espresso and coffee grinds. Taste follows suit... basically straight espresso. It's cool, considering what it is, but it's a little off-putting considering that it's also a beer. If that makes sense. I just want a little complexity in this one. Nice smooth and pillowy mouthfeel and good drinkability. If you're looking for a nice coffee beer this is your guy."
"D - It's a good tasting brew. You could almost substitute a meal with it as it feels so thick or heavy."
"D- A interesting take on a beer. I think Dark Horse knocked it out of the park with this one. A good beer for the coffee drinker to try out."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Pours an amber color that is for the most part clear but boasts a certain hue of color that is somewhere inbetween redish and brown. Continuous amount of bubbles rise to the surface providing support for an offwhite colored head. Initially poured more than a finger thick of big white bubbles that receeded back to a thin layer covering the beer. Aroma of this beer has a mix of roasty coffee and malt/alcohol that almost comes across as being musty. Taste of this beer is...well, a doppelbock. I know it sounds unoriginal and uninspiring but that is it. Nothing immediately strikes outside of the norm other than a noticable amount of alcohol warmth and an aftertaste that includes a bit of the coffee and just a slight bit of the roasted coffee that is reminding me of something musty comes through in the finish of the taste as well. The coffee is a nice little addition to this beer, not an out of control and a dominating amount but just subtle enough to throw a mix into the style. It has a nice amount of alcohol warmth in the finish. Feel of this beer is medium to light. Feel is a little light due to a high amount of carbonation."
"So, not a perfect beer. not the "" best beer "". But, excellenct taste, excellent smell, nice feel. If you like good uncommon, coffee stouts, you really can't go wrong with this one. Not a beer I have to have at all times, but definitally something i'll pick up again. You get exactly what you should expect from this beer. The name say's it all. Really nice beer here."
"D-I think this brew can pretty much hold its own, but I feel like it's lacking something. Propes for creativity with coffee in a dopplebock, though."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a solid burnt toffee scent with a nice roasted malt and coffee aroma. It's dry with some underlying caramel sweetness. The taste is decent as well. I has a dry coffee flavor as well as sweet caramel feel, but there seems to be something wrong here. The flavors don't mix well. The coffee and roasted flavors are incredibly dry, almost musty. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I like the concept here, but the end result is flawed."
"D: I'm a big coffee fan so I find this one very drinkable. Alcohol is basically nonexistent making this a very smooth drinking beer."
"D: An above average coffee beer. I'm not sure if I'm sold on a coffee dopplebock yet. I like my dopples without a roasted, coffee component and prefer them as a malt bomb. It was interesting nontheless. Worth a try, but not worth getting a whole 4-pack."
"D: I wasn't really sure what to expect from this as coffee is not usually something you see in a doppelbock. It worked out fairly nicely though and I'd try this again."
"Some booze comes through in the nose as it warms, and it becomes a bit cloying after a while. This was a bit out of my comfort zone style wise, but I did enjoy it. Don't get this if your looking for a strong coffee beer."
"Pours a dark brown with a reddish tint. Thin cream colored head that fades quickly. Smell is of coffee and malts but really just coffee. The taste is very interesting in that it is very muted upfront, just some light malt, but then whoa here comes the coffee. Much like the nose except it is at the back instead of the front. Though I do love coffee beers, this one feels a bit too one dimensional for me."
"Drinkability is fairly high. This is pretty good overall, even though it's somewhat one-dimensional."
"A very interesting beer - one of the better, if not the best, coffee infused beer I've had."
"D- After two I was done, too much coffee flavor."
"Overall the beer is just to disjointed for me. All coffee and no malt to balance it out. Not what I was looking for in a Dopplebock."
"Overall, this just wasn't my type of beer. It just doesn't compete with a lot of the other coffee beers I have had. I also enjoy doppelbocks and it wrecked that part of the beer as well. So this beer is two 'styles' that I normally enjoy, but not when combined."
"Overall this is definitely a great beer and one that I would drink again in a heartbeat. A bit more body could put this over the hump from very good to outstanding."
"D- This is quite good. Out of the ordinary and thats what drew me to buy it. It goes down smooth, but has an ever so alcoholic warming characteristic that makes this not ideal for sessioning. (but who ever said doppelbocks were for sessioning?)"
"All in all, this is a pretty darn good beer. Try it sometime!"
"Over the past year or so, I've had the opportunity to try a few Dark Horse beers, and they've been impressive. This one's probably my least favorite that I've tried. It's not a bad effort, but it doesn't deliver like I'd hoped. I really think a more prominent coffee flavor might change that. It'd be worth a shot if you ask me. Perkulator's worth a try if you run across, but go for the single bottle rather than the 4-pack."
"Notes: Another expertly crafted beer from Dark Horse, easily one of my favorite breweries."
"You know, in the end, I like this. It's enjoyable. I wish for less coffee, but I'll enjoy my remaining bottles. A good winter drink."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $1.75. Poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears the color of cloudy iced tea with barely a finger of off white foam. No lacing to speak of. Nose and flavors consist of dark brewed coffee, coffee grounds, a bit of alcohol, caramel, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, nuts. Just about medium bodied with decent carbonation and a mild alcohol burn following each sip. Pretty tasty. The coffee is in check, not over the top."
"This is a great drinking coffee brew. This brew works, a great concept of combining the doppelbock and coffee. I hope others take there lead."
"Average drinkability, average beer. Worth trying though if you are in to the whole coffee beer thing."
"D: not as much depth as I was hoping for but kudos for the flavor conglomeration within the style. I have mixed feelings about this one. I probably will not get it again...but you never know"
"Pours a murky brown color with minimal head. Smell is of freshly brewed medium roast coffee, maybe slightly watered down. Excellent taste of medium roasted black coffee with a somewhat nutty background. Slight herbal/floral thing going on in there, kiss of booze noted. Thinner body for the style, good carbonation. Interesting brew, verry good tasting but the lack of complexity and character coupled with the thin body keep it from being top notch."
"The simplest way I can think of to describe the Perkulator is that it's like chewing a dark roast coffee bean or two while sipping a bottled (non-widget) Guiness."
"D - I love coffee beers and this one did not disappoint. You would have to have an affinity for coffee to enjoy this one, as the coffee flavor is big. I could drink this all day, and I think it would be a perfect ""breakfast beer"". I'll have a hard time sharing this with my friends. Delicious!"
"Ruby muddled thin khaki head forms with minimal lacing, another Dark Horse brew with some carbonation issues. Fizzy head dwindles quick as hell. The beer is a coffee infused doppelbock guess what gets overshadowed here, yep the malts from the doppelbock. Pure coffee the nose is does have a deep malty robust caramel nutty edged coffee infusion going on, I like the play on words with the Perkulator and a demon two headed goat sitting on his trone...that's pretty metal boys and girls. Flavor is strong robust nutty coffee with a touch of dark cocoa and sweet underlying fruit again the sweetness is played way down by the deep coffee additions a really roasty brew, you had better like coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slight syrupy texture, carbonation slighly fizzy, and a bit cloying at times for me. Drinkability, much like most of the Dark Horse brewing solid expressive creativity at it's best I enjoyed it for what it was not as a doppelbock, extreme beer at it's best."
"I am a big fan of Dark Horse brewery because they seem to do a lot of really different beers. This beer is no different. The combination of coffee notes and a dopplebock doesn't seem like it'd mix very well, but it really does. The caramel notes form the doppelbock and the coffee notes mix perfectly. The beer is very one dimensional, but it's still very tasty. the nose on the beer is a slight chocolate/coffee note but first and foremost it's a coffee flavour. I like the coffee flavour a lot, and the coffee flavour is very strong, so if you're not a coffee fan, I wouldnt' recommend this beer. Other than that, I really enjoy the beer."
"Future outlook: Hmm....interesting brew that I'm glad to have tried, but probably won't be seeking out again."
"D= interesting beer I guess. Not that great. I haven't read any reviews on it so I'm not sure if other people get peppers but I wasn't expecting it and to say the least its sort of a turn off in the coffee."
"The body is silky and smooth. Light buttery feel left in the mouth. Flavors of sweet caramel malts, with a slight sour note in the middle. Coffee presence is not as bold as I expected. Some light ground coffee flavor, but mild at that. Not sure the age on this beer. Wondering if it wore off a bit? Finishes with a sweet milk chocolate flavor as it warms. Still, this is quite good. I consumed this one no problem and wouldn't mind another. Thanks again for the opportunity, Brian."
"This is a very satisfactory beer. Its got one of the freshest and most flavorful coffee flavors I have ever had in a beer, however that nice flavor comes with a lack of complexity I am used to. This would be an excellent breakfast beer. Well worth seeking out."
"Dark Horse Perkulator Coffee Dopplebock pours a finger of foam over an opaque coffee-colored brew. Carbonation is moderate- and the nose is coffee beans. The flavor is sweet rich malt up front, with notes of molasses and rum, with sharp coffee beans off the back for balance. Mouthfeel is round and full, drying a bit because of the coffee. An interesting approach- there's a green sort of a something in the aftertaste, so I know there's hops in this thing, but the really heavy bittering duties here are carried by the coffee in it. Not for everyone, this might be interesting with a sticky dessert."
"Yum! Really diggin' the nutty smoothness this creates within its coffee buttering. This is a keeper and I will call Perkulator the bigger brother to Furthermores' Oscura."
"D: The best thing about this beer is smelling it and giggling at the Satanic label. I found the taste did not match up with the aroma and was a good beer to drink because I like coffee, but found cannot run with the big coffee beers."
"Holy crap this is a strange one. Pours a dark brown. Even an aggressive pour won't get you a head on this one. It smells like coffee! There are also hints of dark fruit and other things that can't really be deciphered because of the overwhelming coffee aroma. This beer tastes exactly how you would imagine a dopplebock if you dumped a bunch of dark, strong coffe in it. The most dissapointing things about this beer are the lack of head and the thin, watery mouthfeel. The best thing about this beer is the finish. It leaves a very pleasant coffee taste that lingers forever. Although I think coffee is better in a stout or porter, this is interesting and certainly worth trying."
"OK drinkability but not for my personal taste. Kinda a one trick pony IMO."
"D: It's like these guys were swinging for the fences but instead got an infield single. I know you were hoping for a lot more, and it is all anti-climatic, but thanks to a little luck you still came out slightly ahead."
" T- This beer has a soft dry dark roasted malt flavor that quickly gives way to a big cold coffee ground flavor that lingers a bit. M- This beer has a light mouthfeel with a tight little fizzy finish. D- The stale coffee ground dominates the flavor and aroma and is tough to get through a full beer."
"D - This was an interesting take on a doppelbock - I have never heard of a coffee doppelbock, and Dark Horse has yet to steer me wrong. This is definitely worth trying, however I would pick up one of their stouts over this if I had to decide between Dark Horse brews."
"Dark brown that's maple syrup colored around the edges, no head and no lacing. Nice aroma of fresh ground coffee, caramel, and dark fruit. There's a touch of earthiness in the nose, as is light chocolate. Flavor is predominately coffee with more of the sugary caramel in the background. There's a light hop presence that's buried underneath all the malts and coffee, but they're there. There's a light spiciness, and slight warming alcohol on the finish. Body is fantastic on this beer, thick, chewy, tongue-coating, and light carbonation. All in all a good coffee beer."
"D - A tasty beer, but not one I would think of fast when it comes to coffee infused beers. The base beer is tastybut I don't think the coffee really enhances the overall flavor"
"This is an interesting beer, but it's a one trick pony and I quickly lose interest. I'm glad I tried it once but at the same time am glad it was only a 4-pack and not a 6-pack."
"Edit: My caffeine riddled heart actually attempted to jump out of my chest in the middle of the night and throttle me stupid."
"I think it's really comparable to a coffee celebrator."
"d: Docked .5 from here as well. I loved the brew, but it wasn't as good once it was still. Aside from that, this was extremely well done. I need to find some more of these."
"D - Very easy to drink, with no hint of alcohol. It's always nice to find a coffee beer that isn't a stout or porter. I think it works well here, in the absence of roasted grain flavors and esters. I'd pick this up again."
"I could see a coffee junkie pulling this in for the night shift. Not bad, just not my favorite."
"Wow is the first reaction on tatsing thsi beer. I am a coffee lover so the deep, rich taste of a full body coffee shone through on every taste of this beer. It was surprisngly smooth for a Dopplebock but had many subtle taste complexities. The cafeeniene from the cofee could almost be felt. A buddy suggested it was the perfect balnace between a caffeine rush and the soothing nature of beer, I would agree."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is coffee, and hints of malt. Really though it is all coffee. Very pleasant, but very simple. Luckily there is a lot more malt in the taste than there is in the aroma. There is still a ton of coffee though. Maybe too much....yes, too much. Way too much. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this beer has the biggest coffee character of any coffee beer I've yet tasted. Until now I never thought I would think a beer had too much coffee, but this one certainly does. Although I am a huge coffee beer fan I have never been a coffee drinker. This beer is more like drinking coffee to me than drinking a coffee beer."
"Drinkability: I wouldnt have this again. I would recommend this to someone who seeks a strong open of rich coffee and a malty finish despite the off flavor."
"Perkulator looks like caramel liquid and some light brown color and ruby red when up to some light. A quickly fading vanilla cap and no lacing to be seen. Coffee is the main scent and it's big. Not really espresso like just str8 coffee. Under that is a Dopple with some sweet malts and a bit of a roast/burnt thing too. The dopplebock portion of this beer comes out more in taste with caramel malt among others ans some dark fruit with pear. Coffee is not as big as expected from the smell. Goes down smooth with a slightly lighter than medium body with light and effective carb, spot on. Not the most balanced beer but a good attempt. A bit high in ABV for a few but it's not all that high."
"Ho hum. This beer is really nothing very special."
"Review from notes taken on: 11/7/09."
"Excellent!"
"Rich roasty flavor that becomes a bit more prominent as it warms up. Roasted smokey toasted nut with some slight lactic creaminess. Hazlenut, smoked malt, creamy milk chocolate, slight spice character and subtle hops. A bit thin for my liking but not to where is has too much of an affect on the beer. Nice balance of coffee, dark fruit notes and chocolate. The roasted character is not overbearing, which is a nice change of ace, adding complexity and avoiding the one dimensionality of many coffee beers. ABV well masked makng it pretty easy to drink."
"Forget Founders Breakfast Stout, this is the real beer for coffee lovers."
"Very good brew. Wasn't sure how a non-stout-brown coffee beer was going to be, but this might be a better idea given the sweet/balancing act. And not something I'd reach for every day, but if you're in the mood for a coffee beer that's got some balance - reach here."
"If you like coffee, you will love this beer. Coffee is the main component and may be overwhleming for some, so keep that in mind. I really liked this one."
"Good mouthfeel. Pretty smoth, soft carbonation. Some suggestion of alcohol, but not hot or boozy. This is a pretty nice beer here. Interesting twist on a classic style."
"Hazy, slightly reddish cola colored with a light tan head that quickly recedes to a ring of tiny bubbles with dots of lacing. Strong coffee notes in aroma with roasted malt, slightly sweet (caramel-y), no hop presence. Taste is very similar to the nose, a so-so doppelbock with a strong punch of coffee. The bock adds a caramel sweetness that nicely balances out the bitterness of the coffee. The coffee is more of a roasted flavor or anything too intense. Lighter side of medium bodied with strong carbonation results in a very frothy, light body. The addition of coffee to this style isn't doing that much for me. It's nicely balanced but leaves me wanting a good doppelbock or a good coffee stout instead."
"Now this is an interesting beer! The beer was a hazy brown with a white head. The aroma is most definitely of coffee. The taste follows through with an assertive coffee flavor, you almost feel like you're drinking coffee. Then there is a surprising and completely unexpected chocolate note at the end. It had a very interesting mouthfeel, maybe acidic but it definitely left a tingle on the tongue."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable brew. Smooth and quite complex."
"Sam said that he had been sitting on this bottle for a while.. but I doubt age helped or hurt it... Coffee doesn't belong in such a clean brew... I will stand by this.... Thanks Amigo, but this did not do it for me."
"D: Interesting drink. Seems that it would pair well with certain foods and cheese. However, this beer wears on the taste buds as it warms, becoming overly sweet and syrupy."
"overall a pretty interesting beer.worth a shot."
"Dark Horse Perkulator poured a dark brown with a tan head that quickly dissipated. Aroma was coffee. The taste was malty coffee, nothing special. The feel was a little watery to me, with some carbonation to tickle the tongue. This one was an easy drinker."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: While it's not a bad tasting beer, I do wish it was a bit more complex as the coffee is really about all there is to it and the body could hold a bit more substance."
"Drinkability: Not too bad. Tastes pretty nice, but as for match to style, it's not like any doppelbock I've had before. It's missing that bready attribute that seems common to most I've had. Overall a good beer I'm glad I tried."
"A little, dry nicely carbonated very smooth velvety mouthfeel. I'm really liking this beer wish they could have brought out more of the dark fruity"
"drinkability is good. fans of coffee will not find problems with this brew, while those who enjoy coffee flavors only when mixed in with an equal amount of dark malt (this BA) will find it a bit deflating. that beig said, the brew itself does work well."
"Drinkability is fairly high. The alcohol is moderately high, however it's well incorporated into the beer. The flavor profile though not completely acurate, is quite pleasing which makes for an easy drinking and enjoyable experience."
"Pours dark brown with reddish hues. Aroma consists of caramel, roasted coffee, touch of dark fruit, and toffee. The mouthfeel is medium to soft. Roasted coffee flavor with some bitterness from the hops & coffee flavor. Solid malt backbone. Doppelbock characteristics really emerge toward the back when you can taste a rum-soaked raisin fruitiness and caramel."
"Conclusion: This is an enjoyable (and different) take on a coffee beer...pretty nice"
"(D)- If you are a serious coffee drinker (like me), you will absolutely love this beer! I have no idea how long this was aged due to a lack of bottled date, but however long it was aged for made this a spectacular doppelbock !"
"Drinks a tad slow, the heft & coffee presence, a better breakfast beer than a dopple per se; but would happily down a few of these at breakfast!"
"A very nice beer that is a first for me as I was skeptical that a coffee infused doublebock would float my boat."
"An interesting take on the style. I think a sixer would take quite a long time to go through."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with lighter hues of amber along edges and bottom of the glass. 1/6 inch head of a pale tan color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of coffee, roasted malt, and slight yeast cleanliness. Fits the style of an Doppelbock. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation levels and strong bitterness. Tastes strongly of coffee up front, yeast cleanliness comes through next, some sweet malt faintly, and the finish is roasted malt. Once the bitterness pasts the mouth feel is slightly watery. Overall, the coffee flavor is just too strong and overpowers the other characteristics of a Doppelbock."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a hazy dark brown color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is OK, but not much lacing. The aroma is mostly coffee, but I can also smell some caramel malt, chocolate and nuts. Taste is similar to the aroma. Coffee is the strongest taste, but there's also some grain, caramel, raisins and chocolate noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy, and it's also smooth and has a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and it's enjoyable to drink. I think it's a good overall brew, I'd pick this one up again."
"Purchased at Ray's Liquors in Wauwatosa, WI. Pours a very dark brown with a thin, white head that quickly fades to nothing. Metallic coffee aroma with strong coffee flavor from start to finish. Some sweet malt flavor is slightly detectable. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. This is basically a chilled coffee with alcohol. Good thing I like iced coffee, or this would get a worse review. Bonus points for having the most ""metal"" beer label I've ever seen. m/"
" I love Dark Horse."
"Pours a dark woody brown with a thin tan head. The nose has freshly roasted coffee over fruity malts, caramel and spices. Taste has sweet malts, figs, carmelized sugars which are all well balanced by the bitter coffe flavors. Medium body matches style well. Good session beer."
"D: Good. This is a pretty tasty brew, but not too thick or overpowering, especially if you like coffee. I'd have another...."
"A very enjoyable beer. I'm thinking of pairing this with a nice coffeecake. And when I find a recipe for one, I'll do just that. Cheers!"
"An interesting beer but lacking the large malt character typically found in a good Dopple, and the coffee overpowers it a bit as a result."
"D - Rich and malty doppelbock with an interesting coffee component. I'd refrain from a second of this but overall a decent tasting brew."
"Mellows out as it warms to room temp and I'm loosing some of that unique and sharp aroma."
"A good-but sadly, not great doppelbock. I expected more of a coffee kick to the teeth which never came."
"D - Eh, not for me. I'm not gonna slam this one, because it's doing what it is intended to do and all of the flavors and aromas are authentic and well done. I probably wouldn't seek this out again. Oddly, I've never been able to find a coffee beer that I like despite that I drink so much espresso that I bleed black. I love coffee in all of it's incarnations, except beer. And I love beer in all of it's varioius presentations except when its with coffee. What's up with that?"
"Then, I began tasting a more and more sour flavor. It was like sour milk. It wasn't overwhelming, but seriously hurt my overall perception toward the brew. It was a bold and unique offering, just not a great beer."
" I could drink it again but wont go outta my way for it."
"When I picked this up I didn't look that closely at it, I expected to be drinking a strait up Dopplebock. The appearance is similar to tea with very little head. Strait up coffee on the nose with just a bit of fruity maltyness. Flavor is the same, the coffee flavor is slightly burnt, it's almost like chewing a coffee bean and washing it down with sparkling water. The mouthfeel is fairly thin, not too much dopplebock stickiness. I wouldn't call this a session beer, but certainly one that won't slow you down if you're mixing and matching."
"a little put off by appearance, light almost weak coffee appearance, absolutley no head retention, weird. aroma is off the charts fantastic, smells like a bag full of freah coffee beans. taste is spot on coffee as well, the sweet malts of a doppelbock come through in a delicate manner allowing the coffee flavor to shine. the mouthfeel is smooth, not thin like coffee, again the doppelbock. overall a phenomenal collaboration between two of my favorite beverages. would love to get more info on the technical aspects (how to) of this fantastic brew."
"Easy drinking, very enjoyable. Sessionable. Didn't get the coffee, though. Not very complex."
"This is an extremely unique doppelbock and as a big coffee lover, this one really worked well for me. A great beer."
"Overall, this is another good beer from the Dark Horse Brewing. I think it is quite drinkable although it would be hard to have more than 2. I think this is a good addition to the dopplebocks, as it is quite unique and quite good."
"Pours a dark caramel color with a one finger dirty white foamy head. Ample carbonation comes from the beer. Smells like coffee, chocolate and malt. Taste is strongly of coffee (surprise!), caramel and malt. Has a bit of chicory in the aftertaste and not overly sweet like some doppelbocks."
"D- In-your-face taste and (guessing) higher than average abv make this beer good for a couple, but not good for a whole night."
"Admittedly, I do not have much experience in the realm of dopplebocks. The coffee flavor was certainly present, but by no means overwhelming, and I found this to be an odd, yet charming brew overall. However, if you dislike coffee-flavored beers, then this is probably not gonna be your thing. I bought a four-pack out of curiosity, and I'm pleased to say that I would definitely buy it again."
"M/D: Full bodied, bit over carbonated but slightly smooth. Drinkability is OK. A pretty complex beer. More of a sipper than anything."
"However, its creamy smooth mouthfeel is a genuine pleasure, making this hard not to quaff. If purchasers are expecting dopplebock, be forewarned that this is coffee front and center, dopplebock down the road. Yet others might find this a truer representative of dopplebock than I did, and should enjoy it regardless. Good stuff."
"Easy drinker, mouthfeel is a bit thin, but nice. Goes down easy with cookies or chocolate, very good."
"(I had this once before on draught and enjoyed much more.)"
"Notes: this, to me, is a one time beer or special occasion type thing. i dont like coffee enough to sacrifice my beer with the flavor. but overall not bad"
"D: good beer for cold weather, but I'd probably only have one"
"D-Good odd ball beer. For me the combination works nicely...I'd drink it again but it certainly isn't in my Beer Hall of Fame..."
"I only bought a single of this, and I have to say I wouldn't by another one if I had the chance. Dark Horse makes some excellent beers, though this one is definitely not for me."
"Pours out as a slightly hazy brown/amber, with just a faint head. Nose is strong coffee grounds. Taste is acidic malty coffee, with some warming alcohol. A bit abrasive, but not bad. Lots of coffee flavor. Mouthfeel is good. Good brew... not Dark Horse's best, but a pretty unique departure from the typical coffee stout/porter. Nice to see coffee being tried in different styles."
"A pretty dark brown pour with an off white head. Aroma is mostly coffee with a bit of malt and nut. Flavor, is actually not that different than the aroma. There is not much dopplebock in this one. Roasty coffee accented with some toffee and a hint of mocha. Rather lively carbonation. Just the faintest bit of fuit/lager type flavor in the through. It is a bit light, but is very drinkable, and a lot of flavor compared to most beers this drinkable. Certainly unique, this is the type of brew that isn't going to have too many people in between on."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Wonderful balance with a deliberate and well executed coffee backbone. The malt bill is nice because there is some nice dopplebock 'oomph' in there as well. Great original beer from a great forward thinking brewery from my home state."
"D-A coffee lovers D-bock. Really fresh coffee flavour with a well-balnced creamy sweetness. Only the second coffee D-bock I have ever had, Ithaca Beer Company's Kaffinator being the onther. I am a fan!"
"D: I don't know the alcohol level on this one but the coffee flavor would keep me hanging around."
"D - went down fairly easy, but I wouldn't want to drink this all night long."
"Murky looking dark crimson. Thin beige head. Sparse lace. The aroma is thick with coffee. Used coffee grounds. Heavily roasted used coffee grounds. This is thick. The taste is thick with coffee too. If you like coffee, you'll love this beer. It's definitely a coffee beer first, dopplebock second. That's not a bad thing. It's a good beer. But not really a dopplebock in flavor. Lingering bitterness from coffee bean. Alcohol is negligible. Decent attempt at an odd combination."
"Gotta say I really dig this beer and the idea. Bold complex flavors very nutty in nature with huge caramel malt. Complex with a generous amount of espresso with cream, compliments the malts nicely. An twinge of milk chocolate, and toffee. Just a fine beer easy drinking and delicous. Creamy mouthfeel and a finish of great length."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with moderate carbonation."
"Great beer. I love coffee stouts, and this was a good adaptation of that idea, somewhat more drinkable and still delicious. I should start drinking this in the morning!"
"mouthfeel is of a good weight, low carbonation, oily, amazing flavor - yum"
"The mouth is mildly creamy, with a nice smooth finish. The aftertaste of chocolate remains for quite a while and is rather pleasant. Medium body. Very drinkable. If I had to guess the ABV, I'd put it in the 4.5-5% range. Recommended."
"Overall- I was drawn by the idea of a ""Coffee Dopplebock."" I've seen plenty of coffee stouts, but this style was new to me. It's a pretty big departure from most doppelbocks I've tried, but I'm a pretty big fan. It definitely has solid coffee flavor, but isn't so over-the-top that you wouldn't want another."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a dimpled mug. This dopplebock poured a murky, ruby brown hue with a short-lived head of tan foam that settled into a lasting ring. A small amount of slippery lacing was left behind. The aroma had a very pronouced note of cold pressed coffee. A solid dose of caramel and dark fruit also made an appearance. The flavor contained a smooth coffee note (not bitter like alot of other coffee-infused beers), dark fruit skins, caramel, and a hint of baker's chocolate. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and had light carbonation. Filling for sure, but yet quite drinkable. Very enjoyable. Nice to see the guys at Dark Horse give a lager a try."
"D - Drinks like a champ for an 8% dopplebock. The warmth of the alcohol is non-existent. The coffee character wins out in the end, making for an extremely smooth and drinkable dopplebock. One of the highlights of my recent Mid-west excursion."
"Pours a cola and ruby brown with practically no head or foam. Can't see any bubbling in this dark brew. Smells like when you just break open a Folgers tin and take a whiff. Plus the sweet, dark toasted malts and fruits add a little complexity to the nose. The taste starts with undeniable coffee. You then get some of that signature dopplebock malt character. Toasted and sweet with some woody plums. t to metion a toucof smokiness too. Is that from the coffee or malt??? Chewy sweet palate that is complex and different from the norm. A good beer to drink and think, contemplate, and enjoy."
" I like the coffee flavors even if I'm not a big fan of coffee. It works with this style of brew. I'm not a big fan of the finish and that distracts from the overall enjoyment of the brew."
"Overall this one is an interesting take on the style and is recommended to any fan of coffee beers."
"Overall I really liked this and thought it was a rather interesting concept to say the least. I would love to get another actually as it was a welcome change of pace for me and fit in nicely with the German styles I have been trying as of late."
"Another very enjoyable brew from Dark Horse. Initially bought this as a single, will probably grab a four pack tonight or tomorrow."
"Overall, recommended, especially as a one-off purchase. A 4-pack would be sufficient for me."
"Oh, and the artwork is killer, especially the evil version."
"Perkulator is another well made beer by Dark Horse. The flavor is good and it's nice to find a coffee beer where the coffee acts as a compliment to the beer instead of the main component."
"From a 12oz bottle - Pours a clear root beer color with small quickly dissipating head. Below average carbonation. Smells only of coffee and not much else in the nose. First sip is all coffee and more coffee. There is a fairly nice malt backbone. Very nice, very drinkable. Excellent bitter finish."
"D- more of a novelty, i doubt i would want more than one of these in a sitting. a must try for the coffee lovers out there. dark horse wins again."
"refreshing, not over powering."
"D - This is what it is, a beer dominated by coffee. Fun experiment, not exactly one for the purists. I will enjoy the rest of the 4 pack..."
"Thanks to aqsprint for this one."
"Overall: This is a noble experiment and for the most part executed well. However, it seems to rely too much on the coffee to provide bitterness and the end result is a slightly unbalanced brew. Coffee fans should definitely try this but overall I'd rather have a four-pack of Dark Horse's non-caffeinated Doppelbock offering."
"It was nice to see a doppelbock getting in on the coffee action that seems mostly limited to porters and stouts. The malty nature of the doppelbock really complements the coffee flavor and makes it drink like an alcoholic iced coffee - which is both a strength and a weakness, as it makes this brew a little shallow."
"D: While this beer does not seem to match up with traditional doppelbocks in terms of fitting into style guidelines, the beer still tastes and feels great and drinks way, way too easy. I could drink this all night, but then again I am a coffee lover. Could look a bit better though."
"This is very unique. I really enjoyed this beer, and something I would recommend to coffee lovers and those that want something different."
"Perkulator pours a mahogany brown color with some orange/red highlights and a small tan head. The nose and taste share similar notes of bourbon, wet wood, sweet molasses, coffee bean, whiskey malt or corn mash, and very musky, cherry vanilla sweetness. The alcohol content is not threatening. Coffee doesnt come through as bright as had been expected but it plays a critical role in its bitterness and overall texture. Full bodied, this is a large brew great stuff though, very drinkable."
"This is a great coffee beer for it's balance. In my opinion, too many coffee beers are all about the beans, with beer just acting as a prop. Perkulator pairs the smooth malty caramel of a doppelbock with fresh, dark-roasted coffee and I'm loving it. Easy to drink from the not-too-thick (for a doppel) body and delicious. A must-try for fans of coffee beer."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown with not so much a head as a mild fizzing that sticks around on the edges of the glass. Smells of coffee and a malty sweetness and a mild bread-like smell. Taste is malty, chocolaty coffee with the coffee dominating the finish. Notes of cinnamon poke out as the glass warms a bit. The coffee has definitely toned down in the 6 months or so since I purchased it, but I think that is actually an improvement as the other flavors of the beverage are allowed to come forward. Overall, another solid, well-balanced brew from Darkhorse that I could sit and drink all evening and probably will."
"Tastes refined coffee. Clena leaves fresh ground coffee flavor hanging in aftertaste. Caramel with deep searching. Decent sweet to counter the coffee, but pretty one-dimensional. Mild sting from carbonation. Clean lager that avoids off-flavors. Md body with clean alcohol sting. Decent beer, but very simple."
"Overall, not a good coffee beer, and not a good doppelbock."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a deep copper color bock with a small foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of medium coffee notes with a lightly sweet caramel malt base. Taste is also a mix between a lightly sweet caramel malt base with some nice medium notes of dry coffee. Average body with some OK carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not extremely complex but well done and interesting take on the doppelbock style."
"good, balanced beer"
"Thanks, hoppymeal, for the opportunity"
"This is a very interesting combination. Decent doppelbock with just a slight amount of coffee. I'm liking it. Decent mouthfeel."
"Thanks knight84."
"Good carbonation, kind of finishes a little thin for a dopplebock but that doesn't seem to be the problem; it doesn't taste like your typical dopplebock. I like this beer but I wish the coffee could play as just another flavor in the mix and not overwhelm the malt."
"Pours dark maroon with a large medium sized beige head. Smell is of sweet maltiness and nice strong coffee. Taste is about what I'd expect from the name. Rich and malty as expected from a dopplebock with a nice coffee flavor as well. Finishes more malty with little coffee flavor at the end. Pretty nice and drinkable. Medium to slightly rich body with good carbonation. Fairly noticeable tartness in the finish that detracted somewhat."
"Drinkability- Yet again Dark Horse blows me away. My main man tpd975 was right when he sang the praises of this brewery. This is a great brew if you like coffee but if you don't, it probably won't be your favorite. The aftertaste can be slightly sweet but that is about the only negative. Big thanks again to Derek!"
"Pours a dark amber with a fluffy one finger light khaki colored head that takes its time to die down. A small layer of foam sticks to the sides. Bubbles rising to the top throughout the entire tasting. Smell is coffee grinds and bitter chocolate up front. Sweet caramel malt underneath with a woody scent as well. Alcohol is present, but not over the top. Very enjoyable in the nose, I could whiff this all day (and morning). Slight bitterness on the first sip with a big coffee backbone. I was hoping for more sweet caramel malt, but the coffee flavor all over the tongue. Some smokey wood flavors and a bit of molasses in the aftertaste. Medium grainy body with a good amount of carbonation. Not as creamy as I'd like with the style, but I'll take it. Interesting twist on the doppelbock, not sure I like it though. Definitely give this a try if you love your mornin' cup-a-joe, if not, I wouldn't go out of your way getting your hands on it."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a good steady carbonation. Goes down fairly easy but it doesn't have the chewiness I was somewhat expecting. Overall, an interesting experiment of a beer, but nothing really ends up drawing me in. As far as coffee beers goes it's not my cup of tea."
"Thanks to emerge077"
"The bottom line: Dark Horse has done a decent job pairing up the classic doppelbock flavour with java. I would personally prefer the full-on malts of a pure doppelbock, or the aggressive coffee flavour of a stout or coffee tinted porter personally, but you can do worse."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange/brown, thin off white head forms, settles down to a thin ring and layer, no lace. Smell is caramel, coffee beans, roast, sweet fruits, chocolate, some alcohol, not bad. Taste is similar, alcohol bite, chocolate, nice raw espresso roast, very intense, some cherries, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, some warmth. Wasn't a big fan of the body, but a solid beer."
"Drinkability: True, I was more than a bit wary of this combination, but it turned out alright."
"Mouthfeel is medium boded, semi-sweet up front, with a dry, roasty java finish."
"D: Extremely nice. I loved the mixture of coffee and doppelbock. Leave it to Dark Horse!"
"Overall a nicely executed novel approach to a coffee beer. Others typically infuse coffee into stouts or maybe porters, but it works with a doppelbock as well."
"Pours a nice clear dark amber color with a vibrant white head that leaves some sturdy lacing that goes away as the beer warms. The smell is dominated by roasted coffee and some caramel sweetness. The taste is mildly sweet with some prominent coffee flavor and bit of fruitiness. The mouthfeel is nice and syrupy, which suits this style well. I really like this beer, especially for the price. The sweetness lends itself well as an after dinner drink - an easy slow sipper here. Recommended."
"I'm praying for an imperialized/super-sized version someday in the future. Nice creative execution guys, well done..."
"Rich & roasty. Malty caramel, earthy, coffee. Medium-full bodied, very smooth. Despite the coffee flavour, it does not drink anything like a big stout."
"This is an interesting and unusual beer. I thought the nose was unbalanced with coffee but the flavor is balanced; and is both interesting and subtle. I have no idea what the ABV may be, but I suspect that there is a high ABV that is well hidden. Go out and get this tasty treat."
"D- A very interesting beer for a doppelbock. I did not find this to be overly rich or anything. Worth checking out."
"Overall, this is an above average coffee beer and a mediocre bock; though, I'm glad Dark Horse went for this experiment and eschewed the porters/stouts-only path for its java brew--there's great potential still with this combination."
"I give credit to Dark Horse for their willingness to experiment, but this one just didn't work out."
"Glad to see this on-tap at Ashley's. Very intriguing. Caramelly brown sugar bronze body with a small, off-white head that sticks around. Smells like a ""coffee doppelbock"" should: fresh coffee grounds mixed with sweet stewed fruits, caramel, brown sugar, and cookie dough. Taste is similar with a front load of acidic roasted, nutty coffee bitterness, but just enough--not too much. Sweet, doppelbocky malts come in right away. Sweet fruits, caramel, and cookie dough before a vegetal hop and coffee finish. Medium-full body with a syrupy feel. Interesting concept and it works pretty well."
"drinkability: good"
"On tap at Cole's in Buffalo,came to the table in a standard pint glass a deep clear mahogany brown with a thinner slight off white head,the coffee is light in the nose with hints of brown sugar and molasses.Well rounded flavors starting with a little molasses-like sweetness and sweet dough the coffee is reserved a big leafy presence wich isnt found in many of the style comes through late.Its a coffee dopplebock but the coffee isnt overdone its nice and its very drinkable for the style no doubt."
