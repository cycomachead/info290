Just enough earthy, subtle hops to keep the beer honest. Soft (very), clean bitterness. Alcohol adds a drying effect (in the finish) to a sweet beer, another aspect that keeps the beer honest. Slight cereal graininess noted in the finish. Lager finish is apparent in the first few sips, but dissipates as the rest of this big beer takes over. Slight warming effect as the beer is quaffed, welcomed. Syrupy body with soft carbonation. Complex yet balanced brew. Serve at appropriate temp for best impression. Served mine slightly chilled, slightly astringent. Much better as the beer warmed (as all big beers do.) I definitely will by again.

Needless to say this 3 year old one was damn near perfection. Way better when you drink it at the recommended temperature so let it get there before consuming.. I have to try a fresh one to compare but this made my pallet go crazy. Alcohol was non bullying and complimented the balance between the bitterness and sweetness. I'm sooo surprised that this beer still remains perfectly hop balanced even 3 years in.

4.05,0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Well, it's a malt bomb alright. Smells and tastes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, and plum pudding with extra bits of red port-soaked bread on the side. Actually, the flavor has a slightly higher level of breadiness and dark fruit emphasis than the nose does, and the nose has a slightly higher level of booziness than the flavor actually presents to the tongue. I can only find a faint garnish of earthy and herbal hopping on the back side of the finish, and even than only once the glass has warmed up. My token constructive criticism would be to amplify the noble hops slightly to temper down the sweet malts a bit, and allow some nutty malt tones to shine through. Still, this beer ranks up there amongst the top 15 doppelbocks I've had...so it's certainly worth trying.","WastingFreetime","Sep 07, 2012"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2010 release. Pours hazy reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big raisin, prune, biscuit, toast, molasses, toffee, caramel, nuttiness, earth, light roasted malt, and herbal. Very nice and well balanced doppelbock aromas with good complexity. Taste of big raisin, molasses, prune, toffee, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, earth, light roasted malt, and herbal spiciness. Light spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, toffee, toast, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, roasted malt, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor complexity and balance. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a moderate warming after the finish. This was very easy to sip on when I opened it, and it gained a bit more heat as it warmed up. Overall this is a damn nice doppelbock. Nice flavor balance and complexity; and pretty smooth to sip on. Got a little bit boozy as it warmed up, but was still a highly enjoyable brew.","superspak","Jul 21, 2012"

Poured fairly aggressive and got a huge 3 inch fluffy white head that, doesn't settle quick at all, lots of lacing. Color when held up to light, very bright ruby red. Smell is dark fruits raisins, fig, brown sugar, and a breadyness. Taste is all of that with raisins, fig, and hard candy flavor dominant. Even after a year booze is present. Mouth feel is large, nice amount of life for the abv and age. Would be lying if I called it overly drinkable, a sipper for sure.

There is an acidic bite in the finish that doesn't fit in the style, nor with the flavors, nor the mouthfeel. Malt flavor is honey with a dash of chocolate, nougat, and caramel. Hop flavor is earthy, but not quite noble...perhaps a variant of tettnanger, but not tettnanger itself. Alcohol intensity matches the style and works well with the honey flavor. Hop bitter is mild and grassy. The finish dries from alcohol and leaves lingering hop flavor into the aftertaste. Too strong carbonation and light in the mouth.","mentor","Nov 04, 2011"

Pours a translucent plum with a dense, creamy, tan-colored head embedded with tiny craters. Head eventually settles into a consistent, quarter inch cap. Thick swaths of lacing coat the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose reveals candied dark fruits (figs and prunes), followed by toffee notes and a trace of cocoa. Taste consistent with nose; however, the flavors are less distinct and coalesce much more in the flavor profile. The chocolate character is also much more robust. Finally, there's also a residual alcohol presence that comes out towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation. Texture is somewhere between oily and creamy and there's a little alcohol heat at the back end which lingers at the back of the throat.

Amber red color with a mixed reddish orange hue at the glass bottom, the liquid is clear and transparent, perhaps in large part due to standing up the bottle for some time, you can see a good quarter inch of sediment in the bottle bottom. The nose has both alcoholic fumes and a syrupy, clingy texture to it, raw brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup and dark chocolate, maraschino cherries to plum, rum raisin, baker's dough, sufficient pine and flower accents to signal the hops in the background, same for the spiced orange peel. Medium-bodied, the carbonation moves from active to sluggish with no clear pattern. The sweetness is concentrated in molasses, cane sugar and cocoa. The raisin, plum, cherry, apricot fruit seems front-loaded and releases into tart white grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus during the mid-palate. The dough more fully baked here, pie crust and muffin. Pine, grass gains clarity of voice here. Fluid progression through the mouth, the alcohol more heady than burning. Seems like a beer best had with dessert, something like flan or pudding.","farrago","Jan 14, 2011"

This and the Baltic Porter from 2009 were only six bucks, I was sold. This one pours an impressive deep amber mahogany brown hue completed clouded with some yeast sediment. Nice huge collar of tan khaki head goig on with fine intricate layers of lacing, this bottle was bottled in 2010 probably earlier this year in the spring. Aroma has some big malt layers deep with tart fruit and hints of raisin, a nice depth of ingredients involved in the brewing process. Also some floral fruity notes in the back end quite the interesting New England brewed German style lager. Flavor really coats the palate with back end roasted malt and upfront fruitiness. Figs/plums/raisins soaked in alcohol with a nice crusted bread layer finishes somewhat balanced with a strong herbal hop finish. A touch of dark chocolate and other roasted malt qualities brings a nice balance to the overall mix. As it warms herbal mint with a touch of pine cone comes out, the hops here definitely have an American slant but they're note overdone. Mouthfeel is as full bodied as a lager will ever be, almost chewy due to loads of malts and bready yeast sediment bringing a nice body. Carbonation was natural bottle conditioned very enjoyable experience. Drinkability, I had no problems finishing and enjoying a whole bomber although ideally you better find a drinking partner on a big beer like this. Great quality version of a rarely brewed in America style.","WVbeergeek","Dec 24, 2010"

The flavor is also very malty, with big caramel and toffee notes, along with turbinado sugar, vanilla, oak, dark fruits (plum, fig, cherry), along with some herbal hops and fusel alcohol.

Caramel, toffee, and something akin to syrup are mixed into the somewhat heavy body for sweetness. Good ripe fruit tastes in there as well as I'm picking up something like pear or sour grape/cherry - comes in on backend and works for balance and gives a illuminating backbite.

The roasted malt and meat flavors come in towards the end and finishes with an earthy hop bitterness. The feel is big, thick, and chewy. It is a bit sticky from the sweetness but enough carbonation to keep it from becoming syrupy. Some alcohol belly burn action as well. A nice malty dopplebock for sure.

Velvety smooth body as it crosses the palate. The flavor brings forth a big malt component, sweet, but not too sweet, with caramel and a hint of nutty character and ghostly mocha.

The flavors are a bit on the simple side, but I still liked the caramel chocolate flavor quite a bit. Initially I picked up a bit of astringency in the finish, but over time that blew off and the beer became very smooth on the palate.

Its a bit raiseny, roasted malt, etc, standard doppelbock. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet and caramel-like in flavor. It is sort of a dry sweetness though, which migh be more about the mouth than flavor. The way a dry wine has that dry feeling there is a bit of that here. Aftertaste is a bit floral, the only time any hints of hop are detectable. Mouth is very crisp and carbonated with medium body (and aforementioned dryness).

It poured a nut brown with a big off-white head which faded, leaving next-to-no lacing. Smelled very malty, with aromas of stewed fruit and alcohol. The malts also dominated the flavor, but pleasantly. Some chocolate and caramel unfold on the palate and the reported 9.6% is warming.

The aroma consists of toasted, caramel, molasses, grainy, and perhaps Belgian malts, balanced with grassy/spicy hops and a nice fruitiness. On the palate, it is complex as all hell. It starts with sweet, caramel, toasted, molasses, and lightly roasted malts; next there's all the fruity byproducts (pear?, apple?, cherry?, raspberry?, melon rind?) which are followed closely by green/perfumy/spicy Noble hops that contribute a medium bitterness (42 IBUs), and it finishes with a Belgian yeastiness and a dash of what seems to be Chrismas spices (anise, nutmeg, cinnamon) although I'm not sure that they're even in the beer. The body is syrupy and almost thick, with tingly/numbing carbonation that shortly evens out, becoming very smooth, leaving a medium finish. I have mixed feelings about this beer - I'm not sure that it tastes too much like an authentic dopplebock due to the Belgian fruitiness and yeastiness. That said, it is a very well-made brew which I enjoyed more than my numbers would suggest; and even though I'm not sure of it's being a dopple, I'm not really sure how else to classify it.

Again, dark malts are what stick out in the initial taste, but also a pervasive carbonation which makes you thin it in your mouth a bit before swallowing. Because of the size of the malts is hard to discern any kind of specialty grains that are added, but I'm sure they're in there. The lingering taste is strong as well with a mostly sweet and almost chocolaty flavor. Overall a terrific beer, would recommend to anyone.","Toddv29424","Apr 26, 2007"

Good head retention and lacing down the glass. Smell consists of strong malt flavors and some mild hint of hops. It certainly has a sweet caramel tone from the malt. There are also some subtle roasted notes. Taste is smooth and malty. Certainly has that slight caramel sweet malt flavor. There is a definite hop presence in the finish. It leaves a good bitter taste on the back of the tongue. Good overall drinkablity and mouth feel. I enjoyed this one and would certainly try to find it again.","bigone4","Apr 18, 2007"

At first it tasted very traditional, but as it warmed a greater hops bitterness and chocolate flavor came out, almost making me think it was a lager version of an imperial stout. The big hops are a little odd with the lager style, maybe just different from what I'm used to, but still tasty and drinkable, no hint of booze.","tempest","Apr 15, 2007"

Theres a hint of ethanol as well, but other than that, its a clean aroma. The taste is phenomenal. The flavors are rich, many-layered, and enormous. Malty, sweet, and warming. Theres a dark bread and chocolate quality to the flavor. Its a little harsh compared to traditional doppelbocks, but is extremely satisfying and fulfilling. The body is massive and engaging.

Big malt flavor which makes this brew extremely smooth, but also has the perfect amount of hops to balance itself out. The taste of coffee/caramel comes to mind with a hint of chocolate.

It's not a huge aroma or a particularly exquisite one, but it is true to style and very good. On the palate, this lives up to the "big beer" label, with a huge blast of thick, bready malt flavors coming out first, followed by a brisk bitter/sweet combo to the mid-palate and a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is thick and fairly alcoholic, with a bit of an acidic kick as well. Mouth-filling carbonation also contributes to a sense of fullness.

Malt was present throughout, with notes of bread crust, and the finish had a burst of alcohol flavour. Fairly warming, the texture was very creamy, medium/full body with moderate carbonation.

The taste is very fruity, reminiscent of overripe fruit...think about crushing a soft plum against the roof of your mouth with your tongue. Holding up the fruitiness is a very strong maltiness. The fruitiness imparts a sweetness but it never approaches cloying, even with the absence of any noticeable hoppiness. Unfortunately it seems fairly hot, the alcohol is not hidden very well. This is especially apparent in the finish when it becomes the primary component of the taste. It leaves you with the same feeling you get after taking a sip of hard liquor.

The bigness reins things in a bit, making it one to be sipped and enjoyed slowly, in increments rather than in quantities. The ABV is never out of the picture, and it warms cozily as well as lightens the atmosphere.

I know this style can range in color but I just expect more brown than reddish. It leaves a small off white head that kind of lingers with the brew. The smell of this beer seems off to me, more of a grape sour smell comes out which throws me off a bit. As I continue to smell this beer more candied darker fruit begins to rise from the depths which now intrigues me. The taste is malty with a nice balance of hops to counteract that sweetness on the palate. Caramel starts off on your palate with medium carbonation followed quickly by a sharp herbal bitterness and finishes with some what mellow nutmeg spice characters. Overall this isn't the best beer from Smuttynose but decent.","Franchise","Jan 08, 2006"

The taste is a rich maltiness, with a nice amount of darker malts, and a nice balance of hops, backing up the malts. I taste a hint of nuttiness, and just a bit of alcohol is evident.

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"The S'muttonator delivers a fairly clear (it's bottle-conditioned), reddish-chestnut body beneath a short cap of creamy light-tan foam. The head retention is fair, and it leaves a decent amount of splotchy lace at the outset of the glass. The nose is sweetish, lightly toasty, caramelish, and even a touch fruity from the Vienna malts. It's mildly zesty on the tongue with a very fine-bubbled and natural carbonation, and a medium-full body that's smoothly dextrinous. Rich, toasty, "juicy", sweet, molasses and prune-like, and subtly husky malts dominate the flavor; laced with floral and spicy hop flavors as well as a quick, sharp slap of alcohol. The bitterness is more than firm enough, however, to reign it in and keep it from becoming cloying. The occassional caress of alcohol appears to "warm" in the finish (9.8% is a touch high... Paulaner's Salvator is only 7.5%), but other than that it's very clean, superbly balanced, and exceptionally well-done. It's very nice indeed with the exception that it is a little over-the-top as far as alcohol content is concerned. Worth trying...","NeroFiddled","Apr 26, 2005"

It had a fairly robust off white head that consisted of very small/fine bubbles and broke down quite rapidly. The lacing from this brew was somewhat limited. The aromas from this brew seem to be mostly malts with highlights of caramel and roasted scents. Also you are able to pick up a strong scent of alcohol mixed in with what seems to be dark fruity like smells. It is a nice smelling brew though the alcohol might be a little to pronounced. The flavors of this brew are dominated by thick almost chewy malt feel that are somewhat sweet, reminds me of brown sugar and caramel. Has an alcohol like flavor that seems to be spicy in the back of the mouth, not able to pick up much in the way of hops.

Aroma is lots of heavy malt sweetness, with alcohol notes apparent. Taste follows the aroma, but the alcohol becomes even more prominant, over the tongue and especially in the aftertaste. Almost seems the grains could be a bit more hearty here, but that's kind of nitpicking... Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great for the style, with the drinkability limited somewhat just by the alcohol presence and it's being out on display for all to see.
