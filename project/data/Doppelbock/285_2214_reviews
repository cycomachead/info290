"O:  I haven't had Samichlaus from them, but this is a decent start, which it probably was from them."

"Like the Sammichlaus Classic, too sweet. Purchased in Villach at a Eurospar."

"Taste / Palate: All the sweet notes from the aroma come though in the flavor plus a note of cherry almond ring coffee cake and the mellow glow of a warming 9.6% abv. The feel is slick and smooth as there is very little carbonation. It’s like drinking liquid candy."
""
"This Austrian Doppelbock pours a clear, antique, gold with a tall white head that quickly vanishes leaving some moderate lacing on the glass. The smell is vaguely sherry like with little in the way of complexity. The same goes for the flavor, which, while pleasant enough, has no character from either the hops or malt. It's a sweet, very strong beer, no more or less. Medium body, sticky."

"Overall: tasty, and drinkable enough for its strength. It doesn't have enough interesting character to be truly outstanding, but it's a well-enough wrought beer."

"I usually don’t like very sweet malty beers, but this is actually a pleasant sipper. Last time I had it was almost 2 years ago, this was felt much better, and probably was not the beer that changed..."

"O: Not overly complex but still delicious and I can't believe all the low ratings."
"Pours a deep golden color with good clarity and fat creamy off white head that stays and stays. Nose is strong with malt richness and depth. Like ribbons of scent from malt but nothing burnt or roasted. Just sweet. No hops on the nose but a nice light fruitiness. Sheeting lace that slides back into the ring and alcohol legs. Some grape like sweetness. A bit of sweet chocolate comes forward shyly as it warms. The fruit on the nose is a mere grapey sweetness. Light and bright. Taste is heavenly delight. Rich sweet malt unfolds on the palate. Light chocolate, clean tastes and a grape like sweetness that includes a bit of sweet raisin type depth. Toasty but nothing burnt. No hop flavor until the very end where it finishes with a timid bitter and a little more of that chocolate to linger in the aftertaste. Medium full body, smooth and wonderful."
"A strange one to call: nothing bad at all, but I'll never have another one."
"Overall: Solid sugar bomb, but not my cup of tea. I didn't find this type of sugar particularly tasteful. But definitely worth a try."

"A ""pale doppelbock"" described as the cognac of the beer world on the label. It is indeed pale, a bright sparkly lemon drop yellow with around three inches of white foam. Aroma is intensely sweet and bready, with ample lager yeast character and green grape must. Palate does indeed evoke cognac a little but is of course much sweeter. Tastes of golden cake with icing, apples, a poppy seed nuttiness, and dried plums, esters and phenols abound with a pervasive mustiness that recalls white wine. Hops provide some additional fruit notes like gooseberry and some bitterness to the finish, which is more crisp, dry, and spicy than the initial sweetness would suggest. Boozy like many Belgian tripels and some of the other flavors go down this path as well, although this lager beer is much sweeter than the more attenuated Belgian ale. I like darker flavors in this style but this is worth sampling."

"Very good. Drinkable, not a kick in the teeth in any area. I like the balance in this one."

"A nice gold color. Not much head, but there was some active carbonation. A nice fruit like smell, citrus fruit with a hint of sweetness. I can't really describe the taste other than I liked it. The beer had a thick texture like cream. I felt a little alcohol warmth."

"O nice beer for food pairing, definitely a slow sipper"
"O - If you do not like hops, you will probably like this beer. Hell, it's almost like an English barleywine."
""
""

"I REALLY like Samichlaus, their Christmas beer. Of course, it is always available at our local Total Wine & More. I'm sad this brewery is done. I bet they make a few more huh ABV beers that are just loaded with sweetness. This bottle is well done. If you like beer that are sweet and hide the booze, grab a bottle. Not sure it's worth $5.99… but man, this is tasty. Cheers!"
""
""
"O- Pretty good stuff, an interesting take on Doppelbocks."
"overall, eh... nice abv. i'm buzzed after this and the 12% bomber.... taste is just okay; overall is just okay. note (again) the high marks for SMELL . . . . but this is not what I consider in the same class as a spaten optimator or celebrator or most of the other doppels..."
""

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"O: This beer has a ton of complex flavor and aroma and enough alcohol to make it interesting."

"Easy drinking as an aperitif after four years in the cellar. While not quite to style, this one is very enjoyable and more similar to a tripple."
""
""
"O - picked this up since I am a big Samichlaus fan, but this one left me wanting. a unique beer, but not sure if it fits the style so rated a bit lower due to that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is lots of fruit, raisiny bread crust, lemony herbal bitterness, hints of spice. It's creamy but lively, not too oily or thick. It is sweet but not too sweet with nice, engaging zesty bitternes to round it out."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy khaki bone colored that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but fairly strong."
""
"Overall, not a classic Doppelbock of German/Austrian descent. Having a look at the website, especially the strong beer variants, including this one, seem to be designed for exporting. It's a beer for a cold evening, to be savored in small sips."
"11.2 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a good 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some small bits of spotty lacing cling to the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, apple, raisin, grape, nuttiness, honey, toffee, herbal, and earth. Pleasant and well balanced aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, raisin, apple, honey, bready grain, nuttiness, herbal spiciness, earth, and light phenolic flavors. Lingering notes of light fruits, toast, biscuit, caramel, toffee, nuttiness, earth, herbal, and phenolic fruitiness. Some good balance of flavors but the phenolic character throws it off a bit; definitely smoother tasting with tiny sips. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good pale doppelbock. It has good complexity and flavor balance, despite the estery qualities that were present. An enjoyable sipper."
""
""
""
"Overall, again, the beer is not a doppelbock to me. If it were in a different category, it would be so much better rated on this site."
""
"Body is medium-heavy to heavy with a modest carbonation that makes sipping this big beer appropriate and easy to do - there's no rush to gulp. The dry finish furthers this, each sip proves satisfying and cleanly dry on the palate."
""
"Pours a clear, light to medium orange amber. Slight head and no lacing. Sweet malt and fruit aroma. Honey sweetness, malt and light hops. Sweet malt and light floral and light hop finish. A bit too sweet and not all that well integrated, but still a pleasant bock."
""
"enjoying this in a san miguel snifter with etching on bottom. leaving nice popping alcoholy feeling in the back of my throat makes the fine golden nectar go down easy. no bitterness, but malty goodness. there is no fruit that i can detect maybe a prune or two, but barely."
""
""
""
"Quite a pleasant doppelbock, different than others I've tried."
""
"O - Overall, this turned out to be very impressive, more so than their Samichlaus. The 3 years of ageing (neglecting the expiry date) have really added a nice touch to the beer and transformed the mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - disappointing. I made some really good finds in that bar basement sell-off this was not one of them."
""
"Overall; Austria's Duvel if you will...it's bright in color, fairly strong carbonation, decent balance, abv is well hidden, and itdefinitely gets the job done!"
""
"O - a decent enough beer but the flavours are a little strange and really don't work as a doppelbock, and the alcohol stands out a little too much"
"Overall a very strange take on the style with an excess of sweetness that I enjoy but not very much of a rum raisin bread that I would expect. Still it wasn't bad."
"Sadly, was forced to pour the last 4 oz or so out and immediately open and crush a can of Avery IPA. It took over half of the can to get the cloying sweetness out of my mouth. Ack."
"O: This is the first ""pale double bock"" that I have ever tried, and I liked it. Very different and interesting. Despite how smooth the beer is, the sweetness and alcohol finish of this beer may turn off some people."
"Overall: A big beer, with mild flavors but the force is strong with this one. Alcohol reigns supreme. Consider my night, capped."
"O - A great choice for a snifter worthy warmer."
"Light body, but surprisingly thick for the appearance. Not a horrible beer, but it seems like a weird high-powered mix of a bock and pale Euro lager. Euro malt liquor, maybe?"
"Yikes. Castles and counts, blah, blah blah. The big ABV is just barely integrated, and we're thus given a bit of breathing room beyond the sweet grainy malt. That said, the near 10 full points of booze are somehow easy to sup away at, once you become acclimatized. Worth it, if your goal is getting all warm and toasty, without actually gagging on the low rent brewer having cut too many a corner."
"Not the best offering from this brewer(mind you I've only tried Samiclaus) but at 3 bucks a bottle I had little to lose"
"Somewhat palatable in small doses, this walks that fine line between crafted beer and malt liquor. It strikes me as a Bock that would be very well balanced at a lower abv%, while the alcohol seems to dominate and throw things off as it is now. I change my assessment of this being a sexed up Maibock, it's more of a rocket-fueled Maibock."
"O: Just so-so, sadly. There are better, cheaper doppelbocks around, though this is certainly not bad, especially if you want something boozy."
"O - Nice powefull beer that is a littel boozy but does not detract from its powerfull flavours."
"Had a bottle of this in November of 2007. I believe this was one of the first Doppelbocks I ever had. With that being said I was totally unprepaired for the impact this beer would have on my tastebuds. This beer smelled very sweet, infact I was really happy about that. The color was like burnt caremel with some yellow around the sides. For me the flavors in this beer were really strong at the time that I had it. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to finish. I sucked it up and did, but had mixed emotions about his beer. I haven't had it since and really should revisit this brew again. It's worth trying again."
"In a way Urbock 23 is sort of like a lighter, cheaper (but by no means cheap) Samichlaus. It doesn't have the same over-the-top intensity of Samichlaus, but it hits like a train both in its flavor and its alcohol content nonetheless. An excellent beer, but at $17 for four it's seriously expensive. Highly recommended."
"The alcohol is reasonable hidden. I am taking a few home!"
"B'ham UK March 2011"
"D- Complex flavors, but a sipper. Oak and booze too much. Definite sipper."
"Drink is meh, pretty heavy drinking, big body, some warming and tingly booze, and the sharp contrast in flavors from sweet syrupy wheat wine to bitter spicy pale hop flavors seems to play not so well."
"In fact, it reminds me of mead!"
"The palate opens with a blend of hops and alcohol. Floral honey, cotton candy, light lemon and earthiness are all present. Staggeringly drier than I remember it being, the sweetness actually isn't all that high! The combination of hops and alcohol is unique, and the malt character is moderate, and in its simplicity, like a drier maibock. The yeast isn't particularly expressive, I don't get much yeast flavor here. Despite the relatively high FG (1.020), this is still fairly dry. Moderately brash, this still works. Medium in body with carbonation that's a little higher than it needs to be, this beer is dry and hoppy on the finish with some cotton candy. A failure as a doppelbock, this is still quite an excellent beverage."
"Tastes like sweet bread and Caramel. Really clean taste that's crisp and clean. Not that complex, but a good taste. I am not sure how old this bottle is, because I can't taste the booze at all. It might be aged and mellowed. Enjoyable beer for somebody who normally doesn't drink lagers. "
"It is a great beer from an outstanding brewery."
"(D) High ABV and lacking flavor makes this one a tough one to drink. For the label calling it the ""Congac of Beers""... Not Impressed."
"Pours a light golden body with good head and a strong aroma that has some booziness to it, as well as dark fruits(?) and some sweetness. For a dopplebock it doesn't seem as heavy or boozy as others (which is both good and bad). The lighter body is crisp with some hoppiness and a slight sticky sweetness. Can't pinpoint sweetness, but it's something like caramel and for some reason I pick something like raisins or figs. Finishes slightly dry w/ the alcohol finally making itself known. A quality sipper, won't be confused w/ the more maltier dopplebocks when it comes to a heavy malt presence but still a good tasting brew worth trying."
"D: The alcohol is masked to some degree so it doesn't quite taste like 9.6% and isn't as difficult to drink as one would expect."
"An elegant, clean and well crafted doppelbock. Perhaps a bit too clean?"
"Overall I agree with others in that this isn't all that close to a doppelbock. It's more of a maibock but the ABV is too high to support that kind of flavor profile."
"D-the taste stays but it becomes more and more undesirable as you drink it, you could drink this beer and then five different beers after it but you will never get the taste of this out of your mouth. ABV hits quickly."
"D - Highly drinkable due to the smooth nature of this brew. Prost!"
"D: A fantastic strong lager beer. Samichlaus light perhaps, but it has the flavour profile and intensity to hang with that beer. A nightcap beer for sure, a must try."
"D: The booziness to this one really hurts the drinkability. Almost makes me think I'm chugging a mixed drink. Not my favorite."
"This brew tastes fairly decent, though there is still too much of an alcohol presence. The beer is surprisingly thin, with some mild heat in the finish. Urbock 23° has a slightly odd or off kilter flavor. Overall, it's pretty drinkable, but also a tad unusual. I found this to be a pretty mediocre beer."
"Overall an uncomplicated and average beer that's a bit more of a golden or maibock. If you love dopplebocks its worth having at least once. I can see why some people are put off by it, though, especially if you are into complex Belgian beers. Nothing really blew me away. I wouldn't pay the cost again for this beer given the high price it has in the USA."
"Its sweet but oddly thin. Its very very thin. Mild ethanol on the front palate and lots of sweetness in the mid to forward palate. The beer finishes oddly bitter. Its smooth and drinkable but its not my favorite doppelbock, not by a long shot. Its a good beer and I would recommend it because of the brewery alone. I would drink it again but if I had a choice between this and another doppelbock I would likely try the other."
"d - A decent dopplebock. Some nice smooth malts and a little bit of fruit. Would try again."
"Slightly complex, big full bodied , long-lagered beer that any beer drinker has to appreciate."
"D: Sweetness and heavier body makes this more of a sipper."
"D- A rich warm bock that hides its alchohol well with lots of rich malt quality. A touch slick on the mouthfeel lets if down, not as clean as it should be, but certainly very enjoyable."
"It's amusing that this calls itself the cognac of beers, when it doesn't have nearly the power, complexity or pleasant flavour of a good brandy. All it has is a distinct alcohol finish. Not a pleasant drop, I really have very, very little respect for the Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg, they are all talk and no substance. This is an insult to other doppelbocks."
"Undrinkable. This smacks of brewing apathy, and comes across as cheap hot piss to get you wasted quickly. The similarities between it and, say, Jordanian 10% rocket fuel are striking. Please let me not finish it."
"Pours to a clear amber/copper color. The aroma is sweet and alcoholic almost like a fine wine. The mouthfeel is a little dry, but I tend to like beers like that. There is a sweet flavor with bits of caramel and the alcohol is a bit overwhelming to the other flavors. There is also an oak undertone possibly from the barrels."
"D - although the higher abv is detectable, it is still fairly easy to drink"
"Drinkability runs high, I could enjoy two or three of these!"
"O: Good drinkability despite the high ABV. I was expecting much less from this beer, good surprise"
"D: Enough complexity to try this one again. Pretty smooth for a 9.60% ABV, so a few of these and you'd be on the floor if you're not careful."
"D: With such a high ABV, more than one of these can spell trouble. Even so, the ABV is hidden so well, it could definitely be sneaky. Otherwise, it's a nice alternative to a traditional doppelbock for those who like that style and want to try something a bit different."
"Not a fan of this one... I love the style but I find with doppelbocks, you have the elites and everything else doesn't measure up and this one falls in the 2nd category..."
"Nice malty brew, enjoyed it."
"Mouthfeel is thin, no carbonation and some alcohol presence. Drinkability is not that good. I would take on if offered as a nightcap or winter evening libation, but there are much better options if I was seeking one out."
"I got this along with many other great beers for Christmas, I would have this beer any day."
"Drinkability: Hides the printed 9.6% ABV very well. Lil dubious about that number to be honest. If you like this, you could put quite a few away quickly. This beers only real saving grace is it's ""drinkability"" and/or as a ""food pairing"" type beer, sadly. A one-timer for me."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a clear dark golden color with a half-inch white head that goes away quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like caramel and bready malt, toffee, apples and honey. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, except that there is some booze noticable, and there's also a slight bitter herbal taste in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit sticky and creamy with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is decent enough, it's not hard to drink. Overall I think this is a decent brew, but there are other dopplebocks I like more than this one. But it is worth a try."
"My first beer of the ""helles doppelbock"" style, and I really enjoy it. Perfect for relaxing on the deck on a cool fall afternoon."
"D - Moderate to low. High ABV and cognac taste will keep me to the 1..."
"Overall: a beer with a unique taste. Overall maybe a bit too sweet for my pellet. Although the alcohol is relatively well hidden, after the beer warms up a bit, it becomes way too dominant. Conclusively, a couple of nips of this beer ok, but drinking a whole glass of this beer is a bit too much."
"Well on this bottle they call this the cognac of beers i think ill be the judge of that,it pours a see thru pale amber colour with little carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing head with no lacing just a little ring around the edge,it has a funky apple malty smell to it not too sure what to make of that aroma,it has a thin mouthfeel and tastes kinda like sweet apples infused with alcohol but not a dominant alcohol taste just enough to give you that little bit of warmth that a white port does at the finish so i can maybe see where they are trying to get as saying its the cognac of beers but it still just doesnt get me that excited really,because of the sweetness of this beer drinkability for me isnt the highest but i could see myself drinking this beer as an after desert beer but thats it for me."
"D - Although the alcohol is very upfront in this beer, it remains drinkable. The flavours are quite complex, and there may have been flavours that I didn't manage to decipher this time round. Will definitely seek this out again."
"Pours a clear orange-gold with a fizzy white head that drops quickly. Smells completely of pears, apples, sugar, and alcohol. Just over-the-top sweet. Tastes like a shot or two of everclear mixed with apple juice, though there's some breadiness. Sticky, syrupy body. Down the drain it goes..."
"Mouthfeel - The alcohol hits slightly course to start and then transitions to a creamy texture before a slightly dry finish. The carbonation is medium-low which suits the beer well."
"D: An interesting, unique beer for sure. I enjoyed it as a change of pace, but I hesitate to say that it's particularly outstanding. Worth a try, at any rate."
"D - Could be very high but you feel and taste the alcohol after a while also it s a bit acidic after a while in other words could be a 5 but is more like a 4 - goes down well"
"Pours a cisp golden amber, the off-white head falling back quickly. Wow, I can't believe how light it is for a dopplebock, maybe mai-bock. The nose is understated sour apples and alcohol. The flavor explodes with apple tartness, noble hop bitterness and honey sweetness. The head has been working throughout with great laceing on the sip, enticing you to another. The alcohol nose slowing you down. Nice crisp efferviscence ealy as it crosses the toungue, and a malty blanke late. It certainly earns the title ""cognac of beers"" I would have another."
"Drinkabilty: It's a good beer. Not a great one, but a good one. The flavor makes up of the mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth, but flat and somewhat syrupy."
"Warning: this beer can be a little hot when young, but some aging will do wonders. This review was done in Jun 09, which matches the best before date on the bottle."
"Drinkability: A real disappointment. Goes back and forth between being sickly sweet at times and unpleasantly hot. Regrettably, it's like the malt liquor of dopplebocks."
"Strong alcohol bite to the swallow. More hop bitterness than most doppelbocks, but still retains its malty character. Thick body with a low level of carbonation. Short lived aftertaste--dominated by the alcoholic warmth."
"It's not often I consider a drain pour but this one qualifies."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with an extremely low carbonation."
"Fine example, though I think it is more of a Helles bock than a traditional doppel."
"I'll try this again at some point in the future in case my tastes evolve but currently, I'm not looking forward to it."
"eggenberg has better offerings, like Samichlaus, which has a higher alcohol percent but so much more beer like"
"still not a fan though."
"This one is, needless to say, a bit disappointing. It may be a little old but it didn't do a lot or me and the elements were scattered. Next."
"Eggenberg's take on the doppelbock style isn't particularly to my liking - they come in as far too sweet, and not nearly bready enough. This is probably my final attempt at a beer from these guys."
"Scott"
"The BJCP (Beer Judge Certification Program) lists Urbock 23º as a notable commercial example of the dopplebock style - I'm not entirely sure why? I know that paler versions can exist but this didn't exactly exhibit all that is great with this rich German style. Eggenberg says this is known in many countries as the ""Cognac of beers"". While it does taste a little similar it certainly doesn't share one bit of the complexity or elegance."
"D- Overall, this is not a horrible brew, but at the same time it is way to sweet for me to enjoy."
"M&D: syrupy-rich on the palate but the smooth carbonation remains the refreshing input to keep the balance right, and the alc. (9.6%abv.) really is surprisingly well-hidden! Having tried only a couple of Eisbock/Doppelbock, I must say I find this one a very well-made bock benefiting from a sound body and supreme balance. Not a ""wow"" kind of beer in my book, but really I can't doubt the integrity of the overall performance at all and can surely kill a few bottles when my budget allows it!"
"Appearance is very clear and a bit lighter than expected. Carbonation is almost nil. Aroma is very boozy, flavor is the same and very sweet. Dried cherries? Dried Pear? Sweet aftertaste. Taste of alcohol is substantial. Drinks almost like a cognac."
"It is certainly not a session beer, and they are kidding themselves with the ""one of the strongest beers in the world"" line especially when they make a 14% monster themselves but it is a good sipper. A nicely balanced end of the night brew."
"Pours a clear yellow that borders on orange, with very little in the way of head thanks. This beer bleeds alcohol fumes so much that it almost burns the eyes and nose; seriously, the overwhelming alcoholic action detracts from what might otherwise be an excellent beer. It has fruity, sweet aromas; its interesting that and earthy, herbaceous hops are detectable on the nose but not so much on the palate. Tastes of a carmelly, syrupy sweetness with too much alcohol. Its smooth full body is its best characteristic. An interesting beer with some jagged edges; worth trying."
"Overall: A nice sipping beer; good for sampling, but too basic to justify the price for a small glass."
"overall i would not classify this as a doppelbock more of a belgium ale."
"D: Okay drinkability, different per style but really sweet and sugary with a dose of alcohol may limit repeats. A decent try but wouldn't bother having seconds on this one."
"Pours a nice golden color with a thin white head that quickly fades, leaving no lacing. Has a sweet alcohol and roasted malty aroma. Strong alcohol flavor with sweet hints of caramel, chocolate, coffee, toffee and slight nut presence. Very pleasant, very quaffable interpretation."
"As is the case with most bocks, this was not very carbonated, had a syrupy consistency, was very sweet, had loads of caramelized malts, licorice flavors, some spiciness in the finish, and very nice, warming ABV that was not strong nor throaty. The beer was liqueur like in its character, with some anise and licorice flavors. This was an exceptional sipping beer, that although strong, was well masked in alcohol content. What a great find. L'Chaim."
"This poured a bright, clear gold with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like honey wheat, molasses, and sour apple, with a bit of wild yeast and lemon grass. It tasted like honey wheat and rich barley, with a bit of lemon hops and yeast. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this initially seemed very similar to the Eggengerg Dunkel, but the more I deconstructed it, the more differences I found. This was much lighter, especially for a doppelbock. But it was still quite tasty, very clean, and super easy to drink. It had decent body, and hid the alcohol very well. I probably prefer the darkness and complexity of the Dunkel, but this was still a great beer."
"EDIT: Fixed a typo."
"Built for sippin' not for quaffing. Best suited as a slow after dinner beer and consumed as a one off. Passable, but not to my taste."
"I bought this sweet baby down at The Headkeeper in Greensburg. I saw that it was brewed by the same people that brought me my wonderful Samichlaus so I figured I'd give it a try. I poured an 11.2 oz. bottle into my tasting snifter at just below 40 or so degrees. There was a small white head that disappeared as soon as the bottle was completely emptied. The beer was crystal clear, no sediment in the glass and a ruby-orange color. The aroma was a bit musky, with a fair bit of hops and malt in the background. The taste was pleasant, a bit bitter and very little carbonation. With an alcohol content of 9.6% you can hardly taste the alcohol in it. A good beer overall, will probably recommend it to fellow drinkers in the future."
"Drinkability: I'm neither rushing out to get another one, nor will I be quick to recommend this one. I agree it seems to be incorrectly classified on this an other websites as a Doppelbock, and if anything it should be considered a Helles Bock, or maybe a Euro Strong Lager given the high ABV."
"Drinkability: Well, this is a fairly strong brew, so I don't think I could handle more than MAYBE two in a sitting. It's warming and thick enough to discourage a long drinking session. All in all, this urbock is a nice cold-weather beer, but you probably won't want to drink more than one at a time."
"glass at The Saloon in DC"
"This is certainly an interesting and unique beer. I had this beer a week ago so this is a very limited review, however, I remember it being very vinious, lots of fusel alcohol in the smell and taste, wine-like, and especially mead-like... Sweet honey, apple, maybe some balancing spices, a moderately slick mouthfeel, very boozy, and some spices that actually if i remember correclty reminded me of Samichlaus (some sprucey and fig notes)... Not up my alley, something I would like to present to my dad however, who loves meade and avoids beer. The eggenberg doppelbock dunkel was amazing though."
"This beer, for me, fun as it may be, is not as fulfilling as a trappist tripel og a nice DIPA."
"Interesting beer, but I am not sure I would like to drink this one too often."
"Looks sure can be deceiving. Eggenberg sure enjoys their high ABV beers. Contrary to other reviews, I thought this was a decent beer, but far from your average doppelbock. A sampling of this one once in a while will do it for me."
"Quite a dlicious lager, but seems more like a maibock than a dobblebock."
"Very sweet and somewhat thin, combined with 9.6% ABV, make this one for certain occasions only."
" Not a bad beer,just off on style."
"Drinkability - This wasn't very good. It's an odd style and an even more odd taste. This certainly isn't a dopplebock. Best way to drink this beer is by pouring it out.!"
"Drinkability - Boo this beer. This is not a doppelbock! Maybe they put a label on the wrong beer, maybe they haven't heard of a doppelbock. They just decided to brew one and call it a doppelbock. Yeah, i'm not buying that either. Destroy all remaining stores of this beer!"
"D- With the booze as noticeable as it is, this is not the most drinkable beer. But, this seems to be a tendency for some beers in this style. Given that, I found this to be an enjoyable doppelbock, but I don't see myself getting this again."
"Spicy, strong and a little sweet, but overall decent."
"The beer ""goes down smoothly"" I suppose. Its drinkable, but someone with some experience with beer knows a beer at 9.2% often make things happen almost 2 times as fast as a 5% beer. I suspect candy sugar was used as part of this beers ingrediants."
"It's not bad, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish the whole bottle. One snifter was enough."
"I tried this beer on March 12, 2008 after purchasing it from my one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured an orangy-gold colour into the glass with a 1/2 inch white head that quickly disappeared. The aroma was sweet malt, some caramel, and some grass. The mouthfeel was thin-bodied and medium carbonated. The flavour was sweet malt, with some milky hints. Not all that enjoyable a dopplebock."
"Pours out of the bottle with a reasonable amount of light lacy head that dissipates rather quickly. The color is a bit more honey than a pilsner or a light lager like Stella. The taste is not as sweet as I was expecting after reading the other reviews here, although that is present. At first taste it is very full bodied and has much more flavor than you expect from such a light colored beer. But very soon that dissolves to quite a light mouthfeel and a flavor dominated by the alcohol and an aftertaste that reminds me subtly of mead."
"330mL bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a poor fizzy pale gold. Little head and no lacing. Decent malty aroma. First taste is sweet. Very sweet. The taste remains syrupy throughout. The malts don't balance out the sweetness and the hops are not noticeable. Not an enjoyable beer."
"I found the taste a little unbalanced. Sweetness and alcohol are the most evident but the mild fruitiness is nice. I had higher expectations for this one, don't know why but I did."
"Weird looking; definitely didn't realize this one was a doppelbock. Pours like a krystalweizen, crystal clear with visible bubbles and a weak head. Light copper color. I am confused. Nose is very tasty: lots of sweet malt, spiciness, alcohol. Taste is likewise: crazy sweet, which I actually like, but tons of spice and alcohol in there as well. Not a doppelbock flavor, to be honest, but not bad. Body's a little thin, carbonation's a little high. Well I'll be honest, I had this one rated a lot higher when I didn't realize its supposed style. Not bad, but doesn't fit with the style in the least. Seems more like an ale, actually."
"D - At 9.6%, this is a fairly stiff drinker, and the alcohol content is fairly upfront."
"D - This is an interesting beer. It didn't look like most dopplebocks or taste like one. But it was good."
"Drinkability: This is an exceptionally unpleasant Doppelbock. Avoid."
"D - Not bad. There is some measure of balance in this, to counter the huge alcohol. Tastes like a very sweet maibock."
"Extreme beer, Euro style."
"drinkability is ok. the alcohol stays hidden fairly well, only showing itself as a gentle spreading warmth by about half way through the bottle. it also got worse as it warmed, and i ended up dumping about half of it. overall i wasn't impressed with this one. there are plenty of better doppelbocks out there."
"From an 11.2 oz. olive bottle that lacks a freshness date. The beer pours a crystal-clear, yellow-tinged orange with low carbonation. It's capped with a finger of off-white head that reduces to a collar and doesn't really lace the glass. The aroma is very enticing and chock full of fruits: apples, white grapes, apricots, peaches, dried banana, and hints of candy corn. Pretty similar on the palate, with the addition of oranges, melon?, late green/grassy hops, and a light dosing of alcohol. Not as sweet as I would have thought based on the bouquet (but this is a good thing), and the fairly smooth, tingly and dry, medium body supplies a nice base. I don't think I've ever tried a helles dopplebock, but this brew is interesting and tasty - definitely worth a try."
"An OK strong lager, probably on the light end of the scale for a Doppelbock in color and maltiness. Worth a try for sure, but not as good as Samichlaus."
"Pours on the very light side of a doppelbock, a crystal clear golden yellow color. Not much of a head is formed, about an eighth of an inch with okay tracing. The aroma is really intriguing, lots of caramel coated fruit. Very little to no roastiness, just a light toasted wheat note. Overall, the aroma seems just too fruity for the style, but again, this is on the lighter color and perhaps it's more appropriate. On the palate it is incredibly rich and sweet. It reminds me more of Samiclaus than any other doppelbock. There is a little toasted flavor, but it just isn't like any other doppel. Carbonation is very low providing a very thick, viscous mouthfeel. This beer is what I would call close to a white port, though I haven't drank one. Alcohol is quite apparent but not overbearing. Overall, I enjoy this beer and see how it's flavors mirror a lot from experimental brewers like Sam Calagione and the folks at Avery."
"This is a decently drinkable beer. Not exactly what I was expecting, but good nonetheless. Fairly complex, but not as much as other beers."
"Drinkability- sure enough I sucked the last little droplet out of my glass and then nursed the bottle for the vapors... so I could quaff a few bottles of this in a sitting. But the 9.6% ABV made itself known. Still, when I consider the whole A-S-T-M-D scenario, there are other bock biers that produce a greater satisfaction in my beer-lover tummy---"
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Overall: The oxidation is disappointing, but the underlying beer is still excellent. Complex and smooth -- an excellent golden doppelbock."
"M + D: Semi-heavy mouthfeel, but not too thick. Carbonation settles over the tongue. I would gladly have a couple or more of these, but I'm sure the alcohol would catch me off guard, so it's one to excercise some restraint with. If that can be done, it's a good call."
"The feel of this one is just too harsh, especially for the style. I can only take a sip each time, almost like a strong Barleywine or an over-the-top Strong Ale."
"I found this beer to be very drinkable considering my style which made it fun because of the alcohol level in this beer. Went down smooth and it was very tasty."
"The alcohol does let itself known loud and clear giving it a boozy character. It is unique - fits into the style in a broad sense. A wonderful sipping dessert brew."
"Pours very clear and light for a doppelbock -- it's really more pilsner colored. No head to speak of, though that's no surprise given the ABV. Aromas are quite sweet, with a honeyish character in the background and candied stone fruits up front. There's a hint of drying spice underneath everything, and a slight hop presence that comes out only at higher temperatures. On the palate, things start out with a touch of overdone sweetness, then hop bitterness and then an astringent spiciness that leaves a bitter aftertaste at the finish. Mouthfeel is zippy and light. Overall, I'll say about this exactly what I say about Samichlaus: it ain't a doppelbock, first of all. However, whereas Samichlaus, especially with some age, shows some softness and depth of flavor in the fruit column, this beer has none of that. Maybe it will come with time, but for now this is only middling."
"Classy looking bottle. Once poured, looks like clear honey-orange with lots of little bubbles. Small thick white head. Nose is fruity alcohol, with slight grass and must. Taste is syrupy ethanol, with an odd spiciness and some unbalanced hops. Mouthfeel is average, drinkability is hurt by the taste. Doesn't seem to fit the style."
"Drinkability : bonne bière très riche forte (9.9%, gravité de 23) et sucrée"
"Pours a golden yellow with a light thin head, which doesn't appear to look like a typical dopplebock. The aromas are of strong alcohol, but not unappealing, and honey, almost mead-like. The taste is great, traces of honey as well as oak, and a strong alcohol taste, which isn't surprising coming from Brewery Castle Eggenberg, the maker of Samichlaus. This beer is very good, but it is definately not a session beer by any means. This beer needs to be savored, and let it warm up a little bit."
"Clear golden color with a slim fizzy white head that dissipates almost as soon as it was formed. Sweet white grape juice, apple juice, and slightly grainy nose. Hot alcohol is not hiding here and lends to a hard metallic flavor. Dry grains, peppery spice, and a slight mint character seems out place for a Doppel. Medicinal to vinous at times. The mouthfeel is fair, a good fullness and a nice carbonation. Kind of confused with this one?"
"Hard to put down with the alcohol presence and lack of carbonation."
"Bottle into tulip glass. A: Golden/yellow, very white puffy head that retains moderately well. Minimal lacing. Surprisingly light for an urbock. S: Lighter malts, alcohol present, some fruit, very faint hops. T: Sweet up front, honey, grains, citrus and floral notes, a pretty clean taste. I can taste the alcohol, but it's nothing overwhelming. M: Very smooth, chewy. D: The only other beer I've had from Eggenberg is the famed Samichlaus, and it's actually got a similar feel. I'm wondering if it has to do with the yeast strain. In any case, it's very enjoyable, and very drinkable for such a high abv."
"Stylistically, I just dont see anything Doppelbockish about this but perhaps that is what makes it so unique."
"Prost!....Just about 24 hours or so until TTU94 causes another international incident."
"This bock has a golden color. There is a thin head which is typical for this style. The smell is malty, with a light caramel aroma. The taste is malty, probably from Munich malt. Then there is a caramel taste, slightly tanin with a lightly sweet finish that seems to linger. The body is about medium. Although this is drinkable, but at 9.6% ABV, I wouldn't order a second one if I were to drive after this."
"D: I don't think I can even finish this bottle. This is getting poured down the drain."
"T-This is worse than my first batch of home brew. Basically i would put this on par with a Olde English or Crazy horse. All I am getting here is alcohol. blech stay away."
"I did not finish mine, just too much alcohol taste."
"If you like Doppelbocks, this is a must!! A great brew."
"This beer pours a clear gold, it looks more like a lite lager than a doppelbock. Little head to speak of except at the pour. Aroma is pears, caramel and caramelized malts, very sweet smelling, reminds me a little of whiskey. Taste is smooth, with a little sharpness at the end. Doesn't quite have the bite of its big brother Samichlaus. Very syrupy with honey and raisin like taste, but there's not much else there. A warming alcohol feeling at the back end as well, but not too strong. Not a bad beer per say, but not too complex either. Certainly doesn't fit the definition of doppelbock for me. A decent drink, but I'll stick with its darker and more filling cousins."
"It wasn't bad but for the price I would rather buy a Samichlaus or something else."
"Thanks Doug!"
"Pours a beautiful clear gold with a smallish white head. smell is not intense, not skunky but this beer has perhaps seen better days. Tastes are not intense, some malty sweetness and a little hop bitterness, some alcohol in the flavors but not too much. Not extremely assertive but very enjoyable. This beer might just as easily be called a maibock. This would session very well if it weren't for the 9.6% abv, otherwise it goes down quite easily."
"Drinkability - I really enjoyed this ""little brother"" of a Sami. This is well worth keeping a few in the closet to see how this one will age. I'm sure it will be great in a year or two."
"Light gold color with no head. Doesn't look too special. Aroma is OK, has that ""European"" smell. Light carbonation. Upon tasting you realize that this is not your typical European lager. Starts somewhat sweet, then some heat from the alcohol kicks in. From there, I get a long lasting flavor that eventually fades to a moderate bitterness on the back of my tongue. Very smooth. Yum! Well done stong pale doppelbock. I usually prefer dunkel bocks, but this beer is quite good."
"Maybe this was a golden unicorn batch from Eggenber, but my goodness was it good. I only wish I had one more."
"Finally, if this is a dopplebock, I dont know what one is. The color is far too light, and the flavor lacks any hint of roasted grains if I had to guess Id say this was an eisbock or a weird alcoholic German lager but not a dopplebock. I'm not sorry I tried it, but this isn't something I'm crazy for."
"D- Not as bad as the eku 28... still, I'd like to see you sit down and chug a couple without throwing up from sheer exhaustion."
"Overall: A medium bodied beer, on the verge of cloying but not quite, rather enjoyable, but there are better things cheaper out there. I generally prefer a darker Doppelbock. Not very complex, but not totally one dimensional. The sweetness is hidng a couple good flavors."
"Very nice beer here! It's certainly not your traditional doppelbock; it's more like a combination of a bock and a barleywine. It's very good, though. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Eggenberg quoted on saying that ""on occasion this beer has been called the 'Cognac of beers'."" Is it that good? I don't think so. It had the taste of alcohol that a Cognac might have, but not the flavor density that a good Cognac might have. For the price of $3 for a 11.2 oz. bottle, one is more than enough for me. If you like your Doppelbocks to be heavy in alcohol flavor and not much of anything else, then pick this one up. You might enjoy more than I did."
"A surprising beer, and surprisingly good."
"Pours a champagne-peach color. Bright and bubbly. Very little head which thins out rather fast. Even in dim light, this beer really shines. I've gotten so used to dopplebocks appearing darker in color, this is a real treat. Nice malty aroma, with notes of clove, banana, and pear. I get a faint leathery scent here too. A very rich but smooth bouquet all around. The taste is also rich and smooth. There is some muted apple and pear flavor up front with a wood-flavored maltiness in the middle. Finishes almost with hopped-up licorice flavor. What a beer! Mouthfeel is silky smooth and fantastic. Were it not for the fact that this badboy really packs a punch, I could easily drain 3 or 4 of these in a sitting. Maybe more. The high alcohol is well-masked by the complex malts and spices herein. A treat for any fan of the dopplebock."
"I prefer big beers but this one was flawed. However, I may try another bottle in hopes of finding something fresher."
"Pours a clear golden-copper color; much paler than expected for a dopplebock. Produces a paper-thin off white head which fades immediately to just a few small smears of foam. Aroma is dominated here a bit too strongly by the alcohol with fainter notes of ripe pear, apple, apricot, banana, spice and light malts struggling to make their presence known. Overall the aroma is clean and sweet. Mouthfeel reveals a smooth, slightly oily and sticky texture with a pleasant,fine carbonation. Flavor profile starts out quite sweet and fruity with notes of honey, pear, green apple, caramel candy and a Grape-Nut cereal maltiness. This initial sweetness is quickly interupted by a moderately hot alcohol blast followed immediately by a somewhat surprising hefty hop bitterness. Would have preferred a slightly sweeter finish on this one. The hoppy bitter finish seemed a bit harsh and heavy-handed; kind of unusual for the style. In summary a decent Dopplebock, but not very interesting or complex. Wouldnt go out of my way for another one."
"D - Not awful. The flavor is a bit too sweet to be drinkable, but the potent hops help to subside that problem. Would go well with foods. I don't know about the classifcation of this brew as a doppelbock. Seems more like a Maibock to me."
"Overall a clean lager, but not very exciting beyond the shocking ABV for such a pale, relatively subdued beer. Fairly drinkable, but not a session beer for me due to the ABV, high cost, and lack of complex flavors."
"Crisp, clear, and golden with a very small amount of lacing. It has a very nice lacing as well. The smell is light and more of a straight lager smell than a doppelbock. Tastes like a regular lager too, but with a big kick of alcohol. It feels pretty bad on the palate. I don't think I would ever have this beer again, mostly because it didn't taste like a doppelbock and it was high in alcohol enough to damage the taste."
"The Urbock 23° is a tasty brew and its low carbonation level gives it a smooth texture as it warms. I can say that the alcohol crept up on me rather quickly. I was not expecting it to hit quite as hard as it did."
"A clean golden yellow beer. Has a large bubbly white head. A distinct sweet corn aroma rises from the glass with an equally distinct alcohol character in the background. Hints of malty cereal grain in the taste are overpowered the the strong alcohol presence. Just a light hint of bitterness on the finish."
"Poured into chalice at 50 degrees. beer was a strange yellow brown with yeast I guess floating around. Beer was strong tasting of fruit like a wine and strong alc. taste. good head at first. I would inagine if you liked Abbey type ales tremendously you would like this, and I like some Abbey's but this beer will not be purchased by me again and it went down the drain."
"Overall a nice delicious, flavorful brew."
"a dark yellowish, and there are white fragments floating inside. I'm not good at describing a certain ingredient when I smell but I can tell you that it smells comparable to a belgian tripel style beer. I can smell the alcohol in this beer and the taste of it as well. It has a very nice taste though. It will be too strong for those you like a lighter beer."
"Overall: An excellent dopplebock. I cant help but compare this to Samiclaus, and I feel that Samiclaus is a better tasting and more complex, yet quite similar brew. Definitely recommended."
"It tastes much more like a dopplebock than it looks, although it's a bit more of a brute than othes of this style. Even so, it's still quite drinkable although the ABV is a bit prohibitive."
"Unless the second bottle is better I won't be buying this beer again."
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer, but oh man it is huge for the style. There is something about a Lager that is this big that makes it so much more intimidating than an equal strength Ale. You can really taste the alcohol in this one. I wouldn't recommend this beer be your first impression of a DoppelBock, but I would recommend that you try it once you think you know what a DoppelBock is. This is no Salvator by any means. I would highly recommend this beer. It is an adventure for the palate."
"Poured to a golden color with hints of orange, nice thick whitish head thaat reduced to good lacing. Aroma was a mix of malty sweetness and hoppy fruits. Taste was an extension of this mix, and at mid-glass, the alcohol become just noticeable enough in both the aroma and taste to fit in perfectly. A long, smooth, tasty finish topped the whole thing off. This was really a good beer, and I will no doubt have more Urbock 23."
"Pale golden amber with a low head of moderate density. Gone before you let your breath out. Smells... Deeply rich and malty. Throw in some freshly mown grass and orange peel and you've got it down. Tastes... Hugely overpowering something... Raisiny alcohol and sweet malts - maybe a touch of lighter caramel in that. Coupled with the very thick mouth, this is so thick in your mouth in sweetness and malts that I just can't finish my glass. It's like a beer that you'd serve with dessert - and each guest would get a 2 oz glass of it. It's that strong in flavor! I don't know that it's really a bad beer, but it's sure hard to drink more than 2 oz!"
"A very strong alcohol smell and taste. Overpowered the other flavors and made this rather un-enjoyable. The appearance was beautiful with a rich golden color and steady stream of carbonation. I am pleased about the SchloEggenberg lettering on the bottle. I will have to revisit this beer, but right now I just dont appreciate it."
"Drinkability is high as is the ABV. Prosit Und Zum Wohl! MK"
"D: It was nice to try this beer and I would discourage anyone from it. Gor me it was nothing special."
"Poured into a snifter w/ little to no head. It looks like a high gravity beer as it leaves an alcohol trail around the glass as it is swirled. The aroma is hot w/ alcohol fumes, there is whiff of figs and leather. The taste is HOT alcohol that warms as it goes down. The sweet malt is the showcase, very full bodied. The heat and the sweet coating of sugars are a little much. This is a brew to be enjoyed once in a while, but not everyday."
"Drinkability- I hesitated when pulling this brew out during a 90 degree plus day....do I really want a thick and dark doppelbock? Well, turns out it was light colored and pretty refreshing. The price was a bit steep, but would have again if found."
"Drinkability suffers a bit due to the high ABV and the fact that it is pretty noticeable. A strong beer with not much aroma or beauty but a nice, well-blended taste."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a clear golden color beer with small bubbly head that disappeared quite quickly. Aroma is extremely sweet with some weird grainy aroma. Taste is just incredibly sweet with a warming touch of alcohol. I couldnt honestly pick-up much more then sweetness in this and therefore I probably wont be revisiting this one-dimensional beer anytime soon."
"Pours a honey-gold, with a white fluffy head, quickly dissipating (all too quick - but to be expected at this abv level). Smells of sweet malts, a sugary, caramel, notes of brandy. Surprisingly thin thouht, certainly sweet malts, crisp finish, light hops - again somewhat watery for this high-priced brew. Excellent mouthfeel. Drinkable, but the abv prevents me from trying another tonight."
"I look forward to the next opportunity to try this again."
"Overall an interesting beer - close to an icebock."
"The style says dopplebock, but the color looks more like a fine Maibock. Gold and very clear topped by a thin white head. The aroma has a nice dopple character. Rich and malty with layers of caramel, roast caramel, a bright finish from hops. The taste is dead center between. Very thick and rich caramel flavor. Even some chocolate character. Very sweet with a finish of orange citrus. Maybe a little medicinal on my 2nd drink. Too bad. A bit of alcohol flavor, although no real heat. Thick and smooth mouth feel. Decent drinkability. Not the same beer its big brother is (Samiclaus), but then, its nut supposed to be."
"pours a clear, golden, slightly red-orange in a bowl chalice with only a small capper of off-white head. retention and lacing is minimal. almost no bubbles rising through the liquid. aroma is surprisingly belgian-like, but only somewhat. sweet, lightly spicy and vinous with a strong vinous aroma. first drink is sweet with strong alcohol and a yeasty light bitterness at the back of the sip. there's a peppery spicyness that lingers from the middle of the sip through the aftertaste. finish is quite dry. alcohol dominates. mouthfeel is a medium body with a light carbonation that combines with a significant alcohol burn. this is definitely a sipper. nice alcohol warming. overall, i must say i'm a little disappointed. i was expecting a little more. a decent slow sipper, but a little too simplistic and for some reason, it reminds me of just an average belgian strong pale ale."
"The body is actually quite light for such a high ABV, syrupy sweet beer. Also fairly drinkable for that matter. Probably not something I will purchase again, however. More like an eisbock than a doppel for sure."
"Golden colour. Airline fuel aroma that nearly burns the nose. High alcohol in taste, with a good beer sharing the mouth, but also eggshells in aroma and in taste. Substantial malt makes it drinkable, but comparable to my having vodka with my beer. Medium mouthfeel."
"Grainy, malty, earthy, hay-like aroma. Golden amber in color. The head is a quickly fading wispy white affair. Honey laden with bready malts. Mouthfeel is syrupy and sticky, but the overall feel is a fortifying honey sweet malt bomb that gets you warm and happy feeling."
"THis one tends to draw you in a bit...sort of like a 'comfort beer'..."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of doppelbocks, but I found this to be a nice break to my usual routine of hop-laced stouts and IPA's. Recommended."
"Taste- Delightful brew mixing lots of candi sugars, strawberries, rose petals, very sweet malts."
"11.2 ounce bottle, without freshness dating. Pours pretty light amber, with light shimering orangy golden highlights, clear. Minor and quickly departing white head, no lacing. Strong nose of malt. Obviously strong and malty brew, moderate sweetness. Peppery, with notes of anise and gin. Bright and flavorful brew, worth a try if you like the style. Don't think I'd find this a pleasant sessioner, but as a late night sipper...quite enjoyable"
"Highly recommended."
"(11.2 oz. / .33L yellowish-brown bottle embossed with ""Schloss Eggenberg"" twice around the neck."
"Urbock 23 is the most undoppelbock-like doppelbock that I've ever had. It lacks the best characteristics of the style, or at least the ones I like the most, and puts nothing of value in their place. If you're an aficionado of high-ABV maibocks and have been looking for a year round version, saddle up and ride. As for me, this is my first and last bottle."
"Coming in a brown, 330 ml bottle, with attractive gold on black labeling, I was expecting a beer looking like an original bock. Instead the beer poured out pale golden and clear, like a modern lager. The head was rather small in size, as can be expected at this strength. The beer exhibited a grainy and floral bouquet, which was a little too clean. The alcohol was also evident in the nose, but not overwhelmingly so. The taste was not very bock like, but closer to a light bodied sweet lager with spices like pepper and vanilla, resembling quite a lot of strong pale ales from Belgian abbeys. The warmth of the alcohol was present as a potent reminder of the careful sipping this beer demanded. The yeast imparted a dusty dryness and an earthy bitterness, both of which are rather uncommon is a German style lager. As I got deeper into the glass, the beer seemed to become sweeter, and perfumey. The beer was not too thick on the palette, but had enough malt body to keep it from being too adjuncty. Not too traditional, but enjoyable enough to try if you havent."
"I work for an Austrian Company and got my Urbocks shipped direct from the mother country. Pours with a good golden color. Alcohol nose was strong. Very thin head that dissipated through the drinking of it. A few citrus notes with a very strong mouthfeel. I enjoy a good alcohol presence and this beer did not disappoint. A classic!"
"It's interesting, but not really complex. And the alcohol tends to hinder its drinkability quite a bit. It's nice, but there are more flavorful and balanced helles doppelbocks available."
"Drinkability: good. The complexity in both smell and taste is good and for the most part, so is the balance. The alcohol is a little overpowering in the taste, however. The only reason I didn't rate this beer higher is because, while I truly enjoy it, it doesn't seem to follow the style. As I said, this looks and tastes like a Belgian tripel, not an Austrian doppelbock."
"11.2 ounce bottle, no freshness dating. Lightest dopplebock I have ever encountered. More the color of a spring bock, but definitely packs a powerful punch."
"It's full bodied and syrupy. And though it weighs in at 9.6% alcohol, it actually seems stronger. Nightcap material, and nice, but a bit scattered."
"Impression: deceivingly alcoholic. Nice balance of sweet and alcohol. Clean flavor. Pleasant and complex, Well aged. Impressively mild. Good beer, but not what I expected from a dopplebock."
"Urbock's color is golden brown with a small, creamy head. Carbonation is pretty good. The aroma has a dark fruity malt smell, more like an eisbock than the dopples I've had. The taste continues with a dark fruit flavor, almost plum-like, with a little alcohol bite. The alcoholic taste is most notable in the finish. This seems more like a slightly weak eisbock than your average dopplebock. The taste is very good, but still doesn't seem as full-flavored as it could be. There are better dopples and eisbocks, and this beer just sits on the line between the two styles."
"Pours a clear amber, very light for its strength. White head dissipates very quickly, with not much lacing so far. Smells like malt and alcohol, not very complex. Tastes like alcohol as well, sweet malt is present, its actually quite balanced for such a big beer, maybe so balanced there isn't a whole lot of flavour involved. Mouthfeel is pretty full, no doubt from all the malt, kind of nail polishy flavour as well. Pretty smooth though, I don't think I'd buy this again though. I recognize it was one of the strongest beers in the world back in the day, but nowadays it just doesn't live up."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a strong pale malt scent that is warm and sweet. The taste is good. It has a thick and rich pale malt flavor that goes down smooth and finishes sweet and warm. There doesn't seem to be any real complexity here, but the taste is good nonetheless. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent brew. It has good flavor and a decent aroma; a good drinker."
"For a dopplebock this stuff is very light, a clear medium gold color, with barely any head beyond a wis of bubbles. Alcohol is present in the nose, as well as raisin, and lots of malt. Taste is pretty good. Alcohol provides a nice backdrop for the inherent maltiness of this beer. Not overly sweet, with some grassiness to boot. Mouthfeel is carbonated well enough. THis is a pretty good beer, even though it's a weird looking dopplebock."
"This beer pours a very clear, brilliant golden color with a very active bubble and no head. The nose is super strong. Big dark fruits and a blast of alcohol kick me in the face. The flavor is very full sweetness, with an almost oakey/woody character. The feel is thick and rather syrupy, but with a huge drying effect on the middle sides of my tongue, feeling almost like something is pinching in there. Overall, I'm not sure how I feel about this one. Its not bad, but surely not at all what I really like."
"Smell was strong but very tasty for a high content beer, syrupy and almost sweet. No hard kick which surprised me. A surprisingly smooth beer."
"Pours a bright clear golden color with not much head to speak of seems to be fairly highly carbonated for such a high gravity beer. Big juicy fruity aroma very effervescent alot of apple and apricot aromas going on the alcohol comes out as well.Taste is quite sweet and alcoholic of burned fruit and caramel.I notice a hop presence as I drink more mainly in the finish.a nice nightcap to a busy Xmas day, will help put me to sleep."
"Pours a white, one finger-head that goes quickly leaving no lace. Clear bright amber color. Light carbonation. Medium bodied. Nose is malty. Starts smooth and sweet, the alcohol is right up front, finishes with a little bitterness and an alcohol aftertaste. $3.19 for a 330ml bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."
"Drinkability: A wonderful nightcap sipping beer. From an early disorienting start due to the color and the limited nose, this beer recovers nicely. Perhaps it is more indicative of an Austrian doppelbock style, but I am unfamiliar with the variation."
"Small white head faded quickly. Clear, golden straw colored beer. Doughy, malty, and resinous pine flavors. Thick, chewy aroma of candied raisins and alcoholic hoppiness. Pretty thin bodied beer with a slight alcohol kick in the finish. Alcohol is a on the strong side, but otherwise a nice beer."
"Pours a clear deep golden color with a white head that fizzles into a thin collar. Steady single-stream of carbonation directly in the center of the snifter. Grainy, malty notes with a hint of appley fruitiness and a touch of yeast and hop tones. Alcohol is noticable in the nose and imparts a dry finish to the beer. Mostly candily, malty sweet with some vinous, slightly vegetal characteristics. Pretty good, with the understanding that it is a slow-sipper due to the noticable presence of warming alcohol. Nice on a cool evening as a digestif."
"The one thing I love about being back in the US is the massive variety of beer that is available to us. Sometimes I think that we forget about that. I picked up this nice looking bottle about 2 miles away from my apartment. I've never had anything from Castle Eggenberg before, but something was telling me to grab this instead of the Samilchlaus sitting right alongside of it. It pours a nice golden color with a head that sticks around for about 10 seconds before retreating to the walls of the glass. Not too impressive. Smell consists of very sweet malts and faint faint notes of alcohol. Taste is a malt lovers paradise. Very sweet toffee-ish malts lead into traces of alcohol on the tongue. It definately warms as it is going down. A dry alcohol taste remains on the tongue for several minutes after swallowing. This would be a perfect beer for crisp October nights and I think I will be saving my next bottle for exactly one of those evenings."
"Pours out an orangey yellow into my glass. No head at all. Smell is malty sweet, caramel overtones and candy sugar. Plenty of alcohol presence in there as well. Slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Quite pleasant for a malt head like me. Not as sweet as the more potent Samichlaus. A tasty treat that I wish I had bought more of"
"I think that the style is wrong for this beer. Urbock is very different from every doppelbock I have ever had. Clear orange gold color with a frothy head that subsided quickly atop a beer with very little carbonation. The flavors of this beer were primarily in the domain of hops and not malt as the flavor began with a sharp German hop bitterness followed by a sweet light malt and high alcohol followed by a lingering hop bitterness. I do not believe Munich malt came anywhere near this doppelbock as the malt flavors are smooth and the color is so light . A pretty good beer with no faults but it is a very poor example of a doppelbock."
"Almost no head on a transparent orange yellow color body. The beer looks dead. The smell doesn't show much, a bit disappoiting. The taste is fruity but the alcohol flavor invades the whole palate and gives a real kick in the mouth. Very liquorish, as if this beer was made just to show alcohol. The mouthfeel is ok, quite warming in the throat. There are some stronger beers that are really much more refined than that."
"Nice deep gold with a two finger head that quickly falls, leaving a lacy surface foam. Falls from the high alcohol, i presume. Malty sweet in the nose. High alcohol - like a barley whine w/o hops. Taste is very sweet. It is strong but lacks the balance of bitterness. cloying at times. Seems smooth and might be a good after dinner drink."
"The body is perfect. Its smooth and buttery. It really fills up the tongue. It goes down very easy."
"This beer poured a clear yellow color and formed a small bubby white head that left little lace as it quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, pine and alcohol. The flavor was of malt, a touch of hops, and a heavy hint of alcohol. The finish was medium light, yet creamy. It was a touch astrigent with the alcohol coming across on the palate. A good beer, but hard for me to think of as a dopplebock like Celebrator."
"I will try to re-rate this with a better bottle in the future."
"I'm glad I tried it, but it wont fit into the regular rotation."
"Clear golden body with a rather light, quickly fading head. Sweet, honey-ish malty aroma, with a mild kick of alcohol. lavor starts out with sweet, biscuity malts. A nice balancing of hops becomes present. Finishs a little sherry-like, with a nice warming sensation. Body was, as expected for its heft, rich. I enjoyed this beer for being sweet without being cloying, which is what I was (wrongly) expecting. Nice beer."
"This is an experience beer. Good from time to time. It is quite enjoyable. Drink this on a day when you are only going to have one."
"Overall: Enjoyable, I like a big-ass beer once in a while. A really good every now and again beer."
"11.2 oz bottle pours a clear, medium gold that has an ivory head of big bubbles on an aggressive pour. Doesn't look like any doppelbock I've seen before. Aroma is interesting, and deserves high marks. Sweet toffee and caramel quickly transition into molasses, with fruit esters similar to fried apples. Mouthfeel has minimal carbonation, and some hop and alcohol bite. Taste begins with some bready yeastiness, but is soon dominated by a malty, molasses backbone. Several dark fruity flavors linger in the background, but don't fully emerge as they should. Some hoppy bitterness is always around to keep things interesting. Finishes with a caramel aftertaste that is immediately followed by a biiter, herbal hoppiness. This is a very tasty and complex brew, that is a departure from Bavarian doppelbocks due to a unique hops presence. Very enjoyable and pleasantly drinkable."

"Golden orange with a white head that's gone before you know it. Sharp, spicy yeast nose with hoppiness and a bit of vinous character noticeable. On the palate, it's grapefruit and rind with lots of hopping; spicy, earthy, and bitter. Yeasty and spicy like a belgian tripel. In fact, aside from the big caramel backbone, this beer could easily be taken for a tripel. Spicy alcohol warms. Smooth and slightly carbonated mouthfeel, very tingly from the spiciness and alcohol. Leafy character in the aftertaste. Not a bad beer, a very interesting surprise from Austria."
"This is not near as good as the Samichlaus, but passable."
"Drinkability  This went down like Courtney Love at a rock concert. I cant say that it even remotely resembled the Doppelbock style, but it was awesome nevertheless. I will rate it on its merits."
"Other: I'm really changing my mind about lagers. When all you've really been exposed to is the pale lager variety, can you blame me?"
"Light amber colored beer (it actually looks something like a piece of clear amber jewelry). Intense carbonation, but a relatively thin, large-bubbled head. An almost monstrous alcohol aroma pushes other smells aside. Malty, with a very mild hopiness. Peppery, spicy smell and taste. The beer is intensely sweet, and has a harsh alcohol finish. Full bodied, sometimes creamy mouthfeel. The more that I drank of this beer, the more it became one-dimensional....sticky sweetness and intense alcohol. Not particularly drinkable."
"Clear gold hue, oodles of animation endless streams of bubbles race towards the white head. Absolutely gorgeous! The head collapsed at a modest pace, the tight cap held well. No lace. The nose is tartly sweet, but a harder sniff draws out clean, hearty maltiness, a note of alcohol too. While it is not all that potent it is inviting. Warming spicy alcohol caramel-apples, distant maltiness... pepper... sharp fruitiness... all construct the marvelous palate; sweet at times, more peppery at others, borderline cloying but the hot alcohol cuts off that notion quickly. Wow, this is not a typical dopplebock by any stretch of the imagination. It is like a Belgium-influenced dopplebock. Weird? Yes but very tasty, complex and intriguing. Light in body, not thin however. The carbonation is little. This is a wonderful sipping beer. Savor this one! Seek it out, highly recommended."
"Deep clear golden yellow color, has a decent head that doesn't last. Sweet malty, toffee candy like aroma. Sweet burnt caramel sugar flavors, full body and a thick and syrupy mouthfeel, alcohol comes out in the finish with a sticky sweetness, not at all what I expected."
"Poured a softly bronzed orange color, with a small foam head that sat pretty well, leaving behind some tendrils of stain. Smell was round and subtle, with orange notes that open to the most true scent of citrus rinds Ive seen in a lager. Malt body, though, with alcohol scents of a small and acceptable size and quality. Taste was lightly creamy, with notes of lemon, orange, and grapefruit - like a fruit cocktail of these. They merge/create (?) a very moderate and calm bitterness, balancing with the very fine malt in the background, a malt that was not great or characterful but there. Finish was moderate, tasting like a mish-mashed blend of the palette, while it does becomes grassy and a bit oily. Had some whiskey malt notes that only come out toward the end of the finish. Smooth, full, and silent mouthfeel, so good you dont notice because it fits the overall character of the beer perfectly. Intensely drinkable, goes down so easy. If this was cheap and more available there would be trouble. This beer wowed some friends who aren't big into beer."
"Pours clear and just a fraction darker than pure gold. The head was thin, fizzy and very short-lived. The aroma is marvelous - candied fruits, malt, and yes, cognac. The mouth is prickly, but also heavy with sweet and alcohol. The taste is sweet and fruity, yet the alcohol makes its presence known. The hops lurk in the background at first, then come out as the sweetness fades and the alcohol attempts to take over. The battle is finally won by the warm, soothing, sweet alcohol with the raisin and apple tones. Definitely a winter warmer, this goes down well in Moscow in early September. I'm enjoying this, but like it's adopted brother Samichlaus, this is not the beer to have when you are having more than one!"
"Another good beer from Eggenberg. I'm looking forward to the Samichlaus again this winter, but for now this has to be my favorite. I'd definitely have another one of these."
"Pours a sound gold tone with a nice sized creamy white head very solid looking brew, but I was anticipating a ruby tint to it for some reason. Trickles of small spots of scattered lacing not bad decent overall, but this golden appearance is just a front. For this beer packs quite a punch in the aroma and flavor, for starters deep syrupy sweet tones surround the nose with jet streams of alcohol wavering in the air. Definite fruit soaked in alcohol slightly caramelized reminds me of some moonshine I once tried from Kentucky in the aroma with a splash of honey to it, this one's complex and appetising. Start with small sips this one needs some adjusting to just like toeing your way into a cold pool, but once you just dive in it's all worth it. Flavor consists of one malty backbone with pan seared over ripened fruits drizzled in honey and a touch of banana flavored rum sprinkled to kick it up a notch wow this is great as alcohol sears the back of the throat doesn't scorch enough to cause discomfort just let's you know the alcohols in there. Some beers the taste of alcohol being apparent detracts from teh overall taste in this particular brew it only enhances the experience. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a sticky chewy texture very nice. The final chapter in this beer as far as drinkability goes is wield the power wisely becareful with this one at 9.6 it warms you up don't make it a challenge to indulge but enjoy this one. A quite enjoyable slow sipper that qualifies on my list of winter warmers to keep in mind this winter."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with almost no head and little lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly fruit and alcohol - mostly alcohol. The flavor reminds me of a wine with an oak character. Very thick. Sweet maltiness and alcohol are the first things noticed in the flavor. Drinkability suffers from the alcohol. Not one of my favorites."
"Poured a amber/bronze, much lighter in color than I expected for a doppelbock. Flavor is dominated by a bittersweet, syrupy malt that coats the tongue. Alcohol is quite evident in the flavor profile, adding a pepper that tries to cut through the blanket of sweetness, but fails to make a substantial dent. Heavy and unwieldy."
"A delightfully creamy and sweet beer. Reminds me of a Sauternes wine, or perhaps a Tokay. Marvelous."
"Fruity alcoholic aftertaste, like a medium-bodied semisweet wine. The low drinkability lowers what would be a reasonably good beverage. If I didn't know better, I'd think I was drinking malt liquor. Potent stuff campers."
"Not a good beer in my opinion, the barley taste is just too much for me.. :("
"The beer pours a crystal clear golden yellow; the head modest in size, frothy in texture, off white in color and it dissipates quickly leaving a silky sheet of lace to caress the glass. A touch of yeast lots of malt, fresh and clean is the nose. Big malt start that is also sweet, the top middling in its feel to the palate, finish is delectable in the hop arena, the carbonation purposeful, the aftertaste droughty, and a fine beer to be sure and well worth a sample."

"Any head this beer had went away very soon after I finished pouring. The liquid itself was beautiful. It was a perfect golden color with not a bit of haze or anything to make it look less than regal. Malty bock aroma but with a good sized dose of spicy hops which were quite a surprise. Caramel and malt flavors were tasted without surprise, and the beer was very warming on the way down. The only thing I didnt like was a very short-lived fusel alcohol taste after each sip. It was quite a distraction. It was kind of medicinal and very unpleasant. Ill have to try this beer again to make sure I didnt get a bad one."
"Crystal clear and golden in color, with very little carbonation and no head at all. The aroma is sugary sweet, with a bit of raisiny fruitiness. The flavor too, starts off quite sugary -- almost granular. Big malt body with more fruit notes and noticeable alcohol warming. Hops are purely supportive but contribute to a dryish finish. Medium-bodied,creamy and somewhat coating, but not excessively so. Decent beer, but a bit one-dimensional in terms of flavor."
"Slightly hazy cinnamon orange/brown, lighter than I expected. Small head that doesn't last more than 30 seconds. Very simple lacing on the glass. Deep buttery toffee flavors, similar to ""Cracker Jacks"" caramel. Medium bodied, a little sense of coating but not like a Samichlaus. Slight sense of peach and a prickly bit of noticeable hops. Alcohol acts as a counterbalance to the sweetness, comes on mid-mouth and in the aftertaste. Interesting, starts subtle and sweet and gains body toward the end. A few bottles are left at the liquor store and they're coming home with me for those special, friggin' freezing Minnesota evenings."
"Crystal clear golden in hue, topped by head that readily dissipates into a glass coating ring.  Most closely resembles a hellebock in appearance.  The aroma is a combination of nutty, toasty Munich malt and buttery toffee, w/ a hint of a floral Mittelfruh hop nose.  Oddly, as the brew warms and breathes, there is no change in the aroma at all.  Completely static aromawise. Sugary sweetness hits the palate initially, then yields to a malt profile comprised of honey drenched toasty grain.  An unexpected snap of moderate hop bitterness emerges mid palate, immediately offsetting and almost sharply contrasting the previously sweet malt profile.  Deceivingly light in body, w/ an agreeable and slightly slick mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ a resurgence of sweetness lingering, lending an overall sweet impression to this brew.  Alcohol warmth creeps in slowly and coats the throat after a long deliberation.  Urbock 23 is truly a unique and enjoyable beer... A doppelhellesbock?"
"Strong slightly floral and slightly sweet aroma, kind of sticky sweet start, which quickly fades to a dryish bitter finish, very warming brew, also a bit of a whiskeyish character, lots of body and flavour, i liked this stuff."
"First thing I picked up on the nose is lemons. A little spicy yeast and a sweet smell. The color is clear but lackluster, it seemed dull. Not a lot of head and and very little retention. Flavor mildly malty, the tiniest bit of hop bitterness and a good dose of alcohol. Seemed a little thin."
"I am surprised this has been hosed by many other reviews.  It has me grinning like Cheshire Cat."
"Interesting is rightPours a crystal clear, shiny gold color, I could smell the alcohol aroma a bit, as well as malts. On the palate, there is tiny alcohol bite, but really comes of spicy or peppery, but this brew sure does give a warming sensation all the way throughQuite interesting for a DBIn the finish (Venom nailed it) tastes like whisky a bitOverall very interesting DBthe extreme warming in the pit of the stomach is awesome..."
"Anyhoo, Urbock 23° has the basic aroma and flavor of a doppel.  It has a nice sweet and malty nose, with a bit of spice (I saw vanilla listed on another review, but I'm not sure that's what I picked up) to it.  The flavor is rich with molasses-like flavors and a bit of balancing hops.  This is one of those brews that had an obvious alcohol presence in it's warmth in the mouthfeel and continues to warm as I drank.  However, I didn't notice any alcohol in the aroma or taste.  I thought that was a bit odd, but certainly not unpleasant."
"Clear golden color.  A bit of skunk on the nose.  A bit of an off flavor.  Slightly skunky.  Tastes a bit  like many European beers that I've had in bottles.  Has that ""European"" skunk to me.  Not very good.  I'm surprised a bit because I really enjoyed their samichlaus bier."
"Clear, clean, dark gold with little head...sweet malt/vanilla tones on the nose...9% alcohol?  You'd never guess it...sweet and slick with little hopping...a bit sweet for some but a good blond doppel in my book..a nice flowery hop profile would do wonders for this beer..could use some additional hopping but still very good as is.."
