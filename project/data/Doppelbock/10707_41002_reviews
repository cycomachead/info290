"12oz bottle from Trader Joe's. Think 2 parts Ayinger, 1 part George Killian's. Solid winter enjoyment for people who want to save a buck here and there."

"It's an interesting brew, probably quite good if dopplebocks are your thing. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but certainly I want to try more of Trader Joe's brews."

"A great doppelbock for about a dollar a bottle."
"O-this beer was good"

"Overall: I liked this. The next doppelbock I have will definitely be measured against this one. I'm not certain that I see this as a ""winter"" beer, because it doesn't really scream ""winter"" at me, but it doesn't really have to. This beer could be a good starter for folks looking to get into ""big"" beers, because it's very easy on the palate despite the higher-than-average ABV."

"Cold. Cold is sometimes enough."
""
"O - It's a decent doppelbock, though an excellent value considering the $1 price. Nothing special, a good sweet and malty brew."
"As I finished this bottle of Joesphs Brau's Winterfest, I thought, ""Damn, I should've picked up a six-pack."" 'Nuff said."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, best before 4/14. Pours mahogany, with a half inch light tan head, that leaves nice lace behind. Smell vanilla, oak, dark fruit, alcohol, bready, and toffee. Taste is very complex, less aggressive than the nose, with everything from the nose being represented, oak, vanilla, and the breadyness are most dominant. Body is medium, plenty of carbonation, a touch dry which I expect, and gives down easy enough, but seems larger than its 7.5%. Very nice example and an impressive winter warmer for an amazing price!"

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a dark, ruddy amber with a one finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Very light aroma of caramel malt and dark fruit. Flavor is caramel and toasted malt, dark fruit, light nuts and a charred smoky element. Finishes with light hop bitterness and lingering smoky malt. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. An interesting take on a doppelbock and the smokiness was appropriate for the winter theme. Finish was a bit attenuated, but overall a pleasant winter bock."
"Taste is near-burnt caramel and a touch of roast and dark chocolate. Not bad...a little on the astringent side, but not too bad. Not sure how many I could drink at a time, but a nice affordable doppel is not always a bad thing. Its better cold than warm, for what its worth."
""
"This one comes pretty cheap from Trader Joe's (and in this case was a gift). It tasted about like I expected. It was a solid dopplebock-type beer with a little holiday spice mixed in. To me, it is the perfect session winter beer but I can't rate it any higher than that."
"Interesting, fairly complex malt flavor. Esters are a bit overly pronounced. Also a bit sweet and hot, but it's a winter brew."
""
""
"A decent but sort of lack luster taste, seems to be missing something that would make a person search out more of this stuff."
""
"Overall: A pretty decent bock. Nice malt driven taste that is pretty nutty. Very creamy and smooth considering the higher ABV."

""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
"Very drink-able, decently crafted, and a good value, though it lacks the depth of flavor that the better examples of the style exhibit."
""
"On a consumption note, this beer is best served at 40-45 degrees IMO. As it warms the flavors and aromas open up."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with soft carbonation that allows this to gently foam up on the palate. Resulting mouthfeel is very smooth and pillowy. Dry finish, slightly sticky from high malt sweetness. Ethanol felt on back of palate and throat, slightly surprising for a 7.5% doppelbock."
"D - Not bad, the malt character is nice up front but becomes a bit cloying by the end of the glass. In the end, there are much better dopplebocks out there than this one"
""
""
""
"Overall: The aftertaste is a bit unpleasant and it was a little too dry but the aroma and malt presence is well done."
" Low C+"
"O- Not a great beer, but nice finish and nice overall."
""
""
""
""
"Litle bitterness in the mouth with a dry finish. This is a very nice beer for the price. Thanks to my friend Eddie from the Bronx for picking me up some of this at trader Joes in NY! Overall I give it a 3.5."
""
""
"Well worth trying considering the $5.99/sixer price tag."
"Poured this Doppelbock style ale from a 12 oz brown bottle into a pint glass. Poured a nice clear reddish brown color. Produced a nice tan head, great retention. Aroma was a sweet malty, caramel scent. Full body, this ale was a very nice surprise. Excellent example of the style, excellent session beer. Taste of toasted grain, caramel and a very aggressive hop finish. High in alochol, leaves you feeling warm, great brew for winter time!"
""
"O: It seems to be an odd example of this style. Its not that it is bad, it just seems unfamiliar and medicinal. Personally would not purchase again, esspecially since you can get better offerings from trader joes for the same price, id rather stick with the pale ale, or ipa... both good examples of their own respective styles made by trader joes."
""
""
"O - all around decent beer that I might enjoy more so with a hearty meal than just on it's own."
""
"All in all, not a bad beer at all. Makes for a good companion on winter nights. I'll probably make more purchases after realizing how affordable this is. Nice job!"
"T: For some reason, this tastes more than 7.5%. Mouthfeel is a little syrupy and the taste is almost like a rye bread syrup. Some roasted malt, caramel, brown sugar and yeast as well."
""
"Good for the price."
"Pours a clear copper color with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a thin cap. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some fruit aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, caramel, dark fruits, and an interesting band-aid flavor. A slightly assertive and medicinal bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is not a very good beer in my opinion based mainly on the off band-aid flavor coupled with the assertive hop bitterness."
""
"O: For a $6 6er of dopplebock it's quite a deal. To style and well made. Nowhere near the greatness of Salvator or Celebrator, but at this price point I'm happy."
"O - Not exactly an exciting beer, but it doesn't taste terrible either. The relatively high alcohol content was surprisingly covered up well."
"dark brown with a good two inches of off white tan colored head. This faded and nestled own leaving a thin film and some side glass lace. The smell was nce and smoky with a bit of an earthy grain mixed in. A touch of some caramel and sweetness as well. The flavor was very tight. Crisp clean and efficent flavor, lots of malt, nice smoky flavors with a touch of caramel."
""
""
""
"Overall: I guess if you are picking something up from Trader Joe's and really want it to be Trader Joe's brand, this would be an all right one to pick up. Everything is muted compared to others of the style, but it isn't too bad."
"Overall: Hey! Wait a minute. Wait just one damn minute! This is curiously reminiscent of the Gordon Biersch Winter Bock... E-mails to the brewery have gone unanswered."
"Pours cola brown, light brown. Thin head. Nose on the lighter side too with lightly roasted malt. On the palate the same character is found with light roasty malt flavors and some dark bread breadiness. Light bodied but not watery. Smooth. Very drinkable."
"Bargain winter ale. I have found it very drinkable over the years."
"Overall, I like it. I bought more and, while it's available, I'll likely get some more again. It's not my favorite, but it's a total winner for the price."
"Taste is slightly burnt toast soaked in brandy with fermented dark raisins, light sweetness (esp. up front) with bitter spicy raisin and hint of alcoholic heat taking over. It’s good, in style, but not great and it’s a bit heavy for the simple character. Feel is nothing special."
"Malts are also main components of flavor, but some spiciness as well. Not very sweet overall, and definitely not as sweet as the aroma [IBU = 28] but plenty of caramel and brown sugar flavors."
"D: Not for sipping, not much taste here. Drink it fast & get a quick buzz. I recommend drinking this one straight from the bottle, it's a lot better that way. A bit too metallic for me but it is worth giving it a go. I've yet to taste a very good bock but I haven't been looking for one either."
"D- For a 7.5% ABV is pretty drinkable. The alcohol is not as upfront as some beers with that much volume. Probably wouldn't buy it again but its drinkable."
"D- I bought two of these last year. Drank one fresh, and tossed this one in to age. Not sure I'd really buy this one again. Overall it's a great beer for the price, but there's many other options if you cross over to strong ales to satisfy your need for big and moderate priced brews"
"D: It has decent doppelbock character, but it is a bit incoherent. What do you want for a buck a bottle? Not bad to try."
"D - An incredibly drinkable beer at less than $6 per 6-pack. I've only started trying out the Trader Joe's beers in the last two weeks and I have to say that I have only been impressed with the level of quality for the price. This is a very drinkable beer, but I can't let the price determine the drinkability. The flavor could be more complex, especially considering the high ABV. To drink more of something with this much alcohol on a week night I need a good reason. The simplicity leads me to move to something else that doesn't pack such a punch."
"Josephs Brau Winterfest was dark amber in color with good clarity. It had a light tan head with average retention and minimal lacing. The smell was dark malt, a touch toasty and with toffee and caramel. The taste was quite malty with a little dark fruit a bit toasty. It was sweet upfront and finished semi-dry. The body was medium with medium carbonation. Drinkabity was above average. This is a decent Doppelbock for a cheap price."
"A chilled bottle is poured into a glass mug. The liquid is brown with some ruby notes. Lots of carbonation bubbles are visible. A thin tan foam head was present as I poured, but quickly disappeared. It now looks like a mug of Coke. The aroma is slightly sweet and full of winter spices. Dark and chocolate malts provide a good base for this beer. Some alcohol and bitterness comes forward at the finish. It works well and reminds you this is a stronger beer. The beer is medium bodied and has a lot of carbonation. A coat that is a little bit sticky is left behind. Although this beer is a tad strong, it drinks very easily. I could easily make my way through a few bottles on a cold winter night. This isn't an exceptional beer, but for the price, it is very good and worth checking out."
"7.5% the big winner. :)"
"I good beer for a good price, and with the exception of a few flaws, a fine example of a dopple bock. Poured into a pilsner glass the beer produces no head, no carbonation to speak of, and no lacing. The smell is of carmal and malt sweetness as well as chocolate and dark fruit. The taste is malty with a light to medium body with drinkability being moderate."
"Drinkability - not a bad brew, but not very complex either."
"So much Brett Favre on right now. Nothing to do with the beer, just an observation. Speaking of the beer, it pours a clear garnet-brown topped by a short finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises wheat, graham crackers, chocolate syrup, molasses, and cinnamon. The taste runs very similar, with the addition of rye bread and a stiff orange-peel kind of bitterness that cuts down the spine. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly grainy feel. Overall, a pretty nice d-bock, but the strange bitterness is not only out of place, but also rather off-putting. Beyond that, this ain't so bad, really."
"12 oz. bottle from Trader Joe's. Pours dark red to brown with a tanned, rocky, long lasting head and lovely carbonation. Aroma is not very appetizing - with piny hops and bready malt in the balance. Taste is similar plus alcohol. Body is medium, crisp and somewhat oily. Finish is long and earthy. Well, this is not Ayinger Celebrator."
"A solid offering, with the only surprise being the off flavor."
"D -- Exceptional drinkability for a beer of this strength -- dangerously tasty. This will stand up to any of the Bavarian imports."
"The flavors in this beer are very satisfying, and you forget that for about the price of a bud, you are enjoying a great beer. If you live within 20 miles of a Trader Joe's this is worth the drive. ALso, you can mix and match beers at TJs and create your own six packs."
"I consider this is a better-than-average doppelbock and an excellent value. Pours a very dark brown, with glimmering mahogany where the light shines through. A nice sized greyish tan head is also impressive given how rarely doppelbocks have a decent showing of foam. Aromas a very sweet, mostly toffee-ish with some dark fruit. Promises to very chewy, as indeed it is upon tasting. Again, strong toffee notes, lots of toasted malts, hints of roasted almonds. Has a bitterness on the back end that balances out the sweetness."
"Drinkability: I think I like a bit more of that roasted malt in my Doppelbocks, but this is good. I can't see myself having more than one in an evening though."
"Drinkability> no thank you"
"d: an interesting very pruny take on the doublebock; for a buck a bottle at tjs its pretty awesome; hopefully this will encourage people to buy some other doublebocks- it is definitely the most adventurous of the tjs beers but definitely not the best"
"Pours a middle brown color with a sparse head. Not much lacing or retention. The nose is reasonably strong and spicy, with notes of brew salts, cardamom, and cloves. The taste is definitely bargain basement, especially with the thin and overly carbonated mouthfeel. Caramel malt sweetness mixes with the Munich malt sweetness, which can't be overcome by anything the hops can bring. the spicing is high as mentioned, and it's augmented by the peppery alcohol. Not a bad beer for the price but I'm happy with just one."
"Picked up a single for $1 at the TJ in Brookline. Poured into pint glasses. Light brown in color, with a hint of red. Sizable white head. Smell was a bit spicy, such as cinnamon and coriander. Reminded me a bit of a winter warmer. Taste was good but not as intense I was hoping for. More of a lager, than a doppelbock. Mouthfeel was also a bit thin for me, as I like my winter beers a bit more hearty. Also surprised to see this beer at 7.5% abv. Not a spectacular beer, but not a bad choice at $5.99 a six pack."
"Josephs Brau Winterfest (AKA Gordon Biersch Winter Bock) is good to the last drop and has never let me down in the 5 years I've been enjoying it. So don't hate. This is a good drinkin, quality beer. The only reason people wouldn't like it is because they like bitter, hoppier winter warmers, which this is certainly not."
"Overall it's not terrible, but to me it seems more like a Marzen or an O'fest, than a Double Bock. But what do I know? Brewed by someone somewhere for Trader Joe's, it isn't the worst beer in the world, and certainly worth the price of $5.99 for a sixer."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark, clear, sienna color with a thin tan head, sorta fizzy. Lot of banana bread in the aroma, with some bread crust, nuts and toffee. Flavor is dark wheat bread, earthy hops, light fruitiness. Tastes like it was fermented with an authentic German yeast. A little mineral/astringent character. Body is too thin for a doppelbock and lets the alcohol come through a bit. One of the better TJ's beers though, easily."
"An inviting caramel amber color, this beer is delightful insofar as it has complex flavors, including dark roasted grains, a hint of orange zest, and maybe even some anise. The head resolves into a ring of white around the glass, but don't let that visual thinness fool you. It is packed with goodness. I highly recommend this beer. It can stand on its own without food but definitely goes well with lamb or rosemary flavored meats."
"Overall very drinkable. If you don't imbibe daily, one beer will be pretty effective (and pleasant) as far as taking the edge off. Tastewise, it's much more than just tolerable."
"overall, this is an enjoyable beer but i dont know that ill get it again"
"I would rate as a b+ or a-."
"D- trader joes brand beers have been hit or miss for me. this one is pretty much a miss. i dont think ill buy another one of these."
"Pours a clear dark copper body below a thin off white head. Aromas are strong bready malts, prunes, and little to no hop presence. The taste is dominantly malty with dark fruits and a good malt backbone to this beer. The mouthfeel is rather fluffy and full but not thick in the least bit. Though many in this style have a chocolate character (ie Ayinger Celebrator), this one holds no such flavors due to less roasted malts."
"Notes: Can't beat the price, especially for a beer of this style....but I'm just not a very big fan."
"I wont change my original comments but this is adjunct beer."
"Not bad yet a more robust carbonation would give it more body and allow for an improved feel and drinkability. A bargain for the price nonetheless."
"Pours brown with a good one finger tan head. Modest amount of lacings. Aroma is figgy with a hint of molasses. Taste is sweet fruity with just enough hops for support. Mouthfeel is fine for the style with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is quite good though at 7.5% abv it could be a short session. This would pair well with holiday foods. A tasty beer at a modest price."
"Prost!"
"Taste: A toasted malty sweetness with a quick caramel flavor in the middle that finishes of with a slight bitterness"
"Overall: Mouthfeel was about standard, well carbonated and medium bodied. Fairly drinkable and that's coming from someone who doesn't enjoy the style."
"Very drinkable, not filling like belgians. Definitely could drink more than one especially with cheese and/or desert."
"This is another one from Trader Joe's that is allright, but with the huge selection of high quality dopplebocks I don't know if I'd go back to this. But still, I can't rag on the price. It definitely isn't breaking any ground, but if you are on a budget it could be fantastico."
"A nice solid example of the style. The best I have had from Trader Joe's."
"An outstanding bargain at Trader Joes for a buck. I can enjoy this session of a Doppelbock all day especially knowing what I paid for this."
"Clear ruby red with a fat shaving cream head that leaves decent looking lace on the glass. Dark fruit, toasted grain and toffee and german malt in the nose. Tastes like it smells, and gets more complex as it warms. Pretty darn tasty but maybe just a little thin bodied for the style. A steal for $5.00 a sixer at TJ's."
"D- Not too bad of a dopplebock for the price. This is one beer from trader joe's that is pretty good."
"D - This was a pretty good. I am impressed by Trader Joe's cranking out a pretty good dopplebock."
"All in all very well done and for $5.99 you can't beat this. My only qualm is the high bitter units which distracted from the malts rather than complementing them. I will go back to this and has made the top of my JosephsBrau hit list."
"D: A surprisingly good bock-plus from TJ's/Gordon Biersch. Other than the hefty alcohol presence, this is a very good brew. And at that price -- pick it up!"
"Pours a clear, clean ruby with lighter edges. Creamy finger of tightly-packed, dirty khaki head. Nose of plummy fruits, rum-raisin bread, sweet Concord grape puree, cookie dough, and light cooked vegetable notes. Toasted grain and roasted malt at first blush, followed quickly by fruity malt sweetness. Bread pudding and milk chocolate mix in, adding some complexity. Spicy, slightly herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Medium-full body with a slightly syrupy feel. Pretty damn good actually. One of the best Trader Joe's beers I've had."
"D, notes: A fine drinking beer for a cold winter day while watching football. Sweetness does not get in the way of drinkability."
"Pours a dark brown with short head and poor retention. Lacing is non-existent. Smells heavily of malts with the lager background. Fits the style pretty well. Tastes of a sweet roasted malt up front with a slightly sour lager aftertaste. Low carbonation, smooth body, roasted malts stay with you for a while. Overall, not bad at all for a Trader Joe's - easy to drink for a Doppelbock."
"This poured a clear cherry mahogany with tan head. It smelled like strong roasted barley and earthy molasses, with a bit of bitter chocolate. It tasted like molasses and earthy caramel and roasted barley, with a bit of copper hops. It was watery with lots of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a nice, clean malty beer with decent body. It was definitely easy to drink, with no noticeable alcohol. Enjoyable, but nothing too exciting."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, syrupy, and sugary."
"Drinkability: An average bock."
"Overall: Wouldn't go out of your way for this beer...but if your at trader joe's, it wouldn't be a bad buy."
"D: A decent beer. Not one I would look for but one I would drink if handed one."
"You get three fingers of active biscuity tan bubbles from the pour. Fades leaving no lace. Body is a very deep opaque brown in color. Nose is soft and realatively vague but does have some zesty spicy notes along with rustic clay, and burnt molases. Taste is consistant with the nose with added dark fruit including dark black cherry. Dark burnt malt carries some sweetness and over shadows the soft spices. Mouthfeel is dusted with spice and slightly thick. Nicely drinkable."
"This is the way a doppelbock should taste. I wish I had bought more than one. Price was great too (99 cents for a single)"
"Surprisingly, this seems to be an decent version of the style. The first few bottles I had a couple months ago didn't impress me very much, but this is actually pretty solid. The price is right, especially when TJ's is trying to sell off their winter stock for something like $3.00 a six pack. Nothing ""off"" though thankfully, at 7.5% it's held up nicely."
"It's probably obvious: I have mixed feelings about this beer. I've tried two now, and came away with the same impression. It's worth a try, especially at its price point, but I've had enough and will move on."
"Drinkability: Yeah... go for it... good value. Easy to put a few back."
"D - Great if you may be constipated. All kidding aside, seems like Trader used an ill-advised yeast for this concoction. Not bad, but not a doppelbock."
"A good doppelbock that has reminded me that I almost never drink bocks, doppelbocks, or even lagers anymore. Kind of a shame: apparently I'd missed them."
"Certainly not bad for less than a buck (on clearance, of course). Remember it's cheap, but it'll catch up with you."
"part of a bock tasting, this one comes right after another trader Joe's that was a big disappointment; this one will keep my options open for this contract beer. Well done."
"D: Respect to TJs and their braumeister Joseph Brau. Nice that they gave this style a shot. It's $2 less than da Optimator, but if you have $2 to spare, I'd Opt for the German."
"To put it plainly, the flavor is too sweet. It's not necessarily bad, but there's just not a good balance here. Caramel malts and candied sugars overpower any traces of hops, while an ill-timed alcoholic sting coats the sides and back of the palate. Something is just ""off"" about the carbonation level, too, as this beer leaves the mouth dry & sticky. There is a decently hoppy finish, however, but it's far too little, too late. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this beer unless you were looking for a cheap dopplebock to try. For the most part, you get what you pay for at Trader Joe's."
"This is nothing extra special but it is a tolerable, affordable dark beer so that's something right there. Worth a shot if you like bocks."
"Actually pretty drinkable but a tad on the sweet side for me, so I wouldn't have more than two in a row probably. A decent beer, especially for the price and I would buy again."
"This beer had a slightly yeasty aroma coming off a very modest head. The dark amber lager is crisp and subtly sweet. It seems to have potential, but doesn't quite live up to it. It's not a bad beer, but not particularly good either. Apparently this is brewed by Gordon Biersch. It seems like Trader Joe's could do better."
"D: Nice looking and tasting doppelbock. Nothing remarkable but for $5 and whatever a 6 pack at Trader Joe's well worth having around. I could drink a few of these easily."
"Nice, solid effort. Perhaps it lacks the complexity of some of the elite examples of the style, but it still provides that solid malt character that we all know and love. Plus, it's cheap (like all of these TJ brews) at around five bucks a sixer, so you really can't go wrong. If you like malty beers and live near a Trader Joe's, I suggest picking some up. Recommended."
"D: Great drinkability, alcohol is not too strong, and the flavors are not too thick."
"The flavor is not nearly as week as the aroma made me thought it would be. It is perhaps not one of the best examples of the style, but is certainly a good example and much better than others I have had."
"Body is a tad on the light side for a Dopple but there is no trace of alcohol and this is very easy to drink. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel."
"Certainly not bad for the price -- which is true of almost all of TJ's house brands."
"TJ's Winterfest Dark Double Bock Lager is a user-friendly doppelbock that has no shortage of complexity. I don't usually go crazy over the lighter versions of this style, but this one hit me just right. I have no trouble believing that this stuff flies off the shelves each autumn. Thanks for the quality extra, Talisker."
"Trader Joe's is a great place to find little gems like this. At $5.99/6 pack & brewed in style that is usually much more expensive, Winterfest is a very nice take on the dopplebock. Appearance is similar to a carbonated iced tea, but not cloudy. Smell is dominated by roasted sweetness followed by some distinct coffee notes. Taste is like perfectly burnt caramel with a crisp finish that doesn't quite fit here. Mouthfeel feel is well carbonated, but I tend to like more body in this style. An easy drinking dopplebock especially when the price is considered. Recommended."
"Drinks very easy, the best $5,00 a sixer (or 3 .5 littlers) dopple out there? For sure west of the Rhine! This is more like the beer's I expect from trader joe's! If there a TJs here, I'd certainally take advantage of this beauty more often"
"D: For 7.5% ABV, it sure goes down smooth, but the alcohol is too prevalent to be enjoyable in the long run."
"Drinkability- The best TJ's beer I've had to date. Very impressed. Definite bargain for $4.99 a six pack after the holidays on closeout. Wouldn't take it over a Celebrator, but it should be a staple in a every day doppelbock household if near a TJ's."
"Last swigs: El cheapo 6 pack alert! $7 a sixer of 7.5% ABV 12 oz'ers. Wow!"
"A friend recently gave me one of these to try. Trader Joe's Winterfest Dark Doublebock Lager pours a dark, reddish-brown with a thick, foamy head. Beer appears clear, but slightly syrupy, and lacing is well developed. Smell is malty with some sour overtones that detract from the overall aroma. However, there is a very nice caramel aroma beyond the sourness. Taste is very malty, but the overall character is somewhat muted. It's not bad, but I expected more pronounced flavors. Mouthfeel is generally flat, sticky, and unappealing. This would benefit from a little more carbonation. Overall, Winterfest Dark Doublebock Lager is drinkable, but this beer could use a little more flavor and carbonation to offset some of its bland characteristics."
"The complexity is nice, but I just can't get over this mild sweaty quality and the parchedness. Somehow it's still quite drinkable though."
"Drinkability is a big.... pass me something else after one of these. I have had outstanding Bock beers and this is certainly NOT one of them. Sure I would pick this over a Budweiser but not over an everyday regular craft beer like a Sam Adams Lager. Not something I would really recommend."
"Medium-firm pour into a goblet produces a firm, medium-tan head of average duration. Minimal lacing. Poured cold fron the 'fridge, but seems like this one will be tastier as it warms, so I allow it to warm. Brilliant pale brown in color, with minimal (visible) carbonation. Nose is pungent and malty, with notes of iodine, caramel, and ripe red apple. Also exhibits a slightly metallic tang. Sweet, tangy and slightly bitter at first, along with a slightly unctious quality. Fairly bitter; bitterness lingers and does a great job of offsetting the almost intense malt sweetness. Notes of caramel and fruit which are evident in the nose are all but prominent on the palate, and there are some light honey notes that linger nicely, appearing just after the lingering hop bitterness. Seems a little bit thin, but the mouthfeel begins to come around as the bold, fruity malt notes are accentuated by the type of oiliness that I appreciate in this style. Alcohol is warming to be sure, but not overwhelming. Drinkability is very good, even dangerously so. Overall a very well rounded beer, not to mention an absolutely tremendous value. This one's worth buying by the carload. Bottled 11/06/06, sampled 2/11/07."
"This is a good solid $5/sixer doppelbock. It's no Celebrator, but it's enjoyable, if not a bit on the boring side. Make sure it's not too cold when you serve it - it needs to be on the warm side for the body to feel full enough."
"dark cranberry red/light caramel brown. smells of caramel, smoke, alcohol, bread pudding with rum sauce. taste is one-dimensional: a mix of malts, caramel, cinnamon and spice, dark fruits. none of these elements make themselves known above the overly-even blend. slightly bitter on the finish, which diminishes the nice candy sweetness. reserved in the malt department. smooth in the mouth, and medium bodied. drinkable, and forgettable. that said, it's under $6 for a six pack, and a nice way to mix up the winter beer rotation."
"An excellent beer at an even better price. Don't miss it."
"This doppelbock poured into my glass with a chocolate raisin color, followed by a quickly fading light brown head. Smelled of rich roasted malts and sweet bread. At 7.5 percent, this beer packs a lot of punch to accompany the rich dark fruit, sweet, heavy malty undertones, and a low hop presence in the quick finish. A decent medium body fills the beer soul. This beer paired very well with beef stew, and works well with a pot roasts as well...Enjoy"
"Poured a dark redish amber. Good head that feel fast and left a little lace. Smells smoke and caramel. Medium carbonation. You can taste the dark and caramel malt. I couldn't taste the alcohol. It's not bad for a TJ's brew.Mouthfeel is good but a little light for the style. Drinkability is okay. You could probably have more than one."
"Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch off-white head. It smells like caramel and smoke, but not much else as the aroma isn't strong at all. It tastes like roasted/smoked malt, caramel and dark fruit. Mouthfeel is medium and a little bit slick. Drinkability is OK, but not great. It's an OK beer, but there are much better dopplebocks out there. But with that being said I'd try this again, it's not bad."
"Dark brown, traces of light red in color. A light head that dwindles into a non-moving ring that clings to the edge of the snifter. Dark malts, large sniffs of alcohol and some rye toasted bread on the nose. Defines the style from the start. Medium carbonation, thick and creamy Munich malts and caramel coupled with dark chocolate. Roasty malts, traces of English like hops with some chestnut and dark fruit flavorings. Medium bodied, with obvious intense just mentioned flavorings during warming. Very sweet and clean doppelbock, and a darn fine offering from TJoe's! Go get some!"
"A good imitation of a doppelbock, but just that - an imitation. There's no head or lacing after the first few minutes, but the aroma is quite enticing and makes up for the appearance. Has definite bock-like aromas and flavors with rich caramel and a bit of fruit. Mouthfeel is a bit odd, but its still fairly drinkable. Worth a try,"
"The mouth is clingy and medium bodied. This is a great sipper and went well with the hardy food I was having. I did not notice much alcohol, so the brewer did a good job of masking the 7.5%"
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle from batch #WF012, bottled on 10/21/06. Pours a dark, ruby red color - slight haze to liquid. Very small white head - almost no retention. Smells of dark toasted malt - very smoky and even meaty, like a Rauchbier. Tastes very much the same: toasted malt, smoky, hints of molasses. Slight bitterness to it, otherwise very little taste of hops. A little bite from the fizz. Light mouthfeel - a tad watery for a Doppelbock. Easily drinkable, and a good beer - it could just use more complexity to it."
"963"
"I got this as an added bonus on a trade with David Eddie. I poured it into a flute glass and it didn't have very good head and retention. It is decent. It has a great smell. It has a decent flavor with a lot of malts. The alcohol is a little too overbearing but it is fairly balanced for the style. This beer has decnt drinkability, but it is nothing spectacular. I'm still happy that I tried it though."
"M&D - rather sweet and creamy, nice and smooth, especially for a higer ABV, a nice doppelbock, though i am doppelbock spoiled in CT, the land of the LIberator, but this is decent"
"picked up a sixer in Chagrin Falls while visiting family over the holidaze"
"mouthfeel: a bit on the light side of the spectrum, rather creamy"
"Drinkability: It's not my favorite style and it's not a particularly great example, so I'm glad I only bought a single."
"Minimal initial aroma. Poured a crystal clear, ruby brown color with a rich, tight bubbled, lingering pale tan head. Malty with maybe a bit of plum or fruitcake in the up front sweetness. Despite the maltiness, it is not a cloying sweetness. Won't say it finishes dry, but doesn't linger back there forever. And as the beer is very clean tasting and nice, any linger is pleasant. Mouthfeel no more than medium, and is perhaps a little light for the style. However, it is a darn easy drinking 7.5% ABV beer. And at $5.49 per 6 pack, it is well worth a look."
"Slainte!"
"A good dopplebock, but I'm used to something a little thicker (fuller bodied) than this one. But, at less than $6 a six pack at Trader Joe's, it's a good one to try."
"Well done TJ's (or GB)."
"Or banana bread. Seriously."
"The appearance has a medium amber colour to it. The head is light. The smell is hoppy. The taste has a caramel flavour to it, thought it is light that what I would expect for a 7.5% beer. Later on, the taste and the alcohol catch up with you. The mouthfeel is somewhat disappointing. I can only feel the alcohol in it. Considering that this beer was only 92 cents/bottle at Trader Joe's, it is a good deal. I wouldn't go out and get it, however, if someone gave it to me as a gift, then I would accept."
"I wasn't terribly impressed with this one. Poured a clear reddish-brown pretty average for the style. Not much head, but there are some patches of sand coloured foam. Smell is very subtle. There are sweet malts present, but they're so faint. So much of a good doppelbock is great aroma to me. I love the powerful caramel/roasted malt smell that so many have; this is nearly bereft of this. The first thing I notice is a halfway decent caramel malt flavour which is quickly overpowered by a pretty offensive bitter/spicy hop flavour. Quite spicy, actually. This would be a great attribute in another beer, but not a doppelbock and clearly, from what I am gathering, not *this* doppelbock. Mouthfeel is fairly average and on target for the style. Overall, I'm am delighted that I didn't spend money on this thing. As I always say, though, I *am* glad that I was given the chance to at least try it out. Not for me."
"D: A solid dopplebock, espeically for the price. I found some of the flavors a bit harsh, especially when compared to other examples, such as Salvator, but I'm not complaining too much."
"A clear, very dark amber pour with just a bit of tarnished redness at the edges. Very little head from the first bottle at least, though lazy effervescence persists. Nose is stronger than expected and is highlighted by caramely malts with a bit of roastiness. Alcohol notes are pretty noticeable too, invoking something like cherry brandy to me. I was surprised by the hoppy bite of the taste, which offset the malts more than I expect for this style. Mouthfeel is somewhat oily too, but not overly clingy. One bottle was enough for now, but I won't have trouble finishing the six-pack. Not what I expect for a doppelbock, but a decent beer in its own right."
"This beer pours a dark red color with almost no head. The smell is a strange mixture of dark malts and the aura of carbonation. The taste is big, much bigger than I would have expected from a beer brewed by Trader Joe's. Malts are without a doubt the dominant flavor, in fact its hard to tease out any other taste to it. You can tell that the beer would be sticky if it were spilled, if you can imagine what that tastes like. This is a decent beer, and for the price it can't be beat."
"This is a decent beer, but nothing beyond that. A great looking beer and for the price, probably not a bad deal."
"Overall Impression - Rich and flavorful, a very nice example of a Doppelbock. Well balanced, creamy, smooth, easy to drink... and for $4.99 a six pack, this is a hell of a bargain!"
"A quaffable doppel for sure. I'm sure the 7.5% could sneak up on you quite easily."
"This beer has notes of big, toasty malt. sweet, almost chocolately with a nice touch of alcohol. An absolute steal for $4.99/6 pack"
"Poured a syrupy stream into a clean beer glass and imagined some hot pancakes underneath would be a fitting palate-cleanser. But despite its sugary-thick appearance, it produced a pretty head, nice reddish-brown body, and stick my nose in, I smell cherry candy dissolved in oolong tea. Already I feel a bit green around the gills. Into the mouth, it discovers a sweet and peppery amalgam of thick liquid Zantac® flavored with things that don't sound appealing, like rose hips and chamomile. Perhaps if I were a starving monk enduring the days of Lent I might be more charitable towards this liquid bread, but as it is, I need a ham-on-rye sandwich to abrade my tongue and get this strong sweet brew off my taste buds. If this beer review doesn't make sense, i wrote it after full consumption of the 7.5 ABV brew, whew!"
"One-dimensional, but still a good anchor for this style. I wonder how a blind tasting would go. I'm always more impressed with this than I'd expect. It's a solid entry in this style. I wonder if I'm approaching this from snobby level--don't know. Still, I like this dobblebock. For the price, it's superior."
"Dark crimson color with a nice cascading foaming tan head. Not too much lacing. Aroma is yeasty and toasty. A bit of caramel in there as well. Taste is more roasty than sweet. Malts seem to be slightly lacking but there's tons of smoky alcohol elements. Caramel and figs are noticeable and the finish leaves me with a coating of dark fruits but it seems like the malts were all used for the yeast, nothing was left over. Body is medium with medium carbonation. Nice drinkability and definitely worth the $.84 I paid for it. Next time I am getting many more. Trader Joe's is the shit."
"I have a few samples of their other beers to try....it's such a good deal if they're any good at all....and I would like to try a different batch of this..it really was good right up until the finish."
"Batch WF006 08:32. 28 IBU's, according to the bottle. Pours a ruby/chestnut color. Very clear. Very fizzy, as the white head disappears immediately. Lots of streaming bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Roasty, caramel and fruity aroma. Caramel, toffee flavor, very smooth. Very little bitterness. Not roasty or robust enough for my taste. Carbonation is much lower than I thought from all of the fizz. Thin mouthfeel. This falls short of a dopplebock, but does have a good flavor. You can't really beat the price, so this is worth a shot."
"This isn't exactly what I'd call a doppelbock, but anyhow.... Pours out to a dark reddish brown color that is relatively clear. Nice lacing, but lower than normal carbonation. Aromas of malts and chocolate dominate, with some caramel in the background. Taste is medium to full bodied, with a robust overall character. Flavors of caramel, roasted malts, chocolate, and some warming alcohol go fine together, but remain oddly out of place on the palate. Mouthfeel was thin, with a touch of warming due to the higher alcohol level. Average drinkability. Not bad, but not for me..."
"Pours an opaque brown with a nice head that dissapated to a few champagne bubbles. Nose was full of sweet malts, nicely perfumed. Taste is heavy of toasted malts with a slightly sweet small hopped finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than what I would expect from the style. It is decently carbonated and is keeping my palate interested. Drinkability is OK, abv is well hidden. This one grows on you as the heavy toasted malts are very overwhelming at first. Definitely worth a try at this price."
"Jen: Okay, so this is a complete value, although it may lack in originality, it does stand true for a double bock. It has a high roasted malt flavor that is caramelly sweet, but not sicky sweet. A nice level of carbonation accompanies this medium to full bodied brew. It ends with a very mild hop taste; just enough to notice them. For the $$, this is a must have if you live near a TJ's."
"Bottle dated UF001. Pours a half-finger light brown head (like light brown sugar) that quickly settles. Clear dark amber liquid that is a really gorgeous color. Smells caramel with a hint of chocolate and mild bock character. Tastes caramel with a fusel alcohol bite. Dark grains are way underneath and come across as dry cocoa and a tinge of black soured grains. No hops to my palette in taste or bitter. The alcohol is a bit rough and may be hiding them. Md body and modestly carbonated. Nice to look at, but mediocre in taste."
" At $4.99 it's a great bargain, I've gone through a few 6 packs of these. Each time, I only had one of these and moved on. Certainly worth picking some up if your TJ's has it in stock."
"Nice mahogany brown colured, with a large super dense frothy/bubbly dark tan head. The aroma is of course very malty and quite pleasant, with some funky milk chocolate aspects. Good dark roasted malt taste with a nice dark fruity end. Quite good on the palate, smooth with a grt long lasting bitter fruit aftertaste. A good American attempt at a doppel-bock, not as good as most available german examples , but again a great bargain beer."
"from the bottle. poured a reddish brown with a light tan head and no lacing. aroma roasted malts, caramel, sugar, molasses, a little chocolate. flavor, roasted malts, chocolate, plums, brown sugar, some hops. mouth feel was a little thin. but not to bad of a beer."
"D- Not too shabby, this is a sure thing for $5.29 a 6-pack, though after one bottle I feel like I need to switch to something else."
"I don't have many doppelbocks to compare it to, but for my tastes, this is a solid pick."
"Pours a dark mahogany brown under two fingers of khaki head. Nose limps out of the glass with soggy beef jerky and smoke. Taste is smoky and metallic, with some earthy peat and faint baltic prune. Mouthfeel is frothy and thick. Wasn't really a fan of this, the funky jerky just didn't sit well with me. Not sure if it was a bad bottle, but I'm in no rush to seek it out again."
"Overall - reminds me a lot of Moretti LaRossa. A very sweet, malty beer, with a dry, hoppy finish. Very tasty. Highly recommended based on the price and availability."
"Overall: A new addition to the previous staple four Trader Joes Brewing Co. beers that I picked up earlier in the year. I actually enjoyed this offering, not so sure about the style designation but that never worries me, though it may fall short if compared to the moniker by others. More of a Dark Winter Warmer Lager for me, but I still enjoyed it. Get a 6-Pack and not a single."
"Poured a dark ruby color with a small head of tan colored foam that dissipated fast but left some rings around the pilsner glass. It had a light aroma of of only sweet chocolate malts. Typical Dopplebock smell, but was a bit lighter in the smell than most. The taste was strong with chocolate malt and nothing else. Not very complex and good none the less. The mouthfeel was thick, but went down nice and smooth. It didn't even bother to hide its alcohol content of 7.5%. Overall this made for a nice decent cheap Dopplebock that you can get for $5.00 a six pack. This happened to be my first Trader Joe's beer."
"Well not a bad brew, A Trader Jos opened up down the street the other day. This brew was nice, need to check out the others."
"I was amazed that a beer from a grocery store would be so drinkable, but then it IS trader joe's. My wife brought a sixer of this home for me and i ignored it for a few days because i didn't have much hope. After cracking one open and pouring it, however, i decided it looked and smelled quite good. Smell was malty and sour. Had a bit of a bite and was not nearly as heavy as i expected. Probably was too cold at the point when i drank it and i noticed the taste improved as the glass warmed up. Willing to try other trader joe's beers now"
"An appealing beer overall, it's just too light for a doppelbock."
"Overall, a decent offering from TJs- one never knows with this store, this one is OK."
"This was my first time trying a Trader Joe's beer and it's good. The price is really worth noting, as is the smooth 7.5% ABV."
"($5.29 / 6-pack)"
"Pours a deep amber with loads of carbonation streams. Short, quickly thinning head of sandy colored and small bubbles which thins to a brief collar leaving no lacing. Smells slightly sweet and modestly malty, with raisins, plums, and almost jammy. The taste is also initially sweet and finishes with notes of alcohol. Raisins and plums along with hints of clove are also present. Light body for a dopplebock, and a rather thin mouthfeel. Didn't seem quite to style, but was still enjoyable."
"I enjoyed this brew and look forward to another one."
"Subtle hints of plum & chocolate work their way around malty/breadiness. A bit of caramel. Finished off dry with some German hop flavours peaking out - grass & earthy. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. This doppelbock will not wow anyone, however that is to say that it isn't bad. The price can't be beat either! ($5.49 / 6 pk)"
"This is a very good beer from Trader Joe. What would you exspect from a grocery store? The color was a dark brown with very little foam and lace. The smell of roasted malts and hops filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste of roasted malts with a hint of toffee was evident. There was a nice balance of sweet, tart and sourness on my tongue and palate. Not a great beer, but I would say, upbove average. All you have to do is keep an open mind!"
"Drinkablilty is, well, at 4.99 should be okay in my book but this wasn't a very drinkable beverage. I have tried other bocks and they seemed to do this style a bit better. Yes, this would be better than a malt liquor or bland lager for flavor, but compared with it's style, not good."
"Tried one of these beers that my dad offered me from his 6-pack. Poured a toffeish brown/black. Smelled like licorice, with vanilla notes a decent amount of malty sweetness followed by the welcomed bubble of cold lagered carbonation to help the flavor along. Although I wasn't expecting this Dopplebock to be up there withe Ayinger Celebrator, but for a 7.5 % beer, the overall flavor scheme was subdued. Not up to my expectations, but would definetly buy this beer though."
"Notes: I was hoping that this winter-dopple would have some spices,cinnamon,cloves or something but it ended up being just a sub par dopple that has issues all around."
"Pours a dark brown color with a medium sized white head. Little bubble activity. Smells of pretty deep malt and chocolate/caramel. Hits of fruit are also present. Pretty nice aroma. Tastes surprisingly nice. There is a deep roasted malt flavor, definite presence of chocolate and caramel. A bit of hop presence as well. Most impressively there is not any hint of high abv. In the mouth, Winterfest is low on carbonation and high in body and flavor. A pretty bitter kick at the end of the swallow completes its composition. Overall, this is a nice beer from G.B/T.J's. Typical for the style, but pretty smooth and tasty. And did I mention what a bargain it is."
"I'll pick up a sixer next time at the behest of my wife. If there were a value column, this would get a 5 all the way."
