Smoked and dark grain aromas with sweet fruit fruit in the background. Medium bodied, slighty syrupy feel at first, followed by tight, slightly aggressive carbonation. Dark and slighly charred malt flavors up front followed by chocolate malt with dark fruit flavors beneath. Herbal hop bitterness toward the end followed by smoky, tobacco-like flavors and sweetripe fruit. Fabulous flavors and aromas make this an amazing dopplebock.","IronLover","Mar 28, 2013"

Slightly sweet in the taste with caramel and toffee, subtle tones of raisin, nutty, bready, grassy, with a somewhat bitter finish/aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, moderately carbonated, and pretty easily drinkable.","Rifugium","Sep 06, 2011"
4.12,1.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into glass briskly to create a nice rocky off-white head that lasts awhile and fades to cover an bright amber brew with decent lacing. Dark bread, melanoidin malty aroma true to bock character. Brisk flavors of malt greet the palate with light bitterness to balance fades with roast grains. Finishes with bitter/sweet smoothness medium to full body, creamy texture, and an almost lively carbonation. Well worth a taste again. Enjoyed!","outdoorbrewer","Aug 19, 2011"

4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nice looking bock from Victory. Dark brown with shades of amber and a respectable foamy head. Smells of malty goodness. Palate is complex and robust, yet very traditional. Layers of bready malt flavor and a touch of fermented dark fruit are complimented by a clean German yeast that adds to the depth of flavor. Full bodied with a clean finish.

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and subtle sweet alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Wow! Where did all of that flavor come from!? Based on the aroma I would have not expected there to be much going on in this one. It was definitely a pleasant surprise when I took my first sip.

3.22,-20.7,3.5,4,3,2.5,3,"St.Victorious pours a deep, clear maroon. Plentiful cherry highlights shine through when the beer is backlit though. The ivory head rises to about 2.5 fingers in height, before slowing collapsing down the side of the glass. Not much is left in the way of lacing though. The nose doesn't quite hit all the marks of a great doppel, but it's still pretty good. It's an almost even blend of milk chocolate and plummy dark fruits. On my palate the beer gains a slight nuttiness, but at the expense of that creamy milk chocolate from the nose morphing into a more bitter, roasted dark chocolate (which doesn't really work for me int he context of the style). The flavor's also a touch weak and watered down. The carbonation is spot on, enough to cut through the malt, while simultaneously remaining in the background and letting those malts take center stage. The body though is way thin for the style. When I'm expecting a big malt bomb of a beer, there's a certain richness to the body that should come along here, and this beer doesn't even come close to that. I've enjoyed most of the other offerings from Victory that I've had, but St. Victorious ranks as a fairly disappointing doppelbock for me.","axeman9182","Apr 13, 2011"

The nose comprises rye bread, wheat, light cocoa, and light maple syrup. The rye really brings a good amount of breadiness to the aroma. The taste follows the nose pretty closely, with a mild touch of roasted malts thrown in to compliment the aforementioned rye breadiness. The cocoa has morphed into some slightly bitter dark chocolate as well, creating a light coffee flavor in the back. It all comes together rather nicely.

The aroma is where the goodness begins. Sweet malty grains envelop the nostrils in waves. The malt and grain on the palate produce a moist and pleasing mouthfeel. Sweetness rises but is then replaced by dry bitter hops as the beer moves toward the back. The hops provide ample balance to the blast of malt.

A biscuity and roasted malt smell along with caramel (and possibly butterscotch or something like that) with very minor bitter hops. Dry and bready are the first things that come to my mind as I sip this. Medium-to-full bodied, slightly smooth and chewey, has a drying effect that is complemented with some mild sweet caramel and bitter chocolate malt as well as the hops giving off some slight fruit flavors like grape. Sticky on the sides and also a bit of toffee tucked into the sweetness I notice as I drink this; smooth as it warms. ABV complements beer by giving it that strong streak w/o overpowering beer.

Light to medium in body, mouthfeel is not overly heavy and the beer is not overly rich, a little stronger on the hops side than I expected from a doppel wit a decently dry and somewhat spicy finish, but this keeps it refreshing and the light to medium body makes it highly drinkable.

There's also a normal, grainy lager scent. The taste is sweet and malty, with an obvious alcoholic kick. Despite being a lager, it has a bit of a berry flavor to it.

Aroma had some nice toasted grains, and a definite honey presence to make things a bit sweeter. There was also the tiniest suggestion of fruit in there too, maybe rasberries. The honey came through nicely on the taste, with the fruit whispering its presence as well. What I liekd the most was that although the malt was there, it was not overpowering on the taste buds like some of the last doppelbocks I have tried. The body of this beer was thick and syrupy, not quite smooth per say, but not offensive on the palate. One or two would be perfect for me.

Mild bitterness made itself apparent at the back of the palate. Very malty, but not overly sweet. Notes of bread crust, toasted grain, and caramel on the malt side, with plum and raisin rounding out the fruitiness. Alcohol warmth and flavour became integrated in the finish. Medium bodied, actually lighter than I expected, with carbonation that started crisp yet quickly became creamy. Good texture with just a little dryness.

Hints of pepper and ginger. More of the same in the taste, with a fascinating sour note that grows on you. Hops fill in the whole background, bringing long slightly acidic bitterness to the finish. Good round mouthfeel, that along with the smell comprises the best feature of this beer. At 8.5% it's a bit on the strong end of the d-b range, but the taste masks it well, making for a pretty quaffable brew.

Aromas of malt and alcohol dominate with the faint odor of astringent (Windex or other cleaning substance); not entirely appealing, but above average. The taste was rather watered down with little complexity as the malt didn't seem to have any dimensions. The alcohol was present and worked well with the malt. Felt rather thin in my mouth. I wouldn't mind having a few in a sitting, but it's not nearly as flavorful, complex, or interesting as other doppelbocks I've had. To me this was more like an altbier or unbalanced amber ale rather than a member of the bock family.","jaluria","Mar 29, 2006"

3.95,-2.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Transparent brown color with a decided red cast to it. Yellowish head is flat, medium in duration. Leaves very little lace on the glass. Deep malty aroma, slight cinnamon and coffee, ripe pears. Mouthfeel is lighter than some, carbonation is lively and the texture overall comes out at about medium. Starts out with spicey flavor qualities, molasses and elements of tangy mincemeat. The malt component is certainly adequate. What stands out as different is the considerable hop bittering on this one, German in style, very dry with elements of asphalt. Interesting in its balance. Alcohol is moderately well-hidden but noticeable by the end of the glass, and the ashy hop is ever-present in the aftertaste. Maybe what's missing for me is a bit more of a sturdy mouthfeel, and I tend to like the overall impression to be sweeter in a Doppelbock.","ADR","Mar 28, 2006"

A moderate carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Nose is nice and toasty, with deep sweet caramel and lighter figy fruityness in there. Definately dominated by melanoidans, but with good sweetness in there to balance. I like the aroma. Flavor is very full and hits the aroma pretty well. It starts out as a caramel and fig sweetness, but moves very quickly to a light grainey toastyness. There is the lightest of bitters hanging on the finish. This is tasty. Feel is very thick, with a light to moderate carbonation. Its very chewy and almost a touch slick. As far as things go, I don't detect any of the alcohol that is in this brew. I really like that light bitterness that hangs on, as I think it works very well with the other flavors. This one is a winner in my book. I'd have it again any day.","kmpitz2","Mar 27, 2006"

It's big, no doubt, and the ABV comes through in spots, but it would also be easy to ignore, and that might not be wise.

We could make a laundry list of nuances here: herbal spicy yet sweet, chewy, doughy thick malty goodness; toasty burnt caramel and black cherries in the finish, all with a solid undertow of juicy hop bitterness.

A malt monster, but not one dimensional, nice yeast complexity with chocolate, carmael, and slight coffee flavors emerging as this one gets warm. Dried fruits, and figs come into play as well as the hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is really exceptional for a doppelbock and for an 8.5% beer.

It pours a beautiful crimson-chestnut with glowing orange highlights at the base and a creamy yellowed-paper head. The retention is quite good, and holds admirably considering its strength. The lacing is somewhat limited, but that's common for the style; and when tasted side by side with a competing brand, it was quite obvious that the St. Victorious dominated. The nose is rich with soft creamy caramel, a waft of juicy dark fruit, toasty malts, and just the essence of some floral hops. In the mouth it's delicately crisp and then malty smooth across the palate with a dextrinous medium body and fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation. The flavor is very much as the aroma suggests, but with a wider breadth of character that includes a fuller Vienna/Munich maltiness, a judicious amount of alcohol, and a touch of what seems like Beechwood smokiness. The bitterness is restrained as might be expected; and it finishes dry with a light wash of drying alcohol and some lingering bready, and very subtly smoky, malt. Quite nice indeed!

May be too easy, as reviewing it proves to be a challenge since I just want to enjoy it without thinking about the technical mambo jumbo. Somewhat high alcohol content blends perfectly into the drink and packs a nice punch. As the beer goes down your throat you are left with sweet warmth wanting more.

However, I still feel this would be great a year or two down the road as I think mine was pretty green off the tap, not to mention the cold glass. Still, very enjoyable, a great take on the style, and if I can find some I'll definitely buy it and cellar it to see what happens.","asabreed","Mar 24, 2005"
3.85,-5.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Enjoyed from bottle with use by date of Aug 1, 2005. I am glad to see Victory bottling this beer this year. Poured a beautiful deep copper color with large head. Was not initially impressed with first taste, but it began to grow on me as the glass disappeared. Nice finish. will definitely enjoy again","tgbljb","Mar 04, 2005"

3.62,-10.8,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Pours a dark, brown soda color, with a little bit of aged-bone colored head. Nose reminds me of a abv-heavy, sweet, roasted nutty-ness. Tatse boastes an interesting mix of nutty-ness, wine-quality, solid malt, sweet taste, with a spicy/sweet hop finish. Not the most complex dopple i have had, but, surely a solid competitior, that mixes well on several occasions.","PSUDREW","Mar 01, 2005"

4.17,2.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"12 oz. bottle dated best before Aug 1 2005. Pours a clear medium copper-brown color with a beigish-tan head that dissipates rather promptly. Deep, vinous toffee and roasted malt profile with some underlying dark berry and plummy fruitiness. Hops do play a role in the aroma, but are overtaken by the aggressive maltiness. Very rich and flavorful. Further vinous fruitiness shows in the flavor and some toasty malt comes through nicely. Light husky astringency in the finish. Alcohol shows through the hefty mouthfeel, but not overwhelming. A very nice doppelbock (better even than some German ones) from the brewers at Victory.","crookedhalo","Mar 01, 2005"
4.67,15,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability and Overall: A wonderful doppelbock for sure. Smooth and creamy, full of complexity and balance, yet it has enough kick to cure even the heaviest of beer drinkers need for a strong brew. This a warming beer that is one of the best from Victory. I managed to get the only case my local distributor got in, and that was one hour after they got it. Talk about lucky! Well, God bless Victory for making this truly remarkable beer.","santoslhalper","Feb 22, 2005"

4.44,9.4,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: I've never had such a malty beer that drank so lightly. This is amazing, considering that it's up around 9%. This is the antithesis of cloying. This is so nice, with just enough carbonation to keep it on the tip of the tounge, that it is just utterly drinkable, even for a style I've never found drinkable. This is great. This is incredible. I'm interested to see if the bottles are just as nice. I would think so. Make the pilgramage before it's too late.","99bottles","Feb 19, 2005"

4.33,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Had on tap at home - pours a rich orangey amber with a creamy white head. Some nice lacing too. Both parts of the mouth (front and back) are made happy by the texture and the taste of this magnificent beer. Nice malt flavor at the front and a very agreeable dryness at the back. This elegant seasonal makes the year round Festbier seem clumsy and awkward by comparison. Also beware, it hides its 8.5% ABV well. Run, don't walk to Victory to taste it before it's all gone (esp as it is not available in bottles).","stingo","Apr 07, 2004"
4.47,10.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thank you to Victory for sending this gem of a beer over to Western PA. A dopplebock that stands up with Salvator and Celebrator as amongst the best in style. Quite good, and as long as it's around, this will be one of the beers I'll naturally gravitate towards.","beergeek279","Apr 06, 2004"
4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I had this on tap at Victory during the BA Philly Rally. It was the first time that I tried it, and the first double bock that I had for a while. It is a beautiful looking beer with its dark amber color and small white head. It has a malty aroma with the hint of some kind of fruitiness. It seems to have an odd hint of citrus that I didnt expect. The taste is a sweet malty explosion with that fruity rounding at the end that makes it a special brew. The feel is the mouth is one of creaminess, slightly thick. This was drinkable from first sip to last. I had no time for a second but on another trip, I will be sampling again.","rdrummer","Apr 03, 2004"
4.2,3.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"On tap at Victory at the Philly gathering. This really is a gorgeous strong lager. Poured a very clear amber-reddish color and was topped off with a small head of syrupy cream foam. Thick and sweet malt nose, with cordial-like fermented fruit. The taste is full of flavor and complete with malty sweet and syrupy fruit and even some hot cinnamon spiciness. Very smooth and full bodied. Small orange rind bitterness comes through in the finish and remains in the back of the throat. Well made.","pezoids","Apr 03, 2004"
4.37,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Dark mahogany color with an off-white head that hangs around for a bit. Smells of dark malts and spices. Slight hints of cinnamon come to mind as well as plums and raisins. Strong tastes of old aged malts and bits of hops hit the palate followed by a warming alcohol feel that warms the stomach and brings a smile. Delcious tastes of fruits such as plums and rum raisins bring this beer to a nice complexity. Very nice brew.","stewart124","Apr 01, 2004"
4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Marginalia: In a total beer geek moment, and I blame Randall th' Enamel Animal for this, I was able to pick out the rauch malts used in this. It's such a small amount of rauch that you'd be hard pressed to taste it if you didn't know beforehand. I ""blame"" Randall for this since all the other taste receptors in my mouth were still reeling from Randallized 120 Minute IPA. The only thing that I could taste with assured clarity was smoke.","ManekiNeko","Mar 31, 2004"
4.69,15.5,3.5,4.5,5,4,5,"1/2 gallon growler: glowing burnt crimson with a creamy beige head that retreats to a small collar, but leaves little patches of lace on the glass. caramel-dipped candy apple aroma with a touch of noble hops. relatively low carbonation results in a creamy and full mouthfeel. layers upon layers of malt complexity are mind boggling. i taste toasted munich malts, all kinds of fruit, and a caramel backbone. light earthy hops come in at the end to keep things toned down just enough. the drinkability is amazing, considering the style and ABV. the first quaffable doppelbock i've ever had. just fantastic stuff.","pheurton","Mar 31, 2004"

4.62,13.8,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Wow, I tell you what there are breweries out there that claim to be world class, but Victory doesn't have to act, they are the real deal. This authentic German style Strong dark lager or Doppelbock is dead on, pours a ruby deep amber tone off white cream colored head not very thick and doesn't stick around very long leaves behind specks of lace on my imperial pint. Aroma deep plentiful layers of malts supporting a cast of other stars, the German Hallertau whole leaf hops and plum esters. Smells predominantly of fruit soaked in alcohol with caramel malts around the edges, hmm hmmmm good. Flavor is flowing with a wave of malts creating over ripened fruit notes and a touch of hop flavor bringing mild but perfect bitterness to the table, I think I'm in love. Rolls down the palate with a slick slightly syrupy texture and medium body packs a nice punch with 8.5% abv. Suprisingly incredibly smooth and drinkable, I am sold never had two doppelbocks in a row, I had two imperial pints of this with dinner tonight damn good. If this is an option I will pass on Celebrator, Salvator, or any other (insert word here)ator knockoff.","WVbeergeek","Mar 25, 2004"

Drinking it fresh on tap in one of the 0.5L German style glasses in the spring is an awesome experience. The beer is so beautifully malty it almost makes me shed a tear. Then I realize its only available for the spring and definately not where I live currently (Indiana) and I acutally do shed a tear. This beer is overwhelmingly smooth. The malty goodness is not too sweet, not too dry, just right in my humble opinion.","cerevisiaephilus","Sep 08, 2003"
4.38,7.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Creamy, delicious and malty with an opaque dark reddish brown color.. excellent Belgian lace throughout the glass and very chocolaty as well as that kick of alocohol.

4.42,8.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer came to me a brown/copper/amber color that was clear. The head was a cream/light tan color that was not that dense and lasting. Semi-decent carbonation was felt on the tongue. I did not really notice a lace. The aromas that came from the glass were of dark rich malts, dandelions, and some dark fruits (plum, raison) It has a solid rich flavor that was really good. I tasted caramel, dark malts, light cocoa, dark sweet fruits, roasted nut, light earth and some bitter hops (which was not overbearing, rather enjoyable.) This beer is not over powering in any departments, all smells and flavors are well balanced. It left a great feeling in 3 senses; my mouth, nose and even eyes were all pleased. Another score for VICTORY.","Jarod","Apr 07, 2003"
3,-26.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Average for this brewery is a huge disappointment.  I love all of their brews, but this was a shock to my system.  This is the only beer from victory that i have drank and did not want another. 8.5% ABV but is boring in its complexity. I guess I like a bolder taste in a beer this strong. Also it seemed to settle too fast with ahint of under-carbonation.","frank4sail","Mar 27, 2002"
