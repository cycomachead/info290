3.73,2.8,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.75,4,"Poured handsomely and perfectly clear with ambers, mahogany and a burnt orange blush.  Tan head of creamy foam that lasted well.  Nose is shy and subtle but clean. No alcohol.  A demure hint of dark fruits wait elegantly behind a rich and sweet malt. Taste is smooth and creamy. Not as crisp as some of the german dopplebocks.  But this malt does evolve.  It is rich and has a bit of the bread crust.  Supple smooth and medium mouthfeel. Finishes softly with good balance and begins to show a sweet little nuttiness as it warms.  Dark fruits are vague but substantial enough to finish this one with a light sweetness and a hint of brown sugar.","utopiajane","Mar 27, 2015"

The aroma is of caramel, dark fruits with a hint of chocolate. The taste was about the same with some light sweet chocolate nutty finish. Very easy to drink and goes down too easy.

The head pours red-tinged, pillowy, and with staying power - good lacing down the entire glass. I was slightly disappointed with the smell - I could only pull out a vague cherry malt, it was mostly barley and hops. The mouthfeel was good - just the right amount of carbonation, no stickiness or aftertaste, but a tiny bit watery. The taste, however, was superb. I could taste the distant cherry and even honey flavors the beer - I felt - offered, I was rewarded for my random selection indeed. Overall, I was very pleased with the beer - noticed it's high ABV soon after I downed it, and wished I had ordered another one for the road.","jjamadorphd","Apr 01, 2013"

3.85,6.1,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"this beer is far superior to the regular moretti. it pours a beautiful ruby red color with several inches of snow white head. the color is dense and deep, mildly intimidating, and very appetizing. the nose is fairly heavy on the red malt, some caramel sweetness, an alcoholic kick, some dried fruit, and plenty of minerals. the flavor though takes on a sort of bakery vibe, lots of doughy and toasty notes of different origins. there must be a good mix of grain happening here. there is a second or so of sweetness, but it doesn't last thankfully. the alcohol really cuts the residual sugar well, and this beer is in outstanding balance. I like it with pasta dishes, seafood, grilled meats, its really quite versatile. its got a lot of flavor and kick, without being at all filling, which may be its greatest asset. its unique in that way, and better than most euro imports on these grounds. I love the crispness of feel despite the color and size of this, and I like the active carbonation, which keeps it on the lighter side. a rusty aftertaste arises, and like the regular moretti, it is that indelible unique factor that makes this beer memorable for me. probably my favorite regular import from Italy, not counting the specialty stuff.","StonedTrippin","Feb 25, 2013"

This one pours a clear garnet-amber topped by a finger of dusty cream foam. The nose comprises rye bread, yeast, toffee, butter, and a pinch of nutmeg. The taste holds notes of rye bread, blackened (nigh charred) bread, and toffee. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a nearly smooth, but also kinda watery, feel. Overall, I was not impressed at all by this brew, especially if it's trying to pass itself off as a doppelbock. It's not necessarily bad, just really weak.","TMoney2591","Jun 05, 2011"

The taste was tough for me....there is a malt used in Europe that gives beer a nutra sweet flavor...and I don't like it.

Alcohol could be hidden better. The booze bite doesn't blend well into the bitterness. It is also attacking my stomach. Overall it is a bit watery for a dopplebock.

There are toasty hints and a decent amount of hop flavor. Slight metalllic taste. Very sweet and straightforward brew. Nothing crazy going on here. The feel is smooth and slick. After the first time i had one of these i was surprised to find out that it was a dopplebock! The alcohol is well hidden. It tastes more like the combination of a milk stout and a brown ale.","kbnooshay","Jul 08, 2008"

It tastes primarily of lightly roasted malts. I really enjoy the toasty flavor but there is a fake smoke taste also. It tastes kind of like Beggin Strips smell. Mouthfeel is interesting. Different than about another beer I've had but I cant really describe it. I don't know if Ill pick this up again. There are some good qualities to this beer, but a couple really bad ones to.

Sweet and malty, with a little toasted barley. It's clean, with no fruit esters at all. The beer gets a little bitter right before the finish.

The ""make your own 6 pack"" shelves at my local store were fresh out of it, so I opted to try the Moretti Doppelbock instead. As beers go, it was good; as a Dopplebock, it likely fell short a few notches. The color was a dark ""Dr. Pepper"" red brown in the glass, with a surprising amount of carbonation. Thin mouthfeel and a faint, dark malt and alcohol smell as you raise the glass. A good Dopplebock will not usually hit you in the nose with alcohol so quickly. This one did. And the moderately thin mouthfeel didn't do much to make it better. I was expecting a much more balanced taste, but the alcohol seemed to almost overpower the flavor.

3.28,-9.6,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"The beer pours a very pretty ruby-red to medium-brown color, and the cream-colored head disappears quickly. The aroma is all about the caramel malts, and it is what really drew my attention to it when I first had it at the old Como Inn in Chicago. The flavor changes quite dramatically with temperature. At food-fridge temps, the sweet malts dominate, to the point of giving a sticky-sweet cola-ish impression. If yours is served that cold, give it 10 minutes to warm up. Once it gets a little warmer, the hop bitterness has a fighting chance against all those malts, aided by the alcohol warmth and dryness that starts to gets some traction. This beer never escapes all that sweetness, but it is more balanced at warmer temps. It comes into its own when paired with minestrone soup, dishes with marinara sauce, and other tomato-based courses. If you are happy with a sweeter beer, this is very drinkable; only the sweetness (and eventually the physiological effects of the higher ABV) will slow you down.","MillRat","Dec 09, 2006"

No doubt that the box that I bought was old, so this review will reflect the much fresher version. Pours a glossy brown color with little to no head. The smell is big, with mostly dark malts dominating the nose. The taste is interesting, but overall really big: the dark malts are apparent but also a taste of candied sugars which give it a sticky taste. Also there is a hit of chocolate and/or coffee in the end of it, with a hint of alcohol. Really a terrific beer that is well crafted, seek it out if you can.","Toddv29424","Dec 08, 2006"

A decent dopplebock but a little heavy on the amber malt and showcases little else. Too one dimensional. Also, a lack of texture (and the failure in the flavour department) makes this all too macro-ish. No doubt, this is just as close to a ""red"" as it is dopplebock. No character, simply 'lager'.

Pours a dark cranberry brown color with a stead cascade of tiny bubbles fueling a one-finger tan head that fades slowly leaving decent lacing and a solid ring of foam. Nose is very sweet and malty with a hint of raspberry. Taste is extremely malty, like a malty, sweet caramel candy. The malt is sweet but not overpoweringly so, and soon fades to moderate hops. Mouth is creamy and smooth, with tiny, unobtrusive bubbles. Drinkability is very good: its smooth, good tasting, and goes down easily.Overall: I recognized this beer almost immediately as a dopplebock.

The rustic aroma is very pleasing with some raisin-like accents. This is definitely a malt-accented beer (hopheads run away!) with tawny caramel malt flavors that linger on the tongue. The silkiness of this beer is reminiscent of a fine liqeur, with just enough dryness to prevent a cloying character. This beer may be categorized as a dopplebock, but I think of it as more unique than that, sort of a Northern Italian strong red lager, as it doesn't seem as dark as other dopplebocks that I've sampled. Perhaps I'm being too technical. This beer is an old favorite of mine and I was happy to see it in the cooler at my local Italian deli.

Tastes quite malty, caramelly, chocolatey, and the same fruits that are present in the aromas. Full rich body. Carbonation and alcohol keeps the beer from cloying or thickening.

The finish is dry with a lingering toasted maltiness that is lightly astringent. Overall this beer is a celebration of malty notes.

There is only the barest taste of hop flavor mixed in bu the malt is very quick to dominate. Clean finish with no esters the 7% alcohol leaves the belly with a nice warming sensation.

Good malty character in this one, I will probably have it again, but I may not search it out.","Bierguy5","May 26, 2004"

We don't need no stinking hops. Upon sipping this beer, a powerful malt sweetness envelops the tongue, massaging it with roasted malt, caramel, and molassses flavors. There is some earthy bitterness on the finish, but it's just as likely to be from the roasted malt as any kind of hops. The alcohol releases a bit of bitterness as well, with definite alcohol notes in the aftertatse. There is also a slight hint of oak-tainted malt that lingers around as well. The mouthfeel is good, but not as powerful as the flavor deserves. This is a very drinkable, malty dopple. Even what are normally referred to as ""hop burps"" are tainted with roastiness.

Ripe fruitiness hits the nose at first, then is followed by medium caramel and toffeeish sweetness w/ a light toastiness.  Trace herbal hop nose. Predominantly bocklike aromawise, but there's an unexpected, slight, but pleasant tartness that persists as an undertone in aroma.  Flavorwise, this brew is lighter than the rich aroma implies.  The dominant malt contribution is from moderate caramel malt sweetness, with basemalt Munich adding toastiness. Hop bitterness is above the norm for style and offsets malt sweetness sufficiently to lend a polar balance since there's no hop flavor.  Moderately bodied, w/ an agreeablely smooth mouthfeel.  Finishes with a fading mix of honey sweetness and mild hop bitterness.  La Rossa is a stylistically odd, but intriguing and tasty brew.  It is reminscent of a doppelbock / American Amber hybrid.

A little thin in flavor and body however, bringing those marks down a bit.  The brew still remains rather drinkable however and is one that I wouldn't pass up at an Italian place if they were offering it.","Murph","Sep 05, 2002"
3.43,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Dilemma: do I review this beer as a doppel, or as an Italian beer? As a doppel, I'd have to say it's merely average (which is not bad, mind you!). As an Italian beer, however, I'd say this is exceptional. Deep red/brown, with a nice thick head. Smell is malty as heck, quite sweet. Taste is a bit thin, and perhaps a little too sweet for my tastes: brown sugar, caramelized fruits. There is a certain out-of-the-oven pizza aspect to this beer that I find intriguing, though, and it does go really well with pizza and pasta with red sauce. Do you think they planned it that way? I won't necessarily go out of my way to find this beer, but I will order it occasionally when I'm eating Italian, and maybe I'll serve it at my next pizza party. Ciao!","mophie","Aug 27, 2002"

4.3,18.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The best beer I have found imported from Italy and while there for two weeks and several cities not a drop of this to be found. Very disappointing, apparently only made for export. Good head, carbonation, dark but not chewy can be savored (the ABV is 7.2%) year round.","jdhilt","Jul 16, 2002"

3.74,3,3,4,4,4,3,"A double malt (doppio malto) in every sense of the term - this beer is strong from the malt (7% ABV) and sweet from the malt.  Dull caramel color, no head.  Malty aroma.  Full mouthfeel, the taste starts with alcohol, moves to caramel and finishes with butterscotch.  Pretty much what you would expect with this much malt.  Unless you've got a real sweet-tooth, you probably won't drink many of these.","Aesop","Jun 26, 2002"

3.95,8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Nice ruby color with a creamy head.  Sweet aroma, loaded with malt, and caramel.  Rich and sweet, creamy caramel, bitter chocolate and molasses.  Hops are well balanced with the malt.  Finishes slightly dry with a noticeable taste of alcohol.  If you like malt, hopefully you'll like this one.  Skoal.","ThreePistols","Jun 17, 2002"
4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice light brown or ruby red color with a good off-white head that dies after a bit, leaving a thin lace. Heavy malts in the aroma and on the palate, dark malts, caramel, slight toffee, and hops which create an ever so slight bitterness...the 7.2% is hardly even noticed. This was a very well balanced brew, and very enjoyable a DB from Italy...","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 08, 2002"

2.56,-29.5,4,3,2,2,3,"I was not particularly taken with this beer.  Nice fruity front, but then it kicked into a candy-caramel malt sweetness that dominated any other flavors.  For such a malty beer, it seemed a little thin.  Nothwithstanding the big alcohol content, it seemed less like a bock and more like an Irish red.","Brent","Sep 06, 2001"
