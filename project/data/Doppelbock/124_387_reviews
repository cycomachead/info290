"500mL bottle served in pub glass.  Beer pours orange amber in color, and somewhat cloudy, showing evidence of bottle fermentation.  Sweet, fruity aroma, a little plum.  Flavor is on the sweet side, too, finishing with a small dose of German hops, but not at all dry.  Fortunately that rules out any of the chalkiness sometimes associated with bock beers.  Also the alcohol is not at all present.  The parallels with a English Barleywine are somewhat remarkable: raisin, stone fruit, molasses.  But this high gravity beer is unmistakably german.  Easy to drink, but I'd prefer the former."

"O: a well-crafted doppelbock that hits the marks you'd want from the style - a good frame-of-reference beer, and for fans of the style, no doubt a solid go-to lager"
"Pours a reddish brown with a two finger tan head.  Aroma is dark fruit and molasses.  Taste is also dark fruit and molasses, with a slight  rye bread character.  Mouthfeel is medium, would like a bit more feel.  Overall a very well done dopplebock, one of the go to's for the style."
"O: Very impressed with this beer, really balanced, nice caramel sweetness up front with some bitterness and dark fruits mixed in. Really good. The aroma is not as good as the taste. This is my second dopple bock, the first was Ayinger and this is just as good."

"Had this over at my bro's earlier this week. The base sweetness paired quite well with the German-Style dinner of Glazed Ham and German Potato Salad."

"500 mL bottle drank as part of a BJCP tasting group (Category 5: Bock) on 01/14/2015, poured into a snifter glass and drank over 15-30 minutes"
"Great tasting double bock!! Will surely drink more of this."
""
""
"Overall, decent but not spectacular dopplebock."
""
"Very solid doppel bock from Paulaner... exactly what I would have expected."
""
"i just tried this for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  Reminded me of a Belgian.  Very smooth and sweet, but the maltiness does eventually feel heavy on you.  If I am gonna have just one beer this is a good one.  Very satisfying."
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Totally okay, but not great. I seem to taste a lot of chocolate or something similar in this."
"Great beer, smooth great character"
""
""
""
"O - An elemental brew.  Doughy and sweet, delicious."
"An OK German, almost Belgian in style. Very strong body. Nice malt aromas."
"It is one of my favorites it turned me on to dopple bock. When the income tax refund comes in gonna get me some. Its not so expensive, I'm just el pooro."
""
""
""
""
"Extra smooth, deeply flavored doppel bock with a balanced sweet maltiness & toffee flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To demonstrate my lack of lager experience, I will say this compares to a Belgian Dubbel in its maltiness and sweetness (obviously distinct yeast profiles). More to dark sugars than dried fruits."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The perfect German beer- good stuff."
""
""
"Side note: poured on draft at the new Fassler Hall in Oklahoma City, OK. It's an good beer, but would pass for other dopple bocks."

"Nice little gem that surprised me.  I am a fan of malt and this one hit me very well.  A lot of malt but it really comes across as light and drinkable.  I was really surprised that is was 7.9% ABV, it did not come across as that high.  Full of flavor but very smooth and drinkable.  Excellent beer that I hope to keep in my regular rotation."

"O: A good example of the style. Tasty, but a touch sweet... if that were toned down just a bit it would go from very good to great. Still worth a try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great bier overall. Great head with minimal lacing, nice dark amber color and not bitter by any means. Smacks a bit of like an ""oak"" flavor if that makes any sense to you. Full bodied, great flavor and nice going down. With a alcohol content of  7.9% by volume, it only takes like three to make an excellent nightcap to the end of a long day. I've been living in Germany for about a month now and have lots of biers that I've yet to sample but, that said, this has become my most favorite regular brew for now."

"Great doppelbock."
""
"Overall this is a great Doppelbock. I had a Weihestephan Korbinian last night which likely taints my palate, and this does not quite stand up to that or the Ayinger examples. Nonetheless, this is a very solid and excellent beer, but not quite up to its fellow Munich counterparts."
"Warm and malty. Great copper color.  Smooth.  Biscuit and bread."
"Decent, but not my favorite"

"Good beer..a tad low on the flavor chart..but overall..a well brewed beer.."
""
"Extremely smooth beer to drink. Very light mouthfeel for being a bock beer. I felt like there were strong caramel notes and it finished with very little ""alcohol"" taste. One of the most drinkable beers I've ever tried, which is scary because it's 7.9%"

"Bread, malt and caramel dominate. A silky smooth texture adds character. A solid dopplebock for sure."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy pastel orange with subtle honey hues in it. A fat head of tan foam that is slow to fall. Nose is malty. Brown crusty bread. Rich dry malt that is expansive on the nose. As the beer warms a hint of chocolate comes forward. Light caramel sweetness underneath There is a dark fruit presence. Some prune, raisin and a faint whiff of alcohol. Taste is malty and rich. breaddy malt, dry and crisp. The middle of the drink is fruity. The edges have some grassy hops in them and the finish has a touch of medicinal alcohol. The alcohol dries out the palate and the malt lingers with a light bit of that caramel sweetness. A bit of bitterness comes from grass and form alcohol to finish this one dry. Lighter mouthfeel than some dopplebocks but medium and full enough. Slight warming from alcohol."

"Overall- Great beer and while heavy on the malt it works perfectly. Incredibly drinkable especially at 8%, which could make this a little dangerous. Definitely worth a try, and I know Ill be getting this again. (90/100)"

"O: Very enjoyable and a very good example of the style - nice complexity of flavor and just enough sweetness without there being too much sweetness and it getting cloying. Alcohol is well hidden making this one pretty easy to drink."

"O - When I first had this many years ago, I was blown away. But after having many other great doppels, I may not be able to rank this right at the top. But without a doubt, it is near the top of this style. I'm never disappointed with Salvator, and I'll keep coming back to this outstanding beer again and again."

"very nice smooth drink. looks good in a pils glass, dark red/brown amber, and an aroma of olive, earth, dark fruit, brown sugar. taste has a good balance of hop bitterness with caramel, vanilla, cinnamon, bubblegum, peach compote, lemon lime finish. Smooth bodied and well carbonated"

"O - solid doppelbock. It may not be the best option, but is a good choice if it's available and looking for something sweeter"
""
""
""
""
""
"An easy drinking OK doppelbock in which the alcohol is well hidden."
"O: Great Doppelbock - in the same league as the popular German ones - Korbinian, Celebrator."

"O: Like I said in the taste section, I don't like the big sweetness on the finish. But let it warm up a little and it mellows. Besides that, it's big and full and has a lot to offer."
""
""
"I love this beer its so clean."
""
""
""
""
"O: I find this doppelbock a bit too thin for my taste. It's somewhat one dimensional characters leave a bit to be desired. The bitterness is about right but it lacks the malty hit I like to see in a doppelbock. Overall I would choose this over any mass market product and it does fit the style, just not as exciting as I would have liked. May be one of the few doppelbocks I;ve ever tried that I would almost consider a session beer. I like it."
"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/2013. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, pear, plum, apple, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance of malt and fruity yeast notes with solid complexity; and good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, plum, pear, apple, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, pear, apple, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish. Nice balance and solid complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice doppelbock. Good balance and solid complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
"O: My favorite bottom fermented beer. It's a malt bomb, and for a long time it was my favorite beer. If you like malty beers, this is the beer for you."
""
""
""
"O - a classic doppelbock; not as complex as Augustiner Maximator, but certainly a must for any German beer novice. Historically, its the first ""goat"" beer in Bavaria and it certainly holds that distinction nobly today."
""
"O: Very nice under assuming dobblebock. Enjoyable, could easily toss 3 of these back without thinking too much about it. Smooth, little on the sweet side, but bland enough that most could handle it. Bready sweetness to give the beer geek a bit of fun too."
""
"O: Strong dark cherry scent and flavor, great warming accumulation that lingers longer than I like, a little lighter than body than I like, but overall pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ruby with a massive head, lots of lacing left on the glass. Sweet biscuity, nutty aromas. Thick on the tongue and very sweet. Bananas with hints of spice and some toffee. Some alcohol on the finish. Thick and chewy with lots of nutty, bready sweetness."
""
"O - Malt lovers rejoice! This. Is. Exceptional. Paulaner's Salvator is one of the kings of the doppelbock kingdom and for good reason; perfect malt balance so as to not be overly sweet but still keep a fuller bodied feel that washes down with delicious bready complexity and a smooth finish."
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer. Not my favourite style though."
"Prost!"

"Overall: Pretty awesome take on the style from this classic brewery. Definitely having more of these in the future."
" This is an excellent example of the style and one that I would seek out again and again."

"O- A quality brew. This beer is perfect for the style as it has the strong malt backbone coupled with a low bitterness level; the drinkability may also be a result of the bock style doubled."

"o: A wonderful Doppelbock and a perfect early autumn brew which would hold its own or outdo just about any Octoberfest beer I've had. And just the sort of malty change of pace I was looking for after the sour-fruity Grassroots Arctic Saison I drank earlier."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: ah a nice example of the beer. Not too strong and alcoholic a deffinate find and try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a good beer, probably best enjoyed on a winter's night."
""
""
"O: A solid doppelbock, but it lacks the defined complexity to be a great one. Would drink again, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a decent beer, some characteristics were a little off. A little too much roast, a little too syrupy."
"Overall, this is a beer worth trying- doppel bocks can be hard to find around here. However, a local brewery (Bayern in Missoula) produces some bock beers which are better than this one."
"O: Very nice indeed. However, it's quite sweet and mollycoddling and not something I'd have again without food."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, there is a reason that people think Salvator when they think doppelbock, This beer lives up to its reputation as a quality, delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I actually really liked this beer. Then again, I am easy when it comes to malty beers. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Overall: I was really excited to find this at my local store, but it is a very, very poor example of a dopplebock. I certainly will not be buying it again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a lighter amber color and not darker as I see other double bocks have. Has a thick head that dissipates quickly with nice lacing. Aroma is of a caramel-toffee with some malt. Not heavy on the carbonation which is good. The taste wasn't bad but the higher alcohol content made it taste stronger than maybe it should be. Overall it was a little better than average but not as good as others in the same category."
""
""
"O: A malt driven beer with some dark stone fruit character, on the paler end of the Double Bock style so a touch of hops aroma and flavor are in there. A very good example of the style, although this bottle it a little old it is still a wonderful beer."
""
"The taste is sweet and very malty, like munich malt, which offers a big mouthfeel. The beer is very malt oriented and bitterness is almost absent. This makes the beer a bit unbalanced and overly sweet. I expected more from this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A beautiful beer, but I can't get over the aftertaste and alcohol burn. Just not very good at all for me. For the record, I love Ayinger's Doppelbock."

"O - A bit disappointed, as I love doppelbocks. Certainly not a bad beer, but nowhere near the flavor as other quality DB's I've had. Flavor itself is decent, but not nearly as complicated or intense a flavor. Also didn;t taste the freshest, so I will try it again. Not a bad beer, I just feel there are better beers of this style."
""
"Remarks: Although a pretty decent Doppel, I don't find it as tasty as my standby Andechser. Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Pours a clear, dark reddish orange, with a thin, super creamy tan head. Aromas of freshly milled munich malt. Taste begins with some green apple, then some sweetbread, then a bit of aged wood, finishing with a spicy hop finish. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall an excellent Dopplebock!"
""
"Overall. More please! I'm happy that I enjoyed this more than Celebrator because it is cheaper!"
"O: This doppelbock is disappointing. I can't say that it's without it's own charm, but the booziness is overbearing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a very good doppel bock to have. Quite a treat! Won't be surprise if it happens to be one of the selected standard doppel bocks. This doppel bock was paired with spicy lentils and basmati rice for lunch to create a sweet-bitter balance, but it was such a caramel treat that I think it also would have been better had for dessert. This is an overall great doppel bock for the cost and is very satisfying. My only negative with this doppel bock was the too high alcohol content. I'm a lager type of beer drinker that branch out from time to time (hey, change is good), but I never drink to get drunk so would have appreciated a lower ABV. This one definitely hits you hard without tasting like it would so consider yourself warned (unless of course you like it that way)."
"O: Overall I thought it was a good easy going Doppelbock that anyone would find pleasure in drinking. It's a beer that can be had at any time during the day without feeling too heavy. The flavors found a nice even keel."
""
""
""
"O: Good beer, probably one of the standards in Double Bocks these days, good but a bit too much booze on it for 8%, good and drinkable but there are better ones out there"
"Overall: It's not my favorite Doppelbock but I like this beer. The aroma is nice and the flavors are sweet without being cloying. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming. It isn't sticky or syrupy like many other beers of the style. An easy to drink, enjoyable beer."
""
"O: i would REALLY like to grab a fresh one of these in Munchen ... i bet it's knock-you-over good. what i got here ain't bad at all; a little mediciny but not overly so. i love malty lagers, and this is a great malty lager with loads of taste and character. the ABV isn't kidding ... 7.9% or plenty to get you going."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very drinkable doppelbock. Probably a little underrated. A little bit of the taste comes through in the nose as the beer warms."
""
"I like it, but it could be so much more and really should be."
"Always liked this one, though not a huge fan of the style, and I certainly recommend it, even if you also are not a fan of this style."
"It really lacks carbonation and a round mouthfeel. It's a too thin for me. Quite disappointing."
""
""
"If I were judging this beer by its accuracy to style, I would give it a low rating; it lacks the many of the attributes that a doppelbock should have and possesses some that it shouldn’t. However, it is still a very tasty brew that I’ve bought many, many times and will again."
""
""
""
"Overall this brew disappointed a bit with the taste which is a shame because the smell was good. This is still a drinkable brew and it does down nicely at the end of the day."
""
""
"A pretty good Doppelbock.I think I am starting to open up to the style a bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good beer. It's affordable and a good example of a doppel bock, but I am not down with the corn taste. I will, however, score this beer fairly high because it seems to meet most of the requirements of a doppel bock and is, for the most part, pleasant. I'm going to say an average of 4 may be in order."
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Average Bock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid Doppelbock, even better it gets a bit cold. This is a good example to differentiate between a doppelbock and a lame malt licquor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very rich, deep barley malts, brown bread, caramel, toasted, spiced rum, touch of molasses. Bitterness is very mild. Soft, semi dry finish. Body is full, a little syrupy, warmth, smooth, easy drinking."

"Overall: Alcohol is hidden well and the caramel comes out well. A pretty good brew."
"alcoholic feel is definitely there."
""
""
""
"This beer commands immediate respect by asserting a brawny ego and aggressively pushing the senses. It makes me wish I could drink more than one of these so it wouldn't think I was lame, but in this case the heavy sweetness is a little overwhelming. I definitely recommend trying this beer"
""
""
"D: a solid doppelbock. plenty of flavor for a lower abv doppel brew. for the availability, definitely worth picking up."
"As the beer gets warm the alcohol aroma and taste gets stronger and a bit unpleasant. I prefer drinking this one cold, why not?"
""
""
""
""
"I am disappointed, with this German product."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good beer for a few sips, but halfway down, the booze starts to kill off other flavors in my mouth. Worth trying however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an amazing beer."
"Overall this is a great beer. If anybody tells you otherwise, they have probably had some amazing hookers."
""
"O: I honestly can't decide if I like this beer or absolutely love it. At the moment, I expected something a little easier to drink as that's what I'm in the mood for. Give me a chilly night after dinner and this would be the perfect sipper. A truly great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- It's a good beer. It'd buy it again in a mix-your-own 6 pack, but i don't think i could commit to a full 6 pack of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Good doppelbock, on the lighter side, but wasn't bad. Would get again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure how this is the original doppel - Perhaps in alcohol, but not in body. Ayinger might have this game locked up for best doppel. Even Weihenstephaner's Korbinian is miles better."
"O: A good beer that has great availability. It's s solid competitor for a go to dopple bock. The aroma when cold was awesome cause I was over whelmed by Whoppers and I love Whoppers. Anyone who doesn't really doesn't exist and I would rather not ever see them. Anyways this is a definite have to try. Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This beer was not a bad beer, but if you're a fan of big, malty, rich doppelbocks, prepare for disappointment. Nevertheless, it has some unique qualities (the dark fruit is interesting and almost Belgian quad in style) that make it worth a sip."
"Overall- Not that good... was expecting much better."
""
""
"Overall- Probably the worst Doppelbock that Ive ever had. The overly sweet flavor with zero balance and a watery mouthfeel."
"Thin offwhite head that doesn't stick around. Copper body with slowly rising bubbles. Smells of sticky caramel and alcohol. Taste is brighter and more acidic than other doppelbocks I've had. More apricot than plum and chocolate. Mouth is low in carbonation with sweet, acidic tingling."
"surprising - this drinks so f'n easy and clean - has close to the ideal drinking profile of a doppelbock, if not the exact color or flavor that immediately comes to mind - haven't had another beer like this..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This delicious brew goes well with just about anything. Alone, it's a wonderful nutritious treat. With food, it's an amazing complement. This is a beer that one must taste to truly behold the wonders of Paulaner. I am a huge fan of Paulaner. Their Oktoberfest, their Original, and their Hefe are quality brews---but their Salvator--the ORIGINAL DOPPELBOCK....brother it's on a WHOLE other level!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Many Doppelbock brews tend to be overly sweet but this one is wonderfully balanced. It is good to know the father of the style still brews them right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This dark lager is sweet, malty with some spices and little toffee as well. It’s smooth tasting and pours a creamy head. Oh, by the way, a Salvator will pack a punch. This is no summer-time-grilling-burgers-hopping on the riding lawn mower lager. This beer is alcohol heavy and meant to warm you up on a cold Bavarian night – and it does the trick nicely. The flavor of a Salvator goes really well with a good steak or any other food with substance. It’s a great ski lodge brew and I heartily recommend it."
""
"The original doppelbock doesn't disappoint, though nor does it thoroughly blow me away. I don't think I can fault the brewery for that; after all, craft brewers have had a great deal of time - and motivation - to explore, and possible improve upon the original. I have enjoyed this brew a great deal, and will so again I'm sure."
""
""
""
""
"Good stuff."
""
""
""
"When I had this beer for the first time I really couldn't stand it. It seemed to me it's just to strong and this alcohol strength dominates the taste. Second time it had more to offer. Would recommend to drink it slowly, not to be too cold and to leave it a bit in the glass so it loses a bit of alcohol aroma. It's brown with nice head which doesn't stick around for too long. It has interesting taste with touches of bitterness and toffee. Still a bit sourish ending and strong alcohol feel."

"tastes a tad sweeter, and artificially so, than the last doppel i consumed but it's still a worthy drink. salvator is a standard to which we can measure a doppel."

"A well made doppelbock, but not quite as thrilling as others I have had in the past. It's still a good one for beginners to the style, and perfect to crack open for those wanting stronger maltier beer as well as pumpkin-tasting beers when actual pumpkin beers aren't in season. For the price, a good run-of-the-mill pick."

"Overall it's not bad, nice malts, lots of tasty toffee and caramel, a bit syrupy, nice wheat and banana like flavors, a bit boozier than it seems like it should be, but otherwise a nicely done typical German doppelbock."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear dark golden with a quickly dissipating off-white head. There are plenty of visible tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. There are aromas of sweet and bready malt. The taste follows the nose. The beer definitely tastes like liquid bread with toffee. There is some back end bitterness. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is smooth. This is a good sipper. This is an excellent beer."
"This is a classic beer and a must-have for springtime drinking. Every beer drinker owes it to themselves to try this one at some point. It lacks the complex maltiness of Ayinger Celebrator, but I kind of like the slight winy quality this one has. It gives it a personality all its own."
"Overall a good beer. Initial taste is fizzy floral that fades into a tinge of malty alcohol, but it's a smooth finish. Slight bitterness, not a hoppy beer. A nice slight dark roast that I'm tasting on my 4th sip. Definitely a sipping beer and would probably pair good with a grilled chicken breast and red potatoes."
""
"Very warm and alcoholic with a medium-low amount of carbonation."
"Overall: Solid, but not my style."

"O- Pretty darn good doppelbock, its on the lighter side of the style of beer and I find that to be rather refreshing."

"O: Good doppel back.This beer has been around for a while so they seem to have it right."
""
""

"Overall: very poor mixture of off caramel, overripe fruits and some kind of unpleasant sweet flavour that smells and tastes like decay. Such an unpleasant beer. Add to that it is AU$85 a case (2012), and this is one of the worst beers I have had, ever. Poured most of it out. Avoid, avoid, avoid!!"
""
""
"This is a very easy to drink beer. I would say that it tastes much lower than the ABV. If I wasn't careful, then I could become very drunk on this beer very quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Blech. Way too much heat for a beer that's only 7.9%. This is the kind of heat I expect for beers over 11%, and beers that strong have other flavors working for them. If I wanted to drink heat, I'd order a shot."
"It is also fairly boozy, even though there are lots of other tastes going on. I think I am done trying to do this one. There are better more modern alternatives."
""

""
""

"Not bad. Not the best. I still give that edge to Celebrator!"

""
"Overall – This was a decent brew, a solid representation of the doppelbock style. Although this is certainly not one of my preferred styles, I can still write a pretty objective review. Nothing about this beer really stood out, had I not taken notes when I drank it I wouldn’t remember a thing about it. Underwhelming. Although I would drink it again and would recommend trying it, I can spend my money on much better things."
""
"Tasted: 5/25/2012 Bottle best before: 9/12"

"Classic doppelbock. Not as good as Celebrator. Better than Optimator. Must try. 4.0"
"A good enough doppelbock. Doesn't break any new ground, yet doesn't disappoint. A journeyman effort in this style and well-done."
""
"Salvator starts off pretty good and improves as it opens up. Definitely one to let warm."
""
"Overall: Fine beer but not totally impressing, I have had better doppleboks out but this definitely won't disappoint. Salud!"
"Nice solid Doppelbock, but after trying it again I don't see any reason to buy this when I have access to Celebrator and Korbinian."
""

"Poured a medium tanned thin head which it made a reasonable attempt to retain. Dark amber colour with a slight haze. Smelled very boozy, all other aromas were blocked out. Tasted dark chocolate, hints of plumb and caramel. Had a very long boozy finish. Thick texture, almost chewy, some gas. Overall very boozy, a bit too much."
"this is one of those beers that this rating system does no justice to, because by these qualifications, it doesnt really stand out, but when taken as a whole its one heck of a great beer. pours a less than amazing looking brownish red, with a small and rapidly fading off white head. smells like tons and tons of german malts, also a very interesting ale yeast. flavor is what i love here. tons of malt body, earthy springtime flavors, but no sweetness or any of that syrupy extract feeling so many big bocks have. thats why i love this one, its heavy and full bodied, but its also very drinkable despite its sturdy abv. normal carbonation and a very round finish. i think this is my favorite doppelbock out, its strong and satisfying without being sweet and tummy turning. deserves better scores i think."
"Poured into my trusty old pint glass. Nice color. Kinda between golden, brown and reddish. Smell wasn't the best Taste of chocolate. Went down really smooth. Overall not a bad beer. Great for a thirty day after mowing your yard kinda beer. But got to love this beer"

"O: This was a really good dopplebock. Well balanced and enough alcohol to make it interesting."

"Overall- Pretty good for the style. I have always been a fan of all the bock styles(Bock, maibock, dopplebock, etc.) and this one ain't half bad."
"with a medium light weight for the style. Quite drinkable with a nice dry finish a good balance overall. Alcohol shows itself a little strongly at times but a nice balance for the most part. Feel is lighter than you expect nut enough to feel in wprthy,A good solid take on the style. Nice malty flavors"

"Uber sweet, almost sticky sweet smell. Body is solid amber with small white head. Honestly it smells like a super sweet Munich Dunkel. I was hoping for more roast, some dark malts, maybe some balance, but nope. Dry grains (it definitely feels grainy like GLBC) paired with dry sticky caramel. Im guessing that the theme of German starkbier is burnt caramel sugars, because it dominates here like crazy. Opimator is much, much better."
""
"This is less cooked than I anticipated, and the flavor profile is much different than other Dopplebocks I have encountered. The malt profile is interesting, but it also lacks depth. The fruitiness adds an unexpected layer, however."

"Overall a very impressive beer with a really good blending of malts, fruit and sweetness which made this a wonderful tasting experience..."

"A good drinking beer from a pilsner glass that stands up to a cold, wet day. I enjoyed it with cheese and crackers."

""
"Poured from 11.2 oz. bottle into pint glass. Pours a hazy deep caramel color with an 1"" of beige head that disappears rather quickly. Smells of apples and caramel. Big bready aroma. Taste is pretty good. I typically don't stray from the mainland too much but I saw this in the mix six section and thought what the hey. Smooth as can be. Mild carbonation. A good beer."

""
""
"O: Good beer. I'm on a dopplebock kick lately before I brew my first sometime this spring, so I wanted to try the origin-ator of the style. I didn't get any of the salty, soy, meat aspects others did so not sure what's up with me or those. Definately would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice aroma and flavor, but a bit too much alcohol heat considering the abv."
""
"It would be good paired with a meat dish, however, this beer was not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark copper orange in color with a reddish hue and excellent clarity. Poured with a short off-white foam that quickly dissipated. Sweet toasted and caramel malt aromas along with raisins and ripe fruit. Full bodied with a smooth buttery feel and rich, lazy carbonation. Toasted and caramel malts up front that quickly get overcome by sweet ripe fruit and raisin flavors through the middle. Floral hop bitterness emerges toward the finish as the toasted malt once again returns. Finished semi-dry with a light floral hop bitterness."
"Overall, it was an ok beer. It wouldn't be one of my first choices."
"Sesame seed aroma, soy sauce. Low carbonation, low hold and low head. Amber color. It was a pretty sweet beer overall. It was a pretty sweet beer in my opinion. It was very malty slightly roasty with a caramel finish. Not bitter at all and no Hops aroma."
"This was a dark amber colored beer. The aroma was that of soy sauce or sesame. It was a complicated sweetness. I was not too fond of it due to the savory aroma. There was little carbonation in the beer and almost no head on it. Heavy on the malt, no hops. Caramel-y. Medium mouthfeel when drunk."
""
"The words that best capture this beer are complexly sweet. The beer is very malt-heavy which contributes to this savory sweetness that is apparent in the aroma and flavor. I immediately get sesame and caramel on the nose, there are virtually no hops in the aroma. I would almost compare that caramely richness of that heavy malt to a Dr. Pepper (sorry, I have really strange flavor analogies). A very engaging beer in terms of flavor/aroma wise - but its rather weak body and mouthfeel don't make it exceptional in my books."
"O: Very good example of the style. Considerably more flavor than the aroma suggests. Strong finish. A bit boozy but typical for nearly 8% ABV."

"Overall: Tasty, dirt-cheap at between $2.00 and $2.50, and readily available. Oh yeah, and the best-by dates are clearly marked (unusual for European imports). That being said, there's not a ton of depth here, just some toasty Munich, dark red fruit, and a hint of nuttiness. I'd rank this a solid B and perhaps, considering the price point, even up to a B+. I'd definitely pick this up now and again."

"D- Pretty good strong beer."
"$8.99 for a 6 pack in Atlanta, GA."
"I thought this beer was great. A great darker German beer with the classic German soul that make German beer my favorite. Even with that feel to it, it manages to stand on its on. This is a beer I would keep in my fridge and have available for when I want a solid German Dark Beer. I believe it trumps the Spaten Optimator, and I had the Opimator on tap!"
"Notes: This seems like a higher gravity version of a Marzen. Malty, sweet but with a real warming from the alcohol in the belly. I like the dark fruit flavors in my Doppels and this has none of that. Still this is a good beer and supposedly the original Doppelbock."
"D-Very easy drinking; however, I was looking for a slightly more complex malt profile."
"T: you get some sweet notes, then there is a bittersweet taste on the end, the alcohol presence is noticeable, warming."
"This is a great stripped down dobbelbock that has a very pure flavor with a malty sweetness and rich chocolatey feel. It is sweet, but not overly so and there is a slight disconnect between the sweetness and the phenol flavors that become more noticeable on the second bottle. The head is smooth and consistent and compliments the slow drinking character that the beer offers. This is a safe bet when looking for a solid Bock to accompany a hearty meal."
"On tap at Pilsener Haus in Hoboken. A classic, traditional German Doppelbock I have drank many times in bottled form. It’s a hazy dark orange/brown colored brew with a smallish head that falls pretty quickly and leaves decent lacing. Rich aroma of alcohol, dark malt, and dark fruit (figs, prunes, plums). Sweetness is evident in the nose as well as the taste. This sweet flavor is offset by a mild alcohol presence, a bit of yeastiness, and lots of fruit flavor. Wonderfully complex with excellent biscuity malt. Carbonation is fairly low, with a very soft, rounded mouthfeel that’s easy to drink and has just the slightest amount of creamy stickiness. Medium-full body. I’ve always enjoyed this beer in the bottle but the draft version is noticeably better and more complex, with flavor subtleties that are easier to pick up. A must-try for doppelbock fans and a good warming beer for a cool evening. Big but not over the top. Very tasty."
"The beer was way up ahead on taste too. Rich, smoky and sweet malt panning to a bittersweet end with almost everything in between. A lot of caramel and toffee, plums and figgs and yeast breadiness made it a mouthful. Just about the right amount of carbonation made it buoyant enough to be engulped within no time. This beer was a real screamer, and by the end of the 500 mil, I was feeling pretty happy. The 7.9% hides well enough under the guise of high drinkability to set you in motion."
"First off I am reviewing this beer as i had it on tap. I have had it in a bottle before, but the draught is amazingly better! The bee`r `pours a dark maroon-brown color and has the look and feel of red wine. The beer has practically no carbonation, which is awesome and smells of a hint of red wine, bordeaux possibly and goes down smooth with a hearty dinner. I am very impressed with this beer as it is exponentially better on tap. If you see this on tap, try it!"
"Found a six pack for about eight bucks which seemed reasonable. Had tried once at the airport in Seville and was okay with it then so I have it another shot. Nice dark orange brownish cloud free pour into my Tusker pilsner glass. Slight head which went away quickly but laced mildly. Rich malty smell. Taste is not overly complex but pleasant malty breast flavor. The high alcohol is somewhat masked. Medium body for a beer that is supposed totaled me through Lenten fasting. I imagine I would be rather imbibed if I did not eat and relied on this for sustenance but overall a pleasant but non sessionable beer."
"O - Enjoyable beer, nicely balanced, good, rich, deep dopplebock. Very drinkable. The head failed, but that my ahve been me or the glass (at a party, no proper glassware)."
"The taste is very sweet and figgy with an aftertaste of sour fruit and hops. It's a pretty good beer. Very fruity. Not what I was expecting for the style, but delicious nonetheless."
"Not as dark or complex as other varieties, but tasty and easy drinking nonetheless. Can't say it's my favorite DB, but it's price/quality ratio makes it a nice six-pack choice when in the mood for one."
"I would make this my go-to beer, were it regularly available."
"Overall: Paulaner continuously delivers and is a great brewery. This is one of their beers that keeps you coming back. Its almost as interesting as a quad, but somewhat more drinkable in that it's abv is lower. This is a beer that I would say you can truly taste the freshness of the grain, which isn't necessarily attractive like a fruit metaphor, but it's more accurate. THis is just a solid beer. Buy it."
"O: This is a great beer for the price. I paid 8 dollars for a 6 pack and it is nice tasting. I will def buy it again."
"Overall: After the very nice, sweet aroma, I was expecting more of those sweet caramel and toffee notes in the mouth, but this was fairly mild and quickly gave way to alcohol. There were no solvent flavors that made it unpleasant, but this held me back from a higher rating. The lack of clarity is also inappropriate (if BJCP grading) but didn't take away from the enjoyment."
"Pours a thick two finger off white head. The color of the beer itself is amber. No visible carbonation. Nice lacing. The smell is of malt and soy sauce with a hint of toffee and hops at the finish. A touch of alcohol is present as well. The taste is malt dominant. Very little hops present, but still a strong hit of soy sauce. A very good Dopplebock, would gladly purchase again."
"M - Has a medium body--honestly I'd prefer something a little thicker for a doppelbock. Good carbonation. Sweet syrupy feeling left after each sip."
"The beer pours a medium hazy brown color with a large tan head. The aroma is toffee and biscuit malt with a little bit of dark fruit. The flavor is very malty. I get a lot of toffee and caramel malt with some dark fruit and grass from the hops mixed in. There is a nice grape flavor, as well as some warming from the alcohol. Very easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall this is s decent Doppelbock but comes across kind of one sided with spicy, boozy flavors dominating. It could use some more hops or deeper dark malts to also help balance the flavors but the simple grain bill here leaves a lot to be desired. ""A meal in a glass," not really, there are much better and more balanced and more full flavored examples available. One and done for me."
"D - Very nice beer that exemplifies the style. You probably can't drink too many of these in a sitting, but it's well worth a try."
"Dark amber, nice clear. Real nice to nose. This beer is real good to the mouth. Smooth, with a slight hint of creamy finish. The taste is not offensive at all and leaves you wanting more. Will go well with any German meal. We think a good weisswurst would be the best friend to this beer. Overall this is a good beer that stays within it tradition."
"Overall: A very tasty doppelbock, I'm not a big German beer fan, but this was very drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy opaque brown with a small short lived tan head. Aroma and Taste of toasted dark caramel malt, sweet dark fruit, dates, yeasty, with some sweet alcohol esters and hops. Medium to full body with nice carbonation and a lightly creamy texture on the palate. Finish is toasted dark malts, yeasty, dark fruits, dates, ending with a sweet fruity alcohol taste with a slightly bitter ending for balance. Overall a good, flavorful and enjoyable brew."
"If you like doppelbocks and quads then you probably already know this one. If not, you've been missing out. Although you hopheads out there probably won't appreciate the caramel malt flavor explosion, I think most folks can appreciate the delicious malty flavor and great aroma. It pours out a caramel color with decent carbonation and lacing that persists for a few minutes. The smell is somewhat seasonal with hints of nutmeg, fig, raisin and bread. Once it touches your lips the malty flavor hits you like a ton of bricks, which makes it much fuller bodied than about anything I've tasted short of Ayinger Celebrator, Chimay Grand Reserve, or Aventinus Eisbock. Considering it only costs $2.29 for a 16.9 oz bottle (at 7.9%) it's cheaper than Coors Light (by alcohol volume), and it tastes better than all but the top ten beers on Earth. You absolutely cannot get a better beer for that cost. Hands down best bang for the buck, and delicious."
"Salvator has a caramel-brown color with the pour, initially a medium-sized tan head that doesn't stick around for very long. The smell is a great malty one, like you're baking bread. Taste is a sweet malt bomb, with hints of fig along with the alcoholic presence. Fairly dry finish. although over time it seems to linger more and more in my mouth. One of my favorite Doppelbocks."
"O) This beer drinks smooth and has a sweet caramel malty taste to it. A bit on the high end to be a session beer but very easy to drink. A good double bock."
"Solid beer. Good flavor, just not complex enough to be world class."
"This was one of the most enjoyable malt-focused beers I've ever had. Although its somewhat fuller in body, its low bitterness, toasty character, and light carbonation makes this a pleasure to drink. There's a reason they've been brewing this for hundreds of years! I think it'd be great to pair with food too."
"Overall: What I look for in a doppelbock: crisp, rich, and oh, so German. Fraulein, fetch me another one, schnell!"
"The aroma is better around 52 degrees. After that the alcohol really pounces on things. The flavors were good but fell flat of what the nose describes."
"I'll have another one."
"Overall - This is a very good representation of the dopplebock style. The higher alcohol content (7.9%abv) makes it go to my head a little faster than I'd like. However the overall sweetness, and drinkability make up for that. I wouldn't call it a session beer (unless you aim to be hammered after your sessions), but you could easily put down a few of these and be quite content."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Not the best dopplebock in the world, but it's still solid. I'd say it's worth a shot."
"Aroma is malty with a fruity undertone and just a hint of spice. It pours a clear cola brown with a respectable light tan head. Flavor is quite strong, malty with undertones of spice and apple. Texture is fairly smooth and tingly, and it has a fair amount of body. Definitely worth seeking."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass, deep orange pour with a moderate white, sticky head. The aroma is full of yeasty sweet breads. The beer is sweet, bready, and it has a lingering sweetness. The body is full, good carbonation. A nice doppelbock, smooth and easy drinking."
"I like it. It's really hard, probably, to not like this beer. But the more you drink it, the more generic it feels, and the less it seems to offer. I want it to be better."
"Medium amber brown body, white head, quick dissipation with minimal lacing, on the light end of hues for this usually darker beer style. Nose features some sherryish esters and big malt hit, caramel, burnt brown sugar, not much in way of hops, a little floral. Taste is fairly complex, apple esters, more raisins than prunes, molasses. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side of medium, alcohol fairly noticeable. not sticky. Did this side by side with Celebrator, and to be honest this paled in comparison, re color and especially flavor-wise. Pretty good, but no world beater."
"Will try again."
"Lots of nice things going on in this flavorful Doppelbock. Another good selection from the German section. After the fact, I realized the fruit aspect reminded me of the strawberry Christmas hard candies that have the seed wrapper and a jam-like filling."
"O: I really like this one. Malty sweet but not to sweet, just enough alcohol to cleanse the palate to make each sip taste like the first. a real nice balance of the booze you know it is there, but it does not taste like 7.7%"
"O: Very enjoyable and would recommend. Great Price as well."
"Light roasted malt smell. Good taste with a bit of sweetness. The 'extra' alcohol give the beer an extra bite but for half a liter this is a bit too much, i drank 90 percent of the bottle and then got bored with this beer. This however is on the better beers you can find in Germany, not THE best but pretty decent."
"I think it might pair well with some desserts, owing to its sweeter flavours. I think it would add thinging interesting to a creme brulee or maybe a cheese cake with a caramel topping or something like that."
"Not awfuly but not one of the best doppelbocks I've had. Lacks complexity and a darker malt character. The sweet caramel malt is a bit cloying."
"The appearance is a copper red color, some haziness caused by the yeast, with an off white / light brown head. The smell is of sweet malts, mostly caramel. Mouth feel medium thickness. The taste is of double sweet caramel malts with slight hop bitterness and an off taste bitterness as an after flavor. Overall a decent beer, I'm only just now starting to like these higher malts beers, I'll be sure to try it again in a few months as I acquire more of a taste for them."
"Purchased in a 1pint bottle. Nice amber pour with head that disappeared almost immediately. Not a lot of aroma to it but what was there was nice. Hit the tongue very smooth and has a nice feel. Very smooth finish with the perfect mix of malts and hops. I was surprised at how easy this beer is to drink."
"Pours out a caramel/brownish red color with maybe a one finger head that vanishes FAST. Not sure if it's my nose, but I don't get much of a smell off this beer. Maybe a slight hint of grain, but I'm not getting much. The taste, on the other hand, is phenomenal. Rich malts balanced well with the spice of the hops, with a small kick from the slightly higher abv make this a pretty damn tasty dopplebock. I would definitely drink this one again, AND share it with friends."
"This poured out as a nice dark brown color with red highlights, the head was thick and tan in color. The smell was sweet with malts, there wasn't much of a hop aroma at all. The taste of the beer had a lot of caramel malts and some roasted malts in the mix. The mouthfeel of the beer was a little thick, the body of the beer was about medium leaving a good feeling in the mouth. Overall this beer was quite enjoyable. "
"Overall a decent beer but I don't think i'll get it again."
"Hazy deep orange, one finger off white sticky dense head, dissipates quickly. Smell is big and malty, sweet caramel and toffee, biscuit, grassy hops are there deep down. Taste is malty, sweet notes of toffee and caramel, long lasting bitterness present throughout, alcohol notes are there but not too strong. Medium-full body, syrupy at points, full weight, med-high carb. Not bad, solid stuff, enjoyable but not the best for the style."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Generally a very tasty beer, but not heavy like some other high-alc beers."
"Poured a pretty 1.5"" ecru head and had a hazy orangy amber body. The smell was mildly malty but as the beer warmed it came out more. Flavor again was mildly malty, and a moderate richness was reminiscent of some barleywines I've had. Taken by itself it's a good beer, but placed among the ranks of double bocks I personally think it was too light colored and weak to be among the top in that style."
"o: This is a pretty good doppelbock that is very attractively priced. Even so, I don't intend to revisit this one. There are too many better examples out there."
"Given the ABV, it is hugely drinkeable, with no noteceable alcohol... (!)"
"Something that I'd drink again if the price was right and available locally, thanks liamt07 for knocking this want off my list"
"Regardless, I LOVE this beer. I would drink this every day if I could afford it. (Speaking of that, I wonder how we are going to afford 1001 bottles of beer. This might get interesting!)"
"Dr: The ABV presence it the biggest issue with this beer, but at 7.9%, it's an issue I can deal with. I wish the mouthfeel allowed the flavour to linger and come out more."
"Overall - not an overly strong beer IMO, it has a strong emphasis on the raisin/metallic portion with a good amount of dryness."
"Overall: Another OK beer from Paulaner. Not a first choice for a dopplebock, but a decent beer."
"O: Paulaner Salvator Doppel Bock is a mediocre beer, bit of a disappointment, barely recommended"
"O/D - Sadly I won't be revisiting this on tap. The bottled version was great but this seems quite plain and almost like a chore to get through. You could have a few of these casually but to sit and focus on it isn't worth the time."
"Taste-A good Doppelbock, one a done beer, maybe two because of sweetness. After drinking an Optimator last night, I definitely prefer that over this in the battle of the Munich Doppelbocks."
"O- This is kind of a malt bomb, but it's interesting and powerful and I think I'll have another."
"O: Will pick this up again if the mood strikes for a sweet, sipping beer with moderate body. Would recommend to those exploring the Doppelbock style."
"D: Highly disgusting. Drank about 3/4 of it and had to pour it down the drain."
"The beer is syrupy, but very drinkable.just what you would expect from a good Bock!"
"I can't compare this to others of the Bock variety because this was the first one I've had. It was enjoyable but not something I'd seek out again in the future."
"Poured into my NB mug. A somewhat hazy ruby amber color with two finger head and lots of carbonation. Smells great. Figs, dark cherries, plum, and candied sugar seem present. Tastes thick and syrupy. Lots of chewy caramel & bready malt flavors in the taste. Hints of chocolate & cocoa. Very nice complexities. A little thick, or heavy tasting, due to the heavy malt flavors. A great sipping beer. I love bocks and this one sure measures up!"
"Overall not bad, but a little sweet. I couldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting because I'm already feeling it from just this one. I will probably have to pass on this next time, but glad to say I've tried it."
"Overall: A decent version of a bock."
"Very enjoyable beer for any day of the year. Full of flavor and aroma. I'll be back for more soon."
"I honestly don't really know how to rate this one. Its different and not bad but my best description would be lightly carbonated syrup with 7.9% abv."
"Pours a hazy reddish-amber, with about a finger of head fading fast. Has a soft biscuity, caramel aroma that fades with the head. Somewhat creamy, with a modest amount of caramel, some mild fruit overtones--perhaps apricot and banana, and a hint of peppery alcohol. Smooth and sweet throughout the swallow, with a dry, slightly bitter finish. While it lacks prolific complexity, it is overall very enjoyable, and worthy of your taste buds."
"Not buying a bottle of this ever again."
"Upon tasting, i experienced a little deception. Very syrupy. Not quite complex either. Honest, at most. The beer was however 1 month past its ""expiration date""."
"Doppel Bocks aren't as common as they used to be; this one is well worth a try as one of the originals."
"Yes, it’s really worth a try but maybe a bit too sweet sometimes."
"cloudy copper goat pours into the handled. Smells of sweet malt, the faintest of alcohol, some toast, and a bit of vague fruit. The flavor is nice, mostly malty sweet alcoholic joy, not thick, just desperately pleasant. Cold and warm, it was delicious and damn sexy. Definitely a keeper, a bit of a sipper, but you need to slurp to enjoy appropriately. Preferably with your fly down and your compass out."
"Quite a nice brew, and quite flavorful, though my bottle (not past the ""best by"" date) seemed a little too heavy on the malts for my taste."
"Sweet but not overwhelmingly so. The low carbonation level allows for smooth consumption. A large imbalance of malts and hops in favor of the malts, but expected for a dopplebock. Overall and enjoyable brew"
"O - Salvator is a solid dopplebock. For an import, it is quite reasonably priced (I believe the bottle was about $2.60). I'm sure I'll enjoy this brew again."
"It's quite good. I'd put it in the top tier of doppelbocks, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite."
"D: For a higher ABV beer this is very drinkable, though perhaps a bit sweet for my tastes. A great example of the style, though certainly not the best in it's category. I would never hesitate to turn one down and I often seek this out when I'm in the mood for a solid doppelbock. Cheers!"
"Overall Drinkability - Flavor is a little off, so it's an interesting beer, and I'd recommend a friend tries it. But definitely not a session beer and probably not even a come-back-to beer."
"RJT"
"I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! So cheap, a 2.50 bucks a pint, wow. And so much better than many beers I spend easily twice that amount on."
"not as heavy a flavor as some other doppels but quite enjoyable"
"Taste is malt and more malt. Rich and full that showcases near perfection in crafting. Low hops but a bitterness that is balanced well with the sweetness and alcohol. Smooth drinking and I recommend this highly especially on tap. One really can't get better than this doppel. Clean and crisp finishing."
"Very good doppelbock. Hazy copper orange body with a sizable head that leaves minimal but some lacing. Big Crystal malt smell here. Big on the dark dried fruit aromas, figs/prunes. Little bittering hops noticed, Slightly boozy, but damn tasty. Very heavy body and totally a hard hitter. A big sipper."
"D: I still love this beer, but it's not quite as good as I remembered it. My tastes have changed, for sure, and I think I expect more out of beers now. It's still very solid, and a top tier doppelbock, but not up there with Celebrator, for example. But I'll certainly go back for more!"
"Pretty easy to drink other than the finish."
"So mad I only bought a single! On a side note, the date of the label is 07/09."
"D - Delicious, but I don't think I'd go for more than one in a sitting, due to the heavy body. Liquid bread, this one."
"The aroma on this sucker is awesome. However, the flavor is not nearly as complex, with the alcohol playing too much of a role too quickly. Nonetheless, still pretty damn good."
"Poured from 16.9 oz bottle into weizen glass. Purchased on sale at Beers of the World for $1.58. Saw that it was past drink by date of 1/11 but decided to roll the dice because it was so cheap. A somewhat cloudy brown caramel color with roasted malt aroma with a hint of banana. Tastes of roasted malt, brown sugar,some fruit. Very happy with this purchase- will have to try fresher sometime"
"Pours an opaque-ish copper. A tan head soon rings up (nicely tho). Smell is all sweet toffee and brown sugary malts. Taste is defintely more roasted, and skews into a nutty, acrid feel at the end. A sharp, bitter aftertaste. Drinks OK, but this is a hearty, fulfilling beer that also masks its alcohol well."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a bit of a copper hue. There is a single-finger light tan head that sticks around for a bit before falling and leaving a bit of spotty lacing. The nose is pretty plain with a bit of sweet malt, bread, and caramel. Nothing too much in addition to that, and even those are pretty faint. The taste follows along the same lines--there really just isn't that much going on and I'm not impressed with the complexity of this one. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit too much alcohol in the finish. Drinkability is okay, but nothing I'd seek out again."
"Overall-I really think this is one of the first bock beers I've really liked. I'll likely buy this again, the 'german' hop/yeast taste is there but not overbearing as with some of the lagers. I'm impressed..."
"Poured from the bottle a amber hued orange with an off white one finger sticky head that disapated into small clouds that remained for the beer. Smell was bready and malt heavy dominated by sweet caramel malt. Taste was smooth malt all the way through very sweet but not too sweet loads of caramel and maybe munich malt. Taste reminded me of a bigger maltier negro modelo. Mouthfeel was smooth and sticky heavy in body due to the amount of grain in this beer. Drinkability is superb for a 7 percent beer that I can't wait to have on a summer cookout!"
"I had a 1pint.9oz bottle into a pint glass."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed sipping my way through this one and while its not my favorite doppel bock I'd certainly be willing to have it again. The second half of the beer was also a nice compliment to the Pub Egg coated in ground venison which I had for lunch."
"It was actually better than most bocks I had in the pass. Would definitely have another."
"D. Lovely stuff. One of the best German beers around IMHO."
"Overall I give this beer an excellent. This is a great example in its class. Outsanding job great beer!"
"D- Very easy to drink. I love this style and this is a great example of it. I'm just biased to Troegenator."
"From notes: Fairly clear, dark amber, cider-like color. Starts out with a cream colored head with unique orangey highlights, but it recedes quickly leaving nothing behind. Aromas are sweet caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and cherries. Flavor is dominated by the caramel malts, but everything else in the aroma is detectable on the tongue. I also picked up some peppery spiciness on the finish, and maybe a little dark rum as well. Very little hop character, as is to be expected. Sugary and sweet."
"Drinkability: The dilemma: this is a beer you want to keep tasting, but the flavor is so intense that you will need a break. Then if you do go for more than one, the alcohol gently taps you on the shoulder as if to ask, ""Are you sure about this?"" Excellent example of the style, one of my favorite doppels."
"This beer hides the alcohol well, it's complex and balanced, nothing overpowers."
"O: When I lived in Germany, I drank a ton of Salvator. Now I wish I had access to it for $1 a bottle like I did there. Immensely complex and flavorful. Just be careful, it'll creep up on you if not careful. My clear choice as the winner of the Doppelbock Shootout."
"D - nice and easy to drink, especially the curiosity to find other tones of the dark fruits in the body"
"I liked it. Not as much as Celebrator, but a very good Dopplebbock nonetheless."
"Poured a golden orange/reddish, with a healthy head of a couple fingers. Light retention and minimal lace. Nose of candied sugar, toffee; very sweet overall and hard to pin down stuff in the nose. Taste contains more of the same, and almost resembles a candied apple in some forms (both candied sweetness and some light fruit/apple notes?). A slight bitterness is found also in the back of the mouth. Quite warming overall, and appropriate for the weather round here now. Bit of heat on the back end, but a good drinker."
"In my mind, and excellent specimen of the double bock style. Assertive in flavor, but not at all a flavor bomb or out of balance. I forgot how much I liked this beer, and I hop to never again forget. Definitely grab one or two - but not more - and enjoy."
"It is a most satisfying beer. I like it best in cold weather, but would never turn it down at any time of the year. It is the best of bock beers."
"This is definitely my favorite doppelbock. Being one of my favorite beer styles, this doppelbock is one of the top brews I have ever had."
"D- the beer went down with ease. at this price, i can see working it into my regular drinking circle. i think the fact that this is readily available at all stores and is so cheap makes this less appealing to people than it should be. a solid example of the style."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, dry malt and a small hint of fruit. In the taste, dry roasted malt, small fruit hints and just a hint of alcohol. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry malt and hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. Hides the 8% quite well and quite easy to drink."
"This beer pours a hazy dark amber color with a finger off off white head that doesn't linger very long within the glass. The aroma is a little different than anything else I have had to this point. It is very sweet and vegetabley. The taste is similar but starts with some butteriness... Which isn't great. The mouthfeel and finish are very smooth."
"Drink - This beer reminded me a little bit of the Floreffe Dubel I had a few nights ago, but I think I preferred that one more. I'm still happy I tried it though."
"No, but not because I didn't like it. The doppelbock style is simply overcrowded with tastier competitors."
"Pours a nice, solid amber color with a quality head of fluff and good lacing. Overripe fruit in the nose, quickly followed by a sweet and malty fragrance, then a waft of alcohol. It has a very creamy, strong malty and sweet flavor at first sip, while being almost chewy in texture, with interesting nutty and ripe fruity notes that seem to make their way through the alcohol presence in spurts. No noticeable hop appearance that I could make out, just malt, malt and more malts. There are some very faint yeast notes that come through at the end of each sip, followed by a moderate amount of carbonation that tackles the larynx. I'd say the body on this one is med/heavy at best, very thick and creamy brew, chewy and delicious. Highly drinkable and filling."
"D: Good beer. Not the best doppelbock, but good substitute."
"Very drinkable, fairly smooth taste. The ABV is very deceiving."
"D- Its a little sweet, one is plenty so drinkability goes down a little."
"With the staple characteristics of this style being sweet, syrupy, and sticky, it seems easy for its interpretations to get a little out of hand, for Paulaner however, they kept everything in check quite nicely. From when I first started drinking ""good"" beer to now, the LCBO seems to have only improved in their quality of offerings and this beer attests to that. In the mood for a Dopple? This one should easily satisfy."
"Overall, the best thing about this brew is the unique fruit flavoring throughout the taste profile. While many doppelbocks take on dark fruit flavors, very few of them are able to incorporate and blend them as well as Paulaner, making for a Wunderbar experience all around."
"This is definitely my favorite doppelbock. Being one of my favorite beer styles, this doppelbock is one of the top brews I have ever had."
"not highly drinkable due to the alcohol content...and ""dark"" taste it has"
"Decent head, darker amberish in color. Smelled heavy of german wheat. Would probably go good with some pork, saurkraut, and apple sauce. Definitely not 'salavating' over this beer in my opinion, but it's not bad. Has the look of a belgian dark triple (i.e. bornem) An okay beer, but definitely nothing to write home about, but then again i'm not a huge fan of german beers in general."
"Pours a medium redish amber in color with a pillowy off-white head that lasts. This beer has just a touch of haze to it. Aroma is of sweet grains and toasted grains. Flavor is well integrated, and is dominated by toasted grains. There are no chocolate notes with this beer that are common in other brews of this style. The alcohol is very well hidden for a 7.9% abv beer, and at this high of an abv, this beer is amazingly drinkable. Available in six packs, this is one of my go-to winter beers."
"Drinkability: a tasty and drinkable doppelbock. It's a bit alcohol-forward, but I'd definitely drink this beer again."
"Upon pouring I was under-impressed with this beer because it is the lightest dopplebock I've seen, even my wife thought so. There wasn't must for aroma but some malts. For flavor the was some slightly sour hops with plum. It's fairly smooth but that very mild sourness stays with you. I'm definitely not impressed here."
"D - Another reviewer referred to this aspect, along with mouthfeel, as (I do not quote) one of the last or secondary things to consider. Not me. The sum of this beer's parts add up to a little bit more than the whole of its pieces. Overall, for the price and smoothness, a very drinkable, highly prized doppelbock. Try it."
"Worthy of the ""liquid bread"" reputation, this is a favorite and paired nicely with some smoked whitefish and chips."
"Drinkability> sure. I'd love to try it on tap sometime... let's head back to Munchen...."
"Clear, reddish brown with a creamy tan head that leaves plenty of fine lace on the glass. Sweet,caramel apple and raisin with a distinct tootsie roll quality and warming alcohol in the finish, good stuff. Full bodied and highly carbonated. A simple yet complex brew that is really smooth and drinkable. One of my all time faves for the style."
"D: Not my favorite doppelbock. As it warms the alcohol begins to become more noticeable, but it's still good enough."
"Drinkability. This is a very drinkable beer."
"Bottle. $1.99 for a single. Pours a slightly opaque carmel copper color with a minimal white head that collars around the glass. The nose is fruity, caramel, toffee, and a slight biscuity. Almost has an artificial banana smell as well. Medium mouthfeel. Now, this is a pretty sweet beer, maltwise. Caramel and biscuity tasting with a slight bitterness to it in the end. For 7.9% the alcohol is pretty hidden but as this warms you get a slight warming effect in the end."
"MD- Thick and creamy like it should be. It goes down easy . i am a fan of this style and would probably try it again, but there are a few others I would choose first."
"Overall/notes: This might be the first beer where I'd give credit of success to the ""residual"" categories: mouthfeel and drinkability. On first glance and scent, I was really shrugging this one off as another, middle-of-the-road-not-doing-much kind of German beer, but hey! It really got better as I went on. For the price, you can't do much better than this, so get out there and find one!"
"This is a nice beer to throw into your drinking program as a special treat or to have as a change of pace."
"Drinkability is very nice. There's enough going on along with the sweetness to add nice depth. Given the amount of alcohol it's definitely one and done for me on this beer, though. I definitely will be having this one again."
"Drinkability: This one went really fast, and at this high of an ABV, is really dangerous with how smooth it is. While I wish I had the 500mL bottle, 12oz is enough for one sitting. Still, I would not mind having another one. Went well with a meal (burger and fries) but I could have this one alone to sip and savor....although its so tasty it's hard to sip and savor, I really want to keep drinking more. An outstanding beer in flavor and drinkability. I will definitely pick this up again."
" ~ As far as Doppelbock beers go this is a very drinkable one. However, I think there are better brews available in this style but I think the test of time is a sure good sign that this beer is one that all should enjoy."
"drinkability- I do like the overall flavor of this beer and did enjoy drinking it but certainly not one you can slam through and just drink a ton of its just to big and heavy and malty to rush through but its enjoyable in its own right not a bad beer"
"Overall a very well put together Doppelbock. I think they have mastered making this beer over the three hundred years it has been being brewed. Great job."
"Paulaner Salvator Doppel Bock is a nice beer. Now that it's getting colder, I definitely enjoy these thicker, heavier beers. Salvator poured a cloudy orange amber with a rocky tan head. The beer smelled deeply richly malty with a figgy fruit aroma. The beer had a fruity, apple flavor that was sweet with a bready finish. It tasted clean and the alcohol was well-hidden."
"Overall it's a good beer, delicious. I think it lacks a little bit of complexity but the refreshing part makes up for it."
"Even with the toast in the mouth and all this chocolate, grain, and caramel going on, Salvator remains incredibly inviting for the next mouthful. Alcohol is very subdued too, and the medium body is mouth filling yet slick. I'm just going to say it: this is a sessionable Doppel! Hey it is under 8%, balanced, and dangerously drinkable for its category. Steins up to this marvel of German brewing lore."
"D: Very drinkable. I could start expanding my repertoire due to beers like this."
"Sampled on September 25, 2010. I poured this aggressively into a tall glass and got a beautiful copper-amber tone with about two inches of frothy cream colored head that eventually went away. There are plenty of malts to be had when you take a whiff of this one but also a kind of vague yeasty quality on the tail end. The taste is full of malts and something akin to molasses. It ends with a sharp bite on the back of the throat."
"Quite tasty, and filling in a good way."
"drinkability; really a strong and heavy beer, best enjoyed in moderation, it will destroy you, unless you're a real beast!"
"D: I've had some pretty good doppelbocks before (read: Samichlaus or Ayinger Celebrator), but this one doesn't quite cut it. It seems like it's going through an identity crisis of whether to be a bock or doppelbock, but ends up sharing good attributes of neither."
"I'm used to more honey notes in my bocks - double or otherwise - so all the fruit is throwing me a bit. Nice, but just one by the fire."
"Overall a good beer and it's even better when the 6pck is on sale. Personally I prefer doppelbocks to be more robust. In the widely available German imports for this style I'd choose Weihenstephaner Korbinian."
"Deep reddish mohagany, head doesn't last long. Smells of dark fruits and caramel/toffee. Taste is much the same with a bit of smokiness towards the finish. Tons of sweet malts, mouth coating and enjoyable. My brother bought me a sixer of this years ago for X-mas when I was first getting craft beers and I just didn't ""get it"". Now years later it's a can't miss for sure! Cool bottle artwork too."
"high even for the high alcohol content. I wish I had more. Probably have a pretty decent buzz going on after drinking a liter of this however."
"D: Very easy to drink. Fruit taste lingers on. Great by itself or with a light meal."
"Deep reddish amber in color, with no head to speak of and heavily carbonated. Nose is light and subtle, and carries some alcohol, some tropical fruit notes and a little maltiness. Kind of weak. Flavor definitely makes up for it, though. Very robust and malty as one would expect. Rich and full mouthfeel too. Carries some alcohol, maybe a touch too much. However, I could find myself drinking quite a few of these in a row and getting well oiled up. Usually well priced, so worth trying if you see it but not elite."
"This is a new favorite for me. What a fine example of a doppel in the true German style. Very clean pour with great head and smell. Rich fruit and high ABV make this beer something truly special. I have not been able to find this beer many places but was able to get hooked up with a case last week. What a great taste with food, can hold up to rich and mild foods alike... I will definitely add this to my list of must haves."
"O: Good drinkability which is a bit compromised by the sweetness. A good Paulaner specimen anyway..."
"This is an excellent example of this style, as far as mass produced beers go. Tastes like dark beer with raisins and currant flavors coming through. Is quite drinkable for the relatively high ABV. I use this as an example of the style when showing beers to friends who are new to Real Beer. I crave this beer in the winter and at night in the summer time."
"D: A pleasant, boldly (some might say simply) flavored profile. Despite that, drinkability is never an issue, and this is a welcome version of a very nice style."
"D- This was a decent beer, but not my favorite doppelbock. I found it to be a bit one-dimensional, even within the supermalty realm, and that combined with excessively low carbonation, kind of left this beer underwhelming."
"Drinkability - very sweet and with a high abv this would seem hard to drink and it is in large quantities but then again it was originally designed to be a meal in a glass. IMO an excellent Doppelbock."
"Pours a dark orange that is almost red. The head dissipates quickly leaving only a few bubbles across the top. Aroma of vague vanilla, booze, molasses, rubber, candied oranges. The flavor is more subtle than I thought it'd be: light citrus, slight licorice, wheat, and margarine. Light in body with light carb and surprisingly refreshingly."
"D-the nose lead you to believe a much more yeasty estery beer, the flavors are a blend of burnt malts and dark sweet flavors. it just doesn't seem to work well together for me."
"D: very interesting, a pleasant departure from my normally hoppy beers"
"Drinkability - Very good drinkability. Well-balanced on all ends. Could be slightly maltier for its type, but still quite very drinkable. Maybe not too many in a row though. Easy to come back to this one."
"D-I really like dopplebock's so was slightly disappointed. Still has the bready malts, but no real punch"
"Awesome dopplebock. It's one of the classics for a reason."
"drinkability - average, booziness comes thru towards the end of the drink, at this ABV kind of surprising"
"D- Not a great tasting DB. Tastes are thin, faint and rather ghost-like. Looks great, smells great...just doesn't taste too great."
"D - High."
"drinkability is ok but i would rather have a celebrator or a korbinian"
"This offering would best be enjoyed slowly. One is enough. Recommended nonetheless."
"the higher alcohol content for this beer wasn't very hidden because of the smell booze. caramel color okay head. The taste is not similar to Optimator the other bock I have had this is a little more boozy and hoppy. too boozy but okay beer to sip at the bar but one is enough"
"Not a big fan of Doppelbocks, but this one is excellent."
"M: Long light bitter ending you can feel some alcohol according to the style but not so pleasant."
"Paulaner's doppelbock is a very good beer. I was surprised by the higher alcohol content for this beer, but it is really hidden very well. This beer has a nice caramel color with nice head that laces the glass. The taste resembles other doppelbocks, a little sweet but bitter at the same time. I reccomend trying this beer."
"I get dark fruit in the nose maybe a touch of honey.. it looks nice and drinks pretty well. it leaves a slightly bitter sweet aftertaste.. but the body itself is pretty thin. Sweet with a little tang and dark fruit. recommended.. good sipper."
"A good beer in all respects but it didn't really stand out either."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D- Since I can buy this pretty cheap at a local shop I will buy more of it for sure."
"This beer is all over the place. It doesn't look or smell very interesting and I'm kind of torn on the mouthfeel but the taste is quite good. Of course, I think this is an okay beer when it was colder but warmer it is much better so if you don't like your beer warmer this may just be a mediocre one for you."
"cheers"
"Every bit as good as the Ayinger Celebrator but the bottle is bigger and you get more for the same price."
"Poured a medium amber with a nice creamy tan two fingered head that quickly faded to light lacing. Aromas of fruity carmel and chocolate and sweet malts. Flavors of malty fruits and sweet breads and a nice alcohol warmth. Medium body with decent carbonation. Desent enough brew that fit well with Bison burgers."
"D - love this style and you can drink many more of these than it's counterparts"
"Drinkability is pretty good, but I'd stick with one per sitting. Still, I'd certainly drink this one again and again."
"This is a very nice beer. Although again I've got a Paulaner from a bottle without any head I still think these beers are under-rated. Good example of the style without being overly complex."
"not that great, and not what I remember. Hmm..."
"Drinkability: A very good doppelbock and one of my favorite beers overall. Definitely worth a try, although this is definitely not a beginner doppelbock! Also, a sipper (as many of this style are)."
"D: The beer is quite filling and almost feels like you are having a snack. It's relatively easy to consume because the alcohol is for the most part hidden from the taste. The beer would go perfectly with brown bread."
"D-overall a great tasting doppelbock, one of my favorites for the style"
"Heavy malts here, appropriate sweetness from the style, and there's some deviation but it's balanced and pleasant enough."
"D: I've had this beer numerous times but you can't beat one from it's native land. Goes down good but a little too sweet for me."
"D - Good beer that I would try again but wouldn't go out of my way to get. I think this might be really good on tap at a German restaurant with some sausages and kraut."
"D: The beer drinking experience continues to improve culminating with a drinkability that is through the roof. Palates trained and untrained can find plenty to appreciate. This beer is as approachable as they come."
"D - Well this would be one easy beer to quaff if it wasn't for the alcoholic content, which begins to be a little off putting over time. I really like this, would love to have a couple mugs in the future, probably paired with some food because of the ABV. I'd buy it again for sure, delicious! Recommended. Cheers!"
"I like this beer. In an ideal situation, i wouldn't have more than two but i could definitely see myself getting this again."
"The brew could be far more complex. But it's balanced and decent. Sometimes that's all you need."
"Notes: Solid doppelbock. It didn't necessarily blow me away but it was very nice. A lot of malt and sweetness. Definitely recommend trying this, especially if you are in the mood for a full, malty beer."
"Overall, a very deep flavor profile, but not quite as much as some others in the category, and devoid of the deeper roasty flavors of some others. But, very, very nice nonetheless. This is an understated beer that doesn't demand your attention - it's very easy to drink and enjoy casually - but if you do pay attention there's a lot going on. Plenty enough to keep my palate entertained."
"It's rather drinkable; goes down well and not over-carbonated. The mouthfeel is excellent. I could easily see having one of these as dessert. Who needs cake? Then again, this would make an awesome vanilla float, I think."
"I would have to say a good double bock to warm the soul. To much one dimentional."
"Hmm. This was delicious. I've had doppel's which were too sweet but this seemed to have a good balance. Appearance was copper with a half inch head, quickly dissipated. Nice sweet smell and a balanced taste. Mouthfeel was medium and drinkability was surprisingly high for a 7.9% brew. I'd have a few more of these, no problem. Good balance for the style."
"Overall= Good beer, not a everyday drinker, not enough hops, but a good pint to grab and enjoy during a rain storm such as this one tonight."
"Cheers!"
"D: With the somewhat higher alcohol content and the little bit of burn i probably wouldn't make a session out of these. wouldn't be bad for a cold winter night, but definitely not good for a hot summer day."
"Overall Impression: This is a beer that is the benchmark for the style and it's a great value to boot! If I had to drink this during lent, I'd be one happy monk!"
"This beer goes down easy despite a high ABV. Goof stuff."
"D: Overall a good doppelbock, however I don't think I will ever find a db I like more than Celebrator."
"Kind of like a summer barleywine. If I were a BCJP judge I'd fail this beer due to style irreverence but I'm not and I like it."
"Drinkability - 4.0 - Great aroma and nice flavor, but a little too cloying for me to want to have more than one. A good beer, but not the best of the style, in my opinion. Spaten Optimator is very similar, but I think it is more drinkable and has a smoother palette of flavors."
"Overall a good beer, not over-priced, and not too strong to limit yourself to just one."
"pours a pretty copper, crisp and brilliant with a fluffy white one finger head. smells like donuts, haha. also, aromas of candied yams, and biscuity bread with a hint of caramel malt. the taste is roasty and toasty with some more caramel malt. ends with a nice small spice. kind of a watery mouthfeel, but a good beer for the price."
"Medium-full mouthfeel, very drinkable, as the big doppelbocks go."
"Sante!"
"Salvator falls just outside the characteristics of the other doppelbocks in my experience. The color is lighter, as is the flavor. I don't mean that flavor is lacking here, only that the darker flavors are. I like this, but price and flavor wise, Optimator and Celebrator are better."
"D: One of those beers that I could drink over and over. Love it."
"This beer pours a dark cloudy amber, with just a slight head forming. It leaves quickly, though, and leaves no appreciable lacing. It smells of caramel, and there's a hint of some sweetness that almost seems fruity. The caramel flavors come out pretty strongly as I taste this beer, there might be a slight yeast flavor as well, which isn't unpleasant, and seems to offset the sweet caramel flavors pretty well. This is a very drinkable beer, though I could see it getting heavy after 2 or 3."
"D: Im a little confused. This does not at all represent a doppelbock in my mind. There is a hot alcohol, with clove and banana esters in a cloudy, wheat-like beer. If i was guessing blind I would say this is a bavarian wheat beer... weird"
"Aroma of hops is a first event that follows the cap removal. BBE 01.2011, into tulip. Clear, very deep coppery reddish-brown topped by abundant off-white resistant head that eventually drops to a stable cover. Swirls create thick & stable lacing on the walls. Malty aroma with some melanoidins, toast, plums and obvious alcohol breaking through. The malty body is sweet and toasty, verging on lightly burnt; evident alcohol presence and bitter hoppy aftertaste. Medium bodied, although quite light for a doppel bock, with limited carbonation. Decent, but not nearly as good as best examples of the style."
"Amber colored beer with a slowly fading head that stays at an inch and a half.Aroma is caramel,caramel and more caramel.Taste is also caramel,butter and real subtle fruit.Very tasty and goes down like water.I would recommend if you are a fan of caramel.I personally am a fan of caramel and will purchase again."
"Ive had fuller bodied beers but I will call this full bodied, and creamy."
"D: Nearing the 8% ABV mark, this bock isn't one to be abused. it's a tough pair too because of it's high alcohol and big sweet flavors with an unmasked ethyl flavor. Pretty solid all around, but it called it a night after a two-piece. Sweet, high ABV bock fans will return for more, and I wouldn't necessarily fault that decision."
"D - Good for cold nights, drinkable."
"This beer would be good with a cigar! Or on winter nights."
"This wasn't nearly as big or dark as other doppelbocks I've had, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This was a good, solid beer with some interesting flavors I haven't had in other beers of the style. Give it a try; you won't want it by the case, but it's certainly not bad."
"Overall, an average beer. Nothing to get excited about."
"Technically, this should get a perfect 5 because it is the style, but we'll look the other way on that."
"Saved a bottle for ageing, will try in a few months or so..."
"Pours a light brown/caramel color with a thin tan head that dissipated quickly. Subtle malt and caramel aromas at first, but as the beer warmed these aromas became stronger and I was also able to pick up a hint of cherries and alcohol. The flavor started off very sweet, German malts and caramel. In the middle there is hops, cherries, and alcohol (almost like cough syrup but in a good way not like medicine). The finish is dry with almost no aftertaste. This beer is thick, full-bodied, and rich. The warming alcohol effect makes it a nice after dinner drink on a cold winter night. I thought this was very enjoyable, drinkable beer."
"Notes: For the price, this is a well crafted doppelbock."
"To me, this is the Lager's of Dopplebocks, very crisp."
"cheers!"
"Paulaner Salvator is a very good, but not quite great, Doppelbock. The color is beautiful, the flavor is sweet and delicious, and it's versatile enough to feel warming in cold weather and refreshing on a hot day."
"D: would be easier if my new filling wasn't so cold sensitive. ill give it what id give if i were not in so much pain per sip. I think I could drink it by the liter very easily."
"Better taste than the aroma lets on, with a chewy sweetbread malt note and yeasty fruit esters that suggest plum, fig, and browned apple flesh. Toffee and caramel from the malts get balanced by a late-to-the-party hoppiness that drops a nice floral bitterness on the sides and back of the tongue. A bit resinous? Breathy alcohol nips the throat as this beer finishes. Slick mouthfeel with a surprisingly mild carbonation level considering the fervor with which the bubbles are rising up through Salvator. A little oily, but crisp and moderately clean in the end. All in all, a pretty quaffable doppelbock, although the alcohol does make you sit up and take note halfway through the bottle. Crafty germans..."
"D: This is a good brew and more than one could certainly be enjoyed, however, the above average ABV and full flavor could catch up, and it seems like this one could be more filling than it initially appears."
"All in all, a fairly good doppelbock. Fairly pricey considering that it felt lackluster in certain areas, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Drinkability: The alcohol content steadily creeps up, especially since it is so well-masked by the flavors and smells of the beer. Multiple beers of this would be enjoyable, but would result in a decreased capacity to fully appreciate the beer. This is a beer that would probably be best enjoyed in limited quantity--and enjoyed very well."
"Poured into a chalice, pours an orangish, brown color with a light tan head that dissipated quickly to a crown around the top. Aromas were somewhat faint but malty. Taste is slightly stronger but still malty, with little hop presence. Feel in the mouth has a little bit of light crisp carbonation, with some alcohol warming. Drinkable for sure with about average flavoring, nothing says overpowering about this beer."
"Poured a light brown with a very small tannish head to it. Nose was rather complex malty aroma, very rich malty flavor with caramel overtones. This brew is like a meal but like the other reviews stated it is very drinkable and smooth. A great doppel but would drink over and over again."
"My rating for this beer is a B+"
"Expected much more from Paulaner. Good appearance -- amber in color, 1 finger white head, quickly dissipates. Minimal aroma, didn't pick much up at all. Hints of banana and caramel in the taste but not a particularly complex / tasty beer. Definitely sneak up on you as they are fairly light but have a sizable ABV."
"The only downside to this beer is that I loathe Christmas cake. If I didn't pay money for it I would have been the first beer I poured down the drain."
"taste is of caramel, malt, a roastiness comes through, grain, and a little sweet, ends nicely thick."
"Pours to a nice dark reddish brown. Not a lot of head, and it dissipates quickly. Alcoholic aroma with hints of what seems like cranberry and apple but are rather masked by the alcohol. Alcohol isn't prevalent in the taste surprisingly. Roasted malts seems to be the star with notes of coffee, chocolate and a little bit of caramel. runs to a smooth finish."
"Translucent, more red than brown with a quickly dissipating off white head. A sweet scent of alcohol and malts resound. Mild sweetness, roasty, malts, subtle coffee notes. mild mouthfeel, light carbonation. A pleasant brew but not something outstanding."
"and that's in spite of the fact that I had no other cold beer to tun to ."
"Drinkability is ok. This beer is a little too rough around the edges to be one that I'd like to drink more than one of in a session. But with that said, I certainly wouldn't turn one down, this is a nice strong Doppelbock."
"I would buy again."
"Mouthfeel is medium full bodied, sweet, warming, wth a tiny bit of bitter hops lingering."
"This is a solid beer. It has decent complexity making it an enjoyable quaff. Bring on more Bocks!"
"D: The best Paulaner i've tried."
"An excellent Doppel Bock!"
"Pretty good beer, very balanced. Does not rise to amazing heights, but has good qualities all around."
"This beer is carmel and sweet but not overly sweet. It is full bodied and drinkability high. Great malt character, almost nutty. Its not yeasty or bready at all. Good midpalate character there is a slight bitterness at the end of the whole thing, overall a great beer, I truly enjoyed it."
"D: Not as much sweetness as I remember (the bottle has been in the fridge for a month) Very easy to drink with a round and robust flavor profile, but it lacks the complexity I like in a dopple bock, needs more smokiness and more sweetness."
"Light carbonation, thick and rich."
"Drinkability: decent brew, very drinkable."
"Taste is a little thin, not as maltbomby like some doppelbocks. Mouthfeel, not something that gets better, or is desireable in the mouth. Hence, it isn't so drinkable. A lot of alcohol, dark fruit notes, and metallic bitterness. I don't get it."
"O/D - Honestly it's not as good as I remember, but it is still a good beer. Very drinkable even at 7.9%."
"Notes: The Prototypical Double Bock. Gotta give it a try."
"My first doppelbock...made me think they'd all be like this. Brown sugar, molasses, spices, and other flavors danced on my tongue...mmm. Definitely my favorite of this style as I haven't had another that comes close to comparing. I could say more, but if you haven't tried it, go get it...especially if you can get it on tap."
"D- Very drinkable. I plan on drinking many of these for a while. I would highly recommend picking up this beer."
"Definitely a rich and warming brew, but it's tad one-dimensional without the depth of flavor that other Doppelbocks have."
"D: A very good doppelbock, very drinkable."
"a very balanced and somewhat pale doppelbock. a copper pour of some head that doesn't stick around that long. nose of apple pie and maltose. a palate of that but lighter in body than most. and a bitter finish i wasn't expecting in comparison to most of the style. not bad. i would say it a great beer in flagship form. a good way to understand what a doppelbock does as light as it may be."
"The mouthfeel has a heavy body that feels slightly syrupy. There's a light alcohol warming in the finish that isn't too course. The carbonation is lower than I personally prefer but more would be unsuited with the alcohol presence. The feel is sticky on the lips after the drink."
"Well, I would have to say this one is a good beer, I am starting to figure certain beers are really close, as far as the double bocks they are really close in taste ( from the ones that I have tried) although there is a good but distinct subtle flavor in each one, a smoothness if you will. I try to stay away from crap beers but I am slowly realizing that certain beers maintain very close flavors with mild subtle hints."
"had on tap at burger jones into a pint glass that had beautiful amber hazy color with a somewhat thin head minimal lacing til the end..the smell was toffee and brown sugar some malts and toast..the taste is warming its malts and some grassy hops followed by some roasted malts and some biscuits it has a strong medium mouth feel with a good drink ability factor it went well with the robust burger and onion rings i had..MMM ill have this again"
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass (a had to take a couple of sips to get the all of it in). It poured with the slightest of slight haze with an orange creamsycle like colored head. No lacing at all, the foam dissipates pretty quickly. The color itself is pretty nice, a good amber color. The smell is good heavy on the malts and sort of a sweet smell. The taste is similar to the smell, but on steroids. One of the sweetest beers I've had in quite awhile. Again very heavy on the malts. There are certainly some caramelized malts. Another sweet taste I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe some type of sweet dehydrated fruit followed by a hint of alcohol. This has quite a unique taste. I find the mouthfeel pretty good, a little on the lighter side, and the drinkability is good."
"O - This beer is delicious. Doppelbocks are among my favorite styles and I'm glad i tried this one."
"Overall, a good example of a doppelbock. A little too much on the sweet side for me."
"The beer finished very sweet as it warmed, and proved to be a little hard to finish. One to two of these in a night would be the most I'd want to drink. I can see how these were developed to help the monks make it through their Lenten fasts."
"This, is a great beer to start off the Doppelbock section. Originally used for fasting, this easily quaffed, malty beer is a perfect example of ""liquid bread."""
"Clear darkish copper/amber. About two fingers of cream/beige head after a pretty vigorous pour with no lacing at all. Sweet and malty smell. I also get a hint of bubblegum. There is also some booziness in the scent along with faint hops. This beer was made July '08. I don't know if that helped in the taste department or not, but it certainly didn't hurt. Seemed tastier than what I remember. Sweet malty caramel in the taste, and you can sense the alcohol. However, it's fairly easy drinking. Glad I gave this another shot."
"notes- this review is for a 2000 vintage. i bought a 3L of this beer from whole foods in berkeley and only drank 1/3 of the bottle for which i should be punished. one of my best memories of this beer is sitting in the tall grass of the yosemite valley watching a group of climbers scaling the nose...crazy!"
"Drinkability is pretty high given the abv. It's not my favorite doppel, but it's definitely tasty."
"Overall I am very impressed. This is a completely drinkable, yet flavorful brew."
"I wouldn't exactly call this my favorite, but it is a great value. It is a great looking good tasting beer that I bought for $2.39 for a 500mL bottle. I will probably by a few more to have around for when I am in the mood for this one."
"Taste follows and offers a long pleasant finish. Malts are adequate but not overwhelming and mask the ABV fully. Touch of cinnamon, orange and nutmeg as well as light chocolate on the tongue. Well carbonated throughout, clean and soft on the palate. A light and smooth feel, lightly viscous yet easy drinking. Very nice example."
"A classic and one of my favorite cold-weather beers."
"D- As good as I thought this was, I don't know if I would want more then one of these. Feels a bit heavy on the stomach and hey, that 7.9% ABV is definitely masked well."
"Overall - A very tasty (and strong) dopplebock. Fans of malt-bombs, or this style will enjoy this."
"Taste was of caramel, yeast, bread, toffee, and just a little alcohol. Sounds simple enough, but not very enjoyable for me. I was bored with the flavor after a few sips. Seemed like low quality ingredients if that makes any sense. Also seemed kind of watered down. It is hard to understand how someone could actually like this beer."
"D - very easy to see the bottom of the bottle without realizing it. At nearly 8 percent, this could be trouble, so drink w/ caution. this is one dangerously deliecious and very approachable dopple bock."
"It is one of those miracle beers where you just cannot feel the alcohol and I just kept on drinking it!"
"Ive had a few other doppels, but it has been a long while and I havent reviewed them. To me this beer doesnt live up to the idea of a doppelbock that Celebrator gave me. A good beer nonetheless and great to kick off autumn."
" D- Goes down too easily; which can be risky considering I found myself F'ed up after four. I know I'll go back to this one again and again; just gotta remember to respect this one."
"Drinkability: High. Whether enjoying a krug with dinner or simply people-watching on the Fußgängerzone, this doppel bock will leave you with good memories. An excellent introduction into the style."
"D- Since Celebrator is a similar cost and a remarkably more enjoyable beer, I probably will not buy this beer again for a very long time."
"Very smooth and easy on mouth feel and etc. I could drink this all night. Hopefully with a plate of sausage."
"Not nearly as malty as the dopplebocks I've had before. More like a boozy strong ale, which I know sounds like splitting hairs..."
"The temptation is to compare this brew with the other popularly priced Munich dopplebock, Spaten Optimator. Salvator is a little less malty and hoppier but equally potent at 7.9% ABV. The buttery note is a detriment but seems to be a consistent part of the flavor profile."
"Pours an amber color with really no head that I could see. A thin line of bubbles maybe. Smells like sweet toasted caramel malt, some noble hop aroma, and slight alcohol. The taste is sweet caramel malt flavor followed by an alcohol flavor and slight bitterness in the finish. Of course the noble hop flavors don't really appear. Mouthfeel is rather heavy and thick. It was funny watching the carbonation bubbles struggle to make it to the surface. Definitely a heavier beer. The beer is tasty, but due to it's syrupy thickness it may be hard to drink in quantity. I wouldn't go to the bar specifically for a double bock, but every once in a while they are nice to drink. This one in particular."
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours a rich amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is mild, some hints of caramel. Taste is mild, notes of caramel and alcohol. Feels creamy in the mouth. A bit heavy on the stomach to drink to many of these. Overall this is a decent brew."
"To that end, of course, it is certainly easy to drink. An easily accessible, easy to find doppel that won't turn any heads, but isn't bad. Maybe a good one to use as an introductory brew for the BMC-oriented."
"This is a great beer, one that I pick up any time I stumble across it. It's a highly drinkable and highly satisfying in a way that makes it easy to stop at just one. But in a good way."
"Overall, a beer that I'll try again, this one is a little past its prime."
"I feel like this needs a bit more spice or a bit more sour character, it just seems a bit insipid because of the constant sweetness."
"Bottle poured into pint glass. Translucent golden color. Not much in terms of head. Smell is sweet and caramel-like. Taste is mildly sweet and caramel-like but there is a stronger flavor in there is well which reminds me of barrel-aged beers. (Maybe just a ""woody"" flavor?) Pretty drinkable.. wouldn't have known it was this strong without it being reported on the website."
"Medium bodied, with smooth carbonation. Easy to drink, yet filling and satisfying."
"Found on tap at the Black Forest German restaurant in Minneapolis, MN, this dark brew shows a ruby mahogany color with a modest light tan head and very little lacing. The aroma is caramel malt wheat, not too definitive, but nothing displeasing about it. The flavor comes on much stronger with similar caramel domination swimming in a firm body of malt. As you go through it there is also some licorice alcohol in a mid-bodied blend with grain brightness. It's well carbonated, frisky but substantial with caramel and brown sugar. It has a little punch but is fairly drinkable. Enjoyable for the flavors at hand and also a refreshing dark beer."
"D- Nice earthy roasted malt flavors, but the boozy sweetness gets in the way just a bit. Appreciate the complexity, but wast just in search of a fresher, cleaner malt taste."
"Drinkability: If you like malt, this is the way to go."
"Drinkability: Nice overall, but a basically a boozy bock."
"D - One of my favourite beers, it's a must for any beer lover."
"good brew. not the best. but a great representation of a dopple bock."
"Verdict: Salvator is a solid Doppelbock and it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular examples of the style. It's nicely drinkable while still being complex and rich with a nice alcohol edge."
"my first review of this was horrible because it was my first doppelbock. i've wised up a bit since then, and realized that i enjoy beers with depth and flavor, of which this most definitely is."
"Interestingly, the longer in the glass the less ""sweet and fruity"" it becomes and the more complexingly vegetal."
"Poured it into a pint glass. Pours a nice reddish brown color with a decent head that dissipates quite rapidly leaving a thin layer on top. Aroma of mostly dark sugars and it does smell nice. Starts off sweet and ends with a very nice bitternes that lingers for a while. Very easy to drink. A very good dopple bock. One of the better ones."
"The aroma and flavor are pretty standard doppelbock. It seems, from what I know of the history, that this was a standard for the style long ago and what came was based upon this one. It doesn't have as much of the big, bold flavor or the black licorice that I taste in some, but all the foundational aspects of the style are in this brew. I think some others have built upon it and improved with bolder, richer flavors and a stronger malt back, and a thicker, fuller body adding some richness, but this is a solid, tasty brew and well worth emulating and building upon as others have."
"I had always wanted to try this beer, but didn't want a six pack so I was excited to see a single. It poured from the bottle to reveal a nice maple color. The aroma was moderatly sweet and had a maple component to it as well. The taste was moderately sweet with a hint of what I would call clover. The beer also had an earthy taste that seems to be common in european beers. The mouthfeel was moderate and a little buttery."
"Overall, a drink of the gods. My first and favorite dopplebock and favorite of all Paulaner brews. Almost too easy to drink considering ABV."
"Quite full body, low carbonation. Wouldn't have thought this would work with the sweetness but somehow it doesn't seem out of place."
"Overall: Very good, I loved the cider hints in the taste and the slight alcohol presence was nice as well. I will definitely be reaching for this again. A new favorite bock I think!"
"D - Maybe I am just used to high ABV brews, but this is very drinkable. Other than I slight buzz I had when I stood up, I could drink myself silly before I knew it. This is a nicely balanced bier, and a good representation of the style I could drink all night... if the liver would agree."
"Quite a highly carbonated beer no doubt, but a good full body rounds out the mouthfeel"
"D - This isn't a bad beer by any means and offers a reasonable amount of flavour and interest for the 7.9% ABV it packs."
"A great dopplebock, a lighter color than many of the others but a good beer."
"It was a very enjoyable beer and one that makes me want to get a little more acquainted with the style."
"EDIT: better a bit warmer, IMO, as the warmed temperature brings the malt flavors out more and balances the alco-esters more evenly."
"MF&D - the MF is nice, just the right amount of low level carbonation; it takes some agitation to get a big response from the bubbles. the drinkability is fine, the alcohol is not impedance to the drinking process, quite the contrary: it mixes very well with the malts. the only complaint is that the feel is a bit thin, maybe I just like a syrupy dopple bock."
"drinkability- seemed a bit off for a dopple, but good any way. I enjoyed it."
"Notes: A very fine example of the style with a good balance."
"D - ok, tangy sweet hangs a bit."
"D-I will be keeping some of these on hand. Not really sessionable as much as a frequent treat."
"D - Great beer. Would be perfect, but the alcohol is noticable and resilient."
"drinkability: great beer strong but still a very good session beer glad i bought six"
"D - Very light body, and probably the most easily drinkable doppelbock I've had yet. I could see my self having several of these with a meal or on their own. Also - very cheap! <$2.50 for a 0.5L bottle!"
"Wow. I had this a few months ago, and my opinion of this beer has increased dramatically. The beer poured a rich amber -- the body was great, but the head was definitely lacking. What little head there was was white in color. Perhaps the pour wasn't vigorous enough, because whatever was there initially faded quickly. The smell was great also, with big fruit notes and a bit of malt. No hops whatsoever. Some strong carbonation that leads to a sweet finish with maybe the tiniest hint of hop bitterness. I have to say that I thorougly enjoyed this beer."
"I really liked this beer, great example of a Doppelbock. Will certainly have this again, but I do like Celebrator better."
"Poured into a imperial pint glass. Red in color. Light, white head which dissipated quickly and left little to no lace. Smells like alcohol, and toasty malts. Tastes about the same. Large amounts of sweet malt, tempered with a lot of hop bitterness. From reading other peoples reviews I expected less, frankly. I liked this beer and it wasn't too expensive, would buy again."
"smooth very chewy low on the carbonation. The Germans know how to do it."
"Smells nicely of toffee, some slight bitterness from underlying hops (more pine than citrus). The taste is very nice. Get a toasted toffee intial flavor coming through, bit of warmth in there. Very solid flavors here. Very buttery mouthfeel, slides down easy."
"Nice doppel bock, and though not my favorite, a solid offering none the less. A decent representation of the style."
"D - A great doppelbock...I would recommend this one if you are looking for a beer that is true to style"
"Pours a deep mahogony with a fluffy tan head that reduces to a ring with lacing. Smell is mostly malt and a little dried fruit. Taste is sweet malts, carmel. A bit later a mild spice comes through (alcohol?) and finally a bit of hop bitterness to almost balsnce everything out. The brew is a tad on the sweet side hurting drinkability a bit. Mouthfeel is full and a bit chewey. A nice brew. Makes me miss Germany, where I drank this fresh."
"Very nice dopplebock, but of the readily available German dopplebocks I prefer Celebrator. This one is lighter and has more caramel rather than toffee notes. Pours a clear caramel with very little head and what there is fades to nothing. Malty with caramel scents and a bit of fruit. Clean and a bit yeasty and quite bready. Similar in the mouth. Slightly sweet with quite a bit of caramel, followed by a dryer maltiness that is almost chewy and very, very smooth. Slight notes of plum and cherries from the malt. This is very nuanced and clean. A worthy dopplebock."
"The taste is rich, sweet but with balancing bitterness and a bit spicey with a light bite and with a dryish, slightly bitter-zesty finish. It has rich, caramelised & fermented whole wheat bread, raisins, hint of burnt caramel building near the finish, a light peppery quality."
"Overall, a great brew. I found the bitterness a little offputting, enough to make me slow down on consumption, but not enough to turn me off. Very worthy and enjoyable."
"It is amazing to me that Salvator doesn't score any higher at BA. This is the ORIGINAL DOPPLEBOCK. This beer is descended from the monastery in Munich where it was invented. Check out the classic beer styles book ""Bock"" by Darryl Richman."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had. Rivals celebrator.. I'll have to do a back to back to really compare the two."
"Drinkability:"
"A ery nice dopple indeed!"
"Prosit!"
"Drinkability is good. A nice drink for a cool night. One is probably enough in most cases. As a nightcap, I could probably enjoy a second one!!!!"
"D - Considering the ABV, not bad at all. I don't think I could do more than one in a sitting, but it went down smoothly and pleasantly, and I'll definitely be buying this one again."
"D: This beer is truly impressive in that it is fully rich and robust, and at the same time possesses the ability to be consumed very quickly due to its ridiculous malty goodness."
"other than what seem to be slightly ""off"" pehnolic notes in the flavor, and perhaps hints of booziness, this isn't all that bad. but maybe what i really need is a fresher sample?"
"CHEERS!"
"mouthfeel is a bit heavy and may influence the drinkability."
"The progenitor of the style remains a sturdy, well-crafted brew, showing a ""liquid bread"" quality true to its roots as a piece of monastic sustenance. Delightful."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to drink even with its ABV, but not something I would go out of my way to have anytime soon. It was also my first doppelbock so that could be a factor. I prefer ales over lagers too."
"-RR"
"The paulaner salvator is an exquisite version of a dopplebock(double bock). Very little head and very amber in color. Clear but in appearance but not completely see through. Smooth taste thats feels comfortbaly in your mouth. Not overwhelming and not overly impressive and doesnt have a strong aftertaste. A crisp taste that only comes with centuries of experience."
"Very clear amber color kind of pale. Not much head but a lasting ring. Not much to the smell, malty, bocky. Taste is easy, good, I like it. Again it is bocky but not overly bocky. Hops come in toward the mid range. Mouthfeel is good, pretty good after. Malty and hoppie. Easy to drink."
"M - Slightly less than medium bodied, slightly sticky, decent carbonation."
"Notes: love dopplebocks. gotta respect originals of any style."
"This seems to represent the German doppels which are much more expressive of the overall lager characteristics than the majority of doppels you come across, having more of the ""imperial"" flair to them, making them much more like ales in flavor and such.. It smells malty, like brown sugar a bit and caramel with a slight bit of hop presence in there.. The appearance is extremely light for the style, its an amber color with some orangish hue to it, totally clear with very little head. Taste is malty, a bit of caramel. ITs very crisp, more like your typical lager or such (think Sam Adams with some extra malt?) Its very light in mouth, not watery though. Its super crisp and easy to drink but its lacking in the richness of flavor and feel that you find in most doppelbocks. If I was blind tasting it I might guess it was a maibock.. I don;t know if its due to exposure to the more American ""big beer"" type of stuff that you come across more often, but its overall not just rich enough compared to otehr doppelbocks. Its certainly easy to drink, though, and definitely not bad."
"Medium bodied and light/medium carbonation, but mostly smooth. Pretty drinkable given the abv level but this is a meal in itself so beyond that one 16.9 oz. offering, I wouldn't be drinking another right away. Still this is a fine doppelbock that I would not mind having again some other time."
"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured a bright, clear orange-amber, much lighter than most Dopplebocks. Had about an inch of light tan head that left no lacing. A relatively neutral aroma, nothing stands out. A solid malt foundation leads to a slightly sweet finish, with just a little tang on the end. Smooth, even body that's easy to drink. Very drinkable, having several would be easy as long as you're aware of the sneaky alcohol. Overall a lighter, easier drinking Dopplebock that gives up somethings for those traits."
"OVERALL: An enjoyable enough brew that I'd go back to, but don't think I'd go out of my way to get it. The alcohol is pretty noticeable so it'd be hard to have a few in one sitting. Definitely a nice warming brew for the winter, however."
"Poured a seethru copper body with a minor head and not much lacing. Caramel and burnt malts, maybe toffee, dominate the aroma although there are citric hops (fruit smells) tucked in there also. Medium-bodied but smooth and creamy, sweet malts like caramel (and other sugariness) mix with some roasted/toasted malts for balance and there are some fruit flavors in there as well (apple, pear, orange are all kind of noticeable). Beer finishes somewhat dry w/ a mix of roasted malts and a syrupiness/stickiness in the beer, but overall I would say it is a sweet tasting beer. A definite sipper that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Decent dopplebock."
"D: Though light-bodied, I still found this brew pleasant to drink. I would likely recommend a few other DBs before this one."
"Overall this is one solid brew. And if im using a value scale this one I would give it an A+, but take price out of the equation and this is a solid b+ maybe an A for me!"
"Best dopplebock out there for sure. This is an exceptionally smooth beer with a great taste and finish. The abv makes it an exceptional value for the money. Available at most fine package stores, I highly recommend this tasty brew. I am looking forward to finding it on tap."
"It was bitter at first. Smoothness to it and the malts come through. Good beer, but doesn't do anything great."
"Sometimes you re-review beers just out of sheer passion. This is one of those times. I'm not even going to follow protocol. This is my favorite beer. This is also not a biased review. The smell of alcohol is prominent, this is a very strong beer - I can imagine a 17 year old Schwarzenegger crushing two of these on his way to the gym in Austria. I've come to embrace a new nose with this one this time around, is that dried prunes? or aged apricots? You may have your arrogant bastard ale but it pales in comparison. You certainly are not worthy."
"Certainly not my favorite dopple bock. To me, this one almost comes across as a toasty English Barleywine. Still, It's a pleasant beer, and I wouldn't turn one down - there are just a number of examples of this style I'd pursue first (Curator, Korbinian, Celebrator, Troegenator...)."
"Just compared to other doppels I've tried, this doesn't seem to fit into the style as I'm used to it, but is a decent offering nonetheless."
"Picked up a sixer on discount as I haven't had my usual share of double bocks this winter. Pretty good stuff, nicely balanced, stays away from being over-the-top sweet."
"Very drinkable little package, but the alcohol can sneak up on you."
"Golden red in appearance, some bubbles. Whitish smallish head, lasting, good lacing. Malty aroma, earthy dark fruit aromas. Grape. Fresh taste, lively, woody, dark fruit on the aftertaste. Some alcohol, smooth balanced flavor, not real malty. Letting it warm up a bit...a little more malty flavor, but still well balanced. Some taste of flowers. Overall not too bad a beer. One of my first dopplebocks, so not sure what to look for."
"Overall: A great example of a double bock beer. Definitely worth seeking out"
"D - Ya, das iss goot bier!"
"Pours a clear amber color. 1/4 inch head with slightl retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, strong lager, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of a Doppelbock. The mouth feel was smooth and crisp. There was an average carbonation level. A bitter and slighty tart quality that leaves a dryness on the palate. Tastes of sweet malt, good lager background, and slight alcohol flavor. Overall, a good beer, but not the best example of a Doppelbock."
"Drinkability: It truly is more like bread than beer. I want to say it's an energy bar in liquid form, but the smell and taste are much more deserving. It's decent and drinkable, but the monastic life is not for everyone."
"D - Another fine offering from Paulaner. Great drinkability for the style without any overdone sweetness or excessive alcohol heat."
"Overall, this is a decent example of a dopplebock. I am not the biggest fan of this beer for the style, but I did enjoy it."
"Drinkability: At 7.9 abv drinkability is pretty descent. However I wouldn't drink more than two solely due to the strange sour bitterness."
"Pours reddish amber. Has a nice head. Smell is nicely grainy. The taste is very good. I truly enjoyed the flavor. Very grainy as well. The mouthfeel was nice. Drinkability is okay. I wouldn't want more than a couple, but it was still a very nice beer. I'll get it again."
"Bottle dated 06/08 but I figured it would still be good so I bought it anyway. Nice reddish color, smells and tastes bready, grainy, some sweetness, raisin brea. Overall a tasty and easy to drink dopplebock. I need to start drinking more of these German beers!"
"Although this beer was barely in the competition against Aventinus and Weihenstephaner, I would still drink it again, but when I was a lighter dopplebock."
"In the end, good, but not something I would drink back to back."
"Drinkability: Not really something I could see drinking much of. I've just had many better Doppebocks. I will say though that it tastes better the more you drink, but not a good first impression. It is relatively easy to drink though, without much alcohol or ""intensity"" coming through."
"Picked up a six pack recently, and tried it in two different glasses. The first was a Celebrator Doppelbock glass, and the other was a seidel mug. Very light brown color, almost bordering on orange. Whispy white head, and a good amount of lacing. Carbonation only noticeable at the top half of the glass. The smell was a blast of malt and alcohol vapor. Pretty much the same in the flavor. Got some notes of raisins and peat/evergreen as I sipped it, but this is a very malty beer. Alcohol is a bit hot too, so it's definitely a sipper. I preferred this beer in the wide mouthed mug over the slender Celebrator glass. It seemed to let the beer breathe a bit more. A good try, but a beer that I'd only pick up once in a blue moon."
"Salvator pours a deep amber color with a big, foamy off-white head. Foam is full of small bubbles with noticeable effervescence running up the inside of the glass. The head diminishes slowly to a thin layer just on top of the beer. Most of it clings to the rim of the glass. Minimal lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell is sweet with an under lying scent of freshly harvested hay. Black cherry and banana notes are also observed. Salvator has a big, malty flavor with a prevalent yeast character. The alcohol is noticeable and warms the tongue and cheeks. Bitterness is tasted on the back of the tongue and in the throat. A slight fruitiness lingers in the mouth after swallowing. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and floats around the mouth. This beer goes down easy and is well balanced."
"I could probably drink three or four of these but I think I will just enjoy the one tonight. It is delicious though."
"Overall - A good beer that is quite representative of Doppelbocks. I must admit that Einbecker's Ur-Bock has a more balanced taste though."
"Its a smooth drink and it stays crisp the whole time. Overall pretty tasty but fairly standard with no huge surprises."
"Pretty good one. Strong aromatic nose, complex flavor. Doesn't quite have the right feel. Nevertheless, overall good quaff."
"Full bodied with medium carbonation. I saw my local store had some Paulaner on the shelves and this doppelbock piqued my interest. I am very happy I picked this up and really good beer all around."
"Light and smooth. Very creamy feel, with subdued carbonation providing just a bit of prickliness at the outset."
"Full bodied with good drinkability."
"Drinkability: A fine, respectable doppelbock, but, truth be told, it's bit boozy for me."
"D - Very good double bock, would recommend"
"Drinkability: I could have several and will buy this again...After tasting several dopple bocks, my first impression tells me that this is one of my favorites in the style--while alcoholic, the alcohol is not overpowering."
"Drink: Goes down fairly smoothly. Could be a little deceiving with the slightly elevated ABV of 7.9%."
"Overall: I do not see myself drinking this again. It baffles me as to why Salvator is held in high regard. The flavours don't work well together and the beer simply lacks good qualities. Avoid."
"Good offering from Paulaner, nice mix of malts and hops. Alcohol is apparent when you drink but isnt overwhelming, would buy again."
"4.5 M&4 D: quite smooth on the palate while also remaining refreshing, with the help of a nicely-carbonated body. The balance gears towards maltiness, of course, but not overdone and maintains its softness despite its relatively high alc. strength. A surprisingly easy-to-drink and lovable beer, this is my first-ever bottle of doppelbock and I immediately fall for it!"
"Drinkability: I would say no to this beer over and over again. Its nothing like the other german stronger beers ive tried. Mayber i got a bad batch but this is one beer I hope to never drink again."
"Pours dark, clear red, thin to middle sized head that dissipates quickly. Looking diagonally into this beer -- it's red as Mars. Nice looking brew thanks to the color. Syrupy, sugary, slightly alcoholic, malty aroma. Taste... Syrupy caramel malt, a bit of breadiness, a tad alcoholic. Tingly carbonation, slightly watery, but not drastically so. Solid, solid effort. Thumbs up."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a decent doppelbock. Not the best, but pretty good."
"Overall, this is a fine brew. In my top 3 dopplebocks. Very easy to drink yet complex enough to keep the palate entertained."
"D: Probably one of the better drinking beers per style. Extremely smooth, light, fruity and sweet. The clean malt palate truly shows the craftsmanship behind this great drink making this a must try. Could easily drink in multiples. A dream to drink."
"Its tough to rate another doppelbock after when the first one you ever had was a Celebrator. Pours is clear amber with a medium head. Malty aroma with some fruits and yeast. Taste is more sweet than bitter, like there is a pale ale hiding in there. The alcohol is masked well. A very good beer, but definitely not a Celebrator."
"D - I could sip this for a while. Not sure I could do more than two in a sitting. Very nice and complex but not nearly as complex as Celebrator or even Optimator I think. Completely different from those two beers but just goes to show that beers can vary greatly within the same style. I really liked it and would love to drink again."
"Tastes much like the aroma. It's pretty boozy though, which kinda throws it off alot for me."
"pours a suprisingly light brown with 1.5 fingers of creamy head, nice retention. aroma is of malty banana-nut bread and toffee. taste is sweet and malty, aftertaste is a little on the bitter side for a beer of this style, but a fairly clean finish. alcohol presence is high, but not unpleasant, and comes to the front as it warms. body is a little thinner than I would like. all in all a really good, but not great, doppelbock. worth drinking if its on sale."
"The flavor is bursting with caramelized malt and molasses full body a bit nutty, hint of coffee, vanilla and alcohol and oak. Has a bitter finish. Not too bad for a doppel bock"
"I really liked this beer, and I guess I will have more during the current Doppelbock season (the Bavarians call that the fifth season actually, starting on Nov 11 and lasting until Ash Wednesday, I believe)."
"Drinkability is high"
"D: This goes down way too easy on a cold night. I would have no problem at all reaching for a second one. Any fan of malty beers should give this a try, recommended."
"Damn good brew."
"nice mouthfeel and very drinkable beer considering the abv."
"Taste: The taste is exceptional. Big creamy maltiness. Alcohol is there but doesn't get in the way. Also some dark fruitiness."
"Definitely not the finest example of a DB, but still OK"
"Salvator is lush and on the fullish side of medium-bodied. Nice Dopplebock; nice drinkability."
"A great beer and one that I'm glad I came back to. I'm sure it won't be the last time."
"A very worthy respresentative of the historic Doppelbock style."
"Pretty damn good, but nothing terribly impressive."
"d: flavor wise it would be a pleasure but two bottles will kill productivity due to abv. however, this is going to be a winter wonder for me as it pushes the flavors out to a bit less traditional ways yet is warming in potency."
"Overall, a good doppelbock. I liked the Korbinian better, and I have yet to try the Celebrator (which is in my fridge waiting to be tried). Def. a great beer"
"D: A drinkable and enjoyable doppelbock that is good but is missing a little bit of character to push it up into a higher echelon."
"enjoying this more than on earlier occasions, but still not one of my favorites."
"Drinkability - Fantastic. This is one of my absolute favorite beers, its so smooth and the slight sweetness to it makes it oh so enjoyable, particularly after a meal."
"A nice Doppelbock, but a bit too candy-like in its sweetness."
"12 ounce bottle, ""produced on"" dating of 02/08 on the label. Pours clear, darker copper amber, under a quickly disappearing light tan head and then leaving next to no lacing. Nose is subtly of malt. Things pick up upon the first few sips this is a quite tasty, bold, smooth drinking, malty brew. Packing a punch at about 8%. Malt carries the freight here. Notes of dark honey, vanilla, dark bread. Yummy, smooth, thoroughly German and completely pleasurable. High quality, well crafted, go get some and enjoy."
"Looked nice. Smelled fair with a roasty and sweet aroma. The taste, however was one dimensional. Sweet syrupy taste with little else to balance it. After my second, I was done- sweetness was cloying and the thick consistency and low carbonation only further contributed to the impression that I was drinking syrup."
"This doppel pours gourgeously, but that's the high point. Not much a nose, very light, maybe a little citrusy, but that's it. Taste is flat; not much there at all. Some sweetness, a little hops, but that's the extent of it. At 7.9% ABV, a little burn too, but for that ABV I want and expect much more. Why have this when you can go for a Bernardus or another Belgian for the same ABV? If you're a German fan, then I'd much rather go with a Spaten Dark over this one."
"Personally, when it comes to doppelbocks, I prefer Celebrator and Korbinian. But I certainly wouldn't turn this beer down."
"This beer pours gorgeous with an amber brown hue and fair head which doesn't stay for vary long. Nose is good with a toasted aroma and a slightly spicy background with little or no hopynes. Taste is fair and the toasted malts are the most prominent with a caramal finish backing them up. The brew has a medium body, is smooth and has a slightly creamy finish."
"Nice deep rich color and has a sweet dark amber-brown Color. sweet buttery syrupy taste yet has kind of a thick full flavor. this is a good beer and I pick this up at Bev Mo and was in the mood for some Double Bock, Has a nice kick and I give it two thumbs up."
"Very nice bock."
"Paulaner makes good beers, so I am not surprised at how easy this is to drink. I was a little surprised at how light and refreshing, but I am not complaining."
"Drinkability: Decent dobble bock."
"It's not so filling like other beers I have tired and I will drink it again. This beer is definitely not for the average beer drinker."
"Looks like a scotch ale, smells like a scotch ale, tastes like a scotch ale! I guess there's a bit more alcohol & it's a bit heavier than a scotch ale, but I would've had trouble blindly categorizing this one."
"D - it is pretty good, however it is a little heavy on the alcohol."
"This was a very good Doppelbock. Not as good as say Celebrator or Korbinian, but it was close."
"Pours a nice brown/amber color with no head. A nice sweet, sugary, dried fruit, and molasses aroma. Smell is pretty sweet to start and ends up slightly bitter. A little bit of carbonation in the mouth. A pretty drinkable doppelbock and a good example of the style. Refreshing on a hot summer day."
"This is an attractive pour with a beautiful Scotch brown color. Nice head that stuck around just long enough. Smells a bit hot with some malt and sweetness in the nose. Notes of brown sugar, dried apricots with a mildly sweet finish. Smooth mouth feel with great carbonation. very nice..."
"A highly drinkable beer as we head into a New England autumn. Poured with a low, tan head that sat for a brief period before dissolving. Nice looking in the glass, a bit darker than amber. Aroma carried plenty of malt with notes of cherries and honey. But the taste! Nicely malted, a bit sweet, subtly fruity and a bit of bitterness at the end. Something to savor as the weather gets colder."
"D: Another absolutely solid beer from Paulaner. Great taste and pleasantly warming alcohol make it a good one to sink into."
"Tasty and rich. More alcoholic than most beers in the style, but also dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a amber color with a decent off-white head that settles down to patches. Aroma is floral with a little perfume, light fruits, and some malt and molasses. Ditto on the flavor although it all seems too light. Finishes a little sour and bitter with the rest of the flavors rather bland. It's okay but it all seems light and a little unbalanced."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a good beer that is worth drinking for a while if you're in the mood for the style, but it's not the first one that I would select."
"Drinkability- A great meal beer or I love to cook with it."
"A deep orange with an enthusiastic top. Lots of carbonation going on. Aroma is a light caramel with even lighter fruit aromas. It has a noticeable alcohol bite and goes down with a bit of malty stickiness. It's well-balanced and there's some fruitiness throughout."
"Delicious with most meals during any season (but especially the colder months)."
"By the way, I cleaned the glass I used by hand (like I always do) and don't have a pet, so I didn't in any way taint the beer with outside hamster flavors."
"D. This is one of my favorite bock beers. It's alcohol taste is well disguised and it's very smooth to drink."
"To heavy and malt dominated for me to drink much of this."
"Defiantly quite complex, somewhat of an intoxicating flavor. Could probably only handle one of these in a setting based on sweetness alone. All in all though quite enjoyable and interesting to say the least."
"Overall: I would have this dopplebock again as it is very good."
"Drinkability - This slugger tastes somewhat like a barleywine instead of a doppelbock. Not bad just different than most. If your looking for something to warm the insides and get your blood flowing, then this is the beer you're looking for."
"I must admit after I poured this into a glass I was expecting a darker, heavier looking beer. One taste and I knew that looks are deceiving. This dopplebock is chock full of flavor. It tastes like a liquid sweet bread with overtones of figs and almost a ""rum like"" flavoring. This one is hard to explain and at 7.5% the strong alcohol taste is non-existant. Can't wait to go back and get some more!"
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a medium foamy head on a dark amber body. Smells were not nearly as strong as I 'd expect, very faint sweetness and caramel. Taste was along the same lines, with a measure of coffee in there, but not overpowering, leaving caramel as the dominant flavor. Very, very smooth to the mouth, also very surprising but pleasant. Hides the higher alcohol nicely. Not my favorite of styles, but a very good effort."
"Overall, Salvator Doppel Bock is a pretty decent brew that is worth a try."
"D: Drinkable, I enjoyed this beer and could definitely have a few in a session."
"Very nice representation of the style at a good price. There is always room for this one in my fridge."
"Poured a deep, clear amber with a decent tan head that withdrew with a quickness. Smelled of deep roasted malts and fruity esters. Not a hint of hops coming through. Roasted malts are present again in the taste along with notes of fruits and honey; and a slight warming from the alcohol. I'm enjoying this very much. Raisins and grapes come through and it ends with a crisp, dry finish. Surprisingly light in body with a high drinkability, given the alcohol content."
"D - Another very good beer from Paulaner has great taste thats easy to drink the alcohol warmth is pretty light worth trying"
"Overall a pretty decent beer. A bit too caramel-sweet for my tastes, but a welcome change from the Kölsch that everyone seems to love so much."
"Highly drinkable, almost to a fault. It would be very easy to drink this too fast. Take your time and enjoy."
"This beer was a beautiful ruby red color, but didn't quite have the head that I was hoping for. It had a delicious malty sweetness and tasted just like a true doppelbock should. You probably wouldn't want to sit around and drink a whole bunch of these things but if you are in the mood to be warmed up by a nice brew, definitely grab this one. To me, it tasted precisely like a fine doppelbock should."
"The balance isn't perfect, but the adventure makes up for it. An underrated beer by a long shot."
"On the whole this is an enjoyable beer. Easy to drink and hard to believe it packs a 7.9% punch. Be careful."
"D - Enjoyable and potent... Seems like more than 7.5% ABV going down... Excellent brew to unwind with a savor..."
"Very thin head and zero lacing, but impressive color - a dark but clear reddish brown. Light but pleasant aroma. Unfortunately, the taste was very disappointing, especially since I typically enjoy both Doppelbocks and Paulaners; there was little flavor at first, and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel was fine, but drinkability suffered from the taste."
"this beer pours a deep reddish amber with a thick rocky head that fades to lacing the aroma is a sweet carmel with traces of fruit esters. the taste follows suite with a sweet maltiness and the caramel flavor really comes through there, the little bottom feeders produce quite a nice dry bite to counterpoint the malt. I'd love to sit in Munchen and pound down a few."
"D: yeah, this is good stuff, nice balanced dopplebock, with medium abv...could pound these down no problem!"
"D: 1 sip maximum."
"D: Very refreshing - would be wonderful on a hot day when you want to get drunk! It's pretty light, so I could see myself drinking a lot of it."
"My first try of the dopplebock style and I am impressed. This is a nice estery, malty brew that would be good with some gruyere. Cheers."
"drinkability is great. perfect balance. great fruit and malt character. an excellent example of the style. i'll be looking forward to a few more glasses of this one while it's available."
"D: Overall, this beer was OK, but it didn't do much for me. Like I said, there was a harshness about it that took the fun out of it."
"Smells of malt and not much else. Pours to a brown orange with a slight head. Taste is sweet and tart. Pure malts no bitterness until the aftertaste and then only slightly. AC is not real evident only slightly in the middle of taste where it glides across the tongue and to a point just before the aftertaste. Super smooth and tasty brew."
"I was interested to learn that many Doppelbocks end in ""ator"" with Salvator (Savior) being the first brewed by the monks as ""liquid bread."" Others include Ayinger Celebrator, Spaten Optimator, and Tucher Bajuvator. I enjoyed this one chilled in a goblet. Poured a nice iced tea color. Aroma was of sweet malts, caramel, slight chololate. Taste was smooth of raisin, caramel, touch of hops, and a pinch of anise. Good brew to sip after dinner."
"D - Overall this is an okay Dopplebock that has a nice bit of flavor to it and is not overly complex. The one thing that would prevent me from buying this again is that Celebrator is just as easy to find and much better. Also that orange peel aspect gets to me after awhile."
"drinkability is great, especially for a doppelbock, great carbonation coupled with the great balance ends with a smooth and refreshing bock that goes down great."
"D: A milder version of this style. Could enjoy multiples and would pair great with brie."
"This is really quite a delightful drink, and I can see how the monks would consider it a meal in itself!"
"Drinkable but not likely I'll buy this again"
"Overall- Great full flavor and aroma."
"to like bocks but didn't expect to like this one so much I can tell that it's a strong beer (7.9%) but it's not overwhelming. Highly recommended. I think I will look for a 6 pack so I can share it with friends"
"The aroma is of caramel malts and apples. It is dense and complex with bready maltiness all the way through. It leaves its mark on the tongue as you are left with malted caramel barley feel. Overall it a good beer to savor and enjoy. You can barely taste the 7.9% abv. I found it was hidden well."
"Overall not my bag, but if you like this style I could see how it is quality brewed and probably a good brew. I'll leave these to someone else."
"Anyway, really appealing golden color, no head, low carbonation. Smells really sweet and brown sugary. Tastes similarly. There's some hop bitterness on the very front end, but after that it's all malt sweetness, brown sugar, caramel. It's easy to miss the hops because they're only there for a second, and if you do, it tastes really cloyingly sweet. Honestly, it's still going to be hard to get through this. It's very thick and syrupy."
"Sweetness is a factor and it becomes a little too much for me. Overall, it's tasty and a nice break from the norm."
"I can't not like a Doppelbock and this one doesn't buck the trend. Definitely more spiced and bitter than most I've had."
"This one isn't as syrup-y as other dopplebocks I've had .. very smooth, almost butter-like mouthfeel. Pretty much one bottle gives me a warm happy buzz."
"This one comes with the weight of expectation--in my ten years of legality, I have somehow not imbibed this epitome of the genre...lighter brown orange effervescent body... white head is thin but bubbly and symmetrical...sweet, malty aroma with a lesser sense of soft hops... a soft palate with warming effects around the tongue--little fiz--surprisingly drinkable for a doppel... malt is pleasant, not intrusive; in fact, astonishingly tastes like a full-bodied, trumped-up lager... crisp and clean, with sugars appropriately placed... the name may precede itself, but the taste follows through--and I saved this bock sample for Good Friday... ""liquid bread"" indeed, and a little bit of soul food after a chocolate-free Lenten journey..."
"Fantastic doppelbock. Good any time of year."
"d: Very smooth. Nice beer. Hard to disagree with a classic of the doppelbock genre!"
"D: Perfect for the start of cool spring days. Strength limits me to one at a time."
"D - not my style, but, this was very tasty and easily enjoyable"
"D - An excellent and easily drinkable example of the style. The malt character is great, and the alcohol notes are rich and rum like without being hot."
"D = a Very drinkable doppelbock, kind of rough around the edges but that's what gives it it's charm. I like that it is a little less refined than some other German doppelbocks. definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: This really is a good, drinkable double bock. It's straightforward but tasty. The alcohol is well hidden and this is easily enjoyed."
"This beer pours an amber color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is of big caramel, with hints of dark fruit. The taste is a lot like the aroma. The mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation, and a syrupy texture. Overall, this is a fine doppelbock. I will certainly drink this again."
"D - Pleasant surprise and can't wait for another."
"MF&D- The beer is medium bodied although light for this style. It has an initial hop spice with a slightly sticky feel that coats the mouth with a warm alcohol finish. The beer leaves behind a sticky syrup like coat after it has been swallowed. This beer is top notch and a great example (taste wise) of this style. Jump on this if you get a chance, but beware of the 7.9 ABV. I drank one of these and started to get that warm happy feeling."
"Definitely one I will be adding to my list of favorites."
"MF&D - A little thinner than I'm used to for a Double Bock, but don't be fooled the 7.9% ABV packs a punch. This is a delicious beer, although I wouldn't recommend sessioning this one. Great cool weather option."
"Not half bad, but not great either. The Celebrator is still my doppelbock of choice, which perhaps makes all other comparisons unfair, but for its price this beer is great to enjoy either with some particularly heavy fare, smooth cheese, or even on its own. Or a slice of German chocolate cake."
"D: It is a very drinkable beer. The relative high alcohol content means that I would stop after a few, but I would always revisit this beer."
"D: some alcohol, nice winter sipping beer."
"Poured from a 16.9oz. bottle in a mug. Dark brown/red color. Small head that dissipated quickly. Smelled of dark fruit, apples, and malt. Taste is very similar to the aroma, with a touch of hops. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is medium and is nicely carbonated. This beer is surprisingly refreshing and very tasty."
"All in all, not a bad beer; extremely appealing to the eye but not so much to the mouth."
"I really like doppelbocks but this one is a shadow of its former self."
"D - Didn't care too much for this one. Too many unpleasant feels in the mouth and the alcohol taste is too strong. This is what a double bock is supposed to be, or close to I think. Just not my favorite personally, but a good example of the style."
"D - Very good."
"D: Tasty but I think the sweetness hurts its drinkability. That at the high alcohol. A good doppelbock, but not the best."
"Overall a nicely balanced brew , maybe a little hoppy and light, but enjoyable."
"Very nice, although a tad cloying."
"Drinkability: This is a really delicious doppelbock. Rightfully so. I'd still say Celebrator edges it out, though, in smoothness, chewiness, and complexity. I'd have no problem consuming a couple of these in a long evening."
"This beer is pretty drinkable, the only real distraction is the alcohol on the nose and tongue."
"In a word, excellent."
"Reddish brown. Excellent clarity. Fine tan headed diminished quickly. Malty, bready and yeasty flavors in the foreground with some rich melanoidin flavor. Some hop bitterness, spicy hop flavor and alcohol in the background. Medium-full body (gave a lighter impression due to carbonation). Warm finish from alcohol. Very nice beer."
"overall, i really enjoyed this but at $5 a pint at the liqour store, i think i can find better dopples"
"Clearish reddish amber colored beer with off white head. Smell is sweet, sour malt, kind of like a maarzen or heller bock style smell. Taste is deep strong malt, a touch of bitterness and a definite noticeable alcohol taste that really detracts from the beer. Alcohol is more noticeable as it sits and really makes it less enjoyable. I was dissapointed by this beer."
"I could drink this stuff all day, and pretty much did."
"This beer is worthy of its benchmark status by being the dopplebock which all other dopplebocks are judged against. Surely in my top 5 for the style."
"Definitely a winner."
"Originaly had this beer on-tap, decided to try it from the bottle. Poured this beer into a pint glass,It poured a dark amber color, with a 3 finger head, that went away quickly and left little to no laceing. There was a bit of an alcohol tasted in the first hit, but it smoothes out to a malty flavor with a bit of a friut aftertaste. The mouthfeel of this beer was a little heavy, with a bit of a dry feel after it leaves your mouth. Overall, this is another quality brew from paulaner. Recomended for fans of paulaner and fans of dopplebocks."
"Again nice caramel malts with sweet fruits. Good medium body and well carbonated. Smooth and drinkable, but not super complex. A bit of a bitting off flavor in the finish."
"Germans make awsom beer! I love Doppel Bock and this one is no exception. Red copper in color head was a little smale though. Taste was sweet malty a little medicinal. Mouthfeel was mediem to heavy in body though carbonation was moderit. Drinkability well lets just say I wish I hade another."
"I remember this beer much more fondly than is probably warranted. I had this almost 20 years ago when anything over a 6% ABV was very hard to find in this country. The beer pours a reddish, copper color, not much head, no lacing, not much retention. The beer has a slight medicinal smell, malty, and that sweet caramel aroma that is very characteristics of marzen style beers. There isn't a heap of carbonation in this one, but thats quite characteristic of the style. The beer is tilted towards medium bodied. The taste is acerbic towards the finish, a bit flat throughout, sweet malts in the middle, and almost a candied fruitiness in the background. I let this beer settle hoping for better, but I still got that medicinal, slightly metallic, candied fruitiness, and flat taste. This is not my favorite by a stretch. I had much fonder rememberances of this and I almost wish I didn't re-try it. This is a complex beer, but that doesn't mean that I want to try it again."
"This is definetly a warmer. It is also very smooth."
"It pours a nice amber color with about 2 fingers of tan head that dissipated slowly. It smells of sweet malts and has a nice flavor of malts. This beer is very delicious and i would recommend it. It has some nice lacing and leaves a pleasant taste with a good mouthfeel."
"I've had Salvator a smattering of times over the years, but typically only if I am brewing/drinking something in the same style... Really pretty good... alot better as it approached room temperature."
"This is a very easy-to-drink and easy-to-enjoy Doppelbock from Paulaner."
"M + D: There's a bit of body to this, which saves it a fair bit and makes it into something I can find far more drinkable. It carries a touch of heaviness and a bit of a viscid quality allowing the flavour to fill out in the mouth. I would go with another one of these, but there are more robust out there as far as dopplebocks go."
"This bottle pours out a deep amber,with a fingers worth of off white head that disapates rather quickly leaving behind little to no lacing.The aromas are very strong there is a lot of sweetness,but it comes through with hints of tomatoe soup,and honey.The taste was not as complex as other doppels that I have enjoyed,this one is a bit tame and actually has a more intriguing aroma than taste,it does have a lot of tasty carmel malts,not sugary malts like i was excpecting,but darker and richer,with more texture than average.The mouthfeel is nicely done,very light,but you still know there is some quality in there.As far a drinkability for a doppel I think it is very drinkable,would love to down another,I enjoyed its simple structure."
"A medium amber color with a touch of gold along the bottom of the glass. A quater inch thick head forms, cream in colored, dissolves away quickly. A strong malty fragrance dominates the aroma, touches of dried fruit, like raisons and currants follow. It does end the slight twinge of alchol at the end. As expected malty sweetness envelops the palate and dominates the flavor almost all the way through. That is when slight bit of bitterness at the end, but is almost non-existant. The feel is a medium-heavy feel, with a sticky texture, it clings to the palate. This is a very good beer, a big surprise the Germans make good beer. This brings strong malt flavor for a lager and would be a great counter to IPA or Double IPA in a tasting."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a decent tan head that dissipated fairly quick into nothingness. No lacing, no cap, no ring. Very light for a doppelbock. The smell is of lightly roasted malt and candied fruit. A bit surprised to smell a roasted aroma due to the light appearance of the brew. Salvator starts off with a big caramel malt blast, bready, which is followed by a subtle but noticable alcohol hit. There are some candied fruit notes. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, finishes on the sweeter side with a bit of an alcohol burn. Not what I expected in a doppelbock. The alcohol is there but I expected much more malt. The taste is fine and enjoyable but doesn't seem to be the same beer as other doppelbocks that I have had."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Smokestack Goblet. Poured a clear red amber with a nice 1 inch head that left no lacing down the glass. Aroma is pretty straightforward. There are caramel malts up front with a slight aroma of spices. Taste is pretty much the same except there is a warming alcohol tinge at the tail of the beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slight carbonation that dissipates. This is a decent beer but not one of my favorites of Paulaner."
"Don't like this one as well as the Ayinger Celebrator but this is probably my second favorite doppelbock."
"After seeing this beer in Michael Jackson's great beer book, had high hopes for this rendition of Paulaner's doppelbock, especially after loving their Hefeweizen... unfortunately, this one did not live up to expectations... pours a ruby-red, mahogany brown color with a modest head... smell was full of figs and prunes... very malty, rich and thick, as the taste strongly resembled and complemented the aroma... flavor was way too sweet to be truly enjoyable... rich, thick, full of prunes, figs, slight caramel, and heavy maltiness failed to impress... very artificial essence... better examples of the style out there... Not recommended..."
"This is a fine warming brew."
"D: The taste makes the drinkability very high, but the 7.9% ABV is something to watch out for. It's easy to go overboard."
"Poured at 54F, it looks crystal clear and with a decent head of foam which dissipates rather quickly. As has been written before me, the malty sweetness rises into your nose along with some medium strong alcohol. Slightly reminiscent of old Dr. Browns black cherry soda gone flat. Taste is bready, of course. The carbonation plays very well with it, as do the easy going hops. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but not unpleasant. I really like this beer for a number of reasons. I'm normally a hop freak, but am starting my journey to the other side. This beer represents something that I can drink regularly. One of my favorite no-brainers right now."
"D - Like it. Not a favorite, but pretty interesting beer."
"Drinkability- Not sessionable, but a pretty good representation of the style,"
"Its well made, enjoyable, warming, and recommended."
"D- it's heavy man, real heavy. like eating 1/2 loaf of bread. and a high abv. that being said, i wouldn't really crush a sixer of this, but it does taste great."
"D: This is a good transitional beer into or out of winter beers. I could enjoy this all night long."
"D - Overall a nicely drinkable brew. With the higher ABV wouldn't suggest maybe more than 2 of these in a night"
"Copper brown appearance with a medium sized head. Meager lacing. Communion grape juice smell with alcohol and a little breadiness. Slight caramel taste with roasted malt. Sweet brew. Chewy breadiness to it with alcohol flavor and feel. Nice beer to sit down to on a wonderful New Beer Sunday. Go get some of this beer."
"drinkability - Noticed this was bottled in Dec 2006 nice. I wonder if they bottle the brew for a year. I just bought it like a month ago. Real nice tasty beer. Would buy again"
"330 mL bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a clear reddish gold with a decent but quickly diminishing head. Strong aroma of malt and alcohol. First taste is sweet and powerful. The alcohol feels noticeable through the sweetness. I can't say I drink many doppelbocks, so I suppose my review will end up being more of the style in general than of the specific nuances of this beer witihin its style. Too sweet for these tastebuds."
"D - Unfortunately very easy to drink. The taste is very deceiving. You don't realize how much alcohol is in there until you have had 2 or 3 in a half hour and when you get halfway through the 4th it all hits you at once. It tastes like a beer with 4-5% but kicks like a beer with 10-11%. Its very easy to drink."
"Paulaner Salvator DoppleBock is my favorite beer. Hands Down. No questions asked...no exceptions. This beer is really strong. I can barely drink a six pack of it and after that Im 9 shits to the wind. I love the rich dark coffee like malty aroma I come to expect from my favorite beers. I should note with my reviews you wont find any technical aspects here...just a philosophical type review about the goodness of a beer. Consider my reviews a commercial for whatever beer I'm reviewing. Again this beer is quite a delight if you have the luxury of having a store that carries it. A dark, rich malty beer from the heartland of beer. Never a dull moment. White people love wayne brady becuase he makes bryant gumble look like malcom x."
"D) A really good beer even though its not my primary style."
"It seems to me that this beer gotten lighter over the years; however, it's also an excellent double bock. Pours with a nice fine full light tan head. Clear brownish dark amber. Nose is malty toffee, a bit roasty, hint of hops. Seems to have become more of a session beer over time. The flavor is the same as nose but lots more going on. Not overly sweet or heavy. Great finish."
"Not one I'd buy again, but am happy I've tried."
"D: Very drinkable, and to be enjoyed with consideration of its ABV. I will definitely explore this style some more, maybe at home next time."
"Drinkability: Good beer, but nothing to go out of your way for. I would try if you were a fan of the style, but not a must buy. Also, I let it sit for a long while, and it improved a lot as it warmed."
"Had this on tap a second time. Increased the drinkability to reflect how good a pint is with some food. Less sweetness this time and a bit more toffee richness. This is one elegant beer on tap."
"poured out quite dark as expected. this was the first double bock that I had tried and was pleasently suprised. The taste is very sweet at first and begins to mellow out as the beer warms up. The higher alcohol content comes through with the warm aftertaste. Mouthfeel is quite heavy, as this is a double-bock. I really enjoyed drinking it however and look foward to exploring other doubles"
"Poured out of 12oz bottle into Biere du Boucanier snifter. Poured a clear copper brown color with thick foamy whit head. Smells of bread maltness, alcohol, with a slight dried fruit aroma. Taste is heavy on the malt and sweetness of carmel and toffee with a sticky thick mouthfeel. Alcohol is there with very little bitterness. This sipper is pretty sweet and has a very present alcohol feel which makes this beer a moderate level of drinkability."
"Got to have this on tap at the Flying Saucer. As good as it gets. Not as complex on tap but lots of maltiness."
"pours a clear bright copper color with a two finger light tan head that fades quickly to just beer. smells of caramel, alcohol, with a hint of fruit. salty at the tip of the tongue then sweet then the taste of alcohol and caramel. mouthfeel was light, mild, carbonation turned flat, which i do not like. a little disappointed with this beer but have not tried any other double bocks to compare."
"D: Overall this is a beer to be enjoyed one at a time, at the end of a day. It is almost too rich to even try another one. This is one to sit down and enjoy slowly while doing some thinking...or not thinking...just enjoying!"
"I found it very good, but very strong and not something I would drink on a regular basis because of this. Maybe something as a treat every now and again for sure. The appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel were very good and I found the drinkability a little better; it did not get a 5 only because of how strong it is. I know, I know. Great beer though."
"Overall this is a very good beer and an excellent and well-rounded example of the style."
"Yeah my first taste of Salvator. I have passed this by many a time just to go out and try stuff that isnt always around, well I am gonna try it today. Poured a very nice deep dark brown with a good two inches of off white tan colored head. This faded and nestled own leaving a thin film and some side glass lace. The smell was nce and smoky with a bit of an earthy grain mixed in. A touch of some caramel and sweetness as well. The flavor was very tight. Crisp clean and efficent flavor, lots of malt, nice smoky flavors with a touch of caramel. A great smooth feel with no sense of the alcohol at all. I could have easily had another of these. Overall this was awesome. I love German brews and this was no exception. It definitly deserves the rep it has, this is a really good dopplebock and something I am glad is readily avaibke to me whenever I want it."
"I do like the beer but it is not something that I would want more than one in a sitting."
"Worth a try, but not one of Paulaner's better beers."
"Notes: Complex flavor, it's a treat to have something different like this. I don't think I'd want a second one due to the heavy, syrupy nature, but wouldn't mind having a few in the fridge."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Dopple Bock, but not complex enough"
"EDIT: just noticed the ""produced date"" is 11/06. A year old beer."
"A good example of a often misused style."
"Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, and the alcohol is well hidden."
"Comment: Great winter beer...warming and sufficiently complex to be entertaining."
"This brew pours a nice amber with a decent which eventually just laces the edge of the glass. Aroma is very malty, biscuity with some light caramel. taste is fruity but not very sweet, a little alcohol is noticeable with some hops there to balance the brew. Very dry and grainy finish but smooth. Still not as good as Celebrator, but a classic and very drinkable beer."
"D. I would like to drink this one with my favorite light cigars...This drinks almost of a light brandy. I liked it and some day would like to taste again."
" Salvator was recommended by another ""ba"" reviewer of my favorite beer, Spaten Optimator and I am glad that I followed through with it. I rated Optimator better but really Salvator is quite good. Highly recommend it."
"I had a good amount of this beer on tap at the German Beer Fest last night. I really like the cascading appearance of the rich, red color. The smell was strong, as is the taste. Very rich and full taste. A mouthfeel very strong and full and very nice. The high ABV makes it not incredibly drinkable. You can drink it all night, like I did last night, but it won't do you very good the next day. I know from current experience."
"Appears reddish brown with a thin tan head. The beer smells sweet like carmel but also has an alcohol-type aroma much the way wine does. It tastes sweet too. Malty and carmely. There's a hint of an alcohol-warming afterglow down the throat soon after you swallow it. There's a low amount of carbonation. I see very few bubbles rising to the top of the glass and it seems to be a little on the flat side. I like this beer but I wouldn't drink too many of them in one day. That would be like gorging yourself on Milk Duds. The 7.9% alcohol would catch up with you quickly, too, I presume."
"D - A tasty beer thats worth trying. Good every now and then but nothing I'd rush for again."
"An enjoyable beer, but one best served late at night to enjoy alone."
"D: A drinkable beer, hides its alcohol character quite well until you stand up. A very deep caramel flavor makes this a very enjoyable Octoberfest beer. Mighty enjoyable for nearly 8% and rivals Belgian styles of similar strength for drinkability."
"Excellent, and true to style."
"The aroma is of ripe cherries, sugar cane and european dark honey. Taste is pine nuts, resin, gooey figs. This reminds me of a rich, liquor-infused tort cake. Nice balanced taste with dates-figs fruit, nutty dryness and bitterness with a smooth texture. Similar to a good after-dinner liquer aftertaste, warmth and alcohol but not the least bit offensive. Sweetness overtones seem natural and unforced ... overall, a really tasty doppel bock. Nearing the end of the glass, the lacing and carbonation have all but disappeared but the overall impression remains positive."
"Drinkability: Stout, solid, and with an alcoholic punch that will kick you in your keizter if you arent careful, Salvator is simply just a great Doppelbock."
"Pours amber brown,with a thin tan head. Not much retention,but decent lacing. Aroma is of sweet dark fruits,and candy. Body is thin,and a bit watery. Taste is sugared,almost too sweet.Alchol is big in the finish. Not awful,but I was expecting better."
"Overall, this is such a classic and iconic beer that reviews are almost unnecessary. If you're a fan of Bock then drink it once in a while as a reminder of the rich history of central European beers. I don't drink too much Doppelbock, but I know there's better-tasting ones out there than Salvator... but I still have a lot of respect for this brew."
"Drinkability: This beer is not worth its ABV. If I wanted something this strong, I'd go for something with a more intense flavor; if I wanted something less intense, I'd go for something with less alcohol. Next time, I'll make it an EKU 28 or a Yebisu Black. What a shame this beer is so popular."
"D - Nice solid flavor, not overpowering ... exceptional drinkability. A very refreshing, balanced and flavorful beer."
"I probably prefer the aroma over the flavor as it was just about perfect to me in this moment. This is still quite tasty & over all this is just a great Doppel Bock. I have had this beer a few times over the years and I don't remember it being so striking, but such is the nature of beer, sometimes you just have to be in the right situation for a beer and this happens to be one of those. This really captures that meaty malt character that I really like to find in a Doppelbock."
"The balanced complexity made me smile before I got the first swallow down. Fresh sawn hardwood and pumpernickel bread swirled by a warm alcohol breeze. The finish was dry and mildly sour but the aftertaste was pleasantly clean leading the way to another swig. Creamy with a not-too-full body and a nice light carbonation. This superbly crafted lager made me sad that I only grabbed one out of the armful I left with from the bottle shop. That won't happen again."
"Salvator Doppel Bock pours a reddish copper color with a thick off white head. There is a full, malty aroma. The flavor is sweet malt all the way, there are absolutely no noticeable hops. The flavor is sort of one dimensional, but it's not a bad dimension. Recommended."
"The taste is classic, toffee and caramel from a hefty chewy malt base, toasty, slightly fruity and spices too, alcohol presence is obvious but not distracting. The body is smooth, clean, a bit crisp, round and medium or so. In all, its a classic, a goodie, a standard, and, oh ya, quite tasty."
"Better than some other doubles I've encountered, but my far not the worst."
"D: Goes down easy despite the abv. Since I only bought one, I'm glad it was in a big bottle. Excellent brew - just shy of Ayinger Celebrator."
"D- This is fairly easy to drink taste wise but because of the way it coats your mouth i'd have to say drinkability suffers."
"Poured a copper-red with nice head that hung around for a while. Sweet maltiness, but with a bit of an offensive metallic taste. Fruity and malty aroma. Taste the alcohol on the finish. Its ok, but maybe this just isn't my style. Medium body and light carbonation."
"Mostly clear and not as dark as most doppelbocks but nonetheless pours a rich, reddish amber with a generous amount of just-off-white head that falls away into a collar of tight foam. Carbonation is higher and more persistent than expected and carries over into a pleasant crispness in the mouthfeel that offsets the cling of the malts. Nose is medium-bodied yet bold and pretty complex with a solid malt base complemented with some medium-ripe fruit and spice. Those notes carry over to the taste, where the malts are the featured player but don't overshadow the other flavors. I don't think this fits the squarely in the style, but it's a fine, fine beer."
"D - This is a very fine dopplebock. One of the better beers in Paulaner's line."
"Its obvious alcohol and sweet, thick malty body reduce the drinkability of this dopple. Also somewhat one dimensional, the lack of depth also impacts the drinkability. It was a solid brew, and well worth trying. Next time i need a dopple fix ill be going to Ayinger's Liberator or Spaten's Optimator, as they both have more of the depth of malty character that i prefer from this style."
"Zero particulates."
"Drinkability: Seems like this is the lightest of the doppelbocks. Goes down easily and has some great qualities, but for the price I personally would go for something with stronger characteristics of the style. I'd pick this up again, but not immediately. Seems more of a bock to me."
"D - A well made Double Bock that's reputation is well known. High standards of quality and great taste make this an easy choice in the bock category."
"I tried this on July 5, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO store. It poured a beautiful translucent reddish into the glass with very little head. The aroma was that of malts and fruits (apricotish). The mouthfeel is full-bodied, very smooth and crisp with a hint of carbonation. The taste is smooth with hints of yeast, malt and some sweetness and goes down very well. One of those beers that tastes better at the finish than it does at the beginning. Nothing overpowering. A very nice beer."
"D: Very good for a dopplebock, this beer shows you that medieval monks did not mind their Lenten fasts. A quality production."
"D: All in all, this is a rather well-balanced beer, which doesn't seem to be the case at first. But after it warms a bit, and the flavors come out more, the taste of alcohol fits in quite well. Overall, a pretty good dopplebock, true to style, tasty, and refreshing."
"Zum Wohl!!!"
"D: Very drinkable brew, one of my favorites. It makes a nice companion to Celebrator. That beer has the chocolate, toffee flavor down pat while this brew has less of the chocolate taste and more of the “bread” taste going for it. I could definitely drink this every night."
"also be interesting to note that the Salvator is Paulaner's pioneer brew."
"D: Booyeah, Ill have another please. With all that flavor and alcohol, it still is highly drinkable. Not as great as Celebrator, but as the Original it gets heavy props."
" The post-Heineken brew has initial taste of traditional Salvator. That taste quickly vanishes like a fleeting dream, dissipating to weak metallic tang with absolutely no finish. The abv is increased to 7.9%, but I don't buy Salvator to drink Colt 45. If one didn't know better, the current Salvator is a good beer. The crime is that it replaces a truly great beer, a beer with a history that began in 1634 and inspired many other Doppelbocks. I hope that Paulaner-Heineken sees fit to return to their traditonal recipe for Salvator."
"Had this beer many times. Nice copper color. No head retention though. Very little lace work. Smell is nice malty sweet, caremel, and alcohol are noticeable one the nose. This beer is very drinkable and complex in mouthfeel, peppery after taste lingers hops are slightly noticable, caramel and malt flavours come through nicely along with the alcohol. All in all a very good doppelbock."
"I would give it a higher rating if not for being oversweet for my taste."
"M/D: very creamy with a nice smooth sensation that is medium bodied. very good very drinkable i enjoy it alot and at almost 8% you dont notice it"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a snifter. The beer poured a deep amber, forming a 1 inch head that quickly faded. Medium spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is light, mostly of sweet malt. The flavor is roasted malt, with a slight hint of alcohol. Nothing too complex. Medium mouthfeel. Smooth enough finish, but not something I could consume all evening. Overall, a decent enough brew. Worth a try!"
"Drinkability: Great, for being 7.9% this is a very drinkable beer. Very smooth and a perfect balance of sweetness. This beer also follows the style guidelines quite well."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Busy and lush, the texture here registers at the higher end of comfortable... it backswells in the mouth and goes down smooth and easy. I find doppelbocks in general to be ""one-beer"" beers, so I will score drinkability accordingly... this is a rich, hearty, tasty brew that will have VIP access to this refrigerator any old time."
"I'm just NOT a sweet beer guy."
"Overall, I like it and I will drink it again."
"D= At its 7.9ABV I'm not sure how session-drinkable this is, but it's definitely extremely drinkable so long as one's tolerance lasts."
"Clear orange out of the bottle and deep brownish orange in the glass. Not much head at all. Sweet malty smell as per the style. Very sweet flavor. Mouthfeel is just a bit thinner than other doppelbocks; but this isn't a knock against this beer. It's very crisp and clean without being watery. In the end, though, it's just too sweet without any other prominent flavors to balance it out. For me this is better than Celebrator, but not as good as Optimator."
"D - Dangerously drinkable at 7.9%, When this beer is cold, its alcohol is virtually indistinguishable, and its thirst quenching bitterness make a great sessionable beer."
"I found this to be a very good beer. You could almost make a meal out of this sucker. Very tasty indeed. Recommended."
"Even with the alcohol detected it remains fairly drinkable somehow. Not a turnoff at all."
"All in all a fine German brew."
"*Beer blogger Ron Pattinson shares an interesting article on the history of the Salvator recipe on his site here: http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2008/06/salvator.html"
"Mouthfeel was smooth with mild carbonation. Medium body."
"Good doppel bock with a solid, chocolately flavor. It is a dark amber color. Very smooth, but has a slight alcohol aftertaste. I'm not a dark beer drinker, but this has a great, unique flavor. It almost has a smoky taste to it."
"Drinkability- The alcohol dominates this beer, especially as it warms. I think it makes it a bit unpleasant to drink at times. Has a decent flavor and when the mood strikes, this is a pretty decent brew."
"A very nice Doppelbock, though I would rather have a bottle of Optimator or Celebrator. But it's certainly worthy of trying, especially for those with an interest in German beers."
"I was really wowed recently after trying Celebrator Doppelbock, so I decided to another that I associate with being tradition of the style. Paulaner Doppelbock pours a red/orange, a bit lighter than I expected with a thick and creamy head. Aroma is a clean, slightly grainy maltiness, with hints of brown sugar or caramel in the background. Taste starts off clean and even a bit light but rich sweet malt quickly dominates. This beer achieves a great balence between the being rich and sweet without being syrupy. There is just a bit of roasted flavor in the aftertaste, and no real hop flavor or aroma. I'm glad I picked this one up, its really delicious and a great deal for the price."
"On tap at Stone Gardens. Arrived in a tulip glass a dark cloudy amber/red. Smell was caramalized sugars, cherries, alcohol. A strong smelling beer to say the least. The taste was more of the same and was perhaps a bit too sweet for me. Still this is very tasty beer, the warming effects are notcieable and i think this would be great on a late fall night in front of the fire. This is a one and done type, not one i could have that many of"
"Bottom line: This example of the style hits my palate very well. I can only recommend it!"
"Poured a deep slightly hazy orange with a decent head that was somewhat diminishing. The aroma was of burnt caramel with some molasses and dried fruits. Taste was also burnt caramel with some chocolate and a mild hop presence in the background. The alcohol was warming but well hidden and the beer was medium on the palate. This is a very enjoyable dobblebock."
"This dopplebock poured into my large tulip glass with a rich amber color. The glass I used allowed for a great, light tan, rich foamy head. It stayed around for enough time to really aid the great nose of malt and lingering streaks of toffee. Had a wonderful heavy malt taste, with slight bits of toffee, and fresh wheat bread with honey. This beer, for being so substantial, really had a very drinkable, medium bodied mouth feel. This beer is pairing great with my aged white cheddar, but don't rule out the schnitzel. Never rule out the schnitzel. I'll leave the fasting to the Monks...Enjoy"
"This one drinks almost too easy, but the sweetness can get overbearing if not taken in moderation. Maybe have a glass of water on hand to balance."
"D- very good dopplebock, drinkable over a long period of time, fills you up, recommended."
"D - Excellent. Although this is a little less full and rich than some of it's bretheren, it's very drinkable due to the less full body and the nice balancing hop flavors."
"An average beer at best."
"Salvator pours out a nice deep amber color thats not too dark with a nice smooth tan head and has a mild chocolaty smell. The head slowly dwindles into a thin layer with some decent lacing. It has a clean malty flavor that barely hides its alcohol which is really evident in its aftertaste, but it not bad at all."
"Pours an amber color with a dense, sticky beige colored head. Rich malt aromas of honey, caramel, vanilla, molasses, juicy fruits, and tea like herbals. Milder flavors than displayed in the nose with focus on toasted grains and subtle dry hops. Malt flavors of caramel and butterscotch lose ground to some alcohol burn. The finish is of sweet bread, mild fruit and malty. Medium body and low carbonation leaves a thin, silky mouthfeel that is fair at best, but I was wanting something more chewy. As it warms the alcohol becomes more noticeable and aids in enhancing a distracting metallic, phenolic taste."
"to people who like a lighter approach to the style. Very nice."
"This is a really enjoyable double bock, and it goes down almost too easily. You really don't detect that 7.9% because it's the rich malt flavors that keeps the tastebuds' attention throughout the drinking."
"Poured into a pint glass, the beer is dark red copperish color with a fairly good head. As expected, it's a very sweet and heavy beer. Flavors such as chocolate chip and sweet bread are noticable through this meal in a bottle, which can make you feel full in your stomach. Recall that I finished a very big dinner, so by now I'm really starting to feel stuffed. A yummy beer, but not reccommended if you plan to eat large quantities of food beforehand. I think by now I've emphasized enough how much this beer can fill you up."
"* I'd have to say that I enjoyed this beer more than other beers I ranked around the same number, but this one just fell short for the style for me."
"Salvator is a quality doppelbock. Unique with the simple but interesting flavors. Good on this cold winter's night. An easily enjoyable beer that's also easy to find."
"I used to keep more of these on hand. Very approachable and affordable to boot."
"Pours a brilliant, bright dark amber, very clear, with a luminous yellowed white head that forms generous lacing around the sides of the glass. Aromas are rich and supple. Generous caramel malt notes back up a slightly spicy/smoky note. On the palate, extremely smooth and highly carbonated, with some initial bitterness being replaced quickly by a burst of sweetness at the mid-palate. The finish dries out considerably, although it still leaves a slight trace of candy-like malts as a reminder. Very thick, very substantial beer here -- one that I would only want to drink a couple of. Still, it's an excellent example of the doppelbock style."
"M&D - worthy of quality doppel bock status, easy down, smooth, palatable, even the girlfriend liked it, paulaner sure brews some quality beers"
"Cheers!"
"Fun brew. It seems to float around with many flavors not knowing which direction to head. If Salvator took root and grew a little, it would blossom."
"The flavor is not as rich as I remembered in the past, but there is a fair bit of maple and some hop notes which is nice.I also really like this balance of this beer."
"D - A good beer, with a solid and unique flavor; the alchol will get you (I was feeling it after a half a bottle), so that would limit you"
"Verdict: I was suprised with the lack of complexity given the recognition this beer gets, but the flavors that were there were good atleast. It's possible my bottle was too old but I was disapointed with the flat, cloying mouthfeel."
"I was introduced to this brand by a relative stationed in Germany. I have not looked back since then. This is a great beer when you want to sit back and watch a game without having to drink more than 12 beers. This will definetly make you feel stuffed. This is a darker beer not for light beer drinkers with a higher alchohol level."
"Pours a clear orange color with a thin head of small off white bubbles. Aroma is malty sweet with hints of dried peaches and plumbs. Full, creamy, tick mouthfeel. You may have to chew this one. Taste mimics the aroma. Dried peaches stand out to me. Lingers into the aftertaste. Dried fruit stays with you throughout the beer. Awesome winter beer, but one that you have to be in the mood for. Must be a very high final gravity Since Im a huge dork, I broke out the hydrometer. 1.022. High, but not quite as high as expected. Once again, a great beer and a must buy this time of year."
"I like this brew. More complex than most, not as complex as some."
"This beer was a cherry red almost like fresh brewed tea. Head vanished in just a couple seconds. Head was light tan smells like the barley was burnt or overroasted. Taste was a heavy malt flavor with burnt oat flavors. Also hints of honey. Mouthfeel was thick, but too much carbonation. Drinkability is average to a little under average."
"This brew pours translucent coppery orange with a thin tan head. Nose is sweet alcohol, some malts, and purple plums. Taste is malty and a bit smoky even, with alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly above average, and drinkability is pretty good."
"D: An easy-drinking, smooth doppelbock - good flavors. This is one I've had several times before and will be sure to have again."
"Drinkability: very easy quaffing beer. Worth picking this one up."
"With such a high abv I wouldn't drink a lot of these at one sitting."
"I enjoyed it overall, for the alchohol content and style it's pretty drinkable."
"Which does, if nothing else, make this brew easy to drink. Far from my favorite Doppelbock, but I'm more than content drinking this one."
"Fine balance of flavours and alcohol content, but the mouthfeel is watery for the strenght of this beer, which is why my scores are all over the place. I don't understand how the first taste of every sip is so good, but the mouthfeel is so weak, strange."
"This is perhaps the most drinkable dopplebock that I've enjoyed. While it's not my favorite of the style, it is quite an enjoyable brew."
"D- Only second to Korbinian in my mind. Looks,smells and taste is moreish. Could drink all night, just beware the alcohol content. Superb!"
"This beer is high gravity in disguise! Pours a transparent amber with a lively light tan head. Smells sweet and malty. Taste is dominated by malts, with only the slightest touch of hops. Very smooth for such a strong beer. This could be a good session beer if you desired a shorter session!"
"A nice beer with only some tradional qualities of the style. Would go well with smoked mozzarella. A nice beer to have in the right situation. Too sweet to have multiples, but worth it to highlight flavors during a multiple course meal."
"Drinkability - I like this beer. I would like a second and that would be good enough for any evening. A nice steak would pair will with this beer."
"had this for the first time at our MCD meeting this month. Poured very red ruby-colored...sparkly. short white head, nice lacing, looks very pretty. peaty, slightly smoky odor. fruity, alohol. Smokiness in the taste too. nice and malty and full-flavored beer. Fruity, smoky finish. supurb flavor. Full and almost syrupy mouthfeel. well balanced. easy to drink...nice and warming on a cold day. a definite go-to beer."
"D: Although it would be tough to drink more than a couple of these in one sitting, this is a very good doppelbock. It always seems to be a regular in my fridge. I'd love to cellar several bottles if I could only keep myself from drinking them too soon."
"Drinkability: It's somewhat more drinkable than other doppelbocks, but that's probably because the taste and mouthfeel aren't as overbearing as others."
"This is a wonderfully complex beer, but it is slightly out of balance. While DBs are dominated by the malts, there should be enough noble hops to offset any sweetness. The alcohol should only be apparent after standing up. Both residule sweetness and alcohol crept up on this beer. Otherwise, a decent after-diner sipping beer."
"Drinkability: easily a sessionably beer in the fall time."
"Flavor is a bit of a disappointment. Candy flavors are subdued and the malts are thing. Not strong and bold. No particular syrupy flavors for the style. And the alcohol is kind of prevailing above all. Medium body that is thin. or maybe it just feels thin thanks to the alcohol. However, very easy to drink because sometimes I find doppelbocks are a bit too sweet."
"The mouth is light, and not terribley complex. It is very drinkable. Not bad, but think the Celebrator easily trumps it."
"(D) - No, not at all. Didn't care for it one bit. I tried to drink it at all temperatures from cold to warm, and all it did was change ways in which it was sour and flat and not the good kind of bitter."
"The drinkability factor on this beer is kind of low because of how sweet it is. The flavor is pretty good but it gets on the cloying side towards the end of just one 12oz. serving."
"D: Pretty mild for 7.5% pleasant to drink in large sips at first, but the sweetness starts to overtake my mouth after awhile."
"Mouthfeel is good for the style, a little dry, but not damning by any means. Drinkability is good as well, especially for a stronger beer."
"All in all, it is true to the style and quite tasty. Perhaps a little unrefined, which I approve of wholeheartedly!"
"Overall: A solid dopplebock, definitely recommended."
"Pours a crystal clear light ruby-amber. Dense two-finger head with decent retention and light spotty lacing. Toasted pale malt nose with a herbal tea aroma. Very sweet pale malt and toasted notes upfront, followed by strong caramel and sorghum flavors. The sugar creates a slick but not cloying aftertaste, that is slowly dried by an earthy english hop flavor and timid bitterness that appropriatly balances the overall profile. The light carbonation and nearly full body allow a smooth mouthfeel, rich with malt flavor. Finshes residual but not overly so, with a touch of tea-like hop flavor. This has exceptional drinkability, and would make a great introduction to the style."
"D- Not one of my favorites. I prefer the Celebrator and the Optimator. Don't think it's to easy to drink either."
"Served in a mug, the beer pours a copper/red color with a thick tan head. The main aroma I can smell is caramel, but there's some roasted malt, alcohol and nuts too. The taste is very malty and bready, with some caramel and hop bitterness along with a noticable alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit syrupy. The drinkability would be higher except for the noticable alcohol in the beer. Overall it's good, but I expected a bit more out of this beer."
"Recommended!"
"Drinkability: This was a very good beer, I was pleased. Underrated."
"Drinkability - this is very good beer and I'd say it's fairly sessionable since abv is less than 8 %."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a tannish head. The smell is spicy and reminicent of pine needles. Tastes very complex and on the malty side. I taste malt and some vanilla with a bit of vegetable matter. That would be the token appearance of hops i suppose. The hops are just there to keep the sweetness of the malt in check I presume. The mouthfeel is as thick and chewy as any and goes down easily.This is definitely a great winter beer. I somehow found this stuff in a 6 pack and snapped it up right quick. I think soaked some steaks in this stuff before grilling once. What a waste that was. Save guinness for that job."
"The taste is definitely malty and smoky  though more subtle than the standard-bearer for this style, Ayinger Celebrator. There's a gentle port taste before caramel kicks in. The finish is dry and all dark malt. The carbonation is low and the mouthfeel wasn't quite as full as I thought it should be."
"Note: I knew this beer had been sitting in the back of my fridge for awhile; I didn't realize just how long until I saw the ""produced on"" date of 10/04 stamped on the lower right of the label. That extra aging (it was almost 2 years old when I drank it last night) may have affected the taste, but I honestly didn't think I sensed any real ""off"" flavors, and my general experience seems to be consistent with what other reviewers have found."
"Drinkability: this doppelbock is quite drinkable , the taste seems to be on the fruitier side of dopplebocks i've had. The abv is well hidden."
"Not the best Doppelbock I've had, but still quite good. A bit too sweet to drink more than one, but one at a time is nice."
"Overall, this is a good doppel bock, but not my favorite. It has a great flavor, but the flavor and mouthfeel are lacking just a little bit too much to rate this higher. Still, a very good beer, as I plan to try it in Munich, where I am headed tomorrow!"
"Pours a darker copper color with off white head. Aroma is malts and bread like aroma, hops don't stand out. Taste is almost all malt, vague hop bitterness and some noticeable alcohol. Medium mouthfeel. I really enjoy this one and its difficult not to rate this highly since this is the originator of the style. For the ABV this is a very easy beer to drink."
"-mattt (damn the 250 minimum characters, I have nothing left to say)."
"Very drinkable, I would especially like this as an after dinner (desert) beer (or three)."
"This beer is full bodied enough t be a meal. Forget that meal-replacement shake, just drink one of these. You will feel much better afterwards. Try this one."
"Appearance was a deep ruby that was clear when held up to the light. Smell was a good carmel malt with plenty of sweetness, as well as some toffee smells. Taste was similar, but noticable alchohol. The tastes seemed to be fighting one another and not blending well with one another. Mouthfeel was much lighter than Celebrator. Drinkability was not great due to flavors."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle, served in a Pilsener glass."
"D - I love a good tasty doppelbock and this fits the bill. Sweet, tangy malty beer. Better for the fall days."
"An average beer; really a bit of a letdown."
"Drinkability: I found this beer almost too sweet to enjoy more than at a time. That, coupled with 7.50% ABV would certainly limit the number of these bad-boys you would want to toss back."
"Notes- all in all another soild offering from paulaner"
"I've had this one cellared for a little bit now but the born on date makes this one year old. Pours absolutely gorgeous head and lacing. Just a bit of bubbles in this burnt orange brew. Alcohol seems mellowed a bit, but this one could wait another 6-12 months for a real nice treat.Malty and chewy, with a bit of hops in the finish"
"D - Not bad. Easy drinker."
"A medium bitterness rounding it off, with perhaps a late touch of a German noble hop bringing up the rear."
"This would be a very drinkable beer - but deceptively strong."
"¡Salud!"
"Pours a dark brown colour with minimal head that soon dissipates to thin lace. The smell is very heady, a mixture of caramel, light coffee notes and some alcohol hiding in the background. The taste is quite different from normal dark beers, rather sweet with a rich caramel sugar character that is not quite balaced out by the hops which finally leaves with a slight alcohol finish. This is a rather potent beer and the higher alcohol limits drinkability. Overall a rather interesting beer, in moderation."
"Overall a very good brew. Not as good as Celebrator as far as doppelbocks go, but still very good."
"Excellent Doppelbock, and definitely one I will be revisiting in the near future."
"On a personal note, this beer is great to mark the end of those dreadfully tiring days. It seems to have this taste of antiquity to it, which is unlike the beers of our time."
"So monks used to live off this during Lent, eh? Lucky buggers."
"Poured into a pint glass. Medium foamy head that dissipates rather quickly. The color is a pale copper. The aroma is alcohol soaked dried fruit and leather. The taste is SWEET, very malty, and not much else. The taste is better as the brew warms or as the alcohol is warming me. The body is on the thinner side, but the brew coats your entire mouth a little too much. Not a bad brew and one that should be tried. I would seek out other dopplebocks to purchase."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability owing to the perfect balance of light/medium body, sweet maltiness and middle palate bitterness. Definitely a great representation of the style, with an earthiness not often found in other doppelbocks. Historically and flavorwise, a standard of the style."
"A nice beer, but I'm not impressed. Comes off more like a stronger Maibock (like Summit's at 7% abv) than a doppelbock. An amber red in color, I'd say it looks a little light. Smells like dark malts and tastes of molasses with a bit of fruit and alcohol. Definately a warming flavor. Easy drinking and would probably go well with rich and sweet foods. Similar to Optimator, but not as dark. Give me a Celebrator."
"Lots of bready, fruity flavors going on here. A tasty doppel, though there are better."
"I had looked forward to this given the relatively high ratings by most BA's. I liked the looks of this, with its deep color and thick head. However, for me the aroma and finish were much too predominantly chocolate or toffee....seemed too sweet. This beer just did not do it for me."
"Wow, this a damn good one! Very rich, firm, creamy head. One can drink a few of these without noticing his/her head hitting the floor. Nice caramel, toffee, coffee, chocolate..maybe? Smells great, goes down with some hoppy goodness. One of the best of the style and nothing offensive about this one. A terrific bronski from a terrific brewer."
"Light reddish body as you pour it into the glass. Has a smallish off-white head. Has a general malty smell. I can't pick out anything in particular. Very strong liquorice (sp?) taste. Quite sweet. A little alcohol noticeable, but it doesn't interfere with the overall flavor. The overt sweetness drops the drinkability down a bit, but this is pretty darn tasty."
"In my early twenties I had a girlfriend who was my high school sweetheart and I fully expected to marry her even though I knew that I couldn't and wouldn't just the same. One instance why in particular stands out. I had painstaking half put together an edges-only jigsaw puzzle of Monet's ""Palazzo de Mula"" on the coffee table in her little apartment's living room when we got into a minor squabble. I had been razzing her about whatever people do and she got so incensed that she smashed the puzzle off the table and my week of work went to shit. With nothing else to lose I put it to her real good and she ended up so angry that she finally stood on the couch and somehow kicked me full force in the chest. I had a little wheezy bubble of defeat and disgust in my windpipe. This is the kind of feeling I get from the old Salvator but in not so severe a manner. It's like what I imagine the aftertaste of smoking menthol cigarettes would be like but with a full body dark beer primary taste included. Kind of like what you get from Bailey's Irish Creme. I like it, it's good, but I didn't care for the little hiss of creamy citrus alcohol at the tail-end. Not from a woman or a double bock."
"Pours a dark copper color with virtually no head and no lacing, color was pretty nice though. Smell is pretty nice, strong smell of burnt caramel, molasses, and some dark fruit. Much of the same in the taste but with a pretty strong alcohol presence. Taste would be higher with less alcohol apparent. Very sweet, but a small, but seemingly correct amount of hops come through in the taste. Low carbonation, full body. A little too much alcohol warmth to have a lot of this, but it is still very tasty."
"I would love to find a fresher bottle and see how this was supposed to turn out, because it is seemingly great before time and weather get to it."
"Pour a unique reddish glow but with a fizzy, cream colored head that quickly disipates into pond scum. The color is ultra transparent. Smells extremely sweet, syrupy, and mostly malts. Kind of odd aroma...oddly sweet...do I smell corn syrup?... Taste is also ultra syrupy and sweet, with a flash of alcohol. Now I see that there is a date on the beer that says it is about a year old, but there is no detectable skunking...this beer should age well, no? Very unappetizing. Hardly drinkable at first. People like this? Hmm. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonated...nothing too notworthy...light compared to other dopplebocks. If I actually enjoyed the taste of this, it's drinkability would be fair, but the high alcohol turns me off. And the sticky caramel sweetness. I was waiting all day to get home and pop this one open. Nothing salvific here for me, sadly. Your mileage may vary."
"D: Easy to drink. Alcohol is not too strong, but the flavor and aftertaste are too sweet for me."
"The body is fairly full with a sharp carbonation. Very bold flavors coat the mouth for quite some time into the finish. This is a good beer, but not something I would drink often."
"Drinkability- this is more of a sipping beer. MK"
"Overall, a great beer from a tremendous brewery."
"All in all a solid dopplebock. My money's still on Celebrator, but I'd definitely buy this again to have some variety."
"I found it very satifiying. Recommended."
"I consider this Paulaner a ""no frills"" double-bock, meaning -- it's pretty average, but potent and nothing distracting about it. The appearance is a medium brown with a slight white head which dissipates rather quickly. Very little lacing on the glass. A good amount of carbonation. The smell is sweet & potent from the abv. The taste is also sweety, malty, with a brandy overlay. Slight touches of caramel. It's rather smooth considering the high abv, which makes the drinkability of the beer good. Overall, a nice strong beer. Has a kick, but not overpowering. Try it."
"The smell is rich and malty, with spicy coffee cake and alcohol. Lots of spice on the palate, plus caramel, enough bitterness to balance, and alcohol, the latter of which begins to assert itself more with progressive sips. Malt and spice linger in the finish. Medium-full body that displays characteristic lager ""cleanliness."" Inasmuch as Salvator is a ""mainstream"" beer, it certainly offers more than most. A solid choice when it comes to lagers."
"D - Worth a try. Not something I'd want more than two in a row of."
"Pours a deep amber with a bubbly off-white head. Head doesn't last too long and thins out to a ring. Smells isn't as in my face as I'd like. The strongest scent I find is a mix of alcohol and nutty, fruity malt. Flavor is very bready, nutty, and somewhat of dried fruit. There is some perceived noble hop flavor as well as slight bitterness. Alcohol makes itself known, but it is not too assertive. Leaves a long malty aftertaste. The mouthfeel on this one could have been a little thicker, but it leaves a pleasant sugary coating on the tongue. This is definately one of the most easy-drinking doppelbocks I've come across."
"Medium-bodied, quite rich and heavy. Carbonation is noticeably present, but a bit too weak to do much for the thick, chewy body. Finish is relatively dry. While this may be the originator of the style, I find this version not exactly up to par. The taste was not as sharp or defined as other varieties, nor as deep, and the lingering bitterness does not assist in forming a more positive opinion. Aside from the appearance, there's not much here above average in this beer."
"Not the best DB, but one you can find almost anywhere. Word has it that this brew isn't as good as it once was, but it's still better than 90% of the other beers out there. Still, if you're looking for a Doppelbock that is readily available, I'd look to Optimator or especially Celebrator/Korbinian."
" This is the week to be downing this action like a man dying of thirst in the desert so it gets a slight pump in the drinkability quotient. Definitely go check this one out if you like German beer, dark beer, or beer."
"I would like to start off by saying that I would enjoy this more had it hidden the alcohol flavor better. It poured lighter than expected from this style - an orangish amber, with moderate carbonation and a moderate head that quickly dissippated. It smell was of sharp, fruity alcohol. The taste had fruit flavors that were covered, again, but alcohol. Overall, I thought that this was overrated. Maybe I missed something. I think this is decent, but there are more delicious doppelbocks on the market."
"A very comfortable double bock. A good strong beer that can be drank casually. The brew stacks well with it's self. But the thought of having 99 bottles of this guy on your wall is scary though."
"I really enjoy this tasty brew. One of my favorite dopple bocks. It may be a tad sweet to some. However, the flavors really smooth together as it warms."
"Salvator poured a clear red amber color with a light tan head. Aroma was very malty, almost like that smell of a fresh batch of wort. Tasty was wonderfully malty and sweet, with notes of caramel and chocolate poking through. I could also detect a little bit of alcohol. This beer is quite rich and filling, the way a doppelbock is supposed to be. Recommended for anyone who loves a malt bomb."
"Overall a good doppelbock, very solid beer."
"Good stuff"
"This may have been the first ""Dopplebock", but I don't think it's the 'gold-standard'."
"A pleasure to drink and recommend...try this one, well worth it...cheers."
"a very drinkable brew. the price just makes it even better. this will become a regular in my fridge now."
"Obviously a very meticulously researched, quality crafted beer. Up there with the very best doppelbocks."
"Great price, great beer. My first try of the Doppelbock style and I'm totally satisfied. Highly recommended."
"This beer poured a a nice reddish brown/ruby color and was clear. An off-white head was created; it quickly dissipated. Many carbonation streams emanated from the bottom. Aromas of dried fruit and chocolate were noted. The taste contained hints of cherry, wine. A malty aftertaste ensued. Mouthfeel was smooth and balanced. Overall, this beer was right on the money for me. It was highly drinkable and more quaffable than some other doppelbocks I've had."
"Mouthfeel is heavy, chewy, and full, just like a dopplebock should be. Drinkablity is high...despite the 7.5%, this beer goes down like water."
"An excellent dopple bock overflowing with characer. I recently had this right after sampling another well-known beer of this style, and the Salvator won hands down. Pours a beautiful dark orange with high turbidity and good lacing. The taste was a malty, rich, and surprisingly fruity flavor with a full mouthfeel. Conveys just the right amount of alcohol aroma for a good double. Very enjoyable to drink."
"I would drink this beer very often if I wasn't so commited to trying new things, out of the dopplebocks I've sampled so far this was one of my favorites."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Hides the alcohol nicely."
"For my 900th review I sampled one of my favorites from my Munich days. I made Salvator's reacquaintance at the Beer Market in Moscow. My old friend came out clear pale copper under a one finger off white head that lingered well and left some decent lacing. The brew came out too cold, but that just allowed me to feel the nose bloom as it warmed. Starting from nothing, first some grain came through, then the sweet caramel and finally some floral hops. Lovely. The mouth was very prickly, light and surprisingly clean - I had remembered more viscosity. The taste was much like the nose, starting off as little more than a dunkles with its sweet caramel, but slowly blossoming into something stronger, with more of an espresso bite. By the end, the brew was everything I had remembered, both sweet and bitter, with a bit of fruit behind. Very nice indeed."
"Hello, headache. A bad bottle is possible here, but I'm not looking forward to trying this again."
"D: I was unable to finish this beer. Based on the other reviews, this must have been a bad batch or bottle. I'll definitely be trying it again in another location."
"Overall-A good example of the style."
"This is pretty good, but I wouldn't go out of my way for another. The combination of the spicy character and the bread-like flavor is starting to feel a little strange. They're not playing off each other in a particularly appealing way for my taste buds."
"This dopplebock has beautiful orange amber color. The smell was rich and malty with an apple cider undercurrent. You start to taste dried fruit, then a big complex malty body, and an aftertaste that changes with each swallow. it had a nice full mouthfeel, and a good drinkability. i will definitely pick this up again."
"Good for the style. Kinda like eating a pastry."
"BTW - Trader Joe's is now stocking an expanded craft beer selection. I didn't buy any, because I've had bad wine experiences there. I will have to investigate further at a later time."
"This is a pretty nice doppelbock. I'd love to try it on draft."
"-UF"
"Poured a dark red with a slight head and little lacing. Smell is potent, Smells somewhat like a Saison, interestingly enough. Taste is bold, evidence of herbal undertones, reminds me a lot of a Saison ale. Mouthfeel is a little heavy but unoffensive. This beer has a high ABV that is definitely evident. A good winter brew to keep you warm on those cold nights."
"Pours a deep amber, with a solid though shortlived head. Smells wonderful: caramel, toasted malts, dark fruits, and brown sugar. MMM, tastes even better. Very well balanced, bready and sweet, yet not overly sticky, rounded out with a certain crispness. Malt-licious! Great mouthfeel, and very drinkable. One of the best dobble bocks out there."
"Body is between medium and large with a very mushy, creamy mouthfeel and slippery smooth texture. Would not want more than one bottle in a sitting due to the sweetness."
"Verdict- This beer is quite a confection. It's sweet, but never cloying."
"D - It just tastes so damned good... gone before I knew it."
"had this one on tap and i tried it. it was somewhat dark but almost amberish, but for the most part the appearance and smell seemed to indicate another great german dopplebock. however i was disappointed. i could tell it was a good quality beer and it was decent in most ways, but for one thing. its flavors didnt seem to mix well, one ingredient was especially prominent(i couldnt tell what it was) and it kind of ruined it for me. didnt taste as rich or complex as some other dopplebocks, certainly not as balanced, with a noticeable unpleasant aftertaste. this was the first german beer i had that i found difficult to finish. my friend tried a sip and in disgust compared it to dogfood."
"D- This beer has great depth in flavor but is a very clean and balanced lager. A great beer and a great doppelbock."
"Not as drinkable as Celebrator or Optimator. I was a bit dissappointed. I've been waiting all day to get home from work to try this, but it's not as good as I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good beer, but I think I prefer Optimator (for similar price, or Celebrator, if I splurge."
"Pours a remarkably clear amber color with a frothy tan head that retains alright. The aroma is intensely malty, with big toasted bread, caramel and dark fruit (fig, plum,and grape), as well as some noble hops and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is also quite malty with big caramel and toasted bread flavors upfront, as well as dark ripened fruit (fig, plum, grape), hallertau hops and some ethanol. The mouthfeel is a chewy medium with light carbonation and drinkability is excellent for a dopplebock. Quite enjoyed this dopplebock, more drinkable than most."
"While not as complex and interesting as the Celebrator, a fine beer that I look forward to drinking again soon."
" I'd call this a medium bodied, well balanced double bock. Nothing overpowering with a nice hoppy finish. Quite drinkable."
"Poured a lovely dark brown-orange color with an off-white colored head that dissipated in less than a minute, but left a small, 1 cm head throughout the session. Aromas of roasted malt, spiced candy, caramel, and dates were detectable. The taste followed the aromas with an explosion of sweetness. The texture was thick and bready, making it exceedingly rich and smooth. Delicate flavors danced across my tongue and generated varying levels of sweetness, coating my entire mouth easily. Excellent drinkability since the ABV is well hidden and the beer is so flavorful and smooth."
"Poured a warm, clean copper color into a pint glass, thin head fell quickly to thin off white lacing. Smells of malt and caramel with hints of cinnamon and spice. Tastes like toffee and caramel, close to a winter warmer, less spice than that in the aroma. Mouthfeel slick and viscous, feels thicker than it appears. Excellent level of carbonation, making it very drinkable even with the seven and a half percent abv present. Might seek out again once I know more of the style, this is my first true doppelbock."
"Dcould easily have a few more, although the higher alcohol content would kick in. I am not very familiar with Doppelbocks, but enjoyed this one very much."
"Not close to my favorite, but tends to be hit & miss in Colorado, some bottles seem to hold up better than others. This beer didn't really wow me much more in Germany than now. A great beer to intoduce someone to dopplebocks though. never strays too far away from very goodness/greatness"
"Pours a reddish amber color with a medium sized head that doesn't last long and fizzes away. Smells of breads and a sweetness that reminds me of grapes. This seems to fit the typical dopple bocks style. Taste is smooth with a very sweet characteristic. Bready tastes with an almost sour undertone. Very nice blend of malts in this ancient brew. A great beer for the style that leaves a nice maltiness in the mouth. Very drinkable."
"Chewy mouthfeel with a full body. Just the perfect amount of carbonation. A nice warming sensation to this beer. It doesnt taste much like a 7% plus. Very drinkable."
"As usual, freshest is bestest!"
"Overall, I enjoyed the beer and could drink several in a sitting without ever growing weary of the taste."
"Poured into a Celebrator glass this was slightly more transparent than expected with rich orangish, amber, to red hues and a solid whitish head that receded leaving a ring and modest residue on top. The active carbonation combined with the glasswear makes this look like a commercial, gorgeous. nose is of course is almost completely comprised of malt, malt and more malt. Molasses and oats are most apparent. Taste is completely spot on, all I could ask for from the style. Super sweet, reminds me of drinking maple syrup with the sweetness and thick mouthfeel. The only real drawback is that drinkability is low because of the extreme sweetness and filling nature. Quickly becoming a favorite style of mine this is the best I've tried so far...I prefer this to Celebrator...until i drink another Celebrator that is."
"Drinkability: This was a very drinkable beer. There was just the right amount of carbonation present ot help this beer slide down."
"This beer really lives up to its' designation. There is a LOT of malt in this brew, and you can almost taste the molasas like consistancy that comes with it. Smell is overwhelmingly of dark extract with nothing else coming through. Even with the ferocity of the extract this still manages to go down smooth and balanced. The mouthfeel retains the smoothness, and makes the dinkablility very high. A great beer."
"Those who are into hoppy or even balanced brews most likely will not like this beer; but if you just want a huge sweet dessert beer, perhaps to eat with creme brulee or cheesecake, this is your doublebock."
"As the temperature of the beer increases the flavors strengthen and the beer becomes even more smooth and dry. Overall this Double Bock is very nice beer. C'mon the bottle says they've been doing it same way for over 370 years, that's gotta count for something!"
"D - This is not my favorite style, nor my favorite beer. however, for what it is it leaves you going back sip after sip. Definitely one I can enjoy on occasion, when in the mood."
"If you like to chew on chocolate coated espresso beans, this is a good night cap for you. A wonderful German treat."
"This is a great double bock. My favorite of the style. A great beer to have in the winter months."
"500 ml bottle, bought in Bier Spezi Hamburg. Reddish amber colour, large orange to light tan head. Surprisingly alcoholic aroma, elements of molasses, caramel and syrup, hints of dried dark fruits, port wine and oak. Flavour is also rather alcoholic, malty sweet (a little too sweet for me) with plenty of caramel and molasses, a herbal spiciness and moderate hops in the finish. Not nearly as good as the much darker Weltenburger Kloster Asam Bock, but still a very powerful beer in any way. Definitely a ""winter warmer""."
"Different than most dopplebocks I've had, but what does that say when this is a very old recipe."
"Taste; malts, honey, apples, caramel, followed by little hoppy bitterness. I can't really taste any aolcohol. It goes down really easy at first, but after a while it almost becomes to sweet for me. Mouthfeel is medium/full with just enough carbonation."
"Anyway, a good doppelbock, but not, in my opinion, in the same league as Ayinger Celebrator (which I still have 3 more bottles of and will review later! Woo!)"
"--Joey"
"This beer is solid, and one that I've seen around much more often than some other quality, imported doppelbocks. A great brew, and I found it fitting on an incresingly cold autumn day. I'll pick it up again."
"a generous alcohol content beer; hard and sweet taste; smell little singed, malted, little phenolic, watered down palate; try with german and american food; serve in a goblet glass; this is a beer not common in my country, try this by a friend of mine from zaragoza spain; 80% recommended."
"Drinkability: Seems to be a sipper. The taste made me think I could slam it, the oily mouthfeel is telling me not too."
"as it is a seasonal beer for spring I'll try another one in 6 months (and let you know) ...."
"i love this stuff too much. i'll take this over any other dopple, and over almost any other brew. now that the temperature has cooled, i can turn to this as my comfort beer."
"Cheers!"
"Sehr gutes dopplebock brauen!!!"
"This bottle poured an amber brew with a thin head. It's smell was full of sweet malt. The sweet taste was cloying, with no other taste to balance. I would find it hard to drink two of these. This was my first Doppelbock, and I gather that sweet malt goes with the style. This is probably a beer that needs some food to balance the sweetness."
"Pours a pretty garnet red with a nice finger and a half tan, creamy head. Smells and tastes a little more like I would expect from a dopplebock than the Tucher Bajuvator I had last night. Some grainy malts, caramel malts, fruity notes and an alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is crisp but not harsh. Body is medium, quite drinkable for 7.5% as well. A nice beer here."
"Opinion: I really like this beer, and it is one that I drink often. I personally prefer the darker and richer DoppelBocks, but this beer is a hallmark of the style...so I just have to enjoy one frequently just for it's place in history. A fine brew, and I highly recommend it!"
"What a great aroma. Salvator features a big malt and light hop aromas. It pours a crystal clear garnet red with a big long lasting creamy head. My tounge was coated with big caramel malt flavor with some roast and hop bitterness. Salvator is very full bodied with pleasant carbonation. Quite mouth-filling. Outstanding."
"Not sure, but it might be dated 11/04. Pours a dark brown in color with some nice carbonation and head. There's a nice ring of lacing through out. Nice scents of sweet malt, caramel/toffee. There's a very nice sweet taste and a medium body to this brew. This is a highly recommended brew which is very drinkable IMHO. I really enjoyed this brew."
"overall: i've heard many say that salvator is the best dopelbock around for the money. maybe so, but in my opinion, i'd rather pay the extra for celebrator. just an average brew in my opinion."
"It's a drinkable beer for me but for someone who doesn't drink a lot you might not want to make it your session beer."
"<Update> ok, just had the Celebrator last night (review forthcoming), and must say it's not the style of this I did not care for, it was this beer in particular, as I loved the Celebrator."
"Pours a dark amber/ copper color, with a white lacy head. Smell is dark carmel malt. Taste is of complex malt, finished of with some light hop sweetness. Goes down smooth for such a dark beer. Definitly a quality beer, one I will be sure to enjoy again."
"This is an outstanding beer. Always on tap at the local german bar. A dark brown beer with a small head that leaves some lacing. The aroma is of dark roasted malt caramelized through a long hard boil leaving trails of complexity and enjoyment, finished off by a nice noble hop spice that gives a little tartness to all the sweetness. Very drinkable and when the serve them in 1 liter steins the room can get fuzzy fast."
"Drinkability is very good for a beer this strong; watch out."
"The beer's strong aftertaste doesn't last."
"Edit: Just re-sampled this brew August 13 '05 and enjoyed it more as I suspect my palate is expanding a bit. Noticed more of the smoke/burnt smell and taste and enjoyed it."
"Overall - another exceptional beer from Paulaner.... one not to be missed..."
"A good beer that I found difficult to enjoy on a hot summer evening...best left to the colder months."
"This is a great traditional doppel bock. What I compare all other doppel bocks to. Looks solid brown with ruby and golden highlights. Has medium dense head that may fade, but should lace well. Smells carmelly and malty. Toasty and fruity of sweet dark fruits like figs, dates, and a bit nutty. Low buttery that gives body. Molassas and brown sugar that is offset by alcoholic heat and hop balance. Firm medium body that is unwavering and just under creamy. Finishes crisp and sweet. Abrupt bittering gives way to sweetness that lingers. Alcohoic throughout. A well balanced and matured beer. Always a treat."
"A very nice doppelbock, though it doesn't hold a candle to the Andechs doppel in my mind."
"Lip-licking goodness..."
"Final Thought: This is a great beer to have before you go to bed, not extremely heavy like a Weizen, but it clearly gets the job done."
"On a second note this is my very first review on BA so I hope I covered all the basics."
"D: Good beer. Much better than the other doppel bock I reviewed."
"I was pleasantly suprised by this beer. Very nice. Poured out to a gold / auburn color with a nice white faomy head. No lace noted. Aromas of caramel and fruits were present, and a touch malty. Flavor was quite smooth, with overtones of roasted sugar, malt and fermented grapes or plumbs. Also had a brandy like aftertaste. Nice mouthfeel, but was slightly weak. Aftertaste and finish were sweet, with a slight bite. Not bad. If you can find this brew, I would recommend giving it a try."
"This is definitely a sipping beer. You would need to stretch it out over a period of time, preferably matched with some food. Also I don't think I'd want more than one in a night. Salvator would definitely do better with less alcoholic bite and without making my mouth feel coated in syrup."
"Paulaner never fails me so I picked this up with high expectations. Tastes very sweet and feels syrupy in the mouth. High alcohol content goes unnoticed in the taste, but extremely fruity flavor makes this one too much like a slurpy for me. A good beer but I doubt I'll buy it again."
"wow. dopplebocks are where IT is at. color is reddish-copper, like an old indian-head penny your grandpa saved for ya. very creamy 1 finger head that doesn't give up too easily if let set for a while, if you can wait. smell is malty, malty, malty. you can catch the scent of alcohol in the nose as well. hop bittering is not absent but somewhat under-stated. too sweet and too thick for me. this is definetely a one or two in a night kind of beer, as it is a little sweet and heavy, but it is a truly tasty and interesting adventure in malt imbibement."
"D&N: Perhaps not as complex as a Celebrator dopplebock. The malts, while sweet and tasy, could have done with a little more depth. Still, a very tasty beer and very drinkable. Not a beer for a dedicated hop head, this beer is right in line for someone who likes a rich malty beer. Recommended."
"great beer that i'm still developing a taste for."
"Poured a tannish thin bubbly head about half a finger high that dissipates fairly quickly. There is no lace apparent so far. The aroma is fairly strong and noticeable with hints of fruit, grapes and a slight alcohol smell. The taste is similar, kind of grapey and alcoholic. The carbonation is high giving a lasting aftertaste that accompanies the slight maltiness and coffee flavors on the palate."
"Drinkability- One of the better doppelbocks. More flavor than I thought this one would have. Not quite the thickness of a primo doppel, but at the very least, it's a pretty good standby to most."
"Full bodied, strong but smooth. Serious beer!"
"Just had this one again, and I find it to be a bit more drinkable. I can't put this one down! Also, I feel the smell now is more than good, it is a beautiful smelling beer. Delicious as always, but still very complex. Such a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The sweet malts still blow me away in this one. A delicious doppelbock and one that is surprisingly more drinkable than I remembered. Awesome."
"Pours a nice brownish-red color that didn't have much of a head on it, but had some carbonated bubbles. It has a very nice malty caramel smell to it. Has a strong malty coffee like taste that is actually very good. You can really feel the strong alcohol presence to it. Overall this is an excellent brew that you can drink in moderation. This is one Doppelbock that everyone should try."
"Overall, this is a damned good beer and one I plan on enjoying again."
"Great for the worlds original Doppel Bock, I'm impressed."
"Drinkability: Very good in moderation. Not a high volume consumption beer, but that is fine. I will probably have this again, but not until late fall/winter. I don't think I would enjoy this as much in the summer heat."
"This was my first exposure to the wonderful world of dopplebocks. Since then, I've had many, and I'll still pick Korbinian or Celebrator over this. Still, it's a tried and true classic and holds fond memories as one of the first beers I've had which led me down the wonderful halls of beerdom."
"One of my all time favorites. Can't believe it's taken me so long to review it."
"I remember this beer from my early days of burgeoning beer enlightenment. Clear, ruby-brown body with a small, tight, khaki head. Nose of rich, sweet malts, caramel, stewed fruit, jam, and a light, spicy, vegetal hop presence. Taste is sweet caramelly cookie malt with notes of fruit and brandy. Mildly spicy, noble hop finish. Lasting bitterness with a sweetbread edge. Full-bodied, thick (not quite liquid bread though). A very good DB, but I don't know if I would fast on this alone (throw in some Celebrator, Bayern, and Autumnal Fire and then maybe...)."
"Drinkability is very good on this easy drinking Doppel. Alcohol is masked very well and this one goes down very well."
"This is one of my favourite Doppelbock because it opens up with increasing complexity with every sip. Easier drinking than Celebrator it shows its versatility with meat and game. Lots of sweetness is eased off if the bottle is cellared for six months to a year."
"The mouthfeel is smooth, rich and creamy. Very pleasant to sip and savor. Probably wouldn't want to drink too many of these in one sitting."
"Another good candidate beer that would do good with a little proper aging I feel."
"A rich, creamy body that flows over the palate nicely. Very full and satisfying. This is quite a nice doppelbock and one I'll be having again in the future. A nice example of the style."
"Salvator is a different sort of doppelbock. For all I know, though, it might be the standard bearer for the style. It was good and the bottle was empty almost before I knew it, but the word 'great' never even crossed my mind."
"This outstanding beer pours a golden brown from the bottle with a fluffy head that quickly dissipated. Smells of sweet caramel, malt and raisins. Taste is excellent, big bold malt flavor, as expected, with a delightfully smooth finish. That 7.5% ABV sneaks up on you! The golden standard against which most doppelbocks are measured"
"Yeah, what everyone else said  (except for 2 reviewers). Finally got to quaff the standard among d-bocks. Exceptional brew, beautiful amber brown pour with tan head, very lacy. Malty, sweet, with a hop balance and finish. Nice alcohol presence to counter the sweetness (wifey said it tasted like whisky  HEH !!) Gimme a couple more"
"12 oz. bottle. The original dopplebock. Slight hazy bronze color. Thick tan foamy head. Good retention. Big sweet caramel malt aroma. Notes of molasses and dark bread. Toasty almost roasty aroma. Big malt flavor, sticky and sweet. Sweet dark bread flavor. Toasty caramel flavor. Very little hop bitterness. Medium body approaches full, moderate carbonation. Thick and approaching syrup like. Very satisfying and filling. This is a classic to measure against."
"Orange-dark copper body with slight carbonation. Good off-white head. Smells sweet, a bit bread dough like, and a hint of fruit. As for tatse i can detect a bit of the grain up front, and an overall sweet and slightly fruity taste with a minor smokey finish. Mild alcohol in the middle, excellent ballance. I like the complexity, but on the other hand this beer is not too complex because i can still pick all of the flavors apart. Mild overall hops presence. Mouthfeel is watery at first, refreshing, but then leaves an oily coating as it evaporates in the mouth. Awesome ballance hides the alcohol very well and makes this highly drinkable."
"Sure I've had better, but this is still a hell of a dopplebock."
"An amber colored brew with a one finger head that dissipates rapidly. The aroma is outstanding: grassy like a fresh mowed hayfield, becoming sweeter as it warms and alcoholic when warm and agitated. Tastes of rich malts and the same grassiness as the nose, herbal and floral. Much more malt dominant as it warms, and alcoholic when rolled around on the tongue. Great session beer; medium bodied and a little carbonation, just right ABV. My favorite doppelbock."
"Comments - Doppelbock is just not my style of choice. By my estimation this is a very good beer, but I just can't get really excited about it."
"I've had this beer a few times in the past, and just never put pen to paper. Pours a deep copper/light red color. Good head retention and sticky lace. The head clumps as you drink it. Smells carmelly and sweet. Taste is carmelly, munich malt up front. Spicy herbal hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and lucious. I could down these all night if it wasn't 7.5%."
"This beer is a beautiful medium dark amber with a decent-sized, off-white, mostly diminishing, frothy head and only a little lacing early. The aroma is pungent and sweet. Caramel maltiness is strong followed by bready, smokey and fruity scents. The taste is like I like them: big and malty. Theres a wonderful candied fruitiness of raspberry and plum, and a pleasant little hop bitterness. The finish is long-lasting and sweet with bit of alcohol, kind of like a tawny port. The mouthfeel is a little oily and syrupy but still thinner and lighter in body than I thought it would be. I really enjoyed this beer and think that drinkability is high, though most would probably consider this to mealy and strong. But I would recommend trying this one."
"Drinkability  This is a raw, edgy Doppelbock which is just the way that I like em. It is true to the style and exceptionally creamy in the mouth."
"I was somewhat impressed by this Paulaner offering. 500ml bottle pours a golden-brown with ruby tints that sports a healthy head that lingers for a while. A very roasty aroma speaks of caramel, raisins, plums, and toasted sourdough bread. Taste has a little more hops than your average bock, if you ask me, which I enjoy. Balances out the malts. Again the caramel, raisins, mild hints of grapefruit. A bit of bite in the mouthfeel, and just right on the carbonation. Could use a bit more ""pepperyness"" for my taste. Not my favorite style, but for the style, I think it's a great, widely available beer. Pretty drinkable, also, a 500ml bottle will warm you up nicely."
"500 mL bottle with something that looks like a freshness date or a batch number on the front label. Pours into the chalice a deep reddish-brown with a 1 finger head that reduces to almost nothing and leaves little lacing. Scents are bubblegum, diacetyl, golden raisins, and caramel. Tastes are alcohol, diacetyl, sweet malts, and bitterness that is there but overshadowed by the other flavors. Tastes good but almost too sweet and the alcohol is very prevalent, which both lower the taste score. Beer is thick and smooth, leaving a warming sensation as it goes down. Good but I couldn't drink more than a bottle of this at a time. Perhaps cellaring a bottle for a few months might help."
"I liked this beer but it didn't strike me as one that I'd buy all the time or keep around the house. I do like it enough that I'll get one in town and try it again. Who knows, could be an old bottle that got too many temperature changes."
"It has been a long time since I had a Salvator and after having one this weekend I can honestly say I have no clue why! This brew pours to a clear dark amber color with a think off white head (Tan) head that breaks down relatively slowly, very nice looking! It left a nice amount of lacing through out the entire brew! The aroma is very pleasant with a sweetness from the malt which is probably leading to the notice of caramel or toffee smell that is excellent. The taste is very much dominated by the malt giving it a sweet flavor that gives way to a keen spiciness/bitterness ending with slight alcohol flavor. This is a nice brew and must thank the friend who left here the previous weekend!"
"Pours a deep, clear, cherry-copper with a formidable beige-red head. Moderate lacing. Smells nicely sugary with a big amount of raisin to the nose. Has all the wonderful depth of flavor one would expect from a big malty beast like this. Brown sugar, plum, fig, raisin..it's all there. Finishes with a syrupy slickness that I just love. It's a keeper."
"Never had fried turkey? Sad."
"I haven't had that many doppelbocks, but this has vaulted towards the top of the list--and why shouldn't it? It's the granddaddy of them all..."
"Pours a dark coppery red with a tan head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma of toffee with a twinge of alcohol, with a bit of hops as it warmed. Some cherry and winey as well. Taste was an amazing roasted malt with a hoppy bitterness entering quickly. Very malty on the finish as well, and quite rich and smooth. The alcohol is rather well hidden, but not completely hidden. This is good, but certainly not the best I've had. Still, easy to find and easy drinking... Cheers!"
"Salvator Doppelbock is greater than the sum of its parts. It's quite easy to drink several in a sitting, but the boomerang effect might hurt."
"This is the classic doppel bock and a must for someone trying to figure out what these bocks taste like, but is does not push the envleope enough for me. I prefer bigger beers in aroma, taste and alcohol."
"Yummy!"
"Paulaner and Erdinger have always been two of my favourite, larger breweries in Germany. Sniffing from the bottle after popping the cap I get a very peculiar leathery, seasoning salt smell. A cream-coloured, almost light red head forms, about 4 cm, leaving healthy thick patches of lace. The beer is almost red, but more of a dark orange, and extremely clear. The head narrows to a thin, but fine covering. The aroma is spicy, and extremely salty. I get massive whiffs of seasoning-salt here. Leathery, chemical-like, extremely unique. I smell tomato-juice, and celery salt. Some of the smells are hard to define. I do get some red-malt aroma, some butterscotch, and very pungent acidity. The taste is not half as full or mysterious as the aroma might suggest: instead of much spiciness, I get more of the leathery malt, and some astringent sour properties, and some basic caramel malt in the finish. Some taste akin to barbeque sauce, or tomato juice. Sweet malt, more salinity, butter, metallic notes, sour cheese. The mouthfeel is actually quite oily and dry, but very full. This was not my favourite beer when I first tried it a couple of years ago, but it has grown on me, especially after trying many different barleywines and old ales. I would still not drink more than two of these in a night, equally out of respect for its taste and its strong gravity."
"A solid version of the style; pretty much the standard for doppelbocks. Great aromas, good flavors, but not as smooth as I would have liked."
"Overall an average beer but nothing impressive."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This is one badass Doppelbock. Many others are too thick and sweet for me but this one strikes a perfect balance. The apperance was great with a nice reddish brown color and great head. The smell was a bit subtle but I could detect some nice cinnamon and sweet fruit scents. The taste and mouthfeel were out of this world. Sweet malts dominate most of the flavor profile but not in a way that makes it undrinkable, and there is a great dry/hoppy character in the finnish that perfectly balances out the maltiness of the front end. A extremley drinkable Doppel goes along side the Celebrator as my favorite beers of the style."
"I recall Paulaner being one of the few foreign beers sold in Chile, especially in the South, from their German heritage. But it's widely known and drunk down there."
"Poured in a goblet, Paulaner Salvator appears an amber/coppery colour. Nice to look at. Unfortunately, the head is a pathetic film that disipates to nothing. Lace is barely their. Just some strips of bubbles. Smells of caramel, malts, some fruit and earth. Taste starts out sweet. Caramel, sweet malts, and dark fruits. Middle is kind of earthy. Like dirt, but in a good way. Aftertaste is bittersweet. As it warms, it becomes much more earthy and hoppy. Nice sharp and bitter aftertase, and the sweetness becomes more mellow. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and light. Little, if any, of a carbonated mouthfeel. Drinkability is good. Beer I can drink again. Maybe not alot in one sitting, but that's what makes it a good beer. It's too complex to be quaffed."
"Taste was full of flavor. Big carmel taste upfront with a fruity taste after. Cherry hard candy like flavors as well. A hint of alcohol in the aftertaste along with a nice bitterness."
"Big off white head that goes away fast. Smell is big and malty. Taste is really sweet with a large carmel base. This feels extreamly thick in the mouth, wouldn't guess that by looking at it. The sweetness makes finishing the bottle a chore. I usually enjoy heavy beers, but there is something odd about this."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a dark reddish-brown color with two fingers of head. There is a decent amount of lacing. The smell is rich and malty. Some toasted malt, bready aromas with caramel and a hint of alcohol. The taste is also malty, with more caramel sweetness. Some fruity flavors present as well, such as banana and cherry. A bit of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is very strong, yet smooth. The drinkability is pretty good for a 7.5% brew. A good example of the doppelbock style."
"Solid, juicy malt aroma smells so damn good. Orange colored beer towards the bottom of the weizen glass but more of a ruby/mahoganny at the top, pretty cool effect if you ask me. Fine bubbled, dark cream colored head fades slowly to a film leaving strings of lace along the way. Malt from the aroma is very weak in the flavor and quickly overpowered by a mildly bitter and slightly alcoholic taste. Finish is bordering on dry, not the juicy malt bomb I was expecting. Didn't know much about the beer beforehand, but upon pouring it looked good, smelled great. The taste was dissapointing and it turned into a dissapointment."
"Very good mouthfeel, lightly carbonated and a bit creamy make an excellent combination. This beer is not hard to drink at all."
" This brew smells way better than it tastes."
"The mouthfeel is full and definitely pleasing. Drinkability is great for its strength."
"Drinkability is just fine."
"The full but not overdone carbonation of the beer gives it a medium body and a crisp feel in the mouth."
"A compact, golden-brown head of tiny bubbles 1"" deep tops off this pour and does a pretty good job of sticking around. Beer is chestnut in color with orangish highlights, fairly translucent, and medium in viscosity. Sweet smells of toffee, buttered wheat dough, and gingerbread spices. Suggestions of maple syrup carry over into the flavor, although the main focus is still on toffee and butter. Dense flavors of allspice and cinnamon prevent the mellow, rich sweetness from ever becoming cloying. Walnut-skin dryness at the roof of the mouth leads into an aftertaste that recalls caraway seeds and woodsy hops. This is happily bitterer than I had expected. No tangible carbonation to a mouthfeel that is on the light side of medium in body and drier than the aroma would suggest. Drinkable, but the alcohol level makes this relaxing enough to enjoy one at a time--which is probably the point. No complaints."
"Has a dark clean amber body with a creamy off white head. The aroma is an inviting malt sweetness with some tabacco in the background. The taste has a yummy toffee malt sweetness at the start and a dry licorice finish. There is something in the mouthfeel and taste that make you want to keep taking mouthfull after mouthfull."
"Maybe I'm just relishing the style. The defunct microbrewer I worked for in Ohio made a delicious Dopplebock for the bar trade in Dayton. Brewmaster Steve Betts- where are you?"
"Bottom line- though toned down this is still a very solid and well made doppelbock, quite enjoyable actually, but a bit light for the style."
"12"
"It's very easy drinking and smooth, wonderfully made."
"Wow! POured with a rich toffee brown colour, and a tight fluffy white head. Aromas of rich dark malt, mollasses, alcohol, and toffee. Tasted of a toffee sweetness, a huge malt backbone, evident alcohol, and a dry longlasting finish, with slight hints of licquorice. The epitomy of the Doppel Bock style."
"Cascading into my Paulaner Weissbier glass, Salvator stretches his arms and presents a lovely amount of carbonation, as well as a distinctive cream-colored head. Lovely, copper-y sunset color to the brew. Sweet malt BACKBONE, fruity esters, minimal, although meaningful german hop presence. Almost champagne like in its' effervescence. Refreshing, as well as satisfying. Decieving as can be for a 7.5 ABV ale. My absolute favorite, and a steal at 2.59 for 16.9oz."
"Salvator pours a reddish amber colour without too much head that recedes quickly without much lacing. The smell is stong and malty and smells like caramel - sweet and rich. The taste also has strong hints of caramel and quite sweet and malty. This beer really tastes great - like a rich dessert you get after a nice meal. The mouthfeel is very smooth, i dont detect any hop bitterness and the style of beer does not make for the greatest drinkability. I can't see myself using this as a session beer. Only a few at a time - really want to savor them. With Thanksgiving just around the corner this is going to be a great beer for cool fall days."
"Truly a classic, this is one of my favorite beers, espcially when fall rolls around. A week or two may pass without me buying one, but it's a rare month when I don't at least have a couple. On cold late-fall nights, by the gas fireplace with one of the cats in my glass, I love to have a full liter glass of Salvator."
"Nice red, amber color and a sudsy beige head. Sweet, malty aroma with odd hints of citrus. Taste is sweet, malty, and faintly acetic. Decent but definitely a rung or two below the likes of Spaten Optimator, Weltenburger, and Celebrator on the doppelbock ladder."
"Pours a nice clear amber / copper with a thick light cream head. Slight hints of fruit and caramel to the nose but the smell of alchohol is the most predominant. A fairly complex and flavorful mix that becomes sweeter and smokier as it warms. Easy to kick back a few pints, and with a abv of 7.5 you wont need to drink to many more."
"Mouthfeel is medium, smooth and well-rounded, finishes clean. It's sweetness limits its drinkability more than anything else, but not by much."
"This is the beer that opened my tastebuds to a whole new world of beer and started my beer quest. I drank it on tap at the brewery in Munich and fell in love with it. Now that I have tasted a lot of other beers, I'll need to return to the brewery and re-live the experience with a much more well-travelled palate."
"Pours a dark brown with a ruby highlight. Not much of a head. but then I made the mistake of pouring it in a seasoned glass. Smell is malty malty malty. Caramel, dark bread with a bit of sweetness. Well a bit more than a touch. Not really hops around to dry it out, but that isnt what this bier is for. Its rich and tasty..Carbonation is low. Given the ABV you cant have too many of these.. However its a good brew. Pair it with Roast Duck and Red Cabbage or Sauerbraten and Spaetzle. Its tasty and unnoticed!"
"Poured very clear and very red in colour with almost no head at all. Decent lacing, however. The smell is absolutely fantastic. Very sweet, bready, and a little bit of a raisin like aroma, as well. The taste, too, is quite sweet. Not too sweet. Just more so than I had expected. The texture is fairly smooth and easy to drink, although there is quite a bit more carbonation in this than I would have thought there to be. Not my style, but not bad either. Paulaner does a good job on keeping the 7.5%abv on a leash on this stuff. It's really not that noticeable, taste-wise anyway. Something else I'd like to add. There is an interesting, quite tasty maple syrup like after-taste that shows up about 2 seconds after you take a sip. Nice."
"300 mL brown bottle with freshness date clearly marked on the label."
"All and all this was a quite enjoyable and drinkable beer. I think it would go great with fish and chicken, or hell just drink it to talk about it."
"First want to think aracauna with his help with my Atlanta trip where I aquired my Salvator. Haven't had this in years but enjoyed it while in CO pre Ba days a lot. Pours a clear amber with brownish tints head falls to a thin cap of foam, no lace to speak of. Aroma is malt fruit apples mainly hints of caramel spice. Taste is mallllty and complex big on malt, molassas, caramel with fruits flavors present along with a nice dose of hops. This is a good Doppelbock not as thick as some but a good medium bodied brew that is really drinkable. This is a good brew not as great as I thought it was from memory, but still a great beer."
"A beautiful amber beer that smells of sweet malts and lots of them. There is little head and no lacing to speak of, but this seems to be the norm for this style. It's body is a bit thin and the malt is a bit subdued for a Doppel Bock, but it only makes the beer that much easier to enjoy. The Germans know how to brew beer... well their way, and that is not a bad thing at all."
"Drinkability: Very! A kick ass brew and a style that I'm definitely going to have to do more ""research"" on (wink, wink). Check this beer out. It's a good one."
"Orange amber aroma with a thin fizzy head that was gone before I was able to put the empty bottle in the trash. Aroma is very malty with a wood roasted grain tone that is a bit striking. There were also notes of orangey hops. The taste is robustly sweet, with a smoky peaty background supplemented by vanilla, apples, and oak. The hops are floral and peppery, but are definitely playing second fiddle here. The body feels a lot thicker in the mouth than the appearance first suggests. The alcohol is apparent from the beginning, and detracts a bit from drinkability. The father of the dopplebock style does not live to the initial expectation, as it has been surpassed by a more talented child (i.e., Celebrator)."
"Great to sip slowly. Definitely a nice doppel bock."
"Comes in 500ml brown bottle with with a slightly different label than the BA picture shows. Pours a nice, vibrant cherryish amber with a short-lasting, sticky white head. Deep, beautiful aroma of malt, malt, and more malt. Essence of molasses, cherry, caramel, and alcohol. Sweet palate contains notes of sweet malt, treacle, biscuit, and sweet fruit. Alcohol comes through in the back of the mouth, then reaches up and smacks you on the top of the head. Rich, thick, slightly syrupy body. Had trouble finishing the bottle by myself, you have to watch the 7.5 abv. Nevertheless, I'm a fan."
"This may have been one of the 1st Dopplebocks I ever drank, and it is still one of my favorites. I believe Paulaner continuously puts out great German beer. The color is a deep brown/red. It pours with just a bit of a head, and a lace when drinking. The aroma is a heavenly blend of malt, malt, and a hint of hops. The taste is a complex mix of the malt, maybe a little caramel, and the alcohol on the back end. As with all beers of this style, I think it is difficult to drink more than 2 or 3, but this is a great beer."
"Pours a gorgeous cheery wood dark amber with a phenomenal tannish head that is magnificent. Lacing is excellent. The smell is strong of fruitiness and traces of alcohol. Strong cider apple with not bitterness to speak of, no hops present. The taste was very dissapointing. It was to sweet, to syrupy strong with no hop bitterness to blend it all together. It was like sucking on apple syrup, that is great on pancakes but not in a beer glass. Nice medium bodied smooth feel but the taste of this does not refect what I want in a beer."
"I made the mistake of drinking it too quickly, it needs to warm up a bit before it loses it's bite. Once it does so it's a phenomenal beer. I was stunned by it's lack of bitterness. Almost fruity and light. Goes down too easy. I could've had a bunch of these. Best with a heavy meal, not for the faint of heart. Taste hits you in several layers."
"Great color, the head's not as big as i would like, (although i may have poured it cooler than it should be) Smell is very malty, maybe a little caramel. As others have said, taste is pretty complex, a lot going on... starts with sweet malt, then a little hops, almost spicy, then maybe a little of the 'sour apple' that Venom mentioned (i can't exactly put my finger on the taste, so that's as close as i can get...) followed with caramel and a little bitterness for the long finish. Good mouthfeel, really sticks around, although maybe thinner than I would prefer. Drinkability would be around one or two at the end of the night - not my session brew, but a great nightcap."
"Thx"
"Taste is good, but not great. The astringency is there with some alcohol overtones. I was expecting a little more malt sweetness, and find myself wanting more. An excellent brew for sure, but the Celebrator is much more my style. That said, I would never turn one of these down if offered one.."
"one of the beers on this planet that any discerning beer drinker has to have tried, salvator is one of the benchmarks for the style. many have endevored to copy this little beauty, and not come within an elephants trumpet of succeeding. if you havent had this, and have the good fortune to come across it, it should be purchased and consumed no questions asked."
"IMHO, this is THE dopplebock. I can't imagine how it could be any better, absolutely fantastic. One of the best beers I've had, period."
"I think a beer like this would go better in colder weather than in the humidity of a Houston summer. I will return to this beer again in colder weather and see how I feel then."
"Pours with a two-finger head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Deep, clear amber color. Low carbonation. Nose is malty. Medium bodied. Starts sweet, very smooth, the high ABV is not noticable. $1.90 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"All in all, another winner from the folks at Paulaner. This is a bit off of the beaten path for a doppelbock, but I'd say give it go if you come across it. It's a different take on a time-honored and sometimes all too predictable style."
"This is on the pale side of doppelbock; its a dark tan and not really very clear. It's got a good head, though. The almost prune aroma and flavor dominates with a sweet caramel backup. Its not too heavy but packs a definate punch. It does get a bit sweet, but not so much so that I had trouble finishing off a half liter."
"Salvator is a good beer, rather complex, perhaps something that would take getting used to, definately not something I could drink a lot of, but seems like it would make a great beer to have on a cold night."
"Pours out a clear golden mahogony color with a hefty light brown head. Aroma is very sweet & malty, with almost a beef jerky type aroma. Nice spicy alcohol aroma. Unfortunately, the taste is not as full as the aroma. It seems most flavors are in the background. Starts off with a smooth mild maltiness, along with some somewhat blandish cardboard type taste. The taste is in the finish, where the maltiness turns sweet & sticky and the alcohol turns spicy. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin at first then becomes syrupy, which detracts from the drinkability. Good, but give me a Korbinian any day."
"This isn't the best dopplebock, but it isn't objectionable and it is certainly drinkable. Would rather have a Celebrator or even Sam Adams DB though."
"The mouthfeel was very good on this beer. It was meaty and rich with just enough carbonation."
"This is a decent beer, just not my style. I want to try Celebrator."
"Had this one as a dessert after a meal of chicken and rice. Amber colored with a tremendous, frothy head. Great smell, apples and a touch of caramel. Very sweet smelling. Very smooth for a doppel bock. Mouthfeel was very smooth as well. A very tasty beer, very drinkable for a dopple bock.. I would have this one agian."
"Good beer, immensely drinkable. Could be a session beer for me if not for the 7.5% abv!"
"The aroma is very sweet. Almost smells like gingerbread cookies. A very pleasant aroma. The first taste overwhelms and I have to go for another to get a grasp of it. Definitely a sweet bready taste. A hint of alcohol can be detected. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and seems a little thin for a doppel bock. Not my favorite doppel bock, but not a bad drink."
"quite drinkable. I woudl buy this one again, but if i had my choice i would probably opt for celebrator"
"Totally limpid copper hue with a small off-white head that is quickly limited to a ring. Honest malty aroma with a light floral hops note. Mainly geared toward caramel, white chocolate, cashews, vanilla and not so well-hidden alcohol. Very sweet palate. Hazelnuts and crème caramel, licorice and marshmallows. Interesting flavor profile, but that's just because I love the style and this one doesn't have any of the balancing elements (smoke, light bitterness) that top examples like celebrator can boast about. It's all about the malt which can become rather cloying at the end of the bottle. Smooth creamy medium body displaying particularly low carbonation."
"I did not find the complexity I was looking for in this beer, and I thought the alcohol was more present than it should be. It struck me as around on par with Samuel Adams Double Bock, but I still like Optimator the best out the doppelbocks I've tried (I've yet to try Aventinus or Celebrator). A respectable brew by all accounts, but I've had better."
"This was a decent beer, but nothing super crazy or anything. It had many great smells with it, as well as tastes. It was fairly sweet, but still had the bold malt flavor that is associated with this style. The alcohol was a little strong for the other tastes, but it wasn't anything too unbearable. There was the flavors of ""dull"" or ""dark"" fruits, but they kind of took a side stage to the malt. I am a big malt guy, so this was a drinkable beer to me. The head was a little disappointing, but I guess you can't have everything all of the time."
"Zum wohl!"
"A lot more hops-bite to this brew than Celebrator, not nearly as much character or depth. After this comparison taste-test, I'm standing by my earlier numbers -- a nice beer, but too hoppy and light-feeling to stand with its superiors. This is a ""light"" doppelbock!"
"My first doppel. Picked it up pretty much on a whim and I'm glad i did. It pours a nice amber color with a white head that disappears pretty quickly. Aroma is of malt and alcohol. On first taste the alcohol is definetly present but so is a ton of malt. This is a malt monster, notes of raisin are also apparent. Mouthfeel is decent. I just don't know how drinkable this one is. 1 will do me for a long time. Maybe it's just not my style so i can't mark it too low."
"I just picked up a Celebrator, so I should have a nice comparison soon."
"Super drinkable, a super German Bock beer."
"Notes: I have a personal predilection for sweet, malty, full-bodied beers. So doppelbocks tend to be among my favorite beers. Salvator is certainly an archetype of the style."
"Dark copper color. The beer is kind of transparent. A nice smell of coffee, caramel and malt. The taste is all about malt. Very well balanced with the 7.5% abv. Some sweetness too, light hints of lemon. Some spices too. The mouthfeel is thick. The alcohol became more noticeable as I was drinking. A nice brew, but I couldn't sip on that all night long."
"Starts with an oily mouth full of cocoa-malty sweetness not impaired by the detectable spalter hops until the finish which is herbal hop pronounced with the smokey roast coming in in the final stages. Relatively clean finish for shich a big lager...but that is part of this bock's signature....everything in moderation"
"Color is a dark, reddish amber. Off-white foamy head lasts a little while then quickly falls back to a ring. The beer is very clear and you can see very tiny carbonation bubbles rising in the liquid. Smell is pretty subdued, mostly malty with some fruit. Taste is really good! Rich malty flavor and a little sweetness. Fruity top notes, maybe raisins and some carmel. Finish includes a taste of hops and alcohol warmness. A little bit of banana in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth with fine carbonation. Very drinkable for a 7.5% ABV beer!"
"A very fine coppery body in appearance, clear, but with a minimal off-white head that fizzles out quickly. Aroma is thick with bread, butterscotch, and dried dates and raisins, and a boozy alcohol presence is apparent, although not overpowering. Flavour closely matches, sweet malt up from with the dried fruit, carrying through with a buttery marmalade middle, and finishing with a surprising herbal hop finish, and a bit of alcohol kick, albeit a smooth kick. Full velvety mouthfeel, it is a pleasure to have this roll over the tongue and wash over the palate. Very drinkable for a higher abv beer, in the fact that I could see myself turning this one into a sessional (one that I have no doubt I would regret the next morning), as well as that I'd reach for it again the next time I am out beer shopping. Probably not a flagship doppelbock, but it is mighty fine for what it is, and the stepping stone I would use to introduce this style to others, that's for sure."
"Drinkability: Good. Wears on you after awhile."
"This is still an above average beer... just not exeptional."
"Despite its shortcomings, this beer is pretty good. I just don't think it would be my first choice."
"Mouthfeel is lovely and rich - classic for the style. Quite drinkable for what it is, and a pleasant dinner companion."
"This is a robust and complex brew!"
"Definite malty continuance."
"Very Very caramelly and unbelieveably malty. Pretty hoppy as well. Awesome for the style."
"I thought this was a drinkable brew, but again not with garlic pizza."
"Overall Impression: As for drinkability, the taste says yes, the thick mouthfeel and alcohol say no. This is a meal, and while I want another meal… in a few hours, not another one right now, thanks. I find this is in the same class as a Celebrator, which is a good class to be in. I would recommend finding this one."
"Took me awhile to get here, but I can now appreciate this beer and it's good ratings."
"Salvator pours a clear amber with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. It's smell is malty and fruity. It tastes winey with a hint of malt, grapes, and raisins. It has a dry hoppy finish. It feels slightly oily, and has a nice light feel with a dry finish that has some hints of iron. It is a drinkable beer, but lacks some of the strength and complexity of other double bocks."
"Very drinkable dopplebock that pours a beautiful ruby red color with no head. The aroma is fruity, but too reminiscent of fruit punch to be necessarily great. The taste is malty, sweet and fruity, leading to a sour fruit aftertaste. Nice. Slight carbonation and light on the palate, but full in the body. A good beer, but has hardly any hoppiness. Still, a good drinkable dopplebock."
"Bottle - Poured an amber colored brew with a medium size head. Retention is very average as well as the carbonation. A bit of caramel and sweetness with an above average body. ABV is well hidden. Not the best doppelbock I have tasted but bot bad either."
"The flavor is a bit better than that of Sam Adam's Double Bock, but the body and feel are not quite as good. I could drink several Salvator's until the 7.5% kicked me."
"Medium bodied with a full, rich and creamy mouthfeel. Would make a great dessert beer, but still pretty drinkable."
"Overall a just a touch too sweet for my liking and the alcohol a little too noticeable."
"In your face carbonation and over-the-top unique flavour. Popular with mates. High alcohol and not that greatly masked but liked it. Need some food to not have to crawl away. Nice brown colour and bubbles. Aftertaste made it nicely drinkable. Chestnut chocolatley toasted malt."
"Appearance: Ruby caramel tone with a creamish tan head leaves nice lacing behind after the frothy head begins to dwindle down. Aroma: Mild alcohol with nice ripened fruit undertones seems a bit like a plum brandy tone, to sum it up this is all malt here some hops to touch it up but basically it's all malt here baby. Mouthfeel: Not as big as I once thought when I first started tasting different types of beer this was huge to us very complex not it's a very drinkable mass produced authentic German dopplebock with a lighter body for a d-bock but it's nice overall mild carbonation. Drinkability: A solid brew but I would go for a Celebrator before this one."
"As much as hopheads would embrace a fine IPA, malt-lovers should welcome a doppelbock such as Salvator. This is one for those cold nights where you want a nice warming brew to sit back and relax with."
"Drinkability: a very, very good dopplebock. you can't go wrong."
"Edit: Used this to marinate a steak with cracked black peppercorns, garlic and olive oil. Turned out fantastic."
"Some beers get worse as you drink them and some get better. This one just keeps getting better and better. I might be able to drink it as a session beer if it doesn't get too sweet after a few."
"Intimidating pour, bright, opaque amber, with a thick, bubble-bath tan head. Up front, not a beer to be toyed with. Has a large chewy/malty/sticky body, alcohol immediately noted. Spicy in the body, hints of caramel and even apple notes. Creamy and dangerously slick as it warms, more flavorable as it ages. Medium warming effect that bites back; very tasty and enjoyable, stands on it's own as a world class doppelbock, simply incredible."
"A nice dark brown color, a very fine choice. I can see why this beer has such a good reputation."
"The bottle was brown with an old school label. What looks like a date is smudged. Poured a mohagany red . The best smelling beer I've ever had the chance to test. Some sweet notes in the brew that I could not recognize. Maybe Raisin? Fine brew. Enjoy"
"This is an example of the brewers art!!"
"A great beer that I will sample again."
"A very beautiful looking beer, only it seems to be a little light in color for a dopple bock. It is a rust brown color, with a huge white head. Has a sharp flavor, with lots of carbonation, a tinge of alcohol, and a smooth, slick finish. This is a very good beer. Not quite like the other dopplebocks I have had, but full of flavor, and something that needs to be tried by all."
"Translucent copper colored with decent beige head that thins out rather quickly. Caramelly sweet malt aromas with yeast notes consistent with a bock beer. Not a lot of hops noticable. Chewy, crystally malt flavor backed with a significant alcohol punch. Smooth malt profile. Very drinkable, but a touch on the sweet side. One of the finer doppelbocks I've tried. The malt is definitely the best part of this beer."
"I couldn't see myself drinking this all the time, but it would be fun to return to, and see what else I get from it."
"I had never heard of this one when I bought it last week. Needless to say, what a very pleasant surprise. Definitely a world class doppelbock that I would rate just a notch below my beloved Celebrator."
"Paulaner is probably my favorite Munich brewer, and with consistent home runs like Salvator, they will probably remain so."
"Pours to a generous off-white head that sticks around with patchy foam and lace. Nice orange-amber color. Aroma is smoky malt. Flavor is smoky malt, alcohol and sweet Munich malt. finishes sweet and with lingering bitterness and alcohol warmth. Very balanced and drinkable."
"Delicious stuff. Uncomplicated."
" Pouring it up, I noticed a warm brown (almost amberish) color, maybe with a touch of chestnut in appearance. The aroma reminded me of sweet things like honey or apricot. It left a pretty average head, but the bubble action was fun. The first taste was surprising; a little more tangy/metallic than I remembered from the tap, but it wasn't bad - if there could be a cross between something like pineapple and caramel, I think you could find it here. The sweetness sort of pervaded, perhaps just a little too much. I think this one should be enjoyed with certain meals, maybe involving sausage or steak... definately steak. I don't know if I would drink a lot of this, but it's a nice change-of-pace type of beer when it's available."
"Bright, shiny, delicious, with alcohol content eventually rearing it's powerful head. Flavor feels burnished, roasted, still fruity, and let us never forget, delicious. A world class beer, a champion doppelbock, and surprisingly approachable."
"Appearance: bright red copper color with light effervescence. A full fluffy beige head with limited retention and a sticky lace. The taste is very astringent with a sweet middle (malt, caramel) and a lingering bite. Aroma: Malt, spices, caramel and aroma hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, some effervescence and a lingering bite. IMHO: Too abrupt with the astringent bitterness. Not well balanced with other (sweeter) characteristics."
"This pours a soft, clear, light amber colour. The lazy carbonation reluctantly rises to make a pencil thin mustache of a head. A very pungent nose of prunes and caramel with just a whiff of alcohol. The silky sweet malts fill your mouth and leave just a taste of leather. A very filling and rich bock. Cant go wrong with this one. It sure packs a punch so be careful."
"Irregular size bubbles, Red/orange color fully diminishing fizzy off-white head. Sweet aroma with malts mixed in and heavy malty nose, with hint of dark bread, toasted, nutty, honey aromas. Light hoppy, flowers, weak citrus (orange) note. Floral nose from alcohol. Bittersweet character, full flavor of toasted malt. Full body, syrupy texture, soft carbonation. Pleasant warming beer. The flavor again was very malty, some fruits, and a bit of spice near the end. Very tasty."
"Achtung: this is a potent brew, but remarkably quaffable if your thirsty. Pours deep amber hue with intense malt aromatics. Definitely all about the malt, but yet somehow in the middle of tasting this beer, I find a balance between the malt and hop. Salvator exhibits remarkable complexity for a lager beer, with bits of sweet candy and fruity flavors; bits of toffee and fig and a subtle nuttiness. Or, maybe I'm just nutty. This is a great dopplebock and probably the easiest drinking one (danger!) I've sampled."
"I picked this up because I know it is a classic and it did not disappoint. I have been enjoying it as a nightcap, sharing a 16.9 with the missus, who likens its potency to a cognac. The malt is smooth, sweet without being cloying. The hop dryness enables a lengthy finish for a beer of this type, but it is satiating and luxurious. I am looking forward to finding a bottle of Ayinger for comparison, but this beer has earned a permanent place in my inventory."
"Pours a deep reddish/amber, medium sized tan head quickly diminishes and leaves little lacing. Aroma is very sweet and malty, some caramel, and a bit of alcohol. Flavor is almost overly sweet, a bit of bitterness in the finish, and again a bit of alcohol. Medium body, alcohol gets a bit more prevelant as it warms"
"($2.24 / 16 oz. bottle)"
"The pour a nice translucent amber color, the head preposterous in size, bright white in color, the consistency creamy and the residual lace a thick and clinging sheet, nose malt, sweet, fresh and pleasing with a thick malt start, sweet and the top skimpy in feel. Finish is mean spirited in its acidity, the hops pops youre buds, the aftertaste very dry and long lasting, a good if a bit thin doppelbock, and a long time favorite."
"Prost!"
"Drinkability: Nice workhorse of a doppelbocck. Great one to introduce someone to the style, but I much prefer Celebrator (prolly due to the lil' goats). I'll probably snag this one every now and then for variety's sake. At 7% ABV, this is not one to be quaffed like an O-fest."
"Notes: Seven thumbs up."
"Orange red color, medium head. Very malty and robust. Complex flavor, rich and flavorful. Malty and somewhat appleish and nutty. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is malty. There is some alcohol bite, but not to harsh. Nice beer."
"A medium body with a syrup quality to the mouthfeel. A crisp feel of carbonation to the aftertaste. A really nice and chewy feel in the mouth. Execllent all around for me. I am sure there is more to this bock than my limited experience with the style can figure out."
"The head is big, deep-cream-colored, dense and foamy. It leaves thick, sticky foam on the glass. The beer is a clear deep copper. Nice. The nose is sweet, malty, toffeey. The sweet, toffee front is almost sugary. But it turns creamy and deep malty in the middle. The finish shows alcohol, some chocolate and some grains. And it dries. If it weren't such a dorky word, I'd call this beer ""sublime"". Let's say ""complex", ""delicious", ""comforting"" instead."
"Had to step back a bit in evaluating this offering. The head and appearance with lacing were very good. I'm don't usually try to sample these stronger brews...so here goes. Smell had a definite alcohol scent, but it was offset but a fruity aroma. Flavor was sweet, with a strong alcohol accent...reminded me of an after dinner cordial. Mouthfeel was very full and robust....don't guzzle! a definite sipping brew. For the alcohol content, very drinkable (if you sip). Not the kind of beer to drink all night, but I certainly would have one before bed to help me sleep."
"Poured a dark amberish color,surprisingly slight fruit aroma, first mouthful indicated chocolate carmel and some fruit, but none of them were very bold, doesn't seem as complex as described. A nice sweet taste stayed with you. Its nice, just wish it were a little heavier."
"The taste was pure candy from go with candied malt accents, esters, fruit, and sweet and spicy hops. Medium body and the carbonation is fairly high and dancing on the tongue and all over the mouth. The drinkability is not very high for me as I thought it was a bit to sweet. But a great, and extremely complex beer."
"Paulaner has definitely produced a good dopplebock. Not overly sweet, it manages to just hit the right balance. This is certainly one I'd have again!"
"A tasty looking reddish-brown brew with a cream colored head atop it. Pretty good head retention for a doppelbock. It does stay for a while, but it goes away for the most part eventually. Lots of caramel sweetness in the nose, and an almost candi sugar-like sweetness as well. Grainy undertones are also noticeable. On the palate, it's big caramel malt up front, very smooth. As it reaches the middle, it gets a bit more intense, and a cereal grain character is added to the mix. More caramel intensity at the back, with just a hint of hop leaves. This continues into the finish, which is suprisingly almost dry. Rich and malty throughout, as a doppelbock should be. Excellent, one of my favorites in the style. Can't wait to have another!"
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick light tan head. The aroma is traditional lager , but with the presence of some crystal malts. The taste is good. The beer is light in mouthfeel and is carbonated well. There seems to be a hint of molasses here; also some dark lovibond crstal malts. The beer drinks well and is my favorite so far from the Paulaner brewers."
"A very fine Doppel that looked, smelled and tasted good. The large egshell head left slowly and created good lacing. There was a very nice dark red amber body that is really quite lovely. The aroma is bready and malty and the taste fills in much the same way, ie., with nice breadiness. A very smooth and creamy body hel to make this a nuicely drinkable beer."
"Thick off white head dissipated slowly leaving a little belgian lace. The color is a deep red with a little orange tint to it. Aroma is very complex with carmelly malts and a hop balance with a definte alcohol scent. Flavor is sweetish with carmel notes and a hallertauer hop character and a malty finish. Body is light and refreshing which seems to hide the strength of the alcohol. Very drinkable especially if you are going up against the catholic church over religious dogma or just thirsty for a fine complex doppelbock."
"Shiny copper color with a thick, foamy head that rests about a half inch of beige foam on top of the liquid. As it slowly settles, it leaves a sheet of lace all around the glass. Nose is sweet and fruity, smacks of alcohol, sweet malt, fig, and cotton candy. Taste is sweet malt, bits of raisin, pear, and light molasses. An alcohol vapor rolls around the mouth. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Smooth for the ABV, but you do know it's there."
"Matly/Breaddy feel at first, but creamy, like a cream pie. The fruitness reminded me of pie. mmmmmmmmmmm pie. Smelled like a bouquet. Little bit of hops, slight dryness to it, but notig really noticable. Nice bit of fizz through and through. the alchohol taste balances the sweet taste with the hops thrown in very nicely. Go, get yourself 5, enjoy"
"ng"
"Ruby red in color with a head that is small but lasted until near the final sip. Very nice appearance. Taste had a biscuity base to it. Some alcohol kick was noticed at the beginning but faded towards the end. Light caramel malts and other sweetened malt flavors were there. A hop kick showed in the aftertaste but wasn't really there in the body. Quite interesting."
"Poured a reddish brown amber color. Big, off-white head that disappeared after about three minutes, leaving a foamy ring. Moderate lacing. Smell was of toasted malt, with fruit and floral notes. Very creamy mouthfeel. Taste was of toasted malt, fruit, a hint of caramel, and a minor zap from the hops to wind things up, just enough to keep the malt from being overpowering. The fruity aspect reminds me a little of fruitcake, except it's good! A very satisfying beer, but a little filling, so I don't think I'd like to drink lots of them at a sitting."
"Notes: One of my top two or three favorite doppels to date. Highly recommended, but I'd like to revisit it during the colder months. Excellent, though, even in July."
"This is a doppel that I truly enjoy drinking and this is one of my favorite beers! To me it has a superb taste and goes down very smooth and easy. This beer poured a medium head with medium sized bubbles. The nose was malty and the body was clear and this beer had a brown hue."
"This brew pours a very nice malty caramel aroma from a transparent light brown body with a medium head of fine to medium sized bubbles. It has a slightly fizzy initial mouth feel followed by a very nice smoky, slightly burnt, chewy full bodied spicy flavor. This is one of my favorite brews of all time. Next to Andechs, it was my favorite Doppelbock while I was overseas in Germany. Its high alcohol content can be felts even after just a few sips. It goes down very easy. I love it!"
"500 ml bottle Poured a dark copper with a biege head that quickly receded. No sign of lacing on the glass. Aroma is malty and sweet. Taste is again malty and to me overly sweet, the alcohol come through as well. I was unable to really enjoy this because of the overpowering sweetness. Not the best dopple bock I've had."
"I had this on draught in Germany a few years ago and enjoyed it very much. This sample was a 12oz bottle that poured crystal clear brown with a thick tight head that dissapeared in a couple minutes leaving only a few tiny dollops of white foam. Only slight lacing as well. Aroma is super sweet and malty with a hint of alcohol. Flavor is also very sweet and nothing but malt. It improves as it warms and flavor loses a little sweetness. Not nearly as impressive as when I had it on draught but a fine Doppelbock none the less and probably the best German Doppel out there."
"Pours a very clear brown with a thick, foamy head. The head diminishes very quickly and leaves a very nice looking beer behind. The smell is rich and malty, with a hint of butter. Tastes sweet-almost caramel like, and malty. The finish is dry and very pleasant. Very smooth with a medium to full bodied feel. Very drinkable, but quite filling. A very good beer for relaxing with on a cool spring evening."
"Overall I found this beer to be a decent bock, but nothing to write home about. Although I'd really be interested to try it in Germany rather than imported to the U.S. I suspect this bottle might have been near the end of it's life and if fresh could be a lot better."
"I will say no more, but let my perfect '5' be a clear statement, that although this beer could be changed, it could never be improved!"
"Overall Impression: This is a supremely well-crafted beer, one of the hallmarks of the style. Robust, nourishing and complex. Mighty powerful, too."
"Has to be one of the best doppel bocks out there,oured a nice deep copper color with nice slight off-white creamy head,smell is very appetizing of alcohol and sweet caramel and slight burnt notes.Taste is sweetish of toffee and alcohol,and slight fruitiness.To me this is one of the standards of doppel bocks out there."
"This was quite a nice beer. It is a nice copper color, similar looking to a glass of whiskey. You can smell the alcohol when you open the bottle, and you can definately taste it as well. There are also some traces of caramel and maybe some other flavors hidden in there as well. A very nice beer, give it a go."
"This is a very complex beer and a bit hard for me to rate as I consider myself still somewhat of a novice beer geek. The appearance is copper in color, I expected it to be darker being a double bock. It poured with a nice thick head that lasted about 3 or 4 minutes. Aroma is malty with fruit and a bit of alcohol. Its taste is a bit like a barley wine, sweet, fruity and alcohol, but nicely balanced with the malt and hops - that is to say not overly fruity which really turns me off. It is not overly carbonated. It left a nice malty caramel aftertase. This beer is very drinkabe, although not everyday. This one to sit back relax and enjoy slowly - definately not a bar type of beer. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a thin head, but has great lacing. Looks surprisingly light. Smells a little sweet. The aroma is decent, but nothing really special here. It doesn't taste as sweet as it smells. It's a very tasty brew. Very good aftertaste and incredibly drinkable. The overall feel of the beer is something like an oak barrel."
"Poured a gorgeous oranged amber color with a bubbly off-white head, good slow lace, and a little staining on the glass. Nose was of caramel, beauiful roasted wheat, and a nutty malt that also gave off a corn scent. Taste was a hearty malt, roasted only enough. Clear and clean, but with a creamy tone and one ounce of sweetness. Then came an opposing burnt sensation at the finish. Mouthfeel was fairly oily. Not the greatest tasting finish, became creamier with time. Quite mellow for a double bock."
"Poured a nice deep copper color with a small head that dissipated fairly quickly, but a bit of lace remained. The smell was very sweet malty with just a hint of caramel, roasted malt and perhaps some smoke. The taste was very malty, and there was a stronger alcohol flavor than I expected. The carbonation level was not great, it sort of felt like an alcoholic syrup covering the inside of my mouth. All in all, I thought it was pretty good, but I wasn't that impressed. This was however my first venture into a true doppelbock. Perhaps my review was slightly skewed because of my inexperience. I?ll try some more doppelbocks and then try this again to reevaluate."
"pours a dark-reddish brown. decent head that lasts a while. the first sip reveals that this beer is all about the malt...as should be expected. rich, chewy, full bodied mouthfeel. a touch of european hops at the end to balance things out at the end. certainly not a session brew, but a full-bodied complex treat to sip on."
"Clear light amber-copper color with a nice foamy lasting white head, sweet fruity and flowery aroma. Sweet and malty roasty caramel flavors very sweet in the finish, medium body with a sticky mouthfeel, alcohol well hidden, above average dopplebock worth a try always a good choice."
"A true classic. Although I would give Celebrator a slight edge (in flavor), Salvator is as good a ""winter warmer"" as any. Has a smooth, almost honey-like texture. Hints of carmel in the flavor, reminds me a lot of thier Octoberfest, just a little fuller. Pours a deep, amber hue, decent sized head, some retention. I believe that Salvator is another world classic that has been overshadowed by more recent, over the top beers. I have never been disappointed by this beer. (re-review, 10/03 - just doesn't seem as good. Weaker, thinner? I don't know, but not as good as I remember)."
"Taste is super subtle of toffee, roasted malt, sweet, and is kinda creamy/silky smooth, a little bit chewy, with a lingering dryness that settles in and goes into the finish, which gets lighter. The finish, again, reminded me of that dry mouth feeling you get from eating dry popcorn. I really liked the feel of this beer, its so complex and layered. The taste is well rounded and has great subtle complexities as well. Absolutely drinkable and enjoyable. Highly recommended as far as dopplebocks go."
"I was getting toasted nuts,caramel,toffee,brown sugar,apple cider among other things. A strong beer that you want to drink and savor as you go. It is full bodied and heavy tasting,buttery, yet very drinkable. Hop presence and bitterness is low with the accent definitely on the malts. This beer pushes close to tasting like a barleywine. A special beer and a treat for any enthusiast."
"Pours a deep amber/brown color with a huge creamy head that fades down slowly leaving a sticky lace on the glass. The aromas slightly smoky with sweet caramel and malt undertones. The taste was mildly sweet and malty with just a hint of spiciness at the end. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and Im looking forward to my next one."
"The original dopplebock, brewed as 'liquid bread' by the monks for their fasts. In order to become a classic, beer really ought to taste this good"
"Deep reddish copper color with a thin tan head and no lacing. The smell of malt, and cinnamon-raisin toast. Very pleasing smell overall. The raisin came through in the taste, but the cinnamon did not, rather it was replaced by a deeper flavor of brown sugar or molasses. The taste was malty, but with some slight hop tones (maybe I was just searching for them). There was no indication of ABV for my tastes. The beer was smooth with less carbonation than average, but was overall very drinkable. I think this is a better representative of its style than its rank indicates."
"A nice dopplebock with malty highlight. I've had this one many times and everytime it seems a bit different. Very sweet for a dopplebock but also very alcoholic overtones and tastes. It is highly drinkable but dangerous, so remember to sip this beer as it does sneak up on you."
"Pours a clear copper in color with a creamy off-white head. Aroma consists of malt, biscuit and sweet caramel. The mouthfeel is thin to medium-bodied, but seems inline with a lagered doppelbock. Delicious sweet malt and caramel flavors dominate the palette. Alcohol comes through lightly in the finish. An excellent, easy-drinking and flavorful doppelbock. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style. Would love to seek this one out on draft."
"Fairly light for a doppel, pours an amber body with almost white head. Sweet and malty its a bit less flavorful than some other doppels. Very drinkable, and it won't kill your wallet like drinking celebrator all night will. A solid #3 doppel in my book, only Celebrator and Optimator are better for over all drinking pleasure."
"pours out a clear dark amber colour....a thin head fades quickly, leaving little lace. very strong aromas of sweet toasted munich malts. tastes of sweet malts, brown sugar, sweet burnt fruitcake, spicy hops and alcohol. smooth and creamy mouthfeel. beefy malt goodness here. sweeter than celebrator...more complex than optimator. it's so balanced it's scary in it's drinkability. an exceptional dopplebock."
"I was first impressed by its beautiful appearance. a coppery, reddish translucent fliud poured softly into my 0.5l glass, with about an inch of slightly tan, thick foam. however, as i drew it nearer to my mouth the strong, malty and soury smell became more perceptible and less attractive for my first impression. i took a sip, nonetheless. a sweet, malty taste combined with a perceptible alcoholization and a considerable bitterness. a good taste, but not the best mouthfeel; i wouldn't drink three in a row."
"Pours a very rich coppery color with a creamy white lace. Very aromatic with overpowering alcohol and caramel. Taste is very malty with obvious alcohol and some caramel and smoke. This is a crazy, crazy brew. Oh so complex and intoxicating, but oh so good. Definitely one of my favorites."
"This is a very drinkable Double bock..one would need to be careful of how much is consumed because I am sure this will get you tipsy very quickly..but overall I loved this beer.."
"This is my first beer of this style. And damn am I impressed! Copper in color with a small tan head, this beer smells amazingly of caramel, toffee, sweetness, and maybe even a hint of smoke. This is such a tasty brew; caramel and toffee come through strongly, as well as malt, and then a dry finish. No bitterness whatsoever and no hint of the 7.5% ABV, making it temptingly dangerous. :) I don't feel as if I could drink many of these in a row though. It was very thick in my stomach for some reason, which is odd since I have been known to down many stouts in a row sometimes. But regardless, I very quickly just became a fan of this style."
"This rich, reddish copper beer pours with a thick tan head that recedes to a fine layer of foam. The aroma is of roasted caramel, sweet and satisfying caramel. Nice roasted malt character and just a bit of floral hops in the nose. The first sip reveals strong malt sweetness, with caramel, brown sugar , and molasses flavors abounding. A bit of bitterness cleans the palate on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, with mild carbonation. Drinakbility is very good as well, especially for malt-lovers. I feel like I didn't say enough about this beer. It's pretty complex and top notch in every respect, but it defies description for me tonight. This is the original dopple-bock, and I imagine it would be tough to beat. Hundreds of years since it's creation, this is still a world-class bier."
"Pours a clear amber in color with an off white head. Aroma shows the big malt body that lies within. Taste of toasted caramel malt. Malt flavor dominates as expected. Not as sweet as some dopplebocks. Hops chime in at the finish to prevent too much lingering sweetness on the finish. Decent mouthfeel, but seems a little thin for a dopplebock IMO. Good drinkability. This is not a style I'm really into, but this is a pretty good beer."
"Cheers"
"Pretty beer! Yes you are. Nose of a cigar box stuffed with chocolate and cherries. Appropriately balanced sweet malts and steely hops finish with an herbal whisper. Mouthfeel is frizzy and unkempt, but a damn fine brew nonetheless."
"Red amber color, nice head, caramel and fruit aroma. Taste is sweet caramel and raisons. Raison taste isn't too strong, but I don't like it in a beer. It goes down pretty smooth and the alcohol is well hidden."
"This was a very good beer, and IMO one of the best of the style."
"No strong alcohol taste even with the strong abv.!"
"A true classic, and the world's first doppelbock. If you want to learn about them and how they should taste, you should start here and then move on to others. A consistently fantastic beer."
"Pours a deep amber colour topped by a nice thick brown head that settles down rather easily. Aroma is dominated by malt. Flavour is malty and good carbonation. Tastes a bit sweeter than what i expected. Very good German brew"
"This is my first dopplebock to try and I must say I was very impressed. The smell was a nice, not too strong, sweet malty flavor. The head could have been a little better. It was gone after the 3rd or 4th sip. Flavor was a bitter sweet, caramel, malty taste. Overall, a good, easy to drink, creamy beer. I'll be drinking more of this one."
"I must try this on draft I feel to truly appreciate it I think."
"Pours a deep amber color with a reddish hue. Off white head that starts off decent and settles into a half inch sheet, leaving some lace. Toasty malt aroma with hints of alcohol, fruit, and carmel. Medium body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Rich flavor of toasted malt and light caramel, and the alcohol does not hide. Finishes with some hop flavor and a smokey aftertaste. A nice beer on a cold night as it warms you up."
"Salvator Double Bock pours to a beautiful mahogany color, with a think off-white head.  The nose is toasty, biscuity, and malty.  The taste is wonderful, with toffee notes and malty sweetness.  It has an alcoholic warmth and a dry finish.  Overall, I think this is an excellent Double Bock, with a superb toasted maltiness, and nice alcoholic warmth."
"Flavor is nutty, figgish with an alcohol spiciness.  Very sweet.  Full bodied with a pleasant creminess.  Slightlty sweet finish is held in check by a mixture of peppery alcohol and slight hop bitterness.  Very pleasant evening nightcap."
"A wonderfull beer, with excellent malt character."
"Thanks to ElGuapo and the infamous Daniel Miller for the free sixer."
"Never get left alone with any large quantity of this fluid as it surely will be your down bring."
"delicious. malty aroma with hint of alcohol. pours beautifully, and goes down the chute smooth and rich. you can find the alcohol, but it is not overpowering. an absolute winner. thanks to one of my buddies for special ordering it from the store"
"I just enjoyed my last Celebrator last night and I sat down with one of these before I started my homework.  It struck me as a very similiar taste as celebrator (as I guess the type would make it so) but was significantly weaker.  Thats not to say that is a detriment in the beer.  I look at it as enabling me to drink more of these than I could Celebrator and though I enjoy the taste of Celebrator more, the lighterness of this brew in comparison helps it's drinkability.  Now as for the beer it has a very unique red tint to its dark amber color.  The head is light and cabornation is even lighter.  The taste is a rich toasted malt with a trace of an alcohol aftertaste.  Leaves a slight lace around the ale glass I am drinking out of.  I like this brew and I think I might have thought more of it had it not been for the two six packs of celebrators I have been enjoying all weekend.  I will definetly give it a retry in the future."
"This may be the beer that launched the Dopplebock genre, but I personally think Celebrator blows this away. Not overly complex, but it does pack a punch like any doppelbock should. Great amber color with apartment wall-colored head. Decent smooth finish despite the alcohol flavor. Malt and caramel undertones. Not too bad."
"Clear, deep amber with a reddish cast, and an off-white head that holds fairly well but eventually drops to a minimal collar and leaves limited lace. It offers a bright, clean, toasted malt aroma with a soft background spiciness (that's probably more from alcohol than hops). The body is medium with a moderate carbonation level and a smoothly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is of a rich, toasted malt with a light caramel side, and some obvious alcohol. There's little hop flavor but it's balanced bitterness leaves a dry finish. Not really complex, but very rich and enjoyable."
"Salvator Double Bock:  Deep brown color, very clear, with a coffee and cream head.  Cocoa aroma, with a hint of booze.  Biscuit malt flavor, with but a hint of hops.  Rye bread, and a hint of alcohol warmth on the way down.  Thick, strong brew.  I’ll buy it again when the temperature drops."
"Pours a nice dark copper with an eroding white head, good malty taste,  Easy drinking . It will sneak up behind you and knock you out.  So treat it with the respect it deserves."
"Wow!  Superb!  Has to be my favorite brew from Paulaner.  Pours a very clear caramel color almost like a dark tea.  The 2 finger head is a light tan and dissipates fairly quickly, but still leaves a lace down the glass.  The taste is a slight caramel with a slight earthy tone and well balanced hops.  This a light to medium bodied brew that is very very drinkable!  Prosit!"
"I could not find anything special about this beer. Just an average brew, nothing outstanding or special. I've tried this beer two times and have the same feelings as the first time I tasted it! AVERAGE!"
"A damn great beer!"
"This one's a nice amber with an off-white head that dimishes but sticks around to the end. The smell is malty sweetness with just a bit of hop kick. It starts out very nicely but just gets better as it warms. Caramel and toffee flavors become more pronounced as the beer sits in the glass for a while. It has neither the aroma nor taste of a 7.5% abv beer. It's smooth and very drinkable. I also found the ""ale"" reference on the label to be surprising. However, ale or lager, this is a top-notch beer."
"Thick, off-white head.  Malty, spicy aroma...sometimes with a sense of ripe fruit.  Heavy sweetness and noticeable alcohol.  Extreme malt presence.  For years, I've personally enjoyed Salvator more than Celebrator.  This is a consistently great doppelbock."
"First I was surprised like many at the lighter color of this doppelbock.  It's a nice dark, red amber color with a copper head to it.  Not to heavy of a aroma to it.  Lighter, slightly tangy taste to it.  Nice flavor.  Celebrator is by far the better, but this is still a keeper."
"What a wonderful treat it is to have a benchmark original for your favorite type of beer."
"Very nice copper, caramel color with soft creamy tan head. The smell was unbelivably sweet and smooth. I tasted alot of carmel, spicy sweetness, maybe brown sugar and cinnamon to start.Nice bitterness on the finish. Was a little sticky and syrupy on the tongue, but pleasant. Not as delicious as the Celebrator dopplebock, but easier to drink more than one, and very very good. A new favorite. Cool label as well, a beer deserving of it's name. Freshness date was 4/03"
"An evening of Doppelbocks for me last night.  Clear orange amber.  Consistent 1/2 inch head.  Sweet smell, slightly cinammon bread.  Thick malty flavor, bold front to back, verging on heavy bodied.  Falls spot on as far as style, in the smell, stickiness, and flavor departments.  Falls into the somewhat ordinary as far as complex flavor or impression on the mind.  Malty as all-get-out, but hard to classify the taste other than sweet and dense, maybe slightly brown sugar.  Respectably brewed."
"This beer is copper.  Looks more like an alt than a dopplebock to me.  (Although I guess ""deep amber"" qualifies for a dopplebock.)  Some nice malt on the nose and a little bit of the fruity esters too.  Pretty good taste, but not great.  I just had the Celebrator and this is not in that class.  Maybe one notch below.  Smooth creamy mouthfeel.  Pretty full bodied and definite malt tones on the buds.  I detect a little bit of bitterness in this doppel, but not a lot.  Pretty easy drinking.  Good Doppel."
"I think this is an old bottle. Label says 10.02. I'm assuming this is Oct of last yr. Didn't read the label before I left the store; I wanted to get my last doppelbock kicks in before spring hit full swing. Can't vouch for its storage but seems in reasonably good shape; still pretty sturdy if not ideal. Head disappeared quickly and the more robust malty characteristics are blurred. Any hops are totally obscured. However the flavor has mellowed in an interesting and pleasant way. A little more liqueur-like, sweet on the palate but a hint of matured bitterness at the back of the mouth. Evocative of apples. Not as filling as doppelbocks tend to be. I'll hopefully review this again when I get a primo fresh bottle."
"It just gets better as it sits.  I have not had a better dopplebock.    As I have said, it really bolsters itself up as it warms...seems somewhat thin when cold.  But silky, malty bliss otherwise."
"Deep orange hue, almost the color of a nicely aged scotch. Bubbly tan head that stays for a while, then fades away to let you really take in the beautiful hue. Caramel aroma, faint dark fruitiness, almost like a barley wine in complexity. Tastes of toffee and hard candy, like the kind my grandmother used to have around the house during the holidays, followed by a peppery alcohol finish. Man oh man, this is the Savior!"
"Oooh..Love it!!! Amber/dark copper color, but with minimal head. Mild sweet, malty nose...mmm. Medium-full body, and medium mouthfeel.......!! Love the taste...sweet, malty, a touch nutty, smooth finish.. again: mmmm! Can drink this any time of the day/any day of the week/any week of the year.....you get the picture!!!!"
"Dark red hue.  Crystal clear like a well lagered beer should be.  Thin but persistent head with fairly low carbonation. Very visually appealing.  Toasty, biscuity, melanoidin malt aroma... you can smell the decoction.  Domestic microbrewed doppels always lack this.  Huge malt sweetness dominates initially and is then followed by toffee and caramel flavors.  Very smooth with a medium body-- it definitely doesn't seem too rich and thick.  Incredible balance.  Very low hop bitterness and flavor-- there's no shortage of malt flavors in this brew.  Alcohol warmth very noticeable in the finish.  Yum. I only want a bit more body in this beer.  But that's just me.  This is a tremendously flavorful doppelbock.  I have yet to have a microbrewed version as good as the widely available Ayinger, Spaten or this one."
"Boy do I love doppel's..I have a hard time picking a favorite between the big hitters.  This is another dandy...Copper/bronze in color...soft lace throughout...tremendous aroma...fruity with dark red cherries coming through on the nose...very malty and sweet on the buds...but at least to me, not too sweet.  Just a hint of alchohol on the finish..very smooth...and a very complex taste...tough to identify everything I am tasting but at different spots I taste the dark red cherries...bread...a hint of caramel..a hint of maybe bourbon...very complex but wonderful.  As I grow as a taster I hope to better characterize what I am tasting in beers like this, but for now this will have to suffice..(there is a lot more here in this taste than I can put to words though)..."
"Interesting doughy flavour, kind of tasted like i was drinking bread in liquid form, but it ended up being a little to sticky and sweet in the end."
"Sehr fein brauend, Beifall ! ( Very fine brewing, cheers! )"
"This is one complex brew.  It's very tasty, but hiding behind caramel and fruit notes is the slight kick of hallertau hops.  This is definitely a beer to try. Mmmm.. Hallertau..."
"Dark brown appearance, complex malty aroma, very rich malty flavor with chocolate and carmel overtones.  This brew is like a meal but like the other reviews stated it is very drinkable and smooth."
"Much lighter in color and taste than most dopplebocks, to me more like a marzen in terms of its malty, caramel character."
"I found the kegged version of this delicious. A pleasant change up from the sometimes overwhelming number of pale ales. Dark and toasty, semi-sweet chocolate, an alcohol nip and just enough hop to complete the experience."
