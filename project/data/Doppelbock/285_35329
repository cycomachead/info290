3.66,-1.3,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pilsener glass. A dark reddish brown beer with a shapely off-white head, with an aroma of light toffee, dried dark fruit, sweet wet grains, and some mellow spice notes. The overall aroma is homogenized, with the elements merging together. This smells like the Platonic ideal of a bock beer: A classic brown lager. The palate is similarly well-integrated, with no sharp corners or overtly bold flavors ... No one component tries to trump any other but there's complexity nonetheless. Quite crisp and dry for a doppelbock, with moderate carbonation and body on the thin side. Tastes like brown bread, nutty yeast, molasses, light rum, earthy ginseng spice, and sweet dough, with assertive hopping for the style. Finishes quite crisp and clean with some lingering noble hop spice and grass notes. Certainly well-crafted, although perhaps I was expecting more body and a richer, more sweet flavor profile.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 27, 2014"

Pours slightly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, apple, toast, toffee, molasses, brown bread, light roast, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with light hops. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, light roast, floral, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toffee, raisin, toast, dark bread, light roast, floral, light pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance malty flavors; with a light hop balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent doppelbock style. Very nice complexity and balance of malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 28, 2013"

Warming and slightly alcoholic on the palate, more caramel and toffee slides through as anticipated, gets sweeter as it warms. Lightly fruity and gentle toasty malt notes. Not a ton of complexity but straightforward. Light bitterness in the finish, but sweetness and alcohol wash over this. Medium-heavy feel, and drinkable.

3.63,-2.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"M&D: the mouthfeel is lightly fizzy and refreshing, especially when taking into account the 8.5%abv.; it’s good that the beer never tastes too sweet as the hop bitterness does render a considerable balancing influence, and the sourness typical of a well-lagered bock beer also makes itself felt well enough. Not as good as the same brewery’s other Doppelbock, IMO, perhaps due to the less depth from the malts used, but still an easy-drinking heavy beer.","wl0307","Jan 17, 2012"

Although I'm not sure of the age on this one, I can tell based on the oxidation flavors present that it's probably been at least a couple of years since it was bottled. It is aging quite well, so I give it points for that.

The feel is thin for a malty brew and the alcohol has a slight noticable presence, the carbonation is thin and the brew finishes a tad sweet.

The aromas swayed be back with a deep, almond scent with heavy notes of dehydrated fruits (plumbs, dates), and a hint of chocolate, kona coffee, and rich toffee. The sweet flavors continues what was experienced in the nose, but the bitterness seemed more distractive than complementary. Over-hopped with earthy, pungent hops later gave an astingency to the mouthfeel. Alcohols gain intensity as the sweetness subsides, and often crossing the fence to fusal territories. Grainy flavors persist into the aftertaste. A rich bready, yeasty, toasty flavor arises early, but offers very little quality to the body.

3.61,-2.7,4,3,3.5,4.5,4,"Despite the fact that I can't really taste it, the alcohol seems to bevery prevalent on the nose. Mouthfeel is great, but I'd like to have a little more malt character and sweetness. It is nice to have a relatively clean dopplebock that isn't cloying, but I was expecting more in the way of malty flavors, especially from the people who produce Samichlaus. This has it's highs and lows, and overall is very decent. Worth a shot, but don't expect to be wowed.","phisig137","Feb 24, 2007"
