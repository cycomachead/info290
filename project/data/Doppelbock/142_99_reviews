"Optimator pours a dark brown color with a small lacing head.  There is a sourish, grainish aroma.  The taste has a sharp malt bite to it, grianish.  A bit hard to drink.  Overall its the worst, its a tad hard to drink, grainy."

"O – Some very nice layering of aromas and flavor, with nothing jumping out but everything melding into a highly drinkable, higher alcohol-brew.  This one could sneak up on you.  A well-made beer."

"Tasty, smooth, not the depth of flavor or the rich, thick body of others.  Had bottle (unseen) at a restaurant not known for its beer offerings, so maybe not tasting it at its best."

"Pair with sweet, rich foods. Ideally, I would drink it with a dessert that features real, dark chocolate. The cherry tones also lend itself to pairing with dishes that have actual cherries, like a cheesecake that has some. But, it also works well with an entree that has barbecue sauce."

"it is a good beer.  lucky to have discovered a new store in my area which seems to be the only place that carries this beer.  pretty creamy feel, sweet aromas and flavors, hint of licorice, coffee, black cherry, grape, an oily quality"

"Overall (4.07) : The other two bottles I bought will no doubt be in my fridge for a long time. This beer is so strong I don't think I'll crave or want one for another three days. The flavor is however, on purpose and in your face. Oaty, hoppy, licorice flavor that stays with you. This beer is a punch to the face."

"Pours a dark reddish-brown in color with a good 1+-finger creamy foamy head that settles down to just along the sides of the glass after a while. The lacing is close to ring-like at first then near the the of the drink is very spotty. The aroma is very nice of dark fruit sweetness and malts for the most part. More going on with the taste as the plums and dates (?) add great flavor to this wonderful brew. Medium+ bodied with perfect carbonation. Goes down smooth with no bitter finish at all. A great brew! PROST!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has some great dark fruity notes than other malt heavy doppelbocks lack. Sweet, fairly full mouth and a good bit of carb. Definitely malt heavy, but the tastes of dates and plums really help balance this out and make it more complex. One of the best doppelbocks I've had."
""

""
""
""

"From the first time I had this I loved it.  It has a strong dark malty flavor slightly touched by hops and a heavy body.  It seems only available very seasonably in WI and I make the most of its fall and winter availability."

"Nice go to beer year round. Dark, a bit sour on the tongue, and not too thick. Low carbonation and a high alcohol content make for a beer that will give you a nice buzz before filling you up."

"A yummy dark beer! Tasty, looks great, just a great beer all around. Highly recommended if you're into dark beers. It's not TOO dark, it's just right. I picked it up as a single bottle, but if I were in the mood for a dark beer, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up more than just the single. ;)"
"O: Alcohol is pretty well hidden in this beer but you can almost subtly taste it as the beer warms up. Enjoyable but rich enough in flavor and aroma tat I would likely not be able to have more than one of these in a session. Overall, this beer drinks like a meal - filling."

"Poured a deep and clear brown. The white head is fizzier but doesn't last long. The aroma is definitely malty with dark bread and a sweetness reminiscent of raisins. The taste is similar but there's a nice roasted earthy funkiness in the background. The body is just right with a silky feel and finish. This is what I think of when I think of doppelbock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Would probably reserve this for the fall/winter months, an inexpensive malty beer with a bit of a kick. Could imagine sipping this around a camp fire. A reasonable price point for this beer would be $2 to $2.50 per bottle"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a beige head, very dark amber/brown with medium carbonation. Leaves little lacing as head weakens quickly. Aroma of hops, toffee & caramel. Taste of malty grain syrup some toffee, toasted oats (?) Mouthfeel is milky. Finish of malt richness with a little hop bitterness. Nice but a bit dull."

"Now I'm confused what a Dopplebock is supposed to be like since this came straight from Germany. Now my impression of Dopplebocks are that they aren't that strong in flavor but they are in alcohol content. This is the country that made the Dopplebock. I guess I'll have to try more to find out if this is a fluke."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good, glad to have tried it. Fits in with the classic doppelbocks in style nicely, sort of an easier drinking lighter one if I could say that."
""
"An oldie but goodie. Just the right amount of sweetness. Not as many caramel flavors as other doppels , but that's ok since the spicy flavors are prominent and very appealing. The mouth is medium, perhaps a bit lighter than most in this style, but it seems to go well with the spicy and almost dry finish. This beer is very easy to drink and does not lose anything as you drink. It almost comes across as a session doppelbock in its drinkability. Worth grabbing one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - weaker 4 overall, and barely, but I'll give it one because it is still a solid doppelbock, just not my doppelbock of choice especially with a few better ones out there. The price on this one is good, and it is readily available at most places year-round, which is a bonus."

"Mouthfeel is dry, smooth, unfortunately a bit flat. Overall, not bad. Better than I remembered -- it's been years and years since I had this."
""
""
"Pours a dark ruby red, almost brown, with a good head and lacing. The nose is dark fruit (plums, raisins), caramel and toffee against a sweet biscuit background. As it warms, prunes are at the forefront. Full medium body with a nice smooth texture that approaches slick. The carbonation level is low normal. The flavor profile is complex and well balanced. It begins with dark fruit, progresses to toffee/caramel and ends with a rich toasty sweetness. The finish is smooth with a nice burst of sweetness and a slight tingle of alcohol at the back of the throat. An outstanding doppelbock."

"o: My favorite dopplebock by far and I've tried many German and most American versions. That being said I like the carmel, sweet, bread like finish personally. This is a fridge beer(let it warm before drinking of course) for me. Easy to drink, high alcohol per volume but you would never know it."
""
"Overall: Awesome doppelbock. Doesn't get any better than from a German brewery. Definitely having a few more tonight"
""

"A staple beer at a great price point try it!"

"Overall- Spaten really did a great job with this beer. Price point is right on at $15.99 USD for a 12-pack that really hides a high ABV compared to most other beers. This doppelbock is fantastic in the middle of winter thanks to the warming alcohol content but refreshing enough to be drank on the hottest days of summer. When in doubt in my local beer store, I always turn to Spaten’s Optimator."
""
""
""
"Gave it a Euro-pour right down the middle of the glass. Built a tall, beige head. Real, rich brown color. Less than average lace after sipping. Aroma was that sweet, malty smell you'd expect from a doppel. Flavor was the same. Definitely sweet, no bitter hop flavor...plum or raisin notes, maybe? I could barely pick up the higher alcohol content. Carbonation was less than average and mouthfeel was decent. The viscosity was medium and not a long aftertaste. This is a classic version of the style. Shouldn't disappoint most that are looking to sample a decent doppelbock."
""
""
""
"o: A fine quality and tasty dopplebock, although the prune flavor eventually becomes a bit cloying."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer. It is a bit too sweet for my taste, but with the higher finishing gravity associated with a doppelbock, that is to be expected. I would like to see a little more bitterness or a bit more attenuation to balance the sweetness and dry it out just a tiny bit. Otherwise it's a well done brew."
""
""
"Overall: Very pleasant beer all-around. For all you seasonal beer-drinkers out there, this might not be your first choice while lounging at the beach or by the pool, but you can't beat sitting by the fire with a glass of this stuff in hand on a crisp autumn day. The flavor and the mouthfeel are this beer's strong points, if we're looking at it from an overall experience standpoint. With its roasty caramel notes, finished up by its sweet breadiness, this beer is one of the smoother dark beers out there."
"Manifestation-^@^- it manifested like nothing. It's flat not complexed and finished as it started. Basic with slight hop. I pour it down the drain. Looked pretty brown kinda frothy. Not like the Nigeria but like irish creme beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"I really enjoyed this, so much so that later that night I ordered another one. They were $4 a pop. Try it."

"Overall, a nice doppelbock, but it seems to have a slight skunky flavor to it. It might be the green bottle playing tricks on my mind. Pretty solid offering."
"Beautiful garnet hue, dark and clear, quickly fading head but persistent carbonation. Slim lacing. Aroma is bready, with toasty sweet caramelization and dark fruits. Taste is full and follows aroma with good roast and nuances of earth and spice. Very smooth, very malty; simple but pleasant. Definitely worth having especially given it's availability and cost..."

"O: I'm generally a fan of thicker and heavier doppelbocks (Ayinger immediately comes to mind), and this one fits that description. Holds up well with age and is under $9 for a 6-pack so it's definitely well worth a buy"
""
""
"Overall: An excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a heavier beer but not so heavy that you can only drink one. It's going to be added to my regular rotation."
"O: Very, very good doppelbock, not great, missing a little something in the flavor that I cannot pinpoint, it has several of the hints of taste that I like about the style but leaves a slightly bland aftertaste however"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wasn't a huge fan of this beer but I've only had a couple of dopplebocks so maybe I'll appreciate it more when I've expanded my pallet a bit. Prefer something with a lower ABV and less sour/bitter notes. Again, possible this particular beer was skunked."
""
""
""

"O - This is a nice beer. It has pleasant flavours and is kind to the wallet while being generous yet discreet with its abv. Don't expect too much and you'll enjoy this brew."

"I would consider this as a good couch sitting beer."
""
""
" The taste has some malty presence with some moderately toasted munich and caramel malt sweetness with some nutty flavor with creaminess from the yeast. The flavor is more sweet than anything with gentle spice in the background. Overall this is a pretty drinkable bock, not too strong but still might not have multiples since it is on the sweet side. Not a very complex beer but fits the style well enough"

"Started out with some sweet maltiness, finshed with some acedic hoppiness, while the 7.6% ABV creates a warming effect."
"Once again the doppel bock comes thru. Tired of watery and hoppy taps at the local steak house, I ordered a doppel bock.  It might have been the fantastic food and company that set off the evening - but it was the beer that made the night spectacular."

"Pleasing malty and sweet aroma. Minimal carbination and head. Taste was good, strong malt, sweet, caramel and maybe a trace of chocolate, long finish with some alcohol to me. My first experience with a Dopplebock, looking forward to comparing to other dark lagers and ales to pick a group of favorites. At this point, this may be a little on the too sweet side for me, but, still enjoyed the beer, and especially the smell. Agree with other comments about the green bottle - why put a good beer in a clear or green bottle?"

"This is one of my favorite classic German beers. This is a very decent, full bodied, flavorful, reddish amber beer with a good sweet, roasted grain smell. A roasted malt flavor with some hops in the aftertaste. Has a fair amount of head to it that dissipates almost immediately. Some toasted grains on the aftertaste so a little bitterness as the aftertaste with a hint of some grapefruit. A dry finish which would go good with any good meal."

"Overall: I can't help but think this must be great on tap. Why do German brewers use green bottles?"
""
"Overall this is an exceptional beer in my book. Why they risk putting it in a green bottle I have no clue. It may be too sweet for some, but that is the style. I like it a lot and if I were to detract any points it would be for the very faint head. I give it a solid 4 out of 5, maybe one notch higher. I am not happy about the ownership of the brewery and that destroys any chance of me buying it again."

""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/9/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, raisin, apple, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, floral, brown sugar, light roasted malt, and earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity esters. Taste of caramel, raisin, apple, molasses, toffee, brown bread, toast, brown sugar, light floral, light roasted malt, and earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, molasses, toffee, brown bread, toast, and light roast on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent doppelbock. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"Good balance of coffee and caramel notes, and not very heavy for 7.6 % ABV. Balanced well with the hops also, you really can't taste the hop character to much. Bocks seem to have a sweeter quality then a Porter ...(which I would probably get confused during a blind folded taste test) ..and this one works it well that way."
"The Verdict: Not bad. It’s nowhere near the best doppelbock I’ve had, but I enjoyed it. Plenty of chocolaty goodness, this would pair perfectly with a chunk of gourmet cheese."

"Poured this Doppelbock from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a dark brown color, produced an average tan head, nice retention and nice lacing. The aroma of this ale consists of toasted malt, caramel and white pepper. Medium in body, the ale contains a foundation of malted grain, sweet caramel, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate and earthy hops. Nice example. of the style, not outstanding but it is worth a shot."

"Wow. I forgot I had this in my fridge, and I forgot what it tasted like. Too bad. I just opened this up and it all came back. Delicious, thick, refreshing, and now that I've finished the one bottle at 7.6% ABV, I'm a little buzzed too. Definitely remembering to buy more."
""
"O: While I have to knock off some merits for the green bottle, this is a remarkably good brew from a macro brewery that needs to be shipped across the ocean to reach me. I'm glad to see one of my gateway beers actually tastes better now that I'm a bit more knowledgable."

" Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu Spaten Optimator ---3/5"
"First off, this beer has an awesome color--dark amber. Green bottle is followed naturally by a skunky aroma. Taste matches the smell. Mouthfeel isn't that bad apart from taste. Our sample may be old or spoiled since our review differs so much and if this beer knew our opinion it'd be embarrassed."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pilsener glass. Dark amber/garnet, clear with lots of visible carbonation. Thick off-white head dissipates after a bit, not leaving any lacing yet. Smell is sweet malts all over. Taste is smooth, sweet malts up front, finishing sticky-sweet with hot alcohol on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is slick and full-bodied. Even if this is a macrobrew in its home country, it still blows American macros out of the water."

"12oz bottle. Pours dark read with a long lasting, thick, off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of toffee, bread crust, cherry and hint of noble hops. Body is full and slightly crisp. Caramel malt, grain, noble hops and alcohol fill the mouth. Long drying finish. Outstanding bock."
""
""
""
""
"Dark copper color when held to the light with a tan head that dissipates quickly into a sticky lace. Smells of caramel, toasted malt and some spicy alcohol fumes. Big, viscous body with light carbonation. Taste of toasted, bready malt, caramel and a grainy, cereal-like flavor. A light dose of alcohol and hop flavor in the finish. Not as sweet as a Paulaner Salvator and not as hoppy as Ayinger Celebrator; somewhere in between. One of the better doppelbocks I’ve tried, and one of the lesser expensive ones."

"Spaten Optimator is a dark brown malt beer with hints of red. Full-bodied nutty taste.A strong malt taste, very low in hops. This beer also has a hint of caramel. The overall aftertaste is strong but not bitter, and definitely not fruity. Very affordable, especially if you want a beer with a strong taste."

"OPINION: coming back to this for the first time in years, it's not what i expected nor recall - but it's got all the technically-correct nuances of a model doppelbock - drinkable in quantity despite the finish being a lil too hot and floral (leads me to think the ferment was rushed or something) - this example speaks to me as a regular, traditional bock with the presence of additional alcohol - maybe they just brewed a regular bock and added extra ethanol - don't know why anybody would do that though...."
"Overall: Very nice beer. Wouldn't sit down and drink two or three in a row, but would definitely purchase this again and recommend. Warms up an empty stomach."
""
"O: Nice well rounded doppelbock that improves once warmed. I really want to try this on tap."
"overall, has always been one of my all time favorites. all time. kind of like coming home again, ya know? love the style. love the brewery (even if it is very commercial). love the beer. this is what i think of when i think of a good german brew. not bitter, not tart. if anything, guilty of being sweeter than most might prefer, but i like my sweets. i thought twice about the three 5's. and this IS my first beer of the evening (afternoon?), so i'm not yet buzzed. i love this beer."
""
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a small off-white head. Smell is a bit nutty with caramel, dark fruit and sweet malts - actually quite nice, smells a bit quad-like. Flavor has a lot of the same characteristics as the nose, but it doesn't all come together quite as well as I would've liked. The flavors all come together nicely on the front end, but it gets this strange bitter/alcohol thing on the finish which lingers. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, but a little on the thin side for the style, could use a little more heft. Overall, this is a decent doppelbock, but not a great one. I wish the flavors came together a little better, but it's certainly drinkable."
""
"Not perfect, but likable, and I think deserving of a better score than I see here on this site. I do suspect this beer might be noticeably improved on draft, where (with luck and hope) the flavors would be brought forward more."
""
"Overall-This beer is good for a chilly autumn evening. It is not sessionable in my book, but it is good if you want a dark beer. If you're in the mood for a malty/molasses brew with a sweet aftertaste, this brew's for you!"

"O - Great looking beer but lacked some malt aromas I expect. The taste of the malt seemed to be one-dimensional (the same taste throughout)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good doppelbock. Just a pleasure to drink. It's different too, which is nice. The malt play a very unique roll that is not overwhelming as in many others, but is still commanding (I'm only giving the overall a 4 because I hesitate to give this beer a 4.5. It is so so good, but 90% and above is reserved for royalty)."
"M: Medium body, low carbonation."

"O - All the rich character of a fortified wine like port that gets bolder as it warms. Sweet and filling, a bread of a beer. A very enjoyable glass from start to finish."

"O/D-Flavor trumps all; and here the flavor was the highlight of the beer. I enjoyed this brew more and more after every sip. My final verdict: its no Hooker Liberator, and it surely ain't no Celebrator, but its a nice import Doppelbock. A single 12 oz is enough for me."

"I love the brown, almost blood-red color of this one when it's poured into a glass. The malts are extremely prominent: rich and toasty, with caramel and molasses overtones, and a hint of dark, brown bread on the finish. A moderate carbonation level doesn't quite eclipse the dash of bitter that sets off the malty sweetness very nicely. It's very very assertive, but not cloying in terms of sweetness. A hearty, solid German-style beer; a little too strong for a session beer, but a couple of 'em will weigh you down very nicely."

"Review from 4/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a dark reddish brown, light tan head and lacing. Strong pleasant aroma of sweet malt, caramel. Moderately sweet, malty start and middle. Pleasant malt and caramel finish. Seems muted in flavor, but well balanced and quite nice. A definite buy again."
""
""
""
"Overall - A good doppelbock from Spaten. Not quite on the level of Ayinger Celebrator, but it might be more session friendly."
"Poured a transparent black, With a one finger head, Looks like a glass of Pepsi. the smell is of dark cherries, Cranberry fig newtons, And blueberries. Alright I guess, though I prefer nothing but the blueberries. the taste follows the smell, Except the cherry flavoring comes through a wee bit more. The mouthfeel matches both of the previous, And nothing else come's through. The beer was a large disappointment, Considering how highly my father and brother had talked about it"

"As far as the taste goes, I'm definitely tasting toffee, plums, and a hint of wheat. It's certainly the kind of beer I would recommend to someone who likes dark German beer, but doesn't care for Beck's."
""
""
""
""
"Doppels aren't everyone's cup of tea. Or, uh, beer. Sweet, malty, the polar opposite of an IPA. But if you want a good, strongish, clean German lager, it's hard to beat this."

"Overall - I was expecting more from Optimator, in terms of flavor and smell. Had the aftertaste not been so dry and ashy, I would've been more impressed."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty decent beer. The flavor is solid, but the bitter finish doesn't mesh well with the rest of the profile. The nose is also pretty decent, but it has that traditional euro musty note. Overall, it's definitely worth checking out"
""
""
"Overall: This is a nice beer but a little less spicey than I like for the style. Still a good beer to have routinely."
""
""
"Overall a pretty enjoyable beer with a high abv. The abv is hidden slightly but the taste and nose definitely contain some alcohol. Not the best dopplebock I've ever had but is reasonably easy to find."

""
""
""
""
"Is there better versions of this style... yes. But, I have always enjoyed any brew from Spaten. And this classic brand of doppelbock is no different."
""
"A light khaki head with a dark ice tea color brew. Spots of lace here and there and nice retention. Smell is caramel and toffee with buttery notes. Lots of toasted grains with a light roasted coffee. Taste follows suit with molasses and warm brown toast. Very nice roasted grain malt body. Sweet caramel as well. Hops are dry and nicely bitter with a light herbal flourish in the crisp finish. A touch of leafy oiliness lingers stretching it out a bit. Feel is a bit light but nicely weighted with a decent amount of heft and a smooth light creaminess in the back of the overall crisp feel. A nice Lenten beer and a good version of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Recommendation: Not hard to drink easy to enjoy and appreciate. Have one or have six at 7.25% Vol. Its easy to enjoy in a bottle or on tap."
""
""
""
""
"O-this is one of the least drinkable german beers that i've had. something about it doesn't sir right with me. its fairly harsh and seems to be very off balanced. i think the molasses syrupy taste to it is just too much."
""
""
"O- I love Optimator, great year round beer. Tasty full of flavor reasonably priced and always available."
"Dark brown in color with deep red hues when held to the light. The head is a thick light brown foam with a frothiness to it. Retention is excellent and lacing is decent. The nose is very sweet. Lots of light toasted malts, maple syrup, caramel, and brown sugar in the aroma. Still there is an upfront brown sugar sweetness only this time with a more pronounced toasted grain character. Hops balance through the middle and take it to a bitter/sweet finish. Full bodied and soft on the palate. Carbonation is done right and feels refined. Extremely tasty, affordable, and available. This one is worthy."
"O: Pretty av erage brew, doesn't make you say ""wow!"" more like ""eh not bad"" so it gets an ""eh not bad"" 3.0 overall."
"I tried this beer at a german pub in South Carolina and i thought it was great. I had two 16oz. glasses,the smell was nice with a variety of aromas pretty typical for the style. A touch of molasses and a lot of sweet malt.The taste is delicious and addicting. .A fantastic Doppelbock, I'm definitely going back for some more!"

"Really good one. Not my favorite overall, but nails the classic flavors in a good, basic way - not super complex. Definitely recommend over most attempts."
"This is a solid Doppelbock, with all of the attributes typical to the style. Malty, with toasted, caramel, and bready aspects. This is worth a try, and I bet it would be good with food."
"The first traditional Doppelbock I ever tasted (back in the day, I mean). I loved it then, and it's still pretty decent now. Prefer other Germans to this one, and even a few American examples. Still a good beer, and cheap. 3.5"

"It's a delicious beer. I picked up a six-pack for the night from the local Southampton ""The Beer Store"" for $12 and expected nothing big. I was pleasantly surprised by a nuanced yet familiar doppelbock taste with that delicious warming effect so great on a Winter night. Too bad it's a balmy 62 in PA right now."

"A solid choice for a malty spring Dopplebock. This is widely available and priced right. Super malty and rough enough around the edges to keep it interesting."

"Haven’t had a doppelbock since München in September and this brings me back. Hits the spot."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 1 pint 0.9 ounce bottle into a 22 ounce brandy snifter. Pours dark brown with a dissipating tan head that leaves some lacing. The smell is of sweet dark roasted malts and a bit of caramel. There's maybe a bit of fig in the smell. The taste is of lightly sweet malt, fig, caramel, a little bit of bitterness on the back end. It's not cloyingly sweet and the ABV is not noticeable. The mouthfeel is full and the flavors linger in the mouth, but it is very pleasant. The carbonation is well done. Overall, this is an excellent beer and is still one of my favorites."

""

"O - A little less substantial than I was expecting after some other recent German doppelbocks, but still decent and nice."

""

"O: A fantastic Doppelbock, I'm definitely going back for some more!"

""

"A very nice, somewhat ticker beer. The beer pours a nice golden brown hue with a steady amount of carbonation and lace. The aroma is of lighter fruits and grains. The beer tastes the same, with a hint of molasses and caramel in the mix, without the burn. Leaves an okay aftertaste after each swig and goes down relatively smooth for being a tad bit bitter. Not a bad effort, I would recommend."
"Deep red in color with orange and brown hues and perfect clarity. Poured with a thick off-white foam that quickly dissipated. Delicate, smooth, oily feel. Sweet caramel and toasted malts with dark fruit aromas, with bready and biscuit undertones. Flavors are much the same as aromas. Caramel and toasted malts with dark fruit through the front and middle, a bit of hop bitterness is introduced thru the middle, finishes very cleanly. Generally, very sweet, malty and very enjoyable."

"O: it's a good beer, can't drink very many with the high-ish ABV. It's nice to have and sip with dinner... Or lunch as I did."
"Pairs well with a heavy, dark cigar. Enjoyed it with a JFR 770 LE and together, they were magic."
"Overall – Very drinkable and enjoyable. A classic dopplebock in my opinion."
""
"O – A solid, if not spectacular double bock. I enjoyed it and I would drink it again, but not up there with the best I have had."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I don't think this beer works for me very well. Too much molassas/caremel and boozy flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent lager that is very malty. I've really found myself enjoying dark lagers lately and this one is exceptional. Surprisingly drinkable and hides its slcohol well. Only thing that bothers me at all is the sharp, metallic mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"O: Ayinger Clelebrator is my most favorite Doppelbock and it is hard not to compare the Optimator to that beer. But I did enjoy it and would drink it. I will call it the little brother to Celebrator."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I know they aren't exactly in the same category, but i'm a bit of a noob, so i'll go there. I'll take this over Newcastle any day. This beer lives up to it's name, I feel optimized."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is my standard for what a double bock should be. Delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a classic German Doppelbock that everyone should try. A very good example of the style."
"Enjoyed for the first time at a party. Have always enjoyed offerings from Spaten in the past. Pours a caramel color, not much head. smells of bread or brown bread, toasted. Malty, and even sweet. Taste is much the same, bready, biscuity, malty, brown sugar or molasses sweetness. Mouthfeel was o bit too syrupy for my liking, but that did not deter my drinking and liking the overall product. Will drink this again."
"meh.. its good. it meets all the checkmarks for the style, but perhaps is a bit too grainy for my liking."
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a light brownish red, with a half inch of off white head, and little lace. Smell brown sugar, raisins, bread, and clove. Taste is all of them combined, nothing really dominates, but very sweet. Body is thinner than I prefer, not much carbonation, not overly dry, and easy drinking. This is not my favorite style being a hop head. Wish it was less sweet and fuller."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark amber brown, tan head with good retention. Smelled roasted malts, dark fruits, a little alcohol. Can definitely taste some the dark fruits, roasted, carmels, brown sugars, very slight alcohol. Mouthfeel is heavy, smooth, and velvety. A good doppelbock; one I recommend for sure. Definitely better if you can get it on tap."
"O: A solid German doppelbock and one that I've had quite a few times. This was one of the first high alcohol craft beers that I really remember enjoying."
""
""
""
"Overall: I wish I could get this fresh. This is a good beer I can tell but age has taken its toll. Its too bad American breweries cannot produce top quality doppelbocks at this price."
""
"O: Pretty good beer, seems to fit the style well, but not my favorite. Wouldn't have a problem drinking it again."
"Overall: a classic doppelbock with, perhaps a shade too much alcohol presence in the taste, but not so overbearing as to be a real detriment. There's no reason to not grab one any time you're in the mood for a German doppel..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is quite good beer, and at 7.6% ABV, decently alcoholic, but the alcohol well hidden by the sugary malts. The beer is well-balanced in the sugars, and while it does lack a distinctive hop quality, this is more than made up for by an excellent and varied grain selection. Well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm a bit conflicted on this one. I like the way it tastes, but I don't like the skunk profile I get on the nose. Eh, what the hell, give it a shot, it's decently priced for a rather big beer. This is a style I'll need to get a better grip on in the future to see if it's really up my alley."
"Overall: Not world class by any means, but Optimator is a great beer. If you're a fan of the style, give it a try. If not go ahead and try it anyway. I would say that it is much better on tap (what beer isnt) but still excellent out of the bottle."

"This beer pours a deep and dark reddish brown that is rich in both aroma and appearance. The head on this beer lingered for quite a while. The aroma of this beer is extremely sweet molasses like scents with a touch of husky grain and some plum. The beer is intensely delicious with flavors of burnt sugars and grain with a heavy dose of molasses. The finish is slightly bitter but almost overpowered by the sugary sweet raisin and fruit flavors. There is a lingering taste that is almost how a cigarette leaves your mouth. It is a mildly stale and burnt taste. The mouthfeel is heavy and thick and a little chewy which is exactly what I want for this type of beer. Overall this is a really good Doppelbock and a beer I could enjoy any time."

"D - A good beer within the style, but I think it lacks character. I'd have it again, but certainly not a go-to."

"O: I'm not a lager drinker, and I wouldn't buy this again. That said, I could certainly see myself downing one or two after a long day of skiing. A solid winter lager."

"12 oz bottle poured into a glass mug. This pour produced a good 2-1/2 to 3 finger head that rapidly dissipated but left a reasonable amount of lacing. The color was an extremely dark amber for a Doppelbock. The low carbination made a very smooth taste and mouthfeel with no lingering aftertaste. A little weak for my taste, but still a good dopplebock. I would recommend this beer and buy it again myself."

"O- while it's not on the same level as Ayinger Celebrator, it's also half the price. A very good basic introduction to the style for those who haven't enjoyed a doppelbock before."
"Notes: nice, decent, affordable. The alcohol is so well hidden that it is easy to forget that this beer has a big abv. This is a good winter everyday beer."
"Cheers!!"
"M: Nice and pleasant sensation balanced and with character of a doppelbock just as needed for the style."
"Overall it's interesting but I'd not seek it out too often."
"Overall Impression- Like many times with the nose in a great brew, I keep going back to it over and over. With this one, the taste was so great that my glass became empty quicker then usual. A great doppelbock and for the price, cannot beat! I will gladly be keeping 1-2 of these in my fridge at all times to throw a style at friends that they've never had before."
"This is probably the darkest german beer i have ever had. I liked it a lot, but I personally prefer the paulaner salvator because its a bit more smooth to me. This beer is great and if you think the darker the better, this could be your favorite beer and I would highly recommend it."
"Overall - A really nice beer, but just not up my alley. I would recommend it though and will probably buy it again for certain occasions. I think it would go great with a steak or meaty dinner."
"O - I found this tough to drink in a quiet setting, since the only times I have had this beer is at Biergartens. Still a very good beer though."
"Clear mahogany brown and only a slight amount of head that vanishes quickly. No bubbles in site after a minute or two. Light nose with only faint aromas of nutty toasted malts. Some fruitiness and alcohol as well. Flavor is rich sweetness and dark bakers chocolate. Finishes with a dark fruity and alcohol burn in the nose. Sweet candied tingle on the tongue at first but as the beer warms the alcohol because extremely present and almost pungent after you swallow. Thick and smooth body but that changes towards the end of the glass."
"O - overall, a very nice beer. My first foray into the style and I enjoyed. Highly drinkable (watch that ABV!) but still complex and very interesting. I'll be coming back to this."
"A very enjoyable drink."
"Overall, this is a very rich, restrained beer. I'm not a huge a fan of the style, usually, but this was excellent."
"A deep brown almost black with red highlights to the body,relatively small white head that did not last long.Tasted very much of dark fruitcake!(Nice)a hint of clove perhaps? The alchohol is well hidden."
"O - Really enjoyed it, the alcholol was well hidden, smelled and tasted good for the style, rich & deep. Not as good as some other dopplebocks I've had, but a strong representation none the less."
"Overall, a hearty doppelbock that delivers."
"days, though...I would probably pick something else before this one. Fun to revisit nonetheless & should be tried by all."
"I tried this one on the recommendation of a Schnauzer, and was not disappointed. It now ranks in my top 5 favorite beers."
"Overall: I like this beer. My only complaint is the lack of intensity in aroma, but the aroma itself is good. I like the taste very much, and the mouthfeel and appearance are pretty good too. I will buy this again. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall this beer is amazing. I drink the beer and it just makes me feel happy that such a huge company can make such a quality beer. I will for sure buy this beer again."
"Overall: If a BMC drinker likes Guiness, they might like this one. This is certainly a heavier beer than Guiness, but it is not too far away on the flavor spectrum. A solid offering, maybe not world class, even though it has been around for a ling time."
"Overall: This is a nice beer to drink in the fall. Quite malty. I would have liked a little bit less grape flavor."
"It looks fantastic, but 'tain't."
"$12.99 for a twelve pack in Atlanta, GA."
"Overall this is a very well rounded beer. I like the strength and complexity of the flavors. It will stand up well to strong food pairings."
"Notes: If you like malt...which I do, you will love this beer. Really nicely balanced. A stellar brew."
"O - Overall this a good stuff. Has enough bite for me, and is tasty as well. This is one of my favorite Germans. Its right on key with what I expected out of it."
"This stuff isn't too bad. A little rough around the edges and could use a bit more complexity. Descent drinking nonetheless."
"Overall: Great example of a Doppelbock that manages to have a sweet malty taste while also maintaining a fairly dry and spicy palate. Not quite top tier, but well above average."
"O) I really enjoyed this beer. Strong taste, nice malted hop flavor, would definitely buy again."
"No foam. This beer is potent - the sensation to compare the mouthfeel to is after getting shot up with novocaine at the dentist's office. I got two sixers today and am going to get hammered tonight."
"O) The double shovel is tasty, and almost always means good times are around the bend. As my uncle says, let's get Optimated!!!!"
"This beer poured dark and without any head to speak of. This beer didn't have a very distinct taste or smell to me - the aroma was a little malty, with a sharp afterthought that didn't translate to the taste. It wasn't offensive, and it was very drinkable, but it won't go on my list of favorites."
"Overall: One of the best doppelbocks I've tried. Rich, really classy. I'll be seeing this little beverage a lot in my future. Bravo!"
"Some viscosity balanced by quick, sharp bubbles of carbonation. This beer is highlighted by crisp, clear and concise flavors."
"O: A solid doppelbock, tasty and quite drinkable, widely available and reasonably priced. Not my top pick, but one I would likely buy again."
"I like this beer. It didn't blow my mind, but it was thoroughly enjoyable and despite approaching 8% it's very drinkable."
"It's dark and somewhat hoppy. The malt is dark and in your face. It's a well balanced doppelbock. I am having it for a repeat and will repeat again."
"It is a great German beer."
"Smooth in the mouth and easygoing in flavor, Optimator’s a doppelbock you can drink easily but rewards deeper pondering as well. It’s best enjoyed when sitting in front of a fireplace in the dark."
"D/O- This is the second time I've ever had this (the first being last summer) and its just as pleasing as I remember it. A solid, if not leader or flagship of the style, example. A great way to start off Dopplebockfest 2011 with fdkayti."
"Overall: A beer I wouldn't mind having for breakfast or after a good meal for desert. This is a great example of how beer can be bread in liquid form, and is an instant classic for that matter."
"Overall mouthfeel is pretty good but I would prefer a richer head. Other doppels that I enjoyed had a nice thick head that lasted throughout the beer. This critique is rather minor for this beer though. A good doppel for those who like the style. Little on the lighter side but still some nice flavors."
"This is a good, solid doppelbock - sticky, sweet, but not cloying. Smooth mouthfeel."
"one of my favorit beers of all time when its on tap, and is still pretty great out of a bottle"
"Clear medium brown body, some visible effervescence, white head, medium dissipation with decent lacing. Classic doppelbock nose, prunes, raisins, burnt brown sugar, molasses, floral hops. Mouthfeel very full, meal replacement indeed, a bit sticky, alcohol a bit noticeable. While not as full flavored as Celebrator, certainly a classic example of the style."
"Overall: Not particularly offensive (although the heat's a bit annoying at this level) but this is definitely forgettable."
"D: The alcohol's concealed very well, but it's pretty heavy and a little sweet for a multi-bottle outing."
"A tasty not too big dopplebock, should definitely be tried."
"I'm not a huge lager guy but I enjoyed this. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate them, but I'm an ale man at heart. That being said, this was a good beer."
"Pours a dark ruby color, dark head, huge bubbles. Almost like coca cola! Nutty aroma, smooth crisp taste. Slightly bitter but pleasing finish. Good drinkability for this type of beer which normally is not my favorite."
"The beer is dark brown/black with a thin head. The smell is slightly skunky, liquorice, fennel, rye bread. The taste is sweet with plum and caramel. It is rich and malty with a pleasant malted milk shake aftertaste. 7.5% wow, where? How could you not love this beer?"
"M: Medium-full bodied beer, that is very creamy, the carbonation is really nice on this one. Clears your palate at the end, leaving a somewhat wet finish."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy even when served at fridge temp. Impressive."
"T: Not a beer for the weak of heart. Freshly baked rye bread all over with some brown sugar, figs, raisin and some yeast. Syrupy mouthfeel is perfect for the taste."
"This isn't the best doppelbock out there, but it's a really good one. And the fact that it's not priced like a specialty beer at all--cheaper than good American crafts around here--make this a go-to of the style."
"T: It's a good beer, and for $1.99 for a 16oz. bottle will pick one up again."
"O: You forget that lagers can be thick and chew just like some of the bigger stouts and barleywines out there. I'm really digging this one its a nice reprieve from all the summer beers I've been drinking of late. Its also a nice reminder that Germans still make good beer."
"Overall: Spaten knows what it's doing. And for the relatively inexpensive price (cheaper than a Celebrator), it's a pretty good value. Those who appreciate the genre should definitely try it."
"O: I liked this one, a solid doppelbock."
"O=I simply did not enjoy this beer as much as others and will likely not try again."
"Pours an impenetrably dark brown with a small white head with decent retention. Aromas promise sweet flavors to come. My nose picks up a lot of dark fruit like raisins, dates, and prunes, with a molasses like sweetness. Tastewise, I love that this doppelbock avoids the trap of cloying qualities. There's nothing over the top about its taste and yet it thoroughly delivers on every nose hint. Its subdued and subtle character make it far more drinkable than most members of its style. A benchmark of its type."
"A tasty, toasty German bock. Poured a hazel-brown with reddish highlights, moderate carbonation, and a thin off-white head. Mild and smooth aroma of sweet, toasty malts and caramel. More sweet toasted malts in the taste, toffee, raisin, and apple peel. Maybe just a hint of alcohol. Medium mouthfeel, and pretty easily drinkable."
"O: I didn't like it as much as everyone else apparently. It seems to have a little bit of skunk to it."
"Very delicious dark, thick, full beer. Oddly atypical for a German Brewery - they are most famous for their strong weiss beers and mid-range dark beers. This is a roasty, malty and slightly sweet brew full of rich carmel notes and coffee hints. I had this in a pint at ""Wolfe's Beirgarden"" in Albany NY. Served non-ice-cold was best and this is definitely a higher-end leisurely drinking beer to enjoy with some wurst and spatzel...delicious!!"
"It’s an interesting and unique profile that works very well together. A very unique and adventurous brew."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking brown color with some shades of red in it. The head in a bit fizzy and white not leaving much on the glass after each sip. The smell of the beer has a very nice malt back bone to it with a light sweetness coming though. The taste of the beer brings the malts onto the tongue full force and really leaves a good pleasing flavor in your mouth. Theres a bit of brown sugar in the flavor too with a pretty good bitterness in the end. The mouthfeel isn't heavy but just about medium. Overall I think that this is probably my favorite from Spaten, the Oktoberfest being second."
"Dark ruby, brownish color. One finger head with just a bit of lacing. There is some nice persistent bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass, almost like sparkling wine. Aroma is dark caramel, maybe toffee? grains, and an herbal note. Flavor is much the same, with a bit of a coffee finish, lighter though, like drip coffee. This beer has a really pleasant creamy mouthfeel. Overall I thought this was a nice, affordable example of the style, even though not top in the category."
"Doppelbock is a style that's been brewed for hundreds of years; it's an incredible relic of German brewing tradition. While I, personally, feel that Ayinger Celebrator is the epitome of the style, I must insist that there exists few (especially among German brewed) examples that don't exemplify its rich, gratifying wonders. Optimator certainly does."
"Still sittin' at the Brauhaus, watching the Cubs tank another game. Sad, really. Anyway, this brew pours a clear dark sunset burnt sienna-amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises buttery caramel, very light roasted malts, brown sugar, and Belgian candi sugar. The taste holds notes of buttery caramel, light roasted malts, brown sugar, cinnamon, faint-ish dark greens, and some mild cocoa powder. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a solid d-bock, a bit on the thin side, but mighty tasty and enjoyable."
"O - Very good beer, recommended to try at least once if not more."
"Overall a wonferfull beer. Was really impressed with the drink-ability. I love a good dopplebock and this one is nice and unique."
"It is a great German beer."
"Tasty, but a slow sipper."
"Pours dark brown color, caramel perhaps, with light tan head. Nose is bready with very traditional doppelbock character. Palate is light flavored and bodied compared to other doppelbocks, good malt core with light roasty and brown sugar like flavors. Faint hopping for balance. Smooth. Easy drinking. What a refreshing doppelbock!"
"I wasn't expecting to like this as much. It grows on you if you like the sweet malty style. But I would say there are more interesting examples of Doppelbocks, including American-made versions, but for a widely-distributed major beer that actually makes the boat trip, it's a winner."
"Bottom line; this is why we don't put beers in green bottles! I'm sure this import version isn't as good as the real deal in Deutschland, and the fact that it made a long journey a long time ago makes this particular example a disappointment. I'll be keeping an eye out for a fresher version."
"O: Hard to rate this beer as it did have some good flavors, but it also had some bad ones."
"A medium body and prickly carbonation make for a decent combination in terms of mouthfeel, but I just dislike the dry finish combined with the sweetness in the taste. Drinkability is ok, but held back by the finish and alcohol - both the taste and abv components."
"D: Good drinkability, it's a nice, filling beer."
"Overall-I want to leave room for improvement right now because I have a special bond with this beer, and with all the dopplebock talk lately I wanted to grab this and a Salvator(which I may drink next). But for the price, this beer is outstanding and highly underrated."
"Overall this isn't a bad beer, its kind of enjoyable but there is nothing about it that really stands out to much."
"O: This is a supremely elegant and sublime example of the Doppelbock category. Required tasting for any Doppelbock Kenner."
"Overall a good beer that has nice flavor and good looks. I really enjoy the combination of really dark beer That is more sweet than roasty. Nice and a good representative of the style"
"Overall / Drinkability: Overall a solidly good beer. Quite dangerous in that I finished this off in no time, and I wouldn't mind having another. Great by itself and good with a meal (ham steaks an Mac n' Cheese in this case) and I would definitely have it again."
"This beer pours almost black with some red showing through. The aroma is chocolate, anise, and roasted malt. It's flavor begins with chocolate with molasses, coffee, and finishes with dark chocolate, very well balanced. It's mouthfeel is medium-full. Spaten Optimator is a very good beer, filling yet satisfying. A good representation of the style. Highly recommended!"
"The Rest: Full, fairly creamy body with decent balance, this beer has the bitterness to support what could have been an overly sweet beer. Pretty tasty."
"It poured a very dark brown brown that was barely clear with about a centimeter tan head that quickly reduce to a millimeter. it smelled of sweet roasted malts, cat food, and a tiny bit like chocolate. Tasted sweet, of roasted caramel malt, and a bit of chocolate. It has some hops to balance it and is also a bit sour. The sourness was unexpected. I suppose it's probably just part of the espresso flavour that's to be expected, but I could have done with a little less of it. It was a very nice creamy roasted malt experience. Had a tiny bit of that cat food flavour that I smelled more prominently on the nose, but it had a nice array of malt flavours to cover it up and make for a delicious experience."
"At $8.99 a six pack this is a great go to beer for any occasion. It always seems to have a place in my fridge."
"A solid German example."
"Spaten Optimator is a copper brown lager with a thin khaki head that fades to a turbulent film and leaves nice lacing. It has a deep, malty aroma: bready and a bit sweet. It smells grainy and spicy with a hint of apple, perhaps. In the mouth, it's full bodied and a little sharp. The finish is a little sticky. It's pretty sweet and raisny, with notes of prune and maybe fig. It's very malty and bready. The finish has a hint of bitter juniper and alcohol. It's a sturdy drink, too hardy to session, but it's quite smooth."
"Overall, this is not a classic like Salvator, but it is a good example, good malt, good carbonation, enough bitterness to balance, but not show itself. Good beer. I'd kick back a few liter steins of this fine brew."
"Superb beer. I was honestly suprised. I've had other dopplebocks, but this is one that honestly brought me back to Munich. Highly recommended to drink this, if you're a fan of the style."
"Poured a dark brownish color with very little beige head on it. Smell is rich toffee malt. Taste is very heavy malt with quite a bit of alcohol coming through. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy from the malt. Overall a decent beer. I'm not a big fan but it's alright."
"For 2 bucks, a good beer."
"From the bottle. It pours dark mahogany brown with a thin head. The nose is rich and malty with understated hops - you can tell its a dopplebock. Very rich malty flavor. The hops are deeply buried. Rich malty taste to match the nose. Has a somewhat ""salty"" finish? I enjoyed it a lot."
"An excellent lager, very tasty and flavorful, a bit heavy for drinking a lot of, but shares a lot of flavors with the best of the dark Belgian styles of ales, interesting that you can get that level of flavor from a lager. Worth seeking out and I will hopefully have one again."
"D - its drinkable but strong and sweet. So its not something I would drink all night long but definitely something I get every time i'm at the german bar after a few pints of a nice pilsner."
"Warning this is an A.B.Inbev beer most people don't realize this! This is a very dark beer that has malt liquor listed on the label. It is moderately strong (7.2%) which an average beer drinker probably would not like. Has a strong grape / earthy after taste with a hint of what I like to call liquid smoke taste (roasts). Very sudsy with lacing (high sugar content) left on the inside of the bottle."
"Quite drinkable...an easy drinking, refreshing doppelbock...hides alcohol very well. I'd say this is a beer anyone could handle and go back to again."
"Pours a clear cola color with a nice 2 inch tan head. Thin ring lacing on the drink down. Smells of caramel malt, brown sugar, and maybe some apple peels. Taste is of caramel malt, plum/prune, slight cocoa powder. Slight hop bitterness after each sip. Good level of carbonation with a lighter body than I would have expected for this beer. Slight alcohol burn is present but doesn't detract from the beer. Good drinkability on this beer. I would love to have this at a German restaurant with some sausages and sauerkraut."
"D - I used to fear this in my Variety case and now its the most flavorful offering in it. Alcohol is there and well hidden. Best Doppelbock I ever had!"
"Sausages are delicious. No regrets."
"A good doppelbock, but not a great one. The flavor is good, but it lacks the complexity and awesomeness of some other doppelbocks. Solid, but definitely not my fav."
"This beer wont knock your socks off in terms of the seasoned beer drinker, but if your just getting into doppelbocks, please try this as well as Great Lakes' Doppelrock."
"Highly drinkable, perhaps more pairable with general foods than a barleywine, but not exceedingly unique...a bit of a glorified Budweiser-type lager in taste."
"Pours a dark brown, with a brown head. Has a medium-high level of carbonation, looks almost soda-like. Malty aroma, hints of dark fruit and roasted grain. To me it looks and smells like a porter, but thinner. Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected, but still pleasant. Moderate hop presence, mostly a malty taste, but also has a noticeable alcohol warmth to it. A tasty, mellow beer that isn't as bitter or ""strong"" as I expected, it is very drinkable for a 7.2% abv beer. As an imported macro brew I'm pretty impressed."
"My dad was in the Air Force and spent time in Germany and had this beer back in the 1960's, he said I had to try some, I am glad I did. This is a full body beer that will put you to sleep. If you are used to American beers be warned, this beer will put you to sleep."
"The body first hits the tongue in a violent wave of carbonation, which mellows out into an average, if slightly syrupy body. There is not an overly complex malt layout; there are definitely some toasted malts and wheat amidst a sweet, dark malt base. As the beer plays out in your mouth, raisin flavors emerge from beneath the malt and finish dryly on the tongue. Somewhere in the middle of each sip, there is a faint but present hop character, a fleeting freshness in the middle of a heap of malts. This isn't in the running for the world's best double bock, but the price is right, and it is a quality, drinkable imported beer."
"I really enjoyed this doppelbock. I am surprised at some of the low reviews that it gets. The ABV seems perfect for the brew and it pours a beautiful dark ruby/brown color. Smells of caramel, raisons, bread and rich fruit. Very little head, but I didn't give it much of a chance to get one. Drank it with some light apps and enjoyed it so much, had a second. Definitely will add this to my stash. Enjoy!"
"All around it was a good brew that remained just as good as it warmed up compared to when fresh from the reefer."
"M - smooth and creamy with a medium body and light carbonation."
"Pours ruby black with red tints if held up to the light. Decent sized cream colored head that dissolves slowly. Smells good, malty sweetness. Great taste. Malts, roasted without being burnt, and a slight hint of raisin sweetness. Creamy without being thick. A full, refreshing, smooth mouthfeel. Good level of carbonation. Fairly high alcohol content but you wouldn't know it. Very drinkable for this style. Could have several. A very good beer."
"D: an excellent doppelbock and the one I would pick out of the four on tap at my local beer bar I would pick first."
"From notes: Poured a dark, dirty brown with some amber notes. Aroma of sweet malt, wheat, caramel, and brown sugar. Not bursting with aroma. Flavor was pretty minerally, perhaps too much so initially. But that goes away. Caramel and brown sugar notes are very strong. Some vanilla and brea. Thin mouthfeel and a good drinkable beer."
"Has a mediocre drinkibility. This is a good tasting beer but has limited drinkibility because of carbonation and alcohol content."
"Drinkability: This is an easy beer to drink but it is pretty sweet with a strong dark fruit flavor. I could probably drink one more of these but not another. Not my favorite but I would drink again."
"D - yeah, it was ok, just ok."
"D: a damn good Dopplebock. I will definitely get this again."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with ruby hues around the edges. There is a small head which is slightly khaki and gives way to some lacing. The aroma is a little faint, there is some breadiness, dark fruits, and caramel malt. The taste is nice but not super complex, caramel malt some breadiness and a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is dry and moderately carbonated. The drinkability is above average it is a smooth easy drink, however it lacks some complexity to keep you really interested. The beer is solid."
"Drinkability - One of the best of this style. It doesn't have the ""wow"" factor of my favorite dopplebock, Bell's Consecrator, but this is pretty close to top-shelf stuff."
"Overall, I'm linking this beer. It's a good - traditional German bier. Prosit!"
"D: great drinkability; goes down easy"
"D- moderate to high"
"Poured from the bottle anice amber brown color with a rocky soft off white head that receded quickly and left a small ring that was fed by the carbonation. Smell was of sweet bready buscuity malt small amount of carmel and a hint of some dark fruit. Taste was smooth sweet dark buscuit and caramel malt small hint of hops. Mouthfeel is smooth with a very lively carbonation. Drinkability is wonderful such a nice sweet balanced malty dopplebock very sessionable."
"Drinkability - This beer would take some getting used to for me. It's nothing really bad. It's just different. I do love the color of this brew, but I personally don't think I could make a night of it. Doppelbocks just must not be my thing."
"Probably great on-tap, or very fresh."
"Overall: It was OK, not great, but OK. I mean I wasn't impression. Taste was a little weak. Nothing that I'm in love with. In the end, eh..."
"D: Good easy to drink doppelbock, i almost forget it's close to 8%."
"Fuller rich body, medium carbonation, smooth on the palate. Decent drinking with enjoyable flavor and a solid example of the style."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable for 7.6% ABV. This one could get me in trouble. Not too complex, not too sweet, not especially toasty, very easy to drink."
"D: The flavor is a bit too simple (not to mention, not spectacular) for me to really enjoy this one. Slightly cloying near the end of the glass, though the alcohol is hidden well and the thin body make it quite manageable."
"D: Something holding it back. I think it's the alcohol taste. It adds to the flavor in a good way, but I'm not sure I could kick back several in one sitting."
"Mouthfeel: Full body and balanced carbonation"
"Overall an acceptable example but not an exceptional one."
"I would definitely recommend this one. Very drinkable to the point I want to know more about this style."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but keep in mind, a six-pack of Optimator is worth a twelve pack of lesser beers in terms of the ""effects"". Where I live, a case of this stuff goes for about $31 (tax included), which is almost impossible to beat."
"Spaten-Brau, Munich, Germany--SPATEN Optimator Doppelbock--Green Label--2010 16.9 oz. Bottle. 7.60% ABV. 20 IBU's? (3.5 / 5.0) Thick pour. No sediment. Light tan 1/2"" mild lace dissipating head. Clear dark ruby edged black color. Toasted black cherry fig mild hop front. Mildly creamy rich roasted fruit toffee cherry malty smooth mellow sweet rich BOCK body. Dry mild hop hot EtOH end. Sampled 1/8/2011. Purchased for $2.47 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle 12/28/2010."
"Optimator arrives in a green bottle with a brown, gold trimmed, label. The beer itself is a brown, ruby color with a creamy cap of foam. Roasted malt, husky grain, dark fruit in the aroma. The body is medium to full as it smoothly slithers across the tongue. A carbonated bite preludes the light touch of hops. The 7.2% ABV shows through in a good way. Very Bockish."
"Spaten Optimator was a very dark red-brown color with good clarity when held to a light. It had a light tan head with good retention and lacing. The smell was sweet dark malt and a touch toasty. The taste was malty and sweet as well with a little hop flavor coming through towards the finish. The finish was long and semi-dry. It was medium-full in body with medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a good Doppelbock that is well worth trying out. This beer improves as it warms with some fruitiness and a touch of alcohol coming through."
"D: good cold, however as it got warmer not as good."
"I love this beer and, more notably, my girlfriend likes this beer. And my girlfriend hates beer. A fine example of the style and at a fantastic price (10.99 at Famous Liquors on Roosevelt Rd. in Lombard, IL.). At approx. $1 per bottle and at 7% abv, I think we have a winner."
"D: Thought the beer would be thicker based on the color, prefered it when colder."
"Mahogany hued, capped by a thin beige head. The nose is heavy on raisins and prunes, with nutty, bready malt beneath. There's a slight vinous aroma that lends some complexity. The palate is very similar; a lot of raisin and prune flavor above a backbone of toasted malt. Moderately sweet, fairly vinous toward the finish with some metallic astringency. This isn't bad, but it's far from my favorite doppelbock. Too reminiscent of prune juice."
"D=Good flavor and mouthfeel combined with medium body make this one that can be downed over and over again"
"A solid doppelbock made by one of the classic German breweries. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: Although I am not usually a lager person, I have been getting more into Doppelbocks recently, and this is a nice example of the style. Really drinkable at 7.2%. Definitely better as it warms."
"D: A bit thin for the style IMO, prefere a bit more body. Otherwise, strong offering from a classic brewery."
"D - I could drink more, the alcohol is pretty well hidden, but I don't think I want to."
"This beer takes on a rich flavor with a distinct malty taste. I enjoy it's chocolate and amber flavors. You get just enough without it being to overpowering. This beer also has a nice alcohol percentage of 7.2% which is just right for this style of beer, you tend to not notice the alcohol with the balance of the malt."
"D- You feel the alcohol on this pretty quickly although it isn't immediately noticed when consuming, leading me to think i could drink a number of these, i assume i would easily be feeling it after 2 or three!"
"Overall: Although I admit I haven't tried a wide variety of doppelbock, this one rates up there among the better ones that I have tried. If I had access to this beer more often, it would easily become one of my regulars."
"This is a decent doppelbock, good flavor, I wouldn't mind having another one but I wouldn't look for it."
"drinkability; the finish is a little dry and annoying but overall, this is a fine drink and a good introductory beer to the Doppelbock style."
"The Optimator remains one of those standby doppelbocks if one can't find any superior beers of the style available. The price is generally right, and this is an standard bearer of the style, but it still pales in comparison to the pinnacles of the style due to its lackluster scent and somewhat tame taste."
"D: Superb. Even at the high ABV I'd kill a sixer no problemo."
"D- very drinkable for the style"
"Bought a bottle for ""German Night"" in the house. Drinking with brats and kraut. Poured into a mug, this is a lovely dark brown/caramel coloring with a large, foamy, light head. The smells are rich in malt. The increased carbonation helps to balance the heavy molasses flavoring. It's sweet and bitter at the same time in mouth, and surprisingly smooth. Very easy to drink, especially with this type of meal. Fantastic to drink, and even better to cook with."
"Notes: one of my favorites, Breakfast beer it is. a little thrown off by the label reading ""malt liqour"" on the side, guessing no hops."
"D/M: beautifully smooth drinking especially for a dopplebock, drinks much lighter than expected and yet still has a great depth of flavor that really makes it an enticing brew"
"Drinkability: This has been a favorite beer of mine for a while even before I thought about reviewing beers. It's a heavy beer that doesn't require a refill because it satisfies so much. You'll want to pick up an Optimator to help you wash down your dinner or to celebrate."
"Deep ruby/brown pour with a medium foamy head that sticks around a while. Aroma of sweet roasty caramel malt and light sweet fruitiness. Flavor is the same. Loads of roasty malt and hints of Caramel. A bit of alcohol bite on the finish, but not enough to be distracting, still smooooth. Body needs to be a bit heavier. Not the Best Doppel Bock....But this is well worth it. Thanx Doug K."
"D - A solid doppelbock a touch on the sweet side."
"Notes: Enjoyable beer but not my favorite doppelbock. This one is more of a fruity doppelbock rather than chocolate. Definitely worth a try, especially given its history, but I don't think it is my favorite of the style."
"And what boosted my impression was the great setting - Jacob Wirth's restaurant - the oldest German restaurant in the US. Good times."
"D - A good bock with enough character to keep things interesting. ABV to be expected, so all in all very drinkable."
"Pours a deep reddish-brown with small head and minimal lacing. Smells of caramel, molasses, dark chocolate and alcohol. Tastes strongly of molasses, caramel and alcohol, very similar to smell. Overall a strong doppelbock with a punch at 7.2% ABV. A nice doppelbock... don't drink too many of these at this high ABV!"
"A very nice doppelbock, probably one of y favorite ones , because of the smooth mouthfeel and drinkability. Great german beer."
"D- Very drinkable. One of my favorite dopplebocks. Quite smooth for 7.2%. I could easily forget this should be a sipping beer."
"Notes - A nice doppelbock that has its ups and downs. If it would chill out a little and not try so hard, it could be even better than it is."
"I would probably only drink one of these at a time, primarily because it is fairly strong at 7.2%, but also because it's a very unique flavor that I wouldn't want to desensitize myself to."
"Medium bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation that's just enough to make it nice a creamy. For a fairly big beer, the alcohol was well hidden and it was decently drinkable."
"Pours a deep black color with a thin tan head and tons of pretty lacing that leave cobwebs on the inside of the glass. Smells of dark chocolate, licorice, vanilla bean, and roasted barley. Tastes sweet from plenty of sweet malts, deep dark chocolate, fresh vanilla bean, sweet licorice, and a little acidity. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. Drinkability is great."
"- I thought the beer had pretty decent body, and while I did not have more than one I thought it was relatively drinkable."
"Pours a moderate brown caramel color win a light tan head with some good lasting power in my pilsner glass. Nose brings caramel, toffee, and some light drugs. The taste is a bit sweet with some caramel, though not too much depth. Nice body and carbonation. A beer I used to drink fairly often and don't mind coming back to at all."
"As with most dopplebocks it's big enough that I'm only going to do one as a sitting, but that one goes down very easily. Considering how much easier it is for me to get a hold of than Celebrator - easier even than Central's dopplebocks - and how inexpensive it is, this will likely be my go to dobblebock for the near future."
"D- A good, but not quite great doppelbock. I enjoyed it and the price point on it is pretty good."
"Final Notes: A solid doppelbock, and one I'll return to many times over. Would be a great steak and potatoes type beer."
"D-This is my first Doppelbock and although good, it was not especially impressive."
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/10/13/tasting-the-spaten-optimator/"
"Overall: A Solid dark beer perfect for post Oktoberfest consumption."
"D- nice evening sipper, think it's more of an early fall mid spring beer, but fit this little one man session well."
"Notes: Better than Ayinger's Celebrator because it was not as cloying."
"Poured into a non-stem pilsner glass, the dark translucent brown liquid is rich with cascading foam. This is a smooth Munich dopplebock with Spaten's flavor personality present from start to finish. Rich malty caramel notes with hops support and substantial strength, although not anywhere near as strong as American over-the-top attempts on this style (Samuel Adams for example). Instead you have a well rounded malt showcase that when served (too) cold only improves with the rising temperature. Some very good ester notes of dark fruit, combined with a lingering dry finish, makes this a pleasure. There is nothing out of place here. A historic and yet very contemporary drinking experience."
"D-very high, the 7+ ABV does not preclude sessioning with this"
"Bought this beer on a recomendation from a good friend / drinking buddy. My first impression as a non-fan of dopplebock's was wow this is not overpowering as some dopplebock's can be. The color was very dark with reddish hue's the smell was the charecteristic caramel sweet odour when I took my first drink is when it really stood apart with a very balanced malty caramel taste. this beer is very drinkable and going out on a limb feel this will be a very regular beer for me."
"D - Excellent. Great beer for having a couple of. Doppelbock is quickly becoming my new favorite style."
"One of the first flavors you'll taste upon first sip is the alcohol, which is almost too pronounced. But, the maltiness and sweetness of this beer are what you'll remember. Overall the smoothness and lack of bitterness makes this beer quite drinkable, though it may be a bit too sweet (and malty) to tackle more than one in a single evening. Needless to say, this is a reasonably priced, tasty doppelbock that I highly recommend."
"D - I think the alcohol was a bit too pronounced for me, but other than that it was pretty good. Not my favorite of the style but I'd drink it again sometime. I would say it's drinkable enough to sit down with 20 ounces of it but not much more than that. Worth a try."
"Drinkable but very sweet, which is something to be expected from a double bock. The ABV doesn't show in the taste at all. Very good beer."
"D: I do not know much about doppelbocks but this beer is tasty, easy to drink and smooth for such a dark beer"
"Dark brown color, with a frothy tan-colored head, sweet toasted and caramelized malt nose, with a toffeeish accent, brown sugar, hint of dark dried fruits fruitiness in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a very sweet toasted malt character with some brown sugar, hint of nuttiness, dried raisins and plums fruitiness, leading towards a rich malty finish."
"Clear dark brown with one finger of pale tan head. Some lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel and flowers. Taste is very sweet caramel, molasses, some fig flavor. Mouthfeel is good with some warming alcohol on the center of the tongue. Really close to a Winter Warmer type beer. Drinkability is quite good but one would be enough for me. Try this instead of brandy after a meal. Very tasty."
"D: This is truly a great drinking beer. Not too complex, but it will mess you up in a hurry and taste great doing so."
"Overall it was not a great beer tasting experience. I would have loved to try this beer on tap in Munich. I believe it would make all the difference."
"While some others may not appreciate the thinner mouthfeel and lack of other tastes (raisins, figs), I find it very drinkable and a top notch example of style."
"D-this is a darn tasty doppelbock with a good rich flavor profile and enough of a hop balance and light alcohol presence that make for a tasty rich beer."
"1 pt 9 fl oz bottle poured into pilsener glass. Deep ruby to russett brown, dark but transparent when held to the light. Smell is of dark fruit, roasted malt, burnt sugar, molasses, slight booziness, and bread. The taste is raisins and plums to start, then a slight alcohol bite, with an aftertaste following up with a return of the fruitiness along the side and middle of the tongue and black bread with a slightly smoky quality. There is a medium/heavy body and wet finish to this very good doppelbock. One is enough to enjoy thoroughly."
"Drinkability - Aftertaste and filling nature makes this one hard to come back to more than once in a night for me. But still a good doppelbock."
"I like this beer. Despite it's InBev associations, I find myself drinking one every few years. It will take me a while to go through a six pack of this, as the beer's strength limits it's drinkability over an evening. Within the glass, I take it slowly because of the strength and the sweet coat. This is a beer that is probably available in your area. If you are unsure about doppelbocks or want to explore German beers beyond Beck's, this is a good one to try."
"solid doppelbock"
"Poured to a one finger head of light brown color with a velvet like head. The head was not long lasting, evaporating after about forty seconds. The lace around the glass is thick, but has no clinging power. Smells like nothing discernable, just a little sweet flowery aroma. OOOO the taste is nothing like the smell. Reminds me of licorice, something like Jagermeister, but missing the big kick. Color is a 29 on the SRM Beer Color Chart, but the color is not reprehensive of the flavor. The flavor is rich and mellow, with a hint of sweetness. The licorice really comes through, with a wave of sweet hops. There is very little bitterness although there is a definite flavor or hops. This is a beer that I would spend hard earned cash to drink."
"D- Not the most complex brew, but how complex can this style be? It's definitely an easy drinker due to the malty dominance. Nothing to special here, but I could easily buy a sixer for a campfire."
"Verdict - Germans know beer. Spaten Optimator is a testament to that. I tried this on a stranger's recommendation a few months ago, and I must say it's become one of my favorites. When I go out for beers, I typically try something new and then finish off with something I know I like. This has become a frequent finisher for me. If you haven't tried Optimator, then you're missing out. Seriously - this is one of those beers that's so good that it makes you sad when you find your glass empty. On a side note, this beer still tastes exquisite out of a bottle. Some beers, e.g. Young's Double Chocolate Stout, taste much better from a tap than from a bottle."
"D: Highly drinkable. This is a wintertime warmer and a beer that will give you a good feeling without having to feel full."
"Overall this was a solid beer. It was sort of mellow at first, but then as it got warmer the roasted malts really came through. I could easily drink a 6pck of this stuff. I think it would be a good autumn beer."
"Glad I tried it...I've been wanting to explore a few other Doppelbocks and ultimately I'm finding it is a style I don't particularly enjoy despite being a fan of malty beers. Too thin and too sweet...would rather spend my money on some Dirty Bastard, etc..."
"Poured into a pint glass. A deep dark orange brown with very little head and light carbonation. Despite the head and carbonation characteristics it remains to be an alluring brew. Although there is little carbonation it does not taste flat. It has a distinct, lush, prune-like smell with hints of licorice. A bitter taste but not overbearing. Not very heavy, and this is deceptive, because you will feel quite a nice buzz after drinking a few. The first time I tried this beer I drank it straight from the bottle and could not really appreciate it. Upon second taste I rather like it. To sum it up, I would say it has good multiple personalities like a beautiful gothic chick you are just getting to know. But if you are not respectful she will kick your ass."
"Sweet smell and taste (think caramel, raisins, maybe even sugar), with almost no hop flavour and kick, which I don't really mind as long as the taste is as complex as here. Extremely drinkable, and very pleasant. I like it very much."
"For those of you that like full bodied beer with little carbonation then this beer is for you."
"For German beers this is probably considered an average. This balance between refreshment & character is a revelation here though."
"Pours a dark amber-caramel brown. Smells of roasted malt, caramel, molasses, and just a hint of licorice. Tastes of roasted caramel malt, brown sugar, and notes of fig and nut. Very smooth. Well-balanced and full-bodied. ""Blessing of your heart - you brew good ale."" In this case, 'strong lager'. --Shakesbeere"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma has notes of caramel with some dark fruit mixed in. The flavor is just as good if not better. I get some caramel malts, bready malts, grapes, dark fruit and molasses. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"overall a very drinkable beer, and probably one of my favorite doppelbocks i've tried to date. not overly sweet or aggressive in any way."
"a more pf a tawny dark coca cola in the light color. with a off white head. nice and frothy and somewhat thick but not as thick and some other doppelbocks i've had. nose is toasty almond and molasses. palate is where it should be with a particularly sweet quality to it. brown sugar, almost honey. with definite nutty molasses quality. easy to find and most typical of drink. good. consistent but too dessert of a doppelbock for me. nice abv quality. not a trace."
" ~ This is a good beer. I'm a big fan of the style and I'm a big fan of this brew. Now if I could venture to Munich and try a fresh one from the tap."
"D: The alcohol isn't that apparent in the smell or taste so it's very drinkable although I'm not sure how many of these I could have because itls very filling and feels like you are having a meal."
"Buy Again? Yes"
"jd"
"Taste is warm, like a brown ale, aged a bit (this may have been unintentionally). Thankfully doesn't have the rubbing alcohol feel of a lot of doppelbocks. Has something prickly to it, maybe not hops, or those Euro hops I don't have too often, a nice subtlety. Mouthfeel too thin to get to into it, and neither is the price."
"Poured a dark mahogany brown with a one fingered offwhite head. Sweet malty aromas with hints of carmel and brown sugar. Taste as it smelled, with a boozy finish that wasn't over bearing. Nice medium body with good carbonation. Desent enough brew with a nice clean finish."
"Definitely an enjoyable doppelbock."
"D: Average. I could maybe have 2 of these."
"A good beer across the board. Nothing truly exceptional, but easy drinking and inexpensive to boot."
"I was initially unimpressed with this beer, but over the past few days, my opinion has improved somewhat. Pours out with a great head, which dissipates fairly quickly. Emits a subtle, almost apologetic, typically German odor. Color is dark, but not thick. Flavor ranges from tolerable to delicious- can't really decide. I probably wouldn't buy it again, but then again, maybe I would. I can't really decide."
"All in all, a very drinkable doppelbock that hides the alcohol very well and provides an easy sipping beverage for a relaxing night. I kinda wanna try this on tap to see if the flavor is a bit different. Either way, another solid offer from the Bavarian folks at Spaten."
"This has always been one of my favorite German beers and the latest tasting bore that out."
"RJT"
"Body is surprisingly thin. Carb is appropriate, and as it is thin and not terribly high in alcohol, it is reasonably drinkable. The best thing that I can say about this beer is that it is a ""looker""...but that isn't enough for me to buy it again."
"Goes down pretty easy. Could be a good spring or fall drink."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a parchment head that fades quickly, but leaves nice lace. The aroma is very malty with plenty of brown sugar, toffee and toasty notes as well as a slight nuttiness. Flavor is also very malty but is balanced out well with a burnt sugar character and some bitterness. Plenty of brown sugar, toffee and some fruity sweet notes as well. More herbal hops than I had expected, but they are still far in the back ground. I find that this beer lacks a bit of the doppelbock punch you usually get, and while good it is a bit subdued. The body is on the fuller side of medium and is fairly sticky. One of the most drinkable doppelbocks I have had, but not the most exciting."
"This is my first German Munich and I am very Impressed. almost like a brown ale but smoother and cleaner. Pours a nice deep copper color with a thin tan head that spreads to the sides quikly. Mouth feel is very nice and nice carmal taste with hints of chocolate and fruit."
"This beer pours out a dark brown, with very little off white head, and even this little bit dissipates rather quickly. Lots of malt and caramel scents come off of this beer, as well as just a hint of alcohol which, fortunately, stays mostly in the background. This beer tastes very malty and to a lesser degree has some caramel flavor to it. The mouthfeel for this one is pretty good, not as heavy as you'd expect from a beer at this ABV, but I wouldn't call it thin by a long shot. The main reason I think this beer suffers is because its high ABV impairs its drinkability somewhat. While tasty, this isn't a beer you're going to sit down and drink through a six pack."
"Ok, just a bit about it. It is dark, rich, and sweet. If you want dry and bitter look elsewhere. This one will pair with a nice dessert or just about anything as far as I'm concerned. Yes, it does get better as it approaches room temperature but I haven't made it all the way there because it tastes too damn good. Enjoy and only rate it if you can appreciate a truly damn good Doppelbock."
"Drink up, boys and girls!"
"Future outlook: Good, if unspectacular beer. I won't seek it out, but I won't run if handed another one of these."
"D Good to drink with dinner, not a chuggin beer by any means."
"East drinking so long as you serve it warm enough."
"Easily drinkable Dopplebocks. Light enough to drink , but heavy enough to be one to be aware of the abv"
"not bad for my first dopplebock"
"Drinkability: This is easily drinkable and a good companion to a game burger, but I probably won't make a point of having more. I would not turn it down if offered but on the whole I'd prefer to seek out others that are just as readily available (e.g., Celebrator, St. Victorious, Smooth Hoperator, etc.)"
"D: One of the more drinkable Doppelbocks I have had. You can take big plugs at it and do just fine."
"Great atmosphere. Appearance is very solid. Dark and rich with a nice full head. Nose is a great combination of sweet, but not overly so, components. Flavor is malty with subtle sweetness, but not enough to deduct from the roasted malty goodness. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"D: A decent brew, but nothing to write home about. It lacks the ""meal in a bottle"" quality that I expect from a really good Doppelbock."
"Though cleaner than most dbocks it lacks complexity and big beer feel."
"Overall: A nice easy to drink doppelbock. It's not my favorite but it's one of the pillars of the style so it has my respect. I'd be more than willing to drink this again although I think if given the choice I'd go for a Salvator before this."
"Overall, very good. A decent version of the style. Simple, but full of flavor. A good one to try if you are getting into doppelbocks. And cheap too! I bought this as a $1.80 single."
"Drinkability: This could get ugly for anyone without self-control. But it's super-smooth and drinkability is bar-none. This could definitely sneak up on the unsuspecting due to warming and light-sweet finish."
"Great flavor, again strong on the malt, slighty sweet, very slight coffee hint. Medium bodied with quite a kick. A little strong for a session beer, but a great choice for the style."
"This is a delicious doppelbock. It is well and truly named. Bocks and doppelbocks are quickly becoming my favorite styles what with such good examples to represent them."
"I would drink this any day of the week."
"This is my fiances first review ever I think she did damn well"
"Oh why oh why would they serve this is a 20oz pint glass!?! This was a fantastically refreshing doppelbock, that your's truly overindulged in. True to the style, it is dark and beautiful. Nothing amazing about the taste or aroma, but both are what you would expect from a doppelbock. The alcohol content is nicely masked by a smooth texture, that can sneak up on you very quickly!"
"This beer is extremely light for a doppelbock, and should be critiqued as such. It seems that many reviewers are expecting a dark, intense, and brooding beer. If that were Spaten's goal, I would concur that it fails. This beer approximates the mouthfeel, appearance, and some of the flavor profile of a dunkel. I happen to love dunkels, so given the very low price and high availability, I will be buying more."
"D: This lager has good flavor, but I couldn't drink more than one or 2 of these because of the sweetness."
"D: This beer finishes real sweet (as it should) but combine it with 7.2% and its not exactly a session beer. It is really good though, the only part that missed the mark for me was the mouth feel. I would have liked to see a fuller a body out of a beer with just a high starting gravity"
"I gotta say I'm kind of disappointed with this one. Not as strong as I thought it would be."
"Overall a pretty good dopplebock."
"The drinkability is fantastic. Not too high in alcohol that you can not have a couple, enough flavors to keep the tongue guessing at ever turn, mixed with the lightness of a lager. I will definitely purchase this again."
"An underwhelming doppelbock, but also a little bit confounding. It promises some deep malt and doesn't deliver, so I want to hate this beer. Then again, the dark fruit character to the taste is occasionally very nice, and near the end of the bottle some of the sips are wholly enjoyable. I think this would be a great beer to give to someone who likes things like Harp lager, because it has significantly more flavor than Stella/Harp/BMC/etc. At the same time, everything this beer does well is done better by another beer (and not *that* well done by Optimator)."
"Pretty thick mouthfeel on the Optimator. Drinkable, but in moderation."
"I was able to drink an entire bottle this time. For me this is a good beer to drink throughout a hearty winter meal. In my case lentil, spent home brew grain, and sausage stew. This is a solid German doppelbock that I think is worth revisiting during the cold months. Drinkability goes up to 4."
"Spaten Optimaor is a dark ruby red that has brown blotches. Not much as even a cap even off of the tap, just some faint squigglies. Smells is dark fruit, plum, pear, roast, big malts, caramel and toffee. The taste is the same but maybe not in the above order. It's very sweet and caramel/tofee rich, too much for my liking. The feel is syrupy and above medium and it reminded me of fresh Mad Elf from the tap. Sweet and a bit cloying. Drinkability was low."
"A nice big meaty beer. Drinkability suffers due to the viscosity and sweetness, but the size of the beer does a good job of masking the not insignificant alcohol."
"D- easy to drink and it doesn't even feel that warming"
"Drinkability: This is one thick and heavy beer - one is enough. This is a straightforward malt bomb, with no other flavors/complexity to note of. One is definitely enough, but this isn't exactly a style to session. Solid beer."
"D- A filling beer to say the least; like eating a meal."
"D – Good stuff; pairs well, works in any situation."
"D: this is my go-to doppel. It may not be the best, but it is damn close, and a good bit cheaper too. A classic example of the style."
"Poured into a chalice with only one finger head that was tan . Colors a deep dark brown with ruby hints. Aromas are faint and malty. Tastes malty in general a light chocolate flavor followed with some very faint fruitiness and alcohol spiciness. Feels good on the palate with a light tickling of carbonation and an oily finish. Overall a nice drinkable beer."
"Tech stuff I guess: Solid pour head, typical dark beer/ale flavors, probably would be a favorite in the real beer drinker country of Germany"
"Pours dark brown with reddish highlights. Left a one finger tan head that dissipated quickly. No lacing. Not too much smell, smells a lot like any other Spaten I've had. Taste is very pleasant; roasty, malty, dried fruits. I can almost taste some raisin and ginger. Mouthfeel is medium but a little thick, hardly any carbonation. Drinkability is way up there since this is such a pleasant beer. It's very inviting. I also need to point out that the labels calls this a ""malt liquor"". This is one of the best I've had! Right up there with the OE 800 :)"
"Medium bodied and fairly drinkable ( don't notice much of the 7.2%). Overall a pretty decent dobbelbock."
"Pours a dark brown slightly opaque with hints of red. Off-white head with decent retention and lacing. Aroma is pretty much just malt - taste brings a bit more to the table, but not much...slight hints of caramel or nuttiness. All in all, both taste and aroma are a bit weak. They're not bad, but not particularly interesting. Mouthfeel is likewise underwhelming - too thin. Carbonation is okay, but a bit more might help. Drinkability is good."
"D: Nice beer, not as complex as some (Celebrator), but hits the style well."
"Overall this was a good beer for the style but there are certainly betters out there. Worth a shot."
"Full bodied, some tinge of bitter in there, but mostly sweet and a slight darker malt almost schwartz character. Drinkability high and mouthfeel is great. This is a wonderful beer and a great experience. I reviewed this on draft and in the bottle now, both great ways to drink."
"Overall, good beer, not the one I'd go for every day. Cheers."
"After her scent of seduction her smooth almost doughy malt sweetness that tingles on the tongue right before taking over your soul... Missing that rough bitterness of domestic hops there is something romantic about an authentic European style beer... almost like drinking wine... if you do that sort of thing.. which i do not.."
"D: very drinkable. Flavor is good (not great) but its nicely quaffable. Not many dopplebocks where you can put down more than one...and the Optimator is one of the few."
"Drinkability: VERY drinkable for a 7.2%. Smooth, not too sweet or heavy."
"D: I don't think taste would be a hindrance at all to drinkability. Malty sweet stuff tends to go down easy for me. But I do tend to watch myself on higher alcohol stuff, and that's where this ceases to be a good session beer."
"A nice example of a doppelbock. Sweetness and slightly strong alcohol task keep me from drinking this every day."
"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit sweet, and malty, a bit bready. Taste is also bready, sweet, lots of malts, very easy drinking. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer worth checking out."
"D - only thing keeping this from being hugely drinkable is the sweetness becomes somewhat overwhelming after a bit. otherwise, a great and slightly unique doppelbock."
"This is my second dopplebock(the other being Salvator). I think i'm in love. The taste blows me away on this cold winters day. Cant wait to try the other ones. The Germans are true masters of their craft, wonder what it would be like to try one in Badtolz or Munich?"
"this beer pours a nice clear brown color with a tan head that recedes to very fine lacing. the aroma is very malty with a bit of caramel in the nose as well, maybe a bit of fruit esters from the yeast. the taste improves upon the nose with the caramel and roasted malt flavor very well developed and complimented nicely by the bavarian yeast esters. the full body and smooth carbonation are good for the style, a petty drinkable doppelbock."
"Another nice quality German brew."
"d- surprisingly easy to drink with its overall heaviness. awesome winter beer."
"Nice black-brown color with a tan head. Leaves good lacing, medium thick and it hangs around for a few before sliding down the chalice. First thing about the nose is it's very sweet and nutty. Reminds me of Dinkel Acker. Lots of almonds and molasses in the nose with a creamy sweet maltball character. The taste offers more candied nut flavor like brown sugar coated pecans, roasted almonds and lots of maple syrup. Very malty up front and not much in the way of hops anywhere, walnuts drowned in molasses in the finish and a little shot of dark chocolate. The mouthfeel was medium in thickness and even though it wasn't over carbonated the size of the bubbles gave it feel like a soda pop. Somewhat dry for the style. Good example and an old school classic."
"D-i can't have too many of these b/c of the alcohol content and the level of sweetness from the malts"
"I will definitely put this in line with Korbinian and Bajuvator."
"D- High drinkability. Holds itself as a heavy beer but several can be enjoyed in a single evening."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle no. L-18091F. Sampled on November 22, 2009. This has a richly dark mahogany brown pour with a thin beige head and above average lacing. The aroma is sweet and malty with a nice following of hops on the last sniff. Medium mouthfeel. The taste has a fine roasted malt sensation, maybe a little molasses, and a moderate but pleasing hoppy ending. An easy to drink draker beer despite its 7.2% ABV."
"D - I definitely could not drink this all night, however, this is an excellent beer to drink by the fire or for a nightcap. This beer is rich, flavorful and a true winter beer, nay, classic."
"The flavors are harsh and heavy, I feel like it needs a bit more of the bubbles to break things up."
"The foam was wheat in color, bubbly, thick, smooth and left a ring around the glass til the end. The color was a dark burgandy/all most black with an orange red highlight in the light. The smell of roasted barley and hints of chocolate and raisons and a fruity undertone. It had a very robust taste with a variety of flavors like roasted barley, hints of chocolate and fruity accents. The mouthfeel - semi-viscous and rich. Drinkability - nice and rich - I'm a great fan of the dark beers."
"Drinkability: this stuff is pretty tasty to me, but it is a little bit of a one-note song (OK, a two-note song--malt and pears--but you get the idea). I'll finish this one gladly, but it's a little sweet and monotonous to session."
"D- Honestly, its a stretch for me to put down more than two of these. Just a 'once in a while' beer for me."
"Two thumbs up for Spaten's Optimator!"
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, but defiantly on the heavy side. I'm not going to be playing much beer pong with this one!"
"Overall this is one of the better beers I have tried good caramel taste not bad very good to go with beef or perhaps a good meaty stew, nice winter beer good and heavy, actually would like to drink this one more. I am trying the one pint nine oz bottle not bad will try again but in a smaller bottle."
"been on the doppelbock tip lately and this one definitely doesn't disappoint. Great big sweet but not overly sweet malt character w/ hints of caramel. It's medium bodied that fringes on full. The drinkablity is a little better than average for the style. Its definitely no Celebrator but worth drinking again."
"Definitely a drinkable beer, it is pretty crisp while cold, and as it warms up more licorice comes out and it becomes a bit more sticky, so maybe not an all night beer. Another reason for this, as with most doppelbocks is that it is higher in alcohol and is something that could sneak up on you in just a few beers, so enjoy, but watch out, this ain't a Twizzler!"
"Moderately carbonated in the mouthfeel. Very tasty and drinkable. Well made brew."
"D - Drinkable but heavy. Also, ABV is high but alcohol is not felt at all."
"Mouth is somewhat watery and beer is medium bodied. Good carbonation."
"This is one smoooth doppelbock. Creamy, toffee and caramel maltiness just glides through the mouth and down the hatch. The fruit that was so readily apparent in the nose fades to barely a whisper in the flavor. Some warming alcohol makes an appearance in the finish. This is a tremendously drinkable and flavorful doppelbock, there is always room for some Optimator in my fridge."
"Pours a great deep brown, nearly black, color with very nice head and lacing. Nice deep scent, very sweet and malty with a slight coffee aroma. Great taste, a wonderfully thick, dark, and strong malt flavor; no real bitterness, great for a doppelbock. Went down great, no notice of the high ABV; a great thick and dark beer."
"Just a shade below full bodied with perfect carbonation. A very thick, lush mouthfeel. Big fan of this component."
"D - Love it and could easily kill several in one session. Although I was shocked to see the ABV in the 7s."
"Overall a bit too roasted, even charred in a brown sugar sense in the background but has ample malts to balance things. Decent, not stellar."
"I put this on up with Celebrator and Aventinus."
"It tastes a lot similar to a Sam Adams Winter Lager. It is a good, hearty beer and is recommended for cooler temperatures/seasons. It drinks as a fairly heavy beer. Although, its appearance is like a Guinness, it has a better drinkability. I'd give it a solid B or B+"
"A great beer for novices and connoisseurs alike."
"Give it a go."
"Pours a beautiful amber mahogany color with a quickly fading head. The color reminds me of a traditional dark wood pub and is just as inviting. Lots of sweet malt on the nose with a touch of roasted aroma. Sweet malt flavor is met first quickly followed by bitter roasted malt and subtle hops and finishes slightly dry with nice post-nasal malt aroma. The mouth feel is smooth and silky, just enough thickness to match the malt strength. This is definitely a beer I would recommend to a malt lover."
"[Drinkability]: Very drinkable, smooth beer for high ABV."
"As fall begins and the nights grow cooler, Optimator is the perfect companion for a relaxing night: out on the patio, listening to the wind rustle the leaves, the wonderful scent from neighborhood fireplaces permeating the air."
"D: Delicious and does not really betray its high alcohol content. Definitely good drinkability."
"Overall, a very solid offering. Probably not my favorite dopplebock, but definitely recommended for fans of the style."
"This is my favorite Doppelbock to date and my favorite brew from Spaten."
"Na Zdravje"
"This is a very drinkable beer -- smooth but not cloying. It's not really a sipper. I could go through three or four of these if my better judgment didn't prevail."
"Drinkability- You won't pound a six pack of these. This is a very filling beer but delicious on the way down. Full flavored. I'd recommend it highly."
"A medium body and sweetness makes this very smooth."
"Overall: Good but not great."
"Best in winter. Very heavy for a hot summer day/evening."
"D: i have had better double bocks but this one is still really good if you just want one cause it fills your belly ha ha"
"This is a solid doppelbock, very drinkable, worth giving a try."
"D- A doppelbocks go this one is very drinkable. It is one that I would definitely enjoy again."
"D - Pretty high given the abv. You taste a bit of the alcohol, but for the most part this is just pure warmth and easy to down."
"Overall, This is a very good dopplebock and a fine example. This beer is always good when i don't know what to buy."
"The abv is extremely well hidden however this is a pretty heavy beer for the style. A slow drinker with wonderful complexity."
"The 7.2% ABV is well hidden in the sip but it is effective in warming the stomach. Overall this beer is a pleasure to drink and I have no problem putting down a couple."
"D: OK."
"D: Excellent, pure German double Bock."
"Poured it into a pint glass and it came out a nice reddish brown color with a deep head. Aromas of mostly brown sugar and some hops. Very smooth in the taste with chocolate, brown sugar, and very light caramel. This beer is very drinkable. It ends nicely with the typical Spaten bitternes with a very light metallic aftertaste. Very nice beer."
"Pours a dark amber body with a decent bubbly head. Smells malty, caramel, biscuit, a hint of fruit sweetness. Taste has excelent balance. The malt and alcohol are both present just at oposite ends if the flavor timeline. Caramel and toasty malt, the hops are hard to pickout. Mouth feel is oily and thick. Drinkability is high because it hides the alcohol well. But too heavy and too potent for a sesion beer."
"cheers"
"D- a little too vinous for my taste, I think I would aim more in the direction of a less estery dopplebock in the future."
"Drinkability- Excellent."
"Notes: This was a very enjoyable doppelbock. Also this is the only Euro imported beer I have seen that is 12oz and not 11.2oz."
"Mouthfeel was crisp, yet smooth. Easy drinker. Flavor was of sweet caramel, toffee, some coffee cake, fresh dark breads, and finished sweet as well. This is a very good Doppel, but may be too sweet for some. I, for one, enjoyed it."
"The nose is deceiving on this one. Behind the lame fragrance lies a superb brew that changes as it travels towards room temperature. The warmer it gets the more pronounced and complimentary the fruit flavors get. The optimator is a tasty brew worth your attention."
"D - Still a relatively full beer that can put a hurting on you. One is enough for me."
"Reviewed on 05/14/2009. 12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma of pizza dough and roasted lager malts. Flavor is nice and doughy with some sweetness in the finish. A touch vegetal. Nice and pleasant to drink. An ok beer."
"This is at the currently point in time, my favorite beer right now, and It's a joy to bring a 6-pack of it to a friends place and watch them enjoy it as well."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, very smooth going down"
"This is very drinkable. No offensive flavors."
"D- Even with the high ABV i find myself wanting to chug these. Once the ABV sets in a bit I am able to slow down. Might be best to alternate with a less ABV's if you like to pound beers like myself."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Smells faintly of alcohol, strong sweet malt, some caramel, and maybe a little like some kind of dark fruit. It tastes huge and malty. There's a lot of sweet, sugary flavors that sort of coat the tongue. Hop bitterness is understated but there maybe is a bit of hop flavor rounding it out. Optimator is one of my favorites. It's a nice standard doppel that can be found on tap in a lot of places."
"Drinkability: I can see why a doppelbock is referred to as a ""meal in a glass."" Its much more filling than your average beer, but also extremely satisfying to drink. Its more of a sipping beer, but its very smooth."
"I love the taste but will only drink one of these due to the 7.2% abv. Couldn't drink this all night unless I planned on staying at the restaurant. Goes great with hot dogs with mustard!"
"It's a very dark brown, opaque. There's just a litle bit of brown visible at the lower edges of the glass. The aroma was pequliar, sort of a cherry, not strong but not definitive. The taste was the same light cherry with possible mollases added in. The body was heavy but not offensive. If you are going for a heavy beer, this one is a good choice. However; I would not recommend getting a boot full of this at Hessen Haus."
"Overall, a great find and certainly worth the price. Definitely one of the best of the style I have had so far."
"drinkability is good dispite it becoming a touch cloying when it approaches room temp. it's not you typical doppelbock; it's a little fruitier, and one gets the feeling that the malts in this one are, on average, roasted a bit less than your usual doppelbock, but it's still a solid beer that is always sure to please especially on tap."
"Poured a deep amber color with good carbonation and nice white head. Nose is faint, Munich malts, grainy unimpressive. Taste is much better than nose leads you to believe. Nice heavy, chewy, malty and tastes of Munich and maybe Crystal malts. Caramel, brown sugar maybe, syrup, dried prunes, figs, and raisins perhaps. Mouthfeel is coating and good."
"Deep brown color, sudsy head, lacing, smells like honey covered oats, honey wheat bread, smells very good. The flavor is full on malts, possibly fruity raisins, bready. Overall this is a decent dopple but it smells a lot better than it tastes but who can complain for $2.49?"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Seems light and slick in the mouth. I love how it lingers on the taste buds."
"Not a bad dopplebock overall, especially for the price. Solid, but nothing special. I would buy it again."
"I could drink more of these than any other version of the style that I have had so far, very nice beer."
"Full flavored and nice full mouthfeel. Thick malt, a bit nutty and chewy. Some toasty grain, not much hop punch to be found. This brew is to-style, perhaps a bit on the light side, but i would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a dopplebock. In a way, it is a bit pedestrian for a DB, but it's just so smooth and balanced that I would consider it the epitome of the style."
"I'd go back to reviewing this on draft out of a liter tankard - the bottle doesn't seem to be near as good to me."
"Drinkability: It all comes together to be quite drinkable, a seemingly sneekily perfect finish, classic noble hop ballance. Mischieviously slick for 7.2% abv."
"Medium bodied. Light and silky, very smooth. Very good drinkability. I would say this is a great introduction to the style, and anyone who claims to love Bocks would love this beer."
"D - Because of the higher alcohol content, I couldn't pound these back all night. Also, the sweetness is great for after-dinner, or for one or two, but would be cloying after more than that. This beer is amazing in small doses, but it loses it's luster after more than two or three."
"Note: I think I need to try this on tap."
"D- Easy to drink and worth a try for sure."
"I'm surprised Optimator doesn't rate higher with BA?"
"D- I would definitely have another, and I'm generally an ale person."
"D -- Good drinkability for a big beer. A definite savoring style."
"Drinkability- A couple is about the drinking limit due to higher ABV. Nice while they last though. A fine German bier."
"Notes: Again I am partial to Optimator since it was one of the beers that got me off of BMC. It challenged me to consider higher quality beers and taught me that beer can have a taste worth seeking out. Prost!"
"D - For a fuller bodied beer it's somewhat drinkable but it's thickness and sweetness knock this guy down a few pegs."
"Overall very good and very drinkable."
"All in all a fairly decent dopplebock. not my favorite, and not the most exciting, but definitely a solid example that doesn't really have any major faults, per se. If Optimator was one of the only options, I'd go with it in a hearbeat. Not one I'd drink regularly, but certainly wouldn't turn it down."
"overall this is very nice, well balanced and easy to enjoy. i'll def have this again. perhaps after i finish this one. lol!"
"D: highly drinkable, no alcohol picked up, lots of good flavor, a SOLID beer is how I would describe it"
"Poured into my trusted 12oz glass forming a 1""+ tan head over a dark amber body reminiscent of maple syrup. Loads of visible carbonation and the head fades to a light lacing on the glass and a bit around the outside of the liquid. The smell has bread, roasted grains, caramel or toffee and bit of nuts and fruit-plums? mixed with a light presence of alcohol. The taste is sweet and full of grains and caramel up front, a slight earthy bitterness and then a medicine-like alcohol and fruit/nut finish. Quite dry and a lingering of alcohol and the earthy bitterness. The mouthfeel is not quite chewy but almost, very full and this seems to almost stick to your teeth. I'll give this a high rating on drinkability, though not because you'd want to down several of these at a sitting but because it's a beer to look forward to having and enjoying slowly after work or such."
"mouth is viscous and creamy. Just like any doppelbock, the drinkability is minimal. I don't think I could keep drinking this for a extended period of time. Good but not great."
"Overall: It was one of the best beers I've ever had, highly recommend. It is smooth, tastes malty, almost bready, and a little sweet, barely carbonated, and looks and smells as good as it tastes."
"Solid. One of the best dopplebocks available. Almost black with pretty ruby highlights. Strong sweet malt aroma. Same for the flavor. Also hard candy. Sweeeet candy and some dark fruits. Smooth and full-bodied. Any easy drinker. If I am at Scholz Garden this is my go to beer."
"in my opinion spaten optimator is the best high alcohol beer in most stores. it is usually not expensive and can be found at almost any convienience store. the dark thick beer in the green bottle gives it a very distinct taste. i have alot of good memories of drinking spaten optimator. perfect for the person who wants to mix it up from their selection of normal regular beers."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability - I would rate this as high for drinkability."
"The clean, crisp, refreshing quality of this beer makes it incredibly drinkable and digestible. Not the best of its style but certainly shows amazing use of malt as the ""secret ingredient"" and how sweet and luscious can translate into a sessionable beer."
"Drinkability-- I gotta say this is one my first beers i started getting more into after only originally know American macros but I really do think this beer is underrated, I think its a really good example of its style and an amazing beer to drink, its sweet malty and delicious, its alcohol being high is slightly noticeable though still hidden enough to be very enjoyably drinkable, this is one i look forward to visiting ocasianally when i feel the need for a break from the usual lighter beers, hoppy beers, or the wheat beers, a beer i am glad to have in my rotation and worth a try if you haven't, one i think i will always enjoy even compared to the others i have tried of the style i still come back for more optimator"
"I really like this one, it's even better because it's so easy to find. Underrated in my opinion."
"Thick and full bodied with medium carbonation. Not the most drinkable doppelbock for me. This one isn't bad by any means but compared to many others, Optimator just doesn't hold up."
"D- A really smooth easy drinking beer. You could drink alot of these if the 7.2% ABV didn't eventually catch up with you."
"Out of the Doppelbocks from Germany that I've tried, this is my least favorite, as well as my least favorite offering from the Spaten brewery. It doesn't have the strong maltiness of Salvator, Bajuvator or Korbinian, it doesn't have the complexity of Celebrator or Andechser. It's not horrible but there are way better Doppelbocks and Starkbiers out there."
"average drinkability."
"Pours a medium to dark reddish brown, big tan head, lasting. Very sweet malty aroma, wood and toffee, grape juice, but not very strong an aroma. Taste of some coffee, chocolate and grape juice, effervescent. Not heavy like I thought. Good."
"The head was about half an inch thick; it quickly shrank to about a quarter, a thickness which it maintained throughout the session. One word (or name, rather) came to mind when I gazed upon this German genius: Coca-Cola. Yes, it's that dark, lovely colour of non-alcoholic American deliciousness. Once I plunged my nose deep into the glassware, memories of my grandmother's kitchen came to mind, as the distinct smell of vegetable soup came from this beer. The Optimator carried a bit of vegetable soup taste to accompany the nose, but the biggest part of what I tasted was bitterness. The mouthfeel was decidedly creamy, almost milky (perhaps skim). The throat and aftertaste was rather spicy. This was how the beer tasted throughout most of the session, although at one point toward the end I noticed a slightly coppery minerality."
"D: 7.2%? Well, it's borderline for me to have more than a couple of these guys. It's not heavy, like a Celebrator, but, damn near as good, but, in a different way...lighter maybe."
"D- Very drinkable. Nothing overwhelming but goes down easy for a DB."
"very decent here, really great flavor. the parts around it make it less appealing overall, but a great option if i am in the mood for a dark beer."
"Highly drinkable considering the 7.2 alc. I like this and will get again in the near future. Nice Beer:)"
"Dark Brown, with 3 finger head. at first i thought this to be too syrupy sweet. but after i let it sit and warm up just a bit, it seems to have really mellowed out a bit, and seems more balanced. although still a tad sweet, its not overpowering, nice bitter hops comes through in the end and helps balance out. I would get this again, and would like to sample it on tap."
"Drinkability: A little sweet for my taste, but a nice beer nonetheless. I could easily drink a couple of these in a sitting, especially with a plate of crunchy bratwursts, some sauerkraut, and a tub of spicy mustard to go along with them! Yum."
"D - The malts are nice, but a little too dominating for me to drink alone. That being said, I'd have a few of these with a nice meal of pork or beef and potatoes."
"CHEERS!!!"
"D - goes down nice and easy."
"I would definitely have this beer again."
"MF&D - a very thin beer, would have liked it thicker. too much like water in my case. the drinkability is fine, but the texture from the lack of viscosity is a bit off putting."
"The taste is thick and full flavored but very smooth. Many different tastes come to mind. Roasted malt and hops are the first things to hit the taste buds. As I savor the drink a little more I taste hints of chocolate and fruit. There is a slight bitterness in the aftertaste but it finishes dry."
"Cheers, and good drinking!"
"D- Overall a pretty good beer. I would have it again considering that it is pretty easy to drink and had an interesting flavor (which was present better as the beer warmed a little bit). Just watch out for the 7.2 ABV. It might sneak up on you if you want to enjoy a couple!"
"Had this at a little German restaurant in my home town of Brunswick. Served in a stange, it was a reddish/brown color with a thick white head that left a little bit of lacing. Aroma was caramel and raisins. Taste also caramel and raisin, but also a hint of chocolate. Perhaps a bit on the thin side. I think there could be more of a malt presence. Still, I enjoyed this beer, and will drink it again."
"Pours dark with a thin head and slight lacing. Smells malty. Taste of malt, a slight roasted flavor with some Carmel notes. In my opinion it seems to be on the thin side, but still very drinkable. The ABV can sneak up on you, as I cant detect the alcohol in this beer at all. Pretty good all around."
"Great beer, full of flavors. Full bodied yet highly drinkable. Another high quality product from Spaten"
"Notes: Personally, I thought this was just barely an above-average brew. Nothing too special going on here, but a commendable effort nonetheless. Although, I will say that this is considerably more tasty closer to room temperature. Overall, it's not too bad but nothing special."
"Excellent beer, a bit on the dark side (it is a malt liquor after all) something else to keep in mind (in my personal opinion) too high of an ABV at 7.2% for a session beer, but if only having a few it's very good. Lots of flavour, not too overpowering. Just had a few after playing hockey but would probably be better suited to accompany food such as pizza."
"D: I wouldn't call this an excellent beer, but it's still very good. Thick, rich, and malty with nice flavors. Warming and drinkable."
"A great beer experience."
"Overall - This was a pleasant beer to enjoy with a chess game and some sharp cheddar. Decent alcohol content may catch up after a few but a tasty beer nonetheless. Will buy again."
"Overall: A very rich deep malty beer. The mouth feel is carbonated and medium in body. The finish is slightly bitter and it lingers on the palate. I feel that there is a little too much hops which I feel is a bit to aggressive on the palate. Overall it is a good beer not great."
"D - A good example of a huge style made drinkable. Not as extreme as I might expect, but mellow enough to be appreciated."
"A fine example of the doppelbock style, the Optimator'ss approachable, but complex flavor of burnt grains should be an enjoyable checkmark on the list of any self-respecting beer lover's conquests."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. So far, it's my favorite Spaten."
"Pours clear chestnut brown with thick tan bubbly head that dissipates quickly to a thin film leaving spotty lace. Sweet malt aroma with a hint of cherries and chocolate. Good malt flavor with caramel and roasted malt that lingers a long while turning just a little bitter at the end. Pretty mellow really both in flavor and in mouthfeel. It is just a little thin, the carbonation is mild with just a little zing on the tongue, and it has a dry finish that is maybe a little metallic. This is a beer that I have always enjoyed, though I do not buy it very often. Definitely a winter purchase for me. Goes well with beef stew or some brats."
"D: this is one of the easier drinking dopplebocks out there, nice flavors, nothing too outstanding, nice balance, and it goes down easy. a great example of the style."
"Heavy bodied, medium carbonation. The toned down sweetness is a plus for me, more of a dry character than most doppelbocks I've had."
"overall an extremely drinkable brew, though not very complex. a nice go-to doppelbock that is easily found just about everywhere and never fails to please."
"Pours a clear brown color with one inch of tan head that slowly settles to a thin cap. Just a little spotty lacing is left on the glass. Has a caramel malt aroma. The flavor as well features the malt. Caramel flavors dominate with some faint noble hop flavors coming in on the finish. Alcohol is well hiddened with just a little warming on the palate. Medium body with low carbonation leaves a nice creamy texture. A nice beer to have on a cold night."
"Serving type: bottle"
"overall: for what it lacks in certain areas, it makes up for in high drinkability and a clean refreshing taste. great bang for your buck."
"All in all a great beer which I will purchase again. Celebrator is one of my all time favorites so its good to have a cheaper alternative while suffering from poverty."
"Pours a clear dark brown color with ruby highlights; an average off white head settled into a light ring. The aroma is of brown bread, some soy, raisins, and stale coffee. A good punch of flavor. A big bready malt with vinous characteristics, light soy sauce, and honey. A coffee flavor pops through in the after taste. Typical dopplebock flavors or at least what I expect. Definitely a good malt presence but the feel seems thin to me, though it is fairly crisp, which is nice. A very nice dopplebock, not too sweet or syrupy. Has a bit of a roasted malt presence to offset the sweetness."
"Very nice, and perfect for a -4F day."
"Very drinkable."
"It was very smooth. Low carbonation. Full flavor. An excellent beer that I would recommend to friends and fans of dopplebocks."
"I like it and it wasnt too expensive($3 @ Roth's in Salem). Dont know whay I taste tobacco so much in it, but Ive never had this style before either."
"Pour is clear dark brown with red highlights, short off-white head. Roasted malt, maple syrup (nice call kmw), toffee, molasses in the aroma. Smooth mouthfeel. Rich flavors of malt, more molasses, cookie dough, toast, and alcohol. Smooth, crisp mouthfeel."
"this beer is everything i hoped it would be, can't recommend it enough."
"This probably deserves a better rating but I don't get into doppelbocks as much as some."
"Drinkability: easy to drink for a doppelbock at 7.2% and easy to find that out the hard way; pretty nice beer, inexpensive for a higher alcohol brew, good value"
"My taste have changed since I first reviewed this beer. While still not great it is not a bad drink. I like it but do not Love it. Strong alcohol content so watch out."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Nice dark brown color with a thin head that hangs around tonicely lace the sides of the glass. No hop aroma with slight malt aroma. Hint of 'green bottle skunk'. Flavor of sweet malt predominates and that damn green bottle skunk is definately there. Light carbonation and a relatively light mounthfeel belies the beer's actual gravity, providing a pleasantly drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite beers and a solid example of the doppelbock style. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get into doppelbocks."
"D: this beer will go to your head if not careful, although there are beers with higher alcohol content very few seem to be this smooth; great beer to drink at a bar"
"This is one of the beers that opened me up to the beer world so I am bit biased. It pours a rich dark brown, with a strong malt smell. The taste is very malty and pleasing. This isn't the best doppelbock ever but a very good one nonetheless and one I love to drink and would highly recommend."
"Classic doppelbock."
"D- All night long or until I feel over, delicious"
"this wouldn't be a constant pick, but i wasn't disappointed."
"D: This one keeps getting better as you drink, but be careful, 'cause by the fourth Pint you might wanna get the next one to go."
"I tried this one after discovering Spaten Oktoberfest. It's hard to say which I like better really. Pours a rich, dark reddish-brown with a wonderful, long-lasting head. Smells very good, with heavy roast aromas. Tastes exceptional. It has a very complex taste which, honestly, I can't describe in any other way than to say to try it, it's wonderful. Mouthfeel is very heavy, which is appropriate for this brew. It makes you savor the beer and think about what you are tasting. Drinkability is decent, but it's difficult to have more than two or three because it's so easy to savor. Excellent beer, truly world class stuff."
"This beer drinks itself, fairly refreshing."
"I first had this in Germany on tap about 3 years ago and was aching to dip into it again when I was it at my local beer store. All in all, this beer tasted almost EXACTLY like regular Spaten with the exception of the orangish-brown color and the strength (a solid doppelbock at 7% ABV). It does not have the substance that I anticipate from a doppelbock and really does not bear the flavor all that well. It drank far better on tap and although vaguely differed from regular Spaten's crispness, the bite and refreshing finish really did it for me. It has some light fruit tones and a hint of sweetness, though it drinks like a lighter beer in that it goes down easier and the ABV strength is barely noticeable until it is down your throat."
"D: Good beer. Can't drink too many because of amount of alcohol, but definitely recommend trying it."
"D- Drinks very well. Good balance of flavors goes well with meat"
"D- A pretty decent bock here. Alc is hidden is hidden well. There isn't a ton to it, but I'd probably drink it again if offered."
"D - Definitely a sipper for me, but I could drink it all night. Goes down quite well and I could session it all night. Not as filling as I expected."
"The beer pours with a fine tan head sitting above the brown liquid with ruby highlights. The aroma has a strong prune, raisin smell with malt presence. The taste has the same characteristics as the aroma with the alcohol slightly detectable. Mouthfeel is rich and thick with low carbonation. This is a great beer for a winter evening!"
"D: fuller body might get in the way after a while...but, I always like a ""good"" doppelbock from time to time and this is exactly what this one is ""good."""
"Pretty good drinkability. Nice little sweet treat. Worth a try if you see it."
"Overall, this beer is just too sweet for me and probably not the best selection for a few beers while watching Sunday Night Football. I don't think I'll be able to down more than a couple in one sitting."
"Poured into a seidel. Dark clear umber with a nice thick tan head. Good lacing and retention. Aroma is freshly baked bread with a hint of darker fruits. Tastes like carbonated wheat bread. Accents of nuts and caramel, but really none of the chocolate and roasty notes that I expect from a doppelbock. Not quite deep enough. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, no complaints there. Decent drinkability but this one seems like a beer to pair with something rather than to drink on its own."
"Thats it."
"Powerfully sweet doppel. Aroma is killer very strong and hearty with lots of sweet malts and a dark fruitiness. Generous brown pour sizable head that calms down. Mouthfeel is rich and sweet easy going down with a nice finish. Flavor is highly malty really hanging on the sweet side. Nice breadiness with some strong caramel and maple syrup influences. Enjoyable but really sweet."
"Pours a dark brown color with garnet hues and a thin tan head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of molasses and grains. Up front flavors of malasses and caramel with some light coffe flavor leading to a stone fruit and raisin middle with a strong malty aftertaste. Medium body and carbonation, this is a mouth cleansing beer. Very smooth, easy drinking dopplebock."
"A very nice beer."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer for years, but I believe my pallet has evolved enough to where I perceive it a bit lackluster. I love the carbonation but I'd like more creaminess in the mouthfeel. It looks phenomenal though. I'll keep the remaining few bottles and slow cook some sausages and beef with it."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Filling, so I don't know if I'd sit down and have more than one or two at a time, but this is something I would love to have in the fridge to reach for on a fall evening. Actually- I'm drinking this for lunch as I review it; this can be a meal in itself! Hooray doppelbock!"
"Pours out a rich caramel/ruby color with a large tan head. The aroma is rich fruits and malts, some alcohol also. The flavor is sweet fruits and malt, smooth and the alcohol is really well hidden. 7.2%, but very nice. One of my favorite beers available locally, as with all of the German beers, crisp and clean."
"It's a Doppelbock. It's supposed to taste like one and this is one of the best. Nice dark brown color with reddish highlights, nice carbonation and a slight head that left a bit of foam at the edge. All malt and a bit of alcohol in the nose... the taste was exactly the same. Rich roasted malt taste yes, but a tad bit too much astringent flavor to be easy drinking. But then that's the purpose of a Doppelbock... so I sipped. And enjoyed it slowly."
"Drinkability - I'm a doppelbock lover and this is a fine doppelbock. It has a nice interesting full flavor like a doppelbock should have and plenty of alcohol so you don't drink too many."
"The taste is also quite nice, being musty whole wheat, raisins, hints of charred herbs, wood, and licorice, but the latter fades soon and a caramelly chocolate quiality becomes stronger, along with a little molasses. It has an alcoholic prune-like spiciness and starts sweeter before a somewhat drier, clean finish. It's tasty, nicely balanced, and highly drinkable, if not as rich and complex as some."
"D: It can be a tad on the boozy side, but it's still fairly drinkable. A decent substitute for Celebrator, I suppose, but I'd much prefer the alternative from Brauerei Aying."
"Hadn't had one of these for a while and so picked up a sixpack. My mother-in-law was coming to town and she likes malty, dark, German brews, so I figured this was perfect- fits the bill without being too challenging. She had a couple before I realized that these were 7.2%! They certainly don't taste that strong and it had been years since I had any. Pours a very dark chestnut, not quite opaque and with very little head. Nice estery and malty nose with some light spiciness, malt, warming alcohol, and thin caramel. For me, what comes through mostly in the taste is the thin caramel rather than a rich maltiness. I like my Dopplebocks a little maltier tasting than this, but it does have a fairly elegant profile. Relatively thin in the mouth, but very smooth and way too easy to drink. I'd prefer a Celebrator if I'm having it alone, but this does pair very nicely with food with its smooth maltiness."
"I've had a few doppelbocks in the past and didn't like them at all so I tried this main stream one... and my verdict is... I don't like doppelbocks. While this is the best of the ones I've had, I still don't enjoy them. A total lack of aroma except for a harsh alcohol smell and the taste is lackluster as well. Malty with more biting alcohol... just not what I want in a beer. At least this doppelbock I can finish unlike the others I tried."
"D - This is a very nice dopplebock. Smooth and tasty."
"This beer is definitely going into the fridge with the Salvator. Something I would enjoy after a long hard and drawn out week, and it's not a beer I would suggest to a buddy who has never drank before."
"Poured from bottle a deep brown, almost eggplant, very clear with off white head. Poor retention and lacing. Smell is of dark fruit (dark cherry, plum, raisin-ish) and a bit of caramel. Taste was pretty good too, better than I ezpected. Some of that dark fruit, mixed with some malt and I swear a touch of sweet chocolate, just a touch. Slight taste and warming effect of alcohol as it goes down but I found the mouthfeel slightly thicker and oily which I didnt care for as much. Overall a good beer, I'd revisit again as it only cost 5 bucks for a 6 pack."
"The taste is fairly complex. There is a deep caramel, almost chocolatey, flavor to the beer. There is a warming alcohol presence, not over the top, but you know you are drinking a fairly high ABV beer. There is a slight nut brown and raisiny flavor to the beer, overlaid with what is your typical malty bock flavor. There is very little carbonation, its consistency is syrupy, and there is a thick mouthfeel. The aftertaste has a slightly throaty quality, like you've had an alcohol soaked aperitif. This is an enjoyable beer worth seeking out. It has double bock written all over it and quite representative of the style."
"Solid depth with the mouthfeel, especially when warm, it's medium-full with a pleasing silky quality. Creamy and solid doppelbock to enjoy in a liter mug."
"Got a chance to try this one on tap while drug-running in Colorado. Just kidding! Sort of. *ahem* Off the tap this beer was a dark chestnut brown with some red hues near the edges. The head was off-white and quickly descended after the pour but retained itself well as a collar and laced well too. The aroma was mostly toasted malt but also possessed hints of nuts, alcohol and fruit sweetness. The flavor profile was full of malt richness augmented by fruit sugars. It was rich, chewy and nutty reminiscent of German candy but kept level but underlying hops bitterness. The finish was a little acidic but crisp. The mouthfeel was smooth and the beer quite drinkable. A great example of a Doppelbock and much easier to approach than many of the style."
"Overall, a very drinkable doppelbock, but not one I'll spring for again if I have a choice."
"D: Highly drinkable, a very enjoyable Doppelbock that I would love to have again."
"Bottle at Winking Lizard. This brew is a deep mahogany color with a medium thin light beige head that dissipates fairly fast. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt, molasses and a bit of plum. Medium body with a sweet toffee and malt character. Light fruit and hops are present as well but the sweetness dominates. The finish is sweet with caramel and roasted malt and leaves a molasses and brown sugar aftertaste. Decent overall, although it swings a little too far to the sweet side."
"Drinkability... well the abv will fool you if you don't check the bottle. It tastes like a session dopplebock but is a bit too strong for that."
"Copper color with a crimson hue. Head disappeared immediately. No lacing. Faint chocolate aroma with hints of licorice and caramel. Taste of molasses is fruity and sweet with heavy malt character. Thick and full-bodied. Optimator is a very tasty doppelbock but is just too sweet to go crazy with."
"Overall a little boozy for what it is. I could understand if it was much more of a flavorful beer."
"MF&D - Chewy with a creamy feel to it. Goes down nice, I'd love one of these with a good cigar!"
"I find the drinkability to be good, I think I could put down a couple of these pretty easily in a session."
"Optimator is definitely one of my go-to faves; sadly, this one was served a bit too cold and suffered in head retention and aromatics because of it. Still, an awesome beer, and one that always pleases."
"this beer seems not very complex but highly drinkable, though maybe a bit too sweet to have more than one or two."
"D - Very Drinkable. I very good dark beer that I could drink a couple of pints of."
"D - Quite drinkable, very pleasant abv in moderation."
"Carbonation was relatively light in this, almost like it struggled to make it through the malts. However this also seemed to add some character to it that makes it a bit different. I'm not a huge fan of dopple bock but I did enjoy this brew and would probably drink it again. It just kept pulling me back in for another taste. Nice."
"I could drink this a couple of times but it is too strong to drink all night"
"D: Not as sweet as some, so a bit more drinkable in my book. Really enjoyed the complexity."
"Not a bad beer, not sure I would buy again because it's just not my style but that's besides the fact. Moderate ABV would make for only a couple in a setting."
"This beer poured a dark amber with ruby highlights and a thin head. The scent is a little subtle, but I think I catch some sweet malt with some candy characteristics. The taste is an extension of the smell with a lot of sweetness, some caramel followed by a touch of hops and some alcohol heat on the backend. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer doesn't sit too heavily for a doppelbock, and I wouldn't consider it out of the question to have a couple in one sitting with some rich food."
"Pours a deep amber-brown color with a thick tan head. Lots of lacing left on the glass. Aroma seems quite sweet with some maltiness and tart fruitiness. A sharp tart dark fruity taste mixed in with some roasted malts and sweet sugary notes. A little sour in the finish. Not bad."
"Overall Impression - This is a nice beer. As I said before it isn't complex, but it is rich. I don't know how many that I could drink in a sitting, but it is very smooth. There is no real prominent alcohol or bitterness."
"D - Heavy, but enjoyable... Complex... I think it would take several tasting to get a thorough understanding of this beer... I may just be willing to do that given the high quality of the brew..."
"One of the first good import brews I ever had. It's drinkability and fairly high alcohol content hit me, hard, so this one's been a sort of joke around the house, and I've been pretty apprehensive to try it again, as I've stigmatized it sort of. A brew shouldn't have that kind of affect on a man, and I think I'm smart enough now to know my boundaries on higher alcohol brews, so I'll try it again. Pours a dark reddish brown with a resilient two-finger tan head. Once it fades an inconsistent, but chunky lacing is left behind. Smells of huge roasted malts with some caramel thrown in for good measure. Tastes malty and sweet with an undercurrent of hops and spice. Smooth and delicious with some roasted nuts in the mix as well. Carbonation is good in this light to medium bodied brew. Superb brew with just enough alcohol to keep the party going and just enough taste to keep the party interesting."
"Very good finish, no harsh after taste. I'd have another if I could."
"I was very happy to see a dopplebock as an option as extent of craft beer I've seen in Disney thus far is Sam Adams. Anyway, this beer is kind of average for a dopplebock in that the flavor and aroma are pretty standard, however not as bold as most. There is a malty, slightly chocolaty aroma and the flavor has a bit of a dry mouth aftertaste where a hint of hops is detectable. It is slightly on the lighter side of moderate body and gravity, so it isn't hard to get thru and doesn't weigh you down (not til the 2nd one at least). If you're looking for a bold dopplebock, this may not satisfy. However, it drinks nicely as a mellower DB while walking around Epcot's world showcase.. In a tropical storm, in my case today."
"Pours a deep mahogany/ruby color, short-lived sand-colored head fades to a nice collar of foam, and lots of spotty lacing on the glass. Smell is freshly baked bread, some nutty aroma, and a faint whiff of alcohol. Big, rich malty taste, very bready/doughy, perfect balance between the sweetness and a very mild bitterness. This beer is sturdy! Very creamy, carbonation is righteously mellow. Wow. This is something you could drink all year long, and with a variety of different foods. I'm loving this brew!"
"M/D - Medium body and carbonation. It is drinkable, I suppose, but I don't know if I enjoyed the taste enough to continue drinking more. I guess I just expected more out of the Optimator"
"Spaten Optimator poured a very dark reddish brown, with a very nice tan head. Smell was of sweet malt and a bit of hops. Taste was of sweet malts and chocolate. It had a nice bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel was good. Not to thick, but thick enough that you know its a doppelbock. Drinkability was ok. That 7.2 ABV hit me, and I knew I could probably only do one or two of these. Overall a nice doppelbock. One I will go back to."
"d: 7.2abv, really? dangerous stuff. an accessible doppelbock that avoids the overbearing sweetness that often dooms the style."
"Purchased at Kokoman Fine Wines and Liquors in New Mexico."
"Pours a lovely dark brown with a nice tight cream colored head. Aroma is of fresh baked bread and a hint of apple strudel. Tastes of fresh bread and big yeasty doughnuts with a good mouthful of carbonation. This is one of my favorite beers and i enjoy it daily."
"Jk"
"D: Having less than a dozen dobblebocks under my belt, I would say this one is not as sweet as a Troegenator and tarter and tighter in many aspects. Thinner and more complex in the style, I enjoyed and will pull for again."
"Edit: As I find myself ordering this more and more as a Falling Rock nightcap, I'm pick up some maple and molasses type flavors in there, too. On-tap this is one of the best doppels you'll find in the states. The bottled version isn't quite as rich, but it's still very highly recommended."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer.Small foamy head on a very dark amber body. Smells of a typical dark, yet very subtle. Not much else going on. Taste is okay, but the coffee was a bit much, rather overpowering, as was the alcohol. Beer gets lost in those characteristics. Not typically my favorite style, but this is okay. I've had better."
"Poured a dark amber-brown color which produced a 1/4 inch head but disappeared in less than a minute. No lacing, no cap. Man, what a disappointment in the appearance. Hmmm... Carbonation just isn't there. Aroma of dark fruit, some bready malt and a little skunkiness. Damn these green bottles! Taste is much better. Dark fruit, raisins, burnt caramel, slight nuttiness and good hop bitterness in the finish. Slightly sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Mouthfeel is surprisingly crisp and thick at the same time. Goes down pretty easily, and alcohol is well-hidden. A good doppel, but I've had much better."
"The beer is very drinkable, I would not drink many of these back to back but it is a good sipping beer with a lot of character."
"Poured the color of cherry coke with very little head - crystal clear, no cloudiness. Light aroma, mostly malty in character. Initial taste was malty with a hoppy finish and alcohol warming going down, which was a bit of a surprise with an ABV of 7.2%. Very tasty beer. Light carbonation, which explains the lack of head. Medium body. Very drinkable."
"Overall: Too bad the flavor didn't last. A good beer overall, I'd drink it again, but no go out of my way for it."
"heavy, and strong, its beertime turned mealtime... if it were 1972 and i was on a hunger strike protesting the olympic games following the munich massacre i would most likely be surviving on regular draughts of this"
"Was served in a standard pint glass, had a thin tan head. Smelled strongly of molasseses. Taste was of sweet malt, a slight roasted flavor, with a tiny bit of bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel was average, with high carbonation levels. Quite drinkable though, especially at 7.2 percent alcohol. Not my favorite Doppelbock, but still quite good, and an excellent standby."
"mouthfeel is heavy, bitter, a flavorful offering, slightly creamy, delicious! i would buy again since the price point is low :D"
" I dig the big malt complexity but the blend of flavors simply doesn't jive with my palate for very long. This is one and DONE."
"Definately a solid session beer, I could drink this all night."
"Pours out a clear brown/a,ber brew with a nice 2 finger head. Smells of all malt.Malty taste,,semi dry,,no noticable hop flavor/aroma.This is a pretty decent beer. Has a nice crisp mouthfeel,,and seems like i could have a few of these and not be tired of it."
"Smooth and medium-bodied with minimal carbonation on the tongue. Delicious and very drinkable."
"Poured from the bottle into my Pilsner glass (only beer glass I have right now). Brown, almost muddy, opaque appearance. Nose is slightly sweet, not overwhelming, maybe some toasted nuts. Medium body, very smooth, well rounded taste. Hints of chocolate. Could easily drink another depite >7% alcohol content. Excellent."
"12 oz bottle into imp pint glass. Very clear brown bottle with little to no head. Smells of malt and fruit- maybe some banana and raisin. Sweet taste initially with malt follow. Very light feel in the mouth and very easy to drink. This is a go to beer for me because of its easy drinkability while masking pretty high alcohol."
"D: Very good drinkability and certainly good to kick back with a few."
"I'm not one to drink a dark beer. When I poured the beer into a clear glass the head was bountiful. Nice thick white head about 3 fingers thick. It stuck around a while then went away. A had a very nice smell, almost a mild spiced smell is the best way I can describe it. I might have to change my position on dark beers. I picked this up because it looked intresting and it's a very interesting beer. I'll definatly buy this beer again."
"Notes: OK,so this was not exceptional or overly complex; yet I felt it hit the spot. Good silky tones and nice ABV. I could have had one more."
"Had at Moan and Dove. Dark but clear appearance with some amber hints through light. Immediate lacing. Very rich in malts, grains and nuts in aroma: very enticing and thick smells. Really incredible taste: rich but not too heavy, malty and hoppy. Medium body balances out its delicious dimensions from getting too extreme. Overall, an awesome drink."
"This beer was a little thin for a doppelbock but had a pretty decent taste. I had it chilled in my Warsteiner mug. Poured a deep milk chocolate brown with not much head. Aroma was of slight chocolate and some brewed coffee notes. Taste was thin but pretty complex with a good balance of chocolate malts with some mocha and bittering hops in the background. If I ran out of bread I would have no problem imbibing this Lenten beer."
"D = kind of threw me off with the heavy aroma, but I'm really digging it with some dark chocolate. one pint is gonna do me just fine for the rest of the night."
"D: Overall, this is an alright beer, though it didn't blow me away. There are better doppelbocks out there."
"D: Absolutely drinkable. The carbonation of a lighter beer, and the flavors of a heartier, darker beer. Refreshing. Will drink again."
"Taste has a good creamy texture with good carbonation, primarily malty, not overly complex with the flavors, slight coffee aspect, definitely not my go-to doppelbock."
"D- While quite full-bodied, it's smooth enough to have more than one in a sitting."
"A thick, cola like blackness oozed into my glass and left a small head and minimal lace rings. A malty smell of coffee and roasted malt (maybe cocoas) and some sweet smells also. A coffee, roasted malt taste with an overlying smoothness brought on by caramel. Moderate dryness on the backbite, as the alcohol is somewhat noticeable but doesn't ruin the beer. A tad simplistic but a solid beer worth trying and having a couple at the bar."
"All in all it wasn't my favorite offering from Spaten, but it was well done and something I'd consider having again."
"A tasty doppelbock. It would be easy to drink this as a session beer."
"Dark, brazen brown body with a white settling head; occupies the Celebrator glass well... excellent tracings of lace... heightened malts.... the sweet aroma is warming and inviting... smooth, medium-bodied with little effervescence around the tongue and below...creamy... the pitch of bready yeasts and malts are empowering, rich and rewarding... the end is warming... in the first of six doppelbocks sampled, the Optimator sets a brisk pace... the malts arrive as expected, balanced as the lion and lamb month they 're intended for..."
"Recommended..."
"Drinkability was fine. It is higher alcohol though. Oddly enough it went with my turkey on wheat."
"D = A good doppelbock, maybe a little fresher tasting and less complex than several others, but well worth drinking."
"D: Perfect for cool spring days. Strength limits me to one in a sitting."
"Drinkability is sneaky, because this is still a 7.2% abv brew. I read someone saying one could get into trouble by not realizing this and I agree. It goes down much smoother than a beer should at this alcohol content level and in the bigger bottles, it's common habit to try to finish it before it warms (though I still stand by my belief that this beer tastes better warm). All in all, an above average Dopplebock - 4s across the board."
"Bright and crisp for the style with mild acidity and a yeasty, starchy feel. Moderate carbonation and full body for the style."
"Somewhat aggressive carbonation, light-moderate body. Pretty drinkable, but a little more rough than the best examples of the style."
"Easy to drink, you can't tell it's ABV is 7.2%, could get messed up if you aren't careful."
"D: Dangerously drinkable at 7.2% ABV. Especially excellent for an import -- it stands up as an superb bock with exceptional smoothness and sweet maltiness."
"I must confess that I have not really tried other doppelbocks despite my strong affection for this one. I might re-review if drinking more of them changes my standards. On its own merits, this is a delicious beer, and really quite impressive for the mass-produced nature of it. Would love to try it really fresh someday."
"Overall impression: A clean, malty, German lager. Nothing over the top but true to style. Recommended."
"This is very drinkable and fairly affordable. When @ TJs, check it out. Then again you might prefer the sweeter, more carbonated Winterfest."
"A very good doppelbock."
"i purchased a pint bottle of this, since im a fan of spaten beers like their oktoberfest beer,pilser ect.. btu this bock beer was just way too syrupy to me taste wasnt that bad but overwhelming. this is good beer to try a few sips but after a while the strong syrupy taste does get to you"
"Overall a great beer, but one that you could get better and fresher from a domestic brewer."
"Although high in alcohol, this beer is very drinkable. A dark brown color with two finger head of foam. A strong beer with semi sweet aftertaste. Not nearly as bitter as I was expecting. There was no freshness date, but it tasted fresh enough for an import. I still don't understand why they use a green bottle."
""
"I like this beer. Very malty and pleasant. This is something to look for."
"The body is moderately heavy for a german beer and goes down real smooth. Can be a sipping drink or something to drink a big stein of."
"The flavors seemed a bit mild, but the delivery system was anything but. This stuff was thick! It hurt drinkability, but made for one beernique experience."
"Ah, the Optimator. Many many many many years ago, when I first turned 21, this was one of my first ""non standard"" foreign beers. Back when beer diversity was much lower, but Spaten could often be found. It's still a quality brew, although I could have sworn the ABV used to be higher long ago; I seem to recall that it used to be 8.9% ABV. In any case, a nice malty double bock, nicely balanced. Worthy of trying, although the Spaten Dunkel-Weisse is still the best beer they make."
"D - Not always my favorite style, but this one is fairly balanced with some bitterness, helping the drinkablility for me."
"D: This is as drinkable as a doppel can be. Even sweetness and fullness while the alcohol is warming but not perceptable in the taste."
"This brew is a classic doppel. Very malted and very tasty. It pours to a root beer color and consistency. Smell is like maple syrup with a slight bit of roasted malt. Taste is a very creamy and smooth with only hints of bitterness. This beer is a malt-mania of the brewing process. The carbonation seems light but is evident, it suits the creaminess, more would be too much. Spaten has a very good beer here. The sweetness may lower the drinkability but in my opinion for its style this brew is right on target."
"D: I've tried this a few times now and this just doesn't seem to agree with me. There's nothing bad here, I just don't enjoy this guy. Generally has a nice flavor, but a little too high in alcohol for me to want to drink this regularly for this style."
"Quite drinkable. I could finish a few of these with no problem. But it's lent, so I'm holding back."
"Pours a hazy dark color, very malty profile in the head and aroma. Taste is dark, somewhat sour malts come through, a hint of licorice, finishes dry not that smooth. Alcoholic but well hidden, very balanced and flavors do not muddle, overall a solid beer."
"D: I find this to be a fine example of the class, with quite a nice balance between flavours. It goes down so smooth and slick that it's all too easy. Perhaps there could be a bit more going on, but it's quite satisfying the way it is."
"That the mouthfeel is so good enhances the taste, while also making this perfectly drinkable. This is one to grab a sixer, enjoy three and cellar the others. A great example of dopplebock, very delicious, flavorful, and easy to consume. The nose might suffer from my impatience, I'm willing to admit. Yet the taste is so good that it will be difficult to sit and savor this for long. Enjoy."
" The mouthfeel is great. Medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. Drinkable enough that I had to have one more while sampling the beers in the world showcase. Was great with my pretzel and mustard too!"
"Good example of the style. Well balanced, but lacks the complexity of some better bocks."
"D - I could put back a couple of these but this feels more like an enjoyment beer than a food pairing beer."
"Drinkability: Good beer to drink, but I wouldn't drink more than 2 bottles. This beer is really really rich."
"the beer is a nice mahogany with a little bit of off-white head sticky head. it smells pretty fragrant with nice darker malts, some coffee flavors, hints of hoppy bitterness. it tastes of sweet dark roasted malts with some very smokey flavors. there are also hints of tobacco and other herbs. light hop bitterness kicks in during the lingering finish of the sip. the beer is thick and a little on the syrupy side (not for the style) but smooth. a real good indicator of the style. it has all of the smokey malty flavors you want with no excess. kind of the ur-doppel."
".5 liter brown bottle. Poured a clear reddish brown with about a finger of off white head. Huge malt aroma with some dark sugar and a little bit of noble hops. Fully bodied thick with malt. A pretty good amount of noble hop bitterness to balance the malt. Alcohol is evident in the finish. Good example of the style. Goes down a little too easy at 7.2% abv!"
"D-could def drink a six pack of this beer. My first time i ever heard or had one and i love it."
"Drinkability is solid, but when you have a pitcher like my table did, keep in mind the abv is 7.2%, play it safe."
"I am a sucker for German lagers, and Optimator is great. For some reason, I rarely buy them."
"If you get to Germany, it is readily available on tap, at least where I was stationed: Kaiserslautern, Germany. For those who want to know, Spaten means ""shovel or spade""."
"Don't drink and review."
"I really like this beer, but I don't think I could drink that many of them. I enjoyed it quite a bit more on draft, then poured from a bottle."
"D- Not bad goes down very smooth. Would be very easy to drink a number of these."
"D: Definitely feeling the 7.2% right now an hour after the tasting, and the sweetness makes me drink it waaayyyy too fast. Extremely enjoyable despite the fact that you might not be able to drink more than a couple at a time. Every Spaten I've had has been rock solid, and the Optimator is no different!"
"The idea of these Spaten styles being brewed year-round is a dual edged sword; on one hand, the styles and beers themselves are done well and are unique, in that they're available year-round, but also, doesn't it tarnish it a bit to be classified as an ""imported macro"" of sorts? While you ponder that, I'll have another Optimator."
"D: It was ok but not one that I would by again."
"This beer is a very drinkable example of the style. It pourse a crystal clear with a rapidly dissapearing head. The aroma is malty caramel, slight alcohol, bread. Carbonation is somewhat lower than Paulaner Salvator, which I consider a deficiency. The mouthfeel is somewhat thinner than the Paulaner too. Finish is a bit acidic. All in all, a perfectly drinkable DB, buty I give the edge to Paulaner Salvator for its better carbonation and mouthfeel."
"If you can find Spaten on tap there's not much better. It's good in the bottle too though. It has a very unique taste that's very German. It's so complex it's very hard to describe but there's some raisin, burnt toast, and nutmeg. You can't drink a lot of this stuff because it feels like a lead weight in your stomach."
"12oz bottle in Spaten stone seidel/stein."
"D-I dont mind the heaviness of this one,it was my first dopplebock, in my opinion two or three if the time was right!"
"D- just like salvator, man, this is like eating breakfast. it hits your belly with a thud and just...coagulates. ze germanz vay oof kepping eet varm ont unst cold vinterz nicht. (even though bocks we meant for spring consumption...who cares)"
"ive had two quite different experiences with this beer. to start off with, i love the dopplebock style. the first time i had optimator i drank it with a dinner of marinated london broil, stuffing, and spinach. it was awesome. as all the other reviews say, this beer is undeniably hugely malty. i thought i would have trouble finishing the meal but the beer washed it down and turned out to be a great pairing. the second time i had it was a little while after a meal and my second beer of the night. this time i found it almost impossible to finish. i thought it might get a little better if i let it warm up but that made it worse. the big roasted caramel maltiness was just too much. very sweet, and very filling. the alcohol bite became all too apparent as well which is never a good thing in my book. so this review is somewhat of an average of the two tastings. bottom line is this is a solid dopplebock, but dont let it get too warm and you probably wouldnt want to have more than a couple in a short period of time."
"Overall, this is a good quality doppelbock. A bit stronger than the Celebrator so it's not a session beer but still, if you can't find the Celebrator and are looking for a good doppelbock, this is a good example."
"Pours a medicore tan head with pour retention. But a great, deep ruby, light leathery brown mixture which light can penetrate beautifully. There is a little hint of maple syrup in the nose of this lightly smokey and deply toasted malt dopplebock. The taste has plenty of ruby tasting malts. Hints of dark fruits and even a slight hint of licorice in the finish. Very smooth a mildly sweet palate. This is a very easy to drnk beer beer considerng the abv. I would definetlly think of this as a session beer if the alcohol content wasn't high."
"D:This is one of the maltiest beers I have ever had. It makes it a slow drink. Almost like a weak Harvey's Elizabethian Ale."
"D: Overall, I found this beer to be pretty good, but not great. First drink surprised me with how malty it is, but like I said as it warmed I was able to note some other complexities."
"I could have three or four of these at a gathering, in fact I did."
"This brew poured dark and thick, with a head the color of espresso foam. Not a lot of aroma, but taste was toasted malt, tasty and tangy. Molases flavor notes were present and the finish was chocolaty and malty. Mouthfeel was soft and pleasant. Drinkability was OK."
"thanksgiving + snow = darker, stronger beer ; pours a dark amber color w/ a thin head which dissapated rather quickly, leaving little lacing ; a sweet caramelish/ prune aroma / w a faint hint of hops ; a sweet malty flavor, plenty of munich, not quite rich enough though, w/ a slight metallic taste as well, not as complex as it smelled ; a med bodied brew for the style, but plenty of dextrins to leave the flavor ; not a bad beer at all, i've just had many better bocks..."
"I could do with a bit more complexity, but for what it does, it does it well."
"I am a big fan of bock beers and this classic does not dissapoint. Pours out to a nice dark, rich color. minimal head retention. smells of raisin,caramels, fruits. Very good taste-dark bread, caramel, coffees. mm-mm! Mouthfeel is very palate-filling, chewiness that increases as the beer warms.Alcohol comes through to give that nice, warm feeling. nice beer to sip on at night with a book"
"Eric"
"The bottom line: I'm a big fan of the Doppelbock style, and while this is a passable example there are numerous others that I would take over this, including locally brewed options."
"Drink one slow and enjoy. A second may be tempting, but at 7.2% ABV, watch out."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass and got a nice head and noticed it quickly drizzled into a smaller creamy head that stayed steady with the drink.This ale had a very nice scent to it that had smells of raisin and plum. The color was a nice dark brown just the kind of ale I like. The taste was very good. I was impressed because I was expecting a little bit of bitterness aand I didnt get that at all. I tried this beer just on a whim and was not dissappointed. This brew is a 7.2 which is right up my alley. I will definetly be buying more of this brand if you can find one do yourself a favor and pick it up."
"The alcohol in this beer will definatly creep up on you if you're not careful."
"This is a really good beer. Pretty straight forward but very good."
"D-This is a long time favorite of mine and every time I have another I reaffirm that feeling. This is a very well made beer. Every aspect of it feels well thought out and executed. This is a great example of how good beer should be. The only reason I dont give this 5's is because Optimator doesn't ""blow my mind"" When I drink it I think ""Damn that is good...really, really good."" But this isn't the type of beer that makes you change the way you think about a style. It doesn't make me think that there isn't anyting better, but it certainly does make me realize how much better it is than alot of the crap that is out there."
"Drinkability- A great overall beer."
"Drinkability - easy to enough to consume, not as sweet as other dobblebocks, nothing too great but always enjoy this style"
"Overall: It has a clean quality taste you expect from Spaten-Brau. I could drink several Optiators. I enjoyed, and would recommend."
"Beautiful looking beer - poured a nice thick 3-finger off-white head that very gradually receded to a sheet. Dark brown body, just like I like 'em. Smell was faintly skunky; I'll blame the green bottle. The taste didn't really impress me - it was definitely malty, but not as roasty as I would have liked. I understand this is a doppelbock, so I shouldn't be too surprised I guess. The flavor reminded me a lot of Old Chub scotch ale without the smokiness. It's a very simple malt flavor, no hoppiness, no toastiness, just malty. This is my introduction to the style and I'm sure to find more complex brews out there."
"Drinkability: It's a pleasant middle-of-the-road doppelbock."
"Drinkability: complex flavors, smooth mouthfeel and well-masked alcohol make for an easy drinking beer. Eventually that 7.0% ABV will catch up with you. Love this beer."
"A truly great dopplebock, when you take into account the price and availabilty, its hard to beat."
"O - Good beer overall but a little too malty and under carbonated for me. Seems like it would go well with rare, red meat. Personally, I don't think I will be trying it again soon."
"Overall: Very drinkable, one of my favorite German beers though the alcohol will creep up on you. Pairs well with food of many varieties. Works well with chocolate desserts as well as with spicy meats. Accompanies a Bratwurst quite well, as does Spaten Premium Lager. A bock of the highest order."
"D - One is enough. Nice different beer, but not a session beer."
"Deep brown color with ruby highlights; large cream-colored initial head, which faded to a thin covering leaving sticky lace. Bubbles a bit on the larger side. When cold, it smells of carbonation, a bit medicinal, and then all of the heavy, sweet malt aromas come through. When warmed, the beer smells much more appealing -- a bit of diacetyl & some spicy hops begin to balance out the malt bomb. The beer also tastes better when warmer -- I think that the recommended temp on this one is too cold. More like 55-60, in my opinion. Caramel, malt balls, raisin, toffee all present. Classic doppelbock, and fairly drinkable for the 7.2%."
"I poured it into a pint glass because I my 1 Liter Oktoberfest mug is dirty. This is one of my favorite types of beer so I'm going to show that in my review. The color is dark reddish brown with a moderate and lasting tannish head. It gives off an aroma of sweet roasted malt and quite a bit of alcohol. I taste a mild carmel-like sweetness with the warming sensation due to the higher-than-average alcohol content. Very nice. Not too overpowering. Just right. Smooth and perfectly carbonated. Very drinkable for a beer with a 7.2% alcohol content. Very good beer."
"Comment: Nice beer that I could easily enjoy in a bar or during an afternoon watching a baseball game."
"It poured poured a dark brown color with a thin head that quickly disapears rather quickly. The smell from my glass to me isn't all that good but it does have its own smell. To me the taste also doesn't get me going its not bad but just not my style. Its got medium carbonation so its pretty smooth in the mouth. Over all I could drink a couple pints of this beer but would switch it up after just a few."
"The mouthfeel was light and it left a dry aftertaste that was only quenched by another sip of the beer. Drinkability is good because the alcohol is not aggressive at all. I would have another."
"Served from a bottle into a tapered mug. Poured deep caramel amber with off-white, rather quickly fading head. Aromas of green apple and brown sugar emerged with notes of drunken cherry and yeasty whole grain bread. Tasted of caramel and ripe plum, with a hop bite at the end and a sour apple fade. The mouthfeel was smooth, silky, and refreshing. Finished thin. Tasty and enjoyable, but not one Id go out of my way to find."
"I got this beer after having been recommended to me by workmates. This beer pours well, very small head that lingers a bit. Smell is sweet in that almost salty fermented way that I am not so fond of... Taste is much of the same... overly fermented sweetness. Mouthfeel is quite light however despite the heavy taste. This beer might make a good winter warmer, however I'll likely stick with Rogue's Santa's Private Reserve or a nice barleywine when the weather turns cold... Not a bad beer by any means, but I probably won't have it again due to personal preference."
"Could drink a six pack of these if you wanted to"
"Pours a deep deep ruby color(when held up to the light). Very nice indeed. Thick tan head, settles extremely quickly.Aroma is a bit of sweet caramel and grain. Taste is somewhat lacking. I had high hopes after the beautiful color and not displeasing aroma, but this left me wanting more. Taste is malty sweet, but with hints of metallic. Maybe it's past it's prime, hmm. not sure. Mouthfeel is not bad, not to thick, not to watery thin. But doesn't appear to be much depth to it. As far as drinkability is concerned, i doubt very much i'd try this one again."
"I just don't care for this style of beer, and of its kind, it is definitely the worst I have had so far."
"D: Immensely drinkable for what it is."
"D: Goes down well for high ABV, tastes better as it warms up. Does not fill the stomach up too much."
"Pours a dark amber/brown color with a small head, some lacing. Aroma is strong with hints of caramel, brown sugar and malt sweetness. Only the second dopplebock I've had. The taste starts out sweet and malty upfront and fades into a caramel aftertaste that is kind of thin. A second sip confirms the same, being almost too sweet. A good representative of the style but by no means better than Celebrator."
"This was equally a great find and surprise."
"This brew pours a clear black color, which has reddish hues when held up to light. The head is one centimeter in height, and recedes within seconds into sparce lacing. The aroma is of grass, caramel, and chocolate malt. The taste is of a lot less grassy as than the aroma. It is of caramel, and dark chocolate, with a hint of cream. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a decent doppelbock, but there are better ones out there. I would much rather have a Paulaner than this one. I would drink it again, but only if nothing better were available."
"Pours a beautiful rich chocolate brown. Aroma is strong, mainly malty, and tempting. Flavor is rich and malty with hints of toffee and a smoky undertone. There is not the least bit of bitterness. Smooth, very pleasing, this beer is great all by itself, especially after a meal."
" Above average drinkability for ABV, filling and satisfying."
"D. The abv is a bit much, but still a real drinkable beer."
"D- a solid beer that i love to drink"
"This beer hooked me from the first sip. It was a darker in color than i expected, but had a lighter taste than the look. Very smooth on the first sip and good to the last drop. The smell of the beer, is very mindfull of a heavy draught like guiness, but the taste goes more along the lines of an english ale, I would recomend this to anyone that wants to try it. I will be keeping this one in constant supply."
"Drinkability is excellent. This one goes down easy and tastes great"
"D: A good dopplebock, for me not up there with Salvator and Celebrator, but a very good example of the style. A great beer and style for spring and the cooler months."
"Not a bad choice. Optimator is quite representative of the style, but it doesn't quite stack up with some of the elite doppelbocks that are out there."
"In closing I really like this brew, and I recommend highly."
"D- Quite good. Not the best doppelbock I've had, but excellent for the price. Recommended."
"Poured a very dark brown color and head didnt last too long. Nice roasted malt flavor. This was one of the better doppelbocks Ive had. Taste is kind of sweet, malt, molasses raisins. I'm not a huge fan of doppelbocks but this was pretty good. Dont think I could drink more than two, however, so dont purchase this as a session beer."
" Well, well, well this may have single handedly brought me back to the style. I really love my German beers, and grandma would be proud. Spaten did not let me down, as I am now definatly looking forward to try a few more from this style. This went very well with hamburgers of all things tonight, it was just light enough to be sessionable, sort of, more likely drinkable during a hot night, but yet dark enough to peak intrest and really get you into the sipping mode for a while. Overall I am really glad I picked up a six pack pf this, I will be enjoying it very much over the next couple weeks. A fantastic beer from a great brewery."
"D - This is where this one shines. It's less cloyingly sweet than some other dopplebocks, but it's also less flavorful. In a way, the lighter flavor and mouthfeel make this a much better candidate for a session than a heavy ""chocolate cake"" assertive dopplebock."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Bells dimpled mug. This beer poured a dark brown color with visible carbonation and a one finger thick beige head that slowly faded away. No lace. The aroma consisted of rich roasted malts and a sweet caramel note. The flavor was mostly malty, with notes of caramel and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and lively. Just the right amount of carbonation and alcohol. Very well done. Excellent!"
"This beer is amazing and can stand up to some of the best beers I can think of. I got this at my local Publix, so it's very available, but that availability doesn't compromise the flavor. It's even better on tap, with the complexities of the flavor becoming even more pronounced, and the aroma somehow a lot better. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Damn good. Easy to drink for a dark beer...definitely a beer you can knock back a few of without getting sleepy (like from something similar to Guinness)"
"I don't know what it is about this beer. Even though it's only 7.2% ABV, it packs a punch. I good session beer - just don't go too far."
"Served chilled in a 250 mL mug."
"Poured into a Spaten tall half liter glass with a deep dark amber hue, a white head that that did not last too long. Aroma of dark fruits and slightly alcoholic. It has a lighter body and a nice bitterness to the dark fruit sweetness. The alcohol is not as noticable, but it does pack a punch."
"Drinkability- Easy drinking, and slightly sessionable."
"D - Impressive. Easy to drink and compliments nearly any meal. This is a doppelbock worth finding. It has a pleasant flavor and wonderful presence."
"Note: In some places in the US you can (thankfully) buy this beer in brown half-liter bottles."
"For me, other Dopplebock's just don't measure up. Some others are a little too bitter. While Optimator is very malty it isn't bitter. The ""ultra-malty"" taste may grab you at first, but it finishes smooth leaving little to no after taste."
"Gets better as it warms, or as I warm. Either way."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of a style that is starting to grow on me, it isn’t quite the best in the style, but it's right up there and it’s pretty good. It's one of those beers where the taste gets better as you continue to drink it. This is a beer that I could stick with for a whole evening."
"Poured into a glass stein... this is the darkest beer I've ever had! Very dark brown/copper color, tan two-finger head collapses quickly. Smell is a sweet, slightly burnt malt and caramel, and you can definitely detect the alcohol. Tastes of roasted hops, caramel and even slight anise and coffee, with a medium dry finish and some warmth from the high ABV. Goes down pretty smooth, but this sure is a change from my usual weitzen! The sweetness would probably discourage me from drinking too many of these, but I'm on my second so we'll see! Overall, much better than I expected from a doppelbock."
"Pours a cola colored aber with a decent amount of carbonation. Smells of fruit and malt, not as aromatic as i would like. Tastes GREAT, fruity and malty, even with the higher ABV, the alcohol is negligable, smoke flavors come out as does light chocolate hints. damn good beer, pardon my french"
"Spaten Optimator has always been one of my favorite versions of the Doppelbock style. Pours a beautiful dark copper with decent head and faint lacing. Aroma comes forth as a peaty, meaty, full-bodied whiff of malty deliciousness. Tastes like a sweet caramel apple on steroids. Sweet going down, going to light dry to the finish. Heavy, chewy mouthfeel makes this an exceptional brew, both in bottles and on tap. So smooth that extra care must be taken if consumed in a party atmosphere. Goes great with a hearty chicken mole or greasy enchiladas."
"Served in a glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer poured a deep amber, forming a thin 1/4 inch head that quickly faded. Light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is predominantly skunky, but light notes of malt coming through. The skunkiness seems to fade a bit towards the end. The taste is a mix of sweet and roasted malts. The flavor is thick and full. Coffee and a hint of peanuts. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, this is way better than I expected. If the abv. wasnt as high, I would drink this as a session ale. I have to say that this is the first German beer that wasnt completely killed by the skunky smell."
"A malty backbone paces the flavor but plenty of fruit joins in, particularly in the finish. A hint of alcohol spurs the whole melange forward. Typically sweet but more fruity and lacking the dryness of a lot of doppels that I've tried. Texture is thick and bready. The aftertaste reminds me of raisin nut bread or something similar. Definitely worth a shot if you like dark beer."
"This beer is proof that large brewers can and do make quality beers."
"This is a great beer, another quality doppelbock. i must admit this is becoming a new favorite of mine, and this beer is a great example of the style. YUM!"
"Poured from the bottle a dark orange-brown. Reddish brown in the glass with some lighter amber around the edges. The head dissipated rather quickly. The smell was sweet and malty. The mouthfeel was crisp and smooth. The taste was also sweet, malty, bready, and just a little earthy. Sweet, but not too sweet. Went well with the cheeseburger and french fries I was eating. I am trying to cultivate an appreciation for sweeter, maltier, less hoppy beers; and this was a good one to start with. Though it was different from normal for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"My buddy swears by this, and I had never had a doppel...not to mention the $7 pricetag at Trader Joe's seeming like a steal...poured into a pint glass (unfourtunately) and had a great dark ruby color with brown-ish head. The smell is very sweet, but a whisk of alcohol. The taste is all there, lots of caramel, in fact it seems liek your drinking caramel at a certain point of the sip. Slight roast to the malt makes for a very interesting taste. The mouthfeel is motor oil, props on doing that Spaten! The drinkability, for me at least, is fairly low. The sweetness just kinda puts you off that its a beer, almost mead-like to be honest. One of these babe's will get you feeling all warm inside, thats for sure!"
"Waitress told me this one was ""real hoppy," which I'm going to call bullshit on, but that's neither here nor there. Pours a dark brown, light white head, pretty appetizing. Scent is mostly sweet malt. Taste is lots of caramel malt, that normal bocky flavor, a little roasted coffee too (although very mild). Feel is medium to thin bodied, a little less full than I would've liked. Tasty, one that I'd go back to, although a little thin for my book."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and a bit chewy. This is a good beer and a great style example, but it's way too sweet to be sessionable."
"From its 500 ml bottle into a glass, it's a light bronze color. Smells of sweet bread (what'd ya expect?) and a subtle hop aroma rise from the beer. the taste of it is a little more polished for the style, no flavors will overpower you, but plenty of it to enjoy. Malty, with a hint of caramel, finishing off a tropical fruit flavor from the alcohol. Pretty easy to drink considering the style and ABV, as I enjoyed this offering from one of Munich's famous breweries."
"in the background. Mouthfeel is round full. A tasty example of the style."
"Obviously an old classic standard of dopplebocks. This one poured with a large light tan head, but that mostly disappeared within some minutes - no lace. Very dark reddish brown. Malty sweet nose. Same with flavor but with an odd salty character. Mild finish. Nice beer here. Balanced. Could drink a number of these."
"This and a Bavarian pretzel made a super lunch. A very good choice when looking for a doppel, and highly recommended if you're at Epcot."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Full and smooth on the tongue, heavy bodied and easy to drink. The brew finishes semi-dry. All in all this is a pretty good Doppelbock. I can easily see myself buying this brew again when I want to buy a Doppelbock that isn't all that expensive."
"D - I absolutely love this beer. One of the best values out there, and one of my favorite beers from Germany. Despite the 7.2 %abv I could drink this all night, and have on occasion."
"Overall: I DO know that it is a import macro, but it's true to its style and tasty. Not quite as good as my beloved Celebrator, but cheaper."
"Not a bad doppelbock, very malty. It's not the best, but it's good."
"Bottom line: This is a good Doppelbock that is worthy of a try."
"I'm not sure I would buy this again - probably not considering far more potable alternatives in the style."
"D: Nice & smooth, easy to drink, but a little too sweet and slightly high in ABV."
"A true classic in the Doppelbock world of beers. So enjoyable and drinkable. I especially like Spaten Optimator on draught at Jacob Wirth."
"Overall, not bad -- and somewhat complex for such a malty brew. But for a doppelbock, I'm going for other options. Kind of a beginner's beer. Get me a Celebrator!"
"Entry is solid and forceful, showing a palate-pleasing mouthfeel. Midtaste is malty sweet showing a depth of at least five malt varieties. The finish show a soft roastiness with little hop presence."
"I would buy this agian, but I would try it with my Bratwurst as many others do seem to do instead of alone."
"Nice, deep chestnut color. Very thin head on top. Smell leaves a bit to be desired. Very, very metallic and almost ""skunked"". Good chewy malt flavor. Slightly sweet but not overly done. Small taste of caramel and a tinge of bitterness. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Always has been for me. I wonder how fresh this bottle is. Still a great beer-I always pick it up when I see it in a store."
"Drinkability: No complaints here."
"Quite drinkable. I'd drink it with a big Bratwurst. Dry and roasty, and just above average IMO."
"Not a bad beer, but doppelbocks aren't my favorite style. Very easy drinking brew."
"Very drinkable and one of my favorite dark German beers."
"Pours dark red-brown with strong tones of magenta and copper. Nice, thick beige-colored head; long lasting with thick lacing. Strong, warm nose of molasses, toffee, vanilla, and spices; a hint of tobacco and alcohol. Nice sharp mouthfeel; medium body. First flavors are of dried fruits  plum, apricot, peach  and acidity, followed by creamy toffee and mocha malts. Mild hops and alcohol in the finish along with light fruit undertones, not bitter; overall very palatable. Thin, woody aftertaste."
"This is another oldy but goody for me, don't even remember how long it's been since I had this. Pours dark brown, very little head. Smells malty, tastes very malty, slightly burned with a bit of a hint of dried fruit. Overall it's pretty good, but not as good as I remembered, not sure what it is. Won't go seeking it out but can recommend it to anyone who has not tried it."
"poured this one into a pilsner: it comes out looking black , but when you hold it up to the light you see the beautiful dark reddish/brown color topped off with a thick tan head thats slowly dissolves and only has a hint of lacing. it looks like a great tasting beer, but its flavor lacks something, i'm just not sure what it is.It taste like roasted malt and it quite smooth on the tongue; there's very little crispness to it, it's aftertaste isn't too bad a bit dry and a slight hint of alcohol."
"Drinkability is excellent with this strong Dopplebock. This is and probably will remain as my preferred Bock. I might be in the minority, but I prefer this one over Celebrator... although, I've never had Celebrator on tap."
"Pours a ruby brown/dark caramel color with not much of a head or lacing on the glass. The smell is a really nice -- sweet, malty, spices -- a slight toffee hint. The taste is also sweet with a wonderful aftertaste. A beer like this really makes you realize how crappy a taste a Bud or Coors Light has in comparison. Also, this is a smooth beer considering the high ABV -- this could be a nice, sturdy session beer. Realy enjoyed this one and would definitely pick it up again."
"Chestnut brown color, with a big frothy white head. Strong malty aroma. Taste is overwhelmingly one of malt. Essentially like drinking a really good bread, with a sweet aftertaste that hides whatever hops are located in this beer. A very drinkable German, full of flavor and character."
"A very drinkable brew, would make excellent session fare. Could see myself living off of this some Lent. Perhaps not quite as deep or complex as the Celebrator, but perhaps more drinkable because of it. Would serve as an excellent introduction to the style, as well as darker brew in general. Will drink this one again!"
"certain doppelbocks at certain times of the year are just splendid. this is an example of good taste at anytime of the year. yummy stuff."
"Tapped at home. I may have the pressure a bit high, but it pours a full, dense tan head over a nearly black body. Smell is chocolate, prunes, and something lighter...lemongrass maybe? Taste is chocolate and caramel up front, the sugars receding into an, if this is possible, earthy but clean finish. It accomplishes this without being too dry. In fact, that finish is what distinguishes this from most of its dobbeplbock breatheren and makes it easy to drink quite a few of these. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, but with a silky substance. The drinkability? Dangerous, my friend. Having my own keg of this, I can say with some degree of authority that the light body and VERY pleasant, not too-assertive flavor combine for a combination that can easily lull you into over-indulgence. Good. Good, good, good, good good!"
"Drinkability was outstanding. For a dark, flavorful, alcohol-rich beer, this dopplebock went down amazingly easy."
"Wow, I was very impressed with this beer. Bought in a ""create your own"" 6-pack at a local store to try out mainly because of the recent film Beerfest. They mention the company in the movie and I thought I must try it. Appearance is a rich dark color and it smells delicious. Not much wrong with this beer, but I don't see myself drinking 6 of these in a night as it was filling and had a high alcohol percentage. Highly recommended."
"Cheers!"
"Promises more on the nose than it delivers in the mouth, but still enjoyable for its easy appeal and drinkability, not to mention its low cost."
"Drinkability - A good example of the style and well worth a try. I don't think this six pack is going to last very much longer. Prost!!"
" Drink this beer."
"Not for me. Your mileage may vary."
"This beer was a little too sweet for me. The alcohol and the sweetness were too prominent. There was a subtle roasted malt flavor that I liked, but wasn't enough to balance the flavors. A bit of bitterness would have been nice. It's a decent beer. But, I guess it's just not my style."
"A great beer!"
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a minimal head. It effervesces for a long time, and establishes little points on the side of the glass where it keeps moving bubbling from. The smell is predominantly of dark malts, much like other German beers of the same vein. The taste also has lots of malts. It doesn't take a definitive shape until about half way through, but when it does it tastes like many German bocks with a heavy consistency and a light carbonation that takes the load off your tongue. A good beer, although I feel like it fails to differentiate itself from many like it."
"This beer is a malt-lover's delight. It has a wonderfully rich and bready/doughy malt character that is definitely the highlight of the beer in my opinion. A recommended brew for sure."
"Overall Impression: One of my favorite doppelbocks. A fairly big beer at 7% ABV. Perhaps a bit thinner than the excellent Celebrator dopplebock. Very enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel was smooth, rounded. I would not turn this one down but I would go looking for it because the style is not one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: I like malt bombs, but I can't drink them all the time. This one manages to be very quaffable even with it's sweet, dark profile."
"Full, slightly slick body. Very drinkable."
"Pours dark brown with garnet highlights, off white head leaves a ring around the edge of the glass and a large patch in the middle. Aroma is malty sweetness and a faint roasted aroma. Taste is malty with some roastiness, not much here as far as hops are concerned. Medium mouthfeel with average carbonation. Alcohol is hidden so well, it would be easy to session this, but it might not be a good idea...This is easily one of my favorites."
"D: Not bad. I'd have another, but would go easy due to the abv."
"Pours a dark brownish mahogany color with a small off white head. The nose is malty with some caramel, plums and a whiff of the alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and nice and creamy and smooth. Taste is much like the aroma in that it is a nice and malty brew. Overall, this is a pretty good brew that is recommended if you like Doppelbock's."
"Optimator, while earning my stamp of approval, is a tough drink due to the richness of the malt and the heavy sweetness  I definitely wouldnt want more than one of these in a sitting."
"am i the only one that has a problem with the name of this beer. it sounds like a name for a arnold schwarzenegger movie. this is a very nice beer, pours dark brown red color half to three quarter head with good lacing. smell is of sweet bread. taste is of bread and honey sweet and smooth. mouthfeel is light smooth not over carbonated. drinkability excellent, buy and try this beer."
"If anyone knows what L12261N means, let me know."
"On tap at Lucky Baldwins in Pasadena. Was served in a pint glass and appeared as a translucent dark brown, almost with the color of a standard porter. The head was a tan fluffy cap. The taste is a forseen maltiness which contributes a bitter and sweet taste on the palate. The mouthfeel is fairly light yet slick."
"Veyr strong, it says it is a barley wine, so something is missing here. The taste is evry malty, not big foam, but the colour is dark and somewhat coffee alike in memories. Probably the first Barley wine I had, strong but with personality. HAd it while chilling out from a rehearsal."
"Serving them up at Metzger's in Ann Arbor."
"This beer poured a dark cloudy brown with a little head. The smell was of caramel and slightly yeasty, the taste is malty and nutty with a hint of sweetness that is very well balanced. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation gives it a nice bite. Id consider this a highly drinkable beer that goes down smooth an mellow."
"12oz. bottle. Decanted as a clear, brown-copper colored fluid. Formed a large tan head. Bar got a sip. Aroma was molasses, caramel, and raisins. Hops were not present. Alcohol was faint, but detectable. Flavor was sweet, like dark, honeyed bread. Raisins and plums came to mind, as well as just a little bit of chocolate. Hops, again, clearly had a secondary role - a little balance throughout, but mainly present in the finish and aftertaste as a slight bitterness. This beer was lighter than I expected, with a body landing somewhere between light and medium. It was very smooth, almost creamy. Carb was light, but seemed appropriate for the beer, and you certainly enjoyed a warm glow from the ABV. Overall, quite good, but I would give the nod to Celebrator with respect to flavor complexity. This, on the other hand, is a little easier to drink since it is a bit lighter. ABV will sneak up on you..."
"I buy a 24 pack once a year and it works out perfectly... this is my last one and it is time to get more."
"D- Very sweet at start. You get used to it and as it warms something happens and it just gets A LOT better! I thought I would get sick of it at start but at the end all I wished was I had another."
"I am in love with this brew! So damn tasty, good amount of alcholol. Not too heavy, just right. I'm going to Germany for my first time in a week (at this time next week, I will be at Oktoberfest!), can't wait to see what it tastes like in its native country. This beer is a must have for any beer enthusiast."
"Pours a clear brown color with heavy red highlights when held up to the light. Good malty aroma. Huge tan head that shrinks down to 1/4 inch. Smooth malt taste with some coffee taste as well. There is a crispness as well (hops?) in the finish. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Incredibly drinkable (for 7.2 abv). This could be a year round beer ( a session beer for the more disciplined drinker). Good with food also. A very good beer."
"Poured to a dark brown with hints of ruby red, thick tan/off-white head that lingered and then reduced to decent lacing. Aroma was mild, but noticeable malty sweetness, with a combination of dark fruit and hint of nutty toffee. Taste was pleasant, and not overly sweet. Had a nice, smooth finish, although I was a little surprised that the alcohol never made itself known in either the smell or taste."
"Very dark brown body with no head to speak of. Smells hoppy and malty with a hint of yeast. Not as strong a taste as one might expect. You notice a little more taste on the aftertaste. Somewhat sweet, as well as sour with hop and alcohol notes. Not bad, Drinkable. But for the price, there are things I like better."
"Somewhat thin and lacking complexity. Things seem to be out of balance. The caramel malt and toffee flavors seem unsustained. Alcohol in the chest. Much more going on in the nose. The lackluster mouthfeel and lack of complexity leave this on low in drinkability. What started out promising ended dissapointing."
"Pours a deep red color with a thick tan head of small bubbles. Aroma is all malt. Caramel candy. Taste is caramel candy with a slight burnt quality. The burnt/charred flavor comes out stronger in the aftertaste. Not overly sweet like some bocks can be. Medium to full body. As it warms, the alcohol becomes more noticeable in the aroma and taste. Standard, by the book bock. Nothing earth shattering, but easy to drink and representative of the style."
"I love Dopplebocks and this one is great. Could drink it often if availabliity allowed."
"Drinkability  I had this with a brat and bread at Prost in Seattle with my good friend skyhand and boy did it remind me of the Fatherland."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Drinkability: an easy beer to drink, could make a session of it in the fall. I can't believe this has 7.2 percent alcohol. It drinks like a 6%."
"Taste is along those same lines: grapes, some vinous qualities, sweetness and bread, and a bit of a lemony quality at the end (with some puckering effect). Complex, and good. Alcohol spice is a nice touch. There's a barnyard flavor in there as well. I keep noticing different flavors intermingling with each other. I'm definitely liking the complexity here. I'll give it another .5 in the taste category just because there is a lot going on, and nearly all of it is positive. Good stuff here."
"Pours a dark brown with hints of red. Had a 1/2"" white head that disappeared completely and fast. Smells of chocolate and vaguely reminiscent of red wine. Tastes like it smells. Licorice is also present as is a hint of bitterness at the finish. Nice mouthfeel. Not as thick as I had expected. Great drinkability, ABV is on the high side but I haven't let that stop me yet. Overall this is a good, solid beer. Not something I'd go out of my way for but should the opportunity arise I would certainly have it again."
"Overall a very good beer. Rich taste and smooth mouthfeel. Hides the alcohol well, though you can feel the warmth after you've had a few sips. By no means unpleasant, though. Could easily be a session beer, though I expect the price would be prohibitive. Nevertheless: Good show, Spaten!"
"Bottle courtesy of Daalamar: Poured a deep burgundy/brown color beer with a huge foamy head with great retention. Aroma of banana is really dominating and greatly enjoyable. Taste has also some definite trace of banana bread with a very nice presence of sweet malt. Alcohol is very well hidden and sadly the body is a bit too thin. Apart from that , this is a very good example of a style that I dont have a chance to enjoy often."
"This looks nice. Pours a mahogany brown with a creamy sort-of-tan head that sticks around. Smell is sweet, roasty, malty, caramel, toffee, all that good stuff. The taste is all that you expect and more. So smooth and creamy. This is one heck of a doppelbock. Me likey."
"Drinkability: I found this beer incredibly easy to review: the aromas and taste were clearly distinct and very intense. Also, I imagine it to be great with desserts and red meat."
"Drinkability: A solid doppelbock with moments of complexity. The thin front palate and lack of earthy balance leaves this behind some more impressive doppelbocks, but the beer overall is one of the standards by which the style is known and defined. Good, solid drinking."
"A solid Doppelbock, and one that hides the abv very well."
"D: A very easy-to-drink, approachable dopplebock. Good flavors, easy to find, good price too."
"Overall: A good and surprisingly inexpensive dopplebock (about 8 bucks for a sixer, versus 2 bucks plus each for Celebrator). Not as good as Celebrator or Samichlaus, but a darned good dopplebock nonetheless. Try it."
"It's not nearly my favorite dopplebock but it's not bad by any stretch. There are several DB's that I'd choose to drink before this one again."
"This beer is a shade darker than sweet tea. There was a small head. The smell is of vanilla and spices. Smells like a winter warmer. The taste is sweet and malty with a bit of the alcohol chiming in. The mouthfeel is fair, the abv shows up here as well. I could drink this beer again. Average for the style."
"adios amoebas..."
"Spaten Optimator pours a dark brown with ruby around the edges and an off white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is bread like malt. Sweet malt dominates the flavor. Alcohol is definitely noticeable. Not really my favorite style, but this is a decent beer that is certainly worth a try."
"I thought that I loved doppelbocks after having a Celebrator early on, but after trying several other big lagers and doppelbocks I realized it may have been a fluke...I tried this one at the recomendation of a customer. Pours a dark brown muted mahogany with a thin filmy head and somewhat effervescent carbonation. Smell is hoppy actually, faint alcohol even in the aroma, distinctly german, with a sweet-spicy kind of mix. Taste is dark, sweet, full, domanantly malty, with the malt profile not as caramel dominated as expected, and overall mild on hops. Desirable caracteristics, and a bit sweet, with that alcohol note present and lingering. Mouthfeel is too overcarbonated and bitey, but medium. Overall this is good but not amazing. Better than Salvator though. Now I wonder if I'll still like Celebrator as much as I remember liking it early on? Doppelbocks remain a hit-or-miss enigma to my palate."
"Overall very good considering the trip it's had to take. I'm usually more likely to take an American brew just because of the geography of freshness but this one may influence my next selection."
"Great roasted malt profile. Slight hops are only there for a semblance of balance. Molasses really makes an impression. Recommended for DB lovers."
"Overall easy to drink, but far from great."
"Served in a tulip glass, this beer was a pleasing toffee brown colour with a thin, tan head. The foam settled to a ring of very fine bubbles and produced solid, yet short-lived, sheets of fine lacing. The aroma was rich and malty, full of caramel and fresh milled grain. The flavour had hints of fruit sweetness, but the dominant character was warm caramel and toffee maltiness. There was also a kiss of floral hops in the finish. Well-integrated, fairly low carbonation coupled with a medium body and light alcohol warmth gave it a refined texture. Quite a nice beer. Satisfying."
"Overall, the men at Spaten really know what they're doing, and this dopplebock reaffirms my high opinions of their creations...I've never met a Spaten I didnt like."
"Pours a dark maple syrup brown with a white head. Smells sweet with malt and some caramel notes. This beer has a good and unique flavor with good balance and a very small bitter sweet finish. It is medium in body with an average amount of carbonation, and a decent mouthfeel. This was a good brew, worth checking out, not something I would seek out though, or pay to much for. Enjoy!"
"This is a classic beer on either side of the Atlantic."
"Notes: A solid dopplebock, but I've had better (Samuel Adams, for one). Not quite enough heft for me."
"Overall it is a lighter doppelbock but that makes it very drinkable too. The alcohol is not noticable. Not the best of the style that I've had, but still a good beer. Maybe the most sessionable Doppelbock I've had."
"This is a drinkable beer. Its a bit heavy on the ABV to have more than a couple in a sitting, but its a tasty brew with a lot of flavor. I think this would be a good fall and winter beer, and Ill cellar three bottles until then."
"Very dark brown, not quite see through, with a reddish tint to it. Large bubbly, perfect head. Quite tart, yeasty and malty smell, very deep with a lot going on. The first note I wrote down was ""So fruity it's outrageous," and it was. There is a noticable fresh, toasted grain malt flavor, but the taste is dominated by fresh fruit, mainly rasberries and other brambles at first, but the finish reveals even more flavors, apple, plum, dark grapes, and I don't even know what else. This was sweet and fruity almost even to the extent of a fruit lambic, but there was much more of a toasted malt character to set it apart from a lambic. It has a dry, slightly chewy mouthfeel. This beer is about as drinkable as a doppelbock can be. It's a little heavy, but it tastes so good you don't stop wanting more."
"What a wonderful beer. I like the Oktoberfest more personally however this is a great beer. Wonderful oatmeal like taste. Strong body. A good Doppelbock. I have found it to be very much worth its price. Strong ABV, and great taste, overall a very, very good beer."
"Poured on tap and into a Spaten Bier Stein. White head that created a good two fingers at the top of the stein. Retained the head for most of the stein. No apparent lace to be found. Ruby red to Dark brown in color. Faint brambly fruits on the nose back with a nice chocolate to caramel malt nose. No fruit presence in the taste, alcohol on the initial taste that followed by malty sweetness. Easy to drink considering the ABV."
"Very dark ruby red with a little insignificant head. Yeasty rum-like scent. Licorice flavor with the alcohol very noticeable. The mouthfeel is full, however towards the end it does tapper off a bit. And thank god, cuz for me this would be too over the top if the flavor lasted much longer. So while it's a good one-off drinker, I couldn't see ordering another in one sitting."
"Malty malt malt."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no freshness date. Was a rich garnet color with couple fingers head and little lacing. Not good as describing smells but this one says drink me right now. Nice sweetish smell. This not my style but I really like this one. Goes down smooth with little bitter aftertaste. Definitely warms the belly and can feel the high alcohol. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Since not my style it won't be in my permanent collection but definitely earns a home in the once a quarter rotation or when I feel like a darker beer. (3.0,RB,ML,O)"
"Overall I do think this is a superb beer. A bit overwhelming at times, but it has a lot of good things going for it. Everyone should at least give it a try, especially if they haven't had a doppelbock before. I'll definitely get this again, as I've done in the past."
"This beer pours a clear dark amber with a giant dirty white foamy head. The smell is a little light with only malt and a nutty aroma. The taste has dark fruit, alcohol, sweet malt, and coffee. The m/f is medium and well balanced. Overall, this is a good,not great, beer. I would give it a try again."
"Let me start by saying i have nothing to compare this to style wise. I'm not a big German beer drinker, but have been trying to expand my horizons a bit as of late. This is a very malty beer, with little bitterness. It is a bit chewy and the mouthfeel is pretty good. Smell is not strong enough for my liking, taste is good but not great. Overall, a decent beer, but I'm inclined to think there are better examples of this style out there."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours flat with little or no head. When put up to light a dark garnet color is revealed. Obviously high in alcohol (7.2 ABV) only balanced by a mixture of strong malt and medium hop flavor. Quite drinkable for a beer so high in alcohol. Very good. Easily more than two bottles can be had at a sitting."
"Dark brown with red hues, bubbly head, and some nice lacing. Nose is malty with a coffee kick, maybe some raisins. Tastes like raisin coffee. Hints of chocolate and roastedness. Mouthfeel is a bit watery but meaty enough. Pretty drinkable. Not a bad brew."
"Drinkability: A nice, decent, affordable, and the most readily available Doppelbock on the market. I'm just glad that since it was in a green bottle, the store didn't keep on a shelf in the light for too long. Something I might consider buying again, since it's almost everywhere."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Excellent, pinprickly carbonation that virtually disappears during the swallow... really one of the most noteworthy attributes of this beer. With so much flavor and such a light weight in the mouth, it strikes a match with German sausage and other light, but flavorful meat dishes. Nice beer."
"Overall, an outstanding beer."
"The finish is syrupy but still very smooth. Heavy even for a dopplebock. Not much on carbonation but still a winner. Next time Im at my liquor store, I will keep my optics on Optimator."
"Anyway, the only criticism that I have for this beer is the long and syrupy aftertaste. It has a nice feel in the mouth and the 7% is perfect for its flavor."
"Good thickness to it with a nice finish."
"Note: I was very impressed how similar this beer is to a brazilian beer called Kaiser Bock. The taste is very similar, and even the alcohol level is the same: 7,2 %. That shows that we had a really good doppelbock in the country for a long time..."
"A fantastic dopplebock, one I will use as a standard."
"This is a very drinkable offer. The gentle sweetness and the medium bitter hops work in unison to deliver a smooth and tasty beer. Spaten has had ample time over the past 600+ years and has made the most of it."
"Not all that great. I don't see what all the fuss is about."
"All in all very drinkable. Very different from Ayinger's Celebrator, although both are dominated by malt flavor. This is less creamy than the Ayinger, far more like a pilsener, and the balance is slightly tilted more toward the acidic."
"100th review = mediocre beer."
"poured a deep mahagony color with massive creamy tannish head. Left nice lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is dark fruity and malty. Taste shows more of the malt flavors with an initail strong hop presence that slowly fades to present a nice balancing effect as the beer slowly warms. Nice creamy mouth feel with a slight nate of alcohol at the finish. Nice and drinkable. Very enjoyable."
"While I've had better of this style (Celebrator comes to mind), I prefer it over other standard doppelbocks (such as Paulaner Salvator) because of its well-balanced taste and its covering of the alcohol taste."
"Appearance is deep brown body without the slightest haze; looks like thin coffee. Moderately thick whitish head that laces well. Dark malt scents, sweet with plum, caramel and hints of strawberry. All these come through in the taste as well, especially the sweet caramel. Very slightly bready and a hint of... mushroom?? That makes it sound nasty, but it's really just a nice thick earthy taste. Tingly and slightly bitter late in the sip. Sweetness is a bit too prominent in the aftertaste to be superbly drinkable, but the alcohol is very well concealed."
"One of these is enough...not outstanding...."
"The smell was mostly malt with a trace of chocolate. It tasted very malty with hints of coffee and chocolate and finished with trace bitterness.. It was creamy, but not as thick as others in it's style. It is a very good beer and one that will stock my beer fridge!"
"Goes down extremely well, not overly heavy nor too light, a satisfying and comforting beer. It always delivers."
"Medium body with decent cleansing power. Overall, quite drinkable. Not the best doppelbock I've had, but certainly good enough for most occasions."
"A bit watery in the mouth with a gentle warming as it leaves with a tad bit of a sweet finish. It fits it's style, I preferred the Celebrator I had yesterday over this one however..."
"Not bad and easy to drink. Just not the best of the style in my opinion."
"I thank the strangers in that bar in Buffalo for introducing me to Optimator. It's certainly not the best doppelbock around, but it's hard to find a better tasting imported doppelbock at this price."
"d- three of these are all i can drink"
"The Optimator pours a deep dark brown with some red. Small head dissapates to almost nothing...a very thin ring of foam remains. Aroma is sweet and malty. Taste is of sweet caramel, fruity plums and cherries, huge malty goodness, a little roasted flavor, and a hint of warm alcohol. Mouthfeel is great, feels like a full bodied strong brew. For a doppelbock, and especially considering the ABV, I consider this a highly drinkable brew. No flavor is overwhelming, and the alcohol is well hidden. I wish there was a bigger head on this brew, but other than that I loved it. Germans do know how to brew!"
"O--I like this beer alot, as my local BA bud (OrionsBow) would say, ""I could drink the snot out of these."" Super good dopple if you are into bock beers. Give it a shot. The ABV can sneek up on you though so be careful if you are easily effected."
"I've since picked up a 6 pack and have had 2 from it. I've enjoyed them as much as the first one and everything I noticed at first, I still see, smell, taste, and feel. Really a unique beer."
"Spaten Optimator is presented in a green bottle, but suffers no ill effects for it. It pours a deep clear reddish-brown with a fine light tan head. Aroma is great - some fruitiness, caramel, brown sugar, maybe some maple. Taste is malty (duh) but with a very complex blend of flavors: molasses, toasted nuts, some sour fruit.. Finish is surprisingly dry and clean, but of course there are still some sugars left over. Medium to heavy bodied, with medium carbonation. Very drinkable, but shows its strength as well. A classic beer."
"Drinkability: Not as complex as other doppelbocks but also not as sweet; as a result, much more of a drinker than a sipper"
"Appeared opaque and almost black in color with a tan colored head that was thick and left behind a touch of lacing. Aromas of dark fruits, roasted nuts, and malt were detectable. The taste was sweet with a blending of malt flavors with fruit undertones. Somewhat chewy and viscous in my mouth. Not as flavorful or as complex as others in this style, but still a good beer. I wouldn't want another one for some time."
"Optimator pours a beautiful reddish brown color with a half inch head that lingers in the glass. Aroma is quite malty, with hints of caramel in the nose. Taste is very malty and sweet with notes of caramel, chocolate and butterscotch in the palate. I could taste a light hop bitterness in the finish. This brew is quite rich and full bodied. This an excellent doppelbock and one of the better priced ones at that. $6.99 for a sixer of this wonderful beer is hard to beat."
"Poured from a green bottle with no date into my HB mug. Dark brown body with red highlights. A thin, creamy tan head that fades fast. Very malty sweet aroma, like a lot of caramunich malt. Some prunes and rasins in there too. Some noble hops play a minor roll in the aroma. I almost think I can smell a hint of mint there too. Full bodied. Sweet with a bit of chocolate malt and some kinda nuttiness. Finishes with a grape or wine taste. I wouldn't have minded to have another but I only had one bottle."
"Taste is deep, warm, and satisfying; it's very sweet and slightly bitter. If I could change anything, I would have just a little more carbonation."
"Good, but by no means great."
"Overall this is a well-balanced and smooth beer. It has a good deal of fullness, but is easy to enjoy at the same time. A very nice representation of the style."
"O= A beer with a well-known name and a long history, it's definitely one to try if you hope to know the classic beers. And this one definitely falls in that category."
"A good drinking dopplebock. I will revisit this one again."
"Good brown color with a nice off white head. Lots of lacing from this brew. Very sweet malt smell as expected. Slight alcohol smell with no hops present. Large sweet malt taste with milky watered down coffee taste and feel. A tad bit thin. This beer isn't bad but it certainly doesn't top the doppelbock list for me."
"D- This is a good malty lager that has nice complexity and really accents the depth of malt with some nice hops to keep them in check."
"Overall this is a highly drinkable beer. Fits inbetween a lighter lager and the heavier dopplebocks. Not quite a slow sipper, but not an easy drinker either."
"D - Goes down easily. Not too sweet not to dry, smooth and simple. A high quality O-fest malted up a notch."
"Pretty drinkable, but I consider this the low end of the dopplebock spectrum abv-wise. yummy just the same! Just didn't quite come together from the crtical beer drinkers's view point. Enjoy!"
"All in all this is a pretty easy drinker for a Doppelbock. I was surprised by what I perceived to be a lack of complexity on the palate. All in all not bad but not great."
"Drinkability: Deceptively easy to drink, which is bad considering the alcohol content of this beer. However, for this beer I consider this a negative trait, as I like my doppelbocks to be a little ""bigger"" feeling if you will."
"This beer would make a decent session beer. It is a little high in alcohol, but the flavor is not overly aggressive. This beer is pretty good."
"On tap @ Rathskeller in Indy. Tawny, carmel brown nearly black in color. Tan head disappeared quickly. Big malty nose. Roasty and robust. Big sweet malt flavors, slightly roasty. Caramel and toffee like flavors. Bitterness is held back pretty well, although there are some grassy hop flavors. Medium to full body, low carbonation. Pretty good dopplebock."
"I ordered this on tap, but they brought me a bottle, instead, even though th ebeer menu spcifically said it was on tap. They didn't even offer to bring me something else. Oh well, I drank it any way. This is the first doppelbock I've reviewed. Lots and lots of malt. The head was light-brown, firm, with great lacing. Sweet malt is almost overpowering, but good."
"Drinkability: This would be a 5 if it weren't for the slightly elevated ABV. A sumptuous and very drinkable brew!"
"this is a very complex beer, not too much of anything,hahaha this was my first review on here ever i gave in a near-perfect score lol! this is the beer that got me into beer so it will always be remembered, and its a decent beer, but experience has shown its nothing too special either. a decent dopplebock, drinkability declines sharply about 3/4 of the way through the bottle though"
"D: I have been impressed by this beer and could enjoy it often, though considering better examples of the style are easy to find, dont know how often I will."
"Yum yum. One of the first imported beers I ever tried, and I haven't had it in ages, though I remember it being one of the best beers I'd had at the time. It's far more interesting this time around."
"poured a rich cola color and formed a head that faded quickly with a little bit of lacing. The smell was of malt, brown sugar and floral hops. The taste and mouthfeel almost remind me of a pilsner, which make this an easy to drink beer. Its not as syrupy as Paulaner Salvador or as Celebrator, but in the same sence it does not have as much flavor as those doppelbocks do. This is Ok for me because I can easily consume more than one per session. Overall I think this is the most drinkable doppelbock I have tried but not the most flavorful."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a warm reddish-brown, practically reminiscent of coca-cola from a green bottle into a pint glass,left a thick and foamy off-white two-finger head, which gradually fell to a thin lace. Sweeter than expected combined with a heavy dark roasted malt with hints of caramel with little or no hops of mention. This particular Doppelbock is smoother than silk, although not bashful of it's alcohol content whatsoever, is exceptionally drinkable. I highly recommend this beer, and look forward to trying more of the Spaten line in the near future."
"Not as good as Celebrator, but also about half the price. I'd buy it again."
"It smells sweeter than the average beer, but doesn't taste too sweet and definitely doesn't taste bitter at all. Optimator has a very malty taste. A little sweet, a little bite, but fairly potent at 7.2% ABV. Once I start drinking it, I have a very hard time stopping. A six-pack is perfect after a hard day of work when your thirst needs quenching, and you need to get a nice buzz on."
"Overall, a decent example of the style in decent shape. I wish Spaten would go to brown bottles."
"Really a fantastic beer. MALT!!!. An amazing beer if you want something big and malty without having to have a hop attack."
"wonderfully balanced and not cloying in the slightest, like some doppelbocks. straightforward and delicious."
"For a higher ABV and richer, malty style, Optimator comes through in the clutch for its drinkability. Won't be too heavy on the stomach while still providing an alcohol warming that is right on. Give it a few minutes to warm up and the nose breaks loose. There are better doppelbocks out there, but you won't be disappointed with Optimator."
"Not my most favorite Dopplebock."
"drinkability: The alcohol was well hidden throughout; a good doppelbock and easily drinkable. As much as I love hops, I love me a malty beer."
"Drinkability: A decent Doppelbock for sure, though with the sweetness and the brew being a bit unbalanced, I don't know how often I'd have it among other Dbock's to choose from."
"Pretty drinkable. ""Goes down smooth," my girlfriend commented. Just not enough taste for me. More complex than most lagers I know of, but I'll stick with ales for the most part."
"Pours a redish brown. Tan head lasts just long enough. Good amount lacing. Roasted,nutty smell. Thick mouthfeel. Flavor is malty and sweet. No bitter taste here at all. Finish is smooth and sweet. I could'nt stop at just one!! I recommend this beer."
"From the tap, this beer has a much more rounded flavor, balance, and softness than is exhibited from the bottle. The aromas are soft to the point that they are harder to detect. Flavors of the malts seem softer...in the range of confectionate sugar, cotton candy, or marshmellows. The malts, still rich, toasty, and fruity are delicate with a nice earthy hop bitterness. These are way too easy to throw back, compared to the bottle."
"I think this one's under-rated. It's better than Salvator!"
"Im new to the Doppelbock realm, but this one was so sweet and malty that one was enough, and I had to take my time for the most part. Still have more to sample and despite the score, Id try this again given that the opportunity was right for something this full and sweet if for nothing more than to really give the style a worthy chance to be a part of my repertoire."
"I most certainly need to try more Doppelbocks but enjoyed this one very much."
"This is very savory, with a bit of strength to it--I wouldn't have more than one in a row, and the sweetness is more than I would like for regular consumption (a question of style more than individual merit), but it's nice to try this one, my first doppelbock since having a Salvator way back in the early days of my beer exploration. Quite nice."
"D - Nice balance of sweet and bitter with a surprisingly dry finish."
"Sure... its drinkable... I guess I just expected more... I guess I should know about what to expect from Spaten name brand brews... oh well."
"Plenty of malty caramel goodness. A touch of dark fruit, and subtle hints of chocolate. Herbal / grassy hops lead to a dry finish. Medium bodied, modereate carbonation."
"Though this one has some great characteristics, it's just not very versatile. Plus, it's syrupy mouthfeel might make just one or two of these enjoyable."
"a dark beer, more then its sister family bock´s; the termination ator give the germans to the beers that are more strong than others, its appearance is good, smell and mouthfeel had a touch of alcohol and roasted malt; drinkability is over the average; try with sea food and german snacks; 95% recommended."
"overall: this is a lot of people's favorite dopplebock, but i disagree. while this is quite a nice brew with some different qualities, it's still a ways away from my favorite for this style. there seems to be quite a big difference between excellent and good for this style in my opinion. good try, just the same."
"Mouthfeel is great, wet on the intake with right amount of carbonation, and a surprisingly dry, crisp finish. A little sticky but no more than normal for the style."
"This is a really good Doppelbock. Went really well with the Schnitzel I had at the restaraunt. I might have to actually look to buy some of this to have at home."
"Though Doppelbock is not one of my favorite styles, this beer fits the bill perfectly. Overall, this is a very good beer of this style and is exactly what I had expected. Wish I'll one day have the oportunity to taste it fresh in Germany."
"Mouthfeel is sweet, with dark fruit and mild sourness balancing out this malty mix. Very smooth."
"D - Very high, I've had this beer many times and enjoyed it everytime. It is a beer you don't mind having 2-3 of and a few times a week. Plain and simple it's just a good beer."
"While not an amazing beer, $8 a sixer is very hard to beat if your looking to get buzzed or even blotto off of real beer. For a doppel it could use a tad more punch, but its still a solid beer. Recommend to anyone who likes bocks and likes to feel the effects of alcohol. Cant say I dont."
"Pours deep ruby, dark, but fairly clear. A three finger off-white head holds very well with creamy consistency, leaving good sticky lacing. The smell is a complex blend of chocolate malts, dark fruit and german hops. Rich flavors of burnt chocolate malts and sweet fruits are very apparent in taste. The hops are light and indistinct, but create a fair balance for a doppelbock. Thin to medium body and solid carbonation, with a fruity residual sweetness that lasts long enough to hinder drinkabilty. Optimater is robust and complex, but the aftertaste becomes overwhelming after the first bottle."
"The mouthfeel is very crisp and carbonated, also stings a bit, whether from the alcohol or the carbonation. Also manages to be quite thick and sludgy. Very interesting. This is a very dangerously drinkable doppelbock. I would recommend it, even if you aren't a fan of the style, like myself."
"Pours a very deep brown with ruby tinges, and a thick tan head that dissapates quickly, dark for a dopplebock in my opinion. Aroma is extremely malty, with hints of carmelized brown sugar, toasted bread, alcohol and a light pear scent. Flavor has huge malt tones, carmelized brown sugar, raisins, toasted (almost burnt) bread, sweet dextrins and a light herbal and mineraly hops flavor also a light chocolate flavor comes through. Mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation and alcohol becomes noticeable in the finish. Drinkability is descent. A nice and surely authentic dopplebock but not my favorite."
"I could enjoy this one all evening if given the chance...will hunt this one down in the future."
"Pours a dark mahogany brown with a nice frothy off-white head, some lacing. Smell is grainy malts and with some caramel/toffee and hoppy notes. Taste mimics the nose, a nice if not unexceptional balance of malt and hops. Mouthfeel is bubbly and crisp, refreshing. Quite drinkable for 7.2%. I could tip a few of these back for sure."
"This is a solid beer. It may not be the best dopplebock that I have ever had but due to its affordable price it is most certainly the one that I drink the most, and it has never let me down."
"Pours a sexy deep brown with a nice big full tan headskie. Tastes, um... sickly sweet. Malts are big and full of sugars. All balance is shot by the sweet-tooth, alas. There might be more to this beer behind the sweet malts, but I'm too overpowered to find it. Mouthfeel and drinkability also suffers from sweetness. There are many many many better doppelbocks available."
"This happens to be one of my all time favorite beers. It has a distinct earth tone color and a great but not overpowering taste. This is the ""dark"" beer I give to my friends to prove to them that dark isnt always bitter or ""a meal in a can."" Optimator is one of those rare exceptional beers where taste, body, and color come together delicously and quite often in... my stomach!"
"I've had this both in 12 oz bottles and 500ml bottles. Haven't discerned any difference in taste between the two."
"Opinion: I REALLY like this DoppelBock! I like that it is so rich and true...and actually reasonably priced considering that it is a world-class beer. I may make some uneasy with this comment, but I think that I would actually take this over Salvator (the godfather of DoppelBocks). This beer is so flavorful, and rich in Melanoidins...it is hard to find another beer (under $10 a six pack) that can match this taste. A superb beer!"
"Pours a nice dark brown with a huge head which slowly dissipates. Leaves some nice lacing. Scents are of sweet coffee/malt. There's a nice sweet taste with a medium body. This is not a Celebrator, but true to the Doppelbock style. Still it is very drinkable and many can be had, a nice session brew."
"overall I enjoyed it and think it would go great with shellfish....pop some oysters and enjoy an optimator....yummmm"
"Pours a brownish red body, with a creamy tan head. Lots of caramel, butter, malt and molasses in the nose. Strong, caramel, roasty, malty flavour. Excellent mouthfeel - thick, creamy and very smooth. Not a celebrator, but a very good doppelbock on its own. Recommended."
"This beer poured from the tap into the mug a deep brown with ruby highlights, and a decent sized tan head. Wonderful sweet malt aroma rich with fig and sweet candy. The taste is like biting into a caramel apple. Toffee, caramel, and a rich sweetness. The mouth feel is smooth and rich, and despite the alcohol content, this beer is very drinkable."
"Drinkability is good, but the high end alcohol at the end keeps the score down a bit. I actually paired this with some chocolate cookies, and it went surprisingly well. I have also used this to marinade some steaks before grilling (a la the brothers' article on grilling) and it worked very nicely, although as a marinade it may need more spices to kick up the meat."
"Great with a steak, maybe if I'm in the mood for just one beer."
"Beautiful dark mahogany with a thick, tan head. It's smell is not terribly plesant: mostly skunk with raisins and jelly-bean sweetness. But to taste it is entirely different!!! I was astounded by the massive taste of a very thick chocolate. I did NOT see that coming! Very thick and delicious! What a lovely beer!"
" This is more that drinkable and above 55°F the aroma is awesome. Alcohol emerges with those toasted Munich malt aromatics. MMmmm mmm Munich!"
"I'll certainly buy this again -- even at a price of almost two dollars apiece this is a pretty decent brew, although it's not an everyday one for me."
"Pretty medium to heavy bodied with fairly assertive carbonation. Goes down pretty easy and is hugely flavorful in may departments. Not a bad doppelbock at all!"
"The bottle is sorta intimidating after reading about the double shovels and how it a was going to kick my ass. It beer pours a really nice dark brown, with a good head that shrinks quickly. The smell is interesting, most noticeable to me was bread but also noted is a hint of chocolate, sweet smelling.The taste iis sweeet malty as hell. some hoppage. But the hops come in later. malty malty malty.The mouthfeel is great, medium yet sorta stickey. Damn the alcohol just kicked in on about the 4th sip. I really do like this, I was suprised because I had it before on tap at McGreggors and really wasn't feeling it. I found it easier to drink at the begining and although I really do enjoy it I wouldn't have more than 2 a night."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but I am glad it was part of a mix a six and not a full six pack in my fridge."
"A very nice doppelbock, although I feel it has lost a bit since the takeover."
"12 oz. green bottle with no freshness date - served in a pilsner glass. Pours a chestnut color with a 1 finger, tan head that leaves some lacing. There is a fairly active carbonation and the head consists of very small bubbles. Some dark fruits, molasses, caramel, nuts, hops, and skunk (from the green bottle?) in the aroma. It is very thick with crisp carbonation, coating the mouth well and leaves a warming sensation from the alcohol. There are lots of sweet malts that aren't cloying, and there are leafy/grassy hops with a nice bitterness. There's also notes of caramel, molasses, and nuts but there is a noticeable skunkiness that lowers the taste points. Even though I drank this pretty quickly, I wish it had less skunk flavor because it seems a bit macroish."
"The smell is nice, with caramel coming through strong. Toasted malts and caramel dominate the taste, with hops coming through in the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly rich, yet the beer remains easy to drink."
"A very nice bock, smooth and very drinkable."
"Go Spaten!"
"Pours three quarter finger head that fades slowly. Strong malty aroma as well as alcohol and caramel apparent to the nose. The strong malt is wonderfully balanced with a generous amount of bittering making this strong beer quite drinkable. Mmm... taste the caramelly malt! Not quite as heavy a mouth feel as I expected from this malt packed German beer. I find the slightly lighter mouthfeel to be a positive for this beers drinkability."
"Really good brew to enjoy anytime during the year. Heavy enough to warm you in the winter, and tasty and crisp enough for a summertime lawn mowing job."
"(I noticed tap reviews for this are less enthusiastic and all over the board- I guess I'll stick to the green bottle.)"
"Had on tap at the Southside Saloon. This was the yeastiest tasting Doppelbock I've ever had. That almost made it undrinkable, but it wasn't. The other flavors were tasty, and had an odd fruitiness to them. I think this is an overrated doppelbock. I'll stick with my Troegenator thank you very much."
"Last swigs: Malty grain lager-esque doppel. Quite clean and easy."
"I definitely would recommend this beer for anyone who is interested in the Doppelbock style. If it was this good at the Disney version of Germany, then who knows how good it actually is in the old country..."
"Pours a perfect ruby with millions of tiny bubble streaming up. Slightly frothy head, and moderate lacing. Smell is grainy, not the malt bomb that I had hoped for in this one. Taste is exceptional, sweet carmelly malts with no alcohol burn whatsoever. Mouthfeel is thick and lush, coating your mouth. Drinkability... I think this is one of the best dopplebocks out there. A bit heavy for daily drinking, but a nice treat to pick up."
"What do you add to a beer reviewed almost 300 times? Not much, so this is a kinda personal review: Poured a good, light mahogany with 1 tan head. Aroma was sweetish malt. Yup, tasted great, malty, medium bodied. Very lite with hops during and in the finish  overall just a tush too sweet. Texture was heavier than the color suggested  and yeah, quite a nice alcohol buzz can be expected. Six pack of these would lead to trouble"
"Slàinte!"
"Drinkability is pretty good though the ABV holds it back more than it should for 7.2 %."
"Comments - This is a decent doppelbock, but I prefer others over this one. This one should still be sampled."
"Pours a dark ruby/brown and has a white head. It has a nice sweet malty aroma, raisins, caramel and toffee... Not bad for a German macro offering. It is not a world beater, but it is a solid Doppelbock. I couldn't say anything bad about it at all. I would buy it again, but not if there was any Salvatore to be had."
"Overall, a good doppelbock that holds its own with the rest of them."
"This beer pours out a reddish brown with just a little head. Crisp malt aroma. Very sweet malty flavor, but a high crabonation prevents the beer from being cloying. The carbonation makes the beer seem spicy, which is very pleasant in this beer. It could almost be described as refreshing, which is interesting, given the style. A good once in a while beer for me."
"flavor is very malty, little roasty, more of the dried dark fruit (dates), bitterness is more present, caramal. alcohol."
"A solid draft brew..on tap at the Munich Haus in Chicopee, MA. Poured a nice medium amber with decent head and lacing. Smell was mainly rounded malts witha hint of alcohol...very inviting. Taste was simiilarly malty with a hint of alcohol. Very smooth for the high abv. Mouthfeel was medium with a nice creamy quality. Very easy on the drinkability scale."
"This doppelbock is a very dark, slightly-reddish brown beer with a small to medium sized off-white head that mostly diminished except for a thin layer that lingered for most of the way down and left a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is heavy of roasted malts and a caramel sweetness, which Im a sucker for, but it was also slightly fruity. Taste follows suit, being dominated by the sweetness of the roasted malts, but there was also a light hops presence and a hint of grape or currant. The finish is wonderful and lingering with a nice hops kick and a little alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with low to average carbonation. I adore this beer and think there almost needs to be separate ratings for bottle and draught. I'd give it a 5 for taste if only it tasted consistently as good as it does at Schnitzel's."
"A very average brew. A dark amber appearance with a great head that fades slowly and that's it. No smell, no real taste. Carbonation spice and medium-light mouthfeel. Some malt in aftertaste. Nothing offensive I can say, disapointed. Maybe its better on tap with a spicy lunch."
"Pours dark brown with a deep ruby tinge. A little creamy head with very good lacing throughout. Smells of roasted sweet malts, some fruit undertones, and slight hops. Taste is very good with the malts being slightly sweet, caramel and roasty. Fruit notes are also noticeable that give the brew an extra bit of sweetness. Hops round out the beer to create a quite solid beer."
"Off tap, served in an Optimator mug. This beer poured a deep rubied brown color, with a 2 finger head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is nice caramel with a touch of roasted character and a hint of fruity esters. The flavor was nutty and roasted with a sweet caramel roaring in as well. Just a hint of bitter comes through on the finish. The feel was moderate to thick, very filling and very nice. I enjoyed this beer, though it will never be one of my favorites, as the style just doesn't suit me."
"On-tap poured into a Spaten half-liter dimpled mug. It pours a dark ruby red, almost black color with two fingers of head that die down quickly. There is just a touch of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly sweet and malty. Lots of caramel, a touch of honey, and just a hint of alcohol. No hops in sight. The taste is also fairly sweet. Lots of chewy roasted malts and caramel flavors. Just a hint of alcohol in the finish to keep you in check. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, yet smooth. The drinkability suffers some due to the alcohol. A nice doppelbock."
"When I found out that this was a dopplebock I thought good because I lke dopplebocks and hoping it would be like my fravorite beer, celebrator.but no . but still a good beer. poured a light granet color with a light tan head. aroma, malts, yeast, chocolate, some alcohol, and a nice sweet sourness, hints of toffee. flavor, roasted malts, dark fruits, maple syrup, molasses, raisins."
"Drinkablity was nearly impossible, i finished the 5oz but it was indeed a chore, will not have again any time soon and can't in good conscience recommend this brew"
"Drinkability, late night typing a review or a letter, or reading a good book. Absolutely perfect."
"Optimator is a quality beer at that, it pours a nice copper color with orange hints, a gorgeous tan head expands as you pour. The smell is of honey and caramel and deep roasted malts. The taste is very syrupy, caramel and roasted honey up front and a light grain after tone, not bad but a little to malty for my tastes, good solid beer however."
"The taste was mostly sweet from the malts with a slight nuttiness to it. A hint of fruits also in the middle of the sip thats almost offset when the hops kick in. Not that its a big kick from the hops but it does take an edge of the sweetness which I liked."
"Spaten Optimator is a good-very good doppelbock, but doesn't quite rise to the heights of my two latest beers in the style (Hooker Liberator and Sam Adams Double Bock). If you like doppels though, Optimator more than suffices. Just don't make the mistake of drinking it too cold."
"Large tan head on the pour, over an inch tall, dense and frothy. Body is opaque, blackish brown, and bright crimson when held to the light. Smell: prune juice, toasted sour dough bread, raisins; thick and rich. Taste: opens with a bitter-shelled blast of prune-like tartness all over my palate, followed by a raspy bitterness that takes center-stage, flanked brilliantly by the bright fruitiness. The finish is a thin, mildly puckering citrus rind bitterness, with the fading sweetness of dark fruits in the background. Middling carbonation. Mouthfeel like whole milk, really perfect. I picked this up on the cheap and I'm very impressed."
"Overall, I wouldn't say I think this is a great or fantastic beer. However, I did enjoy the 6 pack I bought and I'll probably buy it in the future. It's very solid and interesting, plus the price is very reasonable."
"This brew tastes best at warmer temps. 60-65 degrees."
"good dopplebock, and not a bad price to boot. recommended."
"Froth of initial head sets up nicely in the stein to settle down into a filmy, oracle-inspiring covering. Light caramel hue and clear as a cloudless, autumn day. Buttery, velvet malt aroma with just an echo of roastiness in there. The buttery aspects noted on the nose are not as pronounced on the tongue; the malt pulls through with a nice floater of treacle that does not coat the mouth unnecessarily. Crisp and clean, I would exterminate this offering many times over."
"Poured a clear, deep red beer with a thin off-white head that wouldn't retain itself even when i swirled the last bit of beer in the bottle then dumped it into the glass. Aroma is of rich sweet dark caramel and no sulfur to be detected means the lager yeast was treated correctly. The taste is an initial blend of deep caramel sweetness, munich malt roastiness, and a subtle noble hop bitterness which segues to an even malt flavor and finishes with a touch of anise, more malt flavor, and an alcoholic warmth. Mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired however as it dosent lend a smoothness to the beer. The carbonation is artifical and it leaves a harsh carbonic bite which i dislike in a lager. Overall not too drinkable as the higer alcohol isn't compensated by smoothness and the beer dosen't lend itself to truly exemplify the rich body of the Bock style."
"Notes: This was not very impressive to me. I had both the Ayinger Celebrator and Samichlaus in the same weekend, and this one impressed me as being average, almost bock-like in its maltiness, certainly not up to dopplebock standards."
"Since there are already 200+ reviews for this beer you won't mind that I not detail the nuances of Optimator. I can say this though: fruit cake. Dense and nutty with sweet brandied fruit that coats the inside of your face like an hateful older brother twisting your arm to the point of dislocation. I wouldn't turn one down if extended."
"The beer was presented in a tulip glass. It was a dark ruby with a fingers worth of tan head. The aroma was amazing. You could smell tanin and dark cherry. The promise of the smell was compelling and I could hardly wait to taste. I brought it to my lips and got a little malt and fruit. That was it. Nothing terrible, but nothing great was happening. Maybe I just put too much anticipation behind it. But, anyway you cut it I was not impressed. The feel was simply extremly dry. Not a beer I would duck if offered, but I don't see me giving up Aventinus for it."
"Flavor was overall maltiness with some chocolate notes. Very well balanced and smooth."
"Pours a brilliantly clear ruby-amber color when held up to the light, otherwise a drab deep amber. It is topped by a frothy tan head that is held up by a medium-low carbonation. The aroma is a bit lighter than I was expecting, it is malty and bready with notes of molasses, caramel, and a light sweetness. The beer is malty sweet with a smooth finish that has a hint of dark malt character reminiscent of chocolate. The beer is quite a bit more tasty than the aroma suggests. Somewhat light on the palate, though only in so much as I was expecting it to be a bit thicker, it is actually about medium full in the body. In the end this seems to be lacking a little bit of malt character, though it is quite tasty, it just does not distinguish itself enough from a ""standard"" Bock."
"-Oelergud"
"Clear plastic pint cup presentation. Pleasing 1/2"" beige head over the deeply reddish brown brew. Aroma is deeply of grain, with a slight alcohol presence notable. Taste is dominated by malts, and a nice warming feelign as it goes down. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. An excellent brew."
"Poured out a dark brown color with a nice tan head which went away to lacing after a while. Smell consisted of nice, big, juicy malts with a slight toastiness to it. Some nuts and fruits could be found in the background to make the smell wonderful. Taste was good. Malts and more malts attack the palate. Has that chewy texture to it, but the beer is not that heavy or big bodied in anyway. There's some sweetness to it, but not cloying one bit. Medium-ish body with the perfect amount of carbonation mixing in. Just a wonderful doppelbock which should be on hand that all times."
"Flavor starts with a hint of tang, but quickly settles down to a smooth, rich, caramel malt. Something of a one-note beer, but what a note it is! Medium-bodied. Incredibly smooth, and not a bit cloying. This is amazingly drinkable for something this sweet. A classic."
"Overall: A good doppelbock. Although I've had limited exposure to this style, this is the best I've tried so far."
"A good beer, with lots of warming alcohol, but with less malt character than my favorite doppelbocks."
"Deep cherry coloa in color, with 1/2"" of foamy off-white head. Smells deeply of malt, brown sugar and alcohol. Taste is dense with roasted, sugary malts. Body is very chewy and full, excellent mouthfeel. Alcohol is not overpowering, but it goes together very well with the maltiness, and slight hops. Worth a try, I'd even get it again."
"A nice rich, dark beer with a small, creamy head. Malty, bready taste with noticeable alcohol, but not to the point of detracting. The Germans are the rightful masters of this style and this is a fine example. This is an excellent warmer during a skiing break."
"Dark cola-colored brew, with a bubbly head following a nice cascade of carbonation. Light caramel malt scent. For the taste, it is mainly a caramel, slight toast malt scent. Some bitter hop presence, but nothing earth shattering. Med/full bodied, some creaminess to the feel. Not my favorite doppel, but overall a pretty solid brew."
"Poured a deep red/bronze colour with almost no head. Only a thin haze remained and remained throughout deinking it. The smell is quite sweet and malty. I saw where someone else had said 'butterscotch', and I'd have to agree. The taste is a bit sweet as well with a good bit of malt on the finish. A tiny, tiny bit of hops is slightly detectable. The mouthfeel is heavy and thick, easy to drink, but thick. Overall, I thought it was quite nice. I'd buy it again."
"Dark brown with a low whiteish head. Sweet malty scent, foretelling heavy, syrupy caramel with tones of butterscotch. Leaves but a hint of hops on the breath. Not all that interesting, and as I slowly sip it, it seems to grow duller and duller."
"Overall, probably the best dopplebock I've had and one that will lead me to try the style more often."
"Overall, there isn't much to say about this beer. Optimator is about what you'd expect from a company like Spaten, no big surprises here. It gets the dopplebock style down really well, but doesn't rise above the level of being very good."
"Reddish brown body is the color of cola with a fizzy beige head that is not around for very long. The aroma is roasted cracked grains and dry fruits mixed with powdered chocolate. The taste is sweetly malty, fruity (figs, raspberries, and apple), musty, and faintly smoky. The flavors dont meld together quite well and mouthfeel is one step on the harsh side of creamy. The alcohol is not well covered, but is not strong enough to be a distraction. Hop bitterness is well in check, and only presents itself in the dry aftertaste. A good deal at under $2 for a 500 ml. bottle at Greens on Buford Highway."
"Ive had this beer often, and Ive found it to be solid and consistent. Its enjoyable and quite good, but not up to the standards of a lot of other doppelbocks."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly oily. It clings a bit, and might be better suited to sampling with a good meat or cheese dish than alone. Definitely something to keep in your regular rotation. Bock fans will rave; the rest of us will simply give the thumbs-up. Danke schon, Spaten!"
"The body is the cola/ruby mixture. Theres not a lot of head. The smell has a bit of blanched corn and brown sugar with a slight bit of prunes. The flavor brings in a bit of toffee and chocolate. This was one of the beers we passed around the table at 5 Seasons July 1st party in Atlanta to celebrate the Georgias newly raised ABV limit on beer."
"Sweet malty characteristics with an undertone of slightly burnt caramel. This is smooth well balanced brew. Definitely a go to beer."
"When served alongside authentic German cuisine this beer is a little bit of rapture."
"Feel is about medium with a thicker sticking finish, a bit subdued and slim. Not as thick the whole way through nor as creamy as I would've liked to seen. This seemed just a bit weaker then I imagined it would be. Expectations sometimes are never met. Still good, just not great; so I'd have this again."
"very drinkable as i buy this one all the time. If your planning on a German meal with brats etc. buy this one. it pairs up perfectly."
"This beer went so well with bold tastes of the German food, I just had to have another half litre."
"Again, nothing really stands out about this bock, but there's certainly nothing unpleasant about it either. Simple, but solid."
"Chestnut colored with ruby highlights, a beige head rises up thickly, then settles very quickly to a fine cap of bubbles that rise up along the edges of the glass. Aroma is malty with hints of berry and cocoa. Taste is sweet malt, with fig and currant, some plum, plus a bit of metallic flavor riding beneath, maybe contributed by the ABV. A bitter tingle rising up in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is moderate to thin, a little bubbly."
"Drinkability is good for a d-b, but still, a few of these will kick your butt.."
"poured a deep amber, head not as good as on tap, faded quickly. smell was malty, and sweet, taste is quite good, malty, hints of chocolate, alcohol bite on the end, mouthfeel is medium carbonated, with a rather creamy feel, very nice! drinkability is good, but...be careful these can knock you for a loop! good beer!"
"Final Thought: Like most German biers, this one fits in with the crowd, especially the Spaten-Franziskaner crowd. Prost!"
"Drinkability: Nothing wrong with it, I could have a few. The question is, why would I go to town with a boring dopplebock with the likes of Celebrator and Salvator out there? Take the training wheels off and go for a slightly more interesting take on the style. This is not bad in any way though. Oh yeah, this review was for a green glass bottle from a cooler, but I don't think that threw it off any, as I've had it before and thought it was constant."
"Poured a clear and warm-looking deep brown in color. Thick off-white head foams up initially then settles down to a respectable 1"" thick layer. Distinct rings all the way down the glass. Aromas are up there as well, with a roasty-toasty malt dominating, carrying some dark fruits along as well. Flavor was tasty. Quite malty, with a dash of bitterness at the end that paired nicely with the slight ABV warming effect. There was a chocolatey splash in the middle as well. It's sweet, but certainly not in a bad way. Medium-full in body. I'm sorry that I've waited so long to try this, as it's been sitting in the beer fridge for a few months. I'd like to try the draft version."
"The aromas are doughy and sweet as bread. Buttery, brioche-like and pure. On the palate there is an up-tempo turnstyle of sweet fruit syrup, burnt grain and milk. Caramel flavored coffee flavors surge in the attack, then roll over to reveal rustic, grainy acidity. Responsive, uncomplicated beer."
"Full bodied, there is alcohol present in the aroma but not in the taste."
"Pours a nice brown color with a minimum head. Smells very sweet, almost sickly sweet in my opinion with faint notes of alcohol. Very interesting flavor on this one. Malt flavor sticks out the most followed by a sweet finish. Nice mouthfeel on this beer and drinkability is good. I like this beer but I was just put off by the aroma, maybe it's something i'll grow to love."
"As the bottle says, ""The Classic Dark German Beer""."
"Taste is much the same- big grape/prune taste with some sweetness and some alchohol flavors. Malty, moderately thick, highly carbonated. Smooth."
"Very drinkable."
"It wasn't one of my finer moments but how can the Univesity of Wisconsin sell such large pitchers for such a low price and not expect trouble?"
"Dark brown with maroon highlights, small head fades quickly. Aroma is subdued, carmel and a little alcohol. The flavors come in waves: initial sweetness on the tip of the tongue, followed by carmel malt, a little fruit and light coffee, a hint of hops, and finishing up with a nice alcohol warmness at the back of the throat. Enough body to coat the mouth nicely. Man, I love this stuff! I've had trouble deciding on a favorite beer style... but I'm thinking doppelbocks just might be it! I really need to do a side-by-side comparison with this and Salvator (another favorite of mine) some time!"
"and bigger. I don't know how many pints I could drink but I sure liked the one bottle I had."
"This beer seems to combine dark fruits and sweet malts. First impression: Raisins, plums and related dark fruit flavors meet with gentle matly flavors. I'd like to try this beer again under different circumstances and perhaps paired with the correct food. It is otherwise too sweet and too fruity."
"I have to say this beer was more mild than I expected, but that turned out to be a plus. This is a dark brew that can be very quaffable. Mild, subtle, but thoroughly enjoyable. Certainly beats the Sam Adams Double Bock, which was a bit heavy in alcohol flavor in my opinion. This a good beer for the Spring thaw."
"I have had the Optimator in a bottle. It didn't impress me, but this beer on tap has a lot of different characteristics. The beer pours a very, dark brown with reddish tones, with a smallish off-white head. There was considerable lacing during the drinking. It has a strong, roasted malt aroma with a little fruitish undertone. The beer is primarily a maltfest, but there is a grapy, fig or currant taste that adds body to it. There is a quick hit of hops at the end. I love the mouthfeel of this. It is thick and creamy with just the right carbonation. Altogether, a surpisingly nice beer from Spaten. I had come to not expect much from the brewer. I had this at Ludwig's in Philadelphia so it was served that way it should be."
"This is a solid dopplebock that is fun to drink. It's a nice spring or fall beer."
"A good doppelbock and tastes even better because its pretty cheap for an import. Impressive depth given such a low price. Much prefer this on draught than in a bottle, as the latter doesn't seem as deep and meaty, instead coming across with too much underripe fruit flavors."
"The taste is thin though pleasing with hints at spice complexities that are never fully revealed. In fact, the flavor really doesn't go far, making ordinariness the most notable feature of this ""malt liquor"". The bitterness is mildly unpleasant, the finish is abrupt, and the mouthfeel somewhat dull."
"Prosit!"
"12 oz bottle, no freshness dating.A classic that pours dark and ruby, best described as a cola color. The first thing that struck me that is this is a full flavored brew and that its strong alcoholwise. Malt dominates. Toffee, chocolate, licorish. Not much bittering going on here. In general, rich, strong and smooth stuff. A nice example of a dark German lager."
"Excellent example of the style... Nose is of chocolate, toffee and caramel. Sweet malty richness with the first sip, and a satisfying mouthfeel. Alcohol is quite warming. Some fruity esters present here. Lots of rich chocolate undertones and a well balanced finish. Excellent brew."
"Had on tap at Jacob Wirth yesterday. Very dark amber when served, it's nice head dissipated quickly. The aroma was sweet, almost cloying of the traditional malt. The taste was also sweet and malty, with the high alcohol content just able to be detected. It is actually rather easy to drink, thus the high mark for drinkability. Good stuff, nice to see available on tap here in Boston."
"Spaten Optimator was a transluscent brown/copper color. The head was small and short lived.The aroma was sweet with elements of caramel, chocolate, and alcohol. The taste was composed of toasted chocolate with caramel and molasses. Hops were not major players in the blend. The finish was semi-sweet and slightly dry and bitter. Over all it was thick with an oiliness that was carried over into the finish. A very tasty and enjoyable beer."
"Dark brown color that poured a nice little head. Smells of sweet malts. Taste was a sweet malt beginning, almost creamy, finishing with a slightly bitter finish. Nice full mouthfeel to this brew. This is a very drinkable brew, very nice compared to most European beers I have had."
"Another fine Bavarian brew in what has become my favorite style. This one pours a beautiful mahogany brown, with garnet highlights when held to the light. Beige head doesn't last long before fading into some minimal ring lacing and film. Aroma is Munich malts, big, creamy, and sweet. Caramel and toffee dominate the nose, while dates and figs dance in the background. A soft note of bittering noble hops is barely noticed. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, with ample carbonation. Taste is similar to the nose. Lots of swwet maltiness here. Caramel and toffee run the show. Hops appear just in time to lend a delightful balance. Alcohol is well concealed. These Bavarian Doppelbocks are really worldclass, in my humble opinion. This one ranks right up there with Celebrator and Salvator, in terms of fine German doppelbocks. Highly recommended!"
"Light to medium bodied with a rich, sticky mouthfeel and good carbonation. Great drinkability."
"Optimator pours a deep amber brown with a head that takes on a shade of light-colored sand as it forms. It's smell was an interesting twist of bittersweet chocolate and sweetened tea. I suppose that sounds a little ridiculous, but it was quite appetizing. This beer starts gritty with a caramel bent, then turns bitter and nutty (walnut, maybe) as it rests on your tongue. It is a full-bodied brew with a finish that reminded me of cough syrup (not exactly as pleasant as the smell suggested). Luckily, Optimator's aftertaste faded quickly from a strong beginning, and the last hint on your tongue leaves a dry feeling that gives you no choice but to consume your whole bottle."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy head. The aroma is decent. It has a pale scent with the addition of some crystal malts. The taste is good. It has a nice malty flavor to go with the pale malts and yeast. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. It drinks well. This is a very enjoyable doppellbock."
"Poured a deep dark brown with ruby highlights. Fine carbonation bubbles upwards towards a tremendous tan head that sticks around for quite some time. the malt scents drift upwards, kind of nutty and molasses-thick. Slight herbal hops thrown in as well. The tastes is smooth and rich. Chocolate hints, toasted nuts, miles of residual malt sweetness. This beer beats up your tongue with it's heavyweight malt profile, but is simply heaven to sip. Very tasty."
"It is drinkable, one of my standard beers when I want something heavy."
"I poured this and was surprised to find out that the bottle is actually green. The beer has a wonderful reddish hue when held up to light. The smell was a disappointment, as it was hardly even there. I only got a whiff of a little alcohol, malt, and a faint lager-like aroma. The taste, however, makes up for this. I'm a sucker for malt and this one has it in spades, like I was hoping it would. A little more complexity would have driven this beer into the upper echelon of great tasting brews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. Some alcohol is present in the flavor, and a butteriness dominates the aftertaste. The hops come through ever so slightly in the aftertaste as well."
"Thick airy hazelnut colored head leaves a small amount of struggling lace. Dark caramel brown colored beer has a glow to it. The aroma ia hard to put a finger on, a bit of sweet malt and a few alcohol soaked raisins. Malty caramel and burnt nuts dominates the flavor. The aftertaste is a little bitter and I swear there's a little alcohol in the flavor (doesn't make it to the stomach). The body is is just thick enough to carry the flavors. Overall a fairly complex and tasty beer."
"Pours with a sandy, off-white head about two fingers deep that fades to a ring of foam that still sticks around pretty good before sliding down edges of glass. Beer itself is deep brown with rubyish, almost orange highlights. Aroma is sweet, with a caramelly maltiness that lasts throughout the nose akin to frosted breakfast cereal, though not as cloying. A vaguely fruity, almost grapey hoppiness brings things to a close. Flavor is lighter than I expect from a doppelbock, and sweet; near-syrupy maltiness with more touches of caramel. Pleasant butterscotch and otherwise buttery flavors meld with a hop bitterness that emerges as the beer warms. Yeast is present in the midpalate but never crosses the line over to breadiness. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, consistent with the sweetness of the aroma and flavor; not exactly firm, but consistently smooth with a clean finish. Drinkability is six-pack-worthy, but still on the sweet side. This beer doesn't strike me as being as complex as I once thought, but I still enjoyed this one."
"$5.99 a 6 pack."
"Copper and ruby colored with a thick two-toned head. Top layer, fluffy and beige colored. After a bit, the head color merges as one, but I thought it was pretty neat that I thought my mind or the lighting was playing tricks on my eyes. Tart pungent malt aroma with some typical bock funkiness attributed from the yeast. Mild hop aroma in there, as well. Tastes rather sweet and malty, earthy, too. Pretty smooth. Had it before, but it's always good to shuffle up one's doppelbocks. Glad I chose this one tonight, because it hit the spot. Not too aggressive in any way. I'd like to try this one on draught."
"This was quite a treat. I have seen this one at my local store for so long without giving it a try, I don't know why. Anyways, it poured a deep brown color with a beautiful head that held up quite well. The nose was roasted malt mixed with a fruitiness, maybe plums. The taste was strong in the malt department, mainly with caramel but also some chocolate and earthy malts as well. The hops stay in the background but are needed to keep the malts within their limits. A slight alcohol flavor hits me in the aftertaste which really makes me only want to drink more. Quite a great beer!"
"Now this is some good shit! I have heard a lot about this beer and other Doppelbocks but since I'm such a hop-head, I usualy pass them up when it comes time to go to the store. I will pass them no more. This poured a great brownish color with great head that settled on top till the last drop. The smell was filled with toffee and carmel. The flavor was out of this world with a great carmel taste and just a touch of hops in the end to round it all out. For an import macro, this is about as good as it gets."
"Very good mouthfeel...exceptional drinkability for a beer this big. Smooth and likable, this is a beer that I will invite home again soon. I'd like to pair it with some roast, or maybe it would make a good after-dinner drink around the holidays."
"Taste: here's where it's happening: enormous malt, good, chewy mouthfeel, warm, delicious, generous with flavor. Swims in the mouth with vigor. Nutty, malty, warm, yet still clean and well-behaved. A nice, if tame, doppelbock."
"A little plain for the style, but also nice not to have it over the top. I don't consider it an adequate tasting beer, but a very good drinking beer. Bit caramelly sweet, with few other flavors involved, at least as far as my mouth is concerned. A lethargic thumbs up."
"Not my particular cup o' tea, but I can see how and why one might like this. And I think if you paired it up with a nice roast, a ladle of mushroom gravy, and some garlic mashed potatoes...I wouldn't say no."
"High marks!"
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable, although the sweetness and alcohol level tend to saturate me rather quickly."
"The beer pours an unblemished deep mahogany color with a massive head that is frothy and a light tan color, the resultant lace a thick and clinging sheet. Nose is sweet malt, caramel, plum like and also a hint of toasted grain, front is ambrosial, top is middling in feel. The beer finishes with a spirited hop spicy bite, light to moderate in carbonation and a somewhat tart and very dry aftertaste, a real treat I must say."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. A slight hop crispness in the middle of a taste. There is a nice stickyness to its drinkability. A bit of an alcohol sting on the mouth but it is only a wake up call. A fine drinking dopplebock."
"poured with a clear dark ruby/brown color and a very good off-white head. malty aroma with some alcohol. not much as far as hops, jsut enough to balance off some of the malt. smooth balanced mouthfeel and then the alcohol kicks you in the back of the throat. good doppelbock but not neccessary my favorite one of choice."
"Dark chocolate brown and thick. Head doesn't stick around for long, but coats the sides of the glass and floats around the top. Rich sweet malt aromas, hint of sour. Big chewy malts, very sweet and another hint of sour bread. Metallic chocolate flavors and sweet bready flavors all the way through. Definitely contains those unique dobblebock flavors. This one could substitute for a lunch or dinner."
"Surprisingly easy to drink and tasty to boot. A nice cool-weather session beer."
"($1.79 / 12 oz. bottle)"
"Very dark mahogany with a light tan head. The head stays well enough for a while if you give it a good strong pour, but still eventually fades away. Very interesting aroma of sour grape character and caramel with grain and just a hint of hops. On the palate, lots of malty flavors including caramel, molasses, and a touch of grain. Some spiciness rounds everything out. Not as ""big"" as the perfect doppelbock. Seems kind of like an overgrown märzen. It's still interesting and worth a try."
"Quite drinkable to me, especially when the weather gets to changing up here. Smooth enough to have on a regular basis and a solid doppelbock."
"Overall: Not bad, but this would only ever be the occasional beer for me."
"This beer poured a dark brown color.It had a strange unexpected aroma, sort of like sourdough bread. The taste that followed however was typical and nice. Nice molasses sweet roasted flavor. This became a nice carmelly taste in the middlewith a sweet coffeeish aftertaste. Very little bitterness. It had a nice light feel to it, one of the few doppels you could drink after strenuous exertion on a hot day."
"Had this last weekend at Oktoberfest in Cincinnati. Raisiny brown in color, nice head retention. Smell is malty sweet. Taste is outstanding, sweet malt with a little bitterness in there. Nicely balanced and a joy to drink, especially with a Brat in hand!!"
"Notes: Timid taste profile for the style."
"This beer is one of my favorites. A ridiculously malty beer, that isn't to sweet. Its just right. This beer has a great nose on it from which one can detect a bit of alcohol and a good dose of malt aroma with maybe a little honey scent in there too. Almost no detectable hop presence, but I'm sure without hops it would taste odd."
"Dark brown color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty and rich. Deeply roasted malts. A full-bodied Dopplebock. Malts are slightly sweet with a nice caramel flavor. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty and dry. Great beer."
"This was my first experience of this on tap. It poured a lovely dark brown / burgandy color with a very thin head. The aroma was nice, but I expected some more sweetness and roasted malt in the nose. I expected a thick malty beer, and that's exactly what I got. The malt lingered long on the tongue and the sweetness was not overpowering. The drinkabilty of this good, as I could have easily had more than one in a session. This would be a great to drink on a cold winter night, as the alcohol definitely warms the insides."
"A great beer to drink a liter of! With an above-average alcohol content, however, I would suggest limiting yourself to one liter."
"This Dopple Bock is in a league of its own. Its Ruby/Cordovan color and rich creamy head invite you to gulp. A pleasant aroma of roasted malt, hops and mild alcohol lasts. A heavy, thick body is creamy and lush. Sweet, yet sharp edged. Smooth and creamy...an enigma. The flavors jump out and introduce themselves separately then sort of meld and balance towards the end of the glass. A must try!"
"Jeez, if the bar I had this at didn't have about 60 more comparable beers like this, I would have drank this all night! What a fantastic display of the style....rich, dark brown in color with tons of sweet malty goodness balanced nicely by the hop level. Smooth, luxurious mouthfeel, with some spicy notes along with the roasted malty complexity. Very much recommended, especially if you typcially like big beers in this mold (Celebrator, etc...)"
"And I say, Spaten Optimator must be the best German beer I've ever had."
"Drinkability: easy to drink, thanks to smooth and velvety feel and good taste. % ABV is a small detractor. Overall, a good beer to sit back and relax with."
"John"
"Poured a dark brown color with an off-white head. Generous lacing. Smell of toasty malt and dark fruits. Tasted of toasty malt, with a figgy, raisiny dark fruit flavor. Hops were minimal. Creamy mouthfeel. This was a nice dopplebock, but not terribly remarkable."
"This beer pours a very dark amber color with a small tan head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty and strong but still pleasant. I found this beer to be extremely smooth - slid down very nicely. The maltiness is very apparent in the taste and it is just sweet enough. There is also some chocolate that can be found in the taste. The carbonation is there in the taste, but it is very thin - almost like the bubbles are extremely tiny - dunno how to describe this. The aftertaste is malty with a hint of alcohol. Nice beer."
"This brew poured a large head of light brown bubbles that were of fine to medium sizes. It had a dark brown almost opaque body with no carbonation evident. With a mild aroma of malt, it has a complex flavor full of spices, malt, caramel, some chewiness and a very mild aftertaste. It goes down very smoothly and leaves a good lacing as it does."
"Overall Impression: A rich dark malty drinkable beer. Fine German craftsmanship."
"This dopplebock poured a clear deep brown with a tall stand of a fine dark tan head. The head did not last particularly long but left a nice lace on the glass. The aroma is malty and has no hoppiness. The taste follows suit and is dominated by malt. Their seems to be a fruitiness that hides behind the malt. This beer is not sweet but yet malty. No roasted taste. Not hops. With a little alcohol taste. The biggest weakness in this drink is its less than full-bodied mouthfeel. I would rate it medium at best. Overall, this is a great dopplebock. I find it a very good beer to sip and enjoy its delicious varieties in aroma and taste."
"Originally sampled on 1 March 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. draught: This pours a dark brown color. The body is a lot lighter than I expected. It has a lots of malty, roasty flavors. it's a very nice beer, enjoyable, but not outstanding in my opinion."
"(the next time I had this, it was much better. Maybe the green bottle did the other one in. Nice taste, good balance. Still not in the top 5 for doppels, but good nonetheless)."
"Bottom line: For this price you won't find much better..."
"This was one of the first very dark beers that I ever tasted, many years ago, and I returned to it when I saw one sitting there, almost forlorn, on the single beer shelf. Perhaps a bit sweet for some, but a reliable and deep beer, full of character."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with little to no head and no lace. Aroma and taste of malt is strong, with little to no hop bitterness. Lack of any real carbonation, brings out an almost sweet, syrupy flavor. Not a bad doppelbock but nothing really stands out."
"It's brilliant dark amberish brown in color with a fairly large head. The aroma is very malty and slightly alcoholic. It's toasty and medium bodied....doesn't really come across as ""chewy"" as other doppels. It's very malty nonetheless with a lingering sweetness. Alcohol shows up after it warms a bit and adds a nice touch.....great doppelbock."
"This brew poured a large tan head. There was virtually no lacing observed on the sides of my glass. It had an amber body to it. There was no carbonation observed with this brew. It had a fairly smooth taste to it. All in all this was a very good drink."
"This one pours to a ruby-brown color with a light brown head. The aroma is malty, bready, and roasty. The flavor is malty, bready, chocolatey, with a bit of roastiness. This is a full-bodied, alcoholic brew. Very malty and tasty. I really enjoy the malty doppel bocks."
"Man, what a great beer! Deep. Complex. Sweet but not too sweet. Yum!"
"1 pint, 9 .oz bottle. Gold foil around the neck with the words ""Imported"" printed several times diagonally across it. The red Spaten logo also appears centered on the front. Poured a clear, very dark copper in color with a khaki-colored head. Decent aroma consisted of roasted malt, toffee, caramel and a hint of sweet spice. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. The taste is decent, yet very uninspiring. Not bad, just bland. Somewhat vinous finish. 7.2% alcohol is evident in the taste. As far as doppelbocks go, Optimator was a big let down for me primarily from a taste standpoint. I expected much more here."
"Eh. Kind of a middle-of-the-road dopplebock. It's brown, as it should be, but it's a bit pale. It's a little thin as lagers tend to be, but there are plenty of fuller-bodied dopplebocks, so there's something to shoot for there. Tastes like a mish-mash of muted flavors with no real pronounced taste beyond a sort of bready vegetable flavor. It's hardly bad; it's just not unexpected, exceptional, or fun in any way."
"Sweet and dark copper/brown. Very malty with a pronounced thickness compared to other Dopplebocks. It is highly drinkable but also the alcohol comes through after it warms. A good style of Doppelbock that is not given its due. One to try and compare to others."
"This is a very good dark beer and one I'm glad I tried. The pour created a beautiful dark, dark amber to mahogany look with ruby highlights. The head was voluminous and a deep tan color. The head did fade a bit quickly, but it left behind a good lacing that lasted through half the glass. A big malt nose with some hops sense. The taste is sweet, but finishes with a very real hop bitterness. Alcohol comes in quickly, but there is good balance with the other flavors. I'll try this again and recommend to friends."
"Pours a deep brown almost black color with a slight ruby tint. A thick tan head arose and slowly died down leaving a thin lace. The aromas were quite complex with dark malts, caramel, chocolate, and a touch of fruity sweetness. The taste is somewhat complex also; there were hints of nuttiness mixed with sweet fruit and caramel. Alcohol taste was quite apparent, but it wasnt overpowering so it mixed well with the other flavors. A mild alcohol and malt aftertaste was left in my mouth. This is a very complex and balanced brew; a must try."
"One of the first bocks I ever had,poured a nice rich brown color with foamy head.Smell was very sweet and alcoholic,taste was buttery and caramelly and creamy.Since trying more doppelbock's I noticed this was a little thin in the mouthfeel dept. but still a really well made doppelbock."
"This beer poured out a dark amber brown color. The head was large at first, then fizzled out quick. The nose was of sweet malt with a touch of hops. Caramel in the taste. A full flavored and almost overwhelming beer. Very well made. I enjoyed this one."
"Nice doppelbock, sweet and malty. Good availablity, goes on sale here often - when it becomes quite a bargain."
"NOTES..This was my very first doppelbock..way back in 2001..LOL seems like a life time ago..my first real taste of German beer other than bloody Becks. It has fond memories for me..I first tasted it on a camping trip to the Oregon High Desert..me and the wife went to get over a terrible tragedy in our lives..I drank this out of the bottle ( 8 of them) It helped me forget for a while..like I said It's and old friend.."
"Clear dark brick red pour gives way to quickly settling head with floating clusters of bubbles around the edge if the glass. Smells like a fruit salad left in the sun all day. Acidic and sweet like bile and corn. Maybe this beer tastes better on tap in Munich, tastes to me like concentrated ghetto 40oz."
"Now my reviews count! Yeah!!!"
"The when I was first getting into beers over the summer I picked up a couple different products from Spaten, one of them being the Optimator. Had no clue what I was getting myself into at the time, and I didn't even know what a dopplebock was. I think I thought it was really thick and off flavored at the time, so I saw it on tap at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse had to give it another shot. This beer is definitely toned down in comparison to most dopplebocks that are made today, but this isn't a bad thing because it is still a solid representation of the style. A deep ruby red tone with a thin cream colored head settles quickly. The aroma consists of a light bouquet of malty goodness, and with the first sip I couldn't get over how drinkable this beer is. With a nice trace of figs and plum to the taste, this beer had a very sweet finish very balanced and enjoyable. Like a said a little on the lighter side for a dbock, but the lighter body gives this beer an increased drinkability."
"There is plenty of flavor...I wouldn't say it's complex, but it is flavorful. Dark malts, hints of chocolate...did I mention the malts? A slight bitter fruitiness appears as well. Oh, and there's some kick-ass malts. Wonderfully enjoyable creamy mouthfeel. This seemed very light for a Doppelbock, and I had no idea the ABV was over 7%. It's very easy to drink and would make a great session beer. Spaten...the Terrrrminator. I'll be baaack."
"The mouthfeel is medium and the beer goes down smooth. Initially I didn't like this brew but its growing on me."
"If you look at this beer in the 6-pack, you may be mislead but the words dark beer. You may just think it is simply a dunkel. If you know a little about it, you will realize it is a doppelbock, just not really labelled as such. It has a great rich body with a fairly good malty flavor. It is very smooth with a low carbonation, and a well-hidden alcohol content. I was very happy with this beer. It is certainly not amazing, but I was happy after waiting so long to try this one. It is a fair representative of doppelbocks. It is similar to a Paulaner, but it is a little more mild on the flavoring, and it seems to be a little thinner."
"Optimator says to fridge: ""I'll be bock."""
"Hrmm..yummy. Poured agressively, this clear deep amber-ruby brew formed a peaking head, but thinned quickly, leaving wisps of brussels lace. Moderate carbonation, medium to small sized bubbles. Nose is malt, malt, and more malt with a peppery hint of alcohol, some faint noble hops, and loads of caramel. Mouthfeel is thick and somewhat cloying, but not as syrupy as Celebrator or Salvator. Taste starts out with some bold flavor hops, fades to a potent amber malt background of figs, dates and raisins, gives a big peppery kick of alcohol and some spicy bittering hops, and ends in a lingering burnt-caramel sweetness with a soft metallic tinge. For the timid, this is a really good introduction to the world of dopplebocks. Not quite as cloying and sweet as Salvator, not quite as complex as Celebrator, and somewhat more drinkable than both."
"This good draft was very malty. The nose was also very fruity and sweet. the mouthfeel was nice and somewhat watery. The head a bit to be desired. Overall a drinkable beer. Though not a great beer. I still enjoy this one every now and then but it is a middle of the road beer for me."
"Maly, malty, malty! Pours a dark brownish ruby color with a foamy and bubbly white head that fades into a nice lace. Nose is dominated by sweet toasted malts with notes of caramel. Thick and chewy in the mouth with tastes of sweet malts, rich buttery toffee, caramel, and raisin. Oily hops create a bit of a slick feeling in the mouth and a touch of bitterness leaves a semi-dry finish. For the malt fans, this is a great beer."
"Good beer. I would certainly have it again."
"I would put this squarely between Salvator and Celebrator in nearly every aspect. Color, mouthfeel, and strength of flavor are all a bit lighter than Celebrator. A dark beer, head is much better on tap than from bottle. I would put this as one of the more approachable doppels, great for introducing someone to the style. This is a doppel you can sit down and drink all night."
"Spaten's Optimator poured a thick brownish foaming white head.It smelled sweet and hoppy.It had a great taste which invited you for another sip.It is very rich and creamy with a malty aftertaste.The head however didnt hold that long retaining almost nothing.I cant believe how smooth and creamy it is.Its a strong brew but not overpowering.Great! I really enjoyed this one.The alchohol content is hidden by the flavor.I would never suspect this to be 7.2%"
"Overall excellent."
"This dark brown beer pours with an off white head that fills my pint glass. The head slowly recedes to a rocky layer of foam that clings to the sides of the glass. The aroma is all malt sweetness, with a slight huskiness. The taste is roasted malt, caramel, and sweetness. Notes of chocolate and a slight smokiness are present as well. Very complex flavor. The alcohol is noticable on the finish, and it warms the throat on the way down. The finish also has a lingering sweetness, most likely also from the alcohol. This is not a beer for the hop fan, but malt lovers should but it by the case. The mouthfeel is very full and creamy. The drinkability is good considering the alcohol content. I'm very surprised this beer is not in the top 50. A truly underrated beer."
"Deep brown-copper color, frothy off white head clings to the glass. Very malty roasty aroma, malty sweet caremel-toffee roasty flavors, full, thick mouthfeel, easy to drink and cheap for a good dopplebock."
"The only reason I give it an average rating on drinkablility is that it fills you up, really fast."
""
"An awesomely satisfying malt monster."
"P.S.  I bought an unopened case today, and resampled it without the skunkiness,  I find this to be a really enjoyable malty, smooth brew."
"Deep amber / brown with a small, but persistant head, that leaves a pleasant lace.  Very rich aroma and flavor with an upfront and in-your-face maltiness.  The alcohol is quite noticeable, and gives the beer a nice warming effect.  Taste is very complex, with flavors of figs, carmel, grain, and just enough hops to add a slight bitterness to the finish.  Medium carboantion and a medium body, and quite drinkable for such a strong and rich beer.  Well done."
"Pours a dark brown/amber with a modest head. Smell is of a malty caramel with a hint of sweetness. The taste is somewhat consistent with the caramel and malt with just a hint of hops for a super nice balance! It has a medium/heavy body with very creamy mouthfeel and a warming alcohol finish! Damn good! Prosit!"
" Very drinkable I had almost forgotten how much I liked this beer, as it was one of the only dopplebocks I could find after returning from Germany, but before moving to Portland."
"Clear, deep-crimson/mahogany in color with an off-white head that drops shortly after pouring but maintains a good-sized creamy collar and more than adequate surface foam. Very nice. The aroma expresses rich, toasted Munich malts; a hint of fruit; a slight whisp of alcohol; and a light touch of background hops. The body is medium/full with a very fine and slightly moderate carbonation that leaves it smooth and creamy across the palate. The flavor delivers a rich toasted malt that's laced with fruit and some minimal hop flavor; as well as some clear alcohol. It's very well balanced and the sweet malt is always kept in check by a firm, underlying bitterness. It finishes dry with just a swirl of fruit and alcohol; and the malt never clings to the palate. Very well done! One of the classics of the style."
"Optimator could easily become just about anyones number one or two favorite Beer of style."
"Dark brown hue with ruby highlights, rich in color, the head was brunette, a thick finger in height but it failed to hold well. As I imbibed in the glorious liquid rings of lace were established on the side of my glass. The nose was lacking that powerful bunch but pleasant and, albeit, soft notes of chocolate, toffee, hints of fruit, and a blur of alcohol construct the aromas. As a whole the bouquet is pleasant; I just had to work at smelling it. The palate is plenty malty, it is chewy and both lightly roasted and tasty sweet flavors appear. Chocolate covered raisins and a note of hops finish the beer nicely. This is a fine doppelbock, simply lovely. Medium-full in texture with low, natural carbonation that helps produce a relaxed mouthfeel. I was inspired to sip yet this is an easy drinking doppelbock. I think both Salvator and Celebrator are better but by know means should Optimator be ignored. It is a high quality beverage."
"Deep dark brown with a nice beige head and some lace. The nose is malt, caramel, very rich and aromatic. Starts malt sweet and the toasted grains show through. Finishes a bit dry with some hops. Great mouthfeel and real smooth. Robust, dark, full bodied, and wonderful complex flavors. Very enjoyable."
"Dark reddish-coppery tones.  Thin head quickly dissipates, but there's plenty of time to enjoy the heady aromas of sweet caramel and a hint of alcohol.  The taste is heavy at the front with sweetness giving away to just a bit of alcohol.  You probably won't want to drink a lot of this, but you'll love every drop that you have."
"Deep dark brown almost black in color with a thin a beige head that quickly vanished. A bit thin on taste,a little disappointing for a dobblebock but overall a decent beer and worth a try."
"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed an off white bubbly head that was bit sudsy and left some lace.  The aroma was of malt and caramel and a touch of chocolate.   The flavor was of malt and chocolate with a touch of caramel.  The body was a bit light for this style and not as creamy as others. The finish was light, but didn't find it as bad as others mentioned, just a touch astrigent."
"A nice looking deep dark brown to black color. Thin beige head. Decent roasted carmel, toffee sweet smells. Tastes were sublte, roasted carmel malty sweetness, slight bitter finish. A bit thin watery feel for a dopplebock. There are other more tasty dopplebocks out there, IMO, Salvator and Celebrator rank ahead of this one."
"A good doppelbock, but not a great one (it's an imported macro brew at heart). Still well worth the try ..."
"Well balance of malts, alcohol and sweetness with just the right amount of tartness. Silky smooooth tasting. The aftertaste is a little short, but no enough to matter! Love it!"
"Strong caramel smell with deep dark amber look.  Pale head with good retention.  The caramel keeps coming when you taste.  Malty sweetness with hints of roasted coffee beans.  Lots of complex flavor.  Smooth silk mouth  but there is also lots of sparkle on the tongue. the aftertaste is slightly nutty.  Very good brew for the cool/cold nights in fall or winter."
"Full of flavor, nice malt taste with just tinge of sweetness. Easy to drink with a nice aftertaste. The alcohol has a warming effect as you drink it.  More of a cool weather offering.  For some reason, drinking this outdoors on a crisp evening brings out the beer's flavor and enjoyment."
"Pours a nice brown with hints of red and an off-white head.  The smell is malty sweetness with just a slight hoppiness and a bit of a metallic smell.  Surprisingly, the flavors didn't seem to develop as the beer warmed.  It also seemed just a bit thin.  After drinking Salvator, Optimator was a little disappointing."
"Package reviewed was a 12 oz green glass longneck."
"Out of the few dopplebocks I've had, I like this the best. The lager characteristics are not drowned out by the malt and is pretty easy to drink. A little lighter than most doppelbocks but has enough nutty, malty flavor to help subdue the strong alcohol flavor. I also had a sample on tap at the Beer Summit and thought it was little more chocolate flavored  (and of course fresher) than the bottle version."
"Only drawback--green bottles.  I've had a ""wet dog"" or two, unfortunately."
"Pours brown with a ruby hue or tint. A tiny bit thinner body than some other German Dopplebocks, but this one nevertheless provides the alcoholic warmth typical of the style. Heavy malt on the nose and on the palate, along with dried fruit, toasted bread maybe, raison notes, little toffee as well. Good mouth feel. Another great DBDoppelbock is just a great style, I dont think I every had one I really didnt enjoynot yet at least"
"A great DB choice when not looking for something thick or gigantic, yet still spot-on for the style."
"Solid doppel.  Deep, dark amber colored beer with a rocky white head.  Head fades quickly, and leaves a thin lace floating on the surface of the beer.  Wonderful aroma!  Sweet molasses, with a bit of a metallic tang.  Sweetness in the nose is just a bit too candy-like for perfection, but it's still amazing.  Body is a bit thin, and the taste isn't as rich as the smell promises.  Sweet molasses dominates the malty taste, with some hop zest present especially on the finish."
"Nice dark color, rocky one inch head.  Minimal mostly sweet aroma.  Roasted sweet malts, minimal to no bitterness.  Slight chocolate tones.  Rather than a metallic taste at the end, I noticed a severe flavor fall off, which might be intentional. Liked it more as it warmed up.  Was thinner in body than I expected, but it was highly drinkable"
"Deep mahogony, with a foamy white head that disappears fairly quickly. Slight metallic aroma with a hint of molasses. Taste is also slightly metallic, slightly sweet (again, molasses), with a slightly bitter finish. Alcohol is apparent after the first few sips. Overall, a nice beer, but it seems a bit slight to me."
"Had on draught. Lovely appearance in the 20oz. pint glass. Gorgeous, dark, malty. Alcohol is evident in the aroma with smells of dark bread, caramel and coffee. Sweet, dark roasted malt flavors are balanced well with the alcohol kick. A perfect nightcap or with a hearty meal. Outstanding."
"Beautiful beer, deep ruby, tan head.  Rich, deep malt taste.  Strong aroma, noticeable in the first sip through the last (which is kind of a rarity, for me at least).  Deep, lingering, sweet aftertaste, kind of reminds me of a tawny port.  Very good.  (by the way, bought it in a half liter (about 17 ounces) brown bottle with a gold foil top)."
"Russet brown with very little head.  Thick sweet maltiness on the nose.  Here's a beer you can chew on.  Massive malt blast on the tongue.  Great taste.  Pretty viscous brew.  Hops are only around to balance the huge malt load.  Very little hop taste or bitterness present.  I get some roastiness, but not a lot.  Seems pretty complex.  Molasses taste is slight.  I have actually had this beer for over a year and it may have developed some faint new layers.  This is a great brew."
"The dense off - white head sits on top of a gorgeous, absolutely clear deep ruby hued potion.  The incredible clarity signifies a long and well lagered brew.  Sweet, toffeeish, toasty, bready, Munich malt notes along w/ that signature decoction produced melaniodin complexity dominate the malt aroma profile. Chewy in aroma chewy and malt flavor as well.  The carbonation is perfect, providing for a very smooth and rich mouthfeel but allows for ample head retention as well.  Optimator tastes sweet, but the sweetness is accompanied by rich, luscious and complex malt flavors and is barely balanced by a mild hop bitterness.  I don't think it's possible to brew a doppel as rich and complex as this one using single temp infusion and domestic malts.  Something about that German grain...  Optimator finishes w/ heavily toasty malt flavor and a delicious sweetness that isn't cloying. Cleaner in overall profile and more drinkable than Salvator. Yum."
"Tasty and packs a punch. A beer worthy of respect.  Nice smell and color.  Excellent malt flavor with a near perfect hop finish."
"Beautiful color, tight lacy head. Initially very sweet, balances out towards a tasty, toasty finish that lingers. Deceptively strong; don't let the malts bury you. This is not a beer to be taken lightly. This is a beer for sitting down and enjoying. A great way to ring in warmer spring weather. My only quibble is the green bottle. Fortunately this beer is sturdy enough that it's not much of an issue."
"I guess I'm spoiled by Celebrator and my expectations weren't met by Optimator. A fine beer but just not as chewy and full flavored as the former. Side by side the comparison probably would of been worse. A nice, malty example, but not the German brewer's doppelbock art."
"64"
"I'm working my way through some different doppels and this is another good one but not one of the top ones I've tried...It is dark brown in color...minimal head...malty aroma with some alcohol on the nose..I like the way it tastes...It's sweet but easy drinking...not as much taste complexity as Salvator or S.A. Double Bock Still a very good doppel...On the deep finish I do sense a bit of a hop bite trying to balance out the sweetness but it's hard to distinguish immediately...Overall this is solid, but not spectacular..."
"Deep amber color, small head, mild sweet flowery smell.  Caramel-sweet taste, not strong alcohol - or anything else.  Sticky, thin mouthfeel.  Wouldn't want to drink more than a couple of these."
"This is a damn fine doppelbock.  Goes well with meals or just as it is.  Quite a bit of complexity to the taste.  More than just a beer."
"Contemplative, superb."
"Toasted caramel aroma and solid malty caramel body.  Finish is sweet and moderately bitter with nice separation between the flavors.  Not as good as Celebrator IMHO, but pushes a close second."
"The perfect beer"
"Notes: Ahhh ... a meal in a bottle. Breakfast anyone? If beer is measured by its malt back bone than this is a body builder beer. 7.2 abv with a 12 month self life."
