"f-warm, sweet and coats like a liqueur"
""
"Well, overall for me, I am glad I tried this. It is a unique experience, but the ridiculous sweetness will probably keep me from coming back frequently. Certainly something I want to explore again!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I would definitely drink this again. It's a real nice strong sipper with some table wine and brandy-like qualities. Not so sure about the doppelbock classification, but frankly I don't care what it's called. It's good. For what it's worth, it paired surprisingly well with a bacon and red onion pizza. I don't think I'd ever pony up for it at full price, but I will keep an eye out for reasonable deals on this one."
"Whiskey taste mixed with kind of liqorish chocolate, too sweet for my taste, its absolutely not what i am loking for in a beer. Wont try it ever again"
"place holder review. I will get a few more and review it...."
"Very strange,not sure what will appeal to all, but definitely worth a try"
""
"Bottled in 2010. Hides the alcohol very well. Sweet. Smells like the style. Dopplebock? Good beer."
"Fruity and winey. There's a bit of a cough syrup thing happening here? Sadly I'm not so sure I'm into this one. Maybe I'm not being fair? I don't have a lot of experience with doppelbocks. But I know what I like and I feel like this was wasted on me."
"I had a couple of bottles years back from a now defunct local gourmet grocery. Absolutely amazing! Smooth and sweet smell and taste, very fruity with too many flavors to remember, just like a good port wine or brandy. A beer liqueur you need to sip slowly with rich dark chocolates on a plate. I don't usually like sweet brews but once a year this is a treat."
"From taste notes. Appearance: Pours brilliant dark amber to chestnut with a thin film of white fizzley foam for a head. Smell: Dark dried fruit and sherry to port aromas, leather, not much malt, no roast, not much hop but some alcohol. Taste: Starts with a blast of fruit, some sweet dark cherry, then it seques through some sherry, flavors sweetened with caramel and spiced with a trace of cinnamon. It presents a hot alcohol warming finish. Mouthfeel: A shade less than chewy. It’s less than average carbonation levels suggest a port wine texture.  Overall: This is sweet and alcoholic like a sweet wine with some malt flavors running around and leaves a burst of alcohol in the back taste. A classic holiday sitting by the fire beer."

"Smooth and sweet Doppelbock heaven. I'm very impressed with this one."

"I was smitten with this beer from the first sip. Highlighted taste and high alcohol level make it very tasty."
""
"Paired very nicely with dark chocolate, yes a lot of sweet caramel notes, but a lot of interesting dried fruity character, mixed with spices and oak. It never became cloying (had it at nearly room temperature though) and was a smoothly satisfying. I don't think you can take knocks at this beer for being what it is meant to be, it is utterly delicious, a smooth sipper and warming. It may not be to everyone's taste but it makes a nice treat."
""
"Sweet dates and raisins, high gravity and a bit too sweet for me, would love it hopped up."
"O: Although balanced, this doppelbock is far too much to enjoy. It's not warming, just intoxicating. The flavor is simple and straight to the point. There is nothing clean about this recipe."
""
""
"Far too sweet for my liking. It could've been a lot more balanced. Alcohol is well hidden, though."
""
"Taste good actually, but you can feel how strong it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark amber color, raisiny aroma, robust taste almost like that of a barleywine, heavy on the pallet."
""
"Overall a truly gorgeous looking beer and way too drinkable for 14%.  Would love to taste it again with some age on it."
""
"Definitely a beer I need to reevaluate when I have an opportunity to taste a cellared version."
"Definitely a winter beer if there ever was one.  It's heavy on the sweetness and fruit typical of strong barleywines.  A little boozy.  But, it's all balanced very well and it put a smile on my face at how unique a delicious it was.  I'm buying more when I find them."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I expect from the a very strong Doppelbock and it was just the type of beer I needed on this really cold day in Mid Michigan.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was a little smooth, not crisp, a little boozy, a little warming, pretty sticky, slightly cloying, not too filling and the taste did nice job at holding my attention, i think one is the perfect amount for me, no need to open another one and I think it makes for a great cold weather beer.  What I like the most about this beer was the color and the balance when it came to the taste, to me those were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the lest about this beer was the sweetness and how well the alcohol was hidden, I think those aspects could use a little bit of work.  I would buy this beer again, I'll be getting a bottle next year and I think I might have to get one or two for the cellar.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes strong Doppelbocks, it's very true to style.  All in all I was happy with this beer and I think it was a good idea to revisit it.  It is strong and boozy, but the flavors are good and I think it's a good Winter Seasonal.  It makes for a good first impression for this brewery and I would like to try more of their beers.  I think this is one of the better high gravity Doppelbocks I've had.  Good job guys, this is one tasty and potent Doppelbock, keep up the solid work,"
""
"This was simply an amazing beer. It taste of toffee but not too strong. You can hardly taste the alcohol in it. It's thick and rich. This is one you would drink after a meal. I would recommend this as a dessert drink. Goes with chocolate very well. Indeed one of the best beers I've tasted. It deserves a higher rating than its been given."
""
"O- Haven't had this in years and I'm glad I finally revisited it.  A great sipper that hasn't lost its edge even in the new era of extreme high gravity beers that have surpassed this, what was once the strongest beer in the world."
"O - I think this deserves a much higher rating. A very special beer that I will buy more of now and in years to come."
""
"Got to try the 2007 on New Years Eve. Pours an amber color with very little head to speak of. The smell was full of caramel and toffee but also oak and what smelled like port wine. The taste wasn't as sweet when I tried my first sip. Very complex and layered with different flavors. Sweet but not sugary, bold but not overpowering. Very nice."
"When you get one of these let it set in the wine cellar for a couple of years.  The flavors become much more complex"

"If you enjoy a Quad but haven't ever tried this - do not wait any longer. Get this NOW!"
"Nice reddish-amber, no head to speak of. Very fruit-forwards, figs, rasins, chocolate, over a nice malty base. A bit syrupy, but otherwise nice carbonation and smooth - nice heat."
""
""
""
"Vintage 2010.  This is my first go at this one.  Have heard some mixed reviews,  but I really enjoyed.  A bit boozy, sweet (but not overly so),  feel is smooth and creamy,  light carbonation.  Reminds me a lot of eggnog for some reason,  which is a holiday favorite of mine.  Really enjoyed sipping this one as a nightcap on Christmas eve."
""
"This beer tastes like grass, imo."
"This review is from a couple years ago - This vintage beer 2007 was the grande finale of an event I held. At 14% the front label says it all ""The Strongest Lager Beer in the World"". At five years old we were getting this beer at it's peak having mellowed out the high alcohol to bring the sweet maltiness to the forefront. A lot of comments were; this is similar to a port and this would be a great dessert beer that would go great with cheesecake.   I still have a half dozen bottles that I'm letting age and opening on Dec 6 of every year.  This year I cracked the next one open and it aged even better, becoming a little more port like."
"A nice, slow sipper and if you know what you're getting into, it's a nice dessertish beer.  Definitely not for all, but try it for yourselves."
"Ottima super buona, molto corposa"
""
""
"2011 great beer. Pours dark and thick lots of coffee and malt"

"This one is hard to review.  The first sips are world class (4.6 on the first pass), but after 10 ounces or so over 45 minutes, the sweetness becomes a bit annoying and I have the 750 bottle!  So in goes a wine cap and back in the fridge this one goes."

"Lager meets sweetened spiced wine. A good thing to have in small amounts a couple times a year. Not sure I would want more than a little at a time."

""
"I had high expectations for this brew, but it's not nearly my favorite. Fresh, it seems to be a syrupy, candy-like, low-carbed wine. It's a bit too sweet for me too I guess. This doesn't make it bad at all, just very average."
""
""
"May not be everyone's cup of Joe, but the sweetness and high alcohol just mean it's a sipper. Classic holiday beer."

"Bleh. Way too sweet and syrup like. I will never buy this one again."
""
"O: I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I figured it would be exceptionally harsh but it is not. It is however, super sweet. I can hear my teeth rotting. Heavy and thick with sharp alcohol leads to not-so-great drinkability; this is certainly a sipper. A good sipper though. Not too harsh, not too over the top. 11.2 ounces is just right, anymore would be hard to handle."

"The bottle I had was aged 5 years.  I imagine fresher bottles might be a little rough"

"Pours a rich, clear, deep amber with a frothy, lingering khaki head. I can smell melanoidins and deeply toasted malt across the room. Dark fruit notes of raisins, dates, prunes, figs, and bruised cherries add complexity. The flavor is very sweet, with a toasted malt and fruity specialty malt backbone. The finish is surprisingly dry and toasted. Boozy, rum-soaked figs, raisins, and dates provide fuel for the syrupy sweetness. Could use some age to develop those esters a bit and calm the alcohol. It's definitely for those with a sweet tooth! I really wanted to love this, but it's just too sweet."
""
"O: The English Barleywine of Doppelbocks. Syrupy sweet, but pleasant throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This would be a great dessert beer, very palatable."
""
"Good LORD its too sweet.  Alcohol is not hidden either."
"2012 Vintage. Pours a beautiful amber red with a small off-white head. Medium to high carbonation. The nose hits you with dark fruit and bready notes. The taste follows the nose but is extremely sweet with some vanilla that rounds off the dark fruits, caramel malt and alcohol. Reminds me of a sweet alcohol syrup. I can only imagine having this with a meal or a substantial dessert. It finishes slightly dry. This is definitely a sipper."
""
""
""
""
""

"Very sweet and bready.  Despite the higher alcohol content, quite easy to drink and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a medium to dark orange amber with very light carbonation, just a few light patches and a thin ring around the glass. Aroma of sweet caramel and bready malt, toffee and light cardboardy oxidation. Flavor is very sweet with concentrated cherry, dark stone fruit, toffee and caramel malt. Finishes with spicy fruit, caramel malt, a bit boozy, but plenty of flavor to back up the alcohol. Heavy bodied, nearly syrupy, which is enhanced by the low ABV. Quite a remarkable ale, the doppelbock is there, but on steroids. So sweet and syrupy it seems like it should be cloying, but the sweetness and alchohol are melded into the great malt and fruit flavors. Almost like the apertif version of a bock. Not for the sweet adverse, but a great dessert beer and pleasant late evening drink. Deserves its classic name and reputation."
""

"This beer is truly a quaffable, drinkable glass of liquid diabetes. It's very good, but very potent, and the intense sweetness is sure to turn some people off. Would make a good sipper over a good long hour (or more!)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OMG, this is good!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting beer, extremely flavorful. Not a text book example of a doppelbock, but fun to try. Much too sweet for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - absolutely delicious. A must have."
"My ratings are loosely based on memory, as I was in neither the mindset nor setting for a proper tasting. However, I will say this: this beer knocks you out in the caliber of the craft and ABV. I had it for breakfast while visiting Spain, hardly appreciating its beauty. What I would give to try this again correctly... Don't pass up an opportunity to enjoy this."
""
""
""
""
"Strong nose, and on the palate... bam! This is a big syrupy, caramelly, honey-raisin-rummy, silky doppelbock! It's a very powerful taste and mouthfeel, definitely a dessert beer because this would be hard to follow."
""
""
""
""
"O: At $6.50 a bottle, I'd call this the bargain of the century... You'll never find a more perfect embodiment of what a doppelbock can be. The Austrians have come up with one amazing beer... If I ever see this again, I will most certainly buy it again, and I would recommend it to anyone who has ever tasted beer. Simply Amazing..."
""
""
""
"Cold bottled, syrup consistency, similar to blackberry juice, tick but not creamy. Malt, dried fruit, caramel, oak tree and some smoke in smell and taste. Honey and rum at the end. Dark and heavy, ideal for dark chocolate, and beer chocolate cake. Not too sweet, nor too dry. Cigars, apples, rye, and more to be found."

"O - Can't believe this beer is 14%. If you love Belgian quads and strong dark ales, then this is a must. This beer might be a tad too sweet for some but I appreciate the complexity of sweet flavours that exhibit great balance and finish."
"O - This beer is smooth with nice flavor development. I get a warming sensation from the high abv. I should sleep well tonight!"
"DATE REVIEWED: May 23, 2014... GLASSWARE: Celebrator Doppelbock... OCCASION: state playoffs drama--7th inning interrupted by rain to resume tomorrow... APPEARANCE: a fizzing head vanishes into air, leaving a dark amber, reasonably effervescent body the color of iced tea; zero lacing--one wonders where the head went, until one realizes the alcohol kills this ascetic beauty... AROMA: powerful sugar malts create a candied aroma; a syrupy suggestion too promises a sweet malty experience floral notes suggest hops are not balanced but are present... PALATE: instant burn, like a rum-drenched swizzle stick broke apart; to be taken in sips! alcohol comes in hot and challenges ... TASTE: rum/candy sweet--slightly smoky as a scotch might bee; some caramel and toffee, but predominantly a menacing malt that dares to be consumed--I like challenges, but wow...OVERALLL: I recalled the experience of sipping this in Russell's almost two decades ago, and I knew this review would reveal my inability to enjoy the finer, more precious things in life. Complex enough to be cellared and sipped, unique enough to be an acquired taste, I cannot pretend to have an affinity (my wife smirks at my struggle from the couch)... the beer grows in its attractiveness as the glass drains, but the full-bodied nature demands something intense as a pairing, like a rich chocolate cake...."
"Overall: This is an excellent beer, incredibly balanced and tons of complexity. I'm looking forward to grabbing one to see how it ages. Definitely would recommend."
"The label reads ""MALT LIQUOR"" for a reason as this is a straight malt bomb. It starts with strong chocolate malt but settles into a dark fruit, fig, prune and raisin. It finishes with a strong alcohol brashness in flavor and feel. Overall it's pretty good and fairly varied but 14 pct ABV is forever evident."

"Overall: I respect the style of this beer and understand its significance, however, I do not need to drink it again. The thick aroma and flavor calls for a very small pour. It is an attractive beer, but not one that I would recommend for a social event, it is for a late evening of sipping, thinking, reading, and writing. The high ABV has a very calming and warming effect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: First time having this beer, and definitely enjoyed it. The resemblance to a well made cocktail in both flavor and texture was uncanny. Definitely a sipper, but something I'll be reaching for again next year."
""
"I love high ABV beers, I have an open mind, and I love everything about the brewing craft. But this...thing....candy-coated cigarette ash that has been doused in bottom shelf bourbon. Holy hell I havent had a beer this bad in a long time. Gives me the haunted shivers I got when I tried a sip of bud light chelada. Whoever you are that brewed this batch (or beer in general) there is a special spot in hell for you. Right next to the chelada guy."

"O- super sweet and definitely a sipper, but the sweetness does not overpower. Great sweet bread flavors that one would expect from a doppelbock. I'd love to get another bottle to see what some age does for it, but it drinks just fine fresh"
"O - An expertly crafted dopplebock, and one I'd love to try fresh to compare the flavors to the aged bottle I had. Absolutely delightful!"
""
""
""
"O: this is a classic. I'm going to buy one and age it to see how it does. This bottle I drank is fresh."
""
""
""
"With the age at hand, this isn't difficult to drink at all. The amount served to me was perfect, but I could easily split a bottle of this. I used to hear divided things about this - that it was too sweet, too boozy, and pricey for the effort required to finish it. I say - give it some time, let it mellow out over a decade, maybe even two. You'll find yourself, in the end, with one of the most fantastic elixirs in the beer world, bar none. I wish I had more bottles of this vintage to age for the next decade, but alas, I'll have to dig deeper to find more. If you can find a bottle that's at least 8-10 years old, don't miss out the chance to try this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer, definitly not for everyday."
"O: Not complex at all but still delicious. Elementary, you might say. Cough medicine-like syrup with shit loads of alcohol, what's not to like!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite, but I'd love to try this aged. Always worth a try even with a steep import price. Go get it."
"A very sweet and tasty beer."
"The roundness of this beer is very impressive. The heavy alcohol works perfectly with no astringency. Looks great in a glass as well."
""
""
""
""
"I have never had anything like this. Perfect."
""
"Overall: Fat and very sweet - never was a fan of these two. But it's definitely an interesting beer, just not my style. Would recommend to try it, if your into sweet shit - you'll probably love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unmistakeably a work of genius."
""
""
""
"A decadent beer even though its on the sugary side. It could be more dry."
""
""
""
"Appropriate beer for the Sugar Bowl, go Mizzou! Back-end feel is a bit too weird for me to give monumental rating. It's good and recommended, just with a grain of salt."
""
"Overall, this is amazing. Words don't do it justice. It's easy to drink, but be careful, I can feel the alcohol kicing in after just one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: my experience with dopplebocks is pretty limited, but I can say that those I have tried were a little less full and potent than this beer. I enjoyed Samichlaus, and I think that as others have noted it may need more age on it to soften it. I will try this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.31, an A. Samichlaus Classic is by far the best Austrian beer I've had the pleasure of trying so far, as well as one of the most unique brews to grace my glass in a long time. This one isn't for the faint of heart, and if malty, boozy monsters aren't up your alley I can't see it being worth your time - as for me, this is a nice change-up from the usual fare and it makes a fantastic winter warmer. Glad I picked up another bottle to cellar for a few years, since that seems to be the preferred way to handle this stuff."
"Further edit: some say this has to be aged for at least 2 years and then its true power is revealed. To that I say, why release it if it's undrinkable as-is? They already aged it for 10 months before bottling or whatever, if it needs two more years to not be horrible, why not hang on to it for that long and then send it to stores?"
""
"O: Unreal is an understatement. This brew is in a realm of its own. Even though its a labeled as a doppelbock it reveals itself to be so much more than that. The tradition of this brew dating back to the 1970's and also being brewed once a year on December 6th has an alluring quality that might form a bias for most but this beer is big and for real. Don't miss out on this beer if you see it at your local beer shop."
"My expectations may have been too high, but not the dignified ""classic"" I expected..."
"Overall: I can't describe this beer in any good way. Smells of sweetness, tastes too sweet, over cloyingly sweetness overwhelms anything that could have been."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - enjoyable after dinner sipper for sure that keeps you warm on a cold winter day. Would probably be okay splitting this with someone."
""
""
"Overall. It very sweet and syrupy and I would have enjoyed it more if the bottle was maybe 5 oz and not 11.2. It is like desert in a glass."
""
""
""
"O- Had always passed on this beer but finally choose this one tonight. I'm pretty disappointed in this one, it is just way too sweet."
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely heated up my gut. Mouthfeel was full and pleasant, but I could not get past the cloyingly sweet finish, with a lingering aftertaste that I found highly unpleasant. To each his own, but I'm not impressed."
""
""
"4.75/5 would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is ia bit too sweet for me, although the prominent alcohol heat warmed me up quickly and helped me forget some of it's less appealing aspects. Always up for trying huge beers, but find many times there are too many trade-offs in the balance department."
""
""
""
""
"This is an intriguing beer and one that everyone should try at least once. I wish I could have done a vertical because honestly, I think this would be better with a little more alcohol heat. This is so mellow at this stage in the game it's too one-dimensional. Samichlaus was revolutionary two decades ago in America but at this point we have surpassed it by strides. Drink this next to something like Sucaba and you will probably agree. I get that one is a high gravity lager and the other an American take on an English barleywine but the flavor profiles are pretty similar. This even looks like a barleywine. I can't believe how much I flipped my lid over this all those years ago!"
""
"Overall- Pretty good beer. I fully understand the polarization that this beer causes. This is not a beer for the novice or anyone who likes lighter styles. This is not a beer that you should really drink more than one of. I would love to see what aging will produce. Definitely worth a try if you like big, bold, malty beers."
""
""
"In ""The Naked Pint", Perozzi and Beaune describe this beer as a sought-after rarity and I have seen such a reference elsewhere. Alberta is improving by leaps and bounds but we are not a craft beer Mecca yet. Nevertheless, one can find this beer if one looks, in both Cowtown and Edmonchuk. Got mine at Co-op in the former, a nondescript bottle that boldly claims to contain some of the world's finest. Pours a dark brown with reddish highlights, was for some reason excepting pitch black. Aroma is very sweet, like dark fruits, a bit musty like old wine. Palate is indeed complex but largely along a sweetness dimension. There is a bit of an old fermented flavor that veers into brett territory and a twinge of earth and wood, but this is a deep, dark, and rich complex of sweet flavors that hit rum, butter cream, tiramisu, rich toffee, vanilla, and molasses notes ... No clear hops noted. Minimal bitterness and although the body is unexpectedly thin, finish is clingingly sweet. Overall effect recalls port. Awesome ""dessert"" beer that one could pour on ice cream. My preferences would dictate more bitterness to balance the sweetness but this is not an IPA and should be judged on the basis of what it is: Something that defies style and provides a pretty unique glimpse into what a sweet beer is capable of doing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"-Overall, this an astringent overly sweet malt syrup that just lingers, no balance or compelixty. This could be sold as a cheap port ($5 for 12oz port is on the cheaper side). Not for me, the more I drink the more I hate it. Drain pour the second half of bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I could go on. I really could; But if there's a point I want to really drive home it's just how much this beer is a child of magnificent artistry and how it should be had by damn near anyone and everyone who is serious about craft beer."
""
""
""
"O: This beer was somewhat different than what I'm used to but it was nice. Definitely a winter sipper. A whole glass could definitely over encumber your palate with sweetness and booze but once in a while its nice."
""
""
"O: Pretty boring and very boozy. No major taste flaws, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"I don't get it...everyone seems to love this beer. It is the worst beverage I've had the displeasure of consuming. And I drank bong water once..."
""
"WAY too sweet for my taste buds. It's probably partly due to the age of the bottle, but I found this beer way out of whack. They need to bump up the hop bitterness somewhat to counteract the overwhelming alcoholic sweetness."

"***I tried to reflect this in my rating. I've never had anything like this, but the ratings are based on my understanding of beer and how it works. Thus, the appearance is shit, to be quite honest, but since it is so high in alcohol content, that is to be expected. As for the rest, this beer has qualities that I don't particularly enjoy in other beers, but that seem to fit really well in Samichlaus Classic***"
"Overall - a definite sipper and one of those beers I can't enjoy on a regular basis but a couple of times a year, especially when it's cold outside this becomes the right sipping beer over the course of an hour or two with a good book. Definitely I will look forward to revisiting once a year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish amber with almost no head. Aroma begin with a hint of whiskey, followed by some boiled candy syrup. Taste begin with a powerful malty blast, followed by some honey, then a toasty, sweet, alcoholic finish. Super rich mouthfeel. Overall a very good beer, though I would prefer a bit more hop bitterness for balance."
""
""

"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"Overall: Well, there we go. I finally cast off my shackles of ignorance and tried the fabled Doppelbock. Was I impressed? More intrigued if anything. Samichlaus Classic was certainly an experience, and perhaps I should've inaugurated myself with something a little less intense. If extreme beer is your forte, have at it. Will definitely be trying this little ditty again after I've explored the Doppelbock scene a bit more."

"O: A very amazing beer, with a complex flavour all build up in its malts and alcohol. I think that a more hoppy bitter would make this beer better, but it is very unique and special beer, the problem is that beer is a little cloying which makes difficult drink more than one bottle in a session."

"pours a clear, deep garnet/ruby red, half inch of head dies very quickly to just a bit around the rim, which quickly goes to essentially nonexistent. i'd like to see just a little more carbonation; not a lot, just a tad. simple, solid taste; not a lot going on, but considering the abv, it's remarkably drinkable, though definitely on the sweet side. a bit sweeter than i care for, but i'm thinking it's intentional to help hide the alcohol. nose seems somewhere between apples, raisins, caramel. taste is, again, a bit fruity, warming up and showing a bit of booze. as it warms the sweet starts getting a bit distracting. feel is smooth, a bit syrupy. very glad to have tried this. not something to have often (it's almost a ""six pack in a bottle""), but i have to give it a thumbs up."

"Similar to a barleywine. It is simply not for me. Too one dimensional in character - straight syrup and alcohol."

"The beer pours surprisingly as a deep ruby red color that melds towards brown, but not black. A fizzing soapy head appears with the pour but quickly dissipates, though a constant torrent of carbonation bubbles can be seen rushing to the top of the beer and replenishing the light ring that is left of the head. This beer seems very active in carbonation. The beer’s body is lager clean and clear, and actually reminds me more of a dark carbonated juice or soda more so than a beer. It actually looks thin, if that makes any sense, but it is still very pretty in the glass. The beer also displays a nice light set of legs from the alcohol. On the nose, the beer smells of sweet dark fruits and brown sugar with an ever present backbone of cloying booze, though it is really not too strong. Dates are surprisingly the dominant fruit smell from the malt, followed by slight raisin and sweet plum accents, and there is definite grainy cereal malt smell ghosting behind all of the other scents. This beer doesn’t actually smell as large as it is though, which is weird. It smells clean and drinkable with a noticeable amount of alcohol, but not 14%. On the tongue, the beer tastes thick and cloyingly sweet with a light acidity. The flavor begins as big sweet fruit flavors assault the tongue, moving from apple juice to brown sugar coated raisins, to rum raisins, to a touch of caramel, and even a little bit of muscato sweet grape wine, finishing with a big cloying alcohol. The flavor oddly reminds me of Midas Touch from Dog Fish Head, only there is a lot more alcohol burn on the back of the throat, and it feels a lot heavier in the stomach and more balanced with its fruit flavors. The flavors begin big and stay big, the finish gives hiccups of sweet bread and caramel, in between the cloying sweet fruit of the malts, and a very faint hint of clean yeast flavoring can be detected. The finish is medium to long in length, and definitely leaves a sticky sweet patch on the tongue. The aftertaste is only a faint lingering of sweet fruity malt on the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy, yet surprisingly thin and clean in body, sitting somewhere just above medium. Carbonation provides a thick scrubbing, which works to keep the cloying nature of the malt in check, though it doesn’t quite succeed. The carbonation is not so much fierce on the tongue as soothing. The mouth is left sticky sweet and wet with saliva after the beer leaves it. Overall, I’m not sure what to think. This is a great huge lager with some nice complexities, but I really can hardly see myself even finishing a 12 oz. bottle. This beer is clearly an after dinner dessert drink, and should be drunk like a scotch. It is thick and heavy on the stomach, but interesting and pleasing. This beer is a sipper for sure, but is properly complex, and is worthy of a taste for the fact that it is the strongest lager in the world, if not because it has some interesting character and flavors. This is an interesting beer."

"Slightly reddish brown in colour, quite red against the light. Tastes almost as if it's infused with whisky or bourbon - quite boozy in taste. Much less viscuous than I thought it would be given its alcohol. Smells almost as if it's barrel-aged. Sharp yet sweet initial taste that settles into sweet afterwards."

"Definitely interesting to try this 2007 vintage. Interesting take on the a doppelbock, which is seeming more and more like a last minute ""catch all"" category due to large variances present within the style. Heavily boozy and potent, sticky and sweet, yet despite that, Samichlaus may just be a bit boring and doesn't really exceed expectations in any category. Above average and something that obviously ages well, but nothing I would reach for regularly."

"Dark caramel, brandy, red grape, hard-tack, cherry, toffee, and more sweetness. Lots of booze and candi sugar with a doppelbock malt base that has been distorted to handle the high ABV. Tuned-up, like an eisbock, and I'm not sure of the exact lagering method. 14% is never laboring if it's drunk at a slow speed. A perfect winter warmer. Languid body with syrupy thickness and not much carb to propel it, it's still a remarkable drink. Just be careful."

"(2 yr old) Clear Amber in body with no head, just a thin eclipse of white around the edges. Aroma of apple juice, prunes, booze, something reminiscent of ketchup. Big flavors: prunes, grape candy, booze slicks the palate, bubblegum, black cherry aftertaste. Rum-like. Medium bodied with light carbonation and syrupy. Dark fruit fantasy, booze hides well in the flavors."
""
"Edit: had a bottle aged for 1 year and liked it even more - had largely the same thoughts as the first review, but was getting a hint of chocolate that gave a sense of black forest cake; also found the sweetness was cut by carbonation and a slightly dry finish; amazing to have with dark chocolate"
""
"Final Thoughts: This one is all about the malt, and if you like sweet malt taste, you will love this beer. It's a bit too cloying for my liking, but it's worth a shot."
""
""
"I would suggest pairing with something to complement the sweetness; not sure what though."
"The mouthfeel is oddly flat yet tingly at the same time, and a pervasive stickiness coats the lips unapologetically. This beer certainly doesn't lack for boldness, though I'm afraid it may be a bit much for my tastes (and I say this as a man of bold tastes myself). The sweetness becomes cloying as the beer warms, and the 14% ABV certainly isn't going anywhere either. An adventure to be sure, but one may be enough for any but the staunchest alconaut."

"M - Medium body. Dry. Light carbonation."
"A squeaky clean dobbelbock with perhaps a little too much sugar, though the extra sweetness helps make it a wonderful digestivo. Reminds me a little of Baladin's Xyauyu'(without the oxidation) and is just as unique. Absolutely worth seeking out if you're into sweet after-dinner drinks. If you don't, you'll probably think it's too sweet."
""
"Clear ruby red-brown, ring of white head, no lace at all. Smell is of fruit and alcohol, cherry, huge malt bill here, dark bread and sugars, caramel and more dark fruits, again more alcohol but restrained for 14%. Taste is malty and fruity, sugar coated dark fruit in alcohol, cherry and a bit medicinal, sweet toffee and bread, more alcohol heat aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, full body, very chewey and syrupy as well. This was pretty good for being so strong and so young, something I can see improving with age, the next bottle I have of this wont see the light of day for the next 5-7 years."

"Overall: I've put off trying this beer for a long time. What was I thinking?! I would only recommend this to a mature drinker, my girlfriend just about passed out trying this one. Has the feel of drinking a glass of cognanc or brandy. Classics are classics for a reason and this is certainly a good one."

"Overall – A little too much of a wee heavy flavour to this one for me - which isn't my favourite style of beer. It's still an interesting beer that clocks in at 14% and is remains quite drinkable. I've go a few more to see how they develop over the years."
"Thankfull the beer drinks much better than the nose. Smooth like a port wine. Sweet sugary taste balanced with a touch of alcohol heat. Has a sherry like woodiness. Aged amazingly, velvet like mouth feel, incredibly smooth with good balance between sweetness and alcohol. Very impressive."

"(4.0) D: This is very good and I’ll be aging a bottle or two more, along with drinking a couple more as is."
"overall, though, i'd have to say it's a worthwhile endeavor; just dont allow it to get warm, i imagine. the 14% abv will surely come out to bite ya then. it's a stately brew, even while sitting in my pathetic 11oz butwiper clydesdale mug."

"O: Bottled in 2012. Loving this one. I think its great, like nothing I’ve ever tasted before. Love the sweetnes and the complex flavours, as well as the bottle with the pic. Definitely a sipper or dessert beer."
"Pours with a two-finger, bubbly white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Crystal ruby/amber color. Light carbonation and light - medium bodied. Nose is sweet raisins and alcohol, flavor is smooth and sweet dark fruit and honey. NOT a session beer - the 14% ABV is quite noticeable . . . savor this beer. $5.10 for a 330ml bottle, from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me. Bottled in 2010 - cellars well."

"Great winter brew - definitely planning on holding on to a few of these for next Christmas."

"O - This stuff is not for the faint of heart. More of an after dinner dessert type drink, and a sweetness reminiscent to ice wine. It's a sipper and the first of the style of brew that is genuinely unique and memorable. Well worth seeking out, but certainly not something I could drink more than one of in a single sitting."
"O: definitely a sipper - I could imagine how aging this would mellow out the overall burn of the alcohol, establishing the malt more, finding balance, very likely turning this into a 5-start brew somewhere down that line"

"Rating: 4/5 (If the aftertaste would have lasted a few minutes longer, I might have given this a 5/5. But with that weak aftertaste, I can’t go all the way. The flavor is great… but I have to rate on all aspects of the beer, not just the flavor.)"
"Complex way beyond complex. All the things said about this really special brew are probably true, and few of us are really qualified to review such a rare example of brewing arts. It is almost syrupy, sweet, sugary and oh, did I mention it packs a major league wallop of 14%ABV, careful. And yes, the alcohol is up front, but give it a few seconds to settle on the tongue and combined with tons of absurdly good flavors this brew is astounding, and I am glad to add a 4 pack (3 remaining) to my cave under the steps. I tried a 2010 vintage, it is newly 2013 so if it got better over the last few years, look out, this one is dangerously beautiful."
""
"Dark brown, slightly red and crystal clear. No head to speak of. Oaky smell of a good tawny port, fruit cake and alcohol. The taste tells me my nose was right. This is very much like a tawny port or creamed sherry. Also a similar warming alcohol sensation after the swallow. There are some hops in there, but they’re dominated by a wonderful sweetness. Mouth-feel is thick and almost oily with little detectable carbonation. I’m not sure this fits into the Doppelbock category, but this is one unique and awesome brew!"

"Beer pours a dark reddish-brown with a thin white head. Smell is of caramel malt, candied sugar, dark fruit and a good amount of nuttiness. It honestly smells like an aged Belgian quad and is rather impressive. Flavor follows the nose - it's sweet up front, but not overwhelmingly so, then it finishes with an awesome malty nuttiness, again, just like a quad. It hides its 14% incredibly well and is certainly unlike any doppelbock I've ever had. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, nothing particularly positive or negative here. Overall, I'm really quite impressed with this beer. I've never had it fresh, but I can certainly imagine that it's sweeter and boozier, and thus some age does this one some serious good. This is an impressive beer that ages as well as any quad out there and has a similar flavor profile. Go buy a 2012 now and stash it in the cellar for 3+ years."

"A somewhat underwhelming appearance and smell will surprise you once the taste and mouthfeel come in to play. For a 14% ABV doppelbock, though, I'd say this one is pretty decent. Plenty of doppelbock character abound in this heavy hitter. A must-try for doppelbock and big beer fans. Heck, I may spring for a four-pack and let 'em age for a year or so and see how this beer plays out with some time."

"Samichlaus 2009 vintage pours a brilliant garnet color, with a thin sliver of a head. Practically no carbonation. Appearance looks syrupy. The aroma is bursting with sweet, fruity esters, fresh cut flowers, and plenty of malt sugar to go along with it- wonderful! The alcohol heat is immediately apparent, but it does not take away from the flavor, which consists of port wine, molasses, spiced rum, dark fruits, candy, bittersweet chocolate, and sweet tea. This beer is literally packed with layers of complex, sweet flavor aspects! Very full-bodied, and by the way, its even labeled as a 'malt liquor,' which is surely due to a particular region's definition of beer in regards to the ABV. Great for a dessert beer or something to finish out the night!"
"This was $4.99 at World Market. I bought one to try and then rushed back that same night to buy more. Probably shouldn't have driven on this 14% beer but was overcome with the need to have a stock in my cupboard :)"
"I got the Large Bottle! 3 Liters of Samichlaus! $80 well spent! It was great!! The bottle is 2007 brew, better than the 2010 versions. it was the full dark version, not the red-label. If you can find it...I suggest the large bottle of Samichlaus for hours for fun!!!"

"Pours amber with strong ruby red hues. One and a half finger foamy head that recedes fairly quickly; not surprising as the head of high abv brews usually have little to no retention. Boozy, but inviting nose filled with ripe fruit, brown sugar, and phenol alcohol. Initially, a ton of ripe fruit notes: appleskin, pear, cherry, hints of date, joined by caramel and abundant malt with biscuity tones. Finishes fairly dry with continued caramel notes and booze. Smooth, syrupy, full body with moderate to low carbonation that fights its way through here and there. This is just a fantastic sipper and truly a one of kind brew. Appropriately enjoyed on Dec. 6, St. Nicholas Day, the one and only day the new batch of this beer is brewed annually."

""
"O: Overall I'd say I'm about 50-50 on this beer. Part of me likes it for the depth and complexity of what the malt is presenting, the other part of me does not appreciate how difficult it is to drink. I would recommend it if you're climbing Mt. Everest, and you have run out of your hard alcohol."

"I was looking forward to this one. I bought it about 6 months ago and I've been waiting for the right time to crack it open. I can only say I'm awfull disappointed. It is ridiculously sweet and the flavors are an array of things I don't like. Rum & raisin notes abound and something feels totally unbalanced about it. It was just too much, too sweet. Maybe it was a bad vintage?"
"This beer is simply amazing."

"O: A smooth potent beer sure to take the chill out of a cold winters night. Another beer that would be a fine after dinner cordial but given the level of sweetness this is more for the port drinker that the scotch drinker."
"What a creamy mouthful of a wonderful Dobblebock. This beer (bier) was like drinking a sherry/ bourbon like with out any bit. The malt was well balanced with light hop finish. Great complexity. I need to get some more before its gone. I had the 2011 bottle."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and lots of sweet caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild spice-like bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but quite strong."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear caramel brown with no head and plenty of rising tiny bubbles. The beer smells very sweet almost like honey. Like the Samichlaus Helles, it almost reminds me of the scent of mead. I pick up the chocolate notes that I would expect from a darker doppelbock. The alcohol is also detectable in the nose. The taste is very sweet, almost like a sweet mead. The slight chocolate notes from the malt I detected in the nose are also there. The alcohol heat is much better concealed than in was in the Samichlaus Helles. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is very smooth. For a sipper, this is very easy to sip. This is a most excellent beer. It's a world class doppelbock."

"Overall, this is an amazing beverage, and just about as far from an Anheuser-Busch product as it’s possible to get and still be called beer. There are levels and potencies of flavor in here that are both impressive and delicious. The beer does have just a bit too much sweetness--something that will likely be tempered with cellaring--and does have a slight alcoholic vapor permeating everything (the 14% ABV making itself well known), but is, despite these, one of the more impressive brews in existence. Must try."

"This is a full bodied brew that is thick and chewy. The alcohol is right out in the open here with a solid warming factor and mild fruity flavoring. The layers of burnt sugars are the main component of this brew. I have no doubt this brew can be aged for quite a bit more time. It is significantly different than I remember having this fresh on draft in its own unique way. If you haven't had this brew yet, what are you waiting for?"
"O- I didn't know what I was getting into with this. Brewed once a year, aged for 10 months to find out it's a Doppelbock. That kind of attention is reserved for stouts of high caliber. This beer is up there in caliber and it is just going to get better with further aging."

"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small alcohol presence, a small sweetness and spices.

"11.2 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass; bottled in 2006. Pours fairly clear red orange color with a small foamy off white head that reduces to nothing pretty quickly. Expected for a beer of this magnitude. A decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge caramel, molasses, toffee, biscuit, raisin, plum, vanilla, toasted grain, light herbal, wood, and a touch of alcohol. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, biscuit, raisin, molasses, plum, vanilla, wood, and slight herbal. Slight herbal spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, molasses, vanilla, raisin, biscuit, and herbal on the finish for a while. Great balance of flavors with nice complexity; and no cloying sweetness at all. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is extremely well hidden at 14%, with almost no warming at all. Extremely smooth to sip on. Overall this is a delicious doppelbock at its current age. Big flavor and balance; and very smooth to sip on, with the alcohol level extremely well hidden."

"Tasty stuff. I’m impressed Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg can do this much within the lager style, but then again, they’ve been at this for a while."
"O: This is not a real easy drinking beer and is much more of a sipping beer, similar to a cordial or dessert wine. The beer is very sweet in smell and taste, cloyingly so, which definitely does not make it a sessionable beer. Enjoyable but a slight bit too much alcohol warmth to be easy to enjoy."

"Pours a deep clear medium copper color with faint hints of orange at the edges. A seemingly endless stream of carb bubbles rise to the surface creating an off white head that persists forever. The smell is quite sweet with wafting aromas of prunes, plums, burnt sugar, caramel, and sweet candy sugar. There's a hint of alcohol in there as well but at 14% I imagined there would be and it seems well integrated. The taste is quite sweet and syrupy. Candied and burnt sugars are up first followed by light bits of dark fruits then a bit of wet cardboard and a long lingering warming alcohol in the finish. Thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet sticky syrupy mouthfeel. I enjoyed this one, but it is a big beer and definitely a sipper. Not something I would drink often, but nice to try."

"Overall this is a unique brew, certainly worth trying and certainly worth saving a few and aging. This is a wine-lover's beer though as it enters the realm of fruityness beyond what you would expect from a purely malt beverage. This goes to show you that malt can produce truly unique and fruit-like flavors, and do it without hops."

"That being said, this was a really strong beer and wasn't afraid to show it. I tend not to be crazy about them but anyone who is a fan of Bocks or Dopplebocks ought to give it a try.

It certainly isn't cut out for the faint of heart."

"Half finger head on a amber with golden hues clear body. No real lacing. Very spivey with nutmeg and gingerbread notes. Flavor is very sweet and syrupy with a cherry and strawberry note. Medium body and light carbonation. The reviews for this one are off the charts but for me it was too thick and syrupy and sweet. I appreciate the bock contents though."

"An amazingly awesome beer! First off, when poured into a pint glass, you notice the rich, deep amber color, and the aroma of sweetened malts. The beer comes to a frothy halt at the top of the glass and settles with the perfect amount of head and lace, with not being over-carbonated. The beer's taste is sweet with ripe malts and barley with an obvious note of grains and alcohol. The mouthfeel is to die for as you swallow the beer, you still have a presence of the brew in your mouth and a note of the aroma in your nose. What an amazing beer!"

"Unfortunately this is Vintage 2002 bottle, from the old brewery. Poured into a goblet with slight white head that dissipates quickly. The color is of light copper and there is faint appearance of syrup much like a schnapps. The nose is of warm caramel and fusel alcohols. the taste is farmiliar to in content to a ""fresh"" Samiclhaus with the thick sryupy body of big malt. It's just that it is completely smooth! the heat of alcohol is gone. I am glad I aged this for 10 years and now there is only one left from my 2002 six pack."

"Appearance is dark copper with a finger of head that dissipated quickly and left only some fizziness behind. The nose is distinctly of the candied fruits of the Christmas season. Sweet malt dominates and the sweetness grows as one goes along. There is a slight alcohol burn in the finish that is not unpleasant. The entire offering is certainly interesting, but not terribly well balanced either."
"Poured into a tuliped snifter. Pours a dark amber (maple syrup) with a thin, whispy head. Aroma had a and hints of dark dried fruits. Silky mouthfeel and the taste was very seductive with rich booziness, caramel malt notes and some sweet dark dried fruits, a good dark estery sweetness (think dried dates and figs)."

"O- very nice beer, but it comes up well shy of being great. The potential is there, but with 5 years on it there's not enough uumph from the alcohol to counter the massive sweetness. It never gets to be cloying, but darn it is close. Thankfully the deep, warm sherry notes are still enough to keep it from going over the edge."

"I like doppelbocks. I like Celebrator and Maximator a lot. Sam Adams is pretty good. I like Korbinian well enough. Spaten, one or two others. The style seems like a nice one. But this one tasted like balsamic vinegar mixed with something sweet. So did the Ettaler Curator doppelbock I tried after that to a somewhat lesser extent. Both were sour and vinegary. Do not like. Couldn't get through a 4 oz taster. I wonder what makes these two come out like this."

"O: I don't feel like this was a beer. Very sweet, thick, syrupy, and hardly any carbonation, this beer is more like a liquor. I sadly can't say that I enjoyed this beer. I also think that this shouldn't be classified as a bock(There is no beer I can think of comparing). I say pick up one for bragging rights, and complexity. Otherwise, I can't see anyone drinking this on a daily basis."

"O: not worth waiting another year - just have it when you buy it. This is too sweet."

"Not a bad idea to share this one. This one is very sweet and the flavors are very pronounced with lots of sharp alcohol. Good to look at and smell but drinking this can be a little overbearing. I suppose it would be nice to share this small bottle several ways."
"The body is full with nice carbonation. This is alright. I don't think I would get it again though. It's just a bit too sweet."
"O - Sweet, fruity, spicy and seriously hot, this is a sipper if Ive ever come across one. There is plenty to savour though. If you like them sweet then get yourself one of these when they pop up."
""
""
"Tasted very sugary and fruity with some bitterness and some spices, but not enough to counter the fruity sweetness at all. They were so subtle that I don't even recall what spices I tasted specifically. Great beer. I'd say one of the best. But only if you're in the mood for something VERY sweet."
"Pours reddish amber, light from bottom to a darker top. Low little foam. Nose is plums, raisins, cherries. Dates too. Rich hearty syrupy taste. Heavy and sticky. Burning finish. Syrup sweetness at the beginning. Face puckering - a definite sipper. Warmth ensues. Abounding with flavor - difficult at first and a lot of time to pull down. Unique."
"I don't think I could do more than one of these in a sitting, but definitely worth a try if you're into big sweet, malty, beers!"
""
""
"Overall, I was pretty impressed with this. I had a 2009 bottle. It is awfully syrupy and sweet with a good burn, but still amazingly complex. It took me quite a while to finish this, an ultimate fireside sipping beer on Christmas Eve."

"Comes out of the tap a clear reddish amber with a decidedly ruby tone and a fine-bubbled pale tan head. Rich, spicy, malty aroma has tones of cloves, cinnamon and apple. Strong, mouth-filling flavor has malty, peppermint, apple and cloves notes plus hints of caramel and horehound, and is rather sweet but not cloying. Syrupy texture is quite fizzy."
"Overall: Really unique Doppelbock. Never had one this big and high in alcohol. It just not for me. Tame the booze down and that might help. The entire time I am drinking this beer ithiknk its missing something, but I can't figure out what it would be..."
""
""

""
"Overall, this has to be one of the most powerful beers out there. At 14%, it's something that should be savored and not chugged. Still, it's amazing and the flavors go well with it. This is a must try."
""
""
"Overall- This doppelbock is quite wonderful. The smell and taste strike a wonderful balance between spices and ester, raisin notes. The mouth feel is also fantastic. If ever in the mood for a higher alcohol sipper, you could hardly do better."
"Overall real special drink. Unfortunatly for myself this is way too sweet for my tastes, this really could use a food pairing I think. But I sure wouldn't turn one down, got to be in the right mood for this one I think."
""
""
"O: Very drinkable for a 14% ABV beer"
""
""
"Overall, I like the maltiness of this beer. The alcohol could be a little more hidden but I still find this quite enjoyable. I am biased somewhat by my wife's birthday and the date of this beer and still enjoy it quite a bit."

""
"Hot (heh) mess."

"Overall this beer is probably the best I've had for its style. Highly recommend."
""
"O --- I really enjoyed it. It has a whiskey likeness to it which I really enjoyed --- not over the top but enough to remind me this is a STRONG beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nope, this doesn't do it for me. In some senses I respect it for what it is. This was, at one point, the strongest beer in the world, but I've had beers that exceed it in both alcohol and balance. This feels like an outlier, an anomaly, and a beer brewed for the wrong reasons."
""
"O: Not too bad, also not great, it's a nice strong ABV beer with quite a bit of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"This beer wears it's age incredibly well-at nearly 7 years out, it is smooth as can be, with elegant sherry and nutty oxidation flavors and aromas. I would be wary about aging it too much longer as the oxidation characteristics may soon become too prominent, but I think this could easily make it to 10 years (if not further). Delicious, and dangerously easy to drink at this age-a truly wonderful beer."

"Samichlaus sips really well, and was very nice on a rather chilly 11-11-11 here in Durham, NC. I dont know how they say it in Austrian, but in German--Ein Prosit!"
"Pour is a wonderful copper/dark gold color. Little to no head retention and minimal lacing. WOW, sweet malt is huge on the nose Caramel, Vanilla bean and candied sugar follow through. Upfront sweet on the tongue and heavy malted goodness. Roasted vanilla and candy as you taste. Mouthfeel is medium to full body, hard to believe this is a lager. Finish is sweet and long. Very delicious brew. Just a great beer. Get it, Drink It, Love it...Cheers!"
"Overall, interesting example of a european barley wine. Tastes good with a very sharp hard cheese, like a parmigiana."
"Can't believe it has an alcoholic content of only 14% ABV, seems stronger to me: but I'm not used to such strong brews, I live in Shropshire!"
"Outstanding strong sipper for warming up by the fireside."
"O: I do not know about young Samichlaus. That makes it quite difficult to compare. However I can tell that the aging on this beer is really wonderful. The Madeira aromas are perfectly blending with the powerful malts and aging may also compensate for all the sugars in this beer. I will definitely have this again (and again !)."
"It's build good but proved to be too much for my palate. I'll save it for a steak marinade later."
"Overall, such a malt bomb - very sweet, very boozy, and a hell of a lot going on. For some reason, that I cant put a finger on, it reminds me of the holidays. At $5.50 per bottle ($.50 / oz) I dont think I will revisit this one - solid brew though."
"Overall an interesting lager with lots of complexity in aroma and taste, but it is a very sweet and boozy beer that lacks balance. But i think it is worth having at least once."
"O: Just way off my idea of good flavor. This beer is so not my style, and I can't help but feel I don't think time is going to change this beer enough for me. Simply too sweet, and too light in the body. If you like fresh 120 Minute IPA, then this is your doppelbock. Layers of sweetness, where low carbonation and popping sugar crystals collide in a dissonant juxtaposition of sweetness. Excuse me while I inject myself with insulin."
"Overall Impression- I'm definitely finding another one of these and aging it! What a great brew! Very rich, strong, and full of flavor and body. A big beer that is aloud to call it the most extraordinary brew in the world! Its funny I never heard/saw this when I lived in Wien for 6 months but maybe its because they say its from D'Autriche on the bottle... I recommend this to those who enjoy STRONG Doppelbocks, Barleywines, and brews with tons of strength."
"Wow, I'm glad I came across this one ... recommended to me by a liquor store owner in Tucson. I don't know if other breweries have attempted to create such a product ... if not, they should! It truly is an extraordinary beverage. I only wish the sweetness was scaled back a little bit. It's as though a dozen sugar cubes were dissolved into each bottle before capping. If you like sweet (like Southern Tier Creme Brulee'), give this one a try."
"M- Lights up your mouth with the alcoholic burn, but is more of a smoldering ember than a wildfire. Thick and sticky, you can enjoy this one long after the bottle is gone."
"Overall: This beer is not for the faint of heart. Smooth, yet a sipper. Creamy, yet more like a whisky than a beer. If you are a new-comer to great beers, this will scare the B'Jesus out of you. If you are a connoisseur (which if you spend time on this site, you should be), this is a sipper to be savored and is top notch. Next time, I get two and put one in the cellar for an extended period of time to age. Cheers!!"
"I will definitely seek out this beer in the future, and hope to enjoy it at various ages. It is one of the most drinkable beers I have tried at this level of ABV. Great doppelbock!"
"Beer remarkable for its ABV surprisingly digestible and tastes amazing."
"O: Great sipper for a cold night. Will be buying some more of this."
"O- This was an interesting beer but not great. Next time I'll try a fresher one."
"O: In retrospect as I compare the two bottles, and in light of the many good beers I've had between the two, I would say this beer is worth trying, but a little too watery/sweet for my tastes. I like the idea of this beer more than the drinking of it."
"overall pretty enjoyable. flavors are a little overpowering at times but definitely can appreciate it."
"Was turned onto this brew by one of the managers at our liquor store a few days ago. Said it was the most unique, rarest brew on earth lol. Open one last night. Like most reviews I've read on this, I would say that letting it age further would be in order. That said, this one was bottled in 2010. A bit sweet for my liking but grew on me the more I sipped. Alcohol bite on the backside was there but not bad. I can see this being a very good brew for one of them cold Minnesota nights. Going to take the 3 other bottles I have and store them for a couple years to age and mellow."
"O- It would take a sweet tooth to get one of these down. Thankfully, I'm up to the task. A very interesting brew."
"O: Drain pour. One and done. Tried it and did not like. Don't understand the hype. If I want strong alcohol...I'll take a rum or tequila."
"The Samichlaus classic is my second favorite beer I've had. A friend bought it so that we could sample a few of his favorite beers. I have a personal inkling for stronger beers, but there's a tendency of many to truly taste alcoholic in order to up the ABV. Samichlaus is certainly strong, but it manages to be little more alcoholic-tasting than an equivalent doppel with an ABV of just 8 or 9. Moreover, it has a delicious sweetness that was an absolute delight to my taste buds!"
"mouthfeel - very drinkable for 14 percent. hardly noticed the alcohol, light bodied and not too cloying."
"O- Really disappointed in this beer. Had it before and it's been really good. This was very average. Can't really recommend this beer unless you just want to drink a 14% beer."
"(D)- I can definitely see how this will really shine with a large number of years worth of age under its belt. Having this fresh definitely tells me this will last for decades with no problem; I look forward to finding out."
"It pours a clear brown color with a hint or red in there. Had a smell of booze and sweetness. It tasted very sweet and very alcoholic and i would say with a few years of age on it this beer will be phenomenal but right out of a fresh bottle it is too sweet and needs to mature."
"Legend goes, when St. Nicholas decked Arius, he was drunk on this stuff. Thereafter, this stuff was given to the bad girls and boys before the discovery of coal."
"O: Way too sweet for my taste and not aromatic enough. However, I think it has it's place in the beer universe as a winter beer (in cold climates, here in S. Florida it would be a stretch) that you enjoy slowly in front of a burning fireplace."
"Overall / Drinkability: I was thinking of holding this until July for a goofy ""Christmas in July!"" theme, but for whatever reason, I wanted it tonight 6 months from Christmas, even though Dec. 6 is the real date for this beer. And in a way I wish I had held onto this beer until the Winter. It's definitely a beer for sipping and warming one's self, and slowly enjoying over the course of an evening. I suspect it's this brew that keeps St. Nick mellow over the course of his gift giving, and maybe even keeps the Krampus in line. It's a very smooth beer with a nice alcoholic kick to it, one solely for savoring and passing the night with. While I think I could handle 400mL of this beer rather than 330mL, one bottle is enough. It's too powerful to have more than one, and in a way if I had more than one, I'd think I was missing the special point of this beer. I can see from reading this I'm rambling, but this is a beer that's made me ponder it a bit, and for that, overall I'm giving it a five. It's not amazing from a smell or appearance, but it really grows on you and makes you realize this is one special brew."
"Pours clear Redish Brown with a light tan head. Very musty aroma that turned to sweet as the beer sat for a while. May have been an old bottle. Very sweet and alcoholic took me a while to get through it. Too sweet for my taste. At 14% alcohol...sounds like truth serum to me."
"O - Easily one of my favorite beers fresh, this 2000 vintage stopped me in my tracks. This was a steal, I was able to grab 3 bottles of this for next to nothing. This brew changes from year to year and the different flavors and notes can be tracked, finding new levels of complexity. Find this beer and drink it fresh, vintage or age some yourself."
"Overall: A very good beer. The alcohol is not as well hidden as it could be and so the aftertaste will likely turn off those who cannot handle stronger drinks. Other than that this is a good take on the style."
"Poured a medium brown with a slight red hue around the edges and a small white fizzy head with no lacing to speak of. The aroma was heavy with the scent of toasted malts, a mild resin hop and a soapy yeast with notes of dried fruit (raisins and plums) and a strong does of alcohol. It tasted very sweet and a little acidic with almost a wine characteristic from the dried fruit from start to finish with a real warming sensation from the high alcohol content at the end. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and dry in texture with a medium carbonation. Overall a very boozy brew, a little more than I would have liked."
"O: A nice, big beer. I think this one would improve with some age-- will pick up some more to cellar for another year or two. When you're ready to try it, give yourself ample time-- one bottle can easily last a couple of hours or more."
"Poured out a dark/burnt brown with a ruby coloring. Almost no head. Just some traces of bubbles. The nose is very strong with a big amount of caramel malty sweetness that is balanced with the alcohol well. A lot of darker fruit flavors. Some deep red grapes and candied plums. The taste is very sweet and malty but also with a big amount of alcohol on the finish. Thick boozy body so it takes a while to drink."
"C"
"I think it lived up to its own hype. It's big and sweet but so easy to sip. It reminds me of port, it's better than dessert, it's an evening's companion and a night ender otherwise. I will endow this beer to my son upon his birth, then reclaim them from him on his 5th, 8th and 10th birthdays. Can't call it just a doppelbock in good conscience. Truly a treat."
"This is a crazy huge beer. I would seek this one out."
"This beer seems out of style a bit, but at 14% I suppose it is going to be a bit odd. It does have a nice flavor, it has plenty going for it, but too much here isn’t working for me. I would consider trying an older vintage though. I’m fairly certain many of these flaws will mellow and improve."
"Extremely loosely knit and delicate head, gets close to two fingers during the pour but dissipates explosively, gone rapidly into a thin layer across the surface,as one would expect the lacing is likewise haphazard and short-lived. Quite clear amber red in color, light enough that you get yellow aside the orange hues at the glass bottom and rims, a few lazy bubbles visible here and there. The nose is incredibly sweet and fruity, oodles of raisin, fig, date, prune along with plum, cherry scents, no lack of ginger, cinnamon spice, syrupy canned orange slices, lilac air spray, molasses and honey, milk chocolate, lighter raw cookie dough, nothing distinctly opposes the sweetness yet does not seem out of balance. Medium-bodied, hard to believe that it’s actually sweeter and more syrupy here in the mouth. This even with fairly sharp-edged carbonation and a peppery kick. Molasses, maple syrup, honey coat the tongue, then chocolate, ginger, juicily sour orange to lemon citrus help it retain a credible energy level. The cherry, apricot, fig, golden raisin, banana fruit thus avoids a darker fruit complexion while staying concentrated and sugary. More scone, croissant, pastry flakiness here. Not sure how they categorize this as a “Doppelbock,” it’s much more intense than most. No alcoholic burn and, again, stays balanced, absolutely a “dessert beer” and understandable why it’s released during the winter. (Bottled in 2009)"
"O- My dad used to give me whiskey in hot tea when I had a sore throat as a kid, I could see this as a substitute. I can imagine this becoming much better with age though, if the sweetness would die down. I didnt' taste the booze as much as others had which I suppose is a plus."
" I would like to try one of less age to compare and see what changes."
"D: This is definitely a sipper. The 14% ABV was obvious for me about half way through the beer. If given the opportunity – give it a try. Looking forward to cellaring the remaining three bottles for a bit longer to see how it changes."
"The first time I had this beer I was just starting to dabble in strong beers. At the time this power house was the strongest I had ever tried. This beer poured out as a deep copper color brownish red. The head was non existent. The carbonation was good though. The smell was sweet and boozie, the taste was also semi sweet and rather bitey. Lots of dark berries and malt creating a very complex brew. Overall this beer is pretty damn tasty and rather good for the winter season."
"Overall, I really enjoy taking this beer in over an evening, though I would truly appreciate a more commanding olfactory presence"
"Samichlaus has really become something of a legend over the years. It is good, but it's extremely sweet flavor and boozy character hold it back. Even after several years, it's still very warm. Having said that, it does have a nice flavor if you can tolerate the sweetness. It's definitely one of those beers that every BA should try at least once. Thanks for my opportunity, Chris."
"A great dopplebock but definitely a sipper. Alcohol burn may be a turn off to some but does not bother me. Extremely enjoyable"
"This brew is not for the rookie beer drinkers. Its monster-like ABV can kick even the best BA's Ass. It was a great brew none the less. It was super creamy. I will definitly get my hands on a few more of these. Age them some more and enjoy."
"D - Delicious, but the booze and the sweetness take a toll on your palate. Sip and enjoy."
" taste... damn! this baby is like a regular db on hgh. must say this has a nice balace with a high sipping quality to it. half way down and it gets better with every taste, might be to the temp rising. great sipper worht giving this Austrian dp a crack sometime."
"D- This is a slow drinking contemplative beer. The drinkability is medium as to be expected of a beer of this strength. Saint Nick skip my place every year but a snifter of Samichlaus more than makes up for it."
"For whatever reason, beer from this venerable Austrian brewery has never really floated my boat. Samichlaus Bier is supposed to be their flagship offering, but it too sinks under the weight of too much residual sugar and too much alcohol. A curiosity maybe, but light years away from being great beer."
"D: For being 14% ABV, there is hardly any trace of alcohol. This beer is smooth and sweet and delicious. Ages well and I will be in search for a bottle for myself."
"D. Suprisingly drinkable for 14%. Very complex and interesting beer. Drinks like a barleywine/doppelbock/strong ale mix. With the complexity and alcohol this beer has it kind of pushes the boundaries of what beer can be. Very close to being a liquor."
"drinkability; 14% abv. but easy to drink. If it wasn't for the high price I could drink a lot of this. Provides a very light and relaxing buzz of the highest quality, forget to respect this brew and one will be on thier ass in no time though."
"Overall an excellent beer, very unique and pleasurable."
"A bit too strong on the spice, especially to be considered a traditional doppelbock; however, after becoming accustomed to the flavors, more and more caramel begins to peek through, and it becomes very enjoyable--a trickster of a brew. A little too outrageous and unique for a top-notch pick, but it certainly has its good qualities, and a hell of a bite and ABV to boot."
"D: With as sweet as this beer is, it's not very drinkable. Overall, I could barely finish this beer and almost felt sick to my stomach from how sweet it was. The malt overpowers any subtleties that might otherwise be found."
"Picked this up at Ammersino Feine Getränke in Vienna, Austria. Crystal clear ruby-amber pour with really quickly fading thin head and minimal lacing. The nose is all malt with hints of orange, dark fruits, rasins and alcohol. The taste is just one huge, syrupy, sickly sweet malt bomb. Very complex with tons of dark fruits, maple syrup, orange jello, caramel, toffee, candy, molasses, cherries and brown sugar. The alcohol is overwhelming. Thick, syrupy, oily, and extremely rich mouthfeel combined with the over the top sweetness makes this nearly undrinkable for me. I'm shocked at the reviews. I know this is considered a world class beer, but I don't get it."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into a heavy chalice glass. Pours deep gold with hints of amber - and thin off-white head. The aroma has quite a bit of alcohol - but also a strong presence of malts, molasses, and vanilla with hints of banana and somewhat reminiscent of a manzanilla sherry. The flavor is warm on the tongue from alcohol (burns like a strong wine or a weak spirit) - but not in a bad way (if you like whiskey, you certainly won't mind it). The flavor has lots of fruit for a lager - pear, figs, caramel candied apples - and some sweet malt along with hints of marsala wine and calvados (apple brandy). The alcohol also warms the back of the throat as it goes down (again, not unlike a spirit). The finish is sweet and has a lingering fruit and alcohol after-taste - the alcohol sticks to the back of the tongue. Despite the clear evidence of its strength in both aroma and flavor, this beer is wicked good and complex. One of my top winter brews."
"We both loved the taste, which is really more like a wonderfully sweet and complex liquor. There's a lot of dark fruit, something sour like cranberries, some oak and smokey character, a lot of dark sweet malts, and a lot of alcohol character, making for something like a brandy barleywine. The mouthfeel is impressively light for the complexity and this becomes a hell of a sipper--the glass disappeared much quicker than we were expecting!"
"WooooOooooh, this is a sweet beer. More pucker factor than most any beer I have had in a loong time. Tastes of alcohol heat and sweet, candied malts. Thank goodness for the barrel aging, to give this a little earthy balance. Coats the cheeks with what I would call a medium alcohol residue. No drinkability. This is a dessert beer to be sipped to enjoy."
"D - ABV aside, this is a very drinkable but heavy beer. The sticky sweet flavour really ruins it for me though."
"Drinkability & Final Thoughts: This beer is very complex (it took me minutes of slowly smelling, sipping, and thinking before I began writing descriptors for the review) but it is also very drinkable. The complexity of the aroma and flavors hide the high-ABV, almost too well! I split this bottle with a friend but could have easily drunk a whole one alone -- and most certainly been drunk soon thereafter! A classy, seasonal beer which fits the cold winter months and holiday spirit perfectly; I will definitely be visiting this beer again next Christmastime. I know there are 2007 vintages available in my area, so I'd love to try one of those to see how it developed."
"This is a very different kind of beer, It is very sweet, but very robust at the same time. A sweet honey taste very smooth slightly creamy, its does very well in masking the fact that it's 14%. The color is a Dark Amber very nice to sit back and enjoy."
"This is a sipper. Low carbonation and almost syrupy thick but extremely smooth. Any alcohol has gone away with time. The sweetness is a bit intrusive for me, this is almost like liquid candy. Ultimately an every once in a while beer. It's just so sweet and heavy that 12oz is probably about all one could handle."
"a drink for those who dig sweet malt lagers/liquor! not for me."
"D: This is a great beer for sipping, just sitting around relaxing'"
"Amazingly good drinkability for such a big beer. Splitting a 12oz bottle three ways helps. I'm a bit blown away by the smoothness of this after four years, the lack of booze, and depth of flavor."
"I took a chance on this despite the impression that this was probably just hooch. I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful sweetness (of which I'm a sucker for). It's really not terribly complex despite my description as I see it all those flavors are interrelated. The mouthfeel and coating as well as the big warming is a bit distracting. However, it is surprisingly an easy beer to drink and if I am to drink malt liquor, this would be it."
"D: I was very pleasantly surprised by this. I am not a very big Samichlaus fan when it's fresh, but it appears aging the beer about 15 years is a good idea..."
"My doppelbock bar has just been raised."
"D: this is not something I could see myself drinking again. I had enough trouble just sharing one bottle of it. It is far too sweet. I've had beers of this abv that are much better balanced. This could use some refinement."
"Big thanks to womencantsail for sharing this one at the Bruery RS Post-Post-Party. 1996 Vintage!!! Served from bottle into a Bruery sampler imperial pint. Poured dark brown with a very very minimal off-white head that subside to no head at all upon sitting for a bit. There was no lacing evident throughout on this one. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and slight alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, and peanuts. It had a light feel on the palate with very low carbonation. Overall this one was decent but not great. This brew was pretty old to say the least. However, it seems like it has held up decently after all this time. Definitely grateful that I got to try this one."
"Pours a faint caramel color with a few bubbles here and there, but not too much of anything going on. Pretty color, though, I suppose. A few legs on one side of the glass. The nose is pretty strong with a really nice amount of super-sweet malt, caramel, and dark fruits. The taste is more toward the sweet end of the spectrum and adds in a bit of light alcohol, though not too much. Feel is nice with the sweetness and alcohol combining well. Not cloying. Really tasty and a nice sipper. Glad my first taste of this brew was a vintage version and not something fresh, which I've heard can be quite hot."
"Had this on tap at Burp Castle in New York City. This was banned in Ontario because the picture looks too like much Santa Claus, so we wouldn't want kids to want to buy this expensive beer, even they aren't allowed in the government liquor store in the first place. Ridiculous! Anyway, so the government made me want to try this. Pours a dark copper-brown colour with thin white head. Even though the head is thin, head remained for the whole time, leaving traces of lacing on the glass. It smells pretty much like a spicy barleywine, winter spices with a big caramel malt. Flavour is quite strong on alcohol, though the caramel sweetness is left as an aftertaste. Fairly big carbonation. I didn't realize this was 14% abv when I wrote the review in my phone, but it makes sense given how boozy it was."
"This beer is good for the first few sips...it is very sweet, making it not incredibly drinkable. It was an interesting beer to try, and one that will warm you up due to the high ABV. But the cherry sweetness is overwhelming, making the beer hard to enjoy."
"Drinkability is high under the right circumstances, I would like to try this with food since I think that would make it even better."
"D - The ABV says no but heck the taste says yes. This is a hell of a good drink on a cold night. Warms your insides like a fire."
"Pours a copper color with no visible head. Looks almost brown. This is a 2008 vintage. The large amount of alcohol contributes to the lack of head. No visible carbonation. Tastes very similiar to brown shugga. Cloying sweetness and mollasses and brown sugar. No hop bitterness but generous malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is very light for the abv and the drinkability is very high for its strength."
"D: Flavorful and smooth. Daunting ABV limits drinkability a bit."
"First taste impression on the tongue is ""sweet"". Not ""sweet!", but ""sugary"". But immediately afterward the complexities arrive. So many it's hard to know where to begin. So hard that I won't, and I'll simply say that this beer is top 10 in the world. Give yourself a Christmas present and try it."
"Bottled in 2008; consumed on December 26, 2010.This is, by far, the highest ABV beer I've ever had. In my cellar, is another bottle from 2003."
"Drinkability: A definite sipper. Another fine example of a sherry type beer. After having Christmas dinner I chose this as my Christmas desert beer. Served @ cellar temperature to unleash the flavors, I'm not disappointed. Merry Christmas!!"
"drinkability - This is a great beverage to celebrate special occasions, ABV makes this a sipper for sure, price makes it not feasible to drink often but this is a really good beer that I will revisit in the future"
"It's probably for the better that Samichlaus is brewed only one day a year. That, and the fact that it's brewed in a castle and virtually everything else about the beer, is entirely enchanting. It is indeed a special beer for a special time of year. And, like St. Nikolaus himself, it's sure to have you saying: ""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"""
"Cheers!"
"D: Great beer! As advertised, does age well, and presents the flavors one would expect. Have had fresh and this beer is too much fresh, but if allowed to sit, you get to enjoy the fruits of the wait."
"Clear, dark copper/red, almost brown, very small head and no lacing. Sharp alcohol smell accompanies sweet syrupy malts over a dark fruit base. Alcohol is a little less dominant in the taste, which features the sweet dark fruits and Caramel malt and toffee. Texture is amazing - creamy smooth, even with all that alcohol, thick, rich and chewy. Sweet finish without being cloying, and oh yeah, the slight alcohol burn. This was a 2009, I will let my other one sit at least a year."
"It was evident as the tasting went slowly on that I was drinking something very special. The flavors and aroma were intensified by the high alcohol content. This libation was not brewed to slake one's thirst on a hot summer day or wash down a spicy meal, but is a worthy showcase for the art of a brewery that has been around for over 400 years. At 1 U.S. Dollar an ounce I did not at all mind taking my time with this unique creation."
"D: Moderately drinkable. Very tasty, but not worthy of an entire drinking session."
"This annual holiday brew can be a nice after-dinner aperitif, with some warm plum pudding or berry-stuffed cinnamon baked apples dressed in ginger cream."
"D: Very drinkable. Don't even notice the alcohol."
"This was one of the first craft beers i ever had the pleasure of trying. Luckily for me it was an aged draft and it was great enough then to get me started down the path to craft beer."
"I love this stuff and am sorry that I came home from my beer buying trek with only one of these."
"D: Best in small quantities. Half a bottle is more than enough. Two or three ounces would have been sufficient."
"This beer pours a copper color with little to no head to speak of, but at this ABV it's understandable. The smell is strong. There are lots of caramel notes perhaps some butterscotch thrown in with all of the booze fumes that are creeping up my nostrils. There is caramel and toffee in the flavor as well but mostly this is just a sugary butterscotch candy. Though due to the high powered booze that exists you could say there is a bit more scotch than butter. However it doesn't take away from the fact that this is a pretty good beer, it's really sugary for any style. And as for a doppelbock I'm not really sure if it qualifies in that realm either. But no matter the style please be sure to sip this beer, it's a doozie."
"as noted, i enjoyed this beer while shopping for 2 seasonals from terrapin brewery..."
"D - For a 14% beer this is dangerously drinkable. Very enjoyable. It's so rich and flavourful and yet has those refreshing lager characteristics."
"drinkability: A hesitate to give a 5 but this guy is just too smooth for such a monster."
"the aging has done this wonders. absolutely no trace of the huge 14% abv, and the flavors are meddled nicely."
"D - This is an obvious sipper at 14%, alcohol is rather present, nice and complex, worth trying."
"Drinkability suffers a bit from the boozy qualities, but it is VERY good overall. However, this was quite different in flavor from any doppelbock I've had before."
"This should have come in an 8-oz bottle, not a 750ml. I can't imagine anyone being able to finish this. It's like very very bad cough syrup."
"This is the 75cl ""Limited Edition"" bottled 2009. Pours with more fizz than I expected and is a clear burnished copper with very minimal head retention. The smell hits me before I'm anywhere near the glass, with a noticable alcohol whiff followed by cherries, caramel and fruit that makes my mouth water. The taste is intensely sweet and just gets sweeter towards the finish. Pronounced caramel and toffee tastes underpinned by a raisin-like taste that tries to dry things out a bit. It will take a lot more sun after a downpour like that. The finish is where the alcohol becomes VERY apparent, it is a bit warm going down. Mouthfeel is again more carbonated than I thought for such a huge beer, slick and syrupy all at once. It coats your tongue long after it has left your mouth. Drinkability is not bad but you have to expect to be so challenged by the sweetness and the ABV that you just can't really call this very ""drinkable"". But good? Great, even? Oh yes, you can call it that!"
"This is a very sweet and sticky dopplebock upon first sip, but it mellows out nicely, and while the 14% ABV is noticeable, if you just sip it on a quiet winter's night, it's smooth and warming all over. A good beer to share, but if curiosity gets the better of you (like it does me), give it a shot, but enjoy it slowly."
"Definitely now one of my faves in the category. I'll be coming back to this. Love the taste. Only thing preventing more than one is the high ABV."
"Cheers!"
"D: In a 2 oz. sample, this would be interesting. At 11.2, this is way too much for a single sitting."
"D - For a beer at 14% abv this stuff is way to drinkable the taste is damn good this is a beer that every ba should try sometime"
"D- 14% is well hidden. This is definitely a sipping beer. It gets better and better as it warms up. Highly recommended. The alcohol taste brings this down one notch from perfect."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle and split. Very thick reddish brown with little head. Smells a bit like cherry with alcohol notes. The scent itself is intoxicating. Tastes is very woody and boozy with this slight tartness in the background. It is a bit hard to get down at first but as this beer warms up, you warm up and end up enjoying this a lot but it is still a tough beast to break."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. The 14% can be felt, but not tasted. Samichlaus is *very* sweet, which may detract for some, but not me. HIGHLY recommended. My friend commented, ""Wow. This tastes like it would make in-laws tolerable."""
"D: Medium. Quite sweet and strong beer. To be appreciated with moderation"
"Overall, I don't have much experience with this style, but this is nothing like other examples of the style I have had. To me this drank more like an English Barleywine. Still its very interesting and a good beer."
"Drinkability is tough to gauge here. At 14%, you have to sip this one, and you really should. I drank this glass over the course of 2 hours. Sip sip sip. It was the best route, and I didn't get kicked in the head by the ABV. I also got the most out of the flavor of the brew. If you are in the mood to do some tastings, this is not a brew to combine with others. Well worth trying."
"D: This is too sweet and boozy. It is definitely a sipper and only that if it's cold."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel, medium-low carbonation. pretty drinkable considering the staggering ABV (i just had to spell and respell ""considering"" several times), however with its sweetness this can't be considered too drinkable a beer, IMO. recommended, especially to malt lovers."
"All in all the final score doesn't do justice to this beer - the flavor is so complex that it more than makes up for the deficiencies in the other categories. Expensive but well worth the money for me."
"This is a big and bold beer, obviously, with its massive alcohol level. Here I think the alcohol works well with the sweet wichness of the brew, but the experience is along the lines of port wine. I good beer to sip and nibble chocolates with."
"D: high quality beer, but the aftertaste is not my thing. it is very easy to get drunk on this, so be careful!"
"Bottled in 2008. So according to the bottle it would have been brewed in Dec. 6, 2007. This beer ages 10 months before being bottled. Poured into a mini snifter. Dark burgandy color with little whispy head that quickly disappears. Some scents of candied malts and aged fruits. The bottle says its a malt liquor, but it smells a lot like a barleywine ale. Mouthfeel is smooth, not heavy. Mostly tastes of sweet malts. No real hop profile. Alcohol is certainly warming as I drink it down. I gonna sip on this one for a while. Outstanding overall. I am pairing this nicely with some fresh pairs and aged provolone cheese."
"4.5 D: This is a sipper, but it isn't a bad one. Though the appearance and nose aren't that impressive, the taste is solid. I imagine this would be even better with some more age on it."
"DB- Reminds me of JW Lees vintages but at the same time has a unique flavor. I guess the old German flavors lend a rum, almost olive like aspect, even oily. Very interesting, wouldn't mind letting a four pack age for... ever?"
"Medium to low carbonation with an oily feel on the tongue. A very well crafted Doppelbock."
"Verdict: A truly extraordinary Christmas beer, and definitely a beer to try for an enthusiast. Samichlaus takes the ideas of a conventional beer and turns it into a very unique and distinctive beverage."
"Drink = For such an ostensibly heavy beer it has incredible drink ability. It is hardy yet some how not filling, but maybe that's because it is 14% alcohol so you don't need many before it is time to call it a night."
"M - Syrupy, mild carbonation."
"Probably one of the best examples of a true doppelbock from the Southeastern Alps."
"D- I'd be great having one every night in the winter"
"Overall, an interesting beer. The alcohol is apparent but surprisingly not overwhelming for me. It is a bit too cloyingly sweet for me. Would make for a good after dinner sipper. Thanks Solan!"
"I would take Mr. Jackson's professional advice and enjoy it with flourless chocolate cake, heavy chocolate mouse, or any other dense chocolate dessert. Beyond that, have it alone, somewhere comfortable, with friends, without distractions, and when you have plenty of time to enjoy it. This beer is worth the effort - consider the effort but into it. It will really only continue to improve with age, so don't be shy about storing several bottles, just be sure they are in a cool dark place. I see no end in sight for this remarkable beer, besides my stomach."
"MF is buttery and a little bit syrupy, with a slight dryness in the finish. It's a sipper of epic proportions... Tons of very obvious alcohol, this is a beer to be enjoyed at length!"
"The appearance was a great, thick looking dark brown. It almost seemed to pour like it was caramel. The taste fit in with the caramel description. It was thick, malty, and delicous. I am glad there aren't too many 7 year old ""Sammies"" around, or this would be a dangerous beer. I was dreading the end of the glass!"
"D: Gorgeous to sip on, but difficult to finish more than half the bottle. This beer is to be enjoyed like a fine scotch: sipped slowly to enjoy the complexities. It is bursting with taste, and absolutely fantastic to drink."
"I've had plenty of good barley wines and stock ales, and this one is a fantastic example of both. It's called a doppelbock but it tastes more like a barley wine or a stock ale than anything. At 14% this is a very warm beer. It has a nice buttery toffee aftertaste. This bottle is from 2009 but I know this would be an amazing beer to age."
"D: Love to drink this again, but boy is it a sipper."
"I'd say that this is by far the strongest/most intense beer I've had to date and I wasn't disappointed. If you can get it, try it... but be prepared."
"F: Still very sweet. The syrupy feel leaves a big thick layer that tickles the tongue as it slowly drips off. Some lingering sugar and syrupy sweetness, slight bitterness with that too. Lingering fruits and nuts, as well as the booze. A super heavy and rich beer, slow sipper. Great for sitting by a fire in the winter, which I'm dreaming of doing now in this blazing heat outside."
"The drinkability of this beer is not good. It tastes nothing like a doppelbock. It syrupy sweet with low carbonation which makes this a real sipper. It's is also not very complex. All you need is 2 ounces to know what this beer is all about. The alcohol is really hot which doesn't help either. I know this beer is probably too fresh but, if that's the case then don't put it on the shelf. Maybe if you put this in the cellar for 3 to 5 years, it might be somewhat drinkable. On the label it says, ""The World's Most Extraordinary Beverage"". I think not."
"I couldn't give it away after several people tried it, and ended up tossing it out."
"Pours a rich slightly ruby brown color that would look great as stain on hardwood floors. No head at all, just a few bubbles that line the edge of the glass. The aroma is fruity and malty sweet. Caramel, brown sugar, molasses and cherry. Also, a slight spiciness. The flavor is amazingly sweet. Sweet malt is the main flavor, but it also has caramel, molasses, cherry and plum. Unlike other beers of this strength, this does not seem to have anything to cover up the unadulterated sweetness that comes with a beer of this ABV. Speaking of which, the only thing that really helps cut all that sweetness is the considerable alcoholic warmth. The mouthfeel , surprisingly, is what I would classify as the heavier side of medium, far from syrupy and full. It also has a fairly pleasant finish and drinks much more like a spirit than a high octane beer. That being said it is not very drinkable. Definitely a sipper, but not one I would like to savor. This beer is loved by many I know, and far be it from me to stop their enjoyment. For me though, this is very overrated and hardly drinkable."
"D: The noticeable alcohol makes this one a sipper. A few more years in the bottle would probably help. Still, pretty good overall. I can easily finish the one I've opened."
"Deep amber with a short lived pearl white head. Perfectly clear. Huge dose of caramel malts. Sweet, spicy, alcoholic, rum and raisins. Hint of cocoa? Yes, I dig this very much so. A chewy and rich body that clings to the glass and the palate. Warm finish."
"Drinkability: A nice sipper, and seemingly, a worthy adversary."
"Drinkability is what it is due to high abv."
"A 25.4 floz bottle is a force to reckon with - a worthy foe, to say the least. Samichlaus is not quite as tasty, exciting, or interesting as I expected from its reputation, but it is a hell of a beer that is very enjoyable. I'm glad I bought an extra bottle. :-) Tastes good. Feels good. Very good drinkability."
"This is a good beer, not great, but good, not much depth or complexity to the flavor; however, rich maltiness is ever-present."
"This is a great brew, I look forward to more dopplebocks. This is a serious style, almost a bit much on the alcohol. This would be a great beer to pair with a desert, after a really good meal. I think I will put a handfull of these into my cellar for a few years."
"O: This is truly a unique beer. The closest beer I've tasted to coca cola. Very sweet, a dessert beer. But remarkably drinkable for something so potent. This thing will age like a champ."
"	The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, but ultimately thinning and mouth coating, as is to be expected with a beer this high in alcohol. Dominant flavors are orange peel, mature brandy, figs, plums, and pecans. I hadn't come back to this one for awhile, because it is so easy to get, but it really is a fantastic beer."
"Very low carbonation, rich velvety body. Fitting. Alcohol heat is noticeable when breathing out. Mmmm dragons..."
"I got this at a Whole Foods in Middletown, NJ. This beer pours a mahogany brown with a somewhat small heart. The taste and smell is very boozy, with a mixture of plums, sugar, vanilla, too many flavour notes to count. Mouthfeel is nice, medium, and creamy, and this is a real sipper. A quality entry from Austria."
"Drinkability: Continuity is key in this beer, somewhat demanding but all the more rewarding. You won't have more than half a dozen on one night, but who needs it, so damn satisfying and holistic its sensory compartments that it is you'll be floored before by its fervour before you know it!"
"D: This is a beer that definitely needs to be sipped, but it's perfect for keeping warm on a winter evening and goes down rather easily."
"Notes: Vintage 2009. Very big boozy and sweet beer. I found the alcohol to be too strong a lot of the time. Similar to a digestif/liqueur type of drink. Sip it slow and enjoy. Definitely worth picking up a bottle to give it a try. I would like to try one after it has been in a cellar for a couple of years to see how the alcohol and flavors have melded/smoothed out. Not my favorite beer, but it definitely fills a niche."
"D: Great beer, but one bottle will be enough for a long sitting"
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a cola-ish brown with a very slight head that disappears into nothing in no time. Almost zero carbonation...the bubbles are few & far between. Aroma is sweet and syrupy. 1st sip is pancake syrup sweet with a noticeable undertone of alcohol that burns slightly on the way down. Mouthfeel is very light, almost watery & flat from the lack of carbonation. Overall, I have to rate this a disappointment. Cloyingly, sticky sweet with almost no hops or malt, and alcohol harshness. Hopefully, this will improve with age."
"D - Definitely not a frat boy chugging kind of beer, that's for sure! Makes a great winter warmer, seasonal beer. However I bought this in April and it is 65 degrees outside. So this wasn't the opportune time to be drinking this particular beer. Cellar this one and drink on the coldest winter day."
"Somehow managaes to be a little thin in the body. Overall an above average beer that I'm glad I tried."
"Three quarters of the way through, I could sure feel that 14.0% abv. This is definitely a sipping beer that was better once it warmed up to room temperature."
"I tried this beer before and i believe it was cold, it does much better warm, but it still isnt very good. better than average but not amazing."
"This beer is brewed once a year on December 6th for St. Nicholas Day and at a whopping 14%, it is said that it is the strongest lager beer in the world according to the Guinness Book of Records. This beer smells like caramelized malts, honey, eggnog, dates, and a high alcohol nose. It tastes sweet more toffee than honey, with a hint of hops, raisins, plums and a hint of molasses. It definitely goes down dangerously smooth for 14%! Now, I have had this beer before, I even served it at my own Holiday Tastings because I like it so much. But to have it served out of a 3L? That's pretty amazing. Not to mention how much smoother it smelled and tasted."
"3.5/4/4/4.5/4"
"Pours a clear bright amber-brown with very little foamy head. There is a moderate amount of sudsy, transitory lacing. The nose is unsurprisingly heavy on the dark malts, with bits of figs, brown sugar, molasses, and plums. A slight hint of booziness is also present. The taste emphasizes the brown sugar and molasses, with the figs and malts pushed back a bit, and toffee and maple syrup beginning to come through. Again, a hint of alcoholic burn is present, but not as powerful as one would expect from such a high ABV. The body is pretty hefty, with light carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Still, though, it covers the tongue very thickly, but not obtrusively, leaving a very satisfied drinker behind. Despite the ABV, this brew's drinkability stands very high, albeit more appropriate for sipping than everyday drinking."
"ok. but i'm only putting this here because they won't let me review it as from the brewery in switzerland. 1996 bottle generously offered for sharing at woodshop. pours thick and chunky, dark red, an appearance only fans of bret easton ellis could get off on. this is what i want. caramel and malty sweetness, oxidative stress pushing rich flavors, raisins. sticks in the mouth, yeast flakes between my teeth. i will never floss them out. the last thing i really needed was a reason to hold onto bottles for 15 years before opening them, but this...this is a gateway to the dark side."
"As drinkable as a beer that is meant to be sipped should be. I've got a 750 ML bottle of this one, and after having this 12 oz. serving, I know I'll have to share it."
"This beer is dark red-brown, with no real head. It smells like dark fruit, brown sugar, and alcohol. It is strong and sweet, with flavors of burnt sugar, toast, raisins, iron, and alcohol. The aftertaste is boozy, sweet, herbal, and slightly bitter. For such a strong beer, it's drinkable."
"Limited notes. Smells of figs, prunes, chocolate earthy. Appearance is dark brown. Taste is superb. Same as smells but with sweet molasses and just great balance. The oxidation/port effects of aging just work wonders on this beer. A little booziness in the finish, and med. mouthfeel."
"Score:4.696"
"I may buy it again simply with the intent of aging it for 5+ years, but this thing is way too cloying and hot to drink fresh."
"drinkability: mixed. it's so surprising that it's a wonderful beer to try and to experience. but the sugars and alcohol are so dominant that it would be hard to drink more than one. it's a bit like an overly sweet brandy, and probably should be enjoyed in a similar way."
"D: This is so strong that I seriously doubt you will be having more than one. I didn't enjoy the last few sips of this beer simply because it's so strong and it wears you down after a while."
"D- my first Sami from eggenberg, also my youngest, still quite hot at a year, but surprisingly quite complex and drinkable for summin' 14% ABV, overall a great nostalgic beer for me, can't wait to put some age on these"
"Just an incredible treat to savour and enjoy. I must say this old standby is far more preferred to more acclaimed Thomas Hardy, as well as the extra strong lagers that are on the lighter side. This is a damn near perfect execution, which is no small feat considering the size of this beast. Yum!"
"I have a magic closet with no doubt, this is the fourth good beer I've managed to hide from myself only to find at a later date. this is a decent beer and its unique so you should give it a go if you get the chance"
"Overall - a complex beer that is a must-try because of its fame and significance... but don't crack open the freshest batch, or you may be underwhelmed. Still interesting and complex, but not up to its potential in my opinion."
"D- It took a lot from me to try and choke this beer down. The sweetness got to me after about the third sip. I have 3 more sitting in the cellar that looks like they will be aging a little while longer."
"D: high abv but a great sipper to share with your mates"
"Taste: Slightly toasted caramel and a little brown sugar blended with plum wine that has a slight fruit juice character. Turns into an interesting play between earthy spices and aged, dark sourness and a little mineral though everything rides over a rich brown sugar note. For me its not anywhere near too sweet. A hint of alcohol is noticeable. Finish is sweet, juicy, nutmeg, mineral, and dries out a bit after a moment."
"I'm probably going to revisit this one when its aged and hopefully mellowed out some... As it is, its just too boozy and I couldn't get past it... Usually doesnt bother me in these high ABV brews but this one was rough..."
"Surprisingly the booze isn't too strong for being 14%. It's very sweet, but still drinkable. A Bit bitter, but not much for hops here. Interesting beer, worth giving a shot."
"D: In small doses, I think this would be great. However, I highly reccomend trying this with something salted, some meat, or some cheese. I believe when paired with any of those offerings, the overpowering sweetness of this beer would match perfectly. Tried by itself, I cannot get past the richness of the flavor, it's almost like a dessert that is too rich. This review is a reflection of my experience tonight, perhaps I will try it again when pairing it with the food mentioned above."
"Prior to January of this year, I'm sorry to say I wasn't familiar with this beer. I was lucky enough to get this as an anniversary gift from my wife (part of a beer gift basket), I've enjoyed it immensely. HIGHLY recommended."
"I´m storing away the rest of this four-pack. Here´s hoping that a few years will mature this brew taking it a bit closer to the reputation that it gained over its history."
"Overall: I like it but not as much as i used to. Still, it's a good beer and i'll still try it from time to time."
"D: I love this beer. To me it's like drinking a fizzy port with more sweetness on the back of the palate. A definite sipper. I have managed to down 3 in one sitting but at 14% ABV, as well as being pricey, it is definitely not a session beer. Will cellar well too if you have the patience!"
"D: 5.0 - Incredible - such complexity. It is simply amazing as to what some age has done for this beer. My understanding is that the recipe is still the same, but 14 years has made this an exquisite and one of the most memorable beers I've ever tried."
"This is a clear sit-and-enjoy-before-the-fire-beer, and let it last for a long time."
"D: For 14%, this beer is an easy sipper. I'd worry about cloying if I had too many, but I don't see anything wrong with this beer."
"D: For what it is, it is pretty drinkable. i don't taste the 14% that the label suggests. It's obviously a sipper. GET IT!"
"Clear dark ruby with a slight creamy skim of cream colored foam. The nose is big and alcoholic with buttered rum, dark fruit and oaky vanilla bean. The flavor is very rich and vinuous tasting with notes of spiced rum and prune juice that grow more complex as it warms up a bit. Thick and syrupy bodied with subtle carbonation that adds to the drinkability. I'd bet a year or so in the cellar would do this beer some good."
"Anyway, it's a very dark beer with a strong dark fruit malt flavor but still not strong enough to balance the alcohol or the sweetness."
"Mouthfeel - Very thick, full bodied with little carbonation."
"Realized I hadn't actually reviewed this yet, kind of surprised but I'm glad I still had a bottle of 2006 to open up instead of a newer release."
"D: I had the 2009 version, but I guess that the other bottles I bought and cellered will improve over the years. A very, very intersting and nice beer that probably will be greater for each year I'll manage to keep my hands off."
"Overall my friend and I agree that this was truly a great brew and I may track it down and buy it again if the price is reasonable (paid 6.00 for my bottle)"
"2006 vintage. Pours orangish-yellow with a white head. Very clear. The aroma is a mix of honey and brown sugar. The flavor is lots of honey with some alcohol. Very sweet. Lots of fruit in there as well. Medium mouthfeel."
"Really good atmosphere. Appearance is deep, dark, and pristine, but not overly exciting. Nose is outstanding. Great tones... great combination of elements. Flavor has outstanding balance of sweet and bitter. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"This is a very interesting beer. Very much a dessert beer just as one would consider a sherry or a port. It honestly feels like a real dessert in itself, like drinking a bottle of hershey's syrup."
"D-Not one to pound back to back, surely, but a brew that deserves a place in my cellar. Well done."
"D-it has insane drinkability for a 14% beer. It's almost cordial-like in it's body and a great beer for cold, winter nights."
"D- I could very easily mistake this for an 8 or 9% beer. Definitely a beer that would help me get through a Christmas with my highly dysfunctional family."
"I know Samichlaus is a doppelbock, but it has many similarities to old ale, or better barleywines. I'm not complaining, that makes it one of the best doppels I've had."
"Drinkability: I'll get it again. A nice Christmas sipper. Pretty damn good really. Not an everyday beer."
"Due to the alcohol content, I found the sweetness in this beer to be overpowering. The color and feel of this beer were outstanding. I would say the 12oz bottle should be shared between 2-3 people. I tried to enjoy this as a pint and was overwhelmed."
"Poured in a goblet, the beer was a chesnut color with virtually no head. The aroma was fruity caramel and whiskey. The taste was of caramel and some kind of dark fruit. The whiskey taste was there, but muted. I thought this was a fairly mellow beer, not hot. The alcohol is there, though, so be careful with this one."
"D - liked the bomber because its hard to split the regular size bottles, each year this beer continues to be one of my favorite winter warmers"
"HOHOHO!"
"Merry Christmas BA - enjoy this winter winner."
"Poured this beer in a goblet. smell was very sweet! as the taste was sweet. stronger alcohol taste at the end.(14%abv) It shows a dark brown in the glass, the head was gone almost immediately with minimal lacing. The taste was good, sweet, alcohol, strong. like the review belowe me ""full bodied, low carbonation, syrupy with a heavy sweet character"" brown sugar taste almost. overall very good beer. the drink ability I would score more but being so strong and powerful taste its more of a slow sipping beer. overall good."
"Drinkability: a real sipper. really sweet, so has a good place as an after meal dessert."
"Overall, this is a very rich and complex brew, as you would expect from a good doppelbock. This is probably one of the better tasting brews I've had in awhile and I would say that this brew is close to falling under the category of exceptional. Definitely a nice wintertime beer, as well. It's not the most extraordinary liquid that I've ever imbibed, but this is one is definitely worth picking up."
"D: Anyone who says the Samichlaus is drinkable is either immortal or is a liar. It is a tasty treat of which one is plenty."
"This is not a beer that pairs easily with food. I might recommend some cheese or nuts - but definitely not a food-friendly option."
"D-A delicious beer. I will save the rest for after dinner. This is a real sipper that will kick your ass and deprive you of its qualities if you rush it."
"This is a fantastic beer and one that has aged unbelievably well. There are only the faintest hints of oxidation and they have actually added to the complexity. Though the alcohol is evident, it's very drinkable for a 14%ABV beer. Wonderful stuff."
"33 cL, olive-green bottle, 2006 vintage (brewed 12/6/05); sampled December '08. The beer pours a chill-hazed, beautiful deep amber color, with slowly rising carbonation and a short-lived, fizzy head. Smells of caramel, fruits, rum bread, maraschino cherry and just a breath of alcohol. The flavor is very densely packed with fruits and heavy caramelization, chocolate-covered cherries, rum bread, floral/perfumy alcohol, hints of spices (cinnamon?), a touch of roast malt, perhaps some floral hops and a mild bitterness that slowly increases. There is also a boatload of residual sweetness, but it somehow manages to steer clear of becoming cloying - well done. The body is thick, smooth and a little dry, with an aftertaste that lingers forever. Pretty low on the drinkability meter, but the sippability score would be quite high. At first I thought this was too sweet, but it really needs the sweetness to balance the strong malt flavors and high alcohol. This is a big, meaty, delicious and layered lager that makes for the perfect nightcap and it helps to ward off the chill of New England winter nights."
"Happy Birthday Dad!"
"-hard to drink, but good flavor"
"Great stuff, had been staring at this in the store for a while now and glad I finally grabbed a 4 pack."
"I enjoy the ledgend or history of this beer and wished I had had a nice fire to sit in front of as I sipped this beer."
"- Overall this is a very interesting brew.... and very strong. Like a way-strong ale. Warming, and not too difficult to drink. Overall kinda cool."
"This beer poured with a generous head despite the age on it. I read other reviews saying they got no head, maybe they used the wrong glass. I used a stella snifter. Nose was big time fruit, almonds and booze. Big ripe cherry aroma with some mild spice notes and caramel malt character. The taste is nicely complex with pale and caramel malt backing, ripe red cherries, sweet oak chips, a huge nuttiness with an almond paste and cherry macadamias. Mouthfeel was syrupy, oily yet sufficiently carbonated. Somewhat of a sipper, very nice complexity to this brew. Booze was noticeable but that is expected and welcome in a 14% Doppelbock. I would hate to see anybody slam this beer or lower it's score because of the booziness."
"D - It's not a special day, I just saw it and said, ""I finally need to drink this one."" Maybe its the impending Christmas season, the cool air, or the fact I started getting the Christmas lights out, but I'm glad I'm having it. A bit boozy for my tastes but one hell of a dopplebock and a great winter warming sipper. Room temperature might be good for it too. Also, for it's age, the alcohol has probably mellowed. That would make this one boozy beer when it's fresh!"
"Drinkability: No question about it. This is a sipping beer to spend a long time with. Both with this ABV and complexity of the flavor, a small sip goes a long way. I can also see now why some people love this beer and some people hate it. But it is also clear that this is a beer to set aside until its 2nd or 3rd birthday before even thinking about tasting it. Also don't even look at buying this beer if you can't stand after dinner liqueurs."
"I still respect the beer and the legend. I think I definitely need to give it another shot. Maybe age the bottle and let its fiercity mellow down. I didn't like it first up but I want to have another shot at it. I am sure that my opinion will change."
"Not bad, but the alcohol is way to much. It is worth a try, and something that I would like to cellar for a few years to see what happens."
"Drinkability: One bottle, if that. I mean, it's 14%, be careful with this one. Definitely a sipper."
"The taste is has some similar elements but is much better, with some complexity, intriguing qualities, some good flavours, and a solid, warm, oily feel. However, it is still overly tasting of fermented fried grain products and really very, very sweet. It has old sherry, fermented grain and apple fritters, fruit, faint roasted grain element, and a hint of flowery bitterness. The alcohol is clearly evident and very srong, although it's not rough and it's a lot less alcoholic in character than a number of far weaker beers I've had. It has a full, warm, oily feel that is a little too much. It's fine to sip a little bit, but not something I'd be very interested in and the aroma is really quite odd."
"The flavors don't quite live up to the nose, opening very sweet and almost sugary with brown sugar, honey and a definite soy component. Surprisingly simple and thin, the mid palate has a little dark fruit character with plums and raisins. Finishing with a little alcoholic heat, this is really smooth. The finish has a touch of harshness that attacks the rear end of the roof of the palate, but otherwise, I have no complaints. Medium in body with a low carbonation, this is creamy and smooth. I'm a little disappointed by the lack of richness on the finish, but for the most part, I am very happy I got to try this."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I generally prefer but not bad I guess. This beer is the definition of a sipper and really doesn't float my boat, but it is impressive for what it is."
"D - The '06 brew is much better tasting and much easier to drink. The older version was too over the top, but '06 was a great, smooth, powerful beer."
"Cheers!"
"Even the bubbles seem scared, trapped against the glass. It might be better to take shots of. I'm sure I could offer this as shots to friends and they wouldn't even know better. This is not a Doppelbock. I don't care what anyone says. Try at your own discretion."
"This is just a fantastic beer. I don't recommend more than 2; itll put you on your ass. Even though, it's hard to say no..."
"I had previously believed that the taste of christmas was found in bottle of eggnog. I was right of course, but if the taste of christmas was to be found in a bottle of beer, it would have to be a bottle of SAMICHLAUS! I have drunk several of these on several occasions, and each time it has been a fantastic beer-trip. (Tip -When first opened, sniff the escaping fumes that are released, and you will be pleasantly surprised.) This truly is the Rolls Royce of beer. Once poured, it has an understated elegance with no head to speak of, but yet you have the feeling that something extraordinarily fine is in your hands! At the first sip, and maybe even the fifth, you will have started to appreciate the Samiclaus. This brew gets better as your glass gets emptier, as the deep flavors reveal themselves like the details in a fine rug. This brew, once consumed, will give you a buzz that is distinctly a ""Samichlaus"" buzz. Indeed, it could lead to a ""Samichlaus day."" Merry Christmas!"
"Brewed at Christmas and for good reason; this is a contemplative sipper that deserves time to warm up and express it's full flavors. I wish I had a endless glass of this stuff, I could sip it by a fire all day and night. This beer makes me happy to be alive."
"Taste: The flavors are somewhat simple but it's very rich and wonderful. I was surprised how much it tastes like a normal doppelbock given the ramped up ABV. A real sipper of a beer, for sure."
"Bottle from 2008, tasted 9/09. Pours very dark coper with a light tan head that disappears quickly without leaving any lacing behind. Strong sugary sweet malt aromas with a lot of fruitiness. Heady alcohol smell with some caramel. Taste is cloyingly sweet. Big malt with some pear-like esters. Strong, heavily warming alcohol. Syrupy body. No real complexity to this one, just sugar and alcohol. Not great to drink, or even sip."
"2006 vintage capped bottle poured into my standard tulip glass. Appears a dark amber-chestnut color with about two fingers of fluffy rust colored foam. Aromas and flavors consist of dark fruits such as cherries, plums, raisins, tons of sweet malt, chocolate, brown sugar nicely toasted grain. Approaching full bodied with ample carbonation. Smooth and a bit boozy. Quite drinkable if you are in the mood for a sipper."
"I have one left. I think I'll hold on to if for a few more years and try it again."
"If you're in the mood for a big beer among big beers, I'd recommend a Samichlaus. I've been told that this is quite the rarity, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to grab a few of these."
"O- Awesome bier to savor into the night. Very sweet. Hope to keep a few around for the winter holidays."
"D- Despite the fact that this is a ""big"" beer, I could drink several in one sitting."
"Low carbonation, very smooth. One of the better Doppelbocks I've had. Despite the 14% ABV, very easy to drink."
"Beer was like syrup, poured into the glass, dark dark dark, thick, almost no carbonation, so no head at all. Smell knocks you over, raisins, sweetness, malt malt malt...This is definetly a beer that i can just keep smelling for several minutes, completely content without taking a sip. Eventually I did take a sip and all the wonderfulness exploded in my mouth. This beer was smooth and warming (probably the 14% alcohol). The sweetness was not overwhelming and it went down smooth. Feeling no pain after that. The beer was served in a 0.2 L Sammichlaus glass. How awesome is that?"
"I can seem myself drinking this for Nikolaustag with some delicious Fruechtebrot"
"Drinkability: Amazingly drinkable; especially for a huge beer. I am interested to see how this develops as I put a few in the cellar."
"A lovely sipper, methinks it would soar with a nice cigar. As for the Santa Claus theme, as well-structured and tasty a strong beer this is, I don't know that ol' Saint Nick would do well to have one of these with the requisite cookies (leaving the milk for the kiddees in the morning), and not be cited for an SUI (Sleighing Under the Influence) - ideally save it for the easy chair and roaring fire.  I don't know what my problem is here, then, it being mid-summer and whatnot."
"11.2oz bottle, bottled in 2006. Poured a small tan head that did not last except for lace round the ring of the glass. Deep amber in color. Awesome complex malty aroma, with dark fruit notes of raisen, prune. Slight hint of alcohol (bottle says 14% by volume). Full bodied. Carbonation a little light to be expected given alcohol content. Flavor is dominated by sweet complet maltiness. Dark fruit (again the raisen and prune) and fruity esters. Clearly balanced on the malt side of the flavor scale, although it has enough hop bitterness to keep it from being sickly sweet. Alcohol prominent too, but it isn't hot, nor does it detract from the wonderful malty flavor. This is a substantial beer that has been well crafted."
"Overall I like this beer, and I wish I tried this in the winter time, vice late spring."
"This beer is absolutely wonderful. Drinkability gets a little bit knocked off due to the high ABV, but, of course, this is a beer meant to be enjoyed during the holidays. And when better than to let loose and celebrate a bit with a 14%? Haha. If you get the chance, I say don't let this one pass you by."
"One of my favorite beers other than the typical german beer. The foam when poured was bubbly, wheat in color and dissapated quickly, which wasn't anticipated, thought it would be a thick foam. Color was dark amber/mahogany with orange highlights and some apple red, even a sangria tones. Smell had a deep, full-bodied, nutty/barley wine aroma. Taste was deep, rich, fruity, wood highlights, carmel tones. Mouthfeel - deep, full-bodied and smooth. Drinkability - rich and complex. The type that needs to be savored sip by sip."
"Overall: strong stuff, I would drink again"
"On tap at 515 in Santa Cruz. Poured into a snifter. Deep amber with a fluffy and sticky beige head. Aromas of caramel, eggnog, raisins, other dried fruits, and alcohol. The taste is very sweet and borders on cloying unless you really take your time. Big honey and raisin notes with a very syrupy texture. Alcohol is obviously present but not distractingly harsh. Too thick and sweet for me."
"This beer obviously gets better with age and after only two years this particular vintage is already brilliant!"
"I think this is fantastic and dangerous. tasty, high alcohol, this is a sipper if I have ever had one. very well done. the aging must have mellowed the feel and flavor, but in a tasteful way."
"At $22 a four pack(!) it's something I won't have anytime soon again, but golly, it was interesting. Tyson liked it so much he gave me the money to buy another just for him!"
"Notes: Wow! This is one big beer. Very alcoholic with a nice dark fruit profile that tastes way too sweet for me, though. I can't help but think that this would be the perfect candidate for cellaring. As it is, it's interesting but too boozy sweet."
"Poured a brown color with very little to no head, but the smell was nice since it was spicy and malty. Very little carbonation with a very sweet molasses or caramel or syrup (or all) taste mixed with a hint of fruit. There is a lot of flavor in this beer, a very sweet malty flavor, and it was smooth. You can feel the punch of alcohol from the first sip. It went down like a cognac or brandy and was quite enjoyable. It was quite good and I will seek it out and hopefully enjoy it again."
"Nice copper color, little carbonation. Raisins, bready caramel goodness. Worth storing for a while."
"D - This is a beer to be savoured. Perfect for winter nights, either with chocolate or desserts, or by itself in small, moderate quantities. It is unique enough to be considered outstanding."
"2007 bottle. Pours nice amber brown color, cyrstal clear, small head is gone in a few seconds, no lacing, carbonation bubbles look minimal. Nice bready, caramel aroma, with a hint of dark fruit. Taste is very sweet, loads of caramel and burnt sugar, sugarcoated dark bread, a little bit of smokiness and bacon, hints of baked brown sugar apples in the background, plus a noticeable alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, very little carbonation. Alcohol can be felt going all the way down. This is a very big, badass brew. I can see one bottle being enough for me as it's very hard to get past the alcohol and the sweetness is cloying at times. Pretty good and interesting dopple though."
"Drinkability suffers a little due to its massive 14% but this is a tasty, complex brew. I would definitely seek this one, especially in the winter (while waiting for Santa?) or even to age. Delicious."
"2008, poured into 10oz goblet. Poured a pale mahogany color with had a small white head that quickly dissipated, leaving a slight amount of lacing. A sweet initial aroma with a noticeable alcohol scent and a vague hint of spicieness. The first flavor is a honeyish sweetness that quickly gives way to an alcohol taste. After that quick burn a lovely earthy malt flavor lingers on the tongue for a few moments. Nice solid body that is neither sticky nor thin. Very drinkable from the flavor and body aspects, care is warranted from the alcohol aspect. A wonderfully lovely beer, truly a world classic."
"D this is an amazing lager very drinkable in small quantities , the worlds strongest lager just maybe also the best lager ,savor it and enjoy.."
"D: Lush, heady, and strong, this is not a beer for pounding. A little bit goes a long way, plus you'll want to savor it. Best in easy doses."
"It is easy to sip your way through one of these, a very unique offering that feels like a treat."
"Mouthfeel is rich with some alcohol presence. Drinkability is good given that you know from the start this is a one-and-out beer. An enjoyable slow drinking treat for a winter evening."
"D: Moderate drinkability. It's so tasty that I really wanted to say a higher rating, but the 14% ABV is prohibitive."
"D - An excellent beer, but almost a replacement for a cordial. This is too flavorful and high in alcohol to have more than one, but is an excellent nightcap."
"This is a beer to be enjoyed on special occasions throughout the evening on a cold winter night."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this beer is flavorful and as drinkable as any beer you'll find with an ABV this high. It's a very good beer to drink for as long as you can handle the strength."
"4.5 M&4 D: the ever-so-fine fizziness makes a mellow mouthfeel due to long lagering as well as some maturation in the bottle, full-bodied yet tasting absolutely soothing; a reasonable amount of alc. lingers, and warming in the finish, like a shot of good quality cherry+plum liquor. In a sense it reminds me of several English barley wine I've tasted, and from that perspective this beer is unlike any other Doppelbock I've tried or am able to imagine."
"Pours a pretty clear, dark amber brown colored body, with an okay-sized head, creamy but quickly diminishing. Strong dark fruit aroma, dark grape, plum, fig. Not a very strong aroma, pretty weak. Sickly sweet, syrupy dark fruit taste. A little hot, with dark grape and fig tastes. Lightly carbonated. Very much a sipping beer. Very strong. Much aging will do this one better, very raw tasting. Much better as it warms up, mellows out more, less alcohol."
"Taste: Very warming and smooth. Ethanolic , malty, sweet, hints of vanilla and butterscotch."
"O. This is the perfect beer for aging. I had the 2011 version and it was aged one year. It will knock you on your ass, but it is an extremely complex and delightful beer."
"Drinkability -- This is a very strong beer. Even if there wasn't a ton of alcohol in it, it's heavy, thick, and sweet. These factors all limit drinkability considerably. A 12-ounce bottle of this stuff would be enough for all but the most seasoned drinkers; two bottles would result in bad decisions. I wonder, though, if the drinkability would improve with age, at least in terms of the weight and thickness of this brew. I think I'll cellar a few of these and find out."
"Pours a clear amber color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of strong malt, earthy malts, slight fruit aroma, and some yeast cleanliness. At this point if fits the Doppelbock style, quite nicely. Very bitter, and high alcohol is noticeable in the mouth feel. Smooth and crisp along with a slightly high carbonation level. Tastes of strong malt upfront with a general sweetness closely following. A slight hop flavor is present in the aftertaste along with a little fruitiness. The alcohol packs quite a punch, but the overall flavor is amazing. The sweetness, maltiness, and slight fruitiness is absolutely amazing! This beer is definitely worth a try."
"Fortunately, they gave me an extra bottle to take home and find out. :-)"
"great nightcap beer. in the future i will try to cellar a bottle or two and see what develops."
"Bottom line - This one will warm you up on a cold day but could really use some more age to mellow it out a little bit."
"This was a little bit of a let down, but pretty good. I won't be stocking up on these, but I can definitely see how this would improve substantially with age."
"A unique beer worth everyone giving a whirl, it lives up to the hype."
"drinkability:definately a sipping beer but not a great one, maybe this beer gets better with age but I wont be buying another one at $4.95 for a 11.5 oz bottle."
"*edit* - so i had the 2006 bottle last nite (2/25) can't say if it tasted any different from the 2007's i've had, so there."
"Warming and full mouthfeel, slightly syrapy, but the alcohol works to its advantage-this is one pleasant sipper. One 12 oz. bottle is perfect, a second bottle would be foolish, but fun."
"Pours a wonderful dark candy red. Smells of sugars and alcohol dominate. Taste follows suit- slightly boozy, but with the dark fruits I want from a beer like this. The fact this is a 14% beer is downright terrifying to me. Too much of this would kill me though. This is a beer I'm going to start hiding away every year."
"MF&D - for the bread in a cup beer that a doppelbock is supposed to be this is amazing. a syrup like mouth feel and a real wide and full body make this beer formidable. if there is a fault here I am too buzzed to notice. I think I shall go back to the store and buy up the rest of the bottles and let them age."
"Drinkability - This is the brandy of beers. Drink slow with sips, and enjoy your time with it because your not having another. Drinking one left me happily buzzed."
"Overall - A phenomenal beer... every bit as good as i had hoped... Highly recommended."
"ABV 14%, bottled 2008 and BB 08/2013, poured mahogany hued and clear into a Maredsous glass. Fleeting off white head reduced to a ring with very low carbonation. Smells of cherry brandy, malt, dried fruit but mostly of alcohol. Taste is all malt with a warm gut feel - ""malt liquor"" on the label proves dead accurate. Lingering alcohol / liquor punch, sweetness that overstays its welcome in my opinion, although I must remind myself that is in keeping with the style. The lack of bitterness makes me think this is hardly a beer ... oh, I'm so conflicted on this one. With the long life this capable of, I'm tempted to lay a half dozen of these down for five years and try it again, particularly if I find myself by a toasty fireplace in a comfy chalet in the dead cold of a freezing winter evening ... a must try but not one of my favourite beer styles."
"Rating this high on drinkability because it is excellent. The ABV is a bit discomforting but having 2-3 bottles over the course of a long cold night with a nice aged Gouda would be excellent."
"All in all this is a pleasant experience for such a strong beer. Hopefully I'll pick another one of these up and cellar it for a good while."
"Pours maple syrup brown and clear with little head. Smells very, very sweet. Tastes super sweet as well, with a little bitterness to the finish. Medium bodied and well carbonated, but syrupy. Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV. I like this one, but I guess I've got a sweet tooth!"
"D: Since the intense sweet character and high ABV, one of these is far enough."
"First attempt at immediate online reviewing. Procedure needs work."
"Pours a light copper, fairly see-through, with just a bit of head (goes away quickly) and no lacing; quite a bit of carbonation. Deep scent, very malty with obvious alcohol aromas, and a bit of caramal and a hint of spice. Deep taste, huge malts with a very noticable alcohol hit. Goes down a bit thick, pretty good except for the over-alcohol flavor."
"Bottle says 14% abv. This might just knock me out for the night... Deep ruby red, clear, with a smallish head - doesn't look particularly formidable. Aroma is rich fruitiness which pretty much obliterates anything else that might be here. First sip is very sweet, with a surprisingly well hidden alcohol. Lots of fruit with almost no carbonation and a syrupy body. Bitterness is extremely low, or perhaps more accurately balanced out by the intense sugary sweetness. Flavour is red berries and a hint of cherry and maybe some medium-dark sugars. Had enough balance to keep one bottle from being cloying, but the second may be undrinkable. Far too sweet to have as anything but a dessert/digestif. FWIW, it's quite a good big, sweet beer. OTOH, it's awfully big and sweet... Matches well with chocolate..."
"Overall, I really liked this beer. It drinks more like a liquor and was nice to have by my side to sip for over an hour."
"D: Certainly a unique experience that I won't soon forget. A good brew to visit once a year."
"This is my first review of a beer on BA. You can try this beer, but I advise you only try a single bottle and have other beers as backups. You aren't proving anything by drinking this thing."
"Drinkability: I can taste the alcohol and could not have more than one at a time due to the abv...This is a good dopplebock, but not my favorite in the style"
"Amazing in that I did not feel the 14% ABV. Balance was great and taste was more than above average."
"D: This is no wee brew lads. A sixer of these will knock ye on ye backs. But you can sip on one for over an hour and it just grows in flavor. So I'd say slow drinkable but very drinkable nonetheless."
"Easily one of my favorite beers."
"Drinkability- Very good beer, but take them one at a time.."
"I'll definitely be buying it again."
"D - This really could be a great beer, and from all accounts it used to be, but the alcohol comes in at the end, where I wish they would have put some smoky characteristics to hide it"
"Mouthfeel is light despite it's medium-heavy body. Crisp, silky smooth. Sticky on the palate, syrupy as well. Buttery in the mouth. Goes down extremely well despite it's ABV - very drinkable - but it needs to be sipped. Carbonation is somewhat light, but it's a perfect fit. It's amazing how many different flavors I found sipping a glass of this. Awesome. Truly an outstanding brew, a fantastic dopplebock."
"Drinkability - Drinkable, but only a little at a time. High enough alcohol content where it does not have you running back for a second. Heck I may store the other 3 I have from this vintage and see how they taste in the coming years."
"Overall - Noticeably different but nothing to rave about."
"2005 vintage, pours brown/ruby with excellent clarity, minimal head. Nose- white grapes, sweet malts and honey. Taste- nuts, dark fruits , honey. Thick mouthfeel, low carbonation. Very much a dessert type beverage. Drinkability is actually not bad given strength. Its sweet, but not sickly sweet."
"D- Tough to take a lot of this stuff, but enjoyable in small amounts. I can see how this beer could be a fun beer to drink every Christmas. I'll pick up a bottle and let it sit around for a while. I would have loved to have done a side by side taste test with the 93 bottle that I had over the summer."
"This one is an instant classic, and world-renowned for good reason."
"After a while the abv does pop you in the jaw but overall this is a fun beer to get once in a while."
"Overall - A powerful and sweet bock. It has a barely noticeable lagery base which is drowned by layers of caramel, candyfloss and alcohol. Very unbalanced and as a result, I could only have one at a time. That said - a powerful and sweet doppelbock with an interesting history and name!. Not for me, but I see why others take to it."
"Overall: This beer is drinkable, but just one per week or month. I think I will see if I can get another one and let is age a few years. I will say if this beer wasn't aged it could knock you on your ass. I was rather surprised and I think I will finish this off for myself"
"D: More than one? Probably not, but very drinkable once you take the vitals into consideration. Everyone should try this at least once."
"Overall: great beer. Im gonna buy this again, for sure. Lots of flavors, but somehow not extreme."
"The drinkability is good, but really one or two of these will do you in. If there is any beer that is NOT meant to be sessioned, it is this one."
"Overall this was sweeter than I remembered from last year. As far as I know this was this year's batch, so that may have had something to do with it. Worth a shot."
"D: This is a heavy beer that is absolutely a sipper. The ABV burn is quite high and does hurt at times. The beer is tasty and interesting, but I don't see myself having a larger pour or more than one in a sitting. Overall pretty good, but absolutely meant as a night cap or an after dinner drink. Not a pounder by any means."
"Look, I understand and appreciate the rareness of this beer but, I really feel the alcohol level is just too over the top. Perhaps as the years go on it might mellow. Glad I got to try it though."
"overall this is very strong and gets better as it warms up."
"Thanks Vierra!"
"Pours a very dark copper with a small white head. The nose is nice, sweet malts, alcohol, toffee, caramel, a tiny hint of Noble hops, and a ton sweetness. Comes across the palate with a lot of sweetness. Actually its a bit boozy up front, then you get hit with this ridiculous amount of malty sweetness. That does a fantastic job hiding the high abv; its very thick and full feeling. I would highly recommend trying this one at least once."
"D: surprisingly drinkable with such a high alcohol content...the sweetness counteracts it...strong alcohol would make it dangerous to drink too much."
"Amber colour, small head, creates a lid, no lacing. Smell is vinous, yeasty, malty with no apparent hops. Taste is very very sweet, honey, fruity, jam. Obviously alcohol is very noticeable but it is much less so than I expected from a beer whit such a high ABV. bubbles are medium and the liquid is very smooth. This beer is dangerously easy to drink almost makes you think that it needs to have a warning label.."
"Drinkablity: A classic. Boozy, but brilliant. Worth the trip."
"Well this one was definitely worth it and even better than I was hoping it would be. If you see this stuff I would highly recommend picking it up if you are into Doppelbocks."
"2006 bottle sampled, it seems to have held up pretty well; this beer is worth a try."
"Full-bodied and thick, almost milkshake thick; a definite sipper. Smooth, somewhat creamy, and bubblegum sweet while warming w/ a minor alcohol burn to coat a beer that is silky smooth. Caramel, honey, gum, dark fruits, raisin, grape or black cherry, seemed to be all tucked into this beer. Hops are very minor and completely overshadowed by the malts but are there. I couldn't session this as the ABV and the fullness of the beer hit me with one 8 oz. glass. Other than that ""complaint", this had to be one of, if not the, greatest beer I've had. Guess I'll wait another three years for it again."
"Ruby hues - semi-transparent. Minimal head with no lacing. Smell is sweet and malty. Nose is brown sugar. Smell really reminds me of a barleywine. Taste is quite sweet up front and rather cloying through the finish. As it warms some bitterness comes through to balance the end. The alcohol is very well hidden. Beer becomes way more drinkable as it is allowed to open up a bit. What really started out as being quite sweet, ends up being pretty complex with tastes of fig, some pear, brown sugar. Overall, definitely enjoyable and one that I should have tried much sooner."
"D- a little rough, the flavors are all over the place and the high abv would catch up with you if you had more than one..."
"D-Regardless of the 14% ABV this is one of the smoothest, most luscious, easy drinking, sipping beers I have ever had. I am sure that the 15 years of aging have done this brew nothing but good. A treat for the mind, body and spirit....Happy Samichlaus Day!"
"Not really living up to the sizable hype I had thought out for it but I'm not really giving up on this beer, it has something to offer and under the proper cellaring conditions could probably turn into something pretty interesting."
"2007 vintage, $6 from Vrai Amour wine shop in Chicago."
"Poured into a Belgian goblet at the Cock and Bull in Covington, Kentucky. Pours an amber color with no head, don't know if it's because of the beer or the glass was not beer ready. However, there was plenty of carbonation in the beer. A constant flow of bubbles was rising from the bottom of the glass. The nose was full of dark juicy fruit note that was followed by a aromas of spicy hops, then backed by spicy alcohol. The taste was delicious, all of the fruits in the nose and peppery alcohol. The mouth feel was thick and wonderful, great beer to warm yourself against Cincinnati's rainy, cold winters. This beer goes beyond the style of Doppelbock, maybe an eisbock, but the flavor reminds me of an English Barley Wine. Would pair wonderfully with Creme Brulee."
"The flavour intensity and alcohol content of this brew limit the drinkability."
"drinkability is decent. normally a high alcohol tag would mean that the brew is more complex and rich, but this one fails to be either. the alcohol works against the malts, creating an odd alcohol character and a malt profile that does not stand up to it."
"The mouthfeel is indescribable, big malty chewy goodness.I found this one at Summits Tavern in Snellville,Ga. Scores a perfect 5x5!!"
"This poured a clear dark mahogany with no head. It smelled strong and complex, like honey wheat, nutty malt, earthy barley, a bit of creamy orange, and alcohol. It tasted like rich caramel and granulated sugar, burnt barley, and nutty malt, with creamy orange and vanilla oak, and some alcohol. It was somewhat thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting bittersweet aftertaste with a bit of alcohol warming. Overall this is the best of the Eggenbergs. It is fantastically complex, with a clean and delicious flavor and great body. It had noticeable alcohol, which made it a better for sipping. But it's so rewarding to drink. Holding onto this long enough to age would be difficult, but possibly very worth it."
"Drinkability is ok but it really makes for a good nightcap as I'm finding out. After just a few sips, the warming comes over me and I'm ready for bed."
"Taste is super sweet and malty! Reminds me of fall and like a whiskey spiked cider. There is a nice bitterness and LOTS of warmth from the alcohol. Feel is sticky smooooth and syrupy. Well this is pretty cool and drinkable. More than one and your hammered."
"After looking at other reviews and more closely at my bottle, I should mention I have a ""bottled in 2006"" bottle."
"Overall this is an excellent brew that is a bit sweet for my tastes but it is nice to drink in the colder months as a nice winter warmer."
"This is really a different class of drink to most beers - it also deserves to be classed with fortified or dessert wines. Having said that, if you take it for what it is then it is a exceptional and well made beer. Fermenting such a monster can't be easy and the Eggenberg should be congratulated on producing such a unique beer."
"Both had a dark amber/brown body with no head. The 00 was super smooth...pure butter. The 01 has a slight alcohol bite, but only compared to the 00. The 07 was like rubbing alcohol in comparison to both. The 00 had raisins on the nose and was slightly old aleish. The 01 had some fruit and was more port wineish. Both aged well."
"Poured into a flute, this beautiful amber colored liquid produced a ring of a head. The smell of sweet fruit, malt, and brown sugar. The taste of sweet malt, banana, sourdough bread, and a spice component. Mouth feel is just right for the complex working of this brew. This is a very fine offering. I would love to have a case of this to cellar!"
"Well I had great memories of a bottle of the Swiss made one that was aged about 3 years. This review is for a new bottle of the Austrian version and alas the hotness and in your face sweetness dimmed the memory a bit. This beer is meant for the cellar as it is too boozy and sweet when young. You can tell this is a well made beer and full of flavour but it needs Father time to mellow the edges. Used to be one of the world's great strong beers but I think the beer world has evolved and this is a bit of a relic."
"Can't belive this beer gets a B+ rating on BA. I wasn't impressed a bit. Might as well just save your money and get a bottle of booze. I did manage to finish this one,but really would'nt want to do it again."
"2005 vintage. Pours with a thin head. Amberish in color. Smell is boozy and sweet. Taste is very similar & reminds me of a port or an aged Old Ale. Mouthfeel & drinkability are affected a bit by the alcohol burn even for a 2005 bottle. I have had this ""fresh"" & this is a beer meant for the cellar. A sipper but interesting."
"MF&D - A sipper, much like a port or a good whiskey. Not for the weak, but a must try for any true beer geek."
"The bottom line: buy a few Samichlaus each year to lay down for a while. Your patience and good taste will be rewarded."
"I recommend splitting a bottle with someone and pouring it into a wine glass or snifter, as there is limited head. Feel free to drink at any temp as I didn't notice much difference between cold and warm. I would like to see what some people that are not big ""beery"" drinkers have to say about this b/c it reminds me so much of apple cider and drinks like a wine. I enjoyed totally from first sip to end, but I did have to slow down and can feel the ABV after one beer."
"I should note that when I first began drinking this out of the fridge, I thought the flavor was a little one-dimensional (SWEET) and there was a nasty metallic twang, not dissimilar to a lot of lagers. As it has warmed up, the metallic edge is gone and the fruit flavors really shine; this review reflects what I thought of the beer just slightly under room temperature."
"This is a beer that I had to come around to; but, I am sold on it and will purchase whenever I see it (living in MS I don't see it that often) and the wallet will allow."
"11.2 oz. bottle, 2006. Pours an orange-amber color with an immediately dissipating head. Aroma is fairly complex, sweet malts, caramel, candi, and alcohol. Flavor is a kick in the ass. Very, very sweet malts, toffee, brown sugar, and ALCOHOL. Thick and creamy mouthfeel, but just WAY too much sweetness."
"Drinkability: With this review I become an Initiate and it's been a great, educational ride. I look forward to much more beer enjoyment... this one needs mellowing... look for the aged versions or tuck some away for a few years, but an interesting experience."
"Edit 2011- Had a 2007 vintage an tap at The Trion in New Haven, IN, and it had mellowed some.Still not very balanced ,but I upped my score a bit."
"D: Drinkable for 14.0 abv and very smooth going down, but your gonna feel it later. Very warming caramelized sweetness. Definitely a one and done beer that will warm the soul for the winter months."
"D- at 14% this is almost too drinkable. i was expecting something alot rougher because of some of the reviews here, and i liked this one alot. probably cant have more than one in a sitting but ill have this one again and i cant wait to see how time effects this!"
"Not sure how they get the beer up to 14%ABV but it has a similar taste and feel to an Eisbock. A decent beer but I would rather have a more typical Doppelbock."
"I think it's a bit unbalanced - too sweet with nothing to counter that - as it stands. Maybe I should try to get a bottle fresh from the brewery to see if there's more hop flavor or something in there. Anyway, pretty good. I'll probably seek it out again, too."
"It's so worth trying to track this one down."
"d: a very interesting beer that i know will get better with age in my cellar"
"Note : Bottle says this one was bottled in 06."
"Dark burgandy/amber with brown tones and a small frothy topping. Smell is of strong candied plumbs/figs to go with a root/wood type of malt smell. ALcholol warmth also prevalent. Wow this is a suberb sipper, brillaint alcohol warmth throughout with huge malt characteristics of the most nature kind, root, wood, earthyness. This goes great with the sweet candied plumb flavor that rides along with the alcohol. Mouth is a full bodied syrup texture that combined with the strength makes it alittle less drinkable than maby it could be, but who cares it tastes GREAT."
"Incredibly palateble for a beer, let alone a lager, of this abv%, but bigger isn't necessarily better in this case. It's impressive by its own merits, no doubt about that, but turns cloyingly sweet and intense by the time the glass is nearly empty, the charm tends to fade. Once a year, that sounds about right..."
"Drinkability: It's once of those once in a while sipping beer treats. I would love to age one to see if the age would calm down the alcohol. I know it won't calm down the sweetness of the beer. If you can your hands on a bottle it's worth a try, especially if you haven't had such a high ABV% beer before. A sweet and boozy beer!"
"Overall a really enjoyable beer, but quite heavy and maybe lacking a bit of subtelty."
"This is my first time tasting of Samichlaus, and I thought it was terrific. But I shared sips with friends and got varied reactions. Some of them were instant fans. Others enjoyed it, and thought it seemed like a port or brandy, but couldn't drink more than a couple sips. And one or two just didn't like it at all, finding it too strong."
"Somewhat bock-y in the maltiness, but mostly sweet, ripe, and strong. I like a darker, more liquid-bread-like Doppelbock, but I can appreciate this for what it is."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't drink this every night, but it's amazingly smooth for a beer of its strength, more like a good Old Ale than a dopplebock, and I recommend it highly."
"Smooth and light, but without a doubt a sipper. Kickass interesting now, and I wonder how well it'll cellar."
"Overall, this is a very complicated and interesting beer. It doesn't hide the 14% ABV very well, so this is definitely not a beer for most people... but it's worth a try for anyone who likes high ABV selections."
"Big bodied and warm. Great feel, but I wouldn't consider drinking another anytime soon. Great sipper for a not-as-warm-as-they-said-it-was-going-to-be late spring day."
"Great beer to throughly enjoy. Yes, it is a sipper but there really isn't anything wrong with that. Not a brew in which you would need more than one. Tremendously drinkable for what it is."
"Very heavy even for a dopplebock, this is definatly in a class of it's own. Not for the casual beer drinker."
"A - 4, S - 4, T - 4, M - 4, D - 4"
"This ""double goat"" is a kick in the teeth! People were flabbergasted when I told them this brew was a regular item for us at the Totalwine I used to work at. They said it was really was a really rare and great brew so I thought what the hell, I'll try it. Served it mildly chilled in a goblet. Poured a rich clear ruby color. Smell was strong of rum, spice, vanilla, and a bit of honey. The taste was viscous and unrelenting. The powerful 14% ABV warms the palate with molasses, sherry, vanilla, oak, and vanilla notes. A big brew but I can only handle oe at a time."
"D - packs a punch with the 14%. But actually drinkable"
"Overall, an immense disappointment. I was expecting dark, malty, fruity. This is no doppelbock."
"not the most drinkable beer i've ever had, but respectable in it's own right. this was a little young for drinking. a couple of years would lend some needed balance probably, cool it off and dry it out some too. well worth a try though, a very beefy barleywine-like beer."
"Pours a light clear copper and looks very iced tea like in the glass. Smell is very faintly boozy and big rich sweet caramel and a nutty character to it , which along with the sweetness, reminds me of pecan prailines. Taste is rich, potent and sweet caramel with a nice warming feel to it and no distracting boozy flavors. Rich, sweet, but not cloying and really nice for sipping! 4-5 years has done this beer really well. Thanks again, Chad."
"M/D: Medium bodied (lighter then I expected), pretty high carbonation and alcohol is there in a big time warming. Drinkability is low only because this one is so strong. A very good beer."
"D - This is a great after dinner sipper! Full bodied, warming, sweet, hearty, and boozy as hell. This is born to take the place of a cognac after dinner or with cigars! I could never drink more than one, and slow sipping is required here. A fine, fine brew!"
"Thick creamy body. A little syrupy but kept in balance by carbonation. This is very drinkable at over 6 years old."
"The only thing that stops this from being a super drinkable brew is the high ABV. Ouch after one I am feeling a good buzz. Time to switch to a lower abv beer like gonzo imperial porter or hopslam."
"This is not a beer for the faint of palate. Gooey, viscous alcohol notes slosh across the tongue and leave in their wake a syrupy-sweet, honey malt profile. This beer is almost too sweet, but balances the sugars ever so slightly with a kick of hops and booze. The mouthfeel is uber-thick, chewy, and warming; aftertaste is sweet and boozy. I'm not exactly sure how I feel about Samichlaus...one one hand, it's an exceptionally complex, well-crafted beer that probably deserves its own style. On the other hand, it's a mess of sugary-sweet booze and nearly undrinkable thickness. Although it's not a beer I'll ever forget having tasted, it's not a beer I'll be rushing out to buy again, either."
"2006 vintage. Red-orange color with very little head. Nose is a strong malty aroma. Taste is a delicious sweet malt, extremely easy drinking for a beer this strong. I'm amazed that they hide 14% ABV this well. Very smooth drinking, not overly carbonated. I'm very impressed with this rarely produced beer."
"Pours a golden copper color with a short off-white colored head that laces the glass some down the glass. The aroma is of very strong liquor and very sweet malts and some viney fruits and even a hint of apples. The taste is a very strong sweet malts some sweet viney fruits and some apple taste. The taste was very strong and if I had let it sit and age it would probably be a more mellow taste. The mouthfeel was kind of harsh and very sharp. It was not very drinkable because of its sharp mouthfeel and the very high alcohol content, but letting it sit and age for some time."
"That is what I thought about my first samichlaus. However, this one is a couple years old and has improved significantly. Pours a deep brown/red with ok white head that dissappears quickly. Nose is very caramely with sugar and raisin. Taste follows with very caramely sugary taste. Dark fruits and sugars abound. Great sugary taste. There is still much alcohol present though. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would like for the abv. drinkability is good, but I have had many beers in this range that are more drinkable. I think I will keep the rest of these in the cellar for at least another 3 or 4 years. Good beer. Unique."
"Drinkability is good, but limited due to the high alcohol content."
"drinkability is good. pretty good balance between the alcohol and the malty sweetness. still a bit on the warm side, making it more of a sipper."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a thin head. There's little carbonation and the aroma is sweet malt and alcohol. The flavor is syrupy sweet but not in a bad way at all. There's a dark fruit aspect to it as well. It is apparent that this is a high alcohol drink and meant to be sipped. The mouthfeel is slick and warming. I had tasted some 1995 and 1996 vintage Samichlaus recently and decided I really wanted to put some away for a few years. However, this drink is such an enjoyable nightcap that I'm not sure my stash will stay untouched."
"Pretty light body and even though it might taste good you won't be able to drink much at a time. Wether its the sweetness or the kick, it'll get to you."
"Sure, aging may work wonders for it, but what's the problem with making a beer that tastes great now?"
"D- I will be hard pressed to ever walk past this one, even in the heat of Summer."
"I love this beer! Wish I had this one back in december after a long day of christmas shopping but it did just fine on this snowy febuary evening. Appearence light brown in color nice head that disapeared quickly leaving just a hint of lace around the edges. Smell huge smack of malt hint of prunes. Taste cleen lager no yeasty fruitness, malt sweetness very little hop bitterness and the warming feel of alcohol in the end. Mouthfeel was thick almost chewy. Drinkability was good I could have this become a winter time favorite."
"D: Closer, as I mentioned, to a whisky than a beer. It's amazingly smooth, but so powerful. Even though half a glass is a treat, putting away more would be a chore."
"Pours a light reddish brown in color. No head at all. Smell is all alcoholic malt bomb! Taste is phenolic alchohol with again lots of malt to help support it along the journey. I can already tell this is made for aging. A little burn in the throat and nasal passage on the after sip. This beer was made for cellaring!"
"The appearance is the weakest aspect of this beer. While pleasant in color, it has very little head. The smell is remarkably mild. The taste is sweet like that of molasses with a kick of alcohol comparable to that of a liqueur. The beer is very full bodied and has enough of a kick to induce mild intoxication if the bottle is ingested too quickly. This is without a doubt intended as a desert beer."
"Crystal clear with a brilliant deep copper colour. There was a bit of foam off the pour, but it was very short-lived. A few fine bubbles formed a thin ring around the glass and produced a bit of spotty lace. The nose was bready and malty, ripe fruit, and alcohol that was more mellow than expected and smelled mildly of solvent (but it works). Alcohol was more prominent in the flavour, a bit solvent-like, and increased into the warm, lingering finish. Very sweet up front with brown sugar and ripe fruit notes, kind of giving the impression of rum. I could feel the warmth all the way down to my belly, but the alcohol never quite got to the point of being ""hot"". Full bodied and sticky, lowish carbonation. Definitely a sipper and quite good. I'd love to try one of these that's been aging longer."
"D: This is a sipping beer that took me quite a while to finish. Yet, I enjoyed every minute of it."
"A nice beer great sipper like I said I should have used a tulip would have made the experience more enjoyable. I will grab another one of these for next winter .This is definitely another must try beer"
"Bought this one at Four Winds International Market in Pensacola. I was headed for the register with a cart full of Belgiums when the man working the beer sections handed me a Samichlaus. Well, I've never heard of the beer but I figured what the hell. The bottle says ""bottled in 2006"" so for a beer of this stature still quite young. The beer entered the glass without much carbination with a small tan head forming atop the mahogany brew. Smell, prunes and port wine. Taste, defiantly dried fruit and alcohol and as it warms the alcohol warming becomes more pronounced. As far as mouthfeel goes it was a little on the syrupy side but, it seemed to balance out well because of the high ABV. Not an everyday beer for me but one well worth trying. I'd love to try one of these with a few years on it."
"I always considered Celebrator to be the model Doppelbock, and I can't even compare the two, this almost deserves its own category."
"Mouthfeel- very low carbonation delivers a slick boozy flavor. This is very close to a brandy. Sweet flavors, alcohol presence and the cherry aromas translate to flavors. A froth intensifies all the mentioned flavors into a sweet, sticky, high-proof beverage.I did not have any expectation but this was much sweeter than expected.Although it is very sweet and potent, a big full-mouthed swallow is needed to enjoy the aggressive side of this one. It is smooth but sweetly rich. I received mine directly from Austria in 2005 before the cap was popped in NC."
"D: Almost too easy to drink, though the flavours open up a bit more as it breathes, like a nice wine... so it's worth taking this one slowly for full appreciation."
"Just try it, it's worth it!"
"Reminds me alot of some English Barley wines like Thomas Hardy's, or even big Belgian's like Stille Nacht. Very cool beer. A sipper for sure. I might need to pick a couple up to age for a couple years and bring out during special occasions. I like it."
"I found this stuff very drinkable considering the 14% it's got on the label. Simply delicious, goes down very very smooth and an amazing flavor and feel to it!!"
"2005 bottle into a snifter. Pours clear reddish copper with a small head that recedes quickly. Sweet aroma with notes of vanilla and cherry. A strong grape juice aroma as well. Taste is very sweet. Some caramel and, again, grape. There is some noticable alcohol in the finish but not much considering the 14%. Mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy. The sweetness detracts a bit from the drinkability. I do like it but I was expecting more given the hype surrounding this beer."
"D: An excellent beer. Reminds me of a J.W. Lee's barleywine or Thomas Hardy."
"D: This is a tasty and powerful doppelbock, and while it's not one I'd drink everyday it's definitely worth having from time to time."
"I couldn't imagine giving less than a 5 in all categories. I'm very particular about my brews but I can't find fault with this one except that's it's particularly sweet. However, I'm a fan of sweet and malty brews so it doesn't bother me. It's just a notable feature."
"D = This was a really good brew and I look forward to trying it again -- next year. Not something I want too often, but definitely worth keeping in the repetoire."
"Overall, this was a must-try, but once a year is enough for me. I'll be happy to sample next year's batch during Xmas '08!"
"I have to brag about what I paid for this...6 bottles for under 12 euro....only a little over twice the price for a six pack of everything else."
"2006 vintage poured into a Chimay Chalice. Poured a crisp amber red with a huge carbonation that produced a big tan head that dissipated extremely quickly. Aroma is huge on the alcohol with raisins, vanilla and caramel. Taste is extremely sweet, almost cloying. Its almost hard to drink because its so sweet. Besides that there is brown sugar, sweet caramel and a huge 14% alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is lingering but full. This is the first time I've had this beer and probably will be the last."
"this beer amazes me every year. I forget about how amazing this beer is, but when I try it again it renews my faith in the extreme-micro beers! I regret missing the 2005 vintage, but must never forget ever again. It is expensive, but HIGHLY worth every penny!"
"Bottled in 2006 it's almost a translucent reddish brown with a crisp head that dissapates quickly. Smell of sweet ripe dark fruit, dark honey and a good scent of alchohol. Taste is rather deep and rich of dark fruits, brown sugar and achohol. mouthfeel is full with good carbonation that gives it a good spike going down. I love these kind of beers in the winter that gives an aroma and flavor that warm you inside and out, the color in this one is especially inviting."
"Drinkability-i wouldnt want to drink more than one, not only because of the abv, but because one is tasty enough for satisfaction like eating a fine chocolate-1 is enough."
"While you wouldn 't want to drink too much of this stuff, it is still something to sip on in the cool mid-winter's eve by the warmth of the hearth."
"There was plenty of malty goodness in each year. Aging it at least a year does improve it."
"Thin mouthfeel, low carbonation, a bit slick and syrupy. Slightly above average drinkability, but this is a sipper no doubt, due to the heavy flavors, sweetness and strength."
"Served in a 12 oz Samichlaus snifter. Golden brown in appearance with a fluffy white head. Smells of sweet maraschino cherries, big malts, and a bit of chocolate. Tastes of cherries, sugar, carmel, light vanilla, and some dark fruits. Also some whisky/bourbon type alcohol showed up in the finish. Mouth feel is slightly thick and syrupy. Good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is decent considering the high ABV. A bit too sweet for me, but still a nice enjoyable treat on a cold day. Worth a try!"
"Wow. 2007 vintage served on draft into a Samichlaus snifter. A thin ring of a head around the side of the glass over a rich cherry wood color. The first sniff is all about the alcohol, like a mild ABV liquor. Once you work through the alcohol note, there's malt, plums, raisins, a little apricot, too. Hops? Fuggedaboutit. You won't miss them. Flavor is more rich fruit notes with a strong malt backbone and a cleansing alcohol vapor to which you slowly grow accustomed as you glass diminishes. The carbonation and alcohol vapor are all that stand in the way of this being too thick and chewy, and they do so very well. This is a perfect apres feast drink, right up there with port or a sweeter liqueur. No need for dessert, this will complete a meal quite well on its own. A great example of a master brewer's art, an extreme beer that requires far more talent and patience than simply shoveling hops into a fermenter."
"·	Drinkability: Oh, this one is dangerous. Absolutely delicious on a cold night, warms the body, and a great bier to sit on for 45 minutes or so. Improves as it warms, and new flavors emerge. Excellent beer."
"D- this is a beer to savor and age(as long as you can wait). It is still amazing from its original '06 release. I would drink this before anything else in a night of tasting."
"Split a bottle of Samichlaus with some friends this past Saturday night at Deep Ellum. Poured it into a Belgian style goblet, and the first thing one notices is the lack of head or carbonation. The color was an intense copper. This doppelbock looks more like brandy than beer. The smell was overpowering of pure alcohol fumes. But the taste was not as harsh as I expected. It was smooth enough to enjoy if you like beers with gusto, but this one is definitely a sipper. This would be a fine after dinner drink anytime. A good beer to share too, as a whole bottle may be a bit much for some."
"couleur cognac, ambré foncé sans mousse ou presque, odeur de malt, de caramel et de sucre brun, goût brulant pour la langue, caramel, sucré à souhait, très longue en bouche. elle est chaude et réconfortante, une vrai bière pour les hiver quebecois. un peu moins sucré serait l'idéal."
"I do not agree that this is the finest beer in the world like it says on the back of the bottle, but I will see how it evolves in a few years and maybe add another review then"
"This is an interesting double bock. More potent and fascinating than other DB's I've had. Still, I could not drink more than one of these in a single night. Perhaps, it's too much of a good thing."
"D: For what was for a while the world's strongest beer this was fairly drinkable. Probably took me an hour and a half to drink the bottle but in no way was it a chore."
"Got another bottle for me? Bring it on. : )"
"d: This one was a chore to get through. Once and done for me with this one."
"pours a viscious copper/reddish-brown with no head and tiny bubbles Its even got great legs!. the flavor. the aroma is really earthy, the flavor is sweet and rasin like. very complex and deep with a sweet aftertaste that never sours. I can barely taste the alcohol, but its noticeable only when you breathe in. certainly a sipping beer, and one should set you up nicely."
"D- a solid ale, although more of a strong dark ale in my mind than a dopplebock"
"Drinkability : a very nice beer in the style doppelbock. I's high rate of alcohol will give it a deep color and it will improve with time (keep in the cellar), great as a digestive to drink slowly with a dessert (very good with chocolates)."
"Overall not my thing but I can understand why it is well liked. A very unusual lager."
"2006 vintage poured into a Duvel tulip. Vigorous pour for a minimal head with little retention. Color is a deep gold/copper/orange. Hmm, the strongest lager in the world. Isnt that an oxymoron of sorts? Lager inhibits complexity from cold fermentation temperatures. I expect a very one dimensional beer. Nose is very sweet, maybe a caramel sugar, nutmeg or something with maybe some citrus. Its one dimensional but hard to put an exact finger on just what it smells exactly like. Mouthfeel is very silky smooth. Wow, the flavor is nutty and finishes sugary sweet. Interesting. I'm not sure that it lives up to the most extraordinary beverage in the world such as the label says but the alcohol is insanely well masked for 14%. Its slightly too sweet and syrupy for high drinkabilty (not to mention the abv). Fun stuff though and worth revisiting."
"D - C'mon, it's fun. It's pretty good. It's not something to drink all night. Glad I tried it. Will have another when the mood strikes."
"Overall: This was a very nice sweet treat. Tons of flavors that are to be savored no doubt. It is a very big beer that I was honored to try."
"Edit: I haven't finished this yet and I am fairly tipsy. The ABV is ridiculous."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and the carbonation was perfect. Drinkability is not so great because the alcohol comes out and almost stings. An intersting beer that I think can age very well. I'll have to pick up another one and set it down."
"After having th Urbock 23 from the same brewery I wasnt expecting anything extraordinary from Samichlaus. However, this was truly an interesting and enjoyable beer. Not the worlds most extraordinary beverage, but a fine beer indeed."
"wow...this beyotch was bottled in 2004, but still puts off serious heat. Pours a beautiful, amber - rich and inviting. NO real head, but consistent carbonation. Smells familiar - brandy liquor, with dark cherrie and vanilla. Upon first taste - whoa! Pure rubbing alcohol. Nice brandy-ish beginning, but still leaves that unpleasant, nake alcohol aftertaste. As it warms, it improves (or maybe my tastebuds are deadening). Less offensive. Yet, the brandy and vanilla quality keep it coming back to the lips for yet another taste. Not bad. Very interesting. This one, even with 3-4 years on it, is still too hot for normal consumption, imo. The 14% is a wallop. Slow sipper if ever I had one."
"a great beer, but one or two will do it."
"I tried this beer on September 25, 2007 at 'Smokeless Joe's' in Toronto. The beer poured a reddish copper colour with a thin white head. The aroma was very sugary, almost maple. The mouthfeel was thick, creamy, and very little hint of carbonation. The taste was very sweet, almost cognacy, with a hint of bitterness."
"D- This is definitely one to sip on. Alcohol is very apparent, but for 14 percent, it isn't bad...quite the opposite. I enjoyed having it but more than one at a sitting would be too much."
"D: Warming. Like a glass of fine plumb brandy, this would make a perfect fireside beer on a cold night. I would go higher on the drinkability scale if it didn't put me on my ass so quickly."
"I will go back to the beer store and pick up a few bottles for sharing with my closest friends at christmas time."
"It's an interesting beer, unique in it's own way. I would like to try one every once in a while."
"Drinkability: Let's be real here, people. This bad boy is 14%. The taste is reaaaally alcoholic. I bought a 4-pack of this not knowing what to expect. I can only drink one of these every few days, and I'm pretty much done for the night after one of these. This is a novelty type thing that I could see drinking once a year in the winter... which is exactly what it's brewed for."
"D: It's a high alcohol brew and quite expensive, so I can't see having more than one of these at a time, it is a sipper definitely, I find that it is a great occassional treat, one that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Pricey for its size, but worth trying."
"Yeck. Some people seem to like this beer, but I cannot stand it. Its color is fairly pleasing, but this thing has no head. Barely even laces. The smell is fruity and alcoholic, and the taste is like raisins that have been soaked in vodka. If you really like the flavor of alcohol, this one is good for that. I just took my third drink, and cringed like I do when I take a shot of vodka. After swallowing, I can feel the fumes in my nose for about a second. It does have a redeeming aftertaste, like dried apricots or raisins. If it wasn't so heavy on the alcohol, I'd give it a better rating."
"OVERALL: Enjoyable after 4 years of patience. Sipper for sure. Have this brew 4 to 5 years after cellaring. I did not enjoy the results of seven years of patience! I still have a 2000, a couple 2001's, 2002's... oh well. We'll see."
"I'd recommend sharing a bottle, this one could stir up a nice conversation with a non-ba that enjoy fine hard liquor or porto"
"The beer was good, but it was just too sweet and too flat to make it a great beer. I find that this beer did not live up to its reputation."
"I was concerned about the lack of head, very sparse and quick to evaporate. Perhaps 12 years is too long. However the flavors quickly laid rest to the concerns. Raisony, Caramally, Malty, and powerfull after dinner beer. Obviously well deserving of its reputation as one of the world's finest. The lack of carbonation was disconcertining for the mouthfeel and the potent flavors would make it difficult to drink more then one or two, but certainly worth the price of a few bottles."
"A funny thing with this beer...I first heard about it in the Beeradvocate magazine, and tried it at the Sunset Grill and Tap. Afterwards I found it at a local bottle shop, and cellared it. The funny thing is that I keep finding older vintage versions of this beer more readily. I fished this 2004 bottle out of the basement to make room for the 2003 I found today. Anyway, on to the beer. It pous into a Chimay chalice a dark orange/honey color, with little heading, just a lace with some good retention. Smell revealed over ripe fruits, molasses, caramel, and boozy alcohol...perhaps closest to rum. First the fruit flavors dominate the taste, with lots of dates and figs. Toward the middle the honey flavors pull through in a huge way, soaking all those fruit tastes with honey and sweetness. The end result is a very big bite from the alcohol. This is a very hot brew, and the fact that there is little if any carbonation serves to make it taste all the more like hard liquor. The body of it is pretty thick and chewy. With the high ABV, this is definitely one to sip and take your time with. Compared to other newer batches of this, it is clear that this one has aged nicely with some of the flavors calming down somewhat. It is really difficult to classify this brew. It doesn't really taste like a doppelbock to me, but then again, it doesn't really taste like any style I have encountered exactly...maybe a barleywine with huge honey character. Awesome beer here. Can't wait to crack open the 2003 bottle I grabbed today to see how it differs from the rest. Cheers"
"Still a very fine beer."
"Overall this is a great beer. It reminds me a lot of many of the U.S. old ales. This is definitely a malt-packed brew, so be warned. Hops are nowhere to be found. This is true malt-liquor!"
"Overall impression: Pushing the limits of style here. Hot alcohol is way too prominent. I can't imagine what it tasted like fresh. I will try this again at the holidays...in about 5 years! Base recipe seems pretty good but the alcohol makes this one hard to enjoy. I'll put the other on away and forget about it."
"Served in a short wine glass on tap at Hop Devil in New York. I was told the vintage was 2001 and a must have. I thought it was a barley wine and when I asked no one seemed to know for sure. I was suprised it was a doppelbock, but what a special brew ! The appearance was chestnutty and ruby-reddish and brown with very low carbonation as expected, and no head. The nose included aged cherries, evidence of oak-barrel infused grapes perhaps. Reminded me somewhat of a flemish sour Belgian. The taste was sweet maltiness and very fruity. Lots of aged fruit working their magic in this one: prunes, raisens, dates, raspberries and cherries...wow! Mouthfeel was chewy and thick with fruitiness. Very much a sipping beer but I'd have no problem haveing a few more than one in one sitting, assuming I'm not driving of course. Very much enjoyable. It's kickass, but the etoh is very subtle. The word great comes to mind."
"Bottle into tulip glass, 2006 bottling. A: Clear brown, complete absence of head. S: Lots of sweet, somewhat fruity malt. Nicely spicy, scent of tawny port, brown sugar. T: Very sweet but surprisingly not overwhelming at all, the port character continues with a big alcohol bang at the end. Caramel, vanilla, bourbon long into the finish. M: Nearly no carbonation, smooth and thick. D: I've been wanting to try this beer for a while, and finally decided to search out a bottle after reading about it in BA--and I'm definitely not disappointed. The look, flavor, and feel to the beer makes me feel like I'm drinking some sort of esoteric chilled port. It's very unique, and insanely drinkable, especially for a 14 abv beer that I'm drinking right now in the middle of 95 degree heat. A genuine pleasure of a beer."
"Pours a nice ruby-brown, sun tea color with very little head that quickly goes away. Smells like malt and fruit, dark fruits like rasions and figs. Taste is very complex, fruity up front, with a slightly smoky middle, nice malt-carmel notes and a warming finish. Very complex, but maybe a little young, a feel like a year or two could allow all the flavors to really meld together. A refreshing brew that is easy to drink but worth cellaring."
"Gonna have to save the other half til tomorrow (hopefully the vacuum-stopper thingy will work) because this is a dessert type brew in my mind, thus I can't drink a whole one! Great brew; will get some more to let age."
"poured a very clear copper/orange with a tiny head that went totally away very quickly and left no lace... not a strong smell, but i'm getting fruit (raisin, plum, blackberry) and a little sweet bread. raison d'extra definitly comes to mind because the taste is of raisin, plum, fig, berry, caramel and booze... nice dry, creamy/syrupy finish that lingers on my tounge and in my throat... wow... that's interesting... goes down smooth and is so complex and full bodied i really want to take my time with it... to me there's no alcohol ""burn", just a nice warming sensation... i'm definitly going to pick up a couple four packs and see how long i can lay them down... to be broken out on a snowy winter day by the fire... it took me a long time to try this one, and i feel like i drank it out of season even though i'll drink an imperial stout in 100 degree weather while standing in the sunshine and love it... nonetheless, i truly enjoyed this one"
"I plan to store some away to see how it ages."
"D- has extremes between enjoyable and unenjoyable, wonderful aftertaste, sipping brew, complex, must try at least once, but there are much better dopplebocks out there"
"Samichlaus, waited a long time to try this, finally bought a bottle today. Pours a not very dark brown in color, smells a little better, a bit sweet. Tastes a lot like raisins, dried fruit, malt and alcohol, you can definetly tell it's a sipper. Mouthfeel is good, overall it's not a summer beer (duh) but a good nightcap, and not for the weak of heart or tastebuds. But I'll buy it again!!"
"2006 bottling. Poured a light brown, amber color with a small wispy head that never quite disappears. Aroma is very malty with strong alcoholic, winey notes in the nose. I can tell from the smell alone that this is going to be quite an experience. Taste is quite malty, very sweet with almost a brandy-like warming alcoholic note in each taste. The finish is also quite alcoholic. This is a very full bodied, rich beer. Certainly not one for the less adventurous beer drinker. The alcohol is not hidden at all, so it pays to sip on this one slowly. I remember this beer being much darker when it was brewed by Hurlimann, but it still has that huge malty backbone. I'll probably age the other 2 bottles from the fourpack several years to see how it matures."
"This 2000 version was graciously provided by beerbeing."
"ooh, PS. there may be a slight woody finish. Like on the breath a little."
"Very good, overall. I'm definitely glad to have tried it. It's certainly not something I'd have often, but nice for every once and a while. I let mine warm to near room temperature, and that suited it well. Recommended."
"Notes: What a find. Heard late last week that they had this at the Lionheart and I knew I had to get there before it kicked. A nice treat, and at 5.5 - 6.5 years old the alcohol seems to have mellowed a bit. I'm guessing this would be substantially hotter if it were younger. . . ."
"Chill it and pur it in shot glasses for a group. I'll pass on this one next time I see it."
"Poured a crisp deep amber with minimal head that diminished to nothing and left no lacing. The aroma was relatively weak with some fruitiness but not much. The beer was very rich and malty, somewhat complex, but the syrupiness somewhat gets in the way. The beer is heavy on the tongue as is expected. The alcohol is not quite as harsh as I anticipated, but it's still there. This is one to sip, certainly one I would not have that often."
"While thicker than some vintage barleywines / old ales I've had from the same year, this was an awesome drink. If you can get it or have it in your cellar I would consider you lucky!"
"I bet this would be a heck of a beer a few years down the road. I may try it again but never this green."
"Novelty only. I cannot stand an alcohol taste this strong in a beer. If I want a whisky, I'll have a whisky. Sorry, kids..."
"Ok.. Here we go. I've had this sitting in my fridge forever. It is from the 2001 vintage. Already six years old. When I poured it there was absolutely no head or any carbonation to speak of. The color is a very thick looking dark brownish-red. It looked like a glass of flat Coke.First sip just about took my breath away and made me pass out. I had the sour face when you suck on a lemon. OMG is this strong and overly sweet. The aroma is good and very profound with strong notes of figs, raisins, and heavy malts. The taste is horrible. It is so sweet I cannot even see myself finishing it. Flat mouthfeel with no carbonation. Overpowering ABV added to an sweet syrupy makes for a bad combination. It is like drinking cough syrup. I respect the ABV and it's 2001 vintage, but this is just not drinkable at all. I did notice some bitterness with each gagging sip I took. I can't believe I let this take up space in my fridge for 6 years."
"All and all, a pretty crappy beer that I will pass on next time."
"Overall: This was a great beer to finish the day with. It's been colder than normal, and it actually snowed today."
"A very warm full bodied mouthfeel. Definitely a slow sipper. The label gives information about aging. I'll have to try it out."
"2004 bottle. Chestnut brown with a small creamy white head. Aroma of ripe apples, brown sugar, plums, and vanilla. Flavor is bursting with sweet dark fruits, chocolate, toffee, and I detected a hint of tobacco as well. Alcohol is tremendously well masked, its detectable, but mellows a lot as the brew warms. Earthy, almost scotch-like finish. A beautiful beer."
"Defiantly worth a try."
"I can imagine this being one of the better drinks in the world if aged properly and for a long enough time."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, warming, sitcky sweet of syrup, along with over ripe fruit and cocoa infused caramel bouncing along the palate with a gentle alcahol burn."
"Great beer, will be getting several to stow away. Interesting because I drank two extremely different dopple bocks earlier in the day..."
"The flavor keeps improving over time, and both the smell and taste of alcohol has mellowed down quite nicely. It is a great aging beer, and it seems that around 6 years this is at its peak."
"All in all it's a pretty good beer. A bit overrated in my opinion, but nonetheless quite drinkable. I'd be interested to see how it mellows over a few years."
"Drinkability: Not for me. I appreciate the fact that the good brewers found a way to coax this brew to 14 percent, but I found it to be a sugary, sticky, lifeless bore, and the monster alcohol makes it a rough go. One and done."
"Samichlause is a syrupy elixir that is smooth and easy on the toungue. High in alcohol, but surprisingly drinkable compared to other somewhat similar styles."
"D- As with all very strong beers... it's wonderful, but not a session beer."
"DA: At 14% you can really feel an 11.2 oz bottle, the heat is rather high, even compared to the 21% DFH 120 IPA. It's flavors are extreme and it takes an extreme palate to really enjoy this beer."
"This beer is surprisingly drinkable. I am very surprised that this is so drinkable for a beer that tips the scales at 14% ABV. This manages to hide the alcohol pretty well. I think I'll wait a year or so before drinking another one of these just to see what some age does to this."
"Overall: A very different and very intense strong ale. If I am going to drink something like this, I prefer Avery's Samael's Ale with its wonderful oakiness. This is like Samael without the oak-aged flavor. Not bad at all, but not necessarily worth it (and literally impossible to find in my area)."
"Fairly drinkable for something at 14%, but definitely something to sip, savor and enjoy."
"Well, this will definitely become part of my cold weather beer adventures. I've read it cellars very well, which I will have to try. Definitely seek this one out and give it a shot."
"The second time I've sampled this beer, originally it was a 2003 and I wasn't all that impressed. The beer seemed to be too sweet, too one dimensional in terms of flavour, and a little overwhelming as far as the alcohol character is concerned. It might be my palette developing or the year itself but I have come round to this beer. I still think that the sweetness is a little bit excessive and it could have perhaps benefited from some form of balancing but I suppose at the end of the day this is a malt monster, and a malty beer, especially a lager, brewed to 14% is going to be pretty heavy on the sweetness. I definatly enjoyed this beer alot more this time, serving it at room temperature seems to bring out alot more depth in the flavour but it does push the alcohol to the forefront to some degree. Anyways, one of those beers everyone should try at least once, I have a 2005 cellaring at the minute and hope that maybe over time it will improve and develop further."
"Smells like sugar, booze, cheries, licorice, cat piss, and toffee. Tastes a bit like a strong mead loaded with candy sugar. Syrupy body, very sweet, seriously, disgustingly sweet. The ABV may be partially covered but the sugar sure as hell isnt. Lots of cherry taste but most other flavors are hard to distinguish because my tongue is burning from the sweetness. It makes me sick to my stomach and hurts my throat. My body rejects this as foul. I take no pleasure in this mess, although it has a really, really pretty chestnut body with reddish hues though no head what-so-ever. I think this might be a lot better after a decade in a cellar."
"Chewy toffee and port notes in the flavor (I aged mine for five years), creamy body with a mild sherry-like finish. The aroma was a musty and faint duplicate of the flavor and finish. This is a very fine after dinner beer/ cigar/ pipe/ by the fire. I had mine after dinner by the fire with some creme brulee. Wonderful."
"2005 Samichlaus pours a clear amber, with no head, just a delicate white lacing around the top. Smell is sweet malt, with rich and fruity raisin and toffee aroma. Taste is a huge malty sweetness with incredible complexity. Much more RIch and syrupy, without being overly thick. Alcohol is apparent, definitely a burn towards the end, but at 14% I would say well hidden. Hops are hiding as well, as expected. Carbonation is slightly more than I expected after the lack of head in the pour, just enough I think. I wish I had the cash to drink this one more often"
"Alll of the alcohol and sweetness really bring down the drinkablility. Overall its a decent Doppelbock."
"Adam"
"On a side note, this is an interesting beer which I would suggest at least giving a try sometime  if only for curiositys sake."
"I was very fortunate to have this beer on tap at Summits in Sandy Springs before it closed. This is a monster of a double bock at 14 % ABV. I drank this from a small ""sampler"" style glass. The color is a deep ruby-red / brown with virtually no head. However, there was a small bit of lacing. The aroma is deep and malty and you can smell the ephemeral alcohol quality to this beer. The mouthfeel is medium heavy, flat (low carbonation), and a bit slick. It has a good taste malty and sweet, maybe a bit of raisin and chocolate. However it is a bit too sweet. Strange at 14 % you would expect most of the sugar to be gone, that is unless it's non-fermentable. I like it but I don't think I could go beyond more that one in a sitting."
"This is a decent doppelbock. Very rich, sweet and intense. It tastes less boozey than malt liquors half its gravity."
"Bottled in 2004. Served in a pilsner glass, the Samichlaus pours a clear amber/copper color with a small white head. It smells sweet, like caramel malt, some dark fruit and alcohol. It tastes like raisins, figs, toffee, caramel, and you can taste the alcohol in the beer, but it's not overwhelming. This is a very malty beer, I can't taste any hops at all. Mouthfeel is medium, and it's smooth and a bit oily. Drinkability is good, but it doesn't take too long for the alcohol to catch up to you with this beer. I wouldn't drink anymore than one of these a night, but I would definitely buy the beer again."
"Syrupy sweet, my tongue is enveloped in a viscous blanket of carmelized sugar. A faint nuttiness is apparent upon aerating, as is a hot burn from the 14% ABV. This is a one trick pony right now, and too hot with alcohol to boot. I'm going to let this one settle for a while, and revisit later, hopefully with a more favorable review."
"Drinkability - I really enjoyed this beer, but would have a hard time drinking it too often. It's quite extreme as far as doppelbocks go. The malty, sweet flavors are very strong, as is the alcohol."
"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle labelled as 2005 edition. The beer was dark burnt copper color with almost no head. The aroma was stong and hinted at an ass-kicking from alcohol. The taste confirmed it, this beer tore my head off and crapped down my throat. It was way strong with alcohol, but extremely sweet at the same time. The mixture of sweet and burn made me pucker with each sip. A very strange and interesting dopplebock, but not easy-drinking enough to recommend."
"Served in a tulip glass on-tap at Roman's in Milwaukee. Appearance is a cocoa brown with a minimal amount of head. Aroma is maltiness with a ton of alcohol esters. Flavor was more of the same...this beer is very malty but also (at 14% ABV) has a ton of alcohol punch. It tasted to me as if someone distilled a Spaten Optimator. Mouthfeel is astringent and this beer made me want to pucker. Not a bad beer, but I couldn't get over how out-in-the-open its alcohol character is."
"D- The malts in this are way to over powering. It isn't to tasty or easy to drink. Not impressed with this at all."
"many thanks to BeerBeing for shipping this treat on the final leg of my No BS BiF"
"Poured into a chalice. Virtually no head comes out of an aggresive pour, but the color is a gorgeous clear ruby red almost like cognac. Ripe grape is the first scent that hits the nose followed by alcohol sweetness maybe a little caramel or toffee. Taste is sweet - very sweet actually and big on malt. There's some dark fruit and vanilla here, too - very complex and delicious. Mouthfeel is thick/chewy - slight carbonation gives this another dimension. There's a slight alcohol burn, but I think 14% is hidden well here. However, this is a sipper - no need to gulp this down. Savor every last drop. Highest recommendation."
"I definitely recommend this one for the winter holidays."
"One of these is all I could tolerate in a sitting. It's quite tasty, but it is still a very assertive beer. Not bad at all, but while I'm very glad I tried it, I won't be rushing out to buy it again anytime soon."
"Not sure if I'll get this one again, though I'm sure it'll grow on be as it warms, and I'd love to see what this one would be like after a few years of aging."
"Pours an amber color with some head not too much and doesnt leave much if any lacing, although I didnt expect it to with the kind of abv it has. Smells of raisins, cherry, sweet malts and alcohol. Very sweet tasting beer that is high on extremely sugary malts, a little bit of hop flavor tucked away in there as well as a little bit of a currant flavor. A little oily and Im not sure Id be able to drink more than one. It claims to be The worlds most extraordinary beer I dont think Id go that far but it is a nice beer and works great as a nightcap, its got an extremely warming feeling afterwards. Something I just noticed the bottle Im drinking is 2 years cellared so Im quite impressed on how this has held up even though I dont have a reference point for it."
"D - It is absurbly strong and not that good. I will pass in the future. Not a chore to finish though. Not really worth seeking out."
"A must try on tap, but a must-not drive home afterwards. Served in a brandy sniffer at my local pizza pub. The beer came out with a mild, fine carbonation and a light trace of foam atop. A very pale golden / copper color and crystal clear. The viscocity evident with a magnifying effect through the glass and shows heavy legging. Aromas of heavy, syrupy malts, ripe fruits (figs, dates, and pears) with a light nuttiness and strong maple syrup. Lightly buttery, oily and very sweet. The feel is very warm, nearly hot alcohols and a light tingle to the whole mouth. Numbing upon impact. Good beer, and a nice variety from the bottle."
"D: So very slow. Only one in a night. Not to say I won't get it again, but two of these would be too many."
"This was bottled in 2006, making this only a month old, which is most certainly the youngest Samichlaus I have ever run across. The new bottle had a small picture of an old man who I presume to be St. Nicholas himself. Poured into a stem glass, the beer looked orange amber, and crystal clear, and formed a small but durable head, thanks to the active carbonation. Smelled riotously spicy and spirituous, and gave a good indication of the sweetness to follow. Tasted sweet as ever, but there was balance in here in the form of alcohol heat and dryness, and a peppery spiciness. Pretty much puts an end to any night once opened. I have a few older vintages aging, but when I start a vertical comparison, Ill probably have to open both bottles early in the evening and have to sip on them for a long time. Better make sure the wife is not around, and the checkbook is locked up in a safe that night."
"Amber reddish color with a white head which disappeared in a few minutes. Odors are redolent of sweet ripe fruits. Sweet malt accents predominate with a subtle hop background. 14% alcohol is not evident in the flavor, an achievement in itself. A great beer, one I was lucky to find. The perfect winter nightcap and dessert beer, definitely a sipping beer. drinkability is limited by the abv, but I'll go out of my way to find this beer whenever I get the chance."
"Bottled in 2005. 14% ABV. Brewed once a year, on 12/6, then aged for 10 months before bottling. Poured into a snifter with a rush of carbonation. Orange/copper in color, with a white fizzy head that disappeared immediately. Not suprising for a beast of a beer. Big alcohol in the nose, along with sugar coated dark ripe fruit. Very warming and almost overly sweet. Thick, almost syrupy, with little carbonation left. Loads of fruit flavors, creamy. The flavor that stuck out would be described as syrup covered oranges. A huge beer, certainly a sipper. Some yeasty flavors come out as it warms. A world classic, sure, but a bit too sweet for me."
"Just drink it slowly to appreciate all the subtles in it."
"Pours a perfectly clear dark amber. The aromas are of heavy sweet malt and honey. A note of cinammon at the end. The taste is of sweet alcohol up front followed by an explosion of spices underpinned by a rich warmth of alcohol and a touch of soy. The mouthfeel is like the nectar of the gods- very sweet but pure and light, not sticky at all. Very good drinkability, but the sweet intensity and alcohol merit stopping at one. Really a delicious beer that really hasn't lost much by its transfer across the alps."
"Coppery to medium golden brown in color. No head but a decent carbonation level. Sweet, caramel aroma. Buttery and toffeeish. Somewhat winey. Huge, huge sweet malty flavor. Like sucking on a soft caramel. Some bitterness in the finish but I chalk that up to the alcohol more then anything else. Slighly oakey and somewhat wiskey like in the flavor.Very full body. Has a slight buzzing effect on the tongue. Dangerously drinkable and quite enjoyable. Between the syrupy sweetness and the high abv I dont know how many you would want in a sitting but a damn fine and unigue beer."
"2005 bottling. pours extrememly clear and clean, brown. not dark or cloudy in the least. very strange-looking. Nose is just a ton of alcohol with maybe some grape and other vague fruit odors. Taste is also ton of alcohol which totally dominate the flavor. I really didn't find it all that complex...some fruitiness as in the nose, but not much. Very thick and syrupy, kind of like drinking whisky mixed with beer. a sipper if i had to drink it again."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good, drinkability is hurt by the ABV."
"Still carbonated (phew!), this well-aged sample poured a rich brown color, almost like watery milk chocolate. A small brown head forms and then quickly dissipates. Aroma is very, very rich - full of caramel, figs, rum, raisin, and more. Sip is smooth and warm, like a fine brandy. Rich, supple, creamy, and slick, with big caramelized flavors of fig and rum. Warm and sumptuous, with just enough hops left to tickle the tongue. Very good - I'm impressed by how well this has stood up over time."
"D: This beer aged is a different beast than a young subject. With some age, this beer is a force to be reckoned with. Simply delicious."
"My first bottle, and I may edit this review. As a first impression, it's pretty unique and odd, definitely a sipper."
"I want to propagate my cellar with lots and lots of this brew."
"Drinkability: I never tasted the original so I cannot compare but this elixir is mighty impressive; kind of a dopplebock cum barleywine, it is well worth seeking out but you have to know what you are getting into - if you don't like after dinner liqueur such as Cointreau or Drambuie, you are not going to like this"
"I didn't realize that this was a malt beverage of 14% ABV. This was brought out w/ the bottle and a mug. I poured it into the mug and it had absolutely no head at all. Quite a bit of carbonation, a brown color w/ bubbles. Smell is of sugar cane and mollasses. The taste is simply ok, but the alcohol bite is extreme. You can taste every bit of the alcohol in this one. It goes down warm like a bourbon and has a similar taste w/ more of a sweetness to it. It is cold outside, so it warms you quick. Hard to drink many of these though."
"2005 version. Pours very still, with no head but a slight stream of bubbles floating upward, and a body the color of hot diluted molasses. Big aroma that screams sweetness -- hot alcohol, candied fruits, raw sugar. Big sweetness up front (sugared oranges), caramel, berry fruits, and a touch of malt bitterness rounded out by hot alcohol. Creamy mouthfeel with almost no carbonation and quite a bit of alcohol. That present alcohol is the one part to take away from the drinkability of this beer; for a brew of 14%, this is suprisingly smooth and drinkable. Overall, this brew is pretty great -- huge alcohol, huge tastes, definitely something to be savored and paired with food. It's only real flaw is the present alcohol, which can be overlooked."
"Drinkability is one a year! It's a huge beer, cleaner than a barleywine, but also suffering from yeast defects and under-hoppiness. I wouldn't call it a sipping beer, goes down best when it fills your mouth soaking every sense of your palate. I want to get another of the same or older vintage and age it longer. This is one which can only get better with time."
"A very well crafted strong lager. Not very gulpable though."
"Sampled at Sam's a week ago and thought it might be fun to try after thanks giving dinner with a buddy. Poured into a flute, none aggressive head. The color was a wonderful purple, brown, rust color. Nose was strong barely presence, with definite yet pleasing alcohol scents, sort of earthy or barn yard like even. Having little experience with doppelbock the closest thing I could think of was barley wine, which to me has a similar smell. I found it a little hard to drink at first, but as it warmed up, both the scent and taste became much more accessible. This is defiantly worth a try, not something I'd drink often though. I bought two so one is going in my cellar till next year. See you then Samichlaus."
"I'm planning a Samichlaus clone to be brewed in January. I hope I can come close to the original."
"D: At 14%, this is no pounder. One as a nightcap is more than enough."
"Drinks pretty easy considering the abv. I can discern no difference between this & the hurliman version from back in the day when this was THE strongest bier in the world. Got to try just for the sake of repsecting the extemism. The original triplebock !"
"Poured into a stein, it's a nice looking, reddish brown beer, but clear - not at all cloudy. Not much carbonation and almost no head at all. The nose is a combination of alcohol, spice, nuttiness and a touch of cereal or bread. The flavor is a bit much. Initially the nose translates directly to the palate. Overwhelming nut/bread and alcohol flavor, which is folowed up with a syrupy sweet aftertaste which is just too much and not unlike brandy. The mouthfeel is quite thick and syrupy as well. They just took this beer too far. It's not the high ABV either. It's as if they fermented maple syrup and bottled it. I'm not a big fan of doppelbocks but this is definitely my least favorite thusfar. I'll give it another shot a year from now and see if it improves, but at this point, it's not a recommended purchase."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer but its strength makes it hard for me to finish a bottel without much help."
"The drinkability of this 14% ABV Brew. Is unsurpassed. This is a master brew. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"This one has potential and I will cellar the other two I have for a couple of years before revisiting this beer....young ( a year old or less) its pretty 2 dimensional but still I like the flavor better than many young barley wines and imperials Ive tried."
"While I really did enjoy this, I think it would have been better to wait awhile- a very intriguing beer."
"Edit: after bringing this beer around to various tasters, I decided to give it another go, and I actually find it palatable, but still nothing exciting."
"D - Drinkability isn't great, but overall this is excellent and will be re-visited on many occasions."
"D: I can't say this is an easy thing to drink, It's worth a try if you are into big malty beers, but not something I would get again. I really can't stand how much it remind me of cough syrup. I'm starting to doubt I'm going to be able to finish it (though I really don't want to waste something so damn expensive, over five bucks for a 12oz bottle!). Maybe if I had a cough to cure."
"I poured out a 2005 vintage and was surprised by the amount of carbonation. It's copper clear and formed a small head and then disapated quickly in my tulip bulb glass. Taste was amazing, hints of rasin, rum, port, and molasis ginger cookies? The mouthfeel is thicker/more syrupy than most dopplebocks due to the high sugars which give it the 14% alcohol rating. It's definately a sipper. I goes well with a night of surfing the net. Drinkability is a little harsh with the alcohol burn, but this is the very reason I like this beer."
"This was bottled in '05...so I gues you milage might vary, but I liked this. My only knock on it is the lack of carbonation."
"Reddish amber hue-medium white head- soft nose of light apricot jam  chewy thick body, it tells you it is in your mouth  sweet tawny port taste  tender long lasting aftertaste Reddish amber hue-medium white head- soft nose of light apricot jam  chewy thick body, it tells you it is in your mouth  sweet tawny port taste  tender long lasting aftertaste"
"At 14%, this is hardly a session beer. It's certainly worth drinking, because you can see the potential that it has if allowed to age for a while. This is one of those beers I'd like to start buying 12 or so of each year and drinking one of each vintage each year."
"Overall this beer is dangerously drinkable. At 14% abv, even an 11.2oz bottle could be trouble, depending on hydration level and stomach contents. The alcohol, though evident, is not overpowering, and you could get sodded real fast if you weren't paying attention. Nonetheless, this is an amazing and complex beer...a pinnacle of achievement for Eggenberg and for brewing in general. I cannot wait to try the other three bottles in the coming years, as aging will only increase the splendor of this already majestic brew."
"D: Not very drinkable, although the taste is strangly addicitive. The ultra heavy mouthfeel and crazy syrupyness of this beer really take off major points. Very small sips as if I was sampling a brandy or cognac, again this should not be presented in a 12oz bottle."
"i would love to see this come in those little airline alcohol bottles. what are they one or two fl. ounce? yeah, i would dig that."
"Overall: I guess this is the beer that finally made me stop making comments like good within style or atypical of style. Samichlaus is supposed to be a dopplebock, but to me its much more similar to a Strong Dark or a Quadrupel. Who cares? Its a great beer. Highly recommended."
"this beer is thick, but on a cold night it will do you right."
"Any beverage that claims to be ""The World's Most Extraordinary Beer"" desereves much closer scrutiny than most. Although, the picture of the brewery that BA has seems to be reason enough to earn its name. This beer pours a dark amber color, and smells like malt with a hint of alcohol. Taste is interesting, very heavy on the alcohol (not surprising with 14%). There is a syrupy consistancy as it goes down, and it coats the inside of your mouth for a while. I dont much like it, as the alcohol is very apparent in this, but then again it's not my fav kind of beer. For those who love BIG BEERS that you can only have one at a time, this is for you."
"Drinkability: The flavor is pretty good, but really unbalanced for a bock beer. The alcohol flattens malt development and characteristic sweetness. A real winter warmer if that's your thing, but one was enough for me. The overemphasis on the alcohol probably means I won't be buying this again any time soom."
"Pours an attractive enough fiery amber with nary a head - not surprising at 14%. Nose is slightly metallic upfront, with notes of apple skins/cider, caramel and a whole lot of booze. Taste is intensely potent on the forepalate - supersweet, vinous, and caramel malt finishing with nothing but hangover-worthy booze. Mouthfeel is thick, rich and slick with medium carbonation. So thick that the flavor lingers in your mouth indefinitely. This is an intense beer, but it lacks any semblance of subltety or balance, even as it warms - just a sugar/booze bomb. Glad I tried it, but I don't see myself seeking it out again."
"Doesn't drink too easy, but not particularly difficult. The bartender lady made me try a sample before she poured a full glass, to make sure I didn't send it back. Must not be too popular. Well, I finished it, mofo! Woot woot! Oh, hold up where am I? Dude, where--where am I?"
"On tap at the Dirty Truth. A rich cherry pour with very little head. Smell is great! It's a combination of cherries, molasses and brandy! Taste follows suit....cherries, molasses, with a great slightly dry hop finish. Extremely smooth and drinkable. Alcohol is high but not overly pronounced. A great, well-crafted brew!"
"This beer is extremely drinkable in all weather in my opinion, but most people think it must be a Christmas seasonal. It would be good for a Christmas warmer, but I still like it all times of the year."
"D: No. This is not a beer for casually chugging, or as a session beer. Use it as a dessert beer or with hardy robust dishes, or as a digestif. This was an interesting beer experience, but now I can say been there, done that, and won't do it again"
"Dark brown color.. very little head on this one. The malt sweetness is easily the most distinct flavor here. There are some dark fruit flavors that add to the complexity, but it's all about the sugary sweetness...add in the ridiculous amount of alcohol, and this is one truly potent beer. Too sweet for my particular tastes, but if you appreciate malt-bombs like this, you're sure to enjoy this one."
"It is certainly a sipping beer more than a session brew. It had the texture of a fine cognac. I have a 2005 vintage stored away - wonder how long I can hold off..."
"Sweet, strong, yet tasty, the body is rather heavy with a smooth and warming mouthfeel that's easily consumed. Sip on this one, it's a heavyweight that demands respect...whew!"
"14%? the strongest beer i've ever tried? i honestly can't tell much of a difference between this and several that i've had that have been of a lesser abv. yes it's high octane but i could easily drink one or two, any time. the next step for me - what's available to order in japan - samuel adams triple bock."
"This is pretty rough around the edges, but, beneath all the alcohol, it seems like this would shape up quite nicely, with a few more years of age."
"Bottom line: This is a great brew to ""nurse"" in the cold winter months. So why am I reviewing it in May? Because I didn't review it the other times I had it. ;^)"
"I would suggest this beer to be enjoyed with a cigar, for the flavors it would impart to the tobacco would be heavenly. Savor it, and share it with someone who values complexity and depth in a good drink."
"Do what you have to do to find this and try it on your own. Explanations from me or anyone else are simply pointless. Get it, sit down, put on your favorite tunes and enjoy!!"
"Purchased an 11.2oz bottle from Big C's Liquor store for $4.19. What caught my eye is the proclaimed ""World's most extraordinary beer"" on the front of the bottle. Pours a clear copper color with not much carbonation or head. Smell is sweet fruit and alcohol. Taste is very sweet and fruity and a bit syrupy. Overall, this is a wonderful brew. This beer dangerously hides the 14% alcohol that is present."
"Overall, I like this beer. I wish I had someone to share the bottle with, though, because it will be difficult to finish it all by myself due to the high ABV. Definitely a sipping beer. Worth trying and recommended."
"D - This beer is the closest thing I have experienced to sipping bourbon with a splash of water. It has the same consistency with a slight alcohol bite. A nice beer but at 14% it is definitely a sipper."
"Pours a crystal clear, light caramel color with thin dissapating head. Gorgeous. Aromas are very sherry like, lots of alcohol, caramel maltiness, dried fruits, a little smoky. This brew goes down incredibly sweet, starting out with the heavy alcoholic dose, syrupy, medium carbonation, raisiny almost toostie roll chocolate? My half bottle will be enjoyed, but is plenty! Bottled in 2004, perhaps too new?"
"Purchased from Big Ten Liquor Mart In Ann Arbor a couple years back and aged in my cellar since that time. Pours a soda pop one-finger head that is gone in moments. Crystal clear dark copper liquid. Smelled very fruity estery during the pour. To the nose it smells likely sherry. Cherry, alcohol, soured fruity esters (mostly raisin, but some tamarind), and way beneath, a hint of german malts. Tastes brandy, cherry sour, clean alcohol sting leading to an aftertaste that's caramel, wet & sweet & rich malt with a warming alcohol. Whoa, I would never have anticipated the delicious aftertaste after the (rather unpleasant) first impression. Yeah, definitely some german bock character, but it comes across as soured because of the potency of the alcohol. Thick body that passes over the tongue. Essentially no carbonation (but a nice alcohol sting hangs around when I would normally expect tiny carb bubbles to form on my tongue in the aftertaste)."
"I find this one a very drinkable beer.... maybe a little too drinkable, considering the high alcohol content."
"Not bad, certainly a beer to sip on a special occasion. Drinkability is decent, I feel, considering one and you're done, but overall a very unique beer, and not too bad either."
"Liquid candy with the gentlemanly sipping quality of a well-aged whisky. Let's be honest, it's not a daily beer, but for special occasions, especially in the winter months, choosing this one would exhibit exceptional taste. Gives a hellish buzz too."
"It's no surprise, I guess, that this beer is brewed in a ""castle""."
"Drinkability - a delicious dessert beer, aged 5 years is just about perfect I'd say."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is a very high nitro alcohol beer. The beer is full bodied. The beer is a sipping beer owing to high nitro alcohol and thick sweetness. This beer would be good for sharing with others."
"Very warming. It would be the kind of beer to sit around the fire after a day of skiing but I'll enjoy it again, just sitting around a campfire."
"Always great to let this one age a bit if you can."
"Mouthfeel- a semi-syrupy yet over warming and sweet palate that makes a good driven balance down the throat."
"In any case, I guess it is beer. Doesn't look, taste, smell, or act like a dopplebock, however. Pours a strong gold with powerful carbonation going nuts throughout the glass. THe beer really is a bit too sweet - it could use a stronger malt presence to balance it out. An interesting experience, but not one that I would want to have every day."
"2002 Bottling. Strong malt notes with a big alcohol smell and a touch of sweetness. Amber colored. Headless. I even busted out some chocolate cake for this. Isnt helping the flavor any. I had the old version in high school and while it was long ago it was an important moment in my life and I remember it being more rich and darker. Still some interesting flavors here: fruits (apple, pear), nuts and of course alcohol. Kinda a sugary liquor when you get down to it. Nowadays there are many beers with this level of alcohol that handle it a LOT better."
"Looks dark, nutbrown, teh reputation gets in my head and I'm sucked into saying this is good enough of a look to merit a smelling... rich, thick malty smell with a hint of spice. Taste like a super strong Belgian (mimics smell, huge warming feeling, lacks bitterness), only the mouthfeel is more like port. Fairly drinkable, between a port-like beer (Sam Adams Utopia) and a strong Belgian, you'll finish the bottle, no sweat."
"Overall not for the faint of heart. This one used to scare the bajesus, but now i can handle it with quite an enjoyment. Not my favorite of the style, but still a great and appreciated beer."
"Drinkability isn't bad, but cleary affected by the huge ABV."
"Overall, I'm pretty impressed. It's unlike any lager I've ever had before. The bottle says malt liquor and honestly it kind of reminds me of a bourbon or scotch...and I'd much prefer this over any of those. It's up in the air whether I'd order anymore of these online or not but it's definitely a beer I would buy again given a better opportunity to do so."
"Way way way too sweat for my taste, but I rather enjoyed drinking it simply for what it is. Brewed only one day a year, December 6, with a secondary fermentation of 10 months+, this beer is something that should be respected and appreciated for what it is."
"Overall, I'm definitely glad I tried this; I had heard that it is extremely rare, but I stumbled across around 20 bottles on the lower shelf of BevMo in San Diego, hiding behind a few stacked cases of Wersteiner. If you think your palate is capable, give this a try."
" This is a brew that I thoroughly enjoyed but, with a 14% ABV I figured caution would be in order. Would be really great as a nightcap."
"I couldn't drink much of this, but then, you don't have to! A really nice warmer for a cold winner day. (a beer for snow shovelers?) Actually this would be great after dinner either with desert or just to sip."
"Definitely a classic though not a typical dopplebock, more like an example of just how strong that style can get. Nevertheless, a real treat and, while far from a session beer, something every serious craft beer lover should try. Highly recommended."
" A complex beer that falls just a bit short for my taste, but still an excellent and special product. Could not imagine myself having more than one in a sitting. Glad to have tried it and a nice way to cap the holiday season. Cheers!"
"Enjoyable to try this classic on tap at Ludwig's Garden in Philly. Pours dark honey almond, and cloudy with a minor light tan head and fine but minimal lacing. Nose of some smoke and also a wiff of cognac/brandy. Strong, tasty and vinious brew. notes of molasas, roasted woody malts, peat, brandy, cloves and cinnamon. World class nightcapper/sipper."
"On tap at Brouwer's cafe in Seattle. Main differences I noted between the draft version and the bottle I reviewed earlier is that the mouthfeel is improved out of the tap...some of the overly syrupy texture gives way to a tiny bit of carbonation that makes this a bit more drinkable."
"Just stood up after drinking this one... Woah , you can feel the 14% ABV and im pretty sure i felt the alcohol move around in my stomach. lol."
"While drinking this, my friend and I coined the phrase self regulating sipper. There is just no way that this beer can be taken quickly. This is an awesome beer, but I dont think I could ever have more than one."
"There's a bit of a nip from the alcohol, but it's welcome at the very end of the day. As the bottle claims, it is quite an extraordinary beer."
"D: Approachable, but its strength is inhibitive."
"it was worth trying this bad boy to get an idea for it but i like a beer to exhibit some complexity or interesting notes...the world's strangest beer is tough to get down...maybe longer aging makes for a more well-rounded experience? not recommended..."
"Toffee and coffee? Yeah, they're there. Figs? I can't even describe it, words don't do it justice . . ."
"The world's strongets lager? Well you have to taste it. Iit poured with very little foam and a red amber color. The smell was of fruits and candy. It tasted very sweet and fruity, almost like some kind of thin syrup. An alcohol burn in the throat. This beer needs the right man/woman to be appreciated. I'm sorry but I couldn't finish it. If they changed the name into something like Rambo 10 000 it would be a big seller in India!"
"poured a mudium reddish color with sparse head. Smell is very strong on malt with dark fruit(figs, prunes) also evident. Almost a whiskey-like smell. Taste is very strong on malt, with the alcohol showing its massive presence. Strong alcohol bite. Finish is also very strong on alcohol. Not my type of beer."
"over all i would say it was nice to try but i will not be getting another one of these in the future."
"Drinkability: I would love to say I could drink more of this as it is very good, however, at 14% I should probably not."
"Body is big, slick, and almost syruppy. Coats your palate with each sip. Very good and worthy of praise, but be careful. One bottle is enough to split 3 ways."
"Opinion: This is as similar to a wine as a beer. It is very assertive and aggressive on the palate. It is a whole lot different if you are talking about traditional DoppelBocks. This ain't no Celebrator, and has very few Melanoidins or other rich malt flavors. Its calling card is as much alcohol produced esters as anything. It is a world class beer, and one to be commended...for managing to get a Lager yeast that high in alcohol if nothing else."
"I enjoyed it, it's unlike any other doppelbock I've had. I was lost in trying to discover more traditional malt flavors and I found no hops at all. Just the same I believe this to be a fine brew. I expected the alcohol to be un front, in your face at 15%, but it wasn't as harsh as I expected."
"I really enjoyed this unusual beer. I will definitely drink more of this. I have heard this beer being compared to a dopplebock, but it is much more intense. I have found this brew to be dangerously easy to drink. Very nice."
"And of course, the drinkability of a 14% bomb that doesn't even hide the alcohol right certainly drops low on my book as well. plus, who'd be up for buying and drinking more than one of these? stock up on aunt jemina and cheap rum instead."
"Had this on tap last evening over at Mahars, from what I w as told it was 2004 vintage. Brew was poured to a brown color with a lot of red like highlights. Brew had no head what so ever. The aroma is more or less of alcohol with dark fruits. Not a bad smelling brew. The taste reminds me a bit of cold medicine with its alcohol taste dominating and the fruit flavors complementing it. I am not really able to pick much more up from the taste as this brew acts like syrup and really coats the mouth and the above stated flavors seem to stay with me even after I have finished the brew! Not a bad brew, not my favorite but would get it again."
"What a fantastic, unique beer. Very drinkable for 1... although it seems like it should take a good hour to drink. Almost like a wine. I cannot imagine drinking it as I would a typical lager - one of these is enough for a night (14% abv)."
"Drinkability is only average. I surely wouldn't want another right now, and I think my tongue has had enough of this syrup to last me quite a while until I may try it again. Either way, I am glad to have at least tried this, ""World's Most Extraordinary Beer," despite any disagreements I may have with the statement on the label."
"Drinkability  Its almost unfair to rate the drinkability of this beer. Its hard to have too many of these without being overly inebriated. It sure is easy, maybe too easy, to finish a single beer."
"I don't know why this is considered a doppelbock, it's nothing like Celebrator or Aventius. Pours a orangy/golden color, nice carbonation, real nice head. Lacing was like a small head thorough out the whole drink. This brew is very sweet, it's nothing like a doppelbock, nothing. Medium body. Alcohol was present through out the whole session. Very drinkable, but at 14% watch out."
"The world's most extraordinary beer this is not (as the label claims) but it's easily worth a go."
"Pours a deep clear amber with minimal head/ carbonation. The smell is a musky deep grainy one. Quite a bit of sweetness with a surprising amount of candied/ dried fruit. VERY warming on the waw down. Like some kind of liquer. can't say I've had anything quite like it. Like a clean malt candy. Feels actually nice and slick in the mouth. This clearly is an apertif, meant for a long slow sipping...."
"This is a dessert beer, drink it at the end of a meal, and slowly! I was impressed at the worlds strongest lager."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"2004 version. The self proclaimed ""world's most extraordinary beer"". This beer has a dark brown color. Even a hard pour can not induce a head. The carbonation bubbles rise so slowly, it appears they are almost floating around in the beer rather than rising. Malty, caramel aroma. The alcohol burns the nose. Caramel flavor with dark fruits and spice. This beer is very sweet. The high alcohol is not at all hidden. The mouthfeel is syrupy. Little carbonation. Definitely a slow sipper. I know lots of people love it, but I can't get into this beer."
"I'm an admitted hophead, and I can't single out a single bitter note to this brew. It's a dopplebock alright. I cannot stress enough that all I taste is alcohol and sweet, but this is just so damn smooth. It goes down deceptively easy. Be careful with this brew, I'm not even done and I feel like I've downed half a bottle of wine."
"This is a great beer. I'm going to hang on to the other 3 bottles of this and see how they age. I highly recommend this beer."
"Dark ruby red, with thin, yet large champagne bubbles that form a decent cap; large sugary patches are noted. Thin tan swirls round off the head. Alcohol, raisins, almonds, apple core and some caramel on the nose; so delightful I can imagine a Yankee Candle Samichlaus offering! Huge bodied, massive sugary based caramel malt body; toasty offerings combined with oak and port, plums, fresh baked banana bread. A little hop come-and-go tastings near the end. A mouthfeel that is not comparable; its like sipping a fine port or aged whiskey; the 14.double zero ABV is nearly non-existent, yet incorporates the flavors masterfully. A treasure indeed!"
"In fact, it's a totally different beer in my opinion; one that's much closer to their Urbock 23º. It's rich and full with some caramelish notes, and there's also more fruitiness to it, but it's lost the richness of the dark malts and the alcohol comes through too easily. Otherwise it's fairly similar in appearance, mouthfeel, and drinkability. Which leaves me with one major difference... the different vintages of Hurlimann's Samichlaus seemed to age a bit, softening and improving, but I don't give this one much hope other than a softening of its alcohol."
"A great nightcap. Very drinkable."
"I must admit I was drawn in by the marketing on the bottle/4-pack (""brewed only once each year""), which was foolish of me. Shame on me for thinking higher-priced beers would be better than old standbys like Corsendonk or Chimay."
"I've had this one quite a few times, but I have never reviewed it, well I have notes here from a tap version of this a 1996 keg, that I had a glass from at Ludwigs in Philly a few months ago. Anyways, this is a dark cola brown brew with a fizzy khaki head. It is reminiscent of an eisbock in looks, but the aroma is much more deep, imho. Very complex with a huge maltiness as well as maple flavors, and maybe a hint of coffee, and dessert as well. Dark fruits and nuts also slip into the olfactory senses. Taste is doughy and malty with not much of an alcoholic feel except for a slight ""port-like"" tinge of booze at the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous and the drinkability is good, but not excellent unless you are freakin' insane. a lovely tipple, aged keg seems similar to aged bottles, but super fresh this one is not too good. Give it at least 1 year...if not more."
"pretty much average across the board for me. Very sugary tasting which is to be expected. It says dopplebock for the description on this website but it says malt liquor. Probably some importing / exporting type law that makes them state malt liquor. This is the finest malt liquor I've ever had :) though as it is complex and syrupy to the point of you can actually see the beer cling a bit to the glass. Super strong alcohol taste and aroma. There is a candy corn background and the alcohol is snappy and needed with such a thick brew. Without a doubt a nightcapper. this is a beer to have right before bed not necessarily because of the alcohol content but because it would ruin any beer you have after it because of its over the top rich syrup type content."
"As this beer warmed, it became more interesting and more potent. Despite it's gravity, it was very drinkable and enjoyable. On tap."
"Alcohol still carries this beer with a brandy like flavor. Malt is super sweet and caramely, almost to the sickening point, bu doesn't cross the line. Still excellent flavor, but carries a high dose with more than one."
"11.2 ounce bottle purchased at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California, poured into a standard beer mug. 2004 vintage. Solid inch of off-white head rises on the pour, collapses quickly leaving no lace to mention. Body is bubbly, bright amber and gold highlights around the edges. Smell: Ginger snap cookies; alcohol soaked raisins, some prunes too; apple juice; nasal-widening alcohol fumes, but not unpleasant; finishes with a nice freshly baked breadiness. Taste: Thickly sweet upfront, wow; let me consider this. Opens very sweet, simple sugars, fruit juices (peach, apple, hint of pineapple; orange zest); with a very peppery underbelly. Alcohol warmth is a slow and strong, rolling around my throat and gut -- warm! The middle has some hint of hop action, but this brew is all about the powerful malts. You have to bow down to the beer gods when you imbibe this nectar. Unusual and unusually strong. Aftertaste is a nice pall of alcohol heat, and a lingering sweetness on the back of the palate. Mouthfeel: plenty carbonated (middling, you could say), a little sticky but not too heavy."
"Excellent brew with a lot happening on the palate, but it has to lose points for drinkability, one bottle bringing me to my saturation point."
"edit, two years later: I haven't tried this again, nor do I want to. I wanted to add that before, and since trying Samichlaus, I have had many big beers of similar/greater strength. I love massive beers, but I can still remember what Samichlaus tasted like and it was damned terrible!"
"Pours a syrupy deep mohogany with a nice head that quicky perishes. The nose is mostly whisk(e)y, with hints of caramel and cherry. Again whisk(e)y dominates the taste, but vanilla, caramel and malts make their presence known. It's hard to miss the 14% abv in this one, so I don't see myself having more than one in a sitting, but it's a nice way to end the evening."
"drinkibility: something's got to be tampered with, and i don't think time is the only trick."
"Light mouthfeel that is subdued by the burn. Not drinkable this fresh, but I'd like to try one with five years on it."
"Overall a powerful must-try beer."
"Drinkability: Thank god I bought a 4-pack. This guy's young, and at 14% it can be put in the cellar for a while. I was told, however, ""You can definitely drink it now," by some folks who know their stuff. And they didn't lie. I can't wait to try these as the years progress. This is amazing stuff, and you should at least try a bottle for sure. But beware; if you're not a big beer lover and you can't tolerate high ABV beers, you may want to stay away. Otherwise, this is an experiment in greatness, and I'm glad I have a few left to carry me through future winters and celebratory nights."
"Overall, I was expecting something a whole lot better from this beer. Perhaps if this had more than 2 years aging it would be better, but for me, this just isn't working. While not terrible, it's just not as good as I would have hoped it would be."
"2003 vintage. The color is a nice dark amber. Head is short and light brown. The aroma is very eisbock-like and is of rich, dark malts. Smells are of a dark fruit mix with a moderate alcohol aroma. The taste is rich and complex. Dark fruit tastes are all-over here and range from sweet to somewhat dry. An alcohol taste is noted and contributes to complexity. Drinkability is hampered by the 14% ABV and overall richness of Samichlaus. This is a very interesting brew, tastes more like an eisbock than a dopple and has an insane amount of malt flavor."
"It will be interesting to see how this one ages."
"Will I have another tonight...no. Will I have another again...definately!"
"Drinkability: This beer is closer to scotchs, port wines and liquors rather than other beers. It was good to review it, but I won't drink it on a regular basis. I will rather drink a beer more usual to the standards."
"Looks like a glass of bourbon with about the same amount of head, smell and taste profile are completely dominated by alcohol, slides around the mouth like a swig of 10/50 W motor oil, two gulps later this was down the drain, thank god they only bottle it occassionally, why waste your time with this stuff when you can have a nice single malt scotch?"
"A unique brew, and definitly not for me. Poured out with no head and very low carbonation. Colour of a darker scotch, amber red. Heavy odors of fruit and earth. Overly sticky sweet flavor, with notes of alcohol (14% ABV). This may be the most extraordinary beer in the world, but not the best in my mind. Label states it gets better with age. Hopefully it does. Mine was from Dec 2004 and consumed in March of 2005. I'm thinking it's probably not aged enough. Will re-review again with a longer aged sample."
"Drinkability and Overall: Had a bottle at the new South Side Saloon in Johnstown. Not a bad beer, but considereing the high alcohol content, there was much more they could've done with this beer."
"Smells like liquid carmel, spicy apple cider, the dead of winter or the height of the holidays. Small head the color of sunbleached sand, disappears the second after you see it. Lazy light carbonation. Sweet taste of maple syrup, asian flavors like teriyaki and soy sauce. Half way through the alcohol really creeps up on you and reminds you that beer deserves your respect. It is a slow sipper. If you take it too fast it becomes cloying. Just half is sufficient; next time I will split it with a friend."
"Clear orange-amber body with a finger of creamy, off-white head with some lacing. Nose is very sweet, sugary/syrupy, with some fruit (bananas?), and alcohol; very liquer-like. Sweet, honey-syrup malt and fruit flavors up front. Intense and pungeant, but surprisingly not cloying. Complexity added by fusel alcohol that burns controllably, warming me nicely. Faint hop bitterness detectable in finish. Smooth, medium-bodied, with low carbonation, and more drinkable than I remembered, and definitely more drinkable than it should be!"
"It just so happens that the last beer I reviewed in my notes was a Bud Light (just for shits & giggles). What a way to follow up the Bud Light reviewwith a beer of such magnitude... A behemoth of a beer. From what I can tell, there is no stronger doppelbock on earth (though there are a couple others that come in at 14% ABV as well)."
"This beer was somewhat hard to drink, a little too sweet for frequent consumption."
"Epitome of Mouth Feel I swallow this slick Samichlaus 2003 - Carpe Diem"
"Huge froth of big bubble madness settles to a loose layer of smaller stuff. Copper hue, almost edging towards claret, with good clarity and slow action. Candy corn sweetness on nose with a deep malt backing; it almost seems like there is a hint of earthiness at its core. Ouch, the almost malted ball sweetness (not chocolate) bangs right beneath the eyes and is followed closely by a stinging alcohol torch that rips down the middle of the tongue and throat; almost a banana taste with a crème brulee flamed outer layer. Not sure what all the hype is surrounding this one, though perhaps this was a standard bearer of big beers before the extreme movement took off in the U.S."
"This doppelbock poured a clear, orange-amber color with tan foam that settled. The smell was lightly sweet with a complex, malty aroma and a hint of banana. Alcohol was also evident in the aroma. The taste was very rich and malty with the flavor of alcohol and fusel alcohols noticeable. Overall the flavor was complex. The mouthfeel was warming and smooth with medium-full body and low carbonation. The sweet maltiness lingered on the palate pleasantly. This was a very nice beer and was quite drinkable for its strength."
"Drinkability This as a very nice warming beer for the winter but its not what I would expect from a doppelbock. It is a wonderful bier that has done very well with age. There is no one flavor that overpowers any other flavors, it just adds layer on layer of flavors."
"Drinkability/notes: Absolutely excellent, a superb apertif or after dinner drink. Do not miss the opportunity to sample this spectacular beer."
"I've had quite a few big beers, and I'm reluctant to admit I had a hard time getting a grip on Samichlaus. It will take repeated samplings on a regular basis, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make."
"not a huge fan. it was too much of mostly everything. i could see that this might benefit from aging, so perhaps i will do an experiement"
"This is a hefty beer. It warms you up like liquor. Must be drank slowly to be appreciated. Has a great taste a creamy mouthfeel to it. Highly recommended."
"Hurlimann made this brew in 250 ml bottles and i can really see why :) taste is great and powerful, a very, very good brew to just sit and sip at for an hour or so. I have some 2002 bottles left ill store and some from 2003 that ill bring out next year :)"
"Samichlaus is an Emporer amoung beers. Rare and hard to come by, it is important to pick some up if you see it. As the self proclaimed ""Rarest beer in the world", one expects an expert presentation and it does not dissapoint. The color is rich and smell is exceptional. The taste is likewise impressive being an interesting blend of malt, sweetness, creamy full bodied goodness, and a hard kick from the high alcoholic content which brings it all into line. It is a real pleasure to drink, well worth the wait, effort, and money that goes into purchasing it. Above all, this beer begs to be shared. The experience of sharing a few bottles of such a rare and wonderful beer is half the pleasure of drinking it. Enjoy and make the most of it, treasure every sip and memorize every flavor."
"orangish red, with ruby hues gimmering in and out. white head, typical nothing great nothing bad. smells of toffee, peanut butter, cherries, adn typical double bock smell. taste is also that typical double bock taste of toffee, but with a hint of cherries, and plum, and alcohol. alcohol taste seems somewhat unbalanced but nothing horrible. i can see why some people rate this real bad, that typical ock tatse is to the extreme with a slight cardboard taste, but i like it, the fruit notes really bring it together. a little thin in the mouth. but the odd taste does take away from the drinkability. soemthig i am glad i tryed but don't know if i will drink again."
" Over the course of the holidays, I managed to down eight bottles. The rest will be cellared utill the snow is flying again next winter. I've read that this gets better with age, and I've got faith in the Europeon brewers. We'll just have to see. Maybe the sugar will die off a bit. In retrospect I'm not sorry I bought this. But to this BA, an Old School for a belly warmer, or a Salvator when you'd like three or four, would be a much better choice."
"Glad I tried it, but it shall never pass my lips again. Didn't even want to finish this."
"The overall experience of this beer was disappointing. While a 14%ABV can be fun, this beer doesn't do enough to hide the 'malt liquor' element and make it a pleasant drinking experience."
"4"
"If you like barleywines and dopplebocks, try Samichlaus. And get it on-tap if you can!"
"A rich and thick amber color, with a small shy white head, that resided to the glass walls. An intense smell of caramel and sugar. Taste is caramelic, very sweet, the alcohol presence is very present. Some aromas of sweetness and sugar, it hits you right away, the presence is there. I agree with the other reviews saying it a one sipping beer, many aromas are present, reminds me of some alcohol like whiskey or brandy."
"The smell is a small step away from perfection, being extremely strong yet very appealing. The flavors are huge consist of sweet malts, alcohol, and almost a hint of assorted fruits. There's no shortage of body, either."
"Color is very much like bourbon or whiskey. Copper-hued with a minute splash of head that was gone in an instant. Aromas are hot and heavy with alcohol sweetness. Notes of rum-soaked dark fruit at the edges. Same goes for the flavor. A huge splash of sugary sweetness up front that is quickly ravaged by the scorching alcohol fire that threatens to burn your tongue. Residual sweetness lingers after the ABV dies down. Not nearly as full-bodied as I'd expected and it really struck me as almost unbalanced. Tough to work my way to the bottom of this glass. Maybe I'm missing something with this beer, but it just didn't do anything for me. The waiter said this was the sweetest beer he'd ever tasted. For me, it's close. It's right behind the initial release of DFH 120 minute IPA at the AOBF last year. I have a bottle from 2002 that I won't be touching for years..."
"Medium tan color, off white bubbly head which fades into nothingness almost instantly. Smell is over the top with alcohol and raisins. Taste is reminiscent of wine. Somewhat of a biscuit sweetness, bordering, if not slightly crossing, into cloying. Full slick mouthfeel with a lot of alcohol burn on the way down. A Quadruplebock, if I had to coin a style. Worth $5 a bottle? This time, but probably never again."
"pours a spectacular amber, with a small head of bubbles that disappear quickly. The smell of this beer is crazy I smell sweetness and a hint of alcohol, but mostly just sweetness. The taste is all caramel and alcohol. The sweetness hides the alcohol fairly well in this instance, I am suprised. This beer is reminiscent of the DFH extreme beers for me, as I have tried them first, this does a better job of hiding the alcohol. A class A brew, just one that could not be drank in quantity"
"Pours a brilliant deep copper with a thin head that is gone quite quickly this badboy seems to be more carbonated than expected,whoo the alcohol is very prevelant in the aroma almost whisky-ish along with some raisin and dried fruit.With this being a 2003 bottle this needed more time to mellow I think before opening,big and chewey with huge alcohol tones.Pretty darn sweet but it doesnt coat the mouth,has a nice mouthfeel not to thick but it may be hard just to finish this one I have.Like I said this beer could stand to age another year but no doubt this is a badass mofo beer, will get again and hold for awhile."
"(Bottled 2003). Deep golden colour, moderate head. Aroma of sugary alcohol and hay. Grossly over-hyped and over-rated beer, mostly by people obviously fascinated by the high ABV. Sorry, I have difficulties respecting the ratings of people who actually LIKE this crap. Flavour is cloyingly & revoltingly sweet, alcohol, molasses, syrup, syrup and more syrup. And alcohol. Did I mention syrup? And alcohol? This is gross. This is REALLY gross. Half of it went down the drain. And I paid nearly US$10 (in Norway) for this bottle! (Sob!) Cellaring it for 30 years might have helped A LITTLE, but why cellar crap? A real drainpour, if I ever saw one. Thank God I drank it in November - ""Samichlaus"" would have ruined my Christmas completely."
"Tastes of sour fruit, black currant, cherries and crushed sweet apples. Nutty maltiness. Light alcohol but incredibly smooth for 14%! Roasted maple syrup and pine sap are evident as it warms. Huge in the mouth. Really sticky. Sips like a fine port. Not that drinkable but nice for what it is. An incredible beer. Will get more to age although it's pretty good straight from the store. A must try if you want to know what beer is capable of being."
"The beer pours an amber color with a spotty white lace head that quickly dissapates to nothing. The aroma is awesome. It has a very warm, malty scent that boasts of many crystal malts and lots of alcohol; very complex. The taste is exceptional. It has an incredibly smooth malty flavor for the abv. . It goes down easy and finishes warm and sweet; very tastey. This is a sipping beer, but it has a large, complex taste. The mouthfeel is awesome. For a high gravity beer it has an adequate amount of carbonation and a rich, full body. This is a great beer. It has exceptional flavor and mouthfeel; a kick ass brew."
"I am going to stock a few of these away and see what happens in a few years."
"Notes: Man this is good. Just freakin wonderful."
"The beer it self has a nice dark coppery color and the smell is of strong malt sweetness and other festive adjucnts: raisins/prunes, muted hops, and several types of sugars I'm sure. It is good @ about 55-60F not too cold or some of the flavors will stay hidden. The first taste is highly sweet and alcoholic but once you are expecting it the second taste is where you can keep it in your mouth finding all the different tastes of molasses and malt and the fruity tones. It has a decent after taste that is much like the beer and it goes well when eating some sweet chocolate confection."
"This brew tastes like a well aged Barleywine, and it's less than a year old. Pretty cool !"
"A sipper for sure, I think I'll wait until the dead of winter to crack open another one of these bellywarmers."
"Wow finally the great Samichlaus has come to pay me a visit. I was eager to give this one a shot. Pours a nice copper with a light head that dissapears quickly and then this beer just sits there cleara and calm as it can be. The smell is enough to get a beer lover excited, that barleywine big beer big malt smell with raisins, figs cloves and all sorts of good things. Then the first taste knocks you for a loop as it is big and sweet. The taste is of big malt with a molassas and toffee fig flavor. You can really taste the alcohol in this big boy. The mouthfeel has to be one of the biggest I have had in a while. Drinkability is questionable, I could Drink another but I don't think I am ready to call it a day yet."
"A classic ""bier"" if there ever was, I've been able to sample a variety of vintage bottles, always pleasing but never one I'm dying to drink again. I love a malty, big beer, but its a bit sweet and not as complex as comparable beers."
"This is something else, but being something else it should be savored, and enjoyed slowly on special occassions."
"This beer pours a golden amber color. The nose is high in alcohol. There is a good malt behind it, but it is highly obscured with the alcohol. There is a bit if fig in there. Wow. This beer makes my face do cartwheels. The second taste is a bit better. The flavor is sweet and molasses. This is a thick beer. I don't know where this falls in the style, but after the initial taste, this is a pretty decent beer. This is thick and syrupy. I think that one of these would do me, but I think I want to get another and let it sit for a few years and see where that gets me."
"Beer is good. Happy strong beering."
"It pours a dark amber with a slight cream colored head. Smells of dark dried fruits, plums, figs. Tastes of the same dark dried fruits, some dark chocolate flavors, brown sugar and earthy flavors. More flavor than sweetness unlike the Belgian candied beers. A warming alcohol presence. A very heavy mouthfeel, almost like wax coating your throat. If it wasn't for the thick mouthfeel I would like this beer a bit more. Certainly a sipper. This beer holds well over the years and starts to mellow/blend its flavors. I've heard this is best drank 2 years after the date on the bottle."
"2002 vintage - bottle: Poured a clear light brown colored beer with a medium head with almost no retention. Aroma is reminiscent of plums with a touch of alcohol. Taste is quite sweet with again the plum taste being quite evident. Alcohol is quite subtle but still noticeable, which is quite good for a 14% beer. Overall, this is very enjoyable and can see some similarities with a good barley wine."
"Way high alcohol and it smelled it. 2003 edition and in an ideal world it would have waited closer to its 2008 expiry date. Like a 100 proof. This is the Austria brewed under license and no longer the original and not all that complex. Orange-amber-yellow appearance with some lace. Some syrupy fruit mid-sip."
"Drinkability: Whoa. It's nice, but I can't imagine ever drinking more than one of these. It might even be better to split one with someone else, as an entire bottle gets to be a bit much."
"Poured a brownish red color with no head. It smells doughy and a little fruit sweetness. The taste of sweet sweet alcohol is strong. There is a hint of some spice and some burtness, but mainly flavors of sugar and maple syrup. This proved to be a little more than a sipping beer, something I would have 1 or 2 of a night. The mouthfeel is slick and oily. overall not too bad, but nothing too special."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep deep ruby red with one finger of head that quickly dies to a small collar. There is no lacing left over. The smell is potent! Rich and malty, with lots of plums and grapes topped on caramel malts. A fairly strong dose of alcohol sure wakes your ass up too. Its almost got the smell of a strong scotch ale or wee heavy. The taste is also way over on the malty side. Those dark fruits really shining through again, just not as much as in the smell. A bit too much alcohol on the finish. By how it's pasked, you'd think this was plum schnapps. The mouthfeel is very thick and strong, heavy on the tongue. The drinkability suffers some due to the strong strong alcohol content and taste. It'll sure put your ass to sleep!"
"It's ""drinkability"" is good, assuming you are sipping it. Samichlaus bears little resemblence to what most people think of as beer. It's more alcoholic by far than most beers and is even more boozy than many big, red wines. (In fact, you catch quite a bit of the raison/plum notes you might find in a fruity wine in this beer.) A great beer to sip and slowly savor on a cold winter's night (which I should have saved it for rather than drinking it now in July)."
"A beer that must be experienced. I am glad that it was not allowed to die off... if you find it, try it. You'll be glad you did. I saved mine to celebrate the 2004 NCAA Women's Basketball game, and it was a perfect match. Not a beer to drink every night, but great for special occasions."
"Drinkability: For such a big beer this goes down pretty easily. You can def tell its a strong beer, but the fruit tones and heat from the alcohol help to hide any harshness."
"Glass at The Bier Garden in Portsmouth, VA. This is only the second time I have ever seen Samichlaus on tap. Till we meet again!"
"Malty caramel alcohol aroma. Small off-white head fades to a thin film. Deep golden colored beer with a ruby hue. Slick, sweet caramel, a bit of vanilla, with a warming alcoholic finish. A big, sweet, smooth beer reminds me of Winter Solistice's big brother."
"Syrupy and thick in the mouth, but very smooth and gentle. Little in terms of carbonation which lets all that sweetness come out strong. I'd like to have one of these each year, and definately try to age a few as well. Takes some time to fully enjoy, but it does grow on you."
"Warms the stomach--but I wouldn't have another."
"Overall: This is a beer like no other. At 14% ABV, use extreme caution and care - this beer will kick the shit out of you if not respected. Drinking any more than two of these in a sitting is almost suicidal. This is a beer that is to be sipped and appreciated, much like a fine whiskey."
"wow. too much of a good thing is still too much and while I admire this beer's strength, tonight I'm wishing it came in 8oz bottles. definitely a sipping beer, and to be honest, after a few sips, the novelty has worn thin..."
"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, a minimal 1/8"" inch formed, which quickly receded to a slight layer of foam over the syrupy dark copper brew. Upon swirling, reasonable lacing occurs on the sides of the glass. The aroma is overwhelming alcohol, with a sort of sickly sweet lean to it, as you would expect from a 14% product. Taste is all about malts and the resultant alcohol, which warms the tongue and even burns a bit on the way down the hatch. Just seems too strong for the Dopplebock category, in my mind, leaning more towards the Sam Adams Triple Bock arena. As warming occurs the brew becomes even sweeter, almost too a fault. This brew certainly has its place, just not in my drinking itinerary very often, I'm afraid..."
"This beer is all hype. 1 of the most overrated!!"
"This beer in no way resembles the one brewed formerly by Hurlimanns which posessed much more depth and balance and was a pleasure to sip as a nightcap. I RARELY dump beer down the drain but I certainly wasn't going to get sick drinking this one."
"Because of this beer's high abv, it is important to taste it at a cellar temperature."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipping beer."
"With the cherry and grape highlights, you don't necessarily have to love malt to like this, but if you do love malt, you're going to love this as well. The flavor is thick and sweet, but bright and never cloying. Even with that Olympian ABV tossing thunderbolts from the heavens, its rich toasty character draws you in and makes drinking it a smooth and warming pleasure. So now I know, it's more than just a cool name, it's a bold and earthy malted experience."
"This brew has a sophisticated taste, yet busts you in the mouth with a brandy-drenched glove. I have to reach out to find some of the other flavors here besides alcohol, but they're there, just subtle. I like this beer a lot because it challenges my tastebuds. One thing I doubt I need to say here but I'll say anyway....THIS IS DEFINATELY A SIPPER."
"This feels very thick in the mouth with a heavy alcohol kick on the backside. The only drawback for me is a sweetness that overwhelms by the time you get to the bottom of the bottle. This is a sipping beer not one that reaches the drinkability in me."
"This beer packs a wallop. The taste is extremely rich and potent. I had a 7oz glass on tap, and that was enough. I enjoyed it, but there's only so much you can take. The heavy malt and alcohol taste makes this a sipping beer. There aren't many other flavors, or perhaps the alcohol buries them. This only comes around once a year for a few weeks, and it would make a nice brew to have on a cold winter evening. It would be a substitute for a brandy (if I drank brandy). Overall, though, it's too tough to get down for regular drinking."
"The mouthfeel is syrupy, as the malt thickly coats your tongue even after swallowing. Very thick bodied. I battled with giving this a 3 on the drinkability scale, but the complex flavors gave it another 1/2 point. Very unique and worth trying at least one in your lifetime."
"2001 bottling sampled. Almost a maple syrup color with reddish hues, it has a smallish tan head that eventually disappears virtually altogether. The aroma is of chocolate, alcohol, and cough syrup. A tingly carbonation accompanies the sticky thick mouthfeel with a candy sweetness and faint alcohol aftertaste. More of a desert treat than a session beer, it would be great sitting by a warm fire in the middle of a blizzard."
"Only 5 X 5 beer I have ever tasted!"
"2002 vintage here. Pours a clear, mahogany with ruby highlights. Head lasts 5 seconds and disappears, leaving no lacing behind. Aroma is incredibly complex. Rum soaked plums and peaches, toffee, molasses, and sherry. Also, some earthiness is apparent. Many additional aromas float in and out, but the alcohol presence makes up most of the background. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, chewy in a way, and warming alcohol is hard to miss. Taste is as complex as the nose. All kinds of fruits that have been dipped in a bucket of sherry, molasses, vinous notes akin to a good sherry, and some black pepper spiciness, all weave in and out of the flavor profile which is dominated by a big alcohol oomph. Actually, the big alcohol is craftily concealed in the taste and is much more apparent in the esophagus and below. This is truly a doppelbock on steroids. Definitely a slow sipping brew that is perfect as a nightcap(I went to sleep shortly after finishing this one). Plenty of complexities here. I would really enjoy sampling an older vintage to see how these age."
"A darker shade of tanned brown here...no head at all. A super malty aroma...basically malts and alcohol is it. It just tells you right away to be careful. Alcohol dominates the flavor. Well I kind of say that, but it's so syrupy and malty as well. It's not like a shot of liquor, so much better than that. It's actually more drinkable that I expected. The malts are very sugary sweet and chewy. It really makes this an enjoyable beer for having such strength. If you don't mind alcohol playing a huge part in the flavor of a beer, than this is one sweet ass brew!"
"2001 version: Red/Orange beer with a VERY sweet bouquet that can't quite hide alcohol content. The taste is very strong in alcohol, I didnt expect it to be well hidden like in many trappists ales, but here it really seems like we have liqueur-like alcohol sticking to candy, syrup, wood. I don't understand most people's passion about this beer or it wasn't old enough, too sweet."
"-Oelergud"
"Mild peppery finish. Alcohol driven for sure. Intense. But considering the strength and lack of carbonation, this is surprisingly drinkable."
"Just a little sweet for my tastes, but this is a pretty amazing beer. Tames some with temperature."
"Whoa Nellie what a beer! A transparent deep garnet color on the pour, minimal head, minimal lace, maximal nose, the fusel alcohol just slaps your senses to the upright and locked position, ripe pineapple, bananas, bubble gum, sweet malt, its all there for the sniffing, start is sweet and nicely malted, the top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is all about alcohol, which at 14% makes it strong, a couple of years in the barrel, gives it a deep dark robustness thats certainly not meant for the weak of heart or those not into dark brooding beers, should just stay away, carbonation quite mild, very dry, vinous aftertaste, that lingers on for quite sometime as does the significant tummy warming, excellent is all I can say."
"Bottled in 2001 - Color is a dark coppery ruby red, somewhat clear but with a resonant glow, thin beige head puffs away like smoke but keeps a tight collar the whole glass and slow dripping lace in rings from off the collared edge. Aroma is nice and malty, a bit restrained, but befittingly sweet with dark fruityness that has a good load of raisin and plum and touches of molasses and dark cherry. Taste is big time malts, wow, pretty big malts here;darkly sweet, lightly dry, solid amounts of raisin and tinges of warming alcohol blend right in and quickly. Its pretty boozy right from the get go on this stuff, whew...not as complex as some but does have some subtlities once the alcoholic warmth lays off with vanilla and more dark fruits. Its got a very easy slippery start that keeps sliding towards a fuller feel, silky and creamy with some agreeable warmth of good Ol' alcohol. A pretty sneaky brew, nearly port-like with its big and darkly sweet malts with a smoothness thats quite comforting. The alcoholic warmth makes it presense felt. A very good warm sipper. Did I say its warm? Cuz it is...warm...and yummy."
"I might suggest splitting this with someone."
"This beer was bottled in 2002. It has a cloudy, dark amber color with a short-lived head. There is a complex aroma consisting of caramel, spices, fruit essences and alcohol. It has a stong alcohol taste meshed with sweetness, caramel, and fruit (figs and others). It has a sweet, oily slightly dry finish. This is a smooth beer with some bite to it in more ways than one. Be wary of its high alcohol content, it does more than warm your stomach."
"Drinkability: Doppelbock on steroids. Too strong for a session, but this is one hell of a beer to be re-sampled again and again."
"Very clear copper-gold with a nice white head, not too much retention. Aroma is largely alcohol, but with accompanying raisins and caramels. Taste is amazingly clean and smooth, a nice range of malt and alcohol flavors. Rummy, munich malty, dark fruits. Body is pretty thin, but slick. Amazingly drinkable for the level of alcohol. A wonderful, potent brew that is perfect to sip on a cold night."
"I was just imagining how incredible this would be if it was lightly aged in oak, wow that would be good. While not as complex as the Hurlimann version, it is much more drinkable, softer and I enjoy this just a bit more. I don't know that it is better though."
"Pours a deep chestnut-brown color with a thin tan head. Smells sugary and brandy sweet with the faintest bit of oaky notes and a whole lotta alcohol as everyone knows. Sipping this beer makes one's lips stick together after sipping. Carbonated cough syrup is an adequate description. Beautiful, though. Poured in an authentic 25 cl Samichlaus snifter. Takes an hour + to drink. We won't touch on the drinkability. Mouthfeel is again, syrupy, yet complex. I prefer it on-draught because the oakiness just doesn't seem present on the bottled version."
"Alcohol sets up this beer. Heavy burning. Very unflavorful. This beer has no back bone. No willing to compromise. Mouthfeel is unsettling and it is just overall a bit harsh and ragged."
"I wish I would be patient enough. Aging this one would only make it better. Don't pass it up if you see it. Not always around."
"Drinkability: *insert standard disclaimer about not having more than one in a sitting* That said, I'll definitely pick this one up when it comes out this year. Cain't wait for a vertical tasting that's coming up in the DC area."
"I could not help myself when I saw this beer at the store the other day. Just reading the info on the back plus all the good things I heard about it justified paying $4.50 for a bottle! It pourd a dark brown color with just a very small off white head. The smell of plums and raisons jumped out at me as well as a hint of alchohol. The taste was heavenly with a great malt profile, toasty nut flavor, raisons and a excelent warming effect from the alchohol. This was a great beer and I will be going back to pick up more to consume and age."
"If there's any complaints against this one, it would have to be that there is definately a heavy alcohol aftertaste, but there's enough other flavors in here that it just blends in, one flavor with all the rest. A wonderful brew."
"Update - I had a cause to celebrate in Feb 2008 and busted open a two year old bottle and man oh man was this totally awesome. It had developed a bigger alcohol sting and was sweeter than a fresh sample, but the sweet flavors just exploded in the mouth. This has to be one of my favorite beers of all time, and although skyhand didn't provide this offering she indirectly deserves a thanks for me opening it (wink wink)."
"Vintage 2001 is absolutely in fantastic nick! It has a very concentrated brandyish aroma. Some moderately burnt molasses. It tastes like a rich tawny port. Rich creamy texture. Yes, it is a sweet beer with vanilla flavors from oak but astonishingly it is not cloying at all. A classic!"
"The taste is reminiscent of a tawny port, with lots of oak, fig, and spice. Incredible! I'll be keeping a few of these in my cellar... they make the perfect winter warmer before bedtime or next to the fire."
"Overall Impression: Long memories of deep, dark, merry malt. Santa drinks this beer, as do a number of Saints. If Im really good, when I die, I get to be reincarnated as a bottle of Samichlaus that is never opened. While this beer is pure heaven, it's such a meal that I have to take a half point for drinkability, couldn't experience this joy for very long before you were over-satisfied. Buy on sight, all of it."
"Samichlaus really seems to be a nightcap sort of a beer, but its still a little harsh at this young age (although I have nothing to compare to right now). I didnt have any problem finishing this one, but it was certainly a drink for sipping, and I dont think I could drink more then one. While this may always be the case, I can really see this beer improving over the years when everything mellows a little bit."
"Pours a gorgeous dark amber with a little white head. The aroma is sweet malty and then BAM, alcohol. taste is intriguing but great. It starts with apples and pears and then the alcohol takes over but the finish is back with pears. The alcohol warms nicely and makes for a fantastic fall brew. This could probably sit in the cellar for another year though to mellow out a bit. The drinkablity is hurt by the alcohol content, but it is definitely worth trying. A very tasty and interesting brew"
"Drinkability is low. Gimme another, when I am 40."
"Garnet color, small head. Aroma is molasses, malt, sweetness and alcohol. Very malty and thick, nearly syrupy. Taste is sweet and sherry like, yet there is a very definite hoppyness to this beer. Complex flavors, chocolate, raisins, cherries, woody and smoke. The 14% alcohol is not as noticeable as one would think. It is there, but its not as much of a kick in the teeth as one would think; tummy warming more that the throat burner. Think the 2000 vintage still need a lot of bottle aging, the alcohol and woodiness should improve the taste of this already tasty beer. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty and sweet with a sharp alcohol bite"
"Well finally, the legendary Santa! A doppelbock with a (couple) of shots in it! I can taste the malts down in there (certainly a better tasting beer than EKU or Belzebuth). However, as expected, alcohol leads the way. Boozy, warming, and strong. Pours a deep amber, clear, very little head (which is scared away quickly). I was under the weather the last few days, and decided to try this for some medicine. It worked! It settled my stomach (and brain). I can't imagine anyone drinking two of these in the same session. I will pick up more of this to keep around for appropriate occasions, but certainly not a beer for consistent consumption. Good for what ails you, though!"
"Pours out a velvety reddish brown. Head dissapears almost immediately. Not all that much appreciable carbonation. Smell is sweet, with a hint of cherry. Taste is amazing, dominated by a port wine sweetness and cherry overtones with a malty backbone that wraps it all together. Each sip was a sublime pleasure. That big malty mouthfeel with the alcohol overtone finished this delightful elixir off. Truly one of the best beers in the world, especially so for a malt lover like me. Highly recommended.."
"Notes: Would be great with desert. Or by itself after dinner. At 14%abv it's a monster of a beer. Worth a trip. Probably as good as it gets for it's style."
"2001 bottling - Pours a deep copper color with minimal head. Aroma is very much like a young port wine, with strong fruity notes. The taste is powerfully sweet. Nice smoky malt notes with a slight oak character, dark fruits like plums and raisins, a very strong alcohol note. A slight hint of chocolate sneaks through as well. Much like a light port, but with some bourbon qualities as well. The alcohol warms your throat as you swallow, and I can already picture having some of this during the cold winter months. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, and lingers on the tongue a good while. The aftertaste is definitely dominated by alcohol fumes wrapped around some sweet fruits. Very little bitterness in this beer. This is definitely young and powerful right now, and I'd love to have the resources (and the patience) to put a lot of this away for future enjoyment. We'll see how things go. I have one more bottle that I will revisit this winter at the earliest. Right now, this is very enjoyable. If it mellows a bit, it could be outstanding."
"This brew poured a small head of fine light brown bubbles that quickly disappeared leaving no lacing. It has a transparent dark brown body and a strong aroma of alcohol and malt. I tasted the alcohol in this beer which was very strong as well a burnt smoke flavor that was initially very strong but soon faded. This brew will get you wasted very fast. Drink with caution it is potent stuff!"
"The aroma tells me this is straight brandy. As does the first taste. Very strong alcohol flavors hit my senses. This needs to be sipped extremely slowly. I feel a warming sensation throughout my whole body only seconds after the initial taste. This bier has a syruppy texture that goes well with the spicy brandy flavor. I also detect some plums in the bier with slight hop bitterness midway through. Finishes with a somewhat spicy dryness like a brandy would. Is this a brandy, at least a Very Good brandy? I'm not sure. I do know that I can drink this if my heating ever goes out in the winter time. I think that I'm drunk after only one bottle!"
"""you'd better not pout, I'm telling you why.......Samichlaus is coming to town"". I had definitely been looking forward to this beer, and was willing to pay over 8 dollars to try it, when I came across a 12-pack for $12.99. It certainly was an ""extraordinary"" beer, and one I'd love to have another bottle of when the holiday season comes........but I'd probably never session with it!"
"Vintage 2001. Poured clear dark reddish brown with a reddish tan head that fizzled very quickly. The smell is very strong, of caramel, malt and alcohol. The mouthfeel is heavy, sweet and smooth. The taste is very pronounced: malt, caramel and alcohol. It is rather like a port. The finish and aftertaste are pure malt and alcohol. I could detect no hops buried under the big flavors. This is an important beer, but I really wouldn't want to call it drinkable (certainly not quaffable). I wanted to give ""drinkability"" a 3.0, but there is nothing average about this beer!"
"Drinkability: This a slow sipping beer for sure. A few years of aging to soften the rough & complex edges would make this beer a pure treat."
"2001 Edition: This beer poured a dark amber color and formed a small bubbly white head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, caramel and alcohol. A flavor of malt, caramel, alcohol and touch of raisins and other dark fruits. This beer has a strong powerful finish and is definately meant as a sipping after dinner type of beer. Too bad I still can't get it in my state even with the new laws."
"Well, its all its cracked up to be. Liquor lovers, line up!! I typically abhor liquor (too alcoholic), but this is an astounding brewing accomplishment, though not a beer Id buy more often than annually: its an experience, not an addiction"
"Samichlaus poured a beautiful ruby red, yet had no head. It had nice malty/honey/syruppy-like taste. The flavors are very enjoyable. The carbonation is quite minimal. There's lots of complexity in this beer and w/ a 14% ABV, take your time enjoying it. ;-)"
"One of my favorite liqueurs or sherries."
"Bottled in 2001. This brew poured a small head that quickly dissolved. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass. I could see the carbonation rising to the top. It had a malty aroma. It had a sweet flavor to it. I definitely could taste the alcohol in this brew. It had a syrupy and chewy taste to it in my opinion. It had a burning sensation as it went down. This is definitely a sipping beer due to the alcohol content."
"Pours a dark copper color with a foamy white head that leaves sheets of lace on the walls of the glass as it recedes. Nose is sweet and fruity alcohol with some strong pungent notes similar to a bag of dried fish food. Full bodied and a bit thick and syrupy in texture. Taste is very complex, similar to a small-batch bourbon. Starts off with notes of sweet alcohol soaked raisins followed by some charred oak flavors. The taste then turns a bit winey with notes of vanilla extract and caramelized sugars. The strongest lager in the worldsip slowly and enjoy. Purchased from Liquid Solutions."
"Clear, coppery/bronze/amber hue, no head not even a stray bubble, still looks good in a glass, no lace either. Strong nose, rich, sweet, alcoholic bouquet, caramely, fruity needless to say, it is complex! The palate is multifaceted and powerful; it is mostly sweet, alcoholic, caramely, fruity, molasses hints too nicely done. The finish is surprisingly dry the alcohol lingers on the palate and on the mind. The body is on the thin side of medium. Smooth mouthfeel. This is a sipping brew, for sure (!), yet highly drinkable a remarkable accomplishment. Recommended."
"What little head the beer initially had rapidly diappeared. There was very little carbonation. Considering that this is an Austrian brew, these attributes seem out of character. However, I can see that higher carbonation could negatively impact the drinkability of such a stong brew. Otherwise the appearance was nice: clear, dark and appealing red color. I immediately noticed the aroma: very strong, much like that of a dopplebock with the volume turned up. The alcohol was apparent even in the aroma. The strength of this, however, effectively masked any other subtleties there might have been to the aroma. The immediate aspects of the taste I noticed were the sweetness and the alcohol. Note that I say sweetness, not maltiness; this is a pronounced sweetness without a complex backing. It's much like flat root beer in this respect. The alcohol lurks a little while, then strikes, and it strikes hard. It wasn't until after a few drinks that I felt the wamth in my chest, but then it was a juggernaut, breaking down my sobriety and composure. The strenght of the alcohol flavor, combined with the simple sweetness, made this a rather unpleasant drinking experience for me. Barleywines and imperial stouts- both strong, though not comprable with the likes of this and Beelzebuth- provide intersting body and hopping to go along with the strength; this is an experience I prefer. Hence, I suppose I am more critical of the style than of the actual beer."
"The Dec 6th bottling date caught my attention. The taste did the rest. It had a color like a nice dark sherry or wine. I could smell the alcohol, thus fearing what was coming next. I was surprised. After the initial shock of the alcohol, it mellowed like a good cognac. The taste was esquiset, good malt, and many good ""cognac"" type tastes. I almost wished I was smoking a cigar as I savored this beer. Too bad I discovered it in the spring, because I think this is the perfect ""fire side"" beverage."
"A huge, simmering alcoholic beer. I am amazed that something that looks like brown colored water could be so rich, chewy, and magnificent."
"Perhaps it was too early to drink, and I'd have better luck with a properly vintage bottling."
"I could really grow to like this with time. The first taste is just a bit strong, that's all."
"Brilliantly clear, ruby-brown color. Has no head, just a ring around the glass. The aroma is bready, alcoholic, with figs and dates. The flavor is of sweet malt, fruit, figs or dates; it flows then to an alcoholic finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and sweet. It is syrupy, with a somewhat oily texture. It is very alcoholic and warming beer. A definite nightcap beer on a cold winters night. Very complex and tasty."
"Whew! What can I say about a beer that makes you sweat? Yup, happened to me.. One powerful rocket-ship fuel brew here.. Of the world's super-strong lagers, Samichlaus has to be the most complex and satisfying. It had a red-chestnut color; a brandy-like aroma; a firm, oily, body; creamy and cherryish flavor; and a warming, spicy, peppery, finish. AND THIS IS THE BREW THAT MADE ME SWEAT!!!"
"a little too alcoholic in the finish for a higher score."
"Big Alcohol nose with tons of intense sweet fruit. Slight white head. Almost light brown with a touch of red in the color. Served in a wine glass. Sweet fruit (sour peach) taste with an intense tongue numbing finish. Fuller smooth mouth with a syrup film left on the tongue. Rounded fruit taste is pounded by the big ABV finish. Not one for the timid. Any more of this beer would probly be too much. Its drinkability is hurt by the sweetness and unbridled strength. It will make you smile as a night cap! ;)"
"2000 Vintage. What a wonderful beer. I opened this up sitting by the fire after dinner. The last time I tried this beer was in 1994, and my tastes were not developed back then. This is a unique experience. The color was the least impressive- just coppery- brown with no head at all. Aromas of dried fruits and port like/ brandy like as well. This beer is all about the taste. It's almost hard to describe- sweet, yet very smooth, the beer rolls to the back of your mouth releasing a warm gush of alcohol. More dried fruit flavors- raisins, prunes. This is one potent beer and it does not try to mask this. I had a vintage 2000 and I could tell that the smooth and creamy texture is a result of age. The sweetness of the beer is balanced by the alcohol, so you can only sip this beer slowly and enjoy."
"Pours a clear tea-like color with a small off-white head. The smell is strongly dominated by alcohol and also includes fruity esters. The taste consists of more alcohol with a raison-like sweetness with more fruit and a mild hopping. It has an incredibly creamy mouthfeel and is definitely a sipping beer. It goes great with cold weather as it has a definite warming feeling. Although I like the look, the smell, and the taste, drinkability is not there. It is just too rich to want another. Thanks to Beerluvr for the opportunity to sample this brew! Prosit!"
"The World's Most Extraordinary Beer Well, let's see if this beer lives up to it. It pours a very deep ruby amber brown hue, with little or practically no head ( probably due to the 14% by volume). Aroma contains hints of caramel, or toffee along with some mild fruit aroma possibly figs. Taste is very astringent with alcohol, and it tends to mellow with flavors of a fruity sweetness from the malt. The body of this beer sits at the consistency of a light syrup. I believe it helps carry the flavor and aroma very well. Definitely a complex selection, and for my first beer from Austria I am very impressed. Overall, this is no session beer, however I find it pretty drinkable and enjoyable. Not a beer I would push upon everyone, but this is a beer that does deserve to be sampled very rich in taste and brings much warmth to the body. This one was bottled in 2001."
"For what it is supposed to be it is outstanding..a powerhouse of flavor...kind of a souped up doppelbock..defintely a sipping beer...tasted heavy molassis, maple, brown sugar...grapes...fruity....very sweet...alcohol taste evident...This is definitely a one-beer sipping beer....quite a treat courtesy of my brother.."
"The taste was of caramel/fruit and alcohol. At 14%, it really gives you kick in your mouth and on your palate. Also, the taste was not as alcoholic as you would think though. The balance of sweetness and bitterness is well balanced."
"2000 vintage. Ruby in color with no head. Quite viscous and leaves good fingers on the glass when swirled. Aroma is figgy with lots of dark fruit scents, and a bit of roasty maltiness. Flavor is big on malt, with a somewhat granular sugar characteristic which I find to be typical of Eggenberg's beers. Caramel malts big up front with mild fruit notes coming out mid-palate, and a crisp, toffee-like finish. Signficant and pleasant alcohol warming and a good hop bitterness which asserts itself as the beer warms. Full-bodied with a dry-finish -- a beer for sipping and respecting! Great winter warmer."
"This poured with a rapidly subsiding light tan head, over sparkling clear light reddish gently carbonated liquid. Intense maltiness in the nose, followed by...more maltiness! Taste is ultra-malty sweetness, a brandyish mouthfeel, hot alcohol burn going down the throat. Finish is sugary sweet as well. I'd like to keep this in the cellar for year or more...it's just too sweet to really enjoy right now."
"Wow is this one a real kick you in the ass kind of beer. Poured a dark black in color with some ruby red hues. Head was nowhere to be seen, most likely eaten by the alcohol demons. Fruit, spices, and liqurous were percieved as well as the smell of evaporating alcohol. Flavor profile was amazingly complex though balanced a lot towards the sweet side of things. Pears, liqourice, raisins, and a port-iness were perceived in the mouth. Perceived alocohol is not at all what this beer is about, but it makes it's presence known from the first sip with a nice warming feeling. This one is definitely a sipping beer. A very intriguing brew that I would recommend people try, but I don't know if I would order it again."
"The lack of carbonation hurts it a bit in the mouthfeel, as it becomes a bit ponderous. That, along with the very high alcohol hurt the drinkability. All total an impressive, and unique beer. I appreciate the experience."
"Bottled in 2001. Clear dark amber with a light tan head after a semi-hard pour. Aroma consisted of spices, malt, raisins, caramel and alcohol. Taste is strong and reminded me a lot of a brandy or sherry. Flavors meld into that of malt, raisin, smokey oak and alcohol. Mouthfeel is rich and coats the tongue. Alcohol warms the back of the throat and stomach as it goes down. This is most definitely a sipping beer. Downgraded the drinkability a little because it would be overkill to drink more than one of these in an evening. Samichlaus is a rare treat and should be enjoyed as such. I look forward to cellaring the rest of my 4-pack and see what happens to the flavors in years to come."
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable, for what it is. You have to remember that this is 14%abv, so it's something to end the night with and enjoy slowly. Good stuff."
"I have 3 more bottles, maybe I'll re-vist this one, but they are on the trading block. Didn't enjoy this one, as much as others."
"One big beer. I can smell the strong scent of alcohol and the ensuing damage that this may cause several feet away. The taste of this beer agrees with what the nose had forewarned. Great dark carmel color though. At 14% abv, this beer packs a punch that you won't soon forget."
"Simply a wonderful beer....extreme, multi-faceted, and surprisingly drinkable."
"This is no boy-racer Honda Acura with lowered suspension and a throaty muffler, not a V8 Thunderbird with a plastic body kit, nor even a BMW with an M5 sticker on the trunk; it is not even an Aston Martin. Its much better  this is pure thoroughbred pedigree Formula One. Marvel and enjoy, thats if you can handle it; if not, get Michael Schumacher to take you for a spin, but put on some clean underwear and your Seatbelt first!!! I drive a Nissan  and I am not worthy of this beer."
"the taste is wine, alcohol, and raisins. i was not really turned on to this at first, but i gradually grew more and more fond of the brew. i still think the flavoring was a little odd. mouthfeel was excellent, smooth and warming all the way down."
"Rich brownish, orange-red color, like tawny port, and only a bubble or two sitting on top to begin with. Unfortunately, it popped. Stunning liquid coated the glass with every movement of my double old-fashioned glass. Vaporized perfection filled my nose with dark rum, alcohol, and smells I have only encountered before with the fortified wine madeira. Honestly, I cant even begin to go into the flavors. All I can say is it tasted something like a raisin caramelized and a little burnt in butter. It was raisiny, nutty, and a tiny bit like bittersweet chocolate. Very light carbonation. Syrupy and viscous, but not in a bad way. Devine."
"Samichlaus Bier, 2000: Somewhat surprising, as I had anticipated a much darker beer. This is absolutely clear, with no head. The color is a deep reddish tan. No head whatsoever. The aroma is like a fine sipping brandy, with a hint of the malts that drive this beer. Very powerful flavors, with lots of cherries, and chocolate. Think of a dark chocolate covered cherry soaked in brandy, and you are at least part of the way in explaining and understanding this beer. Very powerful after taste, spicy and even a little searing as it goes down Great alcohol warmth, long lasting aftertaste."
"2000 bottling. It's December 6th, so what better beer to drink than Samichlaus? What a marvelous beer. Deep reddish-brown in color. Initial tan head dissipates quickly. Pungent aroma of plums, figs, toffee, and brown bread. Sweet! Taste is magnificent: dark fruits (figs, raisins, dates), toffee, plums, grapes. Sweet but not cloying. Alcohol comes through like a fine whisky: spicy and smooth, but not overpowering. Wow."
"2001 bottling. It's a nice deep ruby with a beige head that comes out of the bottle strong but fades quickly leaving little trace. The smell is malty with a definite ripe fruit aroma. The taste is very complex, with flavors of raisin and bit of spice. The 14% abv makes itself known in the stomach with an almost immediate warming sensation, but neither the smell nor flavor of alcohol is overwhelming. Save this one for a nice cold night and treat it with respect."
"2000 vintage, brown in color, small head, malty- sweet caremel aroma, thick malty and roasty flavors , strong alcohol taste, thick, full bodied surupy mouthfeel. Not bad, high alcohol content, I like this one."
"Wow!  This is a big beer.  I was a little put off by the 14% alchohol rating on the label, but the bartender said that it was special, and he was right.  The 2001 bottle I had poured a sparklingly clear, light brown.  The aroma was complex with lots of malty and fruity elements (plus more than a hint of alchohol).  It wasn't as syrupy as I expected, but was heavy enough to balance the alchohol.  Oh yeah, and did I mention that there's a lot of alchohol in this brew?  This is a sipping beer if there ever was one.  It makes a great after dinner drink.  I'm heading back to the store to buy some to put away and age for a special occaision."
"Tastes better a little warmer.  Not my preference, but A+ for style."
"So you're looking for a rather alcoholic beer? This one's got enough alcohol for you and your neighbors. The 2001 edition pours a clear ruby liquid with an incredibly short-lived head. Some light carbonation is present, even after it warms up. Nose is of alcohol, raisins and assorted fruit. Taste is similar, with alcohol being the key suspect. There are tons of flavors going on here, ranging from warming alcohol, raisins, apricot, figs, sweet malt, etc. This a pretty sweet beer overall. Mouthfeel is a bit carbonated at first for a beer of this size, but turns syrupy as it stands for a while. This is, of course, no easy drinker, but rather a fine sipping treat. Better get your snifter out for this one, especially to release all the characteristics this beer possesses. It's almost too much for me, but certainly worth a try. This 2001 vintage could stand to age a few more years."
"Pours a dark brown with little off white head. Fades quickly and leaves little lace. Alcohol takes over here, aroma and taste. Malt and alcohol mouthfeel and finish. Now comes the good part. Definitely better as it warms. Room temp. finds aroma of a single malt, ala Oban. Great warming finish. My after dinner beer for the rest of the year. Year was 2000."
"I downscored the drinkability because I think it will be more drinkable in a few years."
"A sure bet for a nightcap for me though I’d love to not only pair this up with some braised lamb chops that are cooked with this beer by incorporate it into a dessert also. A godly brew that many may not understand but the appreciation is there tenfold."
"Great sipping stuff.  A keeper"
"I am sure I may stand alone on this one but I absolutely hated this beer! It smelled very rank and tasted even worse. The alcohol level is too high for this beer. It burned as it went down. Very unpleasant. I let my roommate try it and she had the same impression. I hear great reviews but do not understand why. The appearance was the only thing that gave it any points in my book."
"Many months later...2000 Vintage...I had forgotten how wonderful the deep copper color is or how interesting it is to watch the tiny bubbles slowly rise to the surface, as if through oil."
"This is some seriously potent brew right here.  It would fit in great with a nice hearty meal.  Forms a nice off-white lace after the pour but that runs away real fast.  Complex aromas coming off.  The first thing that popped into my head was that it smelled like a barley wine but then that thought got bluggened by all of the sweet, molasses-like, syrupy smells.  The tste is dominated by sweetness.  Very malty, brown sugar, dark fruits, and alcohol.  A thick sweet resin is left in the mouth for a short time.  Due to the high alcohol content and sweetness it would be hard to put down more than 2 or 3 of these.  A little too sweet for my tastes but a very complex beer that should not be overlooked.  I may try to age a few and see where they go."
"Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner would be a great time to enjoy this one. Sorta tastes like a barley wine type. To get the best effect, you have to take slow sips, or this Samichlaus will over power you w/ a number of different tastes, so many you can't pin point. But overall a enjoyable beer. Maybe they over did the abv. a little. I will save mine for Thanksgiving, this time! Cheers."
"This beer was bottled in 2000."
"Notes: Still one of the rarest beers in the world, brewed only once a year on December 6th, subsequently fermented and matured for about 10 months before bottling in October. Samichlaus is a vintage beer and the strongest bottom-fermented lager in the world and may be aged in the bottle for many years to come. Older vintages become more complex with a creamy warming finish. Serve with hardy robust dishes and desserts, particularly with chocolates, or as an after dinner drink by itself. Samichlaus is filled in personalized 330 ml. bottles, exported to exclusive distribution partners worldwide mainly through pre-orders prior to bottling in October each year. Samichlaus contains only natural ingredients and is being brewed according the purity law of 1516. The 2001 vintage was bottled on October 10 and 11 together with 250 kegs a 30 litres destinated for USA and Finland. The total quantity of bottles equals slightly more then 6000 cases (24 bottles) for world-wide sales till autumn 2002."
