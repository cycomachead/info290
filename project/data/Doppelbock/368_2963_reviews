"Malty bready aromas. Pours brilliant gold with a 1” dense, finely bubbled white foam cap. Rich malt flavors with some kettle caramelization and malt spice. Medium full body and medium carbonation."
"O: Drank this on an empty stomach and it was quite warming and not boozy. It was a bit more sweet than expected or remembered. The taste follows the nose to some extent. Head retention is less than I would have liked. The 2nd bottle seemed less sweet; my palate must have re-adjusted. These go down very easy. It's no wonder that they built a biergarten as a safe harbor. Solid Bock."

"O - I have not had this in about 15 years, so it was interesting to revisit. A bit too sweet for me, but within the style of doppelbock."

"So, do gentlemen prefer this kind of doppelbock? Regardless, this stuff pours a clear golden-brass topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises sweet biscuit, honey, a hint of vanilla, sweet flowers, and a twang of candied orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a pinch of clove, a hint of sweet corn, and an extra tad of breadiness. There's a definite sense of booze in there, but it doesn't have all that much effect. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a solid doppelbock, as per usual when Capital is involved, though I'm not sue the blonde-ness was all that effective in the final execution. I mean, I like this beer, but their other d-bocks just hold up a bit better in my eyes."

"The beer was poured into a goblet from the bottle with a golden appearance. It had about 3/4 inch head with a slight yellow tint to the white bubbles. The beer smelled like a good German beer. One can smell the grain as well as the alcohol. Even in the aroma one detects a certain measure of creaminess. On the initial taste, one detects buttermilk biscuits, earthy grass notes, a hint of spiciness, and perhaps a hint of corn to lend the creaminess of the beer. As is traditionally the case, a doppelbock is a meal in itself. The thickness allows the taste to stick to the back of the throat as the biscuits turns sour and fade. In terms of the style, I miss the darker notes of a regular doppelbock. The blonde version is solid, but leaves something to be desired."

"I tried so hard to find something nice to say about this beer, but it's so hard when I find a beer that has very little to offer. I was hoping that not all of these tasted like this so I bought another bottle from another store. I got the same thing from the second bottle. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."

"O - It shouldn't be news to anyone that a lager; doppelbock especially, from Capital Brewery would be anything less than great. This aged Blonde Doppelbock shows faint signs of degradation with a faint overall cellar mustiness but it remains drinkable and quite enjoyable regardless. I can't wait for Capital Bockfest next weekend!"

"A good bock that has a few flaws holding it back, but I drink this if offered it, wouldn't buy it again though"

"O: Well put together. Rich flavor but very straight forward. Extremely drinkable, could use more complexity. Then again I am comparing it too Bell's Consecrator which is a malt bomb. For a ""blonde"" dopplebock it is exactly what I expect."

"Comments: This beer taste more like a malt cordial than what most people think of as beer. At 7.8%, it is more of a treat than something you would drink with dinner. Still a very special treat for malt lovers."
" IBU: 15-20 (estimated)"

"O=With just the one sample, I leaned toward giving this a 5.0, but will definitely buy a 6-pack and sample some before elevating the rating behind 4.5. If you are in southern Wisconsin and are looking for a smooth beer (would pair well with alfredo sauce and possibly red meats), this is one you need to try."

"Not bad, but it doesn't blow me away either. Somewhat reminiscent of a Belgian Blonde with a little less yeast character. I would expect what is basically a hellesbock to have a bit more hop flavor to it, and perhaps a bit higher bitterness. The aroma is quite pleasant, but the flavor dissipates quickly on the palate, and the alcohol in the finish is maybe a tad harsh. Pretty drinkable, but not my favorite for the style."

"This is another quality, interesting doppelbock from Capital. While needing a reduction in alcohol to showcase the full extent of its qualities, it is still quite enjoyable. Enjoyable to consume now, and hopefully in a future where the ABV is knocked down a notch."
"D - Interesting taste profile, not a bad brew"
"D - A pretty nice dopple bock. It kind of straddles the line between a dark bock and a helles bock with a brown color that adds some nutty complexity to the malt profile and a light enough malt character that the hops can shine through a bit. Well done."
"Taste is where the malt is at. Sweet delicious malts, an interesting spectrum of grainy goodness, the flavor profile of an excellent doppelbock somewhat hampered by being overly hot with ABV around the edges. The mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant, however."
"Balance is good throughout. Nicely warming at 7.8%. Full-bodied and lightly effervescent. Somewhat clingy, almost cloying after the swallow though with a coating on the tongue and palate. Aftertaste is very nice and mellows well. Glad I bought the 4-pack and not just a single."
"This one pours a fairly clear orange-red color with two fingers of head that goes down fairly quickly, but a bit of head lasts for quite some time. Aroma is grainy, malty, citrusy, and a bit alcoholic. The taste here is quite interesting, the main thing I get on the tongue is booze, but it's not overbearing. It's actually tempered well with some green apple, grains, lemons, and caramel malts. But, yeah, it's a boozy brew. The mouthfeel is fairly full and decently carbonated, and the drinkability is pretty good, considering the booziness. This brew almost reminds me of a barleywine since the alcohol is just so forward. Either way, it's a solid beer."
"Overall not to bad I love a good dopplebock, I've never seen a blonde one before so I was happy to try it."
"O - Not great, but far enough above average to revisit in the future."
"D/O- Quite refreshing even for a higher ABV beer. A four pack of this in the summer would be great for wasting away an afternoon outside. Capital knows doppelbocks, period."
"Bottle gifted from the brewmaster and from the owner in Tampa meetup.Told this bottle ages for eight years or more, but it was hot out and the bottle cold. Drinkability was OK."
"D: I can say its the best I have tried out of several from this brewery but I don't think I would go back to back with this."
"Overall, this is a delicious summer time bock. It does pack a bit more punch than your typical warm weather beer but the flavor, unlike darker bocks, is still fairly light and refreshing."
"Pours a pale amber color with a thin and fastly diminishing head. Some scents of sweet carmel malts, grainy wheats and a little lemon citrus. Packs a bold taste for a lighter colored beer. A very complex mix of malts and grains that leave a very dry taste in your mouth. Interesting to say the least."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, light but good representation of style, this is a very solid beer worth drinking for a long time."
"Overall - This should be the official drink of March in Wisconsin. It looks like summer's coming, but it gives you what you need for March. Something worth looking forward to every year."
"EDIT-I have held onto a few bottles of this for a few months now and after having one tonight, I noticed more booziness than the last time I had one. I don't know if just a few months is enough to bring out characteristics from cellaring it but it was for sure packed more of a punch than the last time I had it. Another factor was that right before I drank this tonight, I had two lesser alcohol beers so it may have made this one seem more boozy."
"The 7.8% ABV is well hidden and I could down the whole 4 pack, but probably not a good move."
"D: This is a little more tangy than a typical Doppelbock but the rest of the regular qualities are there. It is a decent brew but not one I'll seek out."
"I like the beer, but one is enough. I would have liked a tad more balance here. Need a little more hops and just a tad less malt."
"Definitely lighter than others of the style... Very sweet and fruity malt aromas... Overly sweet.. Lots of apple and raisins... Loads of sweet caramel malts with the apple and raisin present here as well... Strange aftertaste present as well... This one isn't working for me... Very average doppelbock..."
"Blonde Doppelbock was amber in color with some fine sediment floating about. It had an off-white head with decent retention and lacing. The smell was light caramel malt. The taste was sweet malt upfront, a little toasty and a bit fruity with noticeable alcohol. The finish was dry and warming. It was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's a decent Doppelbock, but not one that I will likely try again."
"Pours a golden color with quite a bit of haze and a thin white head. Interesting nose with grain and some light fruits. Hints of alcohol. Taste is light fruit and grain, going along with a creamy mouthfeel with slight booze. An interesting idea, but not all that good."
"Highly drinkable. The great flavor wants to be consumed fast, but one of those to be watched for the higher ABV."
"Overall - Never had anything from this brewery before (probably because I live in WA), or even an American dopplebock for that matter, but I must say, this was a very good one, so I'll have to check out other beers from this brewery if I see them around here. For a strong, malty, smooth lager, this one delivers the goods."
"All in all very drinkable but rather different than I remembered. I thought before that it was clearer and sweeter. Maybe just a defective memory."
"This is perhaps a touch too sweet for my tastes, but it is a nice Helles Doppelbock that I am definitely enjoying. While certainly not the point, I can't help but feel that some more hop character would make this a touch more balanced and enjoyable; especially as this beer warms up it starts to get a bit too sweet."
"D - A little hot and sweetness gets cloying after awhile."
"Poured from bottle generously provided by Kirby. Color is a clear golden honey with a small white head that fades quickly. A very interesting appearance for the style. Smell is banana bread, sweet malt and a hint of yeast spice. No trace of hops. Flavor follows smell, bananas up front, some bread dough, and a hint of honey sweetness. Light carbonation and medium-full body. This is a tasty beer, but I could not drink more then one of these at a time."
"The flavor is weak and flat, mildy sweet medium bodied, not a lot of carb in the mouth, finishes nicely though. Its just mediocre, nothing special about it at all."
"My friend D. Kurtz waited 8 yrs. to find this beer, and was nice (or drunk) enough to share. Rich copper colored beer with a thick white head. Sweet honey, caramel malt, some Biscuity sweetness. Flavour is very sweet and malty, but not cloying. Honey flavour and slightly vineous. A touch of biscuity flavour before the smooth clean noble hop finish, creamy texture. Nice complexity."
" D- This beer is really too sweet with nothing to support it and no depth to the sweetness."
"I've had several Capital beers and was really looking forward to the Blonde Doppelbock. This beer is a very light amber shade. The smell is very sweet. You can detect a scent of caramel. The taste is equally as sweet. I found the 7.8% ABV to be hidden very well. I highly recommend this beer. I was impressed by it."
"There's not a lot of Blonde Dopplebocks of which to compare, but this one is not a great example of the style. But is is a fine comparison to Imperial Pilsners."
"A: Minor lacing along the interior of the glass, light to medium gold in color, crystal clear - 3.50, S: Lots of sweet grains - malts dominate the nose, I pick up little to no hop aroma, very slight burn - 3.00, T: A decent spicy hop bite, quite grassy and with a jolt of alcohol burn, quite bready and with a thin toasty flavor - 2.75, M: A little on the side of being slick, medium mouth feel - 3.00, D: A blonde Doppelbock is not your standard style and hence I'm not sure what to expect, all in all this was an okay beer but not one that blew me away - 3.00"
"Solid all-around. Nice, bright gold color. Firm head with sweet caramel aroma. Caramel and roasted malt flavors predominate, with well-balanced sweetness. No heat or pepper from alcohol - smooth at the finish. Followed this was a normally good bock from anoher brewer, but it seemed lackluster in comparison after having this. Nicely done."
"D: Another great german-style beer from Capital. No surprise here..."
"I enjoy doppelbocks quite a bit, but I must say that this one let me down. Nice aroma, but not much taste to back it up. Maybe I got a skunky bottle?"
"D: Very good beer. Not sure of the price point for quality here as I believe it was close to $3.50-$4.00 for one of these. Good but not as good as some other brews that are less money."
"Doppelbocks are not among my favorite styles but I would drink this again."
"Points for being exactly what it advertises. A blonde doppelbock- light color leaves a not as malty flavor."
"Interesting twist on a dopplebock. I felt it worked, but the alcohol could be a turnoff for some."
"D - You'd never expect this to be 7.8% alcohol as it is very easy to drink. Crisp and refreshing, light and easy going. Good thing they are sold in 4-packs or things could get ugly very fast!"
"The taste is also pretty light, but its sweet and easy to drink."
"seems alot like their maibock. a little more complex"
"D - Too drinkable at 7.8%."
"D: I almost feel bad that I don't like this beer more, but I wouldn't drink another one. I'm not feeling the caramel malt in this one, I can taste it, but I'm not liking it."
"The drinkability was good. The ABV was a little high, but that was more than balanced by the flavor."
"A nice malty (but with balance - sweet - but not cloying) warming sipper. Hits a blonde/Helles doppelbock interpretation well!"
"D) A decent brew, but not one that is a stand out."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly to form a cap. Smells of sweet malt the second I pop the twist off. I nudge my nose a bit closer and find lots of caramel, prunes, sweet fruity malts, and melanoiden. Taste is sweet with fruity malts and caramel. I pick up some brown sugar and cherries in there as well. Finish is a bit sweet with a bit of dryness to it. Mouthfeel is sweet and sticky, carbonation is light to medium, body is medium. It smells a lot better than it tastes. I find this one to be a bit too sweet for its own good. If there were a little bit more burnt sugars or dark fruits in there to counter the sweetness this would be pretty damn good."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a somewhat slick feel in the mouth. Leaves a long lasting, slightly bitter aftertaste."
"when i had this in a small 2 or 3oz sample size at a festival, it seemed so much better. but sitting down with a full serving, it was not as ideal. not a bad beer, but not really all that good either, particularly as a result of the fusels and alcohol that come in and mar the whole thing..."
"Clear and bright orange-amber with a thin, creamy head that quickly shrinks to a bubbly ring. Sweet fruity aroma...caramel, spice, apple, and honey. Bready malt covered with a slick, fruity sweetness. Not overly sweet. On the brighter side of things, not only in appearance, but in flavor too. Sweet bread, honey, and plum. Medium-full, creamy body...a little sticky. Pretty good stuff, nice and smooth."
"This is very good as an everyday dopplebock, actually. If I had regular access to this, it would most likely become a staple of mine."
"All in all very nice, if a little sweet. I tend to like beers on the dry hoppy side than this, but still enjoyed immensely."
"This is tasty enough but it's very one dimensional; could use a bit of hopping to balance it out. It's basically a malt bomb, and a tasty one at that, but it's not overly interesting. I'd still be glad to have a pint or two on occasion, however."
"Drinkability: This is a nice and good tasting malt filled beer. The alcohol is present but not overpowering. I believe it is just above average for the style. I would have a couple of these at a bar, but not session them."
"Pours clear, copper color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight alcohol, and yeast. Fits the style of a Doppelbock. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, yeast, slight roasted malt, and slight hops. Overall, a rather good brew; nice body, blend, and drinkability."
"Overall I would have to say I enjoyed the Autumnal Fire more than this beer. Regardless, Capital needs to either improve their year round lineup or lower their prices on their beers. Their regular year round lineup is no cheaper than other local breweries but doesn't seem to compare. Aside from these limited release beers, which are about $3 dollars higher per six pack, there are few Capital beers that I would buy aside from individual bottles."
"3.5-4 a good effort. pretty close to what i think of as a maibock as opposed to a doppelbock. the filming is a bit excessive though, as is the intrusiveness of alcohol in the flavor. yet i find myself sucking it down pretty quick."
"Sessioning - I wouldn't call this a full on session beer, but I could have several of these any day. I'm sure I'd feel it."
"The smell comes through in the taste. Rich body with a relatively low carbonation level. Nearly no hop--on the sweet side (even for the style). Not crisp--round, like an ale."
"The taste, while excellent, loses some points for its inability to stand up to food. I tried this a with a bowl of chili, and its character evaporated when faced with a little tabasco sauce. I'd expect something with this alcohol content to be able to hold its own a little better. But that said, this is a terrific beer on its own, and I'd highly recommend it."
"12oz bottle into a DFH signature glass pours a crisp orange with a nice frothy khaki head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves no lacing. Aroma is a decent amount of crisp sweet malts. The taste is a nice amount of sharp sweet malts that leaves a nice lingering caramel malt taste with a hint of sweet fruits. The beer is medium bodied with a slight boozy presence, but nothing too overbearing. An intriguing take on the style, but certainly an enjoyable one for spring."
"You get used to it, after a few sips, but it never quite comes together. None of it is bad, really, but when you combine its lack of balance with its huge intensity it's really not that good."
"I've never had a blonde doppelbock before this, and I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised by this subtle beer."
"I thought this one was pretty good though I definitely prefer a darker Doppelbock. An interesting beer though, worth a try."
"The lighter specialty malt bill leads to a sweet bready flavor and quite noticeable alcohol presence. Hops are detectable as well with the light body and moderately high carbonation. I found this to be pretty tasty and enjoyable beer, I would be happy to taste some more from this brewery."
"Drinkability: Easier drinking Doppelbock than most. Great Spring seasonal."
"Good stuff.."
"Drinkability: Especially high - an amazingly great tasting beer with a very moderate ABV and nice clean finish."
"D- the website warns to 'treat this malt monster with respect'. of course, since monsters are scary and dangerous, most folks steer clear of their path. i however, am a certified monster slayer and i must say that this deceptive monster's alcohol is exceptionally well hidden for being damn near 8%. whatever category this may fall into, i could go for another one."
"pours crystal clear golden orange with a 1 finger head that quickly fades with no lacing down the glass would have given this a 5 but it says its a blonde...i will give - it is the blondest doppelbock i have ever seen. smell is all bready malts and fruits. taste is very bready malts with fruity apple and pear flavors. mouthfeel is very creamy and on the heavier side for this style which i love. overall capital has found a new customer i will be looking for more capital brews. side note i would like to see more reasonable prices 12.99 a sixer is steep"
"This is by far the best of the Capital brews I've tried. Very sessionable and very enjoyable."
"Overall this is a great session beer, very impressed, will be drinking lots of it this summer."
"D: Very tasty beer, I think this would be a nice summer BBQ beer."
"Drinkability: On flavor, I'd love to drink this all day. On ABV, I'll be good and keep myself to just a couple."
"The mouthfeel is somwhat thick with a bit of creamyness from carbonation. There is plenty of carbonation in this, without that stingy bite."
"Complexity isn't the goal here, and many other reviewers gave misguided reviews of this beer in my opinion. This straightforward malty, clean bock is very rewarding and hard to find anything in the U.S. that comes close in this style."
"A very enjoyable take on the Dopplebock. It's nice to see a brewer push the style envelope, even if ever so slightly. Nice work Capital!"
"All malt backbone."
"Pours a clear amber-honey color with a finger of white, foamy head. Smells of rich roasted malt, almond, a little citrus, and caramel. First taste is full of caramel malt, with a nice round yeast palate following, and the mild citrus and caramel linger into the finish. Robust and flavorful, this is a pleasure to drink and would be best enjoyed by itself or as an appetizer."
"Notes from: 11/11/05"
"Drinkability: Super-easy drinking session beer. I wish I could get this in Cincy year around. It would definitely be a staple in my fridge."
"Thanks to shbobdb for the incredible trade!"
"Pours a beautiful clear bronze with a creamy two finger white head that falls to a thin layer of foam. Not much webbing on the sides but a lot of bubbles racing to the top of the glass. Smell consists of smokey caramel malts, a smooth nuttiness, and a good amount of roasted grains. A good amount of breadiness and a touch of pepper in the nose as well. Taste begins with a very sweet caramel and butterscotch with a touch of smokey malt. Bready malts and sweet sugar midway with a touch of citrus as well. Aftertaste is wet with toasted grains and slight earthy hop flavors. Light to medium body with a slick and moist feel. Smooth and enjoyable carbonation which gives the beer life. I like this beer a lot. Capital continues to prove they've mastered the art of brewing lagers. My good college buddy is moving to Madison very soon, I'll definitely be visiting him often :)"
"D- this one is very easy to drink. a great summer beer that begs to be taken to a BBQ. pick this one up if you havnt already tried it."
"Capital is quickly becoming one of my favorite American breweries. The blond doppelbock was an interesting beer. It poured a light amber color with an nice white head, and decent lacing. Smell was sweet, and malty. The taste matched the smell. Sweet, malty, and hints of caramel. Had the slightest hop finish. Mouthfeel was good, a little syrupy but not bad. Overall this was nice and sweet doppelbock. A change of pace from other doppels. It was very nice."
"Overall I was a bit shocked and let down by this one. I have had good luck with Capital so far and this was the first one that threw me. Nothing that would keep me from trying them again in the future, but it does make me take pause. Oh well on to the next one."
"Pours a hazy, higly carbonated, soft orange/light copper. No head even with a medium pour. Thats just slightly softer than a hard pour by the way. Smells malty, kind of sweet like an ice cream cone. Nuttiness and toffee dominate the initial taste. Zesty hops pick up from there. Slight vanilla in the initial taste. Nice mouth feel to it. This beer really grew on me as I worked my way through it. Well put together."
"Pretty much the same beer from the bottle as on tap (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/368/2963/?ba=pimpp). The smell is the biggest downfall of this brew but I'd say it makes up for it in drinkability. Under 7% for a doppelbock is very nice."
"This drinks well. Maybe too well as it could catch up on a guy if not careful."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable - stealth sessionable?"
"d- this can be booth a sipping beer and have a bunch beer, very enjoyable and will def buy more."
"This beer was ok, but very unimpressed. This was my first foray into so-called ""Blonde Doppelbocks"" and it disappointed me. Way too sweet for my taste. No carbonation, no lacing, no head off tap. Could have been better,or at least not labeled as a doppel."
"It's very agreeable, and seems to be a good introductory German-style beer in general."
"Very nice, another good beer from Capital."
"Drinkability- @ 6.9%, it's not sessionable, at least not for me, but to enjoy seasonally a couple times, it isn't to shabby. A bit more filling that your average beer."
"I bought this as a single from 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"Thickness is moderate to high which is totally appropriate here. A tad slick although the carbonation helps smooth that over. ABV is totally under control and, if I needed a big ol' malt fix, this would be a fun change of pace from a traditional doppel. Really this is more of a freaked-out marzen/maibock marriage in my book."
"D- pretty damn good, no wonder he has a fest to celebrate this"
"Delicious beer that would be a really good food pairing beer which would go well with a lot of different foods. A little thin for a dopple, but a very tasty beer."
"I enjoyed this one a lot despite not knowing the style very well."
"Pretty good, and a fantastic transitional beer for a macro drinker... needs more depth though for my palate, and I love a good lager...especially American made ones."
"My guess on ABV was 7-8%, so I was a little high, but this one does have some heat to it. It seems to lack the complexity of a dark dopplebock, but it is easier to drink, and a bit more bitter as well. Not bad at all, I would be happy to have again."
"This one pours quite a light amber into my Imp Pint, head gets huge on a vigorous pour but settles right down. Aroma is hoppy with a light malty undertone. Taste follows that as the hops stands out on top of the rich malty presence. This one is a nice change for a dopplebock for sure. Easily drinkable yet enough flavor and aroma to thoroughly enjoy. Cheers!"
"This was my first blonde doppelbock and I really liked it. Great bock flavor but lighter and very drinkable."
"drinkability is decent, but nothing special. the malt and alcohol levels bring it down, but any seasoned drinker will find their palates begging for a second bottle. cheers!"
"Finish picks up just a bit, but the lingering harshness of a ""house"" yeast strain of where this is contract bottled is a bit tough."
"I'm not quite sure what style I should be comparing this to. I wish I picked up their Maibock (I figured I'd try it on tap, but didn't get around to it)."
"Always a good brew, but the early versions were much better. Poured with a nice head that subsided into a light cover and a little lace. Color is a lovely deep amber. Aroma is a bit boozy, sweet, and malty. Flavor is huge caramel malt with just a touch of bitterness. Good carbonation. Likewise good mouth. Pleasant finish. Could drink a few, but not many."
"This beer pours a clear red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into decent lacing. The aroma is of caramel, with a hint of grapefruit. The taste is maltier than the aroma, with a nice lasting caramel finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, I don't really get this beer. It seems more like an amber lager than a doppelbock. It isn't bad, but it isn't good enough that I would buy it again."
"Pours an orangey amber with a one finger head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet sugary malts and some yeast. Taste is honey, camel, bananas, apples, and cotton candy. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Incredibly drinkable - perfect compliment to a beautiful spring day!"
"Drinkability is average, unless you really enjoy the flavor and alcoholic burn. I do. I really really do. At only 6.9%, it's not masked at all. And yet, I have had on occasion a 6 pack and always felt it in the morning. I wonder if it's still only 6.9% after all these years."
"Drinkability - pretty tasty craft brew. Thanks Joe!"
"Very drinkable for such a rich and almost sweet malty brew, could even be slowly sessioned. Another Capital brew that i can only describe as an enjoyable treat. An approachable, straightforward and tasty brew. Will be keeping my eys open for this in the future."
"Carbonation is extremely light but just noticeable enough to be apparent. I would definitely buy this again were it on shelves in Seattle."
"Soft pour into a half liter mug. Pale tan head with moderate lacing. Pale orange (or amber-tinged golden if you prefer) in color, quite clear, and with moderate carbonation. Big malty nose, with light notes of plum, tangerine, and toffee. Some warming alcohol is present on the nose. Not much by way of hops on the nose, but they're here alright. Tastes 'brighter' (dumb word choice, I know) or at least livelier than many a dark doppelbock I can think of, but would easily strike you average everyday-drinker of light lagers as a so-called 'dark beer' if it were offered to him or her in a blind taste test. Light honey notes start this one out, and fairly linger throughout, playing of some rich caramel-noted malts and a touch of crystal malt for sweetness. Light hints of molasses. As with a few other doppelbocks I could mention, this one is on the fruity side for a lager, and this is to its credit. Honey notes in the aromatics, and the barest hint of candi sugar keep you guessing at this one: ale or lager? Almost mead-like in character, with a firm, medium body, slightly thick/slightly creamy mouthfeel, and excellent drinkability. This is just an excellent brew, plain and simple, and it's worth whatever the good folks at Capital feel they should get for it. This one (and the Bell's Cherry Stout) are on my list of ""dream kegs"" for when I own my own place, whatever that place may be ; D !"
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Blonde Doppelbock isn't the beer that I'd hoped it would be. This brewery appears to take pride in their bocks since they brew six of them at various times of the year. Even though this one falls well short of expectations, I'm still excited about trying the four Capital bocks that I haven't yet had. I just hope they're better than the beer I just finished."
"Drinkability  This is a fairly stiff DB because of the boozy flavor but it streaks down the throat with ease so watch out!"
"Cellared for about six months by expatsteve. Sampled at a doppelbock tasting with golden2wenty1, dirtylou, and myself...6/6 in the lineup."
"It's a little more amber than I would think of for a blond. The nose is all grain and malt, very pleasant. It has a sweet, malty taste with a crisp, clean finish that leaves the mouth as a sparkle of carbonation. The mouthfeel for this beer is very appropriate for the style. It's clean, crisp, and not overbearing. A nice drinker with a well disguised alcohol content."
"Drinkability: In many ways, this is the jewel in Capital's brewing crown--a truly amazing brew. Embodies the style almost perfectly, remaining extremely drinkable and impressively complex. Here's to you, Kirby...."
"Pours a clear lighter amber. Nose is sweetened malts. Flavor is quite sweet, light brown sugar with a high level of malts. Winter fruits also prevalent with an oh so little hint of bitterness in the finish. I founds this to be almost cloyingly sweet. Nice malt and fruit notes were suffocated by the syrupy body of this brew. Thanks to JeffKrenner for the bottle."
"Isn't really a blonde hue, more of a killians with constant, thin bubbling. Aroma was that of a brown sugar, toasted malt. Lots of toaty sweet malts give some bready and brown sugar notes all over the palate. Plenty of sweet yet adjunct noes to be a ""buy again"" dopplebock."
"Well I was completely taken by surpise by this beer, it was nothing like I thought it would be. I would have preferred the head to remain pillowing thru the begining to end of the beer, but only a few brewers can pull that off. Not complex, but doppels rarely are. This was a good beer, I enjoyed drinking and reviewing it. And I still taste honey in my mouth."
"Drinkability - this goes down fairly easy, but it's a bit too sweet for me to have more than two in a session. I would have this again, just not often."
"Truly exceptional and very fresh. High in alcohol, loaded with banana, coconut, rum, and granny smith. Fierce, biting, and crisp. Loads of fun. Amazing buzz. Nose burning. Seriously, my nasal passages were completely scorched after a half liter of this stuff. Very unique. I should be turned on by the fire but instead I feel drawn to it. Did I mention that its a pretty, clear orange color with wild, crazy bubbles but no head. Mmm, Capital really gets bocks right."
"This review is based on several liters enjoyed at Capital Brewery's annual Bockfest - the freshest way to enjoy a Blonde Doppelbock. This beer pours out a slightly hazy amber color with a large, creamy head. The aroma is quite malty with a bit of fruitiness. Alcohol is noticable in the nose. The flavor is very malty with notes of apples and coconut. This is not what you think of as your standard dopplebock. Although it is malty, it is not dark. It is, however, refreshing and delicious. It is also drinkable in large quantities. Try it on tap, and you will see what an exceptional beer this is."
"got this in a trade and I cannot find my trading papers so thanks to the one that sent this. poured a golden with a small white head that didnt last long. aroma sweet orange, malt, some alcohol. flavor got caramel, malts, the orange, a hint of honey with a slight amount of alcohol. not to bad. But I was a little surprised to see a dopplebock this light in color."
"Pours a mostly clear golden amber. Head is decent at first and slowly fades to a thin collar. Aroma is mostly toasted toffee-ish malt with a hint of spices. Flavors are a bold spicy taste mixed with a bit of sweet fruits. The smooth Munich malts blend really well with the other flavors and they compliment each other quite well. Mouthfeel is oily but finishes very clean and urges you to take another drink after each sip. A good offering from Capital Brewery."
"Drinkability is ok. I wouldn't bother with it again though. I think I just prefer doppelbocks on the dark side."
"Pours an orange/yellow color with almost no head that doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is grainy and has some toasted malts. The flavor is malty and has an interesting toasted maltiness. It's ok, but the flavor just doesn't do it for me. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is ok."
"pours a solid orange color with a striking lack of head. Nose is full of toasty melanoidans and nice figgy notes. Very appealing nose. Flavor is solid toasted maltyness. Good bit of vienna and munich malt. Light figgy character, but mostly melanoidan. Feel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. Overall, nothing really makes this one stand out to me. The flavors are just not turning me on all that much. Its okay, but I don't think I would have it again."
"another good one from capital...I kind of ignored these guys when i first got here due to new glarus, lake louie, and tyranena but they have some nice offerings."
"I've had quite a few dopplebocks lately, and I must say this is one of my favorites. Pours a cloudy amber-golden yellow with a thin white head that fades quickly. Smell is citrusy and floral with a nice malt kick. Taste starts off with that strong malt backbone and adds in the nice hoppy citrus/floral notes to balance it off nicely. Mouthfeel is on the crisp side, but not as biting as some dopples I've had. This is a tasty-ass brew right here. Extremely drinkable for 6.9%. Probably my favorite Capital brew to date."
"My first doppelbock. Very blonde, orange-colored, almost no head or lacing. Smells sweet, with a big kick of spicy hops. Tastes really, really, really good, a revelation for me in the way it's quite hoppy but still extremely smooth. My experience with Capital has been that they make solid, faithful, unexceptional representations of styles, and since this is my first for this particular style, I can't comment on that aspect; however, I can say that it's a damn tasty beer."
"I have not much experiece w/ this style, but this offering is impressing the hell out of me...so quaffable its ridiculous."
"Yum. Golden to copper in color with a lacey white head. Light caramel malt and spicey yeast fill the nose. Flavor is so clean. Malty, pilsen and caramel, just a light hint of toast in the finish. Hop character is very subdued, just adding some bitterness. The yeast is spicey, a just noticable ester that I've really come to look forward to in the Capital Bocks. This beer is smooth and totally hides the alcohol with its sweet malt charater. Another great lager from Capital."
"This beer is a dark gold color, with a small cream colored head. Some carbonation. The scent is pale malts, sweetness. The taste is the same sweet pale matls, floral hop tones, bits of fruit, some more sweetness. Touch of alcohol present. Med-full mouth, creamy feel. Not a bad beer to enjoy in the springtime."
"Pours a nice looking clear bronze color with about 1/2"" of creamy off-white foam. Smell is very malty, with some brown sugar, and a little alcohol present. Taste is very full and rich, this reminds me in many ways of a maibock. The alcohol adds a little spiciness, while hops may be hidden somewhere in there, I can't find them. A nice big alcohol and malt beer, for the cold days, easy drinkin'."
"The flavor balances sweet malts with alcohol, but alcoholic heat is relatively mild for a dopplebock. A full-bodied beer, this coats well with an exceptionally clean and smooth finish. A very smooth and easy drinking beer, Capital hits a home-run again."
"A bottle shared between David and I, courtesy of fellow BA and super dj, Bocktech. Golden honey in color, since I was pouring we both ended up with 1/2 heads of off-white, thick head. It left in a hurry, so I am concentrating on the aroma...first impresion: it smells like beer. Second one, when you take some big whiffs off the glass, you encounter good German maltiness/graininess, and also alcohol struggling to get through. Mouthfeel is full -, and I've head this beer for about 30 minutes by now, so it has warmed up a bit. It was a bit tastier about 15 minutes ago. I think the alcohol has intensified, and it's the first thing I encounter now. There's some malty sweetness, but the alcohol definitely appears again in the finish. Word to wise...drink it before it gets too warm. Before it did, I thought it was pretty thick malt, with some hops in the finish."
"This beer is easily consumed, and is also eager to please."
"12 ounce bottle, courtesy of Skidz and BIF10."
"A light pour for a Dopplebock hence the title ""Blonde Dopplebock"" i suppose. A rich looking amber pour with minimal head. The nose was semi sweet with a wallop of molasses and some noticeable maltiness. The body was much bigger with an almost chewy toffee quality. Again the molasses and roasted malt were present as well as some lolipop sweetness. A very warming beer with an obvious alcohol kick on the finish. A full bodied beer with plenty of backbone. I quite enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability: Very good. Would love to try this on tap in a 1/2L glass. Yum!"
"thanks again to zap for digging into his stash of beloved bocks!"
"I suppose I could be overexaggerating its subtlties, but who cares? This is good."
"Drinkability is very high and at relatively high ABV this would definitely cause me to leave the car keys in the pcoket and call a cab."
"Lands in the glass with a quickly fading cream hued head settling out on clear, finely bubbled deep golden liquid. The nose gives aromas of spiciness, and big bready malts...true to style. Some light vanilla/cream soda noted too. The taste is heavy duty sweet maltiness, slowly drying out to reveal ample hoppiness to keep it from becoming too sweet. Finishes on a bready malt note, very tasty, very drinkable. Props to Craig for this one."
"A flaming red head! Not alot of head retention-decent, yet patchy lace. All malt in the nose with faint fruit and nut adding complexity. Perhaps a little flabby in the mouthfeel with the malts coming on very strong and not enough hop balance, a bit dilute. Malt fans will dig it, no doubt. The beer finishes a tad sweet with mildly lingering malted milk ball flavors."
"Another good example by this brewery. Not as light in color as the title implies, just a little lighter than Salvator. Nice, smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, but not overwhelming by any means. Somewhat sweet, but drinkability remains good. I had this before a Salvator, and it was not outclassed. I liked their ""Autumnal Fire"" even better, but this is a pretty good doppelbock (kind of like a EKU 28 light?). Thanks again, Monk."
"Pours burnt orange in color with a creamy off-white head that dissipates into a good amount of lace. Nose is sweet with notes of fruit, spicy alcohol, and a touch of caramel. Medium to full in body with a subdued carbonation. Taste is dominated by bready malts and yeast with some underlying notes of honey. Finish is a bit buttery with a noticeable kick of alcohol. This was my first blonde doppelbock, and I certainly enjoyed it. Thanks to marc77 for the sample!"
"Medium bodied with sharp carbonation. It warms you up a bit as it goes down, but remains quite drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"Thanks to BigHuge for setting me up on a Date with this dirty Blonde!"
"Thanks feloniousmonk!"
"A dark golden colored brew with a small head that dissapeared almost immediately. Aroma is sweet and malty with a hint of caramel and a bit of a yeast thing going on. Flavor is a rich malty sweet one and a bit dry on the finish. Has that distinct German bock aroma and flavor. Not a bad beer but not something I'd drink often either."
"This brew pours a small head of fine white bubbles and a transparent light orange brown body. It had a mild malt aroma. This brew had a smooth initial flavor and no fore or after bite. I did not understand this brew and I would definately not call it a Doppelbock."
"If you're craving a beer from Wisconsin, this had better be the one. We'll be screening any excuses for other options, but it's a strict judge and jury. Really, this is the stuff!"
"First of all, I have never seen such a light colored Dopplebock nor have I ever rated such a light colored Dopplebock since I've been rating beers. That said, this brew had a small white head with small bubbles that fully diminished. The lacing was fair and the body was clear with an orange hue. It had a light malty aroma and a hoppy aroma of citrus. There was no carbonation observed with this brew. It was bitter tasting from start to finish and lingered for a while after finishing this drink. The mouthfeel was smooth, light and somewhat watery."
"Poured to a nice copper color with a tan head that diminishes to a ring. The aroma is sweet, and malty, toasty as well. The flavor was great with that big toasty, bready malt flavor, and as well as some caramel sweetness. This is a big full-bodied brew that is highly drinkable. I really like the big malty brew, this one did it for me. I will definitely sample this one again."
"Color is a deep golden orangy/amber with a head of short fluffy loose whiteness, lace sticks in strings. Smell is a lightened but darker orange and a terrific caramel sweetness in the nose. Rich and creamy taste, a bit of chewyness with good amount of caramel malts and a pretty moderate amount of dulled bitterness that has a great little hold of solid tang from hops. Excellently balanced. Great malt body, quite hefty with a bready thickness. Feel is a partially full bodied, creamy, chewy, nearly cloying, crisp full finish. Extremely drinkable, yummy, delicious, rich and creamy delightful wonderment. Capital has a winner with this one."
"Pours a clear amber in color with a thin white head that eventually retreats to the side of the glass. Aroma consists of sweet malt, citrus and light hops. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and creamy, yet also has some noticable carbonation toward the finish. Pleasant malt sweetness noticed initially. Additional combination of toffee, caramel and biscuit carries through. Finishes strong with some alcohol flavor present. Doesn't seem as ""heavy"" as the dark doppelbock that they produce. A nice example of the style and something to look forward to in the Spring."
"Tastes of sweet malt, light honey, and fruit maybe pair are the dominate flavors with a slight hop bit to even the finish out. Medium body with light carbonation that grows. Also has a slight alcohol bite at the end, but not an over the top pressence. A great beer. I have never had a blonde doppelbock or really that many doppelbocks before, but I like this one."
"Its brilliant amber robe takes on a crimson cast when set upon the bar, and the frothy white head seems to last forever. It continually retains a thin, creamy cap and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. The body is medium/full and it's smooth and creamy across the palate. Fresh and clean, gently toasted malt is present in the nose; and then again in the flavor. It's not a complex beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it is surprisingly rich and satisfying. The clean, pure flavor of Munich malt is nicely balanced by an underlying bitterness and a bit of drying alcohol that lends toward a note of apple. Mild honeyish-vanilla and caramel evolve as it warms, backed by some very low level hop flavor; and the finish is long lasting with residual nutty malt and a wash of drying alcohol. It's an interesting doppelbock in that it's very clean-cut and straightforward, yet satisfying. It doesn't have the depth of many darker versions, but it's impelling. Certainly worth trying."
"Clear copper appearance. Little head surprisingly, but a nice collar and good lacing. Deep bavarian malt aroma. Excellent. The nose is sweet as well as malty. Luscious taste. Deep malt. Some toasted notes. Just the slightest hint of alcohol. Bready and yeasty. And a little grainy as well. It's very nice. The body is full and gratifying. Carbonation seems to be in check, but nonetheless, fitting. This is a Blonde Doppel to be reckoned with."
"For the style you cannot do much better..."
"Amber hue, with a slight chill haze. Steadfast, uniformily thick white head. Belgian lace remains. Waft of wort like maltose and spent, freshly mashed grain hits the nose at first, then is ensued by mildly herbal hops and toasty Munich malt. Toffeeish melanoidins surface as the beer warms, but remain subdued. Rounded, mellow, honey laced sweetness bathes the palate initially and is complemented by nutty, lightly buttery notes of brittle and caramel. Hints of caramelized figs emerge mid palate along with a suggestion of sugary red licorice. Decocted? Hop bitterness is paltry, and functionally prevents cloying sweetness. Trace herbal Hallertauer hop flavor adds a ""green"" note to the deeply sweet malt profile. Full bodied, with a smooth, viscous mouthfeel. Finishes with lingering buttery poundcake like sweetness. A tasty brew that's akin to hellesbock / doppel hybrid. A touch shy in malt complexity, but nevertheless superior to many US microbrewed bocks."
"Cheers"

"Another classy doppelbock form Capital. This one seems improved as well."
"Clearish bright orange color with a yellow frothy head of small, rich bubbles. Laces in big thin laces. Toffee-ish aroma, slight spice. Full mouthfeel, coating and long lasting with more carbonation than the Dark Doppelbock or Autumnal Fire. Flavor is the most muted of the Capital limited release Doppelbocks, pleasant and sweet but not straying from medium dark caramel at first and deconstructing to a honey and slight molasses sense close to the swallow. Decent balance, but no overt hopiness -- as appropriate. Since this is one of the Capital ""premiums", I have to give it just OK marks on flavor, as its the most ordinary of the line of brews."
"Drinkability: The higher-than-average alcohol level would keep me from drinking more than one or two, but I find this to be a good laid-back doppelbock with a bit of Trippel and Oktoberfest characteristics thrown in. A good, if not confusing, brew."
"Dark clear golden color, small white head. Spicy yeasty and malty aroma. Not as sweet as I expected, nice hop balance, some banana-clove flavors, almost like a trippel, warming alcohol finish, very easy to drink. I like it."
"Deep, rich color with a strong malt nose that can be winey.  Damn, this is drinkable, despite the full mouthfeel.  German malt flavor does not overpower but is well balanced.  Never cloying but still strong.  Recipe seems to have been dumbed down from previous great past."
