The appearance is a bit off in that it is a bit too dark for the style, but the clarity and fine wreath of persistant foam are perfect. The aromq is a bit understated, but, with a nice swirl in my hand-warmed goblet stimulated a beatiful caramelly malt cloud. Very appropriate. The flavor is what aces this beer for me. Very well balanced between a rich malty sweetness balanced by a spicy but gentle hop backbone snd a dry mouthfeel. Speaking of that, many doppels are syrupy or teacley, but not this one. Again, bery nice balance of dryness, spice, and malty sweet ess with a touch of caramel. The finish is clean and dry. Well done!","danmouer","Feb 13, 2015"

Definitely one of my favorite beers so far, and by far my favorite from the Starr Hill variety pack.  If the fact that this is only rated ""good"" on here--rather than ""very good"" or ""outstanding""--means that other doppelbocks I haven't tried yet are EVEN BETTER, then I'll definitely have to seek out more in this style in the future.","Pantalones","Feb 08, 2015"

I quickly began the pour and I got some pseudo-cascading action as it generated some tawny head. Head retention was very low, however, and quickly turned into a skim of wisps atop the beer. Color was a dark-brown with ruby highlights (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was sugary malty sweet with an alcohol burn that tickled my nostrils. This may get me where I am going in one quick hurry! Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was of caramel, anise, malt husks and of course, a little bit of alcohol burn for good measure. Man, but this was super sweet as compared to the AIPAs that I usually drink and I began to sweat as a result. Finish was sweet, no two ways about it and the alcohol burn was literally breathtaking in the throat. Phew! One of these at a time, please. No wonder the monks could be held over all day after one.

Head is a caramel color and about a quarter of an inch but dissipates rather quickly. Typical double bock style with a malty flavor and pretty low carbonation. However this beer has a sort of spice that lingers on the back of my tongue. I can taste some chocolate and some bread. Troeginator is one of my favorites and if I had to compare Snow Blind to it I would say that they are similar but that Troeg's just tastes a little better. Still a great beer though.","steven911","Dec 07, 2013"
