"This really is an excellent Doppelbock, one of the only US versions I'd say are worthy of pairing up against the German stalwarts of the genre.  There are zero unpleasant flavors; the entire thing comes together smoothly, easily incorporating a high ABV recipe into a very drinkable package."

"Good beer, made in America, but  Optimator  or Celebrator still reigns supreme in this style of beer."
""
"Overall, ranks up there with the best of breed doppelbocks for me (Celebrator and Optimator)!"

"Deep reddish brown in colour with an inch of fine, medium beige foam. Good head retention. Malty aroma with a bit of alcohol, raisins and dried fruit, biscuit and toast, slight sugary character. Really nice flavour, balanced combination of aroma characteristics along with mild to moderate bitterness. Malty throughout with bready and biscuity notes, grain and dried fruit, alcohol in the finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation, smooth texture, mild warmth. I liked this quite a bit. Another solid beer from Jack's Abby -- they continue to impress me."
"o: Plenty to like here. This is more densely flavored than a typical doppel. To tbe point that I think it comes on a bit too strong. Still, I'd gladly have another."

"Note that the label clearly uses the Americanized (Saxonized?) spelling ""Dopplebock""."

"Overall very tasty beer"
""

"Great contributions from both the rich malts and fruity yeast here as they combine to create an enjoyable Doppelbock. The 9% feels appropriate but I like the edge it provides with the toasted grains and dark fruit notes. Provides what I look for in a solid Doppelbock and I will surely have this again."

"O - Exactly what I was looking for to compliment a roasted potato and steak supper. The high ABV certainly sneaks up on you... very tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"It is different for the style without the big sweet bready and toasty malts, but instead with lots of fruit flavors. The alcohol is dangerously well hidden and it is still delicious."

"Overall: Probably the most spot on interpretation of the style that ive seen in an american brewed doppelbock, only missing a better head retention. But overall I prefer less hop character and an overly sweet balance. I think ill save my other bottle for a while and see what happens"
""
""
"Simply excellent. The body is a bit thinner than some of the german dopplebocks but with impeccable balance and with flavors that captivate this beer is contemporary and stylish."
""
""
"O: It's a decent beer. Better as it warms. But there are some off-flavors on the back end that I don't care for. Alcohol is well ""hidden," but I think it's presenting itself in a form other than typical heat and spice."
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this a lot. I remember having raisin bread toast with butter for breakfast before going to church during lent and this is really took me back."
""
"Overall a really nice dopple. Would definitely have this again."
"Price Point - $4.99/16.9 oz bottle"

"This is a must try!"

"What does surprise is the fluidity and gulpability of Saxonator. Looks are deceiving here. Some Dopplebocks can become a bit too thick-bodied and/or cloying in the mouthfeel. Not this one! Creamy, velvety, but very drinkable! Maybe too drinkable?"
""
""
"Taste continues the nose, nutty upfront, a peek of fruit in the middle, with chocolate and balanced bitterness through the close. Amazingly smooth mouthfeel, and so easily drinkable. Warming does creep up on you slowly. A great brew."
""
""
"Overall this one is very true to the style and a great example of a finely crafted lager. All the flavors meld nicely together and deliver a solid beer."

"Overall: This is a great American dopplebock. I would hold this up to some of the better German Dopplebocks"
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm starting a journey through the Jack's Abbey offerings and this is a wonderful example of what they are capable of. The Saxonator is deep, dark, roasty, complex, and smooth. There was clearly a lot of attention to detail in crafting this brew and it strikes me as an awesome rendition of a dopplebock. Overall, an excellent beer from an excellent, local brewery."

"O - Good caramel, fruit, hard to believe this is a lager."
"O: This is a very enjoyable doppelbock. I wish they'd put it into a regular seasonal rotation in the early spring. Not too many doppelbocks in the American market that can compete with the quality this brings to the table."

"Pours a slightly chill hazed reddish brown color with a fluffy beige head that persists forever. Caramel, molasses, dark burnt sugars and dark dried fruits, its a malt heads wet dream. Very light aromas of earthy hop provides almost no balance. The flavor is malty and rich with all of the aforementioned aromas playing a part in the flavor. Heavy molasses with a hint of smoke dominates the flavor while the other tastes add character. Rich sweet and frigging smooth. Medium to thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly syrupy mouthfeel. Great Americanized version of a dopplebock."

"500ml bottle served in a pilsener glass. November 2012 indicated on the label. Pours a lovely copper hue with a fizzy, 2.5 inch tan-colored head with a translucent clarity and quite a bit of tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Head eventually settles into a rocky, quarter inch froth with residual spots and strands of lacing adhering to the walls of the glass as the brew recedes. Nose expresses grape bubblegum and some biscuity/wheaty notes. Taste follows nose; however, not as sweet as I would have anticipated; everything present in the nose coalesces nicely and leads to a pleasant balance. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and just a trace of oiliness to the texture. Overall, a very solid example of a style I'd like to see more of. Perhaps the best domestic Dunkle I've had (don't know why this is classified as a dopplebok). Alcohol is dangerously well-hidden as well. Wish these guys distributed in RI - thankfully I can easily cross the border to grab some."

"O - A very solid doppelbock. Not quite at the level of an Ayinger, but quite solid."

"I'm not too sure how I feel about this beer. I have had it in the past on draft and back then it felt like a monster, inching into quad-like territory. This bottled version seems far more tame. The flavors and aromas are nice but there isn't anything that draws you in and makes you want more."

"O – This is an awesome beer and a terrific end to the tasting I did at Jack’s Abby. It is full of malts and definitely sweet but never cloying. I was really impressed with all of the beers that I’ve had from these guys. If you’re ever in MA, I highly recommend paying them a visit."
"Bottled, no date found. Poured a deep amber color into a lager glass. About two fingers of beige head. Slightly cloudy. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell is earthy, malty, yeasty almost bread like. Not picking up any fruity aromas, maybe some caramel and toffee type notes. Taste is smooth malty sweet with slight bitterness. The word silky comes to mind. Nutty, a little bready, definitely earthy, and yeast character. Some acidity, maybe a hint of raisin or date notes. Very clean on the palate, light to medium body. Carbonation is moderate. Some aftertaste of sweetness once I finished the bottle - seemed to build up some. Very smooth, balanced, and drinkable even with the alcohol. Seems well hidden to me. Enjoyable, sure wish there was more than on bottle left on shelf."
"Overall: Good combination of sweet caramel with a touch of bitterness. Excellent value for the price. I will pick this up again even though there are others I prefer in the style."

"Drinkable doppelbock with some simplicity. Worth a try, but not even close to most German versions."
"O/D-Not my favorite from perhaps my favorite Massachusetts brewery but I will literally try every single beer I see on the shelf from Jack's Abby. The price-tag is always legit and the beer is even better. The true question is: would I like this beer more if it wasn't from a brewery that makes a few of my favorites? Or would I like it less without the respect that comes with the name on the label? I will never know."
"The beer pours a dark and raisiny brown with light ruby notes and a big old light cream head that sticks around with light tight knit bubbles that are replenished rapidly. The beers body appears lager clean, but dark and fairly opaque. The lacing is medium width, sticky, and wall-like across the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of spicy raisins. Thick caramel malts are also present and slightly chewy alcohol. The caramel malts even turn a little roasted as you swirl the beer in your glass. The beer tastes surprisingly suppressed with spicy raisin and alcohol and light grainy cereal. The beer begins with spicy cereal notes before transitioning into sweet raisin and slight caramel and a quick burst of spicy alcohol before the tastes turns again to grainy cereal malts and slight biscuit and the faintest hint of roast malt and bacon. As the beer warms up and I drink it further I get more and more of a feeling of slight rauchbier characteristics in it, similar to Smoke & Dagger. On the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy, and hits the stomach similarly. The mouth is left clean except for a slight scrim of spittle that wets the mouth for another sip. Overall this is a fairly decent dopplebock from Jack’s Abby. They hide the alcohol very well, but the thickness of the beer makes it a sipper (obviously…). It’s chewy and tasty, but it really doesn’t standout flavor-wise outside of the faint hints of rauchbier. It’s a good example of the style with some slight variations to add a “Jack’s Abby-flair” to it. A good beer for sure, and another wonderful offering from Jack’s Abby."

"Absolutely delicious, by far my favorite beer from Jack's Abby. A perfect seasonal beer."
"Jack's Abby produces some terrific beers, but this one was simply mediocre. I wish they could have kicked it up another notch, like they do with their other offerings."
"o - Overall a really nice beer from Jack's Abbey. Lots of malts and nice fruit to it, and very easy to drink. Very excited to try more of their stuff an EBF."
"Overall a really nice mouthfeel, full and creamy, and pretty good tasting too. My first offering from Jack's Abby, I look forward to trying more in the future."
""
"Malt start with a spicy (not hoppy) finish. Sweet without being cloy, the taste has several distinct stages: after the sweetness comes a warming alcohol moment that gives way to the bite of alcohol burn in the swallow. The spice steps forward as black and white pepper. The aftertaste is surprisingly brief, but the warmth (from the alcohol) lingers on."
""
""
"Overall pretty good, again haven't had a bad beer by them. This doesn't hint full on for most doppelbocks but a pretty good representation. Nice malts, fruits, plenty of booze which is one thing that is lacking in most doppelbocks, a full body with a lager crispness, and even some hints of darker malts like chocolate and crystal."
""
"O: Damn, I thought they couldn't top Kiwi Rising but this is just amazing in a totally different way. Never had a doppelbock that even comes close to this beer. Very unique style too, again unlike any other beer I've had."
""
"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer. Though while I enjoyed this it is not my favourite Jack's Abby offering. Still, very interesting take on a dopplebock, very nice flavours and mouthfeel."
""
"What a killer beer. Jack's Abby continues to blow me away with each new offering. I mean after the hop resin monster of the Kiwi Rising, this just raises the bar again. Really runs a fine line between Belgian Dunkel and German doppelbock. Just a killer slow sipping big beer."
