"This doesn't mess around: it's malty sweet and alcoholic: if you are a hop monster it'll leave you cold, however if sweet malts are your thing, buy a crate!"

"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly cloudy nearly opaque reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, prune, pear, apple, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt notes and fruity esters; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, molasses, raisin, pear, apple, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, pear, apple, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark malt and fruity ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice doppelbock. All around good complexity, balance, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Either very sweet and full or under attenuated – almost the total opposite of Maximator. Big, with lots of fruit pastry notes, almost like a winter ale. The hops are missed, but it works as a malt bomb, hiding the ABV well. Still, a bit sickly sweet for me, though it dries out and heats up as it warms and opens."

"This beer is really off what I think of in a doppelbock. It isn’t as rich or sweet and it takes on a lot of odd flavors I’m not used to as well. It isn’t bad, but it is far from good. Very far…."
"Body is fine, carbonation is strangely active given the head situation. For style it's maybe on the light side of medium. I find the black tea-sweet dark fruit flavor here to be a little overwhelming and not up my alley, but no one can deny an interesting brew. Try it for yourself."
"a doppelbock that was a tad on the sweeter side but still had that nice fall out on the tongue of any lingering sweetness. this is was toasty and a bit sour. the meatiness was a bit subdued to the fact that it was a bit fruiter than usual. they as the fresh pop subsided the ding and smoke revealed it self a tad. i would say that is on par with most other great doppels and much easier to find in europe."
"Overall, a grat beer at a great price. I snagged a pint for three bucks, and I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes solid dopplebock or some smoke. Rich, and roasty."
"Nothing special for me. Too bitter and the flavors aren't the caramel/toffee malt that I've come to look for in a dopplebock. Not offensive, but definitely not a favorite."
"This is a nice chocolatey Doppelbock, perfect for the winter. Another great example of the style from Germany."
"Pours medium brown with a bit of a garnet hue to it. Good off-white head with a touch of lacing around the edges. Bubbly cap on top as it settles down. Nose is really quite nice with a good amount of sweetness along with some toffee, caramel, and fruit character. The flavor isn't quite as impressive. It lost a bit of the sweetness from the nose and also has a noticeable level of bitterness. Mouthfeel is really nice and I like the overall level of sweetness in this. Slightly bitter. Drinks quite well; glad drabmuh was looking for this and I was able to pick it up, as it's quite good."
"Beer is medium in body and lead off is sweetness, malt syrup but not in a cloying way. It's good and clean with a decent finish. There is some bitterness in the back from the grains and the finish is a little dryer than I hoped but overall it's a very good beer and I'd have it again."
"M: As doppelbock you can feel alcohol in the mouth, bitter and then dry sensation at the end that lasts some time."
"The roasted flavor remains all the time, very nice"
"Notes: Best before 13/09/10. Well made and a solid example of the style. A fairly sweet beer that made for a nice sipping beer. I enjoyed drinking this, although I wasn't necessarily blown away, rather just continually pleased. Worth trying as it is a tasty beer and a good Doppelbock."
"Not bad, but I probably won't get it again. It could be worse, but this one just isn't for me."
"Impressions: Very nice. Bold flavors and lots of them. Bit strong on the alcohol though, so be careful"
"D - Awesome. Pair it with rich food, or guzzzle it out of a paper bag like a hobo, great either way."
"I wish very much that this were distributed widely. I found it in Springfield, MO several weeks ago and I believe it was the cheapest imported doppelbock on the shelf. Well worth the $2.39, it would be a staple at that price."
"Bier gersmackt gute!"
"D - Nice doppelbock, the aroma is spot on, but the flavor is just a little lacking. There is a complex blend of rich malt characteristics in the aroma, and while some of this complexity carries over into the flavor, it is not as enjoyable. There is a bit too much roasted grain taste and the finish could be smoother than it is. There are a few superior examples of the style, but this is likely better than most."
"Drinkability was very good, the ABV was reasonable and the flavor excellent. I would have loved to have another."
"D - Hardly notice the ABV. It is well hidden in this beer and lends a great spiciness to it. Great flavors all around and not overpowering in the cherry department. I'd love to sip this all night."
"Actually I stumbled upon it and I can't find it other than one little store I was in. I have to go back and set it up for my beer club as this month's winner."
"Overall, I could probably have a few of these, so tread lightly. I'd love to try it on tap. Very tasty and recommended."
"This is an extremely drinkable doppelbock, and I can see why its highly regarded. The sheer intensity of its fruitiness sets it apart from its rivals and the malt is the star of the show here. If I had ready access to this gem it would certainly be a regular in my fridge."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty with a touch of sweetness. Taste is rather mild with some maltiness and finishing bitter. Feels creamy in the mouth. A bit heavy on the stomach for continued drinking. Overall this is an average brew."
"drinkability is good for a full flavored beer but one is enough for me"
"D- This beer is delicious. There is a great rich flavor of blended malt flavors and is just sweet enough to give it depth without being sugary."
"OVERALL: A great doppelbock for sure; drank away very easily. Perhaps the best taste profile as of yet, but unfortunately the weak nose held it back a tad in the ratings. This is one I'll be picking up again for sure. Recommended."
"A great dessert beer, an exciting possibility for a meal pairing and a very good dopplebock, period. This is a must-try."
"D- Awesome! I got to the bottom and was looking for another. I'll be picking up more of this. My new favorite dopplebock!"
"drinkability- a fantastic beer. I did not expect to enjoy this beer so much. I highly expect to purchase this beer again soon and to anyone reading this review, please message me suggestion on food pairings :)"
"Tucher's Bajuvator Doppelbock is damn good beer. It's my first experience with Tucher and I'm impressed. It has a lot of flavor and is a nice representation of the style. I'm absolutely certain that it's better than the score here will reflect simply because the flavor's a little better than a '4.0.' I just don't think it's quite '4.5' good. Nonetheless, this is definitely a Doppelbock that you should check out. Damn good stuff."
"D: I could drink many of these in a row if the abv wasn't so sneaky! Absolutely phenomenal!"
"D - I could have two of these. It's roasted bitterness offsets the sweetness of the malts pretty well and leaves it a little more drinkable [Edited 6-30-09]"
"A very tasty beer, and I am so happy to have it in Guatemala! Will be enjoying this full-flavored brew for the rest of my time here and in the future."
"Very nice doppel"
"D - A good doppelbock all in all. The mouthfeel was a big plus for me. The fact it felt thick compared to the others I had at the tasting was a nice change."
"Overall, this is a superbly clean and well-structured example of the style."
"The first few sips sort of rocked me. It was strong, robust and in my face. After a few moments I was adjusted to it and ready to enjoy it for all of it's good character. I highly recommend it, but not on an empty stomach."
"Conclusion: I wanted to try this side-by-side with Spaten's offering which I did tonight, because, let's face it, after reading Novick all day, you NEED a drink...anyway...the Spaten let me down; this one, on the other hand, was all I expected...great, rich dopplebock with nicely balanced fruity and sweet malty tastes/aromas...at a great price...need I say more?"
"Drinkability: I found this interpretation of the style to be too brightly sweet and light for my taste, though I can see others preferring it to the ""heavier"" varieties. I would appreciate some ""darker"" complexities and balancing out the fruity sweetness somehow."
"Definitely not a bad Doppelbock but there's better ones out there. I found it to be a bit milder than some like Weltenburger, Celebrator, and Korbinian. I'd recommend it, but not over those three."
"I would reccomend this to any doppelbock fan."
"Pours a clear pitch brown with thin tan head. Smell: sweet with caramel, chocolate, and dark fruit notes, as well as an import grain character. The import character seems to fade after a couple minutes, good. Taste: also sweet, prune, raisin, caramel, some chocolate and roasted flavors, black cherries, a yeasty pumpernickel, warming alcohol. Mouthfeel: smooth, a little on the light side. Nice German doppelbock, but doesn't match up to Celebrator in my opinion."
"Overall, this beer is decent but not as gratuitously malty as I would like from a doppelbock."
"Drinkability: A quality, highly drinkable doppelbock. One of the more enjoyable ""ators"" I've had."
"well, high quality for sure. the best ever? no, but is is a malty treat. the alcohol flavor isn't really well hid. but, overall the flavors are fantastic."
"Poured a dark copper body with a two-finger head that died slowly and left little lacings. A sweet malt smell, a mix of sugary stuff and caramel. A very sweet taste in a thick and heavy, somewhat syrupy beer. Still goes down smooth and creamy, as I would say there is caramel, honey, gum and maybe butterscotch mixed in with hints of dark fruit (not so much tropical) and very minor hop presence to balance the beer. Finishes with a dry, crisp yet thick and smooth mouthfeel; definitely a sipper. Great beer and one of the better dopplebocks I have tried."
"Taste - Nice mellow sweetness, not as sticky sweet as others that I have had. The alcohol seems to be very well hidden here. Sweet roasted malt with flavors of cocoa more than anything else. Chocolate covered cherries. Now I will also make a new descriptive characteristic for doppelbocks such as this that I haven't used before. This style of beer is ""tobbaccoey."" Yes, it tastes like raw chewing tobbacco, which I find to be a pleasing taste even though I haven't chewed in years. (Of course now I am pondering, is there such a thing as a smoked doppelbock, and if so does it taste like an ash tray?) All jokes aside, while this surprisingly isn't the best doppelbock I have tried (Ayinger and Sam Adams in my opinion make the best ones) this is still a pretty damn good and very drinkable doppelbock. It was also pretty reasonably priced where I found it so I definately will have some bias towards it."
"Tucher Bajuvator poured a dark brown with a nice tan head. The smell was very sweet, hints of chocolate and the faint hint of hops. Taste was of sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel was good, with good carbonation. Drinkability was good, but with all doppelbocks, you have to be careful with the high ABV. Overall I thought this was a very good doppel. Very flavorful. A beer I will seek out again."
"D - excellent doppelbock. Easy to drink, but the abv will make you keep yourself in check. Definitely will seek this one out again."
"Drinkability: As with all Tucher beers I love it."
"Cheers."
"This pours dark at first glance,but when held to a back light it reveals deep cherry reds and burnt coppery highlights. The head is small and almond,leaving a disappointing amount of lace as it drops to a thin covering. The nose is sugary and sweet with some brown sugar and caramel shining through. This Tucher Doppelbock is just what I want when drinking this style,big malts,rich caramely decadence,fully ripened dark fruits and gritty/earthy yeast. The low carbonation keeps focus on the bold flavors and smooth creamy body. This is one to seek,luxurious stuff,reminds me why I love good beer!"
"Drinkability: flavors and mouthfeel are very midstream, nothing overly special. One is nice, while two or more would seem like overkill."
"Full of dark fruit and earthy character. Flavor is balanced and unified. Yeasty spice adds a nice touch in the finish. As it warms a smokey roasted quality is retained on the pallet."
"A very good Doppelbock and worth seeking out. Big ABV limits consumption but I will definately buy this again when I feel like a big malty beer."
"A very nice doppel from Tucher."
"D- I drank a pint and didn't need more in a sitting."
"PROST!!"
"Overall, this was a great doppelbock and seemed to become even better with each sip. One of the best doppels that I've tried."
"D: A fantastic instantiation of the style. The nose put me off a bit at first, but as it warmed up, really grew on me. Note to self, keep the fridge stocked with this."
"A great doppelbock by Tucher. Enjoyed it chilled in my Duvel chalice. Poured a clear, reddish brown with a little head. Smelled of candied fruit, some caramel and a bit of toffee. Taste was similar, nicely balanced with syrupy viscosity and a warming finish. A hardy brew that I coud enjoy after any fine meal."
"Pours a slightly viscous dark chestnut with nice clarity and a relatively short head that fades to a swirly cap. Richly malty aromas, with toffee, cinammon, caramel, and even a touch of mint. A bit bready on the end and not hot at all. The taste is equally malty, and even a bit winey. A little thinner than one might expect, but very smooth. The maltiness has notes of raisins, chocolate, light spice, and a bit of herbalness. Nice. Drinks well, but it is rich, although quite smooth. Also, unlike the nose, the taste has a little bit of alcohol heat as well. Still, a very nice Doppelbock."
"Into a nonic pint glass, pours a dark russet color with mahogany hues, not much head to start and fades to just a ring, a little bit of spotty lacing but not much. The aroma gives a lot, rich caramels and bready malts, some toffee, some nice stuff. But its much better to drink, a range of delicious things going on. There are the rich malts of caramels, of toffee, the fruits dark and juicy, some sweet molasses and perhaps a touch of chocolate. The mouth is nicely carbonated, very fine and even, smooth, clean, good body. This is a fine beer, one I should revisit soon."
""
"Picked up a half-liter bottle at the local liquor store. Smells of caramel and molasses. Pours to a dark rusty brown with a tremendous head. Taste is very sweet and malty with a slight flat bitterness. The AC is very evident in this beer and is present throughout. This is a very thick beer almost good enough for pancakes or ice cream? Taste is mostly consistent throughout. Nothing real complex but very flavorful. Too sweet for my tastes but a very good beer for its style. Carbonation is just right. Drinkability is high but watch the AC. Don't drink too cold or the true flavor isn't evident."
"Overall, this is a wonderful bier that never disappoints. Great taste, attractive look, and just a wonderful bier."
"Nice carbonation in this brew shows as the pour gets you three fingers of foamy deep tan head. Bubbles hiss as they slowley fade. Body is an attractive blackish brown with hints of ruby when held to light. Nose is spicey and rustic with woodsy malt and dark sweet notes. Maybe hints of banana bread. A mellow malty sweetness enters the mouth with minglings os belgium waffles, toasty vanilla and over ripe bananas. Warms the belly well and tells of the 7.2% alchol without being obtrusive at all. This is not overly malty and thick as some bocks are. Very enjoyable and nicely drinkable. Mouthfeel is slightly thick but only because the taste buds cry for more."
"The mouthfeel suffers from the disappearing head, leaving it a bit flat halfway through, sadly. This is a pretty good doppelbock, but in my estimation a good step below Sam Adams, Spaten Optimator, Weisenstephaner, and even Sprecher. It certainly accompanies spicy cheese and crackers very well, and is on the whole good. Yet the wheats from Tucher captured my palate more than Bajuvator. Good, not great."
"D - A very drinkable brew indeed. It's darkly fruity, rummy, a bit boozy, sweet, yet really tight and focused. Not bad at all!"
"D: The alcohol comes out enough to serve as a reminder that this is one of the bigger brews. It's a nice standby, after a hearty meal while watching a movie... like many of the style, it warms well, so it can be enjoyed for a while, and return for another."
"Highly recommended."
"Pours a clear but very dark ruby with minimal head. Nose is sickly sweet with a strong caramelized sugar with extremely heavy malt tones. Flavor is smooth and deep. Wood tones. Malt tones. Strong sugar present. Feel is nearing syrupy. Definitely drinkable. Leaves an almost smoked flavor on the aftertaste."
"Overall, a tasty brew. I was underwhelmed at first, but this got better the farther I got into the glass."
"Overall, a very smooth yet strong doppelbock. A treat for both the beginner and aficionado."
"Poors a dark brown with a beige surface lace and ring. The nose is of rock candy sweetness, roasted malts, slight molasses, and some tart fruits. The sweetness in the flavor is more tame than the nose and earthy roasted grains with flashes of dry to charred malt notes balances some of the tart fruit character echoed from the aroma. Some tongue tingling anise peppery notes late in the swill and linger on the palate for a bit. Very nice rounded, full mouthfeel and an even better creaminess for carbonation level. Some tartness, roasted grain and sweetness left for the finish. This was really enjoyable from beginning to end."
"D - This is a very easy to drink beer I could drink this all night"
"Overall: excellent first beer in Germany 2007!!"
"D - A good representation for the style. Worth a try if you're in a Doppelbocking mood."
"Hizzah!"
"One of the easiest drinking dopples I have tried. Seems a bit ""lighter"" than my favorite, Celebrator. Good change of pace."
"Overall - Another excellent and nicely balanced German Doppelbock... recommended..."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep mahogany with a thin, creamy looking off-white head. Smell is quite malty with a harmony of roasted and caramel malts blended with a slight fruitiness. Taste is similar to the nose; very malty with a slight alcohol bite that seems to balance the sweetness of the beer and just a touch of fruitiness that lingers on the palate. The beer feels viscous in the mouth but drinks like water, possibly a very dangerous combination at 7.2%. I'd have to say that this is a good example of a Dopplebock and overall an enjoyable beer."
"D - A very good dopplebock and yet another good beer from Tucher."
"This was a nice doppelbock. It looked especially delicious, with its darker and cloudier than normal dark red bronze body. The foamy cap was khaki in colour and stuck around for a good 45 seconds before falling to become a 5mm thick blanket over the liquid's surface. Yes, this is a beautiful doppel to look at. I can't wait for doppel weather to return! Smell is plenty of caramel and toasted cereal, this guy is all malt, for certain. Taste, sadly, while very nice indeed, is very average for the style. I was hoping for so much more from this one. Mouthfeel is quite lovely, as well, being very solid, and while not exactly what I'd call ""thick", it's certainly full bodied. While the taste did in fact leave a little to be desired, I think I'll still go back for more of this when the leaves start to change colours again!"
"Overall this is a pretty nice beer. Not the most balanced flavor and there is an initial burn going down. A tasty doppelbock though."
"Dark cola brown with an initial finger of khaki head that soon diminishes. Light aromas of charred figs, sugary dates, tobacco, cookie dough, and vegetal hops. Subtle, but complex. Notes of chocolate and dark fruits up front. Lightly roasted cookie dough. Some sweetness and a dash of smoke. Vegetal bitterness in the finish, with some residual sugary malt. Medium-bodied doppelbock seems a bit lighter feeling than others (a tad watery). A little bit undercarbonated too. Still, a decently-made example that goes down a little too easily!"
"Poured to a dark brown with reddish tint, and a tan head that lingered well and left good lacing. Aroma was malty sweet molasses, with hints of toffee, chocolate and roasted nuts. I could tell that this was probably not going to be my favorite. Flavor was dominated by the sweet molasses, and the consistency was syrupy thick. Finish was the same as you would expect from a spoonful of syrup. This beer was not particularly bad, just a little too sweet and thick for my liking."
"Overall, a doppelbock with lots of good strong interesting flavors. Solid."
"Overall: Admittedly, I am a big fan of the dopplebock style, but this one is just plain excellent. Its nearly the equal of Celebrator, and thats saying something. Highly recommended."
"D: Very good."
"A fine doppelbock."
"Very smooth, light, crisp and creamy dopplebock, pleasantly surprised at this one. Pours a beautiful head, and great, great lacing down the glass. Medium bodied, some chocolate and plummy esthers. Highly drinkable too. Pours, also, a deep dark color. A gorgeous looking beer that I highly recommend."
"**Scores are for 2011 review**"
"Drinkability: The thing that happened with me on this beer is that the 1 pint bottle didn't last long. Before I knew it, the beer was almost all gone. It's a good German Doppelbock that's worth a try and it's something that I would pick up again if I saw it. It's not as good as some, but it's better than most I tried."
"Drinkability: Good, but a little underdeveloped and thin for my tastes. This beer certainly has the balance of flavors, but not the richer mouthfeel and heavier malts appropriate to the style. In a lot of ways, this aspires to Salvator, though the latter is still a better doppelbock for my money."
"Pours a ruddy leather brown and blood, maron color all in one. A little bit o' head, but nothing to right home about. The smell s a very sweet roasted malt. Reminds me of daddies black licorice, as well as walking into an upscale tobacco store. The flavor defines in a more classical way, how a tobacconist would taste. Sweet and strong with a hint of more adult bitterness. But not hop bitterness."
"This offering pours a dark, dark amber with an outstanding pillow head. The smell is a strong blast of sweet malt that is very inviting. The taste follows in the same footsteps with a sweet, malty quality that is not cloying. The chewy mouthfeel adds to the overall experience. Very nice onthe drinkability scale. It finishes nicely with a slight bitterness that balances the maltiness. A very nice offering."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable, but personally this beer was less impressive than I thought it would be. Worth a try."
"not my favorite but something I will revisit in the autumn. it has a great nose and looks fantastic but the flavor doesn't seem to hold up to the same standard, it finishes with a nice sweetness like many DBs but not sweet enough to put you off."
"Brauerei Tucher Brau doesn't get near the credit that they deserve. All they do is put out quality beer after quality beer and I haven't found one yet that was anything less than delicious and insanely drinkable. Bajuvator Doppelbock is an exemplary version of the style and is well worth your hard-earned money."
"Overall, it's good enough to make me wish it were available around here."
"The taste is very similar to Spaten Optimator, cherry syrup with a pinch of roasted nuts thrown in. Tastey."
"Pours a mahogany brown with some slight ruby highlights and a thick, creamy tan head that retains well enough. The aroma has a nice malty sweetnesss of caramel and molasses to start off, along with dark fruits (fig, prune, plum), mineraly and floral hops, roasted malt and a hint of alcohol. The flavor also comes out swinging with a big malty sweetness of caramel and molasses, along with a slight roastiness, some dark fruits (fig, plum, raisin), chocolate, honey, burnt bread, herbal and mineraly hops and cream. The mouthfeel is smooth and incredibly creamy, with light carbonation and drinkability is excellent with nary a trace of alcohol. A very enjoyably dopplebock, smooth and rich and not cloying with no trace of alcohol."
"A well made dopplebock. Pours out to a dark brown color with a short lived head of white foam. Lacing is present, as is a lower level of carbonation. Aromas of roasted malts, grains and hay fill the nose. Not overpowing, but noticeable. Taste is good; flavors of smokey malts, buttery and dry wheat, un sweetened cocoa and some caramel notes. Nice. Mouthfeel was smooth, but could've been heartier. Still, pretty good consistancy, and easy to drink. This is a worthy German Beer. Worth trying."
"A very respectable Dopplebock, but not as explosive in terms of flavor that I look for. Appearance is a hazy, yeast-filled, flat brown leather. Aroma is definately enjoyable with a big caramel maltiness, but I wanted a sharper complexity with dried fruit and burnt sugar. The taste is very conisistant with other German dopples, but the maltiness was intercepted by some fusel alcohols that didn't smooth it out in the finish. Either way, a very nice dopplebock, but since there are so many other GREAT german dopples (i.e. Mahr's, Korbinian), I will prefer the others I have tried, and continue exploring the great world of Dopplebocks."
"A respectable member of the world of Doppelbocks. Definately worth a try."
"1 pint bottle. Pours out the color of cola, with a small head. The aroma is bread, caramel, and dark fruit. Malty, chocolate flavor. The flavor is sweet, but not cloying. A nutty flavor comes in at the middle, with walnuts the most noticable. Grape-like fruitiness. Mouthfeel is exceptional. So smooth and malty. Alcohol is well hidden. Low carbonation. This is a good dopplebock, but not quite up to the level of Salvator or Korbinian."
"Pours dark brown with crimson coming through when held up against the light. A good finger's worth of dense, off-white head with average lifespan and lacing. Sweet and malty in the nose, even when quite cold. Caramel and dark fruit notes are present. Malts, of course, dominate the taste, with a nicely-meshed mix of rich caramel/toffee and chocolate flavors. Hints of smoke and alcohol show up in the nicely lingering finish. The taste only got better as this beer (and I?) warmed, with nutty notes joining the party. I liked this beer from start to finish, but what impressed me most was the incredible smoothness that so perfectly complemented its richness. The mouthfeel was soft and smooth enough to make this a perfectly (and dangerously) drinkable beer, but without muting the complex flavors."
"Not bad. Good, not quite great, example of the style."
"Taste is a very interesting blend of fruits and malts. Strong grape flavors and a taste like bubblegum. Malty alcohol feel to this beer with a creamy mouthfeel. Syrupy and the alcohol is pretty strong. Really a good tasting beer that quenches the thirst and warms the stomach."
"Body is medium, or just south of. Not quite as chewy as Celebrator, but every bit as good. Drinkability is perfect. This beer is definately a pleasant surprise and DEFINATELY worth checking out. Under-rated IMHO."
"Label says 1 pint bottle, pour did not quite meet the 0.5L plimsoll line on the Tucher glass. Code notches on back label but they make no appreciable sense."
"Pours a dark mahogany/garnet red with a nice one finger tan, creamy head. Smell is surprisingly malty and grainy, as is the taste. I was expecting more of a caramel malt profile, but this reminded me more of an english porter, similar to the St. Peter's Old-style I had yesterday, than a dopplebock. Mouthfeel is almost harshly carbonated, but it's tolerable. Overall an interesting beer, seems a little out of character for its style, but still enjoyable. Worth a try I suppose."
"The 500 ml. brown bottle was similar in packaging to many other German imports, and the labeling was consistent with other Tucher products, which seems to be another German trait. After uncapping, pouring the beer into a mug revealed a clear reddish brown body with a foamy head of fizzy carbonation. The presentation was clean and typical of the style. The aroma was sweet brown sugar, honey, and Munich caramel malt. The taste was sweet and soothing with dates, raisins, raw sugar, and figs, with a slight bitter herbal hop flavor, and faint smoke. Alcohol warmth was clearly evident, but did not overwhelm. Thick tongue coating mouthfeel was very satisfying, and was followed by a drawn out bitter sweet aftertaste, with a touch of pepper. It was a sipper for sure, but an elegant and restrained one."
"A terrific dopplebock. Traditional to classic style, this beer looks thick and viscous. Solid brown with ruby highlights, has decent carbonation that formed a tan head that persists nicely. Smells very malty and sweet. Also smells toasty, bready, yeasty, fruity and nutty. Tastes syrupy sweet with figs, dates, prunes, and a bit chocolaty. Alcohol comes through a bit red wine-like. Becomes a bit tart and comples through the body. Nutty and molassas remain through the finish. Also finishes a bit alcoholic, medicinal, and bitter."
"Drinkability is good starting to enjoy this style more now then I did in the past. Very tasty would recommend this one to everyone, enjoyed it very much."
"A good doppelbock, but I've had better. Pours with little head, accurate to the style. Slightly paler than I expected. Good smooth carbonation. Sweet, malty smell. Taste has mild dark fruits, candied sugars, molasses and maybe some figs. Kinda thin in the mouthfeel. Overall a pretty good doppelbock, but there's many out there that are better in my opinion."
"Overall, I would say that this is a fine example of the style. I've had better, but I've had a lot worse as well."
"Drinkability: A first class doppelbock that makes for a wonderful sipping experience; doesn't have the cloying sweetness of some others in the style"
"This is a good Dopplebock to start with if you've never had one before. I've had some others that seemed to light or the flavors just didn't meld. Tucher is right there. A nice earthy, malty aroma compliments the copper colored brew. The creamy tan head hold on right til the end. Some dopples seem to be somewhat sweet, but not this one. And, at 7.2 abv, I can handle three of these at a sitting. That's with some chow of course. I had this dopple with a soft shell crab sandwich at one meal and with a bowl of bisque at another. This beer pairs well with just about everything. A lot of people rave about Salvator, and it is good, but I would take this one first."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a 2 finger head that falls to a healthy coating over the beer. The nose is raisiney and bready, lacking the sweet molassesy charachter. I like that. The flavor is Right there with the nose. Good mellow dark fruit with a chewey yeasty-bready character that fits really well. The feel is thick, with a creamy character and a very moderate carbonation. I like this one. The flavors are mellow and balanced. I like the way this sits on the tongue. Very well built."
"Deep clear brown color with orange highlights, and a thick light brown creamy head that recedes slowly into the glass as a clingy lace. The nose is toffee up front followed by candy-apples. Caramel, caramel, caramel. That is what the aroma screams to me. Wonderful malty flavor up front. Its almost like biting into a caramel square. The toffee comes on later. This is like dessert in a glass. The hops show up late with a mild citrus character that exists to brighten up the flavors. Nice smooth mouth feel and very drinkable. Great beer."
"Raisin, molasses flavor hit the palette first with dark malts bringing up the rear. This doppelbock felt good, a good carbonation level. At 7.2% I thought this was quite drinkable, a great starter for the Superbowl."
"Pours a dark copper color with a sustaining, fluffy tan head. Husky malt aroma with subtle yeasty notes and some vinous fruitiness. Malty, bready and rich. Some subtle notes of chocolate and mixed berry nuances show up in the taste. Light nutty yeastiness. Husky malt astringency mid-palate. Quite nice. It seems nicer than the first time I tried it. Certainly a quality doppelbock that is a little on the husker side. Very impressive and sure to revisit."
"Dark red wine hue with a thick, bubble bath head that is dedicated, creating a decent cap over this fine beverage. A wiff of malts on the nose, coupled with some toasted bread notes. A very velvet-slick smoothness, a tasty palate that includes caramel, roasted malts, cotton candy and plums; welcoming flavorings of brandy, raisins and cognac make this a tasty treat. Tender hops, but dont seek them out; a belly satisfying warmness perfect for a cold winter night. Black licorise, fresh baked bread, toffee and butterscotch round this out and make it one darn tasty doppelbock. Tasty, chewy and very rich; absolutely incredible!"
"Quite drinkable. Only $1.99 for what appears to be 500ml but is labeled 1 pint."
"Got this one for a dollar. How bout that? Darkish brown color but still transparent, not much head to speak of as this beer is mostly a malt extravaganza. Smells very sweet, like a piece of chocolate cake. Taste is pretty similar to the smell; nice and sweet, very roasty and malty. I don't really taste any hops in this one, which is ok for this style, but there isn't a lot of balance to this beer. Feels thick in the mouth, creamy. This is a good beer to have after dinner or something, but not one that is easy to drink all night. A pretty solid brew but a little too sweet for my liking."
"This was definitely one of the lighter dopples I have tried and it didn't really have that German Dopplebock characteristic that most have. It was full in body but not thick and syruppy. There was some caramel but lots of yeasty nutty flavor. Finish was dry and quick. Not really that impressive but not bad either."
"Pours a very dark brown with a head that fades away quickly. Huge malty aroma, and the first taste is a lot of malt, with some sweetness from the alcohol. Medium body, with lowish carbonation. Long lasting sweet aftertaste. Excellent example of the style, on the malty sweet end of the range."
"This was a thoroughly enjoyable beer."
"Rich mahogany color. Head is nonexistant, rather disappointing. Aroma is huge. Sweet bread dough, caramel, toffee and molasses. Taste is sweet with chocolate, creme brulee-like caramelized sugars. Notes of thick toffee, caramel and molasses come to the forefront. Liquid sweet holiday bread. Alcohol is slick and warming. Mouthfeel is substantial, even grainy. Carbonation is low level. The end of this brew is a little like a flat cola. A decent doppel but not in the same class as most German doppels or many US brewed for that matter."
"Nice dark amber body with a good head of beige foam. A heady aroma of alcohol and a sweet malty/caramel scent. The alcohol grabs the back of your tongue and demands attention. While the sweet malt/caramel flavors settle in on the tip of your tongue. At the end there seemed to be a light liqorice to the finish. A heart warming and welcomong drink."
"Like a creamy dessert. Very malty and creamy yeast. Syrupy but thin. Not a top 50 beer but refreshing at end of summer night. Beats a coffee. Not much else there. Brown with malt cream dark cloud head. Aroma is alcoholic kick with caramel toffee and yeast."
"Appearance- Cloudy Brown Coca Cola colored with off-white head. Sweet malty aroma and a sweet caramel/chocolate taste with some hint of dried dark fruit. Tastes a little cough syrupy. Full smooth mouthfeel, a pint goes down nice but I wouldn't drink several at a time."
"One of the better doppels, not quite in the class of Celebrator, but probably as good as any of the rest. Pours darker, ala Celebrator, and has similar chocolate-like flavor. Not as much body or taste, however. This one is hard to find around here, but I grab it every time I go by the one store that has it. Any doppel lover who hasn't tried it, seek it out."
"Dark brown with a creamy head, this beer has a delicious aroma of sweet, chocolatey malt. The flavor follows through, a caramel maltiness, with a rich creamy mouthfeel. Not as strong or rich as many German Doppelbocks, but definitely as tasty. Highly reccommended."
"Can Germany make a bad Doppelbock? Another great Doppelbock, malty and sweet without being cloying. Complex flavor while remaining easy to drink. Pours a deep red-brown with a thin off white head. Rich fruity aroma with bready, caramel malt. Flavor of raisins, cherries and plums. Bready malts, caramel, and a restrained bitternes. Good full body. Great beer."
"A deep red colored wheat dopplebock with a malty aroma accented with sherry-like notes. Sweet caramel malt flavors predominate, body is fairly full and the finish seems rather dry for the style. The carbonation seems a little lower than other wheat beers. There's some nice raisiny notes that I normally associate with a Wee Heavy. Smooth, strong and malty, this beer would frighten hopheads, but on this cool evening, the malt if fortifies and the alcohol warms me up nicely."
"Zum wohl!"
"A very deep mahogany body reveals ruby highlights when held to the light, and its foamy tan head holds well but eventually drops to a wide, creamy collar and whispy surface covering. The nose displays toffee-like caramelized sugars and lightly toasted bready notes. It's medium-full body and very fine carbonation lends it a velvety texture in the mouth. The flavor offers a luxurious maltiness that's fairly complex with notes of caramel, toffee, plum, honey, brandy-soaked cake, dried dark fruit, light powdered cocoa and some very subtle leafy hops. The rich, and somewhat sweet malt character is perfectly balanced by a firm bitterness that remains in the wings as it crosses the palate, but then combines with the alcohol to dry out the finish. Some malty notes of caramel and dripping dark fruit linger in the aftertaste. An classic example of the style that's quite rich and satisfying but also very drinkable!"
"Pours a mahogany color with ruby tinting. Small beige head doesn't stick around very long. Aroma is of molasses, butterscotch, prunes, and raisins. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with medium carbonation. Taste is molasses and toffee, with earthy hops to bitter. Munich maltiness is here in abundance. Finishes with a bitter toffee aftertaste. Lacks some complexity in flavor and aroma to be top five for style, but is very well done and quite enjoyable."
"Pours with a creamily thick tan head of large bubbles, with firm retention. A little sticky cling before the head starts to fade out to off-white swirlers. Color is of milk chocolate; beer appears murky, but with near-orange highlights at the perimeter. Aromas of light caramel and an oily, carob-like sweetness with a cake-and-frosting nosefeel. With agitation and warmth, savory nuttiness emerges and rounds out with the alcohol, suggesting hazelnut liqueur. Taste features more big caramel punctuated by spices--cinnamon, nutmeg. Very sweet but never cloying; root beer sweetnesses meld with the spice (and hops?) into sassafras, a taste that I just really like. Body a bit thin but well-carbonated; a firmness to the spicy yeast and again somewhat pastryish with a leafy finish. A real fine drinkability, at once rich and refreshing; perhaps more of a cool-weather warmer than a truly wintry brew. At the $3.50 I paid for a pint, this was a bargain. I will seek this again."
"The taste is largely fruit and yeast notes with malt in the background and alcohol noted throughout. This is not as heavy a Doppelbock as would be indicated by the darkness and the ABV. The feel is fairly solid and full, but not thick nor syrupy. Overall a good brew with decent drinkability despite the ABV."
"!"
"Pours a nice robust head that dissipates to a thick lace within a few a minute or two. Nice reddish brown color to complement the creamy lace. Plum brandy comes to the nose with a slight minty/earthy hop aroma. Taste of caramel and slightly biscuity with a sweet grape overtone. Overall malt dominates throughout with slight minty hop overtone. Coats the throat with a slightly syrupy mouthful."
"Here's a nice, medium-sized, dark yellowy/tan, noisy head. It's sitting on a deep, mahogany red/brown beer. Some arcs and spots of lacing. Woah! Pure molasses in the nose. Sweet, sweet malt. More sweet molasses in the front: yeasty, bready. Alcohol is evident when cool. Deep, deep malt fills the middle, leading to a pure malt finish. More alcohol, though it definitely fades with temp. This is an excellent malt monster: yeasty, bready... almost to the point of cheese at temp, but not in a bad way. Major cream. Awesome."
"Well, this is a mottled review. The beer was completely flat...the bottlecap seal was leaky. This beer pours out clear, yet very dark brown, mahogany in color, much darker than other dopplebocks I've had. Their is no head, lacing or retention secondary to the lack of carbonation. The aroma is vinous and sweet, like a port, with an intense smell of prune juice, raisins, maple syrup, rotting black cherries, vanilla extract, and a hint of dark molasses...wow..this reminds me of Sam Adams Triple Bock. Despite the heavy aroma, the mouthfeel and body are suprisingly light, and the sugar content is less than expected. The bitterness is extremely mild, and the mouthfeel is smooth. There is a distinct hint of smoke towards the finish. There is a pleasant warming sensation as it goes down the tube, but the lack of carbonation feels gross. Despite this, I can tell this is a quality brew and am excited to try a fresh bottle. Update to follow..."
"Overall Impression: Just a bit too sweet. The malt is good, but in my humble opinion, it needs some more hops to even out the balance. I don’t want to give the impression it’s a bad beer, there are some nice qualities, roasted malt, a nice aroma, but just not the top of the style."
"Pours a solid, dark brown with a bubbly tan head. Produces noticeable lace. Not as aromatic as I'd expected. Mix of malt and hops in the smell...but not as intense a characteristically fruity-malty smell as I'd expected. Taste is not-too-sweet malt. Slightly metallic. Nice prune-like fruitiness though the taste. Big, chewy mouthfeel and very drinkable. Again, a solidly good dopplebock."
"I thought this beer was a bit flat, but full of flavor and rather drinkable for its style."
"Pours a deep brown with some velvety red tinge to it,aroma is sweet and a little nutty.Taste is sweet and velvety with some very roasted flavors.A very sweet and roasted malt flavored brew wich is real nice.A real nice doppel thats not to seet but very tasty."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine light brown bubbles and a semi transparent dark brown body. With a mild malt aroma, this beer starts slightly fizzy with roasted caramel notes and a smooth finish. The head left a nice lacing. This is not a bad Doppelbock, but there are better ones out there. You can taste the alcohol in this brew after only a few sips."
"Great beer. This beer pours a dark brown color with some lighter hues around the edges. It has a moderate head and moderate lacing on the glass. The aroma has hints of alcohol with a very sweet malti-ness - very pleasant (possibly caramel?). The taste is pretty complicated, but it is perfectly sweet and full flavored. The alcohol is somewhat noticeable in the flavor, but only to the extent that you notice a very slightly dry aftertaste. This is a great beer and I would recommend it to anybody. I've liked every Tucher product I've tried."
"A fantastic dopplebock from Nürnberg. This beer pours a deep mahogany with a soft white head that reduces to small wisps on the surface of the beer. The aroma is filled with molasses, raisins, wine-like notes, all followed by a malty caramel aroma and noble hop note....very nice. The taste is complex: both sweet and caramel at the fore, followed by molasses and a nice hop bite. The alcohol makes its presence know too...but very subtle. The mouthfeel is chewy and full, but not filling. I was very impressed with this beer, which is unfairly overshadowed by its Munich cousins."
"This brew poured a tan head with small-medium bubbles. The lacing was sparse on the sides of my mug. It had a red-amber body. It had a sweet aroma to it. It had a smooth taste and flavor. There was no bitterness noted with this brew. Not the best Dopplebock that I have had so far, but not the worst either."
"This beer pours a beautiful mahogany that is clear and dark. The tan head is moderately lived. The nose is a sweet malt with barely detectable hops. The taste however, is very complex. Somewhat smokey even wooden undertones. The taste is crisp at first with a rush of sweet malt followed by mid level hoppiness and tinged with a slight taste of alcohol that later warms an empty stomach. The mouthfeel is somewhat silky and pleasant. There is a long lived effervescence here too as a long stream of bubbles continuously arise. A very enjoyable and palatable beer."
"Drinkability/notes: A profoundly excellent beer. Germany is noted for brewing excellence; surely this beer must be noted among its finest. The high alcoholic content may preclude this from being a good choice as a session beer."
"Brown with a reddish tinge - lots of sediment floating in the glass. Aroma of caramel. Sip surprises me mostly with the creamy smooth body. I expect something more thick and viscous with this style of beer. Caramel notes with some bitterness and roasted flavor. More bitter and roasted flavors than usual in this style. I see reviews with a grape flavors but I didn't pick up any. I might have got some wine flavor though. Maybe I got a bad batch but not my favorite version of this style. Although I would certainly head towards this if I wanted something more creamy in the doppelbock style. After rating I can see that most would rate this beer a full point higher."
"Danka to Bierman9 for this fantastic brew I've never seen here in the midwest. German malt craftmanship at it's finest. This beauty pours dark brown with red/orange highlights and a snappy tan top. A malty aroma with a touch of brown sugar and dark fruit.The creamy texture is really nice, it has a malty/toasty/nuttiness in the finish that begs for more drinking. This one is a chocolate covered raisin like beer that's very addicting, is there really 7% alcohol in there? Can't really tell till I try to stand up, I said try to stand up! Oh well maybe someone can bring me another glass. WILMA....."
"reddish-brown lager. smell is of caramel, toffee, a little german spicy hop. taste is not very much to my liking - too much caramel without the accompanying sweetness. the feel is nice though - thick but without being syrupy. I could easily drink another. I just wish the sweetness was half-way between this and the sweetness of the SA double bock."
"Very dark brown with good clarity when held up to a bright light. A medium sized head is very creamy. The aroma is all serious maltiness, toasty, fruity....as is the flavors, chewy thick malty sweetness. I found it surprisingly drinkable given the 7.2% ABV. The alcohol lets it's presence known mostly in the finish and definitely in the aftertaste. I really enjoyed this doppelbock, me not being a huge fan of the style."
"great great doppelbock, imho. highly recommend trying this. it was also significantly cheaper than the Ayinger. a very high quality lager."
"Pours a very dark brown copper color with a tall and creamy light tan colored head that leaves sheets of lace on the walls of the glass as it recedes. Nose is sweet malts with notes of dark fruits and candied sugar. Full bodied and very smooth despite the high ABV. Taste is complex and continues to evolve as the beer warms. There are flavors of sweet malts, buttery toffee, semi-sweet dark chocolate, hazelnut liqueur, sweet raisins, and a flavor similar to rum cake. Very tasty. This is a great doppelbock. Im just sad that I dont have another bottle of this in the fridge."
"Milk chocolate brown color with a light brown head. Has a rich, malty aroma with bits of chocolate. A bit of alcohol is in the nose as well. The flavor is sweet, rich and malty, somewhat bready with figs. It flows to a sweet, alcoholic finish. This is a full-bodied beer that is easily drinkable. A very good Doppelbock."
"A thinner version of a Dopplebock, malty and smooth with a chocolate overtone. It is dangerous as it is highly drinkable but also very alcoholic which is not notice at all through the brew. A great beer for spring and winter when it's a bit cold outside to take off the winter chill."
"A beautiful deep crimson color, poured with a head that didn't last and left no lace. Nose was raisiny and caramel. Good malt flavor with the hops in the background. Very smooth, medium bodied and even a 500ml bottle is easy to finish. An exceptionally good doppelbock. Found at the Sunset Grill in Allston, MA."
"Prosit."
"The finish is quite long and features lots of burned sugar bitterness, eventually giving way for notes of bread pudding and wheat germ."
"58"
"16 oz. bottle. This beer is a beauty. Clear dark ruby-brown color, foamy, fluffy head, off-white, and inviting. A butterfly with sore feet, would even like this one. Perfectly sweet roasted carmel maltness dominate the nose. Same sweetness tasted throughout the bottle, lots of carmel malt, noticable alcohol finish. Medium body, slightly thinner than the celebrator, less bitter also. Easy to drink very nice dopplebock. IMO,  I would list them 1.Celebrator 2. Tucher  3. Salvator. Delicious, sweet, and inviting."
"mountains of malt here.  more along the lines of a sammy's doppel rather than a celebrator, optimator, or salvator. it has a buttery smooth mouthfeel that neutralizes the spice...and hides the alcohol punch quite well.  not too complex and layered which allows it to slide down much too quickly, scoring it high in drinkability.  one can detect the more choco/caramel hints rather than fruitcake overtones.  pretty damn good if you ask me."
"Sure, its a dopplebock.  But that's only the beginning."
"Dark ruby in color.. with a distinct outer grey ring of foam.  Creamy lace. Slightly musty/sweet smell.  Lots of gas on the tongue followed by sweet then nutty flavor.  Sweet/bitter/dry finish."
"Bajuvator:  Deep garnet color, with a light tan head and a head so dense that a tiny drop of it rolled around the top of the foam for at least a minute.  Sweet malt aroma.  Wow, very nice think chocolate malts with a nice sweet after glow.  Sweet long finish with a warm alcohol rolling all the way down.  Excellent, as good a doppelbock as I’ve ever had, and I even like the name."
"Malt and more malt.  Gigantic caramel presence, backed up by the hefty 7.2% abv.  Certainly lives up to the designation ""strong"" doppelbock.  Still, quite smooth and easy to drink.  I had difficulty getting a good feel for any underlying complexity, and the beer tended to be a little one-dimensional.  A quality doppelbock, just not my favorite so far."
"Rich and creamy with a wonderful malty palate, slight chocolate finish. Very impressive."
"Classified as a ""Malt Liquor"" on the bottle, for legal reasons, but we all know better than that."
