"Nothing wrong with that beer.  Flawless, although not spectacular."
""
"Brown/ dark red color pour.  Off white head rose and retreated to a ring and left behind spotty lacing.  Aroma was of molasses, honey, malts, and roast.  Taste was of molasses, burnt sugar, roast, and a caramel sweetness.  Mild carbonation with a somewhat creamy mouthfeel.  Overall, a very good beer, but, the dopplebock style never really works for me."

"Overall : Weihenstephaner is in my opinion the absolute best brewer on planet earth. I haven't had a beer from them that I have disliked, only liked some more than others. This is right up there as a world class beer. Smiling from ear to ear. Absolutely love."
""
"Overall, doppelbock - yes, awesome to me - priceless. So worth my money."
""
""
"Nice, rich, malty dopplebock. Deep malty / molasses nose...rich, deep, sweet taste that stays with you long after the swig. A superb beer to sip on a cold winter or spring evening...a big girl and a real treat"
""
""
"Lots of malt and sour cherry, hints of coffee on the nose, not a lot of body or head but that's to be expected. Pretty good overall, but the maltiness limits me personally to one bottle at a time."
"Pours a dark brown, root beer color with a very light brown head that disappears quickly. Very faint nose but dark malt notes predominate. The taste is amazing, perfectly malty with nutmegy and brown sugar notes. One of the tastiest and most balanced hyper-malty beers I've had. Mouthfeel is middle to heavy weight with a slight amount of ""chew"". Wonderful!"
"O: What a beer. Tremendous flavors and mixture of all the layers of complexity. That is what I personally love about the style. It's not necessarily the flavors themselves but how they blend. The sweet, to bold, to bitter, progression of the drink is amazingly executed. This one is certainly going in my top 5 beers I've tasted.  It's a heavy drinking beer but damn if it isn't enjoyable all the way through."

"A deep, dark, opaque ruby-mahogany in color (with a cream/caramel head), this beer is strong on the coffee and cocoa notes (most especially the former), both in the aroma and the flavor. There is a malty, brown-bread body to the flavor, with a dried fruit sweetness behind it all. It has all the richness that a dark beer usually has, but sits much lighter than it looks like it will. The feel is smooth, yet lightly effervescent. It pairs just as well with rich food as it does with drinking by itself. I'm not usually a dark beer man, but this I could drink pints of."

""
"I've never had a doppelbock before so I didn't know what to expect. I have to say though it was very good. I would have given the smell higher rating but it wasn't very pronounced but did smell good. The taste is what really matters. It has a perfect sweetness to it with pretty much no bitterness whatsoever. It looks like a porter or stout in the glass but definately does not taste like one. I will be buying this again"

""
"Much attention gets paid to the Hefeweizen, but don't look past this doppelbock.  I am a big fan of the doppelbock style, and this is a good example of one."
""
"500ml bottle poured into a tulip glass-pours dark reddish brown with 2 fingers of pale beige head and lacing travels all to bottom of glass; rich yeasty brown bread and malt smell and taste with smooth feel on the mouth-not too heavy but still had to crank up the AC to enjoy in West Africa"

"Weihenstephan is definitely one of my favorite brewery's and personally I don't think anyone makes a better wheat beer so I was very much looking forward to this one. The beer was a nice one with plenty of malt sweetness and dark fruits coming through, sure it didn't quite match the brewery's flagship hefeweizen but it was still a very nice doppelbock with enough going for it to make things interesting. A decent beer well worth picking up but it's not one of the brewery's best offerings, mainly because they have already set the bar so high."
""
""
""
"One of the best I've had! I will have to try this next to Salvator, see which is better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An impressive specimen of maltiness. And the toasted nut likeness is pretty wild!"
"Good example of the style. A bit too thin for me though. My favorite doppelbock is Sam Adams double bock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a beautiful doppelbock example, a tour de malt with virtually zero hop flavors involved. A little additional dark fruit complexity to the flavor profile, and a slightly thicker mouthfeel, and this would approach perfect 5 territory for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Incredibly flavor-drenched and perfect for a chilly late-fall weekend.  From a guy who doesn't ordinarily like bocks, this is a mind-blowing brew.  Weihenstephaner is magical."
""
""
""
""
"All-around solid. Intense but very drinkable. Smooth and frothy but crisp. Rich, flavorful, and satisfying with lots of delicious malt and dark fruitiness. The 7.4% ABV is very well hidden."

"Overall - This is an excellent beer from an outstanding brewery, one of the best in the world. I do not think this doppelbock is as good as Ayinger Celebrator, even though it is rated higher, but it is an excellent beer nonetheless. Condor recommended and approved."

"One of the best beers I have ever had.  An excellent Dopplebock and it nails every category: Aroma, Appearance, Taste, Palate and the Overall."

"O: Roasty sweetness. Other reviews have compared the aftertaste to syrupy malt followed crusty banana bread, which is spot on in my opinion. Wonderful."
""
""
""
"I haven't had a doppelbock in some time, but this beer is so wonderful. One should never doubt a Weihenstephaner product, and this is no exception."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The roasty malt comes in sweet then a slight crusty banana bread takes over. The alcohol is completely hidden. This and Salvator are my favorite doppelbocks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - the perfect breather for a palate that's hop-obsessed. Very filling too; one of these and I'm done for a good while. I recommend it though!"
""
""
""
"Review according to BJCP2008 guidelines (style 5C). AROMA: strong sweet malt aroma. very slight plum aroma and moderate alcohol aroma. No hop aroma. APPEARANCE: clear dark brown with ruby tint. persistent medium head of beige color. head retention reduced maybe because of high alcohol content. TASTE: rich malt flavour with slight notes of dried grapes. smooth impression from alcohol and no hop flavours. very low bitterness with malt dominating the flavour. PALATE: medium body with moderate carbonation. smooth without astringency. OVERALL: a very nice doppelbock with a médium smooth body."
"O: This is an excellent beer and one that I am glad I finally had the opportunity to try (I seemed to miss picking it up year in year out). Wonderful flavors and a really great beer from an excellent brewery. Easy to drink and enjoy with well hidden alcohol."

""
""

"Overall – This is a very flavorful doppelbock with a very easy drinking and crisp feel in light of its abv. of 7.4 %. This is one nice drinker and one I will certainly come back to again."

"Pours a nice deep dark brown pinkish purplish color with a great foamy head. Smells so malty and sweet. Does not taste sweet however. Very crips and refreshing with great body. Not much bitterness at all and very clean. I did not detect much fruitiness as others have noted. A very easy beer to drink and a great one at that."
""
""
"Overall a great beer with near ideal doppelbock qualities: not too sweet, clean flavors that are enticing and clean mouthfeel."

"The bottle is so us usual and beautiful, I had to try it. Poured from a bottle into a Pilsner, at a temperature between the fridge and room temp. Color is a crystal clear strawberry red with the slightest brown tinge when held up to intense light. Thin, tan head, nice lacing. Aroma is yeasty, with roasted malt and caramel sweetness, with mild floral hops. Flavor is again yeasty, roasted malt, toffee sweetness, with a slightly piney finish. Mouthfeel is medium thin, and a bit foamy. This is a style that I do not understand (doppelbock), so I am rating it just as an enjoyable brew and experience. On that basis, I will say it is a very good to outstanding lager, well worth sampling. And this one has a bear, not a goat on the label."

"Overall - An absolutely delicious beer that I would love to drink again. Due to being dark and on the heavy-side, I would see this a more of a winter beer than a warm weather beer. Almost a desert quality. I will be purchasing this beer again for sure! A great value for the money; I believe I spent less than $4 for the bottle."

""
""
""
""
"10/30/13 From bottle. Almost need a spoon with this. Malt up the nose and caramel on the tongue with a middling body & a lingering bitter-sweetness that tells of a well thought out concoction. The 7.4 ABV will force me to keep this new friend in perspective. (Like 'perspective' is what I'm here for.) A new Favorite."

"This is an excellent Starkbier which apparently translates in the import state (SC) as a malt liquor. The palate, appearance, and flavor are both very good, leaving only the weak nose as a detriment. I may be forced to buy a case to verify the weak nose"
""
""
""
"O - I want to rate it higher because of the brewery, and maybe it's exceptional for the style, but it's my first doppelbock, so I'll have to come back to it someday."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is certainly bold -- even sweet up front, with an underbelly of fruit below the thick and chewy maltiness of the toasty grains. And although this is probably a premier doppelbock in itself, I wasn't very impressed here. I'd say, stick to Weihenstephaner's hefeweizens as they are likely the best you'll ever taste."

"This is 2nd to only Celebrator for Dopplebocks for me. Just great stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very nice malt forward example of a doppelbock."
"i still prefer the lighter doppelbock style of Paulaner's Salvator, but this is obviously a great brew. a little like a good stout in a lighter weight form -- definitely toasted dark and raisiny"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours dark ruby red toward brown, tan head, some peppery and coacoa aromas. taste is raisin, fig, plum, good dark fruit profile. sticky sweet licorice notes, hints of spice, yeast and grape undertones, hint of sweet cherry, cinnamon notes. overall really smooth and complex"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, simply a delightful beer and certainly a classic of the style. I've enjoyed it a few times, but finally got around to reviewing it. A finer-drinking malt bomb you are very unlikely to find. I think I prefer Celebrator just slightly, but this is still delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - incredible doppelbock. Might be the best I've had."
""
""
""
"Overall: Weihenstephaner can do no wrong. This beer is a continuation of their world class beers."
""
""
""
"Dark brown with excellent clarity. Just a faint trace of off white foam is present. Brussels lacing. Strong aroma of malt in the nose. The body is a bit thick and sticky. The flavor is very dark malt forward. The finish is more malt and is fairly smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O - exceptional doppelbock. Better than I remember but I knew it was upper echelon all along."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Outstanding. A silken and ample malt with a perfect compliment of dark fruits and light chocolate. This is indeed liquid bread."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Clear mahogany pour with a two finger beige head with decent retention and nice lacing. The nose is sweet and malty with hints of caramel, brown bread, toffee, leather, and subtle dark fruit and chocolate. The taste is rich and malty with tons of sweet brown bread and nuts along with hints of molasses, toffee, chocolate, raisins, coffee, tobacco, and leather. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy with medium carbonation and a sweet, syrupy finish. Overall, a bit sweet for my tastes, but a flavorful interpretation of the style."

"Pours a very deep brown with about 1+- finger of a beige head that dissipates fairly fast. Just a bit of lacing with each sip. Smells very nice with hints of sweet caramel, malt with a touch of coffee. Taste is really good, just like the smell. Goes down very easy with no bitter aftertaste. I like Doublebock's and this one is no exception and didn't disappoint at all."
""
"o: Great dopple and a must try. They taste is subtle and is best server at just below room temp or it loses the best parts of tastes. not fridge beer for me but really close."
""
""
""
""
"O- Good beer, as Weihenstephaner seems to always make."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite the tasty doppelbock, although not good enough to make this a frequent indulgence for me, especially at the price."
""
"500mL / Weizen Glass"
""
"O: Awesome dopplebock. This is one of my go-to's for a kick ass German beer."
""
""
""
"O: Very similar to Ayinger's Celebrator, with higher carbonation and mocha taste on back end. Exceptional."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a doppelbock I can get behind. I haven't been the greatest fan of the style, nor have become one since this beer, but this is one that really showcases the great caramel/toffee malt notes without being super boozy. Alcohol warms, but does not overpower. A solid doppelbock and one I would gladly enjoy again."
"Overall: Amazing beer. I truly feel this beer deserves the ratings it has. I don't often say that. Delicious, dark, full in flavor and body. Would definitely buy again!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe it's just the doppelbock kick I'm on, but this is a top tier beer that has earned it's reputation. If I were to nitpick, I'd like a little heavier body and more pronounced flavors but anyone who enjoys bocks will find very little to complain about here."

"I was in Freising this spring and kept seeing the signs for the home of Korbinian. Weihenstephaner dominates this Munich suburb near the airport. I like malty Bavarian biers and truly enjoyed this selection. It is smooth & sweet but not too sweet. Great choice for after dinner. A delicious beer that I will enjoy again. Oldest brewery in the world and they got it right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I expected better from this brewery, but I am now remembering why I haven't had this beer in years. I will give it another try and rating in the future. I will be sure to try it on draft and on bottle from another supplier"
""
""
""
"O - I've tasted this a couple of times a year for a while now and it always blows me away, just such a well made beer, absolutely delicious drink, I usually consume it quite cold as I find it can get cloying at higher serving temps. A winner of a beer, Prost!"
""
""
""
""
"This is a fine example of a doppelbock all around. Excellent malt flavors with just the right edge of booziness. Balance, complexity, and sensory appeal in every aspect. This truly exemplifies the art of brewing in that being a big, rich, powerful beer it also remains easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) 7.4% alcohol? Never tasted it until of course I finished. A masterpiece, I will buy more..."
""
"Probably much better fresh back in the home country where the hops being more assertive. But still it stands at the top of the dopplebock hill."

"Drinkability : a good beer in the German style Doppelbock."
"Overall a fantastic brew. Wish I could get this in 12 packs here in the States."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would have again; worth trying if you have access to it."
""
""
""
"Overall - A big, bold, German Doppelbock. Similar, in flavor, to Ayinger Celebrator only sweeter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Maybe it is best to drink it with some cake or something similar. Personally,i don't feel it tasty,but good beer for the style."
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel on this is smooth and medium bodied."
""
""
""
"O - Very pleasant beer, I detected more of the alcohol after the beer warms up but it has enough sweet notes and dried fruits to help to cover it pretty good"
""
""
""
""
"4.3"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While the sweetness might turn some off (it's definitely one of the sweetest doppelbocks I have ever had), it is easy to drink and full of character. Worth consideration."
""
"A rich, golden brown with a two inch head. Thick looking. Strong bread, sour dough aroma - the hops comes through more than expected but still nice. The taste is completely different than the smell, full malt flavor, sweet plums. Medium to heavy body, leaves a slight stickiness on the lips. Overall: Best Doppelbock I've had to date. Makes me want to try more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, this one is really full of flavor. Nice complexity. A little on the sweeter side. A great beer for the fall/winter seasons."
""
""
"It poured a dark brown with a thick tan head that smelled of heavy malts and coffee. The first taste was heavy on the burnt malts and chocolate, and definitely stood apart from the doppelbocks I was familiar. The slightly sweet malts and coffee flavors come through on this nicely balanced beer. The Korbinian was deep and rich with a thick mouthfeel that stuck with the heavy bready brew. This is not a beer you drink quickly, but rather one you sit back and allow to consume you. The Korbinian was one of the best doppelbocks I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Just solid. Leaves a nice 'beer mustache' as an added bonus after a big sip too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A wonderful Doppelbock, tasty and easy drinking."
""
"Very complex beer, with lots of character. More dark fruit than expected. Great melanoidin presence."
""
""
"The just-a-touch of bitterness accompanies the creamy goodness of the beer with the initial taste, as stated, the last touch is bready and has minimal aftertaste, not overly sweet nor dry"
"Overall: A really great authentic Doppelbock. Great toasty malt taste with a good presence of dark fruit."
""
""
"o: this is a malt and chocolate bomb and i'm loving every sip of it. its rich, creamy, and smooth. such an easy drinker, with flavors that work great together. this doppelbock definitely worth you checking out"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark brown, very dark, with a small island of white foam. Brown sugar malty nose. Taste is a rich malty blend, slick, light sugar. Very minor carbonation makes it smooth. Milk chocolate layers underneath. Smooth and tasty."
""
""
"Overall: Just a fantastic Doppelbock."
"A complex beer and easily one of the best in the style."
""
""
"Overall: Very impressive doppelbock from Weihenstephaner and I'd expect no less. Definitely worth giving a try."
"Overall a good beer. I'll have to try to pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Solid beer. If you like doppelbocks, I assume you would be all over it. The only doppelbock that has amazed is Ayinger. It's worth a try, simply for the fact, that it's one of oldest and most consistent breweries in the world."
""
""
""

"Overall a blast of fruitcake and plumbs, figs, raisens. A very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, a superb Doppelbock. It's better not to serve this beer too cold in order to appreciate its finer subtleties as it warms up. A Pilsner glass is a good choice for the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Mainly a dessert beer but not too sweet that it wouldn't pair with a main course either, perhaps game meats like venison or even kangaroo. Also could work with char-grilled zucchini, mushrooms and eggplant for my vegan brethren."
"Overall-My first doppelbock and it certainly wont be my last. This beer sets the bar really high. I will definitely come back to it in the colder months,"
""
"Amazingly good doppelbock. Expect nothing less from this star German brewery."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. Very great doppelbock. American brewers need to take note of this beer. Highly recommended."

"O- Very good representation of the style. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Another really nice beer from this brewery. There is a lot of flavor here, I think the profile would make this a great beer for around Christmas time, as it reminds me of the types of cookies usually enjoyed that time of year. I could easily drink more of this."
"O- Its Oktober in July for me, and I'm loving it. Probably my fav of the style so far. Tried side by side with Celebrator and much prefer Weihenstephaner."
""
""
""
""
"This is a top-notch doppelbock, among the best I've had. Clean, sweet, rich, and flavorful, with excellent displays of dark fruit. Tough to beat."
"O: Like a little brother to the Ayinger Celebrator. If fasting German monks had a choice for which to sustain themselves on, the choice would be rather clear. The Korbinian would be lunch and the Celebrator would be dinner."

"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/30/2012. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apple, pear, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, light pepper, nuttiness, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity esters and dark malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big apple, pear, caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, biscuit, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, light fruits, brown bread, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of light fruity esters with a big dark malt balance; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent doppelbock! Great complexity and balance of fruity ester and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
"O: This is delicious! Its very balanced and somewhat straight forward but it nails the flavor components. /91"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a deep brown color with a light tan head on top. The retention is pretty good and there is a scattered lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is sweet and there is a grassy spice note also. The taste has some molasses, some bread, subtle Carmel and dark malts, and just a tinge of spice in the finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth, almost creamy. Overall it's a great beer, one of the best Doppelbocks I've had."
""
""
""
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Overall, I would say that this episode was really fucking stupid. Like, really stupid. Just awful. And Tasha was a bitch at the end. I'm glad I never saw this before. The dopplebock however, was quite good, as I would expect from Weihenstephaner. The price on these things continues to amaze me, so this beer will continue to be in my rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - did this side-by-side with Celebrator and actually liked this one a tad bit better. Can't go wrong with either though."
"Korbinian is certainly an interestingly complex brew with aroma and flavor profiles that are both ""all over the place"" and ""perfectly content"" all at once. Doppelbocks aren't my forte and I certainly haven't had enough to speak eloquently on them, but Korbinian is a pretty tasty brew, and certainly a good lesson in the style. Still worth a shot whether you are in tune with doppelbocks or not - at the price, you can't really lose."
""
""
""
""
"The beer was poured from the bottle into a mini-snifter glass, producing a color that was a brownish tinted black color. The aroma was malty with some grapey wine characteristics about the aroma. My initial impression of the taste was that it was too mild. It was malty, but too mild. The carbonation was modest enough to allow that taste to linger, but there was little to linger. The sides of the tongue are made away of a slight tart hop taste, but it is well masked. The texture of a doppelbock is pretty spot on, but the flavor is lacking. While this may be more true to the original version of the style, it does not stack up well against the modern version."

"God, what else is there to say about Weihenstephan? Everything they churn out is world class, and this one stands tall against it's often cited hefeweizen. It's an opposite drinking experience in many ways (in flavor, not quality), but it stands as juicy, thickened, and filled with all kinds of flavors that work so well together. In the bottle, it's a little bit more bitter and medicinal, but on tap, it's a bouquet of the best aromas the doppelbock style has to offer. I'll be tasting this one for days!"
"O - A wondeful doppelbock, one of my new favorites. Could be a top 5 beer for me. All the aromas and tastes of a quality doppelbock, but not overly sweet. Didn't get the bloated feeling, nor the sticky mouth like I do from some bocks. Highly recommend this brew!"
""

"O: A very nice Doppelbock. Lots of subtle flavors combine to create a great beer. Easy to drink, yet complex."

"I don't think I like doppelbocks so there's that. I should stop buying them. I'll give this a 4 because I understand it's pretty good despite my not favoring the style. I'm a modern, rational guy and can admit such things. This was real sweet. Too sweet for me. If a woman tasted like this it'd be okay to me but not a beer. It's like when you make tea but put too much sugar in and you're already in the car so you just drink it but you're like tomorrow remember to put less sugar in. Had this out of a pint glass, after a Stone Espresso Imperial Stout. That's a beer for me. This tastes like something young people would like. I may be getting old."

"I am glad I tried this beer, but it is NOT one I will buy again. There are just some weird smells and flavors here from whatever yeast strain they have used. Not nearly as good an example of the style as can be found out there."
""

"Complex flavors that let the fruity esters sing while the malts are bold but in a delicate way. Alcohol is undetectable and this drinks smooth. Perfect for an April evening."

"O-This is a good, nearly great beer. The flavors are sweet and intense, but not cloying or gummy. The feel is particularly well-suited to this brew. This is a nice, drinkable example of the style and perfect for a chilly fall or winter evening (even though I am writing on April 1...)."
" Complex and chock-full of character Korbinian is well-behaved for the 7.4ABV. An excellent German brew."
""
""
""
"It's brown with nice cherry tones and loosely packed large bubbles that are light tan and quick dissipating, leaving a lightly etched surface. Banana, vanilla, toast, caramel, touch of cola and gobs of nougat. Taste is plenty of malt, a touch of salinity, some sweet malts and bready dough. Seriously, this is a like a sweet dough pretzel - really dig the flavor, so unique and works really well. Medium on full bodied with moderate carb and a slightly wet finish. This is really well done."

"Grabbed this from my local whole foods. Normally I reach for the German wheat beers, but with it being March and the bock season I said why not. I was glad too. Originally cracked this open to offset the firey taste in my mouth from what I was cooking. Was taken aback as this wasn't what I thought it'd be. It was an excellent semi milky, sort of sweet, brown sugary brew. Brown in color as most bocks are there was a hint of malt in it, not the coffee, chocolate malt, but more of a toffee, carmely flavor. So smooth I didn't dare mix it with the rest of my spicy thai food dinner. Best doppelbock I've ever had!"

"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a tulip/pint glass, coded bottled date of 0442. This pours a dark brown on the edges and black in the middle color with a large foamy tan head. The smells are of dark malts, caramel, toffee, brown sugar. The feel is medium nice carbonination. The taste is pretty good, plenty of malts, brown sugar, toffee and caramel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Soft caramel and raisin notes up front not overly sweet kept in check by the hoppy herbal bite masked somewhat by the carbonation. Lively mouth with carbonation, yet silky smooth creamy mouthfeel as it rolls around. Slight nutty finish. This is a real nice drinking beer. It doesn't have the huge flavors of some American craft counterparts, but the complexity is layered and subtle; it drinks real easy."
""
""
""
"The beer is chestnut brown with a thin khaki hued collar. The aroma brings malt, yeast, light spice, brown bread. Rich and smooth with a mild sweetness. Hints of plums and raisins. A beautiful beer. Like every other Weihenstephaner brew I have tried, Korbinian delivers the goods. A great example of the style. A pleasure to sip and savor. I'll definitely be having this one again."
""
""
"O) This is a top notch dopplebock. No question about it, glad to recommend this beer."

"O: I love this brewery. This is a huge explosion of malty goodness that leaves your palate wanting more. I would love to have this in a six pack. A beer I will surely revisit."
""
""
""

""
"Overall: Just has that export feel about it. Maybe I'm getting too used to fresh American craft brews. This is not bad at all, though and the 7.4% ABV is hidden well."
"Drink-Weihenstephaner makes a good beer here. Flavorful, balanced and tasty. Has a bit of a quad like flavor with the raisins and fruits. Good value beer at $3."
"O: Not as good as Ayinger IMO but definitely a well balance and easy drinking beer. I’d gladly drink this again."
"I expected this to be good and it really is. Maybe not quite as complex as some of the great Dopplebocks but very flavorful and extremely drinkable. I would buy this again and suggest it to anyone that likes stronger German beers."

"500ml bottle. A deep amber/brown with a couple fingers of rich light mocha head. Foamy retention with loads of spotty lace. Smells sticky and burnt with fresh floral notes and earthy citrus flavors that emerge as this is agitated. The nose has a nice robustness to it. The taste is sticky sweet initially with notes of cocoa, caramel, dark roast and nuttiness. Citric hops really gives this a green tightness that then begins to take over the profile and leaves this dry and bitter on the finish but the sweetness does pick up again as this warms. The feel is medium to fuller with a firm sharpness up front and then more of a smooth texture the rest of the way. Tiny bit of warmth but this drinks nicley for 7%+. This was a really nice Doppelbock with the type of rich flavors and smooth feel that I look for in the style."

"Dark brown to amber in color, but clear. Tall sudsy tan head recedes to splotchy areas lacing. Smells are yeasty, light citrus and a sort of sourdough aroma. Taste is lightly sweet with no bitterness at all. A very subtle spice in the back and a light clove presence. A very small hint of sweet chocolate towards the end. Has sweetness to it but is also pretty dry at same time. Smooth and medium carbonation. This is very good and I'll look forward to having again."

"O - Korbinian is a roasty Doppelbock that develops more chocolaty, dry cocoa notes as the brew progresses for a bit of a twist on the style. It's not quite as clean as some other German versions but, this doppel is a great brew for any malt-lover."

""

"Overall a really great beer. Weihenstephan hits another home run."

"(O)- Overall, a fantastic Dopplebock from a classic brewery. Rich and sweet, but balanced well for smooth and easy drinking for the style."
""
""

"Overall: It's a good beer to have with sweet desserts or to sip at night and enjoy it all by itself. A very interesting and complex taste, plus great texture make for a wonderful experience. Another high quality product from ""The World's Oldest Brewery""."

"P.S. I wish 4.25 was an option for overall... Just saying."

"O: grew on me as I reached the middle of my glass (as is often the case.) The aroma and finish will keep this one in the back of my mind for a revisiting."

"An awesome beer. Probably the prototype for a great doppelbock. I would recommend this as anyones first beer into the style."

"Was really into this beer. I picked it up half by accident, but I would seek it out again. Tasty and smooth."
""
"O - My impression of this beer (other than ""Oh hell yes!"") was that if you tried to convert a stout-drinker to a dopplebock enthusiast, this would be the first step. This beer has a lot of the better qualities of heavy stouts, while holding true to the essential bock flavors. A fantastic brew all around."

"This beer is a wonderful doppelbock and I highly recommend it."

"Taste is super malty, giant, with a very syrupy, almost molasses body, and huge amounts of figs, plums, sugar, and rye bread in the finish. Incredibly delicious. Almost meal like. English style beers stand no chance. An insanely tasty beer. Super drinkable. Mouthfeel is creamy beyond belief. Such a great example of this style, and so affordable as well."
""
"O- this is a great beer, most doppelbocks seem to be so sweet that it lowers their drinkability. I could drink this one all day though. The flavors are well balanced and overall the best I've had of the style."
""

"Loved it and is a pleasure to drink during the colder months."

"Excellent brew. Style wise: 4.5 Personal : 4"
"Stark, eh? I hope that this has something to do with the Stark Fist of Removal as I have been very pink as of late with Oktober being Breast Awareness Month (Cancer) and I need more slack. No slack with respect to my pour, which resulted in two-plus fingers of thick, dense, deep-tan head with excellent retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was redolent with malt and I was afraid that it might be too sweet for my liking. Mouthfeel was thick, chewy and not as sweet as the nose had led me to expect. The taste was cocoa and dried dark fruits, This was a very smooth-drinking beer and I had swilled nearly a quarter of it before I came to my senses. Finish was semi-sweet, again, nowhere near as sweet as the nose led me to believe. This was, as the DME boys would call it, a ""sneaky"" beer. Proceed with caution!"
""
""
"Excited to find this after reading comparisons to Celebrator. Poured a very dark brown with minimal light brown/tan head. Some lacing as I worked my way through. Nose was sweet with caramel and a little roasted malt. Very enticing. Taste followed up with more sweetness - dark fruit, a sweet bread taste and definitely some type of chocolate. The chocolate was a little muted and tasted like really good and mellow cocoa. Full bodied with good carbonation. Very easy and enjoyable to drink, and absolutely lived up to the hype. Already looking forward to a doppelbock taste test with a few other favorites."

""

"O - Hands down the best Doppelbock I have ever had, primarily due to the fact that it isnt syrupy or too heavy, as many I have tried seem to be. Will be grabbing when I am in the mood for the style. Side note: possibly due to the light body, I enjoyed this beer when it was colder than the normal suggested temperature (more like the temp you would want a dark lager...yeah I know, not very ""beer geek"" of me)"

"Korbinian stays true to style without beating you over the head with it, which I very much appreciate. The mouthfeel is exceptional, lending a light, velvety texture to the brew. I've never been much of a fan of dopplebocks, but this is one of the finer ones I've come across, and certainly something I could see myself going back to if the mood strikes me. Just another testament to the excellence the Weihenstephaner folk put forth as a matter of practice."

"A well done, well balanced brew, nice and very modest."

""

"an outstanding doppelbock, one of the best in its class. pours a nice frothy amber brown color with some off white patchy lacing. it smells wood aged, but i dont think it is, lots of oaky tones amongst the sweet german malts and biting alcohol. a nice caramel and musky flavor is memorable in this beer, but it also has traces of smoke and peat, a really complex and warming brew. its got a great feel as well, velvet smooth, big body, and subtle but adequate carbonation. this is a perfect fall season beer, brilliant with grilled food, cigars, and college football. id recommend this baby to anyone who likes big malty gernam beers, this one is impressive."
""
""
"this is a great beer overall. great flavor, generous abv, great looking.. no reason to not try it at least once. (shocked it actually took me this long to finally try it)"
""
""
""
""
"O - this is a style I've not had in awhile but the ones I have had were quality beers. This offering from Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan is certainly among them. This is my first time having this (dont know what has kept me) but it will certainly NOT be the last."
""

"O - This beer is true to the brewery; first class. The only other beer in the style in contention is Ayinger's Celebrator, although it may be in second place..."

"Pretty light mouthfeel and the 7.4 abv is well hidden. Great value"
""

"Overall: This beer is just effortlessly good. One of the better dopplebock that I have drank in a long time. The consistancy from this brewery is really great. Every beer that I have tried from this brewery is awesome. The price point is always a fantastic value! $2.50 for a 500ml bottle! Stock up on beers from this brewery if you got a small beer budget!"

"Pours a brown color with a reddish hur if held directly in front of a light. The head will not go away. Caramel pervades on the nose as well as the palate. A touch of prune or something also makes an appearance. The hops don't really do much, but the carbonation does a little something to balance it out. Moutfeel is a little chewy - not something I particularly liked in this case, though not bad. All in all I'd say it's another good showing for this brewery and for the doppelbock style, although I think a few others have this beat."
"I apologize for a no-frills review, but sometimes a no-frills beer is exactly what hits the spot."
""
""
""
"Review from 4/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a dark semi-opaque brown with a small light brown head. Aroma of sweet malt and caramel. Nice dark malts up front with some smoke. Hints of molasses, root beer and a touch of hops. A light slightly flavored finish. Creamy medium bodied. Nicely made, as with all Weihenstephan beers. Prost!"
""
""
"O/D - A really nice Dopplebock. Not complex really, but well put together and pleasant the whole way. Great drinkability."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Once again, not disappointed Weihenstephaner has by far the best Doppelbock I have had. I don't want to hype this up but sure satisfying beer. It is a little bland on the smell but most Doppelbocks are to begin with, Salud!"
""
"O: Good flavors and aroma on this beer. Very smooth. You can just taste the quality in the beer...no off flavors."

"O- great dopplebock, very clean easy to drink, smooth yet with complex flavors, very enjoyable."

"O: Epic. A true paragon of the style. As good as Celebrator."
"Low B-"

"Weeeell, shit. This is fucking delicious. Remember the Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen? This it it's big brother with a nasty aggressive streak, masterfully hidden beneath good table manners but unmistakably NOT going to take any of your shit. It's creamy and rich (with a hint of the floral taste you get in that innocent little hefeweizen), and MALTY AS MILKBALLS. Milkballs conjure the wrong taste. Let me correct that: it's like you're a fucking sea urchin, huddled at the bottom of the deep, dark, scary ocean, and eating the sweetest, heartiest dirt your little sea urchin self has ever had the pleasure to slurp. You can't see: it's fucking dark at the bottom of the ocean. And besides that, do sea urchins even have eyes? All you can do is eat and wiggle your spines a bit. And GUESS WHAT. This is still the best dirt you've ever tasted."
""
"overall: very tasty"
""
""
""
""
"An exemplar of the style, though it lacks some sweetness and intensity compared to a few other examples of the style. The flavor brings to mind a traditional (""single"") bock more than a doppelbock...especially compared to something like EKU 28 for example."
"Overall - This is awesome, a pleasure to drink. So balanced and high on flavors yet not overboard. Simply world class, right up there with celebrator yet very different in flavors."
""
""
"Great Doppelbock!"
""
""
""

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark brown, but not opaque, with a creamy tan head. The aroma is of dark roasted malts and chocolate. It smells clean and sweet and the alcohol does not come through in the aroma. The taste is fantastic. The flavor of dark roasted malt is very rich and creamy. It is mildly sweet like caramel and there is some chocolate flavor to this as well. The alcohol also does not punch through in the taste. Despite being so rich in flavor, the flavor is also clean and not cloying. The body is full and the beer is creamy. Your tongue let's you know you're drinking a big beer, but it's so clean in the finish that this is extremely drinkable. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. This is a doppelbock you should try if you've never had a doppelbock. It's very satisfying."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma has a great mix of fruit and malt. I get some nice cherry, grape and prune notes, as well as some heavy toffee. The flavor is very similar. There is a ton of toffee and caramel as well as some cherry and grape characteristics. The body is a little thinner than I expected, but it does have a very nice, clean lager taste. Medium carbonation."

"O: Best Doppelbock I've ever had, and you cannot go wrong with a Weihnenstephaner beer in my opinion."

"Overall - My 2nd foray into european double bocks, and this one's a bit disappointing. While I greatly enjoyed Ayinger Celebrator, this one is similar, but scaled back by comparison. Very sweet. Not much balance. I've found Weihensthephaner a powerhouse with their wheat beers, but this double bock doesn't quite make the grade. Not a bad beer overall, but I think the Ayinger has spoiled me in the Double Bock department. If I had to describe this one in two words, it'd be 'Sugar Beer'."
""
"Medium body and carbonation with a semi-dry finish. Not bad certainly, but not amongst the best examples of the style or the best beers by this revered brewery, who can do no wrong when wheat is involved."
"Bought a 500ml bottle of this from a department store in Bangkok. Poured into a Paulaner weizen glass. A mysterious algae dark brown hue to the brew with not much of a head on it. The smell was a bit lacking in complexity for me, but it did have notes of caramel, wood, and chocolate in it. The taste was spot on for a doppelbock, serving nicely to a dinner of dark meats or with dessert. However, possibly due to its bottled form, I found this beer to be a bit overly carbonated, resulting in some initial excess gas. It also made my stomach gurgle for about a half hour after finishing the brew. Overall, I love Weihenstephan's brews, but when i'm searching for a doppelbock, I might look elsewhere. I'll stick to their hefes."
"Overall - A very good beer that is a perfect example of the style. While it doesn't push the limits in the exciting department, you can still taste the quality ingredients. I'd have no issues drinking this one again."
"O - I really like this malty big strong beer, this is my go to dopplebock"

"Pours very dark brown with reddish highlights and a thick creamy tan head. Aroma distinct of German malts, chocolate, brown sugar and yeast. Moderately thick mouth. Surprisingly robust and complex maltiness. The wheat is distinctive breadiness along with tones of brown sugar and caramel I enjoyed it quite a lot."

Very smooth, medium body and moderate carbonation. This beer is very good. I have not had a malty beet to this degree. This beer us very true to the style and I will be looking to have this one again soon.The spices I looke for in my bocks aren't there as they seen to be overshadowed by the maltiness."
""

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Fair initial appearance with some nice persistent lacing. Great sweet, malty, syrupy nose. Flavor is a robust combo of thick syrupy sweet malty goodness with a and a pungent bittersweet finish. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"O- A very unique dopplebock with its complex beady/wheaty flavor. Definitely worth trying. Vary flavorful with a brilliant aroma."

"O: Very Belgian-esque for a German lager, I buy this a lot, never disappoints."
""
""
""

"Korbinian is a solid doppelbock with rich flavor, but maybe a little too much alcohol."
"O: A tasty cool weather beverage. Weihenstephaner truly is one of my favorite breweries. They have regular releases that I would love to drink at anytime of the year. This is another. Nice roasted malts and fruitiness. Hops are hard to come by but this is a satisfying brew."
""
"O: A great beer at a reasonable price. Can only imagine how good it is on tap. Will continue to get on a regular basis."
"Walnut brown in color with an amber hue and good clarity. Poured with a short beige foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Well balanced blend of sweet dark roasted malt, toffee, dark chocolate and coffee aromas with ripe fruity aromas at the end. Creamy smooth delicate feel with light, but rich carbonation. Roasted malt and toffee flavors up front. Floral hops and ripe dark fruit through the middle and to the finish. Finishes with a lingering light floral hop bitterness. A plethora of aromas and flavors with a delicate lager feel. Awesome!"

"Overall this is perfect for the style and coming from such a highly regarded Weizenbock and Hefeweizen I can see why this is so awesome. Truly the best quality and price for the style."

"Love this beer. Full of delicious flavor, creamy mouthfeel, nicely balanced with the hops. Flawless."

"-Overall 4.5: This is a beer that, as a whole, is greater than the sum of its parts. This is a very enjoyable dopplebock. I would imagine it would match perfectly with German cuisine, but I would recommend it the way I enjoyed it: in front of a fire on a cold winter's night. I'm sure St. Stephen would agree."

"Watchin' Jeopardy! and drinkin' German brews. Good times. This one pours a sunset sienna-amber topped by a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises caramel, barley right out of a malt bag, and walnut. Nuttier, rawer than I expected, but not bad. The taste holds notes of fluffy toffee, buttery biscuit, very light roasted malts, light chocolate powder, and a touch of sourdough. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a silky feel. Overall, a very nice d-bock, perhaps not the best I've had, but a strong offering regardless."
" A dark brown but clear appearance in the glass, with little head and little carbonation. A sweet chocolate and caramel aroma with a hint of citrus (I said orange, others said lemon). Not surprisingly with most doppelbocks I drink, the taste came with heavy notes of chocolate and smoke. What I love about this brew over others is that there is no rough aftertaste, it's an amazingly smooth beer. An instant favorite, I drove down the autobahn and grabbed up the last case."

"Das Korbinian! I loved this beer at one time, then I stopped drinking for awhile. Then I got the wheels greased again back about a 1.5 years or so, and never gravitated towards a doppelbock. it's not my favorite style.. i tend towards american ales of extreme flavors these days, and the occasional lambic or belgian pale or tripel crosses my lips. I remember liking it, but earlier in the evening i took a sip right after opening and was horrified! Having gotten home after a night out with friends, this tastes great. Not due to my intoxication level, but rather the pleasant subtlety of this beer. Good brown brew. Not a damn thing wrong with it, really. I could see the style being pushed a bit further (as is in the case of celebrator!) but this is an easy drinking, foamsizzling, malty, not overly complex brown beer that has a sturdy abv and a noble lable. Das Koribinian!"

"Final Thoughts- Think a thin piece of fruit caramel covered in semi-sweet dipping chocolate, then think beer with it and that’s what it’s like, but not as sweet. Very nice beer and a little bit different from your average brew. I really like it, and it’s somewhere between easy drinking and too heavy for another one, making it a great beer to have a couple but certainly NOT a session beer that you would want to have a lot of, especially because of the alcohol content."

"Taste/ Notes: the base of the toasted malt tries to stealthily creep by but the roasted, toffee like notes betray their presence. A rich chocolate spreads it's patina of flavor across the tongue. Alcohol cannot hide either, a deep cordial of esthers wafts before a burnt, brown sugar toffee caps off a stunning drinking experience. This is amazing. Stunning. Outstanding."
"O: A nice example of a traditional German doppelbock. Not exactly what I was expecting, but good nonetheless"
"Full bodied mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O-A really nice beer. Give this a chance. You would be dumb not to"
"Count this rich Lager among the gateway beers to craftbeer advocacy."
"Overall: A very tasty beer that is satisfying and filling. Sweet, creamy, and rich."
"O-out of all the weihenstephaners, this might be my least favorite, but its still a good and worthy beer to try. its definitely one of the best dark germans that i've had. its still probably not something i'll be wanting again though"
"O/D-Overall, I enjoyed this beer more and more after every sip. Chocolate sneaks up on you. Smoother and creamier than other Doppelbocks I have had. I have very, very limited experience with the style but I like this one. Only $2.79 for a decent sized bottle."
" I am in love with this beer.."
"Appearance is like root beer or sarsaparilla. Dark brown, but clear enough to see through with zero cloudiness. Smells of prune, pumpernickel, brown sugar with a sweet, bright hint of a hops layer skimming the top. Flavor is great. The prune-ish fruit is well expressed but not dominant. Coffee and chocolate flavors are obvious. I also get spice and herbs: pepper, white pepper and mint really stand out. A near perfect mouthfeel makes this a real treat. Smooth with crispy carbonation that bursts a bit as it compresses for the swallow. It really sparkles for a dark, heavy beer. I'd almost say it's refreshing. It's a great accomplishment: the flavor of a bold beer with the crispness of a much lighter brew. High ABV is hardly noticeable with all the flavor going on. Just an all around winner. Seek it out."
"Overall a great beer. Definitely tastes and smells like it has some Asian Green tea/Black tea influences. Have found this one varies so make sure you get it within its ""best by"" date."
"Exactly what I expected from a German Doppelbock. And its Weihenstephaner, nothing but the best!"
"Mouth feel is nice. It is smooth, taste growing after the first zip, but nothing too strong like with some smokey german beers."
"Very delicious beer; more complex than a straight forward malt bomb and just really, really tasty. Must try beer!"
"Prost!"
"O - its a great rep of the style, definitely a random buy. its a solid brew for cool evenings im just not the biggest fan of bocks in general, but this one played a nice change of pace role. Rain Delay"
"Excellent and refined. Go buy some and set aside 90 minutes to finish the pint+ bottle."
"This was phenomenally drinkable and just superbly done. How did I not know about this one sooner?"
"500 ml bottle. Pours dark red-brownish hue with a tanned, long lasting head. Aroma is of caramel, floral hops and hints of cherry. Medium, velvety body. Toasted malt, caramel and cherry fruit balanced on the palate by floral hops and burned coffee. Long, dry, coffee finish. It is not the best German Dopple bock but it is definitely up there."
"Poured a dark brown with a beige head that left a bit lacing behind. Toasty bread aroma, malts, and hints of cocoa and dried fruit. Crisp and toasty taste, sweet malts, cocoa and nuts keeping it from being too sweet, hints of raisins in the finish. A bit light in flavor and body for the style I thought, but still a fine quaff."
"My notes finish with the phrase: ""classic excellence."""
"Overall a solid doppelbock, and a great version of the style. I will defiantly be picking this one up more in the future."
"I rate this as something everyone should try as it's pretty accessible if you find stores such as Spec's (which I picked up for $2.99) or somewhere similar wherever you are."
"I must be honest with the BA's -- as a raving fan of the Weihenstephaner Hefe, I admit I was pulling for this bock against the ""celebrated"" Ayinger. Bottom line? I adore both -- the Celebrator is as adveritsed, but I found the Korbinian atomic! Let's just call it a draw between two phenomenal breweries...glad to be able to access both here in Southern California!"
"This is a really great Doppel, even though its too sweet to be perfect. This is just another example that American brewers have nothing on long standing tradition only found in Europe."
"O- Overall, another great dopplebock. I think it is missing some of the overall clean character that you find in Celebrator, but still delicious."
"Overall a pretty nice doppelbock, and one that I would enjoy on many occasions. It's no Celebrator though."
"O: Another good offering from Weihenstephan. The ABV kicked in a bit and was noticeable as I was drinking it which I don't really like but nevertheless it's a good beer."
"O: I like this beer. Not my favorite of the style, but a lot going for it. A bit understated on the flavor, but there is some complexity so it's definitely worth a try."
"O - A Great doppelbock. Has a great fruity & malty aroma and a strong roasty malt flavor that stays in your mouth long after you've finished."
"D/O- Very easy drinking for the style, first off. That only works to Korbinian's advantage here. World class? Yes. Are there other dopplebocks right up there with it? Yes."
"O - Well done. A beer you could fast with. Well-balanced and great tasting. I like it about as well as the Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel and the Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock"
"D: Great stand-alone ber for winter or fall."
"Another great beer from weihenstephaner-I wish I could find this in the twin cities cuz this would definitiely be a go to doppelbock."
"O: You remember Toffifay ""it's to good for kids"" the caramel, choclate, hazelnut cups from Germany. That's what came to mind while drinking this beer. The complexity of the sweet flavors is excellent. I really like this beer a lot."
"Overall, a tad dissapointing, given other scores/reviews..."
"Decent little beer."
"Mouthfeel is thin to me."
"O - Overall it is a classic take on the style, and another example of this brewery's brilliance. A rich, fulfilling, and extremely delicious beer that can't be missed."
"Overall: I enjoyed the fact that this one wasn't too sweet. Didn't pick up much alcohol at all. The sweetness did dominate the smell a bit much, but overall a very good beer."
"O- I've been tossing these back like its going out of style but when its on the bosses dime the first time around and half off the rest why not. This is a great doppelbock and its a classic for a reason."
"Poured from bottle into beer stein mug. Pours a very dark but clear amber with a thick white head that leaves a sold lace collar. The nose is dark malt with a good amount of brown sugar and chocolate with just a hint of spicy yeast. The flavor is a little lighter and more nuanced with milk chocolate and malty bitterness and the same yeast flavor displayed on the nose. The body is medium with average carbonation and a long bitter and chocolate finish. Very nice doppelbock, if not one of the better ones I've had of the style."
"Overall this is a very solid representation of the style."
"Pours a dark mahogany with a cream brown colored head. Solid lacing and retention throughout. Aroma of candied fruit, caramelized sugar, coco and dark fruit. Explosion of malt flavor. Big roasted caramel malt, candied sugar, sticky toffee, hints of dark fruit, coco and some dry roastyness to finish. Sticky, thick mouthfeel in this well crafted, classic malty doppelbock."
"o: I haven't had many, but this easily ranks among the best doppelbocks I've tried. The flavor profile is just different enough to really stand out. If it popped a bit more I'd probably have a new favorite."
"Pretty F'in good! Smells like caramel. Tastes thick and sweet. Reminds me of a hot chocolate made with cream instead of milk. Head is a bid thin, but who cares? So convicingly drinkable, with no alcohol taste at 7.4% and very little hops. Malt bomb. I better work this one off, so I can have some more. Das good!"
"O- I've been trying more doppelbocks recently and this one sticks out to me. There might not be anything exceptional about the taste, but it is damn good, and it's character is unique and interesting to me. I could drink this all day, by the way. Seems to be more like a session beer to me than a sipper (although watch the 7.4%)."
"Overall, really liked this beer and this style."
"O: Pretty good, a little heavy, but has a deep flavor profile with a nice sweetness. The heavy body makes it a little harder to drink."
"I poured it from a bottle as well into my Aventinus Weizenbock glass. It poured a dark deep reddish tint with a slight head that dissipated quickly. When I took a good sniff of this complex beer I got a nose of roasted malts and dark fruits. The taste was similar to the nose of this beer. I tasted the roasted malts, the dark fruits like figs, prunes(i couldn’t really put my tongue on it) and some chocolate undertones. The mouthfeel is a medium to full body doppelbock that hides the 7.4% abv well. That makes it quite dangerous since I could keep drinking this. There is a medium level of carbonation. Overall this is one of the world’s top doppelbocks. I maybe biased because doppelbocks are my favorite style of beer, but this is a fine specimen of one!"
"O: This is one of the best doppelbocks out there."
"It's to style, it's Weihenstephaner, it's a proper dark German beer and at the price ($3.50) you could do a lot worse. Would pair well with bratwurst and lederhosen."
"The Korbinian is amazingly drinkable and enjoyable. My glass went far too fast. I'd fast for lent too if you gave me a steady stream of these. It's a good deal at $3.49"
"O - I really enjoyed this beer and got it on a whim. I liked that it was very easy to drink and had deeper flavors then most bocks I have tasted (but not too much to overwhelm my meal). A good buy for $3.27 and will get again."
"O- Great beer. A bit filling to drink a lot of in one sitting. This might be a regular for me. Got for only $2.99 a bottle."
"Overall- Coming down to it, this is a great doppelbock but still wasn't the best. Maybe after having the Celebrator twice in a month, I'm hinting towards this awesome bock. Drinkability was easy for a 7.4% beer and thought it was a great german lager. I had many Weihenstephaners while I was both in Austria and Germany but I didn't take notes and til this day can't remember much of them except I enjoyed them greatly! Ready to try another one."
"overall, a solid example of the style, and a good value."
"O - Very pleasant beer, if it was cheaper this would be a nice easy drinker. Nothing outrageous but a very well made beer."
"Full-bodied with strong carbonation, this beer coats your mouth but doesn't get too sticky. The carbonation may be a little excessive as it seems to get in the way of some of the flavors, but it does prevent a potentially syrupy mouthfeel."
"Overall this was a pretty good Doppelbock, it was one of the better ones I have encountered during my Doppelbock binge, and the best German one I have had yet. Everything about this style was on point and about where it should be. It may not be as flavorful as some of the American ones but it makes up for that by being smooth as hell and having some great drinkability. I will be buying this again and will be on the look out for any other beers by Weihenstephaner. If you like Doppelbocks give this one a try, it's a great traditional German Doppelbock and it gives you a good feel for what this style is all about."
"Overall this beer is just very impressive, it feels like chocolate banana sundae topping. All I feel like doing is having a chocolate ice cream banana split with this on the side (even though I hate bananas). Winner right here folks."
"O - Highly drinkable beer and recommended"
"Very drinkable without any alcohol bit despite 7.4%. I wish I had another chilled now."
"One word to define this beer is excellent, very good drinkable and solid brew from the eldest Weihenstephan."
"I could not drink this all night as it lacks a degree of complexity.It has a determined profile that may well fell the unwary"
"D. This is quite delicious. I'd definitely recommend this to someone looking for a dark fairly sweet beer."
"Really phenomenal example. Nice chewy mouthfeel big full body. Delicious brew."
"A great beer, well put together. It might be a toss up between Paulaner's Salvator and this one."
"I enjoyed it with a nice 5 year old Gouda, but I think it will suit many occasions, especially post dinner ones. So, if you're in the market for a Doppelbock, this is a winner."
"O - as with anything weihenstephaner does i'm a fan. definitely one of the better brews they do but not one of my personal favorites by them. definitely a very good doppelbock but not my favorite in the style."
"While doublebock has never been a favorite style of mine, I find this example to be excellent and would gladly have it again. Ulike some American examples of the style, this is a smoother, more balanced doublebock that is not trying to shock your tongue, but is instead happy to allow the subtlies of a year of brewing residue flavor this beer. I highly recommend, especially if you're looking for a good doublebock."
"The flavor of this beer is very intense and very complex, but unlike many of the intense and complex beers I've had in the past. I feel like I should get some cheese, bread, and a bottle of Korbinian and make it my dinner for a night."
"D - despite its strength - I rate this high because its not cloying and complex enough to make you want to keep drinking it to figure out all the flavors. Remarkable job by a remarkable brewery."
"Incredibly rich with a thick mouth-feel, the flavor is of coffee and roasted malt with a slight sweetness and caramel flavors in the after taste."
"Korbinian pours a deep brown, with plentiful cherry highlights shining through. The khaki colored head rises to about three fingers in height. It quickly dissipated to about two thirds of its top height, but some serious head retention kicks in from that point on. Lacing is decent, but just a little too patchwork to really finish off the look. The nose has sufficiently whet my appetite, a wonderful blend of toasted nuts and caramel. The flavor then manages to surpass my expectations by adding a distinct biscuity note to the nutty foundation, and bringing cocoa into the fold as a second auxiliary flavor to add a very nice flourish. I want to give it a perfect 5 for flavor, but I think a touch of dark fruits could elevate Korbinian even more. The body is impressively slick, and as pronounced as one would expect for such a malt forward beer. The cabronation though is a bit overdone, and I find it occasionally distracting from all the malty goodness. Weihenstephaner's crafted a great beer in Korbinian, it's one I'd gladly welcome back to my glass anytime."
"M: medium body and absolutely no astringet despite the abv"
"D: Devilishly drinkable at 7.4% ABV, this is a doppelbock that was great on it's own and paired very well with my Bavarian pretzel and whole-grain ale mustard. A bargain too ($5 at MiKro) I would pick this or Aventinus over tap selections almost any day."
"Pours a nice chocolate color with a finger of tan head which dissipates almost immediately. Smells very...hearty, like yeasty bread with caramel malts poured all over it, and the taste doesn't disappoint. Extremely prominent is the malt hinted at in the nose, but ultimately the flavor of dark liquorish dominates the taste, knocking out any attempt the bitterness makes to come through. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy with minimal carbonation and a little bit oily, which taken together is extremely pleasant. Almost tastes like a homebrew that hasn't completed its bottle carbonation. Respectable ABV, but for this one I'd hang up the car keys and enjoy a few at home (especially for the price)."
"d - Overall this is a very good doppelbock with an amazing mouthfeel; felt like I could have had a few of these. Would have again."
"16.9oz brown bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a crystal-clear dark brown body with a good inch or so of light tan head. Dark chocolate, ripe dates, caramel, brown sugar, pears. Dark chocolate, nut, caramel, brown sugar, coffee, and pear comprise the flavor. On the heavier side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinks better than a beer this heavy and complex has any right to. The best dopplebock I have ever had."
"This beer is world class. It is at the very upper end of medium bodied, almost getting to full."
"Not my favorite for the style, but definitely good."
"I don't have much experience with Doppelbocks but enjoyed this. Look forward to trying again."
"Pretty damn good stuff. Really drinkable for the style."
"Back before I moved beyond American beer you'd find at the 7/11, this is what my first Michelob Amberbock tasted like. I could have sworn. In past years, the stuff seemed to get more and more watery and flavorless. However, this recaptured that magic from the first time I had a bock."
"Poured a dark brown with a 1.5 inch tan head into a pint glass. Smelled a bit like soy sauce and rum raisins. Tastes like spiced fruits and a little bit of hop bitterness at the end. Had a nice carbonation and was very easy to drink, if I can get this in a boot at the pub I will for sure."
"Overall: An excellent doppelbock. If you are a fan of lagers, then this is a must-try."
"Drinkability: A truly tasty doppelbock. Overall I was impressed by this offering by Weihenstephaner, but they have yet to dissapoint me."
"I ordered a pint of this on draft at Stuff Yer Face eatery in Brunswick, NJ near Rutgers campus. Double bock, nice and dark. Good flavor. It sneaks up on you. I felt the buzz and guessed the abv to be around 7.5%. It went well with the chicken stromboli I ate. I'll definitely seek this out again."
"What can you say? One of the classic German doppels. Can't go wrong."
"Absolutely no detectable alcohol, this beer is quite drinkable."
"A good beer though. Represents the style well."
"D: This is probably the best doppelbock around. Germans make Platonic beers--Reinheitsgebot and beyond. This is one of those definitive drinks."
"drinkability: Delicious. Fairly well balanced. A ""one and done"" beer in my opinion"
"This is a very tasty beer that is refreshing in the winter. Very nice drinkability."
"Poured from a bottle into my Weihenstephan 0.5L hefeweizen glass. Definitely a high-quality beer from a brewery I love, but... not really all that enjoyable. Impressive color and aroma, a little watery in mouthfeel, and... the oddest flavor I've ever tasted in a beer. Others have described it as extreme malt with some sweetness, but I really think it could be better described as tasting like watered-down soy sauce with honey. Not a terrible beer, but definitely not anywhere close to my favorites."
"O: Still a good beer, but a notch below Salvator. Tastes more like a Landbier Dunkel (as the menu I ordered from in Germany said) to me. Very clean and crisp flavors, just would have liked more."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable for the general body and sweetness, but it is so large that it can be nice and a real sipper. The lower carbonation does hurt the general drinkability."
"D: Very drinkable, well-rounded Doppelbock. Would not realize that this brew was 7.4% alcohol by volume based on the taste alone. Another great beer by ""the world's oldest brewery""."
"Conclusion: This is a different take on the style from its direct competitor Celebrator Doppelbock. More subtle, creamy and quietly strong than the more bold (but still refined) malty flavors of that beer. This is so good. Nothing I have tasted from this ""oldest brewery on earth"" has failed to impress me."
"D - Like most doppelbocks, I find this one extremely drinkable. The alcohol is quite subtle, and it goes down smooth. Definitely a beer I will seek out in the future."
"A nice doppelbock well worth keeping an eye out for.."
"Great beer, but it doesn't top the list like Celebrator; certainly a contender worthy of its position and close distance to the great Ayinger doppelbock."
"Very drinkable This is my first Korbinian in a LONG time and I really should drink more of this. Absolutely fantastic beer."
"The initial taste included malts and raisins. The mouthful was punctuated by a strong fruity finish that lingered for a few moments. Drinkability was sound and overall this was a good beer."
"Excellent beverage by all measures. Fit for a King's banquet of rich foods and dessert."
"I love this meaty doppelbock. Rich color and pour, lots of fruit and even a hint of carmel. It was a wonderful variety from Weihenstephaner, a true bavarian doppel. I drank it with hot nuts (no comments please) and some other finger food. Very good pair with savory foods. I will be on a search to find this at my store. Great high ABV too, just right for a winter night."
"D - Fairly drinkable. The char is a little heavy for the style, but overall very enjoyable."
"At first taste the flavor was a bit off-putting in the way it all came together as it was a bit different than anything else I had experienced. After I was able to taste it a few times though I was able to really appreciate the the different complexities and the way they blended together."
"Tasty malt flavor with some dark fruit and nice hint of chocolate at the end. The alcohol is well masked. Smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation. Very easy to enjoy drinking this beer from a world class brewery."
"D: This is one fine beer. Definitely would get again."
"The feel is fairly thick and the carbonation is just right. Even better warmed up. I would call drinkability above average as I do all doppelbocks. A half liter will hold me for some time. Good for not being one of my preferred styles."
"Pours an almost purple brown with ruby highlights and a thick foamy white head and tons of lacing. Smells of yeast bread and tons of malts. Tastes of sweet malts, yeast bread, and a little prune or plum. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is light. Drinkability is medium."
"Drinkability: Easily one of my favorite beers after the first bottle. Wonderful taste and absolutely undetectable alcohol presence for such a high ABV. My only complaint would be that I can't seem to find this in 6 packs. If you like dark beers this is a must try."
"Smell:"
"D: A very solid doppelbock. Great flavors and deceptively easy to drink, despite a pretty sizable ABV."
"A deep brown, almost black with light brown hues, a decent two finger head , a small amount of thin lacing remains on the rim of the beer. The nose is heavy on roasted malts. The taste is fantastic, chocolate, roasted malts, a touch of caramel, a slight-bitterness on the finish. The carbonation is a bit thin, I could have used a bit more. Overall, this is a fantastic beer, very clean and crisp roasted malt flavors. Dopplebocks are becoming one of my favorite styles because those clean flavors brought out through the lagering."
"At this price I might have a new beer to add to the regular list."
"D: Excellent; this is a great lager that I would highly recommend"
"D - It is good but not near my favorite beer. ABV is a bit higher but not crazy."
"Drinkability: An excellent and very well crafted brew. I think it is the definition of smooth; the flavor complexity emerges slowly and clearly."
"Pours a beautiful dark brown, with a robust tan head that lasts and lasts. Not too much lacing going on. Malts and grains in the nose. Smells of toasted maple syrup, raisins and brown sugar. Taste is malty sweet. Very powerful taste. There's a slight alcohol taste but is overpowered by a toasty fruit taste. This beer has it all. Dark sugars, toasted malts, fruits, chocolates, and a minimal hops bitterness in the finish. This beer has a very creamy mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. Washes over the palate with elegance. The only thing that would keep me drinking this all night is the high ABV. The flavor is strong but just so delicious it keeps you wanting more and more."
"Overall, this is a simplistic and satisfying doppelbock. As the label suggests, the brew's recipe adheres to the ""Purity Law of 1516", and that idea certainly comes through in the taste, which is rich, while remaining pure."
"This is easy to drink. There's lot of taste and alcohol, but everything marries together very well making for a nice beer to drink throughout the night."
"Overall: I will be buying this beer again and recommending it to friends, great brew, great price!"
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. One of the best doppelbocks in the world and another fine offering from the world's oldest brewery."
"D - Full flavoured but still fairly mild. Easy to knock back a few on a cool evening."
"This is an outstanding dopplebock, perfect on a cold evening or with a rich dinner."
"Poured into a clear tall glass - produces an excellent 1-2 finger biege head that subsides down to a thin surface layer. Fresh espresso and bread aromas. Mouthfeel is a little thick like a porter, but smooth and velvety. Despite the high alcohol content, does not taste or smell too boozy. Strong even sweet roasted malt flavors and caramel candy taste. An excellent winter warmer."
"I think I like this one a little better than Optimator. A great style of beer, I'll gladly drink this one again."
"D- Could drink this all day. In fact, I bought two....we'll see where the night goes."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Smooth and creamy, yes, but I find it light on mouthfeel. This is an extremely drinkable beer, probably one of the best drinking darker beers I've had. A definite must try."
"Mouthfeel if full, a bit chewy, and light on the carbonation. Overall, a top notch Doppelbock from one of the best of the old world."
"Drinkability: At 7.40% ABV it's almost scary how well hidden the alcohol is. Of particular note with this beer, I found myself wanting another glass almost immediately. Highly drinkable."
"Yes, please! If I'm not desiring hops this is the way to go. This and Bajuvator are probably my top two Doppelbocks. A slight down grade for richness and barely over high abv for this category."
"So after my grand tour of 6 different Weihenstephaner's I'd say Heffeweisen and Vitus were my favorites, Korbinian came 3rd."
"Drinkability: Very smooth drink for the most part. A bit on the watery side though."
"I like it! Probably not my favorite dopplebock but one I'll definitely have again."
"Enjoyed while sitting by a campfire on a chilly Ohio autumn night. Dense rocky head at the pour that subsides after a few minutes to a light foam. Unfortunately I couldn't gauge this beers appearance while sitting outside at night. Aroma of dark fruits. Flavor is exceptional; dark fruits and munich malts, slight accents of chocolate, caramel, and toffee. No alcohol presence at all and drinkability is amazing for 7.4% abv. Overall is is one of the most well put together beers that I have had, and I wish I could find this in six packs for regular consumption during the cooler weather months."
"Celebrator is still my favorite dopplebock but this offering from Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan is right up there. Delicious!"
"O - This is another on my swing through the Weihenstephan roster. They have better offerings in other styles but this is still solid."
"Drinkability - so delicious you'll want to drink it again and again and again. Despite being a heavy beer its sheer tastiness makes it impossible to resist pouring yourself another glass."
"Pours a very nice reddish brown perfectly clear color with a 1 finger off white head and medium lacing down the glass. Very pretty aromas of plum, fig and raisins. Also some rum characteristics in there. Also has a caramelized brown sugar and date component. Really nice aromas and complex. The flavor has some alcohol burn, though it's integrated with the date and raisin flavors, like an aged rum. There is also a nice bit of malty richness to this that makes it very full bodied. Big mouthfeel, alcohol burn and dryness on the finish. Caramelized notes make this a perfect pairing for a grilled piece of pork or ribs. Also has a great delicious factor so this is a good go to dopplebock."
"Drinkability: A decent doppelbock even if it's not completely true to the style. It's alcohol content and heavy nature would make it hard to have more than one of these in a sitting but it is still a delight to drink and something I certainly wouldn't mind having again."
"Drinkability: A decent beer for sitting around the camp fire. A good dopplebock but not my favorite. By the end of the bottle I get an almost metallic aftertaste."
"This is a malt head, who doesn't want anything ""imperial," dream come true. I like this beer a good bit. That said I love hops and I love bitter. A beer I think I'll try again simply because it drinks so well."
"While watching the SF Giants pitter away their season, we find this gem....Clearn deep, dark mahogany. Not much of a head, decent carbonation and little to no lacing. Extremely robust aroma of heavy raosted malt, some mettalic notes, some molasses...Maybe even maple syrup. Pretty great smelling and quite spot on to style. Great flavor upfront. Very rich and full in the mouth. Great roasty punch in the gut, like watching Zito walk in two runs in the first inning of a title clinching game. Beautiful, but loses it near the end - unlike Zito who apparently never has it to begin with. Thin finish, and the unpleasant metallic notes show up more. Nice long, toasty finish - kind of like what the Padres will apparently receive after tomorrow night's game after the Giants choke and lose three straight to get the boot. If not for the thin finish, this would be great. As it is, it's merely good. decently priced at $2.99/half-liter so that brings the drinkability up some, and we're gonna need it after today's game..."
"tasty beer, but the combo of high alcohol and it being medium bodied...you could probably have 2 tops before you're full...all the sweetness and malty flavors make it feel like its a meal in a bottle. personally, I'd just have one. Definitely would have it again, but doubt I'll go outta my way to buy a bottle."
"The Korbinian and the Aventinus are in close competition for my favorite German export of any kind, and this one's $2 cheaper. Highly recommended."
"Roast, but balanced, no hop bitterness."
"Overall - This has officially become my favorite Dopplebock. A must try if you love dark, rich, malty, flavorful beers."
"this was a pleasant & economical surprise for me. full on raisin or fig notes w/a stronger than expected aroma. head was 1/2 inch w/quick dissapation and light lacing down a dt snifter. as it warmed, the malt and cream flavors increased which was expected yet satisfying. i would have zero problem buying a few bombers per month of this gem btwn now and spring."
"My 50th review woo-hoo! Deep dark burgundy with a smallish head. Dark fruits like raisins, plums etc on the smell. Similar on the taste, sweet but not over the top, with some caramel. Very pleasing to the palate. Mmm this is a most tasty brew well worth a buy again. Much better than the Salvator doppelbock IMO."
"Taste is quite similar to the aroma. Fairly substantial malty treat. Wheat malts are present but are not the primary flavor characteristic. Instead it is the dark fruits and molasses that were evident on the nose. Stickiness in the mouthfeel, sweet, but not cloying. Still drinks quite light thanks to the lager yeast. No alcohol detection what so ever. Quite high on my list of Doppelbocks so far, especially for the extremely low price tag."
"Notes: Very nice doppelbock with a good balance with dark fruit and tart/sour flavors along with a nice sweet flavor and some dark bready flavors. Just an overall nice beer to drink and a solid example of the style."
"D: This is an amazing, highly complex doppelbock from Weihenstephaner. Bursting with flavor and character on several levels. Excellent and heartily recommended. A must try if you haven't already."
"This is the best dopplebock ive had!While celebrator is definitely more complex and interesting this is straight foward to the point and nails the style perfectly just a great very very drinkable brew thats enjoyable sip after sip"
"500mL bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint pours a crisp brown with a nice frothy khaki head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves just slight lacing on the glass. Aroma was loads of caramel with slight brown malts and molasses. The taste is an interesting blend of sweet caramel with mild fresh ground coffee and a hint of dried fruit, nice and complex. The beer is medium bodied with smooth carbonation and a bit of dryness. This is certainly an enjoyable Doppelbock, not quite the best I've had, but close."
"D: very good flavor, another i wish came in liter bottles."
"T/M/D- It has a different taste that has a little bite. A taste of bitterness mixed with alcohol but at the same time it is somewhat smooth. It leaves a lingering taste on your palate and that is the only thing I dont like. All in all a good brew I would try another."
"Served:"
"Overall its a nice brew and not a bad introduction to the world's oldest brewery."
"What a great beer. She has a long black body and a coffee-and-cream-colored thick head. Smells sweet and smoky, very malty. Has a sour taste while sweet at the same time. Smoke is present in the taste as well. The sweetness is of malts and fruits. The body is moderate-medium with low carbonation. I would like more body from a beer like this, but it's very good. That being my only complaint, drink up."
"A full on malt bomb with lots of malt depth and complexity. Something I can appreciate and you know when it comes from Weihenstephan it is going to be supremely crafted. I think I would still take Celebrator over this if needing to fix a Doppelbock craving, which, I admit, rarely happens. I'm glad to have tried it."
"MD-This beer is very smooth and easy drinking. A very good Dobbel. It would be a fantastic winter beer."
"D - Quite nice. Except for the thin body, this is a very good dopplebock."
"D - High as long as you take your time. A good half hour plus to savor this pint and a half or so..."
"One of the better Weihenstephaner beers i've had in a bottle, maybe I finally got a fresh one, who knows. The body really set this off for me. The bottle would do, no need for more. This is a meal on it's own."
"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a crystal clear, garnet color with one finger of yellow/tan-tinted head. The retention was good especially as a collar and the lacing so-so in patches. The aroma was of caramel malt, alcohol heat, maple syrup, brown sugar and lotsa malt! The flavors were just the same and very tasty! I detected lots of caramel, molasses, maple sugar, brown sugar, hints of honey, hints of coffee, alcohol esters and a long roasty finish. Very drinkable for 7.4%! The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation medium which was good for the style. In general I really enjoyed this one and thought it an accurate example of the style."
"Notes - I had this during Starkbierfest at Brauhaus Schmitz. This caught my attention because I read the brewery is almost a millenium old and the flavor description was immense. Glad I tried it. I love this beer."
"From the 25 fl. oz. bottle #5269. Sampled on July 17, 2010. The pour gurgles loudly and slowly into the glass and becomes a dark amber color with ruby red hues and a thin but long lasting beige head. I find the aroma to be an inviting interfusion of roasted malts, toffee, and molasses. The bold mouthfeel is as eloquent as the way it sounded pouring into the glass. Although the ABV is over 7% the alcohol taste is well buried beneath the bitter but malty sweetness sensation at the start with a finale of light hops. Defintely a beer to have again."
"This is one more great offering from the oldest brewery in the world. It is incredibly smooth, nicely textured, and well carbonated. I have had a number of over-primed doppelbocks. This one really hits the nail on the head. It is light and sprity, even though the pour produces that beautiful tall cap. This is one of the best doppelbocks that I have had the pleasure of enjoying."
"I find this, for some reason, hugely refreshing and drinkable. I could sink a few of these, for sure - though the abv would be a problem."
"Another good beer from Weihenstephaner.... last one in my set. Check them out !!!"
"D: This is an amazing, highly complex doppelbock from Weihenstephaner. Bursting with flavor and character on several levels. Excellent and heartily recommended. A must try if you haven't already."
"mouthfeel is creamy and easy to drink, bittersweet and balanced well, a delicious dopplebock"
"D: While not especially complex, this beer is just sweet enough to limit me to one at a time. It falls a bit short of Celebrator but what doesn't? It's in the upper tier of doppelbocks and is worth a try."
"D: I haven't had many doppelbocks, but I can imagine that this excellent beer is one of the highlights of the style."
"Ridiculously enjoyable."
"The body was a bit stickier than I prefer for this style, but still very enjoyable. Drinkability was very nice, I would certainly have this beer again. Overall, a very nice version of (maybe one of the standards of) this style."
"O: A subtle yet well crafted doppel. Not too much of a punch in the mouth like other doppels, simply balanced."
"D: The beer is very drinkable and is perfect when you're also looking to have a snack because it will definitely satisfy your hunger."
"D: This is hilariously drinkable for a beer this strong. I'm not given to the maltier beers but this one's great stuff"
"I swear, does this brewery have the biggest ego ever??? They're like ""We can make AMAZING beers that Americans would spend lots of money for... but we'll make them for 2.99"" I love Weihenstephaner! They make the best beers for the best prices. This one pours a dark crimson red and has a nice head to it. The appearance is AMAZING with a scent that overflows with dark fruits and tasty malts. This beer remains to be one of the BEST beers ever made."
"D: Excellent. May be a bit strong for session trinken aber this is a good bier!"
"Pours a three-finger very light tan head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Deep brown color with some mahogany highlights. Medium bodied and light-medium carbonation. Nose is roasted malt. Flavor is malt and sweet molasses. $3.25 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"M, D- Sweet malt is integrated into a toasty, somewhat creamy presentation."
"D: Very drinkable. A great beer to pair with a wide array of foods."
"D - Quite simple overall, but good. I imagine this pair well with roasted duck or sausage. A bit too mild and one dimensional to be a go to beer for me."
"I love dark beers and this is one of the best (if not the best) that I've tasted. First off, the color is a beautiful mahagony and the head is a nice beige. What makes the beer pop is the hint of nuttiness in every sip. It goes well with German sausages or hamburgers. It's highly drinkable but would benefit from distanced drinkings. If you like Newcastle you will love this beer."
"Not bad, but a little too sweet for me to have much at once."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is about perfect, fills the mouth but doesn't cloy. This is very drinkable and will certainly leave you with a buzz after the whole pint."
"Pours a dark brown with about an inch of thick head. The head forms heavy lacing around the side of the glass after only sitting for a minute. The aroma is fantastic. I'm reminded of choclate, dark fruits, and slightly roasted malt. The taste is everything I'd hoped for. Huge malty flavor dominates everything. The aftertaste stays in my mouth a little bit longer than I'd like. All in all a great value still."
"Glad I tried this."
"D - Talk about a porkchop in a bottle! Thickness and mouth coating make it a little less drinkable than it could be, but overall this is a truly great beer. Sip it and savor it because you probably won't feel like having a second one."
"Impressions: Quite good, I was a bit surprised to get a nose full of treacle from this one, but it tasted quite lovely and shows that not all doppelbocks have to be exactly the same."
"This has always been one of my favorites! Pours a nice brown cola color with large bubbles and a khaki head. The nose is smoky and rich with notes of bitter dark chocolate, coffee and molasses. The palate is loaded with flavors of root spice and dark malt sweetness with notes of bread, nuts and coffee."
"Tasty, would definitely get this again."
"Taste: I've honestly never tasted anything like this. Almost like a root beer version of a bock. Root spices along with dark malt sweetness. Bready, sweet. Just amazing. a nice white pepper spice at the end. I must admit, i'm a abit overwhelmed by this one. It has now been added to my top 5 favorite beers."
"Somehow I imagine this as the German equivalent to our malt liquors, something that's made to casually chug after a hard day. I'll keep it in mind."
"I couldn't drink a lot of these, although it's very nice. It's not as heavy going down as much as the way it sits inside you."
"D - This is very drinkable for its ABV and doesn't come across as strong at all. This seems like it would be a good winter beer to have around a fireplace."
"Drinkability: quite tasty and drinkable, though too high in alcohol to be a real session beer. I'll call it good."
"Drinkability: Perfect with a meal, but also nice for drinking by itself. This beer got me started on trying new styles many years ago, and now that my taste-buds have grown I appreciate the beer more, but I miss some of those initial ""wow"" flavors I seem to remember long ago. Finished off the glass pretty fast...and despite the higher ABV I wish I had another 500 mL, or at least another 250 mL."
"D- This one was ok, but it didn't really wow me."
"Solid drinkable big beer. Just enough abv that it will get you if you try to drink it constantly over an afternoon. Excellent for after dinner relaxation, not after thanksgiving dinner, but a evening's pleasant meal."
"Cheers Weihenstephaner!"
"Easy to drink, probably not as fresh as I would like, would definitely be interested in trying fresh on tap for maybe more of a prickly/carbonated mouthfeel..."
"Mouthfeel is medium full and has a luscious smoothness to it."
"D- A monster beer. Hides its abv unbelievably well. A beautiful texture. The first mouthful, if you love malt, sends you to heaven with its smooth transition from sweet malts to a delicate toasted malt note balancing with a milk chocolate creaminess and the dark chocolate bitterness coming through in the finish. All this while maintaining a full body and a clean lager finish. Best doppelbock ever. This is the gold standard."
"D: As close to the classic examples of the style as you get. This is not a session beer, but stands out as a great Lenten drink."
"D: This is one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"Notes: This is a very enjoyable and drinkable big beer. Just look out for the solid 7.4% abv. that will sneak up on you."
"Weihenstephaner Korbinian is another world class beer from the world's oldest brewery. This just became my favorite Doppelbock ...sorry Spaten."
"D: All night long."
"The drinkability is only diminished by the alcohol content of this beer. I could easily drink 2 or 3 bottles of this in a sitting if I wasn't such a lightweight."
"Thick and syrupy body with little carbonation give this beer a very viscous mouthfeel. Nice and pleasantly chewy, the Korbinian is a deliciously drinkable beer."
"D - I'm not usually a big fan of dopplebocks but this was quite drinkable and tasty."
"D: DANGEROUS. Complex and tasty without the overpowering (and off-putting) burnt-malt and overripe-fruit flavors of some lesser dopplebocks. Despite the age on this particular bottle, it's kept its flavors remarkably (I had a fresh bottle a couple of weeks ago, and the differences were negligable). I've had this a dozen or so times, and it's been consistently exceptional. Korbinian easily ranks as one of my all-time favorite beers overall. Try it with beef stew, or baked beans with black-forest bacon, which I'm eating right now :)"
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a small head. Smell is of malts, caramel, and dark fruits. Taste is very mild compared to the smell. Some malts, caramel, and alcohol is present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good quality beer."
"Another winner from the crew at Weihenstephaner"
"Very drinkable beer, but not sure I would want another. Flavor is a little too mild for my taste."
"D: It's 7.4% and the alcohol is imperceptible. Goes down easily and the smell keeps me interested too. I could definitely have two bottles of this (which would be a litre and 6 standard drinks AU)."
"Delicious and a great value! Highly recommend!"
"Drinkability: Another clean and true to the style beer from this brewery. I could have several of these. Very enjoyable."
"A fresh beguiling nose of spicy (cinnamon, clove) toasty malt, cocoa, figs and raisins. The mouthfeel really elevates this brew...with dark, malty, raisin and chocolate flavors, there is a light tangy tartness and the warm cinnamon and clove spiciness, as well as a bit of zing from teh alcohol...a masterfully refreshing balance in a dark wintry style of beer. Magnificent! Incredibly drinkable and delicious."
"The mouthfeel is thick and extremely sticky. Carbonation is low but pretty active. And, yes Mr. Oliver, it went great with my pork chop and (especially) the roasted carrots and onions."
"It was a good brew, but not a great brew from this company. This is the worst brew I have had from Brauerei Weihenstephan but it is still better than most beers."
"Drinkability is good. For over 7 percent its almost sessionable. It's just a little on the bland side. It might be old since it traveled a long way to get to me and theres no dating on the bottle. Worth the price since its rather cheap but wouldnt be my first choice"
"The Korbinian doppelbock pours a deep amber almost copper color with a very pillowy hazy white head and lots of sticky lacing. Aromas is malty, caramel and subtle hints of chocolate. Quaff is extremely malty. Background tastes include raisins, caramel and a dry hoppy finish. I really enjoy the sweetness to this beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and carbonation is great. Drinkability is good for this beer. The sweetness makes it in my opinion and with a nice 7.4% abv it is easy to handle."
"D- Goes down very smooth. Sweet buy not cloying. A wonderful German winter warmer."
"Poured a dark mahogany with a nice tan head. Nose is mostly chocolate and molasses. Taste is sweet dark caramely malts lead to a dry finish with minimal hop bitterness and no roasty bitterness noted. Some good chocolate and maloasses notes. Mouthfeel is a bit thick and viscous, almost full-bodied. I think Einhorn has this one beat but its good!"
"D-interesting that the American import bottle is marked ""malt liquor"". Not at all boozy despite the ABV. Nice front flavors and smells but somewhat coarse tasting in the finish. That said I would drink this again but by no means is it a standard."
"D: Somewhere between a sipper and a session beer. It doesn't quite reach the level of complexity of a sipper, but it a bit heavy to session. Therefore, I probably wouldn't drink more than one at a time, but I would enjoy that one. This probably goes good with a hearty meal of meat and potatoes (and I'm sure the Germans pair it with such hearty meals frequently). A tasty Doppelbock overall."
"D – Always a great choice."
"drinkability: a very solid dopple, I liked celebrator better but this was a nice dopple too"
"korbinian is an example of a great doppelbock. this one is up there with Ayinger's Celebrator."
"The 7.4 ABV is hardly noticable with the great balance of the beer. I don't know if I could drink this all night but I reckon I could give it a good crack!"
"lighter in body than expectded considering the array of rich malty flavors and aromas. delicious and rediculously drinkable, never too sweet or alcoholic."
"This is a very nice brew. Not my favorite dopplebock but delicious when fresh and on tap."
"O: Dark, daring, and delicious. While the darkness, alcohol, and full flavor of this beer may overwhelm those that only drink lighter lagers, those that can appreciate the qualities of this beer will fall in love with it. I look forward to trying both more Weihenstephan brews as well as other beers brewed in the Doppelbock style. I am happy to give my first A+ rating on Beer Advocate to this beer."
"Thanks Weihenstephaner I will buy you again!"
"D- on a different planet than other examples of a style that never got me too excited. to have a doppelbock better than this would simply blow my mind. i'm not ruling it out, and i'm sure there may be one out there, but as of now i'm oblivious to it. there's a little too much mineral in the nose, but the taste is so invitingly complex and the feel is so damn soft and smooth that the korbinian kicks the drinkability out of all others. all hail the pack bear."
"I have generally been fairly indifferent about doppelbocks, but this one just nails the style, and I love it. This is just a fantastic beer, and its high drinkability is surprising."
"Very creamy and drinkable. Well put together."
"D: One of the better doppelbocks I have had. It reminded me of Ayingers Celebrator. Overall, an excellent beer I will be buying much more of."
"Pours a dark garnet red. With a huge aroma of dried cherries and burnt raisins. A real fruitcake aroma. The taste is the same. Great dried cherries and figs. A great balance of flavor along with the subtle warmth of the alchohol. An easy drinker, but one to savor for its taste as well as the 7.4 ABV. Another great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"Good stuff, recommended."
"Pours a beautifully clear darkest shade of black cherry with a huge creamy/frothy head that slowly dissipates to a cap but leaves incredible lacing all the way down. Smells of caramel, brown bread, figs, prunes, dark fruit. Lots of sweet malty aromas ticket the nose. Taste is sweet with malts. Dark fruits, prunes, figs, burnt brown sugar, a touch of alcohol about midway and a long lingering molasses and dark fruit finish. Sweet sticky mouthfeel, light to medium carbonation, thick body. This is a great dopplebock. A malt heads dream with great complexity and an abv that is well hidden."
"D: I was surprised how good it was. It's sweet, but not cloying. Respectable ABV is not apparent at all."
"Drinkability: A bit darker, lesser alcoholic and fruity than many doppelbocks out there -- I dug it! I mean, there's only so much alcohol and fruit a man really needs, right?"
"An absolute repeat buy!"
"This is a very good beer--one which would be thoroughly satisfying and not at all overwhelming."
"Aroma is rich and malty with a sweet but not cloying undertone rather like cinnamon rolls. It pours a very appetizing semi-translucent mahogany with a fairly thick and somewhat persistent pale tan head. Aroma is malty with just a bit of hop bitterness and a hint of spice, mainly cinnamon, plus just a touch of fruit. Texture is tingly, fizzy and lively, downright lip-smacking."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light and watery, but that just adds to the drinkability. Has a nice sweet maltiness and some nice carbonation that gives it a pretty smooth and slightly dry finish. You can get a hint of the booze but for a soppelbock that's a bit expected. This is an awesome beer!"
"Pours a reddish brown with two finger creamy eggshell colored head. Smell: muted, dark brown sugar, molasses, musty grain. Taste: dark brown sugar, edging towards chocolate, hint of peppery alcohol. A little spicy hops and sourish yeast characteristic. Mouthfeel: smooth, creamy. Very drinkable with hidden alcohol exposed as a growing warmth by the end of the bottle."
"D: Not too bad."
"A great example of a doppelbock, worth trying for anyone who loves malt-bombs."
"The consistency and carbonation are reminiscent of the balance of the best Belgians in their ability to disguise their powerful ABV. However, the finish is smoky, but a bit watered down."
"before I knew it, my mug was empty."
"D - A true sipper. This took me a looong time to drink. This is a true big beer. I had a really hard time finishing the whole pint because the heavy dark malts and the sweet cherries. Would have preferred to split this with someone for dessert."
"Mouthfeel was medium to light in body and med/light carbonation. Just right, doesn't hinder the more subtle flavors."
"Pours a very dark brown with reddish highlights. Thin tan head. Smell is of dried fruit. Taste is richly of malt flavor, caramel. Not much roasted malt flavor which is surprising for the dark black color. A gentle earthy bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is decent, though a bit watery for a Doppelbock and such a high ABV beer. Carbonation levels are nice and low though. Easy drinking beer, not the best Doppelbock I have had, but an excellent pick nonetheless."
"16.9 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. This is a translucent deep black color, but translucent with solid half an inch of head. The smell is very sweet with hints of chocolate covered raisins and cherries. Flavor is very sweet as well with more hints of chocolate covered raisins and cherries. Very little hop presence and almost no alcohol here (especially considering the ABV). Combined with silky, well carbonated mouthfeel and stellar drinkability, this is an excellent beer."
"Drinkable and pleasant overall, but that little sage at the end was not for me so much. But overall a good beer."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a small tan head which fades quickly. Smells of caramel and dark fruit. Tastes of caramel, dark fruit, is sweet, with some bitterness at the end. Medium to full bodied with medium to high carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden for 7.4%. Weihenstephaner makes consistently great beers and Korbinian is no exception. Very drinkable."
"T: Mmmm, smooth, lightly creamy, with touch of fruitiness that drifts along the top of your palate - unique for being such a dark appearing brew. Tinge of sourness towards the background and finishing faint sweet coffee in equal intensity to other profiles that just creates and balanced, complex, delicious experience."
"To the ones (like me) that are not big fans of German beers and that think that the rauschbeers are the only ones that could be taken seriously, it's a quite funny experience drinking a good and old Weihenstephaner. This has a red-brown crystal color and a well defined and mature taste. In the end, the lesson is quite simple: Don't underestimate the Germans, they can do, of course, excellent beers like this one... ;)"
"Overall a real good beer period. I really enjoy this style and would be glad to pick this up again."
"D: Real good drinker. This is probably the best Doppelbock I've ever had."
"Drinkability: This one is made for sipping and relaxing. Quite nice to drink and I'd be happy to have another. I certainly will seek this one out whenever given a chance."
"Another great weihenstephaner beer, and a great example of the doppelbock style. I wish I had more!"
"Not, in my opinion, what I would consider a staunchly traditional bock but one of my favorites to date. So drinkable and smooth, loads of flavor without overdoing one aspect over another. A delight."
"D: A good beer that would have been much better without the soy sauce flavor."
"- Very great flavor... bit thick and hard to swallow, but overall a fantastic brew!"
"This beer is incredibly smooth, mouthfeel is good, full bodied and the drinkability is high."
"Overall: A decent brew with great taste-layers. Recommendable"
"Interesting little beer this one. Ruby tinges on the dark body and a solid milky head. Some roasted coffee and chocolate but a strong whiff of almost wine-like plums or raisins....but kind of musty like an oxidised wine although this is definitely not oxidised. Those pruney flavours come through on the palate too, loud and clear. A beer for certain occasions maybe but I dig it."
"One of the best doppelbocks that are around. The label is really cool looking too."
"hmm, not a bad beer, but not my thing. i had high hopes for this one bit it just doesnt make it happen for me. a heavy malt oriented beer can go in a few directions. chocolate/coffee or dark fruit (and probably a few other directions). i find the choc/coffee much more appealing."
"Overall I was a fan of this beer despite the style not being my favorite. Flavors are all present in abundance and this is well worth checking out."
"A quality doppelbock from Weihenstephaner and perfect for this time of year. A must try."
"Drinkability is great, I could have easily finished the entire bottle on my own and then some. Overall, yet another gem from those crafty Germans at Weihenstephaner."
"Another great product by the Weihenstephaner brewery. Excellent dopplebock product to take note of."
"This one pours a nice chocolate brown with ruby highlights. About an inch of tan head and decent lacing. Nice stuff here. It smells like a malt bomb, with big chocolate, caramel, and toasted bread notes. Some raisin and dark fruit comes through too. Taste is delicious, like a German brown ale. This is tremendous. Much better than Troegenator, which might be the only other doppelbock I've had. Good blend of dark fruit with the toasted, bready malt that remains. A bit of brown sugar too. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, though coating. Drinkability is great--nice tasting beer with a medium-light body that keeps me slugging it down. Good stuff from Weihenstephaner, although I still prefer Vitus and Heffe."
"D- I would have this again but when there was some snow on the ground."
" These beers continue to impress me. I have been pretty much experimenting with strictly American breweries, but these keep me wondering about other German beers. Only one way to find out! Cheers!"
"Its a good Bavarian doppelbock. On the level of say a Maximator, not bad, not good, not average, just slightly above in a highly competitive and well done style. Nice price on it htough, as with all Weihenstephaner products, they are priced right."
"Good rich body, but needs more carbonation to dry out the finish a bit."
"Notes: Simply a classic dopplebock, one heck of a great example of the style and one that rivals a sentimental favorite, Spaten Optimator. Despite the greatness of other Weihenstephaner beers, this is likely my favorite."
"drinkability ~ very drinkable ... this would be wise to consume at home if you want more than one!"
"Very good beer, but not as complex as others in this style"
"Medium bodied, it has a nearly clean malty flavor, but again some fruitiness, mostly in the form of prunes come through now and again. Hoppiness is barely noticeable, yet it is not overly sweet or cloying."
"Rich flavor in a thin body--well not that thin, but certainly less than most bocks (not to mention doppels). Very complex--quite dry for the style (a touch of sugar on the tongue only on the initial sip). Surprisingly hoppy in the swallow which lingers throughout the aftertaste. Some chocolate notes without any burnt flavors at all. Almost like ice cream."
"First time trying Weihenstephaner Doppelbock and I very much enjoyed it, and I'll be enjoying this beer again and again."
"Drinkability is pretty high. I'll definitely be looking into the occasional bottle during the upcoming fall and winter months."
"Good drinkability but a little strong to have more than one. Don't want that alcohol burning a hole in my gut. Damn good though and will have it again."
"Nice take on the style and quite drinkable. Another winner from this brewery."
"D - Great dopplebock. Of course, I'm not surprised that Weihenstephaner did a great job on a beer."
"Aaaargh! The agony of admitting that such a great-looking, great-smelling beer from these master German brewers, could be a letdown on taste! It's a lovely brew, it just tastes and feels thin, and the nose promised so much more. I don't want to denigrate this great brew any further, so I'll finish by pointing out that it is extremely drinkable."
"S:"
"It's carbonated loosely, creamy texture. There's a nice light tingle that dissolves away. Not much of an aftertaste, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"drinkability - this beer goes fast and makes you wish you had bought another bottle"
"Overall: An excellent brew through and through. I'm generally a big fan of big, malty beers like dopplebocks and this one doesn't disappoint. Not my absolute favorite dopplebock, but certainly in my top 5."
"Overall, I'll confess that doppelbocks are not my favorite style of beer, but this was a strong representation nonetheless and would come recommended if this is the style of beer that does it for you."
"This poured a clear dark mahogany with tan head. It smelled like honey wheat bread and smoky barley, with molasses and roasted coffee. It tasted like smoked barley and roasted coffee and molasses and honey wheat bread, with bitter chocolate and nutty malt. It was watery with a bit of carbonation, and had a malty aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and tasty beer with a great roasted and smokey flavor. It had good body and hid the alcohol very well, so it was super easy to drink. Maybe not the most complex or delicious doppelbock I've ever had, but I definitely fully enjoyed it. Another hit from Weihenstephan!"
"D: very easy to drink, its you like this style and I do, one of my favorite, i think its time to open another one. Cheers!"
"Pleasant, but still not quite my favorite of the style. It is very easy to drink though, and I would never dream of overlooking this one."
"Edit 12/24: Fresh flavor is doughy with hazelnuts, creamy & gentle with the caramel. Just a twinge of bitter earth. Carbonation is just a hair better then last time, but it whips the beer in a constant froth. Love it. :)"
"D - I could drink this like water. The flavours really seem to agree with me. This has been one of my favourite beers/doppelbocks for a long time, i'm glad I finally reviewed it! In my opinion its Weihenstephaner's best beer."
"D- Very easy to drink, made me wish I had picked up more than one. Over all not my favorite doppelbock but in my top 5."
"Overall, a great drinker. A bit on the dry side compared to some others within the style, but that is a good thing. Good balance makes you keep reaching for the glass. Glad I tried it."
"Def. a great beer with a high ABV that is great for sipping and relaxing.."
"Had this at the Gingerman in Houston. Pours a black color with hints of red in it. Coffee color head about half inch which slowly receded. Aromas of cocoa powder, caramel, chocolate and figs - a very good smelling beer. This is one amazing tasting beer - very smooth and creamy with more of the same flavors. One time cocoa powder dominated and next sip mostly figs and the next just chocolate. Wow - i love this beer, the alcohol is hidden quite well. Very easy to drink this beer - a delight. Now this had become my favorite dopplebock, kicking the celebrator from the top spot for dopplebocks"
"D: Not a hint of alcohol to be tasted at all, and the flavor is absolutely perfect. This is a fantastic beer, probably the best dopplebock I've had. (Note to self: do a side-by-side with this one and Celebrator)."
"Rad beer, liked it a looot."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. One and one half inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of a hint of caramel malt, slight pale malt, sweet malt, slight hop, and yeast. Fits the style of a Doppelbock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of strong sweet malt, then yeast, pale malt, hint of hop, slight bread dough, and slight alcohol. Overall, good aroma, feel, body, and blend."
"Again, this is the tastiest doppelbock I've ever had, and picked up four bottles for home from the brewery to hopefully share with my buds."
"The first time i cracked a bottle i emptied the contents into a stemless wine glass thinking the large opening of the vessel will enable me to get a better smell, and possibly catch the more subtle undertones.. It worked and i truly love the color.. To me it is a Plum brown color, with a hint of prune and a nice layering that does not come off as sharp in taste. Nice and rounded. The head was a light tan about a knuckle in height that did dissipate after a few minutes. This beer is great with Pecan Pie, or any other heavy, rich dessert.. Enjoy y'all!!"
"Definitely low on the sweetness scale for a doppel and the malts have a nearly burnt caramel flavor. There is a bit of toastiness in there that is contributing as much, if not more, bitterness as the hops. Its a pretty unique doppelbock and is a pretty tasty brew, but I like some of Weihenstephaner's other offerings better."
"Pours a velvet black smooth body with a thick, reasonably stiff off-white head--imposing in a Schneider glass...floral, malty balance--a bit of berry dances with a soft hops bouquet... complex, definite presence of banana, clove and caramel... soft, thin, warm mouthfeel; light for a doppelbock, almost with a weizen lift--the aftertaste is appropriately warming...smooth and deceptively soft--a pleasure to taste with a balance of malty solidness and and wheat in the teeth...a perfect treat for an unseasonably humid evening in May, refreshingly versatilefor spring, summer or fall..."
"medium body, smooth, but moments of thinness. faint texture near finish. nice moderate carbonation gives a little extra body and lift."
"The highest score I've given since joining this site (almost 800 beers ago)."
"had it again in june of '10 wonderful wonderful feel. with a nice toasty molasses quality. richer malt quality. fresher bottle not as much fruit."
"D - The alcohol here is well hidden and there is enough complexity to justify the alcohol. Quite good."
"Overall - a good example of the style. I daresay it rivals the standard doppelbock Paulaner Salvator. Although the mouthfeel is a bit thin than expected, it does taste good and it certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability: Just my style, thanks for the spot on suggestion sprinkle. A great, refreshing, malty beer."
"Poured from the dark brown bottle with the bishop and the beautiful Bavarian flag the result was a big frothy head. This doppelbock from the world's oldest brewery, fills the mouth with many flavors. Dense bread, molasses and heavy malt. More flavors make their presence known as the brew warms to room temp. Such as raisin or dates with a stronger hint of alcohol. But even then the 7.2% is buried. The epitome of a dunkel, this is what many American craft brewers try to emulate. Second only to the world's best dunkel; Ayinger's Celebrator Doppelbock, but only the thread of a bishop's hat."
"D - Easy to drink for a darker and stronger beer. Not exactly my style but I enjoyed it."
"edit: had this one again from the Weihenstephan Christmas pack 12/16/09. I poured it into my kick-ass Weihenstephan glass and it poured a huge, massively thick and compact brown head that never faded and left curtains of lacing all the way down the glass. I also got smoky toffee flavor that stayed on my palate even after the finish. My score has been altered to average my first appearance score and the new one."
"drinkability- a delicious beer that i enjoyed. a bit too bitter with a strong after taste that faded quickly"
"This is an interesting example of the Dopplebock style, incorporating some of those dark fruit flavors found in strong dark Belgian Ales that I really dig. Very drinkable, medium bodied, and nicely carbonated."
"Pours a dark amber, almost brown. Nice and slick, billowey head. Smells like sweet malt and roasted plums. Bit of chocolate or something similar. Has an absoulutely huge bready flavor, the thickness, heartiness of it is almost like liquified bread pudding. Lots of sweet malt, lots of dark plum flavours, hints at roastiness and chocolate. Something like a sweet toffee, or molasses. Alcoholic on the back palate, but it fades. A bit medicinal, but nothing overbearing. Like fresh baked bread. Very creamy mouthfeel though, very pleasurable. The alcohol serves to warm, and doesn't detract from the experience. A great beer. Weihenstephaner continues to come through."
"Overall a great doppelbock. The smooth and fruity character are a welcome change from my usual hop bombs."
"D= This was a great beer and made me love Weihenstephaner as a brewery even more. Very drinkable despite the abv and fullness of the beer."
"Delicious; might be my favorite doppel. Between this and Celebrator I'd be hard pressed to choose."
"Another great beer from Weihenstephaner. I prefered this over the Celebrator Doppelbock."
"All in all, a very fine sipping beer that makes me realize I should perhaps spend a bit more time in the import section."
"This is a great beer and a must for any dark beer fan. If you love beer like Kasteel Brune then I recommend this."
"If you drink this beer, let it sit for 10-15 minutes before you even pour it. Give it a vigorous pour and enjoy. Anyone who likes chocolate will love this one, even people who normally don't drink beer because it's really solid."
"D: Overall, this beer is quite drinkable. Ringing in with 7.4% alcohol and being fairly sweet, I don't think I could have more than one or two of these, but those two are definitely enjoyable. This is one complex and tasty beer that I will have to try again sometime when my nose is a little less plugged up ; )"
"This is one great beer. Its rich, complex, and yet somehow manages to stay very drinkable."
"Pours dark brown with a two-finger tan head that waits until the last minute to take off amongst a rush of carbonation activity. Retention isn't bad, and a few small dots of lace are left behind. Aroma is thick with dark chocolate and caramel malts. Lurking in the shadows are some hops and dark fruits (figs and prunes). Tastes of roasted malts with an alcohol bite following shortly thereafter. More subtle bitterness follows. Goes down a little sticky with the alcohol heat hitting the back of the throat. Has a medium mouth-feel and a good amount of carbonation. Always a fan of a good doppelbock, and this one didn't dissapoint."
"Taste was very complex. Overwhelming sweetness at first sip, gradually gives way to more subtle flavors of carmel, nutmeg, and other things I can't identify. Wonderful!"
"Weihenstephaner did it again, this is a great beer! maybe the best dopplebock I have ever had."
"D: Very drinkable, heafty for sure, but also drinkable. I would love this with a hot sausage or a piece of warm whole wheat bread smeared with fig preserves. Wow. good beer."
"Very clean pour with no sediment whatsoever on the bottom of the bottle. A great Doppelbock."
"Grabbed this one on someone's recommendation and I was glad I did."
"Pours a mahoghany color with an off white head that has great retention. Aroma is of caramel and dark fruit. Taste is a little roasted initially giving away to some burnt sugar like sweetness. A touch of fruit is in the background. Finish is a bit dry. I appreciate the fact that is isnt cloyingly sweet as some doppelbocks can be, helping its drinkability. Nothing spectacular here, but quite solid."
"The taste is flavourful yet smooth and very pleasant with prunes, woody raisins, whole wheat toast, a little spice. It has solid sweetness with a toasty, peppery-spicey bitterness to balance it and which takes over at the finish."
"Weihenstephaner has another winner here. I questioned whether they could truly succeed to the same degree without any banana or clove. Boy, I was wrong to even question that. Korbinian could use a stronger nose, but it's still one of the best Doppelbocks out there. If you haven't tried this one by now, you should go find a bottle immediately."
"An excellent brew overall though. I would and have bought this again. Another fine beer from the world's oldest brewery."
"A very nice doppelbock. Pretty solid flavors throughout but nothing special. Great deal for the price."
"After pouring from the bottle, it had a darker wheat color of foam. The smell was strong and complex and had a nutty hint and a little fruity. The color was of a nice porter and cola look. Its taste is one to be desired. Rich and smooth with a crisp and smokey flavor. Being a fan of German beer, it wasn't hard to know after pouring it, that I would love it."
"Weihenstephan (""holy Stephen"") claims to be the world's oldest brewery. I can't be sure of that but I do know that dopplebocks developed near the brewery's location around Munich around the Middle Ages. If this brewery really is the world's eldest than good on them for continuing the production of the monastic ""liquid bread"" that sustained monks during their periods of fasting. No food but plenty of bock beer? Seems almost a fair trade..."
"I regret not having tried lager styles sooner. This beer was phenomenal and has certainly paved the way for other beers of this style."
"D - While I am not a huge fan of the style, this is a really good beer. I would say I could down more than one bomber in a sitting."
"Truly a gourmet meal in a bottle. Thank you, Bavaria."
"Poured to a nice brown color that seemed to have some burgundy highlights, a good sized tan head that had quite good retention which left some lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma of this one is very nice as bread and caramel come to mind, also though it has been imported it does smells fresh and I think that comes from a slight fruit aroma that is mixed in. The flavor is very good, malt is very dominant and has a welcoming flavor. Caramel and toffee come to mind with a backing of raisin or prune. The flavor does come out more as this brew sits and I sip it, though the alcohol does not seen to be noticeable to me or goes so well with the other flavors it is hidden. Overall this is an excellent brew, one I would get again and hope to have on draft at some point. Give this brew a try as it exemplifies the style."
"A lot going on, but can get to be a bit much, really. Complex, but can be sickly sweet - if you had a handful of nuts or a nice bit of Jarlsberg it'd probably balance out great. I drank this one with a fistful of supermarket Cheddar on the side - since there wasn't anything better in the fridge - and still had a good time. Excellent beer, but you might want to hold off 'til Christmas. Would be dynamite with pudding."
"p.s. They get an instant 5.0 on appearance practically on their label alone. What other beer features a pack-bear?"
"Dangerously drinkable, but I'm still hungry."
"D: A very nice Doppel. Not up there with my favorite example of this style, but excellent nonetheless. I'm glad I picked this up."
"Have revisited this...great cocoa/chocolate flavors, rich dark malt, and yet not cloying. Dangerously drinkable and top notch. Nose is a bit muted but very flavorful and rich."
"Pours a ruby-brownish body. Big creamy off-tan head, lasting. Malty caramel roasted aromas. Some dark fruit, plum or so. Caramel, roasted flavors. A little coffee, a little semi-sweet chocolate. A tiny bit of nuttiness. Very good."
"Highly drinkable beer, only downfall for the style would be the sweetness. It may push some people away if they are looking for a strong, dark, chocolatier beer."
"This is a fascinating and beguiling beer! Cheers if you ever have the chance to drink one!"
"Overall, an OK doppelbock, but the mouthfeel was just too thin for me to want more. No comparison to Ettaler or Samichlaus."
"The Germans have it very good."
"D: Very drinkable. Smooth, flavorful and balanced all around. This is a beer of the style that would be really good with food. Its not like Celebrator, but abv and body make it more drinkable."
"Bottle: Poured a deep Burgundy color bock with large dirty brown color head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of banana ester with some dry fruits notes. Taste is also dominated by some dark fruit taste with ester of banana and some sweet malt. Body is about average with some creamy notes and good carbonation with no distinguishable alcohol. Well done but it would have been even better to get a fresher bottle."
"D: This is one drinkable doppelbock, I would definitely not be opposed to having again."
"Nicely drinkable, without the heaviness of some Doppelbocks, and a well-crafted version of the style from one of Bavaria's greatest Brauereien."
"Ultimately, the beer is exceptionally drinkable. No mean feat for a beer weighing in at 7.4% - there's not a hint of it on the palate, although the rich heavy character intimates that something is going on here. A big beer, and a very good doppelbock - an exemplar of the style."
"D: Astonishingly easy to pound back, especially considering the ABV. Overall, a quality example of German brewing. It can't quite go toe-to-toe with Celebrator as far as doppelbocks go, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down. I don't think I'd want to have it by itself, though. I'd rather follow the Weihenstephan web page's suggestion and try it with some smoked meat or fish."
"It is very drinkable. I found that it was better after a few more sips."
"D - this a good doppelbock. A lot sweeter than I expected it to be, which isn't a bad thing. I wouldn't have expected anything less from Weihenstephaner."
"OVERALL: Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Goes down surprisingly quickly for the higher ABV. This one was definitely unique in the doppelbock style. Instead of being a huge sweet malt bomb, this one had a porter-like quality to it. This may not have been to style per se, but it was enjoyable in itself. I'll definitely be picking up more of these in the future."
"D - Doppelbocks are surprisingly drinkable considering their higher ABVs. Overall, it's not as good as some other doppelbocks I've had, so therefore, not quite as drinkable. I think I paid $3.75 or $4 for the bottle."
"This bottle was far from it. I will have to try again."
"D: I just had the Ayinger Celebrator a few nights ago and I like Korbinian better for a few reasons. First, more appealing look than any other. Second, smooth more consistent flavor that is malty but better balanced with some leafy, earthy hops flavor. Third, 17oz for a good price, especially for an excellent dopplebock, so it hits the point on value. Last, the feel is the best around due to the uniquely low carbonation quotient. My favorite dopplebock."
"Did not notice the moderately high abv. Very easy drinking. Sessionable. The more Weihenstephaner beers I try, the more I respect, appreciate and admire this brewery. This, to me, was one of those beers you discover every so often that is like an epiphany. How did I not find you sooner?"
"Oh, but the flavor. Luxuriously creamy and malty, with layer upon layer of dark wheat, caramel, toasted chocolate, and brown sugar. Finishes with a light bittering of German hops and some roast, that blend well with a hint of booze and yeasty goodness. Mouthfeel is near-perfect, with a velvety, medium body and well-crafted carbonation level, but a slight chalkiness keeps it from the ""5.0"" department. Overall, Korbinian is a delicious brew that thankfully shies away from the more booze-intensive notes other dopplebock's tend to favor. I'd certainly purchase it again."
"D--A great example of a Doppelbock. We're dealing with pros here. Quite drinkable at this ABV."
"500ml bottle served in a hefe glass. Poured a beautiful mahogany with three fingers of tan head. Malty aroma with molasses and dark fruit. Also some noble hop aroma. Rich malty flavor with some chocolate and more molasses. Not overly sweet. Very smooth and creamy Nice malt complexity. Very drinkable. I liked this a lot. If you are a fan of German malt flavor, you should try this."
"i could get to like these."
"D..I could easily overlook the drying quality of this beer to enjoy them all night. Delicious, complex and beautiful; Korbinian is a winner when it comes to Dopplebocks. I strongly recommend you try it out if you have not already."
"Superb beer."
"Mid sized German style bottle, w/o freshness info. Pours an interesting and hard to describe, dark amber shade, with hues of translucent seemingly dark dark purple. Middle of the road khaki cap and then doesn't leave much if any lace to get excited about. Dark fruity nose and then an onslaught of com0lexity and intrigue. More dark fruit, ripe plum notes, chocolate hints and continuing wave of dopplicious flavors and goodness. Tasty, tasty stuff."
"D: Since I absolutely love this beer for its richness and compatibility with bold food, I could probably drink this all night with everything from the starting salad to a rich baklava. The brew most assuredly has the complexity and character to compliment the entire meal."
"Drinkability: A great way to close off a session of sweeter beers or as a standalone for the evening. This is one of my preferred doppelbocks (with the Celebrator) and I'll be coming back for the forseeable future."
"I want more of this one."
"Very drinkable"
"D - I can't finish the bottle. A bit too sweet for my taste, but I can appreciate what the beer's trying to be."
"D - the taste wasn't amazing, but this beer seemed so thin that I could put a few of these down (most of the Weihenstephaner beers I've had have been that way)"
"MF&D - the beer goes down smooth, the feel is not too thick, just about right, and makes for a great beer to have at lunch!"
"Overall, this is pretty solid doppelbock, but I think there are better German doppels out there. Worth trying though."
"Nice dark red color, transparent. Smells a lot like cereal or grains, grape nuts. The taste is very malty, some fruit, clean. Germans aren't usually my thing but this is a very interesting beer and one I will re-visit in the hopes of learning something."
"Pours a deep molasses brown with an excellent initial head that dissolves leaving a good lace quality. Smell is deep, rich, malty, molasses. Taste is also rich, slightly sweet and malty with light hop undertones. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich and belies the high abv...excellent. Likewise, it is extremely easy on the drinkability scale. I could have more than one, but tak ecare it is 7.4 abv."
"D - Winner, winner, chicken dinner. Not the greatest looking beer, but everything else is exceptional."
"one of my favorite doppelbocks, good to switch up my from my usual ayinger celebrator. greatly drinkable"
"Pours a deep crimson and nearly looks like blood red,the cap is hesitant to make much of a appearance,but is easily stirred to create a one finger sandy brown covering that lasts only a couple seconds and leaves no lacing. The nose smells of brown sugar and nutty malts,subtle chocolate and dark fruits as well. This tastes a little subdued to be a top notch Doppelbock. Tastes of raisins and light milk chocolate,like Raisinette candy. A little caramelized brown sugar and light maple. Sweet and dessert like,good overall. A medium full body and slightly sticky mouth coating attributes help this achieve a solid landing,sweet and subtly smokey malty finish. A great brewery and a very enjoyable Doppelbock."
"D - Awesome brew and a paramount example of the Doppelbock style... Incredible craftmanship leads to a truly wonderful beer experience... Another world class brew from a world class brewery..."
"I love this beer! One of the best beers I've had this year for sure and its very affordable to boot! I've seen it for under $3 here in W. Mass."
"Deep brown, very clear, nice head with great lacing. Light in the nose - wet leaves and earth. I should probably let it warm up a bit more. Anyway, tastes... Like a nut brown ale. HUGELY nutty, big and malty. A bit sweet. Easy going down with nice body."
"What a fine beer from the Weihenstephaner brewery. This could be a sweet session beer on a cold night since the ABV is very manageable. This beer gets better with each sip."
"T, M, & D: Like a brown sugar cookie wedded to toasted barley shot through with a slightly higher-than-average dose of alcohol. The Germans know what they're doing here: The alcohol marries the darker, ""beerier"" flavors with the sweeter ones, suppressing the bitterness of the former and the sugariness of the latter, resulting in an absurdly drinkable yet rich beer. This beer, along with most of Weihenstephan's offerings, underscores the level of precision with which Germans brew their beers. I am thoroughly impressed."
"feels a little thinner (but not much) than I would like, but still rich and creamy. very tasty and very drinkable."
"Notes: I was really excited to try the Korbinian, and while it wasn't awful by any stretch of the imagination, I was a bit disappointed. I will definitely have to give it another try sometime, as I think this one may be a bit elderly (why no freshness date?) Still, I can tell just by the flavors that are there that this could be a really good doppelbock. Stay tuned for an update..."
"Prosit!"
"(rated Jul 8, 2008)"
"Very drinkable."
"A well integrated drop. The highish ABV is not really noticeable."
"This is one of the best doppelbocks I've ever had."
"Taste: Not as big of a taste as Salvator delivers but it's still real good."
""
"Notes: I still can't believe I never had this. I've had better Dopplebocks, but I can only imagine this on-tap. I bet that'd be a treat."
"Darn good beer. This beer is big, rich and balanced as only the Germans can do. It is a lusciously creamy beer full of malt but never overly syrupy or sweet. It glows magenta brown with a frothy head and moderate lacing. The nose is sweet and malty with a subtle hop tartness. The flavor has huge malt-centric complexity. There are flavors of oak, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, nutty grain and soft yeasty dough. The finish is unobtrusively bitter. The beer coats the mouth pleasantly but never stickily, and the feel is velvet smooth. This doppelbock is very much bread in a mug with oodles of malt flavor. The balance of flavors really pushes the Korbinian over and above the vast majority of similar big bocks. Weihenstephaner's Korbinian is an absolutely fantastic beer and shows off the depth and quality of German brewing."
"It's dangerously good."
"D - Definitely not a session beer, at least not for me. This is a great beer to take your time with and appreciate, or enjoy with a cigar if you're so inclined. Could also go well with strong cheese."
"Drinkability: With the great smooth taste, it is the type of beer that can quickly disappear from your reserves. A good job making it full enough to counteract the higher alcohol."
"A pretty tasty Doppelbock. Definitely on the sweet side, but complex enough to be interesting and enjoyable."
"Big, molasses-sweet beer. Pours ruddy-brown with a small tan head. Caramel aroma. Thick caramel and malt flavor that seems to coat your tongue. Nice velvet mouthfeel I was looking for in thsi doppel. Alcoholic bite in the finish. Exceptionally smooth and just heavy enough to enjoy."
"D- one of these was enough. very different than what im used to, and very complex. a fantastic bargain brew, but the sweetness got to me after a while."
"A great doppelbock and a very enjoyable brew. One that I would definitely revisit given the opportunity."
"A pleasant experience."
"4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4"
"D: Very nice beer all around, well worth a try."
"The low carbonation and rich flavor tend to make this beer feel bigger than it is. It's full of dark fruits like cherries, blackberries, and plums along with black licorice and a ting of cocoa powder. The body is thick, but smooth, and this beer is resonably drinkable if you take it nice and slow."
"D - Great flavor throughout the life of this beer. Alcohol is noticeable a bit in taste and moreso in affect after an entire bottle. Certainly worth seeking out for any fan of the doppelbock style."
"""Found at a new store down in the big city to the south. Brown pour, very brown mild head and not much lacing. Aroma is of bakery sweet rolls, rather malty and sugary. Filling mouthfeel, real smooth finish bites a little. Flavor is too sugary sweet for my liking, but this being a dopplebock it's not a surprise. Bready with decent malt content it's one and out for this brew."""
"D: Very pleasant drinkability and loved every sip of it. Perfect by example and one I could drink again and again."
"The thing I love about this Dunkel is the refined profile from the nose to the finish. Not to sweet or strong like some Dunkels, this is a malt forward dark lager that has a refined taste and a very smooth finish. Like the Hefe , these guys are alla about top notch quality. Perfect Fall beer"
"D- It's a great sipper full of flavor. The only keeping me back from another is the higher alcohol content. I'd look for this one again."
"Another fine beer from Weihenstephaner. Totally drinkable. The higher ABV (7.4%) is masked well by a complex aroma and distinctly dry but sweet flavor. A great doppelbock for sure."
"Nice looking beer with rich melanoiden aroma with some roastiness and fruit. Tastes similar to aroma, very drinkable with good attenuation and correctly, no hop bitterness. Slightly coats the tongue. One of the more roasty DB's, but not overyl so. Very good beer as are most from this brewery."
"A very nice beer. One that is all too easy to drink, given the abv."
"Fairly drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is good. This is probably a one a night beer for me. But man, it's complex, and one is a very nice treat."
"Pours a dark brown with a decent tan head that fades. Smells of sweet malts and some brown sugar. Tastes of very smooth malts with some caramel flavor and texture. No hoppyness or bitter taste, very clean. Its has a nice rich mouthfeel, and it goes down easy. I highly reccomend."
"Extremely drinkable for such a complex beer. It's the first doppelbock I've had, but I plan on having more of the style and of this particular one as well."
"Overall, a very nice doppelbock that gives Celebrator a run for its money."
"D - A big bold beer for sure, but not hard to drink at all. There's a great balance between the roasted flavors and sweet stuff making this all too easy to drink quickly. A great beer for sure."
"this doppelbock pours a nice dark rubyred with an off white head that fades slowly. the smell shows off a generous malt bill, with a lot of roasted caramel aroma's. the taste is very full of malt with a smooth sweet finish the moderate co2 and full body make this an enjoyable beer, thaks weswes."
"Split this with my father-in-law over the weekend. Poured into a chalice a burnt caramel brown, with a thin sandy head which quickly faded to nothing, leaving speckled lacing on the inside of my glass. Aroma was dark fruit and malt, figs, raisins, reminded me of port wine. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, a little loose and slippery, with medium carbonation. Taste was full of dark fruit, figs, plums, dates, with a bit of a chocolate background and a slightly sour, vinous finish. Drinkability is high despite the ABV, due to the interesting complexities of the taste that kept me interested in identifying all the different flavors. Overall this was quite an interesting brew, and I may pick another one up to keep for myself."
"Deep dark copper color. Not cloudy. Persistant light khaki colored head. Nose is sweet full maltiness, toffee, roastiness and solvent. Mouthfeel is rich with a lighter clean finish. Drinkability is wonderful. Taste is raisin, prune, tartness, cranberry, roasted coffee, wine, chocolate and cherries all wrapped in a nice bow of crispness in the finish."
"Intense, full flavor of kilned malt, with a definite alcoholic aftertaste. Pretty low bitterness. Heavy mouthfeel is a good consistency, pretty smooth. Carbonation is minimal. Definite coffee flavors swirling around with the alcohol-- tasty. The soy sauce thing carries through to the taste, something that is interesting but I'm not wild about-- ehhh. Saltiness in a beer is just a little strange, but I do like it sometimes. Overall a unique flavor profile and a solid doppelbock."
"Very good example of the style, recommended."
"MF&D - Chewy and delicious. An excellent example of the doppelbock syle. A must try."
"Thanks to my brother (pojo41) for sharing this one with me. Poured an attractive dark brown/reddish color with a good head that didnt dissipate too quickly. Aroma was very malty. Flavor was also very malty with hints of chocolate, dark fruit, and roasted malt. Mouthfeel was good. This was a very nice doppelbock."
"22 oz would be a good amount to drink, the alcohol taste is a little to prominent to want to much."
"Very drinkable dopplebock."
"This beer is a bold offering from the world's oldest brewery (or so it says it is the world's oldest brewery on the bottle) that impressed me by the smooth bittersweet drinkability of a true German beer."
"Drinkability: A great, classic doppelbock - really nice, full malt bill, not too light nor too dark, and with a very nice manageable alcohol level."
"Pours dark brown with a chestnut hue with thick tan rocky head that leaves a few lines of delicate lace. Aroma of roaster malts and a little sweetness, caramel, and even maybe a hint of sour apple. Nice roasted malt flavor with light hop bitterness and a rich malty aftertaste and a slightly sweet finish. Full bodied with a creamy texture and mild carbonation. This is a tasty beer with an excellent mouthfeel and clean malty flavor."
"This is a brick in the stomach, though. Wouldn't want to drink more than one, wouldn't really work on a hot day. Not a ""refreshing"" beer-definately a nite-cap beer."
"Drinkability: Oh, it's very drinkable. The alcohol is barely perceptible, which is impressive for a 7.4 ABV brew. I plan to drink a lot of this during the cold-weather months. It goes down smooth, sweet, and delicious, and it leaves you thirsty for more. What's not to like?"
"Drinkability is good. Probably the best dopp I've had. Very good."
"A great beer, and a wonderful example of a Dopplebock. Get some."
"Why dont you get this beer, go to the gym and pump each other?"
"d: a wonderful doppelbock. Full on flavor, but not overly sweet. Love the prune/chocolate notes. very smooth and easy drinking."
"Drinkability was fine,one and I was done."
"Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy. Super malty sweetness keeps the drinkability from being very high."
"This one is good, but there are a few better ones out there."
"Overall, a one and done beer for me. I love their other beers but this one just didn't do it for me. Oh well, guess I'll just have to buy more of their world class hefe."
"Overall - Another outstanding and nicely balanced German Doppelbock... recommended..."
"D - This is defintely a malt bomb. Nice flavor and very thick. Perfect for a winters night. Not quite a session ale, but an enjoyable drinker."
"Poured a syrupy brown body with heavy carbonation and a two-finger head that died quickly but left lace rings. It smelled a little dry and grainy with an alcohol smell noticeable, but also malts like roast and chocolate are prevelant. A semi-creamy, smooth, medium-bodied beer that contains some sweetness thanks to roasted, chocolate, caramel and butterscotch malts (at least that's what I tasted) with a crisp, slightly dry backbite with some toffee and coffee malts. Even though this is a little simplistic I could session this and recommend it to anyone."
"Pours a deep ruby brown with a nice light tan head. nose is nice and malty with that respective lagery graininess. Taste is quite nice with a good malty kick, grainy lager flavor, some really nice caramel and sugar flavors through the middle. Mouthfeel is just about perfect here. Really very good. Dry finish. Drinkability is second to very few here, really couldn't ask for a more drinkable doppelbock. This being the first time I have delved into weihenstephaner products outside of their wheat wizardry, I am quite impressed. A very solid brewing company, and one any german fan will not be let down in purchasing. Strongly recommended."
"D: While doppelbock isn't my favorite style of beer, I tried this one because Weihenstephaner does such good work. This one, like their other efforts is well done and drinkable."
"D: A very good dopplebock from the oldest brewery in the world, one of the class of its style for sure."
"D: A nice combination of mouthfeel and taste. Will not be able to drink a lot of it because of its strong malts that tend to fill you up. Overall, a good beer and recommended."
"Big, flavorful and sweet."
"Drinkability: A very quaffable brew this one, and at 3 bucks a pop very affordable, I repeat Celebrator is the God of doppels until someone else climbs Mount Olympus to unseat it. But for the price I'll probably have this one slightly more often."
"I used it in the preparation of Doppelbock-Thai pork balls served with a spicy peanut sauce, with snap peas and rice noodles. A glass of it along with the meal was a divine pairing. This would be good with an array of desserts as well."
"I was already an unabashed fan of the other offerings from this brewer, and I am once again tasked with finding superlatives that do justice to the absolute superiority of another of their drinks. Calling this beer 'Outstanding' simply fails to it justice, and while 'Excellent' certainly seems a more accurate praise, I'm think in love, and in acknowledging that with my rose-colored-glasses firmly in place, I'll simply say that no compliment short of 'Magnificent' will do as my adjective of choice to describe this nectar-of-the-gods, this luscious concoction Weihenstephaner calls 'Korbinian.'"
"There aren't many lagers I've had that I really enjoy but Doppelbocks have been an exception. This is another nice one, definitely recommended."
"D: This beer is easy to drink and feels like a big brew. I love this beer and I love this brewery. I can drink this all day. I love my German beers."
"D- This is very drinkable, I could almost pound the beer it is so easy to drink."
"Served in my Leute Bok glass. Poured a deep, opaque brown/black. One-inch, dense, off-white head with lots of tiny ringlets embedded in the foam. Head eventually settled into a slick of foam that coalesced around the shoulders; no lacing adhered during the tasting. Scents of dark fruit, malt, toffee and molasses; nose was extremely complex and difficult differentiate all of the aromas. Taste consisent with nose; however, complexity seemed to strike a more even balance in the mouth. Mouthfeel was surprisingly light considering the bold nose and flavors. Not much carbonation present and alcohol was very well-hidden. I'm not typically a fan of the style, but have been so impressed by Weihenstephaner's other offerings that I thought it was worthy of a try. I was not dissapointed."
"If there's a downside, it's the watery mouthfeel. Still, a great beer."
"Poured a dark brown with red hue when held to the light and a generous tan head that dissipated somewhat quickly into a tiny layer. Smells like a typical dopplebock, dark fruit, dark sweet malt. Tastes are sweet bready malt flavors, some caramel and little hop presence. Alcohol is hidden quite nicely. Good full bodied mouthfeel and decent carbonation level help add to the nice drinkability especially for a 7.4% beer. I'm a big fan of malty German lagers and this is no exception. Great beer, that I would love to drink some more of but this damn bottle went and emptied itself."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a medium slightly tan head. Very little lacing. Aroma is carmel, raisins, and chocolate. Taste is sweet but tempered by some bitterness from the roasted malt. Notes of chocolate, dark fruit, and caramel. Some herbal hops but the malt is the big story here. Full bodied with low carbonation. Maybe a bit syrupy. Fairly heavy but a .5L is easily drinkable. Not my favorite doppelbock but still pretty tasty stuff."
"i was excited when i first saw this in my downtown beer store, but it seemed to fall when i popped it open at home... pours with a lack luster head, and has a molasses, toffee strange sugar aroma... 1 in 5 americans has genital herpes... some nice flavours and abv is well hidden but it doesn't really do it for me... happy to try it, happier i won't have to again!!"
" The palate is full of rich, caramelly dark malt up front, while some lighter notes of toffee and light-roast coffee come through before the swallow. The finish is full of dark fruity notes and more brown sugar that lingers for a while in the back of the throat. Body is rich and full, but not too thick. While the alcohol is well-integrated, this is still a bit too strong to drink like a session beer. Nevertheless, this is a well-built doppelbock, and one that I'm glad is finally making its way to Oregon."
"Pour me another please, I could drink these all night."
"M/D - Full bodied and very slick in the mouth. A great doppelbock and very drinkable."
"Clear and quite dark brown in color (bottle looks cool too). Tan head that I couldn't seem to get too tall when pouring but lacey. Smells somewhat like a subdued rauchbier with notes of smoke and jerky... almost like dogfood, haha, the least pleasant feature of this experience. At first it tastes smokey that tingles in accordance with the hop profile. As it warms the caramelly malts come through. This stuff is restorative but not too thick but certainly not watery. Never found any moment where it was too sweet, I almost wanted a little more bready sweetness in this. suggested."
"Pours a clear brownish red with a medium sized tan head. Aroma is wonderful malty, caramel, a slight smoked aroma, light chocolate notes, hops, and dark fruit. Taste is a distinct mouth filling maltiness, caramel, chocolate, still a little bit of smoke, lovely combination of flavors. Palate is lightly bitter and a light malt texture. This is the first time I saw this in the store and I'd have to say I'm pleasantly surprise. A very nice doppelbock, definitely recommended."
"This beer is delicious and remarkably easy to drink considering the ABV."
"Finish is lightly sweet with some alcohol. Warming."
"Heaviness precludes supreme drinkability but this is a well-made, amazing effort."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass. Pours a beautiful color, like a dark cherry wood. Crytal clear with off-white head. Very poor retention and no lacing. Smell is of sweet malt, some bread, and dark fruit...smells very ""belgian-like"" which is good. Taste is great as well, very complex. There is strong malt backbone with some fruit undertones. Strong caramel presence as well. Low carbonation leads into a medium mouthfeel, it leaves a slightly oily sensation in the mouth. Overall a very good beer."
"my 200th. review, pours a deep mahogany w/ a thin tan cap that dissipates quickly leaving a nice lacing in my pilsn glass ; a moderate smell, caramel/toffee aroma with hints of alcohol and dark fruits ; a sweet, rich malty flavor w/ loads of caramel and dates up front with a well balanced hop bitterness, some alcohol and metal detected in the fairly crisp finish ; a med-full body on this one, but not too cloying, a moderate co2 level ; an excellent brew, one of the most drinkable dopplebocks i've ever had, i can't wait to get some more (on a side note it pairs quite well w/ pork chops)..."
"Pours brown in color with a very nice, two inch beige head. Smell is all toffee and malt. Wonderful. Taste is the same. More toffee than you can imagine. There was a bit of grain and nuts hidden in the taste as well. Incredibly smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel. This is a truly great bock. I think this would be incredible on draft."
"I would be inclined to drink this more than some doppelbocks just because the sweetness is not overdone. Great complexity for a doppelbock, so many of which in my experience tend to be caramel malt and little else. I think I'd still take a Celebrator first, but this is a not very distant 2nd."
"Well, I see what all the fuss was about now. This is absolutely delicious. Sweet and caramelly with a nice toasted bread flavor and also that hint of dark fruit (what is that?)coming in right at the finish. No alcohol present in this bottle, just a sweet malty goodness that leaves me wishing I had more... Many more..."
"Really enjoyable. Surprisingly, there's something quite refreshing in the taste & mouthfeel here that I haven't experienced in many doppelbocks before. Will definitely get again."
"Pours a clear color which changes drastically depending the light it's up against. Has brown, red, and orange copper highlights. Medium head falling to a ring, steady carbonation. Smell attacked my nose right when I popped the cap. Huge sweetness was the impression I got. Caramel, toffee, a light spice, and some fruit. Glorious toasted grain and bread. Taste is superb. A delicate sweetness that is never overdone. Caramel and toffee are for sure there again. Hints of a wonderful nutty flavor and again this luscious bready aftertaste that I can and will not get enough of...give me another damn bottle! This stuff is lovely. In the mouth it's just a tad more full than you'd think but still great. Very easy going down. A solid, solid brew. I must remember to pick this up more often."
"This is pretty classic doppelbock, but not as good as Ayinger Celebrator which is a slightly better representation of the style. The beer pours a fairly clear deep amber, ruby brown with a tannish head that lingers and slightly retains. The smell is sweetish malt, molasses, caramel, a strong toffee/butterscotch backbone, and just nice roasted grains. There is a sweetishness to the smell which is characteristic of the style. This is a medium bodied beer, with not much carbonation, a loads of character. The taste is very chewy, and has all the notes you get in the aroma: toffee, butterscotch, loads of caramel, molasses, roasted grains. There is a puckerishness to the beer in the finish. The beer is chewy and creamy, with a slightly oily mouthfeel. The alcohol is present, slightly warming, with no throatiness at all. This is a really nice beer if you're in the mood for a dobbelbock. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability is high for the abv as the alcohol hides behind the malt and caramel. An excellent cold night warmer, cool weather refresher, and compliment to a hearty meal. Perfect for the transition from winter to spring."
"Glad to try this one, not my favorite but an interesting beer on all accounts."
"I rated this fairly high, but to me it only slightly eclipses optimator and celebrator. The mouthfeel, drinkability, and appearance were all spectacular. But the two most important aspects of a beer (for me), aroma and taste, were good but not spectacular."
"The alcohol hit is more pronounced."
"Slightly translucent beer, reddish brown, with a thin tan head. Looks pretty good. Nose is alcohol, brown sugar, and malts. Taste is Euro hops, raw sugar, and slight alcohol. A bit of a wild flavor. More alcohol on warming. Mouthfeel is foamy and yet full."
"Poured from a bomber into a weizen glass. Poured dark brown with ruby hues forming an even 1/2 inch tan sticky head leaving behind speckled lacing with each sip. Big malt smells from this one followed by prunes, raisins and figs. Sweet malty taste with a light pancake syrup flavor finishing with a slight wine sweetness. Light carbonation and medium body leaving the mouth feeling slick between sips. Very nice beer although a little on the barleywine sweet side. Definitely worth trying."
"This one is a meal in a bottle. Heavy malts without any of that hoppiness or estery yeast flavors to get in the way. This is a better example of a doppelbock. One to be enjoyed. Recommended."
"Overall - Very good, but not my favourite Doppelbock."
"Poured from a bottle into a DAB mug. Pours a deep brown with a light amber hue. Surprisingly big head along with this beer. Smell is relatively subdued and somewhat sour. Taste is a mixture of nuts, grain, and a little bit of bitter fruit. A medium-bodied beer with a decent amount of carbonation. Pretty damn drinkable!"
"D - Outstanding, another impressive brew from a solid brewery. I could go for another anytime. Big reco here."
"Taste: The aroma lied. This is a very rich beer with all of the features I love so much about doppelbocks. Huge malt punch, primarily caramel with a slight chocolate note and a hint of toasted bread. Balance comes in the midpalate, where there is some faint balancing hop - just enough. Finishes very smooth with a slight, fleeting alcohol burn in the back of the throat, just to remind you of the 7.4%..."
"The mouthfeel is rather velvety, with those muted chocolate notes sliding across the palate delicately. There's a backing dark fruit and toffee character, which serves to prop up the malt without getting too heavy on the tongue, especially in the finish. An impressive showing, actually, and a definite uniqueness compared to other of its ilk."
"Overall, a very good example of the style. Well balanced, unlike many domestic interpretations. The Germans definately make the best dopple, which really is no surprise."
"Another great offering from one of Germany's most dependable brewers. Whatever they do they do very well. Prost!"
"D = Good drinkability, a very pleasing doppelbock."
"Highly recommend, would be awesome alongside a meal. Good job Old Bay carrying this one."
"Beer poured brown with ruby undertones. Head was perfect upon initial pour but quickly dissapated. Nose is very malty with strong dark fruits present. Taste is a blast of toasted malts, dark fruits, slightly balanced by some light hopping at the end. Mouthfeel is all about the classic Weihenstephaner yeast which glides the beer across the palate. It is surprisingly lighter than what I would have expected for the style. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is well hidden, the flavors somewhat complex, and the smoothness is very satisfying. Another fine beer from my favorite German brewer."
"D: Yep, like most German beer."
"I'd like to add that this beer improved as it warms IMO. I served at the recommended temperature and found it to feel a little thin and lack some flavor. However, as it warmed it felt a little thicker (which I really like) and the flavors came out more."
"Never had seen this anywhere and only have had this brewery's hefeweiss, so I decided to check this one out, surprsingly very good, one of my friends said it was one of the best beers he has ever had, do not know about that, but still rather tasty stuff, would drink again, recommended"
"Drinkability on this one is fantastic. Very refreshing and approachable. Nothing overpowering with any of the flavors. A great, well-balanced beer."
"It starts off with a malty/sweet flavor. That is followed up by a nice slightly hop finish. It goes down quiet smooth without a bitter after taste."
"D'ability - Not as syrupy sweet as some doppelbocks, so probably more drinkable than some."
"Hazy burnt-caramel amber in color with a yellowish white head and thin lacing running down the glass. Nose of plum, molasses, caramel, fresh bread, and some dark cherry. Smells oh so sweet. Tasted of prunes and raisins, some molasses, a slight bit nutty, with some bitterness coming in on the back end. Very drinkable. Very good."
"Truly one fantastic Dopplebock. I'm going to have to put this head to head with Celebrator, as this just might have a shot at the title."
"D: Very tasty and very complex and well balanced mix of flavors but the lack of a solid enough backbone of carbonation sort of make this one difficult to drink and entire bottle of before the sweetness began to take the beer over. Still not bad at all."
"Aroma and flavor still the same old doppelbock. Big caramel maltiness with a flash of hop leaf. Prominent Munich yeast strain. Big thick and creamy mouthfeel, finish is spicy with a lot of sweetness. Never gets cloying or sticky. Outstanding doppelbock out of the keg."
"Overall, this a very good doppelbock. As for the characteristics, there is everything here one would expect for the style (anything less from a German brewer would pretty much be an insult). The ABV isn't too high, which keeps the drinkability fairly solid, my only complaint would be maybe just a bit more fruity flavors than I tend to like for the style. That said, I like drinking my doppelbocks at nearly cellar temp, so this tends to bring out many different flavors."
"D- Great taste and texture; can't really complain."
"The body is medium. Very crisp. The flavors wash away quite clean as well, leaving only a gentle lingering of the spicy hops and chocolate. Quite an enjoyable drink, aside from the unfortunate nose."
"D: Excellent taste makes this easier to quaff than the ABV would/should allow. Alcohol is well hidden!"
"D - This is another very good beer from Weihenstephaner this is one of those good enjoyable sipper brews"
"-Oelergud"
"Very smooth on the palate, with great carbonation and a nice medium-full body. A bit too sweet to be incredibly drinkable."
"Maybe the problem is from having hot sauce before the drink. I would call this one a one timer. I want go back unless it was the only one left."
"The finish lingered, and it was sweetly meaty, making a fine transition right through to the end. I have to get more, make some stew with it, and then drink it, too."
"D: This one easy brew to drink. Medium bodied, well balanced, moderate ABV...great from start to finish..not that I would want to finish drinking this until after a long, long session."
"Appearance dark brow almost black hints of orange on edges one finger tan head that left a nice layer of foam as it settled. Smell rosted malt dark fruits and and a sweetness almost like maple syrup. Taste much the same as the smell but a hint of alcohol in their. Mouthfeel was almost silky heavy in body and mediem carbonation. Drinkability great for a cold winter night like this."
"great drinkabiliy for such sweet 7.4% abv beer. goes down mighty quick without wrecking your tounge or turning your stomach."
"drinkability is good. although this is a strong brew both in profile and alcoholic presence, the flavors and aromas combine into an enjoyable doppelbock. cheers!"
"Strong throughout, this Doppelbock is full of malt and mouthfeel. A really good beer."
"This is one massive malt bomb of a beer. Absolutely incredible. I loves me a malty and delicious doppelbock, and this is the best I have tasted. I can't wait to get my hands on some more of this nectar of the gods."
"I know this is heresy, but I don't get the great reviews of this brew. The only other doppelbock I've had is Optimator, which I LOVE and have had on many occasions. I also love Weihenstephaner Hefe, and get into high-ABV Belgians also. But this beer is so alcoholic it seems like it should be medicine. I guess I'm just not man enough!"
"D - Very good brew would drink again if given the chance"
"Purchased a 1 pint, .9 fl oz bottle from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... Weihenstehpaner's Hefeweizen was an outstanding brew, so I had high hopes for their Doppelbock... ""Brewed under the purity law of 1516"" on the logo sticker... Pours a grape, dark, ebony hue with an impressive frothy and foamy head... smell was complete with roasted malts, figs, and prunes... taste strongly complemented the aroma, along with noticeable dark sugars, caramel and dehyrdated fruits... the malt flavor really dominates this one... an excellent depiction of the style, with a wonderful sugar-sweet, thick taste, incredibly thick and rich mouthfeel, and a good drinkability that took a hit because of the ultra-rich, and ultra-thick flavor and mouthfeel that dominated this brew... good stuff... good representation of the style... Definitely recommeneded..."
"A very good example of the style. Well balanced and moderately complex that suits well with many meals."
"Korbinian pours a modest finger of tan froth on a mahogany body. The smell is wonderful, with chocolate, hints of coffee, caramel, and fruit emerging, heavy on the chocolate. Same with the taste, which is glorious. I'm slightly less impressed with the mouthfeel, which veers a little too much into the syrupy, but is ameliorated with fine carbonation. In sum, this is a very good dopplebock, delicious, different, yet easily drinkable. Well worth trying."
"This is a great easy drinking german beer. Weihenstephaner brews extremely clean, flavorful beer with nice medium body. the Korbinian has an earthy carmel color, nice light head and a wet mouthfeel. This is a great beer, but Weihenstephaner does best with their lighter, weizen beers in my opinion. Overall a good beer, from a great brewery."
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: Ring of Fire by the Man in Black"
"What can i say, the beer speaks for itself, i was in a specialty store in PHX looking for some brew and found this. Ever since i don't want to drink anything else. No matter where the party is who i'm with, if i have a couple bottles of Korbinian with me i know that i'm in for a good time. PROST!"
"I was expecting more from this beer. Poured straight into a glass and there was plenty of foam for about 10 mins. After about 10 mins, the foam disapeared and it looked more like flat coke. It wasn't overly bitter, a little bit of sweetness, and had that distinct German yeast flavor. I like this brand of beer, but Hefeweizens are more of my type. I wasn't feeling this one."
"A solid beer worthy of its reputation. Very drinkable as the alchohol flavors are hardly perceptable and the beer does not get overly sweet or heavy on the palate. Well balanced with very nice flavors coming through."
"Pours a nice brown color with nice head and lacing. Good scent, a nice malty aroma, but nothing very deep. Very good taste, a nice maltiness with a great caramel flavor. Goes down great, could not even detect the higher ABV (which really wasn't that high for a good doppel). An excellent beer for cold winter nights or to welcome the spring. Or anytime, really."
"restorative after hard play at the beach on a cold day."
"nice head that settles quickly and pours a dark brown color. Smell is of carmel and mault, with a heavy taste of mault and thickness. this is my least fav type of beer, but I rated it based on the others I've had. The carmel taste and smell makes it better than the others I have had though."
"D: Fantastic. I will most definitely go with this one again. I am wishing I had some more to enjoy at least one more bottle."
"D: Drinkability is pretty solid. It goes down easy enough, that's for sure. However, it is incredibly sweet, and I don't lnow how many I'd want. But the 7.40% ABV is not in evidence at all, and it makes for smooth drinking."
"A very good example of a doppelbock. Too bad I didn't have this in my possession when I did the ""Weihenstephaner Invite"" many months ago, it would have made a great contestant."
"Pours a clouded ruby brown with basically no head that falls fast. Nose is malty and sweet smelling. Flavor is rich with a caramel character and a thick body of ingredients. Feel is smooth with a nice bubble on the tongue and a thicker liquid feel that is slightly silky. Definitely drinkable. Easily sessionable. Damn good."
"D: Very tasty and hits the spot when I want a creamy, malty brew. Reasonably priced to boot. I'll drink this again."
"Ushering in the New Year with a Weihenstephaner's Korbinian! It is not exactly a specialty beer but definitely a renown and highly acclaimed beer. Being my first Weihenstephaner beer, I guess it is a good choice of a usher-in-the-new-year beer. OK down to business, this beer pours with a fairly large head into my Schneiderweisse Weizen glass; not the weizen style huge head of cos but a > 1 inch head that was creamily inviting. The liquid below was dark ruby brown in color. After the while the head reduces to a nice thin and clingy layer above the nectar below. The smell was not very strong but the malt aromas were clear with a nutty yeasty backing. I could also detect a dash of spices and maybe smoke somewhere and some caramel notes. The smell could really have been stronger than this. The taste starts off with a true malt strength with strong caramel notes and very subtle sweetness; I am also picking up spices (cloves) and a certain nuttiness here. The finish revealed some aromas of banana and some dark fruits and malts were also picked up on the nose. The after taste started off bready malty and with a fair amount of banana; it slowly reveals some notes of raisins before finally fading away. Truly a great taste which gets a little better as the beer warms. The mouthfeel was around medium body or slightly thicker with an apt amount of carbonation and nice creamy smoothness throughout; it finishes slightly dry. I pretty enjoy this beer; still prefer Belgian Dark Ales but this one really hit the spot for tonight. I prefer it to the Andechsers Doppelbock."
"This is one of the best doppelbocks that I've had and I will continue to buy it."
"Dusty aftertaste, with liquorice and burnt bitterness in the end."
"But the quaff was top-notch; a rich and malty caramel/chocolate combo platter thats not overly sweet  but balanced well. Dopple-alcohol is nowhere to distract from the overall enjoyment of this sturdy brew."
"drinkability is good. alcohol is almost completely hidden. love the big malt in this one. wish this one was available locally..."
"This beer poured a dark clear amber color and formed a bubbly light tan head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, cocoa, and coffee. The flavor was of malt, coffee, chocolate and plums. It has a medium light body with a slightly sweet finish."
"D - nice doppelbock, it's very tasty, but I suppose I didn't expect less from the masters at Weihenstephan"
"D: This is a very drinkable beer - great for a pub with some chicken wings, etc. I will be drinking it again."
"Pours a very dark ruby brown color with an average tan head that dissipated into a ring around the glass. Looks very much like cola. The smell is of raisins, molasses, and light bitter chocolate. The taste is of roasted malt and roasted cashews, lightly meaty, with hints of chocolate milk and dark grapes. The feel is well bodied with prickly carbonation, yet finishes smooth, though a bit sticky. Good balance between sweet and bitter. A good dopplebock and worth a try. Quite a mellow brew."
"Overall this was a good doppelbock, one that I will drink again."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, nice kick, good representation of style, if I were going to stick with a good sweet beer for an entire evening, this would certainly be it."
"Drinkability: Fairly good, but one bottle is plenty due to the assertive sweetness."
"D - This is a fun beer but not something I would want all night."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite Doppelbocks. It's neither overly sweet nor overly alcoholic. A must-try for any Doppelbock fan."
"Pours a clear but dark brown with copper highlights and a beige creamy cap. Heavy malts, molasses, brown sugar, hints of coffee, and slight ashy or smoky character. Malt flavor is much drier and roasted than the nose indicates. Charred sugars, some caramel, and some fruity prune flavor that picks up as it warms. Hops offers some fruit character with just a touch of pepper at the end. Yeasty twang is slight but makes a nice dynamic between the malt and hops. Caramel and coffee notes in the finish. Zippy carbonation is just right, medium body and a smooth rounded mouthfeel is again near perfect."
"Ok, so here is where it starts to get good. I love me a Dopplebock, now that is for sure. When I saw this sitting on the shelf there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to be getting it. Just had to be. Poured a deep dark russet brown with a small, maybe an inch or so of off white head grazing over the top of it. There was significant side glass lace throughout the session and the overall look of it was quite thick. The aroma was of slight smoked variety. A little bit of roasted malt with a touch of caramel to sweeten in up. The taste was remarkably smooth and delicious. Great full body on this one, definitely not thin. Nice and mellow smoky flavor with a huge earthy and bread like back. A nice caramel sugar sweet finish brought it all together. No taste of alcohol at all and overall it was a very easy drinker. I could have easily had another. The carbonation stayed very nice throughout the session. I would have to say one of my favorites so far, this was very tight and a fine brew. Very surprised I had not seen it earlier as it is always around. Will be getting more next time I am in the store. This is perfect with dinner and something that I would like to have always at easy reach."
"Wow, this is definitely the most drinkable high ABV beer I have tried. It is quite sweet, but has the flavour and alcohol bite to back it up. This is first of its style for me, and the more I drank, the more I liked it. Worth the exxy price and the premium over other Weihenstephaner beers."
"Very good for a dopplebock. Has a tremendous amount of flavor and really fills you up."
"Highly reccomended. One of the best of it's style."
"D: I'm glad I finally tried another Weihenstephaner, this time not a wheat. Now I can confirm I like their whole range of beers."
"Weihenstephaner Korbinian pours a dark mahogany colored brown with a thin tan head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is tremendously malty. The flavor is malt, malt and more malt, and a touch of dark fruit. An absolute must for malt heads. Extremely well made and tasty. Recommended."
"I would pick this one up again if i saw it on the shelf"
"D- Spectacular. For the ABV and level of richness, this went down fairly quickly. Very tasty and highly recommended."
"Pours out a dark maple syrup with a moderate sized beige head. Leaves some whispy lacing. The nose is all coffee, raisins, and chocolate. Flavor starts off with loads of dried fruits, which then segues into some toasted malts. Towards the finish, the malts take on more of a fully roasted quality and impart chocolate tones as well. Finishes relatively dry. Mouthfeel is full-bodied yet not exactly sticky. Carbonation is a little strong for me here. Impressive."
"One of the better Dopples I have had. Excellent!"
"d: quite easy for such a beer...very German in character and highly recommended"
"Drinkability: good, it's no Celebrator, but it's a very good, representative doppelbock. I didn't know it was so highly rated when I bought it, nor when I started drinking it - tend to think it's a tad undeserved, but still very good."
"Drinkability - Complex and good body, but light dry finish. This is easy to drink."
"This brewery does not make a bad beer, and here is just another example. This beer pours an brownish, burnt orange which turns to a sort of ruby when held up to light. Aroma is big-time malty, chocolate, grains, chocolate cereal (like cocoa puffs). Taste is dominate by the malt chocolate taste, with tinges of caramel, coffee and dates. Bitterness doesn't hide at the back end, leaving you with a dry but refreshing finish. This beer goes down clean and smooth. I would still rank celebrator above this fine brew, but I'll still make room for it on my beer budget."
"Pours a black color, nice carbonation, huge three finger plus creamy tannish head, lots of sticky/creamy lacing to follow. The nose is malty, kinda yeasty/bready, lots of caramel. The taste is absolutely delicious, malty, slight licorice, maybe some spice's, and lots of caramel. Medium body, very smooth/creamy brew. Very drinkable, man what an awesome Doppelbock, I thought Celebrator was one of the best if not the best, this brew is totally different in body/charactrer. It could be the ABV thing though."
"Drinkability - This is a sipper. One to finish the night while watching the latter part of a baseball game is a fine environment for this beer. Very enjoyable and very much worth it's salt. I would place this above my other Doppel favorate (Celebrator)."
"The profile says that this is a winter release, but we picked it up yesterday (in July), so be sure to check for it even out of season!"
"Beer poured a deep coppery color with a half inch head. Head retention faded to just skimming the top while I drank the beer. Smelled very malty with a smoky scent. Hints of coffee and caramel on my palate. Had just the right amount of carbonation. Tasted the alcohol but it was not overwhelming. Enjoyed this beer but probably wouldn't want more than two in a sitting."
"Pours a nice chocolatey colored brew with a nice beige/tan head. Nice looking brew. Smells of slight chocolatey malts and lots of them. Very nutty on the palate with a slight hop twinge on the back end, but not much. Light to medium bodied and highly drinkable. Although high ABV, could be a session brew, easily. A nice German beer by Weihenstephaner."
"D - Nice beer that is highly drinkable given its ABV%. Shame its not available more readily."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very deep ruby-copper color with a thick, tan, creamy looking head. The smell is primarily sweet with amber malt, there is a slight fruitiness that is apparent; also a slightly sweet alcohol characteristic. The taste is similar to the smell, mostly sweet with a slight presence of alcohol - a good slow drinking beer. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, fairly creamy and slightly dry on the finish. Overall, this beer is slightly better than average on drinkability because while it is a good sipping beer, I don't think you would want to try to drink too many 16.9 oz bottles @ 7.4%."
"This is simply a fantastic beer, more available than the Ayinger (at least where I shop), and a little less expensive. It's not a replacement, but it's a very close second in my book."
"*** Update MUCH LATER, almost 5 years to the day, in fact. I am very happy to report that Korbinian IS INDEED sold locally, and is my go-to doppelbock, when the desire strikes. If I reviewed again, this would score more of a 4.45. Weihenstephan can do no wrong."
"Highly recommended. It's still not Andechs Doppelbock, but it's up there. One of the best doppelbocks out there. You won't regret buying this one."
"D - Very good. Somehow this one had eluded me up until now. I would love to have it again. A great doppelbock."
"M/D: I am beg to really love bock beers of all types and this is no exception. this is a great beer to try and enjoy.it has a nice creamy overall feel and is just one you dont want to put down"
"EDIT: My old friend Boppar told me that Dunkles Starkbier means ""strong dark beer."" So basically, it's a German BSDA. So basically, it's awesome."
"This beer has been aging in Sam's storage for quite some time (Sam refused to tell me how long) as it has a completely different label than the current version of Korbinian. the beer has a hazy, dark amber color and is well carbonated, yet despite a vigorous pour did not summon forth much in the way of a head. There is a touch of a foamy, amber tinged ring around the sides of the glass. The beer has a soft, well integrated oxidation character to it; notes of sherry are definitely evident. The taste takes on notes of prunes, which are also noticeable in the nose as well. As the beer warms up a bit lots of flavors open up; notes of Madeira, sherry and fig become noticeable as well as a touch of chalky dark malt character in the finish. The beer also starts to become clearer as it warms. This has aged quite gracefully, certainly the flavors have softened and melded quite a bit, but this must be fairly old and it is still quite drinkable."
"Awesome stuff. Although I'm kind of new to the style, this is probably the best doppelbock I've had so far. It epitomizes the whole ""liquid bread"" description even more so than the Salvator I had yesterday. Just great. Highly recommended."
"The flavour is rich and complex with bitter-sweet dark chocolate and some roasty stuff going on too. It's all put together in a silky smooth and creamy melange. I really liked this beer but its a bit sweet for me to drink a lot. I loved the full-bodied complexity though...a lot."
"Marked 1306. Served well-chilled in a footed pilsner glass. Pours thickly; a deep bronze hue with a fluffy and dense dark khaki head. Bready, caramelized aromas predominate, with a subtle spice character lending an almost meaty quality to the scent. Substantial on the palate with a dense caramel and dark bread flavor. Leafy and dusky-herbal hop notes come through near the back end. The taste culminates with a pleasant bitterness that is muted by the dark-bread sweetness mentioned earlier. Full bodied to be certain, with a smooth feel. A sharp-edged mineral presence in the water gives an overall dry feel to this otherwise rich and malty beer. Wonderfully complex and nearly perfect in its balance. As fine an example of a doppelbock as I've ever encountered."
"Mouthfeel-Smooth but heavy malt body, sweet malt flavors with the bittersweet chocolate coming through and finishes somewhat sweet- I like this. A very mild bitterness is there early then fades to other sweet malt flavors. Is a little silky-smooth. A good froth reveals some of the alcohol for a warm finish and earthy hops are revealed here also. Very good Doppelbock and alcohol is well-hidden for 8%."
"Pours dark with a tan head which sticks around for a bit. Not too much lacing. Smell was a bit off, I think this bottle had seen better days. Fortunately the flavor was not affected. Sweet malt, dark chocolate and coffee flavors, with a bit of hops to balance the flavor. Don't know how old this beer was, but I suspect it was a bit too old. I would love to sample this beer at its peak. Even a little on the old side it's a respectable beer, quite drinkable even at 7.5% abv."
"The head pours out alright, but then leaves behind a 1/8 inch head covering the beer on top, so it's not that bad. The color is a deep brown, I can still see through it fine, but it's very brown with carbonation bubbling up all over. The smell is bready, and I can't smell much of anything else. The taste is off a bit, the sweetness has been morphed into a sour/sick flavor. The mouthfeel was ok, a little too carbonated, but ok. Overall I would have to take my time and find out a date of the next one of these I find."
"D- I think this one may be off. I can't tell how old it is and it just seems the metallic is way to strong for this brew. Also seems like some of the flavors are lacking and may have a few off tastes to them. I am going to try and try this another time when I am out of town (so I can get some fresher stuff) and see how it is then."
"Pours a dark rich amber with a thick creamy head. Smell of prunes, sweet fruit with chocolate. flavor of prunes, chocolate and a hint of burned sugar, having a thick creamy mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation to make it go down smooth, but leaving a certain metallic bitter aftertaste."
"D: I could drink this all night ... someone would have to carry me home, but it might just be worth it! The oldest brewery in the world sure knows how to make a great beer. Just like their other styles, this one is exceptional. If only Lent came more than once a year ... for the beer only that is!!"
"Really a fan of big malty beers, and this is one of my new favorites. Superb."
"D - Perfect. Rich, complex, creamy but oddly light in the mouth. A nearly perfect dopplebock."
"Overall this is a solid doppelbock. There are some unique characteristics you don't find in other doppelbocks, unfortuanately some of them don't add to the quality. Not as hearty as some others but still a good all around beer."
"Overall: A solid dopplebock with good malt character. Recommended."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite dopplebocks. The malt is huge , really well balanced , toasty and delicious. Super drinkable."
"Taste was a bit of a letdown, there was the sweet maltiness combined with the caramel, roast and mild molasses taste. However the body was rather thin and carbonation was lacking. This was unlike any other doppelbock I have had, which were all very full-bodied and more pronounced in malt and caramel flavors."
"D: Nice flavor, good balance. Overall cloying but not so much that its a turnoff. I like the vanilla aspects and would enjoyed a heavier dose than that."
"7.4 % ABV, .5L bottle, label code-5466. Dark brown in color with chestnut edges. Thick fluffy tan head. Very nice head retention. Nose suggests toffee, caramel, earthy and floral hops. Very rich and robust, with flavors of dark toffee. Not overly sweet despite being so rich. Oh, so smooth! Medium body, carbonation appropriate to style. A slight nutty flavor seems to linger and the finish. Very nice!"
"Overall it's enjoyable, defintely not a favourite import, but well worth trying."
"Overall, a fantastic Dopplebock, one of the best out there. Well balanced, no diacetyl, and well hidden alcohol. Highly recommended, and worth seeking out."
"This is an excellent beer all around. I will admit to not knowing much about German beer or Doppelbocks in general, but I know what I like, and this delivers it in spades. Highly recommended."
"Very pleasant."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with nice carbaonation. Overall, this is one of the better Doppelbock I have had."
"D - A nice Doppelbock, taste was kind of simple which is not necessarily a bad thing. I enjoyed the creaminess."
"A wonderful sipping brew that is all too easy to more than sip. Don't know that it has quite the complexities of some other Bavarian doppelbocks, but it sure is delicious, and smooth for style and abv. One of my favorites of the style."
"Very tasty and delicous, My new favorite Dopplebock."
"($2.69 / 16.9 oz / .5L tall brown sleek Euro-style bottle)"
"Great, great beer. One of my favorites, which is why I gave it such a high rating. If you see this anywhere, definitely pick one up and give it a shot."
"A very nice classic dopple. Flavor is mild and pleasant, though not as chewy and aggressive as some other dopplebocks (Optimator, Celebrator) allowing for amazing drinkability. Don't drink this one too cold or you will miss some of the complexity."
"Pours a murky, muddy brown with a light tan head. Aroma is of malt and caramel. Huge malt flavor with a cloying sweetness that really kills the enjoyment factor for this beer. Cut the sweetness in half and it would be a pretty good brew. I split a bottle with a friend and neither of us could finish this beer, it was just way too sweet."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale, and could be sessionable if you're careful not to overindulge, as this is just over what I consider to be the abv limit for sessionability ( i.e. 7% abv)."
"Drinkability...what a treat. I had Matt Capone (BA capones) special order this b/c I've never seen it in the SE PA market for some reason. No wonder it's such a rare treat...it gets gobbled up whenever it comes around."
"Great job, oldest brewery in the world!"
"Drinkability-- aside from any ABV% consideration, this is a very nice and very drinkable beer, which I would love to find on-tap."
"Pours a dark brown in color with auburn highlights and a tan head. Vinous aroma of plum with a bready maltiness to it. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Malty front with dark fruit that soon follows. Chocolate, rum and feint caramel toward the middle. The hop bitterness is relatively low. Vinous toward the back with some alcohol to comprise a dry finish. Very easy drinking doppelbock. Flavors all meld so well that none in particular really stand out, rather they assemble a nice balance all-together. Definitely worth trying, but still not my favorite doppelbock."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Poured from a .5L bottle into my nonic pint glass. A fabulous dopplebock from the oldest brewery in the world. Poured a beautiful mahogany brown with a creamy light brown head. Smells of sweet malt, raisin, and caramel toffee. Taste is wonderful, sweet and malty with hints of toffee, prunes and a little bit of chocolate. Has a great, full bodied mouthfeel and is very smooth. This is a fantastic dopplebock. I wish I would have picked up more than one bottle. Will definitely seek this out often."
"D - tasty, tasty example of the doppelbock style. Great flavor and aroma."
"This doppelbock poured a dark, cloudy, turbid, brown color with creamy, light brown foam that persisted a while and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was dark malty with light cocoa and light molasses and a whiff of sweetness. The taste was richly malty with flavors of light caramel, cocoa, and a slightly vinous fruitiness. There was a very light sweetness and a very low apparent hoppiness. There was a faint hint of alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied with moderate but good carbonation feel. The finish was nicely malty, and this beer was slightly warming overall. This was a great doppelbock -- very drinkable."
"A solid doppelbock, for certain."
"Overall, this is an exceptional beer, worthy of its high rating. Highly recommended!"
"D- a very drinkable beverage, a good dopplebock, not the best ive ever had, but definitely good , would buy /drink/ recomend any day"
"I really enjoyed this beer and will get it again."
"Drinkabilty I gave a 3, only because of the sweetness, and the abv, make this a dangerous beer to have more than one or two in a sitting."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth. Alcohol becomes noticeable but isnt overwhelming. Warming and quite good. This bottle was only $2.99. A great deal in my opinion."
"Overall an excellent offering, very hard to believe it is as strong as 7.4%. Quite quaffable and was perfectly suited as a nightcap."
"Overall: An excellent doppelbock, very flavorful and well crafted."
"The mouth is great, thickened as it warmed, smooth, slightly carbonated up front, smoothing through to end, a very nice ride. Taste is not shy, loaded with caramel, some brown sugar and chocolate, toffee. Perhaps there are some fruits hiding there in the background. Yum yum yum. I should go get a few more, this is definitely one of the best dopplebocks out there."
"Opinion: This is a great beer! I have tried it multiple times, and even as my first beer before, but this is the maltiest impression that I have gotten. The bottle was a bit underfilled when I opened it, and I wonder if that is because of a slight oxidation enhancing the malt by reacting with the melanoidins. It just seems more dominated by malt this time when before it was, of course, really malty but drank really easily. This beer is a bit earthy, but still really good. In saying all of this, I am not saying that this beer is noticeably flawed, but it just tastes a bit different than I remember it in the past. This is an excellent beer and one that I would drink VERY regularly if it were available here in Texas...sucks for us Texans afflicted by the TABC."
"Overall, quite lovely!"
"Mouthfeel is smoth and appealing, if a little heavy on carbonation. Better as the beer warms. Drinkability is good for a doppelbock, if in the mood I could have a few of these at a sitting. Celebrator is still my measuring stick for doppelbocks, but this is a really good beer."
"I poured this into a pint glass and the tight tan head rose up to the top of the glass and then quickly settled down. The body was dark brown with a slight chill haze, very little light gets through, but what does is reflected as ruby. The smell is slightly muted; after some serious sniffs I get caramel and some toasty malt,. The taste starts with toasted malt then some dark fruits; there are many subtle things in this beer. The more I drink this more things I taste: there is a nutty bitterness, a bit of chocolate, it just keeps going. The mouthfeel is medium-full, with tight carbonation, smooth and chewy. I was real impressed with the mouthfeel, I think it is perfect. The drinkability is real high because I just wanted to keep drinking it to find more flavors."
"Excellent drinkability. This brew is very tasty and highly sipable. Many of these will be in order next spring."
"Having a glass without residue or some added carbonation, I know this would be fine drinking all night long--complex yet elegant and extremely well balanced."
"Totally enjoyable beer. This is one beer I could drink over and over again. Modest head, mouthfeel like a milkshake on a hot day, but not that thick. Very easy to drink, smooth finish. May seem prejudicial after a hard days work, but can't imagine a finer welcome home. Glad I bought a whole case."
"This is a good dopplebock and quite easy to drink. Really a good example of the style."
"Overall, hands down one of the best beers, in any category, that I've had."
"All over a very smooth, but warming drink. I would consider this the ideal after-dinner drink, with dessert, or petits fours, or on its own."
"I could drink this a lot. Too bad it is hard to come by around where I abide."
"D: Quite easy to drink, though near the end of the pint I was satisfied - one was enough. A nice doppelbock, will have this one again."
"Pours a reddish/brown color with a thin tan head of small bubbles that dissipates quickly. A bit hazy, typical for Weihenstephaner yeast. Sweet malt aroma, no hint of smoke or burnt grain. Hints of fermenting fruit. Apricots come to mind. Taste is more fruit, apricot and a hint of dates. Yeast character takes over in the aftertaste. Medium to full body with a slightly creamy texture. Good if you like their yeast. Not for those who want a clean bock."
"Medium-bodied with an alcohol warmth and smooth finish with low carbonation. Overall pleasant but slightly lacking in malt complexity but still a very nice beer with good balance of alcohol, malt and bitterness."
"Cheers!"
"Served in a mug, the beer pours brown/red with a good sized off-white head. It smells like roasted malt, toffee, chocolate and coffee. It tastes like chocolate, nuts, toffee, raisins and smoked malt. A very tasty beer! The body of the beer is medium/full, and it's creamy and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. It's also a pretty drinkable brew. You can't tell the 7.4% ABV when you're drinking the beer, but it hits you after a while. Overall, this is a pretty good beer!"
"Complex flavor without being overly heavy. Could definitely drink a few of these."
"Very drinkable- it almost goes down like a cold glass of chocolate milk- atr least what one would taste like in a more beery dimension. Its very easy to drink with very little noticeable alcohol and intersting characteristics. Delicious!"
"D: Another great beer from the world's oldest brewery. Would probably pick up a Celebrator over it though."
"All in all, a pleasant mistake."
"This brew pours a clear brown color with reddish hues. The head is one finger in height, and recedes rather quickly into a thin sheet that covers the top of the liquid. The aroma is of chocolate, cream, caramel, and butter. The taste is like the aroma, but a little mellower. The mouthfeel is exactly what I like in a doppelbock: medium-full bodied with an average level of carbonation, and above all else it isn't sticky. Overall, this is one of the better doppelbocks I have had. I would certainbly buy it again."
"Drinkability: Definitely tends toward the heavier, more bitter end of doppelbocks, but remains an exceptional contribution to the style. Pushes in all the right directions and remains exceptionally drinkable. Fantastic."
"Very nice, deep chestnut color but amazingly transparent-you can see right thru this puppy. Nice tight tan head on top. Moderate, chewy and caramel aroma. Big malty flavor balanced with a nice, soft bitterness. Minute trace of alcohol bite to it. Terrific flavor as far as doppelbocks go. Nice full mouthfeel-not overly slick feeling. Damn fine version of German brewing. I need to find this on a regular basis."
"D - Awesome. Believe the hype if you are a dopplebock fan. Very nice."
"THis is not a beer you can be passive with and ignore; its a beer that demands your attention."
"Smooth and rich, with layer upon layer of flavors. Begins with a nice sweetness, that blossoms into a touch of sherry followed by a slightly smoky quality that was lurking in the background throughout.	Touches of chocolate, also tingle the tastebuds at points. A well crafted and highly enjoyable beer. Another winner from Weihenstephaner."
"Pours a burnt sienna with a cloudy body that has a thick tan head. The nose is sweet with a sour, funky, nutty, aroma....tough to make out other flavors. The taste is fantasic, caramel malt, herbal tea, tart bitterness. The sweetness brings forth so many flavors...dark fruits, raisins, plum, very creamy, roasted nuts. This is a very tasty doppelbock!"
"Drinkability: All I can say is it's great stuff. I would rather have two of these at dinnertime than a meal."
"Gernay may not have won the World Cup, but they can't be genuine losers with this beer in the country. It's down to earth but nicely complex, and it works along with a happily warming ABV and contrasting crispness to render it refreshingly drinkable. Whether to celebrate or to drown one's sorrows, this one makes sure all's well that end's well, or even not too well, for that matter."
"Wow this is an intense beer, This is one of the few dopples that don't have some kind of ""erminator"" names. But actually it does not need any kind of menacing name since the beer speaks for itself. Amazing beer from and amazing brewery. What would you expect. Get one and find out what a dopplebock should taste like."
"booya!"
"A great savoring beer. Makes for a nice dessert/after dinner drink."
"Thanks to Shbobdb for his unintentional endorsement of this beer."
"I'm learning to review beers so I will have to come back to edit this review."
"Drinkability. Yeah, it's drinkable. This beer begs another sip just to try to identify all of the fantastic flavours that are hidden in the malt profile. A really nice beer."
"D: I've been looking foward to trying this ever since trying Weihenstephaner's weissbiers. Big disapointment. Being a textural person, the mouthfeel was a huge turn-off, and the rest of the beer's traits were less than impressive as well. I won't be buying this one again."
"Something to give thanks for."
"just as i expected, this is nowhere near as malty sweet as some others. probably the most bitter doppelbock i've tasted. it's nicely balanced, and has a lot of flavor. but it doesn't have as much character as, say, ayinger celebrator. it is, however, incredibly smooth and highly drinkable. buy this if you see it. i will definitely get it again."
"D - high, easy to down and nice on the palate"
"Drinkability: What a fantastic beer. Super drinkable considering the 7.4% abv. Big, sweet, malts with almost no hint of hops in this delicious dopplebock. Alcohol is extremely well hidden in the flavor profile, however, you can feel a warming of the face as this one goes down. A must try beer regardless of style. As a self proclaimed hop head, I find Korbinian a great change of pace and one all must seek and try at least once. I know that I will revisit this one again."
"A very drinkable beer, alcohol is nearly not perceivable and is so tastey that you just keep tipping it back. Not exactly like most dopplebocks I've tried but a truly great beer. Thouroughly enjoyed sipping this beer."
"Poured a dark brown color with a one finger head into a pilsner glass. Smell is a pleasant sweet malt with a bit of fruit and chocolate. Taste is just perfect for the style! A nice sweet malty taste with a touch of chocolate and somewhat strong alcohol presence. The taste is very dry with the perfect amount of carbonation and the drinkability is exceptionally high for the amount of alcohol. Overall a superb beer that is a must try!"
"One of my favorites, a must try. MK"
"The burniness takes the drinkability down a peg, but overall this is a good Dbock."
"Overall- Just a tad above the bland mark. The beer is just too weak. I drank it both cold, straight out the fridge, and warm. The flavor has plenty of potential but I had to drink the entire 16.9 oz to really get a grasp on its taste. Nothing special here."
" High drinkability because of the ease at which the abv goes down. The mouthfeel could use some adjusting but I could see downing endless litres of this in a Bavarian bierhall.."
"Overall, this is an eminently drinkable beer!! It is impressively complex and well-balanced; full-bodied but sweet. Easy to sip and enjoy one or have several. Score one for the Germans."
"Pours a murky dark brown with some red hues. Massive 3 finger head that recedes to 1/4"". Smells of sweets malts and some dark fruits...raisins. Taste is heavy on the malts. Very sweet and caramel with a mild honey and fruit finish. Cherries maybe. Feels creamy in the mouth, but a bit too much so. Drinkable for the right occasion, but not for any and every occasion. Dessert beer."
"This beer poured with a thick head that dissapeared quickly. The color os a mahogany hue. The smell is caramel and brown sugar. The taste is like honey and malts. There is a alcohol presence in the mouthfeel. The drinkability is good for the style. I may buy a bomber of this again sometime."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The beer has no trace of alcohol in taste or smell. The beer is well balanced. The beer is highly quaffable. This is a gift from all the beer gods. I think I may have just had a religious experience."
"Drinkability: The abv hurts the drinkability a bit. Despite that, the bock is smooth and clean."
"Nice, strong, sweet, and malty. I'll get it again."
"The body is thick and heavy (but not sticky in anyway) with more raisins, figs, caramel and toffee coming through. I am actually very amazed at how balanced this beer is. A little on the sweet side for me but still very good. I am truley amazed at how the Germans make these simple beers so complex. Very well done."
"Dark, Dark, Dark!!! Color is wonderfully caramel brown with a brilliant ruby hue when held to sunlight. Crown is almond and fluffy. Aroma is butt kicking and brilliant. Toffee, chocolate, caramel, banana, plums, oh my. Taste is dominating, spicy, biting, strong, and full. This is like a weizenbock on steroids. Just an awesome and unique brew."
"This brew is EASILY among the finest doppelbocks in the world. It could be the best, but it's certainly no worse than 3rd."
"Overall, a tasty, complex doppelbock, and one of the better examples of the style. Not the best, Weihenstephaner brew, but still a very good one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Milky, and so eloquently carbonated that it serves the beer just right. It is all about the flavors here, and the presentation in the mouth showcases them without distraction. After every swallow, an uncontrollable ""mmm"" makes its way from my lips. What a treat, and I can't wait to try this again. Highly, highly recommended."
"Bringing up the rear would be Hacker-Pschorr Animator, followed by the few other smaller breweries I've tried."
"Verdict- Sit back, and let this beer take you to a very happy place. A benchmark doppelbock for sure."
"Drinkability: The perfect storm here. Incredible flavor, managable abv, great price. Simply one of my all-time favorites; usually too busy drinking it to review it. Fantastic beer."
"Very dark brown. Toffee & dark malty aroma with some fruits added in. The taste is very rich and complex while remaining a surprisingly drinkable beer. I had no problem downing the whole bottle by myself..in no time at all, really. Has staple dopplebock characteristics, with the thick malt character and hints of fruit, but the drinkability of this separates it from most others. A really good offering from Weihenstephaner, and something to enjoy for the winter season."
" The beer poured a nice dark transparent brown with about a one inch tan head. I found the beer had a faint malt aroma with some fuit undertones. The head stayed through out the whole glass. The mouthfeel was consistant. There is some alcohol present in the taste, but it is quite smooth and very drinkable. There was a nice lace through most of the glass. I will be trying some of the other Dopplebocks soon..."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied and chewy with a mellow carbonation. A meal in a glass for sure, I'd take this over a loaf of bread anyday :-). I find this to be a very drinkable brew and it will be what I turn to when I'm craving a dopplebock. This one is not to be missed. I believe I paid 1.99 for this bottle, which is a freakin steal for how good it is. Check this one out ASAP."
"Chocolate brown color, nice one-inch head with some retention. Caronation subtle, fairly hazy/cloudy. The malt aroma is strong, with a nose of raisin, chocolate, and a wheaty vegetable-like smell. Taste is noticibly dry, lightly sweet raisin and caramel flavor, a bit toasty and slightly alcoholic. Medium carbonation, a bit thin on the palate. Drinkability was nice, this brew has a good strong malty flavor, but the aroma turned me off a bit, and Dopplebocks are not my favorite style. Doesn't quite stack up to the Celebrator in my opinion, but good for the style..."
"Poured a crystal clear mahogony color. Masssive creamy tannish head that was retained throughout the glass. Very attractive lacing. Smell is loaded with malt with strong dark fruits (prunes, figs) present. Taste is magnificient, with strong dark fruit, roasted malt, dark bitter chocolate, caramel, toffee. An absolutely superb blend. Nice creamy mouthfeel is also very enjoyable. Finish is more of the malt, with only a slight suggestion of alcohol showing through. This is an excellent beer. with perfect drinkability. Almost too easy to drink considering the alcohol content."
"I would definitely have this one again."
"This beer is guilty of YUM in the first degree. Seconds, please."
"Mahogany with a big ecru head. Some big bubbles in it. Smoky, mossy, clovey aroma. Flavor is surprisingly complex and morphing. It has an amazing depth with a very dark and depressing overall flavor. Smoky caramel, yeast and clay. Smooth and full, finishes just barely on the sweet side. Very good, drinkable, but not something that I would want often or much of. A nice meal of chocolate-nougat fudge."
"So pleasant and welcoming with a nice soft complexity throughout. Very nice."
"A strong yet very relaxing and enjoyable doppelbock. Great example of the style from a brewery that seems to do that a lot."
"Highly recommended."
"As a double bock fan, this is simply one of the best of its kind. The color is a dark amber that is extremley sharp with a white creamy head. The smell is loaded with malt, chocolate, raisins, and other fruity goodness. The taste begins as slightly bitter but quickly is overtaken by a sweetness explosion that lingers on the palate. Goes down so smooth and would be great with a a chocolate or fruit desert. This is my kind of beer, and would gladly pay another $2.59 for a 16.9 oz bottle. Look out Ayinger Celebrator, you have company."
"very tasty. I would prefer the Salvator over this (stronger coffee tones) but I wouldn't kick this bitch out of bed either. me likey."
"Pours out a dark brown brew that shows ruby light through it. Smells of a bit yeasty,,licorice, but very mild scents.Has 2 finger head that seems to quickly disappear to a light bubble layer.Taste of sweet malt that seems to end dry,,very mild hop taste and quite a bit of alcohol in the breath.As the beer warms it becomes sweeter. Mouthfeel is ok,,a bit thin.Drinkability,,,hmmm,,, not bad possibly dopplebocks arent my style ill search out a few more and see if its true."
"A nice after dinner beer."
"Nice head on top of the red-brown beer, drank it out of my Celebrator glass and it has now claimed it. I think this bets out Celebrator in my book. Nice clean sweet malt smell. Deep flavors of complex chain of long boil sugars with a hint of hops in the finish. Amazing body and texture, between beer and syrup. Very drinkable I am glad I had two to drink because one wasn't enough."
"Poured to a generous head with lots of carbonation. The bottle looked as busy as an anthill with the bubbles racing here and there. It smells sweet, like sweet plums and raisins. The taste is sweet as well, all I can think of are more plums and very sweet prunes. Luscious creamy mouthfeel. Probably my favorite dopplebock!"
"This is a very nice dark brown beer with a huge tan head. It has a strong raisin/prune smell and a bit of a spicy yeast aroma. The taste is very nice. It has a sweet (but not too sweet) caramel flavor, with prunes and chocolate. There is really no bitterness to it at all, just a bit of a spicy aftertaste. It is extremely smooth and easy to drink."
"All in all, from the husband of a wine drinker...if she likes it. It must be good."
"Quite nice, it definitely deserves praise."
"Pretty drinkable for a 7.4% brew... like i said, very smooth, very inoffensive. Just.... i dunno... I was expecting more."
"It pours a clear dark brown with ruby highlights and a tall, dense tan head. Aroma is rich with caramel, raisins, bread and slight roasty undercurrents. The palate is doubly as rich as the nose with the perfect amount of clean bitterness to cut through the maltiness. A truly wondeful beer- not a misstep along the way to the lengthy roasty finish."
" The taste and smell of this are incredible. I don't give out 5s, but this one is as close to a 5 as I've had. This is a must try. Highly recommended."
"D-This beer has a great appearance and a complex rich smell so I was expecting the same from the taste. This was not the case. A little light in taste complexity and the mouthfeel was watery to boot."
"Quite nice, really. Easily worth a revisit."
"Shame I never found this in Germany, still a dang tasty dopplebock!"
"Color is deep red. Low head retention and some light carbonation. Smells malty and astringent with some stewed fruits. Flavor is malty with a sweet start and an astringent finish. Palate is surprisingly light for such a high gravity beer. Man, I guess I am jaded, but this just seems to be variations on the same theme – a good beer but did not knock my socks off."
"Drinkability: Very smooth drinking. A super dopplebock, and I am glad I picked it up."
"sweet caramel malts in the taste as well, but it's got an oddly empty aftertaste. much weaker flavor than i'd expect from a doppelbock. very light carbonation and a medium-light mouthfeel."
"Very dark with beautiful ruby highlights. Fine, tan head with low carbonation apparent from the pour. Nice lacing that continues throughout. Rich, malty aroma, with toffee and plum. Toffee and caramel form a base malty flavour and there's a bit of chocolate layered on top. Cherries and hop flavour towards the end. Light, warming alcohol is barely evident towards the end as well, particularly as it warms a bit. Light hop bitterness with a bit of metallic character lingers for a short while in the finish, followed by the delicate remnants of the malt. Medium bodied with low carbonation and a slightly grainy texture. Very enjoyable and something I'll pick up again."
"Drinkability: An excellent affordable Dopplebock and definitely wouldn't mind having another right now. A top notch German Dopplebock!"
"Dark amber color with orange highlights, the beer is topped with a fluffy, long-lasting tan head. Wonderful rich caramel/candy aroma from the beer. Caramel, toffee, peanut brittle all are wafting across the glass. The taste is a pleasant sweetness. Toffee, caramel, dates hit your tongue immediately. This is followed by a mild bitterness, and just a subtle citrus hint (tangerine). Smooth, rich mouth feel, great drinkability, no sense of alcohol from the beer at all. Its like dark caramel in a glass."
"Big German-style 500 mL bottle - served lightly chilled in a chalice. It pours the color of cherry or mahogany wood and has a small off-white head that reduces to a collar and leaves little lacing. It smells of banana, ripe/dark fruits (prunes, raisins), molasses, grains, and toasted malts - overall very rich with some cloying sweetness. The flavors are toasted/caramel/molasses malts, with a mild bitterness, anise, lots of sweetness that becomes cloying, and maybe some green/spicy hops - all on top of a medium body. The sweetness is a bit too much to make it very drinkable, which happens to me fairly often when I drink dopples."
"Beer pours darker than night, with a nice head. Do you like coffee? If you do, take your time in the rich aroma of this beer. Sweet and malty, alcohol very well hidden. Mouthfeel is pleasant with good carbonation. This is a good beer to relax to, but one is enough in a night for me."
"Sure, I might enjoy another beer every now-and-again but, baby, I didn't mean it. You're better than all those beers, really baby, I mean it. Gimme another chance, don't go away. I know the weather will get warmer soon and you'll leave me for a time. Don't leave me baby, please, I didn't mean it. Don't leave me, don't leave me. . ."
"Lots of good flavors go on in here, but ultimately it's far too sweet for me to want another serving. Still, I can see having this with dessert now and then."
"Pours a dark garnet with amber highlights below a finger of khaki bubbles. Nose is thick with grainy maltiness, some earthy peat, and a hint of dark fruit. Taste is rested upon a hearty sweet caramel malt backbone, some alcohol soaked woody notes and a bit of baltic prune. Mouthfeel is slick and oily, with moderate carbonation. This is a solid, flavorful authentic-tasting German dopplebock. Didn't blow me away, but certainly solid and well-constructed."
"One of the better Dopplebocks out there. A delicious beer...if you love malt, because this beer is full of it. Complex nutty (pecans, walnuts), fruity (over-ripe peaches, dates, figs), maple syrup, and brown sugar flavors swirl over the palate with a heavy coating. Light hop bittering offers a light balance, but not flavor or aroma. The beer remains toasty and lightly roasted from sip to swallow. Very mellow and smooth as it goes down with a bold roasty, syrup aftertaste. A joy to drink."
"On seeing this beer in a glass, I first thought that came to my mind was a beautiful brunet with red highlights. Pours a tall tan head that fades. This beer just looks good. Smells like rye whiskey with some lemons and a bit of chalk. On the center of the tongue it tastes like caramel and peaches ant fades to citrus on the edge of the tongue. The flavors compliment each other well. The bodys light and creamy with a fine carbonation. I think this would go well with roast beef."
"22 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a dark reddish brown color, with a creamy head. The aroma is huge, with dough, brown sugar, apple cider, and caramel. Doughy malt flavor, that somehow manages to be incredibly strong without being cloyingly sweet. I think it is this fact that seperates the Korbinian from other hugely malty dopplebocks. There is some dark fruit flavor too. The finish is spicy. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. Much more drinkable than you would think. I first had this beer when I was new to craft beer, and I wasn't impressed that first time. Revisiting this beer, I really enjoyed it. Weihenstephaner is now probably my favorite German brewery."
"A good German Doppelbock. Poured out to a dark cherry / brown color with a 1/8 inch head and some minor lacing in the glass. Aromas of smokey aged cheeses, bread, dark fruits and some earth. Taste was along the same lines as the smell, with more complexity. Flavors of bready malts, mild smoke wood, a touch of cheese, and some grain. You have to really look for all the flavors, but they are there. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and mildly rich. A good level of drinkability. For less than 3 dollars a bottle, this is an exceptional beer. Highly Recommended."
"I will be looking for a case of this soon. If it weren't for the ABV, you could drink a dozen. Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!"
"This is one of those beers that makes you have a new favorite style. This dopplebock is fantastic on all angles. It pours out a deep plum brown with a phenomenal red glow that just looks magical. The head is fluffy white and sticky enough to leave residue. The aroma is bold and has a semi-strong alcohol sweetness to it. There is definately a presence of aroma hops that pull through. The taste is wonderfully sweet, but prefectly balanced out with some hop bitterness. The mollases body is full, but heavy. The caramel and raison flavors coat the entire mouth and the alcohol sharpness leaves a little warmth and burning. This is very drinkable and goes down remarkably smooth. The 7.4% abv is very well hidden in the taste, but it is present enough to warm your body on a cold night. Absolutely awesome beer!!!!"
"Pours a dark brown body, with tan coloured head and minimal lacing. Not much retention either. Aroma of caramel, sweet malt, alcohol and dark fruit. Taste is very sweet, prune-like, molasses, caramel and a touch of chocolate. Mouthfeel is creamy and chewy and thick. Lots of malty sweetness. Strong, bold and flavourful."
"overall: this could be your favorite doppel or not really. it's not really my favorite doppelbock. the grainy and pruney plum flavors are a little much for me. quite good otherwise."
"Listed as a doppelbock, and based on that, I have to knock it down a bit. As a traditional bock, I'd probably put it about a 4.5."
"Weihenstephaner is a top 5 brewery for me. This beer adds to their legacy."
"im being a bit picky, but this beer would be even better with more bitterness (not too much, but more).however, i dont have any issues coming back to this beer when i see it about. goes well in the snifter to finish off the evening. along with that, the price is as good as youll find for a beer of this volume and quality. definately worth the price of admission."
"Slàinte!"
"Smells great while drinking the only downside for me is the initial unbalance of acidic taste and probably not enough bitterness to match."
"I was not sure what to expect based on the labelling, but turns out this is a pretty good Doppelbock. Dark chestnut color with a medium thick tan head. Thin, stringy lacing. The aroma is very malty and bready. Medium-bodied and smooth with a nice smoky malt flavor. Sweet caramel and light hops balance well together. The finish is mildly bitter and roasty. All in all an above average Doppelbock."
"Smooth, rich, medium bodied and slightly chewy, this is a damned good beer!"
"Murky brown with a decent ½ inch head; sweet caramel malts, chocolate and some alcohol notes on the nose. Thick, chewy malts, with hints of caramel, toffee and dark roasted coffee beans. Dare I say a bit of dark rum or kahlua like flavors  why not? Kisses of hops and pepper, what a whopper of a double! Enjoy!"
"Beer is good. Happy doppelbock beering."
"I knew about this beer's reputation, but I didn't expect what I found today. Simply put, it's an amazingly delicious doppelbock that has to be considered among the world's best. Brauerei Weihenstephan brews some pretty remarkable stuff, but Korbinian is their supreme creation and is an absolute must try for anyone who fancies himself a lover and appreciator of world class beer."
"This is a great doppel. I wish it was available in Spokane. Guess I'll have to head back to get some more."
"Must go get me some more. I really reccommend this beer. Try some if you get the chance."
"The taste starts malty sweet with potent caramel, some toffee and a rising sweet chocolate. Caramel stands predominant throughout and aptly serves as a base that ties together the co-starring flavors to flesh out the story. Other early flavors I get are iron and pumpkin. Alcohol doesn't make an appearance until during the swallow and makes it's strongest presence known in the aftertaste. Another part of the aftertaste is a dry grassy hop flatness. It stands in contrast to the overall sweet malty theme and isn't particularly alluring. A resurgence of chocolate offers reinforcement to the malt sweet to make for an interesting battle. Body is medium, but there is a smooth creamy thickness. Good thing for these 'thick' qualities as they hold the malt sweet on the tongue during the aftertaste to tip the scale. Carbonation is moderate, perhaps working with the grassy and alcohol in the form of an acid sting during the aftertaste. This is a very filling beer, and it also kicked my ass (where's my pillow, it's time for bed)."
"Knockout dark translucent beauty with a firm faintly brown head. Wonderfully carbonated and the nose is heavily malted dark fruits and spices. Taste started with an anise flavor that changed to a pleasant malt and fruit flavor as the beer warmed. Mouthfeel is full, chewy, and the finish is long lasting. The beer might be a little fruity for heavy consumption, but one large bottle is a real treat."
"Awesome. I can't believe this is the first time I had this one. I had this one as a nice after dinner tipple at the Mesquito Grill in Doyelstown, PA. This was about $5 for the bottle, not bad at all, I thought to myself. Anyways, this one is a nearly opaque dark brown/black colour with ruby edges. Head is tannish brown and lasts well and leaves nice lacing. Aromas are all dark fruits and figs with super bready bavarian pretzel malts. To style, this one is pretty damn low on the German hops....but that's how it's supposed to be. Taste is malty sweet with complex dark fruit flavors like plum and fig, roasted nuts also come into the picture as well as dark sweet syrupy liquid sugar sources of various variaties. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but a bit thing for a doppel. Drinkability is nice as well. Good stuff."
"D - The easiest drinking dopplebock I have had, but is this really a dopplebock?"
"Very drinkable. I will stock up next chance I get!"
"Rich brown color with a bit of a light colored head. Delicious, malty nose, like walking into a bakery. The taste is an overwhelming malt flavor, perhaps a little bit chocolatey. Extremely easy drinking, this went down very well paired with a steak right of the grill. Probably the best beer from Weihenstephaner I've tried so far, even more than their legendary hefeweizen."
"Wow, what a delicious doppelbock. This one rivals all the best ones that I've had including the Ayinger Celebrator. Very dark brown pour with a small head that had trouble keeping its retention. Fantastic aroma and taste. Loads of caramel, roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Delicious. Slightly bitter aftertaste from the hops. Medium bodied for a doppelbock but it goes down so smoothly. I wanted another one, but had to hold myself back so I could drive home. Stupid cars..."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" of light tan head over the clear burgundy amber brew. Head hangs around like nobody's business, and lacing is delicate yet lasting. Aroma is chocolate grain husks. Taste is creamy dark malts, with a light fruity tint to it, and a grain husk aftertaste that keeps me coming back for more. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. Alcohol is hidden dangerously, leaving a brew that goes down easy and quick. Yum."
"Solid, malty sweet caramel malt aroma. Big, foamy light brown colored head leaves scattered bands of lace. Deep brown colored beer way a layer of bubbles stuck to the bottom of the glass. Rich malt flavor, a bit of chocolate and some toasted/biscuity flavors. Light sweetness up front is overtaken by a warming alcohol flavor midway through. Slightly slick mouthfeel on this soft, full bodied beer."
"Drinkability: Very tasty. Very Drinkable. Looking forward to real Dopplebock weather."
"A delicious brew that I could drink all night despite the 7.4abv."
"dark chestnut brown with red light-inspired glowing tinge. heady, minimal lacing. hazelnut, mocha, licorice, and dark-as-night malty nose. taste brings out the best of the aroma without expected bitterness. some mild hop notes. plum and clove drop by for the finish. mouthfeel is light with a crisp, lagery aftertaste. good and drinkable in its fluffiness. however, this watery body is unexpected and consciously disappointing for the style. ill have no problem finishing it though. bitterness evolves as i continue to drink. a hit-or-miss brewery offering something that falls in the middle of their lineup."
"Good beer."
"Pours an amazing dark ruby red, sometimes brown sometimes red, really interesting. Topped off by a big fluffy white head, I need to wait for it to subside before finishing the pour. Smells like sweet malts, a bit of bready yeast, a hint of fruits. Taste is quite sweet, very strong malt backbone, some bitterness at the end. Slight iron taste, like blood but still quite pleasant. Dark cherries in the middle and little bit of alcohol comes through in the middle. Rather low carbonation in the mouthful, creamy and smooth. Somewhat disappointed with this one, I think it would be a lot better, its no where near the quality of Celebrator Doppelbock."
"A fantastic beer! Unique and very tasty."
"A very dark brown beer with some good mahogony highlights. Has a big foamy beige head. There is a nice sweet malty aroma with hints of fig and coffee. A solid sweet malt lays down on the front of your tongue with some dried fruit and chocolate notes. A good roasted malt bitterness, balances the sweet start, on the finish. a tasty treat that gets better as it warms to room temp."
"Pours a beautiful dark red with a very aggressive head that is thick and creamy. Aroma is a little disappointing - a bit of sweetness, caramelized malt and denim, but not much of those. Flavors of lightly burnt toffee, malt, coffee, mostly pleasantly bitter flavors, slightly metallic finish, but not enough to be off-putting. Mouthfeel is creamy at first, quickly becoming thin and acidic. Not especially drinkable, but worthy of a try. Does not measure up to Weihenstephaner's other offerings."
"Big malt in the mouth. Caramel and peppery spice. Lots of alcohol in the flavor and some hops in the finish. Mouth is lightly sticky and the malty alcohol taste lingers. Not too drinkable and not too smooth. Not a great beer quite frankly."
"Drinkability- This one was a very good doppelbock, but I still enjoyed the Weltenberger and the Celebrator a bit more. It's still a very good doppelbock and worth whatever I paid for it. Would recommend highly."
"Pour beautiful cloudy, dark reddish brown, with a creamy head, two fingers tall light tan, microbubbles with a mooncrater top. Leaves a large and intricate cobweb lacing on the glass. Instant aroma of dark fruits - raisins and figs. A sweet prune and molasses taste, toasty malts, yeasty, with a more hoppy finish. One downside is the alcohol that comes out in the end. Nicely chewy, a slow sipper, probably too sweet to have another but terrific as a stand-alone. Heavy and full mouthfeel. This is a really great beer."
"Ive been looking forward to this one since Ive gotten on a Doppelbock kick. Appears a dark brown with a light tan head. Minimal lacing was left on the glass. Roasty malts and a big caramel sweetness start the aroma off. A bit of dark chocolate is lingering underneath. Sweet chocolate and caramel flavors up front. Some roastiness in the mix as well. Finishes with a lingering sweetness. Mouthfeel was solid with a creamy texture. Easy drinking stuff but not as complex as I was hoping for. Seemed a bit too sweet to though."
"Drinkability: This was very good, I really like Weihenstephaner products, it was fairly high in abv, but quite drinkable, I could definitely have another, but not really a session beer, just good sippin, I would have this again, although Their Dunkel Weiss is my favorite, cheers!"
"Flavors are simple, straightforward dopplebock; rich creamy malt backbone, caramel, chocolate, slightly sweet. Coffee, rich cigar tobacco and real chocolate flavors. There are just enough hops to keep it from being cloying, after the beer goes down, the hops are more pronounced, offering a nice dry finish. This is a nice beer and I am looking forward to having more. Thanks to Terry at Mountview who cam through with a casewof this after I requested it based upon Stonecrusher's reviews"
"Poured a nice dark caramel brown color with amber highlights. Fairly aggressive pour led to a nice whipped two finger tan head which slowly bubbled its way down. Aroma is slightly sweet with hints of caramel and clove spiciness over a sweet bread body. Im new to dopplebocks so Im not used to their aroma profile yet so it is hard to pick out the subtleties. But this one sure does smell nice. Initially cold Im not impressed with much flavor. Im going to let this one sit for a bit to warm*15 minutes pass*after warming a bit the subtle flavors start to present themselves. There is a pretty huge malt presence just as I expected. But it is balanced well with just a touch of hops at the end. The malts dont present themselves as overly sweet in this beer as I was expecting. Mouthfeel is nice and full and creamy to some extent. This is a very nice beer that I could easily sit down with and have a couple."
"Drinkability is very good, a nice spicey dopplebock glad my local store got some in this year, which means they will have it next year I hope."
"Pouring a chestnut color with 1 finger thick of white fizzy head that dissipates to a slight surface layer with minimal cling. This one is not much to look at really. However, aromas are of brown toffee and hops with some decent maltiness; a slight hops aroma as well. Deep down, this has a chocolate tone as well on the nose. Taste is of sweet toffee up front with a slight clove flavor (spice) and some grainy malts; slight hops on the finish as well with some yeast flavors. Carbonation is moderate that accompanies a medium-full body. A little chewy with a great smooth finish along with a tinge of alcohol. Easy to enjoy this one- interesting, tasty, and smooth!"
"Purchased in a 500 ml brown bottle without a freshness date, Korbinian poured out darker than anticipated chestnut red, and had a bouquet of roasted nuts, dried cherries, and grassy noble hops. The taste was mellow and roasty with the malts dominant, just as they should have been. Dark skinned sweet fruits rolled around on the tongue, and were backed by a smoky, woody, and herbal hop bitterness. Alcohol was warm, but was hidden well enough to not be detracting from drinkability. Aftertaste was full and long drawn out. A satisfyingly meaty German import suited well to usher in the first day of spring."
"The scent is the first thing you will notice about this guy. Sweet, sweet malts, caramel, toffee, even bits of chocolate. This all comes out of a black bodied, brown hued, brew, fair-sized cream head, good retention. Full dose of thick chewy malts, caramel to chocolate, some bitterness, taste lastes long after the brew is down. Alcohol stops in to say hello as the beer warms a bit, but isnt obnoxious about it. Sweet, slick mouthfeel, fairly dry finish. Well worth my $2.49."
"This really is a tremendous brew, consistent year after year after year. The malts and light molasses flavors are raw but the mouthfeel incredibly smooth. Well done as usually by this magnificent brewery."
"I am amazed at the complexity of this beer. With all the flavors, not one of them over powers the others and they all seem to get along in almost perfect harmony. The only downside I see in this beer is that it is a little bit heavy and I really couldn't see myself drinking more than one of these in a night, but what a night it would be."
"The taste is what makes this beer stand out from the crowd. It was like a liquid Heath bar. Toffee and chocolate are close to overwhelming but it's not cloying or too sweet - near perfect! The alcohol is so well hidden that it makes this beer very dangerous. Drink more than one and you'll feel it!"
"Pours a deep mahogany with a well-retained head. Wow, the nose is really complex. Sweet malt with lots of raisin and grape scents, but also a distinct prune smell throughout. Flavor is extremely malty with the same prune flavors coupled with caramel, chocolate, and just a little smoky note. Toasty bread flavors are also in there. Each sip is so soft and chewy with complexity, though, that you could search through there and find most anything you were looking for, I think. Alcohol comes through in the finish, but only lightly. Overall, very nice!"
"Drinkability/comments: Despite the relatively high alcohol content, this goes down so easily and tastes so delicious that I can have several in a sitting. Fantastic. This beer solidifies Weihenstephan's standing as one of the world's truly great breweries. The hefeweizen brought this notion to mind, and Korbinian proves it."
"This brew is a dark but clear brown, with a light brown head. The head is bulbous, rocky, and solid through most of the glass. The aroma has a serious and intense chocolate character. This beer simply smells sweeta mix of big malt flavors (not unlike dry dark malt extract), with unsweetened chocolate, plums, cherries, and sugar. Creeping into the back of the aroma is an alcohol smell. The first taste is sweet and softits smooth, full of body, and very creamy. Its not so sweet that it becomes undrinkable, but its still not the kind of thing that I could drink all night. Nice warming by the middle of the glass. Finish has a little hops, but also a powerful, lingering maltiness. This is solid, enjoyable, and worth pensively long, slow sips."
"Sampled as part of a blind dopplebock tasting. This one poured a deep brown with an attractive frothy dark tan head. Pleasant aroma of brown sugar, deeply toasted caramel, burgundy cherry, & hazelnut. Semi-roasted & well-rounded flavors of chocolate, sweet cherry, plum, and toasted malt. Fairly sweet throughout with hints of both grapes and noble hops beneath the blanket of deep, chewy malt. Medium to full bodied & syrupy in the mouth - overall - exceptionally sweet, rich, & enjoyable."
"Porter like colour and even taste and aroma. Some malts, chocolate, and cherries and berries, raisins and currents. Hops. Smoothness from malts yet sour finish. Bit high on the alcohol, though disguised. Thanks whoever brought this to Doug Shoemaker's party."
"Drinkability: A stunningly well made doppelbock; not as sweet as some of the others; nicely rounded"
"This beer is a malt monster. Malt soup. Multiple decoctions up the wazoo. Flavor is alcoholic with intense biscuit sweetness, and a slight hoppyness in the finish. The flavor notes are simple but intense and malty sweet. Would be a great companion to a dessert that featured cocoanut or carmelized ingredients."
"This is a nice doppelbock. While it is a rich brew, it still retains a level of drinkability. This is a beer that I would definitely like to go back to if I get the opportunity."
"You know, I wanted more after drinking this, but stopped myself. This beer was excellent. Had on tap at 'bones, served in a 10.5 oz glass. Pour was dark ruby in color, with very low head. This thin tan head did last through-out my glass however. Aroma was barleywine like, consisting of dark fruits, mostly plums in this case. Medium bodied, I am having trouble describing the taste (sorry!)...it was so smooth, and blended, and nothing sticking out and trying to be the center of attention. Mostly rich malt, with very slight alcohol in the background. Some caramel notes, some of raisins. I thought there was subtle hazenut notes in the finish. A very fine beer that I recommend highly."
"Well this is rather embarrassing. I went to review this beer, and found out that I already reviewed it! Just upping the taste and mouthfeel to 4.5..."
"Cheers"
"The flavor is so far the best I have had for a doppelbock as it begins with a rich blend of Munich malt and Noble hop bitterness which segues into a malty almost sweet flavor tha finishes with a lingering roasty malt character blended in with banana and clove esters that goes away fast enough to make you want another drink. No flaws in this one make it a very good Doppelbock to use as an educational tool as well as one to try and emulate in Homebrewing experiments. The mouthfeel is perfect as there is only enough carbonic bite to accentuate the hop bitterness without leaving the beer fizzy as well as the body being viscous enough to flow over the tongue slowly. Very drinkable even the high alcohol level would not deter me from having a couple of these at a time. An excellent doppelbock that I would recommend to anyone who wishes to try a winter warmer from a country besides England and USA."
"Mmmm... liquid banana bread is the only way one can describe this luscious beer, although it actually doesn't possess the cloying and sticky sweetness of the aforementioned quickbread. This is a beautiful murky brown color, with a smell reminiscent of banana, clove, cocoa powder, and a little roasted, burnt grain. The taste is much of the same, rum, bittersweet cocoa, toffee, banana, with an ever so bitter finish, just the tiniest bit of hops profile peeking out to say hello, then jumping back in this vat of banana pudding. The mouthfeel is so creamy and thick, and the alcohol is so well-hidden, I could probably drink several of these easily in one sitting, out of liter steins, but I'd pay the price. Not quite a dessert beer though, but a sweet session beer for sure. Dopplebockalicious."
"Rich, bready, toffee malt flavors up front. Kind of tastes like Jagermeister! Weird/interesting. Sweetness fades at the back of the palate into a mildly bitter, herbal finish. Lingering sticky sweetness and licorice. Big bodied, chewy, but not too syrupy. Not bad, but Ive had better doppelbocks, but this is right up there."
"Nice dark color, big cratering white head. Smells malty, of course, but there are fruity notes, too... plum, raisins, etc. with a faint citric hoppyness. Taste is sweet, heavily malty but not dry or bitter, with maybe a hint of hops at the end. Good mouthfeel, but less of a body than I expected. Great drinkability."
"Notes: No trace of the 7.4% ABV detected. This beer is absolutely amazing. Sweetness is balanced and not overpowering. Wonderfully smooth and very drinkable. Just amazing. Watch out Celebrator Doppelbock, you've got some fierce competition."
"I like the contrast of this versus Salvator. The lighter overall character, yet still appropriate for style. A little easier to drink than Salvator. Less bold, more subtle. Enjoyable."
"This beer is highly -- perhaps dangerously -- drinkable given it's alcohol content. It slides down your throat with no problems at all. If they sold Korbinian where I live (Texas), it would definitely become one of my standby winter beers. (Of course, winter here only lasts a day or two most years, but still . . .)"
"A little sweet for my taste, but about halfway through the glass I cut up some regianno cheese and that toned it down quite a bit."
"Pours a deep coppery brown with a generous tan colored head that retains well. Chewy malty nose, very sweet smelling with suggestions of treacle and dark plum or prune. Very smooth beer, with its roasted malt character, light spiciness and a carbonation level that keeps this strong beer drinkable. Faint astringency in the finish that is slightly hoppy and earthy, but never lets you forget the sweetness."
"There was one of these left over from my beer tasting last week. The beer pours a nice dark brown, showing only some reddish tinges when held up to the light. The tan head is about two fingers high that falls to a quarter inch. The nose is full of carmel and malty goodness. Oh this is good. There are sweet caramel malts and a hint of the alcohol coming through. This is thick in my mouth with a moderate carbonation of small bubbles...a good combination. This beer is highly drinkable. This is a beer to sit down to on a nice fall night. Its not too filling, but sits nicely in my somach after a meal."
"Pours a deep reddish-brown color with two fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is rich and full of burnt malt and caramel. Almost seems to have the qualities of a good stout. The taste is sweet with roasted malt and some fruit, maybe dates. Just a great flavor. The body is fairly strong for a doppelbock. The drinkability is good for such a strong beer. Another nice one from Weihenstephan."
"The Korbinian is one of the best made, richest, and most enjoyable doppelbocks made. Its clear russett body has a reddish cast and displays brilliant orange and ruby highlights when held to the light; and its creamy tan head holds very well despite its alcoholic strength, and even leaves thin sheets of lace at the outset of the glass. The nose, however, is possibly the most exciting part. It smells almost like fresh wort at the brewery. It's richly malty with a suggestion of caramel. The body is full; and its fine carbonation gently caresses the tongue before it fades smoothly away. Even bolder than the nose is the flavor. It's simply loaded with deep, rich caramel, toffee, chocolate and even a light cusp of coffee. There's some dark fruit present but it's not bold, and at times a hint of hop flavor can be detected. Otherwise it's exceptionally clean, not even showing its alcohol. It's exceptionally well balanced for such a rich beer as well, and its sweet malt seems to simply fade away in the finish despite the fact that it's bitterness is limited. Brilliant! It's rich and sweet but never cloying. Very well done indeed!"
"When poured it was a reddish brown in color with very little foam. The smell was of roasted malts and spicies with a hint of hop's. The taste of roasted malts and spicies with a hint of caramel had a pleasant feel on the palate. The only set back was it had a sour feel on the palate along with a little bitterness. But, the sour taste is what kind of turn me off. Not a whole lot of flavor that I was expecting from this beer either!"
"The sweetness is a bit much for me and after one beer I am ready for something a little more bitter and clean."
"Taste: Initial sweetness, with a slight splash of carbonation exploding on the tongue. Slight sourness in the middle, with a slightly dry finish that cleans up the malt sweetness nicely and makes this a rather drinkable beer. The yeast profile makes this unique for a doppel, but it's a fine beer nonetheless."
"Big foamy and sticky off-white head over a clear ruby brown body. The aroma consists of sweet maple, toffee, roasted and smoky malt, dark and red fruits with prominent character(cherries, plums) and an enticing earthiness. Its very fruity and almost smoky, but actually not that spectacular after a few sips, earthy grape bubble gum if such a thing exists. Body could be a little thicker, but carbonation is moderate and appropriate. Basically, the palate doesnt seem to reveal the promised secrets from the sniffing, but this is still a very good beer if not great."
"This is a very refreshing beer, not too thick not too thin, it was just right. I found it quite enjoyable and drinkable."
"This is definitely a meal in a bottle. Pours a nice deep mohagony color with a large tan head. The smell is pure heaven. Very malty aroma with notes of roasted nuts, earthy elements, and a strong yeast spice in it. The flavor is also strong on the malt side. Lots of plums seem to be there. Caramel is the base malt and main flavor. Chocolate malts come and go as they please. I also notice a banana and slight clove taste at times. Hops are there to prevent this influx of malts from being too sweet and cloying. Yeast is prevalent and lends a dry mouthfeel. Alcohol kick comes in the end and trickles all the way down my belly. What an experience!"
"Awesome beer. I really enjoyed it. I thought it was very representative of the style."
"Overall, quite sweet and chewy (again, not a bad thing as this is a doppelbock). Highly recommended."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a thick tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It boasts of roasted malts and a dry yeast scent. It has a nice subtle dark malt aroma that is not sweet, but still pleasant. The taste is good. It has a rich malty core with a bit of black and roasted malts which round out the flavor. It goes down a tad thick and finishes dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine doppelbock, but I've had better. It just isn't as smooth as others, but still satisfies with good flavor."
"A respectable Double Bock, I like the Erdinger version a bit better."
"The beer pours deep mahogany with a tan foamy head. The smell of raisins, chocolate, carmel, toffee, and coffee. Taste is big on roasted malts, with a grainy flavor that has a raisin like flavor when the alcohol hits your palate. Exceptional in every sense of the word, one of the best doppel's I've had."
"One of the better doppelbocks out there from a great brewery in Weihenstephaner. I'm glad this one is more widely available now."
"John"
"Coppery-brown hue with a bloody influence, when I held it up to the light I noticed loads of animation racing towards the light beige head. Speaking of head, it reached an apex of a finger and a half in height; it then faded quickly to half a finger, then to a soapy cap that lingered throughout consumption. The subsequent lacing was very modest but discernible. The nose had its moments of impressiveness, sticky toffee, a hint of dark fruits, alcohol, and a strong dose of good ol maltiness. Behind these smells are notes of toasty-bready-caramel. I did find the bouquet to be a little airy. As a whole the aromas are pleasant, the potency is a tad lacking, nevertheless it is inviting. It took a few sips before the flavors really sparked any interest. Upfront on the palate I detected a malty, plumy, toffee combination, in the middle an average caramel noted emerged, also some chocolate pudding was added to the mix, in the finish the alcohol becomes noticeable, this was a lovely addition! The sweetness is really restrained; it is even a little dry. Without question the palate is tasty but it doesnt really standout like Urbock 23° or Samichlaus Bier, nor is it as yummy as SA Double Bock or Celebrator. This is no way a knock against Korbinian the competition is tough! The tummy warming affects are noticeable. Medium-full in body, the carbonation is low, the mouthfeel is quite soft and maybe even a little unexciting. I am impressed at the easy of consumption considering the abv, in other words it is very drinkable. I do wish this beer were available locally as it would be something Id quaff again. I purchased my bottle in Iowa City. This is a top ten Doppelbock but it doesnt standout enough for me."
"Great Flavor. Banana, almond, caramel, molasses, coffee, cinnamon, sweet malts, toasted malts and other spices. Somewhat herbal. Very good tasting Doppelbock. I enjoyed this one and would like to revisit it soon."
"$2.99 a bottle"
"Reminiscent of Aventinus for me."
"Exceptional Dopplebock from the world's oldest brewery. Pours a nice dark brown with a huge tan head. Aromas are extremely malty with toffee, chocolate and maybe a bit of brown sugar. Taste is sweet, balanced with toffee, caramel, chocolate and a wonderful bready fulfilling mouthfeel. Its basically got the perfect amounts of everything. Consume this beer at around 45 degrees to take advantage. 7.4% ABV is great on this cold crappy winter day outside."
"Drinkability: A solid doppelbock to my tastes, but there are better ones out there. This one still gives them a run for the money, though."
"16 ounce bottle. When purchasing, I had no idea this was a dopplebock. I find it interesting this beer is imported by Bavaria House Corp in Wilmington, NC and is illegal to be sold in NC."
"Pint bottle pours a clear orange tinted mahogany with a short-lived beige head that melts into a slick with ring lacing. Aroma is big, powerful malts. Heavy dose of molasses and caramel smother the olfactory senses. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth, with plenty of carbonation. Initial mouthfeel is tart and fruity, but quickly reverts to its strong malt character. Molasses, caramel, and dark fruits(figs and dates) are dominant here. Hops bitterness becomes evident early on and continues the rest of the way. Aftertaste is somewhat unpleasant by its syrupiness. This is an interesting beer to review and enjoy, but it doesn't fare well when compared to the better Bavarian doppelbocks."
"Dark caramel color topped by a tan, lasting head. Sweet malt aromas immediately greet me upon pouring the beer. Slight hint of noble hops. Dark roasted notes in the flavor, coupled with decent bitterness. Mild sweetness is coupled with a grainy finish. Feels a bit thin on the palate, and the carbonation is much milder than expected. Decent drinkability, but this one still lasted me a while. More of a dark lager or bock than a dopple. Glad I tried it, but over-rated as far as dopples go."
"Pours a reddish cola color, settles a bit darker with a nice clear gem-like glow, thin tannish head breifly makes an effort to stay but fizzes quickly down to a thin hazy skim and ring, lace in minimal spots. Aroma is a bit faint of toasty sweet malts and dark fruits lending some plum, raisin, dates, and dried apricot. Taste is a bit more filling, starts a little weak and thin but begins to gain malty weight with a nice toffeeish sweetness and finishes strongly with a nice mixing of dark fruits of plum, raisin, dates, and figs giving way to a little chewy caramel lingering finish which is super smooth and creamy. Nice finish on this. Theres a bit of a metallic twinge in the midway parts but is barely noticeable and appears mostly at the front of the tongue and the lips. Feel is close to medium with a light silken creamyness that floats through the palate with ease and the finish is quite nice with a light building of chewy sweetness. A soild dopplebock by any standards, good stuff."
"A good solid doublebock. Poured beautifully letting off sweet chocolate and malt flavors. The alcohol is not apparent until mid beer when you start to feel happier about the world and that you are blessed to be able to drink good beer like this for 2.65 for a bottle. Dark brown color with a malt lovers body. As you get to the bottom, the tastes come together very well. There is a bit of sweetness that sticks to your tongue which may need some pretzels to help with. Buy it at bev'mo in albany."
"A hop bite starts the finish but is quickly overcome by a sour finish."
"Very drinkable for such a rich beer. Great stuff!"
"Dark reddish Caramel color. This beer brings memories of the bier garden in portsmouth, VA. Nice even off white head. Smell is of sweet caramel and toffee, nice & malty. Not sickly sweet, just plain 'ol good. This brew starts off the the way it smells - sweet & malty, with a welcome alcohol kick and dough breadiness. Then it sort of dries up, with a roasted malt back end to smooth things over, finishing suprisingly dry for the style. Mouthfeel is full & thick, and this beer goes down easy. This is what Salvator used to be before they destroyed the recipe. A great Dopplebock, and at this point I would go so far as to say a benchmark for the style. Well done."
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown nice sized creamy tan head bottle says it's a dunkles starkbier aka doppelbock nice webbed lacing. Aroma: Mild plum and raisins with frivilous amounts of malt making this one malt monster with a bit of balancing hopping noticeable. Taste: Ripe fruit malty treat mild chocolate notes full rich maltiness is delicious. Mouthfeel: Medium body creamy texture, it's banging. Drinkability: Classic d-bock great brew oh so drinkable just try one and see for yourself."
"This one is a MUST for all to try."
"Full blown malt attack on the nose hints of the meal to come. The color is rather interesting-more like a brown ale showing deep brown with orange highlights. The taste here is quite fine. Again, malt-O-meal deluxe!! Plenty of ripe, plump and sweet juicy raisin chime in as well as some milky chocolate and the typical nuttiness of the style. Half way through the glass I note that the lace is firm and sticky-it ain't movin! This is a fairly delicate version of the style yet be careful as the ABV is 7.4, and if you rush you'll be sorry. A beer this good makes me consider the monks life as a potential part time gig."
"Dark reddish-brown in color with lots of large chunks of yeast floating around. Decent half inch head of fairly large bubbles that dissipated somewhat quickly down to a thin lace. Very, very strong aroma right out of the bottle. Great malty nose with prunes and raisins. The start is quite smooth. The malt on the palate is again sweet as well as a little spicy with a hint of clove being noticeable. Theres some light yeasty/breadines notes as well. Carbonation is moderate and theres a little alcohol bite around mid swallow that quickly subsides. The finish is also smooth with a slight bit of hops. The aftertaste is rather short lived. I really liked this brew. Quite unique and interesting with a rather complex flavor profile. Its a bit strong, so I dont know how drinkable it would be after one or two."
"As far to the extra as some West Coast IPA's go to load up on hops, Brauerei Weihenstephan has done the same for malt with Korbinian. The antithesis of an IPA, this is a malt lover's dream."
"Deep amber color, large foamy head. Aroma is very malty. Big malts, slightly sweet. Caramel and toffee then hop spicy. Nice balance. Big malty beer. Warming. Robust flavors. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is malty, with a lingering malty sweetness. Nice beer."
"Got this as a free sample and was raring to give it a go. Poured a darkish brownish reddish colour, Nice billowy rocky head you could almost float on. Smell was of dryed fruits. Almost fruitcake like. Taste was similar with lots of spiced raisins and dried figs and prunes, with something almost salty like soy sauce in there ( could be crazy or it could be the chinese food i had before i drank this. Mouthfeel is good silky smooth for a beer of this weight. Drinkability is very high, but becareful cause at 7.4 you might fall down before you get filled up."
"Drinkability: This one's a heavy beer which begs to be paired with heavy food. I had it over bratwurst and kraut, and can't imagine drinking it with anything else. Hearty doesn't even begin to describe it. A brewery doesn't last since 1040 for no reason, I guess..."
"Pours to a brown color with ruby highlights. It forms a thick tan head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is malty, with a bit of graininess and a touch of chocolate. The flavor is of sweet malt and bread, it is also a bit astringent. The hop flavor is almost non-existent except for the light spiciness. A good medium bodied brew."
"This one is cloudy brown with lots of floaties and a significant head that dwindles to a thin layer of film. Aroma is sweet with a huge malt profile. Full bodied with a creamy feeling mouthfeel. Flavor is super strong and malty with a definite alcohol presence. There's a ton of malt in this brew and not much else."
"Resplendent for a beer that sits in the bottle without yeast. A beautifully designed label and a very solid beer."
"This brew has a very nice reddish/brown color with a puffy tan head. The aroma is very bready,wheaty,spicy, cookie doughish. It has a very drinkable medium/light body with a chocolate/cream flavor with a long caramel peppery finish. A nice complex dark wheat beer, very versitile for summer/winter and with food, I like it!"
"This brew poured a large creamy head of light brown finely sized bubbles. It has an extremely nice malty aroma that is very pleasant to the nose. The body of this beer is simply beautiful. Its a dark almost opaque brown color with some carbonation rising up the side of the mug. I loved the taste of this brew with elements of caramel, malt, and spice. It was extremely tasty. The head left a ring of lacing around my mug as it receded. This is an extremely good example of why I like Doppelbocks so much. Very smooth, delicious and one of the best brews I have had in a while. Einemal bitte! Once again: Im Himmel gibt es kein bier darrum trinken wir es heir! Translation: In Heaven there is no beer! That is why we drink it here."
"Wow, what a beer! One of the best doppelbocks on Earth, hands down!"
"Originally sampled this on draught at the Anthill Pub, U of California, Irvine, early 2003. This is a very nice doppelbock. Dark brown body w/ a tan head. Nice malty taste, smooth & sweet. This is a great beer to sit down and savor. I really enjoyed it."
"This dark brown brew is an exceptionally flavorful and aromatic beer for a lager -- even a stronger one like a bock. Burnt toast, light notes of dark fruit, and poorly executed vegetable stew drifts up from the fairly thick, brown head towards my nose. These sensations certainly comprise the bulk of the flavor, which is reminiscent of a beer/veggie soup. Very herbal and organic in some ways. Not too hard to drink by any means. Excellent."
"Personally better than any porter or stout. And a top three doppelbock."
"Wow!! This is one heck of a good Dopplebock! It poured a medium tan head with lacing on the sides of my mug. There was some carbonation observed. It had a dark brown body to it. It was extremely smooth tasting with no bitter taste observed and no aftertaste. This was an excellent Dopplebock in my opinion."
"Korbinian is a legitimate contender in the doppelbock category. Similar to Salvator, but I'd give this one the edge. Deep mohagany hue, some head and lace. Wonderful, malty flavor. Caramel notes, buttery smooth texture. Sweet, but not overly so. This beer, along with Tucher Bajuvator, are somewhat overlooked when people compare the best doppelbocks. I still would put the Celebrator at the top, but this one could be #2."
"Many BigHuge thanks to cokes for lining this one up."
"Blows the $hit out of any other doppelbock I have ever tried although it seems a little thin and too easy drinking at times to be a heavyweight doppel..never-the-less I love this beer...Incredible aroma...like sweet brown sugar glazed plums....an awesome clean mahogony appearance with little to no head....Like I mentioned the mouthfeel is a tich thin in my opinion, but what is impressive is that it is not oversweet in the mouth...and that is saying something because this is a sweet tasting beer...Drinkability is through the roof....Can I give it a 69? I guess we can only go up to 5 but 69 would be appropriate because I could taste this beer all night long over and over and over....And that brings us to the taste...dark fruits.....plums and burgandy cherries soaked in a brown sugar/molasses mixture.....what a treat.....THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! Cokes for sending this my way...I will name my next kid ""Cokes"" for having the honor of trying this truly spectacular beer...one of my all-time favorite beers and definitely my favorite Doppel of all-time..."
"This beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a medium head and almost no lacing. The aroma was slightly malty with hints of fruit. The taste was very smooth and sweet with a thick roasted taste to it. The drinkability is just a medium because it is very sweet and very thick. It is quite enjoyable, but I don't think I could drink several in a row."
"It's very dark brown with a nicely sized light brown head. I love the aroma, strongly of roasted maltiness and sweet molasses. This is a wonderful creamy and full-bodied brew. It's just so succulently smooth. A pleasing and soothing alcohol warth finishes off an awesome malty and toasty brew. I just plain love it and prefer it over other German doppelbocks I have tried. Definitely seek this beer out."
"A great dopplebock that is deep red/brwon in color with a malty scent.It is rich, chocolatey and delicious especially if you like Dopplebocks. Drink with dessert or alone as it keeps you begging for more so smooth and rich. There are few better beers of this style in the world if you can find it, you are lucky if you are in Munich it is readily available."
"From behind me, the King returns."
"Weihenstephan is my favorite brewer for a reason.I had never heard of this one actually before my friend from michigan brought this down for me.A beautiful beer a great mahogany color,thick very appetizing head to it.Nice sweet malty smell with caramel and a little burnt taste in the palate the way it should be.Alcohol was very prevelant in taste as well.A man beer from a world class brewer."
"This beer is quite a departure from the other brews offered by Weihenstephan. Their wheat beers and lager are terrific, but I was a bit skeptical about whether they could make the leap to more hearty fare such as doppelbocks. I needn't have worried! Dark brown/ruby in color, with a quickly dissipating head, this beer gives off an enticing aroma. Malty sweet, with a sharp prune fruitiness and spicy alcohol notes. The first sip reveals a full-bodied, creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is nicely sweet but balanced by a mild roastiness. Appealing fruit flavors make their appearances mid-palate, leading to a surprisingly dry hop finish with contributions from the hops and the not-insubstantial alcohol. The alcohol also makes itself known by a certain peppery spiciness toward the finish and a gentle warming sensation. A very fine beer."
"This is a damn fine Dopplebock, and a pleasant surprise. Despite beling labelled as 7.4% ABV, this one seems to pack more punch than that. I'd like to try this in a blind tasting with Bajuvator, Celebrator, and Salvator. Now that would be a tasting! Recommended!"
"Red brown with tan head that dissipates at a reasonable pace. Pours cloudy with plenty of yeast suspended in the viscous brew. Aroma is powerful with chocolate, and toffee. Reminiscent of a big mug of hot cocoa. Sweet malty taste and thick mouthfeel."
"Pours a deep russet under a sticky bone head. A nose of puff pastry drizzled with maple syrup and stuffed with whipped chocolate cream that segues nicely into a beautiful velvety textured flavor that's like chewing chocolate covered roasted almond pillows with a smooth caramel center. A small hop finish keeps the huge malt spine contained, barely. Weihenstephaner never fails to please the senses and when the hell are they going to brew a Weizenbock?"
"Pours the color of Coca-cola with an almond colored head that fades to a fine layer rather quickly. Aroma of chocolate and caramel dominate the nose. Deep roasted maltiness. Smell delicious! Bitter chocolate flavors drown my tastebuds, very malty. Smooth and creamy with medium to light carbonation. A top shelf beer. I wish I would have bought more than one."
"Korbinian: I really like this beer. It is a deep very dark brown closing in on black. Had a thick head that dissipates very quickly. Some molasses sweetness in the nose. I’ve been very turned off lately with big dark beers, finding way to much cloying sweetness. This beer’s huge malt taste stops well short of that line, and in fact runs closer to coffee than sweetness. Very smooth, and a nice beer to savor on a cold night. This beer had a very nice creamy mouthfeel as well. Look for it."
"It's murky brown with a small off-white head that disappears quickly. The smell is similar to what I experience driving home from the homebrew shop with a big bagful of malt and the car windows closed: pure malty joy. The taste of chocolate is immediately apparent, but toffee and spice make their presence known as the beer sits. It's decidedly sweet but not cloying. However, it's certainly not a session beer. This is a good special occasion beer."
"Prosit"
"The beer is luxurious as it set in the glass, Blood Red, or sanguineous if you are a bit squeamish about such things. Head is bountiful with fine sheets of lace that weld themselves to the glass. Nose is caramel, roasted grains, fruit sweet, quite pleasing to the nose. Ambrosial at the start, malt dominated with a middling top and the finish purposeful in its acidity the hops potent. Aftertaste is quite dry and a bit alcohol bitter aftertaste from the 7.4% ABV, a nice Tummy Warmer, robust, and quite a pleasant beer to quaff."
"Foamer! Luckily I didn't spill a drop. Dark brown, not the black I was expecting. Nice small-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is fruit past it's prime. Flavor is light caramelly malts, no real hop presence but some odd funky spice. A bit sweet and syrupy. Mouthfeel is lively with constant steaming bubbles."
"Aromas of toasted brown bread and burned sugar carry through on the palate where they pick up green fruit, white raisins, muesli, flowers and both roasted and raw hazelnuts in abundance. Beautiful! The long, complex, shifting finish inspires images of spring rain on hot asphalt. This was leaner that the other two beers in the tasting, almost a different style, and my favorite. More challenging. Not ""easy."" A bit wild. But supremely engaging for the senses as well as the intellect. Let it grow on you."
" It is bloody great!!!!"
"cloudy, brown and a ton of suspended sediment flecks floating around. minimal head....a bit of lace. a pleasant aroma of dark ripe fruits; hints of chocolate, caramel and spice. mega malty taste...not quite doppelbock territory but close. sweet toffee and chocolate flavors....some caramel too...spices and alcohol. oh yeah! we have a beer here! mouthfeel is a bit thin for the doppelbock leagues but it still kicks butt. pretty smooth and the malt load should satisfy any doppel lover. why these weihenstephaner beers aren't reviewed more and exalted...i don't know. i'm impressed by the sturdy character, balance and quality. if i would of known these brews were so good, i would have bought and reviewed them long before. what a pleasant surprise."
"Ruddy deep brown in hue, w/ a slight haze. Dense tan head recedes slowly and leaves lace. Nutty sweet caramel & buttery toffee upfront in aroma followed by notes of toasty Munich malt and mellow chocolate. Hint of fruity sweetness emerges at the end of the aroma along with a trace of cardboard from slight oxidation. A brash of molasses sweetness hits the palate at first, but immediately is ensued by rich caramelized nutes and subtle carob. Sweetness takes on a darkly fruity, raisiny nature mid palate. Moderate in body, w/ full dextrinous mouthfeel lent by the low apparent attenuation. Hop bitterness, although very understated, prevents the prominent malt sweetness from becoming sugary and cloying. Finishes with a hint of caramelized fruit melanoidins and more toasty Munich malt pleasantly lingering. Although a sweet brew overall, Korbinian wasn't at all cloying. The sweetness was initially molasses like, then took on a toffee character and ultimately became reminescent of dark fruit. A fine brew that would most likely be phenomenol if consumed fresh. Superb drinkability for the relatively high strength."
"I was quite a bit more taken with this bier than my drinking companion, BigE.  Amber with a thick head that left excellent lacing.  The aroma was big time MALT, with some spices and evident alcohol.  The malt couldn't hang with the big dogs in the taste department, as the spices and alcohol came through.  It was smooth with a slight sting of alcohol (what I expected from a starkbier).  Very drinkable.  Excellent."
"Notes: A tasty malt towering brew, makes for a great dessert or end of the night brew. Brewed in the old style of Dunkles Starkbier meaning dark strong beer, more or less can be classified as a Double Bock due to its massive maltiness and boasting an alcohol by volume of 7.4%."
"281"
"16 oz bottle. Another one that my little store always has for some reason. I have been saving this review for a while (he he he) Incredible rich chocolate brown color, with a fluffy medium head the color of Heidi Klum's um klums, klums.--uh oh....back to the beer. Super sweet malty chocolate taste that is just fine with me. Very rich full bodied beer, that demands you savor it. Full bodied and nice finish. It only lacks the slightly bitter balance of the celebrator. I wish more people would give it a try, it's well worth the effort."
"Ok this has great flavor with the malty richness, ripe fuit flavor but I could not get past the sweetness. There is a big difference between malty and sweet. I me this beer seemed underatenuated. I think it was too sweet even for a bock. It has a lot going for it and if it was not so damn sweet it would be on the top of my list (specially at the price)  People are going to think that I do nothing but trash on beers but I call 'em as I drink 'em."
"This ranks among the best aroma beers I've had.  Caramel, maple, toffee and a hint of chocolate.  The first sip was almost as good.  Lots of depth of flavor with caramel and roasted malts.  I hardly noticed the significant alcohol punch at 7.4%, which hides in a spicy finish.  Very nice."
