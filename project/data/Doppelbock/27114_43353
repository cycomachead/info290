3.81,4.4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Bomber pictured here poured into a tulip glass. A tawny golden/copper color with two or three fingers of creamy tan head that mellowed out rather quickly to leave some frilly lacing on the sides of the glass. Decidedly sweet malty aroma that evokes brown bread, toffee, honeyed breakfast cereal, dried dark fruits (raisin, prune), and a whiff of herbal hops. Decent blast of alcohol flavor with the first sip, although the rich malt flavors from the nose remain dominant along with an emergent syrupy fruitiness, canned peaches and stewed pears. This bread and fruit spread effect carries through right into the medicinal boozy finish. Alcohol is not concealed. Body on the thick side but perhaps lighter than expected, creamy and smooth with a moderate amount of gentle carbonation. Interesting brew, a blonde doppelbock less immediately dessert-like than other examples; I'd almost describe this as an ""imperial Oktoberfest"" in terms of flavor profile, more toasted malts and orchard fruit than the chocolate cake and dark fruits one gets with the darker doppelbocks, although obviously one can ""imperialize"" a lighter and drier maibock as well, as seemingly done here.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 02, 2014"

3.59,-1.6,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of the style, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but the sweetness was about a step higher then it needed to be and it got to the point of being slightly cloying and that held this beer back a little. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth, it was a little cloying, a little boozy, a little filling, but the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think half a bomber is the right amount for me, a full bomber might start to wear on me towards the end. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style and it was and the appearance, I thought they were both pretty good aspects. What I liked the least about this beer was the high sweetness, I know this style is sweet, but this one went a little overboard. I might buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I think it's priced nicely but It's not the type of beer that I would buy on a regular basis. I would recommend this to fans of the style or people who don't mind strong and sweet beers. All in all I liked this beer, but I thought it was a little rough around the edges, if the sweetness was toned down a little and the alcohol was hidden a little better then this would be a pretty great Doppelbock, but as it stands now it it's nice, but not great. Nice work guys, I'll have to keep my eye out for more beers from this series.","StoutHunter","Nov 20, 2013"

I did have this beer on hand for several months so I am wondering if I did it a disservice by not trying it sooner from when I first purchased this.

Hops and pit fruit hits the nose, sweetness and some citrus comes through. Taste has a nice hit of hops on the tongue followed by pit fruit in the peach area, some honey sweetness rolling around there as well. Mouthfeel was spicy, sweet,warm and prickly with hops and pit fruit fighting back and forth. This was on my want list for a while and I'm so glad I found it, a really great beer in all the right places and I feel Shmaltz took the Double Bock and rocked it as a Imperial American Bock. I would grab a bomber of this again anytime to have on hand, very tasty and at 10% ABV it has a nice balance and is very drinkable.","Bear1964","Apr 21, 2013"

3.48,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, raisin, prune, molasses, toast, nuttiness, biscuit, toffee, earth, herbal, and slight esters. Nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of caramel, molasses, raisin, prune, toast, nuttiness, biscuit, earth, herbal spiciness, and some yeast esters. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, toast, nuttiness, bread, toffee, herbal, and light esters on the finish for a good bit of time. Good balance and robustness of flavors; a bit too estery at times; some mild cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is decently well hidden with only a moderate warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a solid imperial doppelbock. Some nice flavor robustness and balance; and fairly smooth to sip on. A bit estery at times, but still quite enjoyable; though definitely a slow sipper. This improved a lot as it warmed up to room temperature.","superspak","Nov 11, 2012"

2.4,-34.2,4,1.5,2.5,3,2.5,"The taste is much better than the smell, but far from amazing. It's bitter. It seems that hops is probably where that astringent metallic smell came from. Too much hops. That's really my only problem with this beer. It's a problem I have with a lot of American crafts. They want to pour lots and lots of hops and types of beers that shouldn't have them. This is one of them. Keep your large hop quantities out of my doppelbock. It's supposed to be a sweet beer. I like my sweet beers, that's why I buy them. There's is no need to make this into a bitter beer. The hops are masking what otherwise could be interesting complexity. I think I'm detecting some earthy, malty, sweetness under there somewhere, but it's hard to detect through the hops. So, I'm missing out on half the fun of this beer. Some people mentioned that this beer was boozy and it's got some booziness, but I was honestly hoping for more at 10%. That's getting masked by the bitterness too, and I am disappointed.","ElCommodoro","Aug 02, 2012"

Taste is really hoppy for the style, perhaps to much so, despite big malt bill this is a hop monster, the Hallertaus dominated. Mouthfeel is medium, pretty dry finish due to use of oats, and way, way boozy to drink more than one.

Yesterday, I found myself at the Schmaltz micro-micro brewery on Coney Island, and received a sample of this ""lager"". Now, there's no way it's a lager, but, it is considered a double bock/strong lager. Clocking in at 10% APV, it's a sipper, but, I find it hard to sip. This bomber will disappear in 30 -40 minutes. It's taste to me is somewhere between a double bock/barleywine/strong ale. No matter, it's pure deliciousness comes through. The alcohol is there, but, mostly hidden. It reminds me of the Jewbelation 14, but, at only 10%, it's not going to knock me out as fast! It's sugary, raisiny, malty, and with a touch of bitterness at the end. It won the Silver at the 2010 World Beer Championships, and deservedly so! This is my first bottle, and it won't be my last, especially for the price!","unibrew","Jun 13, 2011"

3.95,8.2,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"A big boy beer, all right, and obviously pushing the limits of the style. Bocks can be 'imperial', sure, but I'm getting hints and effects that transcend doppelbocks and come closer to English barleywines - funny what agreeably drinkable booze bombs will do to a guy. Anyway, I don't think this, despite its full flavours, should be consumed in quantity - in case you start thinking of emulating the titular profession.","biboergosum","Jun 06, 2009"

3.79,3.8,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a mix of copper and rust hues. Very quick foam and only a single file column of bubbles. Sweet fruits like cherries and pears help define this carmelized malt scented brew. The faint hops give off just a touch of wood. Lots of fuzzy feeling caramel malts are at the forefront of taste. The fruits and alcohol don't develop till late middle, all through the finish of this beer. Syrupy and warm malty sweet palate. But there is a little more bubble on the tongue than could be said for an ale. A good sipper that has a progressively warming alcoholic palate as the beer its self warms.","scruffwhor","May 25, 2009"
3.58,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Human Blockhead is good beer if you like big beer, big bocks and bitterness. Unfortunately, that probably doesn't apply to very many craft beer lovers.

3.7,1.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The taste is strong alcohol, but rich and fairly flavourful, with a raisiny-prune spice, rum, caramelised fruit candy and cherry medecine. It's mostly sweet and spicey. Negative points are that it's a little too rough, strong, and hot; the elements are a bit off balance; and it is somewhat one-dimensional, thin in character, and not very well-rounded. However, the flavour it has is lasting and pleasant with some character and it is only slightly too rough, mostly staying smooth enough to be enjoyable to drink without getting tiresome.","Offa","May 06, 2009"
3.58,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A fix for those seeking a sucker punch of earthy sweetness, as much of an oxymoron as that sounds. Tastes a great deal like a very young barleywine more than a doppelbock, although as the latter it's a very hepped up version, turned up to 11 yet not quite fine tuned enough to endure comfortable prolonged lengthy exposure. Ride the roller coaster, but take a good breather between turns.","IronDjinn","May 06, 2009"
3.85,5.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The taste is deep roasted caramel malts, maybe a touch of molasses, brown sugars, maybe some vanilla in there as well. This beer is quite appropriately matched to the style with a big palate. This isn't an overly complex beer either. It is quite sweet, but it does have a prickly mouthfeel and it isn't all that smooth. There is a slightly alcohol soaked raisin or plum presence towards the finish that is significant to the beer. If you want a strong double bock that is drinkable, warming, substantial and full bodied, very sweet and not overly boozy, than this is a pretty good option.","albern","Apr 26, 2009"

3.36,-7.9,4,3,3.5,4,3,"Copper colored body was a bit hazy due to the yeast, and displayed a nice bit of steady and fine carbonation. Unfortunately all those bubbles only amounted to a small head. The smell was sweet and caramelized, and rather mild. The taste was a bit too sweet for me, as my tongue was coated with flavors of dates, honey, and brown sugar. There was a dose of metallic bitterness that followed, and the finish was like the start, sweet but fading. Quite sticky and filling in the mouth. Not much burn considering the strength. Reminded me of some of the other sweet beers from Schmaltz. A bit of chore to down the whole bomber for me.","rajendra82","Apr 20, 2009"

It has a warm, burnt toffee scent that's loaded up with caramel malts. It's rich with a subtle warmth. The taste is decent. It has a very bitter taste that doesn't mix well with the burnt toffee flavor. It's a bit harsh with a warm dryness in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good smelling brew, but the taste is a bit unbalanced.","WesWes","Apr 13, 2009"
3.62,-0.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Very big tan head sits on top of a clear reddish brown body. Carbonation is kinda low, but the lacing was decent. The smell is a 50/50 combination of caramel and alcohol. I don't know if this really qualifies as a doppelbock, but it's pretty good whatever it is. Modestly, but appropriately hopped. Surprisingly drinkable for the amount of alcohol in it. Leaves the tongue feeling a little slick afterwards. Whoever called this a lager-barleywine was right on the money. It's kind of reminding me of a slightly aged Stone Old Guardian.","BierFan","Mar 30, 2009"
3.55,-2.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"22oz bomber served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a copper/gold with a thin tan head. Malty aroma with a little molasses and some noble hops. Full bodied and rich. More malt in the flavor, caramel sweetness. There are some hops in the finish to balance. A bit of alcohol. I think the lager yeast almost makes it too clean. I don't what you would call this: a lager barley wine? I like that Shmaltz tries a lot of different things, but this didn't do much for me.","homebrewhawk","Mar 28, 2009"

3.95,8.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottle from the Davis Co-Op. Pours a deep, deep blood red with perfect clarity and a short white head that falls off after a while. Laces in a watery fashion. Smells of grenadine, malt and alcohol (but in a good way!?). Very strong, aggressive flavor. hot alcohol, fruity prune and cherry malt. Sort of like an 'extreme' dopplebock, with overloaded alcohol that's still supported by the malt backbone. Pretty good. Full bodied, somewhat syrupy. Drinks well, nothing i'd buy again, but interesting enough to be memorable.","aforbes10","Mar 21, 2009"
