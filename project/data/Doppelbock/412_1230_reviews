review_text
"Whoa.  This must be a beer like no other.  I'll let everyone else pick out the details, this beer is underrated, the brothers have it right.  World class.  The nose is...beer!  We spend hours coming up with adjectives and descriptors for all sorts of brews while 28 just flat out nails it. It smells like beer, it tastes like beer- sweet, sharp, grain, and booze.  It packs of punch of alcohol that seems to carry a tiny note of every beer you've ever had.  It's plenty thick on the palate and more complex than most.  German copper totes the load, this ones a stud."
"This beer had great flavor, strong but not bitter and easy to go down.  Would highly recommend"

"I absolutely love this beer. An epitome of the style and the high alcohol is so well masked which is what I love in high gravity brews like this one. Fantastic job on this one."

"Overall a real interesting doppel, too bad I couldn't drink much of it.  One rinse of the bottle and found a giant shard in the bottom."
"O: really easy to drink, which at 11% ABV, is sort of scary;"
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, I thought this was delightful... Maybe some of this is because I had zero expectation or hype. Still, has a really nice rich and hardy bock flavor. Yet at 11% it is rather easy to drink. If you see this it's worth a pick up~"

"If you see an EKU 28 grab 1 or 2. It will put you DOWN! It's a really tranquilizing beer, but clean, so no headaches or other unwanted side effects.  It can be a little pricey but worth every penny.  It has so many rich flavors.  Dark, earthy fruit notes seem to push forward the most, but this is not a sweet beer necessarily.  The flavor intensifies as it warms in the glass, and the last sip tends to be divine in my opinion.  Drink from a chalice or even wine glass for sure.  The color is a decadent rouge/ molasses."

"Good flavor for a strong beer. Purchased at Cadoro in Italy."

"Pours a dark cloudy amber with a small fizzy head. Aroma is of caramel malt, fruity, yeast and a bit of dark cherry essence mixed in. Taste is sweet caramel malt, fruity, yeast, maybe some toffee and a kind of sweet sherry alcohol flavor and hops bitterness. Palate is full, rich and fairly smooth body, with good carbonation. Finish the same as taste. Alcohol seems to be well hidden, but comes thru more as it warms up. Overall seems a bit strong for a doppelbock, not bad ( if sipped accordingly)."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would describe this as a mean, vicious interpretation of the style.  Many others are much maltier with darker fruit character, but this one is menacing and will knock you off balance.  With all that being said it is scary drinkable and a real treat."

"EKU 28 brewed by Kulmbacher Brauerei AG with an ABV of 11%. This brew is marketed as a malt liquor. This brew pours out a dark caramel amber color with a small white head. EKU 28 is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell is rich with sweetness and caramel. You pick up on some grains in this brew. Not a bad brew so far. The taste is sweet with some grains. There is a slight bitterness to this brew. but nothing over powering. I'm guess the brew get it sweetness from the high ABV. This brew goes down smooth with no bad after taste. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. Kulmbacher Brauerei AG did a nice job with this brew. This brew is nicely balance with a high high ABV. The high ABV is it is not notable in this brew, goes down smooth and clean. This brew is better than what I was expecting. I will get this brew again."

"I had fears that it would be a little strong and overpowering but thankfully this wasn't the case. Very sweet & malty, the beer tasted great. Definitely one worth picking up & it was fairly cheap as well which always helps."
""
"O: this beer was a revelation to me all those years ago when I was still discovering new brews and buying most of my bottles by the intrigue of their label alone... this is a beer that most certainly stands alone among all the many beers I've tasted - difficult to find a twin or sibling to it (Samichlaus???)... it's ridiculously easy to drink and still one of my favorites"
""
""
""
"very clear amber, light tan head dies down to lingering thin layer, no lacing. banana, cloves, aspirin, alcohol heat, dry in the middle, a bit of cherry and wood in the nose, consistent carbonation, finishes with a bit of lingering bitterness underneath the sweetness. pretty good for the style, tho not one i'd go to often, seems a second cousin when compared to samichlaus classic. a serious attitude to the whole thing, not bad, but a sipper for sure."

"Wow what a treat this was. Grab couple more this weekend if still available at a very reasonable $3.50 per. Yesterday was an amazing lager day, I had this before dinner, Lager with Capone's excellent $.25 hot wings followed by a 16 oz Troegenator. You can really taste the similarities in all 3 beers, differing with the ABV of course. Someday I will have to do these 3 and a Samichlaus in ABV order. Going to Lagertown."

"After the high ratings, I was really looking forward to this one. Wow was I disappointed. Smell was artificial bananas and some nuts, taste was straight rough alcohol. Not subtle at all, and there wasn't anything else there. Really wondering what happened here, Kulmbacher is now 0 for 2 in my book."
"Surprisingly good, thought this would be just a bad boozy beer, but it's actually quite a treat."
""
""
"Excellent doppelbock that is on the sweeter side with a complex array of flavors. The alcohol makes it a sipper for sure. Perfect for an after dinner drink, but I found it to pair quite well with a salty German dish like kielbasa and sauerkraut."

"this has been a shelf turd of the highest order, and now i am frustrated that it has! such a dynamic and delicious beer, like a german better version of the less harvest stuff. it pours clear honey amber color, dense looking but clean, not much head after a few seconds. the nose is particularly sweet, like caramelized sugars and taffy. nutty too in nose and taste as well, earthy under all that sweet malt, and the alcohol content is as well hidden as it possibly could be. what i lover here is the buttery malt finish with a hint of dry hay and summertime air, even though this works exquisitely in winter, its magically rich and filling, dense body without a much fizz, but its not missing, it drinks like a brandy and improves with temperature. at under 4 bucks a bottle, i am amazed this is still around, pure market ignorance as far as im concerned, i will be buying this frequently as long as the weather stays cold."

"O: A terrific doppelbock. Drinks more like a bourbon barrel ale. Would go well with a cigar. Share with friends."
""
""
""
""
"o: Not quite top tier, but I would buy this again. Good stuff."
""
"Overall- Pretty good beer that is true to the style. If you like doppelbocks, you won't be disappointed. Possibly would repurchase this."

"I can sum this up nicely with one word... Wow! This is an incredible beer! Get it. Enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to remember not to get this and stick to the eisbock."
"Very malt dominant beer, as it should be, with a high alcohol kick. Rich, but the toasted malt and hops keep it fairly in check. Just a bit hot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong doppelbock, top notch for an almost sub style, a must for lovers of such. Low drinkability, hard to drink the whole bottle if you have something else lined up for the evening. Take it with time and water."
""

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; please disregard those scores"
"O- This is unlike any German beer I have had. It has more attributes of a Belgian strong, with out the spiciness. It's a big big beer, which you don't see too much of coming out of that country, but it is so well done. Incredible and a total surprise to me."
"Overall: Solid beer and quite the sipper. Especially out of a mug. I feel that this beer would take hours to drink and a gallon of water, but that's the way the style is intended to be. I couldn't see myself drinking more than one, but enjoying it a few times a year."
""

"I didn't have expectations here, but I love it. It is sweet, loaded with booze, and I can see myself drinking a jug of this stuff. I wonder if they serve this by the jug in Germanyâ€¦ I am sure they do. Let's go find out. Prost!"

"This is an outstanding beer. Well balanced, but strong. Appropriately carbonated. Not as sweet as I had expected (to my happiness) but just as malty as you would expect. Beautiful color. Lots of little tiny bubbles. This is high quality and I haven't got a great deal of experience with the style, but now I'm eager to try some more."
"M: an intense and complex sensation, since start alcohol can be easily detected. Sweetness is strong but not overwhelming it is a balanced sensation."

"O: As my first eisbock I was unsure of if I would enjoy the style. I was pleasantly surprised by how balanced this beer is. I was expecting a much sweeter, alcoholic tasting, ""chunckier"" brew. I would seek out this beer again."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottle code 2054134. Pours crystal clear orange-copper color with a 1-2 finger off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, grape, molasses, raisin, prune, toast, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, raisin, toffee, molasses, prune, toast, grape, and light herbal spiciness. Light spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, earth, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; with no cloying sweetness at all. Fairly dry on the finish surprisingly. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is insanely well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Dangerously smooth to sip on. Overall this is an damn nice doppelbock! Nice flavor balance and complexity; and surprisingly smooth to sip on. Really enjoyable stuff."
"O - This is a sweet, thick warmer. The flavors are well balanced given the ABV, but damn... this one can knock you on your ass."
""
""
""
"Pours a rich copper color with minimal head, barely any retention but noticeable bubbles throughout. Not bad for an 11%. Smell hints strongly at a huge malt presence. I get a bit of raisin in there. Taste is pretty spectacular. A big smack of alcohol comes straight away, followed by creamy caramel and fruity goodness and then finished with a bit of spice from the alcohol again. Surprisingly, it's not out of balance at all. And that alcohol is really nice and warming. It's a beer to be reserved for night caps and it makes for a great change of pace as such."

"Big thanks goes out to my doppelganger for sharing this one! Served from bottle into a Terrapin mason jar. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, alcohol, caramel, caramel hop, and subtle fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This one was definitely on the slightly boozy side if I am honest, however there was enough other things going on here to help cover that up slightly and balance it out. The mouthfeel on this one was spot-on though and definitely helped with the drinkability. Glad I got the chance to try this one, but doubt I would go out of my way to do so again."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear dark amber with a tall, biege head that dissipates slowly. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Lacing is not left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. A wispy cap is left atop the beer after the head dissipates. The beer smells very sweet and the alcohol comes through in the aroma as well. The aroma is slightly bready. The flavor is dominated by bready sweetness from the malt and the alcohol heat does come through in the flavor. It's grainy. The body is full with little carbonation. The finish is dry. The alcohol content makes this beer a sipper, but it is an easy sipper. Overall, this is an excellent beer for the style. One wants a doppelbock to be a meal in a glass and this satisfies."

"EKU 28 has won its case as a quality German doppelbock, but I don't think I'll be picking up an entire case of this sucker. A few bottles to lay down would be fine, but I don't think I'd want to mess around with 24, or even 12, of these bad boys to determine peaking age. A very sturdy brew, but nothing to go all-in on. Still very deserving of my overall score. 4.0"

"O: This is a pretty awesome beer I must say. I've no way of knowing if the off flavors in the aroma are usual or if It's an effect of travel but the flavor more than makes up for them. Rich and crisp all at once, sweet flavors but not overtly so."

"D: this has to be the biggest doppel i have had thus far. love how smooth this is on such a big body. makes it very drinkable. reminds me of an english barleywine without as much complexity. good beer worth grabbing."
"Over all this is a nice sipper to be enjoyed slowly. I had cellared this bottle for two years and I may save the last bottle I have for another year."
"D: Pleasantly surprised what EKU 28 turned into after coming to cellar temp. Doppelbocks aren't my favorite style, but I'd like to have this one again sometime."
"Overall Drinkability - I recommend giving half a bottle a high pour, then intermittedly pouring the rest as needed for head."
"Pours a medium amber, minimal head, zero lacing, very few bubbles. Smell is honey, malt, alcohol. Tastes like honey malt and alcohol as well. Being my first doppelbock, maybe EKU 28 was a little heavy to start with at 11%ABV. However it leaves behind a nice feeling in the throat of alcohol and honey after a sip. Call me crazy but this reminds me a little of Barenjager. Certainly interesting and out of the norm for me. Not a favorite, but worth a try."
"O: A tasty doppelbock. Flavors are true, though the color is a bit light. A persuasive beer. Will buy it again."
"Thanks to Tolann and her friends for sharing beers a month or so back at her basement party. This one poured a dark amber color with a smallish light tan head. Aromas of sweet malt, caramel, raisins and toffee. On the palate, this one was thick and full bodied, with tons of malt, caramel and booze."
"The CPJ"
"Creamy, sikly and slick. A bit sticky but not overly cloying. Complex and enjoyable sipper."
"For the price you pay, this has got to be one of the best values around for a beer of this quality and style."
"Dr: Good quality, easy drinking, and a very high price. Worth a go if you love the style, I guess."
"If you like heavy thick sweet and sugary dense beer with some pronounced vinous characteristics and loads of alcohol hotness that spreads around your belly, you'll like this one."
"Poured a 2.5"" golden head and has a beautiful clear orangy gold color to the beer. Smell has malt and sourdough. Tasty is very malty, a touch sweet and sour, and strengthened as the beer warmed. Moderate malty finish. Despite the high alcohol it's very well hidden and sneaks up on you. Really a top knotch treat and I'm becoming quite a fan of Kulmbacher's offerings."
"Poured as a copper color with a thin white head on top. The head didn't last very long and didn't leave much lacing. The smell of the beer had a boozey aroma and some heavy malts in the background. The taste was mostly malts along with a nice alcohol heat in the throat. The mouthfeel was smooth though and very drinkable. I'd like to try this one again someday just to see what I think of it now after having beers that are stronger than that one."
"Pours a dense, lively almost-white head. Crystal clear, beautiful. The color of fresh, bright copper. Some noble and piney hops in the beggining quickly fading, leaving aromas of dried fruit, grapes, and wine. Lightly floral like chamomile tea. A bit sweet with lightly fruity and floral flavors."
"O: I was impressed that the alcohol was well hidden. It was sweet but the oak and vanilla balanced it out just enough from it becoming overly sweet or cloying. The light mouth feel really hurt for me."
"O - A very complex and well crafted beer. This is a sipper, or a warmer. A high abv, warming, spiced malt brew this beer is high quality."
"D: This is a big sipping beer, that stands up like a big barleywine. Something I likely never would have tried. -- another example of why I return each year to the BOMC."
"Revisiting this beer in early 2013, I almost feel like I had a bad batch last time. I don't expect that is actually the case, but I don't get any of the obnoxious flavors I remember from last time I had this beer. In fact, I rather liked it."
"This is a doppelbock so strong in flavor and alcohol, it puts many eisbocks to shame - and while I rarely shell out the $20+ for a six-pack - very little else can satisfy the craving that this beer engenders."
"From the bottle to a tulip. Pours a bright copper with a very thin head. Smells of malt and alcohol. Mouth feel is somewhat thin with some level of tingliness. Taste is well balanced with malts, sweeter hops, molasses and the alcohol is present. This was an experiment for me and I was pleased. Definitely a ""one and done"" due to the ABV, this was still surprisingly drinkable."
"Smell first pushes through some notes of sherry along with some dark fruits, cherry, and molasses. Brown sugar there as well. Lightly sweet and a bit boozy. Very complex. Flavor isn't quite as well integrated, hitting more of the sweet brown sugar notes and less of the sherry. There's also quite a bit more booze than there was in the nose. Feel is medium with low carbonation and a bit of alcohol. Quite good overall. Very different than the typical doppelbock, though something that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Worth trying if you see it."
"Nicely drinkable huge beer, but a bit lacking in depth and complexity."
"Overall a lighter depth of flavor than I had anticipated. Dangerously easy to drink considering the high ABV. The alcohol isn't hidden, but the heat it provides complements rather than detracts."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how bold in flavor it was. The aroma was strong, and did not miss any crucial components for a doppelbock. The flavor profile was similar, in that it included everything standard. Where this beer stands apart is certainly in the abv, which is over the top, but seemingly appropriate for such a big brew."
"Wow. Anyone want the rest of my bottles?"
"D - This is certainly a big beer, and I realize this as I type this review with a warm alcohol feeling in my belly. Very well crafted and a good example of a strong Bock. If you like big beers, this one is definitely worth a shot."
"Drinkability: Once again another perfect example of a sherry/port like style. A fine beer to sip and enjoy next to the fire on a cold winter night."
"D - As akin to the Samichlaus, the EKU 28 is also a Doppelbock that better fits the profile of a Barley Wine. At 11%, the alcohol is fairly well disguised; this beer is good, but I would generally prefer the Samichlaus, as well as most other Barley Wines I've tried. (3.5)"
"Drinkability - definetly a sipper, for its price range (~$3.50 for a 12 oz), I will likely look at other alternatives when looking to drink a dopplebock (one of my favorite styles). This was a good beverage that I am glad I tried, though"
"Contrary to popular belief, this is not an Eisbock. There is no freezing process used by Kulmbach in the brewing of this beer. Rather, the beer is supposedly allowed to ferment for several months. Whatever the methods, the results are delicious."
"Poured a clear, dark amber with an off white head that mostly lasted and left good lacing. The aroma was heavy caramel, lots of alcohol, some fruitiness and whiskey notes. The initial flavor was moderately sweet, Malty while the finish was Caramel and a little hot alcohol. Pretty good, Med to heavy body. Kinda like a good Double bock should."
"Dark amber with a deep orange hue, not quite coppery. Very clear with a thin wisp of fine whitish bubbles on the surface of the beer. A bit of spotty lacing. Very malt aroma, grains, caramel, alcohol, toasty, hint of fruit. Alcohol soaked raisins up front, sweet malts and caramel, toasted, lingering grains. Viscous body with low carbonation, lots of alcohol warmth. Pretty good overall, fairly drinkable for a big beer -- lots of sweetness but not cloying."
"Notes: I am defiantly a fan of this beer."
"Drinkability: I would save this beer for an after dinner desert type. Would not drink it on an empty stomach on a hot day. Overall, it would be really good for certain circumstances, but not all."
"D: This is a beer that needs to be slowly sipped given its alcohol content."
"D - Normally I would say this is a big boozy mess but everything seems to work well together."
"D-I'm curious to see how his ages. Compared to the Samichlaus beers, this isn't very complex. However, it is marginally appealing. The sugars are too intense, but with some time, this might be a less expensive alternative to Samichlaus."
"Foam virtually non-existent and not persistent. Golden brown nose alcohol both dry and sweet, a little like a mix between a full-bodied rosÃ© wine, a Bourbon and dried fruit alcohol. Taste very bitter and sweet on sugar, especially on sugar. The texture is thick or syrupy, and reminiscent of the cognac finish. Too much sugar. It does not feel like drinking a beer while yet, there are a number of beer at 11 Â° perfectly drinkable."
"Brilliantly clear auburn, a finger of off-white head caps the body and retains well. Toasted, caramelized malt aroma, very clean. There's a hint of fruitiness to it but it's primarily rich malt. Up front flavors of dates and toast; finishes very caramelized, chewy and rich. Alcohol is surprisingly well hidden, and it ends on a clean note."
"Drink: It is a bit on the heavy side and is perfect for when you are at a pub after a awful winters work day and are determined to down a huge rare burger."
"Thick clear reddish copper brew gives a nice 1"" light tan head that settles fairly quickly to a thin fizzy layer. Zero lace. Smells thick and sweet, raisin and dried cherry, a bit of boozy warmth and spice. Feel is a little sticky, a bit thicker and sweeter than moderate but neither is in the extreme. Taste is of raisin and thick over-ripe banana, a bit nutty, finishes with licorice, spices and booze. Alcohol is felt a bit, but given the ABV is hidden fairly well. This is a pretty good brew, nothing spectacular but good and interesting enough that I'd drink it regularly if it were reasonably priced and readily available. Certainly gets the job done on the EtOH front."
"Drinkability is good, especially considering the alcohol. This was recommended to me on the fly; definitely glad I gave of a shot."
"Overall the beer is a pretty good beer and can creep up on you if drinking quickly. The beer had strong notes of malt and was what I expected. I enjoyed this beer and would purchase again."
"Drinkability: This is a fine-drinking beer, as long as you're used to such a taste. I enjoy this now way more than I used to, and I think it's a great example of its style. Definitely worth trying."
"It almost drinks more like an eisbock than a doppel because its so strong. The real achievement is that it never overwhelms you with the taste of alcohol. Its all very well balanced. A very tasty beer but I think its best to be sipped."
"D- Good starter beer for a night but would not drink many of them in a night. Can see myself easily getting drunk on this beer. I can see how some may not like this beer but I enjoyed it."
"D: A definite sipper, really in the dessert wine arena of drinks, would make a great digestif."
"Notes: Smooth and well integrated flavors. Delightful."
"Conclusion: Really glad I finally got to try this one. Makes a pleasant nightcap; if I'd thought ahead, I bet some pecans would go really well with this."
"Drinkability: A strong, sweet, potent lager, with the overall drinkability you'd expect from such a brew. So, it makes for a decent late-day sipper and is not something to pound in the early afternoon (well, not me, at least)."
"Overall, EKU 28 has a nice aroma & taste, but both are quickly overpowered by the alcohol. I'm had other versions of this style and enjoyed them, but this was a disappointment. Too much alcohol presence for me."
"Overall, the boldest dopplebock I have yet to try. Best take this one seriously; sip and enjoy. While this is alot bolder than i prefer a dopplebock, it is a great beer for cold winter nights."
"Wow, 11%, cannot even tell. I hope that isn't because I've tipped a few tonight, but I am impressed. I could drink a few of these and likely be sorry in the morning."
"The label says it is ""never cloying, wonderfully aromatic & warming"" & renoun beer critic Michael Jackson says it's a four star ""world classic"". Who am I to argue? This is a kick ass beer."
"Mouthfeel is refreshing with medium carbonation. Drinkability is OK but slightly spoiled by the high alcohol content."
"Quite interesting and drinks better than I anticipated, or should I say feared, given its robust ABV. As room temperature is approached, this brew sips like a lightly fruity cordial."
"doppelbock."
"Purchased a single at Whole Foods Dedham. Poured into my Ayinger Celebrator glass. Head quickly fades to nothing. Dark auburn color. No lacing. Smells sweet and boozy. Taste was better than I was expecting for the price. Fruity, sugary, and malty. As the bottle says, this beer can easily replace a sherry or a port. Would look good poured into a snifter I bet. Mouthfeel was definitely thick and chewy, which I like, but it got a bit sticky on the palate after a while. Drinkability was good, even though this beer is 11% and so dense. A good choice for an after dinner drink."
"D=3.5 I couldn't drink too much of this beer but the 12 oz bottle was a perfect size. It goes down well and hits with a punch at 11 percent abv. Good beer wouldn't pass this up if I found it again"
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Appearance leaves a little to desire, and the nose is really sweet and woody. Flavor is strong alcohol, sweet and heavy. A little bittersweet. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"D - Rich and thick, the malt character of this beer is not overly complex, but it is incredibly satisfying. The toffee character that dominates the flavor is intense but never becomes cloying and there is enough caramel and molasses to add depth without becoming excessive. The most impressive aspect of this beer is what you don't notice; there isn't a hint of harshness or heat from the 11% abv. This is a great example of the style and worth seeking out."
"beer pours a medium dark orange with light orange head, something I would expect from an ipa of sorts. pretty sweet nose, can't really smell the booze though. the taste is quite sweet, with a strong ethanol bite in the finish. overall sweetness is well paired with stronger tasting foods like Rotkohl and b-wurst. it goes pretty well with blutwurst and bread, but the sweetness really calls for somethign savory to contrast."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, a little prickliness from the carbonation, has a heavy, and somewhat chewy body. Not overly drinkable, I could handle one of these before moving on to something else, not because it's a bad beer, and not even because it's high ABV, it's really due to the sweet malt character of this impressive beer."
"The 11.0%abv is not in-your-face, but is still easily spotted. Despite this fact, this is still a tasty and drinkable beer. Just don't drink too many, or too quickly, as I think that it would cost you, the next day."
"D: Seems you're drinking a beer with 30Â° ABV, a very strong beer to be respected, i finished all they had at Walmart."
"Pours a clear, red color. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, yeast, and pale malt. Fits the style of a Doppelbock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, roasted malt, and slight pale malt. Overall, a rather pleasing doppel, which packs a punch."
"Drinkability: I feel like this is one of those beers which I appreciate on a style level, but that I'm not really keen on drinking much."
"Its pretty tasty, but this is a stong beer. Nice occasional treat."
"There is a hit of sweet, some sour layers and generally a pretty complex drink. The 11% alcohol is present but not offensive."
"drinkability - This'll creep up on you. Very smooth."
"the finish for this particular brew was a medium to full body with a thinning alcohol on the tongue that leaves a warming sweetness behind. this is a great tasting strong beer and not very expensive at that. a good beer for a cold night!"
"The taste is loaded with ABV, and it is a throaty ABV at that. At 11%, this beer leaves nothing uncovered. It packs a wallop and is strong. It is medium bodied, strong, a tad syrupy, with florals, a liqueur alcohol sweetness, some candied malts, some burnt alcohol notes, and just rum soaked caramel and pineapple. This beer tastes a bit like it has been or should be flambe'ed. This beer is just too strong for me and too sherry like. If you like over the top strong double bocks than start here."
"Aroma - pours a deep amber, little head. Smell - a very deep a rich port-like smell, caramel sweet tones as well. Taste - put into the same context as similar beers, this is a much smoother dopplebock, to the point that the 11% boozy taste is toned down a bit, making this somewhat drinkable. The mouthfeel is rich and syrupy. This is good to try, but if your going to sit down and have a few, get a cab."
"Final thoughts: A pretty decent Doppeboch. Pretty heavy but not too heavy. Big malty sweet hit with lots of dark fruits and some molasses and even finishes bitter and still semi heavy, but doesn't overpower the finish. A good beer now, but I think it'll be amazing in a few years. I think this is available around here too, so I should find it and cellar a few for a few years. Thanks again Alex, especially for the perfect timing."
"D- This beer is in it's own category, if you like Mirror Mirror you'll love this stuff at a fraction of the cost. I for one find it a bit too sweet but it's still a great beer, 11% ABV does put a smile on my face. :)"
"The flavor is also sweet. It is very inviting and surprisingly easy to drink. Beer is completely full bodied and really smooth. Really enjoying this beer a lot. Drinkability high, mouthfeel high."
"Not the worst beer ever."
"overall: not much to look at but this beer is absolutely delicious and would be an amazing cheese beer, try it with some blue or even a really funky triple cream"
"EKU 28 is probably the strongest Doppelbock still following the Reinheitsgebot. At the price point, it's no wonder this is reserved for German royalty."
"D - A sipper for sure and very drinkable, despite the alcohol. Would love to see what some cellaring will do."
"Wow, a truly distinct brew, after researching this brew i found a truly amazing story behind it. Poured a red orange but mostly brown color with very little head from an 11.2 oz bottle into into a chalice. smells of alcohol and toffee with hints of caramel and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is considerably warming with a definite candy/burnt sugar presence with a little bit of scorched apple to note. I will be getting this beer again. its mouthfeel is that of an extreme beer but one that is restrained enough to still be called a beer"
"Overall a good and a richly complex beer, with no cheap gimmicks to spike the beer bowl. Muy bien!"
"Overall it's a heavy duty potent brew that has to be respected in order to enjoy it properly. The other brew of this caliber that I tried was Samichlaus and this blows it out of the water although this is something i would only drink on say Christmas or Thanksgiving. For strong German brews I think the Eisbocks are the best bet."
"D - Big ABV, but could do a few."
"This brew is billed as a malt liquor on the label, which also touts it as a stand in for a fine sherry or port. Well, whoopteedoo! If I wanted crap wine, I wouldn't be drinking beer. I don't relish being the iconoclast, but this libation just doesn't do anything for me. It's just too sweet and funky for rednecks like me, although it is a drinkable beer if one is into that kind of stuff. I didn't have any wine glasses available so I poured it into a Mason jar. All the parameters were there for a great beer until I tasted it. Then I tried to pawn it off on my wine aficionada daughter. No suck luck, turns out she doesn't like sherry or port either."
"D: This drinks much like an English barleywine or old ale with fewer fruity notes. The mild alcohol burn reminds you that this is potent stuff. One will be plenty for the evening."
"Has a dark orange/amber color with a very thin dark beige head that dispersed rather quickly. Has a light sweet smell, maybe or caramel. Taste is initially sweet caramel when the beer first hits the tongue, but then the alcohol hits you, really hard. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, but you don't really get a chance to savor it due to the strength of the alcohol. Overall a decent tasting beer, but too strong for my personal taste."
"Flavors are great, as is structure and scent, but the 11%, though surprisingly better hidden than the percentage would dictate, still keeps this from being the immediate first grab from the fridge. I liked this, but one and done for a while. Absolutely worth a try, but only under particular circumstances."
"D: The strength of this one definitely don't make it super drinkable for me, but it's VERY drinkable, considering its strength."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and sweet, very malty, and mildly carbonated. This is really a great beer!"
"D - Not to say this isn't a fantastic beer but the level of alcohol compounded by the insane malty sweetness doesn't make this a friendly drinking beer. It demands attention with how ""big"" it is."
"Way too boozy to be considered drinkable, but it's still enjoyable."
"PS i think that this beer most be considered as an Eisbock, it is brewed by freezing a dopplebock and taking away the remaining water.."
"D - I've got mixed feelings on Eku 28. A very tasty beer but a little rough. One of the most aromatic and delicious doppelbocks I've had, but it's a bit too boozy. On the verge of being a truly great beer, if they could just hide that alcohol a little bit better."
"Would do a better review but my 1 month old will not stop crying."
"Golden body, reflecting plenty of light. Initial thin cap of foam that dwindled to a thin ring. Appearance was much like a barleywine. Buttery and rich aroma, strong note of grape-nuts barley, and a slightly vegetal aged hop edge. Sweet malty flavor, approaches cloying, but still enjoyable. Some mild buttered popcorn creeps in too. A rich and malty blanket smothers the palate. Very slow sipper, even after a year or more this is a boozy beast..."
"D: When I was younger, we referred to this as 'your trip to hell' because of the high alcohol. This beer is definitely not for the faint of heart. If I were sitting outside in a beer garden on a brisk early spring day, EKU 28 would be a good choice to have in front of me."
"This was one fine brew. Underrated! I would compare it to Samichlaus, though not quite as rich. I would call it the next best thing, which is pretty damn great by the way. I was weary of spending $18.99 for a six pack of this, but I feel it was worth it. This is one for aging and at under $3.50 a bottle I feel that I cheated the store."
"Pours a pure copper color with apparent carbonization bubbling up the sides to a rather slight head. Head quickly dissipates and leaves almost no lacing. A very sweet, malt aroma; almost a ""rummy"" alcohol scent. I cannot put a finger on the fruit, something dark, like raison or prune (maybe?) provides the sweet aroma. That taste is incredible, a spicy alcohol punch that is muted by the sweet, caramel malt backbone. The alcohol is there, but does not overtake the flavor, which nice given the ABV, but still provides a nice warming effect. Definitely a nice beer to sip and enjoy the mixed flavors. It does leave a lasting aftertaste, not bad, but just a side effect of its robust flavor. A bit tart in your mouth, and obviously, rather strong, its a slow sippin' beer. One I feel I should have ended the night on, rather than began it with..."
"d: Good: sweet, alcoholic,complex."
"Drinkability: Cloyingly sweet but a nice sipper at the end of the day, nevertheless"
"D - This is a style that I have little familiarity with due to its rarity so I don't have a very good frame of reference. However, I did like the beer and would try again if given the opportunity. There seems to be some complexity in the malt that is interesting. This might age very well."
"Quite drinkable for a Doppelbock, despite its hefty alcohol content. This one just keeps going, with no real room for sipping. It's too delicious to savor for long."
"D: I love this beer. I would drink it every day if it weren't so expensive."
"Exellent beer all around. Very balanced for a doppelbock. Nice job."
"Overall: The mouth feel is medium carbonated and full bodied. The finish is medium and lingers on the palate for a moment. This beer has a very strong malt flavor which hides the alcohol. The beer is extremely smooth and very drinkable. This beer is very well made. The only thing I was disappointed is the head was nonexistent."
"I can make room for this one in my beer heart. Typically, I find myself shying away from heavy hitters with these characteristics. I knock the drinkability up a half"
"Drinkability- This has to be a night cap and a beer you only have one of just way to over powering and though high alcohol is hidden a bit just thick and syrupy for more then a nite cap. An okay beer but not one that leaves you wanting another"
"D - a nice sipper for a nightcap."
"Pours a clear dark copper with a large pale buff head. The foam sticks around for a minute or so before drawing back to a small cap with some nice lacing. Smells sweetly of roasted caramel malts, sherry, some doughiness, and a hint of alchohol. Very strong. The caramel and sherry come back strongly in the taste, along with some orange. Warming alcohol finish. Thick feel bordering on syrupy. A very nice sipper, but it's not quite up to the standard of Kulmbacher's original."
"Not a bad beer at all, but a beer of which one is plenty. The high ABV is very warming and the thickness of body makes it very filling."
"It has a great nutty taste. To be honest, I thought this was going to taste more like wine than beer, but was pleasantly surprised with the taste. Definitely high quality."
"Notes - This is pretty damned tasty. The taste doesn't quite match the aroma, but maybe that's just me."
"Overall - I think this beer could use a few more years in the cellar. The alcohol and bitterness is still quite high. I think the bouquet would greatly improve with age, as would the overall character of the beer. Still, a lovely beer."
"Not all that thick, but with a somewhat chewy feel. A hint of syrup in the feel as it warms. Belied by the sharp alcohol. There are some nice contrasts in this beer."
"Drinkability: Well, with 11% ABV, this certainly isn't a beer you pound one after the other. It is a pleasant sipper though."
"Pours a nice clear coppery-red with a fairly thick, pale yellow head that does not stick around. Aroma is strong and more fruity than malty, not at all like a beer with such a high alcohol content. Flavor has a fairly fierce but not overwhelming alcohol bite; taste is mainly sweet and fruity with an undertone of caramel, more like liquor than beer. Aftertaste is sweet without being cloying."
"Pours clear mahogany with a tiny off-white head. Soapy, prune and raisins aroma, with heavy ethyl. Unusually viscous feeling in the mouth, which only makes the beer taste heavier. It tastes like overripe apples and raisins. Second and third swigs did not improve my feelings. Very disappointed. I let the drain sample the rest."
"Too sweet and the lack of a head, un-beery look along with its fruity smell doesn't do it any favours and the 11% just masks its shortcomings."
"The taste is wonderful, rich, sweet-spicey, oaky-woody with strong raisins, caremlized dried figs, turned plums, caramelly and fruity overall with nice, warming alcoholic-dried-fruit spiciness. It's quite sweet but so wonderful in feel and taste and so smooth, that this is ok."
"Drinkability: This very heavy alcohol presence keeps the drinkability down, however the lip licking sweetness if a wonderful suprise. This is an excellent sipping beer, but a poor session selection."
"Poured a copper amber color with a small white head. Nose of malt and caramel. A powerful taste of malt and caramel and strong presence of both in the finish. The alcohol comes through as an after affect of the finsh. Nice flavor, but definately a sipper style, even if it does come in a six pack."
"This beer was light copper color, very clear, with almost no head at all. I guess I expected little head or head retention from an eisbock, so I can rate the appearance as average. The aroma is way above average though, a malt bomb with hints of doppelbock mixed with a little St Bernardus ABT 12. I didn't smell any alcohol but the doppelbock/ABT aroma promised it would be strong. And it was, the taste was strong sweet malts and alcohol, very tasty. The body was thick enough for the flavors to coat my mouth, very filling. Drinkability is average, I couldn't pound this or even go for a second beer. A very good beer which I'd recommend to malt lovers."
"Poured into goblet. A very nice amber (clear) color with somewhat thin head. Virtually no lacing or retention but a beautiful color. Smell was a bit off-putting as the dominate smell to me was alcohol, like straight up rubbing alcohol. Some sweet malt snuck in underneath the booze tones. Tastes was much better than smell, a very sweet and malty experience at first followed by a bit of fruit (cherries I swear) and melon followed by the alcohol. A very warming, whiskey like sensation as it goes down. Mouthfeel was thicker which seemed appropriate. Overall a good beer. The 11.2 oz's I had was enough but I could revisit this."
"Drinkability: Drinkable? Hardly. Tasty? Sure. Well-hidden alcohol? Hardly. High alcohol? You better believe it. This is one monster of a beer, and though it's not the tastiest of beer (or the most well-hidden in terms of alcohol), it's not too shabby."
"Pours a very clear amber with a short acting, thin head that all but disappears. Smells super sweet with notes of apples, hard candies, but also subtle hints of bananas and a deep overtone of the high alcohol content. The taste is almost as sweet as the smell. Candied apples, sugar cane and/or brown sugar. The alcohol taste hangs around on your tongue after the sweetness subsides which was expected yet not overbearing. My first experience with an eisbock was welcomed with open arms. I hope it's not the last. Long live high gravity!"
"Drinkability is great. This is one you'll enjoy, but enjoy slowly!"
"Drinkability: Well the high ABV is a bit much, but it tastes good enough to have a couple."
"M&D: this is by far the smoothest lager I've ever tasted... and where is the alcohol? I hadn't had any liquor or spirit before this drink, and yet I simply couldn't detect any bit of warming alcohol on the palate or down the throat. Besides, the finish is so elegant and balanced, showing no syrupy/sticky touch at all, making one wonder what has gone wrong/so great during the brewing of this lager?! Sip by sip off-guard, gradually I can feel the strength creeping up straight to the head, but never to the stomach, throat or palate... All in all, this is a well-crafted strong lager that, with a subtle flavour profile and well-disguised strength, is capable of melting a stubborn iceberg all in good time."
"D - Drinkability is good. This beer is sweet enough and strong enough to make it hard to put down more than one at a time. Granted, that is exactly what to expect from an Eisbock. This one is a nice representation of the style."
"[Mouth] Thick, full bodied, alcohol, and caramel in deep.The finish and Aftertaste is very malty sweet."
"D: this one is definitely a sipper for a cold winter's night...doesn't work so well in the middle of summer, heh. This would actually be a good campfire beer."
"Looks absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. Color ranges from light copper to red with a thin dense off white head. Smell is mothwatering hops, sugar, and a lingering faint floral and oak note. Flavor is...wow. Sweet but not cloying. Hop accents, oranges, caramel, and a tangy finish. Mouthfeel is slick, a touch sticky, and just enough carbonation. Drinkability is limited by the intensity of the flavors and pronounced alcohol character. But still. Dang. Buy some. Today"
"Havent had on of these is some while so decided to pick up one at Ports bottle shop. Poured into delirium tremens glass. Pours a clear copper color with a finger size head that fades rather quickly to leave traces of foam and lacing. Smell is mixture of bannana, apple, carmel, and alcohol. The taste is great, with carmel apple flavors almost like a jolly rancher. While there is a little heat, it is hidden very well all the same. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium body and slight stickness. For the style a great drinking eisbock but this one can make for a rough night if not careful."
"Pours a nice reddish amber color with decent head and lacing. It has a very deep, extremely malty, scent, with nice caramel overtones. A wonderful taste, very deep and thick, huge maltiness, with a great fig-caramel flavor. It goes down a bit thick, but not rough. A wonderful high gravity beer, a new favorite of mine."
"a great beer, lots of smooth balanced flavors and no trace of the abv."
""
"Warm and honeyed towards the finish. Aftertaste is very malty sweet."
"Overall I would drink this beer again, without hesitation. That said, I think one in an evening, especially given it's high alcohol content, is more than enough."
"Certainly a strong bock. Basically a concentrated version of the style with part of the water frozen out. Not bad, not the most drinkable beer, but enjoyable."
"An enjoyable beer once it is allowed to warm up, but definitely a sipper. One is enough in an evening."
"Cigars and whiskey, civil war generals and lipstick collard CEO's rejoice! Charcoal aged malt straightens your posture...the immature days of your youth are left behind with the Magic Hat #9; time to experience a Connoiseur's nectar. Booze and debauchery are served side by side with a fruit basket, and women over forty never looked so sexy. Cognac gives port a hard fucking on a cereal bed of complexity. A wedding of hot totties and caramel party until dawn; unfortunatly keeping the senses up the entire night. Clear your sinuses with a Crazy Horse dancer via slutty wide-mouth wine glass. Remember to chug water before bed."
"Overall impression: A well balanced, dangerously drinkable eisbock. Wonderful depth and maltiness that finishes dry. Works for me any time of year but probably wonderful by a fire in the winter."
"Not my cup of tea, shutter, shutter, cringe. If I want a buzz this bad I'll go jogging and get an exercise high. Beware, this is one bad a$$ elixer."
"I'm glad I got around to trying EKU 28. My overall impression is of an intense doppelbock, with a sweeter-than-normal flavor and larger alcohol presence. Definitely worth sampling, and I imagine this would be a great sipping beverage throughout the year."
"Overall a phenomenal brew. Massive. Not session, but a slow single is highly recommended."
"I had never heard of a eisbock until now but there is a first time for everything! I served it chilled in a pint glass. Poured a lucid auburn color with a nice lacey head. Aromas of sweet malt and a light rum like quality is in the nose. Taste was very sweet grain alcohol like with some fruit in the back and a dry finish that stays with you when you breathe out your nose. I little to alcoholic for me."
"my first eisbock, no decipherable date code, pours a clear med. orange-copper color w/ a thin off-white head which dissipates quickly leaving a fair amount of lacing in my snifter ; a strong smell, a cereal grain and dark malts combined with plums and lots alcohol, a slight buttered caramel undertone ; a rich, sweet, steely grain flavor, some hop bite w/ more butter here, a nutty, faintly vinous sherry-like note about midway, alcoholic and metallic in the finish ; a thick, full bodied beer indeed, not much on the co2 front but enough to keep the bubbles around ; wow, it's like eating a big 'ol steak, could be more drinkable in colder weather, i'll have to try more of the style to be sure..."
"the alcohol and medicinal quality is just a bit too prominent for me. still, it's an interesting brew."
"If you're looking for a high alcohol, extreme beer, thats a little off the beatten path give this a try. This beer shows that an extreme beer doesn't need to be a hop bomb, and that malty beers can hold thier own in the extreme arena."
"The taste, is quite exquisite. Everything in the nose, but much more, more intense, each bit enveloping the other. Quite a complex beer, with rich and juicy fruits of plum, cherry, a little fig perhaps, toasty and sweet, not too much hop if any, the alcohol blazing a path but still out of the way, countering the malt from being too cloying. The mouth is full, rich, warm, very nice, and surprisingly drinkable for such a high alcohol, very sweet beer, which says a lot about the quality of this beer."
"Interesting."
"Pours a bright clear copper color. Smell is clean, with alcohol and caramel. Fairly delicate aroma. Taste is creamier caramel and fairly sweet and buttery. Butterscotch like sweetness about it, and a touch cloying in more than small amounts, yet not bad. More dessert beer like than casual drinker."
"Drinkablity: Good sipping brew. Provides plenty of flavors to explore."
"I wouldn't want more than one of these, but the one I had I was sad to see go. A sipping beer to savor and relish."
"D- This is very smooth and the alcohol is well hidden. I could easily drink a few of these not realizing how potent a brew this was if nobody told me it was 11% ABV."
"Pours a clear, medium amber color with just a covering of off-white head, no tracing. Aromas of rich malty sweetness, raisin, winey alcohol that is almost sherry like. Quite clean overall, but appropriate for style. On the palate, a graham cracker flavor comes through first following with a dark fruity sweetness, hop bitterness next and warming alcohol sting finish. This is quite similar to the Urbock 23, as lighter DBs go. Overall, it's clean, not overly sweet and closer to a sherry than a beer. The toasty malts are very subdued, and it's more the fruit and hops that deliver the most flavor. I tend to favor darker styles, but this is good nonetheless."
"I just wanted to say that this beer is a shinning example of how flavorful and interesting a Reinheitsgebot beer can be. I've had beer with fruit syrup squirted into it that has less fruit flavor than this amazing brew. With such a creamy and foamy mouthfeel, mixed with the perfectly sweet caramel fruitiness, I feel like I'm eating a really smooth fruit custard tart or cake. All this out of 4 ingredients!!! PROST!"
"The taste was a sweet bready malt that was syrupy and tasted like tangerines. The mouthfeel was coated by the syrup nature which was pleasing and it tended to linger on the tongue. Overall was well worth the price. I would have it again for sure."
"Bottle. Roasty, malty, burnt caramel aroma with hints of vanilla, marzipan and slight alcohol. Clear amber/brown color with a thick tan head that lasted quite a while. Raisiny, malty, slightly sweet with some alcohol in flavor. Hop bitterness became apparent in aftertaste but was overshadowed up front. Effervescent with fine carbonation. Full bodied, almost chewy but not cloying. Medium finish with some alcohol apparent in aftertase along with bitterness and some sweetness. Big and complex but very well executed and well balanced."
"This beer has very sophisticated taste perhaps a little sweet for me but still pretty good."
"Big chewy texture with some burn from the alcohol. I do find this beer to be quite restorative, sip this on a cold evening and forget about turning on the heater, you won't need it. The flavors are complex and heavy on the tongue. Recommended."
"I was impressed by the EKU28! I thought it might be a little too much on the sweet side from reading the reviews, but it wasn't over-the-top sweet. A very good beer if you like them malty."
"pours a clear amberish red color with no head to speak of. smells a bit sour with some fruit notes. the taste is superb for the style, subtlely sour yet still smooth and creamy with some liquor tones too. the mouth-feel is velvety, period all the way through. drinks easy enough. more than just worth a try."
"This pours a clear orange/brown/copper color with an ok white head that fades very fast. Nose is of caramel and dark fruit. Taste follows with caramelized dark fruit and typical good sugary eisbock flavor. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is good, but maybe a little thin. drinkability is good. Sugar resides on the lips after each sip and taste lingers somewhat. abv is very well hidden, but you can feel the warmth in your stomach. Reminds me alot of the urbock from eggenberg, but clearer color. Good beer, one I will revisit next time I go into my cellar."
"Overall, pretty good. I think i would go for their other eisbock more times than not, but this one is nice to sip on, when in the mood."
"D: Drinkability may be limited due to the viscous sweet syrupy nature and high alcohol content. Definity a sipper."
"This is a drinkable beer, though, to be honest, it's not my cup of tea."
"D: While perhaps I haven't been personally blown away by the taste or feel, it is still quite drinkable, without question."
"I have only had this brew twice before, both times with a coworker who really likes German brews... I am sooo glad I took time to review it... almost certainly the most ""perfect for the style"" brew I've reviewed thus far."
"Again very syrupy but moderately bright do to good carbonation. The thicker texture still comes out however. A slicker finish is characterized by some more booze induced warmth. An interesting beer experience, but just not a selection I'd drink on a regular basis."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium to thick bodied. Carbonation is excellent. Very smooth and easy to drink. Obviously, its strength hinders it in that department. But, still very drinkable. Overall, very good beer. I wasn't expecting much, but walk away very impressed."
"Pours crystal clear, dr. browns cream soda color. Smells like ripe bananas, tastes like caramelized bananas, with a heavy alcohol presence. What can I say? This tastes like a banana flambes with all the liquor too. Not bad, but not great either. 11% kicks in pretty quick."
"Pours a clear amber with a one finger head that recedes without leaving lacing. Nose has a lot of alcohol present I want to say just a touch of gingerbread maybe. Extremely sweet on the tongue - almost as if it were a dessert drink. Alcohol barely comes through at the end, but you can't tell you are downing 11% on this one, which makes it dangerously drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth but with a syrupy tone. You could drink a lot of these in one sitting I'd imagine. But just be sure to call a cab."
"Full aftertaste, a bit alcoholic. Not too full bodied, but quite full in the mouth."
"D:"
"Clear reddish brown with ruby highlights and just a little off white lacing. Heavy malt characters; caramel, molasses, prune, and cherry all kept in check by a big alcohol ester. The taste echoes much of the nose. A bit fruitier, brandy like fusels, caramelized sugars, and hops providing a thin bitterness and tea notes. The alcohol while mildly hot is smooth and keeps the thick mouthfeel from being too syrupy. The finish has a slow tartness and reveals some vinous character. Full bodied, and silky smooth."
"Thanks to Todd the beer guy (Buckspin) for this one. pours a clear brown golden color with no head. Smells like very sweet malt with hints of candied fruit. Tastes like malt with alcohol hitting you right up front, actually alcohol taste is quite dominate. Mouthfeel is quite syrupy. Overall, it tastes like alcohol but not any negative sense, but the sweetness does not last."
"Appearance has a nice amber with very little to no head. Smell is sweet and malty and grainy. Taste is ""wow"" in your face, like a rich desert that is almost to much to handle, with sweet malts, dark fruits and spiciness with an alchohol punch. Mouthfeel is full and syrupy with a good amount of carbonation. I did not know what to expect with this beer, besides the high ABV, but turns out to be a combonation with the full flavor making it a good warming sipping beer."
"Review added 10-17-2007, translated from french 3-5-2008."
"Served in a tall Corsendonk glass, this beer has a rich ruby red color, with a short lived head. Nose is overwhelmingly one of malt; it reminded me of a wort brewing before I add the hops! Taste is also quite powerful; strongly malty, with hints of bread and raisins. Minimal carbonation, with a syrupy character and a strong taste of alcohol. Definitely not a beer to drink on a hot summer day; great sipper on a cold fall evening."
"This isn't the best eisbock I've had, but it's not too bad either. I can see buying more of these as this is significantly cheaper than some of the others. Nice lager cleanliness and bold and flavorful."
"Nasty!"
"This was one thick drink. Very sticky - almost like a lite syrup. Sticks to your mouth to let all the flavor be released. Not something I could drink all night, but still very tasty and smooth. Recommended."
"Drinkability is pretty solid for a brew boasting 11% abv. I enjoyed every sip, but some feel it is a ""love it or hate it"" kind of beer. I recommend it highly"
"This beer pours a clear tawny red color. The head is one inch in height, and off white with pink hues in color Lacing is decent. The aroma is of caramel, with a grassy noble hop character. The taste is of caramel, with a nice hint of ginger, and more caramel. The mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer that I will certainly have again."
"Bham UK"
"Overall: sickly sweet. Interesting colour and aroma but not my style."
"D- warms well, alcohol never overpowering, fine and relaxing sipping brew, not mind blowing but worth a try."
"D - This is an all around winner. An outstanding sipping beer that could serve in place of a single malt after dinner by the fire. This was served in a pint glass, but I should have asked for a snifter. This will be a wintertime staple in my cellar."
"A nice sipper and quite enjoyable, but more than one in a sitting is not an option. Any fan of Eisbocks should seek this one out."
"An enjoyable dessert, this beer. It'd probably be even more enjoyable on a fall or winter's night, but it's hitting the spot on an August night in hot eastern Wshington just the same."
"D: The flavor certainly makes it worth another, but the alcohol content and the thickness make multiples difficult. This is one heck of a sipper though."
"Drinkability - I think I've found a beer style I'm not overly very fond of. I've had the Aventinus as well and my responses were very similar."
"D - This really is like a fine sherry or port. It would probably be best served after a meal, not with one. Good taste but very powerful."
"This is a nice sipping brew that is much easier to drink than the abv level would usually have it to be."
"Cellared for two years. Pours a brilliantly clear shade of tawny amber with bronze highlights. Soapy, off-white two and a half finger head showing respectable retention for a fortified beverage, but leaves no lacing. The nose is heavy with Apricot brandy, dark crystal malt, and deeply toasted notes like Special B or Aromatic malt. A background aroma of cider gets stronger as it warms, as does the faintest trace of perfumey noble hops. Immense caramel and roasted nutty flavor on the first sip; sweet isn't quite a sufficient definition. Raisin phenols and apple ester add more depth to the malt profile, while a mellow yet firm hop bitterness begins to round out the formidable sweetness. True balance is achived in the aftertaste, when a dark fruity booze character provides the slow burn that gradually dries the residual sugar. Full-chewy body with a fine carbonation that seems intentionally light to emphasize the malt complexity and thick mouthfeel. This is a sipper and not intended for hurried consumption, and it also never becomes cloying or overwhelming; the alcohol is warm but not hot and the malt is tremendous -but fades out allowing a very managable finish. Certainly worth the wait as this is simply too abrasive when young, and could perhaps benefit from another year in the cellar."
"EKU 28 pours a brilliant crystal clear orange with a light wispy head. Aroma is malts, some light fruitiness, maybe even some sweet orange aroma. Flavor is rich and sweet tons or sweet caramel taste. The beer has a soft fruit flavor with almost no hops to speak of. It is very clean, and well balanced. The alcohol is not hidden, but not too bad for 11%."
"Reddish pour with an ample off white/light beige head. Not long lasting and not much lace. Malt predominates in the aroma lightly spicy. Flavor starts out with some not real pleasant fusel notes, but these disappear as the beer warms to a good drinking temperature. Flavors are sweet, mildly spicy with a bit of caramel. Kind of like a toned-down Samichlaus. Alcohol ends up being well disguised in the beer. Not extremely complex but tasty and at the price(2.12 a bottle) quite drinkable."
"a nice beer. would not have assumed it was 11% if not for the label."
"Hope the street people don't find out about this beer lol. Pours a nice dark gold with decent head. The nose is all malt and a alcohol haze that serves as a warning. The first taste is malty big and hot with each sip coming easier with a decided smoothness considering the ABV. Compared to Giraffe, Faxe strong etc this is a well made beer that is pretty darn strong. I like that it comes in a can ( catch up beer lol)"
"Big malty/toffee aroma you pretty much only get from a true German bock brew. Very, VERY nice! Actually, there's also a strong fruitiness which you don't get all that often in a German lager. Even so, it's a ""clean"" fruitiness so you know it's still a lager. Beautiful amber color with a slight head, but one that seems to stick around. After pouring it into a glass, the appearance and aroma of this brew just make me want to immediately take a sip! Carbonation is decent and appropriate for the style, but some previous bottles have been too low. Flavor is a malt assault on the tongue combined with some heat from the alcohol. The flavor improves on the aroma with a huge malty/toffee explosion on the tongue. I get ripe fruits...perhaps some apple, but even more I'm getting some beautiful ripe pear flavors. Have you ever forked over the money to buy some Harry and David's Royal Riviera pears? They're expensive, but ohhh so good...nature's candy! Anyway, I definitely get some of that great, ripe, Oregon pear character in this brew. When I first tasted this beer ten years ago, I wasn't crazy about it. Now, it's one of my (occasional) favorites. It's not something I would drink often, but I love to keep some on hand for the times when I'm in the mood...and it seems to hold up incredibly well in my fridge for long periods of time. There's no denying EKU 28 is a malty brew...even for German standards, yet it still has a nice, clean-fermented lager taste. Even though the malt character is strong, I don't think this brew goes too far with its maltiness. Take Vetter 33 on tap in Heidelberg for comparison. Vetter 33 is too over-the-top malty, and has way too much of an unfermented malt-syrup taste. EKU 28 on the other hand, is much more drinkable and thoroughly fermented. I really enjoy this brew, but I can imagine that some don't because it's a bit extreme. EKU 28 has definitely become a brew I've come to love over the years. If you disagree that's okay, that just leaves more for me!"

"Drinkability: Definitely the lightest beer of this strength I've ever had. Remarkably drinkable, almost like a cross between a barleywine and a bock. Very nice, this one was a pleasant surprise."
"Drinkability - I'd have it again but would be interested in laying a bottle down for five years or so to see what happens."
"Overall, recommended. Want something to drink by the fire? This is it."
"Notes: Yowser! This stuff is pretty strong! Despite that, I didn't feel much of a kick after having all 11.2 ounces. This stuff gave me goosebumps the farther I got along with it."
"D - Overall this will kick your butt if you have more then one. It really did come off as a bit too strong. Maybe tone down the alcohol and puff up the hops and it could be a fine frink. Maybe I let one sit down for some months, though I don't know how it will age. This is very intresting and a definate sipper, a good one to try."
"There is a big malt flavor up front, with caramel, dark fruits, and a raisin quality to it. There is a very slight hop balance, but the finish is very alcoholic and warming. This is in no way a bad thing, in fact it is quite a pleasant sensation. It's almost more akin to a brandy or port wine. Mouthfeel is clean, but a bit thin. Even at 11%, this beer remains fairly drinkable. Overall this is one powerful beer that is meant to be a sipper. Highly recommended."
"Pours a deep honey with some rather active carbonation in the body, a thin head that eventually turns into a thin ring, and some lace clinging to the sides. Lot of hot alcohol in the nose with some sweet honey and bready malts. Smells kind of worty. The alcohol along with some light fruits hit the palate first. Bread, honey, and pears continue on into the finish, which has an almost medicinal quality, but it doesn't go too far. Mouthfeel is thick, slick, and with a soft and mellow carbonation. With the high alcohol, this one is a sipper."
"Having this bottle at home, but I'm sure they have it at Bodega downtown La Crosse, too. Poured with a big, thick, foamy, luscious light tan head and some lace. Most head disappeared except for a thin cover. Nose was intensely malty, caramel, toffee, and bitter yeast. This is just out of my cold fridge and it's great; I know it'll be better as it warms. Still, the flavor is very good! Like the aroma but better. Great body. Very mouthfilling with just the right carbonation. Having it with a bowl of spicy congee. Good match. Nice finish that is yeast bitter at first fading to the above sweet flavors. Very rich, not a session beer; but one or two is fine."
"I alwasy thought the EKU stuff looked rather curious, so I picked up a bottle without any clue that it was an Eisbock. It poured surprisingly light orange color, with pretty much no head. This is certainly the lightest shaded version of the style I have seen (though I have not seen many). Smell was very boozy and fruity...apples seem definitely there. Taste was on the malty side, with viscous honey, raisins, and more booze. This beer seems to explode when it swishes around the palate, bursting with flavor in every way. It is a bit carbonated, not not too much. While this is a drinkable beer for sure, it is also pretty strong and heavy. One or two bottles at a time seems appropriate to me. Final Thoughts: A nice beer for sure. Maybe not the best Eisbock I have had, but still enjoyable. I would like to see how it is on tap."
"I can have this occasionally but it depends on the time and place. This may be a good one to finish the night with."
"Not very drinkable for me. If I want a lot of dark fruit boozy flavors IÂ’ll probably go the Baltic porter route. This is a nice beer but it just doesnÂ’t stand up to the eisbocks IÂ’m used to drinking from New Glarus, Capital, The Dane, and Aventinus."
"I've decided to pour this into my La Moneuse glass, being bereft of a snifter at this time. The beer puts up a short-lived head that fades in less than ten seconds to a thin glass ring. The body has a beautiful color, though: it's a transparent ruby-copper. The nose is full of brown sugar, dark bread, and the scent of pecan pie, which may very well be the first time I've said this about a beer. Very interesting. The taste is a near-cloying, caramel and light brown sugar experience. I honestly don't think there's more to it than that, but it tastes wonderful, in very small sips. The mouth might be one of the thickest I've ever come across, with almost non-existent carbonation. But really, I can't see a ""combat"" beer like this having any bubbles to lighten the load, it just wouldn't feel right. If I could have this with pecan pie, or a hefty chocolate dish, or creme brulee, or... Well, suffice it to say, this is a great one."
"D-I wanted to pour it out after first sip. Simply too damn sweet. If you want a much, much better example of Eisbock, get a Kulmbacher Eisbock."
"Something worth cellaring for a year, maybe two."
"It poured with little to no head. It had a sweet malt aroma, and a pleasant malt/bourbon/caramel/spice flavor. Not bad, but not as complex/nuanced as I was led by the label description to expect. Mouthfeel was full and slightly puckery. This beer is not extremely drinkable, but I don't think its supposed to be!"
"Nice beer."
"D: Good beer to enjoy after a long day, very well balanced, but the alc % keeps you from having a few."
"Pours a very nice bright copper colour, with a correct head that fades quickly, leaving some lace that fades too in a couple of minutes. Smell is of dark fruits and brandy or port, with hints of vanilla, almonds and cherries, and caramel too. Taste is sweet, very strong, caramel. Vanilla and cherries are noticed too, with a slightly bitter touch in the end. This is really a very fine beer, but if you have tried Samichlaus before... it pales in comparison. Then again, any other beer do."
"I won't rule this beer out in the future, especially on a windy day where that alcohol bite will be appreciated, but for right now, this beer did not leave as favorable impression as I'd hoped."
"NOTES* I paired this with a christmas mince pie. the sweetness of the mince pie accentuated the fresh bready malts more, taking away the syrupy feel, which made it all the more enjoyable"
"Thick, syrupy mouthfeel and light carbonation. High ABV along with thick alcohol and incredibly sweet malts kind of hinder the drinkability. Nonetheless, I'd recommend this to anyone who thinks they can handle it."
"Notes: This is a tremendous sipping beer. I must have savored this for an hour, with half the time spent enjoying its incredible bouquet. Very good beer for coming in out of the cold."
"The flavor was very sweet but mellow, like caramel or molasses there was a bit of tartness as well, like tart apples. Lots of alcohol and some smokiness in the finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy somewhat thick and syrupy, and very good."
"my first eisbock. Not what I expected, but a pleasant surprise. I'll have to explore more this winter."
"Very malty and bocklike but not as heavy of an alcohol faceslap as anticipated after the initial whiff. Actually, considering the abv, this is actually quite downable. Mouthfeel is mellow and holds the flavor well without punishing the drinker with carbonation. This style is by no means my speed but this is a good effort from the boys at Kulmbacher."
"This oneÂ’s intense and really sweet, arguably too sweet for me."
"Look, I'm not an expert, and I don't pretend to be, but THIS is the beer to drink! Get one ASAP!"
"Cheers!"
"Can courtesy of Piscator34: Poured a deep burgundy color beer with a small off-white foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of sweet cookie dough with some dry plums was very interesting and enjoyable. Some sweet cookie malt with some plums and dry figs characteristics, which made this very enjoyable, also dominated taste. Body is a bit light and alcohol was not overly pronounced. Not exactly sure why this is getting such low ratings Â– I though it was a well craft eisbock."
"A transparent amber with a slight reddish hue, and no head whatsoever. The nose has lots of alcohol, sherry, raisin, fig, and cherry, but alcohol is dominant here. You get a lot of that and more when you taste it, prune, raisin, anise, brandy, cloves, malt, mollasses, and something that tastes like good n' plenties. Not just anise or licorice, bu really like a good n' plenty. This has some light effervescence, and is otherwise a hard drinking beer. Too much alcohol makes this a sipping monster, hard to enjoy this like a regular beer. Even for the style it's a bit much, and I much prefer the Aventinus eisbock."
"Slightly dark colour, malt aroma. Bit of crowning white head. Little bitterness.I found this more malty drinkable than the Austrian eisbocks, although still an egg yolk taste in it. Surprisingly high alcohol content that was well hidden.Thanks Biegaman."
"Not totally bad, a very small glass might would be nice to sip after dinner, but 12 ounces are about 9 ounces too many."
"Drinkability- The overwhelming taste of alcohol meant I would not want more than one of these in sitting."
"A brandy/cognac appearence. Beautiful but no head. Glowing and transparent. Sweet, sweet nectar liquere aroma of malt. Wowza! Heavy, thick, viscous mouthfeel. Well maintained, not much booze comes through. Flavour short of anythign ecstatic but mouthfeel is impressive. Light caramel toffee, but not assertive on the palette. A fantastic appertif. Barley-wine even? A little more assertive on hops could do it good but that isn't the German style I know (we can leave that to the Americans!) Slight stickyness to the finish, but distant. 11% I had no idea! A little too thin in the mouthfeel compartment. Grows more 'syropy' but still a magnificent makeup. Candy malt! Slightly one-dimensional. A winner - but I'm not entirely impressed because I know this could be more..."
"This started out promising, but was reallly not very good. Poured to a brownish red, with medium tan head and had an aroma of malty dark fruit. Unfortunately, the head dissipated almost immediately, and left zero lacing. In addition, as beer warmed, the 11% alcohol became the overwhelming aroma and taste, so that by the end, I felt like I was drinking some cheap rock-gut or moonshine. Not impressed with EKU 28."
"My first Eisbock and I have to agree with the last reviewer, a very good beer and not something I can drink more than 1 or 2 in a sitting. Almost a maple/brown sugar flavor, very heavy and slightly sweet. Not much head, fairly bubbly. Almost similar to an Old ale, but not nearly as rough and bitter. More sweet than harsh. Very oily on the palate. A nice offering but not something to drink that often."
"D: Due to its strength and body, it'd be tough to have more than one or two of these in one sitting. However, that doesn't stop it from being a very good beer. It's a great beer to sip on a cold night. I'll be buying several; some to drink now and some to cellar and taste through the years."
"33cl bottle: This one pours a fairly clear amber color, with a fair amount of off-white head. That drops off quickly to leave a glass with no lacing. The aroma is a bit sweet. Mainly notes of caramel and raisins to the nose. Possibly some other fruits and a bit brown-sugary also. There is a flatness to the taste: the carbonation is already gone. The taste is a bit of caramel malts and some dark fruits. Maybe a hint of oakiness in there also. Not bad."
"Drinkability: Overall a very nice beer that would be good on an occasional basis, but be careful with this one. Although Eisbocks are not my favorite style of beer, I would probably buy again in the future."
"Drinkability- Strong, sweet and fabulous. Still new to the world of Eisbocks. Not quite as flavorful as Aventinus, but very good nonetheless. A bit strong to have more than one though. Winter after dinner drink. One is just right."
"A little low in carbonation but a nice thick taste appropriate for 11% alcohol. Leaves the taste nicely on the lips."
"Â¡Salud!"
"D: Terrific flavor and smell, to be enjoyed in moderation. High alcohol level (Germany's ""strongest beer""?!?!) and complex flavors make this one to be savored with dinner or dessert. I had mine with a dinner of a bacon & blue cheese burger and fries; they went quite well together."
"EKU 28 needs a more exciting name. It could also use a better look, but then I don't care too much about that with beer of this sort. I'm enjoying it more and more as I delve into the final third of the bottle and am enjoying the warmth that is spreading from my stomach outward, despite the heat of the day. I'll have to buy another few bottles for those inevitable subzero Iowa winters."
"Overall a nice sipping beer. Not one I'd have more than a couple in a sitting."
"Poured almost amber in color with a thin white head. No lacing. Nose is full of strawberries, caramel and a tad bit of grapefruit. Taste is largely the same, with pleasant bitterness in the tail end. Mouth is carbonated with some of the tiniest bubbles I've come across. I can see myself buying this again for sure."
"Â¡Salud!"
"Powerful stuff for sure, yet not overly so. Still, a bottle or two and you'll be done. Numbs the old noggin..."
"Taste; this very sweet, and that graininess comes through in the taste, but not quite as strongly as in the smell. Vanilla, cherries and caramel malts all come through as well, and there's also an almost oak barrel flavor going on. Mouthfeel is nice and full, but it's a bit on the syrupy side for me, and with the alcohol so strong it's definitely a sipper."
"This pours a clear amber with a large head for a high alcohol beer. The smell is strong with vanilla, sweet malt, dark fruit, and alcohol. The taste is sweet with vanilla, malt ,fruit, and some oak aging. This has a borban flavor to it that's just great. The m/f is heavy with all the flavors mixing well. This is the best eisbock I've had. Excellant."
"Drinkable? yes but not one that is gonna be a session beer LOL. Just a nice after dinner cold weather dessert beer, which I found I liked."
"The eisbock is medium-heavy on the palate, somewhat syrupy, with a gentle level of carbonation that's fitting for this slow-drinking beer. Finish is dry with a moderate alcohol burn. This eisbock is not as fruity or caramel/malt heavy as the other eisbocks I've had and enjoyed more have been; I think this is the major aspect that the beer could be improved upon."
"Orange body with no head. Smells of rich fruity malt, alcohol isn't apparent but you know its going to be big. More dark fruit malts with licorice. No hops flavor, all malt here. Very smooth drinking and tasty. Feels like at first, but you'll know what you're drinking after the first few sips. Interesting beer, makes me think German Old Ale. Give it a try if you live for malty beers."
"After its release from 330ml brown bottle, it sets in the glass an orange-gold color with a modest bright white heat that is semi-creamy texture, the lace is a fine coating upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and crisp, start is sweet, the grain profile decent, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish has a determined in its acidity, the hops pleasant, the aftertaste dry and a touch of alcohol bitterness from the 11 percent ABV and also some noticeable tummy warming, a drinkable beer, but not something I drink on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: Not a fan of the flavor nor the persistent aftertaste. The alcohol is quite apparent, and limits consumption. A completely new experience in beer for me, but not one I'm necessarily looking to repeat."
"So, how does one score an 11% beer? In this case, quite easily. Have you tried any other expensive heavy beers? This really makes a point that cost does not need to be high to get some very luxurious qualities from a beer. Essentially, EKU 28 is not only ""one of the strongest beers in the world"" and a ""world classic"" but it's an easy drinking concoction. It's smooth, sticky and heavy like a port, but not quite so heavy as Schamiclaus (15%) or other super heavy weight beers. It smells rich and goes down without any unpleasent bite or after taste. An affordable night cap ($10/6-pack) or a good value for the ABV alone. Not as complex as the super heavy weights, but fills a gap mssing in the 6-pack motif. In some ways, this is about as drinkable as a portly beer can be, meaning that you'll be tempted to grab another as you are not totally exhausted by the first."
"D - low due to the syrupyness, but decent, again a great apertif, would go great with pie a la mode"
"With 11% ABV, this is clearly an occasional sipping beer. Not one to drink in multiples, but a fine indulgence every now and then."
"D - Very high, this beer is a delight to drink, the real only drawback is the 11% ABV and reason it keeps me from drinking more."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer which is why it can be dangerous. I nearly put myself in a coma drinking this at a German beerfest one year. ItÂ’s addictive."
"Not my favorite style, but a decent beer nevertheless."
"Musings: Another kick=ass eisbock. A great cold weather brew because it is highly warming. Not as consistent and stable from a malt standpoint as the Aventinus, but still a worthwhile find."
"Poured into an EKU glass a deep copper to light amber color with 2 fingers of light tan head over top that is maintained by a solid cascade of bubbles from the bottom. Very good clarity as well. Nose is pretty big and bold on this. Very syrupy sweet raisin to fig fruityness sits over a light puff of alcohol and light candied fruit sweetness as well, lending more to that syrupy or processed sugary sweetness. I like it. Flavor is not quite as bold as the nose, but still very full. The dark fruity notes are dominant, with fig coming through the strongest. There is a nice toastyness to it after swallowing, followed by just a hint of alcohol, but not burn. Not something I could drink too much of, but I enjoy it. Feel on this brew is beyond thick...I don't even think syrupy is enough to describe it. No real carbonation is detectable to break that incredible thickness up. Its too much for me in the mouthfeel. Drinkability is just okay as well, but this is not a beer to be pounded. Its enjoyable, but a once in a while treat."
"mouthfeel is very thick, surypy, good."
"Perfect nightcapper material. I enjoyed this more as it warmed a bit....If I get really beer geeked out I'd reccommend this around 55 degrees or thereabouts. Pick up a sixer next time you see it."
"pour amber with light tan head some lacing. aroma malt,fruity and alcohol.mouth feel was slick .had a vanilla alcohol taste. did not care for this one. at the time I had this I thought the alcohol was a little too much for me. I will rerate this a a later date but for now did not care for this"
"This is a body-warming beer for sipping and enjoying, and would be an excellent companion while weathering a winter storm."
"Drinkability - I would drink more then 1 in a session if given the opportunity, but its a potent beer at 11% abv. Overall I really enjoyed this beer, moreso then I thought I would."
"A little sweet and sticky for my taste but If you like BIG beers give this a try."
"Taste is unbelievably heady with sweet malts, cherry, caramel, pleasantly alcoholic. Normally this might be a bit sweet for me, but the flavours feel so well balanced I can overlook that. Feels so heavy and thick in the mouth, creamy but not soft, great carbonation. If this wasn't so high in ABV, I could drink a few of these tonight. This is one classy beer, and if this is indicative of the style, bring more of these on!"
"Eh, the other eisbock by Kulmbacher is better. This, to me, was a bit more toned down on the taste/smell catagory. It's just not as pungent as the other. Sure, the alcohol is friggin' strong as crap, which is cool, but it just overpowered the taste too much. It'll definately keep you warm on those cold winter days, but other than that, it's not that great."
"330 mL bottle with some code on the back - served lightly chilled in a snifter. It pours a clear rusty/bronze color with a 1 finger tan head that leaves some lacing, but recedes to nothing by the end. The aromas are sweet fruit, caramel, toasted malts, raisins/dark fruits?, a hint of alcohol, and a lot of dried banana. I passed it to my sister and after sniffing the first word she said was ""banana."" It has a body that is thick and smooth and banana is also the dominant flavor - almost like banana nut bread. But it's shadowed by a sweetness, spices?, chocolate?, and a mild bitterness, which all meld nicely. Not terribly complex, but it's pretty good and I could have put away another one fairly easily."
"[I had another bottle of this when I was in Heidelburg, and wasn't as impressed... so I averaged my scores]."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation could be a bit lower...either way, this is a sipper and perfect for this time of year. This one warms you up nicely and lets you know to respect the abv. Another solid offering from Kulmbacher."
"Sorry my review isn't as specific as it could be. Didnt take great mental notes while drinking. However, the fact remains, at least on tap this one is nasty. Stay away."
"D- One is plenty due to the strong flavors and very apparent alcoholic content. Savored the complexity for almost an hour"
"Selection from beer-of-the-month club. Shared with fellow BA mtanji. Poured a deep ruby red liquid with sparse white head that quickly dissapeared. Smell is very heavy malt fruitiness with figs, gates, cherries, prunes and just about any dark fruit you can think of present. Distinct alcohol presence (as would be expected). Taste is sweet and syrupy, with a coat-the-mouth feeling. Malt completely takes over with an over-ripe dark fruit. Alcohol is there, but is well hidden, which increases the drinkability of this beer. Definitely a slow sipping beer, because as it warms, the flavors become more intense. Would make an great after dinner drink."
"Lemme try this one again sometime from the bottle. Maybe I'll have more positive things to say."
"later"
"A very interesting, hard to define, selection. Looking for something different ... this is it! One of the most unique beers I've sampled to date."
"Pours a beautiful golden color with nice carbonation, the head fades quickly, no lacing at all. Scents of sweet fruit, malt. Nice sweet taste with a bit of alcohol behind it, finishes dry and sweet. Medium body. Very drinkable, sweet, but not to sweet, alcohol is hidden pretty well at 11% ABV, would recommend."
"-UF"
"Pours a clear, deep amber with copper hues and a thin off-white head that dissapates almost immediately, typical strong lager appearance. Aroma is intensely sweet with caramel, brown sugar and molasses scents, as well as some toffee and a light floral and mineraly hops accent plus a nice alcohol punch. Flavor is similar with a cloying sweetness that distracts from other characteristics, with notes of honey, molasses and caramel and some toasted bread, floral and mineraly hops, some oaky and vanilla flavors, some slight fruity esters and a moderate alcohol burn in the finish. Extremely sweet and one dimensional, but interesting nonetheless, more like a carbonated liquor than a beer but thats ok. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, with moderate carbonation and a sweet finish with a big alcohol punch."
"I donÂ’t think I could drink too many of these, as it runs a bit too sweet for my tastes, though the toasted graininess is very kind. Surprised to see no yeasts in the bottle."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"D- This has good complexity for a high alcohol lager. The dried fruit and dark malt could be a bit more complex. It is very smooth and it doesn't taste like an 11% ABV but the malts add a nice balance to what alcohol you do taste."
"Drank at the local German bar. The locals thought I was crazy for ordering it. Briliantly clear copper-orange color with golden highlights thrown in. Low carbonation and lacing, but nice legging on the glass. Smells sharply sweet, alcoholic, and estery. Flavors are sweetly malty and fruity. Not a lot of different flavors, but the ones that are present are very powerful. Pruits of peaches and apricots. Syrup and caramel flavors share the remaining characters. Low on spices, hops, and robustness. Smooth and silky to the mouth. Full and round. Alcohol warming in the finish. Just slight of becoming cloying and dry. A good beer, If you like them sweet."
"Not bad, but too sweet for me. The high abv % and sweetness would make this an ideal apertif beer. Not a beer that I could drink more than one."
"The initials E K U indicate in German the First United Brewery of Kulmbach which was once labled as the ""strongest beer in the world"" with an OG of 28 (in German degrees). EKU 28 pours crystal-clear, orange-amber with a brief white head that leaves some lace. Aromas of malt and alcohol. Flavor is rich, slightly toasty and caramel-kissed (likely from the decoction of Munich malts ) and remind one of fine dopplebocks like Celebrator. The full body and almost syrupy mouthfeel are balanced by its fine bubbled carbonation, high ABV and buried hops. Flavors are fairly complex and evolve with warming."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer! It is really clean with a lot of flavor. Rich Melanoidins and caramel malts really give this beer backbone. I believe that this beer will really age well, and would be accentuated by the esters gained with age."
"This one is a beautiful bright bronze color, but it lacks head retention and contains almost no visible carbonation at all. The nose is of sweet caramel malts. Very caramelly, very malty. The taste is slick and smooth, heavy on the liquid caramel, finishing with something a little sour. This one is incredibly oily and slick.  The label says 11% abv, but I would have never guessed it to be more than 7 or 8."
"c"
"Overall, this eisbock was a little too unbalanced for me and it had aged for 9 months. I much prefer Kulmbacher Eisbock and Aventinus to this one."
"11.2 ounce bottle. $2.50 at Lee & Edwards in Roanoke, VA. Code date 1318615 (whatever that means). This had probably been in the fridge two years."
"They boast that it can stand in for shery. That's pretty bold, but what I can say that this stuff is good. Color is almost burgandy and pouring it into a glass produces a little head which hung around for a bit. The taste of malt along with the spices pleasures your mouth, making mouthfeel and taste very good and unique. Drinkability is good too, even though this stuff is 11% strong, because while you drink you enjoy it's unique taste."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet sweet and malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It seems rich and warm. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth and rich, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm on the way down. It has a very sweet crystal malt flavor with little hop characteristics present. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn tastey brew. It has excellent malt character and drinkability."
"On tap at the Collins bar in NYC. This strong brew pours a glowing/shimmering shade of dark leather. Clear, with an off white minimal head, well developed and thick/frothy lacing. Nose is buttery malt and alcohol, sweet alcohol. This is a pleasingly bracing beer. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is quite evident. Notes of juniper, smoke, more butter and alcohol. Warming, heady stuff, cant say the 11% is ""well hidden"" but for the strong livered, this is a fine sipper"
"EKU 28 is dark caramel copper in color with a quickly disappearing head. The overall strength of the aroma is very intense. Character of the aroma is of rich dark fruits and rich bready malts. No alcohol smell is noted. The taste is also very rich. Dark fruity tastes and intense dark malt flavor come together to create an interesting concoction. A slight alcohol taste is noted throughout. The finish is probably the sweetest part of the sip, which is interesting because it is also where the fruity tastes are most prominent. This brew is so rich and alcoholic that drinkability suffers some, but one or two in an evening sounds great."
"I would suggest, and I personally do, pair this with a Highland Park 18 Y.O. (single malt)"
"A tasty cousin of barleywine, this can fill a similiar role, a late nightcap with some stinky cheese, mmm. Call it Malt Liqueur."
"A fellow brewclub member had me try this at a festival over the weekend. Pours an amber color with a small head and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly sweet with a very strong caramel malt character. I like the heavy malt thing. The flavor is much the same. Lots of great malty goodness with a caramel character. Also some slight fruity notes and a kick of alcohol. The alcohol takes away from the drinkability a bit, but not too much. Thick body makes it very enjoyable."
"Note: if you do drink this beer on tap - let it sit a minute...a slightly warm EKU 28 is a happy EKU 28."
"EKU's rich, very subtly toasty, just caramel-kissed, and honey-sweet malt warms to fill the mouth with a lush wash of stickiness that's peppered by alcohol and spicy hops just as its fine-bubbled carbonation breaks on the tongue with a light zest. It's surprisingly drinkable given its full body and high alcohol content. And although the alcohol is noticeable, it helps to thin the malt sweetness, ultimately helping the beer more than it hinders it. Unfortunately, it does limit the head retention, and it's short cap of white quickly dissipates above its crystal-clear, orange-amber body. The nose is not particularly complex, revealing its rich maltiness and a waft of alcohol, but its flavor becomes a bit more complex as it warms with notes of vanilla and almonds as well as some floral hoppiness in addition to its concentrated Munich-malt-like graininess. At the very least, it's quite unique among beers and deserves a try."
"The appearance was a clear amber color with little to no head. The smell was somewhat malty with a hint of vanilla or something. Tasted almost like a spiced Puerto Rican rum for some odd reason. Like I said, it was extremely smooth for as high of an alcohol content as it has. I would highly recommend it."
"World Class. Share this with a good friend or two."
"Drinkability and Overall: The of style of this beer is very unique. I've never quite had anything that was comparable to this. There are some downsides to it, mainly the strong alcohol taste makes it hard to drink a few of. Other than that, phenomenal. Definitly a sipping beer, and one that has to be tried."
"11.2 oz bottle. Clear reddish golden liquid. Thin white head that disappeared very quickly. Lots of bubbles coming from the bottom. Smells like someone is baking wheat bread. Big bready malt flavors here. Very sweet. Slight hop bitterness at the end, but not much in comparison to the malt. Warming and thick like syrup. Seemed to be pretty well carbonated. Sipping beer, with a wonderful aroma."
"This brew is a clear dark-orange colored drink, with a small white head that fades quickly. Scent has some caramel, fruit, and alcohol elements. Big alcohol taste, some cherry, other fruit, caramel malt. Tastes remniscent of a booze. Sticky mouth. This brew has some zip."
"The pour is orange gold like a Belgian Trippel, but does not possess the signature foamy head of that style. The carbonation is lively and fizzy, but not a head to be seen anywhere. The aroma is perfumey alcohol with a floral hop hint. The taste is sweet and spicy with up front alcohol and an assertive hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is very drying with a strong burn at the back of the throat. Nice and drinkable beer, but lacks the roasty complexity of a good dopplebock, or the subtle hidden punch packed by a Belgian Trippel."
"for dessert, not something to drink everyday."
"Dark carmel color, with excellent head retention for a brew this strong. Smell is sharp with alcohol and a little bit of cereal malts. Flavor is off the wall with alcohol. This is definitely a warming sipper of a beer, which feels a little off in air conditioning. I had to edit my review, because this was a little bit off to me at first, but by about halfway through the glass, it was very good."
"An intense Eisenbock probably too much for most but those that seek this stuff out know to expect a powerful brew. Based on that I give a high Drinkability score."
"Mmm...this is a good brew...Appearance is average...medium gold with no head. Smell is a beautiful bouquet of fruity scents which are rich and invite you to drink more. Taste is mallty, fruity and lets you know it has an alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is thick as expected, but rich in feel. For an 11 abv, this is very drinkable, but remember to sip! Highly recommended."
"Overall, somewhat cloying, that, coupled with the thick body, kept this beer from going down smoothly."
"Has a clean slightly dark orange color with a small light brown head which dissapears quickly. A fruity yeasty aroma mixes with a strong alcohol presence. The flavor was fruity with a hint of cherry followed by a strong alcohol warmth and finishes with a light nutty (hazelnut) touch at the back of your tongue. This lager has barlywine like characteristics ..a: Little or no carbonation, which also leaves you with no head....b: A very serious alcohol presence. This one is for sipping Not gulping. It says on the bottle ""the one whenever something good and strong is needed. It certainly lives up to that billing."
"I love this Eisbock style, I only wish more American brewers would give it a chance. Lots of malty sweetness here with flavors of caramel, estery fruityness, oak, licorice, and toffee. Slight cherry tartness offsets the sweetness for about a second but it doesn't really do much. The most noticeable flavor is the fussel alcohol that comes through in the finish. It's strong but I like it! The sweetness meshes well with the alcohol. Give me another!"
"The head disappeared immediately; the body is like strawberry syrup: transparent and red, with a few bubbles inthe middle, which reminded me of a vulcano. The smell is ok, hard to describe, maybe fruity with some caramel. The first impression in the taste is good, sweet and fruity, but then the alcool comes, and it's kind of nasty. It tastes like Martini, with the same plain bitterness, and also like some fruit liquors. Too strong. The mouthfeel is winy, and boring. I didn't finish my glass."
"Light bodied yet carmelly sweet like a barley wine this beer is surprisingly drinkable yet high in alcohol. Smooth flavor but little else to comment on, no off flavors just smooth and sweet."
"Everything has its purpose, and this beer's is to deliver thick, well-conceived malt sweetness to those who crave it. Now, that means just what it says, but if that's your goal, then this beer will rise to the occasion. It's not about balance, but then, it never pretends to be. The high-octane ABV will put a serious hurt on one's unguarded sobriety, and fast, so it's not something you'd want to lose track of, in spite of how nicely warming it is. But if you're in the mood for what this offers, it'll give you the malted fix you're looking for."
"A smoky sweetness envelops the mouth at first, followed by a tropical fruit sweetness that lingers into a finish that gives just the hint of hops. Alcohol is masked nicely, and beer is very smooth."
"Pours a clear reddish orange hue under a two finger off white head that settles fairly quickly, producing an amazingly loud popping bubbles sound. The head has some body at first, but produces no lace. When cold, the nose is very, very subdued, but it blossoms incredibly as the beer warms, resulting in a strong caramel and maple syrup scent. The mouth is very prickly and quite heavy. The taste is sweet caramel, and lots of it, with a barley background and significant alcohol. There's no hoppy bitterness at all, with the bite coming completely from the alcohol. The aftertaste is sweet, like supercharged candy. This is an interesting brew, but it would be in my regular repertoire."
"Incidentally, Michael Jackson calls this a strong lager/double bock."
"Pale to medium amber color. Head is small. Smell is of strong alcohol, like wine. Taste follows the high abv of 11%, strong alchohol. At first, I took large tastes, but realized it is better sipped, given the fruity, wine flavor. I finished the bottle, but don't think I will be buying another. This was my first try at a really strong ale and I think I will stick to others."
"Drinkability: Ummm, I'm almost curious to see what might happen. This beer is serious. It's as if no attempt is made to cover the large ABV in this beer. I like that, and it adds to the character, but in all honesty, I couldn't have another even if I wanted to. This would be the best nightcap ever if you could find a chap willing to split it with you. It's a bruiser for sure."
"Sampled 12/20/03"
" A very interesting Eisbock, with a superior and highly complex taste. Low drinkability, as this is much more like a liquore than a beer. Ideal for sipping in front of the fireplace on a cold, winter night, out of a brandy snifter."
"Pours an orange amber with a miniscule head that quickly settles. Smells of strong sweetness and alcohol. Mohogany caramel with prune notes, and kindof an oakey quality. In my opinion, taste is overbearing on the sweetness. Enjoyable, but somewhat like very alcoholic candy. Bitterness takes its roll only in the aftertaste, and dies out, submitting to the alcoholic sweetness. A good brew, but definitely a desert beer, and should be expected as such."
"the bar tender told me up front there was no returns and not to puke in the bar lol...i finished off the whole stein and was ready for more. definitely a beer to try if you have the chance. the high abv. is hidden pretty well and it makes this a enjoyable beer."
"This beer pours a clear pretty deep gold color. The head is almost non-existant but shows a tan color when roused from the glass. The aroma is dominated by strong malt, the thick malt overwhelms everything. Feels quite thick on the tongue. Surprisingly, given the body, it is not really all that sweet. This is a thick chewy malty brew. The malt character is the show here though. Having said that, this beer is lacking a bit; it is missing some of the malt complexity of a good strong lager. This is a nice clean lager. It is almost syrupy in consistency. In the end a bit dissapointing, needs a bit more character to be really worth drinking."
"I love this beer and would drink cases of it if I could. I doubt I could afford such a habit. I will definitely try this beer again. I can't wait to sample more of this style."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel and alcohol attacks the tongue. The thick malt sticks to your tongue for a while after swallowing. Hard time finsihing one of these, not very drinkable unless you like a very sweet and alcohol laced brew."
"Drinkability Â– Well, if you donÂ’t like the style than you wonÂ’t like this bottle. But, if you can appreciate the high alcohol and incredible smoothness that results from icing a bock beer, this is one of the better offerings."
"EKU 28. This is an excellent dark reddish/brownish colour with a lovely white head of foam that dies quickly. The aromas are of sweet heavily alcoholic malts and slight hops on the finish and the taste is quite boozy, malty, and a bit hoppy on the end. The mouthfeel is a bit cloying as it is *so* thick and creamy. The drinkability is excellent as well, even for an 11%abv beer!"
"Drinkability - Interesting, but I would never bother drinking it again."
"Pours a paler copper color with virtually no head, whatever, just remnants of a thin white head. Smells of strong grain, some lingering smokiness, peatiness and fruitiness; like a ripe banana injected with grain alcohol swimming in rum-raisin. Sipping (and I recommend sipping) this beer reveals a big alcohol punch (almost whiskey or scotch-ish), with some husky cerealness backing it up and not so much hops. Mouthfeel is thick and luxurious, a heavy bodied beer with all the bells and whistles that suggest so. Quite enjoyable. Could never drink these back to back unless I was on a plane carrying it going down in the polar or antarctic regions of the globe..."
"I'd take two, but no more."
"The light amber color of this beer belies its potency. The coffee colored head is nothing exceptional. But, beginning with the aroma this beer takes off. The aroma is fruity and citrusy with traces of figs, apples, toffee, and alcohol. It has a complex mouthfeel that is thick, syrupy, and oily. The taste is malty sweet with alcohol, toffee and figs with just a little bitterness. The finish is sweet and a little chewey. Its high alcohol content makes this a good cold night beer to relax around the house with."
"Wow. One at a time, this is a fantastic beer, about as strong and warming as you can get; there's just not much chance of getting through more than that. If someone tells you that lagers are lightweight and for pansies, then by all means hand them a bottle of this! A fantastic beer, and one I'd likely have again, especially in a warming situation."
"Potent biscuit malt aroma. Thick cream colored head Glowing light amber brown beer with lots of little floaties. Sweet butterscotch and malty flavor, a bit like a malt ball. The body is slick and sweet. I would expect an eisbock to be a little lighter in the body, but what do I know. Not a big fan of the flavor or the way it coats your tongue. Not horrible, just not up my alley."
"Pours a clear brilliant red, with a medium tan head that quickly diminishes to a small ring, lace is non-existent. Aroma is mainly alcohol, somewhat whiskey-like, some maple syrup, slightly buttery. Flavor is cloying sweetness colbbered by over the top alcohol. This basically reminded me of alcoholic syrup or something, not all that enjoyable."
"Appearance: Copper amber with a thin bubbly head cream in color not much lacing the alcohol prettty much kills everything here. Aroma: Strong alcohol layered with sugary syupy and mild plum brandy notes, this is definitely kicked up a few notches in the alcohol department. If AB only knew how to make an ice beer. Taste: Is basically like sipping down some liquor, doesn't burn but the alcohol flavor is so rich and complex with the sugar malts this beer is crazy. Wow, this is a beer I will bring to my next cold football game I go to damn it's very warming going down the alcohol doesn't even try to hide itself here it's in your face competely. Mouthfeel: Medium to full with syrupy like texture wow. Drinkability: Becareful not a beer to be chugged or drank fast take your time let it warm up along the way what a beer another brew acquired from beergeek279 gracias."
"Really attractive orangish, reddish amber color. Not much of a head, but a thin collar hangs around. Very sweet alcoholic fruity nose. Not bad at all, just really sweet. I like it! The first sip reveals a very strong alcohol presence. A bit of a medicinal note in there as well. Alcohol warms the esophagus as you swallow. Residual sweetness is pretty high on this one. A slight hint of bitterness slips in after a few sips, but it is dissolved by the alcohol. I think this needs to age for a few years. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. This is almost like a Marzen or maibock diluted with spirits. Definitely not for the weak. Now the question is, how long will it take to finish this one? Not a bad beer, but nowhere near a session brew. You WILL know this is a high ABV offering. And you will most likely enjoy it. Slowly."
"When I poured this beer I was very excited for my first sip. It pours a beautiful deep orange color with a medium sized head that held shape for no time at all. After noticing the 11% abv on the label I knew that the first sip could tell me a lot about the beer...here goes nothing...PURE ALCOHOL! Just like the label on the back of the bottle says ""treated like a fine port," this was a different taste for an Eisbock. As it warmed up I began to enjoy it much. The flavors began to come out and weaken the alcohol taste. Overall, lets just say one bottle of this will hold me over for the next couple of decades."
"The finish is outrageously long and perfectly balanced as little surges of bitter nuts, caramel and smoke emerge for minutes after."
"Pours with a decent head. The head goes away quickly. Nose is rum, malt and tart apples. Alchohol is also present in the nose. Taste is fruity heavy and alchoholic. There is a decent amount of malt also. Leaves the tongue coated. Very warm as you drink it. This is an enjoyable beer on a cold night"
"EKU pours with a deep orange-amber color and a medium sized slightly yellow hued head. Looks quite a bit like many IPAs, but certainly cannot be mistaken for one. The head recedes quickly to almost nothing but a very small smattering of a lace on the surface. There is a very small amount of carbonation seen flowing from the bottom. The aroma is of rich sweet malts, lots of dark fruits (plum and raisin), a small amount of alcohol, and some notes of rum. The mouthfeel is quite thick, almost syrupy. Somewhat smooth start, but it doesnÂ’t take long for the feel of the alcohol to tear through the palate. Very warming on itÂ’s way down, and doesnÂ’t take long at all to feel this one in the blood stream. Quite sweet and, at times, I felt that it was almost cloying, with notes of plum and rum raisins. The finish has a slight bitterness that picks up a bit and lingers for a moment. I definitely couldnÂ’t drink more then one of these. ItÂ’s a good sipping beer though. Reminds me of a barley wine, yet at the same time Samichlaus Bier also comes to mind."
"Still, it was nice to bump into him again."
"Overall it's really a great beer. You can deffinatly taste the 11% alcohol in this beer, but it's very easy drinking. Perfectly balanced malt, earth and citrus. This is a beer I'll be having again."
"Poured with a nice deep ruby color, and a very thin yellow head. The aroma was very fruity, with notes of peach and citrus. Pleasant, but if it was much stronger it would be reminiscent of cough syrup. But the taste was quite good, a nice well-rounded fruity, maltiness, almost like a sweet sherry, but retaining enough beer character to keep it interesting. Full, substantial mouthfeel. Like a sherry, it's very pleasant, but not something you'll want large amounts of"
"Good body and mouthfeel for a high gravity beer, a bit attacking at first, this beer takes a second to get used to like many an after dinner drink. No doubt warming in the belly and the body."
"Medium orange-gold color, medium head. A medium bodied beer. Malty and slightly sweet. Taste is more like a sherry or port than a beer, but EKU 28 retains its beer character. Nice hop bite. Big bold beer. Mouthfeel is full and expansive. Finish is clean and smooth. Noticeable alcohol bite (11%). Aftertaste is malty and slightly sweet. Slight oily texture to this beer. A bit overpowering."
"""as good as a brandy"" says the label. The drunk gent on the label is more like it. A darkish brown color. First sip is sugary malt and a big bite of alcohol. No hiding it here. You get used to it as you drink on, but it is quite annoying. Slightly above average taste, because the beer says what it is, and it is all that. Will get your eyes rolling in your head. Brown bag it."
"i'll be brief on this one because this is an experience that will be very different from person to person and the bottle temp is as important as its age in evaluating this beer. if you like big beer this is the circus fat lady of big drink it slow and share it with a friend. also this is a good beer to lay down and enjoy aged. malt, malt, malt!!"
"This is malt defined. Don't even think barleywine! This is big lager. I am drinking this ICE COLD!!!!!!!! It is one of the few beers I nearly freeze. Seriously, it has a huge malt profile which can withstand the abuse of massive refrigeration. It is worthy of note. Try it ""ultra"" cold. This is not a beer to discuss. DRINK THE BEER!!!!!"
"No more Sugar Daddies for me. pat"
"After tasting this beer I had to check again to make sure it was really from Germany. Could they possibly make this sweet nectar in adherence to the Reinheitsgebot? This beer is absolutely unique among all the German beers I have ever tasted. In fact, this beer is quite unique among all of the beers I have ever tasted. The full effect and flavor can be gathered from a very small sip, just as with a straight bourbon or scotch, making it a perfect beer for slowly sipping. I can only begin to imagine the myriad ways in which this could be paired with food, though it is wonderfully suited to standing alone as well. This may just become standard stock for me, to aid in converting friends who drink wine or liquor but ""don't like beer"". Prost!"
"This eisbock poured a clear, golden-amber color with thin, white foam that settled quickly, but clung to the insides of the glass a bit. The smell was malty but modest. The taste was sweet and malty but a bit harsh. There was a hint of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was sweet but also a bit harsh. The body was full, with moderate carbonation. The drinkability was OK, but the harshness and high alcohol content make this less drinkable for me."
"I took one sip of this beer and I had only one comment to make about this beer to my BF and that was ""yuck this tastes like medicine""!! When this beer was poured, it poured an off-white head with fine sized bubbles. The body was clear and the hue was amber. The nose was fruity."
"A unique beer well worth the ride...I'd love to have about a case of these in the cellar for desert beers for the year....24 for the year would be about right...."
"Yikes. So a beer really can be too strong. Who knew. Pours a bright orange/amber with virtually no head. Aroma is strong malt and alcohol. Medium-bodied an very syrupy. Kind of tastes like a cross between a barley wine and malt liquor. Finish is syrupy sweet malt and caramel. This beer is definitely strong enough for me to be feeling the effects after one bottle. You definitely have to sip this one, but unfortunately this beer is not really good enough to be worth that much trouble."
"Nice lively pour with a white/off white head of fine bubbles. It has an clear amber body with a fruity aroma. Initial taste was not one that I preferred. It had an acrid flavor with carbonated bubbles rising off my tongue. My feelings are that I don't much care for this brew."
"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into an EKU 28 snifter. It pours a ruby red color with no haze. There is one finger of head that dies right away. No lacing is left on the glass. The smell has a big alcohol aroma with some citrus, maybe orange, in the background. The taste is overwhelming with alcohol, with little hints of cherry and hops in there. This beer doesn't even try to mask the alcohol at all. The mouthfeel is a little syrupy. The drinkability is just average due to all the alcohol flavor."
"This beer pours an amber color with very little head that quickly disapears. The malt and alcohol are clearly evident in the aroma. This syrupy beer is sweet...very sweet. I like strong beers (I love Whiskey), but this one tasted stronger than it is. Between the cloying sweetness, and harsh alcohol taste it really lacked drinkability. There are plenty of high octane beers out there that deliver the alcohol in a much less abrasive manner. Not a bad beer, but nothing you will drink much of even if you love it. A little goes a long way."
"Clear copper in color. A thin almost nonexistent white head. Spotty lace is left. The aroma is of deep, rich malt. Very rich smelling. A little caramel as well. Love the richness of the aroma (in case you couldn't tell). When you take the first sip of this one, you can tell it's got some character. The alcohol is noteable from the start with this one. The flavor gets extremely close to cloying. But it never is. The thick, rich malt is the main player. I liken the richness of this beer to the richness of boiled shrimp. It's very appealing, but if you take in a lot, you're going to pay for it later. Some dulled apple tones come in here and there. There's also a little whiskey barrel oakiness to it. A big full body teeters on syrupy. It's all almost too much. ALMOST. I haven't had a lot of Eisbocks, but this is pretty damn good."
"A dark copper color with a thin head and virtually no lace. The malt and alcohol aroma is less than expected. The full, thick malt is quite sweet with flavors of honey and cloves. The strong alcohol packs a punch and practically buries the hops, though bitter citrus can be detected. I recently tasted Austrian Winter specialty, Samichlaus at 14% abv and this EKU 28 at 11% abv seems much stronger. Go figure."
"Pours out to an amber color with a quickly, fading head. Aroma is that of malt, predominatly and is somewhat sweet to the smell. The alcohol is not hidden very well in this beer and tends to detract from what could be a very good assortment of fruit on the palate. Finish is strong. Not a very drinkable beer, but one to sipped. Average."
"Pours a reddish amber, and strains to put forth any head on the beer at all before giving up. Smell is malty, almost a hint of raisin, and a prominent alcohol nose. Taste is malt, brandy-like flavors, and alcohol. It really reminds me of a distilled beverage my father brought back from Bosnia as far as the fruit character. Mouthfeel is very sharp and warming. Definitely a nightcap or digestif - absolutely not a session beer."
"Holy cow, this stuff knocks you off your feet, thats if your standing. Color of this is a solid copper with a small off-white head. The aroma is very alcoholic and deep fruityness like a flavored vodka or something. It has some cherry and sugary caramel dark maltyness to it thats just heavenly. Then the taste, watch it now, it says ""hi"" very quickly. You say hello back by going, ""Whew, wow, holy smokes thats strong!"" You sip again and the dark fruit and maltyness just settles with very nice tones of caramel, cherry, toffee and other fruits of ripeness lingering around in there. Super complex, inviting, subtle and strong, I'm sorry,did I already say it was strong. The feel is full, rich and a bit deep, some chewyness and butterness with a that alcohol warmness that makes this a serious sipper. And a good sipper at that."
"Coppery-tawny-auburn hue, lovely off-white head that reached a finger before fading to a soapy residue, no lace. Great nose, potently alcoholic yet very inviting, rummy, caramelized dark fruits too. The first sip is like a punch to the throat. Massively sweet but not cloying, very alcoholic, ripe fruit (plums, raisins, apples), caramel notes, buttery too. Complex palate. The finish has a bitter hint but itÂ’s mainly sweet. The mouthfeel is thick, chewyÂ… full-bodied, syrupy. Little carbonation. This is a sipping beer, savor it, enjoy itÂ… try one."
"WHOA! Nice pour with a full white head. A beautiful beer to look at. Copper colored with a long lasting effervescence. Aroma was, to me, a bit funky sweet like fermenting. It smelled like overripe/rotting oranges. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the aroma was not indicative of the flavor. The taste was malty with spice and some fruit notes, none of which were rotten. The finish was warm but hid the alcohol fairly well."
"Wow what a beautiful beer,poured with a huge head great color.Felt like I needed a cigar and a brandy snifter,alcoholic smell with a slight fruit tinge.Tasted alcohol soon as it hit taste buds,a little syrupy but thats to be expected.Only a little fruity tast was apparent other than alcohol.As it warmed alcohol taste creeped up even more,nice to drink before bed."
"In this brew, it's alcohol you feel, above and beyond any other flavors. They may exist, but they must lay before the master, the booze. A touch of citrus and fruit, but faintly, and,again, subservient to King Liquor. Not exactly THE strongest beer in the world, but one of the tastiest strong brews I've ever enjoyed. Just, be careful. Tread wisely, and enjoy."
"flavor has a nice sweet maltiness, but there is a whole lot of alcohol that hurts this one a little bit. you will pick up a nice smooth caramel taste that tones down the alcohol a little to keep it from getting out of hand. it has a nice warming sensation as you drink it. this beer is full-bodied, full-flavored, and very rich. carbonation is light, and it has a very good feel to it. the alcohol flavor keeps it from being a great drinker, but it is still good."
"Very clear deep amber or copper or whatever you want to call it. I couldnÂ’t put my finger on it, but there was something about the aroma that nudged me the wrong way. It wasnÂ’t the alcohol, malt, or esters, but something else. Some sort of sourness that was unexpected I just didnÂ’t care for much. The first sip almost knocked me out of my chair. What a drink! A huge buttery malt (but I donÂ’t think diacetyl) floods the mouth and was balanced not by hops but by an alcohol/solvent burn. The tongue was left tingling for much of the moderately long salty caramel finish. Hops were minimal at best and kinda go unnoticed, by me at least! Viscosity is pretty high and carbonation in the mouth in tiny since this beers is respectfully sipped. This was a tasty beer and worth the waiting for the store to get it back in."
"Very strange. To see the total lack of head after a couple of minutes, zero lace. I hate to have the rating lowered too much by appearance, because I liked this beer. Pretty easy to drink considering the strength. Quite sweet (I know a sweet beer when my teeth start to hurt!), and I don't think I could have more than two. However, if you're looking to warm up, drink this. I have a little cold tonight, and this works way better than Nyquil!"
"EKU 28: An amazing beer. Amber colored with a hint of ruby red. The aroma is very, very sweet (for a beer), with a strong aroma of tangerine. The initial taste is very strongly alcohol. Extremely thick/creamy mouthfeel. Taste is very sweet, warm flavor, with very prominent tastes of tangerine/and just a wisp of malts. Very nice and dry aftertaste, very clean, not much aftertaste. Very nice."
"I worried a lot about this beer. First let's take the color, which is absolutely gorgeous -- orangeish/red, the most sunset-looking beer I've ever seen. At first I thought it was just pretty. Now that I think about it, though, this is just the color nature tends to paint things when it wants to warn people to *stay away*! Ah well, if the color doesn't get ya, the aroma will. Huge nose of alcohol, which mellows a bit to an aroma of rum soaked raisins with lots of sweet caramel malt underlying. The third warning is the lack of any evident head -- you can just see the carbonation struggling to make its way up through the massive levels of alcohol in this beer. Ok. Time to take the first sip. I absolutely could not believe how creamy and smooth it is! The caramel and alcohol combine together to produce something not entirely unlike a rather nutmeggy, spicy dark cola. Dr. Pepper for grown-ups. Alcohol and malt dominate the main body as well, with some nice fruity, orange-like esters developing. Then the beer finishes off with a nice combination of peppery spiciness and understated hop bitterness. Finish is sweet, but just barely. Not nearly as cloying as it could have been. This beer handles its alchol *very* well, and provided it is shown the proper respect, is quite a nice bed-time beer."
"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a bubbly off white head that left circular lace. An aroma of malt and caramel. A powerful taste of malt and caramel and strong presence of both in the finish. The alcohol comes through as an after affect of the finsh. Nice flavor, but definately a sipper style, even if it does come in a six pack."
"color of a red leaf off a maple tree in fall.  The smell of cherry fruit is strong along with alchohol, that puts you on your ass.  the tasste of haops and malt are almost non-existent because of the over power strength of this brew but it is very tasty.  It is almost like leaving a twizzler in a bucket of vodka for months then try to eat it.  I am very pleased with this purchase it should last me quite a while."
"This is one quality sipping brew. A big cheers to VENOM for the sample."
"Clear reddish copper hue w/ brilliant clarity from the ample lagering.  The head settles quickly into a thin spotty ring due to the high alcohol.  Sparse bubbles rise slowly through the apparently viscous brew.  Sugar coated nuts and caramelized sweetness upfront in aroma, toasty malt and fruity melanoidins follow and grow progressively more intense as the brew breathes and warms.  Smells like a ballsy hellesbock, with alcohol notes milder that the strength would indicate.  Although the flavor profile is assertively sweet overall, it is not one dimensionally so.  Rich, non - diacetyl buttery malt is the foundation for toasty, nutty and perhaps decocted Munich malt, which complement crystal and residual sweetness to lend a toffeeish character.  Mellow, yet bright fruitiness combine with the sweetness to form a red licorice note.  The body is deceivingly light while the mouthfeel is viscous and a bit syrupy, yet not cloying.  Hop bitterness is virtually absent.  Finishes expectedly sweet; brown sugar like sweetness coats the tongue.  EKU 28 struck me as cloyingly sweet at first, but it became increasingly complex as it breathed.  It's a fine dessert beer that would pair well with simply rich vanilla or coffee ice cream."
"Light amber in color with a very small, short-lived head.  Smell is all about alcohol.  The beer is very syrupy and sweet.  Very little carbonation.  Tastes something like a dopplebock, but the beer is very one-dimentional.  Not bad, but overrated."
"I gauged the head retention to be that way knowing it would be like that so I was not too disappointed, the aroma is simply amazing and the flavour crushed my palate for the rest of the night. As for the alcohol, this is a night cap brew. Iâ€™ll save the other bottle to have around the winter holidays."
"Nighty Night!"
"Notes: This is a beer to be sipped, savoured and respected. For the style, it's also very well balanced and perhaps one of the best eisbocks I've ever tasted. Powerful. Complex. Balanced. Tasty. Hell yeah!"
"Some initially pleasant oak and malts flavours are soon overwhelmed by a revolting alcoholic syrupy sweetness, making it almost impossible to finish a bottle. The eisbock style is not something I'll sample again - unless it's for free."
"Pours a very bright orange / copper color which looks very nice, head fizzes out very fast though. On the nose is fruit, rich malts and the scent of 11% abv. canÂ’t be missed. Same on the palate rich malts, fruitiness, raisins, slight citrus notes, and tiny caramel notes also. A bit sticky in the mouth feel, and that 11% abv.  slightly heats the throat and warms the gut. A little much alcohol, but a good sipping brew. I wouldnÂ’t recommend more then one at a time. Holy cow...my throat is numb..."
"Some classify this brew as an ""Eisbock"" (6/14/02 now, it is, style categories changed at this site)...poured it in a Pilsner glass, pretty dark amber, but clear.  Head is just a spidery trace after 20 seconds.  Raisiny, clovey, sweet aromas, hints of alcohol.  Prune, cinnamon, and sugar flavors, a coating mouthfeel in the extreme.  Alcohol has most kick on the swallow.  Lots of spice and subtle flavor alterations.  The brew is just too sticky for me, just saved from cloying by some slight citrus hints.  Heavy duty stuff, I'll take it over a sherry, but wouldn't call it drinkable in quantity unless you have the next day off."

"Big sweet pale malt aroma.  Medium body.  Alcohol flavor is not quite warming and takes a back seat to the malt flavor.  Some weird hints of green apples."
"i know everyone has given this good comments, but this beer just wasn't for me, reminded me to much of thick cough syrup, maybe i'll have to try it again."
