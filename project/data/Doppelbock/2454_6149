3.78,8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 2/3/2012. Pours fairly clear dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass; with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, raisin, prune, toast, toffee, chocolate, molasses, floral, dark bread, light roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt notes with yeast fruitiness; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, dark bread, raisin, prune, toffee, molasses, chocolate, roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, molasses, dark bread, raisin, prune, roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt flavors with a light-moderate fruitiness; with nice robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good doppelbock! Nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

Aroma held roasted malts and chocolate hints, taste went the same way with some coffee in the back ground as well. With a medium mouthfeel it goes well with dinner as it drinks like a food course, rich and full flavored for sure. Overall a nice brew and I would try others from this brand, if you like Stouts and Porters you'll enjoy this for what it is.","Bear1964","May 29, 2013"

And right there the awesomeness ends. The nose, especially as it warms is malt and alcohol. At 6.25%, the odor of alcohol just shouldn't be present. Taste is more like a porter with some roasted nut notes and malt. The finish is a sort of burnt coffee flavor. Mouthfeel is sort of thin, but there is a decent amount of carbonation. I wouldn't refuse one of these, but neither would I search one out.","Mojo","May 24, 2013"

Only the second cask lager I've ever seen (Foothills Torch Pilsner being the other, passed over for the other two firkins offered that night) and the first I've had. The beer is a nice murkey brown with a decent frothy khaki head that diminishes to a thin layer that leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is a decent amount of brown malts and slight cocoa. The taste is a wonderfully smooth amount of brown malts with cocoa accentuating everything very nicely, especially in the finish. The beer is quite light and smooth. This one certainly benefits from the cask offering, very enjoyable. I'd love to see more Doppelbocks on cask.","atsprings","May 26, 2009"

It served as a stand-alone dessert after a great meal, but would pair nicely with good chocolate and ice cream, for certain. It would also be a winner with anything blackened (catfish, even). Not too sweet, not too bitter, a good balance. Definite coffee notes abound. A nice, oily finish stands out in my memory.","drperm","Sep 06, 2007"
