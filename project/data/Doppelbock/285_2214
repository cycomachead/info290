Some grape like sweetness. A bit of sweet chocolate comes forward shyly as it warms. The fruit on the nose is a mere grapey sweetness. Light and bright. Taste is heavenly delight. Rich sweet malt unfolds on the palate. Light chocolate, clean tastes and a grape like sweetness that includes a bit of sweet raisin type depth. Toasty but nothing burnt.

3.8,6.1,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"A "pale doppelbock" described as the cognac of the beer world on the label. It is indeed pale, a bright sparkly lemon drop yellow with around three inches of white foam. Aroma is intensely sweet and bready, with ample lager yeast character and green grape must. Palate does indeed evoke cognac a little but is of course much sweeter. Tastes of golden cake with icing, apples, a poppy seed nuttiness, and dried plums, esters and phenols abound with a pervasive mustiness that recalls white wine. Hops provide some additional fruit notes like gooseberry and some bitterness to the finish, which is more crisp, dry, and spicy than the initial sweetness would suggest. Boozy like many Belgian tripels and some of the other flavors go down this path as well, although this lager beer is much sweeter than the more attenuated Belgian ale. I like darker flavors in this style but this is worth sampling.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 14, 2013"

Lingering notes of light fruits, toast, biscuit, caramel, toffee, nuttiness, earth, herbal, and phenolic fruitiness. Some good balance of flavors but the phenolic character throws it off a bit; definitely smoother tasting with tiny sips. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming noticed after the finish.

The aroma is very enticing and chock full of fruits: apples, white grapes, apricots, peaches, dried banana, and hints of candy corn. Pretty similar on the palate, with the addition of oranges, melon?, late green/grassy hops, and a light dosing of alcohol. Not as sweet as I would have thought based on the bouquet (but this is a good thing), and the fairly smooth, tingly and dry, medium body supplies a nice base.

Overall, the aroma seems just too fruity for the style, but again, this is on the lighter color and perhaps it's more appropriate. On the palate it is incredibly rich and sweet. It reminds me more of Samiclaus than any other doppelbock. There is a little toasted flavor, but it just isn't like any other doppel. Carbonation is very low providing a very thick, viscous mouthfeel. This beer is what I would call close to a white port, though I haven't drank one. Alcohol is quite apparent but not overbearing.

There's a hint of drying spice underneath everything, and a slight hop presence that comes out only at higher temperatures. On the palate, things start out with a touch of overdone sweetness, then hop bitterness and then an astringent spiciness that leaves a bitter aftertaste at the finish. Mouthfeel is zippy and light. Overall, I'll say about this exactly what I say about Samichlaus: it ain't a doppelbock, first of all.

Overall the aroma is clean and sweet. Mouthfeel reveals a smooth, slightly oily and sticky texture with a pleasant,fine carbonation. Flavor profile starts out quite sweet and fruity with notes of honey, pear, green apple, caramel candy and a Grape-Nut cereal maltiness. This initial sweetness is quickly interupted by a moderately hot alcohol blast followed immediately by a somewhat surprising hefty hop bitterness.

Throw in some freshly mown grass and orange peel and you've got it down. Tastes... Hugely overpowering something... Raisiny alcohol and sweet malts - maybe a touch of lighter caramel in that. Coupled with the very thick mouth, this is so thick in your mouth in sweetness and malts that I just can't finish my glass. It's like a beer that you'd serve with dessert - and each guest would get a 2 oz glass of it. It's that strong in flavor!

The beer exhibited a grainy and floral bouquet, which was a little too clean. The alcohol was also evident in the nose, but not overwhelmingly so. The taste was not very bock like, but closer to a light bodied sweet lager with spices like pepper and vanilla, resembling quite a lot of strong pale ales from Belgian abbeys. The warmth of the alcohol was present as a potent reminder of the careful sipping this beer demanded. The yeast imparted a dusty dryness and an earthy bitterness, both of which are rather uncommon is a German style lager. As I got deeper into the glass, the beer seemed to become sweeter, and perfumey. The beer was not too thick on the palette, but had enough malt body to keep it from being too adjuncty.

It pours a nice golden color with a head that sticks around for about 10 seconds before retreating to the walls of the glass. Not too impressive. Smell consists of very sweet malts and faint faint notes of alcohol. Taste is a malt lovers paradise. Very sweet toffee-ish malts lead into traces of alcohol on the tongue. It definately warms as it is going down. A dry alcohol taste remains on the tongue for several minutes after swallowing.

The flavors of this beer were primarily in the domain of hops and not malt as the flavor began with a sharp German hop bitterness followed by a sweet light malt and high alcohol followed by a lingering hop bitterness.

Aroma is interesting, and deserves high marks. Sweet toffee and caramel quickly transition into molasses, with fruit esters similar to fried apples. Mouthfeel has minimal carbonation, and some hop and alcohol bite. Taste begins with some bready yeastiness, but is soon dominated by a malty, molasses backbone. Several dark fruity flavors linger in the background, but don't fully emerge as they should. Some hoppy bitterness is always around to keep things interesting. Finishes with a caramel aftertaste that is immediately followed by a biiter, herbal hoppiness. This is a very tasty and complex brew, that is a departure from Bavarian doppelbocks due to a unique hops presence. Very enjoyable and pleasantly drinkable.","merlin48","Beers"

While it is not all that potent it is inviting. Warming spicy alcohol caramel-apples, distant maltiness... pepper... sharp fruitiness... all construct the marvelous palate; sweet at times, more peppery at others, borderline cloying but the hot alcohol cuts off that notion quickly. Wow, this is not a typical dopplebock by any stretch of the imagination. It is like a Belgium-influenced dopplebock. Weird? Yes but very tasty, complex and intriguing.

Taste was lightly creamy, with notes of lemon, orange, and grapefruit - like a fruit cocktail of these. They merge/create (?) a very moderate and calm bitterness, balancing with the very fine malt in the background, a malt that was not great or characterful but there. Finish was moderate, tasting like a mish-mashed blend of the palette, while it does becomes grassy and a bit oily. Had some whiskey malt notes that only come out toward the end of the finish. Smooth, full, and silent mouthfeel, so good you dont notice because it fits the overall character of the beer perfectly. Intensely drinkable, goes down so easy.

The mouth is prickly, but also heavy with sweet and alcohol. The taste is sweet and fruity, yet the alcohol makes its presence known. The hops lurk in the background at first, then come out as the sweetness fades and the alcohol attempts to take over. The battle is finally won by the warm, soothing, sweet alcohol with the raisin and apple tones. Definitely a winter warmer, this goes down well in Moscow in early September.

4.2,17.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Another good beer from Eggenberg. I'm looking forward to the Samichlaus again this winter, but for now this has to be my favorite. I'd definitely have another one of these.","beergeek279","Aug 12, 2003"
4.27,19.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours a sound gold tone with a nice sized creamy white head very solid looking brew, but I was anticipating a ruby tint to it for some reason. Trickles of small spots of scattered lacing not bad decent overall, but this golden appearance is just a front. For this beer packs quite a punch in the aroma and flavor, for starters deep syrupy sweet tones surround the nose with jet streams of alcohol wavering in the air. Definite fruit soaked in alcohol slightly caramelized reminds me of some moonshine I once tried from Kentucky in the aroma with a splash of honey to it, this one's complex and appetising. Start with small sips this one needs some adjusting to just like toeing your way into a cold pool, but once you just dive in it's all worth it. Flavor consists of one malty backbone with pan seared over ripened fruits drizzled in honey and a touch of banana flavored rum sprinkled to kick it up a notch wow this is great as alcohol sears the back of the throat doesn't scorch enough to cause discomfort just let's you know the alcohols in there. Some beers the taste of alcohol being apparent detracts from teh overall taste in this particular brew it only enhances the experience. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a sticky chewy texture very nice. The final chapter in this beer as far as drinkability goes is wield the power wisely becareful with this one at 9.6 it warms you up don't make it a challenge to indulge but enjoy this one. A quite enjoyable slow sipper that qualifies on my list of winter warmers to keep in mind this winter.","WVbeergeek","Jun 23, 2003"
3.2,-10.6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"This beer pours a dark amber color with almost no head and little lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly fruit and alcohol - mostly alcohol. The flavor reminds me of a wine with an oak character. Very thick. Sweet maltiness and alcohol are the first things noticed in the flavor. Drinkability suffers from the alcohol. Not one of my favorites.","clvand0","Jun 11, 2003"
2.63,-26.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,2,"Poured a amber/bronze, much lighter in color than I expected for a doppelbock. Flavor is dominated by a bittersweet, syrupy malt that coats the tongue. Alcohol is quite evident in the flavor profile, adding a pepper that tries to cut through the blanket of sweetness, but fails to make a substantial dent. Heavy and unwieldy.","Brent","Jun 04, 2003"
4.12,15.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,3,"A delightfully creamy and sweet beer. Reminds me of a Sauternes wine, or perhaps a Tokay. Marvelous.","Darkale","Mar 07, 2003"
3.27,-8.7,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,2,"Fruity alcoholic aftertaste, like a medium-bodied semisweet wine. The low drinkability lowers what would be a reasonably good beverage. If I didn't know better, I'd think I was drinking malt liquor. Potent stuff campers.","brewdlyhooked13","Feb 14, 2003"
2.28,-36.3,3,2.5,2,3,2,"Not a good beer in my opinion, the barley taste is just too much for me.. :(","Rocko","Feb 04, 2003"
3.8,6.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a crystal clear golden yellow; the head modest in size, frothy in texture, off white in color and it dissipates quickly leaving a silky sheet of lace to caress the glass. A touch of yeast lots of malt, fresh and clean is the nose. Big malt start that is also sweet, the top middling in its feel to the palate, finish is delectable in the hop arena, the carbonation purposeful, the aftertaste droughty, and a fine beer to be sure and well worth a sample.","Gusler","Jan 21, 2003"

3.61,0.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Any head this beer had went away very soon after I finished pouring. The liquid itself was beautiful. It was a perfect golden color with not a bit of haze or anything to make it look less than regal. Malty bock aroma but with a good sized dose of spicy hops which were quite a surprise. Caramel and malt flavors were tasted without surprise, and the beer was very warming on the way down. The only thing I didnt like was a very short-lived fusel alcohol taste after each sip. It was quite a distraction. It was kind of medicinal and very unpleasant. Ill have to try this beer again to make sure I didnt get a bad one.","yen157","Nov 20, 2002"
3.8,6.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Crystal clear and golden in color, with very little carbonation and no head at all. The aroma is sugary sweet, with a bit of raisiny fruitiness. The flavor too, starts off quite sugary -- almost granular. Big malt body with more fruit notes and noticeable alcohol warming. Hops are purely supportive but contribute to a dryish finish. Medium-bodied,creamy and somewhat coating, but not excessively so. Decent beer, but a bit one-dimensional in terms of flavor.","mzwolinski","Aug 28, 2002"
4.1,14.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Slightly hazy cinnamon orange/brown, lighter than I expected. Small head that doesn't last more than 30 seconds. Very simple lacing on the glass. Deep buttery toffee flavors, similar to "Cracker Jacks" caramel. Medium bodied, a little sense of coating but not like a Samichlaus. Slight sense of peach and a prickly bit of noticeable hops. Alcohol acts as a counterbalance to the sweetness, comes on mid-mouth and in the aftertaste. Interesting, starts subtle and sweet and gains body toward the end. A few bottles are left at the liquor store and they're coming home with me for those special, friggin' freezing Minnesota evenings.","ADR","Aug 02, 2002"
4.15,15.9,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Crystal clear golden in hue, topped by head that readily dissipates into a glass coating ring.  Most closely resembles a hellebock in appearance.  The aroma is a combination of nutty, toasty Munich malt and buttery toffee, w/ a hint of a floral Mittelfruh hop nose.  Oddly, as the brew warms and breathes, there is no change in the aroma at all.  Completely static aromawise. Sugary sweetness hits the palate initially, then yields to a malt profile comprised of honey drenched toasty grain.  An unexpected snap of moderate hop bitterness emerges mid palate, immediately offsetting and almost sharply contrasting the previously sweet malt profile.  Deceivingly light in body, w/ an agreeable and slightly slick mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ a resurgence of sweetness lingering, lending an overall sweet impression to this brew.  Alcohol warmth creeps in slowly and coats the throat after a long deliberation.  Urbock 23 is truly a unique and enjoyable beer... A doppelhellesbock?","marc77","Jul 15, 2002"
4,11.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Strong slightly floral and slightly sweet aroma, kind of sticky sweet start, which quickly fades to a dryish bitter finish, very warming brew, also a bit of a whiskeyish character, lots of body and flavour, i liked this stuff.","rastaman","Jun 10, 2002"
3.36,-6.1,3,4.5,3,3,3,"First thing I picked up on the nose is lemons. A little spicy yeast and a sweet smell. The color is clear but lackluster, it seemed dull. Not a lot of head and and very little retention. Flavor mildly malty, the tiniest bit of hop bitterness and a good dose of alcohol. Seemed a little thin.","aracauna","Beers"

3.6,0.6,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Interesting is rightPours a crystal clear, shiny gold color, I could smell the alcohol aroma a bit, as well as malts. On the palate, there is tiny alcohol bite, but really comes of spicy or peppery, but this brew sure does give a warming sensation all the way throughQuite interesting for a DBIn the finish (Venom nailed it) tastes like whisky a bitOverall very interesting DBthe extreme warming in the pit of the stomach is awesome...","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 19, 2002"
3.92,9.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Anyhoo, Urbock 23° has the basic aroma and flavor of a doppel.  It has a nice sweet and malty nose, with a bit of spice (I saw vanilla listed on another review, but I'm not sure that's what I picked up) to it.  The flavor is rich with molasses-like flavors and a bit of balancing hops.  This is one of those brews that had an obvious alcohol presence in it's warmth in the mouthfeel and continues to warm as I drank.  However, I didn't notice any alcohol in the aroma or taste.  I thought that was a bit odd, but certainly not unpleasant.","Viking","Mar 17, 2002"
2.42,-32.4,4.5,2.5,2,3.5,2,"Clear golden color.  A bit of skunk on the nose.  A bit of an off flavor.  Slightly skunky.  Tastes a bit  like many European beers that I've had in bottles.  Has that "European" skunk to me.  Not very good.  I'm surprised a bit because I really enjoyed their samichlaus bier.","Bighuge","Beers"

You'd never guess it...sweet and slick with little hopping...a bit sweet for some but a good blond doppel in my book..a nice flowery hop profile would do wonders for this beer..could use some additional hopping but still very good as is..","ZAP","0"
