"Good beer, minus the vinegar notes. Moral of the story...Didn't age well. My score will be the current average, to avoid skewing the average because of the beer's age."

"O - the closest American made doppelbock to the original German versions I've ever had. I didn't see this brew in 2013, and I hope it's not completely gone. Very underrated and under appreciated doppelbock. GLBC make a lot of great ales, but I don't think any American brewery does lagers like they do. Lagers are forgotten in today's beer universe, but I'm telling you right now, this as is all GLBC lagers some of the best on the planet. If this is released again grab it and try it. It's a top notch doppelbock."

"O - Rockin' but a little too hoppy for my taste concerning doppelbocks. Warm, lingering alcohol booze isn't infectious but nicely done for a good spring beer."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The Doppelrock pretty much met my expectations. A very malty brew that has a lot of great flavors but is not mind-blowing. Just a good beer. Would I drink it again? Sure, I'd want to try it fresh."

"O- doppelbocks are a malt lovers dream, and this one was quite enjoyable, but very sweet."
""

""

"Overall - yet another damn delicious offering from Great Lakes, my favorite brewery on God's green earth!"

"When i poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice dark rich cola colored body with a small tan head that layed down quickly to a nice thin lace. The smell is of rich dark fruit and roasted malt. The taste follows the smell but with much richer flavor of the dark fruit and some chocolate notes on the back of the tonuge. The mouth feel is very nice, creamy and smooth. Overall this is a really good beer by Great Lakes."
"This one has a real pleasant fragrance to it. Flavor is heartier and a bit more robust than I would have imagined. Fruit tones seem reminiscent of something on the tip of my mind but far away from my tongue. (translated: I can't figure out what fruit this reminds me of) I usually can't stand bocks or doppelbocks, but this one is nice. It's always cool to be able to try a style that you don't really care for, yet are still able to aprpeciate it."

"O - overall this is a pretty darn good dopplebock, not as boozy as some I've had recently. I could definitely pick this up again and at four dollars a four pack, I think I will"
""

"O: A very good dopplebock. Every time I have this style of beer I'm pleasantly surprised. I think I'm too hop-forward with my beer styles lately. This one is a keeper."
""
"I had high hopes for this beer because it’s from Great Lakes. If you’ve ever had a Great Lakes beer, then you know what I’m talking about. I would say that it didn’t exceed them. It somewhat match my expectations. Overall, it’s a very good dry roasted Doppelbock. It won't knock your socks off."
""
"Overall: Not the best in the style but certainly one worth trying if you can find it."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a big, rich lager with some nice dark toasty and bready characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dense full flavor is quite satisfying, though not as complex as the best examples of the style. Excellent none-the-less."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 5/29/2012. Pours very cloudy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice thick cap that lasts. Some decent soapy lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of raisin, caramel, prune, molasses, biscuit, toasted malt, nuttiness, chocolate, pepper, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, bread, toasted malt, honey, chocolate, earth, nuttiness, and light herbal spiciness. Big malt flavors on the finish with some spiciness; with lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, molasses, biscuit, chocolate, and toast on the finish for a bit. Flavors were not as robust as I was hoping for, but were still extremely balanced with good complexity. No cloying sweetness at all; with a slightly dry finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel which is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Very easy to sip on. Overall this is a really nice doppelbock. Nice flavor balance with good complexity; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall - Not really my style of beer.."
""
"Overall – One tasty brew. It has great flavors, a wonderful smell and feel and gives you the perfect warming feeling, making it one to sit back, sip and enjoy."

"Serving type: bottle"
"Long story short, if you see this one- pick it up!"
"Served on tap at Durty Nellies. Appears slightly muddy brown, tan head leaves a small collar and spotty lacing. The nose is rich and malty with waves of caramel sweetness and a touch of roastiness. Some molasses and nut in there as well. The taste starts sweet with a firm malt presence. The sweetness is balanced nicely by toasted malts and a hint of roast. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is somewhat light for style with moderate carbonation. Overall this is a tasty example of the style, I like how the sweetness is kept in check."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"O-Reminds me a bit of a doppelbock/dubbel hybrid but the combination doesn't work. I like the upfront taste but it doesn't end well."
"One of the better doppelbocks I've had. Definitely opts for a more complex malt character over heavy sweetness. Glad I was able to pick a 4-pack up while traveling."
"Great Lakes is a favorite brewery of mine, and again I am reminded why"
"Overall, very solid doppelbock, I love the nose on this beer, pretty complex, the taste was less so and it was a bit drying. this would be a very good beer to try on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Excellent beer and very drinkable."
"O - Skip the chocolate dessert tray and make this your last course of the night. This doppelbock features rich chocolate malts with just the right balance of hops to make them delicious without being heavy or filling. Could easily enjoy several of these over post-dinner conversation without feeling like I've cleaned out a Godiva factory. Another winner from Great Lakes. BTW - while this review is based on tasting from a bottle, I remember the servings I've had both this year and last on tap as being even better. It's one of those beers where the delivery is even better than the anticipation."
"Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied. Really expected it to be a more solidly medium bodied beer. That said, it does roll over the tongue well, even though it is slightly sticky."
"O- not sure how I missed this brew from one of my favorite breweries. I need to grab a four pack asap"
"O: This beer looks and smells phenomenal, and the taste is very good. Solid overall."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): I really enjoy this doppelbock. It really is like liquid bread in a lot of ways, and that’s what I dig about it. I don’t go for all that many malt-centric beers, but this one’s a keeper in my book."
""
"Overall, it is great roasted beer without an overwhelming amount of malt."
"Great Lakes keeps great styles simple. And, usually, that produces some great beers. This one's not exceptional, but near the upper rung among American-made doppelbocks. 4.0"
"Ithaca Coffee Company pours this beer in a pint glass. The beer has a cream colored head with dark copper color. On the nose it is very lite aromas of roasted malt, and chocolate. The first taste is creamy and thick with flavors of roasted malt, & bittersweet chocolate, with a slight bitterness on the finIsh."
"The brew is mildly carbonated, full in body, clean in finish albeit with a sligth alcohol warmth."
"3.5 D: Not bad, but not as good as a typical GL brew."
""
""
"I was a bit disappointed in this. I was hoping for more but it didn't seem to have as much depth or style to it as I wanted. A good beer but there are better doppelbocks out there to try first"
"O- Doppelbock is not one of my more known styles. But of the ones I have had, this is a good example of what the style is. Wonder how it would fare with some age?"
""
""
"Overall, I really like the flavors presented here but I thought the alcohol was a little too noticeable. Otherwise this is a really good, hearty beer."
"Dopplerock pours hazy deep chestnut brown. Retains head well. Bits of (I hope) yeast floating suspended in the glass. Little to no aroma coming from the glass. What little there is smells of roasted nuts. Immediate alcohol taste, this one is a bit stronger than others. Medium-full mouth feel. Not a lot to the initial flavor profile, but the finish is deep, roasted nuts. Tastes more of a nut brown than a bock. Certainly not the favorite bock or dopplebock I’ve ever had. Singlular notes in both the malt bill and hops. Real flavor profile doesn’t appear until the beer has disappeared."
"Pours a deep dark brown with brilliant garnet highlights when held to light. Smells of caramel and burnt sugars with hints of dark fruits and a touch of alcohol. Taste is fairly sweet with a counter of burnt sugars. Some dark fruits come out in the flavor but this one lies heavier towards the melanoid side of things. Medium body and level of carbonation with a sweet burnt sugary slick kind of mouthfeel. Nice beer, perhaps not on the level of some of the German beers of the style, but a nice drinker nonetheless."
""
"Overall: Not one of my favorites, but a good bock and one I could drink again."

"Review from notes. Very much looking forward to trying a Doppelbock from Great Lakes Brewing. Pours a dark amber color with zero head into Great Lakes pint glass. Smells of malt and sweet bread and a bit of fruit that I can't quite place. A nice little bite on the lips in the front end that gives way to a nice rich malty mouthfeel that finishes clean. A nice example of the style and there's a decent bit of carbonation that mixes with the malt to keep it from being too rich, thick or alcohol heavy. Another solid offering from Great Lakes."

"Notes - Despite the good words I put into the taste section of my notes I gave this beer and overall B and I didn't write a lot of words in the review so I guess this was just an OK Doppelbock."

"A very easy drinking doppelbock, with terrific aromas, and a surprisingly ""light"" flavor and mouthfeel. A good gateway into the style."
"Overall, this is a good beer. I got it a while back and has been sitting in my cellar for a while. I don't think a bit of age did any harm to it, if it didn't improve it."
"O: Again, I don't have a lot of experience with the style so I may be overrating this a bit, but I like this a lot. This is a very interesting, complex and enjoyable beer. I'll get it again."
"O: Doppelrock is a damn fine brew. A wonderful display for the style. Light and complex, this one gives you wave after wave of caramel, chocolate, biscuit, and roast goodness, while retaining a lightness and sessionability that Great Lakes seems to have mastered in most of its brews. Enjoy this one!"
"O: Easy drinker, a good winter evening sipper. A solid doppelbock."
"Deep mahogany in color with a light haze while its cold, but clarifys as it warms a bit. Poured with a thick bridge foam that reduced to light wisps and a ring around the top of the glass. Sweet roasted malt and dark fruit aromas, raisins and figs, with a hint of chocolate. Boozy aromas sneak in as it warms up.Smooth, thick and creamy feel. Sweet roasted malts up front with dark fruits and chocalte malt in the middle and an herbal hop bitterness at the finish. Similar to aroma, there's a little booziness at the finish. Finishes with a lingering sweet malty but herbal hop bitterness."
"An agreeably decent doppelbock - well offset by a counterbalancing dryness, and just enough warming to remind one of the imminent summer's end."
"This is a very good doppelbock and an interesting take on the style that I appreciate. Will continue picking this one up."
"O- A unique doppelbock. Drinks rather nicely for the rather apparent alcohol. Definitely worth trying."
"Now I shall have to find a fresh bottle next year when it rolls around to determine a starting point from which it changed."
"Nothing about this beer would discourage me from opening another right after. A nice big sipper if you want, but so easy to drink."
"While this is a good beer, this is not the way I like my dopplebocks. Optimator is one of my favorites because it is so easy drinking and clean, which is what this beer lacks. I would pass on this one."
"The only thing that falls short here is the aroma. Another very good German-styled offering from the folks at GLBC."
"O- A respectable effort by Great Lakes. It's not the best doppelbock you can get, but you could do far worse."
"O: I love bocks! This is a decent one for sure. The booze seems to be creeping up on this one though, it was less apparent a few weeks ago from the same batch."
"Very nice beer, another great offering from GLBC. Highly recommended."
"The Doppelrock is just flat out fantastic, a drinkable delight that holds its own with the best German examples of the style. Highly recommended. I'm going to look for this next time I'm up North."
"O: another great beer from glbc. I should have bought another bottle to age and compare."
"Overall an exceptional doppelbock with an exceptional name. You could drink this all day and you would want to with all of it's exceptional attributes. Not really a summer beer but the welcome splash of flavor among the boring summer beers is a great change of pace."
"O: Pretty good beer, full flavored, drinkable for abv and style."
"Overall: I thought this was a nice representation of the style. The hints of fruit and nuts in the taste were very welcome. I would definitely have another."
"O- great beer, its been a favorite of mine, whenever its in stock i go head and get a few packs. you should as well! cheers"
"Had a Great Lakes Doppelrock over the 4th weekend. The appearance was ok...the color was a ruby red and clear....except for the ""floaties", which had I known there were would be floaties I would not have dumped the whole bottle in my glass. The white was good and color was white. The smell was dominated by sweet malty nose. The taste also was very sweet and malty. There were some peat/smokey undertones and the beer came of the pallete clean. The beer is good, just to sweet for me....could only drink one per sitting."
"Overall – I was really impressed with this beer. The taste is very well balanced and the alcohol was well hidden. I'd definitely buy this beer again."
"D- i might have to put the doppelrock over there with grassroots ale. some tweaking is necessary to take this one from ""meh"" to ""rock solid""."
"O: This beer is moderately good, it has great color and feel but it seems to lack a little bit in smell and is also a little too strong at first"
"A fine example of the style from a trusted brewery. A lot less hoppy, relatively, than imported versions I have had and very sweet."
"Doppelbocks are not my favorite style of beer, but given my overwhelmingly positive experience with Great Lakes, I have this one a whirl and it was terrific. I reviewed the description of this style and, nose notwithstanding, this beer is everything a doppelbock is supposed to be. Highly recommended."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the uniqueness in flavoring. While it upheld all of the classic parameters of the style it presented with some unusual components, specifically in the grain department. Here it deviated away from the sweeter, slightly roasty grain profile to something closer to that of a porter. This gave thorough bitterness, and a deepness of flavoring not found in your average doppelbock."
"O: Decent but needs a little more malt character in the flavor to really reach the top 1 or 2 tiers in this style."
"The Rest: Body is medium, and this beers almost seems green. It's a bit rough around the edges and a year or two in the cellar might mellow it out nicely."
"D - Good drink, probably one of the beer Doppelbock lagers out there; better than a Shiner but still could use a few more notes of malted caramel flavor; great job Great Lakes!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The alcohol is felt throughout the entire experience both in fruity flavors and warmth down the back of the throat. As far as doppelbocks go, this one is balanced fairly well and something I would approach again in the future."
"This is one of those that’s great to drink or to sip and savor. Overall, an excellent beer. Very good example of the style."
"Drinkability - I find it easy to sip through several of these. Good stuff, GL!"
"only ok. decent doppelbock but nothing to get excited about. there just isn't much flavor here."
"Notes: I can certainly recommend this latest bottled Great Lakes beer."
"Enjoy"
" Deep roasted malts were commonplace here, with tons of sugary notes residing inside of them. Lots of nuttiness coming through now, the sweetness still there, but really being blended out now. Really very big and complex aroma, very nice and strong.A rich nutty caramel wave came crashing through my mouth upon the first taste. Really rich and smooth, it really just kind of sat there letting you absorb all of these rich flavors that just, well were wonderful. lots of caramel and earthy grain like flavors then coming in behind it, deepen the profile and adding a good bit of backbone to it. nice and sweet and grainy. The finish was quick, nothing really dragging on for too long, but not crisp or clean; a smooth drawn out sugary close was to be expected."
"Caramel cookie dough malts lead off, with a slightly toasted edge. Vegetal hops with a touch of spicy bitterness around the edges. Cooked vegetables with a touch of caramelization, before a burnt sugar finish. Medium bodied with a slick feel. Not bad, but a little underwhelming."
"O: Another very solid beer from Great Lakes. I need to try more of this style."
"i like this beer. a very enjoyable lager."
"It's no Celebrator, but this is easily a top-notch American take on the style. Will definitely be buying this fresh next time it's released. Another fantastic offering from Great Lakes."
"Decent, but not incredible-especially not compared to many traditional German Doppelbocks. Not too much special in addition to the relatively one dimensional malt character. That said, the malt flavors are decent, and the alcohol is extremely well hidden."
"Maybe lacking a bit of complexity and depth, but a very enjoyable beer (yet again) from Great Lakes. Hmmm, how far from Philly is their brewpub?..."
"Poured into a pint glass, a nice cola brown, slightly hazed, with a small, dense, white head that receded to a thin wisp, and laced nicely. Lots of caramel malts in the nose, nutty, with some toasted bread. Similar taste, roasty malts, bready, nutty, caramel and toffee, and a touch of figs and plums. Also a definite coffee quality present in the taste; not as pronounced as a coffee stout perhaps, but a coffee essence was definitely present here. Not much alcohol noticeable. Smooth, a little bit sweet, not much hops to speak of. Medium mouthfeel, nice and drinkable."
"O - A nice beer but lacked in the richness and flavor complexity of what I expect from a quality doppelbock."
"Overall, this is a smooth good tasting beer that would taste good out on the patio with some nice weather while the sun goes down. I wouldn't go out of my way to get another but I definitely wouldn't pass it up if it were in front of me"
"Big mouthfeel and tasty. Pours mahogoney coloured body with big foamy head and retained off white head.Rich malty aromas. Thick creamy mouthfeel.Mild bitter finish, ginger bite. Dry aftertaste. Dangerously drinkable.Suitable carbonation. Bottle from Premiere."
"O- Pretty good doppelbock. I am used to having that overpowering sweetness from Caramel malts and other dark roasts but this really held up nicely and didn't become cloying or overpowering. A little too subtle at times, but nice overall."
"A very nice, doppel, I would buy the hell outta this ( & other beers from these guys ) if given the chance"
"Overall: A pretty good version of a doppelbock from Great Lakes."
"I enjoyed this beer and will def buy again when if it comes back out next year."
"The Doppelrock is maybe a bit of a letdown, but only because I'd have hoped for the folks at GLBC to absolutely nail this."
"Overall I like the Doppelrock but think it could be a little more complex"
"O- it good for the style pretty tasty and well done.. overall above average"
"A fine offering from our friends at GLB."
"Medium bodied and smooth with moderate carbonation. Not a bad beer, but far from the best Doppelbock I have had."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A rather drinkable DB. It's no Celebrator or Smooth Hoperator, but it's pretty darn good."
"Overall I have really enjoyed this brew, and sincerely hope it makes its way back around next season. I wish it were cheaper, but it is easily several dollars under the Celebrator price point."
"Very well malted Dopplebock btaht makes me want to want ROCK with the flavor and feeling of this brew."
"While there are a few off notes, I thought this was a pretty sold doppelbock. However, too sweet to be outstanding."
"A very good doppelbok. All the right flavor components. Going to enjoy draining this growler."
"I'd have another. Thanks to . . . shit, I don't remember who threw this in as an extra, but thanks!"
"Overall- average beer from a great brewery if they tweak it like the did the Octoberfest could become a great beer"
"O: This wasn't the best doppelbock, which is sort of surprising because the Great Lakes lagers I've had have generally been quite good."
"Overall a solid beer and quite drinkable considering the 7.8 alc/vol. Appearance shines here in my book."

"Dopplerock with a hard pour yields a nice inch of not so tight coiled foam, dark cream colored and resembles soda fizz as it dwindles quick, no stick. Smell is str8 forward german malts with a slight touch of peat and dark fruit if you sniff for it. A roasty appeal and a raw nuttiness with warming. Taste is ok up front but the aftertaste is not so hot. It starts off bold mixing caramel, other malts, and grassy hops, they just dont jive afterwards with the peat or some other type of nasty taste. Starts great, finishes ugly. Nuttiness and a hint of fusel alcohol. Feel is up to snuff a approaching full body with enough depth to coat the tounge momentarily. Carb is nice, semi bitey though, fizzy. This is an OK dopple from a Brewery that shines with German offerings, perhaps a tweak down the road will help things or perhaps this bottle just needs to rest for two months or so. It does not have a long shelf life (expires on 6-24-11) so I guess this is meant to be enjoyed fresh."
"O: Good, though a little bit hot."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"Soft supple feel, even carbonation, not cloying at all. Finishes a bit dry in fact. Low level bitterness, slight hint of alcohol at room temperature. Toasted malt, bitter walnut, blackened toast without the acridity of the charred bits. Lightly lingering dry bitterness. Pleasant feel, with dominant nutty malt flavors. Overall it's very enjoyable, and showcases it's malt complexity nicely."
"Great Lakes usually impresses, and this one continues that tradition. I would not hesitate to buy more, and fans of the style should be very happy with it."
"Pour yields a brew that is a moderate brown color. Medium off-white head that doesn't last too long and doesn't really leave any lacing behind. The nose has a bit of dark malt with mild sweetness. Some caramel and a bit of dark fruit there as well. Not terribly aromatic, however. The flavor has some mild caramel sweetness and a touch of bread. Pretty tame. Medium body with no real alcohol noticeable. Pretty decent, though I normally expect more from both doppelbocks and Great Lakes, especially when it comes to lagers."
"On tap at the Blue Tusk in Syracuse. Appeared dark brown with a short tan head. Honestly, this tasted like a lager version of an imperial brown ale. There was a bit of roast and then caramel and toffee, but none of the licorice and berry fruit notes I'd expect from a true doppelbock. It's like it's just too clean, and yes, it tasty, clean beer - an American take on the style I suppose. The body is also appropriately thick and smooth. A strong but relatively drinkable beer."
"Beer is thick in the mouth but I really like it. Sweet up front, nice malty backbone, decent finish, not dry, hides the ABV well, overall a drinkable beer. I'd have it again."
"The beer is transparent and amber hued with crimson highlights. The aroma brings sweet malts, as well as a light fruit and nut character. The beer is sweet and malt forward, with a subtle earthy taste. The body is rather thin. The finish is dry with a hint of hop bitterness. A decent brew, but a bit too thin and sweet for me."
"O - Another quality offering from Great Lakes."
"O - so many good parts and a few niggling distractions; quite good"
"Fairly average doppelbock. I drank it very easily, though."
"Probably my favorite Great Lakes to date"
"I don’t know that I like this style. This is interesting, but falls short of better beers."
"I get the reference, but 'The Doppelrock' has to be the cheesiest name in all of American craft brewing. Notwithstanding, it's a hell of a beer. And Great Lakes is a hell of a brewery - I expected nothing less than for them to masterfully capture the characteristics of the style and deliver on a rich, gratifying lager. Indeed, that's exactly what they did."
"O: This is not an overly complex brew but it is tasty. Easy to enjoy despite the small amounts of alcohol taste present."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet, malty scent that boasts of caramel and burnt toffee. It's relatively dry with just a hint of alcohol warmth. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that's half burnt toffee and half roasted malts. It goes down easy and finishes with a touch of warmth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good doppelbock. It's easy drinking and full flavored."
"The finish reminds me of a tree root. Weird explaination but that's a good thing. This beer leaves a great mouthfeel behind."
"D: A very good doppelbock, easy to drink on a cool/damp night, almost too easy. A very good example of the style, but not out of the ordinary. Solid, worth trying."
"On tap at the Mellow in Greensboro.Poured a deep garnet color with a fluffy beige colored head that held well atop.Aromas were a little light with brown sugar and caramel sweetness mainly standing out.Bready with that brown sugar sweetness on the palate,the alcohol is really hidden, you would have no idea the ABV was so high.Not overly complex,quite simple reallly,but it tastes good."
"This beer pours a clear ruby-brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel and not much else. The taste is like the aroma with a little more depth, but not much more. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a chewy texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this is a rare miss for Great Lakes Brewing. I cannot see myself drinking this again."
"Overall: A very well-balanced, enjoyable beer, but nothing that strikes me as outstanding. It delivers plenty of malt character, some of which I probably don't appreciate. At $3 for a 12-oz bottle, I probably won't buy it again, but am glad I tried it."
"O- This is the ""session"" doppelbock if there ever was one. The perfect beer for a spring night; the mouthfeel brings warmth and the more mild taste brings refreshment. It's just extremely well made. ABV really sneaks up on you. Another wonderful entry from Great Lakes"
"Overall, i thought i wasnt a fan of dopplebocks but this is pretty impressive."
"O- The first dopplebock that I have enjoyed. Very malty and a bit too sweet for my palate, but another well-crafted lager from Great Lakes."
"Feel is smooth and malty with a nice toasty aspect tugging in some nice little brittleness. Clean and overall sitting within a medium body. Puffs of spicey dryness bring in vanilla, toffee, fig, and cinnamon to it delicate complexity. Some tang and creamyness is evident with its malty Doppelbock body, but isn't quite as complexingly thick or cloying enough to meet some of the authentic German styles quailty. Still, this is one rocking awesome brew to behold and seemingly very fitting for Great Lakes!"
"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, small roastiness and mellow lager notes. In the taste, roasted malts and a lager like feel all the way through. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry caramel like aftertaste. EH! Its OK, thin and lacking flavor for what it is."
"Deep dark red with off white head that dissipates but clings to the sides of the glass. Weak aroma of stale grapes, slight spice, and grains. Tastes of dark fruits, slight spice, medicinal notes, salted grains, slight bread and nuts, dry with some residual sugar. Heavy carbonation with medium body. The Doppelrock is the dumbest name I've ever heard but the beer isn't as bad as I would've guessed. Worth a try but no reason for multiple pints."
"It was a bit of a miss for me, not bad but not in Great Lakes upper level."
"I've tried four of five of GLBC's offerings, and this one is my favorite so far."
"Overall, too much malts for me. Straight up all malts. Too boozy as well. Just not a good dopplebock imo."
"Toffee brown color with no head or lacing to speak of, golden color at the rim. Complex nose of maple syrup, port soaked plums, dark ref fruits - currant and cherry and some sweet sherry. Mouth mirrors alot of the nose with a touch more of oxidized sherry, hazelnut and finishes with a warming alcohol, midly hoppy finish. Received this beer as an extra and was thoroughly enjoying."
"""We will we will doppelrock you!"" Sorry, I couldn't resist. The doppelrock (yes, the ""The"" is absolutely necessary) pours a clear garnet-ruby topped by a finger of dirty cream foam and populated by a bunch of floating particulates. The nose comprises caramel, light buttery biscuits, figs, red grapes, light maple syrup, and raisins. The taste holds notes of caramel, bitter orange peel, light bitter dark chocolate powder, light burnt rye toast, and a hint of red wine. Whoa, this does not follow, nor does it sit all that well with my 'buds. The body is a light-ish medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a too light and not-very-appetizing d-bock. Can't really say all that much else about it."
"D- Very drinkable, and I really enjoyed this one. I like what GLBC did here."
"O-I'm impressed. About what I expected. Falls a little short of the top german doppels but a well done American version I could drink a lot of."
"The Doppelrock is a pretty good release from Great Lakes Brewing Company. I like that they're introducing some new things annually in their seasonal lineup. While The Doppelrock isn't the best they've come up with, it is definitely a beer worth checking out. Frankly, it could easily be improved with less of the toasted flavor and elimination of the subtle medicinal quality. They're not big players in the flavor, but I'm not a fan of either. It's not a great Doppelbock, but it is a pretty good one."
"O - I'd like this year round. It is a great Dopplebock. If your lucky enough to snag this, you won't be dissapointed."
"Medium bodied with a blast of earthy bitterness that lingers throughout, dominating the other flavors, into a long dry finish. Very earthy with the taste of dirt, soil and spice. Underneath there is a sweet malt backbone with hints of toffee, hazelnut, chocolate and caramel. Although these malt elements are there, they are buried beneath the earthy bitter flavor. The ABV is well masked with little heat but the harshness of the flavor makes it pretty tough to drink. I usually love Great Lakes' offerings but this was a pretty big disappointment."
"Pours a hazy brown. Off white head forms and some lace. Aroma of nutty roasted malts. In the flavor, roasted malt, scotch, peat and alittle fruityness. Somewhat boozey, alittle sweet with a kiss of hops in the finish. Full bodied, smooth and good carbonation. A pretty authentic tasting bock. If you told me this was an import I would have believed it."
"This is a, hmmm, ""passable"" doppelbock. I'm enjoying drinking it, but it's not one of my favorites. Many better ones out there. Needs more balance to the flavor - tone the malts down a bit, and I think some tasty sublety would come through. But as it is, those nice flavors are buried."
"Overall - A nice malty and smooth drinking beer. The beer is right on for the style. The sugar and hops add flavor. Easy to drink and enjoy. Alcohol is just enough to be careful to not drink more then a few."
"Great Lakes The Doppelrock is a very clear, deep red beer with a big, foamy, khaki head that has outstanding retention and lacing. There are spicy hops in the aroma with some slightly sweet caramel. There are notes of wood resin and chocolate. It has a smooth, medium body that finishes a little chalky. It's a bold taste. The tangy, slightly sweet malt is balanced out with a nice wooden bitterness. Roasted flavors and melanoids are detected. It has a long, hot, bitter aftertaste. Wow, this is like as lager version of an American barley wine. It packs a punch."
"Overall: I don't drink too many doppelbocks, but this is very enjoyable (not on the level of Celebrator). I will finish the rest of the 4 pack with no issue whatsoever."
"Overall I really don't care for the style since it's usually pretty boozy but Great Lakes did a great job of keeping the alcohol well hidden and delivering a great flavor to boot. Would prefer it over Spaten's version any day!"
"I would serve this with a pasta with a red sauce that was heavy on the veggies and cheese. It will compliment it well."
"Needs a little bitterness to offset the sweetness but otherwise a very well done doppelbock."
"Nose is pleasant but nondescript, toasty grains and chocolate. Tastes more interesting, perhaps not strictly to style. Malts are very nutty and quite toasty, hops are earthy and rather tealike. Creamy and thickish with moderate carbonation. Lacking in crispness. I'd have guessed brown ale in a blind test. Not a great doppelbock, but tasty enough."
"I suppose based on manufacturing costs, this beer may be priced appropriately, but based on taste it is greatly overpriced. I will remember to not purchase again and I would not recommend it."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Dark burgundy with a nice 1/4 inch of foam. Dissipates to a ring then slowly fades leaving lacing on the glass. Sweet carmelly malt smell. First taste is malty coffee and caramel. Lightly sweet malt and a light molasses taste with a slightly bitter finish. Light mouthfeel easy drinking. Not my favorite Doppelbock but good."
"The mouthfeel is creamy with an average amount of carbonation, and each sip leaves a slight film in your mouth. Medium-bodied. This is very drinkable, as it goes down smoothly, and the balance makes it enjoyable to drink. Glad I picked this up, will definitely enjoy finishing them off."
"Poured into GLB Pilsener glass, Burnt reddish color, with a light tan head, reducing to a line of foam most of the way down, with light lacing. Aroma of burnt molasses, and malt, with a hint of Rye (even though there is no sign of it on the bottle) Taste is medium body, with dry malt finish. Crisp and easy drinking, didn't notice the 7.8% ABV. Nice roasted chocolate malt, and I swear there is Rye in there. Flavor was enhanced as it warmed.Any way, another good offering by GLB."
"O -- The more I sip at this, the more I'm enjoying it despite the rather hot alcohol character -- it's bordering on being too harsh, but the rich malt character with subtle complexities saves it. A very good Doppelbock to style."
"Pours a dark amber ruby brownish red body with a light speckled khaki head. Aroma has figs/rasisins, with a touch of green apple. Big caramel malts with a nicey artisinal bread layer. Flavor is sweet upfront with the malt profile flexing it's girth, a great example of another well brewed lager from Great Lakes. A bit of herbal hops to balance things out but the booze is really well hidden. More caramel dark fruits like raisins/plums/ and some green apple tartness make up the backbone of the flavor profile. Medium bodied mouthfeel even keeled carbonation with a touch of sticky residual sugars but not cloyingly so. Overall impression is this beer will be popular across the board by both beer geeks and newbies to the craft beer realm very solid welcomed addition to Great Lakes lineup of beers."
" Although not my favorite style, a solid, smooth brew all around. I have yet to have a bad offering from the boys at Great Lakes!"
"Doppelrock - Doppelbock, clever wordplay, then the label goes on to blather on about the double-necked guitar famous in Cleveland - methinks they come out of the gate trying too hard. Indeed, the cleverness of the name exceeds the inventiveness of the beer which you would expect from the hype to be a bit in-your-face. To the contrary, it is a bit bland. Caramel malt, moderate malty body, some generalized sweetness. For such a big abv, not much going on here. After a string of sub-par doppelbocks, I feel the need to go back to the source and recalibrate my taste with a Celebrator."
"And it was good. so i might buy it again."
"O: not bad, but expected more from GL. Will try again to see if this was just a subpar batch. Needs a bit more flavor."
"As usual, this is a good effort by Great Lakes. I had a few of this at the bar with no complaint. My buddy and I had a discussion about the ABV, but neither of us guessed that it would be close to 8%, so the booze is pretty well hidden."
"12oz bottle outta the 4 pack. Pours a ruddy bronze, establishing a smallish white head that leaves behind some slight, sticky lacing. The aroma is warm and malty, but a little weak. The taste brings a well balanced blend of malt and hops with an enjoyably sticky finish. A credit to the style."
"Treating overall as drinkability, the ABV really cuts back on how much one can drink."
"Notes: Overall I feel it's a well made and very tasty Doppelbock. Its only set back is the heavy alcoholic warmth and this will probably mellow just right with a little age."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Quite a prominent alcohol taste. The mouthfeel is sweeter than I remember it. Dark fruits and bitters seem more prominent as compared to the bottle. Not sure if it was just the temperature this was served at or if it was the tap; but I'll take a bottled version of this over the on-tap I had tonight any day."
"A good Double Bock, nothing too special S omething I would seek out again."
"A drinkable brew, but needs some minor changes: head retention should be better; needs a little more body; The chocolate flavor is a nice addition to the style, but needs to be toned down a bit."
"It's absolutely well-crafted. Though a generalized muted sense makes it feel more of a bock than a dopplebock. The elevated price tag doesn't add to my sense of enjoyment, especially since its strong suit is drinkability."
"A solid enjoyable Bock, that i'd rather drink on a crisp fall day while raking leaves. It would be great for that."
"Overall impression: A very drinkable, very flavorful dopplebock. Carbonation was a bit on the high side which I think is what made the bitterness seem sharp. Still, malty without being too sweet or making you feel full. Well done."
"The palate opens with a blend of dark caramel, and hop bitterness. Earthy, minty and spicy and decidedly German, the hop character is fresh and assertive. Very well balanced with a rich, melanoidin malt character, there's flavors of raisin bread, brown sugar and dark caramel and even a little bit of nuttiness. Drying on the finish with an earthy, hopppy bitterness, I can't say I can pick out the chocolate that I can smell. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this feels mildly creamy on the palate and is really really enjoyable. Overall, this isn't the best dopplebock, but good lord, is it a good one."
"I would have written an awesome review full of rock and roll references and things, but this beer just didn't inspire me to do so, Wasted Years."
"Note: I just saw it's 7.8% abv...I am stunned. This goes down as well as any beer out there - awesome job GLBC."
"A good beer. I have not had many doppelbocks and this is the first one I've reviewed. I'd drink it again if I was in the mood."
"Overall a good production, solid, but not as hoppy as Great Lakes usually makes 'em."
"Overall: A solid Doppelbock that could have used a tad more balance. As it is, it is certainly enjoyable and quite drinkable, but a little too sweet as the hops don't quite measure up."
"Check this beer out before The DOPPELROCK Tour leaves your town."
"Taste caramel malt sweetness giving way to roasted wheat bread chewy mouthfeel. Finishes dry with green apple bitterness. There are some nutty notes popping from time to time."
"Pours a clear, reddish-brown. A supremely dark tan head recedes and thinly coats my pilsner glass. Smell is super-fresh, lite-chocolatey and lite-brown sugary malts. Also, a bit of bitters. Very pleasant. Taste ""rocks"" much more than the smell. Rich and buttery, full malts take over the profile. Very complex malts, running the gamut from toast to molasses to coffee, never quite slipping to the ""dark"" side. Finish is a residual bitterness from the malts. Also, a bit of alcohol burn - almost produces a charred character. This beer easily masks its 7.8%. Maybe freshness played a factor, but this is the most enjoyable doppelbock I've had to date."
"overall it is a good dopple, but is not perfect in any means."
"O- I thought this was OK, but just slightly above average. I think there are maltier doppelbocks out there and ones that define the style and are more drinkable as well. It's nice to see Great Lakes branching out, but this one doesn't really meet expectations. Stick w/ Xmas Ale and Blackout."
"EXCELLENT JOB GLBC! YOU ROCK THE DOPPLEROCK!"
"The drinkability is great. This is the kind of beer that makes you want to take big 3oz. gulps. At 7.8% that can be dangerous, but also a good time."
"D: Pretty nice. I'm not too into bocks and doppelbocks for the most part. This one is sweet but not too much for me, and there is a good mix of the bread, lightly roasted malt, and fruit flavors. The alcohol isn't too apparent in the taste. This one is going down pretty easily, could see drinking two in a row if I was in the mood for a dark, malty beer that would bring a bit of a buzz with the almost 8% abv."
"D: Overall very nice, while not excellent it is nice to try something new from a great brewery."
"D. Easy drinking and overall pretty enjoyable for a doppelbock. I was expecting a bit more body and some more complexity. Glad I bought a 4-pack but I am not dying to grab more."
"D: This goes down easily enough, but the not-particularly-complex, mostly sweet flavor isn't appealing enough for me to really enjoy my glass. Though I did buy a 4-pack of this, my other bottles may hang around the fridge for a while (and this is coming from an ordinarily huge fan of Great Lakes)."
"This is one of the better doppelbocks I've come across. Great Lakes really knows how to brew a lager, they really excel w/ German beers. This is a must for anyone who's into doppelbocks. Well crafted!"
"As many American versions of the style go, this too lacks the classic melanoidin flavor and toasty-dry finish in favor of malty sweetness. Where the two go hand in hand, authentic versions give more depth and quality while avoiding one dimensional sweetness. The Dopplerock is a good beer that could easily sit within strong/stock ale or old ale catagories as well."
"Drinkability: A great doppelbock with awesome and simple flavors -- something with so few ingredients should be just like this; with a near 8% ABV I don't know if I could have more than couple, but on a cool early spring night, it's pretty fitting."
"Here's to the next 1000!"
"I was hoping this would be a little bolder but it isn't, and it doesn't have that great thick malt I associate with this style. It's good for drinkability but I think I might go for something else in this style."
"D: Overall, this is good, but a little lackluster for Great Lakes. Maybe I just miss Blackout..."
"D - Quickly growing on me. nice warming finish. good to drink"
"Another great beer from GLBC...these guys really nail German style beers!"
"D- Very drinkable. Full flavored brew that soars above most of the other ""spring seasonals""."
"D- Not a bad beer altogether, but lacks the clean flavor that really defines the style. I would prefer to pick up a Celebrator, but I have no problem finishing the rest of my 4 pack."
"D-very drinkable like most doppelbocks. not a bad brew at all!"
"12 ounce bottle, best by 6/1/2011. Served in a mug, the beer pours a clear reddish/amber color with an inch frothy tan head. Head retention is good, with a lot of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like toffee, caramel malt, dark fruit (figs), and a bit of brown sugar. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, just full of malty goodness. There's also a nutty taste noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is great, it's very smooth and enjoyable. This is a good brew, and a nice addition to Great Lakes bottled lineup. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Drinkability: This one went very fast - highly drinkable on it own, and went quite well with a meal (ravioli). I could easily see having another although by the end of the glass I'm starting to notice that higher ABV since the beer was finished rather quickly. Overall very easy to drink and a bit dangerous with how easy it is to drink."
"Overall I was very pleased with this beer. The head was not as thick as I would have preferred and the scent was a little lacking. Great complexity in the flavor with an excellent mouthfeel that makes this as drinkable as a Bock."
"After trying it on tap at the Brewhouse and then in bottles, I can honestly say this is the best beer i have had."
"This is a very sessionable beer. However the alcohol eventually will catch up to you. If this is the same price as the rest of great lakes 4 packs I would say its not worth the money but if its less give it a shot. I am very sad that this took Blackout's spot for february because that is a far superior beer. I do hope this is not a permanent seasonal."
"D:Score is all around on this one, does not represent the style well but is actually really tasty and easy to drink. Fruits and sweetness dominate this one and make it pleasurable. GL definitely hit something different with one."
"The only thing I really don't like about this beer is the mouthfeel is a little under for what I think of a Doppelbock. Although, with this beer it is good. A good try in this style from them....good job. Can't wait for this to come out in 4 pk's."
