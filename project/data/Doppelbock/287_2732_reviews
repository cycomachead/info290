"If you're into extremely smooth dopplebocks with a nice toffee taste. Then this will be your thing"
""
"Not much to this beer.  Flavor was good, but I thought there was something missing.  Drank it from the bottle, and it just seemed a little flat. Would try it again.  Maybe draft in a glass would improve the feel and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this take, it's different than I think some classic German styles in the same vein, but I like it for that quality particularly."
""
""
"one of my favorites!"
"This was a decent beer."

"Amazing and different throughout drinking."
""
""
""

"Transparent amber in color.  Very little head retention.  Sweet malty aroma as expected.  Even sweeter taste.  Just enough of something else (probably hops) to keep it balanced.  Finishes with a slight alcohol warmth."
""
""
"Overall, not bad but some people might turned off because of how sweet it is. I'd recommend to have one in order to compare to others but one could live without it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Carmel sweetness, but there is something about this beer that I really don't like, that I can't put my finger on"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great dopplebock. Could use a bit more carbonation and lasting head, but otherwise a great representative of the style."
""
"O: a decent enough drink, but not a style I'm partial to - with but a few frames of reference, including the Ayinger Celebrator, which I really liked, I'd say this is a passing take on the style, but nothing outstanding, and as a stand-alone product, decent but not to my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very clean doppelbock with excellent attenuation which makes for a very nice drinking experience.  In my opinion, it doesn’t stack up to its world-class German counterparts - Andechs and Ayinger - but it offers a pleasant diversion here in Michigan.  Well done, Bell’s."

"Pretty smooth and not over heavy for an 8% ABV.  Would recommend it !"

"O - I'm a fan of doppelbocks and this is a good one.  This is a great, full bodied, delicious winter warmer kind of beer. Now I have to go find a six pack."

"Poured from 12 oz bottle into large tulip. A beautiful clear deep mohagany with a thin white head. Aroma is of dates, caramel, brown sugar...all malt, no discernable hop presence. Taste follows the nose with malty sweetness and dried fruit...dried plums, caramel, raisins, a little bit of bread. Mouthfeel is nice, a little thin, low carbonation. Overall, an excellent example of doppelbock. Well done."

"Maybe I have had this one too long. Although I hear you can put some age on it. I will be short with this review. It was poured out halfway through drinking so that I could get to something else. I found it to cloying. It was not balanced enough to make it an enjoyable experience. I may try another in a different setting but I believe that it was too malty and sweet for my taste."

"Pours a murky super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, toffee, leather, tobacco, soy sauce, and slight cardboard aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit, leather, tobacco, soy sauce, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with interesting leather, fruit, and tobacco characteristics all around."
"O: While this beer is sweet, it is not cloying and it is a very good example of the style. I enjoyed this one but it is a definite slow sipper."

"OVERALL: A classic American take on the Doppelbock style. Fresh tasting and quite good to toast over good food and good friends."
""
""
""
""
""
"A deep tawny color, this dopplebock dark but relatively clear. The smell is all malt, rich and with depth. There is some distant dark fruit as well. the taste is malty, and a little roasted quality. Some bitterness, and very full in body. The beer is flavorful and very enjoyable. It's a solid dopplebock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I am a fan of the style and this is a pretty good example of the style. I think it hits a lot of the benchmarks, but does not hit them very hard."
""
""
""
"This is my first encounter with a dopplebock so its a little hard to judge this without a point of reference, may return to review again at a later date. This lager pours a brown hazelnut color with very little head or lacing. The aroma is very malty and warming with notes of dried fruit and a little toasted malt. The mouthfeel is a little sticky and close to full bodied. The flavor is rich and deep, lots of malt, almost a fruitcake like quality, and a nice warming alcohol bite. This is a nice beer especially on a cold day. I look forward to trying more of the style to get a better idea of what they should be like."
"This one's pretty good, but could be beefed up a little bit, seems like somewhere in between a bock and a dopplebock."
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really a well done dopplebock imho, just delicious, a very nice balance of flavors, all complimentary. While this is definitely a sweeter beer, the boldness of the dark fruits, roasted malts, grassy hops and light minerals, and even the faint alcohol heat all balance out the sweetness perfectly - I don't consider this overly sweet or syrupy in the least. Glad I got a case of this, will definitely pick up another case next spring - highly recommend."

"Overall / Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable - I really wish I had seen a six pack of this in the store and picked one up rather than the single I spied. Rich and full of flavor. Went well with a meal (pasta and chicken with a cream sauce) and I would not mind having it all by itself. Will definitely have to revisit this one next time I'm at the store for more beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sharp and prickly with great dark fruit and earthy flavors playing off each other. This serves up a tad rough and lacks lush refinement."
""
""
""
"O- A nice tradition version of the style from an American brewery who prides itself on creating true to style beers. I haven't had too many American doppelbocks but I've had quite a few of the German ones available here and I've had Troegenator which is one of Americas other highly rated doppelbocks and I'd say I'd give the slight edge to Troegenator. None the less a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I will have to try this again and review this, well... review."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is certainly one of the better American doppbocks out there. That being said there is something about the richness of the German ones that keeps me going to them."
""
"Poured a clear, deep brown with a thinner ecru head. The head has minimal retention but what does last leaves a little lacing. There is a nice sweeter malty aroma and the taste follows along. There is also a light earthy hops in the background. Within the flavor a little reminder of dark fruit. It has a nice silky unctuous feeling and is a B+ doppelboch"
""
""
"O- Another solid offering from Bell's. Doppelbock fans will enjoy this one."
""
"Consecrator is an above-average doppelbock. Recommended."
"Poured a dark brownish copper with less than a half finger of head that dissipated rapidly. The nose was bready. The malt profile is solid, but this offering suffers from a problem that I think is pronounced in the style – the cidery alcohol taste is quite intrusive upon the overall flavor profile. The body is hearty and the finish is nicely dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good beer. In my opinion this beer defintely doesn't drink like an 8abv. Very smooth, very crisp and refreshing. Try one."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer needs to become more popular. Well done Bell's on a difficult style that doesn't seem to jump the Atlantic very gracefully. This beer is best about 20 minutes before it's allowed to warm all the way to room temperature if that makes sense?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Tasty enough, but I fear this particular bottle did not age well. The vinegar aroma hangs on, as does some similar flavor. As long as I don't inhale it's at least drinkable, but if I do inhale I have to put it down and cough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a nice malty depth, very good flavor, definite try per style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- a great beer, I'm don't normally seek out German styles but this is one to behold."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not as good as I was hoping for. Still a decent brew but lacking in the mouthfeel and a little too earthy for me."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/22/2013. Pours slightly cloudy reddish copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slight foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, pear, apple, raisin, toast, brown bread, floral, toffee, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, molasses, raisin, pear, apple, brown bread, floral, light pepper, toffee, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, pear, brown bread, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate fruity esters; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice doppelbock style. All around nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"A fairly decent doppelbock but nothing to scream and shout about."
""
""

"O-Maybe because it wasn't fresh that hurt it, but an 8% doppelbock should hold up for a few months. Just a miss by Bell's."

"O- A solid Doppelbock, nothing more. A fine example of the style but not one to seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good Doppelbock. There are better ones out there."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a malt forward beer, with enough character to keep things from being too cloying, but lacks the complexity of more traditional doppelbock melanoidin profiles."
""
""
""
""
"O - A well done doppelbock."
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the nicely inclusive aroma, and its ease of drinkability. From the first look at this beer things seems a bit light. The coloring sits lightly, but never offensively so. The aroma and the taste, too, are on the simplistic side, and are definitely out of balance. While each gives big sweetness through the caramels, esters, and cloying fruity sugars, the roast never quite comes up to meet or even it out. While this is a decent representation of the style, we usually look for something that shows more depth and roast to the malts, and more darkness throughout."
""
""
""
"A very average stuff from a good brewery."
"This beer is pretty solid. I was worried at first because the appearance and nose weren't what I was expecting but the flavor is everything I want from a doppelbock. It has a deep flavor, it's easy to drink, but the alcohol is present enough to warm you up on a chilly early spring day. Well done and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice and easily drinkable doppelbock. It started off ""just okay"" but I really enjoyed the latter half of the glass quite more than the first half. Maybe the warmth helped it to open up a bit - that's usually how it goes, yeah? I haven't had an insane amount of doppelbocks to compare to, but this one was pretty damn good. As good as Celebrator? Probably not, but a great take on the style nonetheless."
""
""
""
"I love a Doppelbock but find this slightly weak in taste despite the obvious bulk of malt used to achieve 8 percent ABV. No alcohol feel but easy and smooth this is good just not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: nice enough doppel. Nothing outstanding."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is very good, solid doppelbock. Clean flavors, not too sweet, maybe more helles bock than doppelbock, but the lighter doppelbocks are a good balance to the heavier ones."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O – With no shortage of malts available, the lack of a nose in this beer disappoints. It's a straight-ahead doppelbock that's enjoyable to drink, but doesn't offer anything to separate it from the pack. Malt profile could be mistaken for a Scotch ale, which is fine by me. This would be a great candidate to barrel-age and add those characteristics to give it more complexity. All-in-all, this beer is one that I'd order because I wanted to take a break from tasting really distinctive brews and just wanted a solid but unchallenging malt-forward beer, and the menu lacked an exceptional option that couldn't be missed. One thing to note: priced in the high-teens for a six-pack, there are much better options in this style for the same amount of money."
""
"Bottling date 1/23/13. Had this at the Tavern on Liberty in PA. Consecrator is a beautiful auburn color, with a very healthy 1.5"" head. Quite fizzy carbonation going on here. The aroma is very powdery and candy-like. Lots of fruit esters coming up in both the aroma and flavor - apricot, plum, purple grapes, and raisins. The taste is smooth and bready, coating the mouth fairly well, and despite the 8% ABV, it's not too boozy. Overall, this is just like the best German Doppelbocks I had tasted the times I spent visiting there. I can't believe how smooth this is... Another stellar brew from Bell's!"
""
""
""
"Overall: I haven't had this in nearly seven years. I thought it was a likable, above-average d-bock then and now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer, not great. A few steps away from being great. Glad I tried it and also glad I didn't pull the trigger on a 6-pack like I initially wanted to before I knew it was 17 or 18 bucks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Completely crystal clear amber colored. Beautiful. Not much head and lightly carbonated. Smells bready, malty and sweet. Taste is bready and slightly sweet. Some grape and raisiny flavors. Finishes clean. Alcohol hidden. Mouthfeel is relatively light for being somewhat high gravity. This is expertly crafted and an American hallmark of the style. Won't find many better for this style than this! This style is quickly becoming one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Meh, probably will pass on this in the future."
""
""
""

"O - Overall this wasnt a bad doppelbock. A few steps above average."
""
""
""
"O. I like it a lot a first but not so much as it warmed. I do like doppelbocks but some times they get too sour for me as this did but I would try it again and keep it colder."
""
""
""
"O - Really liked this beer and i'm a big fan of the Doppelbock style in general, so i may be biased. Such a great balance of enough sweetness to balance the malt on this one. I couldn't taste a bit of the 8% on this brew. Will definitely be looking for and drinking this beer again."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a ""must try"" for doppelbock fans and dark beer fans. It hits all the right notes for a doppelbock, and it hits them with flair. This is a sweeter, malt focused beer, and the balance comes more from the funkiness of the yeast and only somewhat from the hops. The result is a very pleasing brew for malt fans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am not usually a fan of the Doppelbock style, but I absolutely loved this creation by Bell's"
""
""
"The maltiness leads to a smooth finish with a slight hint of the alcohol content but is not at all overpowering. If you are a fan of doppelbocks or other malty beers, this one is a must try."
""
""
""
"Not a beer style I choose to drink often, but remember it well from earlier times in Germany and think Bell's has done a great job."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very drinkable imperial dopplebock that is a bit sweeter and fruitier than usual."
"O - Yet another solid beer from a great brewery. I had been putting off trying this one and finally did it. I was worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Stella chalet. Pours a dark brown, with a one inch off white head, with minimal lace if any. Smell is figs, brown sugar, carmel apple, and alcohol. Taste is all of those, very balanced, with carmel apple being the most dominant flavor. Body is thin to medium, not much carbonation, not dry, and pretty easy going down. Not my favorite style, but also not anywhere near the best of this style I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not my favorite from Bells. Not bad flavors, but too sweet and the etoh is too prevalent for my palate."
"poured into a pint glass. Copperish color and little head. Smells of chocholate but that's it taste is exceptional but mouthful dwindles as the beer dwindles. Good beer but not exactly what I expected from this company. Bell's usually hit the spot but this one is a tad mediocre."
""
""
""
""
"O - Bar none the worst beer I have ever had from Bell's. I cannot seem to figure out why others covet this brew, but for me I will just avoid it from now on."
"Bell’s did a nice job with Consecrator Doppelbock. It’s not among the world’s best Doppelbocks, but it’s a good effort. It’d be a notch better with a little less of an alcohol flavor and a stronger nose. Still very good nonetheless. Easy recommendation."
""
"On tap at Side Door Grill, Madison.  I'm downgrading my original score (4.5) from three years ago. How I used to love this stuff. It hasn't changed. I have."
""
"Overall: A very solid take on a Doppelbock. Everything you would expect from the style. One of the better American versions."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good malty offering, not as rich and heavy as most other Dopplebocks I've tried. Pretty drinkable and enjoyable."
""
""
"O- It's Bell's...need I say more?"
"This is a rich, intense caramel amber hue with foam that quickly dissipates. It has a rich, malty caramel aroma (notice the trend here) that’s mellow and sweet and a mellow, sweet, caramel malt flavor (third time’s the charm!) with a warming alcohol finish. Doppledeliciousness!"
""
""
"This beer really didn't bring a lot to the table other than a sour lingering alcohol taste. Even as the beer warmed no real flavors came through. Great to look at but not to drink."
""
"Overall enjoyable. This is my first dopplebock so I'm not sure what to compare it to. Being a fan of Bell's, I'd wanted to try it for a while. It drinks smooth and pleasant with many flavors I'd expect out of a quad but with a lighter feel. I'm glad to have it & will revisit every month or two to see how it ages. "
"I'm not sure if I will search this beer out necessarily, but I would like to try some others of this style to see what some others taste like comparatively."
""
""
"It's a satisfying and interesting drink that I'll gladly buy a 6 pack of next time I see it."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe the feel could be beefed up, and the aromatics of the nose could be stronger, but there is little that could be done to make this doppelbock taste more amazing."
"Pours a very light brown, bordering on amber. A gentle pour brings little to no head to speak of, and what there is dissipates quickly. Clear, no haze. Smells malty of molassas and licorice with a touch of hops to counter. Mouthfeel is light and delicate with just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down extremely smooth. Sweet up front with a tinge of alcohol. Fairly complex follow up with notes molassas and honey. Tastes like a dopplebock should, in short. Has zero bitterness in the finish. In fact, a sweetness lingers on the tongue making you want more."
"Overall, this beer lacks the complexity of the top-shelf dopplebocks, but it is a nice entry from an outstanding brewer. Everything about it says ``traditional'', right down to the (blank)-``or'' name that dopplebocks typically have."
"M - Medium-to-thick mouthfeel with good carbonation. Slightly sticky in the finish, but not syrupy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A major hint of toffee and caramel add to the pleasant finish, creating what is overall a commendable choice, especially if you’re big into bocks."
"O: A nice beer, but I wouldn't consider this one of Bell's keystone beers."
"Overall, it is full pack of malt."
""
""
"A little more of a bite than I was expecting. Still smooth at its core, but theres an earthy bitterness that keeps the sweet in check. Corn syrup. I was expecting more caramel and toffee, but it was glaringly absent. I know theye were going for German feeling, and they hit it dead on. Its not a world class beer, but its still good."
"Mouthfeel is incredible and perfect- goes down well at a cold temperature but froths up perfectly in the leave. Sticks well; the beer is as flavorful once it's down as in the midst of a sip."
"D - I would session this one!"
""
""
""
""
"Nice doppelbock from Bell's.. recommended."
"This is a tale of two beers, for me. The smell is underwhelming, and sets up low expectations for the taste, but those are quickly broken. The finish is simply the best part, with an amazing sweet yet light floral lingering presence. This actually makes it a nice sipper."

"At $14.99 a 6 pack (with 5 more yet to consume) this has got to be the shittiest value in my 5+ months of trying 	real beer. (Didn't really piss me off till I looked at my receipt just now and saw what I paid for this crap)."

"Overall, a clean and drinkable doppelbock. Not quite as impressively malty as some examples, but solid in its own right."
"The beer is dark orange, hinting on chestnut brown, with a half inch of light tan head that leaves sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of malt, alcohol, light spice. Toffee, caramel, malt comprise the flavor. The flavor offers more depth and complexity than was indicated in the aroma. Slightly sweet. A malt forward beer, as is expected in a dopplebock. Alcohol presence is there, but unobtrusive. Medium to light in body, with moderately low carbonation. Overall, a solid American version of a doppelbock."
"Overall nice, great malt and sweetening agent flavors (i.e. Molasses, toffee, etc), great fruits and complex flavors, hint of warming booze, well balanced and drinkable. I would def have this again."
"Overall - Not good and nearing bad. I finished it, but mostly so I could accumulate adjectives for this review. Probably the worst beer from Bell's I've had."
"An odd doppelbock, but it has a nice smell and tastes okay."
"Fuller medium body, higher carbonation, sticky and prickly on the tongue. A decent doppelbock, I enjoyed the fruit tones, and the alcohol was under control."
"I really liked this beer and while it might not be in the very top tier for the style I found it adhered to it very well. Big, sweet, boozy, tasty."
"Overall: My first doppelboch so its new to me. I like this one. Unique and easier to drink than I expected."
"A little cloying, but great for the style."
"Overall: Pretty good beer overall. Not the strongest offering by Bell's by any stretch, but it's worth giving a shot."
"Sorry Bells, but you let me down on this one. This is my first doppelbock, and I think I just don't like this style of beer. I was never a fan of lagers, especially higher alcohol lagers, so take my review with a grain of salt. Tastes a bit like Baltika 9 cut with Steel Reserve, bleh!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer worth drinking for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
"It's a deep red that's a touch cloudy and a wimpy tan head. The aroma is striking, with an abundant amount of plumb and some toffee. The taste is subdued, but only slightly, with a bit more of the malt coming out to make it more balanced. It's smoothness is almost at the top of the scale but it does have a mild dryness I don't see much in this style. Overall, a great beer I'd have again."
"Overall this is a good beer but not a great Doppelbock by any means. Isn't even worthy of drinking the bathwater of great examples of this style from Salvator, Weihenstephaner and especially Ayinger. Also falls way way short of the best American example from Thomas Hooker. This is a pass for me as far as a recommendation goes."
"I'm unsure whether or not this is really spot on for style, but per my personal enjoyment it was not satisfactory. I am not a doppelbock connoisseur so I will rate as close to style as I know."
"This Doppelbock was on tap at the Tap & Table one night when I stopped in. I had always wanted to try this beer from Bells but hadn't seen it around. I ordered a glass and as it was brought to me I couldn't help but notices it's really nice looking brown color. The head was nice and left a pretty good lacing down the glass. The smell of malts were on the nose along with some sweet aromas too. The taste is a little sweet kind of like caramel or brown sugar mixed with a roasted bitterness and some dark fruits also. The mouthfeel had a decent thickness to it. Overall I thought this beer was pretty good and would drink it again one day."
"A wonderful surprise. After being disappointed in Batch 10,000, I really didn't know what to expect with this one, and I came away happily and pleasantly surprised. A sweet yet complex, and certainly delicious, doppelbock. Would love to try this one again!"
"I utilized a slow gentle pour so as not to disturb any lees that may be lying on the bottom of the bottle. As a result, I only got some wisps in terms of head. Color was a deep dark-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with a caramel malt sweetness. Wow! This might end up being breakfast and lunch today, followed by a nap. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, but the flavor was rich caramel on the tongue. Man, this could be a dessert beer, easily. Finish was rock-a-bye-baby smooth, lulling me that much closer to a nap. It was sweet, but not cloyingly so and the alcohol was not in evidence. Proceed cautiously!"
"Overall: Does a fairly nice job hiding the alcohol. I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't too sweet, but I didn't find this beer particularly interesting."
"Overall this is well done and I'm excited that I finally tried a Bell's beer. Now about that Hopslam... :)"
"O - A fairly good Doppelbock, I wish the nose and flavor profile were more prominent."
"Overall - A nice, strong lager. Has malty character in spades, and is big without being overpowering. Would make for a nice beer in winter to sip while sitting by the fire."
"Overall not my favorite style (stout kind of guy) but this one is pretty sound and flies right next to German counterparts. Could use a bit more coffee or chocolate to really bring out the most of the style but better than average."
"O - Great beer! I love Dopplebocks, and this one delivers the goodness without missing a beat!"
"O: I have not has too many doppelbocks but I did enjoy this one. It does not drink like a beer that is 8%."
"Overall, extremely good for the style. Rich malt flavors but not overpowering. Sweet but not too sweet. I love the smoothness. This is a fairly expensive beer but I'd highly recommend trying it at least once if your a fan of sweeter, more malty beers."
"Poured from a bottle into a weisse-vase glass. The beer pours a deep, vibrant, ruby-auburn coloring with a healthy, thick, lightly foamy off-white (almost cream colored) head. Aromas are sugary sweet malt, light toffee, citrus, and a bready quality. Very interesting, and very dense aromas. Also some darker fruits that sneak into the smells, like some fig and date. The beer is tangy sweet, but light, on the initial taste. There are citrus flavors that ride the undercurrent of the beer that help to keep it light. There are tangy caramel flavors, with the slightest lean into sour, that hit the middle of the tongue, and the end flavors are a little spiced and slightly boozey. The body is surprisingly crisp despite the roundness of the flavors. The beer has an aftertaste that is dark fruit sweetness...very rich, but still light. Crisp and light finish, with a slight drying effect at the end. Very strong production, and a very tasty, well balanced brew."
"Dark amber/dark brown body with a thin, creamy off-white head. Good retention and slight lacing throughout. Smells of caramel, a touch of brown sugar, and a slightly fruity sweetness... all malty sweetness and not much for hops. The taste follows and adds a bit of earthy hops but well balanced and not overly sweet. Full body, medium carbonation, and a smooth finish. Overall this was a great dopple- easy drinking and alcohol is well hidden."
"Could use more carbonation to bring out some of the nuances. Not a bad, not a great beer."
"Malty goodness without being an indiscriminate malt/ABV bomb."
"The mouthfeel is nice enough, it's got a decent amount of carbonation and is fairly thick. The drinkability is quite good for the ABV. Overall, this is an alright beer. Not the best I've had, but surely servicable, especially for an easy drinking high ABV kick. Not up to the level I expect from Bell's though."
"It pains me to say this was not at all enjoyable. Even one of the best breweries in America can sometimes miss badly, as Bell's has with their doppelbock. Hopefully next year's batch will be better."
"O: A decent drinkable beer. Nothing special but still enjoyable."
"I will buy this again, but of the two doppelbocks that I have had, i'm not sure if I prefer this over the Troegs one.."
"Very solid Doppelbock, really enjoyed the breadiness."
"O- Overall a very enjoyable beer with a nice flavor profile. Drinks lighter than the 8%."
"Consecrator pours a reddish, brown color with a nice off-white head. The foam fades fairly quickly, but leaves some thin lace. Clear, light doppelbock. The aroma is very malty, a very nice flavor profile. Toffee or caramel, some brown sugar. Flavor has some raisin or other fruit, and all the same tastes as smells. Toffee and brown sugar or molasses. Just bitter enough to keep the sweetness in check. Nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is medium moving towards full, with a good amount of carbonation. Overall I was really happy to get to try this one. A lot like a brown, but pushed a bit. No compaints, but there are better Doppelbocks out there."
"The aroma is some bready and spiced malts and creamy caramel, which follows into the flavors with a roasty toffee and a handfull of fig and date like fruit flavors. I expected more punch from this one, but everything is really creamy and light overall, could use some more viscosity and spices to hit the mark closer, but is a decent Dopplebock. I wish they would just Eis this thing."
"Overall: Subtle and elegant Doppelbock. Very nice flavor profile, even though it is fairly mild. Relative lack of aroma is the biggest detriment."
"Overall I was really impressed with Bell’s version of this style that is not my favorite. It seemed a bit more tame than a lot of other bocks and had a lot of brown ale like characteristics, but turned up a bit. This is a pretty interesting American take on the style."
"O: I like the beer alright but it isn't the best representation of the style or the best representation of Bell's Brewery"
"I recommend trying this beer at least once, it's a winner. If it was $11 for a 6 pack instead of $17, I'd probably keep this in my fridge a lot. (hint, hint, Bells)"
"Overall this was a pretty good Doppelbock. Everything was balanced pretty well and spot on for the style. My only critique is that it came off a little thin for it's style and could have been a little thicker. This beer had great drinkability, it went down smooth and did a fairly good job at downplaying it's 8%. I have been trying some different Doppelbock's lately and so far this one has been my favorite, I thought this beer was better then Maximator. I would buy a six pack of this to keep around for a while, if you like Doppelbock's you have to try this one, it gives some German ones a run for their money. Its nice to see another quality brew from Bell's and one that can hold its own against its traditional German counterparts."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown with very fleeting wispy head. Lights scents of sweet bready malts and hints of red fruit. Simple, pleasing tastes of deep caramel malts with slightly sour cheers and a pleasant mild bitter bite. Refreshing and very sessionable at the abv. A nice simple to drink beer."
"O- Overall a solid Doppelbock and one that I would reach for again if I was in the mood for the style."
"O-its sweet and malty with some spice taste like a mild dubbel to me it ok but will not buy this one again..."
"O - Not a bad beer, good example of the style."
"D- Overall, not too bad. Not my favorite Bell's Beer but one that I would definitely consider again when I am in the mood for a nice malty brew. Worth a shot."
"This is a smooth drinking doppelbock. I would put it between Great Lakes and Sam Adams in my preferences."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Nice mahogany/burgundy color. A slight head that dissipated quickly. The smell is slightly sweet & malty with a hint of fruit. First taste is sweet and malty with some caramel. Some dried fruits and molasses that finishes with a little alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected but very nice. Easy to drink. Overall a very good beer."
"OVERALL: I'm not normally a fan of Doppelbock's, but this is not bad at all. It reminds me a little of Goose Island's Pere Jacques, but toned down in the sweetness department and in the carbonation department. A plus for the former a minus for the latter."
"This is an easy drinking beer, but the sweetness may little the number that you have."
"O: Overall, loved it - different than I expected, but being fairly new to dopplebacks, didn't have a lot to go on. Had a hoppy contender prior and this was a sweet release. overall, I'd say it's just a hair too sweet to be perfect, but was extremely enjoyable, and think that it would be foolish not to try again, especially if the brew date is more recent."
"D- A pretty good beer although expensive at $8/glass where I was. That kept me from having more."
"This is a solid doppelbock, though a touch on the sweet side. I'd happily drink more of it, if there weren't a few widely available ones that are markedly better."
"O - Easy drinking....good tasting. I guess I was expecting more. This is no Celebrator....as that is my benchmark for this style. I was hoping it would be closer. Nonetheless....certainly not a beer I would refuse or not enjoy."
"Notes: Good but not great doppelbock. Plenty of raisin, etc. dark fruit. I could work through a six pack over a couple of weeks, but nothing I would actively seek out. A six pack a year would suffice."
"T: Brown sugar, caramel and some freshly baked bread. The balance in this beer is pretty good and it's sweet without being overly so. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style."
"D-wow. So drinkable. Solid brew"
"D - Very drinkable. The alcohol is hidden well in this. I really enjoyed drinking this. A good, not great doppelbock"
"Aftertaste is mostly malty grape, cloying with a heavy coating especially on the palate. Light effervescence, medium body. Decent but not great."
"Medium bodied with a slightly roasted caramel malt flavor. Hints of chocolate, hazelnut and a prominent spice presence. Lots of pepper, cinnamon and brown sugar as well as some subtle clove flavor. Dry finish."
"This ties directly into the taste, though i get an interesting grape juice taste that cheapens the overall complexity of the flavor. Definitely malty, and with all of the fruity and sugar from the nose. Medium body, and overall a quite drinkable brew that can be well paired with a good meal."
"This was very good. The taste almost made me think that the beer could be aged for a few months, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. I would drink it again if I didn't have to trade to get it."
"This was a very nice dopplebock, one that was very easy to drink. Would definitely drink again."
"Drinkability: Almost perfect, in my book. Great beer for the cold spring leading to a warm summer."
"Pours from a 12oz bottle into a dimpled mug. A burnt caramel color with a pretty creamy head and nice staying power. Big caramel nose with a little bit of apple and brown sugar. Taste is rich caramel with just a slight hint of the apple and warming alcohol. A sweetness with a bit of dry finish. Nice and creamy mouthfeel but could be more."
"This elixer goes down VERY well. My hat is off to you Bell's!"
"M/D-This is a thick and rich beer (like most Doppelbocks IMO), but not overbearing. Really drinkable. This is a tough style for me since I'm not a huge fan, but this beer really made an impression. Once again Bells impresses me."
"This was nice, but not one of Bell's standouts in my opinion. Quite drinkable but lacks uniqueness."
"second doppelbock in my wurzburger chalice tonite, this one being way different from the first (dark horse coffee dopplebock). this brew screams toffee and grape on the nose, its very potent at first but i grow to love it more an more each time i bring it to my lips. this challice really does dopplebocks justice, they just look appealing. the head isnt much, and clears out fairly quickly but a nice swirl brings it back a bit and it tastes nice as it infuses the toffee flavors into each sip. the carbonation is sharp and welcome as i feel it helps the flavors of toffee grape and rasins set themselves on your tongue. im thoroughly enjoying this beer and just wish i had more. its a great representation of the style."
"Pours dark amber with a light fluffy off-white creme head. First taste is of bready sweetness. The sweetness hangs around all the way through the tasting. Chewy mouthfeel. I felt that this was a good representation of the style but not overly memorable."
"In the taste I'm getting raisin sweetness and cherry. Pretty full in body and oily slick... No alcohol burn in the end... Perhaps just a faint warmth. Leaves the palate a bit dry."
"This actually reminds me of some oktoberfests I've had because of the toasted quality to it, and that the heaviness of the malts is toned down a bit compared to other doppelbocks. Tastes very German for this reason. Very tasty, though. Easy to put back."
"Consecrator pours a rusty brown color, with spots of ruby shining through upon the beer being backlit. A 2.5-3 finger khaki colored head rises up in my glass, but retention is just average and there is zero lacing to speak of. The nose is surprisingly fruity. There's a hint of caramel and roasted nuttiness for sure, but fruits are the dominant influence. Those same comments apply to the flavor as well. Caramel and roasted nuts show up, but fruits steal the show. Some of the same fruits as I might find in a Dubbel or Belgian Strong Dark Ale come to mind (plums, raisins, etc...) but they're a little bit less dark and rich and a bit more sweet and mild. The carbonation is well done, it does its job wthout getting in the way of all the malty flavors. I found the body to be just a hair on the thin side though, especially for a beer style that was known as a meal in a glass. Consecrator is a solid offering from Bell's, but nothing outstanding."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a reddish brown with a one finger off-white to tan head. There was no lacing evident througout. The aroma was comprised of yeasty malt, dark chocolate, and slight cream. The flavor was of bread, sweet malt, grapes, and a hint of raisin. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this honestly reminded me of malty grape juice. With that said, I don't really know how I feel about this one at all. I think that if it would have been toned back on the grape a little bit this could have been a good brew. This would allow more of the flavors to come forward rather than taking a backseat to the grape."
"D - Easy drinking, but Doppelbock is such an enjoyable style, so that is no surprise."
"Well made beer that when I shared with a fellow beer lover, he remarked, ""This could be German"""
"A chill hazed medium brown colored beer without much head formation what there is of it is tan. The smell is sweet and nutty with a big roasted grain aroma. There is a slight soy sauce aroma and a grain husk and yeast scent. The flavor begins sweet and fairly grassy and grainy with a figs and oak after taste. Fairly thick there is a quite strong grain hull flavor here and it is quite astringent in the mouth. Fairly nutty in taste this tastes the most like pecans. The bitterness is present and fairly laid back for a bock beer this is very much a malty beer and not a hoppy one. Soy sauce scent doesn't make it in to the taste thank god."
"At 8% abv, I thought it might be kind of boozy; it isn't. I picked up a six pack so I could hit a ""want"" as an extra in a trade, not knowing what to expect of the beer. I split a bottle with an old friend over cigars & other beers. I was surprised at how tasty it was & how well it held up to the cigar. Now that I've had a bottle on a fresh palate, I'm all the more impressed."
"Flavorful up front, clean in the end and extremely drinkable. Yep, this brew tastes German in comparison to many of the sweet, alcoholic malt bombs that Americans interpret the style to be. Horns up to Bell's for keepin' it real."
"D - I could have a few of these."
"Pours a clear bright amber color with a quickly fading, almost non-existent whitish head. Aroma is carmel malt, bready and biscuity as expected for the style, but lacking any depth. Taste is exceptionally sweet, with dark malts and fruits dominating and a light nutty and toasty finish. Average medium body with low carbonation. This wasn't bad, I just expect more from Bells, and this was a fairly pedestrian beginner's doppelbock."
"Rich, creamy honey-buttered brown bread on the flavor. Full bodied and sweet, with a dusting of toast and hops on the finish. I could see this one becoming cloying, but right now it is tasting pretty good. ABV is well hidden behind the chewy malt texture. I must say, I am surprised at the relatively low score this one gets. I think it is a pretty satisfying, malty-sweet doppelbock. I would buy this again, no problem."
"Another plus for Bells brewery who in my opinion is one of the best breweries in the US."
"Cheers!"
"CHEERS!!"
"D: Actually finding this to be a quite enjoyable dopplebock, full of flavor but the aroma and body lacks substance. Solid beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Not too many noticeable ""turnoffs"" to make it hard to have again. A very basic but exceptional (according to style) beer from Bells."
"D: A sort of uninteresting beer, to be honest, which is not something I usually say about a Bell's beer. Very sweet, as well, too much so for me."
"Drinkability-The fact that this is not overly sweet really makes this beer quite drinkable.ABV is well hidden for 8%."
"Good stuff. Nice malt flavor and enjoyable noticeable hops. Another great offering from Bell's."
"A dark brassy copper color with a decent oatmeal colored head and fair lacing. The aroma brings a mash malt and seaweed rhubarb that's tangy and interesting. The flavor bangs out intense, almost saltwater malt with an herbal hop and rye hint. There's a mellow licorice sweetness and raisin idea. Add some bright citrus notes for good measure! There's just a little alcohol notable but the flavor dominates and is quite pleasing. It's solidly mid-bodied with spritely but modest carbonation that is fairly drinkable considering the intensity here, but you wouldn't want to pound these, there's too much complexity to enjoy. The feel is tangy but smooth, slightly resinous but not very thick, just right for enjoying and drinking. This is surprisingly tasty and drinkable. Another example of why the Bells toll for you..."
"Drinkability is alright. This is a decent beer, but it is a bit too sweet and there isn't much going on. A little bit one dimensional. With all of the other great beers Bell's produces I would probably just skip over this one."
"Sweet, smooth, medium bodied, with low carbonation. A nice beer, which is a little sweeter than I would like, but still good."
"Drinkability: Nice, smooth, and drinkable, but I like my higher ABV beers to have some bite. Not bad, but it could use some work to really get me into it."
"D: The alcohol never seems to creep up, even as it warms. A bit too sweet to have more than one, however."
"This is a fairly good brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Flavours are right but just lacks a bit of intensity. However this is a solid doppelbock."
"Pours a darkish reddy brown with a quick dying tan head. Large sweet caramel malt along with hints of bread, chocolate and roasted and a minor bit of hops and fruit. A little husky and dry, chewey, has a good sweet malt base and is a little biscuity as well. Tea-like fruit hops like grape on backend for a dry finish. Slightly offbalance but still an enjoyable beer."
"This is definitely one of my favorite dopplebocks that I have tried."
"S- The aroma is nice and malty with some bready malt ans caramel and a faint touch of hops. Not out of this world but pretty solid so far."
"D- Overall, not too shabby. Not my favorite Bell's Beer but one that I would definitely consider again when I am in the mood for a nice malty brew. Worth a shot."
"Cheers Eric!"
"This has aged well. Pours a cloudy mahogany with a thin tan head. Nose bready has malts, cocoa, toffee, pecans. Taste has sweet nutty malts and peppery yeast. Creamy body is well carbonated. Nice beer, Bells is one of the best breweries in teh world."
"Drinkability? This tastes, looks, feels, and smells good. A good interpretation of the style and one I'm enjoying. So naturally, it has good quaffability, eh?"
"d: The more I drank, the less I liked this. It just doesn't have the nuances that better examples of the style have. Hotter and drier than it should have been."
"Very yummy bock. I could definitely drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Pours a medium brown color, with just a suggestion of off-white foam. Aromas of malt, rye bread and brown sugar. Lightly sweet and malty on the palate, with slight carbonation and a bit of citrus late. A pretty solid dopplebock and one I'd gladly drink again."
"D: Actually finding this to be a quite enjoyable dopplebock, full of flavor but the aroma and body lacks substance. Solid beer nonetheless."
"Excellent! Reminiscent of Dogfish Head Raison D' Etre on tap."
"D - Above average drinkability. I really enjoy malty beers, especially doppelbocks. This was a very nice take on the style on this side of the Atlantic that I haven't seen replicated very much. Nice work on this Bell's."
"I got this in a trade with fear025. I poured from a 12 ounce glass into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a deep orange with ruby highlights, very thin head, no lace. The aroma is fruity, malty and sweet. On first sip the beer is full of dark fruit, and a bit boozey. It is on the sweeter side, but not overly so. The beer is full bodied and moderately carbonated. IMO a solid doppelbock."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again if it were more readily available to me in NYC. I recommend this to those seeking a solid Doppelbock that is full of malt and dark fruit but light in body."
"Drinkability: It's not bad. The high alcohol content knocks it down slightly for me, but it's pretty good."
"If you go in thinking Octoberfest, it's a pretty darn good interpretation - similar to a Paulaner O-fest, for instance - slightly sweeter, with a discernible alcohol kick in the finish. Yeah, I wasn't really feeling the doppelbock here, but still enjoyable."
"Notes - Medium mouthfeel"
"k just kidding, but really this beer is just not very interesting too me, i prefer Butthead Doppelbock from Tommyknocker's (the most pleasant surprise of this month for me)."
"D: A very nice brew, although it's a little sweeter than what I usually drink. This might make it difficult to drink several of."
"M/D - Full body but not sticky. Alcohol is slightly warming but otherwise very well hidden. Drinkability is high for the style, though my comparisons are few I expect some may be hot. Overall good beer, at 8% though watch out."
"Drinkability - Pretty good. A bit too sweet in an odd way (I enjoy sweeter dopplebocks) but something about this came across as ""too"" sweet/rich. Glad to try it but not my favorite example of the style."
"pours a rubyish amber color with some light fluffy tan head, as well as some light lacing. lots and lots of carbonation with a very souribitter taste. hints of something not sure what that give it a bit of a fruity taste and smell. feels almost like a soda but not in a bad way. i really enjoyed this beer and how different (in a good way) that it was."
"Nice, smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Tons of heavy bready malts, Belgian like yeast(bottle says lager yeast). ABV isn't even detectable at 8%. Picking up some caramel notes, but flavor overall is a little light for a doppelbock. It's good, not great. Medium body, but not complex. A solid, good beer...like most beers from Bells!"
"Overall, this is a nice take on the style but was a bit of a let down by Bell's very high standards. It's not quite as complex or as powerful as a doppelbock has the potential to be, but it's an interesting and nice-drinking beer all the same."
"Nice doppleboack and maybe the best I have had since Celebrator. Not as good but I liked it. It was a dark brown with charred malts flavor some sweet molasses tatse. Nice beer"
"this is one delicious beer. the sweetness gets to be too much after about two of these though."
"Pours a pretty transparent mahogany with a decent light yellowish-beige head. Aroma is malty and strongly spicy, mainly of cloves and cinnamon. Pleasantly spicy flavor is mainly of cloves and malt with a hint of caramel. Texture is very smooth, a bit thick, edgy and rather fizzy."
"D: Not impressed. A lot of people talk Bell's up but I cannot think of a single beer of theirs that I love. I have to put them at the top of my list of most overrated craft breweries."
"A very pleasant malt bomb. Plenty of dark fruit, alcohol, and molasses flavor."
"Overall this is a nice doppelbock. It's a little sweeter than what I prefer, but not bad. With an 8% ABV I don't know that I would want to drink too many of them, but it is a good one to sit back on a hot summer night and enjoy one with some friends."
"D: Easy to drink. The lingering sweetness does take a bit away from drinkability."
"Reviewed from my notes, based on a bottle provided by sigma23 and also split with deltatauhobbit. This bottle is at least a year old, perhaps two. The beer is dark amber with some light brown aspects as well. The tan head was a few centimeters thick, but disappeared quickly. It has a great toasted malt aroma. There is some brown sugar in there as well. It's all very robust. I can taste some sweet malt, some brown sugar and a bit of the alcohol. There may be some plum in there as well. It's a very tasty combination. It has a heavy body and low levels of carbonation. There's plenty of mouth coating with some alcohol vapors present. I find it to be pretty drinkable on a per glass basis. I wouldn't want to drink too many of these in an evening, but this single pour is very enjoyable."
"Pours a murky, muddy coppery brown color with no head, lacing or retention. Smell is of sweet carmel malts, roasted nuts, brown sugar and hints of plum. Taste is carmely sweet at first sip, mellowing out to nutty, pruney, rasiny and slight brown sugary and biscutiy profile with a decent amout of bittering hops on the end. Medium to full bodied, slick and oily on the palate, lacking carbonation. Not a bad beer because it manages to avoid being cloyingly sweet, but nothing too memorable compared to others in the style."
"D: easy although it is kind of like carbonated sugar water in consistency."
"Good beer with a lot going on. Despite the high ABV I could easily put down a few of these."
"Toasted malty aroma with a hints or raisins and plums. No hops or dieacetyl are evident. Medium sized dark tan head fades quickly to a thin film. Glowing dark brown beer with ruby highlights. Rich malty flavor is mildly sweet. Plum and dark sugar flavors peak their head in later on. A very slight bitterness cut the sweetness in the finish, but that bit of hops never threatens the malt dominance. There is a pleasant warming in my chest from the alcohol. Moderately carbonated with a fairly full body, but the sweetness never becomes overbearing. A great example of the style."
"I was really into doppelbocks last year and though the price on this one was up there, I figured I'd give it a shot. I don't regret buying it, but would recommend future tasters to keep an eye out for a single bottle, as a six-pack isn't worth the price."
"Pours a clear, red color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, pale malt, and slight hop. Fits the style of a Doppelbock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with a low carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, pale malt, slight hop, and a slight hint of citrus. Overall, a good blend, body, and aroma."
"Overall this decent, but nothing special."
"(D)- Just what you would expect from a good dopplebock; rich & malty. This one delivers. My only complaint is how syrupy it feels 3/4 of the way through the bottle. It tastes great, but is rather filling. Still, a solid example of the style."
"D - Solid Dopplebock overall, though perhaps a tad too sweet overall. With that said, I found this to be a very good representation of the style with a round, chewy mouthfeel."
"But I have found the way to drink it. Quickly. I know, it's expensive, like a sipper, but you never had a better tasting guzzler. And it goes down extremely well. What a great aftertaste. Indulge yourself. Excuse me while I chug a half a glass of this."
"Where's the malty richness? Bah humbug. This beer isn't offensive, but it is pretty boring."
"I was able to drink this fairly quickly, the alcohol does not come out at all except for a very small hotness which is barely detectable. I would not mind going for another bottle and soon."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's definitely an easy drinking doppelbock. it's relatively light with some good malt flavors making it a pretty good drinking beer."
"It tasted lake malty raisins, a bit on the sweet side. But there again was the cough medicine. I'm not a total snob, so I'll finish what I bought, but won't be replenishing or serving it to guests."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is full and rich, no burn from the alcohol only some flavor. This is a dangerously smooth drinking doppelbock that can certainly warm days in the ides of March."
"Pours a clear dark ruby brown with nearly two fingers of foamy ecru head that quickly dissipates into a surface murk and leaves webby halos of lacing behind. The smell is of raisins, dark malts, figs, vanilla, almonds, plums, and even some subtle raspberries. The taste leads with a figgy maltiness, then pushes into a light molasses with an alcohol warmth, and finishes with a cola-like flavor. The body is lightly medium, with nicley low carbonation, a silky smooth texture, and a crisp finish. All told, a delightfully tasty and drinkable brew."
"Has a medium body, good carbonation, and for an 8% beer, its pretty drinkable"
"D-quite tasty with some nice dark fruits. I little boozy and warms slightly in the back; not quite"
"A very tasty beer and definitely one to be tried."
"My first words were, ""This seems like something you could drink all day."" I'm not sure if my descriptions are doing justice to how juicy, sweet, enjoyable, and deeply complex--but above all extremely drinkable--this beer is. Fantastic."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: This beer has weight but is not too heavy. It has good carbonation and really goes down smooth."
"Pours a deep red color, quite lovely. The taste is really smooth with a noticeable maltiness. A sweet, tart flavor rounds out the finish. All in all, very drinkable, but no bold flavors, nothing over the top. For 8% abv, this beer goes down VERY easily."
"Notes: very nice dopplebock. a little bit more hopped than a traditional db it seems but still very malty and easy drinking. good alcohol kick to boot"
"This was a let down for me from Bell's, considering the price and other available options."
"Drinkability is good, not the greatest doppelbock out there but a very solid example."
"drinkability - this beer was hard to get down - a sipper that should have been a drain pour but @ $16 a sixer manned my way through"
"The strange flavors grow on you as the bottle goes on, and it actually masks the alcohol fairly well. This isn't terrible, just a little strange at times."
"Drinks get, awesome texture to a beer, smooth."
"D - This is a good beer and I could see myself drinking more than one."
"Make no mistake, this is no Aylinger doppelbock, just an OK beer. Better when it warms up."
"I'm a fan of Bell's and dig a lot of their beers. IMO this beer is much better than the average rating. If you like Dopplebocks, try it. You won't be dissapointed. If your a stout fan, I highly recommend their Expedition Stout which is fantastic."
"Drinkability: I can see how people might like this, but I think it's nothing special. Too simple and boring if you ask me."
"Taste is malt with some hops in the back ground. The only thing that keeps this from being a pretty good beer is that it is a little too sweet. I say that even though I find myself enjoying beers on the sweeter side. This beer is so sweet I find it rich."
"D - Pretty drinkable. A bit sweet, so not something I could have more than one of. While I like sweeter beers, this kind of coats your mouth. I'd finish with this beer as it could alter the taste of other beers due to its sweetness."
"O: Overall, I'm disappointed at Bells. I've come to expect excellent beers from this brewery, and...for the style, this beer simply doesn't make the cut. The fact that I paid a lot for it too, makes me mad...as I could of had Ayinger Celebrator (the best) for the same price."
"Drinkability is OK but a bit one sided and a little too much sweetness. There are better doppelbocks available but this isn't bad."
"why such a low avg score?"
"Overall, a solid offering from Bell's. I'm not the hugest fan of this, and I've had many better Doppelbocks, but this is still a very good beer."
"Overall, a pretty solid doppelbock. A tad on the sweeter side, though."
"Perhaps I have been spoiled by other dopplebocks, most notably Celebrator which I had along side this. I would consider this a few steps below it."
"Pours a reddish brown with a nice ruby hue when held to light. Smallish bubbly tan head dissipates quickly. Holy malt aroma Batman! Lots of Molasses and toffee, and burnt sugar. Raisins and some other dark dried fruits and a touch of alcohol. Very little if any hops present in the aroma. Taste is more of the molasses caramel and burnt sugars. You think its going to be sweet, but there's just enough hops and alcohol in there to pound that malt back down. Finishes with a lingering prune/raisin finish. Thick body with a light carbonation and a syrupy mouthfeel. That's a pretty damn good Dopplebock. Bell's continues to impress me with every beer I get to try."
"Consecrator reminds me of Germany's highly-rated Andechser doppelbock, with as much oomph and gooey sweet deliciousness as that one. I'd call this beer severely underrated at the mere ""B/Good"" rating it currently has here. Another fine, fine beer from Bell's."
"Overall: The mouthfeel of the beer is very smooth and slightly carbonated. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is also medium. This is another descent beer from Bell. It has a rich in depth flavor that is encompassing. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability is lowered by the sweetness. Not horrible, but it gets almost a bit cloying."
"Mouthfeel: Medium to thin bodied with a slightly dry finish."
"Clear dark amber with a fine sand colored head. Dark fruit, brandy and chocolate make up the mild nose on this one. Sweet roasty malt, raisin, pumpernickel breadiness and just a touch of warming alcohol in the finish. Mildly carbonated and medium bodied. Easy to drink but tastes more like a Marzen/Oktoberfest than most great Dopplebocks I've had before."
"D- Very drinkable in my opinion despite the ABV. The lack of an alcohol taste allows this to be more than a sipper."
"Sweet!"
"Drinkability: It's a great beer that's got a lot going on -- I really dig the sweetness and I especially like the chewy body. It goes great with food and compliments the strong German cuisine that I was fortunate enough to get to eat with it. The ABV is a bit high, but hey, when you're eating it with food it sits a little easier. I think if I was just drinking it at the end of the day or at a bar, I would definitely have to go easy and be sure to drink some water with it (unless I wasn't driving, then I wouldn't really care)."
"Drinks pretty easy for the abv, but reminds me more of a strong English Ale or a wee heavy than a bock, not near as good as I hoped..."
"D-Good, but not the greatest dopplebock. It's refreshing on one hand, complex and interesting on the other, fuller hand."
"D- The achohol is hidden very well, wouldnt have more than 2 in a row though."
"Purchased from Ray's Liquor in Wauwatosa, WI. Pours a medium amber color with a thin white head. Bready aroma, medium bodied with a very sweet carmel flavor. Cloying finish with some warm alcohol feel. Nice to try one bottle but I don't need another until next Spring."
"Drinkability - dangerously drinkable, goes down very easily."
"Yummy. Very drinkable beer. Would love to have more. This might do well with some age, not too long I think."
"D: Fruity and delicious. The alcohol is well hidden, and the flavor is subtle and complex.. Definitely a Winner."
"This is a weird one, for me. Thanks to Loki for this in trade. Pours a rustic, reddish/pinkish. Almost rusty, from what little brown there is. Quick swirl of carbonation that quickly fades down. Smells like... caramel? Like a Werther's, almost. Weird. A bit of grassiness and malt, but overall the smell is pretty subdued. A boozey blast from the smell, too. Taste is very syrupy, especially going down. Some more caramel and some sweet toasty malts. Just a bit of the hop kick, but by this point the syrupyness has re-asserted itself. Not that big in body, thin for a doppelbock. It's definitely coating, but in the wrong way. Also tastes boozey at first, but it turns out to be very drinkable. I don't know what the cost runs for this, but I suspect there are better options out there."
"Not my favorite Doppelbock, but one that I wouldn't mind drinking, from time to time."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden brown color, some carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with lots of caramel. Medium body. drinkable, this is a tasty brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Drinakability: Very high - this is a great example of the style, and very accessible for people who like dopplebocks or those who are just getting into them. Solid!"
"Medium body for mouthfeel. Huge body for flavor. I'm ready for it to come out next season."
"Poured slightly chilled into pils glass (all I had that was clean)...a nice, clear, dark copper over rocky head that lasted a short time, with some carmel-colored lacing that faded quickly. Smell of malt, sweet, hint of grain but very light. Taste was again malt sweetness, good balance of hops though no bitterness detected, nor was there much of an alcohol taste despite 8% ABV. Mouthfeel was smooth and fairly drinkable again despite it's 8 percent. A good beer!"
"Beautiful clear dark amber. Smallish head but lasting lace. Smells like a maple syrup jelly bean (would I kid you?). Awesome. Tastes like one too :) Oh. Just kidding, I guess. It tastes exactly like it smells but it's hard to qualify that smell. There's tiny carbonation bite - which is fine and in style. There's a little residual bitterness. Also fine. It's sweet. I get brown sugar (the nice organic kind - not just cheap no-brand crap). There is a little musty malt to the aroma. And, yeah, you get malts in the mouth, too. Melanoidin. Well, that or decoction :) I suppose that's the dominant flavor - a Munich/decoction thing. Very good for the style - pretty much right on everywhere. Kudos!"
"Thanks for the extra abbddull!"
"D - For a Dopplebock I enjoy the sweet malt but I think the sweetness goes too far on this one. Its borderline too much in the drinkability department. Not enough balance."
"Dark copper brown with a nice head after an aggressive pour. Smell is very sweet. Lots of honey, brown sugar, raisins and . Taste is of bread and bananas with some yeast. Mouthfeel is nice but the beer is just too sweet. It seems to be big for no real reason. I would prefer a little more subtle and drinkable beer for the style. Pretty decent, but there are other better, and for me, more accessible examples of the style."
"Future outlook: Bocks like this are interesting changes of pace for me, but certainly outside of my preferences. Hard for me to knock any aspect too much, though nothing about it really wowed me. Would be worth a revisit specifically as a change of pace, but not something I'm likely to seek out any time soon."
"Too sweet for my taste, it kills the drinkability."
"D. Has a sweet flavor that hides the alchohol, which makes it very easy and enjoyable to drink."
"D: A good, solid doppelbock but a far cry from the best in the style."
"This is a very nice beer and worth a try. It did well to make me want to look into doppelbocks more as a style."
"Enjoyable and complex. Didn't rock my world, but above average."
"Bell’s Consecrator Dobbelbock demonstrates clearly what M. Jackson described as a ""moreish beer."" It is impossible to take a single sip and not return to the glass almost immediately. As the ABV suggests, this is not a session beer, but if you need to loosen up a bit, or are seeking a little comfort and warmth, this is the perfect beer. The beer has a beautiful mouth-feel that lingers. It pours a dark, dense brown with an intensely contrasting, compact head. While the hops are restrained and the malt forward and enveloping it is well balanced. This Dobbelbock is a perfect meal replacement during lent. It is also a fine companion for meals that we may seek when weary and hungry. This beer can stand up to the richest of dishes, but is also a fine beer when you need to round out your meal with a touch of hops and full-malty richness. I would also sip it as an after-dinner alternative."
"Way drinkable for an 8% beer, and way drinkable for a doppelbock. The light mouthfeel and slight hop balance go a long way on this."
"With the mild flavor profile and a hidden abv, this guy is pretty easy to drink."
"The last time I had this beer was just shy of 20 years ago. I remember it being a lot more bold back then, but maybe my expectations have evolved :-)."
"D: Great, a good beer to introduce someone into the more complex world of brews."
"Drinkability: A definite malt bomb. The sweetness int he finish lingers long, making this an easy drinking, yet flavorful beer."
"I am a big fan of many beers from Bell's and this one was new to me. When it came I got a distinct malty smell. The color was really deep and rich with very little head. However, I found the flavor to not be quite to my liking. I lean more toward a strong, bitter, hoppy flavor. This beer was a little sweeter than I tend to like and more malty. It was great to sample, but I doubt I try this again. On the other hand, my wife loved it as this is more of her style of beer."
"Overall, not the best doppelbock out there. Nothing too drinkable. Something from bells I won't be buying again."
"Quite drinkable for a doppelbock. Alcohol is not discernable. Given how tasty it is, I could easily enjoy several of these in one sitting."
"Nice dark amber pour with thin head. Smells are malty and sweet. It has a nice smell. Taste is heavy with malt and very sweet up front. The sweetness fades and you get some alcohol in the back of the throat. Not a bad beer. I'm not a huge fan of this style but I rather enjoyed this one."
"Nose is tough to describe. German malts with yeast which has a bready, paper twang to it. Smooths out and gets creamy as it warms. Nice buttery mouthfeel. 8 percent is well hidden. Good but not one of my favorite Bells brews."
"D- this one didnt do it for me. the huge level of carbonation and the rather bland flavors just didnt work for me. glad i got to try it, but even more glad i didnt buy a sixer and just went with the single. bells can do better than this."
"A good beer to start your journey in dopplebocks."
"Overall this is a great lighter doppelbock from a great brewery."
"D: Very tasty, a bit underrated I'd say, smooth, nicely complex and lighter than it should be. Could stand to be a little darker and stickier in the head and legs though."
"This might be better on tap but it's just not hitting the palate right for me tonight, unusual for Bells."
"D: Eminently drinkable. This is only the second Doppelbock I've reviewed, and enjoyed them both immensely. This seems to be bit heavier in the mouth than the Ayinger Celebrator. This is a good one to drink through the cold months (which, given the release date, will be quite a few in Chicago) and transition to the Ayinger as the weather warms up."
"Overall its fairly easy to drink, and a very interesting beer."
"An OK beer, but far below what I've come to expect from Bell's. Fortunately, I was able to get a fresh glass of two hearted afterwards to wash away the taste of the consecrator."
"Overall, a nice example of the style- smooth and drinkable"
"D: The alcohol on this beer is fairly well hidden and its smooth, balanced sweetness makes it quite easy to indulge."
"D: Easy and smooth for a beer like this. Probably the malt-forward character that helps. We had completely forgotten the 8% alcohol ABV."
"Taste: Caramel flavor from the malts. Dry floral and herbal hop finish."
"Excellent brew!"
"Not Celebrator, but damn good."
"Pours a clear, warm-looking ruby red with a small tan head and extremely fine carbonation slowly drifting up from the bottom. The nose is extremely faint but smells of honey and flowers. The flavor more than makes up for the weak aromas: this tastes of sweet - but not cloying - carmel with rich dark fruits and a slight toastiness that adds greatly to its character. Very nice. I would recommend this beer without hesitation and would definitely buy it again if only it were a bit cheaper."
"D - Very drinkable beer, but not too many in one night due to ABV, but definetly wish this was around alot longer then it is."
"The drink is heavy-medium in body with a tingle of mild carbonation. The body of the drink is silky and firm with a touch of lingering syrup left on the tongue. Good drinkability."
"I remember being blown away by this last year as the first Doppelbock I had ever had. In fact it really changed my way of thinking about lagers, I didn't know they could taste like this. However, after trying many of the best available German import versions this one seems rather pedestrian. Still, it's pretty tasty, just not anywhere near the Germans."
"Very nice and highly sessionable beer, but keep an eye on the ABV!"
"Pretty copper color pour with a two finger tan head that fades quickly. Aroma is sweet malts, toasted caramel, brown sugar,ripe fruits and candy. Flavor is malty,quite sweet, some soft nutty flavors, dark bread, and hints of wood and an odd but good spice in the far aftertaste (almost like saffron). Light alcohol comes through in spots as well. Body is medium to medium-full. There's some lively carbonation keeping things honest. Ends with more caramel, sweet malts, candy,spice. Yummy ! Thank You Bells"
"M/D - a bit too sweet for me, a bit of alcohol warming, this isn't one of my favorite from Bell's, but not bad."
"Tasty, would get this again."
"2008 bottle, so about 9 months on this one. Orange/amber pour, a very small amount of white head. Sweet aromas, malt, toffee and caramel. It is a pretty sweet beer with flavors matching the aroma. Maybe slight raisin along with the sweets. A fair amount of carbonation in this medium bodied brew. There is just enough hops to give a slight kick at the end. To me, this makes it a good version of the style. Could probably use just a bit more hopping, which is unusual to say for a Bell's brew."
"Edit: This brew deserves better than a damn ""B"... especially based solely on style. It is certainly better than most Stateside attempts at the style and in my mind could easily stack up to it's European brothers... very nice and surprisingly drinkable even though I am just savoring every sip."
"Very nice high clarity reddish brown color. Creamy head, about one finger, just enough. Fairly light for a Doppelbock. Overripe fruit aroma, yeast, a little funky and sweet. Taste is similarly sweet, rich malt, malted milk ball, nutty almond or hazelnut. Soft, velvety feel with a fairly disguised abv. Strong and a little less subtle than Celebrator and the like, but it's not bad at all. Drying finish, maybe two tops for me personally."
"The body is too sweet. Although does not have that under-attenuation feel. Carbonation is light but ok. Overall there is something funky going on here in the taste. Almost like a weird yeast, but eh."
"I just had a Consecrator with at least 1.5 years on it and must say it was delicious. It was as described as above but more caramel in the taste. Smooth and silky. I never intended to age this beer but it seems that it does improvew a bit with age."
"Licorice malty sweetness. A bit nutty and a bit fruity. A tinge of bitterness and long, if somewhat unspectacular finish. Not one of the more appetizing flavour profiles I've ever encountered in a Bock. Nothing too bad but altogether a bit disappointing: just too simple and too sweet. Body is medium but I can't help but think it seems a bit lightweight. Not too much to speak of in terms of shape or texture. Average I guess, I've come to expect more from Bell's but you know they can't all be winners."
"Pours a rich amber with a big, solid head, though the head falls surprisingly quickly and leaves no lacing, which was a disappointment. The smell is yeasty and strong. The flavor is yeasty, bready, with a little roasted character and a faintly woody, dark cherry-like accent. The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy, viscous and clingy, but disappointingly flat on the finish. Not a bad beer, though not one I will spend a lot of time with."
"D: I'm enjoying this as a night cap!"
"Overall, a little lame considering it's Bell's. You can't win 'em all."
"This is another good beer from Bells Brewing.... This is the first of this style and I enjoyed it. I can see this being good during a nice hearty dinner or a cold winters night due to the warming from the alcohol."
"Drinkability was pretty good. The sweetness was not overpowering and the alcohol not too harsh. May not be a great Dopplebock, but would do nicely as a winter nightcap or slow sipper."
"Decent, but definitely not my favorite Bell's beer. Worth a try if you like doppelbocks."
"drinkability is good. though a bit boozy for a doppelbock, this brew has good concentration and moderately ample complexity. wonderfully malty and tasty. cheers!"
"Drinkability- I'm sensing strong ale here rather than doppelbock. It was a tasty beer that I wouldn't turn down if offered, just didn't seem to style."
"D- Nothing here to write home about. There are much better Dopplebocks out there than this one. Fairly disappointed by this one."
"Not the best in terms of drinkability. I wouldn't consider this my favorite example of the style or one that I would revisit too frequently. Thankfully Bell's has me covered with plenty of other amazing offerings."
"Drinkability: Wouldn't drink this beer again unless Bells was in my town. It was decent but with so many other options probably won't try this one again."
"Thanks to nmajdan for the opportunity. Pours a rich copper/caramel with great clarity. A small head at first that literally disappears. Carbonation is decent. Smell is fairly weak, grabbing some sweet malty toffeeness and thats about it. Carbonation in the mouth is a bit better. Taste is better than the nose as well. Slightly sweet rich malts, toffee, nuts, and vanilla mingle nicely with some good subtle hops. Aftertaste lingers around for a while and that is always welcomed."
"This a great Dopplebock, very similar to Paulaner's Salvator."
"I haven't had it fresh, but it holds up quite well for being 2 years old. I look forward to trying it again."
"Thanks to dschuster03 for throwing this in as an extra on a trade."
"D - A little to sweet."
"3. to devote or dedicate to some purpose"
"The drinkability is ok but not worth seeking out. Just a good started beer. Prosir, MK"
"D - Milky, smooth, and slightly carbonated."
"D: Tasty enough and would probably do the trick to give me a doppelbock fix. Not the best but worth a shot."
"Pours chestnut with an excellent clarity but little head and no lacing. Aroma is restrained but what is there seems right. Some toasty sweet malt and a bit of yeasty tang. Tastes a bit on the sweet side, but with nice flavors of sweet malt, vanilla, cocoa, raisins, and some toast notes. Smooth and a bit creamy, and quite easy to drink. This is somewhat forgettable, but tasty enough. The lingering cocoa notes redeem this one a bit."
"Recommended..."
"Pours a clear reddish brown color with almost 2 fingers of foamy tan head that fades fairly quickly, leaving a thin ring and blotchy lacing. Smells of toffee, caramel, toasted malt, raisins, and alcohol. Tastes of caramel and not-quite-burnt grain with a fruity grape sweetness, minor notes of citrus in the finish covered up by a strong alcohol presence. Medium in body with good carbonation, smooth and sweet, with some bitterness in the finish, but mostly overshadowed by medicinal alcohol flavor. Not one of my favorite brews from Bell's, needs more sweetness and to take the alcohol down a notch."
"D: I very much enjoyed this brew! I'm going back over my reviews and I think this is my first dopplebock - damn! I've been missing out! I don't really have another to compare against in my experience but from what I've tasted here, I would definitely recommend it."
"I was not impressed"
"Overall- I am not very experienced with the style, but if this is a good representation, I really am not going to ever be a big fan. Not my cup o'tea."
"Purchased at the General Store next to the Eccentric Cafe on my recent trip to Kalamazoo, MI. Batch # 8251 printed on the bottle. Served in my Leute Bok glass. Poured a reddish-brown hue, with ruby highlights accentuated when backlit. Half-inch off-white foamy head dissipated within seconds into a thin skim of foam and bubbles; zero lacing present during the tasting. Scent of malt and dark fruit. Alcohol is fairly up front in the flavor profile, followed by some caramel character and dark fruit. Lively, effervescent mouthfeel with a little astringency present at the finish. Drinkability is fair, but flavor balance was a little off relative to alcohol presence."
"D = This is a drinkable beer but the alcohol is a little too present and the bitterness is a little unpleasant."
"Another awesome style represented very well by Bell's!"
"Reddish Brown with a nice tan head that left a slight lace on the glass. 12 oz serving. This beer is nicely balanced. Very strong malt presence with a nice smooth finish. Hint of molasses with a slight alochol at the finish. Alcohol was not over-powering. A good doppelbock and very drinkable."
"The flavor is fairly enjoyable, and delivers to the palate a ton of candied malts, dark raisins, butter, spice and some bitter hoppage. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, while a warming alcohol note finishes sickly sweet. While this wasn't one of Bell's better offerings, it got the job done as a fairly drinkable Doppelbock."
"Another wonderful brew from Bells!"
"This beer pours to a beautiful, bright, deep amber to red color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent, with lots of good toasty, and nutty malt aroma. The palate is firm, with good nutty and toasty malt flavor, on a very smooth, slick, polished body. Consecrator finishe with more good, firm, toasty and nutty malt up front, then ends with a peppery, alcohol bite that lingers. A good after work beer."
"Not bad, but far from the best I've had. Maybe a bit too syrupy feeling? Pretty good though, style aside."
"D- Not the biggest fan of bocks, but would drink this one again if I found it on tap."
"High cost and ABV hurt drinkability. The almost cloying sweetness doesn't help."
"Overall, this was definitely a nice little bock. I could have drank this one all night and it just seemed to be really well done. For fans of the style, this was definitely a good choice. I would have to recommend this one to anyone who likes a good dark German beer."
"Sampled this at the recent tasting. Pours a clearish maroon color with a short lived head. Smell was smoothly malty, and some dark fruitiness perhaps. Taste was creamy and tart caramel with a medium body and average carbonation. Goes down pretty easily and alcohol is hidden well. Nothing too spectacular, but also not one of my preferred styles."
"M/D - Crisp mouthfeel and goes down easy. Too heavy on the sweet malts to drink alot of."
"One of the most drinkable doppelbocks I've ever had. This sucker just disappeared from my glass. Unlike the big melonoidins and licorice flavors you'd get out of Spaten Optimator, this doppel is much smoother in flavor with sweet, bready, and slightly fruity caramel and toffee malts. There's also a bit more hops to this beer with a slight herbal note in the back of the flavor. The hops seem to add more balance, which along with slightly light for the style body, makes for the easy drinking."
"Man, the cloying (I hate to call it that but that's how it ultimately felt) sticky sweetness of this guy was just too much for me. There was definitley some enjoyable flavors present and the potential for a good Doppelbock was there but this just didn't come together for me at all. A rare miss from Bell's."
"A nice take on the style, shows some character without deviating from the expected too much."
"The body of this beer was a clear, dark copper with a bit of ruby to go with a thin white (slightly) offwhite head. No lacing to speak of and not much active carbonation present. The best showcase here is the taste with a rich buttery caramel flavor. This is well balanced from top to bottom in terms of taste, although a tiny bit watery in texture. Very good, but you would expect nothing less from Bell's."
"D- It's a nice Spring drinker. It's a bit full to consider drinking more than a couple, but tasty enough to enjoy more than one."
"This poured a clear, dark ruby red with tan head. It smelled like earthy malt, muddy caramel, refined yeast, and some floral hops. It tasted like bitter cherries mixed with a blend of caramel and milk chocolate malts. It was oily with slight carbonation and a lasting sweet caramel aftertaste. Overall this was a very tasty, sweet and smooth beer. It was almost too drinkable for its high alcohol content, a dangerous combination!"
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew a lot but its not my favorite style"
"Very drinkable, even though the overall package and flavor does not overwhelm"
"This is a good doppelbock, and a good beer overall - it has all the right elements. Pair with a sweet meal or a buttery cheese, if you feel so inclined, but it's fine on its own as well."
"The pour was a nice ruby red with a tan one finger head into a tulip glass straight from the tap. It smelled of fruits, spices, and caramel. A lot of flavors came through on this beer. I was able to pick out: dates, raisins, and caramel with a slight sour feel and an alcoholic after note. This beer was drinkable, but not a session beer for me. The mouthfeel was average. Nothing really hit me."
""
"Mouthfeel is not as full as I would expect. Alcohol a bit more apparent than it should be. A year or so in the cellar would certainly develop some more complexity and smoothness."
" This beer surprised me starting with a sample I went for the full pint. This is an ass kicker @ 10% alc content it hides it very well and almost no alcohol is present on the pallette. Hints of honey,Malty, slight hop after taste..very well done ..This is a Bock and a Double at that. It taste more like a strong amber or double amber from Bell's along the same taste. I see where this beer is getting negative reviews in the bottle but if you get a chance try it on draft DO IT..start with a sample then go for the pint if you like it. Me ,personally I love it and had another pint..OOHH yea I felt a little wobbly after those 2 pints of 10% but hey I didn't even notice until I got up from the barstool! CHEERS!"
"I poured this interesting beer intomy tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was reddish blond color with a yeasty smell. The taste was slighly sour which I do not care for at all. The alcohol I thought was overpowering deminishing any taste the beer could impart on the palat. I will not buy again but will stick to the other fine Bell's products I like."
"M/D: i know this beer gets relatively negative marks, but after 2 bottles its not bad. i did not entirely enjoy the first, but on a second chance i actually quite enjoy this beer, at least the second time around. a third try may result in a different opinion but right now i am really enjoying said doppelbock"
"d: Seems like a pretty average doppelbock. I know the abv says doppel, but the mild aroma and flavor say bock. I expect more from Bell's."
"D-Very smooth and easy to drink. Another fine product from Bell's."
"Certainly worth my while + will be again."
"Full bodied with slightly roasty malt flavors with a bit of caramel. There is some mild bitterness, but the overall beer is still sweet. The alcohol is well hidden. The finish is mostly the dissolving caramel flavor."
"Overall, this is an okay beer but not the best I've had. Give it a shot though."
"Overall: Not recommended. If you want a good doppelbock, there are several other great options that are readily available most places."
"Pours a crisp clear copper with a thin head that diminishes to a slight ring. The aroma was some malts, but a little weak. The taste has lots of caramel, toffee, sweet fruits and a slight biscuit texture. The beer is smooth and medium bodied. This one is enjoyable, but there's better versions of the style out there."
"You can pretty much duplicate that review for the Bell's except there's less bitterness. Bell's is slightly better. But Bell's is also three bucks a six pack more and .8% less ABV. So it's basically a matter of personal preference. I like 'em both just fine."
"I enjoyed this brew but I feel like it doesn't meet normal Bell's standards. A solid selection though I suppose. I know not every beer can be a homerun but I guess I just expected more from one of the best breweries in the country in my opinion."
"Overall I'm slightly disappointed , but this beers worth a try."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, alcohol a little too strong for my liking. Drinkability is so-so, it's not bad but it's also not that good. Seems like a lot of characteristics there that could define the beer, but they all end up fighting each other off and the beer never really shines."
"Drinkability: It seems that Bell's brews are hit or miss with me lately, and this one's surely a miss. I'm glad I only bought one bottle. For a beer that's 8$ and of the style and of course from the brewery I expected a lot more. Hardly and complexity or nuance, and fairly basic, with a lot of examples out there much, much better than this."
"This is a good Doppelbock but not a great one from Bell's. Still, it's worth trying without a doubt."
"I really wanted to like this beer more, since I'm a sucker for a good dopplebock, and I love most of Bell's beers. This just doesn't make the mark for me. Honestly, the best thing about this beer is the gorgeous color in the glass. Other than that, its a bit boring overall... Don't bother seeking it out. Not to say its a bad beer, it just isn't a great dopplebock."
"This pours a dark red with a short-lived pinkish head. It smells of dark malts and vanilla pudding, with hints of dark fruit and piney hops. It's an impressive aroma, with a complexity on par with many great beers I've tried. The flavor isn't nearly as intense as the aroma, or as many doppelbocks I've sampled. It's a tad subdued, to say the least. There are hues of sweet fruit and cloves, and the malt base is nice enough, but it isn't powerful. Hops and vanilla round out the finish, with a lingering sweetbread aftertaste that is quite unique. I lowered the mouthfeel rating because of the heavier-than-necessary carbonation; I feel it detracts a bit from the otherwise smooth texture."
"The taste isn't bad, abetted by a nice, creamy smooth texture, but too understated. Good doppelbock is smooth but bold, drinkable but daring. This balks at the tightrope when it should at least risk it with bolder flavor. The texture is good, again, and the carbonation reflects that despite the lackluster head, the beer holds up well over a little time. Yet this isn't great doppelbock; it borders on fairly good and, from Bell's, I'm a bit disappointed."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Bell's Pint glass. Pours a reddish amber with a decent off white head that stuck around for a while and left a nice lacing down the glass. Smell is a bit weak. Sweet malts, dark fruit and oddly enough tapioca pudding but nothing was very strong. I had to keep smelling the beer to try to pick out individual aromas. Taste is a bit weak also. Dark fruits, a bit of roasted malts and a vanilla finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slight carbonation. A good beer but not in the upper echelon of Bell's repertoire."
"I'm a fan of Bell's in general, but this is not one of their better offerings. Doesn't even come close to the complexity and intensity of malt flavor found in German dopplebocks."
"D- Again, the alcohol is a little noticeable, but overall, this is a pretty subdued beer. Not my favorite for the style, but not a poor showing either."
"Drinkability: Over the course of the evening, I had 2 liters... this was plenty. I was full, but I wasn't falling down either. I recommend Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock."
"D - Meh. I ain't fer it, but I ain't again it neither."
"As the beer warms it brings more of an alcohol taste to it. For me this beer is a definite sipper...maybe after a hearty meal. This beer grew on me. I'd get it again."
"D: one was plenty and all I would want."
"Mollasess in the mouth with carmalized dates underneath. Crisp clean middle and finish that bursts with brown sugar and toffee. Very milky chocolate but light in flavor. Moderate bitterness on the finish yet the sugar of the malts is just a little too much. Not necessarily cloying thoug. Could be a little creamier and I think will gain some complexity with age. Actally I know it does as I've had multiple bottles aged."
"D: At 8%, it would take a cold, cold night to have more than one."
"Overall, this was a very nice doppelbock. I will definitely buy this again."

"12 ounce bottle, batch 8251. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a dark copper/brown color with a very small off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is caramel, sweet malt, raisins and toffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with some hops in the finish to leave a bitter aftertaste. It's a little more bitter than I expected. Alcohol isn't very noticable, considering the ABV. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with average carbonation, however it seems a bit thin for the style. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. Overall it's a decent dopplebock, but there's other dopplebocks I'd pick before buying this one again."
"M: Nice, full, and just about right in consistency for my palate. Light carbonation for expression, with a smooth finish. This compliments a meal nicely."
"deep copper/bronze with an off white head. nutty, caramelly and slight, slight burnt toffeeish/ roasty grainy aroma. taste exhibits all the same stuff as the nose with some raisin, fig and prune characteristics coming through now and then at different times in different sips. good medium body. great carbonation. proper for the style and capable of giving the germans a run for their money. larry bell does it again."
"Deep Copper color with an off-white head. Aroma of caramel and nuts. Flavors of caramel, raisins and nuts with slight grainy roast - slight. Only on some sips - not all sips. Nice lush body and a sweet nutty finish that is not too cloying. This is one of the better American Doppelbocks that really hits close to the mark on the deep chewy darker sweet malt of the style. It's the first American Doppelbock that didn't make me say, ""yeah, but still - I'd rather be in Germany drinking the real thing."""
"Notes: The label kind of hypes it up by telling you it's brewed with 10 different types of malts. It is a pretty smooth brew, but not as malty as I'd hoped for. Good to try once, but nothing to go back for in my opinion."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable for a beer with so little carbonation and so not true to style. Still one of my favourite doppelbocks, but no longer my favourite overall. I will be buying more next season."
"D - Not quite the ""meal"" that I'm looking for out of a doppelbock, but it is pretty tasty nevertheless. Worth a try on a cold night."
"Exellent brew, try one!"
"D - Dissapointed, I love Bell's and this is just an average beer with nothing special. I enjoyed tasting this one but might have to trade off the rest of the 6-pack."
"D-This is a decent but not great beer in my opinion. Still this is the best attempt at the style I have had from an America brewer and for this, well worth the opportunity to try."
"Pours a deep red hued orange amber color with less than a finger light tan head that fades fairly quickly. Little lacing. The smell is rich and sweet; caramel toffee. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is lightl, almost under carbonated. Full flavored, the taste is the same sweet caramel earthy malt and some chocolate. A good drinker, the 8% ABV is well hidden."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a burnt toffee and crystal malt scent. It's roasted with a nice malty sweetness. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a slight buttery feel. It's got a nice roasted character as well as hiding the elevated abv.. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I love the taste as well as the aroma. Another quality brew from Bell's."
"Overall this is a decent offering of a doppelbock. It's probably not my favorite of Bell's offerings, but it tasty none-the-less."
"I'm a huge doppelbock fan, so when I found this one from Bell's I was excited, to say the least. Pours a deep red color with a finger of quickly disappearing head and no real lacing. Nose is strong on raisins and some other dried fruit, but is fairly mild overall. Flavor is very good: prunes, raisins, some light bananas. Very light hop character - this is one sweet beer. Body is medium but appropriate for the beer - not quite Celebrator range, but solid. I really like this one - it's a pretty drinkable 8% ABV."
"D - This hits the double bock style quite well. If anything it is lighter and more drinkable than some I have had. The aroma is a bit anaemic, but everything else is right on."
"Overall: Clean crisp and refreshing but not the best Doppelbock you will every have."
"Excellent beer for sipping or to warm up. A little too heavy for more than one or two, but a good overall bock."
"Well made as are all Bell's beers. Would have it again, especially on tap."
"The astringent taste here hurts the drinkability for me. It is OK but I will not try it again."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Bells dimpled mug. This beer poured deep amber color with a slight haze and a small foamy head that slowly faded away, leaving no lace. The aroma of this beer is nuts, sweet malts, caramel, and bread. The flavor consists of caramel, yeast, molasses, and a light spicy hop finish. It is lightly sweet and spicy, showing a good balance of flavor. The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied. Little carbonation, with well hidden alcohol. A good doppelbock from Bells."
"Pours a clear amber hue with a fluffy two finger khaki colored head that slowly dies down to a thin layer that lasts the entire tasting. No stickiness, no legs, doesn't hold on to the sides at all. Smell is a musty bready malt odor with some raisins. On the tongue there's a very sweet caramel flavor up front followed by biscuity malt and finishing with a dull alcohol flavor, not a big fan of the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, syrupy...with a good amount of carbonation, pretty typical of the style. I would take a bit away from the drinkability because of the alcohol-ish aftertaste, but overall this is a pretty solid brew."
"The mouthfeel is fairly watery, but I think this contributes positively to the drinkability, making it more refreshing and thirst-quenching and thus more enjoyable overall. I could drink many of these--and I just may considering the heat of the Ohio valley this time of year. Another great offering from Bells."
"Overall, I prefer most of the other Bell's offerings over this one. Just too sweet to drink more than one. I would not seek this beer out."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color. Very clear. An initial head of about 2 inches died down very quickly leaving no lacing. The smell is not very strong, but is mainly sweet like brown sugar. Hop flavor is very mild and the taste is very malty especially on the finish. A good beer I would have no problem having again."
"This one was poured with a small head. Very dark cherry color. It left almost no lace. It has a very rich, malty, sweet, caramel aromas and the same in the flavor. Hardly any noticable hop. Great mouth. Somewhat boozy. Bittersweet, but mostly sweet finish."
"Batch 7209 packed on March 2, 2006. I'm actually quite surprised I've had this for over a year. Pours a deep reddish brown with a bit of head to start but it quickly goes away leaving no lacing at all. The smell is very sweet like honey or brown sugar with a slight fruity character and a little roasted note. Taste is sweet and toasty. Brown sugar up front with a solid malt backbone, a good take on the style. Mouthfeel is think and chewy - this maybe a consequence of being a year old because I don't remember this tasting the same one year ago. This is a decent doppelbock, but it might be too sweet for most, which therefore knocks down the drinkability. Recommended."
"Eric"
"Medium bodied with a little carbonation, wouldn't be hard to knock off a few of these in a sitting, but overall not the type of beer I'd like to be drinking."
"Dark amber color with a thin, small bubbled pool. Roasted malt nose with some sweet fruits and buttery caramel notes. Really nice mouthfeel that is silky smooth and a touch of crisp fizz. Hearty roasted malt backbone with a burnt caramel sweetness, roasted grains, berry fruitiness, buttery, and nutty. Some bitterness is little more than Id like but not too bad. A tad boozy but does smooth out towards the end. The finish is fairly clean with slight notes of sweet malt and nutty. Pretty drinkable even for its strength."
"edit: I believe that the appearance of a brew has a great effect on the mouthfeel. Just seeing the creamy head on this brew after I poured it into a different glass allowed me to detect a much creamier and fuller mouthfeel."
"Already sensations are returning and all the non visual aspects are increasing their ratings. I am reminded about experiments to find if victims of the guillotine experienced pain and remained conscious."
"Tastes like chewy chocolate. Big nodes of bread, lots of caramel, candy in the middle, raisins in the back."
"D - A very good dopplebock. Great caramel sweetness."
"Drinkability: Well- balanced and not cloying; decent effort at the style"
"D: This one needs a healthy dose of some roasted malt or something. For me the sweetness is a big drawback."
"Medium-heavy body would make me think twice about having another one of these. Good, but a bit green."
"Bottle (courtesy of Tpaglia): Poured a semi filtered medium brown color doppelbock with a small off-white bubbly head with limited retention. Aroma of sweet malt and dry fruits such a figs. Taste is also dominated by sweet malt with some dry figs. I could not detect any of the banana and cloves characteristic that I usually associated with the style. Body was above average with low carbonation and no alcohol was discernable. Interesting and different take on the style but still sub par for this great brewery."
"i bought this beer to be introduced to the doppelbock, but i'll have to drink some better ones to be conviced of its merit."
"Pours a two finger white head that vanishes without a trace of lace. Slightly cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Strong sweet malty nose. Starts with a flavor of sweet malty raisins, balanced though - not cloying, mellow finish. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Chalet Party Goshen, In."
"Thicker than the appearance would have led me to believe but there is a little flatness to the mouthfeel. Still, it's pretty drinkable and like a lot of Bell's beers, there are a number of flaws but the beer is still very likable in spite of them."
"Stick to Bell's other, excellent offerings."
"a little heat to be felt in the flavor, along with deep, thick raisin and that classic DB flavor (what the hell is it?), brown sugar. it's warming and rich. a hint of bitterness rolls in at the end to keep the sweet in check. plenty of delicious caramelized sugars"
"D - Alcohol flavor is just a *TAD* hot, aside from that, it's quite drinkable."
"Final Thought: Meh. A decent doppel that has a lot of room for improvement in needed balance of sweetness and malt, as well as to conceal the alcohol punch you get; especially early on."
"This is actually the first Doppelbock I have ever consumed, so I wasnt sure what to expect. I would say this is a descent brew full of great taste. However, I am not a real fan of sweet brews, so I couldnt drink a whole lot of these."
"Quite enjoyable. I think I would enjoy having this exclusively at a bar some night, but I probably wouldn't buy these for home."
"Loose, declining, light sandy head sits atop a mildly dark russet amber. Mysterious. Sweet malt nose. Sugary. Stewed veggies and maple syrup. Soy sauce as well? Taste starts tangy, sparkly, with yeast. Turns to big time caramel (Sugar Baby); fruits are there, turning rummy. Sugary again, before a vegetable, slightly herbal finish. Better than I expeccted. Medium-bodied with tingly, lively carbonation. Sticky finish. I'd buy again, but not my favorite Bell's by a long shot."
"Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock isn't quite what I expected. I suppose that I should know by now that beer of this style varies in flavor and body as much as it varies in color. It's still a good drinker however and is one of the best bocks(!) to have entered my glass in many a month."
"D: Fairly good, though I think it would be even more 'warming' without the extended lagering."
"D - I was a little disappointed with this one for a Bell's offering but it is not a bad beer at all. A little on the sweet side of the sytle in my mind."
"Last one of a six pack worth a review... malty sweet scents picking up dates, chocolate covered cherries. Light brown lots of little floaties. Thin off white head didn't last not much of a lacing. Flavor confirms chocolate and a hint of raisin and dates, with alcohol seeping through. Thick & chewy. A wonderful dopplebock. Not my favorite TYPE of beer. Well worth the experience."
"Bottle. Smell is somewhat sweet. Pours ruby red with a small head that quickly dissipates. Initially this beer had a bit of a medicinal taste that fortunately faded as the beer approached its proper temperature. Taste really doesn't distinguish its self with maybe some carmel malt. It also has a smooth feel and finish - easily drinkable. Not a big double bock, but not bad either."
"D- Very drinkable. sweet and pleasant."
"Worth the investment to purchase again."
"Wow, this is an amazing beer, extremely drinkable, though as I continue to sip, I can feel the alcohol start to work its will on me. This would be perfect on a cold winter night, and it works quite well with a heat index of 94, here in Paducah, KY."
"Taste was nice. It had many of the flavours you look for in a doppelbock, just not enough of them. I probably won't order it again. There are better d-bocks out there."
"Dnot bad, but one to sip for me. Id have it again if offered."
"D - Still the lowlight of this beer, but very much in line with my assessment of the Doppelbock style in general. The alcohol bite has become subdued within the bounds of tolerability since my previous encounter. Let me put this way: I won't not have another."
"This doppelbock is a deep brown/red with off white head that lingers. The nose is incredibly subtle to the point where you have to struggle to smell anything. Maybe you get some light malt smell, maybe a bit of alcohol and some dense fruitness. Taste is nice sweet caramel and a little balancing roasted malts, followed by an ethanol finish. The mouthfeel is great; it's very smooth and even creamy... at least until the lingering alcohol finale. Drinkability is just average, with the mouthfeel being a plus and the tasteable 8%ABV being the big minus."
"Poured into a super huge wine glass ... a clear ruby color with little discernable carbonation and almost no head. What there was is a light tan color. Nose is subtle, not as strong as I'd like to see in a doppelbock. Smells sweet and of dark stewed fruits ... raisins, plums, and black cherries. Slight alcohol scents detectable. Palate is very unexpected. Difficult to describe ... very sweet and fruity, but almost in a candy-like way. Lack of carbonation and thinner mouthfeel lend to a fruitjuice-like taste and feel. Body, like I said, is lighter than I'd have thought. Finish is sweet with some bitter hopd offsetting. One of the oddest doppelbocks I've sampled. It's good, but very unexpected. Definitely not a good example of the style, but is worth exploring on it's own merits, I think."
"Drinkability: It wasn't that bad of a Doppelbock, but at least it was an above average Doppelbock. If I ever saw this again, I'd probably not pick it up again because there are much better and cheaper Doppelbocks out there. If you really like the taste of alcohol, then you better pick this one up before it's out of season."
"Overall this beer is very malty sweet with rich variation of carameland toffee. Really suits my palette and is pretty decent to style, too."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tumbler. Pale copper in color, minimal head, and not much carbonation. The aroma was kind of sickly sweet malt, smelled doppelbocky. The flavor was not the greatest though, probably the worst doppelbock I've tried. Tasted just a little like puke at the end of the sips, I actually poured out half the bottle."
"Appearance is an alright, if a tad light, hazed copper. Carbonation is light but lasting. No head. Aroma is sweet rancid vegetables and sweaty gym socks. Taste is fruit syrup and alcohol. Mouthfeel is way to sweet and entirely syrupy. Light body (although the syrup makes it feel heavy). No caramel, no roastedness, hardly a touch of malt or hops, just filth. Considering Bells consistency problems, Ill try this again in a year and hope for improvement but for now this beer is a drain pour. The worst dopplebock Ive tasted to date."
"Taste; a bit sweet to start with the raisins and plums, with the malts coming through, with caramel and the chocolate coming out more than it did in the aroma. There's a nice litle hop bite the finsh to balance out the sweetness a little bit. It's little different than most dopplebocks that I've had, but I found it to be pretty enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and just a touch syrupy."
"Slightly hazy burnt caramel colored with small particulate matter moving around. A grainy orangey beige head rises up but runs away quickly. Aroma is sweet malt, some raisin, and a bit of an ABV jab. Flavor is rich and thickly malty, with a faint hint of smoke, some cocoa, and ripe fruits. Malt is just this side of cloying, a bit overly sweet. ABV stays pretty well-hidden. Mouthfeel is slick and syrupy, not too carbonated. Reminds me a great deal of the traditional German doppelbocks I've tried, but not very typical for an American version. Thanks to Brent for passing this one on."
"D - This is a tasty dopplebock that exhibits all of the obvious qualities of the style. Everything but the look is above par, but nothing is a hole-in-one. As with most beers of this ABV, it takes near perfection in all previous categories to make the drinkability such that you will imbibe without care. This one is yummy, but it also lets you know that one is plenty."
"Seems pretty traditional doppel tasting, lots of caramel and brown sugar. Hoppiness adds a diffferent overall feel to this brew. Where other doppelbocks might smooth out towards the finish, there's an interesting bite here. Not as good as my standby California Doppel from Sudwerk, but still a nice (probably) once in a lifetime treat from jpm30."
"My advice if its summer buy the Oberon and if it's winter buy the expedition stout."
"The smell is very sugary. The more complex flavors are missing here. The taste is similar, bringing malt with a bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel is fairly light, while it is easy to drink."
"Poured a dirty brown with a burnt orange hue seemed a bit light for a doppelbock with a thin almost non existant head.Aromas were a bid bland I have to say some caramel and light molasses but nothing really stood out somewhat dissapointing.Flavors were marred by a real thin mouth feel for such a big beer almost watery somewhat sweet and grainy but kinda boring.Well I hate to say it because Bell's is one of my favorites but this beer really dissapoints there are to many other good doppelbocks to seek this one out."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is way thin on mouthfeel. The taste and smell are major let downs. I drank about half of the beer. The beer was allowed to warm closer to room temperature before being poured out. Bells makes some very good beers. This is not a good beer. Perhaps this one should be placed back on the drawing board. Dam I bought a sixer of this beer."
"The palate experiences this beer as medium to full bodied with a more active than average level of carbonation, appropriate for the thickness. Finish is dry. With the higher alcohol content, this beer is personally only drinkable one at a time. An average doppelbock, somewhat disappointing in its presentation and olfactory qualities, with only minor improvements in taste; not sure if aging would offer any improvements."
"Tastes goes right along with the nose. Finishes sweet. Medium-full bodied, easy carbonation. Not a bad doppelbock per se, but nothing to set it apart either."
"drinkability: fairly drinkable"
"had this on tap at the Eccentric Cafe. served in a brandy snifter. looks great, reddish and very dark. small, ultra-white head. looks pretty darn good for a dopplebock. malty, earthy odor with some fruity tones too. great taste. fruity, sour and delicious. not too harsh as some dopplebocks can be and there was more of a concentration on flavor rather than alcohol (alchol very well hidden). also some apricots, plums, and spices in there too. good slow drinking beer."
"This seems to be a pretty typical doppelbock, except for the hops which seem to hedge the malt sweetness. I expected a little more from Bell's."
"The mouth feel is a little sticky, a bit of heat, still drinkable. Nice beer. This was the first lager Ive had from Bells they should try more."
"D - Certainly a nice beer to have one or two of. Easy to drink slowly, as the sweetness does take some time to deal with between sips. Definitely not a sessionable beer, or something I would drink exclusively on a given day. After drinking one, I feel the need to wash the stickiness off my lips and clean my palate with a crisper, hoppier selection."
"Notes: Hoped for more out of Bells, one of my favorite brewers. Worth a go, but Ill stick to Two-Hearted and their killer lineup of stouts in the future."
"Bright forest fire in color. Lightyly herbaceous hop and juicy malt aroma, though subtle. Juicy malts, which come off a bit medicinal. Light cherry flavors throughout, with light hints of caramel and molasses. A pretty average Doppelbock. I was hoping for more. I thought the malt magician Larry Bell could turn out a more aromatic, more complex malt character than this."
"Another great beer from Bell's. These guys make some great stuff. I wish they were around in the northeast. One of the best larger craft brewers, I think, with an extensive selection of styles. Not quite as clean as I'd expect from a lager, even a big one like this, but it's real tasty and warming on a cold night."
"This brew pours a reddish-brown color. The head is small and recedes quickly into no lacing. The aroma is of dark fruits, caramel and roasted malt. The taste sweet, but not as sweet as a doppelbock can be. Roasted malt and caramel dominate the taste and the finish. The moutfhfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. It is not as sticky as most doppelbocks, but I think that is a good thing. Overall, this is a decent brew that I will drink again, but there are better doppelbocks out there."
"Not a bad offering from Bell's... but not one of their best either. Pours out to a coppery orange color with an artificial head of big bubbled foam, which quickly dissipated. Aromas of sweet yeast and light bread, with notes of malt and molassas. Taste is slightly bland and kind of uneventful; some maltiness, sweet grains, smoke woods, some dark cherries and fruit. Not bad, but oddly askew. Mouthfeel was slightly dense and thick, but not to the point where it was comparable to a stout or something of that nature. Decent drinkability, I was expecting something more along the lines of Ayinger Celebrator or Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock. Worth a try."
"Deep copper, orange color, with a decent one inch thick, off white colored head. Fades quickly, leaving no lacing. Slightly hazy, with a good amount of carbonation. Not a strong smelling brew, mostly malts, veggies, and a hint of biscuits. Big malt taste up front, followed by pepper, spices and bread. Light bodied mouthfeel and very easy to drink. Hard to believe this 8.0% abv. Not my personal favorite style of brew, but a decent offering from Bell's, thats worth a try."
"beer is very drinkable and enjoyable with thai food."
"Yeah, it's a good beer. I kinda reminds me of brown-sugar glazed carrots. It'd be better served on the thanksgiving table than enjoyed late-winter/early-spring . . . but hey, we don't drink Jolly Pumpkin beers only around Halloween, right?"
"A little light in the mouth but this is good beer and I can easily have a couple more."
"The beer has quite a bit of sweetness in the taste, but it is definitely not cloying. It is not overly thick either, hefty enough to be a hearty drink. Notes of carmalized malts, toffee, raisins and a bit of ruminess that manifests itself along with the bit of alcohol in the finish. This beer goes down quite smooth, almost creamy, it is really a pleasure to drink. These American examples of malt are so far and in between that it makes them that much more pleasurable when I get a hold of one."
"Mouthfeel- Very dark fruit palate. Went very well with my leftover IKEA Swedish meatballs and their special sauce. Slightly warming as well."
"Pours a weird brown-oragne with head and lacing and lots of suspended yeast, head srcatch. Smells of caramel maltyness and dark fruit with alcohol coming through. The taste is large malt with good complexity but the alcohol makes this one muted as it seems to interfer and the hop presence in near non-exsistant. A nice body and I could have a few, but I was hoping for more."
"Drinkability is good a nice doppelbock another winner from Bell. Thanks to Hometown Sports BIF and ImWithStupid for this sample."
"That said, it was deeply satisfying after a long bike ride through heavy snowfall."
"Not a bad beer but I prefer the balance in Salvator or the assertiveness of Celbrator for dopplebock beers."
"Mouthfeel is sweet to the point of lip smacking. Very chewy, sweet, and slightly tart."
"If you're hip on hop, then you'll probably think I'm giving this stuff a bad rap, you'll love it. Just let me know what to do with the remaining 3 six-packs here, heh..."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" beige head over the reddish amber brew. Head settles, but stays with the party for the most part, and lacing is okay for the style. Aroma is very fruity, with an undercurrent of malt and alcohol. Taste is just as strongly friuty as I remember it, overpoweringly so, just shouting everything down except for maybe some alcohol warming at the end. Mouthfeel probably would be good if the flavor wasn't kicking my butt, and drinkability from same. Guess I really just don't like this one. Your milage may vary."
"A must try, pleasing and satisfying even in hot summer months!"
"The mouthfeel is crisp and light with a residual sugar aftertaste. The caramel is hidden under all the sweetness. Not bad, but if this is the best Bell's has to offer (based on my opinion of the brews I've had), it's not really worth trying again."
"A solid American Micro attempt. Similar to most German Dopplebocks, but is a little more 'yeasty' looking when poured. Smells more chocolatey and the fruit aromas are more defines. Tastes sweet, maybe too sweet. Dark fruits of prunes, figs, dates, and a bit nutty. Solid flavors from caramel, molassas, and brown sugar with a bit of toasty-ness. Lightly detected hop presence in flavor, bitter, and aroma. A little musky smelling and earthy tasting. I would go so far as to say grainy or astringent. Nice alcohol warming and sweetness in the finish. Nice firm body, just a bit too sweet. I'll lay one down for a year or so, then see what's happening."
"D- This has a strange light fruit taste without any malty backbone. The alcohol is very light for 8% and so is the malt. Not quite the oomph to call it a doppelbock."
"Clear red/brown with ruby highlights topped by a light tan head. Looks pretty nice. Complex aroma, malty sweet, lots of fruit, raisins, and alcohol. Low bitterness with a malty, fruity plum flavour and some hop presence. Finishes malty with some alcohol flavour. Full body blends well with alcohol warmth and creamy, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Medium/low carbonation. Quite enjoyable and drinkable, even with the higher abv."
"The beer is very drinkable for 8% even with the warming. I wish it had a little bit of chocolate malt flavors and possibly some hops somewhere to balance a little, but overall it is a decent beer."
"I think instead of a ""double bock", it should maybe be a 2.5x bock, or at least a 2 1/3 bock. If you are into thick beers, give this a try."
"Pours a reddish-amber hue with a nice beige colored head that dissapated quickly. Smell is mostly fruity esters with smells of raspberry and a light sweetness. Taste is big on malt of course with flavors of rock candy, a tart raspberry taste, and a grassy hops background. The alcohol shows it's head and it's pretty noticeable which detracts from the drinkability. This is a descent dopplebock, but the alcohol is too apparent and the flavors are too raw and overwhelming. This is a descent attempt at the style but not something i would seek out again."
"Overall, not too excited to see the rest of the six-pack taking up precious space in my beer fridge."
"Pours a hazy chestnut color. Off white foamy head disappeared immediately, leaving no lace at all on the glass. Huge amount of streaming bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Smells of toffee, slight roasty and buttery. Caramle flavor, slightly buttery, dark fruit. No deep robust malt profile here. Over carbonated, watery. This one falls short in my book. This got a little better as it warmed, but not that great."
"I like this beer a lot. Too bad its so seasonal. This pours a reddish brown color. It smells of dark fruit and malt. The taste follows the nose. It is sweet and malty with some dark fruit flavors such as plum and raisin. It has a good mouthfeel with medium carbonation. I think its a very drinkable beer. This one is one of my favorites from Bells. I highly recommend trying it."
"Drinkability: Suffers some just b/c of the alcohol presence. This would be great as a night cap or an apertif. Another solid offering from Bells. Strongly recommended."
"Overall, a pleasing experience, but not exceptional."
"This beer poured up a deep caramel color with a nice foamy head that faded fast. Lots of activity continues in the glass. The nose is very subtle but my sense of smeel is not the best. It has a nice fresh flavor that is slightly fruity and sweet. The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected it to be. I'm also getting a maple flavor. This is a nice beer that warms you as drink it. Another solid brew from Kalamazoo! I'd reccomend it to the right person."
"I find Consecrator very drinkable, perhaps even a good session beer. But, I don't think it holds up well to other dopplebocks (Celebrator immediately comes to mind) for taste. The taste is very simple and up-front. It's good, just not much too it. I always buy a few 6 packs though when it is in season."
"Slàinte!"
"Medium bodied and a little thin overall. Fairly smooth...flows over the mouth nicely. This was nice to try but I don't see myself coming back to it all too often. Thanks to my buddy kmpitz2 for sharing this one with me on my trip to KY."
"This is the first beer shared between me and orbitalr0x on his trip down to visit. The warm up for the Liberator. This beer pours a nice amber color with a finger of head that sticks around very well. The nose is really sweet, with a sweet strawberry fruityness. Interesting. The flavor is a little weak, not as full and robust as I would exect. Its malty, with a somewhat nutty character. I like it. The feel is moderate to thick, with a slight syrupyness. Overall, this is a really easy drinking beer for 8% Smooth and very nice."
"I have never had a bad beer from Rogue, Stone, or from Founders for that matter. Bells still has issues with consistant brewing across the board. This beer is terrible, and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. I poured the rest down the drain."
"Pours a cloudy bright amber-copper color with a nice foamy lasting white head with some lacing. Has a sweet fruity and nutty aroma. Sweet and malty roasty caramel flavors very sweet in the finish, medium body with a slick and smooth mouthfeel, burning alcohol finish."
"decent beer. seems to be better than last year's version, which i didn't care for at all. still not spectacular, i expect better from bell's. i'll probably get this again though, it's good and all, it just doesn't ""wow"" me all that much."
"Overall, this is a pretty good doppelbock. Would, however, I buy again? Not likely (maybe a single once in a while). Nevertheless, if you like doppelbocks, this is one to try."
"Overall a fair-good offering from a legendary Michigan microbrewery. Bell's strong suite is still their stouts and porters - by far. A tag line they use (that I'm quite fond of) is...'If God had wanted us to filter our beers, he wouldn't have given us a liver'. If you are ever in Mid-SW Michigan, you need to treat yourself to Bell's 'Eccentric Cafe' - where Bell's beer is the freshest!"
"Consecrator pours a clear reddish, dark copper body with a small beige head that lasts a few minutes. Minimal patch lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is caramel maltiness and fruity apples and berries. Some aroma hops are noted, but hard to identify. Mouthfeel is lacking for style, being light medium bodied at best. Carbonation is medium, as well. Taste is caramel, with only a hint of toffee. Very fruity, with apples, pears, and raspberries. Very odd for a doppelbock. Dark fruits and Munich malts seem missing in action. Light body is good for drinkability, I suppose, but I expect more character, malt, and body in a doppelbock and this one falls short. Not a bad one, but this would be low on my list of preferred doppels."
"A very cold and blustery day on a hill in baren Southern Minnesota seems like the perfect time and place for this beer. 12 oz. brown bottle. Body is a deep mahogany color, slightly scarlet when held to light. Head is very small, which may be a function of the high abv. Smell is of brown sugar and toasted malts with some alcohol in the background. Taste is bright and sweet, with a lot of alcohol present, to go along with a brown sugar sweetness. I'd like to see more body, but I don't consider that a major downfall of this beer. Slight coffee tones hidden under everything else going on. A very good beer for a very uninviting day outside."
"sampled a 12 ouncer, no freshness dating. Pours dark almond, murky and cloudy. Minimal head and lacing obtained. Nose is of funk, cheese, sweet malt. Tasty, sweet and fairly complex DBock. Soft notes of maple, cloves, mint and smokey malts. Nice drinkable, warming winter sipper."
"quite good. should have ordered a full pint"
"This is a ringer for a Bavarian Doppelbock. Extraordinarily drinkable."
"Pours a clear, deep copper color with a short-lived tan colored head. Dark berry, rum raisin, molasses, roasted sugarcane, pumpernickel and some semi-sweet chocolate in the nose. Quite the malty lil' bugger. Fruity esters bordering overripened strawberry and plum, with some light caramel and molasses notes. Average to higher carbonation levels provides a drinkability while cutting the slick mouthfeel. A reasonably good doppelbock, just a little too fruity for my liking."
"12oz bottle Thaks Brooklynboy. Poured a deep red, murky mahogany...not much head (which is odd for this type of dark lager) The aromas were phenomenal...berry fruits, vannilla pods, treacle, cookie dough malts. Oily mouth feel...a very viscous brew for a dopple...hopping understated ...lets the sweetness come through with not enough balance (this brew screams for the need of hallertau infusion) tastes of vanilla, molasses, figs and rye bread in the body...finish is more bready as the sweetness drops away. This was a tad sweet for my liking the sugaring adjuncts were too prominenet ...its well put together but in its current near cloying form it has low drinkability ratings from me."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a murky brown color with one finger of head that dies off fairly quickly. There is no lacing. The smell is malty with some caramel sweetness, but not too much else going on. The taste is also malty and sweet, with some caramel, toffee, and raisin. Not much hop flavor, but not much expected anyway. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy. The drinkability is solid for an 8% brew. A decent doppelbock."
"another thank you to feloniousmonk for providing this sample."
"poured reddish brown, with off white to light tan head with some lacing. aroma choc. malts,fruits and coffee. flavor hints of berry (blueberry?) , choc. and molasses.like the finish the berry flavor was nice. with a nice smooth mouthfeel. another good beer from bells"
"This brew pours out looking very chewey with a thick cloudy bronze body and a quarter inch of tan head. Some lacing takes place from the residual but not a lot. This beers presence is from its aroma and taste, both of which give off strong hints of its caramel malt base. The feel is very full and creamy. Particles float about and let you know this is a beer with substance. Quite drinkable."
"The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy, but just a little too syrupy. The finish was long on the tongue as caramel and malt seemed to last forever. The syrupy quality knocks down the drinkability a notch."
"Caramel to red in color with a quickly dissapating off white head that didnt leave any lace. The aroma starts off fruity almost cidery and then mellows to heavy yeasty malt aroma as it warms. The flavor is malty but not too sweet, and then a spicey yeast finish. It has lots of body, a heavy malt finish that leaves an effervescence. It leaves me wanting more."
"Big caramel flavor a massively large warming down the gullet with just a touch of a roast bite hanging in the edges mercifully."
"This brew has a brown colored body with a khaki foam head on top. There is a smooth malt scent, some alcohol detectable. The taste is fairly subdued malt, some alcohol spice. Slight hint of hops. Full bodied brew. Not the all time best but a good brew."
"Found this one at the Foodery in Philly. This poured very murky. An amber-burgundy color topped with a thin off white head. This smells like a liquid strawberry twizzler! Very interesting - heavy, sweet and fruity malts. The taste is strong, bold and complex. But no so much as to scare on away. A floral hop presence just manages to surface from underneath all that complex maltiness. This is quite drinkable for such a bold beer. The alcohol is masked pretty well. The body of malt is solid and the finish is cloyingly sweet. Overall, a great beer."
"Overall, I would say this doppelbock is a good one to introduce people to the style because it is more approachable than its European counterparts. Good work, Bell's. This is a brewery that deserves respect."
"Drinkability: Not half bad. I happily sipped this and if I had more I might have reached for another. As it warmed, the tartness gave way to very strong sweet banana esters. By the time it was done, I felt like I was eating my mom's banana bread. That could be good for some, but it sort of turned me off. This isn't a bad beer, but I have other dopplebocks that I like more. It's worth a try at least to taste this strange yet decent interpretation."
"Drinkability/Overall: Possibly fairly drinkable for some people, but I just couldn't get into it. Not too bad, but not my favorite Doppelbock either."
"12 ounce bottle taken by force by AKSmokedPorter."
"Deep red-colored body with a yellow cornmeal head. The medium-sized head forms easily and then fades. The aroma is malty with a slight pepperines. The sweet, malty flavor is warm and closing in on thick, but its not a big flavor. Very smooth. Theres a slight graininess in the flavor. The alcohol shows through a bit in the finish."
"This beer pours a dark ruby color with very little foam, but lots of carbonation. First sip is full of intense maltiness, caramel and fruit flavors. Almost tannic finish, which is also a bit bitter, which I kind of like in a doppelbock. I don't like a doppelbock to finish too sweet. An almost wine-like character and a similar body; a bit thin bodied for my tastes. The smooth mouthfeel that one expects from a doppelbock also is missing. Strong vanilla aroma. Vanilla bean-like flavors emerge as this beer warms up. A perilously drinkable double bock. As is the case with most Bell's beers, the high alcohol content isn't that noticeable, it doesn't hit you until your half way through your drink. Starts kind of weak but finishes with a with a burst of intense caramel/Munich malt flavor coated with just the right amount of bitter hops. The party is over quicky, though, and the finish is quite short."
"Thanks to Chuck's Fine Wines for their breakups of Bells. One of the best beers for tuna fish!"
"Sampled 3/6/04"
"A Bamboozling Thanks to BigHuge for this Kalamazoo-ling offering."
"A nice dark red/brown brew with ruby highlights. A small white head dies very, very quickly, leaving only small bubbles in its wake. The aromas are just sweet, malty, bready, pretzel-y, and sweet. The taste is sweet, malty, bready, pretzel-y and sweet as well! The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and the drinkability is good as well. Good stuff if you like a real sweet, malty, and uncomplex doppel!"
"I usually love most Bell's products, however, I am let down by this one. It pours a brown/reddish color, most doublebocks that I've had are as dark as night. The head hangs out for a while, and vanishes. The taste isn't quite right for a double bock. My best guess would be the yeast. I suspect that they used Bell's Ale yeast for a lager, as I get a similar taste off of the Amber and the Oberon, which are good for that style. Mouthfeel is a bit grainy, and I don't think I'd want to drink a ton of them, due to the strange yeast taste."
"Appearance: Chestnut mahogany amber brown unfiltered color to it, topped with a nice caramel tan head leaves evenly rung specks of lacing, can't complain. Aroma: Rich malty layers paired with what the label calls ""old world yeast"" (aka Ringwood like in nature yeast) works its magic and brings out a semi-spicy bread note. Unique doppelbock that goes light on the alcoholic phenols and over ripened fruit approach, also packs a decent helping of hops here. Taste: BIg flavor succulent like a well prepared portobello mushroom, sports a tasty sweet malt profile finishes bready with a touch of plum and alcohol infused flavor and heavily hoppy flavors for a D-bock keeping the bitterness reserved. Great exploratory offering pushes the diameters of the style nice jobe, Larry! Mouthfeel: Unfiltered medium bodied German style lager, nice beer for me I enjoyed. Drinkability: Top notch balance not overly sweet great mix of flavors, man I really like this beer."
"Well, not one of the great dopplebocks out there, but still not bad. If I saw it around, I'd probably give it a try on draft."
"The taste is most definitely thick, thick malt. Rich and almost-pudding like., providing a nice backing. There are some raisins in there, though this disappears as the beer warms. Also, the alcohol is very strong and noticeable, though there's a spicy, refreshing aftertaste of hops at the end. Wow - 8% ABV isn't significant, but for some reason the alcohol from this beer snuck up on me!"
"The mouthfeel is medium to full, with medium to low carbonation. The finish is somewhat astringent and warming but not harsh"
"Big, full body with a nice, soft carbonation. It's good drinking, but I couldn't drink much more than one of these since it packs quite a punch, and I'm not even talking about the alcohol. Strong brew all around."
"This is one tasty beer. Finishes very quickly and alcohol taste becomes more apparent as I keep drinking it. Quality beer. Try this again."
"This one pours an amber/brown color with a decent head and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and caramelly and sort of reminds me of cough syrup. The flavor is sweet with the same caramel feel that the aroma had. Pretty smooth and easy to drink. Not a bad beer."
"Poured a murky, prune-juice brownish-black. Only in a doppelbock would this be good. Aroma hinted at caramel. Flavor profile was well-moderated. A bit of caramel, but not an overwhelming influence. A touch of dried dark fruit, prune in particular. Pleasantly sweet, but not cloying. Not as much depth of flavor as in some others of the style, but, in terms of drinkability that is not a bad thing, as this beer was pleasant, but not overly challenging. I was surprised to learn the abv is 8%, as the alcohol level was not at all evident in the flavor. Deceptive."
" Sweetness with a nice rich mouthfeel,some alcohol here too.The aftertaste is subtle and a little quicker than I would like.Not quite as deep or complex as some beer of this style,but still pretty good.The Bells brews are all prety solid and this is no exception."
"Thanks to ""super trader"" CRJMellor for the bottles!"
"Consecrator isn't your typical doppelbock, to be sure. I could probably only drink one of these in a sitting because of the flavor, but that's ok. Try one and see for yourself."
"Drinkability is good but bottle version so far pals in comparison to draught version but still pretty darn good."
"Drink-yum-able!"
"ng"
"On a side note, for being a heavy hitter this stuff is remarkably cheap. The current going price in Michigan is 9$ for a six pack, which is remarkable for beer of this quality. I might also note that I've seen it around at strange times of the year, which either means Bell's is making it more often, or has saved some back and is occasionally letting it go to distributors. I hope they eventually make this another regular seasonal brew, because I think it's one of their better small batch beers."
"This dopplebock is redish brown with a huge tan head. Malt is evident in the smell and taste. It is lightly hopped, just enough to tame the malty sweetness. There is lots of carbonation. The mouthfeel is great. This beer is so easy to drink. I found myself taking big gulps."
"2002 vintage, on tap at BW3's downtown Indy. Was only suppose to be a 16oz pour, but the bartender already had it in a 20oz glass!!! Poured a cloudy reddish brown, with no head to speak of. No sign of any lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet with fruit and caramel hints. The taste was more of the same sweetness perhaps overly so, with some hint of the alcohol thrown in there. There was very little carbonation evident, however it was still smooth and tastey. Alcohol is hidden nicely in this one. At least until I finished!!!"
"The appearance is a caramel brown with a tan foamy head. Not a lot of smell. I guess I would describe the smell as earthy. The taste is excellent. It feels like it belongs in my mouth. It's sweet and smooth and has a slightly chocolately aftertaste. The mouthfeel is perfect. I have to stop myself from chugging it down. I would have to say that this is one of my favorite beers right now."
"Chocolate brown with a medium tan head. Aroma is malty of course, somewhat bold, smokey with notes of cigar and tobacco. The taste seemed a tad too bold for me, not really clean, too packed with an earthy sweet character I didn't quite enjoy, especially in the aftertaste. Palate is flawless though, oatmeal stout round and smooth."
"Drinkability: Rather drinkable, but I can get Celebrator, so why bother?"
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for this one!"
"Nice head at first. Gone in a flash! No lacing, but the beer is an enticing clear red color. Smells slightly sweet. The taste is mediocre. Again, pretty sweet, and not very complex. Tingy on the tongue. The high alcohol content isn't too obvious, but a 12 oz bottle is still just a little too much."
"I think this is a worthy offering in the Doppelbock field. Pours a lovely reddish amber color with a medium almost butterscotch-colored (but mostly beige) head. Thin and slow lacing. Medium-bodied and easy to drink, with a nice caramel and malt flavor up front. There are also flavors of raisins, alcohol and sweet fruit in there. The finish is mostly sweet with a bit of a hops and alcohol spike. I liked this a lot."
"It has a thick tongue feel and a bit of maltiness. The flavor is OK, but not an overly impressive doppelbock"
"This may be only the second time I've been disappointed with a Bell's beer. Consecrator pours a reddish copper color with an extremely fizzy head that dissipates to nothing after a few moments. Smell is relatively subdued with minor notes of malty sweetness and a hint of alcohol. Taste is incredibly sweet, almost too sweet for the style, with a sugary sensation that I did not care for. Big time caramel malt is all I could really pick up. Mouthfeel is very thin for the style, and due to the overdone carbonation, it's hard to detect that great, full-bodied bready mouthfeel that most dopplebocks possess. Drinkability is average -- the alcohol is somewhat hard to detect on the way down due to the sweetness, but it's noticeable after drinking the beer. Not a terrible effort, but probably one of Bell's weakest."
"Far from Bell's best effort. Light in color -- more tarnished copper/penny than deep and rich. Malt to the nose with a slight wet grass sensation. Not terribly inspiring but not awful. Flavor has some alcohol, sugar, and husky malts. Almost watery. This isn't a bad beer by any means, but it's a pretty poor doppelbock."
"Very different from the usual doppelbock. Also tastes very one-dimensional-maltiness with caramel and molasses. This taste never leaves. It also has a strong alcoholic taste like most doppelbocks. But this time the Bell's yeast and it's sourness is not near as enjoyable. The balance and complexity are not there but this beer is still decent enough to get again."
"This brew has a very nice malty aroma. It poured a nice light head that quickly disappeared. It has a very nice dark brown color. But, it's initial taste was different from other Doppelbocks I have tasted. It was full of a variety of tastes with cinnamon and caramel flavors. There was a hint of carbonation rising off my tongue as I drank it. Not as smooth as the German Doppelbocks which I prefer over this one."
"Certainly an odd duck, but nothing screamed bad bottle to me. I just think its not a very good beer. Thanks to MJR for the experience (he had the decency to warn me)."
"Drinkability: It's not looking too good... This is certainly the strangest doppelbock I've encountered. It starts well enough, then completely takes a turn for the worse. I'll stick with Bell's ales..."
"A fine doppelbock...sweet but fresh sweet if that makes sense...caramel/brown sugar/molasses...silky smooth on the tounge..not overbrearingly sweet...deeper in some hints of alcohol hit the nose and the palate..good carbonation..a very impressive doppel that is sweet but not overly thick....definitely a beer to savor..."
"This particular dopplebock poured a medium head. There was no lacing on the side of my mug. When I poured this into my mug, it poured as a dark amber color. Not much carbonation with this dopplebock. It had a smooth taste to it. This was a thinner dopplebock than I have experienced with other dopplebocks. It had a sweet aroma. The taste was syrupy. This was not a good interpretation of a dopplebock in my opinion."
"Ruddy chestnut hue and brilliantly clear when decanted. Prodigious, stiff persistent taupe head leaves jagged, dense lace. Honeyish sweetness and toasted malt hit the nose at first, then are contrasted by a tartness akin to unripe plum. Richness in aroma is provided by a lightly buttery, toffeish melanoidin / dark caramel malt combination. Caramelized fruit sweetness hits and coats the palate initially, then is bathed by a detracting sourness reminescent of sour sop. Sourness tapers slightly, allowing sweetness to reemerge in a toasty, bready fashion, only to be offset by light, yet mildly astringent hop bitterness. Becomes thin, oddly vinous and sherrylike late. Over attenuated, but passably smooth. Finishes with diminished lactic tartness fading quickly and token residual sweetness fleeting. Hmm. A beer that had potential, but is perhaps a victim of a fledgling Lactobacillus infection. Not outright bad (yet), but easily far substandard for Bells."
"To my delight the richness wasn't excessive and I""m pretty intolerant of such things. To me it hit but didn't pass the cloyingly sweet line, making it enjoyable. It actually may be a tad thin. Aroma was limited with initial breadiness passing to a heavier malt quality with some sweetness, without it being excessive. Deep amber with orange and red hues making mostly brown. Clear. Felt the warmth quickly, but that may be because my stomach is mostly empty. Some fruitiness, some richness, somewhat complex. Worth sampling as a Dopplebock. And it's better than Big Butt."
"12 oz brown bottle. Double image of a goat's head on the label. Allrighty then. Murky deep wet shoe leather brown color. Creamy bubbly beige head, fades quickly into a clumpy covering. No lacing or covering left. Smell is super sweet, malty and rich, just as you would expect from a dopplebock. First taste is oddly sweet, and overly fruity, melons, yea honeydew melons ? Is that what they are called. Tasted like a hint of those then faded. Syrupy sweet, cloying malt flavors followed. Some toasted flavors come and go, but not consistent at all. Nearly slick toward the end. Carbonation bubbles present to start, but not at the finish. Not much carbonation on this one either. I think they have a real problem with that. Just not one I would seek out."
"Slightly mired deep amber sporting a thin, but clingy cap. Aroma of old sticky buns topped with raisins and shaved almonds. Sweet maple malt start is nearly cut by bittering hops but rests a little too thick on the tongue. I wouldn't turn down a Consecrator, nor would I seek one out. One of Bell's weakest."
"This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed a light tan foamy head that left trace lace. An aroma of malt and caramel. A flavor of malt, caramel and some other sweetness, not sure how to place it though. A touch astrigent in the finish. As doppels go, it's a fair interpretation, but is not going to knock you off normally getting the German ones that we all rave about."
"I just can't dig doppelbocks yet. Unless this is an off one. I enjoyed Salvator a lot. This one seems bland in a way. It's appearance is a wonderful dark cherry red/amber, and the head is about an inch of tan thickness. I didn't get much out of the whiffs, just some sweet maltiness. It's thick and full bodied on the tongue, very sweet. Maltiness is about it, very sweet, then some hops in the finish. A weird aftertaste kept bothering me. I had no idea what it was. It knocked taste and drinkability down somewhat. Not recommended."
"Came out of the bottle a walnut varnish color, looks a little more reddish brown in the glass against the light. It smells on the sweet side and doesn't have much a head on top. The head doesn't stick around for long either. First sip reveals a bit of sugary sweetness then quickly yields to a warming alcohol presence. The 8.0% is noticeable in this beer. I was hoping for more of a caramel note like Salvator or Celebrator but it doesn't seem to be there. The aftertaste just says alcohol like a more subtle shot of vodka. Maybe I've got an old bottle of something since I got this at a place that is prone to put old stock on the floor. I think I'll stick to the better stouts of Bell's."
"Hazy, yeasty orangey umber (I don't decant) color, very yellow creamy head of 1/8 of an inch. Coats but doesn't lace the glass very well. An orange oil aroma with a faint malty clove tone as well. Chocolate covered pear flavors, a bit of spice and mid mouth smokey bitterness with a surprisingly hoppy citrus finish that steers this beer well away from the somewhat cloying stickiness that's a territory many Doppels can flirt with. Lighter bodied but consistant feel front to back. This is certainly a different take on the style, but unlike other Doppelbocks in name only (like Leinenkugel's) it has complexity and good flavors. I admit to expecting a ""bigger"" brew, though."
"On re-review 2005, I have to stand next to my initial impressions. This is an odd dopplebock, but still a good brew. Bananas are still here which is not acceptable in this style, and the whisky impression is prominent. Smoke this year is hardly there. This is odd for the style, but has a very nice mouthfeel and seems to have softened up compared to previous years."
"Overall this has to be an infected beer. This is the second Kalamazoo product that I have tried that was sour. I have also had two that were excellent. No way they can be proud of this product. I will give them another try in six to nine months."
"I once taste-tested this against a regional version, Leinie's Big Butt Doppelbock. It was like Godzilla vs. Bambi."
"A huge letdown."
"Flavor, flavor, flavor.  This doppelbock has it.  Pours out to a very nice dark ruby color, with a creamy, light brown foamy head.  The head looked good enough to eat.  Nice alcohol kick on the finish with enough hops to trip the sweetness of the malt back to earth.  A very impressive beer."
"Nice, thick slightly tan head.  Aroma is very sweet.  Very complex malt tones in this beer.  Slightly viscous mouthfeel.  Cloudy, slightly muddy appearnace.  Sweet tastes like dates and raisins are evident.  Layered tastes like fruit cake and caramel apples come through if you look hard enough.  Dopplebocks are not one of my favorite styles, but this is a good one.  Right up there with Celebrator, S.A. and Sprecher."
