4.07,2.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Aroma definitely gets your attention - strong and malty with a caramel overtone and notes of spice and chocolate plus an earthy hint. Pours a translucent chocolate brown, close to mahogany, with a thick and fairly persistent tan head that leaves some generous lacing. Flavor does not quite equal the promise of the aroma, but is still quite good - malty, bready, subtle notes of caramel, cloves and chocolate. Smooth texture has good body and fizz, and leaves a malty, woody, slightly chocolaty finish. Get this goat!","Cyberkedi","Jan 05, 2015"

The 8% abv is the con on this one. After half pint one starts to taste the alcohol instead of the caramel, toffee flavor. Overall I would recommend this as a two pint wonder on movie night at home.

The alcohol is present but, like the rest of the various aspects, not cloying or at the front. Everything moves in and out. I'm the type to eat and drink slowly, for the most part, so I'll take a few deep drinks and then let the beer sit on the table for five minutes; I think the tortoise had it right, slow and steady wins the race. My second or third time lifting the glass actually presented a kind of soy or tamari quality, with salt lingering. I also get tar, if that makes sense, kind of as a deeper extension of the licorice. Interesting beer, no doubt.","quid","Jan 16, 2014"

The look and smell are spot-on for a doppelbock, but the taste throws a few curveballs that I cannot fully endorse. The first curve is the strange, almost spicy, zesty character that accompanies the malt bill, and the second curve is the strangely herbal/floral finish.

Ripe, dark fruit scents: plum, dates, raisins, banana; some caramel and toffee notes, too; dark rum. The taste is a bit more one-dimensional: sweet, sugary, booze-soaked fruit cookies.

Aromatics offer up hints of plum, raisin, dark malts over ripened fruit, beautiful beer almost cider like tartness amongst the dark roasted malts. Flavor rustic lager flavors, smoke meat, just a hint of that, with big ripe dark fruits, plum juicy raisins, and plum that dark juice you can only get from the source. A definite German style lager from Colorado, excellent take by all means I'm just so spoiled to have tried so many great doppelbocks from PA they are the kings of the German beer styles brewed in America with minor exceptions along the way. Hints of dark chocolate and toffee as I take a few more sips with the dark fruit a mesmerizing beer experience, I'm glad I'm digging in now a year later. Mouthfeel is great smooth easy going each sip easier than the next I'm glad I found it subdued and refrigerated for a year it's been truly lagered, easy going carbonation great chewy dopplebock medium to full bodied. Overall I can't stop talking about this beer, excellent stuff nails the style truly good drinking doppelbock they better still make this stuff.","WVbeergeek","Jun 06, 2013"

4.22,6.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/5/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear deep mahogany color with a nice 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, prune, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, dark bread, biscuit, nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of dark malty flavors with well balanced fruitiness. Taste of caramel, raisin, prune, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, chocolate, biscuit, nuttiness, and light roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, dark fruit, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, biscuit, nuttiness, and light earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity of dark malty flavors with moderate fruitiness; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent doppelbock! Great balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and extremely smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering; one of the better examples I have had in the style.","superspak","Mar 13, 2013"

The flavor is sweet with lots of caramel and brown sugar flavors and a bit of burnt sugar sweetness. Light prune flavor along with a weak coffee type melanoid thing going on. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet crisp mouthfeel. I find that so many American breweries try to replicate the dopplebock style and can't seem to pull it off. This is a fine beer, but compared to some of the hallmarks of the style it just doesn't compare.

As the glass warms, the herbal and earthy hopping aspects gain enough volume to make one of the more strikingly dry finishes I've ever tasted in a Doppelbock. In fact, overall this beer seems to be balanced more towards being savory and bready than being about caramel and toffee, and I'm totally OK with that. However, on the other hand, there is only the merest ghost of a presence of dark fruits in either nose or flavor, which could stand to be somewhat bigger relative to all the other elements.","WastingFreetime","Sep 26, 2012"

This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 18, 2012"

Tastes sweet, syrupy and grainy. There's some brown bread involved, and I go looking for spice, but can't find any. It's a bit sticky as it should be and the alcohol is there but not overwhelming. Creamy up front with some crisp edges. Drier than expected. A welcome end of the summer treat that I will likely revisit soon.","stephens101","Aug 16, 2012"

Probably will get even better after it breathes and warms a little. I'd buy this one again if I was in a doppelbock mood.
