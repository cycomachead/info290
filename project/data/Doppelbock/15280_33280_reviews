"Nice smell, a lot of chocolate, fudge taste.  But it presents more like a stout.  Not sure about this one."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 9/2014. Pours crystal clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas of dark/roasted/bready malt, dark fruit, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, herbal, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Good complexity and robustness of dark/roasted/bready malt, dark fruit, and earthy hop flavors; with a solid bitterness/sweetness balance and some light cloying bitterness on the finish. Pretty clean on lager flavor with no overly estery notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly creamy/sticky, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty solid doppelbock style. Good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, dark fruit, and earthy hop flavors; and smooth to sip on for the big ABV. The cloying bitterness/stickiness definitely killed the mouthfeel, but there was some good malt complexity overall. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Great heavy flavor Would buy again"
"Awesome michigan made beer. Drink it"

"Pours dark copper with little cream head, smells of bready malts, tastes bready malty slight yeast grassiness smooth lingering finish"
"I want to like Atwater as I am a huge fan of Michigan craft beers and Detroit has a small piece of my heart but I have just not had anything from Atwater that has gotten me excited. This beer is as dark as a stout, smells, tastes almost like a stout, I can hardly tell if this is even lagered. Will not be going for this one again."

"This is 9.5% which is mind boggling. There's no evidence of booze but the flavor isn't strong enough to imply that much malt."

"Black pour with a small brown head. Light aroma has some nut and toasted malt. Flavor has roasted malt upfront without being bitter. Full bodied. Can also taste a bit of chocolate, coffee, bread, molasses and raisin. A light bitterness developed as the beer warms. Finishes with a mild sweet malt flavor."

"Very faint aroma of bready, toffee sweetness. You really have to get your nose in there. Pours an impenetrable black, you can only see a little light when held right up to a bulb. No lace or head to speak of. Nice, if typical Dopplebock taste. Medium sweet followed by pleasant bitterness. Cool label."

"Overall: an overly chocolate and most likely not well fermenated doppelbock. no cleanness and way too one sided."
""
""

"The charred and fruity characters are offputting. Either this beer has changed or my palate has. Used to really like it. Seems oxidized."

"Overall, a solid brew - it needs to warm to acceptable tasting levels to get the full experience as some of the flavors are tamed by the colder temps. A touch more roast presence than other doppelbocks"

"O - Decent bock and I'd have it again. But the imports feature so many that are just superior."
""
"Beer is medium to in body, with fairly low levels of carbonation, resulting in a somewhat stagnant, flat feeling: a bit more carbonation would enhance the perception on the mouth and perhaps accentuate the flavors of the beer better. There is no apparent ethanol perceived. Closes quite dry, with substantial stickiness lingering on the lips and palate."

"My introduction to the Atwater family of beers. It pours a rather dark sienna topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises deep caramel, light roasted malts, graham cracker, dark breads, and a twinge of cocoa powder. The taste brings in more of the same, with the sweetness inherent in the smell coming through a bit subdued, the breadiness taking firm control. There's a touch of vague fruit in the finish, but it doesn't stick around long enough for any sort of positive confirmation. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a pretty nice d-bock, one that doesn't overdo it in any category save drinkability."

"O - Overall a decent doppelbock, flavor is on the light side but good. Needs a fuller body and slightly more depth would help it out. Would pass next time."

"Looks very black with a malt colored cap appearing after a quick one finger settle. Smells of roasted malt. Tastes like pumpernickel bread, and roasted malt. Light to medium carbonation. Feels thin. Chocolate aftertaste. High ABV and toasted bread taste make it worth a try."

"This poured nicely, forming two fingers of foamy, mocha-brown head with good retention. Color was a deep-brown with garnet/ruby highlights. Nose was malty sweet, but subdued. I have had some in the style that were syrupy sweet. For me, less sweet = a good thing. Mouthfeel was big and full to the point that I thought that I had a spoonful of pudding in my gob. Whoa! This was extremely smooth with faint tastes of coffee and chocolate and some heat. I got my first swallow down and a moment later, it hit me with the kick of a Missouri mule. Finish was likewise semi-sweet and I also got lingering flavors of salt and licorice. I have not been wildly impressed with Atwater beers up until now, but this was a very good beer."
""
"O: The taste was a bit of a let down to me. Nothing much there really. Too mild."
""
"Overall: A solid double bock here. Sweet and roasty but balanced."
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is very nice but could use a little more body in my opinion. Overall a good beer and one worth a try. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty good, but it feels pretty precariously balanced and it's neither particularly clean nor flashy. I feel like hanging on to it for another month or two would be a bad idea, but if you can get it fresh it's worth trying."
""
""
""
"This is a good beer - it is just miscategorized."

"Notes: Very drinkable and very tasty. Cheers."
"Overall, easy to drink. Alcohol is hidden. Flawed, but ok."
"Poured a darker mahogany brown color with a short-lived eggshell-white head. Aroma of toasted grains, light hints of cocoa and cardboard. Really nothing wrong with the taste at all here: dark malts, toasted grains, nutty, woody, dry, leafy and earthy hops used in subdued moderation. Most notably...where's the alcohol? Goes down way too easy for sure, with 9%ABV almost completely hidden, which garners extra points for drinkability. Not bad at all."

"O - This is a beer that has been on my mind for some time now and I Just had to give it a shot . When first tasting one starts to gets a slight tingle on the tongue with nice Roasted Black coffee notes with slight very slight sweet notes. This was great I love the Roasted taste and I love the black coffee but the alcohol and hops destroy any other flavor coming through and for a doublebock its not that sweet. One should note that the beer was alot better as it got warmer I let one bottle get almost luke warm before this review and it was far better. Still not the worst beer I have had. With everything said this was a ok beer with a high ABV."
""
""
"Overall, while I was excited by the aromas in this brew, the flavors didn't quite match up the promise, and I was especially disappointed in how fast the flavors faded with multiple sips. The beer is not bad by any means; in fact, even after a few sips there are still enough flavors standing out to make me continue drinking, but I wanted a bit more out of this one."

"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with the label clipped at September 2012. Sampled on January 28, 2012. The pour is very dark brown to nearly black with little to no head accompanying it. The aroma is mellower than the 9.5% ABV might suggest with sweet malts, hints of coffee, and a subtle hop character. The body falls into the medium range. As for the taste, I get some toasted dark malts in the beginning with an average bitterness and clean hops at the end. The beer is enjoyable enough but not out of the ordinary."
"O: Very good beer for the style. It plays like a melody of malt, coffee and chocolate, with a bitter kick. This is a beer to be enjoyed slowly or it will sneak up on you. I would recommend to anyone. Enjoyable but doesnt get the respect it deserves on here... weird."

"The smell of coffee, bold taste and high 8.5% alc. content. This beer is on my, to drink list."
""
"Part of a batch of beers I got while on the road for work."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pokal, the beer is a dark, deep, almost black, ruby-brown coloring with a thin, small bubbled, light tan colored head that settles out into a thin film. Aromas of rich, smokey molasses, and sweet caramel invade the nostrils. Flavors give a roasted coffee character first and foremost, with an underlying hint of the dark, rich molasses, a smokey highlight, and a hint of licorice. For all of the sweet attributes, the beer remains very well balanced. The aftertaste is more of the smoke and roasted coffee, with the sweetness regressing rapidly from the palate, leaving you with a crisp, dry finish. Tasty brew."

"Overall I thought that this was an OK Doppelbock. For being classified as a Doppelbock, it really doesn't have a lot of things that you would associate with the style, it's pretty dark, had some chocolate and coffee flavors, and had a low amount of sweetness. The thing that really surprises me about this beer is the drinkability, it goes down super smooth, I don't pick up any booze in this beer, I don't know how the hell they hid the 9.5% but they did, it would be easy to drink a couple of these in a sitting. What I liked most about this beer was the drinkability and aroma, it goes down super smooth with no harsh booze taste, and the aroma was pretty chocolaty, not normal for the style but still good. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor and the body, the flavor was just too plain and subdued and the body was just a little too light. I won't mind drinking these in the holiday pack but I won't seek them out on their own. This beer is still worth trying, the drinkability will really surprise you. It seemed like Atwater sacrificed flavor for drinkability, I wouldn't mind a little sweetness and booze as long as it had a more robust flavor to follow it and more dark fruits. I love how smooth this drank but hate how flavorless it is. Some major tweaking would really help this beer but I don't know if you could add more flavor to it while keeping the alcohol so well hidden. This beer really doesn't fit the style but it still comes out as the best of the Holiday pack, for how smooth this beer goes down for being 9.5% makes it pretty easy to get drunk. but the lack of flavor really hurts it. Even though this wasn't a great Doppelbock I am glad they added it to the Holiday Pack, this is the strongest beer I have ever seen in one. I haven't been impressed with the new beers I have tried from Atwater but they do have a way with hiding the booze, this and VJ Black are dangerously drinkable."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, it’s not a bad beer but there are better ones in the style that I would pick first."
"overall: I feel like a few punches were pulled with this beer. It's good enough to try once, but nothing to write home about."
"The sourness is unexpected and makes this hard to drink. Otherwise, it's not a bad dopplebock I guess, but the flavor comes out of nowhere and is really off for the style. Maybe I got a bad one."
" Pretty dang good."
"Over all it's an enjoyable beer because there isn't really anything that is offensive about it. Just wish it had a little more doublebock characteristics to it."
"This brew pours out as a brown color with a minimal fizzy head. The smell of the beer had a decent malt aroma with a slight funk to it. The taste had this wierd sour flavor to it. Perhaps this had some oak in it. There wasn't much of anything else besides some malt. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad, some light carbonation and medium bodied. I'd like to give this one another try sometime. It is worthy of another round."
"Maybe they are going for ultra-drinkable brews of varying styles for people who don't actually like beer? I mean, their imperial stout had the mouthfeel of Diet Coke, and this is even thinner. Why do people buy this? I could see if it were some little brewpub that focuses on food, but they bottle their beer and sell it with statewide distribution."
"Overall: Average."
"Pours a two finger khaki head that fades quickly leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hints of a caramel nose, flavor is malty, with some caramel. Drying finish. Higher ABV is hidden. $3.15 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"Final Thoguhts: I really don't like this one. Production is marked for Jan 2011 but it's 9.5 ABV and it was kept in pretty dark good conditions. It wasn't skunked. I'm surpised they let this one go out, it's really no good. The appearance looked great, but then you smell it and you just cringe. I normally like to put food pairing with the beers, this one I can't. I would never buy this one again unless they revamped a new recipe. I got to hand it to Atwater, I picked alot of things out of this one, it's just it wasn't all good."
"Overall: Easily drinkable and smooth, the toasted levels of the malts are great, although the aftertaste is a bit bitter. The alcohol is well hidden."
"OK beer, not exactly what I'm looking for in a doppelbock."
"Not one of the finer examples of the style, lacking in some of the traditional flavor and aroma traits that its peers possess."
"Pours a dark brown with a bit of a reddish tint to it. Quite a gusher. Pretty big tan head with a bit of retention and a slight amount of lacing. The nose is pretty odd with some dark fruits and molasses plus a bit of cherry character. Seems like this might be unintentional. The flavor further adds to this suspicion and I'm thinking this bottle might be on the verge of infection. The cherry taste isn't really melding into the profile of the beer and there's a bit of a pucker factor beginning to form. Feel is full of prickly carbonation. Not impressed with this one at all."
"thin, watery mouthfeel with medium-high carbonation. for what it's worth, it goes down easy enough. not easy enough to salvage the score, but, well, there it is."
"Feel is near flat, oily, & almost syrupy. Getting more & more difficult with each sip, it starts to turn my stomach & give me an ugly headache all at once. Ugh. I bet this is tolerable on draft though."
"My 13th Atwater Block review was no more lucky than the previous 12. Voodoovator is definitely not recommended. Actually, luck has nothing to do with the brewing of good beer. The process is 100% skill, which is where this outfit falls woefully short. Again... and again... and again... ad infinitum."
"Pours a dark brown, somewhat blackish color. Clear with a towering white head. Aroma is of slight roasted grains. The flavor is enjoyable, strong base malt flavor with slight roasted grain taste. Reminds me of an amped up schwarzbier. It doesn't, however, come close to a doppelbock. The strong munich malt character and warming alcohol presence is missing. Overall an ok beer, but not a good example of the style. Drinkability is good for 9.5% abv."
"Not an everyday beer, this is a big beer that lumberjacks and other burly types would probably enjoy with some roast boar."
"I'd say it's borderline spoiled, and the bacteria have been eating the sugar. We'll see whether Riverside Beverage in Chattanooga will give me money back for the four pack."
"12oz bottle. No freshness date. Poured a dark brown with a massive head that looks like a root beer float. Luckily I'm not in a big hurry to drink this one. This beer smells boozey. Aromas of molasses, spices and caramel malts. This beer tastes like liquid alcoholic black licorice. A bit too much spice taste also. I know this beer is 9.5% ABV but this is one alcoholic tasting Doppelbock. I like licorice more than most people but I am not really digging this beer."
"If you really like sour ales, give it a shot, otherwise pass."
"F: Finishes with more of the really bad flavors, some bitterness (not hops), and syrupy flavors. ALso some tingly booze and not so tasty. Bleh, I'm thinking drain pour!"
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. One inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of slight alcohol, slight dark citrus, sweet malt, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of a Doppelbock. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is an almost 'sticky' feel. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, strong grain, slight alcohol, and hint of hops. Overall, very sharp feel, with an astringent quality. Good appearance, but lacking in body and aroma."
"D: Nice, somewhat relaxing dark beer to sip on. Much more reminiscent of a porter than a doppelbock, but I guess the label doesn't lie."
"D: The beer is moderately filling but is not to difficult to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well hidden from both the smell and taste."
"Pours a deep, warm sable with a fairly thick, if not persistent, pale tan head. Aroma is not strong, but is malty and spicy and somewhat inviting. Flavor is malty, a little spicy, a bit on the thin side but still palatable. Texture is smooth, a little fizzy, just a bit watery. I've had better, but this is worth a try."
"I poured into a pint glass to two fingers of light tan head. It is brown with ruby highlights. I get cherry and roasted barley on the nose. The taste is pretty much the same. This beer actually goes down great for the ABV. I don't taste any alcohol at all. I don't think this beer nails the style but it has a certain drinkability."
"D: Could drink this all night - no real alcohol presence considering it's 9.5%."
"It started out quite well but fell off the wagon where it counts the most, for the life of me I can't figure out how something so strong tastes so thin. Interesting label though, got me to pick it up."
"So mostly what I've come up with on this one is what it is not (offensive) but not so much what it is (pretty good). I probably under-rated it, but it is well balanced and does not distinguish itself in any one category. For this low a rating I would still buy it again and I wish I had more. It was a bit pricey."
"D - not my bag, but I could see people liking it."
"D - Very low drinkability, I am 0 for 2 when it comes to Atwater Block beers, if you like thin, funky smelling bland beers this is for you."
"single from Ye Olde Wine Shoppe, Frederick, MD"
"Notes: I had seen this for a while in the shelves and while curious I had never picked it up, not until I was made a half price offer to pick up the 4-pack and try it. Thanks a lot for the chance (You know who you are :-). I´m not sure this is a repeat for me, although I would not mind having it again. I´m very grateful for the chance to try it though, and would love to try other offerings from this brewery."
"Drinkability is average at best. alcohol is hidden well, but kinda flavorless and thin on the tongue for a doppelbock. add some more coffee flavor and you'd have a decent black lager, but still something i would pass on. Have yet to try an Atwater Block Beer I like (having also tried the vanilla java porter), but I would try another."
"Pours darker than anticipated. Smells a bit sour with coffee and cherry notes. The taste is sour and tart with a short burst of rich maltiness. The aftertaste has hints of sour and malt but almost imediately dissipates and leaves me tasting metal. An overall odd mix."
"Not good. When I picked this up I thought ""hmm, never even heard of Atwater Block Brewery."" Guess I know why. With Founders and Bell's in their backyard, they don't stand a chance with a beer like this. I would, however, try some of their other stuff in hopes they can do better."
"Not terrible, but I'm not a fan and won't be back."
"Pours a dark brown with a red tint. A large tan head forms and has excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. At least it looks good. Has a aroma like red wine that has turned. Hints of vinegar and cough syrup. The flavor is not that impressive as well. Slightly sour with a touch of vinegar. I expected a malt bomb and was greated with a slightly sour dark lager. The malt just disappeared. Dispite the high ABV, alcohol was not detected. The body is average but may be hurt more by the flavor profile. Does not feel as big as the brewer claims. This will be a beer that I will avoid in the future. Not well made and tastes nothing of a doppelbock."
"Maybe I got a bad bottle, but who knows. This one just was not doing it for me."
"D- I'm hoping this was a bad batch because I really like this style but I'm wondering since I had a bad experience with the other Atwater brew I had tried previously. I'll try it again if I see it but I'm not holding my breath."
"I'm guessing Karl just had his too cold, but I would agree that the head is large. Pretty dark with ruby edges, but when held up to light it was pretty clear. Obviously no hops, but I was expecting that. Some coffee, a hint of smoke, and then overwhelming sweetness. I'm sad I drank all four as I thought it may get better. For me, this was quite unimpressive."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a dark almost opaque black that shows slight ruby highlights when held to light. The beer is topped by a thin, diminishing khaki head. Aroma is deep burnt caramel malts with hints of molasses and cocoa. The taste is surprisingly dominated by sweet fruits, very off for the style. The beer is somewhat heavy with a slight alcohol presence. I have to wonder if this one was just off, way more fruits than malt in the sweetness, not one I'll bother with again."
" D- This beer has a smooth light flavor but a bit thin. The apple flavor grows and covers all other flavor."
"A: Very dark brown to black in color, ring of frothy head along the edge of the glass - 4.25, S: Black licorice and molasses on the nose, I also pick up a fair dosing of milk chocolate and Nestle Quik, strong aromas of cherries and dates - 4.25, T: The palate follows suit to the nose, lots of sweet malts with a touch of roastiness, alcohol is very nicely masked considering it is at 9.5%, a subtle hop bite that provides some woodiness - 3.50, M: Medium bodied - 3.00, D: A very drinkable beer, not generally my style but certain an example I can appreciate - 3.50"
"This beer is a gusher. Seconds after opening the bottle it was everywhere. It stopped once I poured some into a glass. However, it quickly filled the glass with foam well before the whole beer was poured. It took over ten minutes to fully pour this beer. How annoying. Once poured it is a clear dark brown color. The head is huge, and recedes slowly. The aroma is of caramel, burnt malt, and a hint of chemicals. It is a very weak aroma for a beer that claims to be 9.5% ABV. The taste is more powerful than the aroma, but that isn't a good thing. There is more malt which is nice, but there are more chemicals too which is surely a very bad thing. The mouthfeel is full bodied with way to much carbonation for a doppelbock. Overall, this is a really bad beer that I will never drink again."
"Overall, not bad at all. A very malty, thick and bready beer. Truly a meal in a glass."
"On tap at RFD in Washington D.C. Dark beer, whitish head, minimal to low carbonation. Smells like roasted malt, no real hop character in the aroma. Also no hops in flavor, that's OK for a doppelbock, just making a note of it. There is some smoke, more than I expected. High malt character in flavor. There is no aftertaste at all, beer finishes completely. Very drinkable, really like this beer. Mouthfeel is full and great."
"Overall a good beer that's heavy, but just a little too sweet. If chilled very cold these go down too easy and that 9.5% ABV could mean trouble. I recommend trying this beer as I've had a few over the past few weeks and thought it to be enjoyable as a late night treat."
"Pours black, hard to see light shine through. Nice thick, tan head. Decent caramel aroma. Delivery was better than expected, nice mellow and moderately carbonated, crisp feel. Fairly mild beer for it's category. The label is better than the beer, but would drink again if offered."
"Drinks great as far bit, there is little to no, but some may get hung up on the unique flavor of this doppelbock."
"Pours a dark brown with beautiful mahogany hues when held to light. Bubbly beige head dissipates, but impales the glass with loads of lace. Smell is very sweet, caramel, brown sugar, apples, some alcohol. Taste is full of prunes, brown sugar, caramel, cherries and maybe apples. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, carbonation is medium, body is a little thinner that expected. Decent brew, but I think this may not be the freshest example of this brew. I wasn't overwhelmed with this one, not overly turned off, maybe one day when I get a fresh pint at the brewery I can revisit."
"The first time I had this, I loved it. The second time I had it I wasn't able to properly assess it. Third time is a charm - this is a great doppelbock! Cheers!"
"A good beer and surprisingly drinkable for the strength. Color was dark brown, carbonation was good, smell was outstanding and the flavor was very good. I had no idea, until just now, what the abv was on this. That explains the nap I had to take afterwards."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, medium body, flavours merge to a most agreeable finish including sour plum, caramel, nicely balanced acidity, carbonation seemed low, bitterness and sour fruit intermingle; a little bit syrupy at times. Alcohol very well handled. This is an acceptable middle of the road Doppelbock that's well worth trying."
"Poured a deep, deep brown with a lrage dirty white head. Nose is funky and faint with a big grain smell. Not nice. Taste is rather ordinary, nothing really stands out on this one except caramel, Mouthfeel is astringent and uneasy on the palete. After having a great Einhorn Doppelbock this brew just does not measure up."
"D- There isn't really anything about this beer that makes me want to have another."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a strong biting carbonation; the carbonation kills and otherwise good mouthfeel."
"Nice slick half finger across the surface of light brown hue, dissolves at a decent clip, haphazard lacing left behind. More black than brown in color, very dry and malty nose, like a bag of powdered chocolate, mocha, cocoa, all that shit, lots of roast but stops short of coffee bean, oats and granola, any fruit has a pit or skin quality, dried as in not dried fruit you buy, forest scrub or moss, it's not tightly woven per se just not expressive. Medium-bodied, the foamy attack subsides through to the mid-palate, here the roast is much higher and does bring a coffee bean edge to the dark chocolate, cocoa bean base. Has that same unprocessed grains feel, dry and crunchy even, plays well off the round maltiness. Some black licorice too. The carbonation might have a touch more prickle to it, stir the flavors up some. Drinks smoothly but after half a glass you're starting to lose interest."
"12 ouncer w/o freshness/bottling information. Pours dark amber, under a short lived capand then leaves minor lacing. Lots of malty caramel in the nose. Malt bomb. Boozy w/ notes of more caramel, light cola and burnt sugars. Quite dry in the finish and on the tongue after the swallow. Eh, nothing special, but not terrible for those of us who enjoy a malty, sweeter brew"
"[Note: Looking at other reviews of this beer after I posted mine, I do not see any other mentions of sourness or yeastiness (though one review mentioned a slight smell of metal which could hint at the same thing). It is possible the bottle I drank was compromised. Nothing about it struck me as infected, but I will try another bottle and see if I think I should revise my review or not. As it stands though this is easily one of my least favorite doppelbocks.]"
"D: Moderately drinkable. I could enjoy 1 or 2 in a sitting. I liked this beer considerably. Great addition to a cellar, but I would advise against excessive cellaring as it might tone down the beer to the point of unfortunate lack of character."
"The drink is light-medium in body with subdued carbonation, and is plenty easy to drink despite the abv."
"Taste was what you'd expect from a dopple. Caramel, dried fruit, malt and just enough hops to get your attention after the swallow. Carbonation was light, which helped the very smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability, despite the ABV, was pretty damn good. I could def do more than 1 or 2 of these. Whether they're worth the high ticket of admission is another story."
"1138"
"D - Hides the alcohol bite very well for an almost 10% and I could've put back a couple more of these. Great warming beer."
"Edit: Lowered the taste and mouthfeel scores a half point. I had a few more of these and it is just too thin. The taste is not bad but lacking anything special. I am also going to say this is not a 9.5% beer. Maybe it was just the batch I had but I have had enough strong beer to know what it should taste and feel like and this just doesn't have it. I wold be surprised if it was over 8%."
"Dopplebock no, more like doppleCROCK, I think im done with this brewery."
"D - overall, it's 'different' and drinkable."
"D: I would order another and buy a sixer of this. A colder weather type of brew, say 50F or colder."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a dark purple color with a brownish head that formed with an aggressive poor. The aroma is clove, some cherry, and a roasted malt. The taste is a little gritty and has some fruitiness that I was not expecting. The overall aftertaste is of metal. Not the greatest example of a doppelbock."
"This one's about average for me. I was hoping for more up front in the nose but given it's a doppelbock there's not going to be too much there compared to a stronger ale. The slight sourness was a pleasant surprised but other than that I was relatively ambivalent about it."
"Have this one on its own or with cheese, but, whatever you do, don't let it warm."
"Notes: thought i remembered this beer being a little more rich the first time i had it. seems like it should be for not just a dopplebock but also having a high gravity. you can never tell the alcohol is there. now im thinking its kinda pricey for what you get. great beer though"
"(3.3/5)"
"Overall expected a bit more malty presence from this beer."
"D - A very balanced beer that's easy to drink. I really liked this one."
" ~ The look and aroma are obviously the finer qualities in this brew. I expect allot from a doppel and I believe this is a good beer. But, it's not something I'll purchase for myself. I did get this as a gift and it came in a four pack. I've set the other three aside and will cellar them for future consumption. When the time is right I'll crack another and add notes to this review."
"Taste: Kind of a letdown. Like the smell the taste is kinda light."
"This is a decent DB, not nearly a favorite. It lacks in some areas but worth trying."
"Pours brownish with light brown overflowing head. Smell is strong malty. Taste is a bit harsh, its fresh and carbonation is above average. There is strong malt and it is boozy, even a little woody and corny. Not so drinkable.Medium mouthfeel.Found at The Village Beer Merchant this week."
"Not the worst Doppelbock I've had but certainly not the best. It's alright but I probably wouldn't buy it again. Does hide the alcohol quite well though."
"As one of my first experiences with Weizenbocks, I thought this was rather enjoyable. Despite having a strong flavor, it is easily more drinkable that some heavier beers with similar taste characteristics."
"D: A solid good drinking doublebock. Rich, rewarding and fit to style and wont go to waste. A solid good recommend."
"Notes from 5/24/07"
"Really really good experience. I generally don't like DB's because they are too rich and syrupy, but this beer is refreshing--even chugalicous--not gooey, goes down like a bock or dunkel. I'd love to be able to get this on tap. Goes great with a meal."
"D - i love me some DB's, and this one doesnt disappoint, very pleasant and warming beverage, well done"
"Well, it misses the mark compared to the classics of the style by a mile or three. Although enough is ""there"" to go in that direction. Out of style, or different interpretation of the style, well - even there, nothing special. Not too fond of the sourness that doesn't blend particularly well. Still, it has something to make the oddness not ""bad"". The alcohol is reasonably well-covered. Finishing ""one"" is fine. But, wouldn't get this one again."
"Drinkability: so-so at best. This one needs to be a thicker in body and mellow the alcohol a bit for a more drinkable beer."
"One thing I really liked about this beer was that despite the hefty 9.5% ABV, it went down pretty easily and hardly any alcohol was detected... Kudos on the drinkability, yet the overall taste definitely could've been richer and thicker..."
"Overall- Starts off nicely but slowly fizzles out near the end. Regardless give it a try. My 1st from Atwater and decent enough."
"My first from Atwater. The Voodoovator pours a semi transparent brown color with ruby red highlights an a small off white head. Sweet and nutty roasted grains in the nose. Smokey and sweet to the tongue, lots of woody/earthy tones and chocolate malt, cherry and baked banana flavors. No hop character or spice to speak of, no booze either. Medium bodied and pretty damn drinkable."
"drinkability - I thought I was going to love this beer. I didn't dig the sourness at the end, it was hard to finish off the beer. If you lilke sour beers, porters and stouts, you like this a lot."
"What a weird Dopplebock. Either contaminated or I have no idea what they were going for here."
"the alcolhol is hidden but this is a sipper. Very sweet."
"Temp - 45 degrees."
"D- It's a good drinker. The deceptive strength can really sneak up on you if you're not careful."
"Drinakbility: I like pleasantly sour Doppelbocks, but this one needs to lower the tart and sour flavors and increase the roasted flavors. A little bit more dark roasted flavor should do this beer some justice. Would I drink this beer again? If I was in the mood for a sour berry Doppelbock, I most certainly would."
"I'm a dopplebock fan, one of my favorite styles. This is missing that rich chewy malty body that makes a dopplebock what it is."
"Don't know about this one. Nicely drinkable but has some serious flaws."
"Served in a flute. Pour was a gusher; glass was 80% rocky, tan-colored foam that continued to ooze forth from the bottle during the tasting. Brew was a fairly translucent brown with ruby red highlights when backlit; lots of sticky lacing present on this one. Nose was malt, brown sugar towards the back and toffee/caramel in the middle. Taste consistent with nose, but a chocolatey character dominates. Mouthfeel is what ruined this beer for me. Somewhere between light- and medium bodied, but way too much carbonation made it difficult to drink. Drinkability was greatly compromised by the over-carbonation on this brew; however, alcohol was very well-hidden for the abv. Might need to revisit this one again in hopes that it was just a bad bottle."
"Quite tasty."
"D: An excellent doppelboack. A high ABV limits how many I would have, but if you enjoy this style, this is a great beer."
"Drinkability - though my exposure to Atwater has been limited, this is my favorite so far."
"D: Really weird beer. Kind of good but kind of weird. I would not seek this out actively again."
"Nice dark burgandy tone. Thin light brown head. Sporadic patches of lace are created on the walls of the glass as I drink. Aroma's malty and rummy. Not particularily strong for a Dopple though. This is a solid tasting dopple bordering on very good. It just doesn't have the richness and complexity to be called great, but it's good. Nice malty tones with breadiness resembling bread pudding create the base. Alcohol is hidden very nicely. Hard to believe we're looking at close to 10% here. Nicely carbonated and medium to medium-full in body. Nice drinking Dopple and quite enjoyable."
"Picked up a single even though it's not really doppelbock season. This wasn't bad, just kind of weird tasting. Kind of artificial-sweetener tasting at times."
"Overall impression: A big, malty, slightly sour lager. The sourness is suprising. I'm wondering if it's the combination of 2 crystal malts and munich in the grist (per the website). It didn't seem sour like it was infected but I just kept getting those sour cherry notes which makes me think it was malt and yeast driven. Big and interesting but not sure I'll revisit."
"D- Very highly drinkable for something this strong. id have another one, but id need to be in the mood for it."
"Notes:	This beer didn't set well with me it needs a second go. It was like a soda that fermented."
"the definitive beer fail"
"This is a rich beer with an impressive appearance. With an APV just shy of 10%, this is a beer with which to finish the day."
"After finishing 1 bottle from the 4-pack, I was happy to give away the remaining 3 to friends who wanted to try it."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, with no hints of the 9.5% ABV, but still, a fairly flavorless brew. Had someone given me a few chances to name the style blind, I may have said: Stout, Porter, or ESB, maybe some others. But Doppelbock? No way. Glad I didn't buy a 4-pack and only got a bottle."
"Sample at Gallo's Taproom in Columbus. Pours dark brown with red around the edges. Thin and creamy beige head that dissipates quickly, and spotty lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and dark fruit. Medium-bodied with flavors of caramel malt and toasted nuts, plus some hops. ABV is well-masked. The finish is mildly roasty with a grainy malt aftertaste. Just average overall."
"Thanks to kkulacki for the gift. Pours unceremoniously, short lived head, overly carbonated look. Brownish red. Sweet and tinny odor, some chocolate and toffee smell too. Tastes malty, and a little bit like fake cherry juice, with a metallic note to it too. Maltiness is sweet and slightly astringent on the finish. An unbalanced, kind of weird dopplebock that doesn't impress me too much"
"M + D: The alcohol does end up being quite well hidden in this one, aside from a pleasant warming down the throat. A bit of a foaminess in the mouth that is decent. I almost would have preferred a little more creaminess to it, but it's nothing I'll lose sleep over. A decent take on it, but not the most memorable, I suppose."
"Pours an extremely dark brown color, almost block with a thin lace of head. Smell is almost all liquor with slight a malty aroma to it. Taste is very malty, but surprisingly fruity too and with minimally bitterness. Goes down smooth moderately carbonated. I expected more from this one, especially from a doppelbock. Not a much to get excited about."
"Nicely done!"
"Not my thing for this style. Too much bitterness for a dopplebock, not enough malt and associated character. Mouthfeel seems wrong."
"Last swigs: Worth a shot for the curious but nothing to brag about. LAcks the full flavor punch. Maybe we are spoiled in the SE PA land of milk and honey and dopelbocks like SlyFox and Victory."
"Taste was strange to me. I could taste the sweet malts that were dark, but not very roasted in flavor. It has a sort of bready, belgian flavor mid palate that seems off to me for this style of beer. It finishes with a touch of hop flavor to cut the sweet. There is virtually no alcohol presence in this beer which is listed at 9.5%. I believe i have had this in my DBF for about 4 months which could contribute to the lack of alcohol taste or burn, but all of it gone? that alone makes the drinkability good. I am not sure i would pick this up again if i saw it, but not a bad offering if someone handed it to me."
"Clear, deep coppery-amber. Nice, creamy, beige head with good lacing quality. Smells sweet with caramel malts and the lighter of the dark fruits. Light herbal tea-like hops blend nicely with the sweetness. A medium body is lifted by a good amount of fine carbonation. The flavor mimics the nose in both ingredients and lightness. It is pleasant, while not complex, and drinks much lighter than the ABV suggests."
"Overall: I am usually not a huge fan of this style of beer but this one won my heart from the first sip. Tons of bold flavors which struck me just right. I am beginnig to beleive that the hop devil don't serve a bad beer, and I have yet to start my Kuhnhenn reviews."
"Great to sip though."
"Surprisingly drinkable considering the 9.5% alcohol. Easily my favorite of the Atwater beers."
"It's fun to play in, but not all that I was hoping for."
"Just a good Dopplebock, worth checking out."
"D - This is a very good dopplebock with a powerful ABV (9.5%). My first Atwater Block beer...I hope all the others are this good."
"D; Easy, no carbonation. A good waffle beer."
"D: Definitely a desert beer. One and done."
"Drinkability is surprisingly high for the alcohol content. It drinks very smooth, however it was much lighter than I was hoping for."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, warm, malty scent that boasts of caramel and roasted malts. It's got a patent malt earthiness to it as well. The taste is good also. It has a smooth roasted and black malt taste. It's dry with bit of burnt toffee sweetness. It goes down easy and finishes with just a bit of warmth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's got a complex malt bill and is full flavored."
"Pours dark-brown with an off-white head. The aroma comes off syrupy and sweet with caramel malt. I'm tasting apple right off the bat, but it's not really an overwhelming taste. It is surprisingly fruity as I'm also getting red grape and dates along with the cocoa and roasted malt. This beer seems to be missing the big Munich and licorice malt flavors. It's not bad, but not quite par for the style. It also feels highly carbonated at the first sips with fine bubbles but is also well balanced to make it drinkable. I'd call this worth a try if you want a different sort of doppelbock."
"The dark mahoganny color was nice with a fluffy head. Smell was alcohol and burnt malt. The taste was swett but not overpowering with a nice coffee {lihht) finish. This is the smoothest beer I have ever drank that had this much alcohol. It also had a slight peppermint hit to it. It is a real winner. I will buyy again."
"Pours a very dark brown that looks cloudy. Small tan-nish head that keeps with a small film of head. Mild sugar on there. Smells like the candy they make bracelets out of that you bite pieces off. Then there is some wood on there too. Then there is some minor caramel notes. All of it adds up to very little really. Flavor is okay. Smooth, yes. Full of character, no. Sweetness rises up several seconds in and really sings on the tongue for a bit before it dies down. Just not much else going on really. Nothing interesting. Feel has a good carbonation and the liquid is good. But overall this is one not exciting dopplebock. Even the 9.5% alcohol doesn't really mean much when I don't feel motivated to finish it."
"I just didn't get a lot of enjoyment out of this beer, but it wasn't bad either. I bought this as a 12oz single from Brew&Brew in North Ridgeville, OH."
"The bottom line: Atwater Block provides a serviceable, though not spectacular take on the doppelbock style. I wouldn't hesitate to have a pint of this if I was in the mood for a doppelbock and it was the only one available, but vis a vis the other options out there, it is only so-so."
"D: Very tasty and dangerously drinkable. I hope theres more left at the store."
"The aroma is dominated primarily by caramel, along with some malt and molasses. It is pretty sweet, dominated by a dark-fruit, almost cherry characteristic. There's really not much going on apart from this, except for a mild alcoholic burn on the finish. It seems to be lacking the weight that a doppel should have. It mainly a sugary, syrupy front, with no complexity or anchor on the finish. Not very impressed."
"Maple syrup color, nose of caramel and nutty sweet breads. Slightly sweet malty flavor of caramel, nuts and toffee. Finished drier than it started which boosted drinkability. I enjoyed this with some surprise as I confess a bias towards Atwater due to previous experiences with other beers. Very well done for an American Doppelbock."
"Drinkability- I suppose it is quite drinkable considering that it is so light and watery at 9.5%. It could sneak up on someone having many, but this is the sort of thing I wouldn't be reordering right away."
"Pours black with a tan head. Aromas of a sweet, malty caramel chariteristics. In the taste, sweet, with a small presence of coffee and chocolate. A smooth yet malty mouthfeel and a malty small chocolate aftertaste. Hides the 9.5% well, but not really fantastic. I thought it was more stout-ish than a doppelbock, and yet a bit watery."
"The mouthfeel could be a little thicker, but the carbonation is pretty good. The abv isn't too noticeable, but neither is the beer."
"D- This ended up going down at a pretty decent clip. For how much alcohol there is in this, it is fairly well hidden. There are better doppelbocks out there, but this is an interesting take on the style and worth a try."
"The drinkability is great I like this beer and am glad I have 3 more. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Flavor is very malt heavy as well. I get brown sugar and molasses with a bit of chocolate too. Some warm alcohol comes through on the finish. Fairly drinkable even with the mild heat. No hops on this brew. Pretty nice beer, but could be a little sneaky with the hidden 9.5%."
"Pleasantly surprised, as my tastings of Atwater brews over the years haven't been very pleasing. This is one of the better attempts I've seen at the style (for Michigan). Not up to par with the Germans, Atwater has some refining to do for this brew, but it has promise."
"M?D: very enjoyable beer, nothing too crazy good, but somethign i could easily enjoy again"
"This beer got better as it warmed up in the glass, and was a fine all around beer. It's big at 9.5% ABV, but the brewers did a fine job masking the high alcohol content. I'd be happy to revisit this one once the weather starts to cool off a bit."
"This beer just simply doesn't have much going on with it and almost tastes like it's a little infected. Sour notes rivaling that of a Jolly Pumpkin brew. The only real flavors are burnt caramel and chocolate squares of different variety. Mouth is a bit creamy but there is no finish to help this stand up and out. Very dissapointed after sampling there Dunkel which I found to be very sessionable."
"I remember trying to figure out why this beer was a couple dollars more than the rest of the Fathead's take out selection and always had a hard time figuring out why. After trying it out besides the higher alcohol I'm not sure why the price mark up happened but this brew appears a very dark ruby brown tone with alarge tan head formin thick and leaves behind even streaks of lacing. Aroma has a roasty cocoa powder, a bit muted or even dumbed down with mild fruit raisin and other dried fruits soaked in alcohol with a minimal herbal hop nose. Flavor is sweet and roasty in the malt department provides some cocoa powder and mild fruitiness the alcohol is actually hidden pretty well in the taste with a touch of caramel, but overall I'm not getting a real authentic doppelbock feel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a harsher kinda abrasive carbonation touch of a sticky texture that tends to cling onto the palate. Drinkability is decent but I'm overall underimpressed and another factor in this beer is the need to watchout for the hidden alcohol."
"Taste starts out with smooth milk chocolatey sweet malts. Scorched Sugar Babies, and candied cooked vegetables follow. Slightly meaty and tobacco-y. Sweetness stays throughout, with mildly bitter noble hops in the finish. Not bad. A fairly straight-forward example of the style, without a ton of complexity. Medium-bodied with a very creamy feel. A tad thinner than I like. Very smooth and the 9.5% abv hides itself very well."
"Overall, a very good beer. If you like big lagers, this one's for you."
"12oz. bottle poured a dark brown with a small tan head that didn't leave lace as it quickly dissipated into just a slight film over the top of the beer. The aroma of this beer is a very faint caramel malt and no noticeable smell of alcohol for a 9.5%. Taste and feel seems a bit watery at first with some slightly darker fruit malt flavors like plums and raisins. This brew seems to lack in the flavor department but is a very easy drinking beer with a well hidden ABV that I'm sure would sneak up on you if your not careful."
"Mahogany in color, with some ruby highlights. Off white head holds well for a few minutes, then fades. Lightly roasty, toffee, and fruitcake aroma. Caramel and toffee flavors, but does not have the depth of the classics. Very smooth. Sweetness in the beginning. Medium body, with lower carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden. A decent brew, but not at the top."
"A welcome break from most bastardized American versions of such a classy brew. VoodoVator at least measures up to the style pretty well. A muted aroma or syruy malts, fruitcake, caramel, and rum promises rich flavors and good drinkability. The flavors closely mimic the aromas, following up with a light peat-moss smokiness, and complex dark / dehydrated fruits (dates, figs) and solid toastiness. The feel is sweet, but not heavy. The alcohols are well hidden, but warming and sweet. The finish gets a little 'cola' like in it's sweetness and tackiness -- falling back on it's darker color. Overall, a very solid brew, but lacks the punch to be considered great."
"Easy to drink and flavorful doppel, dangerous at 9.5abv."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a slightly smaller body than I expected. The beer has a medium body.This is not a bad beer and I wouldnt turn it down."
"Not a bad beer. Certainly worth a try. There are no off flavors, but nothing to make this one really great either. Very balanced, and I found the woody, nutty flavors interesting."
"Drinkability - I rather liked drinking this beer. Though it lacked complexity in the flavor, it was overall very enjoyable. I would have this one again - nice on a very cold winter night."
"Sweetish malts and molasses in the aroma, which as stated, did not follow through quite enough in the taste. Nice lil sour ale aspect in the finish, along with an pop of alcohol as the brew warmed. A decent drinker, nice winter brew."
"this is a ver good beer very smooth, hides the alcohol very well."
"Thanks Vancer!"
"This one has a nice label. It pours a very dark color with a tall head that falls slowly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty and sweet with some hints of chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is very sweet. Plenty of malts are upfront with the sweetness and there isn't much hop character to be found. There is a hint of astringency that comes across the top, but doesn't take much away. The alcohol is hidden extremely well. The body is moderate, surprisingly, I expected it to be thicker than it is. The drinkability is very good for the level of alcohol."
"I poured this twelve ounce bottle into a glass beer mug. It is dark with a tan head. Both in smell and taste it is very carmely, nice. Slight hint of hops to dry the end. Very malty, and sweet and I like that in a beer. The alcohol is certianly there, yet the beer is very smooth. I plan on buying more so I can share it with a buddy."
"Pours a deep brownish red with ruby highlights and a reasonable head. Aroma is mostly minerally. I would like a slight hint of noble hops or malt in the smell. Taste is appropriate, munich malty goodness. Mouthfeel is thin for the style. Very drinkable though."
"not to shabby of a beer...has intersting logo! this is the second of a Atwater Block Brewing beer that I have had and both, so far, have been alright. This one is nothing to brag about but worth the try."
