Smell is of malt, dark fruit, toffee, leather, tobacco, soy sauce, and slight cardboard aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit, leather, tobacco, soy sauce, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

This lager pours a brown hazelnut color with very little head or lacing. The aroma is very malty and warming with notes of dried fruit and a little toasted malt. The mouthfeel is a little sticky and close to full bodied. The flavor is rich and deep, lots of malt, almost a fruitcake like quality, and a nice warming alcohol bite. This is a nice beer especially on a cold day. I look forward to trying more of the style to get a better idea of what they should be like.","lochef81","Apr 28, 2014"

While this is definitely a sweeter beer, the boldness of the dark fruits, roasted malts, grassy hops and light minerals, and even the faint alcohol heat all balance out the sweetness perfectly - I don't consider this overly sweet or syrupy in the least. Glad I got a case of this, will definitely pick up another case next spring - highly recommend.","blackcompg","Apr 13, 2014"

Pours slightly cloudy reddish copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slight foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, pear, apple, raisin, toast, brown bread, floral, toffee, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, molasses, raisin, pear, apple, brown bread, floral, light pepper, toffee, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, pear, brown bread, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate fruity esters; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice doppelbock style. All around nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on.

3.51,-7.9,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.75,"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the nicely inclusive aroma, and its ease of drinkability. From the first look at this beer things seems a bit light. The coloring sits lightly, but never offensively so. The aroma and the taste, too, are on the simplistic side, and are definitely out of balance. While each gives big sweetness through the caramels, esters, and cloying fruity sugars, the roast never quite comes up to meet or even it out. While this is a decent representation of the style, we usually look for something that shows more depth and roast to the malts, and more darkness throughout.","TheBrewo","Apr 18, 2013"

It's a straight-ahead doppelbock that's enjoyable to drink, but doesn't offer anything to separate it from the pack. Malt profile could be mistaken for a Scotch ale, which is fine by me. This would be a great candidate to barrel-age and add those characteristics to give it more complexity. All-in-all, this beer is one that I'd order because I wanted to take a break from tasting really distinctive brews and just wanted a solid but unchallenging malt-forward beer, and the menu lacked an exceptional option that couldn't be missed. One thing to note: priced in the high-teens for a six-pack, there are much better options in this style for the same amount of money.","BuckeyeSlim","Mar 07, 2013"

Quite fizzy carbonation going on here. The aroma is very powdery and candy-like. Lots of fruit esters coming up in both the aroma and flavor - apricot, plum, purple grapes, and raisins. The taste is smooth and bready, coating the mouth fairly well, and despite the 8% ABV, it's not too boozy. Overall, this is just like the best German Doppelbocks I had tasted the times I spent visiting there. I can't believe how smooth this is...

4.6,20.7,4,4,5,5,4.5,"Pours a very light brown, bordering on amber. A gentle pour brings little to no head to speak of, and what there is dissipates quickly. Clear, no haze. Smells malty of molassas and licorice with a touch of hops to counter. Mouthfeel is light and delicate with just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down extremely smooth. Sweet up front with a tinge of alcohol. Fairly complex follow up with notes molassas and honey. Tastes like a dopplebock should, in short. Has zero bitterness in the finish. In fact, a sweetness lingers on the tongue making you want more.","bigkingken","Mar 22, 2012"

Toffee, caramel, malt comprise the flavor. The flavor offers more depth and complexity than was indicated in the aroma. Slightly sweet. A malt forward beer, as is expected in a dopplebock.

The smell of malts were on the nose along with some sweet aromas too. The taste is a little sweet kind of like caramel or brown sugar mixed with a roasted bitterness and some dark fruits also.

Color was a deep dark-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with a caramel malt sweetness. Wow! This might end up being breakfast and lunch today, followed by a nap. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, but the flavor was rich caramel on the tongue. Man, this could be a dessert beer, easily. Finish was rock-a-bye-baby smooth, lulling me that much closer to a nap.

4.03,5.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a weisse-vase glass. The beer pours a deep, vibrant, ruby-auburn coloring with a healthy, thick, lightly foamy off-white (almost cream colored) head. Aromas are sugary sweet malt, light toffee, citrus, and a bready quality. Very interesting, and very dense aromas. Also some darker fruits that sneak into the smells, like some fig and date. The beer is tangy sweet, but light, on the initial taste. There are citrus flavors that ride the undercurrent of the beer that help to keep it light. There are tangy caramel flavors, with the slightest lean into sour, that hit the middle of the tongue, and the end flavors are a little spiced and slightly boozey. The body is surprisingly crisp despite the roundness of the flavors. The beer has an aftertaste that is dark fruit sweetness...very rich, but still light. Crisp and light finish, with a slight drying effect at the end. Very strong production, and a very tasty, well balanced brew.","GarthDanielson","Jun 01, 2011"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark amber/dark brown body with a thin, creamy off-white head. Good retention and slight lacing throughout. Smells of caramel, a touch of brown sugar, and a slightly fruity sweetness... all malty sweetness and not much for hops. The taste follows and adds a bit of earthy hops but well balanced and not overly sweet. Full body, medium carbonation, and a smooth finish. Overall this was a great dopple- easy drinking and alcohol is well hidden.","gnemesis","May 16, 2011"

Just bitter enough to keep the sweetness in check. Nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is medium moving towards full, with a good amount of carbonation. Overall I was really happy to get to try this one.

My only critique is that it came off a little thin for it's style and could have been a little thicker. This beer had great drinkability, it went down smooth and did a fairly good job at downplaying it's 8%. I have been trying some different Doppelbock's lately and so far this one has been my favorite, I thought this beer was better then Maximator. I would buy a six pack of this to keep around for a while, if you like Doppelbock's you have to try this one, it gives some German ones a run for their money. Its nice to see another quality brew from Bell's and one that can hold its own against its traditional German counterparts.","StoutHunter","Apr 15, 2011"

A 2.5-3 finger khaki colored head rises up in my glass, but retention is just average and there is zero lacing to speak of. The nose is surprisingly fruity. There's a hint of caramel and roasted nuttiness for sure, but fruits are the dominant influence. Those same comments apply to the flavor as well. Caramel and roasted nuts show up, but fruits steal the show. Some of the same fruits as I might find in a Dubbel or Belgian Strong Dark Ale come to mind (plums, raisins, etc...) but they're a little bit less dark and rich and a bit more sweet and mild. The carbonation is well done, it does its job wthout getting in the way of all the malty flavors. I found the body to be just a hair on the thin side though, especially for a beer style that was known as a meal in a glass. Consecrator is a solid offering from Bell's, but nothing outstanding.","axeman9182","Oct 25, 2010"

The aroma was comprised of yeasty malt, dark chocolate, and slight cream. The flavor was of bread, sweet malt, grapes, and a hint of raisin. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this honestly reminded me of malty grape juice. With that said, I don't really know how I feel about this one at all. I think that if it would have been toned back on the grape a little bit this could have been a good brew. This would allow more of the flavors to come forward rather than taking a backseat to the grape.","thagr81us","Oct 25, 2010"

There is a slight soy sauce aroma and a grain husk and yeast scent. The flavor begins sweet and fairly grassy and grainy with a figs and oak after taste. Fairly thick there is a quite strong grain hull flavor here and it is quite astringent in the mouth. Fairly nutty in taste this tastes the most like pecans. The bitterness is present and fairly laid back for a bock beer this is very much a malty beer and not a hoppy one.

There's just a little alcohol notable but the flavor dominates and is quite pleasing. It's solidly mid-bodied with spritely but modest carbonation that is fairly drinkable considering the intensity here, but you wouldn't want to pound these, there's too much complexity to enjoy.

The beer is dark amber with some light brown aspects as well. The tan head was a few centimeters thick, but disappeared quickly. It has a great toasted malt aroma. There is some brown sugar in there as well. It's all very robust. I can taste some sweet malt, some brown sugar and a bit of the alcohol. There may be some plum in there as well. It's a very tasty combination. It has a heavy body and low levels of carbonation. There's plenty of mouth coating with some alcohol vapors present. I find it to be pretty drinkable on a per glass basis. I wouldn't want to drink too many of these in an evening, but this single pour is very enjoyable.","ToasterChef","Mar 29, 2010"

Taste is carmely sweet at first sip, mellowing out to nutty, pruney, rasiny and slight brown sugary and biscutiy profile with a decent amout of bittering hops on the end. Medium to full bodied, slick and oily on the palate, lacking carbonation.

Glowing dark brown beer with ruby highlights. Rich malty flavor is mildly sweet. Plum and dark sugar flavors peak their head in later on. A very slight bitterness cut the sweetness in the finish, but that bit of hops never threatens the malt dominance. There is a pleasant warming in my chest from the alcohol. Moderately carbonated with a fairly full body, but the sweetness never becomes overbearing. A great example of the style.","HappyHourHero","Mar 24, 2010"

A boozey blast from the smell, too. Taste is very syrupy, especially going down. Some more caramel and some sweet toasty malts. Just a bit of the hop kick, but by this point the syrupyness has re-asserted itself. Not that big in body, thin for a doppelbock. It's definitely coating, but in the wrong way.

The beer has a beautiful mouth-feel that lingers. It pours a dark, dense brown with an intensely contrasting, compact head. While the hops are restrained and the malt forward and enveloping it is well balanced. This Dobbelbock is a perfect meal replacement during lent. It is also a fine companion for meals that we may seek when weary and hungry.

It is a pretty sweet beer with flavors matching the aroma. Maybe slight raisin along with the sweets. A fair amount of carbonation in this medium bodied brew. There is just enough hops to give a slight kick at the end. To me, this makes it a good version of the style.

It's a tad subdued, to say the least. There are hues of sweet fruit and cloves, and the malt base is nice enough, but it isn't powerful. Hops and vanilla round out the finish, with a lingering sweetbread aftertaste that is quite unique.

3.41,-10.5,4,3,3.5,4.5,3,"This doppelbock is a deep brown/red with off white head that lingers. The nose is incredibly subtle to the point where you have to struggle to smell anything. Maybe you get some light malt smell, maybe a bit of alcohol and some dense fruitness. Taste is nice sweet caramel and a little balancing roasted malts, followed by an ethanol finish. The mouthfeel is great; it's very smooth and even creamy... at least until the lingering alcohol finale. Drinkability is just average, with the mouthfeel being a plus and the tasteable 8%ABV being the big minus.","shivtim","Jul 23, 2006"

Nose is subtle, not as strong as I'd like to see in a doppelbock. Smells sweet and of dark stewed fruits ... raisins, plums, and black cherries. Slight alcohol scents detectable. Palate is very unexpected. Difficult to describe ... very sweet and fruity, but almost in a candy-like way. Lack of carbonation and thinner mouthfeel lend to a fruitjuice-like taste and feel. Body, like I said, is lighter than I'd have thought. Finish is sweet with some bitter hopd offsetting. One of the oddest doppelbocks I've sampled. It's good, but very unexpected. Definitely not a good example of the style, but is worth exploring on it's own merits, I think.","beerphilosopher","Jul 22, 2006"

No caramel, no roastedness, hardly a touch of malt or hops, just filth.

Malt is just this side of cloying, a bit overly sweet. ABV stays pretty well-hidden. Mouthfeel is slick and syrupy, not too carbonated.

Taste is slightly bland and kind of uneventful; some maltiness, sweet grains, smoke woods, some dark cherries and fruit. Not bad, but oddly askew. Mouthfeel was slightly dense and thick, but not to the point where it was comparable to a stout or something of that nature.

Carbonation is medium, as well. Taste is caramel, with only a hint of toffee. Very fruity, with apples, pears, and raspberries. Very odd for a doppelbock.

An almost wine-like character and a similar body; a bit thin bodied for my tastes. The smooth mouthfeel that one expects from a doppelbock also is missing. Strong vanilla aroma. Vanilla bean-like flavors emerge as this beer warms up. A perilously drinkable double bock. As is the case with most Bell's beers, the high alcohol content isn't that noticeable, it doesn't hit you until your half way through your drink.

I suspect that they used Bell's Ale yeast for a lager, as I get a similar taste off of the Amber and the Oberon, which are good for that style.

Smell is relatively subdued with minor notes of malty sweetness and a hint of alcohol. Taste is incredibly sweet, almost too sweet for the style, with a sugary sensation that I did not care for. Big time caramel malt is all I could really pick up. Mouthfeel is very thin for the style, and due to the overdone carbonation, it's hard to detect that great, full-bodied bready mouthfeel that most dopplebocks possess. Drinkability is average -- the alcohol is somewhat hard to detect on the way down due to the sweetness, but it's noticeable after drinking the beer.

Honeyish sweetness and toasted malt hit the nose at first, then are contrasted by a tartness akin to unripe plum. Richness in aroma is provided by a lightly buttery, toffeish melanoidin / dark caramel malt combination. Caramelized fruit sweetness hits and coats the palate initially, then is bathed by a detracting sourness reminescent of sour sop. Sourness tapers slightly, allowing sweetness to reemerge in a toasty, bready fashion, only to be offset by light, yet mildly astringent hop bitterness. Becomes thin, oddly vinous and sherrylike late. Over attenuated, but passably smooth. Finishes with diminished lactic tartness fading quickly and token residual sweetness fleeting. Hmm.

Deep amber with orange and red hues making mostly brown. Clear. Felt the warmth quickly, but that may be because my stomach is mostly empty. Some fruitiness, some richness, somewhat complex.

First taste is oddly sweet, and overly fruity, melons, yea honeydew melons ? Is that what they are called. Tasted like a hint of those then faded. Syrupy sweet, cloying malt flavors followed. Some toasted flavors come and go, but not consistent at all. Nearly slick toward the end. Carbonation bubbles present to start, but not at the finish. Not much carbonation on this one either.

First sip reveals a bit of sugary sweetness then quickly yields to a warming alcohol presence. The 8.0% is noticeable in this beer. I was hoping for more of a caramel note like Salvator or Celebrator but it doesn't seem to be there. The aftertaste just says alcohol like a more subtle shot of vodka.

Lighter bodied but consistant feel front to back. This is certainly a different take on the style, but unlike other Doppelbocks in name only (like Leinenkugel's) it has complexity and good flavors.

Sweet tastes like dates and raisins are evident.  Layered tastes like fruit cake and caramel apples come through if you look hard enough.  Dopplebocks are not one of my favorite styles, but this is a good one.  Right up there with Celebrator, S.A. and Sprecher.","Bighuge","Mar 14, 2002"
