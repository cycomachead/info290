No real hint of the alcohol and not a whole lot of nose. This came recommended from the bartender, but I just wasn't that impressed. Had some nutty and woodlike notes, but overall, just not a lot of flavor. Nothing else really bad about it, the taste that was there was good.","cambabeer","Jun 18, 2014"

While worth a try for those that appreciate Belgian yeastiness, this is one of those beers that makes me appreciate splitting six packs with friends so I don't have to look at 5 more bottles for the next year.","Hendry","May 05, 2013"

Smooth Hoperator pours an amber-brown color with three fingers of very well retaining head. The aroma is very rich with caramel malts, but there's plenty of citrus and pine hops hanging out on the nose too. The taste is excellent, the malts rule the show at first, with some caramel and toasted malts up front, but the finish belongs to the citrus and pine hops. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side for a dopplebock, and the light carbonation is spot-on. Overall, Smooth Hoperator is a robust beer that should appeal to fans of maltier IPAs and dopplebocks alike.","shand","Jan 22, 2013"

Smell: floral with spicy, grassy, and sweet citrus notes. Sweet, slightly grainy. Taste: quite sweet... caramel, sweet apple, earthy, nectarine, herbal with a little orange citrus.

A thick caramel malt lends more feel than flavor, but there is a faint sweetness from caramel and toffee. The resiny taste has a tobacco quality that is strong, taking over the balance of this beer to the point where its close to overbearing. Not bad in reality, but it does seem to overpower other flavors that are a bit more subtle. Definitely a generous use of the hops, but a lack of really great balance affects my view on this one.

If it was a blind taste test, I would've though this was an IPA upon tasting it (if it got past the aroma).

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, oranges, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, citrus, citrus hop, and grapefruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew! A Doppelbock!? Holy Christ... I was thinking this was an IIPA until I read the style on here.

Wish it were just a bit darker, but otherwise very nice. The smell is mainly noble hops, maybe just a bit of American in there, or maybe I'm just thinking of the American approach when I smell it. Something new, but not what I hope for in a doppelbock. Not even a whiff of dark, sweet, chewy malts. The taste is about the same. A sharp, spicy, minty hoppiness. Not a lot of bitterness, maybe it was sucked up by the malt, but I can't really taste it either. With some effort, I can taste a bit of caramel sweetness, no chewy, bready maltiness. I like the feeling of the noble hops, but a doppelbock, there's no doppelbock feeling here. This is more like an Alt, and a strong one at that. It still drinks kind of smoothly, with almost no notice of the 7% ABV. It doesn't hit the doppelbock spot, but I enjoyed it. Don't expect anything and you'll probably enjoy it.

3.93,0.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for this one. It pours a clear deep amber color. The head is two inches in height, fluffy, and recedes very slowly into a lot of sticky lacing. The aroma is of very hoppy for a doppelbock, or any other beer for that matter. Grapefruit, grass clippings, with hints of caramel and toffee underneath. The taste is a little maltier than the aroma, but is still dominated by hops. Caramel leads the way, but is soon cut in half by the sharp hop edge. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer for what the brewer intended it to be. A wiser BA than myself once said, "I can tell you if a beer is high quality, and I can tell you if I like it, but the answer isn't always the same." I can tell you that this is a high quality beer, but I am not a huge fan of hoppy doppelbocks. Still, props to the brewer for stretching the definition of beer.","KarlHungus","May 09, 2008"
4.21,7.7,3.5,5,4,4,4,"This beer is very good and quite unique. It is certainly a hybrid of sorts, that does blaze its own path. The beer pours a copper color amber with some retaining head and lacing. There isn't much carbonation, which reminds me a bit of the doppelbock or octoberfest in the beer. The smell is very pungent floral estery hops. The smell is amazing. The pine scents just last and last. It truly is an amazing aroma that is unlike most hopped up ales. The taste is IPA in part with the estery, somewhat oily and chewy hop bite and grapefruity puckerishness. But there is a doppelbock element to the beer in that there are caramelly amberish malts, a medium body, some sweet almondy flavors, and a slight flatness in terms of carbonation. The malty sweetness blends so well with the estery hop bite, that the beer is incredibly unique. The mouthfeel is slightly oily, the hops linger but don't overpower. This beer is well worth seeking out.","albern","May 03, 2008"

Finishes with more earthy hops and an ever so slight alcohol touch protruding. Medium in body, good carbonation, just as smooth as the name suggests with a nice bitterness.

An interesting apple like aroma dances in the nose throughout as well. Taste is unique as well, but in a good way. This is a doppelbock? Taste is mostly hops with grapefruit and slick pine coming through. Towards the end is where the malty flavors emerge. An enjoyable carmel sweetness in the aftertaste with a slight floral and lemon zest. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Medium body with a subtle carbonation. Goes down so easy. Amber ale? Doppelbock? Pale ale? Who the hell cares, this is a damn good beer. Thanks again Dan for hooking me up.","BeerTruth","Dec 23, 2007"
3.28,-16.1,4,3.5,3,4,3,"I was quite surprised to see this listed as a Doppelbock. The hop character is clearly the dominant note here; even to be an American interpretation the malt really needs to play a bigger role here (this is of course my own opinion though as this beer clearly shines as an example that I am wrong). This really does not work for me even on a purely hop driven level as the garlic / herbal hop character of Summit hops is just a bit too dominant to be enjoyable. This is just another beer that proves to me how much I really do not like Summit hops.","Gueuzedude","Nov 14, 2007"

Then the malts hit you in the finish. It's got a sweet crystal malt taste as well as a dry roasted malt flavor. The hops create such a bitter palate. It resinates on your tongue in the finish.

Flavor comes off upfront leafy herbal bitterness, piney hops really are the highlight with some rolling blended caramel malt rather spicy with a biscuit bready tone to it finishes pretty clean with some hops sticking around. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is rather light despite the large bubbled nice sized head flows even with a slick oily finish.

With that in mind, I don't believe it hits the dopplebock mark head on but it one of the best I've had to date. The out-of-style big hop presence really adds to the style in my mind (which resides in my hophead). So having now been to the Stoudt's website and seeing that it is listed as an American Dopplebock, I say hell yeah, if Americans can their own IPA, then why not the dopplebock.

Light toasty malt character with a good dosage of leafy hop aroma. One wouldn't really expect this to be a lager, but it is pretty clear from the aroma, clean and lagerish smelling with a greater amount of higher alpha hops. Very hoppy tasting, too. Bitter upfront with some tea-like tannins shining through, some residual sweetness pulls through and finishing dry, crisp and smooth. A nice alternative to an IPA. Medium to full bodied, slick on the tongue, with a healthy carbonation level. A very nice lager with hopheads in mind.
