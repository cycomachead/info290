3.83,5.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy, amber-copper coloring with a low profile, dense, foamy off-white head. Aromas are rich and malty, with a burnt toffee backbone and some roasted coffee highlights. Smells rich and complex. Thankfully it tastes rich and complex, as well. Roasty and smooth, there are some nutty sweet overtones blending with the toffee and biscuit profiles, which all lends itself to the overall layers throughout the brew. Smooth and bold in mouth on a mid-body feel, the beer leaves a fantastic lacing along the glass. The aftertaste is a hint of the tangy sweetness and roasted flavors, leading to a slightly lingering, smooth finish. Good brew.","GarthDanielson","Feb 24, 2012"

Taste is a bit off for me as i feel the alcohol burn on this one. off balanced with astrigenty bitterness that overseas the malts. leaves a very dry, bitter, austere flavor of old cough syrup. Mouthfeel is weird becuase its got a tingly thing going on with the carbonation. rolls off the tongue well but leaves a bitter dry feeling on the palate.

Some lacing. Smell was not as pronounced as other doppelbocks I have tried. Taste was good overall though. Some dried fruit notes with a hint of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel was smooth but not as thick as I was expecting from this style of beer. While its smoothness aided in the drinkability, it let me down a bit, as I was looking for a heartier beer for the evening. The abv is well hidden.

Smell is heavy on the caramel malts, however for a dopplebock it doesn't really seem to have the punch that I would expect. The taste follows suit. A pretty tasty malt profile, but too watery to really get excited about. This is definitely a good beer to have with a meal, but not something that I really would be interested to drink again on its own. Medium/full bodied. Not bad I guess. Actually it reminds me more of a nice English Brown Ale, and if it was classified as such then I would possibly give it a higher score.","alcstradamus","Jun 30, 2009"

Nose is of caramel malts, toasted malts, some dark fruits and a touch of hops. Taste is of caramel malts up front, with dark fruits moving in to the backgrous - raisins and dates mostly. The finish is a hop presence that evens this beer out. Medium body, moderate to light carbonation, goes down smooth with a dry finish.

Slight sweetness throughout, an interesting hop punch at the end. No malt punch, no taste of dark fruits or anything like that. It has something undescribeable about it, it almost taste rusty (not literally rusty, but like a little dingy). Finishes dry and toasty (toast like bread). Seems to have a metallic aftertaste. Low on carbonation, seems fairly light in body for the style. Lacks creaminess, doesn't really flow well. Overall, a hearty meh. There are so many better examples of the style. This one doesn't actively offend, but the metallic taste seems to come out more and more as it goes on. That's the big offender here.","damienblack","Mar 31, 2009"

Beyond that there is a thick malt presence. As times goes on (and the drinking does too), the sweetness becomes less intense and more smooth. Though the malty sweetness does remain. Feel is thicker, slick, and smooth on liquid. Carbonation is lower and appropriate. Pretty easy to drink and overall not too shabby. It's a difficult style to pull off.","RblWthACoz","Mar 19, 2009"

It's more bizarre to find a few of their beers then in Brooklyn. Oh well, I suppose it gives more 'cred' to the skinny-jeaned beard posses....Regardless, I was happy to find & indulge. A nice shimmering pour of dark brown-honey sat with a short head but some good white lacing. The aroma was good & malty, almost a caramel spread on toasted wheat bread with raisins. The flavor continued this, but added a strange almost garden soil & pepper taste, which added some girth, but odd nonetheless. Dry hops finished the taste off. A strange but appealing dark lager; I wouldn't quite call it a doppel bock though.","selecter70","Mar 15, 2009"

3.94,8.5,3,4,4,4,4,"A clean dark amber beer. Has a small fizzy beige head that disappears quickly. There is a solid sweet nutlike malt backbone in the aroma with hints of spices around the edges. Great toffee malt notes rush over your tongue with hints of vanilla dancing on the sides. A quick glimpse of hops on the finish but the malty character takes over again with coffee and spice notes.","ybnorml","Jan 02, 2009"

3.9,7.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This is my 5th doppelbock to date. Considering the other four where (Celebrator, Liberator, Instigator, and Sam Adams) I feel this stacks up pretty well for the style. Not as sweet as Sam Adams and not quite as good as Liberator or Celebrator, but I feel it is at least equal to that of the Instigator","shaebs99","Jul 16, 2007"

3.75,3.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours an amber brown color, with an impressive, creamy head. Good head retention to this beer, and it had good lacing. On the nose one gets a complex aroma of malt, ginger, and citrus/bitterness from the hops. On the palate, one gets a roasty, malt flavor initially, but it finishes with a touch of dry bitterness. There is some cherry and melon flavors, but not all that much. Frankly, I could wish this beer had a bit more too it. It was interesting to try and was not like any doppelbock I've had prevoiusly. Ultimately, I thought this was an OK beer, though nothing special.","John_M","Beers"
3.74,3,3,4,4,4,3,"I think that as an after-dinner beer shared with friends, or maybe as a fireplace-with-a-book sipper, it's really nice. But the drinkability just can't pull through for a full pint with so much spice in it. And the 22 oz bottle doesn't help - I wonder if it's put into 12 ouncers? Overall, it's an interesting spiced lager that's probably worth trying.","NeroFiddled","0"

3.95,8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a cloudy copper with a decent head and good lacing. Smell is sweet malts, sugars and plums? Sweet maltiness continues in the taste, with a clean hop not on the finish...alcohol undertones. Medium mouthfeel, with just a tad of cloying. Smooth overall in the drinkability area...nice dry finish.","edchicma","Mar 07, 2006"
3.35,-7.7,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a two finger light brown head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a little lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nutty nose. Starts malty but not very sweet, hops are there, finish has a bite. Not as sweet as the usual dopple bock. Alcohol isn't noticeable. $5.20 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","Mar 05, 2006"

4.1,12.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" beige head over the cloudy copper brew. Head lasts nicely, with average to good bubbly lacing. Aroma is fruity malts, with a whiff of alcohol mixed in. Taste is surprising robust grains upfront, light fruitiness in the middle, and a slightly bitter close, with subtle warming. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both nice, very approachable for the style. Could be a nice crossover into the style.","ppoitras","Jan 03, 2006"
3.78,4.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"M & D: Very good mouthfeel being well balanced. A tad on the heavy side, but not overpowering and to my liking. Carbonation is medium to low, but thats a good thing as it doesn't take away from the spicy malt flavor. Drinkablity on this is pretty high depending on your love or dislike of dopplebocks and malt. I would have another bomber if it was in front of me. Good work by Cape Ann--keep em' comin'!","bjohnson","Dec 28, 2005"
4.18,15.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"All around this was very drinkable. My first pucker at the fruitiness made think it was going to be a battle to get through, but after warming up to it, I seriously enjoyed the hell out of this beer. I recommend the draught version at the SG&T as Ive yet to try a bottle.","GolgiIPAratus","Beers"
4.11,13.2,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is really a great beer that easily holds it's own against the other big 22oz bombers on the shelf next to it. The fact that they're doing a big lager is even more impressive. Cape Ann has found a real winner here. It's a shame this beer isn't more prevalent.","taez555","0"
