"Poured from the bottle into a pilsener glass. A dark reddish brown beer with a shapely off-white head, with an aroma of light toffee, dried dark fruit, sweet wet grains, and some mellow spice notes. The overall aroma is homogenized, with the elements merging together. This smells like the Platonic ideal of a bock beer: A classic brown lager. The palate is similarly well-integrated, with no sharp corners or overtly bold flavors ... No one component tries to trump any other but there's complexity nonetheless. Quite crisp and dry for a doppelbock, with moderate carbonation and body on the thin side. Tastes like brown bread, nutty yeast, molasses, light rum, earthy ginseng spice, and sweet dough, with assertive hopping for the style. Finishes quite crisp and clean with some lingering noble hop spice and grass notes. Certainly well-crafted, although perhaps I was expecting more body and a richer, more sweet flavor profile."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, apple, toast, toffee, molasses, brown bread, light roast, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with light hops. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, light roast, floral, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toffee, raisin, toast, dark bread, light roast, floral, light pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance malty flavors; with a light hop balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent doppelbock style. Very nice complexity and balance of malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"A bit too sweet and apparent booze, but still flavorful and warming."
"Pours a dark-brown, cola colour. Head fades away quickly, leaving some sticky lacing behind. Smells of toffee/molasses and a note of real liquorice. Taste is semi-sweet molasses, with a mild hop bitter, along with a coffee-ish bitter flavour in the finish. Picking up up some notes of fig preserves in there as it warms up. Body is between medium and full; carbonation is barely detectable. As I expected, another finely crafted beer from Schloss Eggenberg."
""
"Overall (4): A real model of the style that does a lot of things very well. Good balance in the malt flavours, with strong but not overpowering alcoholic lingerings. The mouthfeel is really solid complimenting this robust, but smooth, beer."
"anyway, overall, this is an interesting brew. i need to do the sami now to see if it is the brewery which produces this peculiar taste or if it is the ingredients. or the region? i want to say i like it. it's certainly a HEAVIER doblebock than the typical german variety and very sweet, still... i give it a 4.5 overall simply for the memories... but it rightfully deserves it."

""
"Bottle was 11.2 oz."
"Overall: complex and fun flavour for an easy drinking brew; balances everything perfectly, from sweet to bitter, crisp and smooth, complex and familiar"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice Doppelbock, but not quite up there with the most complex Bavarian ones. I had high expectations on this Doppelbock from the brewery of Samichlaus, but yet again - the complexity is not what I hoped for, rather than expected."
""
""
"Over . My go to Bach."
""
""
""
""
"O - With the flavour on the lighter side how did they manage to hide the alcohol? It's quite easy to drink."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with ok flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent doppelbock, but not my favourite. I wouldn't seek out another bottle and I'm hesitant to say I would even suggest that someone try it. If you're in dire need of a doppelbock and this is available, it would satisfy your craving but don't expect anything special."
"O - Nice and easy drinking for 8.5% ABV."
"Chestnut brown with a fast receding head that doesn't lace. A delicate toasted bread note is difficult to pick out from behind it's powerful ethanol aroma. Tastes malty and sweet upfront with bread and brown sugar flavours before a note of watered down coca-cola comes through midway. Finishes a little boozy with some light bitterness. Just shy of medium-bodied with low carbonation. Lightly syrupy. Lacks weight. This is an enjoyable enough beer, but it doesn't hold a candle to Celebrator, Salvator, Weltenburger, or Optimator."
""

"Though I tend to like my doppels to be malty monsters, I do enjoy this lighter take on the style. All the flavors are there, but it ain't quite so heavy as some of the others. Affordable too, might pick up a few more for the pre-Easter drinking season."
"Filtered mahogany, with some ruby and violet hues as well. White head with some larger bubbles really, some remnants of a head and a thick sticky collar persists. Lager yeast and hop notes are there, with some toasty bread and caramel right alongside. Not too sweet, but a bit on the drier side. A bit of grain and dark bread. Warming and slightly alcoholic on the palate, more caramel and toffee slides through as anticipated, gets sweeter as it warms. Lightly fruity and gentle toasty malt notes. Not a ton of complexity but straightforward. Light bitterness in the finish, but sweetness and alcohol wash over this. Medium-heavy feel, and drinkable. A nice affordable doppelbock, I could seek this out again."
""
""
"Overall - The best part of the beer is probably how well it hides it's alcohol. The taste is decent but nothing that will wow you. Also the mouth feel leave a lot to be desired. I wouldn't pick this one up again but it was worth a try."
""
"M- Thin to medium bodied. Medium carbonation with a slight warming from the alcohol."
"Transparent cola brown colour, one finger of off white head, light lacing left behind. Smell is malty, cereal/bread like grain quality, light chocolate and coffee, sweet caramel scents, some light fruity qualites and a bit of alcohol. Taste is malty, sweet caramel, toffee, some raisin flavours, moderate bitterness, some alc in the finish, dark breads and some chocolate in the finish. Sticky feel especially in the back of the throat that took some getting used to, medium carbonation, syrupy and full bodied. Not bad but easily forgetable, worth a shot but there are better examples out there."
"Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Bitter on the back end with the booze lingering in the finish. Definitely drinkable although my constitution would be tested putting back a six pack."
"This is an easy drinking beer reminiscent of brown ales. It is good with a meal or as an appetizer and if the alcohol were lower it might even make for a fine session beer."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is lightly fizzy and refreshing, especially when taking into account the 8.5%abv.; it’s good that the beer never tastes too sweet as the hop bitterness does render a considerable balancing influence, and the sourness typical of a well-lagered bock beer also makes itself felt well enough. Not as good as the same brewery’s other Doppelbock, IMO, perhaps due to the less depth from the malts used, but still an easy-drinking heavy beer."
""
"Quite interesting. Although I'm not sure of the age on this one, I can tell based on the oxidation flavors present that it's probably been at least a couple of years since it was bottled. It is aging quite well, so I give it points for that. Underneath the oxidation character, there are remnants of a good doppelbock, and I can see this being a much maltier, robust beer in its younger days. Good, but there are certainly better doppelbocks out there. Still, I'm glad I got the chance to try it."

"Overall Impression- A nice doppelbock but where is the body? Wish it had more depth and ingredient here. I REALLY enjoyed the toffee flavors in it though. Would definitely recommend if you can get your hands on this."
""
""
""
"This was very tasty, I'm surprised it hasn't scored higher. Poured a 2"" beige head with reasonable length. Clear dark burnt umber brown color. Smells not only of malt but fresh bread and that carries through nicely into the taste. Body is lighter than the smell and taste would lead me to expect. And it cost me under $5 which to me is pretty good for this quality of import. Nice."
"Overall: Solid, very quaffable brew."
"O - big in flavour and feel with the alcohol very well disguised, maybe a little over the top on sweetness, but still a fine example of the style"
" ~ I really like this doppelbock. It's just pungent enough to be a sipper but not so much that it loses any of it's drinkability. This is a good beer and one that I strongly recommend."
"This bottle is not the best of shape as lover of dopplebocks I will have to try this on tap some time. Underneath the smell of oxidised cardboard there once was a nice beer. Chocolate malt with nutty, toffee coffee backbone to this beer but as stated before the beer is not of the best of shape."
"O: Hopefully this was just a bad bottle, and I could not particularly tell, but there are much better Doppelbocks that exist."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. The components work well together and I think the rate limiting step is the alcohol notes that seem to build. This would be a great beer in autumn."
"Above average double bock that falls short of the top tier but should definitely be tried if one is a fan of the style. Dark brown color with rapidly diminishing head. Modest aromas. Nicely balanced flavor, good and malty, low bitterness levels. Booze is subdued, moderate roastiness. Carbonation is modest as well, fairly drinkable. A solid B overall. Not on the level of Celebrator but you could do worse. Not as big as it could be, I think. But then nothing every beer has to be a big bomb anyway, right?"
"Not bad. Copper brown with a very thick, white head. Creamy, bready small. Big malts, a bit of hoppy citrus notes. Toffee, malts, bread and even mild coffee in the taste. Low hops. Note quite as spicy as I would like. There's a very faint spice to it, hardly even noticeable. Alcohol not really noticeable. A bit thin, but not bad. Needs a little more oomph."
"great value for this one here in Alberta at 3.29$ its worth every penny but may not leave a beer snob impressed"
"Quite an enjoyable doppelbock, the hops more evident than usual for a European example of the style, and the expected elevated ABV not at all disappointing, in subtlety, or in assumed strength. Tasty, and well worth saving until the next time spring has a hard time wresting away the focus from a smugly lingering winter - so, next year, then."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how the malts don’t really fade out through the finish. While the beer may appear on the watery side, and look more like a soda, the malts in the flavoring made up some lost ground. They actually became more robust as the flavoring wore on, becoming the most intense by the end of the tasting."
"A style typically dictated by sweetness, this beer has little in the way of syrupy and sweet characteristics. But the depth of the appealing toasty flavors falls short. Decent but not a great value."
"O - Im a fan of this brewery and this is a well balanced dunkel."
"Just an amazing beer. I can’t express how nice an example of this style this beer really is. Based on other reviews I have a feeling this one was pretty well aged and many flaws have washed away."
" Grade B+ Purchased at Stoney's - $4.99 per bottle"
"Overall: I really dug this one. Considering the age, it held up well."
"Probably tied with Celebrator as my preferred doppelbock (and I've had as many of the style as I can find). Far above Optimator and Salvator, as well as some other harder to find imports. Haven't found a domestic that compares. The only drawback is it's price: currently $3.59 for a bottle."
"This beer is a deep copper color, very clear, with a thin, off-white head. The aroma is malty, with a metallic, slightly acetic and honey scent. The taste, though, is full malt. Very sweet. A mixture of melanoidin-laden and toasty notes. The beer does not have as much complexity and fullness as most dopplebocks. It's a decent and enjoyable beer, but that's about as far as it goes."
"D - This is a solid beer that I can drink and enjoy, but wouldn't go crazy over."
"D: Very drinkable for a doppelbocks, which is to say, one per evening, but you look forward to the next one."
"D: very easy to drink, nice balance and easy mouthfeel"
"Just a great beer, I didn't like Samichlaus on my first try, but this one I definitely dig and it gives me light for this brewery."
"i'll try another Eggenberg"
"Deep brownish-amber. One finger head. A very good-looking doppelbock! Smell carries currants, raisins, figs, molasses or brown sugar, breadiness, and a tinge of alcoholic aroma. Sweet sugary fruity malt with decent carbonation. Heavier body for a doppelbock. Aftertaste is yeast-driven. Only the slightest alcohol bite at the tail end... Deceptive for the alcohol content. Hops bitterness is rather muted, but suits the style well. One and done."
"A decent dopplebock, smells awesome, but down here fom there."
"Mmmm. Pretty decent. Pretty good in a different way. Poured with a small, fine, light tan head and no lace. Color is a crystal clear mahoganey. Aroma is roast, malt, toffee. Flavor is like nose plus has both sweet and bitter that are quite pronounced. At first I thought it was too sweet, then I noticed the bitterness popping up and taking over. Body is good and has good carbonation to cut the big sweet malt. Finish is like flavor and good, slowly dwindling."
"I tried this beer on December 13, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a transparent reddish-brown with a very thin long lasting tan coloured head. The aroma is sweet caramel malt with a little hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with mild carbonation. The flavour is sweet malt, some caramel, some toffee, and little bit of a bitter finish."
"First rate dunkler dopplebock."
"D- Nothing spectacular but enjoyable none the less. The bitterness, and dryness makes it meh."
"sweet? yes, but not too much for me, I rather enjoyed this one as many Doppels seem to just taste the same. this seems just like a nice traditional take on this and that comes through in the beer."
"Definitely not bad, but nothing I'd seek out again."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced. the real character of this one comes out once it has warmed a little. a nice doppelbock."
"Opinion: This is a good beer and I would be proud to have made it. That said, by today's standards this beer is quite sweet and I guess I have become accustomed to the drier and more attenuated/carbonated/overall lighter on the palate type of Doppels. Either way, this is a fine beer and one that should be noted especially if you want to IMO try something that may be more classic to the historical side of the style. I would certainly drink this beer again, and would love to try it on tap where the carbonation is controlled."
"1229"
"i am confused about this beer... i don't understand where it's going."
"Well, glad I got to try this but not something I will be picking up again..."
"A good Doppelbock no doubt. For the price however I probably will not readdress this for some time."
"Taste is malt and caramel and a little sweet chocolate. Not bitter or hoppy. The aftertaste is a little roasted malt. Mouth feel is average. Overall rather disappointing. Not enough spice or carbonation to interest me. I am comparing this to other favorite doppelbocks."
"Decent brew."
"Where is that 8.5%ABV hiding? It's not obvious, at all. While this is certainly not the boldest representation of the style, it is certainly drinkable. I'd enjoy this one again."
"D = It drinks easily enough. Not at the top of the list for my doppelbocks, but I one that is good enough to drink again from time to time."
"This beer was OK, but just OK - I doubt I'll ever pick it up again."
"This is an OK doppelbock. The alcohol is too strong and its a little too sweet, but its not undrinkable."
"Pours very dark amber, perhaps brown, almost like a cola. Nose and palate are reminiscent of cola also - the caramel sweetness at least, but brought in with a few other flavors. Head dissipates quickly, and it's just not terribly aromatic. Easy drinking, but just not an amazing doppel."
"Deep brown, mahoganey, clear sheer lustre with tan head, half finger, gentle carbonation, solid ring, nice lace. Molasses nose, sweet brown sugar. Taste is not bad at all, suggests toffee, cane sugar, touch of coffee, caramel, not as pronounced as some dopplebocks I've sampled. Bitter malt balance is alright, hard to believe this is 8.5 % ABV. This is a style I'm not overly fond of but this seems pretty drinkable to me. A little on the syrupy side and maybe a bit too sweet as it warms, I'm not about to be converted either. Prosit!"
"Doppelbock Dunkel poured a clear brown/ruby color, with no head at all, and no lacing. Smell was full of sweet chocolate. Taste matched the smell, very sweet. Mouthfeel was a bit thin. Very drinkable, don't notice the 8.5 abv. Overall this was not a bad beer, but there are so many better doppelbocks out there I just can't see my self going back to this one."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red, almost brown, very nice looking, thick light tan head forms, slowly drops to a medium layer, lots of lace sticks to the glass, great retention, looks pretty damn nice. Smell is nice, very malty, some caramel and brown sugar, toast and biscuity malts, very clean, light fruit, some raisin, alcohol, rich malt, corn syrup, iron, sherry, pretty nice. Taste is good, very rich and malty, toffee and raisins, some bananas foster, lightly spicy, toast and bread, brown sugar, iron and slightly astringent, alcohol is well hidden, dark fruit, cranberry and cherries, nice finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, very smooth for the ABV, but some warmth going down from the alcohol. Not too bad, like all Eggenbergs interesting and good but just doesn't have the complexity to have me going back."
"Nice drinkability, although the strength would have to rein me in quite a bit. Of all the Eggenberg beers I've tried so far, this is a clear winner."
"Poured from the 330ml bottle into a Maudite snifter. Body is a rich brown color with garnet highlights, and not much head to speak of. Lovely aroma of rich malt, brown sugar and toffee, lightly fruity hops, and just a hint of roastiness. Palate is sweet up front with notes of toffee mild stone fruit, and again with a hint of roasted malt just before the swallow. A lingering rich, brown sugar sweetness comes on the finish. Body is light, although not particularly effervescent, as is typical of the style. The 8.5% ABV is integrated really well, making this beer a pleasure to drink. I'm a big fan of doppelbocks, and this does not disappoint."
"Cool label with a top that gives the impression that the bottle will be a twist off (perforated around the cap), but it is not. Pours dark brown with thin head that quickly dissipates to a thin film. Smells relatively complex with roasted malt, fruit, and heat. First sip not too bad with a flavor that starts malty, a little sweet and just a mild bitterness but finishes up pretty alcoholic. Not terribly balanced there. Mouthfeel is a medium bodied and maybe a little thin. This is not one of my favorite beers that I have tried recently. It is a little boozy and sweet for my taste."
"Mouthfeel - creamy smooth with medium body and carbonation. Goes down very nice with no harshness from the alcohol. The carbonation flattens out by halfway."
"I would have figured Austrians could make a dopplebock as good as their German neighbours but if this example is any indication I'd be wrong. I've had a couple of less than stellar offerings from Castle Eggenberg now and I'm starting to become a little less optimistic about future encounters with Austria's oldest family owned brewery."
"This beer poured a dark brown with lighter brown accents and a thin head. The smell is sweet malt with some dark fruit and raisins. The taste is almost all a combination of different toasty sweet flavors, including raisins, toffee, and a chocolate with a tiny bit of hops and some warming from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some pleasant warming and fine carbonation. This is a surprisingly drinkable beer for the high alcohol content, an interesting beer that I'm glad I decided to grab on a whim."
"D- This is a pretty solid Doppelbock. The alcohol limits it's drinkability a little bit but it is a pretty tasty brew that I wouldn't mind having again. Worth a try."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep burgundy color bock with a large creamy off-white head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma of creamy banana bread with light toffee notes. Taste is a great mix between some banana bread and caramel and toffee notes. Body is a bit thin or the style with great carbonation but alcohol is bit too hot. Very well done overall but some less apparent alcohol would have been even better."
"D: Potent and delicious. Would be perfect for a large hefty stein. My deductions are mainly for the steep cost I had to pay for this one."
"A pretty straightforward doppelbock. Nothing really surprising but certainly worth a try."
"D - Not bad. Obviously not something to put down a lot of, but some solid flavour."
"What a great doppelbock. There are plenty of malty, fruity flavors to session with this one for hours. As it warms, even more flavors come out. This beer gets better with every sip."
"Good sipping beer for after supper."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown color with a thin beige head that quickly dissapeared. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, toffee and dark fruit. Very smooth with the 8.5 % very well masked. Creamy taste of chocolate, coffee and sugary fruit."
"This poured a clear, dark mahogany with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like fig, prune, raisin and honey wheat, with a bit of smoke and wild yeast and alcohol. It tasted like mellow roasted barley, sweet raisin and molasses, rusted copper hops, and a bit of oak and honey wheat. It was watery with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very nice beer with great smell and tasty flavor, and decent body. It was very clean and super easy to drink, and it hid the alcohol well. But I preferred to sip it to better enjoy the subtleties in the flavor. Based on the scent, I expected a bigger flavor (like a barleywine or old ale), but the flavor wasn't nearly that big. It was almost disappointing, but it was just too tasty and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Wow! What a nice big burnt and roasted Doppelbock. It had a great color, a wonderful burnt and roasted aroma, a good taste, and a decent mouthfeel. I'm glad I finally decided to crack open this Doppelbock. This is an under estimated Doppelbock."
"Pours a thin cola color with a whispy white head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of toasted caramel malt, light burnt wood or peat, and hints of fig or raisin. The taste is of a meaty broth, wet wood, a roasted malt with hints of raisin sweetness. The feel is thin for a malty brew and the alcohol has a slight noticable presence, the carbonation is thin and the brew finishes a tad sweet. Despite the 8.5%abv, this brew is quite drinkable as the body is thin. Some unique flavors makes this stand out from other dopplebocks."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a dark brown/copper color with half an inch off-white head that went away quickly. Lacing is OK. The aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like caramel malt, chocolate, toffee and raisins. The taste is similar to the aroma, with the addition of nuts, smoke, peppery spice and brown sugar. Both the aroma and taste are pretty good. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has average carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, the alcohol isn't very noticable at all, it's smooth and very easy to drink. It's a great beer for a cold fall/winter day. I think this is a pretty good dopplebock, if you get a chance to try it you should."
"A light-medium body with light effervescence. A plain, middle of the pack brew. Not worth searching for."
"I honestly dig Weihenstephaner Korbinian more than this, but I'd consider this one if I couldn't get the Korbinian."
"Drinkability - Very impressive. Not to the point of ranking this as good or better than a Korbinian (my personal favorate doppelbock, but damn close."
"D: its a nice dopplebock, but not amazing. high alcohol level, but smooth. worthy of a try but I think its the water at Schloss-Eggenberg that I dont like."
"Seems highly drinkable despite the high level of alcohol. A nice beer to finish off the night; not quite as heavy as some Doppelbocks I've had, and not too cloyingly sweet either. Overall, a nice example of the style."
"Alcohol not pronounced at all despite the 8.5%. Highly drinkable, but might start sitting heavy if sessioned. Worth a try if you see it."
"Not too complex, not at all deep, but drinkable, and tasty, too. Has it's moments."
"This had a clear brown color and when held to the light had a ruby color. No head, no lace. Smelt much like a light lager - barley malt and earthy. One of the best tasting beers I've had though. Sweet malt, almost appley, yet with amber roasted malt (caramel) and a light smokey character. Backed by a zesty hop profile. Tasted amazing. Thinner mouthfeel than your average doppelbock, not as meaty. But some spicyness from the hops and very smooth. Couldn't pick up the amount of alcohol in the brew and drank this at an enjoyable speed. Delicious beer, though not your typical doppelbock. By the way I found some strange thread-like shaped silicates I think. I may drink it again sometime to take better notes on the flavor."
"M/D - Full bodied beer with medium carbonation. Drinkable, but definitely a sipping beer. I really liked this one!"
"An okay doppelbock, well rounded. The alcohol is well hidden for being above 8%."
"D: A bit of a sipper, but fairly straight forward, otherwise. Alcohol catches up before long with anything like this, of course."
"An exceptional beer. Not quite as good as the Samichlause, but how could it be!?"
"Clear deep hue of burgandy. Thin and slightly bubbled beige head. It offers some stickiness to the glass. Nice aroma of raisin, rum, cinnamon and toffeeish malts. Rich malt base with notes of plum, brandy and brown sugar. Smooth and easy going mouthfeel. Medium-full body. Good drinking dopple with an agreeable flavor."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it's a decent beer I guess, but I don't think this is really the right beer for me to drink too many of. Something just didn't strike me right and I didn't like it too much."
"Drinkability: At the end of the day, this is a real disappointment for a doppelbock; it's on the bottom of the list for me"
"D - Reasonably drinkable for a strong beer, but a bit lacking in complexity and the sweetness becomes cloying towards the end of the bottle."
"Overall, a different and good representation of the style - very thick and full bodied and worth a try if you're a fan of the style..."
"An interesting and complex brew, but I have had better dopplebocks."
"A warming doppelbock. Malty with some balance. Not overly complex, and there are better doppelbocks out there. But, it's still a nice one to sip on on a chilly late winter/early spring day."
"So far I'm not impressed with Brewery Castle Eggenberg. Maybe Samichlaus Bier will finally change my mind. As for Doppelbock Dunkel, there are any number of German doppels, or even a few from this country, that deserve your hard-earned money over this one."
"A compelling beer, it offers a twist to the usual doppelbock flavor. Not sure I'd want it often, as the syrupy flavor and feel makes it something to revisit only occasionally. Definitely worth spending some time with."
"Drinkability: Their Schloss is my gain!"
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Not the best, but definitely enjoyable. The alcohol is well hidden."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a sweet, malty scent that boasts of chocolate and crystal malts along with a dry lager yeast aroma. There seems to be some roasted malt character as well. The taste is good. It has a smooth, malty taste that goes down easy and finishes sweet with a dry lager yeast element. It's not very exciting. There also seems to be some sort of off flavor in the finish. The alcohol is hidden well. The mouthfeel is average. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, but nothing I'd buy again. It's much too sweet and syrupy for me."
"D: a sweet rich bock providing for a good experience."
"Poured out a dark-almost black color,no head. caramel malts,toffes, cocoa,coffees on the nose. Taste is actually quite lacking, aromas were a bit more powerful. Medium-lighter side on the mouthfeel with a tarty finish. Actually quite easy to drink. A good dopplebock if you are new to them, but I don't think I will seek this out again."
"Poured a deep russett brown with some reddish tint a large fuffy slight off white head that settled into a creamy mass for the duration of the glass was nice.Kind of a green sour apple note hit it the nose along with some toasted nut and mineral and lightly sweet brown sugar,light to medium bodied creamy mouthfeel coats the mouth nicely.Lighter flavors really sweetish brown sugar and molasses tones along with hint of green apple with an underlying mineral note.Pretty standard but good nothing to go out of the way to find like I did today though."
"D: For the style and ABV a very drinkable beer. I think my friend said he paid almost $5 a bottle so that would not make this on the top of my list as there are better beers available for less. Worth a try though."
"A clear pale amber with very little head. Aroma is somewhat boozy, with a lot of powerful caramel and a little bit of what I think was anise. Taste is caramel again plus lots of dark, ripe fruits. Quite sweet, and the carbonation makes me think of Coca Cola (at least in the nose). Alcohol is warming but not overbearing. Tart aftertaste."
"D- This beer has a smooth rich flavor but the lagering really gave it a clean flavor, perhaps a bit to much of a clean flavor."
"D: Fairly average."
"Another spot-on choice of John, from Smokeless Joe's. Brown with soapy head. Chocolate malt with caramel, lots of lace dots. Smooth and creamy, good dunkel. Expirey in 08. Chocolate nose. Brown sugar, and it is on sweet side, though bitterness and a drop of burnt molasses"
"bottle from Beertopia in Omaha, NE. Pours a deep, dark purple with a slight yellowish white head on top. lacing is moderate. smells vinous and boozy, with hints of grape, coffee and caramel. Toffee and used bitter coffee grounds in the flavor. also some dry alcohol and old fruits. cough syrup taste and feel on the finish. Alcohol and bitterness are a bit over the top. mouthfeel is somewhat creamy.somewhat syrupy. I dont know about this one overall...it tastes unblanaced and with flavors that i dont really expect from a dopplebock. Not overly impressed and i don't think i'll be having this again."
"D: This one is quite an anomaly, at least for me, in the sense that it tastes like a relaxed doppelbock, which can be a good or bad thing. But the flavors won't offend, it really just depends on the kind of mood you're in."
"Poured a dark brown color with a medium head that hangs around and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of nutty notes with some chocolate and hints of alcohol. The flavor was a bit of a let-down. It has a nice dark malt character with plenty of nutty notes, but there is also an astringency and grainy character in there that takes away from the experience. The alcohol comes through in the flavor as well. The body is moderate and the drinkability is good."
"Though a mild disappointment, I still beleive that the beer is worth a shot. The pour delivered a promising deep ruby / mohogany hue, but with head retention that started fizzy and loosely knit, and finished quite flat with no lacing. The aromas swayed be back with a deep, almond scent with heavy notes of dehydrated fruits (plumbs, dates), and a hint of chocolate, kona coffee, and rich toffee. The sweet flavors continues what was experienced in the nose, but the bitterness seemed more distractive than complementary. Over-hopped with earthy, pungent hops later gave an astingency to the mouthfeel. Alcohols gain intensity as the sweetness subsides, and often crossing the fence to fusal territories. Grainy flavors persist into the aftertaste. A rich bready, yeasty, toasty flavor arises early, but offers very little quality to the body. The body weakens considerably into the finish delivering a cola-like flavor late. I would have expected this lack of quality from the majority of American breweries who attempt a Dopplebock, but not a classic German brewery"
"D: A decent overall beer - and I would have it again - but there are better beers out there."
"All in all, it was interesting, but the metallic-ness kind of ruined it for me."
"Into a pint glass, pours a beautiful dark crimson copper, a light tan head of a quarter inch sitting on top with light lacing. At first the aroma bursts out of the bottle, explodes out of the glass, but settles down a bit for the long drink. Toffee is prominent, nice malt blend, faint fruits, pretty nice. The taste is also yummy, brown sugars, toffee, molasses, raisin and maybe cherry, but a tiny, almost unnoticeable metallic twang after the end. The mouth is creamy, nicely carbonated, lightly warming, overall an interesting doppelbock. Not my favorite, but one I'm glad I found. Thanks to josephhaugen at Cellar's for recommending it."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but the Optimator I had before this one was better."
"Maybe there's something wrong with this bottle but it doesn't taste like any decentdoppelbock that I've had. I don't recognize any of the things that point to a poorly kept bottle. I couldn't finish it, preferring to use the calories on something I enjoyed."
"Overall, a decent brew, but not something I am likely to try again."
"Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and very smooth with the low carbonation, and the drinkability is only decent with this being so sweet. I could definitely only drink one of these in a night."
"Despite the fact that I can't really taste it, the alcohol seems to bevery prevalent on the nose. Mouthfeel is great, but I'd like to have a little more malt character and sweetness. It is nice to have a relatively clean dopplebock that isn't cloying, but I was expecting more in the way of malty flavors, especially from the people who produce Samichlaus. This has it's highs and lows, and overall is very decent. Worth a shot, but don't expect to be wowed."
"The body is fairly full with a crisp carbonation. Alcohol is subtle, but there. Overall, it is a decent doppelbock, but far from a favorite."
"The drinkability is only challenged by what the beer could be and not what it is. It is nice and enjoyable but has room to grow and refine. Prosit, MK"
"A nice Doppel, quite warming and soft. A nice find among the shelves at Surdyk's in Minneapolis."
