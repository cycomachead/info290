It has great flavors of bready, toasted malt, dried stone fruit, sweetness, nuttiness and slight sourness, which nicely stood up to 4 years of aging!  The only knock I have against this specific beer is the floating sediment/particulates.  Iâ€™m not sure if that is normal or an unfortunate side-effect of being aged for 4 years.","Jeffreysan","Jan 27, 2015"

3.68,0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/15/2013. Pours lightly hazy ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, golden raisin, caramel, toast, molasses, brown bread, floral, light chocolate, toasted earthiness, and yeast ester fruitiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and fruity ester notes. Taste of apple, pear, raisin, caramel, toast, chocolate, molasses, brown bread, floral, toasted earthiness, light nuttiness, and yeast ester fruitiness. Slightly tart fruitiness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, toast, molasses, chocolate, brown bread, floral, light nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity of dark malt and fruity esters; with a solid malt/fruity flavor balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice doppelbock. A little too fruity, but has good malt complexity; and is very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 02, 2013"

4.17,13.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"OVERALL: Prior to our trip to the Tommyknocker Brewpub last night my experience with them had been limited. The bar I work at served their Cocoa Porter (which I liked quite a bit) and the Amber Lager (which was fine, but nothing terribly special). I didnâ€™t really know what to expect when we sat down, but Sean, our bartender, was very friendly and informative. The flight he poured also impressed me. They did a lot of styles very well that I donâ€™t normally love (like the Maple Nut Brown and Imperial Brown) and they had some styles not seen as often in the American Craft seen (like a Rye Porter and the Doppelbock) that were done very well. It isnâ€™t easy to find a great Doppelbock in the U.S. and this was an impressively strong example. After sampling 14 different beers this was what we chose to bring home.","StoneTSR","Apr 01, 2012"

Single notes without much depth or complexity, even in the finish. Tastes a tad like cough syrup. What it comes down to is too much alcohol (8.2%) to really enjoy the bock flavors.

Sweet roasted caramel malt and dark fruit aromas, molasses and a bit of boozy. Smooth and creamy thick feel with light carbonation.

The brew pours a rich mahogany hue, and is capped with a moderate-lived off-white froth; not much lacing ensues. The nose is quite sweet and nutty, with some caramel and hazelnut overtones, a bit of dark-dried fruit character, and just a hint of herbal spiciness to temper the sweetness. The taste follows the aromatic cue, but offers a good deal more naked grain and fruity esters than the nose suggested. The feel is especially silky and creamy. This is a pretty nice example of the style; I still like it.","ktrillionaire","Jun 19, 2011"
4.05,10.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Different and interesting in the taste as well. That sickly sweetness translates to a creamy mouthfeel and dry, wine-like finish and feel. Clean though. The taste is sweet and juicy, like a mix of caramel and dried fruits. a small twinge of alcohol is present, but only after warming up. This is nice because the rich flavor of other doppelbocks I've had has sometimes been marred by a strong alcohol taste that takes over the whoel flavor profile. Not the case here however, and for that the flavor and body hold their own nicely. The mouthfeel makes this beer though, finishing the whole experience with a nice, satisfying bow. Good beer, glad it was available.","chodinheaven","Jun 14, 2011"

The nose is light and effervescent, with toasted oat and molasses aromas. Looks light bodied, but smells thick. The initial tastes are "heavy", and carry a tangy sweet caramel, a fig/dark fruit taste, and a slight smokey characteristic. The beer is light bodied enough to balance the heavy flavors, yet leaves a decent lacing on the glass. Tangy sweet aftertaste, with a shot of the dark fruit flavors towards the back of the tongue and mouth for a split second. The finish is sharp and tart.","GarthDanielson","May 03, 2011"

I was surprised that Tommyknocker put a bigger beer in their mixed six pack, brewery's usually don't whip out the big guns for their variety packs so that was pretty cool, they earn my respect for doing that and for $8.99 it was pretty good deal. I would buy a 6 pack of this beer for those cold spring nights and I would for sure get their mixed 6 pack again, it had good variety and was a good deal.

I can't smell much if any hoppy smells but it may be because of the malts overpowering them. Taste is very creamy, that's the first thought. It's got some caramel and chocolate malt upfront with a very subtle and quick hop finish. Overall the taste itself is pretty quick but good. Aftertaste is mild and earthy.

Flavor is super sweet with toffee and simple syrup tones a bit of harshness from the earthy herbal tobacco leaf tones I was commenting on. Nothing like a German doppelbock this one induces diabetes, the malts seem like they never fermented out all of the big time residual sugars going on and it still weighs in at 8.2% abv. Mouthfeel is super thin absolutely no body for such a big brew, this is a doppelbock light lager. Drinkability is okay but why buy this one you can have a Celebrator or a Salvator. Easy to consume well hidden alcohol semi enjoyable beer that I won't be seeking out any time soon.","WVbeergeek","Jul 11, 2010"

Overall this had pretty good flavor and body, but it wasn't as flavorful as it seemed to want to be.

Strange, I know, but that's what I'm getting. Luckily, I really enjoy sushi, sashimi, and all that accompanies it. Beyond that, that one is malty all the way through, but lacking in complexity. Lots of sweet caramel, finishing with molasses, a pinch of herbal, floral german hops and some light roasty character. Fairly clean, with minimal esters and off flavors. Some raisin and date fruitiness. Full, richly textured mouthfeel, with modest carbonation levels. An enjoyable glass of lager beer.","UnionMade","Jul 05, 2008"

It has midland body but pretty drinkable for this style. I do pick up on a subtle nutty quality. Carbonation is pretty mild. It finishes with some hop-like dryness but you don't lose that raisin/pear fruit presence. Caramel sweetness is there but is very lazy, in the background.

It was also a bit thick in the mouth, almost syrupy; but my tastebuds may have just been in shock.

Certainly not enough to appease my senses. The taste comes back to normal territory a bit, though: there's definite caramel, molasses, and sweet maltiness. The alcohol is hidden well enough, too, but there's a small amount of unpleasant acidity. The body is a bit thin, but the carbonation is workable.

The initial taste of the Butthead is highly sweet, with an element of toasted grains and/or a bit of alcohol. There is no perceived hop flavor or aroma. The bitterness is very low, with a full bodied sweetness shinning through. The carbonation is moderate with a surprisingly decent drinkability for such a full-bodied, malty treat. The sweetness is the definite message of the beer, but it is balanced enough, by more of the toastiness of the grains than hop bitterness to make it not overwhelming.

It doesn't completely compensate for the absence of any sort of aroma, but it's solid. A good balance of hops and malt with a bit of nuttiness and caramel thrown in. No detectable smoky/burnt roastedness observed. I have to agree with other reviewers that compared to most doppelbocks, it's flavor and mouthfeel are a bit thin. It does lack a certain robustness, and the consequent smoothness that the majority possess. If I didn't know better, I'd call it a strong ale, which may be good news to ale fans, but if you're looking for an above average doppelbock, you won't find it here.

Smells of raisins, vinous and caramel malts, sweetness, pine, and some scent that I can't quite pin down but am pretty sure it's not supposed to be there. The flavors are dark malts, a lot of sweetness, alcohol, and green/piney hops that have a surprising bitterness for a dopplebock. The body is thick and coats the mouth a bit more thick than I'd want.

Some toasty qualities, a hint of chocolate, a barely noticable alcohol burn, as well as that musty smell (which I think is a noble hop). Smells delicious. Taste is rich caramel with some chocolate and some toasted grains. Very sweet...too much so, IMO. A wood character comes in with a late alcohol. Can't decide if that wood is from hops or part of the alcohol. After the alcohol is a tinge of sour, like grapes (not cherries). The aftertaste is rich in chocolate and is very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is mild. It's a bit too heavy and sweet to be really drinkable, but I like it a great deal.","mentor","Jul 14, 2005"

Not off-putting, but it's there. My first dopplebock and not a bad brew. Mouthfeel is creamy, with medium carbonation. Alcohol becomes more apparent as it warms. It'll kick your butt after a couple, so enjoyable in moderation. I love coffee and chocolate flavors in beer, andI was surprised by that in this brew. Good offering from Tommyknocker.","Golden2wenty1","Jul 11, 2005"

Smell is brown sugary and malty, but doesn't stand out a lot. Taste has a lot of alcohol warming in it, which is accented by rich sweet malty flavors. Kind of one note, and lacking depth.

3.52,-3.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a light brown color with red on the sides. Head is minimal and lacing is moderate. I like the color though. Aroma is really nice with a caramel/toffee nut mix. Slightly sweet but a little alcohol sting is in there as well. Flavor begins with the traditional dopplebock taste of carmel and nuts and is nice and creamy and rich. But there's no chocolate or other malts in there to balance the strong caramel flavors or give complexity. A roasted bitterness is there but its weak. The finish leans toward acidic notes, which I didn't really care for, and is quite abrupt. This beer starts out good but loses steam the further I go. One and done, but decent nonetheless.","granger10","May 04, 2005"

Strong on the malt scent. No hiding what is here, malt and heavy. Deep robust roasty malt flavor, very smooth with almost no bitterness at all. Noticable alcohol presence.

The beer is not as sweet as the nose would suggest on the first taste, but with the second sip, the sweetness is there. It finishes almost smokey..not sure? I just can't figure this beer out, but the complexity is not adding to the experience. The beer is thick, but not too syrupy. Not a bad feel in my mouth, but not enough to save this one in my book.

The nose is subdued a gives small fruit hints over a malt base. The flavor is largely dominated by the alcohol which is quite prominent in this beer.

It had a nice malty aroma with hints of caramel and toffee and alcohol. It has a nice full-bodied taste but was a little syrupy. It has a strong toffee and roasted malt flavor with some spiciness and fruitiness to it and a little medicinal probably due to the alcohol.","Beaver13","Dec 04, 2003"
4.44,21.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A hazy (bottle conditioned) chestnut body is capped by a short head of light tan froth that dissipates almost immediately (probably due in part to its high alcohol content) and leaves no lace. The rich aroma displays a sugary, toasted malt with notes of brown sugar, caramel, toffee and even subtle cocoa. The body is medium-full and its very fine, moderate carbonation leaves itlightly creamy and smooth in the mouth. Some alcohol is clearly noticeable in the flavor but it doesn't really distract from the delicate yeasty fruitiness and rich malt that includes everything found in the nose plus a note of maple syrup. It well balanced, however, by a solid bitterness, and it finishes surprisingly dry for such a rich beer with just some lingering maple syrup and alcohol.","NeroFiddled","Nov 29, 2003"

The beer ends with a nice mild acidity, the hops pertinent to the style, droughty aftertaste and the big ABV, does warm the tummy a bit. A problem I find with this breweries whole line of beers is that the body seems a bit weak, and it distracts you from the their beers other qualities, maybe thatÂ’s why their brewpub folded in Phoenix.","Gusler","Nov 02, 2003"

The alcohol is evident in the aroma, though not listed on the bottle. Sweet malty taste up front, but not sickly sweet, followed by a nice roasted/smoked malt taste. By far the best american dopplebock i've had..this reminds me of Salvator a bit before they ruined the recipe. Nice breadiness in there. Alcohol is hidden fairly well but is evident in the warmth of my belly. Smooth, slick mouthfeel with a no so sticky for the style aftertaste. Dangerously drinkable. A great dopplebock, regardless of origin.","avylover","Oct 26, 2003"

Taste develops into more of a brown sugar, raisiny and chewy malt and dark rum finish. This beer definitely has a noticable kick to it from the alcohol. Quite the heavy hitter for a spring doppel.
