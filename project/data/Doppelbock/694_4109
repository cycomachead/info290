Nice head when poured from a tap.  Rich color.  Low bitterness at 25IBUs.","Jimlikesbeer","Saturday at 10:38 AM"

I was particularly bothered by the burnt malt flavor and booziness. The finish left a medicinally boozy aftertaste that reminded me of Jaegermeister. (which I do not like) I was looking forward to having this one because I love doppelbock. I will give it another chance, however, it does not look like it measures up to other german doppelbocks I've had.","Gajo74","Mar 04, 2015"

Mouthfeel is medium carbonation with a nice malt base that holds up on the tongue well without breaking down - Overall an impressive Doppel with just the right amount of flavor complexity combined with a nice ABV to warm the soul - will seek out again now that Troegs is available in the great state of CT","thespaceman","Feb 24, 2015"

Light nose of caramel malt with bread undertones coupled with a light alcohol note.  As it warms, dark fruit notes (fig, raisin, plum) are noted.  Full bodied with a rich creamy texture.  Normal carbonation with a nice effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is well balanced and complex.  It begins with a bready malt that flows into the dark fruit notes.  In the middle, caramel sweetness comes forward then yields to a mild hop bitterness.  The finish is where the alcohol becomes a bit unhidden as the other flavors fade.","tillmac62","Oct 02, 2014"

4.05,3.1,4,4,4,4,4.25,"tis the season now for this monster. one of the better bocks in the game i think, and truly a genre defining beer for many and rightfully so. this is big sticky brown with a tanned head on it that doesnt budge. its enormously viscous with notes of molasses and dark dried fruit being the dominant aromas. chocolate malt may be in there up front in the flavor, its dry before its sweet. but when it gets sweet it gets real sweet, maple and brown sugar and sticky bread pudding all come from rich darker german malts. the finish is long and just a little hot. a pint or a bottle of this is an interesting proposition. one has you stoked and feeling amazing. enough to make you want another. then it gets you buzzed and too mellow to know your full and well on the way to drunkenness. a third is night night for many, time to get weird for others, but if you are having a fourth in one session, you will inevitably exhibit your inebriation in an unflattering way. just the way it is with this seasonal staple.","StonedTrippin","Sep 27, 2014"

They are one of my favorite styles of lagers for their color and flavor and doppelbocks are very tasty. This one is no exception. I bought this around Christmas time (Yeah, yeah, I should have gotten some Mad Elf but I wasn't too familiar with Tröegs at the time). Altogether this a good beer for many different applications. It is a little bit high gravity to be a perfect session beer, but the flavor is both strong and not intrusive with plenty of the malt characteristic that I like and the hoppiness I expect from Tröegs, though not as much as in Nugget Nectar or something like that. Good for before, during, and after dinner and very good as the first alcoholic thing I drank after finishing my wisdom teeth pain medication.","MaddestHatter","Apr 28, 2014"

You only get that nice head if you serve it cool not Ice cold, the flavor and aroma also open up when it's about 45 degrees. It's malty and fruity and very drinkable for a beer with an ABV of 8.2... If you have tried it ice cold and didn't like it I would recommend that you let it warm a bit and try it again. It is my go to beer for now!","odatmatt","Mar 27, 2014"

The Crack! was loud and the inverted Glug required the practiced hand of the CAN Master to CANtrol from an overflow. I had an initial two fingers of foamy, light-tan head before it began to fall, leaving great lacing in its wake. Color was a deep-ruby or garnet (The ex-Old Lady and I also had that debate during my visit), (SRM = > 27, < 34), with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with dried, dark fruits like raisins, prunes, and dates along with a fresh-baked breadiness. I could envision fruitcake from when my maternal grandmother used to bake it. It had an earthy richness to it that likewise put me in mind of B&B Brown Bread, also in a CAN. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very much like brown bread with raisins! I like slicing off a piece, putting it in the microwave briefly, putting some butter on it and then eating it. The bread, I mean. The beer probably would not be as enjoyable coming out of the mike, but it was darn tasty coming out of both The Fridge and my fridge. I really did not notice the alcohol until the finish when I got a slight burning tickle in the back of my throat. The beer hides its ABV well, which CAN be a dangerous thing if you are not careful. The finish also left me tasting caramel along with the fruit and it just occurred to me - molasses. Wow! This is definitely a rich beer and on a cold day like today, it was just the ticket before hitting the hay.","woodychandler","Jan 07, 2014"

Generally I don't prefer a beer this sweet, but the malty profile is absolutely delicious, and it extremely smooth and drinkable for a brew of such high ABV. as I said, it may be on the sweet side for some, but it's definitely worth a try for fans of any style. Probably one of the most drinkable heavy beers, even for people who generally don't like something this strong. A fantastic beer overall.","aqualung23","Dec 24, 2013"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours dark mahogany with a vibrant ruby hue. A tan three fingers of creamy foam sits aloft this fantastic pour into a pilsner glass. Superb retention but no real lacing. This beer is very enticing. Nose is dark ripe fruits, a little chocolate and plenty of carmel malt. As it warms the nose opens up with raisin, cherry, the promise of a little spice and a faint breath of floral hops. On the palate the complexity builds. It’s creamy and sticky with fruits and a full malt presence that expands with some biscuit. The malt has depth and is resilient and forthcoming during the drink. It finishes sweet and off dry with a smacking of hops bitter to coat the mouth while the malt stays up sweet and crisp . It’s light enough to drink but it’s on the heavier side of medium body. This is a big hearted and velvety doopelbock . Rousing and fat. Again Troegs does not disappoint.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

The nose is all malt; sweet molasses and toasty-bready notes dominate, sweet alcohol lies just percievably above the radar. The flavor is also all malt and alcohol, I pick up some black licorice notes that I didn't notice in the nose. The mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. The finish is slick and the alcohol has a warming sensation. Overall, a well done dopplebock. Definitely a good one for a cold winter's night!","gmfessen","Jan 20, 2013"

3.95,0.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a gorgeous rubied brown with a lightly tanned head of medium sized bubbles which fades away quickly and leaves a thin drizzle of lacing. When you swirl this beer, it leaves nice light legs of alcohol on the sides of my mug. This is a pretty looking beer. The beer smells wet with caramel, bready malts, dark fruits, and brown sugar. There is even a slight tint of chocolate in the nose, and all around it reminds me of a Belgian quad with its malty complexity. There is a nice tinge of alcohol in the back of the smell as well to remind you of the beer’s ABV. The beer tastes much lighter than you would expect from the smell. There is some good brown sugar maltiness going on in this taste, which blossoms at the end of the swallow, but really is quite tame and clean in the initial sip. Dark fruits like plum and raisin are also present, and there is a lingering hint of dark chocolate in the mouth. The mouthfeel is incredibly drinkable and smooth on the tongue, leaving a nice skim of saliva and tingle of the carbonation on the tongue while leaving the entire mouth with a damp feeling. Overall, this is a very drinkable 8% beer, with some lovely sweet malts but not too much. I’ve never had doppelbock before, so I’m not quite sure how to rate this on its style, but I definitely enjoy it. This is a nice offering from Tröeg.","Maxwell","Aug 18, 2012"

Some spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of caramel, molasses, biscuit, raisin, plum, banana, light chocolate, herbal hops, and a touch of alcohol. Some pretty nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, biscuit, molasses, chocolate, raisin, banana, toffee, nuttiness, herbal hops, and light spiciness. Lingering notes of raisin, caramel, molasses, biscuit, chocolate, and herbal hops on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor complexity and balance. Nice maltiness that is not cloying at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy, chewy, and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming after the finish noticed. Quite smooth to drink, but is still a sipper. Overall this is a damn nice doppelbock. Nice flavor complexity and balance; and very enjoyable.","superspak","Apr 29, 2012"

3.96,0.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Troegs Troegenator pours a clear dark mahogany, with some gorgeous amber and cherry highlights. There's almost two fingers worth of khaki colored foam crowning the beer, and it displays pretty good head retention. Lacing is also very nice. The nose is very heavy on cherries, that dark fruitiness is what immediately jumps out of the glass. It's supported by a firm note of burnt brown sugar. The flavor develops a bit of caramel to go along with the cooked sugar. Despite that, cherries and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is superb, with a rich and full body. The carbonation tends towards the lower end of the spectrum, with just enough presence to keep the beer from becoming syrupy. Troegenator is a damn tasty beer, but it seems like it's got a lot of fruity flavors and not as much of the nutty, biscuity, and more malty flavors that I'd expect from a big German-style lager.","axeman9182","Apr 27, 2012"

It is clear now and there are bits of lace starting to cling as I sip this wonderful nectar. The aroma has a sweet caramel malt core with a banana fruitiness and firm toasted graininess. There are figs and dates as well with a touch of alcohol. Taste is rich, smooth, and malty. Sweet caramel and toffee in the front with a bouquet of dark fruits. Almost Belgian style banana note as well. This is a clean, lagered malt bomb however. Mocha and cocoa powder flowing into more pronounced roasted coffee and grains. Hops are firmly bitter with a crisp dry finish that is clean with just a hint of mint and herbal leafiness. More malt and bread flavors lightly linger. Feel is nicely weighted with a nice thickness that at the same time is highly drinkable and supple. A great overall version of the style and my favorite so far.

Because this is a pretty good beer when only focusing on drinking enjoyment, but not a good example of the style. The beer, rightfully for a double bock, leans toward malty sweetness but balanced enough to avoid being cloying- it's a drinkable beer. Bannana aroma detracted and not typical of the style- not a typical clean lager fermentation. Maltiness was rich but lacked melonodian depth that exemplifies the style. Being part of a mixed 12 pack won't deter me from purchase but I'm sure not buying a straight sixer. Disappointing considering the other brews Troegs puts out.","rdruckenmiller","Mar 29, 2012"

The flavor is one dimensional, purely sweet malt with a hint of brandy in the finish. The flavor is sweet to the point of being sickening, like the hops were forgotten. The mouthfeel is thick.

It's a delicious beer, and THE prime example of how a double bock should taste. It has a fairly high ABV as far as beers go, but you would never be able to guess it by drinking it alone, and that's the beauty of it. I'd more closely compare this to a fine wine than a beer, and it should be enjoyed like the thing of beauty it is.","undeadozzy","Feb 20, 2012"

The taste is a similar miasma, grain notes dancing with that banana ester going on, some faint spicy hops, and a little bit of alcohol on the back (it is 8.2%, after all).

As I'm typing this my dog dropped a wicked fart (must be the off-brand treats we got him), but I knew this wasn't part of the beer, but nonetheless through me for a loop and was a god awful smell. Taste is very sweet. I catch notes of dark fruits, mainly plums and raisins. The carbonation is light and the mouthful is thin. Not a very crisp finish. Overall this is an average beer (hint all 3's).

Well rounded, and a nice handling of a style that can be a bit monotone with its dark fruit notes. This is definitely dark fruit jams, and not a two tone date/fig bomb. The cardamom spice flavor gains complexity as it falls into a mellow woody flavor. An earthy dark fruit spread that I wouldn't mind having on rustic bread.

Since I normally favor milk stout - I was surprised how much I really liked this beer - but I really do just love dark beer in general and this one is awesome! I had this at the "Spotty Dog" in Hudson, NY and also took a growler full to a Zombie Walk in Albnay later that day. This beer was great straight form the tap, slightly chilled, in a pint and also fresh from the growler out of a red plastic party cup! This is a deep, dark, malty-roasted, slightly sweet brew with a very distinct flavor - pleasing and thick. I may try from a bottle, but tend to find beer usually tastes best from the keg.","Brouwerij78","May 28, 2011"
4.12,4.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Amber-red in colour. Pale taupe head is develops well, but falls short in retention and lacing. Nut and dried fruit aromatics, bready, a wine-like quality, even a hint of milk chocolate. Rich and malty in a way that makes allusions to liquid bread appropriate. Deeply concentrated raisin flavour. Honey. Finishes with an extremely light bitterness. Alcohol nearly imperceptible. Medium-bodied and lightly carbonated with a sticky, sugary mouthfeel. I have no idea what this beer is like fresh. I bought this bottle back in 2008, the same year I visited the NY state fair, and it has languished at the back of the beer closet since. With that said, this tastes really good now. It's not complex, but there is a great deal of depth and concentration in this with no real off flavours. This was a real pleasure to drink, and I'm glad I finally got around to pulling it out tonight.","mintjellie","May 26, 2011"

I found this beer to be very nice from start to finish. The pour was a deep mohagany brown color with a nice looking tan head. The retention was pretty good through out. The smell is sweet with dark malts and some fruits in there along with a touch of hops. The flavors of the beer are pretty intense. The first thing you get is the sweetness of the malts and perhaps some brown sugar. The second thing I get are the roasted malts with some hops tingling my tongue. The aftetaste is try with some subtle sweet flavors still lurking in there. The mouthfeel is very drinkable I think. It makes this brew a little dangerous because of it's high ABV. However, it's a really nice brew one of the best from Tröegs without a doubt.","Knapp85","May 16, 2011"

3.87,-1.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I miss having ready access to this stuff whenever the mood struck me to grab some. Oh well, that's what trading's for, right? It pours a clear dark garnet-russet topped by a relatively short-lived finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises caramel, figs, red grapes, toffee, butter, light cinnamon, and light rye bread. The taste seems to want to follow this directive, but a sharp nip of orange peel and astringent (though kinda light) coffee detract somewhat from the otherwise pleasant flavors. It's not enough to completely torpedo the proceedings, but enough to be negatively noticeable. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, lightly grainy feel. Overall, though a teensy bit thin and that touch bitterly unpleasant on the tongue, this is still a very solid d-bock. Generally good times.","TMoney2591","Apr 13, 2011"

Reminds me of another beer I can't quite place yet. Contains a hop bitterness and spiciness which is welcome along the warming alcohol flavor/sensation.

Smells sweet, sugary, with a fruity smell of raisins, dates, apricots, and prunes overpower the malty goodiness of this beer - on top of everything, alcohol is hot and not hidden well. Tastes like it smells. Only the mouthfeel is killed with a hot alcohol finish that burns the mouth on down the hatch - not smooth which also doesn't make it extremely drinkable since after 2, you're either overly-intoxicated or just can't stand another sip of this overly-sweet bock. Troegs, I still love you though. I'm going to save a pair of these until next year and see if some time smooths out the flavor.","Hellabeerguzzler","Feb 08, 2011"

Poured a nice deep reddish-bronze in the glass. Full-bodied, dry sweetness, with some bready flavor and a savory finish. The finish also had some unpleasant, lingering buttery/diacetyl things going on that severely cut down on the drinkability for me.

Mouthfeel is good for the style, but drinkability suffers from the noticeable alcohol flavor.

The smell is full of robust caramel and nice malts. It tastes like a very well brewed doppelbock should. It is big and strong, slightly bitter, and very robust. It feels big, strong and robust as well and is drinkable but not a beer you wan to have too many of. The Troegenator is a style I really like and a brew that I think is great.","dball","Oct 12, 2010"

Taste is, again, malty with a hint of bread and caramel. Throughout the drink, the head subsides more and more, with little-to-no lacing, as the mouthfeel begins to seem more and more light (and hot); a stark contrast to how it began. Moderate drinkability because of the high ABV (8%), but I would reckon that could be the main selling point of this beer (it was for me).","CourteManche","Aug 19, 2010"

The retention was so-so overall and left small spots of lacing. The aroma was a malty blend of raisins, caramel, toffee, alcohol, currants and hint of sourness. The flavors were similar minus the sour element and plus some wood, nuts and some light toasted malt. The raisins really came through in the middle and though it was surprisingly (dangerously!) drinkable for 8.2% the alcohol heat did really come through towards the end. As it warmed up I also picked up some semi-sweet chocolate. Rich and maltastic, this one really coated my tongue.

Faint rising bubbles of carbonation rise to the surface and collect around the inside perimeter of the glass and appear with a color that is slightly stained yellow. Aroma of this beer is pretty much dominated by the scent of malt leaning towards being a bit like dark caramel or a bit like molasses, only a faint trace of hops is present and the slightest touch of butter. Taste is malty sweet with flavors of caramel, slight molasses, and just a bit of buttery tones with a minor hop bitterness and nice alcohol warmth. Medium feel with a modest amount of carbonation and a increasing amount of alcohol character as the beer warms. Once Troegenator warms, it displays a greater depth of the malt profile with flavors that are at times a bit nutty. Overall pretty good.","stakem","May 29, 2010"

I'm finding a bunch of different things in here as it warms... thick malt backbone, loads of bread, burnt caramel, grapefruit rind, mulling spices, walnut, black cherry.

All of the flavor comes late in the taste. There's a pretty prominent herbal bitterness and the sweetness hints toward dark fruit and raisins.

Somethings seems to be missing for me, I think it could use a little more flavor, a little something extra. Maybe it is just staying true to the style, but I think it is pretty average overall for a premium micro brew. I would expect something like this from Sam Adams, I guess I was expecting more.

A nice medium body with a small carbonation enhances the flavors that come through, again the molasses, and actually a hint of melted butter, which, while off putting at first, grew on me.

This beer has a perfect amount of carbonation, it didn't tingle too much but nor was it non existent. The initial taste of the beer was somewhat sweet with an interesting dark fruit and malt flavor.

3.85,-2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep, reddish, chestnut brown with a respectable creamy head on top. A big hit of dark stone fruits hits me with my first whiff, but further sniffs reveal a bready malt sweetness that I'd expect from a doppelbock. The flavor is almost an inverse of the aroma, with a dry caramel malt sweetness first and the dark fruits creeping in underneath. Certainly not overly sweet, though, and a combination of spicy/earthy hops and alcohol follows to provide balance. The texture continues on a similar theme, with an undercurrent of sweet smoothness at the base, and a prickly combination of carbonation, hops, and booze riding on top. It does seem a bit boozier than I would have expected at 8.2%, but it's interesting, complex, and a welcome diversion on a cold, rainy winter night.","devilben02","Mar 02, 2010"

4.02,2.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a clear, deep amber color with a little more than a finger width of head. Doesn't stick around long and leaves very little evidence, however. Has a great malt nose with a mix of sweet notes like caramel and toffee and some roasted nutty/earth scents. Taste is delicious and a bit unique for the style. The ratio of hops to malt is fairly balanced with some earthy/spicy hops making an appearance in the palate. Has a full mouthfeel without feeling heavy or chewy. Consistent the whole way through. A fantastic offering from Troegs and a personal favorite of mine.","JunkYardJake","Feb 17, 2010"
4.02,2.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a dark reddish color with half inch of tan head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Hardly any lacing is left on the glass. Good aroma with a toffee malt element taking charge. Hints of nuts, probably almonds is also quite noticeable. Strong malt flavor as well. Toffee and almonds being the most noticeable elements. Not as sweet as other doppelbocks. Alcohol is completely hidden. The body is not as full and rich as I would like. Still maintains some substance and a nice soft carbonation. More drinkable than other doppelbocks because it is not as sweet. The alcohol being as hidden as it is could make this one sneak up on the drinker.","morimech","Feb 14, 2010"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Had a snow day in NY, so I decided this would be a nice one to have during a lazy movie marathon. Pours a dark colour with a red tint you can see in the light, with a big foamy tan head. Smells sweet and hearty, like stone fruits and nuts, especially almond. There's a strong, yeasty kick, too. The taste is equally pleasing: its got a big flavor, and whatever those fruits are (plums? raisins? Can't put my finger on it), you definitely taste them. The sweetness comes through but has a nice balance with the bitter, strong, hoppiness that you get towards the end. The mouth feel is thick, heavy, but smooth. It's substantial but easy to drink more than one of these. Thoroughly enjoyed this brew.","MyGoodness","Feb 10, 2010"

Some fruit flavors are mixed in nicely.

Caramel, nut, toffee, and a slight background of herbal hops characterize the aroma. Caramel and toffee hit first in the flavor, plenty of nut, slightly herbal hops in the background, and just a hint of alcohol warmth, though it does not taste like an 8.2% beer. Toward the fuller side of body with moderate carbonation. Not viscous like some dopplebocks, makes this one more refreshing and drinkable than expected. All around, one of the best dopplebocks I have ever had. Well-balanced, drinkable, pretty. No complaints here. Glad I can get this in Tyngsborro!","MrHurmateeowish","Feb 07, 2009"

Similar to Mad Elf with that one respect, except in the case of Mad Elf it endeared me to the beer. A little fruity, but the cherry notes just kind of slide into the background. Actually a little dry side to the finish that I wasn't anticipating. Mouthfeel is good, does well to keep things feeling fresh. Part of that medicinal quality comes back in a funky aftertaste at the end. Not bad per se, but I'm not warming up to it either. I tried not to let my expectations temper my review, but I think the fact that I was expecting something bigger leads me to a bit of disappointment. It's not a bad American representation for the style, it just could use some work. If it had less of a medicinal syrupiness and kick to it, that would help a great deal.","damienblack","Feb 03, 2009"

The only other Troegs beer I have tried in the past is Mad Elf last year. I'm only 23, and have never tried a dopplebock before. Anyway... Opened the beer from a six pack, hit with a nice soft scent from it, not what I was expecting. Poured into a standard glass a dark amber, when held up to the light, it reminded me of a port wine, and minimal lacing. One interesting note is that it left large bubbles in the bottle, something I've never seen before. Smell was of the malted barley up front, followed by a lingering scent of the hops and a bit of alcohol. Taste was just as the smell, sweet malt followed by slight bitter of hops and warmth of the alcohol down the back of the throat. It surprised me how easy it is to drink, everything is layered together, but in a great way. One does have to worry about the 8.2% alcohol level, it can sneak up on you. Excellent beer, wonderful for a nightcap or just a winter warmer.","MrPsychic","Jan 07, 2009"

The malt comes right out at the front along with a breadiness, that dominates the taste for almost the entire flavor. Then at the end a mild grassy bitterness comes through and lingers there for some time. There is hearty, chewiness in the feel, though still leaving that crisp finish you find in the lager.

Seems pretty thin for a dopplebock and overly "processed" for a beer. More like they mixed together Dopplebock syrup with water and carbonated it.

4.17,6.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4," Troegnator is a double bock, which is typically an amber German-style beer that is like a high octane Oktoberfest. Double bocks aren't usually flavor bombs, like a big porter or stout, but they are pleasantly balanced beers which make them amazingly easy to drink. This beer is rich and creamy with a strong caramel flavor but a light enough body to go down easy. The beer holds big amount of brown sugar and sweet raisin flavor with a solid floral German hop bite to counter the malt sweetness. Double bocks in general and Troegenator in particular are tricky. These are big beers, alcohol-wise, but it's hard to tell. Resist the urge to gulp and sip this one slowly. Troegenator is a year-round release and available at many better beer stores in Hampton Roads. Pick up a six-pack and watch the leaves fall as you taste a bona fide world class beer that we are lucky enough try.","manleyphoto","Feb 14, 2008"

On the other hand, it is a boozy beer, coming in at 8.2% alcohol by volume, which means that after a couple of these beers it may be quitting time. It's also, with its almost syrup-like body and long, thick coating mouthfeel, would be a beer that if it were warm would be a beer that would put a lot of people off, and one that a lot of people would pass on for a lighter, more refreshing beer.

Few bubbles inch their way to the top through the thick body. Aroma is pretty faint for a beer like this. I get some alcohol, dried fruit, toasted bread, and sheepish hops. Flavor is much stronger than the smell. Lots of dried fruit and big malt sweetness. Hops are shy but offer an herbal edge, and, along with the slightly medicinal alcohol, gives this something of an herbal liquer character. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky with calm bubbles.

Smell was very milky, with a bit of powdered chocolate in there as well. It also just had that sort of robust doppelbock smell that is difficult to explain. Taste had milk chocolate, caramel and toasted grains. It starts off sort of carbonated, then becomes very silky smooth. This might be a little light for this style, but the malt still makes this seem pretty big. This is my kind of doppelbock in that it is not too light and not too big, with lots of tasty flavors going on. I would get this again for sure if it were available in my area.

The 8.2% is well hidden, but the flavor lacks some of the depth found in its scent. Malty bready flavor that doesn't develop, but is nonetheless enjoyable. Lacks the sweeter flavor found in many other doppelbocks and focuses on a bread like taste. The mouthfeel is creamy, yet medium to light. It's a lighter take on doppelbocks, but still packs a wallop of alcohol that is well hidden. A very drinkable beer and an interesting take on a classic German style. Another solid offering from Troeg. Pairs well with a hearty German meal, but be careful you'll feel stuffed!","Jmamay22","Aug 03, 2007"

Some cloves and raw alcohol are in there as well. On the palate, this beer is rich and smooth with substantial bitterness, followed by some orange rind and slight alcohol burn. It reminds me quite a bit of Spaten Optimator, but with more of a bitter chocolate note. Mouthfeel is high gravity, with some raw alcohol and surprisingly robust carbonation, given the size of the head. Overall, this is a very decent doppelbock, with good drinkability and solid flavors. It doesn't compare to the best of the genre, but it's good enough for regular purchases.","geexploitation","Jul 18, 2007"

I actually prefered a local Dopplebock, which has scored much lower then this, to be much more appetizing. Maybe it was me it just did not impress at all. I would say it sessionable only because it was so light and the alcohol really did not show through. Will have to try some of the other in the category, to see how it holds up, or maybe I just got a bad batch. Will try one again if it comes my way to make sure.

Tasted very, very malty and a little bitter/too sweet (could not really tell the difference, that is how malty it was) and yet it was pleasant (maybe it was the alcohol quickly kicking in). Nice, pretty thick mouthfeel; good overall. I would say this is drinkable. I would not attempt to drink more than one of these in a row, or at least in quick succession. Definitely a slower paced beer, which is nice to have when you are just hanging out watching tv or something. Very. very filling.

The mouthfeel is creamy and not as heavy as one might expect, but the best flavors in this beer do not remain in the aftertaste, which quickly fades to a bitter dryness.

3.83,-2.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"12oz. bottle. Light copper in color, clear, modest light tan head. Aroma of grapefruit was first to make an appearance, but this faded as it warmed. Followed by caramel and molasses, cherries, bread, and a faint whiff of alcohol. Taste was sweet - dark fruits, cherries, almost vinous. Hops were quite mild, contributing a little bite at the end and some balance throughout. Body was medium, carbonation seemed fairly high for the ABV. Texture was slick, and the alcohol warming was noticeable very early on. A very good beer, which struck me as almost port like, but lighter in body and not as sweet. I also thought, given the other Troegs products I have tried, that the hops would be "bigger", but they stayed pretty true to style.","","Sep 26, 2006"

It poured the caramel amber colour of 100's of other doppelbocks with a big fluffly sand coloured head. Lots of sticky lacing. It looked nice. The smell was quite lovely, as well. Plenty of sweet roasted malts, some brown sugar, heavy maple presence. I was quite excited at this point. Taste had sweet malts and a bit of a dry finish, but quite honestly, it was very dull and empty. Lifeless and unexciting. Ho-hum. Mouthfeel was very thing for the style, I thought.

The color was not nearly as dark as I had expected given the style. It seemed more like an amber ale than a Doppelbock. Aromas of alcohol and grains dominated the scent. I really couldn't get much out of this and it was my first indication this beer wasn't what I had hoped it would be. The taste was understated, to say the least, with a very subdued malt presence. The beer was sweet overall, but it didn't taste as if different types of malt had been used, though I'm sure they did. Even as the beer warmed, I couldn't get much in the way of other flavors; fruits, earthy tones, etc. Every other flavor was so subtle, I could decipher what I was tasting in subsequent sips. The mouthfeel was just as average as the taste with not much intensity or texture. The beer felt rather thin in my mouth as if it had been watered down.

The aroma is rich with notes of cherries, carmalized malt, toasted bread, and fresh cooked biscuits. The cherry note is quite interesting, and though not strong adds a sort of fruity back drop to the aroma. Nice... this beer is thick and creamy from the beginning, as I take my first sip it just coats my mouth. There is a nice sweet full maltiness here that is characteristic of a doppelbock. The flavors that I can pick up remind me of caramel coated biscuits, honey, vanilla (though I think this is more a product of the creamy mouthfeel), and a hint of fruit notes; cherry and orange perhaps. There is a light bitterness in the finish that just barely tries to balance the rich maltiness that dominates this brew.

The aroma is dominated by malt with hints of raspberry, caramel, vanilla and oak. The taste is quite malty just like the smell and you get just the faintest hint of hopping in the background. The malt flavor is not overwhelming and is quite well rounded with a tart fruit flavor (raspberries or perhaps strawberries or even cherries) and a smooth vanilla flavor as well as a molasses sweetness that follows. The finish is slightly dry and bitter but that makes it all the more refreshing. I haven't had many dopplebocks but i enjoyed this one. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation, and it hides the alcohol fairly well. Not an "excellent" beer but pretty damn good, and it seems like it could be sessionable despite the high alcohol.","silver0rlead","May 15, 2005"

After drinkin it, I was reaching for another. However, make sure you are at home and not driving if you reach for another. The carbonation is real light and not much lace clinging to my glass.

Caramel, bready, vienna (or munich) malt, and a bit of baker's chocolate (which I certainly wasn't expecting). Has a piercing fine carbonation that adds a hint of sour/acid immediately after the swallow. Any hop bitterness is gentle, but I do get a bit of zing late that could come from hops. Tough to tell, as the zing could be the result of alcohol and carbonation combined. This beer contains some bock character mixed in with many other non-traditional bock characteristics.

Dark ruby with brown edges and a nice enough head of whipped coffee foam. Aromas are all about sweet roasted malts, chocolate malts, caramel malts, and MALTS. The taste follows suit, and as I find most Doppels, it is quite one dimensional, but still damn tasty and good. Where is the 8.2%? Mouthfeel is creamy and thick. Warming, chewy, and filling.

Pours a reddish brown (more red than brown) with an off-white 1 finger head that leaves little lacing. Scents are very sweet - caramel, butterscotch, chocolate, bubblegum, raisins/plums/figs, alcohol and perhaps a hint of roses. Hop spiciness is the first flavor to hit, but followed closely by thick, chewy malts with more bubblegum, chocolate, dark fruits, and alcohol. Citric hop flavors and hop bitterness eventually make themselves known. Has a nice warming feeling. Too thick and strong to make a good session beer but makes a wonderful after-dinner beer. I don't remember the other 5 beers from the six-pack smelling/tasting this complex - even though I don't have tasting notes from those I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the aging had a positive effect on this beer.","mmmbeer","Jan 28, 2005"

Taking the first sip, i got a bitter and smooth taste with less carbonation than expected. The carbonation that WAS there tickled the front of my tongue a bit and then the fruit dark malts came through in the flavor. It finished with a smooth almond flavor or roasted malts. Mouthfeel was pretty decent in that the carbonation was a little tickly at first w/ a SLIGHT alcohol burn at the swollow.

3.9,-0.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Dark amber color. Medium head. Aroma is roasted malts, caramel and dark fruits. A medium bodied dopplebock. Malts are rich, fruity and sweet. Touch of toffee, bread and molasses. Very smooth tasting. Hides the 8.2% alcohol very well. Perhaps a little thin? A nice dopplebock. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Jan 02, 2004"

4.08,3.8,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"This is one of my fav's when it comes to US brewed dopplebacks. It was a very nice dark color, almost motor oil, with a tan head. The head retention was very nice and lasted quite a little time. It then fell to a thick laceing. The taste was nice and fruity, more of the plum variety, plus had many different malts included. It resembled the belgian brews quite well. I would recommend this one for anyone that is looking for a solid US brew.","JISurfer","Dec 14, 2003"
4.2,6.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I said that dopplebock was my least favorite style, and I dislike most of the malt monsters, but this is so well-balanced, that I genuinely can enjoy this one. A great beer from a great PA brewery, and one I'll be looking for again.","beergeek279","Nov 24, 2003"
3.68,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Light amber color and head that quickly dissappears. Aroma is fruity alcohol and not much more. The fruit that comes to mind in the aroma is peach. Behind that fruit is a hint of malt. Flavor is sweet and then quickly leads to dry finish. The beer is very crisp. The alcohol is subdued which is surprising due to the amount of alcohol that is sensed in the aroma. It is a fairly drinkable beer despite an 8.2% ABV touted on the label.","GCBrewingCo","Oct 27, 2003"

4.32,9.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Appears a deep ruby with a caramel tan head very nice appearance lacing is sporatic and scattered but it's all good. Aromatics takeover deep over ripened plum tones drizzled in a milk chocolate sauce and a touch of floral hops lingering. Taste conists of waves of malt this is one malt monster very nice and it gets more and more appetising with every sip. Seems chalk full of caramel malts with some type of specialty thrown in to give it the chocolate finish very smooth and not overly sweet a great strong lager that's still a bit dangerous when it come to drinkability. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied but incredibly smooth at the same time no cloying textures one great easy sipper. This beer is great year round especially when your in the mood for a malty dbock with trace hops.","WVbeergeek","Sep 16, 2003"
3.4,-13.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"It is very rich and smooth till the last drop. Loads of dark malts welcome you into a well-made doppelbock. I think the fact that this beer was very heavy and I had it in 90 + sun at work may have hurt my experience a bit, but imagining what it would be like under more flattering conditions, I bet it would be great. Some coffee and chocolate flavor in the mix, it had a good deal of complexity. I will return to this one in the winter.","ElGuapo","Aug 25, 2003"

4.02,2.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"A rather respectable dopple with malt being cables that keeps this bridge afloat. Smelled of chocolaty sweet malts no noticeable hops in the nose but that goes along with the style. Beer was having a problem being poured and would foam over almost every time that is was poured so had just a slight carbonation with it finally settled so the initial pour had a huge head but when I was finally served it just had a little head on it. Taste is of sweet chocolaty malt no real alcohol flare and mouthful is thick and nourishing. Tastes to good to be this strong.","leeenglewood","Aug 03, 2003"

4.03,2.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured out a nice orange amber color with a big creamy head. Complex aroma of caramel fruits and malt. Not overwhelming though. There's some grassy hops in there, too. The taste is very nice - rich with complex flavors and malty sweet. Very drinkable and the beer has hidden the alcohol well. A very nice and flavorful Dopplebock.","pezoids","Jun 30, 2003"
3.76,-4.3,4,3,4,4,4,"Overall impression - Another solid brew from Troegs. A bit one dimensional perhaps, but extremely well crafted, well balanced and drinkable, and for me, drinkability in many Dopplebocks is sometimes lacking.","bmills1608","Jun 16, 2003"

There is a very slight hint of hops mixed in. The taste is sweet caramel & malt up front followed up by a wave of alcohol. There is no bitter after taste with this beer. Maybe a bit weak on the malt taste when you match it with other beer of this kind. With the 8.2% alcohol, it is very easy to drink. Overall a bit above average.","Stubbie1","May 25, 2003"
3.45,-12.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I was a little disappointed with this beer, it wasnt my idea of a true dopplebock. It pours a nice dark copper color with a small white head that fades away quickly. The aroma isnt as sweet as most dopplebocks that Ive had. Caramel, hops, and roasted malts are the most apparent scents. The taste is much like the aroma with a slight caramely sweetness detected upon the first taste, with mild chocolate undertones. There is, however, a dominating taste of alcohol noted during the entire drinking experience. The body is very thin and bitter. This is a decent beer from Tröegs but not the best that Ive had from them.","Scooter77","May 22, 2003"
3.35,-14.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I've enjoyed troegs brews in the past so when I saw this one I snatched it up in a hurry...unfortunately, it disappoints for those expecting a "dopplebock". Dark reddish amber with a smallish head and very little carbonation. It has decent malty scent but the taste is slightly sweet, fairly hoppy and watery for the style. It seems american breweries just can't compare when it comes to this style. On the plus side it's very easy to drink and the alcohol is nicely masked, but I find myself noticing grainy & hoppy american pale ale characteristics while drinking. Decent brew, but way off the mark for the style.","avylover","Apr 26, 2003"
3.8,-3.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Fairly light compared to other double bocks Ive had. By light I mean in color, texture, and flavor. Color is light brown with orangish notes. Head is off white and quickly fades. Flavor is predominately sweet malts but not as strong as offerings such as Paulaner's and SA's. Theres some mellow, and let me emphasize 'mellow' hop flavor in there. Alcohol is not noticeable. In fact I was surprised when I saw it was 8.2% when I looked it up to write a review...A good double bock if not somewhat out of the ordinary.","allboutbierge","Apr 20, 2003"

4.33,10.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A crystal-clear reddish-amber body lies beneath a creamy light tan head that both holds well and leaves nice lace throughout the glass. Some alcohol is noteable in the aroma, but it adds rather than detracts; mingling with a gently toasty maltiness and light floral hoppiness. It's medium/full body is enhanced by a very fine, median carbonation that gives it a touch of crispness on the tongue before releasing its gasses and becoming creamy-smooth. The flavor is quite bold with a rich, bready and toasty malt. It doesn't have the lightly chocolatey character that some doppelbocks have, but it does contain a mild fruitiness. Floral and spicy hops balance with both flavor and a gently restrained bitterness. Again, the alcohol is present but not overwhelming, and helps to dry the finish and leaves a touch of spiciness at the back of the mouth. An interesting take on the style with more fruitiness and floral hop flavor coming through than many darker & malt-laden versions exhibit. In fact, it's very much like and "XL" helles bock! Quite enjoyable; and probably too drinkable considering its strength! Well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Apr 03, 2003"
3.74,-4.8,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"This is an interesting offering in the world of American Double beers. It pours a facinating shade of reddish pinkish brown. The malt is pronounced, but not overpowering, and the finish is quite sweet. The alcohol is well hidden, which is interesting, considering it weighs in at 8.2%. All in all, a good lighter-style Double for the warmer summer months, though nothing outstanding. Reminds me oddly enough of a Spanish or French Rose wine.","queenboadicea","Apr 03, 2003"
4.3,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a medium copper color topped with a thin tan head. The head slowly fades to just a ring of foam. Strong caramel aromas are blended with hints of roasted malt and hops. The hops are noticeable immediately on the tongue, but then a myriad of flavors fall in behind it. On the first sip I get roasted malts, caramel, a bit of alcohol, touches of lemon and a bit of a black licorice note. A bit of a toasted butter note finishes out the first taste. The second sip is sweeter, with touches of dark molasses with a slight dark chocolate component. This is an impressively complex beer. The ABV is noticeable, but some time in the bottle may help diminish the alcohol esters. The mouthfeel is smooth, but not heavy as many dopples tend to be. This is a big beer that could be enjoyed easily on a warm spring day. It has decent hopping rates, a clean mouthfeel, and a great finish. An excellent beer from Troegs, a brewery I am gradually becoming more familiar with that continues to impress.","aaronh","Mar 19, 2003"
3.7,-5.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer is hefty. The malts are strong and filling. The nose is malty and the hops don't really shine through. The beer is all about malt. The head is quite thin and fades to almost nothing. The beer is quite red with some brown as well. The alcohol is quite present as you move to the middle of the brew. This beer is a meal in itself and is quite a treat to close out the winter season. Cheers.","Maestro","Mar 03, 2003"

Big malt taste with a nice balance of hops in the end. Slightly short mouthfeel, a little dry, with a tart, short finish of hops I can't put my finger on. Very drinkable as the alcohol is not easily detected. Nice beer from Troegs.","HopheadEd","Feb 15, 2003"
4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"First I’d like to say that every-time I drink this beer it gets better and better and new and exciting flavors seem to emerge. So I might have to re-review it from time to time. Now, this beer poured into the glass a crystal clear, lightly carbonated red/orange color. The head was thick and creamy, and the color was a beige color that had a orange hue to it. It was a long lasting head that never really disappeared and some remnants were still there at the last sip, and the lace was much like the head, it was sticky and it stretched to almost the bottom. The aroma was fairly simple at this time, the first thing that hit me in the face was oranges, fresh oranges, then a slight wave of floral and citrus hops bit at my nose, some creamy chocolate malt seemed to also be present (I noticed it before, but it is very slight), but mostly I smelled oranges. The taste was more complex then I would have thought. I tasted fruit (oranges) some light citrus hops (which made it slightly bitter), a light creamy milk chocolate, malt in the middle, kind of made my mouth feel watery, and hints of alcohol were also present in the late middle and at the end. The last taste to come to me at the end were citrus hops, but it was well blended. This beer was creamy in texture and very satisfying, a good beer to always have somewhere either on tap or six pack. Also a very sneaky beer. You feel fine and great while sitting and having 2 or 3 but watch out when you get up, because you will have the “jimmy legs”.","Jarod","Feb 13, 2003"
