"Great balance of dark malts and hops, and a nice THICK frothy head, with great retention."

"Yeah, I liked this, but not nearly as much as I thought I would. Somewhat watery for a dopplebock I thought. Nice earthy and hoppy flavor up in the middle however. No real hint of the alcohol and not a whole lot of nose. This came recommended from the bartender, but I just wasn't that impressed. Had some nutty and woodlike notes, but overall, just not a lot of flavor. Nothing else really bad about it, the taste that was there was good."

"O-Smooth Hoperator is a very unique brew. A hoppy Doppelbock is a neat idea. Decently entertaining label as well."

"O- Looks fantastic, mouthfeel is pretty great as well. Smell Falls a bit short, and I could use a bigger hop presence, but it's pretty darn tasty."
""
""
""
""
""

"Well executed Doppelbock with an American hoppy touch, nevertheless malt still predominates here, as it should."

"O - Not bad for a hoppy doppelbock, has some decent hop character, but its still over-powered by malt. It could use a bit more balance. The name is the best part of the beer."
""
"Overall heck its worth a try but for me that's all it will be. It is not bad per say just don't think everything needs to be hopped it is just wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Had no idea what the style was and was expecting a big hop bomb. This was a really nice complex and malty beer. This one was definitely a sipper, but I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can see why this one is so highly rated. Cheers!"
"This is has a nice hoppy flavor which is odd for a double bock. I enjoyed this one alot. It is vey smooth. Usuallly I find double bocks tough on the palate. But not this one. It has the carmel taste along with the hops. I know its been around for years, but this is the first time I saw it on tap in my area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Interesting fusion (a hoppy doppelbock) but I am not sold on this one. I was excited after the pour, then lost some interest during the aroma phase, and it was all downhill from there, unfortunately."
""
""
" For my taste, this is a Dopplebock that is unsure of it's own identity: the yeasty kick seems more trapist inspired rather than what one would typically imagine from a quality German Dopplebock (such as Ayinger). While worth a try for those that appreciate Belgian yeastiness, this is one of those beers that makes me appreciate splitting six packs with friends so I don't have to look at 5 more bottles for the next year."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The aroma is such a tease considering the rest of the beer's characteristics are closer to mediocre. By the way, they totally missed the chance to call this Hoppelbock. That would be a better name since the hops in this are anything but smooth."
""
""
""
""
""

"Grabbed this one blind expecting an IPA, didn't quite realize that the slick-ass dude on the cover was actually a dude-goat. Smooth Hoperator pours an amber-brown color with three fingers of very well retaining head. The aroma is very rich with caramel malts, but there's plenty of citrus and pine hops hanging out on the nose too. The taste is excellent, the malts rule the show at first, with some caramel and toasted malts up front, but the finish belongs to the citrus and pine hops. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side for a dopplebock, and the light carbonation is spot-on. Overall, Smooth Hoperator is a robust beer that should appeal to fans of maltier IPAs and dopplebocks alike."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy copper with huge cream colored head; settles slowly into a meringue-like cap with thick clumps of lace on the glass. Smell: floral with spicy, grassy, and sweet citrus notes. Sweet, slightly grainy. Taste: quite sweet... caramel, sweet apple, earthy, nectarine, herbal with a little orange citrus. Hoppy finish, but oddly drying and tannic. Miss, but if I was going to drink a ton of doppelbocks, I might throw one of these in from time to time for something different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A different interpretation of a traditional style that didn't completely win me over."
""
""
"Overall â€“ Quite nice. The beer has a great flavor profile, nice flavor transitions as well a good feel for the style . While not what I would consider a doppelbock, it is a god blend of doppel and IPA. Its very drinkable, flavorful, and very tasty."
""
"There is a spice and a tang in the finish, which is smooth and creamy. This is an interesting and tasty beer."
"This one had a nice amber color body with a 2' white head that hangs around for a bit and turns into a thin lace and stickyness along the top of the glass. The smell is of rich, sweet malt. The taste is kinda sweet up front then a little more bitter on the back of tongue. It has a little hop presence not to much though. The mouth feel is really nice, rolls off the tonuge really good and overall this is a good Doppelbock, specially after it warms up a little bit then the flavors really start to come out."
""
"Overall: not sure if doppelbock is the right style for this one. I dont have much to say about this one other than where are the hops in the smooth HOPerator?"
"D - Drinkable enough, but I'm not that into it. The malt character is ok, but uninspiring and the beer just seems to be missing something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked this beer it was quite good. Drinks smooth and sweet. Feels a bit thin and washed out too, but worthy of many more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very interesting hybrid style - doppelbock and IPA - which I really enjoyed the addition of the hops. I found this to be enjoyable and easy to drink. A little too heavy to be sessionable in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Reddish amber and cloudy in body with foamy white head that stays. Smells malty, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon skins, wet grass, and pine. Tastes of cinnamon, breadiness, nutty, light caramel, subtle grass, grapefruit, nice spices. The flavors are subtler than I was expecting and thats a good thing. Thick in body with light carbonation. Smooth and flavorful and filling."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's not a doppelbock. It's still tasty and drinkable. I'd rate it higher if I wasn't rating against the style. Either way, I enjoyed it."
""
""
"Overall, a very interesting beer. Not as much malt complexity shines through as with a typical doppelbock, but the hops keep flavors intriguing. Definitely hop heavy."
""
""
"O - it sure lives up to its name. velvety smooth and very well hopped a very nice example of an Americanized doppelbock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - True to the name, this beer is extremely smooth. It is definitely hoppy but is also balanced out with some sweet malts and spicy notes."
"A sharp resiny twang runs through the palate of this one, definitely a bit of earth in the hops as well. A thick caramel malt lends more feel than flavor, but there is a faint sweetness from caramel and toffee. The resiny taste has a tobacco quality that is strong, taking over the balance of this beer to the point where its close to overbearing. Not bad in reality, but it does seem to overpower other flavors that are a bit more subtle. Definitely a generous use of the hops, but a lack of really great balance affects my view on this one. Worth a try though."
""
""
""
""
"To me the mouthfeel is the best part. I dig the smooth texture of this one and the slight carbonation. There is a subtle hop pinch finally here that could have been around in the scent and taste but then that wouldn't be true to style. All in all a tasty beverage but not much more then average. Easy to drink but not very exciting."
"Overall: a $14 six pack is a bit pricey for me but the pack I did get was great."
""
""
""

""
""
"The score is entirely dependent on how you view the beer. Rated as an IPA or similar, this scores in the 4.0+ range, as a doppelbock it's pretty poor. As a marriage it is also poor. Thus I am torn here..."
"Final impression: A lot of the negatives in my review of this come from personal preference, I did not like an overly hoppy Doppelbock, but there is nothing wrong with the beer of a technical standpoint. I will finish the sixer, but next time I will go back to Stoudts DiPA, or the Fat Dog."
""
""
"Taste-Sweet toasted malt, nice hop prescence, well-balanced and very smooth. Tastes like a malt-forward IPA. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability/overall- this has to be the single worst interpretation of a dopplebock i have ever had with out any doubt, just saw off in the style its laughable, beyond that what every style you want to call its just plan out boring and simple, you can drink it but found myself truly not wanting to"
""
""
""
"O: This is not the first beer I would point to if someone were to ask me what a Doppelbock tastes like, but it's definitely one I would point to if they were to ask me what a good one is. Curious, different, and one of the best bottom-fermented beers I've had (though, coming from someone who loves ales, take that with a grain of salt...)"
""
""
""
"D: [DRINKABILITY] I don't know how closely Smooth Hoperator resembles a proper doppelbock but, disregarding styles altogether, this is BY FAR the best I've ever had."
""
"To be fair, this is a bit strong in the alcohol department. Amazingly, I couldn't taste it at all and it was only after I downed the whole bottle that the booze snuck up on me. There's a good tang to this like in a slightly spicy wing sauce and just like that, the flavor of this kept me coming back for me. As cheesy as the name of this beer may be, this certainly lived up to its name and hopheads should certainly seek this out!"
""
""
""
"Almost Red Ale-like in its hoppiness, this will probably be a beer that I reach for time and time again... A good smooth easy drinking effort from Stoudts here... I liked this one..."
""
"Despite my overall score, I'm actually stuck somewhere between a ""B" and ""B+""."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty amber color with a 1 inch head. Smell is alive with malts, hops, a touch of caramel, some sweetness. Taste is malty up front, somewhat sweet, the malts kicking in at the finish, a touch of citrus. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality and enjoyable beer."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation, this beer is very consumable. The body is a little light for the style and seems a bit thin. The carbonation is unexpected from the appearance but packs a good fizz."
"The chalkboard called this simply: ""Doppelbock," but presumably it was the Smooth Hoperator. Really seemed like an IPA in disguise. Poured a light amber with red-orange tints, and a small white head that left decent lacing. Surprisingly IPA-ish in the aroma, with a burst of pine hops with a sweet caramel malt base. If it was a blind taste test, I would've though this was an IPA upon tasting it (if it got past the aroma). Piney hops, citrus zest, apple peel, and some smooth malts to take the edge off, but not quite reach a balance on the palate. Smooth and medium-bodied, and quite drinkable."
"Overall: Very unique flavor profile not the best tasting beer I have ever had but I am glad I tried it but I won't drink it again"
"D - Very drinkable. The addition of the hops on top of the doppelbock style is really interesting and different. The balance is also really nice here."
"the CPJ"
"Overall I didn't mind this but this is one strange doppelbock, but it's very easy drinking for the high abv I must say."
"PROST!!!"
"Big thanks goes out to a74gent for sending me this one as an extra in a recent trade after seeing it on my Wants! Served from bottle into a Grolsch Pilsner. Poured a deep red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, oranges, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, citrus, citrus hop, and grapefruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew! A Doppelbock!? Holy Christ... I was thinking this was an IIPA until I read the style on here. Very easy drinking despite the 7% ABV. I could see myself getting in trouble with this one with large quantities. Very nicely balanced flavor and good aroma going on here. Definitely up there when it comes to favorites of this particular style."
"O- An excellent brew, but I expect nothing less from Stoudts. I shoulda picked up more than one bottle of this. I'll have to grab a few more and put one aside to see what it's like down the road as well."
"Smooth like the name suggests, and not bitter like I was expecting."
"For completeness, it is just as good out of the bottle. Prost!"
"Overall: Quite a nice doppel...."
" Overall a very nice brew, hope to be able to partake of this one again!"
"D - Very easy to drink, for sure!"
"Fairly drinkable, while it has a hoppy smell, there's not much hop to the taste. Still, a nice tasting beer I'd gladly have again."
"D: Solid level of drinkability, and this is where I think this shines. Could definitely enjoy several of these session style without getting tired of the flavor. A big six pack recommendation, smooth, hoppy with a dry toasted malting all coming together in a very drinkable package. Tasty and toasty warm quality, though i think this drinks closer to a american amber then a dopplebock."
"D - I finally got to try Smooth Hoperator and I was rewarded...a great experiment from Stoudt's and I see why they made this a seasonal...nice hop presence for the hop heads with just enough malt to please other beer drinkers"
"If I didn't read it here, I would not have identified the style. I'm not sure what I would call it - experimental? I guess if they are calling it a doppelbock it must be bottom fermented. It's pretty light colored. But the combo of yeast, loads of hops, etc. isn't really working for me. I will not buy this again, but it is something everyone should try. Once."
"it feels like a dopplebock when you drink this. but it sure as every doesn't have the normal dark malty tastes to it. Very nice balance though of roastness and hopness."
"If DFH Aprihop and Boulder Beer Cold Hop had a baby, it would be Stoudts Smooth Hoperator. I don't know what to make of this one. Doppelbock purists may not appreciate this one, simply bc it's not true to style.. but it's a tasty beer, recommended."
"Sure, this may be an unconventional dopplebock what with the hops & all, but it's really darn tasty. I got a kick out of how the flavor profile progressed as the beer warmed, shifting toward maltiness. Totally off my radar, now totally recommended."
"overall - very surprised by this beer. I'd pick up a 6pack if we had Stoudts around here."
"D - Scarily drinkable. If you want more hops in a dopplebock, this is your beer. I would defnitely buy this again."
"I've been waiting to sample this beer for a LONG time, and I must say, it lived up to my expectations. I'm more of a hoppy ale type of guy...as apposed a thick malty lager type of guy, so this twist on the style works in my favor. Stoudts is an underrated brewery in my opinion. This is one of their best. One of the more creative beers that I've had in a while."
"It is totally out of style though due to excessive hoppiness. It will loose points for that but it still a good beer that I would have again."
"I'm not really sure what to make of this offering...an insanely hoppy Doppelbock? Points deducted for such a deviation from the style, but good flavors nonetheless. Very unique."
"Drinkability - ML might not like this dopplebock because it's a bit hoppy for the style.. But I sure appreciated it"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head above the clear coppery brown brew. Head recedes slowly, with coating lacing. Aroma is thick earthy pine. Taste begins with a peek of sweetness, which quickly gives way to the pine bitterness, which dominates the experience. Citrus makes a guest appearance, but pine is the game here. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy once the hops wear your resistance down a bit. Nice offering."
"Hard to rate this one. If rating by category, it kinda misses the mark. This is heavier in the IPA range. But structurally, it is doppelbock. A tasty brew that is what it's creators intended it to be: a hybrid. Worth the try, but I don't think I could drink more than 2 at a time."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink and tastes like a hybrid of a dopplebock and an IPA."
"Drinkability: A distinctively American take on the doppelbock style and well worth seeking out"
"Again, strays from the style for a bock of any kind, but very enjoyable. Hoppy with support from malt that doesn't get sickeningly sweet like some hoppy ales. Very mellow & surprisingly drinkable."
"Dark brown in color. Great malty aroma. A little low on carbonation but overall a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Clocking in at 7% ABV, this beer still remains dangerously sessionable, if you don't mind getting a solid buzz after three or four. I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more Doppelbock character to it. Though its a lager, it tastes more like an IPA."
"eh~ goes down ok. semi-complex flavors meld with the alcohol well. but the flavors just don't mesh too well. kind of an odd pairing that misses its mark just a bit for me."
"F: Some bitterness but seems to ebb a little. Lingering hop resins though, with that musty taste not going away, and a little astringent. The sweet sticky flavor is also present on the finish but the dark wheat flavors seem to fade and this turns more to a DIPA than what it really is."
"D - Well since this is a limited release I may have to grab up one more before it's gone. I couldn't see a best to drink by anything on the bottle itself but the label really is a cool one. Glad the goodl beer matched the awesome label."
"Had I waited till 3/24/10 to crack this I am pretty sure it would have been just as tasty of a beer."
"Poured a clean amber, nice head, overall very inviting. The smell and mouthfeel were dominated by caramel malts, that finished throughout the beer. This is a strong malty beer, so if your into those, this is one of the better ones. Big fan, thanks to one of my east coast traders for this."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Poured a clear deep amber color with a small off-white head that slowly goes into a film with very good lacing. Hops dominate the aroma with a hint of malts. Hops hit you right away with pine and citrus and again in the bitter finish, in between you get a sweet caramel and biscuty flavor. This brew surprised me, was hopful for a good dopplebock, which I like, and got a mouth full of hops."
"Poured a deep copper color with excellent clarity. Small head with a little lacing. Strong nose from fresh german hops backed by a bready malt aroma. Has a sweet taste of caramel and honey with a suprisingly milder than expected hop flavor. Finishes quite bitter for a dopplebock though. Mouthfeel is a little slick for style. Not a bad beer but not what I like in a dopplebock."
"I wanted to give this a 4.5 in taste, based on my own preferences, but docked it that .5 in an effort to score ""to style."" Pretty hoppy compared to other dopplebocks I've had, not as much of a malt presence, but it should be made clear, I love this beer."
"Drinkability - not bad for a beer with the body of a double bock. Still, rather tough to go through more than a couple of these."
"Drinkability: Very easy sipper for a dopplebock. An interesting beer by Stoudt's that is worthy of another purchase in the future."
"Drinkability: I thought this was a Pale, and certainly not a Doppelbock. So does that take points off? I'm not sure, but I don't think so. Certainly the hoppiest version of the style I've had, but I like the risk and the differences pay off her."
"Nice carbonation and feels light bodied for a doppelbock."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. The bock appears a hazed amber chestnut color with about two fingers of creamy light ecru foam. Nose and flavors consist of mild pine and brown sugar, toasted bread, crackers, caramel malt, grassy, toffee. Maybe a notch or two better than medium bodied with ample carbonation for the style. Worth checking out. A bit different than your ordinary doppelbocks."
"D: This is a nice dopplebock. I didn't even know that it was a dopplebock at first. ABV isn't detectable, well blended, and easy to sit with for a bit."
"Drinkability: Meh, average at best"
"D - Very easy to drink, for sure!"
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Almost clear red/amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Light piney nose. Flavor is a hoppy burnt sugar with some lingering aftertaste. Unusual dopplebock. $2.25 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Drinkability is good, probably better than a classic dopplebock. It is lighter and crisper than some. Very tasty and worthy of more than one 12 oz bottle."
"A true hybrid, at least from what my own tongue says. Not sure how the brewer actually describes/classifies this. All I know is it gets an A+ for originality, although it's just a step or two away from blowing my mind. It's complex, bordering on confusing, but it avoids being a mess. Kudos to Stoudt's for the ingenuity that went into this one."
"Drinkability: The brewery points out that this is an American style doppelbock which means the malts are what you'd expect, but that American hops have been used instead of the noble hops found in most doppelbocks. I personally find this very interesting and drinkable and a nice variation on the classic style. I could easily have another (and another after that). I will definitely return to this beer, if only because I like it regardless of whether it fits ""to style"" or not. It actually seems to me to be the doppelbock that would be brewed in Europe if originators of the style had had American hops rather than noble hops to work with."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and a bit thin with good carbonation."
"Easy drinker."
"Pours a dirty orange brown color with a large orange/brown head. Big booming aromatic hops in the nose, lots of pine and bitter fruit. A very balanced beer, i was actually unaware of the style before searching to review, doppelbock? really? I could have swore DIPA to be honest. Either way, lots of rich caramel malts play nicely with the absurd amount of fresh, peppery hops dumped into this thing. Very nice indeed, wish they distributed this one? Do they distribute this one? This beer should be called enigma."
"This might be more of an APA to me. I've had this on tap and from a bottle. This is an awesome beer."
"PS. I did get a slight burning sensation on my tounge from this, its lasted about 12 hrs so far. Havent figured that out yet."
"Drinkability: A good beer, but not overly complex. A satisfying malty and hoppy beverage worth consuming in mass quantities. Salud."
"Its great to see Stoudts down here in NC.Poured a lighter bronze color with a tight one finger white head that great lasting power sticking like glue to the glass as it settled very slowly.Wow what a hop presence for a doppelbock!Very citric in the nose mixed with some caramel sweetness and some toasted malt.A little prickly in the mouth but not to annoying.A hefty dose of citric hop flavors with some tropical fruit-likeness as well,toasty in the finish with a light sourness as well.Hmm interesting to say the least,being a hophead I love the hop profile albeit it seems outta place a little."
"Meh. The ABV's a bit high, and taste-wise, this isn't for me."
"Drinkability: Most drinkable doppelbock I've enjoyed. An IPA lovers doppelbock. Very tasty - I highly recommend."
"This was a very pleasant surprise. One of the best beers from a brewery that has been on my radar for quite a while."
"I could drink a bit of this, it is delicious."
"Kind of funny I picked this beer to be my random six pack for the weekend, considering I strongly dislike bock's and doppelbocks, I looked it up on here and thought 'oh well looks like this one will be going to my dad after I try one'. Turns it it tastes like a delicious Double IPA! I don't see how this is in the bock category at all.. definitely a huge hop presence, maybe a bit more maltier than the average IPA/DIPA out there but this one is a nice bitter brew that goes down easy. Just disregard the style... it tastes like a DIPA."
"Drinkability is where I'll let the beer have it. ""Smooth Hoperator"" is a stupid name for this beer. If there's a pun worth associating with this beer, it should involve ""malt"" instead of ""hop."" It's not tough to drink, but it ain't smooth either. This might be my first Stoudts review and I know fans abound, but I've yet to encounter something worth remembering."
"Excellent brew! Its not hot, its well balanced and is very nice to look at, alot of deep rich colors."
"Hmm. I'm not sure how to rate this one. On one hand, it's too hoppy to be a doppelbock. On another hand, it's good, I like it. Wow. Tough choice. It drinks very well but I just can't rate it as a doppelbock. I blame it on the Celebrator and other doppelbocks I've had. Perhaps it's a classification mistake? Hmm."
"D: I've never had a doppelbock like this one. I'm almost wondering if it was the bottle that was off? Either way, toning down the dried fruit just a notch would definitely make me like this one a bit more."
"single from Grape & Gourmet, Virginia Beach, VA"
"Extra in a trade from Treyrab. Thanks for the chance to try this. Pours as a nice burnished copper with a fairly light head and some scant lacing. Smells very malty and buttery with some noticeable diacetyl. Finishes somewhat nutty and with a bit of soy aroma. The taste is malty and firm, and thankfully the soy and diacetyl have disappeared. Very dry, and with a light taste of baked apples on the finish. The mouthfeel is bready and smooth, and overall this drinks pretty well. Not bad, but not my first choicee for a Doppelbock."
"The appearance is a light-medium amber tone with a one finger head that does not sit there for too long. The smell is not as strong as some other doppelbocks i have tried, smells of fruit and some hops. The taste is richer though, a taste that would nicely compliment a burger and fries. MF is hoppy, spicy, with an aftertaste that yearns for some water."
"Stoudts continues on it's streak in my book with solid brew after solid brew."
"D - This is a very tough beer to judge... On one hand, it's a brilliant beer... On the other hand, I find this to be a poor representation of the Doppelbock style... Looks like a Doppelbock, but smells, tastes, and feels more like an American IPA... It's really an American IPA stuck in a Doppelbocks body... But at the end of the day, it's hard not to truly relish in this brewing craftsmanship..."
"The texture, as the name may suggest, is quite smooth. Body is probably a little heavier than medium, with appropriate carbonation. I really like this one."
"Dr. Very, very easy to drink. Gone before you know it or want it to be."
"Notes: Strange beer and a strange taste. Really all I can say is it is worth the try and not much else because this is really a weird beer. I can not say I liked it so I will not,yet it did intrigue me."
"D: Very drinkable. It's one of those drinks that you have finished before you realize it. If this brew was easily available, I would drink it often. Nicely done Stoudts!"
"Overall, a bit of a disappointment. It isn't nearly as good as Stoudt's other offerings, and it is quite a ways off base for the style. I won't be buying another one..."
"D: In my opinion, this is beer with mixed results. It has its solid attributes, but it comes down to the taste, and that's just not that interesting."
"12oz bottle @ The Headkeeper: This one poured a fairly clear copper color. There was a small white head on it that left some lacing. The aroma was good. Lots of hops up front with this one, mainly with pine and some floral notes. A fair amount of caramel malt also. The taste was also very good. There were enough hops to make you think IPA, but a lot of malt and dark fruits that you get in a doppelbock. Definitely worth having again."
"Overall: absolutely fantastic tasting beer and what a great marriage of hops and malt. Could easily envision drinking this all night but the 7% ABV may tell me otherwise."
"Pretty good mouth feel but way too sweet for my likings."
"12 oz bottle served in a regular pint glass. The beer pours an amber color with a 1 finger head. There is great lacing with this beer as well as head retention. I could not get much out of the aroma with this one. I could only pick up hops and malt. Perhaps this is due to the glass that I used. The taste is predominately hop oriented. The first sip there is a pinch of malts and then it is all hops. The carbonation is fine and the beer goes down very smooth. This is an interesting take on the style and one that might improve with a little more balance."
"Try some, it's a cross between a bock and and IPA."
"Picked up one bottle of this at Bruisin' Ales thinking it was an IPA, oh well, I certainly do like Doppelbocks as well, and if its as hoppy as Sierra Nevada's DeBockle, I'll be happy. 12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip a crisp dark copper with a decent eggshell head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves great lacing. Aroma is a nice balance of crisp sweet malt and Earthy hops. The taste is certainly loads of hops in nice balance with crisp malts still possessing that expected Bock bite. The beer is medium bodied with crisp carbonation and fairly well hidden alcohol. This is certainly one of the more interesting Doppelbocks I've ever had."
"The drink is medium in body with fine carbonation and is really pretty darned quaffable. As the encounter comes to an end, I glance back at the super-cool label-goat. He's still pointing, but now I get it... no need to ask... the Smooth Hoperator wants YOU to drink his brew!"
"Definitely not a beer for purist doppelbock fans. But much more to my personal liking. IPBock?"
"Extremely easy to drink, no sense of alcohol content, pretty damn good, but why waste that wonderful name on anything but an IPA?"
"D - A pleasant beer that you could easily have more than one as it's not heavy and lack an alcohol after taste despite it's 7.0% ABV."
"M - Slightly thinner than medium bodied."
"HopHead or not... Try it you will like it!"
"Overall, this definitely was a very hoppy doppelbock. To me, the doppel characteristics took a back seat to the big hoppy flavor of this beer. Worth trying."
"Pours out a clear, deep amber color with a massive off-white head. There's a bit of lacing and very good retention. Wish it were just a bit darker, but otherwise very nice. The smell is mainly noble hops, maybe just a bit of American in there, or maybe I'm just thinking of the American approach when I smell it. Something new, but not what I hope for in a doppelbock. Not even a whiff of dark, sweet, chewy malts. The taste is about the same. A sharp, spicy, minty hoppiness. Not a lot of bitterness, maybe it was sucked up by the malt, but I can't really taste it either. With some effort, I can taste a bit of caramel sweetness, no chewy, bready maltiness. I like the feeling of the noble hops, but a doppelbock, there's no doppelbock feeling here. This is more like an Alt, and a strong one at that. It still drinks kind of smoothly, with almost no notice of the 7% ABV. It doesn't hit the doppelbock spot, but I enjoyed it. Don't expect anything and you'll probably enjoy it. Really a cool and interesting idea, and I'd reccmmend it for those interested."
"Even a nice farmhouse cheddar with earthy grassy tones would be nice as this brew has a certain earthy characteristic."
"Overall: Pretty easy to drink, the flavors are not overpowering but still prevalent. A little sweeter than I like but there is just enough hop bitterness to help balance it out."
"M + D: Somewhat chewy body, carbonation makes itself known somewhere over the middle of the tongue, giving it a sparkling sensation rather than a stickiness. Almost too easy to drink, with a nice smoothness that makes it all that much more pleasant. Recommended drinking."
"D - Highly drinkable, given the unusual nature of this brew, at 7% its alcohol is well tolerated because of the flavors and the character of this beer."
"Not a typical dopplebock by any means. Reminds me more of an hopped up amber/red."
"Overall this a very good beer, however I would have never guessed it is a doppelbock. I could not really find any malt in it and thought that is was more of an IPA. Either way i enjoyed it."
"Pours out a ruby reddish gold with nice big white head that laces well. Really hoppy for a dopplebock in the nose, very floral tinge of citrus and a splash of some sweet roasted caramel malts. Tastes starts out with a nice sweet malt bocky taste, but is rudely interrupted by a hops explosion of bitter citrus and piney nature. Very nicely done. It is like no other doppelbock I've had, but when it's done like this, it's a great pleasure. Very smooth drinking beer with the nice balance achieved with this one. Must try again."
"D- At 7% abv, it's strong but not too strong. This beer can stick with you for some time."
"poured into a pint glass, poured a rich red color with a three finger tan head rising and lingering for awhile, the smell was a bit sweet, hops and a strong alcohal aroma. the first flavors that hit my toung was sweet malt and sweet alcohal, then thay are washed away to smooth hop bitterness that almost stings your toung and you can still taste minits later, this is a great beer!"
"I had this on tap at the Grey Lodge. It pours a deep amber with a moderate white head, good lacing. The aroma is full of hops, a heavy amount of citrus. The beer is labeled as a Doppelbock, but it taste like an IPA. The flavor is dominated by citrus, there is a malty backbone, but it is dominated by hops. The beer is a light/medium bodied quaffer. I liked this beer and graded it as if it were an IPA. IMO this is not a doppelbock, but it is a good brew."
"This is an interesting beer for sure. It's hot a lot more hops flavor/smell then your typical doppelbock, but still has most of the main doppelbock characteristics. It's a very drinkable beer, that I wouldn't mind having again."
"Dark copper pour, head is intense at first but diminishes quickly. Really thought this guy was an IPA from the name, but I was delightfully surprised. A nice hoppy lager for sure. I smell grapefruit and citrus, quite strange for a doppelbock. Mouthfeel is medium and sticky, I still am having a hard time classifying this beer. Tastes so much like an IPA. Very smooth, velvety for a lager. Certainly glad I picked up a sixer of this beer, I've been dying to try it due to the name. Love it. Great beer, share it with others."
"Drinkability? Dang this is easy to drink. Plenty of flavour, great body, reasonable abv for the style, a very good drinker indeed. Oh and head retention is great as is the lacing. I enjoyed every ounce of this brew and was craving more. Well done, Stoudt's!"
"(I know I didn't go into the specifics of the beer like I normally do, but if you want that, read the other reviews. I just felt like summarizing my tasting experience, and now I'm going to get back to my wonderful beer... cheers!)"
"I could have a few more of these with out hesitation. Great beer, I really hope I can find more of this stuff."
"A great twist on a Doppelbock and one that everyone should try. Great one to give to your hop head friends."
"Taste is very flavorful, all of the aromatics can be found on the palate, hops, mango, peach, pears, grapefruit, pine and hints of toasted malts as well. Not sure it fits the category, but very interesting and very enjoyable!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style with an extra burst of hops that you don't too often in the style, this is a good flavorful beer with substance that is worth drinking for a very long time."
"This one leans a little towards a Maibock in terms of color and taste. Not the best by traditional standards, but it is still very good as it plays with the style guidelines a little."
"Overall: a pleasant surprise"
"Overall an interesting and hop driven dopplebock."
"D - A little heavy on the hops for me, but interesting nonetheless. I probably wouldn't buy this, but wouldn't turn a free one down."
"D - I'd say pretty highly drinkable. Could definitely drink a couple. A nice hoppy beer that hop heads who aren't into doppelbocks can enjoy."
"Drinkability: As you can tell from the score I gave this beer, I now have a new favorite Stoudt's beer. ""Smooth Hoperator"" was nothing short of being a great easy drinking hoppy Lager. I would have no problems drinking this winner again. If you're thinking this is going to be a take on a traditional German Doppelbock, think again!"
"Overall, a great beer by Stoudts. It really smashes out of the doppelbock mold, while certainly holding on to the essence of the style. Very solid beer, and I would definitely have it again."
"This is an outstanding hoppy beer for those who are into bitter hoppy brews. Not for the faint of heart, though this is more balanced and easier drinking than others in its class."
"Overall, this is a great showing buy Stoudts. Probably the best beer I have had by them and definitely one of the best doppelbocks!"
"Now I feel better. By previous review was not fair."
"A really unique take on a Doppelbock that is packed with a ton of hops and drinks a lot easier than that style would dictate. Tasty and refreshing, Stoudts has a winner with this one."
"Six 12oz bottles for $12 from Bauer Wines in Boston. Purchased mid-June 2008 with a mid-August expiry date - seems rather short, especially since it's a new offering at the store which appears to go through stock pretty quickly. Pours a dark copper red - clear with a big head. Nice malty aroma with a good deal of hops. First taste is well balanced between malt and hops. Medium bodied. Decent hops in the aftertaste. Lacing up the yin-yang. Adding to this rating with a later bottle, and the more I have, the more I like. A beer has to be pretty good to have a label that bad."
"This offering from Stoudt's pours a deep mahogeny leaving a thick tan head that is frothy and clings to the glass. The aroma is nutty, sweet caramel, bready, citrus hops, crisp, clean nose. The taste starts tart, very crisp, dry, upfront. The flavor then moves to suttle sweetness of caramel, bready, earthy aroma notes at around 7% the alcohol is present but not overwhelming. The finish leaves you smacking your lips, tartness, bitter hops, not as smooth and malty as I would expect from a doppelbock but nice enough to enjoy a few."
"D - Not as smooth as the label would lead you to believe, but still a great brew. Recommend to hopheads, may catch doppelbock drinkers off guard."
"D_Top notch, I really like this one and will look out for it. Definitely one smooth beer though my only complaint is it could have a little more hop wallop. However if the name wasn't hoperator I would not complain."
"Stoudts is great, nuff said."
"Mouth is good and I could drink a lot of these..."
"A clear amber with a big off-white head and great lacing. I enjoy a beautifully bright lemony sweet grapefruit hops aroma. The flavor offers a crisp citrus hops over a bready malt foundation. Very pleasant, fairly light and very drinkable, uniquely flavorful with tart hops but very drinkable and refreshing."
"D: Very good. Goes down easy and yet has some flavor to it. Worth checking out."
"Pours a very nice golden copper color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is hoppy, slightly malty, citrus/pines, and caramel. The taste is hoppy mostly with some malt notes, nice citrus/pines, with nice caramel tones. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is not a doppelbock. This is a very tasty IPA all the way. Highly recommended."
"Overall this was definitely a keeper. One of the better beers I have had lately and definitely a winner in my book. Very well balanced, not sure about the style classification, but still very good indeed. I would have no issues with picking up a good bit of this one down the road."
"Full and even mouthfeel. Creamy and rich, but finishes a bit crisp. Good beer, very driinkable."
"Stoudt's developed a really interesting beer with this one. The hop flavor really is the surprising component that propels it to ""very good"" status. Given the name, it's not a huge surprise. But, somehow it manages to be when you taste it. It's just hard to imagine the flavor combo that smacks you in the face. I haven't had a beer quite like this one. In any event, it works. Check it out."
"The aroma invites sweetness, there is initial caramel sweet followed up immediately by all IPA-level hops. Big malty head. A good bitterness. Amarillo and summit hops. A bit of toasted malt.Smooth drinking with suitable carbonation.Fresh and satisfying."
"Drinkability is good. This is a nice easy drinking beer. I could easily enjoy more than one of these in a seating. But it is a bit too high in ABV to be sessionable. Quality brew overall that is well worth trying."
"both taste and mouthfeel were excellent... slightly carbonated with alot of amber flavor.. I really like this beer and at 7% can't session it too much but I will try to get more of this in the future as add in to trades.. very good and recommended"
"Drinks great, just not a dopple, maybe if dopples came outta San Diego or Kent they'd be like this. Good beer, off style though. Would score higher as an AIPA to me"
"Nice dark amber with golden orange outlines. Big sticky super pillowy long lasting off white head. Fresh grassy, piney and citrus hints with sweet toasty malts in the nose. Very slight hint of alcohol comes into play as well. Intense hops sting with some pine, floral and grassy hit while having a super smooth sweet carmelled malt flavor that actually clashes in a very enjoyable way with hop flavors. The malt and hop profile seem to take turns tugging on you senses, and it makes for a unique enjoyable experiance. Feel on the mouth is wonderfull and its easily drinkable."
"Watery mouthfeel with a little carbonation. good to try but I won't buy another."
"Even the head brewer of Stoudt's says it reminds him of an IPA"
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer and certainly the most hopped up doppelbock I have ever tasted. The big flavors may not meld as well as I would like, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"mild, even empty flavor at first, but the hops kick in right before the swallow. they are there for the after taste but mellow quickly. it's not as thick as it appeared. smooth like the name says and very drinkable. simple, but full flavors. grab this one if/while you can."
"Bright and crisp with a medium body and a mildly bready hop aftertaste that really contributes to the overall mouthfeel for me. Light and very fine (yet substantial) carbonation. A great collaboration of of bready caramel malt and big hops."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and very easy drinking. Might not be very true to style, but a very drinkable doppel."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer is dark copper colored with a thick head leving sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma is really hoppy, this doesn't smell like a doppelbock at all. I expected hops based on the name but still this was nice. The taste is unique, a very good mix of hops into doppelbock malts. The hops wins the fight hands down. Nice beer from Stoudts."
"The flavor is up front and robust; very hoppy and quite earthy. The malt sweetness was present, but not the focus-- if anything it enhanced the musty, herbal tinge of the hops. Mouthfeel was smooth and medium-full. Overall this is an ambitious brew that may be a bit too green. Nice, unique effort though."
"Pours a clear brown with a ruby and amber tint. Nose is niiiice. Nice hoppy, red character. Me like. Flavor is hoppy and like a red ale as well. Nice robust tones that stay constant. Feel has a good carbonation and nice liquid feel. This is damn drinkable. A very well made brew. Must try."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into Harp pint glass. Label on this bottle is classic. I recently started saving labels and the Smooth Hoperator and Peche Mortel are by far my favorites. Firm pour results in two finger rocky head. Moderate lacing. Light brown in color with a nice rocky off white head. Smell is citrus and floral hops with a pungent malt backbone. Taste is slightly complicated. Citrus hops initially on the palate, followed by a nice malt body that may be considered a bit thin, finishes with a slight hop bitterness. A very nice beer that can be a bit cloying as it warms. Marked down slightly on drinkability."
"make of it what you will. an intruiging beer for sure. what's a style anyway?"
"Surely interesting experience."
"Quite a nice brew that I could drink a few of, I guess the 7% would catch up with me, but I wouldnt taste it coming. Worth a shot if you see it."
"update: Got a fresh bottle much better nose. Much hoppier. Really nice and different beer."
"D- Its interesting and kind of wish I'd picked up a whole 6er instead of just a bottle to try"
"It's not your traditional example of the style. But, who cares when it tastes this good! Both hoppy and malty, this is highly drinkable and shows the creativity of American craft brewing! Well-done!"
"D - smooth and easy to drink."
"Taste: very flavorful, all of the aromatics can be found on the palate; hops, mango, peach, pears, grapefruit, pine and hints of toasted malts as well. Not sure it fits the category, but very interesting and very enjoyable!"
"D: Easy drinking and keeps you interested."
"Recommended..."
"Easy enough to drink but not my favorite style."
"Hopheads will enjoy this. It has a wonderful bitter flavor."
"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for this one. It pours a clear deep amber color. The head is two inches in height, fluffy, and recedes very slowly into a lot of sticky lacing. The aroma is of very hoppy for a doppelbock, or any other beer for that matter. Grapefruit, grass clippings, with hints of caramel and toffee underneath. The taste is a little maltier than the aroma, but is still dominated by hops. Caramel leads the way, but is soon cut in half by the sharp hop edge. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer for what the brewer intended it to be. A wiser BA than myself once said, ""I can tell you if a beer is high quality, and I can tell you if I like it, but the answer isn't always the same."" I can tell you that this is a high quality beer, but I am not a huge fan of hoppy doppelbocks. Still, props to the brewer for stretching the definition of beer."
"This beer is very good and quite unique. It is certainly a hybrid of sorts, that does blaze its own path. The beer pours a copper color amber with some retaining head and lacing. There isn't much carbonation, which reminds me a bit of the doppelbock or octoberfest in the beer. The smell is very pungent floral estery hops. The smell is amazing. The pine scents just last and last. It truly is an amazing aroma that is unlike most hopped up ales. The taste is IPA in part with the estery, somewhat oily and chewy hop bite and grapefruity puckerishness. But there is a doppelbock element to the beer in that there are caramelly amberish malts, a medium body, some sweet almondy flavors, and a slight flatness in terms of carbonation. The malty sweetness blends so well with the estery hop bite, that the beer is incredibly unique. The mouthfeel is slightly oily, the hops linger but don't overpower. This beer is well worth seeking out."
"Great brew if I lived closer it would defiantly be a go to brew for me, highly drinkable"
"Great brew with a style that's difficult to define. I wouldn't immediately think Dopplebock when it's served, but I wouldn't necessarily think DIPA either. I'll just call it a tasty brew."
"For my money, Stoudts Smooth Hoperator deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the outstanding Fat Dog (Imperial Oatmeal Stout). Kudos to the brewery for giving us beer geeks something new and different. Not to mention hoppy and delicious."
"This is an awesome beer, plain and simple. Try to fit it tightly into a style description (like doppelbock, as it's listed) and you're going to be disappointed. But drink it for what it is - an awesome, unique beer - and you can't possibly be."
"I'm very happy that I had a chance to drink a couple (or more...) of these in their run. Very drinkable, tasty, enjoyable brew"
"d: This is an unusual offering that really doesn't fit any category. I can't believe it took me so long to try this!"
"D: Oh boy - I could go for another"
"The same grassy herbal piney flavors the smell indicated. Great hops and bitterness on the finish. A bit of dopplebock shows through but most is masked with the hop. Floral on the finish with a bready malt character. Mouth is very thin on draught compared to what I've had in bottle. Otherwise a fine drinker."
"Wow!! What an outstanding beer this is. I was even hesitant to try it. Pours a nice oft brown color. Lacing all the way down, glad I let it warm up before tasting. Rich, floral, hoppy aromas on the nose, almost IPA like. The taste is even better. Smooth, crisp, malty, yet hoppy as well, but not too much. The hops do not linger. Don't know if this is a dopplebock, really. Whatever the style, it is unique and well worth a good try!!"
"D- Very drinkable. Really nice, smooth and goes down great."
"With the sweet malt and pronounced hopping, I would say this is right on for an Imperial red."
"Ruby red in color. Small head, gone fairly quickly. Thin wispy lace. Strong grassy hop aroma. Nice earthy hop flavor at first sip. Some malty nutty tones in the aftertaste. Nicely carbonated, good meduium mouth feel. Good drinkability. Seems like a nicely balnced IPA except its a lager not an ale. Good stuff."
"Poured a clear deep copper red color with a nice layer of creamy tan head, ok retention, great lacing. Smells of citrus, grass, caramel, and biscuits. Taste is really unusual for a doppelbock, lots of hoppiness like grapefruit and fresh cut grass up front followed by the sweetness of caramel and brown sugar along with bread. Finishes with more earthy hops and an ever so slight alcohol touch protruding. Medium in body, good carbonation, just as smooth as the name suggests with a nice bitterness. Very easy to drink, great flavors and a good balance. One of my favorites from Stoudts."
"Great drinkability."
"One of the most pleasant surprises I've yet to come across. SEEK THIS OUT FAST!!!! Big cheers to the brewers at Stoudts!"
"Very drinkable, I'm glad I picked up case so I can sit and enjoy a few more over this weekend."
"Pours a clear copper hue with a one finger off-white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Light webbing left on the sides of the glass. Love the smell of this one. Oily pine and citrus hops with powerful caramel malt backbone. Such a unique combination, but it works so well. An interesting apple like aroma dances in the nose throughout as well. Taste is unique as well, but in a good way. This is a doppelbock? Taste is mostly hops with grapefruit and slick pine coming through. Towards the end is where the malty flavors emerge. An enjoyable carmel sweetness in the aftertaste with a slight floral and lemon zest. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Medium body with a subtle carbonation. Goes down so easy. Amber ale? Doppelbock? Pale ale? Who the hell cares, this is a damn good beer. Thanks again Dan for hooking me up."
"I was quite surprised to see this listed as a Doppelbock. The hop character is clearly the dominant note here; even to be an American interpretation the malt really needs to play a bigger role here (this is of course my own opinion though as this beer clearly shines as an example that I am wrong). This really does not work for me even on a purely hop driven level as the garlic / herbal hop character of Summit hops is just a bit too dominant to be enjoyable. This is just another beer that proves to me how much I really do not like Summit hops."
"The drinkability is good, with a little tweaking in the hop profile this brew could be a monster. Prosit MK"
"Flavor is an intense dark hop blast. Very smooth, with rich hops. Piney, citrusy, strong."
"D - I could easily enjoy a couple of these in one sitting. I like dopplebocks and I like hops, so this offering is a match made in heaven!"
"Drinkability: yes please. At 7% it is still a pleasurable beverage. I had this at the brewery and had to bring back a 6 pack to share with friends."
"The beer pours a deep amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice mix of roasted malts and hops. There appears to be some crystal malt sweetness as well, but the hops really stand out in this one. The taste is great! It has a powerful hop flavor that just blows you away in the beginning. Then the malts hit you in the finish. It's got a sweet crystal malt taste as well as a dry roasted malt flavor. The hops create such a bitter palate. It resinates on your tongue in the finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an awesome beer. I'm not sure it follows typical doppelbock guidelines, but it really drinks well."
"Drinkability--An easy drinking beer for sure. While this is considered a dopplebock I would not classify it as such....regardless of what it is Stoudts made a nice brew with this one."
"Drinkability: Not too bad for a doppelbock desperately trying to appeal to the hopheads out there."
"D: Virtually perfect. Maybe a slightly strong hop profile for true malt-heads. I really enjoy Stoudt's take on this style."
"Red amberish presentaion with a long lasting white head. Mad Cascadesque hop nose. Tastes of charred wood, oranges and spicy alcohol. This beer is super smooth with tons of hop flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-full. Drinkability is nice. Very ""hopflavorful"" with a crisp finish."
"Very clear orange colour with a fine, whitish head. Great retention with thick, solid lacing. The aroma is all hops - floral and pine, fruity and earthy. Nice balance of hop character. Solid bitterness that's not overpowering. Sweet orange and grapefruit flavours were balanced by short-lived toffee. Intense floral hops with faint pine and a moderately hoppy finish. Smooth, malty texture, lowish carbonation with a little bit of strange slickness. Very drinkable with a great balance of flavours."
"12 ounce bottle, ""Best by 9/23/07"" dating etched onto the neck of the bottle. Pours almost ruby amber, clear, with a few bubbles rising to the top. Medium tan head and leaving spotty and stringy lacing. Malty, nutty nose, with flourishes of leafy, resiny hops. Full flavor, complex brew. Layers of rich malts and then resin laden waves of hoppy dryness. Nice, well worth a try"
"d - easily drinkable but could have been a little more flavorful for me but it had some good points."
"D - The flavor of a nice amber ale. Sweet and plenty of hops it Hoperates well in the league of accentuated hop beers."
"D: very drinkable - nice blend of malty bock with american IPA and a half."
"With this beer, Stoudt's answered a question I've been asking for a long time: what would happen if you took a lager and just hopped this shit out of it? It seems to work pretty well here-- it's even more refreshing than a normal IPA, even with all the malt they put in to make this a doppelbock."
"This is what you get when hops meet bock. truly an enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: smooth and enjoyable. This is a great beer from Stoudts. Try this if you see it on tap."
"D - I think this is around 7% - I'm feeling it after 2. Dangerously smooth and very nice indeed. An experiment gone right!"
"I'd wondered for quite a while why there wasn't a lager equivalent to the IPA. Well, here it is, big and hoppy, It has a very American citrus and perfume aroma with matching flavor. The taste, however, adds a bit of citrus rind and very smooth, almost light, caramel malt. Unfortunately, there's a touch of alcohol in the nose, but for the most part the 7% abv is well hidden. It's not the lager version of Two Hearted, but its a great beer."
"Cheers!"
"Very tasty and very hoppy for a an amber lager. Recommended!"
"Appearance is amber in color, crystal clear, with a touch of white head on top and no real lacing. Nose is mostly floral hops, a touch of sweetness. Taste is solid and well-balanced. Lots of floral hops up front and in the pretty short aftertaste, with a good amount of sweet malt in the middle. This one tastes like a solid APA or mild IPA. Feel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Actually one of the better ones I've had from Stoudt's; too bad it's a one-time brew."
"D - Very enjoyable hopped beer that is not filling"
"Poured a deep amber color with a nice off white head that disapated quickly. Aroma of a sweeter malt and subtle citrus hops. In the taste, I would never guess it is a lager, in tastes just like an IPA. A nice maltly body. I really like this beer, I hope Stoudt's keeps it around for a while."
"I'm glad somebody decided to brew a German style bock with some American hops a long overdue experience. Appears a ruby amber tone crystal clear cast to it with a large tan head thick bubbles fomrs large floating above the glass like a biscuit. Aromatics are very nice with full piney and floral hop bouqets with some leafy tobacco and spicy character complemented by a nice warming biscuit caramel malt presence. Flavor comes off upfront leafy herbal bitterness, piney hops really are the highlight with some rolling blended caramel malt rather spicy with a biscuit bready tone to it finishes pretty clean with some hops sticking around. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is rather light despite the large bubbled nice sized head flows even with a slick oily finish. Drinkability is great an original concept with more than ample flavor I like what Stoudt's has done I could have a few of these without a problem."
"Overall-As I said, I reviewed this as a dopplebock, even though it is listed here on BA at the time I reviewed as an Amber Lager. With that in mind, I don't believe it hits the dopplebock mark head on but it one of the best I've had to date. The out-of-style big hop presence really adds to the style in my mind (which resides in my hophead). So having now been to the Stoudt's website and seeing that it is listed as an American Dopplebock, I say hell yeah, if Americans can their own IPA, then why not the dopplebock. Awesome beer."
"Overall: A disappointing amber beer. A pretty decent IPA. Overall a moderate American craft beer offering. Nothing that really stands out about this one. I was a little surprised by the abv because this is a really smooth beer."
"Pours a translucent amber with some copper highlights. Beige head stays for about 15 seconds and then forms a stickage ring around the glass. Light toasty malt character with a good dosage of leafy hop aroma. One wouldn't really expect this to be a lager, but it is pretty clear from the aroma, clean and lagerish smelling with a greater amount of higher alpha hops. Very hoppy tasting, too. Bitter upfront with some tea-like tannins shining through, some residual sweetness pulls through and finishing dry, crisp and smooth. A nice alternative to an IPA. Medium to full bodied, slick on the tongue, with a healthy carbonation level. A very nice lager with hopheads in mind. BTW, the ""dude"" on the bottle looks like he's the spawn of Joe Camel and Tubbs from Miami Vice..."
"Winner in my book! Nice & hoppy, but not too heavy (body or alcohol). Could be a troublemaker though, I had no idea this was 7%."
"Medium body with a drying finish to it. Makes me want another one. Very easy to drink and highly enjoyable. I will have to get some more of this very soon. Still amazed at what they did to an amber lager...great job, Stoudt's!"
"D: The abv is well hidden but can catch up to you. Still, this hybrid harvest maibock really hits the spot."
"Overall, this is a solid beer and quite interesting. There are very few lagers that are hopped this aggressively, and it pleases me that Stoudt's released this one. I'd recommend this one both to hopheads and lager lovers that are looking for something a bit different."
"D- At 7% ABV this is not a session beer, but a good quaff nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Smooth, clean and drinkable."
"Overall the beer is an absolute winner and I'd like to see it mass produced."
"Im glad I tried this but I have had better amber,red lager and while it was very hoppy it did live up to its name but the hops seemed kinda bland."
"This is very reminiscent of some significantly more expensive IPA's I've had, so I'm surprised to see it categorized as a lager. All in all, an excellent choice, especially for the price."
"Must try beer for hopheads,enjoyed this one a lot will be drinking this beer again"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitter from the yeast and hop selection that carries mostly notes of herbs that collapse on the middle of the tongue in a dry fashion after starting off with a caramel sweetness."
"Overall, I ended up taking a growler home of this one I liked it so much, Beers like this remind you that other Lagers, besides Bocks, can be so complex and tastey. If you see it, pretend ""Stoudt's Smooth Hoperator"" are the only words you can say."
