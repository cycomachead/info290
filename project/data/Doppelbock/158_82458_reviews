"Aroma definitely gets your attention - strong and malty with a caramel overtone and notes of spice and chocolate plus an earthy hint. Pours a translucent chocolate brown, close to mahogany, with a thick and fairly persistent tan head that leaves some generous lacing. Flavor does not quite equal the promise of the aroma, but is still quite good - malty, bready, subtle notes of caramel, cloves and chocolate. Smooth texture has good body and fizz, and leaves a malty, woody, slightly chocolaty finish. Get this goat!"

"Overall: i haven't read a review yet for this beer but I can see the reviews being a over the place. Definitely more of a warm weather beer, really doesn't need tweaking and honestly I would be glad to buy another bottle. Salud."

"D - A most outstanding Doppelbock which shouldn't be a surprise coming from a fine brewery like Great Divide... The only real constructive criticism is that a bit more of a robust mouthfeel would go a long way to making this offering truly world class... With that aside, this is still an terrific well rounded lager with lots to offer to all those who encounter it..."
"Love the aroma of this beer. Has good lacing and maintains a minimal cream colored head to the finish. Dark, cloudy amber color with sweet notes on the pallet. The 8% abv is the con on this one. After half pint one starts to taste the alcohol instead of the caramel, toffee flavor. Overall I would recommend this as a two pint wonder on movie night at home. Great taste!"

"Overall: Coming into this brew, I wasn't really expecting much. But boy, was I blown away. Not just another boring bock, but something special. The sweet cocoa and malty bitterness really balances out the flavors and brings everything together. Delicious and goes down quite smooth. I would try again and would totally recommend to a friend. Cheers!"

"o: this is a very good dopplebock and a great beer to put in the fridge. It was very much like the german dobbelbocks but had a nice addition of local flavors to enhance the taste."
""

"Mouthfeel is a little flat (maybe age?), quite sticky. Overall, it's not bad. Not special. But, I wouldn't consider this a definitive review, being more than 1.5 years past the bottled on date."
"O- I enjoyed this beer. It had a lot going on with really nice balance."
"A great go at probably my favorite style of beer. So yummy, masterfully brewed. Another home run from Great Divide. A whole bomber to myself, lucky me."

"I actually picked up on something like dank rotting wood, but in a really nice way - maybe that's just the Pacific Northwesterner in me. The alcohol is present but, like the rest of the various aspects, not cloying or at the front. Everything moves in and out. I'm the type to eat and drink slowly, for the most part, so I'll take a few deep drinks and then let the beer sit on the table for five minutes; I think the tortoise had it right, slow and steady wins the race. My second or third time lifting the glass actually presented a kind of soy or tamari quality, with salt lingering. I also get tar, if that makes sense, kind of as a deeper extension of the licorice. Interesting beer, no doubt."

"NYE bottle share at Proof. Pours a deep reddish amber brown with a decent amount of light tan head. Collar holds really well. Aroma is caramel, some medium roasted malt, and a little bit of dark fruits. Taste is very earthy, some caramel. Very low carbonation and medium-high body."

"O-This is a pretty enjoyable example of the style, with a few quirks. The look and smell are spot-on for a doppelbock, but the taste throws a few curveballs that I cannot fully endorse. The first curve is the strange, almost spicy, zesty character that accompanies the malt bill, and the second curve is the strangely herbal/floral finish. These oddities don't kill the beer, but they take it off style and I'm not sure I agree with them."
""
"taste is sweet and malty; little hop bitterness. some alcohol in the taste I think this is an excellent version of an American dopplebock. some places just seem to do a LOT right- Deschutes, The Bruery.... Russian River. Green Flash... even Stone and Lost Abbey. among others. I have come to feel Great Divide is another one of those places. I love the dopplebock and that is a style most of those other breweries just listed don't seem to have a great one of, if even one at all."
""
""
""
"O- a great example of a Doppelbock. I wish there was more of an aroma, but other than that, this beer hits it all."
""
""
""
"O: Great example of this style, and non metallic tasting, which seems to plague doppelbocks for me."

"Overall - This one of the better domestic doppelbocks available."

"Pours a dark amber with one finger light tan bubbly head. Head dissipates rather quickly. Strong aroma right off the bat. Smells sweet, malty, and bready. Definitely some chocolate and tartness in the aroma as well. Medium bodied with great feel. Sweet Malty and bready with a slight bitterness to balance it out. Hard to explain since I am new to this style. Definitely fits the meal in a glass description. I am really enjoying this beer."

"Having had many products from Great Divide including a stop at the brewery itself, I was excited to give this beer a try. It is delicious! There is a reasonable amount of maltiness, it's mildly sweet, and thankfully has very little hop bite. Flavor and aroma is interesting ... pleasant caramel comes through as well as, believe it or not, a hint of banana!"
""
"Overall: Enjoyable and easy to drink. Neither a sipper, nor a gulper. The marmalade was an unexpected, yet fun surprise. Was lacking in the darker fruits and chocolatey flavors that are common for this beer style, but this did not seem to detract. The clean quality and finish made this an excellent representation of a Doppelbock in that the beer was flavorful and strong, yet still had the clarity and lightness of a lager."
""
""
"Although a high ABV, it didn't taste like it did. I wish I had had some cheese to have with this, this is the perfect beer to enjoy over a period of time - I think it would greatly benefit with a food pairing."
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with some beautiful crimson highlights. A substantial one-finger, tan head that reduced to a 1/4"" but that holds its own. Ripe, dark fruit scents: plum, dates, raisins, banana; some caramel and toffee notes, too; dark rum. The taste is a bit more one-dimensional: sweet, sugary, booze-soaked fruit cookies. Fig Newtons come to mind, and there is a breadiness to it. The lacing is exceptional, and the carbonation is understated. Not too syrupy or viscous."
""

"Mouthfeel had a medium body with a good caramel like stickyness to it. medium carbonation and very slight dry finish"

"Pours a cloudy, brown color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, earthy malt, hint of hops, hint of pale malt, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of Doppelbock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight caramel malt, slight earthy malt, hint of hops, slight alcohol, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, not enough hops to balance the high levels of malt, but good flavors."
"O: a very nice beer - not a style I have great familiarity with, but I found this similar in feel and presentation to the Ayinger doppelbock, but the sugars were a little more forward and there was less complexity to the flavor. A rewarding drink in any event."
""
""

"Overall: a very enjoyable doppelbock that has a nice focus on the maltiness without being overtly hoppy. Easy to consume this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall worthy of the 8 dollar price tag but I kind of wish this was bottled in 12 oz singles since the price would rival Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock and I could pull the trigger easier. Regardless they do make a great Doppelbock."

"Great to find a bottle of this I was kind of pissed when I missed it's release last summer, pours a turbid plum brandy cola tinted color with caramel beige head forming thick with large bubbles of flowing carbonation. Aromatics offer up hints of plum, raisin, dark malts over ripened fruit, beautiful beer almost cider like tartness amongst the dark roasted malts. Flavor rustic lager flavors, smoke meat, just a hint of that, with big ripe dark fruits, plum juicy raisins, and plum that dark juice you can only get from the source. A definite German style lager from Colorado, excellent take by all means I'm just so spoiled to have tried so many great doppelbocks from PA they are the kings of the German beer styles brewed in America with minor exceptions along the way. Hints of dark chocolate and toffee as I take a few more sips with the dark fruit a mesmerizing beer experience, I'm glad I'm digging in now a year later. Mouthfeel is great smooth easy going each sip easier than the next I'm glad I found it subdued and refrigerated for a year it's been truly lagered, easy going carbonation great chewy dopplebock medium to full bodied. Overall I can't stop talking about this beer, excellent stuff nails the style truly good drinking doppelbock they better still make this stuff."
"O - This is surprisingly balanced. There is nothing obscene about this beer. And the 8% alcohol? Not even noticeable. The drinkability of this beer is off the charts."

"*Overall a very enjoyable DB. Need to sip it a bit, its true to it's style and slightly thick. ""bread is a glass""."
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/5/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear deep mahogany color with a nice 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, prune, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, dark bread, biscuit, nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of dark malty flavors with well balanced fruitiness. Taste of caramel, raisin, prune, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, chocolate, biscuit, nuttiness, and light roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, dark fruit, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, biscuit, nuttiness, and light earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity of dark malty flavors with moderate fruitiness; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent doppelbock! Great balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and extremely smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering; one of the better examples I have had in the style."

"Rich, syrupy palate with a little abv.% heat that cuts through the palate on the finish.Rich, dark fruits, caramel and some dark toffee all mix together with a faint Earthy hop undertone. Rich, malty, sweet, and strong. A pretty good Doppelbock if I do say so!"
"I'm on the fence with this beer. It looked nice, but it smelled and tasted like something was holding it back. I might try it again in the future. That's because it's a solid Doppelbock."
"The beer is a deep dark mahogany color. A foamy cream colored head recedes to large bubbles and wisp. Webbed sticky lacing coats the glass. The aroma is toffee and caramel sweetness followed by an oak wood note with a faint smokiness. The taste is much like the aroma with delicious sweet caramel and buttery sweet bread starting off. Toffee comes in the middle with a slight woody quality to finish it. Faint hops in the finish that leaves a slight tang. Mouthfeel is sticky and otherwise medium in weight. Overall, this is truly delicious. I need to drink more Dopplebocks."
"Overall: Better than most of the domestic examples of the style I have tried as it avoids the cloying sweetness; still it lacks some of the malty depth and complexity of the best of the German examples"
"Overall an enjoyable and worthy take on the noble style. Happy to get to try this slightly aged bottle."
"Excellent dopple! Huge, foamy, then frothy, tan head that settles after a bit and some lace. Color is an nice, clear cherry brown. Aroma is fantastic with roast, malt, fruits. Flavor’s like nose with lots more going on. True to style. Lots of depth. Plenty of malt with muscle mildly bitter perfectly balance. Body is full and generally round. Finish is like true to flavor with no unpleasant surprises."

"a good beer, definitely not an americanized version of the style and yet not as refined as the stalwarts brewing in germany"
""
""
""
"Poured into a Pilsner glass. Beautiful deep amber color with red hues, rich looking. the color of the head compliments the liquid nicely and recedes to a thin layer across the top; lacing clings to glass for awhile. The aroma is a bit thin; hints of fruit and sourdough bread. Toffee flavor up front, light hops, very little bitterness. Tastes as rich as it looks. An excellent balance. Silky smooth mouthfeel; light carbonation. I enjoyed this beer immensely. A very nice break from the stouts and porters I usually load up on."

"Purchased at Buy-Rite Liquors Jersey City. 22oz. Bottled on June 25. I am very happy with this Doppelbock. Pours a beautiful dark cherry color with a tan firm head. It looks delicious. Caramel nose and maybe some chocolate. The taste is of darkened fruit and toffee, some hops as it recedes. Very enjoyable."
""
"Excellent dopple! I let it warm a bit too much before pouring with a huge, foamy, then frothy, tan head that settles after a bit and some lace. Color is an nice, clear cherry brown. Aroma is fantastic with roast, malt, fruits. Flavor's like nose with lots more going on. True to style. Lots of depth. Plenty of malt with muscle and the carbonic tang and bitter perfectly balance. Body is full and generally round but with some sharp points. Finish is like flavor, long, and very drinkable."

"On tap at Great Divide. Pours a moderate brown. Light toffee and dark fruit. Some sweetness. Medium body. Fairly good."

"O- A great dopplebock, and I have to admit I was not expecting it to be this enjoyable, especially after the one strange component of the smell. Glad to see a great dopplebock released by an American brewery."
""
""
""
"Overall, this as a remarkably balanced example of the style. Worth seeking out for fans of the style."
""
"While sweet this is not an overly sweet beer, (my wife however disagrees, leaving me with the full bomber all to myself) and I find the level of hops nicely balances things out. A very agreeable beer, but I would expect that from Great Divide."
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems quite balanced and drinkable compared to other doppelbocks because it isn't as heavy on the palate and doesn't have any stickiness."
"O: Kudos for Great Divide for even making a doppelbock. This under-appreciated and under-represented style needs more brewers to step up to the plate and deliver. For ""liquid bread"" the viscosity of this doppelbock was a little thin, and the flavours were a little uncharacteristic. However, this is still a good doppelbock that is worth trying. But, so far my favourite North American take on the style is from Les Trois Mousquetaires in Quebec."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll likely purchase another bottle of this when I get a hankering for a doppelbock again... or just need a good, easy drinking beer with a bit more malt and a bit more character to it."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark reddish brown color with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly to a smattering of bubbles on top. The aroma is sweet with burnt sugars and light sweet dark fruits along with a bit of toffee that seems a bit out of place. Faint floral hop aroma provides little balance to the malty sweetness. The flavor is sweet with lots of caramel and brown sugar flavors and a bit of burnt sugar sweetness. Light prune flavor along with a weak coffee type melanoid thing going on. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet crisp mouthfeel. I find that so many American breweries try to replicate the dopplebock style and can't seem to pull it off. This is a fine beer, but compared to some of the hallmarks of the style it just doesn't compare. The smooth melanoid and rich dark dried fruits are lacking in this example."
""
""
"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma has some roasted malt with a hint of chocolate mixed in. The flavor is very similar. There is some roasted malt and a very light hint of smoke. I also get some chocolate and some dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"O- this might be my favorite offering from GD. For once a American brewery can make an exceptional German dopplebock! Find it, drink it, its liquid bread. A meal in its self."
"3.0 D: It's not a bad beer and it's definitely drinkable, but there isn't enough flavor to put this anywhere above average."
"Lots of toast and biscuit on the tongue. There's a touch of burnt malt, but it's in the background. Light hop and even a lighter body. Carbonation is fine. Overall, easy to drink but not that complex."

"Very clean and bready. Nothing complex but very precise malts. It drinks very new but i like it. Not sure why they called this Wolfgang for a Dopplebock."
"Bottled in June 2012. Maple syrup brown with a reddish hue and good clarity. Pours with a strong, stiff off-white foam with excellent staying power that leaves wet sheets of lacings on the glass. Sweet caramel malt, ripe apple, fig, and chocolate aromas with subtle herbal hop and nutty aromas in the background. Velvety, smooth delicate feel. Sweet, sticky caramel malt flavor draped with herbal hop bitterness up front. Ripe fruit and fig flavors follow with dark bready, nutty and light boozy flavors to the finish. Wonderful earthy flavors and aromas with a sesational feel. Wish Great Divide would put this is 12 oz bottles. A fabulous autumn/winter sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells of chocolate and yeasty bread with just the right amount of herbal and earthy hopping to accent the sweet aroma. Taste is centered around toasted bread in front with medium amounts of nuttiness and lesser quantities of chocolate and yeastiness in the background. As the glass warms, the herbal and earthy hopping aspects gain enough volume to make one of the more strikingly dry finishes I've ever tasted in a Doppelbock. In fact, overall this beer seems to be balanced more towards being savory and bready than being about caramel and toffee, and I'm totally OK with that. However, on the other hand, there is only the merest ghost of a presence of dark fruits in either nose or flavor, which could stand to be somewhat bigger relative to all the other elements."
"The beer is medium-bodied, with fairly low amounts of carbonation, leading to a smooth, though too-placid mouthfeel. Finish is expectedly dry, from hop usage and residual sweetness of the beer."
""
"Overall, this is good doppelbock, that is another good offering from Great Divide."
""
""
""
"There is a very slight metalic taste present but not a factor for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a caramel looking brown with a nice beige head. A nice bready aroma filled with some toffee, caramel, a little nutty. Flavor was very smooth also filled with bread, toffee, caramel, and a little nutty. It never gets too aggressive and offered a great balance. A nice fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, totally hit the spot at the bar tonight. I'd put this right behind the Yeti series for my favorite offering from Great Divide, might have to go out and grab myself a bomber of this."
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a goblet, bottled on July 03, 2012. This pours a clearish dark brown with a smaller short lived tan head. The smells are good, toffee, caramel, roasted nuts. The feel is medium to a little thicker and creamy. The taste is pretty great roasted nuts, caramel, dark fruit, quite nice."
"Overall a really nice beer and perfect for the fall season. Now they just need to make it a six pack."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice malty backbone with some good roast and body to balance."
"On-tap poured into a tulip. Clear russet brown, thin head of khaki foam forms from a mild carbonation. Dark rye bread, raisin, and toffee. Clean, mellow and dry which is something American brewers typically don't achieve with this style. A well-aged musty character creeps in and adds some depth. Light floral hoppiness adds balance. Another well done, balanced yet big beer from Great Divide."
""
"O: Unlike many American versions of this style, it is not cloyingly sweet - this is much more true to the German version of the style. This beer is very easy to drink and hides the 8% ABV extremely well. Very enjoyable and definitely a beer I would get again."
"not usually a huge bock or derivative fan, but this one is perfectly true to the style, and i love it for the fall. it pours deep and alluring low glow red color like cherry wood. its got a one inch thick caramel colored head that lasts the whole glass. smell is big big german malts, autumnally appropriate, maple sugary. the flavor is more than just the malts, although they are there in a big way. there is also an earthy yeast that makes me feel like raking leaves, carving pumpkins, and smoking a turkey all day. its just that kind of beer and flavor profile. the feel is outstanding. its got a huge body on it, but its still plenty drinkable. the sweetness up front and not in the finish, which i am not used to but really liked in this beer. the finish is bready and quick. its a lovely bomber of beer for less than 8 bucks. ill be enjoying this all fall."
"This beer pours out a deep ruby color with a small head. The aroma is malty and chocolatey, with some bread. The taste follows the nose, with a robust amount of malts. There's roast and bready aspects here for sure, along with some chocolate and caramel flavors. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and decently carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, this is one of the best American Doppelbocks I've had, easily. It's not up on Celebrator's level or anything, but it's a great stab at the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable, especially at the ABV."
"Great Divide never ceases to pump out quality brews. This is one of the most drinkable doppelbocks brewed on this side of the pond. The alcohol barely makes its presence known. I'm not quite sure this lives up to the German greats, but it comes damn close."
"O: very good. nice complexity and very well done. Great Divide makes some great beers and this one doesn't disappoint"
""
""
"A nice enough domestic version of the style, though for the life of me, I cannot imagine why I'd want to drink this over some of the better versions readily available from Germany."
"The flavor matched the aroma in many ways, but with some additional nutty notes and marshmallow. It is a jaunty beer that steps lightly despite it's 8% ABV. The creaminess of the head, although it did not retain thickly, settling rather quickly into a film with some fluff around the edges, played well with the flavors."
"O- I liked it. A good example of an American made Doppelbock."
"Solid, great beer!"
""
""
""
"O- A decent Doppelbock from a well respected American Brewery, Wolfgang is worth seeking out if you want to try something new."
""
""
"A decent dopplebock, could easily replace the raisin bread for your morning breakfast."
""
""
"AMAZING, MUST TRY!"
"Overall - WOw this is nice. Sweet, easy to drink, and pakcs a punch. Very balanced even with it being sweet, and it gets real sweet once it warms up. Alcohol is masked very well. A great beer, one of the best doppels ie had in a long time."
"O:  I expected this to be good but I was shocked at how good it really was. It was rich and earthy a complex balanced treat that is hard to find flaws in. Great Divide really nailed this style. "
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted and toasted malt, brown sugar, and some slight coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly fruity flavor. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Poured from tap at the brewery. Pours an amber maple syrup color. Really sweet english malt aromas. Taste is super mellow english malts, some caramel sweetness, a bit of vanilla, and mild mild hop. Its super smooth and really well balanced and super well hidden for 8%abv. Really nice brew! and great dopplebock...a must try for the approaching fall season."
"It’s been a while since I’ve been really impressed with one of Great Divide’s bomber releases. Today…I’m really impressed with Wolfgang. This is very good stuff. It’s very flavorful and is extremely enjoyable. Great Divide did a great job with this one. Keep this one in the rotation, please! Easy recommendation."
"A fizzy tan head starts slow and grows to two fingers. It stays forever. Color is dark brown with ruby red hues. Smells of sweet malts, persimmon, syrup and burnt sugar. Tastes sweet, syrupy and grainy. There's some brown bread involved, and I go looking for spice, but can't find any. It's a bit sticky as it should be and the alcohol is there but not overwhelming. Creamy up front with some crisp edges. Drier than expected. A welcome end of the summer treat that I will likely revisit soon."
""
""
"Overall, I think I want to pick up another! I enjoyed the beer from start to finish. A fantastic brew."
"Overall: Wolfgang is not a bad beer at all, but its flavor profile just doesn't float my boat."
""
"O: Notably unique brew that is a must try if available. This contributes an enjoyable twist to the style, and it does well to deliver an exceptionally easy to drink 8% beer."
""
"Overall this was an enjoyable blend of flavors. Went down alot lighter than 8%."
""
"O: A good dark lager. Generally not my favorite style but this one is one of the better examples I've had."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a pretty tasty dopplebock. Nice to find it on tap in Columbia."
"O: A solid lager for sure, the price is problematic when compared with Germany, but surely worth a try."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of earthy hops, sweet and roasted malt and dark fruit notes. Slightly earthy and bitter up front with some resinous hops that linger throughout. Surprising for the style. Although the hop character is stronger than expected, the complex malt character dominates. Nice balance of sweet and roasted notes with subtle smokiness. Hints of bread yeast and roasted coffee bean followed by chocolate, caramel, toffee and dark fruit. ABV is very well masked with no heat to speak of. Complex, flavorful and easy to drink."
""
""
"Wolfgang exemplifies the doppelbock style. On par with many of the better German varieties and well-worth grabbing a bottle or two (or three or...)."
""
""
"O: This one hits its mark. Most American doppels tend to be way too crazy. This one is reminiscent of traditional German doppelbocks. A good summer beer, but not really sessionable due to the high ABV. I wish I had a big ceramic mug for this bad boy..that would be perfect!"
""
"O: A very solidly made, easy to drink beer. Drinkable."
"Great divide does not make bad beer. It's official."
"(Note: I love doppelbocks and am usually disappointed by non-Bavarian versions, so take that into account. A good US version probably gets a little extra support from me. I'm not saying my rating is inflated, but people that don't love doppelbocks might have differing opinions)"
""
"Pours a clear garnet with one finger thick dense tan foam, settles to a thin layer leaving sprays of lace on the glass. Smell: sweet brown bread, prune, cherry-ish. Taste: toffee, plum, fig, with an earthy and grassy hopping cutting in midsip. Note of alcohol in the finish. Tasty. Bottled June 5, 2012."
"Pours a dark ruby red color put it to the light and you can see the clarity in this beer. Nice creamy looking head tan color. Smell is slightly sweet raisin scent malty. Smells like a good doppelbock should. Sweet, slightly smoky flavor. The toasted smokiness is on the back of the tongue. Slightly hot as well but not offensive. Probably will get even better after it breathes and warms a little. I'd buy this one again if I was in a doppelbock mood. Mouthfeel is pleasant slight bit of carbonation on the tongue when swirled in the mouth."
""
"O - I really enjoyed this, as I found the complexity intriguing. The dry finish was a little strange, but a minor flaw. A worthy effort."
""
""
"O: A pretty good Doppelbock. It is clean and has good flavor."
""
"Dangerously drinkable. Spicy with some gently hops along with the sharp flavors provide a nice balance to all the malt. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Philnor Liquor in Lakewood for $8.99."
"Overall: very nice dopplebock. Enjoyed very much."
"Overall, a nice rich and sweet doppelbock."
"This beer does not get in you face like many other American brewed versions, very well balanced and drinkable for its size. On par with its German counterparts, hunt this one down."
""
""
""
"This was disappointing. The toasted malt notes dominated throughout. There were subtle hints of a solid doppelbock underneath the toasted malt, but it had no hope of coming out. I'll pass on this in the future."
""
""
"Very drinkable, a good, not great dopple. Was hoping for a little more from this brewery..."
""
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium to dark red amber. One finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, hint of chocolate. Flavor is dominated by sweet malt with a hint of cocoa and a pleasant sweet finish of nuts, malt and light hops. Nice flavor progression and very pleasantly malty. Medium bodied with a good mouth feel. A great take on a doppelbock that I will return to."
"This brewery tends to go over the top (Yeti in all its variants), but this is spot on for the style. Rich and sweet but considerable complexity. Not sure why this is a summer release - not ideal for Florida heat in the dead of summer."

"O: This would pair perfect with a really sharp cheese. One of the most flavorful beers while still maintaining a level of drinkability. Reminds me of a mild, more drinkable scottish ale."

"Overall: full bodies beer for the season. Fairly complex and nice beer for the style."

"For a robust summer beer, this isn't bad at all. A nice doppelbock from GD. Would go well with some BBQ dark meats."
"An odd choice for a summer seasonal maybe but hey maybe not.Bottled on June 5th 2012.Poured into a 1/2 leter stein a deep amber tinged mahagony with great looking sticky off white crown atop.Alot of bready malt and molasses in the nose,a whiff of alcohol and caramel as well.Caramel and molasses flavors with a tinge of dark fruit,an underlying bready maltiness is the main component of the flavor profile.Just a tad thin in the feel but this is a real nice doppelbock,maybe not a beer I would wanna drink in the heat of summer but very good none the less."
