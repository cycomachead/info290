It's not the malty sweet caramel Doppelbock you are probably used to, but it is its own beast. The spicy quality of the beer wins a merit on their own. This is a great beer to pair with food.

4.27,6,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"The flavor profile is near World Class.  It is reasonably intense, a bit complex and exceptionally well balanced.  It begins with a burst of oak smokiness that lacks the meaty aspects of the nose, that slowly blends, rather than fades, with a rich underlying sweetness.  Both caramel and biscuit notes are present.  Here is where the rich malts of a doppelbock kick in.  In the middle, a balancing mild bitterness emerges over a vanilla note.  The finish is a slow fade of oak smoke and sweetness with a slight note of alcohol.","tillmac62","Feb 10, 2015"

2.51,-37.7,3.5,2.5,2,4,2.5,"Overall: My first encounter with a Schlenkerla, and assuredly not my last. I'd call this more of a rauchbier than a doppelbock, as the primary characteristic is the smoke - there's nowhere near the level of bready, toffee, caramel, nutty, or dark fruit flavors I would associate with a doppelbock, nor the sticky mouthfeel. I greatly enjoy this beer, but I am forced to rate it as a doppelbock because that's how it's classified, and therefore that's the style-specific ranking it will appear in. Were this lumped in as a rauchbier, use of oak instead of beech notwithstanding, my rating would be far higher - easily over a 4 in every category.","UrbanCaveman","Feb 06, 2015"

The smoke character in this one is much similar to the one in the Urbock-- it is not 'meaty' like the Märzen. A great beer and one that I found is very approachable for the style.

4.79,18.9,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,4.5," The flavor is rich with malt flavors with slight smoke on entry and sweet nutty flavor with light hop in the taste balancing some toffee in the middle with caramel and mild brown sugar with a slight fruitiness in the yeast with a slight dried apricot and mild bready toasted flavor adding to a slight cinnamon and vanilla accent with slight golden raisin type sweet and earthy flavor. There is a mild aromatic smoke in the dark fruity and woody finish which is not downplayed at all and compliments the layers of malt with slight taste of alcohol in the mostly dry finish.  Overall this is wonderful and I think the oak smoke in the dopplebock fits very well with truly delicious results.  A great example of how smoke can enhance and already great example of the dopplebock style -enjoyable in its subtlety yet fully flavored and rich w/ out any alcohol in the flavor which makes it deceptively drinkable and the smoke perfectly implemented in the aroma and flavor. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys smoked beer, strong lager or a dopplebock fan","Slatetank","Nov 08, 2014"

Charred wood, molasses, brown bread, smoked cheese, and peppercorn notes can be detected within the mix. The finish is soft, with a faint bitterness. Medium bodied with a noticeable ABV.

Taste is really quite interesting - the malt and toffee come out in the foreground, with the smoked, salt pork pleasantly integrated into the background - a juxtaposition of the nose.

Poured into a glass, the beer had a murky brown color with variations. The aroma reminded me most of smoked ham. Even though I do not eat/like ham, I love the aroma. In the initial taste, one gets the best qualities of a doppelbock and a smoke beer. The sweetness of the malt jumps to the front, but it is nicely balanced by the character of the smoke. In both case, the sizes of the taste are huge while balancing each other out. The malts sour slightly in the aftertaste, while the smoke lingers on the roof of the mouth. The thick texture allows the smoke to stick. This is a well-developed smoke beer, and a fabulous example of a doppelbock.","JohnnyHopps","0"

The aroma of smoked ham and toasted bread with a grainy, earthiness to it. Smoky flavor up front, then the sweet caramel malts come forward. There is a nice earthy hop flavor and some dark fruity flavors that linger. A hint of alcohol in the finish. Definitely a dopplebock and the smoke flavor doesn’t cover it up. Nice balance. Medium body and a nice low level of carbonation, smooth and silky. Overall a very drinkable beer at 8% ABV, and a very good and unique version of the style. The oak-smoked malt is definitely more subtle than their beech-smoked offerings. I have to say this is my favorite from Aecht Schlenkerla; If you didn’t like smoked beers you’ve tried before, (I didn't) I would recommend trying this one.

Despite the strong smoke in the aroma, the flavor leans more towards your traditional dopplebock with caramel/toffee malty sweet, a subtle prune fruitiness, and a touch of herbal hops.

The oak smoke really comes through here. It blends well with the breadiness and sweetness from the malt. It's rich, but not overwhelmingly so because the smoke helps balance everything well.

The nose is fairly one-note, but it has a nice hickory smoked bacon aroma. The glavor gas a solid bready malt opening. The rauch malt then comes in to finish out the flavor profile with a pleasant smoked meat/barbecue presence. There's a nice sturdiness to the body, while staying short of being overbearingly chewy. The carbonation is subtle, just enough to cut through the malt. Even if Aecht Schlenkerla's Eiche is classified as a doppelbock, the use of smoked malt renders it a bit idiosyncratic for the style. While it's intensely smoky, it's not too much, once one takes a couple sips and gets acclimated.","axeman9182","Aug 10, 2012"

The smoked aspect compliments the standard doppelbock aromas nicely. Taste of caramel, molasses, raisin, smoke, wood, ham, toffee, biscuit, pepper, light citrus, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of smoke, caramel, molasses, biscuit, and fruitiness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of flavors, with more standard doppelbock flavors going on; without the smokiness becoming too overwhelming. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a nice creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all. Dangerously smooth to drink for 8%, but is definitely great to sip on. Overall this is an excellent and highly enjoyable smoked doppelbock.

The taste continue the theme of the smell, with a real smoke laden flavor backed by good deal of sweetness. The hops were there in the finish, but only provided a restrained drying note, instead of an overt bitterness. The sticky and smooth feel on the palette and a drawn out smoky finish that ended each sip were both very classy. The smoked malts seem to do very well in a Dopplebock style. Now please brew a Trippelbock like Samichlaus with these.","rajendra82","Feb 20, 2012"

Very exciting -- 16.9 oz bottle. As soon as I crack it the smell is unmistakably smoke, just like smoked gouda. Flavor is dead on as well. Slightly sweet, not too bitter. The way the beer falls into the glass it looks over carbonated (big bubbles, no head) but in the mouth it's just right. Very smooth -- the smoke flavor is not at all tiring or abrasive, and while it does have some lagery qualities, I never would have guessed this is a doppelbock or the associated alcohol content. Alas the beer doesn't have much else going for it, and maybe it's a little gimmicky. But what there is is amazing.","hreb","Feb 03, 2012"

Aroma is smooth and mellow, but strong and meaty. Lovely notes of sweet barbecue char, fruity kalamata olive, rich oaken vanilla, maple leaves, and apple hum a rich, enticing, autumnal harmony. Smooth on the tongue as well, with a smoke flavor that's sweet, rich, and dominant but not overpowering, allowing pleasantly rich fruit and caramel flavors in along with a nice slap of bitter green noble hops. The mouthfeel falls a bit short, with a pleasant tingle but a lack of body that doesn't carry the flavor and allows the raw alcohol flavor to intrude. Quite a nice beer, though, and one I'd love to try with cheese or chocolate.","soulgrowl","Jan 05, 2012"

Smoke is direct, and of greater intensity than the nose but doesn't stay on the palate for long. Smoke reappears in the finish, and there only a slight unpleasant bitterness/dryness that sets this back from perfection. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, carbonation is a magnificent medium low. Wow.

The mouthfeel is a a full body and heavy beer like most rauchbeirs. There is light carbonation. There is also a slight hint of alcohol, but it does weigh in at 8% abv. Overall, this rauchbeir is probably at the top of my list of rauchbeirs. I can only drink one or 2 of these bottles and then feel full.

4.32,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"As with anything from Schlenkerla, this is akin to drinking a burning log. However, it's not as smoky as other beer from this brewery: the urbock is zillions of times smokier and, for that matter, hammier. Nonetheless, this one has plenty of smoke. There's no ham, however, so I guess that makes it... kosher? Quite tasty and rather low-key for a dopplebock: it doesn't have the boozy, malty smack that most others in this style have. That's a plus in my book, because it's that overtly alcoholic tinge that steers me away from most dopplebocks. If you're a fan of Schlenkerla, you must try this.

Tasted of wood and smoke as well as bacon but not as intense as the smell. a slight sweetness marries with the smoke perfectly and goes beautifully with food (smoked German Sausage in this lucky mans case!)

I like this beer and it is a very enjoyable after dinner sipper for me and it is a sipper - chug this only if you want to be ill. Just slightly disappointed only in that while a medium body and I can pick out some sweet malt tastes and a touch of hoppy bitterness, this is mostly a smoke beer. Nothing wrong with that - just that this is not close to a 50/50 balance of rauch/dopple...the smokiness is clearly more dominant. If you love smoke beers with a touch of lingering sweetness then this is yours, but beware if you think you're getting a slightly smoked dopplebock. Perhaps my hope for the latter leads to my review being less than a solid A-, as I like smoke beers and in that case this is another top notch Aecht brew. That being said, a sturdy, fuller-bodied beer that is exceptionally smooth thanks to oak and has a touch of woodiness in it. Smooths as it warms and the longer you sip on it your tongue adjusts to dry smokiness and caramel, toffee, sticky malts and some minor hop flavors come through behind smoke.","clayrock81","Mar 24, 2011"

It's a great mix of wood smoke and rich malt. the smoke is intense, something between a smoked ham and a smoldering campfire. The malt is folded in behind the smoke, but still quite prominent. As for the taste, it's a sweet, malty, dopplebock for sure. The smoke comes forth in the taste as a remarkable spiciness. Firm body, and very drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer.","Suds","Beers"

This is much more spicy and intense with an incense like quality of pine and licorice that does strange things on the palate when it hits the sweet toffee malt.

The flavor has a bit of dryer smoke that has a slightly soured finish to it. The flavors are caramel like in nature beyond the smoke, but it's mostly smoke. The mouthfeel is a little on the acidic side, drinkability depended for me, it was hard to drink just by itself, but when paired with grilled foods it was wonderful. So I leave it at that.

3.21,-20.3,4.5,3.5,3,3,3,"The taste is similar in terms of what the smoke does. Here I can get a bit of the smoked oak, though I can't say it really adds a positive dimension. The underlying doppelbock is completely gone and I don't get anything that would indicate this was the base. The taste brings a bit too much tannin and is overwhelmingly smokey. I suppose it's not that the level of smoke is bad, it's just that there's really nothing else there. A bit of an astringent, bitter finish. Really not a fan of this though I could see how one could enjoy it. My least favorite Schlenkerla beer to date.","Thorpe429","Jan 17, 2011"

The flavor on it is also very good, though it kind of draws back the smokiness a little (still pretty smokey). No ashiness is noted, which is good because ashy flavor is a deal-breaker for me in smoked beers. Underlying dopplebock is pretty clean, though I might be looking for a bit more sweetness for a maple-smoked bacon profile, as of now it's just smoked bacon with a touch of herbal bitterness and maybe some bready malt underneath. Moderate mouthfeel, a bit prickly. Great drinkability, well-disguised alcohol. Love these Schlenkerla beers, superb.","LordAdmNelson","Jan 16, 2011"

It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't bad, but it also wasn't that great. All I have to say is, pulled pork, really!?!?

Herbal bitterness from some delicious noble hops are a nice foil to the malty sweetness, and they go surprisingly well with the layered smokiness.

There is just a tad of hop bitterness, and a wonderful smoke that tempers the malty sweetness. This is wonderful beer, whether you call it a rauchbier or a smokey dopplebock.

My nose is inundated with what I can only call a mixture of a coastal breeze (ocean coast, that is) and the smoke billowing from a coniferous forest. So...downwind from a fire in a forest around Puget Sound? Something like that. Some light honey and caramel sit in the back row, no raised hands and grades in jeopardy. The taste has the usual blackened pork chop flavor that I've come to enjoy from Schlenkerla, but it's a bit more subdued than usual. The honey and caramel put forth a stronger effort (the parents were threatening to take away their cars if they fail another class), joined by maple syrup and straight oak. Despite the relative drop in smoke content, this is a decidedly tasty brew, and the weaker smoke acts as more of a compliment to the other flavors, rather than its usual role as lead. The body is a wavy medium, with a light carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, this brew was worth the wait, continued proof that some of the best rauchs continue to come from their homeland. In my opinion, had they upped the smoke a very tiny bit and the body were just a bit more assertive (only word I could come up with to describe my feelings), this might be my favorite rauch ever. Instead, only top 5. Shame, really...","TMoney2591","Dec 02, 2010"

The aroma is smokey, which is no revelation here, but underneath this I could pick up some subtleties of the underlying beer such as caramel malt and a crisp lager character. The flavor is much the same, the smoke dominates at first, but a doppelbock lies beneath it with a moderately malty backbone and crisp finish. Medium bodied and surprisingly bubbly as well.

There is still a good amount of burnt smokey malt flavor but the use of oak instead of beechwood results in a much smoother, less extreme smoke flavor. Still, there is plenty of smoked malt, barbecued bacon, butane and burnt wood in this incredibly complex beer. In addition, there is a lactic creaminess and a noticeable earthy wood presence, likely from the oak. Also, there is a slick, buttery white wine taste that was a complete shock to me. It added another level of complexity to this incredible beer. The only other beer I've tasted this flavor in is Allagash Vagabond and this element of Eiche reminds me of that beer.
