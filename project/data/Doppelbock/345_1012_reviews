"O: as I read the style description, this one fits on that dark end, tending towards stout. There isn't much bitterness in the flavor, but the beer does balance out better in the end."

"O-I've wanted to try this beer for some time. It turned out to be a tasty beer. This is one I would like to reexamine at some point."
""
""
""

"Color is a deep brown with a slightly earthy sweet smell. The taste is a sweet raisin and toasted malt rich flavor, with traces of citrus behind the two main flavors and a nice heavy but smooth finish"

"Deep red in color with orange hues and perfect clarity. Poured with a rich, off-white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap that left a thick ring and sheets of sticky lacings around the edge of the glass. Smoked and dark grain aromas with sweet fruit fruit in the background. Medium bodied, slighty syrupy feel at first, followed by tight, slightly aggressive carbonation. Dark and slighly charred malt flavors up front followed by chocolate malt with dark fruit flavors beneath. Herbal hop bitterness toward the end followed by smoky, tobacco-like flavors and sweetripe fruit. Fabulous flavors and aromas make this an amazing dopplebock."
"Overall: Absolutely delicious and perfect for this never ending winter. What a doppelbock should be!"
""

"O-a solid doppelbock, nice flavor and very pleasant to sip"
"A great Doppelbock that would probably have greater recognition if it made it to more markets."
"The flavors are right-on for a good Doppelbock, but the extra bitterness kind of kills it for me."

"This was an excellent presentation of the style, very flavorful and easy to drink. I will have to add this to one of my favorites from Vicotry."

"I stand by my German brewers with making my favorite Dopplebocks--Aventinus, Celebrator, Optimator. But, Victory did really well here. I would absolutely buy this again. A well-made example."

"Ouch - I did not like this one. While Victory is one of my favorite breweries, this flavor didn't cut it for me. My guess is that Dopplebock is not a blend I should frequent. Just too much of a dry, brown, stouty kind of beer for me that I found boring and non-tasty. Seem's Dopplebock fans may like this one, so don't let my review keep you from this one if you are a Dopplebock fan."

"O - very delicious beer, another enjoyable brew from my favorite brewing company"

"Morey's Bottom Line: Another solid (albeit lesser known) beer from Victory. This is a really good beer. I've had quite a few Double Bocks, and this one is up there with some of the better ones."
"Overall pretty solid and enjoyable, but lacking in body and fullness in the feel otherwise."
"Poured a chestnut color with amber hues with a sparsely lacing white head. Aroma of sweet caramel malts, roasted nuts, toffee. Slightly sweet in the taste with caramel and toffee, subtle tones of raisin, nutty, bready, grassy, with a somewhat bitter finish/aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, moderately carbonated, and pretty easily drinkable."
"Poured into glass briskly to create a nice rocky off-white head that lasts awhile and fades to cover an bright amber brew with decent lacing. Dark bread, melanoidin malty aroma true to bock character. Brisk flavors of malt greet the palate with light bitterness to balance fades with roast grains. Finishes with bitter/sweet smoothness medium to full body, creamy texture, and an almost lively carbonation. Well worth a taste again. Enjoyed!"
"A nicely done doppelbock, very malty and flavorful, well worth picking up if you get the chance."
"O- This is a really good beer, and I am very happy I picked it up. I am very impressed by the complexity, can't wait to get more."
"In spite of the abv, I enjoyed several of these - sweet, but not overly so. A nice sessionable brew."
"Wow, very creamy and tasty. This is a tremendous dopplebock. Very sessionable and case worthy."
"A - I like it well-enough but the grape sweetness/kool-aid isn't my cup of tea for this style. I'd rather have a hearty, toasted spicy-bready flavor for my doppelbock."
"A little bit all over the place, some high points, some lows as well."
"Overall, this isn't my favorite from Victory, but it feels old school and for that I respect it. Also not my favorite style admittedly, but other doppelbocks that I've had are not like this. Definitely one to try for those of you into the style. You won't regret its uniqueness."
"Overall: EXTREMELY tasty! Complexity of aroma, substantial body, maltiness w/ balance, and it begs you to have another sip. Definitely one of my new favorites. Thanks for the trade, Curious Monk!"
"O - What a delicious beer. Lot's of malty goodness and pretty much everything I think a Doppelbock is supposed to be, and executed brilliantly."
"This Doppelbock pours out with a nice brown colored body. The head was a tan color that was kind of fizzy. The smell of the beer had some good malty aroma with some soft yeast on the nose. The taste of the beer is pretty good. There's a softness to the taste, the flavors are mostly sweet. The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Overall not a bad brew."
"Nice looking bock from Victory. Dark brown with shades of amber and a respectable foamy head. Smells of malty goodness. Palate is complex and robust, yet very traditional. Layers of bready malt flavor and a touch of fermented dark fruit are complimented by a clean German yeast that adds to the depth of flavor. Full bodied with a clean finish. Another wonderfully brewed German-style lager from PA."
"Overall: Great brew. I like this one a lot and enjoy pondering how it evolves throughout the drink. I should make a point to pick up more of these before they are gone."
"Overall this is a great beer and a solid doppelbock. I will defiantly be on the look out for this one again and I would recommend it for anyone who loves doppelbocks & German beers."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and subtle sweet alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Wow! Where did all of that flavor come from!? Based on the aroma I would have not expected there to be much going on in this one. It was definitely a pleasant surprise when I took my first sip. The flavor is really as that saved this one for me as the aroma was VERY weak in intensity. Worth trying for the flavor but that is about it."
"I'm not sure where BA got the abv fjgure of 8.5% as the Victory web site lists the abv for this beer at 7.6%, but in either case it is hidden very well and makes this a very enjoyable brew."
"D: A little too sweet for me - definitely a nice change of pace, though."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty caramel and a small presence of alcohol. In the taste, caramel, roasted malt, with a small presence of earth and hops. A small hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small sticky caramel like aftertaste. Big caramel and a bit sticky sweet, small boozyness and a nice mellow hop."
"D - there really is no reason to skip over this one, highly recommended and a nice surprise"
"Overall: This is a solid and filling beer, but the weight and the higher ABV would help me limit it a little bit, and I likely wouldn't drink more than 2 of these on any given night; a simple beer that has been done very well."
"O - This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down smooth and has nice flavor. I could drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall, I thought this was a good beer, but not one of the best of the style that I've had so far. I enjoyed it though, and I'd drink it again."
"St.Victorious pours a deep, clear maroon. Plentiful cherry highlights shine through when the beer is backlit though. The ivory head rises to about 2.5 fingers in height, before slowing collapsing down the side of the glass. Not much is left in the way of lacing though. The nose doesn't quite hit all the marks of a great doppel, but it's still pretty good. It's an almost even blend of milk chocolate and plummy dark fruits. On my palate the beer gains a slight nuttiness, but at the expense of that creamy milk chocolate from the nose morphing into a more bitter, roasted dark chocolate (which doesn't really work for me int he context of the style). The flavor's also a touch weak and watered down. The carbonation is spot on, enough to cut through the malt, while simultaneously remaining in the background and letting those malts take center stage. The body though is way thin for the style. When I'm expecting a big malt bomb of a beer, there's a certain richness to the body that should come along here, and this beer doesn't even come close to that. I've enjoyed most of the other offerings from Victory that I've had, but St. Victorious ranks as a fairly disappointing doppelbock for me."
"This pours crystal clear brown, very slight lacing, the smell is brown sugar, but a lot of malt in the smell and flavor as well. It is a nice German style flavor, great malt flavor, really good. There is a lot of sweetness, but for the ABV, there is a decent balance to this. It is maybe a little syrupy, but the medium-heavy body is actually pretty tolerable."
"This one seems different from the authentic Dopplers you see from Deutchland but I think they've done a great job of keeping the flavor but giving it a unique twist. Well made and very enjoyable for me. Among my favorites of the style."
"A dark amber/golden red. No head with minimal lacing. A lot of booze and caramel. Dark fruits some dates. A faint hint of bakers chocolate. Roasted malts a lot of toasted caramel malts/roasted and dried out fruits raisins and dates. A sweet and smooth caramel finish.Dry and faintly tangy but it has a sweet backing."
"St. Victorious pours with a dark golden color, with little head. The smell is of roasted malts and bread. The taste follows suit, with a slightly sweet, malty flavor. Maybe a little tartness folowing the sweetness. This beer has a pleasantly heavy, bready feel. There's a nice warming feeling as it goes down, no doubt the alcohol. I really like this seasonal from Victory. Good stuff."
"Overall, this was definitely a nice little bock. I could have drank this one all night and it just seemed to be really well done. For fans of the style, this was definitely a good choice. I would have to recommend this one to anyone who likes a good dark German beer."
"Well carbonated and medium bodied. A little warming, but normal for the style. I thought this was a rock solid American take on the style."
"Overall impression: this one really hit me out of the blue. Sometimes buying a single is a good idea; this is not one of those times - wish I had another."
"A-3.5, S-3, T-3.5, M-3, D-3.5"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate, but sharp. It's crisp and clean in the finish, making for a pretty easy drinking beer. Drinkability was good, I enjoyed the flavors a lot. A good version of the style, and a good beer overall."
"D- 8.5%? Where?"
"Pours a deep ruby red with a beautiful creamy head. The head is dense and doesn't diminish. Smells a bit rich and malty, booze, sweet and yet tart cherries. Chocolate is predominately upfront and is the first notable flavor. This is followed by some sweet and tart cherries. Hops are barely noticeable, but the finish is a bit dry. Thick rich chewy malts, chocolate, and a light tart cherry are the most notable flavors."
"St. Victorious is a really impressive release from Victory Brewing Company. It's an excellent take on the Doppelbock style, and could easily be confused with an authentic German Doppelbock. It has a ton of flavor and really delivers in just about every way. I wouldn't mind a little more body, but I can't complain. Excellent stuff! Seek it out."
"Revisiting this one due to pleasant memories from back East. It pours a clear ruby garnet topped by a half-finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises rye bread, wheat, light cocoa, and light maple syrup. The rye really brings a good amount of breadiness to the aroma. The taste follows the nose pretty closely, with a mild touch of roasted malts thrown in to compliment the aforementioned rye breadiness. The cocoa has morphed into some slightly bitter dark chocolate as well, creating a light coffee flavor in the back. It all comes together rather nicely. The body is a svelte medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice d-bock. 'Nuff said."
"D - Quite drinkable. Tasty, and interesting, and not preventative in any way."
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner. Caramel brow, creamy head with great retention. Smell burned caramel, roasted barley and some floral notes from hops. Taste sweet and malty up front, caramel, vanilla, the roasted barley showing through and merging with a nice bitterness in the finish. Incredibly drinkable for the alcohol, a great beer."
"On-tap at Busy Bee served in a tulip glass a deep crisp amber with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is burnt caramel malts and a hint of alcohol. The taste is caramel malts and dried fruits in front of Earthy hops giving way to a lingering dried fruit finish. The beer is medium bodied with mild alcohol presence. This is a unique and enjoyable Dopplebock, one I could certainly see myself ordering again."
"again, this is probably the best US made dopplebock i've had. i keep seeing people mentioning Troeggenator dopplebock....the troegs' bock is good, but it just doesn't have the same german character that this one does. well done."
"Drinkability: Alcohol hidden well, could definitely have more than one in a sitting. Not something you are going to polish off 4-5 in one go, but that's not the idea."
"D: I have had a few Victory beers and I have LOVED them, this did not fail me. Wonderful brew and if you love Dopplebocks, treat yourself and give this feast a try. The alcohol is well-hidden and the delightful PA made-German style beer will warm your spirit."
"A decent example at best."
"There's something holding me back from really enjoying this beer, but I definitely respect it."
"Deep mahogany colored with a low head of light brown foam. Low aroma of lightly roasted malt and marshmallow, some nutty notes. Rich and complex flavors of cocoa and coffee, plus caramel and slight woody notes, some root beer, marshmallow. Full and even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, slight warming of the cheeks. Very tasty, great beer, and very drinkable despite the strength."
"St. Victorious has a lot of good things going for it. It has a complex mixture of wheat and dark fruit hints to it. However, I was quite disappointed that these tastes weren't balanced well with the alcohol."
"(To any beer or doppelbock newcomer who may be reading this to decide on which doppelbock to try first, I highly recommend trying Troegenator by Tröegs Brewing Co. first.)"
"DB- Flavorful but it is strong and a bit medicinal to me. It feels a bit out of balance and just doesn't drink smoothly in my personal opinion. Not bad but there are other style examples I would drink before this."
"From the bottle, the beer pours a brown, cloudy color with a thin to medium cap of foam. The appearance isn't bad, but isn't the beers strongest suit. The aroma is where the goodness begins. Sweet malty grains envelop the nostrils in waves. The malt and grain on the palate produce a moist and pleasing mouthfeel. Sweetness rises but is then replaced by dry bitter hops as the beer moves toward the back. The hops provide ample balance to the blast of malt. Neither the malt nor the hops becomes overwhelming, making this brew highly drinkable. The complexity of the malt is the real show here."
"Pours a deep dark brown cola like color that is clear with a slight tan head which gives way to ver little lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt, chocolate, and dark fruits. The taste has a caramel and breadiness back bone with hints of the dark fruits and a slight chocolate flavor. The mouthfeel is medium carbonation. The drinkability is good it is complex enough to keep your interest and an easy enough drink to not deter you. The alochol is very well hidden as well."
"This is my fourth one out of a six pack (over a few days!) and the BA guys have their reviews right on the mark. Dark, raisin, chocolate with a hint of sweetness. Extremely drinkable (fantastic with zah) and a great malty head. I feel it, but I'm having a hard time figuring out where the alcohol is. Wow, I'm going to have to get another 6'er of these."
"d- I was very surprised by this beer. Not my typical brew but I really enjoyed it. I don't know that i'd love 2 in a row but this one was really good."
"Overall - A decent doppelbock, but not the greatest. I think more time in the bottle will allow it to balance some of the harsher alcoholic notes out and let the malt sing."
"Pours a mahogany brown with nice clarity and a thin tan head that doesn't stick around. The aroma is deeply malty and authentic, with notes of molasses and turbinado sugar, multigrain bread, slight smoke, herbal hops and alcohol. The flavor is similar with sugary malt upfront (notes of caramel, molasses, turbinado sugar) along with some toasted bread, dark fruits, herbal hops, a hint of smoke and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth and drinkability is very good. Very tasty American dopplebock, certainly one of the best domestic interpretations."
"D: A big, potent doppelbock to put down all night; in fact, you're better off sampling and moving on. The sweetness might be enough to deter novice palates not acclimated to the rich, lager style. Otherwise, I can't complain too much, save perhaps its balance and compromised hop balance."
"Strength makes it hard to drink a lot of it, but what you do drink goes down easily and enjoyably. Very good and would definitely have again."
"12oz bottle poured into dimple glass. Pours a slightly hazy, medium amber-brown color; khaki-colored head with patchy lacing. Pleasant nougat and chewy caramel in the aroma, with a hint of lively citrus and some dried red fruits; very clean and generous without being sticky. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: there's definitely a bit of viscosity upfront, but not to the tune of 8.5%; plenty of dried red fruits, caramel, and toffee; resists being too weighty and forward, opting instead for a clean yeast character and a surprising level of drinkability; well-made and tasty. Medium, doughy and bready malt finish; some lingering caramel and a touch of bitterness. Me likely alot!"
"Overall this was a good looking, great smelling beer with some very complex flavors. Only downfall was how filling it was, because I'd love to have had another right away."
"A fantastic example of the style from a consistently good brewery."
"Reveals.... Victory St. Victorious... Wow.. Dopplebock? Really? This shocks me. I guess it makes some sense, but I'm still shocked."
"Overall this beer is quite drinkable, maybe a but too much so for the ABV. One of my favorites from Victory."
"Drinkability: A pretty decent doppelbock. Certainly not as good as its German incarnations but a decent interpretation. I'd certainly have it again."
"Definitely worth drinking"
"Overall exactly what you expect from a nice Doppelbock."
"Drinkability: A good doppelbock. Not quite as good as the ""real"" German ones, but a good, faithful interpreation."
"D - A real enjoyable beer. Would recommend to drink it during the late summer through the fall."
"Final Thought: Remarkably modest in it's presentation, this beer knocks your socks off!"
"D - decent beer. Fairly drinkable dispite it's high abv. Paired very nicely with some pizza."
"D--High ABV, so this is one I would probably sip on more than anything else. Great for the style and nice in terms of price."
"Rediscovering how tasty and delightful Victory's version of a doppelbock is. I can see grabbing a sixer of this."
"D-Two of these is really no problem. A great full bodied lager for the spring time. Despite the 8% ABV, there really isn't much evidence of alcohol in the taste or mouthfeel. I plan on picking up a case of this every spring while I'm in PA."
"Thought this was going to be decent, but after a while I really couldn't find enough good stuff to redeem the big booze & flat malts in this one. Very unbalanced, not into it. I'd give it another chance, but this was not a great experience."
"overall: pretty good brew from victory nothing really outstanding but I do like it."
"Pours a nice medium brown color, with a decent light brown head. Nice malty aroma, with burnt brown sugar, caramel and toffee. Toasty malt flavors, along with raisins, toffee and caramel. A very nice beer, with a bit of warming alcohol on the finish. One I could drink quite a few of."
"Bottle: Poured a medium brown color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of caramel malt and light toffee is enjoyable though not necessarily what I was expecting from a doppelbock. Taste is also dominated by sweet caramel malt notes with light toffee notes as well. Some notes of banana bread would have complemented well this beer. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well done though lacking usual ester."
"D-Overall, this was a good beer. My expectations were probably higher than my experience, but good overall."
"drinkability - it wasnt the best beer i tried at DLD but it hit the spot on that cool cloudy day"
"D - easy drinking, a fine example of the style."
"A very enjoyable, malty but with a hop touch - traditional-style doppelbock. Easy to drink despite alcohol warmth and overall richness. Complex maltiness with a hop touch in the finish....Well done!"
"Drinkability: Very good and complex for the style. A nice bitter aspect. I could have a couple. One of Victory's better brews."
"Drinkability this just reminds me why I love doppelbocks I could sit here all day and drink this absolutely wonderful brew no hint whatsoever of 8.5% and the fact that two or three and I'd be on the floor."
"Pours a wonderful light brown color with a small off white head that disappears very quickly. Malt forward to the nose right away, a gentle sweetness and mild smokey note, some red apple, cherry and caramel as well. Very nice. A chewy malt bomb that does not cloy the throat, a very balanced sweetness that drinks so well for the style. Victory does it right."
"Easily one of the best American-made Doppelbocks. Victory makes some excellent beer: German style with a twist. Here, it's the smokiness."
"Single from a mix-a-six pack. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark auburn color with orange highlights. Thin head, which is a bit of a letdown. Smell was malty and boozy. Taste was pretty decent, lots of malt flavor. The biggest gripe I have with this beer is the mouthfeel. Extremely sticky on the palate, and the alcohol profile is way too up front. Not a beer that I would want to have more than one of. An average beer, but not overly enjoyable to drink. The best-by date was 2011, and if I had a second bottle, I would try aging it. Just doesn't seem ready to drink now."
"Notes: Thanks to Bill for seeing that I was able to enjoy this great beer from Victory, a brewery with a nicely rounded lineup of beers."
"This beer is awesome. Dark red color with a malty aroma. The taste reveals raisins, toffee and plenty of malts. There is a slight hoppiness at the end. The 8.50% is very deceptive as this beer is extremely drinkable. This is one of the best American doppelbocks that I have ever had and I highly recommend it. Cheers!!"
"Drinkability: If it wasn't for a surprising 8.5% ABV, I would've proclaimed this brew sessionable."
"D: Very drinkable. The thinner mouthfeel and lack of a super-sweet taste makes this one go down pretty smoothly."
"D: Very good! I never prided myself on being a doppelbock fan, but this beer could have me looking for other beers of the same category."
"An interesting doppelbock, definitely more dark fruit forward than malt forward. Didn't really care for it, the winey notes and dark fruits was pretty intense, i'd prefer more of a bready profile."
"Na Zdravje!"
"The beer poured a translucent amber with a dab of offwhite lace. The aroma was of rich caramel malt. The taste was of caramel malt with a bit of alcohol burn and a medicinal finish. The feel was medium and wet. This was a pleasant enough beer, just nothing that really made it stand out from the pack."
"D: I am enjoying sipping on this beer while watching a movie, but I could see putting a few of these back and regretting it. The alcohol is hidden very well so beware. Almost the same experience as with Troeganator, but I find this beer has so much more complexity to offer. Well worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is medium, goes down well, and is very drinkable for the ABV."
"D: I'm having this on a cold winter's evening as snow, sleet, and freezing rain pound on the window. Aside from a roaring fire, I can't think of anything else I'd rather have right now."
"Very nice. Not a very complex beer - Good rich malt with some booze-soaked fruit, some brown sweet bread. Nice malty finish. Decent, but not one that sets itself from the pack of German versions, or even some domestics. The carbonation in this one keeps it drinkable, and in some way masks some limitations. Overall, I'd have this again, but it wouldn't be the first I'd reach for when I have an itch to drink this style."
"Beer pours a dark amber with a thick creamy head, looks like a milkshake almost. Malt is the first smell to come to mind, has a break like quality to it. Taste is also malty with some caramel with a slight bitter aftertaste. Carbonation seems to appear at the end. Alcohol is not overpowering at all, hard to tell it is over 8%ABV. Feels very thick in the mouth and has a little burnt flavor to it that is nice. Overall a really good beer from Victory and one I would definitely buy again."
"So it isn't the type of doppelbock I'm accustomed to, but that shouldn't stop anyone from trying this beer. It's a drier, more drinkable example, and well worth the purchase."
"Overall Impression: This is a damn good beer! This is the only style of Lager that I really like and it didn't disappoint! That said, this beer is worth looking for."
"D- a bit TOO drinkable, i had 3 just to get the feel of this one & could easily have 3 more before realizing not only was driving a prob. but walking would be difficult as well, def. doesn't drink like a 8.5% ABV brew, a great take on the style from an Am. brewery"
"The complexity of the malts makes for an interesting and tasty beer, and one I'd happily drink more than one of in a sitting."
"A very drinkable beer, almost scary considering the alcohol content. A slight sweetness in the aftertaste, balanced nicely by the subtle hops at the end."
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"D: Well blended, nice representation of the style. I could enjoy another pint or two of this beer."
"D-very tasty and right on spot for a doppelbock. I keep liking this style more and more b/c it is so smooth with great earthy malts and a nice level of sweetness. fantastic rendition of the style!"
"Smells of plums, chocolate, coffee, cocoa, you name it. Not much lacing down the glass. Kinda odd for a doppelbock, in the fact that, it is quite ""smokey"". I like that, however, and it is quite delicious. As high a quality American-made German-style beer you will find. Very creamy and smooth, way too drinkable for the abv, kinda scary. Medium bodied and pours a redish, black color. Very nice beer, glad I have a case of it."
"Poured into a pint glass. I got no head when I poured this brew, just a thin filmed ring that slowly disappeared. No lacing what so ever. Very strong malty aroma with hints of alcohol. Clear rich mahogany color. Liquid seems to cling for a while to the glass. Small carbonation bubbles and the slight burn of alcohol plays on the tongue. Sweet and malty to start with a slight bitter finish. It is mighty flavorful."
"1208"
"D- I could polish off a few of these in a sitting, easily. Very enjoyable. Would purchase again."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It is deep caramel in color with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet, and bready. The beeer is malt forward, sweet and filling. Full bodied and filling. A solid offering, but a notch below others of the style."
"Amber colored beer with a quickly fading head.Aroma is mostly caramel with subtle fruits.Taste is also caramel with some bread and fruit.Overall a decent beer that is nothing spectacular but something that you would probably buy more than just once!!"
"2010 is a great year for St. Victorious. Love the balance and nice hop finish. Had on tap at victory, pours a nice rich amber color with a tan head. The taste is complex with a clean soft finish. Like a good German lager the smell is very clean. Best version of St. V in a long time."
"Might be too drinkable for the ABV - damn those great brewers at Victory."
"Pours a ruby, purply brown color, very clear, minimal head and lacing. Somewhat true to style, the nose is rich malt, yet not as sweet as some doppelbocks. Taste follows scent, pretty much rich bready and nutty malts (but not as rich as it could be), but a dark berry taste lingers in the the background. Nice medium body on this, decent carbonation level after the lack of head. A good beer with some nice flavors to it but lacks complexity and punch i get from other beers of the style."
"Super-enjoyable, very much on the desserty side of things. Chalk St. Victorious up as another victory for Victory."
"I have a feeling this six pack I bought is very old. I've walked past this numerous times in the aisle all in about a year. I don't know if this was shaken about or just fizzed out. Still it did impress me if you do want a great tasting lager excuse me doppelbock this is a malt lover's dream."
"Good stuff but certainly not the brewery's best offering..."
"D-The beer isn't hot but it doesn't hide its alcohol either. between that and the body of the beer it would be hard to drink many of these, but one was perfect for tonight."
"amber brown color, smallish head. smells of caramel malty goodness. similar palate plus black cherry and a trace of spicy hops. pleasant levels of sweetness and carbonation. slightly thinner body than expected. surprisingly refreshing and extremely drinkable."
"D- i could throw this back in 10 min but i would feel it right away. You dont even know this bad boy is high in ABV."
"Pours a seethru brownish red with constant tan head from carbonation and slight lace patches. A biscuity and roasted malt smell along with caramel (and possibly butterscotch or something like that) with very minor bitter hops. Dry and bready are the first things that come to my mind as I sip this. Medium-to-full bodied, slightly smooth and chewey, has a drying effect that is complemented with some mild sweet caramel and bitter chocolate malt as well as the hops giving off some slight fruit flavors like grape. Sticky on the sides and also a bit of toffee tucked into the sweetness I notice as I drink this; smooth as it warms. ABV complements beer by giving it that strong streak w/o overpowering beer. A complex brew that is great to sip on."
"I'm still gaining my malt chops and this is definitely a step in the right direction. Complex but approachable flavor."
"D: A rather pleasant beer that I've gone too long since having."
"A little much for a warm spring day, but very nice on a cool spring night."
"A food note - don't pair with grains. They turn the beer sour."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a deep chestnut color with about an inch of lingering ecru foam. No lacing to speak of. The nose is filled with notes of sweet malt, chocolate, and fruits such as plums and figs. Tastes of bready caramelized malts/grain, very light touch of smoke and coffee, mild cocoa powder, and plums. Tasty stuff! Just about full bodied with medium carbonation and some warming alcohol. Take your time with this one and enjoy."
"D - Though the alcohol is masked, I just don't think this is that quaffable."
"single from Norm's, Vienna, VA - best by Dec 02, 2009"
"I haven't actually seen this for sale in MA, but it has caused me to try other dopplebocks that are available, like Troegs. If you can get your hands on it, pick it up, you won't be disappointed."
"D: A highly drinkable dopplebock which is widely available and great quality as everything Victory produces."
"I love dopplebocks, and this is another fine one on the market. Victory, I've always felt, does solid brews. A few really fine ones, and some solid session beers, but nothing bad. This is one of their finer outings, in my opinion. The high ABV (8.50%) is masked well in the flavor, but it kicks in fairly fast, letting you know it's there. Truly enjoyable."
"This is another great example from Victory!"
"Tiny tan head on initial pour that vanished almost instantly. Dark purple body lets a little light in. Lacing doesn't last long. Nose has lots of coffee and chocolate in it. Wow, very tasty, chocolate and coffee notes on the tongue with some alcohol heat. Great mouthfeel, carbonation is there and in force. Love this one, thanks to Adam (PEBKAC) for the brew."
"Drinkability: Very good drinkability but this is a beer for sipping and savoring so one a night is just right."
"Pours a very dark but transparent brown- obviously not bottle conditioned. Good carbonation with an off-white head that fades quickly. Smells sweet, maybe a little bready or something along those lines. Smell is also a little smokey perhaps? Taste is superb. Plenty of malts, plenty of substance, hints of smoke, some fruitiness, and a well balanced spice note. Mouthfeel is thick, exactly what I want and surpassing my expectations for the style. Very impressed with this offering- Victory does a great set of brews and this is one of my favorites. Too bad they refuse to distribute it here..."
"Medium body, carbonation on the lower side I'd say. I'd say this is drinkable, but I personally can't drink multiple sweet beers in a row, so when I finished this I didn't want a second. This was my first doppelbock and I didn't like it as much as I'd hoped. I'll try it again if I can."
"My first doppelbock and it didn't disappoint. Hopefully I can get a hold of more for comparison."
"Mouthfeel: Less carbonation which fits this style of beer. The beer rolls of the tongue wonderfully."
"Overall this isn't quite world-class, but it's one of the better U.S. micro-brewed doppelbocks I've had, if not THE best. Definitely worth a shot."
"D - It goes down fantastically well for the ABV. I'd have no problems having a few of these while relaxing with a book, or any other stationary activity. Also, considering the style, I'd say $10 is definitely a good price for a six pack, especially here in PA."
"D: Definitely a good beer to try. 8.5% ABV, but a really nice dessert beer."
"a very complex beer, it reminded me of a samilclaus.. but i actually preferred this over samiclaus"
"Drinkability: A real winner of a brew, IMO, and one of Victory's finest. The alcohol's up there, but it's well masked and made up for by a fine assortment of flavors and an absolutely fantastic mouthfeel. I might be picking up a sixer of this next winter - seems like an excellent malty ""go to"" winter brew."
"M/D - easy drinking light bodied beer. For me though, not one that I would reach to time after time, the spices in it keep me from enjoying more than one"
"d: A great American doppelbock from Victory. Loved this one."
"D. Warming and filling. Great for the cold winter months. Very strong but also very welcome. Solid brew from Victory here."
"Very smooth feel that glides along the tongue with understated carbonation. The taste is full and malty. The sweetness held in check by a barely noticeable level of hops. Bready flavors come through in full force with a nutty undercurrent. Delicious even if it doesn't reach the height of complexity found in the best from Germany."
"I could have several of these."
"Medium bodied, with a nice and appropriate level of CO2 prickliness. Tasty. With the well-hidden ABV, I could definitely see myself drinking this a bit faster than it should be consumed."
"Overall mmm..."
"A good one from Victory but not my favorite one."
"This poured a clear, dark mahogany with tan head. It smelled like fresh barley and wheat with light lemon and copper hops. It tasted like lots of copper hops and roasted barley, with some lemon hops and bready yeast. It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was very much like an Oktoberfest but stronger. It hid the alcohol well, and had decent body. The flavor was good, but wasn't as sweet or complex as I was hoping. Perhaps a couple years of age might help that? If so, this could become a very enjoyable beer."
"I consider this beer a great Winter treat. I may purchase again. Would like to see it in a Victory variety pack."
"D - Despite it being boring to me, it has above average drinkability."
"The alcohol is not the limiting factor, its the feeling of rising blood sugar level."
"Very nice. Full flavored and chewey yet still smooth on the palette, this is a well done Doppelbock from Victory. I haven't visited this since having it in the bottle a couple of years ago, so this was a nice catch-up on a good beer."
"Pours a very dark amber/ chestnut brown color with thin tan head hthat settles into thin lace. Nice roasted chocolate, malty aroma. Roasted malty flavor that lasts throughout, with hints of chocolate, caramel, chestnut and licorice. Very well-balanced and quaffable with a bitter sweet dry hoppy finish."
"I like that they've stuck true to style and haven't skimped on one ounce of what makes dopplebocks so delicious: the malts! Victory certainly are victorious here. I could guzzle this down pint after pint and, fortunately or unfortunately, there seems to be no sign of the 8.5% here to stop me!"
"Drinkablity: World class! Really enjoyed the balanced approach to the style"
"HV"
"Pours clouded brown with a creme head. Thickly sweet. Malts are present, but the strong sweet flavor is what dominates. Kind of one-dimensional to me. Feel is decent on the body. Carbonation has a bit of a bite. Overall it seems a bit too cloying really. It's okay at best I guess."
"D - pretty solid despite the ABV. Goes down fairly smoothly. Could drink several."
"M/D - The sweetness lingers in your mouth, the carbonation is low, and the alcohol presence is low for such a high ABV beer. A great doppelbock."
"D: I could and have drank 3 or so of these in a sitting. Eventually the ABV catches up with you and your palate gets fatigued by a sweetness that tends to compound over time, but for a winter beer that's meant to be enjoyed on a cold, snowy night, this one is hard to beat. I've held 6 aside to enjoy next winter, so we'll see how these fare with age."
"M + D: Quite a lovely character... full bodied, rich. Not quite silky (a little on the heavy and/or slightly sticky side for that), but trying for it. A nicer feel for the style, and quite nicely done all around. This is a nice representation of the style by Victory, and I look forward to the other 4 bottles in this 6-pack!"
"Poured into a standard pint glass a hazed deep russet color with a tight 1/2 finger slight off white head that decent lasting power.Aromas of dark fruit ala raisin and prune along with some sweet caramel mainly,flavors were alot like the aromas heavy handed raisin and brown sugar with some caramel sweetness and a bit of a doughy element.A solid doppelbock very flavorful it is pretty big and warming."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability. A tad on the heavy side to be a session beer, but it is a nice rich, flavorful and malty doppelbock well worth trying, esepcially for an american version of this style."
"Clear and copper in color with a slight beige head. Sweet and smoky in smell. Also a slight odor of lemon or tartness. Very mellow in taste. A bit of the smokiness, but not overpowering. A good beer. Not a favorite style. Decent drinkability. Would like to try again to form more of an opinion."
"Overall: Not a bad brew, just not my cup of tea. This one has a solid malt character both in nose and taste. Being a hop guy I can probably not appreciate this as much as many. That being said, it's a pretty good beer, rather good for a doppelbock."
"Drinkability - an easy beer to sip and enjoy, and will definitely warm the spirit tonight."
"Flavors are sweet to begin, with caramel and toffee notes. Next are some stronger nutty flavors that end a little bitter. Just a hint of some bittering hops are noticeable. The alcohol warmth becomes noticeable after a few sips. This beer definitely leans more to the sweeter side. Towards the end I was ready for something less sweet but this did not take away from it being a great beer overall. Victory hit this style right on!"
"Pours an reddish amber color (which looked a little bit light to me for a doppelbock). Smell was of biscuity malt, with not a lot of hops coming through. Taste had a biscuity malt flavor, but it was relatively dry and not overly sweet. There was a distinct tanginess/spiciness to the beer that seems to come out in some dopplebocks that kept the beer from being too sweet. Not a lot of hops come through in the taste. A good beer that is worth trying if you come across it, but not my favorite of the style."
"This is a great version of an American dopplebock. Victory once again shows of their mastery of german malts."
"Md thick body and strong carbonation."
"D: The balance makes this much more drinkable than some versions of the style that can be overly sweet. At 7.6% the ABV is not too high to keep me from having a few especially here at home."
"St. Victorious pours a deep red brown with a fluffy off white head. The freshness dat reads ""enjoy by Jan 22, 08. The aroma is sweet caramel and toffee, with plenty of dark raisin fruitiness. The flavor is rich and malty, not quite as sweet as the aroma. There is more of a toasted character, nice and crisp. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable, especially considering the strength."
"Drinkability: It was nothing short of a great hoopy American doppelbock. Iwouldn't have thought that a hoppy doppelbock would be this good, but Victory sure changed my mind about that subject. Would I buy this one again? I would at a drop of a hat!"
"Deep brown with an off-white head. Aroma heavy on carmel and toffee notes. Smells almost like perfection, but just a little boozy. tatse is more dark carmel and toffee flavors with just a touch of dark chocolate. Really no roastiness, just creamy malt with a touch of bitterness to wrap things together on the finish. Mouthfeel is very thick and pleasing for a cold-weather beer. Drinkability is good, but the alcohol detracts from the experience just a bit. If it were a bit better disguised (or if I aged the beers a bit more) it would be exquisite."
"Pours a hazy orange brown, nice thick off white head forms, drops slowly leaving tons of lace, great retention, a very nice looking beer. Smell is sweet and malty, lots of toffee, iron, bread, yeast, some spices and dark fruits, very clean, very malty, nice. Taste is very rich, thick caramel, biscuits, raisins, bread, iron, fruits, brown sugar, nice and caramelized, good flavour, solidly balanced finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Not world class but a nicely done doppelbock, thanks Jay!"
"Heavy and earthy with moderate carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. The finish is full but crisp with a buttery lingering texture. The flavors and textures are all over the place but they still manage to tie together seamlessly; so complex. Probably the best Doppelbock I've ever had. Really an amazing beer."
"The taste does not quite live up to the rich promise of the aroma, but it certainly gives it a go. A thoroughly enjoyable beer that is fitting my current mood / needs just right."
"D: I'm not the biggest fan of dopplebocks (yet) but this one is easy to drink many of."
"An excellent example of a doppelbock. Another typically excellent beer from Victory."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. great malty base. really nice doppel."
"D - Hmm, not exactly what comes to mind when I think of a Dobbelbock. Almost tastes more like a Scotch Ale at times. Nevertheless, it is pretty drinkable considering the high ABV and slight alcoholic taste. Enjoy on a cold winter night with some hearty sausage or chili."
"fit the style well, but apparently just not really my style. i wouldnt decline an offer for this one, but i wouldn't seek it out either."
"D: awesome. very tasty. I bought a single. Next time a sixer."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a low carbonation, giving this a nice smooth creamy feel, and the drinkability is really good. If not for the high abv I would be able to have a few of these in a row."
"This would be a good D-bock if the smell could be rectified."
"Man, this is a very complex Doppelbock and all the different flavours are working very well together. 8.5%abv, eh? I know the style can get up there but it's very well hidden here. Once again, kudos to Wasatch for sending this one. It's a winner for sure."
"Reddish brown with initial substantial foamy head. A malt work of art. Malty aroma and dark lager complex taste. Numbing on the tongue, dark fruit and very tasty. Very smooth and well done. Satisying, though drying aftertaste. Beers of the World. Great representation of the style."
"Pours clear dark red amber with thin, light tan, bubbly head and lots of small bubbles moving up through the body. The smell is complex malt with light bread and slightly nutty aroma. The initial flavor is moderate sweet malt nicely balanced with hop bitterness that finishes a little acidic and moderately bitter with a little salty right at the end. Nice complex malt layering. The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied with slightly oily texture and lively carbonation. This is a tasty beer for cool evenings or an air-conditioned summer day. The complex flavor is interesting and well-balanced, and I would definitely purchase again."
"Pours amber with dark copper hues, clear, a small light tan head quickly fades away. Nice sugary maltiness in the aroma, sweet sugary, buttery caramel, some good cola sweetness and raisins, a little smokiness in the aroma as well as some grassiness. Somewhat peaty smokiness in the taste both up front and in the finish, a flash of the sweet sugary malts in the middle, followed by a decent sized grassy bitterness before moving to the somewhat smoky finish. Light to medium in body, mouthfeel is not overly heavy and the beer is not overly rich, a little stronger on the hops side than I expected from a doppel wit a decently dry and somewhat spicy finish, but this keeps it refreshing and the light to medium body makes it highly drinkable. The alcohol is barely evident. Very drinkable beer."
"D- I think this may be the best doppelbock I have had. It just feels like the perfect balance between sweetness yet still enough hops and the fruit flavor. Just a great beer."
"A well balanced, full flavored Doppelbock. Tremendous flavor profile; one of the best American Doppelbock's I've had to date."
"Pretty sweet and rich drink, perfect for winter. Easy to drink."
"Flavor is actually fairly simple. Heavy on the malts. Nice roasted character to it. Some toffee too. Picking out some fruits, particularly overripe cherries. A rather nice burn from the alcohol too. Pleasant and soothing actually. Heavy and full mouthfeel. It would coat the cheeks but the alcohol evaporates nciely and thins it out. Solid beer."
"Overall this is a fantastic brew. I will definitely have to seek it out next winter. It is smooth and delicious, unbelievably so considering the 8.5% ABV. This beer gives me something of a warm feeling, I can picture drinking it by a fire on a cold winter's night."
"D: This is a good beer and quite drinkable. However, I believe there are better examples of the style."
"This is a great dopplebock. There are many flavors in this, and it's not as thick as other DBs i've tried, which is good because I'd love to have another. Watch out though, at 8.5% ABV, it could catch up to yah if you're driving!"
"Deep brown in color with a slight head. Somewhat hazy. Low aroma-somewhat metallic and sharp. Malty enough flavor but has a real homebrew like wang to it. Somewhat nutty taste. Ok body. Overall I am not very impressed. I prefer the helles/maibock from Victory. Rather average for me to be honest"
"A solid brew that is too easy to drink. At 8.5% this could be really dangerous. Been wanting to try it for a while, I'd pick this up and drink it often if it was around."
"Scott"
"This is a fairly drinkable brew. I gave it a solid four because it is no doubt a nice brew, but I think it lacks complexity and would expect a bit more from a doppelbock from Victory."
"Pours a ruby brown, with a thin tan head. Decent retention, and lacing. Smell is of dark fruits,and malts. Body is medium,with carbionation. Taste is of sweet dark fruit,with a nice hop balance in the finish. The alchol is there big time. Good stuff."
"Flavor is brilliantly complex. Acidic, spiced, roasted coffee, raisins, grapes, and piny hops. Malt to spare. Another excellent beer from Victory."
"On-tap at the brewery. Dark mahogany with a small, creamy, off-white head that quickly diminishes to a faint film, and leaves light wisps of lacing. Smell is of super rich malts with some dark fruit, toffee a some light estery alcohol. Taste is wonderfully malty and complex. Fairly sweet but not cloying, as theres just enough hops to cancel some of it out on the finish. It has a medium-full body, creamy texture and soft carbonation. Another very good beer from Victory thats definitely worth trying."
"This was a nice treat. In the way of doppelbocks, it's a few notches above average. The pour was very nice, indeed, looking like something you'd see in an ad. A lovely red bronze colour with a voluminous, sticky sand coloured head that remained for several minutes. This looked great. Smell fairly average for the style with some caramelised sugar, very faint dark fruit hiding way in the back, some toasted grain; your average doppelbock. Taste was nice and flavourful without being too strong. Very enjoyable and almost thirst quenching. Quite a statement for a brew that's 8,5%, eh? There's a ""non-threatening", but certainly noticeable hop bitterness on the finish. I think that balances things out quite nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant, but nothing extraordinary. Considering the style and abv, I think the drinkability of this one is fantastic! My only regret is that I have but one. Many thanks to Aprilluvsbeer for tossing this in on a trade."
"Overall, a decent beer, but nothing too special. I'd go with Fort Collins' Rauchator over this any day."
"D: 8.5% is a bit high for a more than one beer, beer. its good a little strong in the alcohol not the best doppelbock, but good"
"This is a ok beer from a great brewery.Ive had the style before but none like this.I dont know if I would have this again."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a dark amber/brown with a reluctant head that materialized slowly after a stiff pour, but dissipated more quickly than I'd have liked. Not a terribly CO2riffic beer, and not particularly aromatic, but those are my only complaints. The malts in this beer are very complex. I taste molasses, roasted somethingorother, and a little tangy apple. Very drinkable for such a strong brew. Springtime is finally here!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Nose is medium strength, malty sweetness, some roasted scent, but fairly mild for a doppelbock. Taste is much better. Strong and sweet, with lots of spiciness. Some breadiness, Alcohol taste is almost non-existant, impressive given the fairly high ABV. Some interesting ESB-like saltiness, although not drying like in some ESBs. Also a lot of fruity goodness; maybe grapes or peaches or something that I can't quite put my finger on. A tasty doppelbock, although a little all over the place - great taste, but just okay smell and feel. Definitely one to try though, all around."
"D: Drinkable, but I really don't want to. Not one of the better doppels, IMO. I was really let down by this one. Normally, I like Victory beers better than this."
"Thanks for the bottle nlmartin!"
"The pour into my Mahr's Der Weisse Bock glass, not even terribly hard, raises a towering 1.5 inch head that settles visibly. It's a medium-light tan, and leaves virtually no lacing. Below, the body is a lovely deep ruby-brown. The nose is a bit acidic and malty, but not as much as expected. There's also a normal, grainy lager scent. The taste is sweet and malty, with an obvious alcoholic kick. Despite being a lager, it has a bit of a berry flavor to it. Even with the alcohol coming through as it does, the taste works for me. Not great, but good. The mouth is on the thick side, close to being syrupy, but in a good way. The carbonation is perfect. A workable DB, but not among Vic'ry's best."
"I would recommend pairing this with some smoked meats, dark greens and sweet potatoes on a cold evening."
"D: This is a good thick dopplebock. Good complex and well balanced flavor."
"D - A greatly drinkable lager for the substantial gravity. It is consumed best in limited quantities-a finesse beer with many strengths. Excellent for winter with warming qualities"
"Drinkability is good as there is nothing at all unpleasant about his brew, just not as impressive as the above mentioned."
"12oz. bottle poured a dark brownish red color with a thin slightly off white head that leaves a few specks of lace. Smell has some dark fruity notes along with a candy like sugar scent. Taste is very malty with some toasted and dark roasted flavors. The feel is light/medium with a slight tingle of carbonation. This is a pretty solid easy to drink brew and has a well hidden 8.5% ABV."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown/ruby color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tannish head, not much lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, and caramel. The taste is sweet/malty and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, the last three brew's I've had have been Doppelbock's, this is a very good beer, but nothing compared to the last two I've had, sorry Victory. Recommended though."
"Grainy malt with some caramel and dried fruits mixed in. Roast, toasty goodness with a nutty sweet finish. Full bodied and easy drinking. Well worth a few."
"D: In a word: tasty. This doppelbock is drinkable and well-balanced, certainly would be welcome again."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle the color of iced tea with a one finger brownish head that settles into a thick, creamy collar. Lively carbonation, but not overly fizzy. Aroma is of sweet, bready malt. Taste is sweet, bready, thick & almost chewy. Mouthfeel is quite substantial, almost stout-like. It compares closely to the Sam Adams Double Bock, but this beer has a quiet hop prescence in the background & on the finish that makes it much more balanced than the almost syrupy sweet SADB. The alcohol is much better hidden in the SVDB as well. All in all, one of my favorite beers from one of my favorite brewers! I've got to make the 30-minute drive to Downingtown to sample this on tap before they stop production for the season. Get it while you can!!!"
"First Victory beer I've had that I didn't feel was a great representation of the style. That's alright, 5 out of 6 so far is much better than most breweries."
"Would reccomend this one and would love to try again. Slightly burnt the roof of my mouth earlier, could have effected my taste a slight bit."
"Overall impression: Hmm.. this one is interesting - plenty going on here, but I'm not sure if I like the total package. Glad to have tried it though, and happy to see it on the shelves in Colorado, even if it is for a pretty steep price."
"I had heard plenty of good things about this one and as such was eager to try it, but I think it fell a bit flat. Nothing inherently wrong anywhere, just too bland and you have too reach too much to get anything out of the aroma. This is a slightly above average doppelbock that you might enjoy more than I did, but I can certainly think of plenty of others within the style that I'd rather sample again before this one..."
"Notes: It was very good and an interesting take on the style. Victory brewing is a kick ass brewery."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The carbonation seems to be a bit low but not problematic. The flavors ride a long time in my mouth. This is a dam tasty beer and I will look forward to drinking again."
"Drinks too easy, a nice dopple, not a great one. Lacks a few asthetics, but well worth seeking out, but a tad pricey @$11 a sixer (davidsons)"
"Pours a light amber with a nice pillow head with good lacing. Smell is light..mainly malt with a grassy undertone. Taste is roundly malty with a nice touch of hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy...light ""bite"" on the finish. Easy on the drinkabilty scale, especially considering the abv."
"12 oz. bottle, enjoy by Jan 22 08. Thanks for the enjoy by date! Dark amber in color, with some reddish edges. Thick foamy tan head, disappears quickly. Rich caramel and toffee aroma. This is all about the malt. A bit of fruit in there as well. Dark caramel, some dark ripe fruit, and very smooth. A good amount of sweetness, but enough earthy hops to balance well. This is so smooth, very easy to drink. Nice medium body with lower carbonation. Very nicely done."
"I'm not a big one for this style, but i'd call it drinkable. The 8.5% is hidden in the mouth but there is a nice warming characteristic on the way down."
"Poured a clear ruby/amber color with a thin kahki colored head that dies down not long after pour. Very little lace retention throughout tasting. Smell is malty and somewhat nutty with a hint of brown sugar. I'm normally a hophead, but boy does this have some amazing flavors. Delicious malty chocolate flavors with a subtle raisiny undertone. Lacking bitter/hoppy character, but that's ok with this brew...(I can't believe I said that). This beer becomes even more delicious as the temperature rises a bit. I can't believe how drinkable this is for an 8.5%...I'm still in shock. This may have sparked an interest in me to begin searching outside the ""hop-box"" into real bocks..."
"The rich malty body is nearly creamy. Call me crazy, but a flavor very reminiscent of Kaula is noticed."
"Poured a deep reddish amber color with a thick inch high off white head. smelled malty and a little fruity, like oranges. tastes big on bready malt at first, next onto a sweet and sour, slightly dry finish. a little residual hop bitterness can be tasted in between sips. mouthfeel is smooth, not much carbonation in here. this one goes down easy, i can't even taste the rather high ABV, it's very well covered by the malt. this is the kind of beer that can get you in trouble, nice taste, no hints of alcohol, and a fairly high ABV. it's rather good none the less."
"The mouthfeel is so damned big and bold it would be hard to drink this vastly but a great beer nonetheless and worth trying anytime."
"The beer pours a ruby red/brown color with little head tospeak of. The aroma is good. It's full of burnt caramel and warm alcohol. It's rich with quite a bit of malty sweetness. The taste is good. It's smooth and full bodied with loads of malts and a nice sweet finish. It's low on CO2 which doesn't do the beer justice. I imagine it's much better than what I'm tasting right now. The mouthfeel is lacking. It goes down slow and seems a bit flat. This is a good tasting beer, but the carbonation issue needs to be addressed. Maybe I got a bad bottle."
"It is doppelbock o'clock...after a long day of tasting beers, this beer, which I had originally intended to try first, comes last. It poured a dark copper color. with a relatively large white head that quickly faded to a small white lace. Aroma had some nice toasted grains, and a definite honey presence to make things a bit sweeter. There was also the tiniest suggestion of fruit in there too, maybe rasberries. The honey came through nicely on the taste, with the fruit whispering its presence as well. What I liekd the most was that although the malt was there, it was not overpowering on the taste buds like some of the last doppelbocks I have tried. The body of this beer was thick and syrupy, not quite smooth per say, but not offensive on the palate. One or two would be perfect for me. This is probably the best I have tried of the style with the exception of Thomas Hooker's Liberator offering. An impressive beer to say the least."
"Clear, dark chestnut with more intense reddish highlights under illumination. The foam was light brown and didn't form an overly thick cap with a vigourous pour, but did exhibit short-lived lacing throughout. Malty aroma, lots of breadiness with some toffee and a hint of cocoa. Dried fruits (prunes and raisins) melded nicely with light alcohol. Mild bitterness made itself apparent at the back of the palate. Very malty, but not overly sweet. Notes of bread crust, toasted grain, and caramel on the malt side, with plum and raisin rounding out the fruitiness. Alcohol warmth and flavour became integrated in the finish. Medium bodied, actually lighter than I expected, with carbonation that started crisp yet quickly became creamy. Good texture with just a little dryness. I really liked this - very malty without the cloying sweetness that can appear. Too bad it's only a seasonal, but at least I can get it."
"App - 3, Smell - 3, Taste -3.5 , Mouth - 3, Drink - 4"
"Drinkability: I found this very easy to drink. There's nothing harsh about it, and nothing unpleasant. The carbonation is a little heavy, but that's all that keeps it from being perfect."
"($10.99 / 6-pack)"
"Drinkability: Ohhh! This beer is quite good! Definitely worth a try."
"The mouthfeel is medium to heavy and exerts its tanginess as it warms up. Excellent beer here."
"Drinkability: St. Victorious is a very nice sipper. Malty sweet with dark fruits, chocolate, and brown sugar with a nice roasty malt finish. Alcohol is well hidden in the flavor profile but you can feel its warming effects. A great beer to sip next to a fire on cold night. A really nice dopplebock and one I will definitely buy again. Another fine beer from the folks at Victory. Highly recommended."
"St. Victorious is a delicious doppelbock and is another in a long line of beautiful brews to come out of Downington. 'V' is for Victory, 'V' is for Victorious and 'V' is for Very Good. Anyone even remotely interested in the doppelbock style owes it to themselves to find a bottle (or better yet, a case) of this triumphant beer."
"Thank you so much for letting me lock my lips on this beauty MuenchenerKindle! This was not only a truly delicious doppelbock, but also very unlike other doppelbocks I've ever had. There were notes of celebrator in it (a compliment indeed), but it definately went its own direction."
"Pretty typical doppelbock appearance: thick, murky brown with a minimum of head. I've come to associate this kind of look with spicy notes of alcohol, but I don't get any from St. Victorious. I do get the expected raisiny notes, but it's all pretty mellow. The taste, however, explodes in your mouth, primarily with chocolate, which surprised me a bit. This beer really tastes great. As with the smell, the alcohol is laying very low. Expectedly gooey mouthfeel. I'm not a huge doppelbock fan, but this one is fantastic."
"D: Good, slow sipper, really nice characteristics that develop as one drinks."
"WOW thats a lot of malt! This beer pours a dark amber color with a strange haze in it. The smell is overpowering, and its simply all malt, no hops or spices. The taste is the same. In fact, if I didn't know any better I would have to say this is simply a malt beverage (although the 8.5% abv proves different). Pretty syrup-like consistancy as well, but the little bit of carbonation ensures that the taste doesn't get to old on the tongue."
"12 oz., best by 7/27/06, sampled 8/14 in a pilsner glass. It pours a clear dark mahogany with medium carbonation that rises slowly up to a thin, almost fizzy, yellowed head that leaves little lacing. It's fairly aromatic, with notes of molasses, sweet grains, rich dark malts, raisins, and perhaps dates. The flavor is rich, with a big molasses presence, sweet and dark malts, toasted or caramel malts, a mild spiciness, green hops, and a faint smoky taste. It is medium to thick with lively carbonation yet manages to remain quite smooth, leaving a medium finish. This is a big, hearty beer that is pretty easy to drink and tastes quite nice."
"Mouthfeel is nice with plenty of chewy malt character. Goes down quite easily and hits the spot. A tasty dopplebock to be had here from Victory. This is one that I'd like to have again sometime. Thanks to FoolCircle for the opportunity."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly tingly and sharp from the tiny carbonation and I suspect a hop I can't discern in either the aroma or taste. Mouthfeel is unfortunately a little weak and thin for style to my mind."
"The mouthfeel is a little heavy but certainly not beyond DB standards. A little too sweet for a session brew. This is certainly not the best DB available but a worthy domestic representation of the style."
"12 ounce bottle. Enjoy by Jul 27, 06. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"Drinkability - Definately worth drinking, but this is not a beer to enjoy with friends on a casual occasion (I think its more sophisticated than that)."
"Goes down smooth with little aftertaste. This is a great dopplebock."
"Cheers to BeerBeing for the chance."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" orangey tan head above the clear burgundy brew. Dense head lasts nicely, with ample lace. Aroma is vinous with malty sweetness and dark fruits. Taste is hearty grain, with light fruitiness mixed in, light alcohol flavor at the close to accompany the ample warmth. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. Could easily be a dangerous brew to have many of in the fridge."
"D: Definately a highly drinkable beer. Victory has many fantastic examples of styles and this hits the mark as well. great tasting doppelbock."
"this is a proper dopple with some massive character and refined subtleties, giving those germans a run for their money."
"Drinkability is very high. This is not a cone but a very good doppelbock that has its own style and taste. This is a keeper. MK"
"Pours sweet, syrupy, dark amber with the underplayed malt aroma of a rich lager. Warming malt flavors slide in with a hint of spice, but presents as a nice, chewy doppelbock. Smooth like molassas; Victory knows how to make a good lager and I'll certainly be looking for this one next winter!"
"Excellent body and carbonation. Very drinkable. Not as big as Salvator or Celbrator but a nice dopplebock."
"A pretty rustish red with a small beige head. Honey-smoked ham and caramel-coated chocolate in the nose with an intimate aroma too from the fresh hoppaging. The flavor starts the same and then just kinda deflates. It certainly doesn't carry through like I was hoping that it would. Leaves the mouth a little skanky. Too bitter? I think so. Too bland in the end? I think so. This is a decent beer, but not what I expect from a doppelbok. Give me more flavor."
"This is a very good dopplebock. It pours a nice brown with a thin head. It smells of dark malt. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy, with the tastes of chocolate and dried fruit coming through. Definitely something I would drink again."
"This is going down really well. Very drinkable. Highly recommended."
"Music: Splodgenessabounds, Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please"
"D: This beer goes down very easily, especially if you’re partial to the fruity flavor. It’s also not as filling as I expected. The first beer that I had in this style wasn’t very good. Even if the Dopplebock hasn’t been vaulted into the status of my favorite beer types, this particular beer has redeemed my faith in the style."
"D - highly tasty brew, on the filling side due to the body and sweetness. Good example of the doppelbock style."
"Dark brown body with no head, served in a Westmalle chalice. Smells delicious with dark fruity malts. Taste is rich with licorice and chocolate followed by the fruit. Creamy and somewhat thick mouthfeel and very drinkable. A very fine beer."
"This beer had a great appearance, deep brown, almost black, but with crimson around the edges. Slight carmely colored head. The smell was malty and good but didn't have everything the taste did. The taste was malty, chocolaty and carmely, at first but quite smooth, with an extended finish of all types of deep, almost tart fruity flavors with enough alcohol kick to make them enjoyable. You definitely notice a slight hop presence as well. It had a great body for a doppelbock, not too thick and malty, pretty easy to drink."
"Overall a hell of a doppel...reminds me some of Celebrator in that it is not a huge in your face brew....subtle...smooth...tasty...nicely done...."
"Thanks again Victory."
"I'm glad I found some of this in my area, a very tasty doppelbock. Goes well with all the rain outside."
"The smell is of nice and deep dark malts. The taste has a good amount of chocolate on top of the malts, and almost a bit of wheat flavor. Hops are pronounced in the fininsh. The mouthfeel is full, and drinkability is good."
"Finally got around to getting some of this years beer. Nice heavy deep red with a tan hued head. Smells of sweet malt and a touch of breadiness with a grassy hop background. The taste is very full, sweet clean malt with a touch of noble hops to steady the fare. The mouthfeel is nice and thick with helps the flavor really stick in the mouth, a good beer and worth checking out, but not a trip by itself."
"An OK beer but not anywhere near the best of its style. Not a beer I can really recommend."
"Pours a nice crystal clear mahogony red with a thin beige cap of head, little retention, no real lacing. Nose is delicious--big and nutty and bready, caramel, slight bit of smokiness. Taste is sweet molasses, doughy malt, hazelnut, slightly toasty malt, caramel, and actually a slight bit of spicey hops coming through on the finish. Medium/full bodied with a moderate carbonation and a nice chewy feel. This is a pretty nice doppelbock, more balanced and less sweet than some others I've had, but ultimately this just isn't a style I love."
"Clear, deep mahogany. Thin cap of light brown head. Lacing is pretty full. Really nice aroma. Baked bread aroma. And yeastiness. And sweet malts. Nice blend on the nose. On the palate, cinamon bread come forth quickly. A little molasses. Rich malts. Doughiness. Lots of good things going on. Smooth in the mouth and flavor. Medium-full body. Silky feel. Great Dopple."
"D: Well I could buy this...or I could spend a few more dollars and get some Celebrator or Korbinian...sorry, the latter wins. I don't know what it is about me and victory, their beers just never live up to the hype."
"Pours a carmel brown sugar haze with a little carbonation.I was a little skeptical from its appearence being used to darker dopplebocks but was intrested to see how they did. A small head appeared and then disapated quickly. Smells of burnt caramel, raisins and spices, nice for this kind of beer . The taste was much like it smelled and was warming with its 8.5% abv and was a great attempt to a classic European Beer."
"12 oz. bottle from Beltway Fine Wine. Pours chestnut with light fluffy, short lived head and no lacing. Aroma of smokey malts and booze. Hearty mouth flavor full of smokey malts, light booze, some nuttiness and fruits. Warming, tasty and drinkable. Would be more drinkable if it was lighter or had a bit more carbonation. Very good, nonetheless."
"Pours a beatiful mahogany with a thick tan head that over time becomes a thick ring of lace. Great nose of caramel and tree fruits along with the slightest hint of smokiness. The smoked malt is a little more prevalent on the tongue, provides a great undercurrent of complexity, flavours are mostly plum, burnt caramel, milk chocolate, the finish is dry and lightly spicy. Mmmm good drinking!"
"Huge creamy tan head, that faces to a solid ring over a ruby mahongay body. Minimal lacing. Smell is malty malt on malted malt: just like a d-b should be. Hints of pepper and ginger. More of the same in the taste, with a fascinating sour note that grows on you. Hops fill in the whole background, bringing long slightly acidic bitterness to the finish. Good round mouthfeel, that along with the smell comprises the best feature of this beer. At 8.5% it's a bit on the strong end of the d-b range, but the taste masks it well, making for a pretty quaffable brew. I can hardly wait until this beer and the other Victory offerings are available in Colorado. I will have more of this."
"12 oz with an enjoy by date of July 27, 06. Dark brownish amber with a decent tan head. Some sticky lacing was left coating the glass. Rich dark fruity aroma with some caramel and sugary sweetness. Flavor starts with more fruits, plums and caramel. Light roasty or burnt notes where there as well as a mild chocolate. Finishes with caramel covered fruit. Smooth and creamy body. A great tasty and easy to drink example of the style."
"A fairly decent effort here, quite Belgain-esk in some fashion as its complexity is more then enough to lift the eyebrows and swirl the mouth buds into a firm sense of stability in smoothened sweetness."
"A tad light on the body for a Doppel Bock. Not bad. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability: very easy drinking for the style. Must pick up a six pack or try on tap. Great beer."
"Overall I must admit I am far from a beer expert especially in this style but it is a great beer and well worth a try."
"D - Victory is a good brewery, I go into every one of their beers with an open mind, but they have never lived up to the hype. This is no exception. Please don't mistake me, it is a fairly good beer. It is just in no way exceptional and in some ways pretty average. It is easy to drink, especially for the strength, but entirely unsessionable, unless of course, you are looking to have ""one of those nights"" or to be ""that guy."" Then this would do just fine."
"A solid dopplebock and easy to consume."
"I got a 1/6 of this and the beer poured a dark brown with ruby highlights and a nice creamy off white head, it looked really inviting. The nose was a sweet malty milk chocolate with some toasty smells coming through too. The taste is very toasty, it is not as sweet as the smell would indicate, and there is a little bitterness, like a semi-sweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is full and silky smooth. It is hard to drink more than one or two these because it is so filling."
"Poured a nice dark brown/burgundy color in my goblet with a slight tan colored head that didn't stay long, but left behind a touch of scattered lacing. Aromas of malt and alcohol dominate with the faint odor of astringent (Windex or other cleaning substance); not entirely appealing, but above average. The taste was rather watered down with little complexity as the malt didn't seem to have any dimensions. The alcohol was present and worked well with the malt. Felt rather thin in my mouth. I wouldn't mind having a few in a sitting, but it's not nearly as flavorful, complex, or interesting as other doppelbocks I've had. To me this was more like an altbier or unbalanced amber ale rather than a member of the bock family."
"This is a solidly good brew all around, but for being a dopplebock... I think it's a little off. It's just missing that thick, syrupy sweetness that I look for and love in a dopple bock. It's good, but those crazy germans just know what thier doing... we still have a lot to learn over here."
"Transparent brown color with a decided red cast to it. Yellowish head is flat, medium in duration. Leaves very little lace on the glass. Deep malty aroma, slight cinnamon and coffee, ripe pears. Mouthfeel is lighter than some, carbonation is lively and the texture overall comes out at about medium. Starts out with spicey flavor qualities, molasses and elements of tangy mincemeat. The malt component is certainly adequate. What stands out as different is the considerable hop bittering on this one, German in style, very dry with elements of asphalt. Interesting in its balance. Alcohol is moderately well-hidden but noticeable by the end of the glass, and the ashy hop is ever-present in the aftertaste. Maybe what's missing for me is a bit more of a sturdy mouthfeel, and I tend to like the overall impression to be sweeter in a Doppelbock."
"Pours into a Celabrator glass a very solid amber ot ruby color with a 2 finger light tan head that falls quickly to a coat of about a quater inch over top. A moderate carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Nose is nice and toasty, with deep sweet caramel and lighter figy fruityness in there. Definately dominated by melanoidans, but with good sweetness in there to balance. I like the aroma. Flavor is very full and hits the aroma pretty well. It starts out as a caramel and fig sweetness, but moves very quickly to a light grainey toastyness. There is the lightest of bitters hanging on the finish. This is tasty. Feel is very thick, with a light to moderate carbonation. Its very chewy and almost a touch slick. As far as things go, I don't detect any of the alcohol that is in this brew. I really like that light bitterness that hangs on, as I think it works very well with the other flavors. This one is a winner in my book. I'd have it again any day."
"One more word on the subject: Yum!"
"Make sure to pick up more than one six pack when you see this beauty in the store! No matter how many you buy, you'll wish you had more. Arguably one of the finest German styled beers brewed by an American brewery. Prost!!"
"This is a really great doppelbock. Perhaps my 2nd favorite."
"Sure, it's about the malt, as well it should be, but the hops put a fine touch on things and lended an air not often seen in the style. It's big, no doubt, and the ABV comes through in spots, but it would also be easy to ignore, and that might not be wise. Still, in spite of the size, it's a joy to drink, with the sweet and spicy playing off each other like to happy puppies. I wil be revisiting this unique number often in the future."
"Burnt amber in color, the head quickly fading to an ever-present lacing. Sweet, malty, thick brown Irish baked bread in the nose. Flavors of this beer seem so simple, and yet layer after layer keeps coming out. We could make a laundry list of nuances here: herbal spicy yet sweet, chewy, doughy thick malty goodness; toasty burnt caramel and black cherries in the finish, all with a solid undertow of juicy hop bitterness. Alcohol? Quite well hidden amongst the ocean of flavors. Crisp, mildly carbonated. This fine beer truly is liquid bread."
"Overall: I'm admittedly not the biggest fan of doppelbocks, but this one really won me over. Surprisingly balanced, not too sweet, and nicely hopped. I'll take it!"
"Drinkability: A beer you must savor to appreciate, appears at first to be harsh and unfinished, but late reveals itself as a different sort of dopplebock, one I can appreciate."
"Thanks to tgbljb for the trade!"
"Fresh bottles sampled at the brewery upon release. Aromas are all heavy german malts with some pretzels and fresh bread in the aroma and some floral hops are lurking in the back of the room as well. Taste is well rounded. A malt monster, but not one dimensional, nice yeast complexity with chocolate, carmael, and slight coffee flavors emerging as this one gets warm. Dried fruits, and figs come into play as well as the hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is really exceptional for a doppelbock and for an 8.5% beer. A return to form, of sorts, for my once favorite brewers."
"I couldn't give this beer higher scores, because it was too sluggish and ale-like in many regards. It works though."
"The mouth feel was light bodied but felt heavy in my mouth with a light and easy carbonation that gave the over all impression of water."
"Overall- a decent doppelbock, just too sweet."
"This beer pours a nice medium amber color with a nice tan, thick head. There was a nice malty sweet aroma to this beer and some subtle hints of fruit. The taste gives you a nice toasted malty sensation to roll around in your mouth and it stays with you for awhile which is enjoyable. This is a very nice beer from Victory and at the brewery made it taste just a bit better."
"Simply excellent."
"Thanks to FoolCircle and SS'05."
"Drinkability- Quite a nice doppelbock. Right up there with my two favorites (Celebrator and Weltenburger). Would have again if it was out here. Thanks for the sample Santos!"
"Mouthfeel is right on. Chewy, warming, sweet, and balanced with a quick finish."
"mahogany. The nose was very malty with an underlying molasses/tar scent. I should point out that this last was not off-putting, just present. It had a really thick mouthfeel with a caramel sweetness on the tongue. The finish was a blend of sweet flavors - caramel, toffee, molasses. Warming, it became even richer, more toffee-like. A very interesting beer."
"Not what I was expecting for the style.. which in this case is a bad thing.. hard to say much else about it since it was so lackluster.. would try it again but am in no rush to do so."
"Smoother and rounder than many, it's just that edge that gives St. Victorious enough of an edge to put it at the top of its class. It pours a beautiful crimson-chestnut with glowing orange highlights at the base and a creamy yellowed-paper head. The retention is quite good, and holds admirably considering its strength. The lacing is somewhat limited, but that's common for the style; and when tasted side by side with a competing brand, it was quite obvious that the St. Victorious dominated. The nose is rich with soft creamy caramel, a waft of juicy dark fruit, toasty malts, and just the essence of some floral hops. In the mouth it's delicately crisp and then malty smooth across the palate with a dextrinous medium body and fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation. The flavor is very much as the aroma suggests, but with a wider breadth of character that includes a fuller Vienna/Munich maltiness, a judicious amount of alcohol, and a touch of what seems like Beechwood smokiness. The bitterness is restrained as might be expected; and it finishes dry with a light wash of drying alcohol and some lingering bready, and very subtly smoky, malt. Quite nice indeed! In fact, ....world class! This ranks right up there with Paulaner Salvator and Ayinger's Fortunator/Celebrator."
"This beer pours rich, dark ruby color with minimal tan head which dissipates rather quickly. Aroma is powerful and is apparent as soon as you pour it. Its sweet and toasty bouquet is so pleasant that I start thinking that some company should capture it in an air freshener. The flavor is sweet and rich. The beer goes down easy. May be too easy, as reviewing it proves to be a challenge since I just want to enjoy it without thinking about the technical mambo jumbo. Somewhat high alcohol content blends perfectly into the drink and packs a nice punch. As the beer goes down your throat you are left with sweet warmth wanting more. This would be perfect on a chilly night. Enjoyed from bottle in a quietness of my home. Best before August 2005 (drank May 2005)."
"I'd always had this in bottles and thought it was so-so, but I recently had it on tap at home and it really changed my opinion of this beer. Fantastic dark ruby-brown color, rich malty aroma. Taste is heavy on the dark fruits, rich malty profile. Somewhat bready, nice and chewy. Reminds me a bit of Celebrator. Sweet, but not too much so. Quite drinkable. A fine example of the style."
"This beer is a cloudy brown with yellowish highlights. The head was small and short lived. The smell is good, very sweet and malty. There is a alcohol smell and a sort of musky or woody smell. There is lots of flavor. It is sweet and malty, and very fruity. There is a slight bitterness that keeps the sweetness from overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and round with a warm feeling even though it is cold. The alcohol is very evident. The drinkability is good. A very nice beer."
"Drinkability is very high. Really went down easy (sort of like Davo) with the only disappointment that I did not have an another to immediately follow it with. Really well-made and complex beer can only imagine how smooth easy and dangerously inebriating this one would be on tap."
"This beer poured up a deep ruby red. Little foam formed with a heavy pour and it all faded with right away to nothing. The nose is subtle and sweet. The flavor is not as strong as I would have expected. Sweet with a smooth mouthfeel. The taste doesn't linger but it warms a bit after swallowing. This seasonal seems to a bit less than it's billed to be but is still pretty good. Not the best from Victory but definetly worth a try. I would reccommend it."
"The beer poured a dark brown color. Not much head to speak of. Aroma has a rich malty sweetness to it, with mayge a hint of fruitiness. The taste is very malty and sweet, with a hint of caramel to it. There is a good hop balance. A very good Bock! Maybe not up to some of the better ones, but still very drinkable."
"Pours with a deep amber color. Nice head but it disipated quickly. Strong hoppy aroma with a definate hint of caramel. Caramel smell carried over to the taste. A little sweet and high in alcohol to drink more than one or two in a sitting. Overall a beer that i would drink again."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty strong beer, and it's pretty sweet as I think most Doppelbock's are. However, I still feel this would be great a year or two down the road as I think mine was pretty green off the tap, not to mention the cold glass. Still, very enjoyable, a great take on the style, and if I can find some I'll definitely buy it and cellar it to see what happens."
"Enjoyed from bottle with use by date of Aug 1, 2005. I am glad to see Victory bottling this beer this year. Poured a beautiful deep copper color with large head. Was not initially impressed with first taste, but it began to grow on me as the glass disappeared. Nice finish. will definitely enjoy again"
"Drinkability  This is a great-tasting beer that is a bit off-style from an authentic German Doppelbock. I enjoyed it very much though and will definitely seek out again."
"Awesome American stab at the style!"
"Pours a dark, brown soda color, with a little bit of aged-bone colored head. Nose reminds me of a abv-heavy, sweet, roasted nutty-ness. Tatse boastes an interesting mix of nutty-ness, wine-quality, solid malt, sweet taste, with a spicy/sweet hop finish. Not the most complex dopple i have had, but, surely a solid competitior, that mixes well on several occasions."
"only negative is a lack of any sweetness in the taste. for 8.5%, very mellow. great accompaniment to a simple meat dish. will seek this out in the future, would like to try it on tap."
"12 oz. bottle dated best before Aug 1 2005. Pours a clear medium copper-brown color with a beigish-tan head that dissipates rather promptly. Deep, vinous toffee and roasted malt profile with some underlying dark berry and plummy fruitiness. Hops do play a role in the aroma, but are overtaken by the aggressive maltiness. Very rich and flavorful. Further vinous fruitiness shows in the flavor and some toasty malt comes through nicely. Light husky astringency in the finish. Alcohol shows through the hefty mouthfeel, but not overwhelming. A very nice doppelbock (better even than some German ones) from the brewers at Victory."
"Drinkability and Overall: A wonderful doppelbock for sure. Smooth and creamy, full of complexity and balance, yet it has enough kick to cure even the heaviest of beer drinkers need for a strong brew. This a warming beer that is one of the best from Victory. I managed to get the only case my local distributor got in, and that was one hour after they got it. Talk about lucky! Well, God bless Victory for making this truly remarkable beer."
"A nice enjoyable dopplebock. Pretty authentic tasting stuff. Just lacking some of the complexity of the real deal from across the pond."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: I've never had such a malty beer that drank so lightly. This is amazing, considering that it's up around 9%. This is the antithesis of cloying. This is so nice, with just enough carbonation to keep it on the tip of the tounge, that it is just utterly drinkable, even for a style I've never found drinkable. This is great. This is incredible. I'm interested to see if the bottles are just as nice. I would think so. Make the pilgramage before it's too late."
"Prosit!"
"this was an exceptional beer from an exceptional brewery."
"Drinkability: I am pouring this stuff into my mouth at a dangerous rate, and would gladly continue to do so for the rest of the night, if I did not have to work tomorrow."
"I highly remomend this brew!"
"D&N: Yes, I gave it a five. This one has everything I like, it's a great example of the style; great smells and flavors, and it's from my state. Had this one on tap at Sharp Edge Beer Emporium with beergeek279 and cupbeerman."
"Had on tap at home - pours a rich orangey amber with a creamy white head. Some nice lacing too. Both parts of the mouth (front and back) are made happy by the texture and the taste of this magnificent beer. Nice malt flavor at the front and a very agreeable dryness at the back. This elegant seasonal makes the year round Festbier seem clumsy and awkward by comparison. Also beware, it hides its 8.5% ABV well. Run, don't walk to Victory to taste it before it's all gone (esp as it is not available in bottles)."
"Thank you to Victory for sending this gem of a beer over to Western PA. A dopplebock that stands up with Salvator and Celebrator as amongst the best in style. Quite good, and as long as it's around, this will be one of the beers I'll naturally gravitate towards."
"I had this on tap at Victory during the BA Philly Rally. It was the first time that I tried it, and the first double bock that I had for a while. It is a beautiful looking beer with its dark amber color and small white head. It has a malty aroma with the hint of some kind of fruitiness. It seems to have an odd hint of citrus that I didnt expect. The taste is a sweet malty explosion with that fruity rounding at the end that makes it a special brew. The feel is the mouth is one of creaminess, slightly thick. This was drinkable from first sip to last. I had no time for a second but on another trip, I will be sampling again."
"On tap at Victory at the Philly gathering. This really is a gorgeous strong lager. Poured a very clear amber-reddish color and was topped off with a small head of syrupy cream foam. Thick and sweet malt nose, with cordial-like fermented fruit. The taste is full of flavor and complete with malty sweet and syrupy fruit and even some hot cinnamon spiciness. Very smooth and full bodied. Small orange rind bitterness comes through in the finish and remains in the back of the throat. Well made."
"Dark mahogany color with an off-white head that hangs around for a bit. Smells of dark malts and spices. Slight hints of cinnamon come to mind as well as plums and raisins. Strong tastes of old aged malts and bits of hops hit the palate followed by a warming alcohol feel that warms the stomach and brings a smile. Delcious tastes of fruits such as plums and rum raisins bring this beer to a nice complexity. Very nice brew."
"Marginalia: In a total beer geek moment, and I blame Randall th' Enamel Animal for this, I was able to pick out the rauch malts used in this. It's such a small amount of rauch that you'd be hard pressed to taste it if you didn't know beforehand. I ""blame"" Randall for this since all the other taste receptors in my mouth were still reeling from Randallized 120 Minute IPA. The only thing that I could taste with assured clarity was smoke."
"1/2 gallon growler: glowing burnt crimson with a creamy beige head that retreats to a small collar, but leaves little patches of lace on the glass. caramel-dipped candy apple aroma with a touch of noble hops. relatively low carbonation results in a creamy and full mouthfeel. layers upon layers of malt complexity are mind boggling. i taste toasted munich malts, all kinds of fruit, and a caramel backbone. light earthy hops come in at the end to keep things toned down just enough. the drinkability is amazing, considering the style and ABV. the first quaffable doppelbock i've ever had. just fantastic stuff."
"On of the best domestically brewed Double Bocks I have had to date."
"Drinkability - I wanted to drown myself in this one, but the 8.5% scared me off, as I was driving 75 miles home. Definitely a good offering from a very good brewery. Thumbs up!"
"Wow, I tell you what there are breweries out there that claim to be world class, but Victory doesn't have to act, they are the real deal. This authentic German style Strong dark lager or Doppelbock is dead on, pours a ruby deep amber tone off white cream colored head not very thick and doesn't stick around very long leaves behind specks of lace on my imperial pint. Aroma deep plentiful layers of malts supporting a cast of other stars, the German Hallertau whole leaf hops and plum esters. Smells predominantly of fruit soaked in alcohol with caramel malts around the edges, hmm hmmmm good. Flavor is flowing with a wave of malts creating over ripened fruit notes and a touch of hop flavor bringing mild but perfect bitterness to the table, I think I'm in love. Rolls down the palate with a slick slightly syrupy texture and medium body packs a nice punch with 8.5% abv. Suprisingly incredibly smooth and drinkable, I am sold never had two doppelbocks in a row, I had two imperial pints of this with dinner tonight damn good. If this is an option I will pass on Celebrator, Salvator, or any other (insert word here)ator knockoff."
"I've been waiting eight months to quaff this beauty, anticipating its release since the first day I became a Philly resident. Take a trip to the brewery to taste the care and love that exudes through this creation."
"I was disappointed when I first brought this beer to my nose, but once I started drinking it I was floored. I only wish now that I opted for the 20 oz. glass. Highly recommended!"
"My second favorite Victory brew after HopDevil, this beer is outstanding. Drinking it fresh on tap in one of the 0.5L German style glasses in the spring is an awesome experience. The beer is so beautifully malty it almost makes me shed a tear. Then I realize its only available for the spring and definately not where I live currently (Indiana) and I acutally do shed a tear. This beer is overwhelmingly smooth. The malty goodness is not too sweet, not too dry, just right in my humble opinion."
"Creamy, delicious and malty with an opaque dark reddish brown color.. excellent Belgian lace throughout the glass and very chocolaty as well as that kick of alocohol. Mouthfell is smooth and velevety but be warned this Doppelbock will hit you hard due to the ABV..very drinkable but very dangerous."
"This beer came to me a brown/copper/amber color that was clear. The head was a cream/light tan color that was not that dense and lasting. Semi-decent carbonation was felt on the tongue. I did not really notice a lace. The aromas that came from the glass were of dark rich malts, dandelions, and some dark fruits (plum, raison) It has a solid rich flavor that was really good. I tasted caramel, dark malts, light cocoa, dark sweet fruits, roasted nut, light earth and some bitter hops (which was not overbearing, rather enjoyable.) This beer is not over powering in any departments, all smells and flavors are well balanced. It left a great feeling in 3 senses; my mouth, nose and even eyes were all pleased. Another score for VICTORY."
"Average for this brewery is a huge disappointment.  I love all of their brews, but this was a shock to my system.  This is the only beer from victory that i have drank and did not want another. 8.5% ABV but is boring in its complexity. I guess I like a bolder taste in a beer this strong. Also it seemed to settle too fast with ahint of under-carbonation."
