4.25,7.6,,,,,,"Pretty damn good. Strong, full flavor with no objectionable qualities. Fairly cheap, strong enough, and easy to put down. Love the dry hopped flavor; this beer has a certain dignity to it that the regular Fireman's Four just barely misses. Don't get me wrong, Fireman's Four is a great beer, but Four Squared is just that - Four "squared." Rich, thick, with good carbonation and a universally good flavor. I could honestly not see anybody who likes beer having a problem with this brew. It's not too-much or too-little of anything. It tastes great without venturing into the more adventurous flavors which non-craft-fans may not enjoy. For those new to Real Ale who prefer more standard beers, I would start here. If you're feeling adventurous or want something that's stronger than necessary and has a crazy flavor, try their Devil's Backbone. Either way this is a company that makes great product and you're in good hands buying any of their beers","jcance","Oct 27, 2014"

The beer is a bright golden color with a soap bubble head. Nose is extremely floral and citrusy. Beer is a sharp one hit of bitterness and overpowering yeasty flavors that left an unpleasant after taste. The body is light and crisp, almost no malt flavoring to balance. Not something I'd recommend or return to, Fireman's 4 just isn't a big enough beer to balance the dry hoppying.","zander4dawin","Jul 20, 2014"

Pours moderately cloudy pale golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, grass, pine, light honey, and dank floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dank hop notes with a light malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, tangerine, orange rind, floral, grass, pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of dank floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dank hop flavors; with a light-moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy blonde ale. All around nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Jun 09, 2013"

4.13,4.6,4,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Pale golden pour with a foamy white head sustained by pillars of carbonation. Grassy and floral hops dominate the smell. Cantaloupe and honeydew melon. The taste expounds on those light melon notes and flourishes. Excellent citrus forwardness. Nice light hop bite in the finish and a lingering freshness on the tongue. A bit of toast takes something away from this for me. This drinks dangerously well though. Excellent carbonation and light body. Deceptively refreshing.","jwff","Jun 02, 2013"

4.22,6.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The zingy hops are just bitter enough, but mostly it's a festival of leafy, herbaceous, perfumey, and darkly fruity aromatics. I can't identify anything that reminds me of specific fruits, but it's quite a harmonious warm brew. I'm not a hop obsessive, but this is a really sensational hoppy beer. I think it should be categorized either as a Pale Ale or an American IPA. The focus is clearly on the hops, and the color is neither a red or amber. From the 12 oz can purchased at Texas Wine in Fredericksburg.","mactrail","May 22, 2013"

Smells of fruity tangerines and grapefruit with some caramel in the background. It tastes of hoppy citrus peel, mostly grapefruit, there is some breadiness and pine in there too. It has a light body and the carbonation is soft, full and silky and the finish is crisp and slightly dry. I really enjoyed this beer, way better than the regular Fireman's 4.","JMad","May 10, 2013"

Still quite balanced and on the refreshing side, but a heftier beer needs bolder flavors to entice me.","Lawl3ss","Jun 30, 2012"
