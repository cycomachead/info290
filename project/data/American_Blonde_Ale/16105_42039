More of a summer beer but certainly sessionable..Overall exceptional for the style.","tigg924","Mar 08, 2009"
3.91,8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"was drinking this with the expectation of a ""golden bitter", so perhaps my negative preconceptions of ""american blonde ale"" didn't creep into my thoughts.","tai4ji2x","Feb 11, 2009"
4.02,11,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Nice. Definitely a nice session beer on a hot summer day. Will look for this one in the future.","NoLiberty","Jan 21, 2009"
3.7,2.2,3,3,4,4,4,"...it tastes much better than it looks or smells. Biscuitry, citrus zest up front with light grain in back. Very complimentary. Some peppery spice with swallow. Very refreshing, humble, and pleasant. This is beer beer-what I think of when I think of when I hear the word beer.","donkeyrunner","Jan 19, 2009"
3.38,-6.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It sort of smells like BMC beer, but the malt and hops immediately tell you with the first sip it's a golden ale. Very mellow, very present, and very drinkable. A good solid session golden.","taez555","Jan 18, 2009"
3.8,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A fairly crisp brew, but with a creamier feel than anticipated. I'm not sure that - to my mind - it it quite with the rest of the package. Nonetheless, a pretty tasty ale that drinks easy and settles both easily and lightly.","TheMistler","Dec 11, 2008"
3.69,1.9,4,2.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Went nicely with pizza topped with some hot peppers and veggies, smooth simple flavors akin to a macro lager but without the off-flavors. I'm enjoying this alot and will be getting it again for sure. Very Drinkable.","Ineedabeerhere","Dec 06, 2008"
3.7,2.2,3,3,4,4,4,"D - This beer is what every American Macro lager should aspire to be. It's got all of the ""clean"" and ""taste"" and none of the bad marketing and adjuncts.","EPseja","Nov 26, 2008"
3.86,6.6,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Not a huge fan of blond or golden ales, but if anyone can do it right, it is Mayflower. Appearance is impressive, as it showcases a clear orange/gold with one finger worth of white heading. Smell is not overly assertive, mostly some clean grain smells along with some biscuit, and mild floral tones. Taste has bright grain flavors, hints of honeycomb, nice bit of earth as well. Mouthfeel is light, and perfectly balanced. The malt interacts with the hops in an awesome way. Drinkability truly shines with this beer. It is light and overwhelmingly refreshing, while still maintaining quite a lot of complexity. Looking for a session beer to pair with a snack? Forget the lager with beer nuts. Try this with some salted pumpkin seeds; the pairing is terrific. Outside of their India Pale Ale, this is probably my favorite offering from Mayflower. If you see it, buy a sixer or two. Cheers","jamie2dope","Nov 16, 2008"
3.29,-9.1,3.5,2,3,4,5,"A middle-of-the-road craft Golden/Blonde Ale. Could be a good beach/boat beer. I would recommend this to non-beer drinkers. Could be an excellent gateway beer. However, I will stick with the Mayflower Pale Ale in the future.","TrevorGW","Sep 17, 2008"
3.35,-7.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"This isn't a bad blonde, but not one of my faves either. The beer has a slightly sulfury, somewhat perfumey aroma, that is offset somewhat by citrus notes. The beer pours a nice clear golden with a white creamy head that dissipates pretty suddenly. The taste began somewhat creamy, but was interrupted by a sharp peppery, spicy, tart hop flavor. This is not a particularly crisp beer, but the spices make it more biting and crispy that is probably warranted. The beer is modestly carbonated, has a bit more of a stinging aftertaste than I typically like. But it isn't a bad blonde either. There is an astringent, tart, pepperishness to the beer that is just too much. Not heaps of malt presence either, but that is to be expected with a blonde ale. Not bad, worth a shot, but I wouldn't return to it either.","albern","Sep 12, 2008"
3.77,4.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice lighter beer that is worth pounding several of, especially since it's a little bit more flavorful than most in the style.","TheManiacalOne","Sep 11, 2008"
3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Better than most; I'd describe this as a malty blonde ale with lots of grain husk flavor.","smcolw","Sep 11, 2008"
3.76,3.9,4,3,4,4,4,"D - Drinkability is good. The light and mild nature of the style make it naturally quite drinkable. This beer is smooth and sticks to that style well. Alcohol is almost completely hidden which just helps this category out evbne more. Glad I got to try it.","csmiley","Aug 26, 2008"
4.15,14.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" eggshell head over the clear dark golden brew. Head fades gradually, with good lacing. Aroma is pale sweetness coupled with lightly citrus hops. Taste stays the course, with light grains and balancing hops. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and drinkability is excellent. Nice one!","ppoitras","Aug 15, 2008"
4.1,13.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A well designed label graces the bottle of Mayflower's Golden Ale. The brew pours a transparent yellow/brownish color with some visible carbonation and a small white head that lays thin and screen-like atop the beer. Nice balanced nose of fruity hops and nutty malts. The beer has a bold malt backbone even though the bright hop character is mostly dominant. The body is semi-coating and there seems to be the slightest flare of alcohol heat... which is odd for the low ABV of the brew. It has a light body and sparkling carbonation and is extremely drinkable. Would definitely drink again!","ATPete","Aug 10, 2008"
3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a nice (duh) gold with a decent haed that is inviting. Smell suggest a sweet maltiness. Taste is mainly malty, light, with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is light, refreshing. Vey easy on the drinkability scale due to its lightness and low abv.","edchicma","Aug 09, 2008"
3.95,9.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Very drinkable, light, and tasty. A new staple for my beer fridge in the summer months.","Freshie","Aug 07, 2008"
3.77,4.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear, bubbly gold with hints of amber. There is a very short lived white head that dissipates completely leaving no lacing. Smell is mainly light grains with some sweet caramel malts, though the aromas are subdued all the way around. The taste is also subdued and has a more roasted malt flavor with some caramel sweetness as well. The mouthfeel is very crisp, clean and leaves only the slightest bitterness with a dry finish. This is definitely drinkable and would certainly make for a decent summer session brew.","gford217","Jul 17, 2008"
3.75,3.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Glad I stopped by and sampled the local craft brewer","SMADMS","Jul 07, 2008"
4.35,20.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Excellent drinkability. This will be one of my session beers for sure.","erosier","Jul 04, 2008"
3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. The drink settled with a murky, pale gold appearance with some good lacing. The aromas were predominately hoppy with some bready florals as well. The taste was generally bittersweet with that doughy floral flavoring prevalent again. Decent carbonation made the drink enjoyable throughout the evening. Overall, a good blonde.","fitzy84","Jun 20, 2008"
3.8,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Picked up a six pack this past weekend so that I could try a beer from this new brewery that I have read so much about. Poured into a tall pilsner glass. The color was sunshine golden yellow. Slight constant carbonation noticeable the entire time. Minute earthy smell on the nose. Taste was just as I expected: great. Very smooth, easy going down, great on the taste buds and a wonderful aftertaste. With the abv at 4.7%, it's a great session beer. Glad I picked up a sixer as this ale is one of my new favorites. A great intro to a new brewer.","morebeergood","Jun 16, 2008"
3.78,4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"D - easy drinking brew.","JoeyBeerBelly","Jun 12, 2008"
3.38,-6.6,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Feel was nice though, not very thin with lively carbonation, Drinkability was ok but I'd rather have something with more bold flavors.","currysage1","Jun 06, 2008"
