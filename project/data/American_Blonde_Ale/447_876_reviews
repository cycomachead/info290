"A beer from my yout'? The local packy regularly stocked the XXX Pale, the IPA, and the lager. I didn't know at the time what an ale was,but it was pleasant enough & the price was always right. Had it at a wedding at a VFW this past august & was impressed. Now, as a nouveau hipster brew this could stand next to PBR as a cool slumming bev, only with flavor & character. A piney afternote surprised & convinced me. As good as Porkslap, Victory, or any other B+ pale."

"Edit: A friend stopped by for a couple beers and he cannot get a hold of Ballantine IPA where he lives (Norfolk, VA).  Not only did I give him a bottle (which he loved), but I also mixed my own IPA to the Ballantine XXX: 40% IPA, 60% XXX.  And man, oh man, what a good choice that was.  I heartily recommend trying this strategy if you'd like to transport yourself into the past.  You won't regret it."

"DATE REVIEWED: August 9, 2014... GLASSWARE: Baltika stange... OCCASION: Sharknado with Matt, Jer and Shan--a win!...APPEARANCE: cler golden yellow body; bubbles are consistent; crisp white head that spreads upward with cirrus wisps; smeary lacing... AROMA: funky tin malts--as expected from a 40 oz. bottle--and some banana at the end--mostly wet pennies... PALATE: thin at first; beefy ending; gassy and slick; easy drinking otherwise... TASTE: lemony wheat grass; biscuity and toasted malts reign supreme in this otherwise thin profile...OVERALL: intrigued by its history--and ODB’s proclivity for it, according to song--this 40 oz.er drinks easy and malty with a bit of refreshment to it--but it also is a bit thin and unimpressive in its refrigerated neighborhood, where OE 800 and Mickey’s reside..."

"Take this beer for what it is and compare it to its peers.  Does it hold up when compared to craft brewed beer? No. But it is a good macro beer.  Has more hop flavor than others in its class.  Has a corny adjuncty finish.  It's far from horrible, it isn't the greatest beer ever made either.  The beer has its place.  Not as good as Yuengling in the macro category, but I'll take it over a Bud or Coors any day."

"Ballantine's is an affirmation that real hop flavor existed in beer well before the craft boom, and that heritage beers are not automatically shadows of what they should be. It's clean, refreshing, and has real flavor. I was truly surprised and said 'wow' out loud several times with my first pint can. While it's not quite on the hop level of a contemporary APA, Ballantine really has a similar feel to it. Will try again when I get the chance."

"O: This beer came in a green bottle, so that might explain the bits of skunk that I picked up in the smell and taste of this beer. However, it's not bad for a macro beer and doesn't have much in the way of adjuncts in the smell and taste. It also doesn't seem to be as bland as other blonde ales."

"D - Surprisingly enjoyable once you get past the skunky aroma. I'd much prefer to drink this over PBR or other adjunct lagers, particularly if canned or kegged. Very much a lawnmower beer that wouldn't offend anyone. Not particularly complex, but significantly better than anticipated."

"I drank this in college (early 80s) but did not recall the flavor. Today, liking the full range of ales, I found and purchased this locally at Finger Lakes Beverage. Ballantine is one of my favorite beers. Sure, it does not have the ""punch"" of heartier ales, but that's not what this beer is. Instead, it's clean, very dry and light in body. Good for drinking several at a sitting. I always keep a case on hand when it's in stock. Highly recommend."
""
"Pours with a rocky snow white head over clear pale golden liquid. Nose is perfumey, a small amount of sharp metallic hop, mixed with light maltiness. Taste is light-bodied, with some more metallic hoppiness, some mouth coating sweetness and some adjuncty flavors as well. Finishes sharp and tangy though a shadow of it's former self and the poor relative to the legendary Ballantine IPA which was phenomenal. A nice, low-priced ale...very drinkable, especially on hot days."

"I spent a year in England about then. Obviously the English bitters were different, but I can't say I liked the run of the mill ones better, only certain ones like Abott Ale and just about everything brewed in Yorkshire."

"Can't believe this beer got the ratings it did. Flavor is neutral, aroma skunky."
""
"O - It's not the piney / bitter brew I remember from the early 70's in North Jersey. I didn't know what hops were then but I knew I liked the flavor of Ballantine XXX , which I learned many decades later, used hop oil extract. This beer could use some of that but even so, I enjoyed this more than most adjunct brews."

"Very good for a retro Pabst owned (brewed by Miller) product. When you see it for $5-6 for a 6'er do not hesitate to pick some up! When PBR is at the same price point this wins."

"pours yellow-gold in color good one finger white foamy head and a nice spattering of lace. smell is on the weak side with a grassy metallic note. taste grassy along with a malt grain and slightly salty and metallic finish. mouthfeel is light with a crisp carbonation. overall a easy beer to drink a good beer for summer and summer time cookouts. or just anytime."
""
""
""
""
"Poured an 1/8"" white head which faded fast. Clear straw yellow color with almost all the carbonation exhausted. Smells very mildly of malt and grass. Taste mirrors the smell and really is just a pure BMC of a beer. Thoroughly average and forgettable."
""
"O: its not bad, I've got five more that I don't think I'll have a problem to eventually drink but don't think I'd buy this again."
"Ballantine ale is primarily a NE / east coast regional brew. This 2012 version is owned by Pabst, sub brewed by miller. The overall impression is a much hoppier/maltier profile than your average adjunct. I would rate it as one of the best adjuncts available, right up there with Schlitz Gusto. I avoid the green bottles and buy it in tall boy cans to ensure no skunk flavors. Unclear why Pabst does not distro this nationwide as I think it would sell well."
""
"D: This is an interesting beer. I'd be shocked if this weren't actually a lager. I actually found this pretty similar to Yuengling's Lord Chesterfield, though this has a more European hop character. My curiosity got the best of when I picked this up, but at least it's drinkable."

"I really wanted to like this, in the end I couldn't even enjoy it. yuk."

"I tried this once in the 40z form of course wasn't overly thrilled with it though. Its so so . I have heard though the Ballantine Lager was good though sad to say they don't make it anymore oh well. Over all if you want a Cheap Ale with some Nostalgia get a Ballantine ."

"O- Considering what this this, it really isn't bad. It does taste like a watered down pale ale. Not all that good, but I think it has more character than popular adjunct lagers."
" This poured a clear golden yellow with white foamy head. Scent was a touch skunky, so I let it rest a bit before drinking. Surprisingly good despite scent, bready malt, grassy hops a bit ""tinny"" though, but not bad."
"Overall: ""It's got that golden flavor, true ale flavor."" It's a bit sad such a famous beer has been tanked, it's quality diminished as the brand has been shuffled from brewery to brewery, eventually arriving at such a pitiful state. Ah well."
"Has a thin sickly yellow pour with weak soapy head that fades instantly. The nose is similar to the armpit of a man who just completed his first bungee jump, skunky and disturbing. The flavor doesn’t disappoint, like many skunks were rounded up and then distilled by squeezing them in a coffee press, water grass and a hint of urine round out this beverage. Watery body with spotty carbonation, best drunk if your homeless, or aspire to be so in the near future."
"D: At this point, the best 40 I've consumed to date."
"Ran out of Chesterfield, and saw this at the local distributor. Always wanted to give it a try, but a tough call because its a bit pricier than the macros. What if I don't like it? What if she doesn't call me back? In the end I manned up and bought the case. It pours a straw gold, clear with some white head formation. Head dissipates and leaves behind some lacing, uneven distribution but its there. Smell is grassy, a bit of sugar too and some citrus. There's some sweetness and hops there, nice aroma. Taste is decent, macro-ish but a lot more hops are present. Now this is an APA, and it doesn't have the hop bill of SNPA or Sam Adams Boston Ale, but what am I judging this against. In a pinch I'll take Yuengling's Lord Chesterfield over this, but both are poseur craft beers with crisp carbonation, appreciable hop bitterness and easy drinkability."
"definitely start keeping this beer on rotation in my fridge. This has easily become my new, favorite, ""cheap"" beer."
"Pours a clear, straw color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of pale malt, strong grain, hint of sulfur, and a hint of citrus hops. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, grain, and slight citrus hops. Overall, akin to a Light Lager with extra hop."
"There is a restaurant in Purdys NY called the Blazer Pub...some of the best burgers in the NY Tri-state area, and a regular stop for me. Well, recently they decided to go retro and are now offering, in cans, Schaefer, Ballantine, Rheingold and Schlitz....with PBR on tap. Whether you like these beers or not, the concept tickled my fancy and I decided to make my way through the list; revisiting some of the beers of my youth. None of them are great; in fact most of them are poor in comparison to the Captain Lawrence offerings that the Blazer also has on tap. But you know what? They were like an old friend, a blankie that I could hold at the bar and not feel self conscious about. Yes, I drank them all proudly and chances are, I will again."
"Had a bottle for $5.50 at Old Town Bar near Union Square. Surprisingly not bad. There is legitimate citrus hop flavor in this beer. I mean, not much, and it sort of blends into a dull white bread malt character, but it's there. Not very bitter, but an improvement on the cream ale and macro lager. If I came across a cheap case of this (certainly not another bar charging $5.50) I'd pick a case for a party."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, decent representation of style, for an inexpensive alternative this beer isn't a bad choice, but over all there are a lot of other beers in the style that are better."
"Basically it sucks."
"Pours a really pale golden color with a thinnish white head that spends almost no time atop my beer. Smells of straw, honey, corn, skunk hints of earthy hops. Taste is a little sweet with a grainy edge and a faint hop bite. Has a bit more fruity character than a macro lager but is otherwise very similar. Medium to thin body, sweet grainy mouthfeel, crisp carbonation. Easy drinker, but certainly nothing special. The best part of this beer is the puzzles under the caps."
"Taste is not at all appalling but still not all that flavorful. Grainy and bready malt body with some slight hoppy flower notes but really this is all a bit watered down and a bit metalic. Mouthfeel is crisp and full of carbonation. Overall not a bad macro beer at a good price point."
"Green half-quart can with a batch code on the side and a freshness date on the bottom; dry-hopped with Cascade and brewed by Falstaff Brewing Co., not Pabst. Pours a light yellow/gold, with medium carbonation and an inch of frothy white head that doesn't really leave any lacing. Fairly aromatic, with light malts, citric orange zest and perhaps some pine. Very flavorful as well, with sweet corn, a minerally industrial twang and a dash of sulfur forming the base, topped with layers of citric, resiny, piney, almost woodsy hops that impart a mild, but noticeable bitterness. Very cleanly fermented, with just a hint of ethanol. Its body is crisp, tingly and dry, but a touch too heavy for mass consumption. This is a great light beer that has become a staple in my fridge. While it isn't really an APA (more of an American adjunct ale), I imagine this is very similar to what pre-Prohibition beers tasted like. Make sure not to drink this too cold, because light beers don't get any more flavorful than this; imagine having Cascade-flavored burps from a macrobrew. While I have not had this out of the bottle, I don't think I ever would because they use green glass. Regardless of whether or not you like light beers, if you find this in the can, buy it, I highly recommend it, if only to see that not all mass-produced beer is flavorless swill."
"It's actually not bad at all. The smell is of some hop and grain. The taste gives you a quick flash of subtle citrus hop right up front and ends with a dissolving hop grain taste. It smells and tastes like a semi watered down Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. That was my first impression on smelling and tasting this beer. Obviously the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has more solid tastier bitter hops and a way nicer malt taste but this really does this trick if you cant afford Sierra. Drinkablity is very nice not filling and lower alcohol content. This is definitely beats out Budweiser, Miller and Coors. This beer seemed like a beer bursting with taste right after I just drank a Miller Lite... but then I guess a lot of beers have more taste than that. But the big 3 all taste the same to me anyways. Probably the only thing I'll drink from Pabst because it has the most hop character out of any cheaper mass produced beer out there hands down. PUT THIS IN A BROWN BOTTLE!"
"Load these big babies up in a big cooler and slap some chicken and ribs on the grill.."
"Drinkability: A very boring pale ale- this beer isn't terrible, but it's basically a less-watered down adjunct beer. If the big macro companies made ales, I can imagine this is about what it would taste like."
"Not a bad beer at all."
"This is an overly herbal brew, accentuated by the high carbonation level which makes my mouth burn. The overall taste, presentation, and mouthfeel speak to the stereotypical canned adjunct beer; there's soemthing a bit off, a bit unpleasant. I can appreciate the size v. cost aspect of this beer, but in as I am in RI, the 'gansett will not be replaced by this."
"Drinkability- very enjoyable and drinkable, could see this being a great and affordable, alot better beer than alot of people would expect and for a macro beer one of great enjoyable flavor, it does its history proud, a session american beer from the time past thats still better than alot still thriving"
"This isn't a beer I would try again, in fact I think I gave myself a headache trying to smell and taste more than what this beer had to offer."
"RJT"
"After landing in Philly, then driving out to Cape May, New Jersey, I was ready for a beer. Cape May, however, is not the mecca of beer that many cities are. I stopped in a ""packy"" and picked up a sixer of this one in the neon green cans. I walked out to the beach behind the hotel, and with a roast beef sandwich I picked up at the Wawa I enjoyed a couple. For a Pabst product, this one was nicely hopped, balanced and very enjoyable. Earth shattering, No, but if this one was sold in Denver, it would always be in my fridge."
"Drank from a 12 ounce bottle with freshness date of Jan 4,2010. I decided it would be okay to go ahead and drink this brew from the bottle. Claims on the bottle to be America's Largest Selling Ale, I have to wonder about this. Not much of a scent. Smooth flavor, sweet and somewhat herbal notes dominate the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is very smooth and pretty easy to drink. I could easily have a couple more of these."
"Mouth/Drink: Nice body. Its crisp and clean. Drinkability is nice."
"A very drinkable old style beer."
"And it's a damn bargain."
"The pour is the standard pale yellow with a burst of fizzy carbonation on top that diminishes to a thin ring. Ergh! You get that light struck-green bottle skunkiness in the aroma. But once you get around that there are some corny malts in there. The mouthfeel is of medium texture, a bit chewy and carbonated. The taste is the classic pilsener style of the past with adjuncts, breadiness, and a dash of dried hops and even something vaguely sweet. It goes down quickly. Ballantine's history fascinated more than the actual beer. Not for the craft drinker. More for the drinker-drinker."
"I like old-fashioned things so this brand appealed to my sense of nostalgia. I tried it in Maine several years ago and it does seem that it's changed in the past few years. It's hard to find in my parts but I smoked it out at a distributor in White Plains, NY. I agree with much of the other reviewer commentary...this is a decent beer but not worth going out of your way for...my nostalgia was not really rewarded. It has a bit of a rotgut, alcohol-fortified taste to it. I'm disappointed but can't really slam this beer...it does seem that the current offering may be treading on an earlier version's fame and quality, but it does have a distinctive taste. You might like it! It's worth a try, esp. if you can find the tall-boy cans (usually in the cooler) -- they seem to move faster than the 6-pack 12 oz. bottles which look like they gather a lot of dust at retail -- and it won't bust your beer (or microwave burrito) budget."
"For the price, in times when money is tight, it's a great bargain. Those old enough to remember original Ballantine will agree that it would probably rate a solid A+ from most real beer lovers. The current version certainly falls short of that."
"Ballantine is one of the best mass produced beers. Popular in it's hayday Ballantine is now in the nostalgia category with pbr and schaefer etc... but don't be fooled, This fine ale can win over some beer advocates hearts. i poured it out of the can, which i prefer over the bottle. It Tastes alot better out of the can. It's color is pale golden and it's smell is that of a german pale lager. a bit skunky with a bitter hop edge to it. It leaves a decent head but it's pretty irrelevant with this beer as it does not contribute to the smell or flavor really. It's really easy to drink. great summertime sessions beer (but keep it in the can). and easy to transport in a cooler. Do yourself a favor get in it in the can!. and pour some out for your four legged friend."
"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, malts, some sweetness. Taste is a pleasant surprise, malts are abundant, however there is a nice hop balance. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a very easy drinking beer and a great value for the price."
"D - Not a very good brew. I tried it hoping for a classic, but it fell short of that."
"I'll part company with the bros. on this one and just say that this is a pretty bad beer. It pours a pretty pale color with a small but decent white foamy head that does retain a bit. No lacing. The nose has a sharp mustiness to it and a slightly lagery aroma. The head isn't all that enticing. The taste is a bit oily but sharp and tart with some off soury notes, with some watery grains lurking underneath. There is a cooked veggie flavor to this beer and it isn't good. I've had enough and I can't think of too much to recommend this beer."
"D- Not bad for the price (4.99$ 6pk bottles). Nothing special, but respectable none the less."
"Comes in half quarts, thats pretty neat. I paid one dollar and twenty five cents. I sort of like this, I didnt want to, but oddly enough I'm drinking this beer, and am happy about it. Smells pretty skunky though and grainy. The skunky but its also very well malted. Get a hint of aluminum, but not too much. The brewery has been around for a very long long time in the US, so it has to be good right? Well honestly its a whole lot better than anything coors or AB puts out. Very nice mouthfeel, and easy drinking... I guess a go to beer. I cant find anything about the abv on the internets.... go figure..."
"Gold colored beer with a fluffy white head that fades very quickly.Aroma and taste to me are both macro like and I think that's a good thing.I bought a 12 pack of 40's for 24.00 which seems to be a decent buy.It's crisp and refreshing a perfect summertime beer!!"
" Tastes good. It almost tastes like a Corona if Corona was good. But this beer is much better. Now this is an ale but alot of people think it tastes a little like some lagers. The taste was good with a nice balance of sweetness which I can detect and some hops which I can detect even with my limited skills. I can detect some malted something but I am developing my skills so one day I will do a re-review."
"Drinkability: I'm impressed. This is a definite go-to session beer. This one is definitely ideal for warm weather. I feel this could be one of those ""gateway beers"" when trying to convince friends that there is more to the world of beer than Bud and Coors light, also at a very affordable price."
"Old school favorite."
"Grabbing a 6-pack of 16-oz. Ballantine's would make a great companion for say, a fishing outing or to throw in the cooler for a trip to the beach. It's got that certain old school novelty feel to it, but is actually a decent brew."
"was having nostalgia for this beer for some reason though i ve drank less then a case of this in my life . bought a 40 since they had no six packs let it sit a day . for some reason this beer has never smelled good but its the taste that counts right . poured it into my pint glass nice looking head but first yellow beer i drank in i dont know when . taste excellent . might have to stock up on this stuff im sure my 60 dollar a week beer bill will go down and still have a great tasting beer ale whatever"
"The aroma is Soda water, yeast, corn, funk, and metal. The appearance is pale gold with a decent head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is watery. Overall it's not good. You can do much better than this but of course most of us are just getting a rating."
"Had this one before, figure I'll drink it (or pour it, depends how this goes...) to remove it from the cellar. Instant skunkitude from the pour and first whiff. Damned green bottles... The taste isn't much better, there's really nothing there except for a watery, skunky taste. The rest of this is getting dumped, not worth it..."
"""America's Largest Selling Ale"" the lime green can told me. Why did I doubt this... out of the half quart of metal this beer was a pale gold color with a tremendous three finger head of cream foam. The retention was average and it left chunks of scattered albeit thin lacing. The aroma was slightly musty and dry, typical American macro lager, very grainy and very generic. The flavors were better, at first a flash of semi-sweet pale malt with a nice grainy center that faded into a bitter, leafy hop finish that was crisp and rather refreshing. The body was medium, the carbonation perfect and smooth and the mouthfeel very pleasant but a little oily. Much better than I was expecting and/or the aroma suggests."
"D- This is a classic ""old school"" beer, one which I am proud to keep in my beer fridge on a regular basis, don't just save this one for mowing your lawn."
"When I read ""America's largest selling Ale"" on the bottle I thought I was doomed. It's not that bad though. It's golden in color with initially a pretty thick white head that tapers away but a thin head stays. A slightly floral aroma but not much to it. Taste is slightly sweet malt with a very mild hop balance. Easy enough to drink and relatively refreshing, notching it one step above standard crap swill."
"D: Basic macro lager, but it goes down like water."
"MF&D - Thin bodied with pleanty of carbonation to give you tongue a slight sizzle. A great old school CLASSIC brew. Much better than any of the U.S. macros and you get a little puzzle under the cap to work on while you enjoy your brew, what more can you ask for. Hears a link that give you the answers : http://www.jokelibrary.net/yyDrawings/bottle_caps.html"
"Mouthfeel was medium to light bodied. Zesty carbonation with some slickness. This is an APA but it surely resembles a smaller market macro lager like Iron City."
"This old favorite is something I don't see too often any more, especially in a can so I had to run a quick review. The color is fairly consistent with the bottle, dirty gold with a fair white head and a little lace. The aroma is a little anemic but there is a mild hops bitterness present. It has a smooth light citrus and grass hops flavor. A little dry at the end, tastes similar to the bottle. An easy drinking option and very refreshing as always. Fine."
""
"I highly recomend giving this fine old type American Ale a try, I am glad after all these years I revisited it."
"It poured with a finger's worth of bone-white head that reduced to wisps in no time at all. The color was a bright, light gold with NE-quality clarity. The nose had an interestingly sharp hoppiness to it, not quite as snappy as Saaz, but still sharp. The mouthfeel was medium with a light hop flavor on the tongue. The finish was dry and refreshing. I am a sucker for the ""old school"" beers and I often take Ballantine to tailgate parties when I cannot find Iron City."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Thin and watery in the mouth...overall very disappointing. This is a beer I'll never come back to. If you're looking for a craft beer, it can not be found here. Maybe if this beer was actually made from barley malt instead of rice it would have some flavor and weight to it...but alas."
"Drinkability is solid overall, I only bought one this time, but I could see this as a great 6-pack to accompany a social activity."
"There's not much else here that would fit the style. It's drinkable but thin at the same time. I've seen much, much better pale ales out there."
"."
"Pours a clear golden color with a medium and fizzy white head that dissipates steadily. Stringy lacing. Grainy malt aroma with some corn and weird-smelling hops. Light-bodied with tart sour fruit, earthy malt and light hops. The finish is more grain and malt, with an off-tasting hops aftertaste. Very one dimensional and barely above a drain pour."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a small head that dissipates quickly and leaves little or no lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Has a fairly faint aroma to it, sightly grainy at best with a hint of hops. The taste was a little less than I expected. Once again, very grainy with the slight taste of hops to give it some balance. Kind of a boring taste. Has a light mouthfeel to it with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, not that impressive of a beer, try one if you can't find anything better."
"Better than Bud Light, not as good as Miller High Life."
"Drinkability: This would be a nice summertime beer."
"Love the color and design of the Ballantine can."
"(Approx $2.50 / 40 oz. green screw top bomber)"
"Pours very light, almost yellow, and clear with no head to speak of. Immediate funky hop aromas tickle my nose, along with some acrid sweetness and corn grains. On the palate, pretty sweet up front with corn flavors, with just a touch of carbonation and bitterness for bracing. The finish is only off-dry, and this beer sticks to your mouth with that macro aftertaste that I can't describe any better than that. Light in mouthfeel, average for a macro. Overall, this is certainly a macro style beer, but I find it strangely compelling. I would actually drink this if no better options were available. It's pretty smooth, has a bit of sweetness and, in spite of the obvious presence of grain adjuncts, isn't a corn bomb like a certain popular Mexican beer. Not too bad."
"12oz green bottle obtained at the local Hannaford. Pours a very light yellow body with a thin film of white head. Cereal grains characterize the aroma, very reminiscent of an American macro-style lager. Tastes somewhat sweet, with cereal grain and just a hint of grassy floral hops toward the finish. Very light mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. A super-easy drinker, not very challenging or heavy. Not a horrible beer but is not at all good for an APA. As a macro-style lager or a cream ale, this is a solid beer - simple, drinkable, adjunct characteristics... But this is no APA."
"Wouldn't touch this again if it was the last beer on Earth."
"The taste is sweetish malty up front with some graininess and just a wee bit of bitterness right before the finish that could easily get over looked and the finish itself? That's on the watery side and probably the weakest taste feature for this APA. I remember this brew from back in the 70's and 80's and it had a really nice hop bitterness bite to it that threw the flavours totally out of balance but that's what made it so darn tasty. I really miss that old formula but this one is pretty good as well. If I had it in my market, I'd visit it often."
"Overall it's a pretty nice beer. Much better than Yuengling, but it's really all about the brand, right?"
"Look, it's not pretty, it's not hopped to hell, and it drinking it at a party probably won't get you laid, but it's American, it's old school as shit, and I like it!"
"Fairly smooth and easy to drink. However, it really wasn't much of an APA - reminded me more of a cream ale perhaps. Anyway, there's nothing great about it - very basic. A bit too bland for me. But, again - nothing offensive - and not a terrible choice for 4 bucks a six-pack."
"Wish I hadn't wasted my $1.50 on this one. Don't you waste yours too."
"Appears a light golden tone and forms a large white head leaves fine lacing behind on the fluted glass. Aroma is of some semi skunked herbal toned hops with a touch of fruitiness among light toasted grain and an adjunct mix of corn and rice that's evident. Taste is strong with a cloying sweetness adjunct ridee with evident alcohol presence and a very low bitterness touch of mineral character and her skunked hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with fizzy carbonation. Drinkability some have a sentimental outlook on this brew not me...nothing classic about it."
"Hey its $.89 cents so I grabbed it and its America's largest selling ale....hmmm Iam guessing its not but hey who knows.It had a decent pour light gold with a 1/2 finger white head that was gone rather quickly but left a mass on top,light skunkiness from the damn green bottle and some toasted grain no trace of hops though to be found.The beer tastes mass produced somewhat cooked and vegetal-like goes down a little harsh made me wince a little going down.Eh wont get it again even if free but its an old brand glad I can say I tried it anyways."
"Pours straw with decent clarity. Fizzy one-finger head shows moderate retention but poor lacing. There is certainly some skunkiness in the nose, but it is accompanied by authentic saaz aromas as well; mild vegetal notes in the background. Pale malt and corny sweet at first sip; aftertaste is dry and presents some noble hop bitterness. Medium-high carbonation but not overly crisp, thin body but this helps it attain it's high drinkablity. Finishes mostly clean with a bit of light-struck flavor. Nicley balanced with a good use of hops; an unimpressive yet non-offending brew."
"The green bottle skunk hit me when the lid came off. I almost said, ""forget it," right then and there. But I persisted. Once the skunk wore off, it poured with a decent (though quickly disappating) head. Low carbonation, extremly light mouthful. No taste to speak of, except the skunk wore off and bit of hop bite lingered. I see why the price was less than half the others I purchased today. Not even really drinkable. If you want a hoppy, cheap ""ale," go for the Yuengling's ""Lord Chesterfield."""
"Because, after all, it is kind of refreshing. And it cost $2.75 for a sixer!"
"Surprisingly low carbination, medium gold color, one finger head with some retention. Just enough ale fruitiness to stave off excessive adjunt smell and flavor. This really takes me back, sitting beside my dad and uncle at a local tavern, and absorbing that ""old time beer"" flavor/aroma. I heard this is hopped with Cascade, and I do get some floral elements, but I mostly get earthy/grassy smell and flavor. Some sweeter malts though the middle but good bitter finish. Mouthfeel is substantial for a macro produced beer of any kind. I drank this camping last weekend and at $15.00 a case I will drink more this summer if I can get a hold of some. The one to turn to when on a budget."
"Thought it was pretty good when I thought it was a Pilsner. Now that I have learned it's a Pale Ale, I changed my mind a bit. Has a nice blend of pilsner (tasting) malts with a lightly grainy body (which is allowed in a pils). The hops add an earthy, spicy character after the skunky hop aroma subsides. The body never really reaches medium or full proportions. The hops never reach citrus levels, although there is a light green apple, light lime flavor. The malts are not really caramelized or mildly toasty. Anyhow, I'm going to pretend it's an averagely brewed pilsner."
"It's simplistic, but it's still flavorful. And sometimes, simplicity is grand."
"PS - I, too, am financially embarrassed, and find myself searching for good cheap beer. I'm brewing at home but Ballantine costs half what Dogfishhead is getting. Just sayin...."
"Feeling nostalgic I went for some Ballantine. The smell was yeasty and, surprisingly, hoppy. The color of the beer is nothing special, but more of a deeper gold than the other cheap beers. The taste is suprising, its good, very good in fact. It tastes of hops and is clean and smooth. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel with superb drinkabilty. Its clean and smooth and feels more substanial than other cheap beers. I like it, alot in fact. I think this is one of the best economy beers around. I wish it was more readily avilable."
"Nicely carbonated mouthfeel. Type of beer you would want to drink if you had to all day at a friends cook out. But otherwise I'd stray toward a pale ale or IPA."
"Pours a nice clear light gold with an ample head and some lacing. Good carbonation. Aroma is mainly grainy with a hint of grassiness, not too bad. Taste is once again grainy, but with a nice smoothness and a hint of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium, with a slight chewiness that I was not expecting. Very easy on the drinkability scale, most notably its smooth quality."
"I can't imagine this beer offending anyones pallete yet by the same token it won't light your world on fire, it sure as hell beats bud though"
"This is what an American Macrobrew lager should really taste like. Clean with an honest good level of bitterness and good taste combined with very easy on the senses intensity. The ultimate lawnmower beer I think. This is what Budweiser should try to taste like."
"The mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated, finishes clean enough though. I'd like to say that these are very drinkable, but the off-smell throws me a bit."
"Ballantine XXX Ale pours with a brilliant white head that drops leaving a bit of lace and a thin layer of foam. The aroma is certainly nothing to write home about with a little whiff of canned corn and just a hint of hop spice. Light in body and in flavor, Ballantine shows off a little bit of grassy hops, under a blanket of sweet malt and corn. The hop bitterness is just enough to prevent this beer from being too sweet. Well-carbonated, yet smooth, Ballantine's is very drinkable and remains a bit of a classic."
"It's easy drinking and does manage to encourage me to have another one, but overall...eh."
"Aroma is very light, grainy. Slight hops in the aroma, but no citrusy notes detected. First thing that hit me when tasting it was the sweetness of the malt, but it fades quickly to a dry finish. I couldn't detect much of a hop presence. Even though it says it's an ale, it definitely tastes more like a lager to me. It lacks the crisp dryness that some of the other macros tend to have. I would have preferred a 12 oz can as 16 just seems to be just enough to fatique the palate with this beer. I can only drink one of these and would have to move on to something else. I don't really think it's significantly better than any of the other macro competition out there. In my opinion, it would be best as an accompaniment with some pizza or spicy food. To have one by itself for the sole purpose of enjoying a brew, it doesn't really cut it."
"Ballantine is an American classic, even if they changed the recipe. I'm not sure if I've ever poured it into a glass. If you can get this and haven't tried it, you should. This is one of few true macros out there with any significant hop content, even if it is a weird, sour brew! I enjoy it about once a week now that I live in Brooklyn. Economical at $2 even for 40 cold ounces."
"I've only tried this stuff once before and didn't really remember what it was like. This was at my local Hannaford so why not. This is the most pale of any pale ale I have seen, barely yellow. Fuzzy white head that lasts forever. Taste? Well it actually has some pleasent hoppy flavor (not sure what kind) that does fade out pretty quick. Mouthfeel is quite thin. Overall this beer has very nice flavor and can be made into a real nice beer, regardless of any kind of macro status. If I were offered another I would take it."
"purchased as a 40 ounce green bottle with suggested retail price of $1.25 marked on it. poured a light golden color with modest white puffy head. Smell is very minimal with only a hint of sweetness to be found. Taste is also very mild, but not unpleasant. finished wet and thirst quenching. Good lawnmower beer."
"Walking the line of mediocrity. This is a drinkable brew, but beyond that, it's not much. Pours out to a medium golden color, with a fuller 1 inch head of foam and some lacing. Aroma is fresh and laden with hops and grain. Taste is a letdown. Very mild and reminiscent of bud light. Flavors of watery hops and bland malts are hidden in the background, but a stale character fills the palate mostly. Mouthfeel is weak, very light and uninspiring. Fair drinkability. This is probably best when you are dead ass tired at the end of a long summer day of working in the yard. Next time that happends to me, I'll come back to this beer. Maybe."
"This beer was not worth the 15 bucks I paid for the case. The pour was an off yellow color with a thin head that dissipated quickly. The smell was a mixture of adjunct ingredients (rice I believe), pun gent hops, and pale malts. The taste was very reflective of the smell and provided no complexity and a poor aftertaste. The mouthfeel was watery as in most macro-lagers, and the off flavor made this beer low on the drinkability scale. I tried this beer since it has been around for so long, but it was not worth the investment."
"XXX pours with a whipped white foamy head that lasts several minutes. The brew is champagne gold and has generous carbonation. Hops are quite noticeable on the nose, surprisingly the most abundant aromatic of the beer. The taste is one of sweet malt, perhaps a tad too sweet, as this distracts from the drinkability, which is still quite pleasant. As the brew hits the mouth the sweetness is easily detected, then fortunately dries quickly. Perhaps the quintessential ol' time American ale; reducing the residual sugars would add dramatically to the potential for long term multi-serving quaffing of this decent American Mucho Macro."
"This is my cheap-ass indulgence beer. Plain and simple, it's a cheap, fruity, ale and it tastes better than most macro lagers at a lower price. The can means it comes with me to the beach to sit and fish. Cannot beat that combo IMHO. Lose the skunky green bottles. Cans keep it fresher longer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slightly harsh in the mouth with the bold carbonation, yet the activity cleanses the palate to make room for the next round of fare you are serving with it. I'd suggest BBQ chicken with corn-on-the-cob. Refreshing, yet simple. For the money, you really can't beat it."
"Pours a white, four finger-head that vanishes quickly leaving traces of lace. Clear, golden amber. Light carbonation and light bodied. Nose is faintly hoppy/skunky. Starts sweet, some hops mix in, clean finish. Easy to drink when its hot like today (91). $1.19 for a 12oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"A very clean yellow beer. Has a good creamy white head and some lace. There is some light floral hops in the aroma but they were overpowered by a bit of skunk character. The taste and the mouthfeel were both a little light. With a bit of spicey hops comming thru on the finish."
"Mouthfeel was about to be expected in something mass produced like this. No great shakes. Drinkability... nope. not again."
"Wow, what a surprise! Had a few of these lurking in the fridge that my father brought. I figured it'd be interesting to try a beer from ""back in the day"". This did not disappoint. I feel as though this beer is a time capsule. Through all the years it has not given way to becoming another generic miller product with an old nostalgic name. The recipe supposedly dates back to 1820. Pours a golden yellow with a little head and some nice bubbling. Smell is slightly hoppy and crisp. Taste is wonderfully crisp and hoppy. Yes, there are hops in a beer that cost $3.99 a sixer! I know, I was as surprised as you. This would be a great beer for a hot summer day or to buy for when you gotta supply a large amount of beer for ""the guys", a game, etc. Its cheap and its satisfying. Best of all its different and will maybe get a bud drinker to realize there is more out there. Baby steps, ya know?"
"Overall-while I'm happy to report some hop flavor in the brew, the sourness I'm picking up is catastrophic. I think I have a bad bottle, I will try this beer again at a later point but for right now stay away."
"Overall - I was intrigued by this old schooler, almost never see it anywhere, but have heard some interesting comments regarding it. I stumbled upon a case of cans for $15 bucks and figured I would give it a try. I was pleased with it, its main thrust would be it has a somewhat unique flavor profile when compared to other macro styles."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a grainy pale malt scent with some hops and a green bottle skunkiness. It is dry to the nose. The taste is decent also. It has a clean and crisp pale malt flavor with a dry slightly hoppy aftertaste. It goes down easy and finishes smooth and clean. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pleasant surprise. I bought a 40 ouncer of this thinking it would suck, but I was wrong. It drinks well and has decent flavor."
"If you see this in the cans and bottles, avoid the bottles. The cans are much better despite what my previous reviews say. Tastes change after all."
"It had a very unusual taste. I didn't like this type of beer taste back then, but now my palette is more experienced. If It makes a very good sipping beer. It's very alcohol-tasting dumbed with a little foaming action that helped wash it down. I couldn't find a nasty taste in this beer. It does not come close to micro ales but for the price/quality, this is worth every penny."
"Maybe I went into this beer with unfairly low expectations, but it was a pleasant surprise. This will forever be my cheap beer of choice."
"Decided I needed to refresh the palate and this is an old faithful standby from when I was broke. Decided to relive the old days. It is a pale, piss yellow color and pours out of the can with a voluminous, foam-like head. It is a great beer for a hot, sweat-drenched day. The taste is of salty, slightly hoppy water. One can drink many of these if not careful, but I am not sure how much damage it could do."
"Medium bodied, creamy, goes down easy. Surprisingly good, I'd judge it much higher than this if I was strictly comparing it to other macros, and not as a Pale Ale."
"This is, by far, my favorite ""cheap"" beer. This is the kind of beer that is absolutely perfect when it's 90 degrees outside and you just want something that will quench your thirst. For $5.99 a six pack, it sure as hell beats out any of the other American macros. This is an ""old school"" beer in every aspect of the word. What can I say, this beer has a certain charm to it. I haven't yet figured out what that charm is, but I know it's there. Plus, this beer is a favorite of Hunter S. Thompson. So even if it's bad, it's still pretty cool. :P"
"I admit that this is a guilty pleasure of mine. It was the first ale that I ever drank, and at the time, it opened my eyes to a new taste. Unfortunately, the beer has been bought a number of times, and is not quite the same as it was back then. I can still drink it, and considering the cost and the fact that it is a macro-brew, it is drinkable. It is best out of the bottle and very cold. The beer is a darker yellow than a regular macro with a nice white head that fades quickly. There is little aroma to speak of, but the taste is predominately grainy with a little hops at the end. It has a crisp, clean though thin feel in the mouth. The beer is a nice drinkable beer that I like at picnics or with pizza. I indulge a couple times a year in a sixer. It's sort of comfort beer as opposed to comfort food."
"I ran across one of these because my friend's dad was feeling nostalgic. He said he remembered drinking these 30 years ago. It came in a green bottle. I poured a bit out to see its color- macro yellow, maybe a little darker, with good carbonation and a wispy little white head that faded quickly. The smell is of light malts and faint bitterness. The beer is very clean and refreshing when sipped (I preferred them right out of the bottle). It has a medium body, and faint corn adjunct taste. The aftertaste is tart, and might be due to a strange hop blend. This isn't really a pale ale, and the hops are so minimal I wouldn't even really call it such. Very macro in fashion, but also in price. I'd take these over many others in the price region. Good for a BBQ."
"Very crisp in terms of smell and taste. Solid mouth feel but only slightly better than I expected. Light corn yellow with a small head that didn't last at all. Seems to be a nice hint of bitterness that runs through this beer. Smooth, thirst quenching and very easy to drink. The can does give it a bit of a metallic taste, but nothing too overpowering. A good choice for venues that don't allow glass."
"I first heard of Ballantine's when reading Hunter S. Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail: 1972"". He referred to it on several occaisions and called it a great little beer. At that time it was brewed in Newark. A-B bought the plant and I believe the beer is still made there. Here in NJ it is readily availble in both liquor stores and bars. It's not bad on tap either. And, as others have stated: at $.80 a bottle it's easy on the pocket as well."
"Wow, this is such a great ""cheaper"" beer. I had always seen it in the store, but was reluctant to try it. I was doing myself a huge injustice. The appearance was a cloudy straw color with a nice firm head. The head was thick at first, but then died out to a laceing. The smell was nothing great, just your average hops, grains, and a little malts. The taste was quite pleasing with it's creamy texture, which was also it's big point in mouthfeel. The taste had elements of the hops and tinge of malts, but also had the feel of a yeastyness to it, as well as a sweet undertone. Overall a nice little brew. The only bad thing about this beer is that it's hard as hell to find anywhere. Hopefully it will oneday enjoy the success of a comeback as PBR has lately."
"I got this at some New Jersey liquor store, and it was definitely a surprise. It came in a clear 40 oz. bottle, and had XXX written on it, which made me a little cautious, but I sampled it objectively. A hazy gold color, almost no head, 'cause I drank it straight from the bottle. It tasted very good for what it cost. Almost flavored like a cider, it had a clean, dry taste. I wish they sold this in Minnesota, because if there was a ranking for value, this would get a 5."
"Very, very drinkable brew and represents itself well for a cheap beer. I think this would definitely be better in a can without the skunky aroma. (Can reviews seem to uphold this theory.)"
"Hmmm, the skunked aroma truly detracts from the taste. When one gets by the smell, the taste is very nice, more malty and smooth than one would expect, with flavors of mild fruit, and a slight hop bite toward the end."
"I'd drink this over a Bud or Coors any day. If they could do something with the aroma, I'd even recommend it. But not as is."
"The flavor is sweet and grainy and has a oiliness to it, along with hints of fruit. The flavors linger and stick to the throat. This is a flavorful light ale which is very drinkable. I like it."
"Once upon a time, at least twenty years ago, this was a great beer. It was the first one that I ever had on draught in Newark NJ in 1973. The current horror is only a poor shadow of its former self, Reviews shouldn't soley consider its present degenerate state, but rather give some tribute to its past glory. It was a contender."
"Well I had to try it after reading that it's the last of the true American macro ales, and reading about its history. There is a rebus inside the bottle cap. I thought only Haffen-wrecker did that. Pours from the bottle a deep golden color, with a half-inch foamy white head. Aromas of pine and citrus, very fresh smelling. Carbonation hits the tongue pretty hard, but there's no flavor on the front of the tongue. Then that intense flavor rolls down the sides and back of the tongue. The best I can describe it is that it tastes like the smell of shoe polish. There is a distinct sulphur aftertaste, and a bitter flavor that sticks in the back of the throat and lingers. I had to pour out the last third of the glass. The reason that this was so many Dads' beers is because the poor guys had no other choice back then. Go out and buy your Dad a real beer, and take away his Ballantine."
"Although a simple ale, I found this to be enjoyable and somewhat interesting. The skunk didn't totally kill it and it was definitely thirst-quenching. For a mass produced ale, this does have a more pronounced flavor than BudMillerCoors, and has some ale qualities. So go ahead and make the three ring sign!"
"Pours a pale straw / golden color, with a thin white lace. On the nose there is a slight citric aroma and hints of some grains. Just about the same on the palate, slight graininess, citrus, fizzy mouthfeel, slight fruit hints/sweetness, weak malt profilepretty crisp"
" One of my favorite 40 oz. as a kid you could get 2 (40's) and a bag of chips for $5.00 not a bad deal!"
"[now that I work in a liquor store I buy them from the back of the cooler where they are kept away from light]"
"My uncle used to tell me ""no one beer is better than two beers."" I guess he was refering to this ""beer"". Typical old man's beer, but with a different clientel. Flashier than say, miller or schlitz, but it's the same deal. Tastes like someone dipped an ear of corn in water to give it it's taste"
"Big, clumpy white head with respectable retention.  Clear with a straw-colored appearance.  Slightly sweet with nice hop balance.  No real flaws, very well-made.  Suprisiningly tasty for such an inexpensive beer."
"A perfectly refreshing hot-weather beer, but drink it cold.  Like many beers of this type, it gets nasty if you let it warm up."
"This is one of those old-line beers that folks seem to like because they have fond associations of it as the beer dad drank or what they drank in college.  I have no emotional attachment to the beer.  I wish I did, I might be able to say something positive about it.  Aroma - green bottle, enough said.  Astringent up front, a little peppery at the tip of the tongue.  Cereal malt middle, and a blah hops finish.  Not even my lawnmower makes me thirsty enough to want another."
"I've found my new ""have in the fridge at all times"" summer brew."
"For $5.00 a six-pack of 16 oz cans this is not too bad. Come August when it is 99*F with 100% humidity this may be a beer I resort to."
"The can version is of course inferior but the bottled variety is great.  a great beer to watch baseball to as it once was the official beer of Yankee Stadium.  Pop the cap and look for the anagram under the lid."
