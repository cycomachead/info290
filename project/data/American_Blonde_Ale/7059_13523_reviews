"It was ok. Smelled funny but didn't taste bad"

"Clear golden purity in the glass. Pours with minimal head. Tastes like cereal, a lot like wheaties or total."

"Alamo Golden Ale suffices as is, but a few more handfuls of C-hops would provide it with more of the ""piercingly independent spirit"" it boasts of. It is a simple ale well-suited to the hot Texas climate. To be sure, however, the Lone Star state has enough new craft breweries that residents should probably forget about the Alamo and move to greener pastures."

"Not much to stir the imagination here. I guess I have to admit this is quite drinkable, but it's no better than the average Blonde. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Texas Wine Cellars in Fredericksburg, TX."

"Overall a nice beer to drink outside on a nice warm day, I'd drink a couple."
"Light mouthfeel and very easy to drink. Very solid overall and could definitely see this being a regular in my fridge if available to me."

"Not a bad beer for Alamo. It's weird, the label says this is a Real Ale beer...possibly Alamo is an off shoot? Would like to see more outta these guys...always willing to give the Texas breweries my business."
"My biggest issue is that a beer this easy to drink should be canned so you can take it to the lake and on your fishin' boat. It's pretty tasty stuff. I just made a blonde ale that I am hoping comes out this light and tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Overall Impression: As I said above, do NOT drink this “ice cold” or you will be sorely disappointed. This needs to warm up a bit to fully come alive and deliver to you a very solid golden ale that may not offer you a lot of surprises, it definitely gets the job done and does it well."
""

"Overall Impression- A very pleasant Golden ale that still had character and a nice taste to keep this above average. Thanks for the share Laura!"

"I have seen this bottle several times before buying one as a part of a mix and match your own sixpack. THis was the only of the six that was not an IPA and that was because coming from San Antonio, I have an affinity for the Alamo and Texas in general (five of the six were Texas brews). I struggled to figure out where in the world this beer came from. THe label indicated it is a product of Real Ale Brewing in Blanco, bu the website is a completely different company, so obviously Real Ale must be contract brewing for them while they build up the brand. I am a huge Real Ale fan and consider Fireman's Four (SMaSH brew or not) the best lawnmower beer around. Since I am firmly in camp with Real Ale I cannot falt their technique and must fault the recipe for what turned out to be a dissapointing experience. The brew is crystal clear, and pours with a slight head if agitated which leaves light lacing, but the hop profile is almost non-existant and reminded me of a BMC rather than blond ale (like Fireman's Four). THe malt is strangely out in front and does not seem well balanced with any bittering hops I could distinguish. I prefer a blond ale with a light malt body that is subtle and there mostly to support about 25 IBUs, but this seems closer to 5 or 6."

"Overall - an okay drinker"

"Overall: Not a bad beer, if you don't mind a smooth but salty beer. I hesitate to say it was bitter. It really wasn't and the bitterness was felt mostly in the aftertaste. All in all, a beer you would expect out of Texas. But I'm Texan, so I'm biased."
"This beer is a nice change of pace from the heavier abby ales, stouts, IPAs, and other meal beers. It is what the American mainstream beers should be: light yet flavorful. Its honeysuckle nose, light sweet taste, and low alcohol content are perfect for those times when you're ready for a brew but not a buzz. The only fault I find is its slight over carbonation."
"This is—although it pains me to say it—an utterly forgettable golden ale. (Why does it pain me? Because it’s a local microbrew and I wanna give some love to the home team.) It is not the same recipe as Real Ale’s Firehouse 4, although until they open their own facilities it’s contract brewed in Blanco."

"Color is golden with a slight haze. Head is white a thin foam with moderate retention. Lacing is minimal and splotchy. The nose has some sweetness to it. Lemongrass, orange and some pepper spice. Getting just a small amount of bitter hops in there as well. Just like the taste. Sweet upfront with a bitter middle that sort of even out towards the finish. All previous characters are still present. The mouth feel is very refreshing. Just under medium bodied with crisp carbonation. Not bad at all. This one is a bit above average. A good drinking beer. Great for summer weather no doubt."
""

"Blonde tilting toward amber. Moderate malt aspect, with some mildly sweet grain notes closely followed by an equally moderate hops presence. Not a bad representation of the style, although a tad less smooth than the frontrunners in the category and fell a little short of what I would want in a session ale."
""
""
"Finally a beer that stands out among most Texas beers...a little strongly hopped, but not too much. I especially liked the alamo name.."" King of the hill ""...I think Hank Hill would enjoy this one...hypothetically speaking. Boy I tell you what."
"This is a great starter beer in the Ale category. That's probably why it can cause some confusion. For folks who don't care too much for a strong finish this is good. I would say it's in the middle. Overall, it's a great Texas beer I would definitely recommend it to beer novices looking to take a step up."

"Now for the part that matters, taste. It's very delicious for a blonde ale. It's yeastier than I'd normally like, but it's pleasant somehow. It's a pleasantly fruity yeastiness that is well balanced by the hops. And the taste is fresh as well. All around great stuff. Not my favourite style, but if I'm going to drink a blonde, this is going to be it. Sure beats Shiner's."
""
""
"I like this beer a lot. It's got a good deal of flavor, but it's surprisingly refreshing. Exceptionally well balanced."
""
"O: Exceeded my expectations."

"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice color, and a substantial head which lingers, and some nice lacing. Nose is a very stout grainy tone with some pepper and citrus. Flavor, also very grainy. Fresh baked bread with hints of the sweet citrus and a bit of bitterness to balance it out. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Very average at best. I think that is pretty much the point of this beer though. Even so, not a lot going on to keep me interested."
"Taste is grainy and fresh with a light hint of fruity yeast. Biscuity and there is still a hint of pecan nuttiness. Hops are a no-show on the palate. Not bad by any means, but totally and utterly forgettable. It is just slightly above average for a blonde ale. The fresh, grainy malt flavors are the saving grace here."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer. I am not a big fan of their hop-bill, but that is just personal preference. Overall the balance is pretty good, and it is a pretty well made beer without any fermentation flaws or anything. This is the last beer out of a 6-pack that I got, and I may come back to it someday...but will probably pick up a number of other beers first."
"Poured into a tall pilsner, good head about 2 fingers that dissipated slowly with consistent lacing. Immediately noticed caramel smells and a toffee, caramel, nutty taste. Similar to a St. Arnold's amber but with less body. Good beer to pair with spicy, light foods, or grilled meats. Refreshing and super, super cheap. Picked up a 6er at HEB for 7 bucks."
"i really like this beer but im having a hard time finding alot to say. pick one up for yourself."
"Taste left some to be desired. The malts and hops were well balanced enough but the aftertaste was not terribly pleasant. There was a slight adjunct taste to this beer. Does not compare to other blonde ales I've had, even though it wasn't horrible."
"Pretty good beer, worthwhile on a summer day. I enjoyed it, but I would rather try something new next time."
"Overall Drinkability - This beer has some good aspects but the cardboard finish ruins the drinkability."
"It's very refreshing beer. Very drinkable and sessionable. Only thing lacking is the flavor, otherwise it's a good summer's beer."
"Easy to drink on a hot San Antonio evening, and enough flavor to satisfy."
"This pours a dull yellow golden color under a sparsley spotted thin film head layer. There is a restrained but pleasant aroma of sweet malt , honey, and lemon citrus. This is a mouth awakening experience a top other blonde styles I've tried. It opens up with a somewhat puckering sour and sweet lemon bitterness and makes way to a sudden robust malt center and a smooth refreshing finish. There's also a significant amount of visible sediment that collects at the bottom of the glass. Robust, refreshing, and perfect for those hot summer days in Texas."
"Overall I would not buy this beer again on tap, but was worth trying once. I would recommend this beer to someone who wanted a simple beer with drinkability. Next time I will have to try Alamo in a bottle to see if there is a difference; maybe it taste better that way?"
"Drinkability: A simple, light beer designed for simple, light refreshment, and, in that duty, it does fine, I suppose. Remember the Alamo, though you may have trouble remembering this brew down the road."
"Easy to drink, better than expected."
"On tap at the airport in San Antonio, clear golden yellow. Smells boooring. The taste is actually pretty good, crisp, slight bit of lemon, not too bad! Extremely easy to drink , would order again but fortunately I will probably never have to go back to Texas!"
"As the description says, it will help put out the fire, but so will a tall glass of ice water."
"A good looking beer, didn't match it in the taste."
"Taste starts a little musky with some notes of clove, but it's watery there is also a little sweetness to it, the finish is dry."
"This beer actually delivered more than I was expecting. It's fuller and more robust than I imagined it. Still, that's not to say that I would go out of my way to drink this beer again, because I wouldn't. But it was somewhat better than I expected it to be, and that's always a good thing. Worth trying, if you're working your way through all the beers in Texas."
"Alamo Ale, of course, being in San Antonio for the first time, I had to try it. I was a bit disappointed, as I thought it could definitely be better. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. It poured a clear, slightly-darker-than-straw color, with a decent head on it that hung around a little bit. Smell was of light malts and a touch of hops. Flavor followed suit. A decent hit of malts, blended with a light flavor of hops. Produces a clean and crisp flavor and mouthfeel. It's nothing spectacular, but it's a decent ale. It could be improved with only a little work. However, that said, given the Alamo theme, my feeling is that it's more targeted towards the average beer drinker who's visiting Texas and gets pulled in by the novelty of the label. Still, it's worth a try. I could see it being a great hot-summer-day type beer. Better than a macro lager."
"A no frills beer. I believe this is brewed by Real Ale Brewing according to the bottle. Contract brewed?"
"What a fun idea - I love the Alamo. But is this the best we can drink to drink to the Alamo? Refreshing and light? Yes. Tasty? No, not really. I assume this brew is targeted to more-of-your-average-beer-drinker-crowd-type persons, but why cant it taste better? It is just shy of good."
"Drank really easy, suprised I didn't see it around more down by the riverwalk. Give this a chance!"
"Overall a nice offering, and I'll keep this one in mind when spring rolls around again."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This is a very drinkable brew. Quite a nice surprise from a blonde ale."
"From a beer trade, first time I've heard of this, hopefully this will be distributed back east. Pours a hazy golden orange color. Smell is of light citrus. Taste is a citrusy hop flavor quite like graprfruit which fades out quite quickly. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than expected. But overall this is a really great beer to drink, reminds me of a more flavorful summer ale. I think this is the only style Alamo makes, hopefully they will branch out a bit more."
"Picked this up just before leaving SA on the way back to IL. Had to wait more than 24 hours before trying. I wish I'd had a chance to sample a draft version, but this one is a very drinkable ale. One I will definitely get again next time in the River City."
"This beer makes for a good session ale."
"The beer I am drinking looks the same as in the picture. I don't know if this is the same ""Alamo"" beer I tried at the Menger hotel in San Antonio (going on two years ago) or a completely new concoction. The alamobeer website only furthered my befuddlement."
"Comments - Although the beer has many positive characteristics, I am not really fond of it. This would make a good summer beer."
"Overall Impression: Very enjoyable. Refreshing and clean, this is a great summer session or lawnmower. I think the label and name are a bit gimmicky, but what ever it takes to get Real Ales product out there. Strongly recommended!"
"Alamo Golden is a hazy golden orange in color. Head is white and frothy. The aroma is a fairly nondescript, generic sweetness. Not bad smelling, but not much character. Taste is sweet, almost as if there is a little honey involved. There is also a distinct herbal, tea-like taste towards the middle of the sip. Finish is a lingering combination of sweet malts and herbal flavor. Drinkability is very good, this is a nice lighter ale for sessioning. Still this beer isn't nearly as good as the other Real Ale offerings I've sampled."
"The bar staff along the Riverwalk couldn't tell me anything about the Brewer. I began to suspect contract brewing."
"This beer is a slightly hazy, dirty gold with a small, white, foamy head. The aroma is nutty, a little sour, a little wheaty, a little floral. The front is tangy, fruity and floral. The fizzy middle is fruity, light and a little milky. The finish is very roasty and nutty, with some nice bitterness and a little more fruit. Delicious. A long, lingering grainsy aftertaste. Apple burps. It's a nice, flavorful, nutty blonde. I like it a lot."
"Alamo in a bottle pours with a quickly dissipating head and is a rich gold. There are slight citrus notes and some floral hops in the nose. This is a great for those that like some character in their beer without going over the top in any of the aspects. While this is not terribly light, it is a summery beer with a decent balance. A little hay and orange peel in the aftertaste."
