The nose comprises light orange zest, mild brett-like funk, light wheat, and a smidgen of bold banana. A strong whiff of lemon zest wafts up as the beer warms. The taste holds notes of waxy lemon rind, light brett-ish funk, dirt, and a vague but sharp bitterness that pervades the finish and malingers a bit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, I found the odd bitterness to be too much to overcome here, especially considering the style. Not my cup o' tea.","TMoney2591","Oct 19, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, fruit, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. While this was fairly nice for the style, nothing on it really stood out from anything else I’ve had. I really wish it would have been a little more complex here if I am completely honest. The earthy characters going on here were definitely the dominate aspect going on.

It features pale malt, an ever so slight touch of honey, and a prominent bitterness perhaps from the hops. That said, it certainly isn't hoppy.

The aroma is full of earthy, piney hops with a little zesty citrus, grainy malts, and some yeast. The body is in the medium range but kind of acidic.

Imagine the light, airy, yeasty aroma of bread in a hearth coasting through the air on a summer's day. Take that bright, light malty tone and imagine the staccato notes of grapefruit and pine from a lingering hop presence. The taste is exactly like the scent. It is a perfect summer beer to me. The mouthfeel is spectacular. It leaves a pleasant thickness at the back of the mouth and finishes a bit dry with the hops.

Crisp, clean flavor though with light hints of clove and heather that sat on top of a base that resembled mostly light fruits and hints of grain.

3.86,-3,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Pours light a light translucent orange. The keyword there is translucent, light passes through but there isn't really any clarity to speak of. Mostly hop bitterness on the nose, nothing terribly exciting here. First thing I detect is a bready flavor, but the hops come through at the finish. Ultimately there doesn't seem to be too much going on with this beer, but that's fine as nothing about it offends the palate. Really, I feel like I could keep drinking it all night... too bad I've only got one.","CaptainNomihodai","Jan 23, 2011"
4.12,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Medium thick body, sharply carbonated with a grainy and citric hop finish. Flavor has a strong biscuit and bready malt body with a smooth, though not particularly bitter, green hop taste. More of an APA than a Blonde, the hops though well balanced by the malt body are still potent and aggressive. A solid all around offering, but not quite as exciting as Double Sunshine is.","yourefragile","Jan 13, 2011"
4.18,5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Taste is awesome, generally I find blonde ales to be pretty 'meh' but this is very well done, the C hops really give this something to work with, it's bitter and sweet while still being very easy drinking and smooth. The mouthfeel is spot on, a bit thick with light carbonation, theres a bitter finish that rounds it out well.","kingcrowing","Dec 29, 2010"

4.35,9.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: My third beer by this brewery and I continue to be impressed. This has got to be one of the easiest drinking beers of all time. Thanks again Michael. Please keep the Lawson's beers coming!","scottfrie","Dec 05, 2010"
4.22,6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"A big thanks to jedwards for breaking this out. Bottle #98 out of #168. Pours a beautiful orange-gold with a semi-hazy clarity; no head on this one. Nose is light and citrusy on a pale malt backbone. Taste follows nose with a pleasant piny/citrusy hops character in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation. Not a big complex beer, but perhaps the best example of the style I've had the opportunity to try to date. Easy drinking and quite flavorful; I would drink this all the time if it were more readily available.","Jwale73","Nov 14, 2010"
3.88,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer is light bodied, well carbonated and has a nice bitter, dry finish. The 6% abv is well incorporated into the flavors, this one is very drinkable, I was I had more than one bottle.","rpstevens","Nov 12, 2010"
3.9,-2,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a golden color with a hint of peach. There is a one-finger white head with some spotty lacing. The nose brings some grains and quite a bit of fresh hops. There is a bit of light Amarillo-like hops. Fresh and a bit of green hops. There are also some light pine and floral notes. Definite fresh hop flavor with some floral and herbal notes. Light to medium body and quite drinkable.","Thorpe429","Oct 29, 2010"
3.95,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Slightly darker than your typical blonde ale. The hop character does not jump out in the smell, but is definitely present when you take a drink. I typically expect (and love!) lots of hops in the Lawson's beer but this one is more mellow. Overall a nice take on a blonde ale, very refreshing beer with a nice balanced hop/malt profile to it. Would love to have a stock of these available during the summer months.","bbenvenuti","Aug 11, 2010"
4.68,17.6,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Wow. This certainly is a knockout for the style. At 6.1%, it's the big sister to Papelblonde. I can't really think of much else that could top this style-wise. Kudos to Sean for yet another excellent style interpretation!","Brad007","Beers"

4.33,8.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Big citrus notes with good balancing malt character. Golden straw color with off white head. If I could get this in a six pack it would always be in my fridge. Not sure if this really should be called a blonde but regardless I its too good to not get high marks. More to come from notes laters.","UA8","Beers"
4.03,1.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy gold color with a one finger white head with good retention leaving patchy lacing. Aromas of lemon, biscuity malt and wheat. Light malty flavors with noble hop flavors with a lemony bite to it. High carbonation, light body there is a clean crisp mouthfeel with an extra dry finish.","scottg","0"
