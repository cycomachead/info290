"Didn't enjoy the taste, not as sweet as it could have been. May have been an old bottle."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 9/3/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, pear, wheat, cracker, biscuit, honey, coriander, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, pear, wheat, cracker, biscuit, honey, coriander, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, pear, wheat, cracker, biscuit, honey, coriander, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a goood malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected for 5%. Overall this is a very nice blonde ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall (2.96) : A bit sickly and disgusting, although still relatively crafty. I keep wanting to say its like High Life with some bad honey lemon added to it. I expected  more honey sweetness. Instead I got an adjunct lager taste honey hops and soap. Maybe I set my soaps, er...hopes too high. With that being said I'm sure it pairs with certain foods in a good way. As for the remainder, down the drain it goes. It served its purpose."

"Overall: this a decent, light, refreshing summer beer. Not outstanding, but good nonetheless."

"Pours a pretty golden color with a thin white head. Lots of lacing is seen which each sip which settles back down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of pale malts with some honey sweetness. The taste is about the same with a hint of white pepper with the right amount of honey. Goes down very easy with no harsh after taste. Perfect carbonation. This is a great blonde ale that isn't over done."

"O: It may not be interesting or complex, but it's good and it's refreshing. Definitely recommended, especially on a hot summer day."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a two finger white head that dissipates slowly to a thin cap and heavy ring around the edges. Aroma of light bready malt, grassy hops and a hint of sourness. Flavor is biscuit malt, light honey and grassy hops, finishing with grassy hop bitterness. Light flavored and otherwise unremarkable, but redeemed somewhat by the light honey in the background."

"There is a slight brisk hoppy taste with a slight bitter aftertaste. A hint of resin and something herbal. Not much to get excited about, but a decent representative of the style. A little honey and flowers in the nose. From the 12 oz bottle bought at AJ's Fine Foods in Phoenix."
"Poured this American Blonde Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear yellow color, produced a nice white head, decent retention and a nice amount of lacing left on the glass. The aroma consisted of pale malt, white pepper and a touch of honey.Medium bodied, easy to drink there was a foundation of pale malt, sweet honey and fruitiness. Dry finish. Overall, decent summer brew but there is nothing that makes this beer stand out."

"I love a lighter beer for the warmer weather that has some taste to it other than corn mash. This one fits the bill nicely, and I will definitely seek this out again."

"O- Not great. Below average. Avoid."

"Pours a semi-clear amber color with a slight but fast diminishing head. Scent is sweet with wheat and hints of honey. Taste is light, refreshing, and smooth. The texture is decent for a summer beer, but could perhaps still be a bit thicker. The taste is sweet with malts and honey. For a summer beer, it’s not to bad but Big Sky does have better made beers on the market."
"One of the many ""easy-drinking"" summer seasonals that shows up every year. Like most, this doesn't offer much in flavor, but what it has is pleasant. Subtle spicing sets it apart some. Light caramel honey sweetness, interesting herbal spicy twang from the hop/spice combo. Clean and light on the palate. Nice enough, I can't put my finger on any single spice which helps keep it mildly interesting."
""
"A decent little summer beer from ""the last best place"". Nothing outstanding, but worth a taste or two."

"O- Very good. Certainly adds something in taste to the concept of a summer beer (innovative)."
""
""
"O- Another great beer by Big Sky, my second favorite brewery. This is delicious, and the perfect amount of sweetness makes this a great session beer."
""
""
"O- Overall, this has been my least favorite offering from Big Sky Brewing."
"Overall - I usually don't favor honey beers but this stuff tastes great. It's very drinkable and I hope to find it again some day."

""

"12oz bottle, pours golden with a thin white head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing on the glass. Aromas are biscuity, sweet, faint honey. Tastes are sweet, malty, honey, biscuit, some spice, and trace herbal hop on the finish. Mouth-feel is thin-to-medium with moderate carbonation. Overall, definitely sessionable, but pretty standard for the style."

"Big Sky Summer Honey Ale is a good choice for a refreshing summertime brew."
""
""
"Dr: Drinkable but forgettable. I might try it again on draught if I'm feeling squirrelly but otherwise I'll just avoid this in the future. This was the fourth and final beer I had from their variety pack; I see no reason to have anything from this brewery in the future unless it comes naturally to me. They seem to be pretty shite."

"At first I was a bit confused by the honey, but it grew on me very quickly. This is really one of the best uses of honey I've encountered in quite some time. I'm note sure if it's what I want in a summer beer, but it works quite well right now as I'm drinking it in October."
"This is a drinkable and light ale that would definitely be a good one to quaff at a summer party. I found it to be pretty unremarkable, but solid none the less."
"nice and hopped, grassy with some decent touches of light citrus and pine mixed in. A biscuit like bready middle to it that really came out once it warmed up. The flavor was more of the same, crisp and clean, with a quick hitting citric hop bite. Crisp and clean"
"O: Overall I liked it, and im happy about the montana mixer purchase."
"Pours a clear golden yellow hue which leaves a two finger frothy head and sporadic lacing,the smell is average and has aromas of grains,bready sweet malts and herbal hops but very uninspiring,the mothfeel is light bodied and dissapointing with tastes of honey,lemon zest,grains and finished with a spicy herbal hoppy dryness and overall its below par with an average mouthfeel that doesnt suit and would not buy again cheers."
"An interesting concoction. Enjoyable but not especially memorable. Certainly a good summer option if you're looking for something a little different."
"Pours a semi-clear light orange with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a thin film. Foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and some spice notes. Taste is of toasted malt, honey, and spices. There is a slight bitterness on the tongue after each sip that lingers for a bit. A good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but not something I would buy more of."
"Overall it's tasty and I would like to get it in cans for a day of fishin'."
"Overall this beer was pretty boring. There are many summer honey style beers I prefer over this one. I wouldn't get this again."
"Under the cap – “If yer gonna be stoopid, ya gotta be tough!” This brew poured up a clear golden body with a one-finger head (from a somewhat vigorous pour). Retention was minimal reducing down to a bubbly film on top with minimal lacing effects. Smell- Lots of sweet honey and spices throughout. Served ‘fridge-cold’. Scents and flavors of honey (duh!) and various spices and very little detection of hops or malts throughout."
"It does go down very well on a hot, hot night. Probably a good gateway beer from Macro beers to craft brew. Other than that, I look for something with a little more action."
"Not great but good when it's cold."
"Pours a clear golden color with a decent two finger white head. Aromas of toasted biscuit malt and honey. Kind of reminds me a bit of honey nut Cheerios, but not in a bad way. Also picking up a bit of lemon on the end. Flavor pretty much follows suit. I remember having this beer a few years ago and not being a huge fan, but it's actually tasting pretty good to me today."
"O - This is definitely a summer session beer in my mind. There isn't anything remarkable about it, but that's OK. I think it would appeal to the BMC drinkers that you might want to try giving a little push in the craft direction."
"This beer has a light body and mouth feel from the first sip to the last swig. If you are into drinking lighter beers aka Bud, Coors, etc. this is right in your ballpark but a step up without getting all heavy on you."
"D: Will surely enjoy this one again this summer. Not overtly sweet (nor bitter). Good."
"Hump day...timed to wet the whistle with alil' Summer Honey from Big Sky. The appearance is good, crisp clear and golden with good carbonation that forms a thin white head. The nose is strong with honey, grain, and some spice. The taste is decent, good honey start polished off by a little spice/pepper taste. The mouthfeel is good and it is a fine beer to have on a summer day!"
"Taste is also rather muted, hops and honey are not relevant, sweetness is more reminiscent of corn than honey. Faintly bready. Light caramel. No development through the bottle, even as it warms. Girlfriend/intro beer."
"O- Good beer, nothing over the top crazy, but a great beer for a hot summer day. Could drink several of these"
"O: Overall, the beer was good, but it wasn't exciting. None of the flavors were very distinctive from the malt base to whichever hops were used. I would drink this beer again, but I wouldn't expect it to be memorable."
"Overall, an average beer and a below average APA that I won't remember soon as I crack the next beer. Really like some other Big Sky offerings but this one is a miss for me. Avail here in TX. Too many other offerings out there to make the rotation. [N;N]"
"D) Meh... not very impressed. I wouldn't drink another one."
"D: No real appeal here. Much better summer ales available."
"It's still summer, right? Regardless, this brew pours a clear wan gold topped by a short-lived half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light honey, light corn syrup, light flowers, and light lemonade. Did I mention the lightness? The taste brightens things up a bit, but not very much. A hint of nuttiness joins the party, along with some very light orange flesh. The body is (surprise, surprise) pretty light, with a light carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a nice light brew for summer, but I do wish there were more to it."
"One of the easiest drinking honey beer's I've had, could actually probably stomach more than just one at a time like most honey's. Thumbs up on this one."
"Pours a pale golden color with a white head. Nose brings forward a dash of honey and a little bit of mildly floral hops. Pretty plain overall, and this carries over into the taste. There is some faint honey-baked bread along with some ever so slight bitterness. Feel is light and well carbonated. No apparent defects, just nothing really going for it."
"Drinkability - very tasty brew! No lingering aftertaste and very clean in general. Easy one to come back to, and a great summer brew!"
"The taste is light, crisp, slightly sweet with honey, grain, and a biscuity-grain aftertaste. Very pleasant, smooth, light and crisp, it is highly drinkable, pleasant, and does the job well."
"Drinkability - Overall a decent beer with very little complexity. I'll admit I expected more from the makers of Moose Drool, but alas, it's just okay."
"Good beer."
"Nothing overly special, sure, but enjoyable enough when the season and occasion call for it. A good beer to go with intensely spicy hot wings, as was the pairing in my case - y'know, when in Rome, and all that."
"Tasted from 12oz bottle. Pours pale golden with a thin and quickly receding white head. Light nose of wheat and some honey. Simple flavors of wheat and honey with some spices on the back of the palate. Body is light, and carbonation is very lively with a rather short spiced finish. Overall, I am not crazy about this beer."
"Skip this commercial garbage."
"My pour created a finger of eggshell-white head with good retention. The color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. I got the honey up front on the nose. There was a light spiciness in there, but it seemed more yeast-driven than anything else. Mouthfeel was slightly thin with a honey-sweet taste on the tongue. Finish had a spicy dryness that I would have otherwise attributed to a yeast strain doing its thing. The spices were there, but they did not seem readily identifiable to me. This is definitely a summer beer! Light, smooth, dry on the finish - a definite CANdidate for the cooler (if only it were readily available). Tasty."
"Light/medium body, very drinkable."
"Drinkability is pretty good, this is a decent honey ale. Dryer and less sweet than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. All in all, a pretty good summer beer."
"Pours a light golden yellow with a creamy head that settles to a half inch film. Sweet and floral smelling. Some black pepper, and faint baking spices like cloves and cinamon come out. Very clean and crisp flavor. Sweetness with a little peppery kick to start. Finishes bone dry with a just with a little bitterness and a touch more spice. This stuff works for what it's for. Very refreshing hot weather all day drinking kind of beer."
"D- Pretty high easy to drink nothing about that taste wants to make you not have another one. If you are just relaxing with friends and want to throw a few back this is a great choice instead of buying a mass marketed beer."
"Flavor has more going for it than the aroma with sweet malts, honey, apple, and cinnamon. Finishes clean.Lighter bodied, smooth, and moderately carbonated crisp clean mouthfeel.Quite drinkable"
"D - This is an okay beer. It really seems more like a blonde ale than an APA."
"Overall, this seems like a bit of a misfit, despite being a pretty good beer. I just don't know what season it fits in, because the mouthfeel seems too heavy for a spring/summer beer, but the flavor is in that range."
"Poured this pale wheat colored beer into a pint glass. The foam that was created off the pour was that of a 1/2 inch. Then reduced down to wisps of lacing. The wheat and floweral tones of the beer off the aroma is tantalizing. The taste isn't that great that follows the aroma. It has a bittering taste of the wheat that doesn't create a great pallet. The after taste is likewise but doesn't linger for that long."
"Sorry Big Sky...your IPA, Moose Drool, and Scape Goat are still great!"
"The beer pours a very clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is honey and wheat. The flavor is more of the same with lots of wheat and honey flavors. For a pale ale, there is hardly any hop character. Medium mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation. A nice easy drinking beer, but that is about it."
"An easy-drinking APA from Big Sky. Not great, but definitely good."
"overall, i enjoyed this beer but dont think ill get it again"
"This is a moderately enjoyable brew, but once I finished off the bottles I had no desire to revisit it again. A bit too sweet and thin for my tastes."
"Overall: The mouth fee is light, carbonated and a tad crisp. The body is also light and the finish is mild. I am not impressed. This beer does not taste like an APA. I think it is a tad sweet and not enough hops."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, little fizzy off-white head, with minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, very slight hop note, little spice note. The taste is sweet, malty, with some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is not an APA, should be a Blonde Ale or Cream Ale."
"Appearance is light with slight haze and reminds me of white grape juice. Smell is quite sweet with not much else to speak of. Taste is sweet and full of honey up-front with emerging hints of lemon and orange to provide a sour balance. Body is light and carbonation is high. I could take down a six pack fairly easily but I would prefer to drink other styles. Overall, its not bad for a honey ale style but I like a more flavorful brew."
"D- Not bad on a hot day but there are quite a few others I would reach for instead. Not worth seeking out."
"A fine choice and good to drink if it's available to you. Not worth going out for your way for though."
"Appearance is a golden orange and minimal head after an aggressive pour. Minimal lacing but lots of carbonation. Not much hits the nose, but the aroma is sweet malts and maybe a little bit of honey. Taste is similar to the nose with it seeming very watered down. Little hints of sweet honey and a rather dry, bland finish. Mouthfeel is very thin and drinkability is rather low. Not a very exciting beer in any way."
"A good effort from Big Sky, but I found it to be a tad too sweet for my taste. The honey is quite dominant and thus not very well-balanced. May do well to lure some away from mead."
"The body was very thin, you almost don't even notice it's in your mouth. The beer was certainly drinkable, but why bother? Try this if you're looking to add another notch on your gunhandle, but otherwise avoid."
"This beer pours a clear honey color with a one finger of white head that disappears immediately. Minimal to no lacing on this beer. Nose is of pale malts, honey, and faint wheat tones. Taste is of grainy and pale malts up front then a bit of citrus with a honey sweetness in the finish. Lighter bodied, medium carbonation, really thin feel but finishes with a crispness."
"A bit too sweet (and leaning towards bland) on the taste, though stops before becoming too honey-ish. Not one I would seek out, but refreshing enough on a hot day. Easy enough to drink, as there's not much to it, and carbonation is controlled, making it pretty smooth. More of an American Blonde than an APA, to me."
"Overall, a decent slightly plain summer beer."
"D: I've been a fan of Big Sky in the past, I just didn't find this one very good, a pass for me."
"I'm a fan of bears (referencing my 7 years of photographing them) so I decided to pick up a bottle of Bis Sky's summer beer. It's almost like a pilsner with honey flavor. It's a medium gold/amber color that's visually appealing with a small amount of head. The aroma is hoppy. Taste wise it has very mellow malts with the honey almost undetectable. It goes down and finishes very smoothly. It burbs good. It's ok, but it just doesn't stand out any."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking, lightly flavorful, though somewhat forgettable. Yep, it's about average for a simple, summertime libation!"
"Not really an APA to me, but an okay offering nonetheless."
"It goes down easy, but is heavier than I might like. There is something to this one being cold that gives it a Kolsch feel. I have to admit this might be releiving on a hot day."
"Drinkability is moderate. The beer is easily sessionable at only 4.7% ABV, however it's a bit dull and uninspiring which doesn't exactly compel the drinker to have another, or finish the current one for that matter. It's ok, but subpar in my book."
"Drinks well, I have enjoyed all of the Big Sky beers so far. This one is a nice departure from the typical APA."
"Pours a clear yellow color. One inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, honey, citrus, and pine. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, pine, slight honey, and citrus. There is a slight dryness associated with this brew. Overall, a very drinkable APA with decent body."
"One thing that I have noticed about Big Sky is as they get more known, the quality seems to be going down....many of their beers take on a watery feel. This should be the case when I spend $15 on a 12 pack...and this is on a good day."
"Pours a crystal clear golden with a big white head. Smell is faintly of grain, not much here. Taste is light and grainy, super clean grain bill, and a good bitterness from the hops rounds it out. Not much hop flavor. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery and thin, high carbonation. Quite drinkable though, a simple, 'no-frills' beer that would be nice to drink every once in awhile. Though this really doesn't seem like an American Pale Ale (I would say its an American Blonde Ale) its worth a shot."
"Crisp, clean mouthfeel, with a short finish. Thirst-quenching. Plenty drinkable. A good summer beer."
"Very pale in color and very clear appearance. The color of light honey perhaps. Traditional beer smells of grain and malt in the mainstream/macrobrew sort of way. Frothy head with a smooth and thick attack and mouthfeel. The flavor is rich in that ""macro"" sort of way. The finish is clean. This beer I think would have very wide mainstream appeal and would be handy to have in the cooler for a party. It makes me think of honey brown only a superior version of it. Perhaps the name clouds my judgment though."
"Very refreshing and a great summer alternative to the usual weissbier or kolsch."
"not sure this beer is really a pale ale, not hoppy enough, would fit more in the pale wheat category....but i got a IPA in the sampler pack as well so i can't complain. nonetheless it's refreshing and quaffable. i could sit down and drink this all day and not be offended"
"The taste on the other hand was... not bad. Just a bit to ""yeasty"" I guess, almost like a grain belt. However, I think it needs that because there isn't much else in there. A decent enough summer beer. I'll have to remember this for the hot days because this beer is probably quite good out of a bottle."
"Notes from and tasted on 9/11/06"
"(rated Aug 9, 2007)"
"It's an ok quencher, but not overly exciting or flavorful. I'll stick to the Moose Drool."
"I really do like several Big Sky beers, and this is not one of them. The beer really does have a honey color, aroma, and taste. White foam dissipated fasr. Very subtle honey in the aroma and tase department, and there is nothing else going on other than it is balanced."
"I don't like this one. I don't find it drinkable. For me to drink this one again, my other choice(s) will have to be quite horrid."
"Out of the bottle this Montana brew was a wet-straw gold color with a white head one finger thick. Faded after a few minutes to a thin skim and then a tiny ring. Moderate lacing. Aromas are mostly wheat and some hops with pale malt behind it. Flavors are almost all wheat, crisp but the honey is very hard to find. Slightly sour. 'Wet' finish of grains sticks to the tongue. Decent mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. OK, but not much more than that."
"Papery pale malt flavor, mild graham sweetness. Not really getting any floral or honey flavor. Average is about all I can say. Moderate fizz, drinks fine. A no-brainer for a dog day."
"The mouth is decent with unlooked for heft. I suppose this is an easy enough drinker and would be a nice cross-over beer"
"Drinkablity: Easy drinking and tasty brew."
"D:At 4.7%, I have no complaints drinking it - apart from the very disappointing flavor profile"
"Pours a clear straw with a quick head and no lacing or foam. Good bubbles though. The aroma is a delicate mix of pale malts adn light spices. hen somesoft honey and musty hops. The tase immediately mkes me think of an American pale wheat ale. Musty German hops with some light honey bread sweetness and even lighter spice notes. The palate is sweet but a little musty, but the finish has a nice honey and spice combo. Tastes more like an American wheat ale than an APA."
"D= very drinkable, great for sessions or parties, probably just fine even in the non-summer seasons, and obviously FAR better than any macro of any sort."
"Pale filtered straw colored in the body, head is white and fuzzy with modest retention. The aroma is mild, hop and tea leaf notes with touches of sweetness (could that be the honey?). As it enters the mouth, I immediately become refreshed off its easy and light flavor. Almost citrusy tasting. Bready notes break up the monotone flavor. I can't seem to find the honey character; okay it's there, but it's very light. This is a simple and refreshing beer."
"I have to admit that I didn't pour this into a glass and so I gave the appearance a ""3.0"" as a default. I don't think the appearance could have saved this one though. It tasted very watery to me, like a light macro beer but with some honey flavor added. I know that a summer ale is supposed to be light, but this one was dismal..."
"Good beer and I am probably downplaying it, but overall, I want a little bit more out of my summer seasonals.. but still very nice.... I am actually very surprised that I've never reviewed this one before despite my dozens of times enjoying it."
"Drinkablility - Goes doen easy, enjoy anytime I don't care what the name says."
"a nice beer. this should be a revisited every summer. recommended."
"Great summer brew, not too heavy but still does the trick when camping with friends. Cool and crisp, a slight hop bite greets you followed by a mellow honey twang, almost unnoticable. Not much on hop aroma, possibly Mt. Hood or even Cascade if I had to venture a guess. A definate and constant summer must for me and my friends as we all enjoy this one to start the night off before moving to the cheap stuff."
"I see this is being deeply discounted in a lot of places. If you like it, stock up."
"when poured from a 12 oz bottle the first thing i notice is the thick lacy head that after it is gone leaves soap like suds on the edge of the glass. The color was a pale amber yellow. The first thing i could smell was a wild coriander/cilantro and a little bit of citrus. Taste was about the same with a little more veggie taste. Mouthfeel was creamy, but clean. Nice and sudsy. Drinkability is awesome on this one. I really enjoyed this beer. A lot better this time, than the first time i had it."
"The beer pours from the 12 ounce bottle a slightly foggy gold with a portly bright white creamy head that dissipates leaving the lace a firm sheet upon the glass. Nosey is sweet with honey and malt, citrus like in its crispness, start has a pleasant honey taste, nice malt presence, the top light to medium in feel. Finish has a sparkling acidity, the hops underpowered, sweetness continues to the end also, a bit dry, a drinkable beer, maybe a bit to sweet for me, but not a major malfunction."
"Drinkability isn't quite there. I try to be optimistic when trying (and rating) styles that I don't have a strong affinity for. Big Sky does justice in the fact that its a decent summer ale, light and refreshing. Just seems that some more honey and a moderate increase in hopping couldv'e kicked this one up a few notches."
"Drinkability: Purchased a mix 12 pack to try the Big Sky beers. I should have waited til they had a different seasonal in the pack. I would not purchase this as a stand alone product."
"Could not drink many of these because it is heavy for a lighter beer"
"The taste is disappointing as well. There's a touch of honey, barely detectable, with a bland blend of wheat and bitter spice. Pretty awful stuff, really. Mouthfeel is crisp and astringent with a high level of carbonation, but a bad aftertaste that tries its best at a bitter finish, but ultimately fails. All in all, I wouldn't ever buy this again. Quite the flop of a summer brew from the makers of such a fine-tasting beer as Moose Drool. I hope this is just a case of a bad bottle."
"Not good...not recommended...most went down the drain."
"As I've found with spice-heavy brews, let this one sit out a minute to appreciate the subtlety of the ingredients. Very crisp when cold, lots of carbonation. Light of body, a touch watery but quaffable. Not bad."
"Served in a shaker. Medium pour yields a one-fingered off white head of medium duration and fairly good lacing. Very clear golden in color, with moderate carbonation. Nose is subtle honey and lightly sweet, pale malts. Slightly vegetal, and no apparent hops. Honey is apparent on the first sip, but is fleeting, a bit more than the minimun impression is left before the semi-sweet malts round out the palate, and a dryer, biscuity malt takes over. Nice and dry in the finish. Somewhat fruity and aromatic, with clover honey (just a guess) and apple blossoms. Aftertaste leaves an impression of peach, which is actually quite nice. The hops are there also, but very, very attenuated. Body is lighter and mothfeel is a little on the thin side, and the carbonation is reasonably easy-going, too. This is a nice, well-executed fruit-vegetable beer, and I'd say so especially if we were to consider it more of an amalgam of Golden Ale and Fruit Vegetable beer rather than an APA. For whatever reason this bottle is striking me as tastier and livelier than the last draght I had of the Summer Honey, so either the recipe has changed or it's less impressive on draught? Improves a bit asit warms, but no doubt goes down quite well on the cold side for some folks . . . is there a touch of wheat malt in this one? At any rate, it's much better than I remember it from the many times I've sampled it over the previous five or six years. A solid summer quaffer from a solid craft brewery."
"Today was a hot one, over 90, and yes this was refreshing, but there are many other summer beers that are better."
"A boring beer that tastes like a Coors with kicked up bitterness levels. No reason to ever try this."
"Big Sky delivers a beautifully floral, gently sweet, and lightly citrusy golden beer in their Summer Honey Ale. It pours a deep golden body with an orange cast beneath a frothy head of bright white that steadily dwindles to a cottony surface covering and thick collar. Rings of spotty and cragged lace are left behind. In the nose it's lemony over some malty and honeyish sweetness. The body is medium with a decidedly dextrinous edge, and it's crisp on the palate with a lightly bristling carbonation. The flavor is loaded with honey flavor and wheatish malt. Floral hop flavors and a bit of lemon zest help to round it out. It finishes surprisingly short and dry given the amount of flavor packed into each sip, and it lingers for a few moments with a combination of wheatish malt and floral hops as well as a very light touch of pine. Quite a nice summer ale! This one's perfect for a wide variety of events, and I could easily imagine enjoying this at a ball game, boating, a backyard BBQ, fishing trip, or cool evening on the porch. Worth trying."
"There are too many amazing Big Sky beers I'd rather be having. Yes, this is better than any other refreshing lawnmowever macro beer due to its honey spiced flavor. But I just want to move on from this beer."
"This is a good summer beer...maybe excellent...very refreshing."
"The smell brings strong honey flavor with some light flower scents. In the taste, pale malts start things off while honey takes over part way through and lasts through the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly light while drinkability is very high."
"Drinks okay. I prefer the crystal ale as a summer time libation. One of the better honey beers I've had, still a bit too sweet"
"A nice summer beer, not too heavy but complicated enough to be interesting. Recommended."
"D- The sweetness of the honey was nice and the bitterness of the hops offered a nice balance. Most beers that add honey have some odd fermented honey flavors but this one wasn't bad."
"I came close to pouring this one down the sink. Its just too sweet, and the sweetness has some odd characteristics as well. It reminds me of the smell of over-aged beef. I can see how a lot of folks might like this beer, but I think Ill avoid this one in the future."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass a light transparent yellow color with 2 finger head and lots of carbonation. Smell is slightly sweet with grass/hay and hops scents coming through as well. Taste is pretty sweet like honey with a very light hoppy aftertaste. Nothing too special though. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, a little bit on the flat side. Overall this is a pretty decent summer ale that goes down easily."
"With Summer Honey Ale, Big Sky has demonstrated their brewing dexterity by keeping three balls named 'honey', 'hops' and 'spices' in the air at the same time. They've come up with an excellent summer cooler that I'd love to have access to when the hot weather rolls around."
"Looks like about 15,000 other beers, crystal clear gold colr, with a small white head that fades to almost nothing. Not a lot in the nose, but malt and honey sweetness, and a little spice. Taste is very nice for a honey ale. The honey is there, and makes the beer sweet, but enhances the malt flavor. Very light and crisp, the malt and honey are absolutely at perfect levels to each other. Good work Big Sky, you have made the best honey beer I have ever tasted."
"Overall impression: One of the better honey beers I have tried. Nice drinkable summer brew."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. Honey gold body. Nice, feathery off-white head. Thin lacing. Smell: gritty graininess, thin malt sweetness, slight hop earthiness -- nice. Taste: quick pinch of hop bitterness upfront, followed by a honey-like sweetness, hint of vanilla; dry finish with a nice toasty graininess. Mouthfeel: slick and clean, middling carbonation. Good summer brew."
"I wasn't dissapointed....It is what its trying to be....a bit spicey yet sweet almost to the point of annoying but like george castanza's dad it pulls up short....nice, refreshing carbonation levels. I did this six pack in tonight and would like another, in my book thats some super drinkability. Far from a big beer, this is lawnmower material and it does what you think it will, refresh without boring you."
"A nice summer seasonal that is quite drinkable. Seemed a bit more like a cream ale than an APA to me."
"Pours a vibrant, sparkling, golden yellow, with a coppery sheen. Tight-packed, persistent guaze-white head. Nice. Soft, tangy malt aromas underscore definite honey and some peppery spices--maybe coriander. Interesting and good. Peppery spices dot biscuity malt flavors up front. Light, honeyish sweetness gives way to an herbal, peppery bitterness. Soft mouthfeel on a medium body. I could swear there's some wheat in here. Nice summer ale that thankfully is not just another American pale wheat ale."
"It's pale gold with a big, creamy head. Good lacing. Looks like the kind of beer I want to drink after mowing the lawn. Doesn't smell too much, a little bit of spiciness, but tastes great. The scent is representative of the flavor, a very easy-drinking beer with a bit of spice. Excellent and refreshing on this particular day."
"Drinkability- All in all a great beer with different and great flavors. This may take over my top Montana beer."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pale and bisquit malt scent with some honey notes and a musty breadlike finish. The taste is excellent. It has a very smooth pale and bisquit malt flavor that is slightly sweet and very drinkable. It goes down easy and finishes spicey and breadlike. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine summer seasonal. It has real good flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"This is a perfectly drinkable beer, though it's nothing fantastic. I'm just not a fan of honey beers. It was quite good at the price I got it at, but I'm not sure I'd seek it out and pay actual money for it."
"I recommend this for the people in your lives who don't understand why you like beer so much. It may help them."
"Quite a drinkable honey beer."
"A lighht golden brew with white head. Aromas of honey and light grassy hops and bready yeast but nothing special. It has a light refreshing body holding bready malt and yeast flavors with a good malt backbone. It finishes with a toasted malt and lightly honey flavors, a nice summer beer."
"The bitterness and sweetness is well balanced in this ale. A different taste that just made it interesting and worth trying."
"Light Gold color, medium head. Light bodied ale, flavored with honey and spices. Light and refreshing. Light bodied. Lots of flavor. Good malt/hop balance. Mouthfeel is clean. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is spicy and slightly bitter. Nice summer beer."
"Big Sky Brewing has done a great job with this light summer ale. Perfect for a hot day with both sweet tones and hop flavors. Color is just like honey. Not much head, even though it is over corbonated, which is why I gave it lower score on mouthfeel. The carbonation burn detracts from the flavor. So, I just swirl it a bit until the carbonation is released some. A bit pricey for a lighter beer, so I wait for it on sale."
"Light honey yellow in color with a small pencil width high head of even leveled, off-white, super tight, creamy foam. The head faded a little fast and has spotty lace. The aroma is very nice, very sugary with a touch of honey thats super fresh. Nice! Taste echoes the smell with a nice light sugary taste with sweet honey and a bit of hops showing up with a very slight lemon note that together keeps this nicely balanced and super smooth. Yum! Feel is a lighter to medium body, very clean, soft, and solidly smooth. This is some remarkable stuff, very unique, yummy, and very drinkable in my book. I think I have a new summer brew to add to my list, this summer honey of a brew by Big Sky is a must try."
"Fine white head that leaes quickly, honey golden color. Aroma: spicy sweet, arousing, tingly, bright. Taste:utterly delicious. So far, the best honey beer I've had, though I haven't had them all (Dupont Biere de Miele, Young's Waggledance, where ARE you??. ) Bright honey flavor comes shining through. Light body, pleasant finsh, easy-drinking. Not much in the hop department, but that's not what they're going for. An excellent summertime refreshment!"
"for a beer brewed with honey.  This is a quality beer."
"Clear yellow ochre color with a substandard head that's a trace after 20 seconds.  Bright aroma, trace of honey.  Off tastes (!), tap water with spicy impressions.  Stays medium-bodied to the swallow, but has some unsettling qualities in the esophagus.  There's a little mid-mouth interest in this brew, but it doesn't redeem the wandering finish of sweet/sour/weird to my tongue.  Big Sky Brewing is a real puzzler to me, high variation in quality in their brews."
"This clear light golden brew throws out a medium white head with little retention.  Beautiful sweet clover honey is present on the nose with some light spicing perceived also (cinamon?).  This is really a nice tasting summer brew.  The honey is evident as well as some wheat malt it seems.  There's a nice little hop bite.  It's light to medium in body and glides over the tongue effortlessly.  There is also a very nice dryness present throughout the drink, but moreso on the finish.  One of my favorite quaffable summer beers."
"Not bad at all....I'd take it over Leinie's Honey any day of the week...I've got three more of these and may adjust this rating as I drink them, but my first impression is pretty good..."
"Interesting light, somewhat spicey aroma with a honey sweetness and slight fruitiness to it.  Very clear, yellowish gold color, fizzy head with a relatively short life.  Fairly bland flavor.  The qualities that make the aroma pleasing don't transfer that well into the flavor.  Fairly dry over all.  Has a somewhat refreshing quality to it to make it an appropriate seasonal beer for summer. Somewhat full mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation."
"Nice gold-orange color, but unfortunately for me the beer quality did not match it's appearance.  Honey sweet with citrus undertones and a medium (leaning towards the light) bitterness.  Subtle hints of nuts."
