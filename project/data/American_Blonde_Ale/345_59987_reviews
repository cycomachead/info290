"I had this about a week ago and likely won't have it again. I'm a big fan of other Victory offerings, but I prefer their other hoppier styles. That's not surprising since I don't usually favor blonde ales."

"DATE REVIEWED: August 1, 2014... GLASSWARE: pint... OCCASION: finding a new favorite show in Drunk History at State College...APPEARANCE: pale, almost wan, weak yellow car body; pillowy white, single-finger head that thins rather quickly... AROMA: sharp banana; damp yeasts with some funk--a wet blanket? noticeably light malt scents--not very alluring ... PALATE: medium-bodied; oily and palpably gritty; smooths out over the course of the glass draining; refreshing overall ... TASTE: light, spritzy lemon; a bit doughy for an ale; the funk in the aroma bleeds into the taste--odd dish detergent lingers... OVERALL: an oddly spotty offering from Victory--sharp and slightly abrasive with the overall experience rounding out the profile with some acceptance, but a mix of scents and tastes that do not seem to coexist peacefully... light enough to fit the season, but not large enough to occupy attention or demand a revisit...."

"Pours a lovely golden color with sticky white lacing. Super light brew - and dry as a bone. At 5.2% this is a great little session ale, easy enough for everyone and complex enough that I found it entertaining. Very nice summer brew - if you're going to be out on a boat, at the beach, wherever - this wouldn't be a bad choice. Give it a shot - nice beer."
""
"I must say for a Summer/Blonde its pretty tastey. Seemed to have a little bit of a noble hop bite, kinda grassy, which I dug, nice and carbonated, much tastier than a Bud/PBR/ect. Had a more present malt body than would be expected, nice and bready. I probably would normally purchase something local/cheaper if going in this category but its one of the better ""summer beers"" out there. Quite quaffable."
""
"Pours out a brassy gold with a moderately sized head. Smell is grainy with an odd hop smell. Hops have an herbal scent. I'm assuming that it's also the hops, but I'm picking up an odd, brothy aroma. Kind of like onion skins. Not feeling the smell. Taste is an improvement. Solid herbal/floral hops with a cracker grain malt body. Finish is clean, with slight ale yeast fruitiness. Mouthfeel is moderate overall. Overall this isn't bad, except for the weird aroma."

"Pours a pretty clear deep straw color with a good sized tightly bubbled white head that recedes to form a cap on top. Aromas of bready and light caramel malts with a solid floral spicy hop to counter. The flavor is rich sweet bready malts with a bit of earthy spicy hops. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Wow I really enjoyed this beer! Extremely clean, simple, but quite flavorful at the same time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing to write home about. I found this to be quite funky with the hops not even able to mask it. I typically enjoy everything Victory does, but this is an exception. I'm gonna pretend I never had this offering. I'll stick to blonde women instead"

"Appearance is a crystal clear golden straw color with a thin layer of head that dissipated rapidly. The nose is lightly malty and the maltiness is also lightly present in the flavor profile. This offering is light-bodied. The finish has a semi-dry bitterness from the hops which appears to grow more hoppy as one moves down the glass."

"Overall / Drinkability: The tart crispness with the very German style finish makes me think of a beer that is part pilsner, part US citrusy hops. The overall effect is something that is very refreshing and tasty, and something that pairs well with a lot of different flavors. Went very well with a burger and roasted vegetables (beets and potatoes). I'll have to seek this one out again - very drinkable and I wouldn't mind having a larger glass of it."
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked the composition of the Hop Ticket Session IPA better than Summer Love. This tastes a little thin to me."
""
""
""
"The grassy and slightly floral hops are more forward in the flavor with a toasted malt character right off the bat. Lingering finish."
"The taste is hoppier than I expected from the smell. The nearly untoasted malt does provide a base but it quickly disappears to a black pepper bitterness. Full bodied for the style but also with an elevated level of carbonation. The aftertaste starts off balanced but devolves to simply the aforementioned black pepper from the hop."

"I'll be honest, I'm not a natural summer-beer lover. I prefer the deeper, more complex flavors of autumn and winter brews. I lean toward higher-gravity beers, so that is yet another turnoff for me regarding summery types. That said, this beer was not bad for a 5.2%, Summer Ale. It doesn't taste quite as light as most beers of this season. There is a distinctively bitter aftertaste that causes me to be of the opinion that this beer is not as refreshing as a commonplace summer brew, but it is a damn good beer for a summer/autumn hybrid. ;)"
""
""
"Flavor of the Season INDEED. This american Blonde Ale is quite refreshening after an afternoon of grueling lawn mowing. Its golden amber color signifies the refreshment of youth, like that of a child's first alcoholic beverage. But the burliness of the hops reminds you that this beer is not for a child but for a man of great wisdom. With a minute hint of citrus, heaping amount of hops, and arouma that is suited for the gods, one would be a fool not to consume."

"O: Really great beer. I rate to style on balance, but this one could hold its own against most of them. A twelve pack of this in cans would beat any session IPA that I've had, as far as summery considerations go. Highly recommended if you can find it."

"Summer Love brewed by Victory Brewing Company with an ABV 0f 5.2. This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a small white head. This is an an filtered brew. To me it looks like an wheat brew. The smell is sweet and crisp. I'm picking up citrus and grains. This brew has a nice smell to it. The taste is bitter. There is a lot of hops to this brew. That is what the bitterness is coming from. After half way down it gets better. The taste is ok and I'm leaving it at that. Mouthfeel is nice and clean with a bitterness of hops. Summer Love does have some smoothness to it. overall I'm giving this brew a 3.25 out of 5. Not the best I've had but not the worst I've had."
"Overall: This is a great summer beer for me. I am a big fan. Easy to drink and reminds me of the summer. I will definitely have it again."

"A 3.5 overall for Summer Love, this will be a staple in my fridge these next few months. I will buy this brew again"
""
""
""
""
"If Victory was to make a ""lawnmower"" beer this would be it. Total thirst quencher. A high degree of drink-ability. Perfect for a hot mid summer cool down. Yes, it's an ale but compared to Victory's other offerings thus beer is muted which will make it appealing to the lager crowds and dare I say even the mainstream Budweiser swilling types."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Really simple, I like this beer. It's pour, it's smell and it's taste. It is to me what a American summer ale should taste like. Nice job Victory. Hard to find here in northeast Ohio so I bought all they had which was basically a case. Ordering me some more though. Have others to try though but will gladly nurse these."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not too much unlike a German pilsener but has qualities of an ale to it such a the hops on the back end of the taste. As being new to the blond ale style, I thought this was refeshing due to the thinner body and lemon zest it has to it. I thought the malt up front was a bit bland however, though that does not detract too much from it. Not a bad offering from Victory."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A truly oddball and weird one. Now this was picked up as a single, so I only had one to base a review on. I'll try to pick it up again, and if there's anything not right about this particular bottle, I'll re-review the beer. But it doesn't seem like there's any infection or reason to not review the beer. The store that sold it generally takes good care of their beer. So for the moment, there you have it."
""
""
"O: Never been a huge blonde fan. This beer has high drinkability and thatâ€™s its selling point in my opinion. The aroma is nice and it presents strongly, but fails to fully come to fruition. This brew is ideal for whetting the whistle and fits the bill for summer drinking. If you cross paths with this beer, plan on having a few, I donâ€™t believe itâ€™s meant for sipping."
""
"Had this in what seems to be its intended setting... at a picnic in a park by the water on one of the first nice days of summer. It did the trick, but wasn't anything particularly special. It has the same strong floral hoppiness going on as many other ""summer"" brews, though there isn't quite as much fruitiness as you sometimes get from blonde ales. One thing I'll say for it is it didn't lose flavor as I drank it, as some beers do on hot summer days."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I feel like I've had this beer before - Victory tweaked some older recipe to create this... they do well with their German ingredients, adding a touch of this US hop and that... I could see drinking 2-3 of these at a BBQ this summer"

"a little grassy, a little pilsner-y, a little bit of adjunct, but a decent brew and easy to drink. almost some kind of vegetal and fruit flavors in there too.... foamy white head, slightly sticking to the sides. do you ever wonder if 250 characters might be too many for some brews???"

"With all that hoppy goodness, Victory should get away from any notion of this being a Blonde Ale and would be better suited to advance the hop structure in all- aroma, flavor and bitterness and lighten the body to make Summer Love a ""session"" IPA. Its 3/4 there already!"

"Pours to a frothy white head and symmetrical lacing. Color is , well... Blonde. Aroma is grassy, grapefruit hops and pale malt. Flavor is same as aroma with a nice crisp refreshing finish. Mouthfeel is light. Overall a hoppy blonde who treats you right."

"This is a fantastic beer. Expertly crafted and brewed. I would call it a German Pils with the added pungency of Simcoe and Citra. Totally love it. I could drink a 6'er of this easy during a day at the beach or an outdoor barbecue with family and friends. Highly recommended."

"Part of a pick your own sixer from the market. It is still summer just barely, so lets give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a very earthy dandelion like hoppiness. Pouring into my SAPP this brew is a bright yellow with a big bubble white creamy top head. On the taste the hoppiness prevails up front, not bitter but very bright and sharp with a thin maltiness behind it that doesn't diminish the sharpness of the hops. A different hop belt very yerba like and sweet yet strong. Not really my kind of flavor."

"Pours a very deceptively straw yellow. Big foamy head.Smells very much like a pilsner, with big German aromatics. First sip is slightlly astringent, bitter hops. Maybe Saaz or Centennial, but mostly for flavor. Makes way to a sweet, but still light malt body. Best parts about this beer is 1. it is consistent, & 2. it doesn't taste like a blonde ale. It's more like a light hoppy pilsner with and American twist. For a summer seasonal, there sure are worse beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is light bodied beer that when served the proper temp can make for a nice tasty pint while relaxing on your porch after mowing your lawn on a hot Ohio day."
""
"Pours clear, yellow color. Not quite finger width head - mainly bubbly - very little lacing on side. Has more of an stale apple aroma with hints of citrus. Malty lemon flavor up front with moderate hoppy character on the end. Hoppiness is more grassy. Soapy aftertaste on the back end. More than I expect from a blonde ale. I am usually not a fan of the style, but the hoppy character is a plus for me. Soapy taste on the end is a little odd for me."
""
""
""
""
"While I'm enjoying it on my couch, I can imagine it'd be best enjoyed out in the sun. I loved the taste but I wasn't as keen on the way it felt in my mouth. a little dryer than I like. I loved the sweet and airy flavor, and it has a fun bottle! Definitely something I'd drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a little darling of a beer. It strikes the perfect balance between flavor and simple drinkability. It's just a fun and easy beer to drink, and that's exactly what you want in a summer seasonal. One of the better blondes I've had in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - Really good and very refreshing. Reminds me a bit of sierra nevada's pale ale. I'd drink it again anytime - a great session beer."

"This pours a nice golden hue. Thereâ€™s a slight, crisp lemony aroma to this with a similar characteristic on the palate. Finishes with just a touch of biscuit and a pleasing crispness along with a graceful tartness that I found to be refreshing and enjoyable. This might be a new contender for summer beers. Clean, crisp, and so much better than the sort of stuff that passes for a summer beer these days. Canâ€™t believe this is a blonde aleâ€”it gives me hope for the style! Seriously, this puts the majority of blonde ales Iâ€™ve had to shame."

"The taste was light yet full of malty goodness and just the right hoppy-ness. A perfect balance in my opinion. Very drinkable for both a light beer drinker and for those wanting something more. This is a beer that could convert your Miller and Bud friends into a craft drinker."

"3.75 D: Supremely drinkable. Perfect lawnmower beer or anytime beer."

"One of the better summer seasonals I have tasted, as I find most of them to be very bland. This one is almost like an IPA with a somewhat lower alcohol and less malt to make it into a more refreshing, thirst-quenching beer. I prefer it to the many bland American wheat ales coming out in summer."

The aroma is clean...grass and grain...not much fruit, but a moderate hop scent...peppery, but quiet. Crisp and a tad bitter. Not really sweet, but there is a flavor of malt. Medium in body...mor substantial than expected. Nicely drinkable."

"Overall, this is an ok beer but a good poolside offering. I would have this again at a BBQ on a hot day but otherwise it doesn't have the best blend of flavors for my taste. Still it's above an average beer by far."

"o - Overall a pretty nice blonde ale that is smooth and easy to drink. Lots of citrus to it, especially in the taste. Would definitely have it again sometime; a good summer beer."
""
""
"O: Overall a great beer and like it a lot will enjoy this sixer and perhaps more before summer is over."
""
""
"Pours clear golden with lots of carbonation and a fluffy white head. Smells fruity with pears and green apple, a bit of sweetness. Taste follows suit with a refreshing lemon peel twist. A great summer ale with no skunky lingering aftertaste, which is usually my complaint with similar brews like Sam Adam's. Top tier for the style. I'd sip this all summer long. So drinkable and just incredible pleasant."
"O - I am not a fan of Victory, but this is one of the better beers that I have had from them."
""
"Had a chance to enjoy a few of these beers while on the beach in the Outer Banks. Surprised to see it as a blonde ale, tasted pretty hoppy and struck me as a pale ale.. regardless, it's a delicious, refreshing beer that's well balanced and crisp with a great finish. Would definitely recommend and makes for a nice, light summer beer."

"Overall, this is a wonderful beer for hot weather, providing refreshment and flavor at the same time. Sign me up for a sixer."

"This beer looks very nice on the pour. And the nose is outstanding. The flavor hit me kind of sideways as I didn't expect it. But as time went on it either mellowed out, or I got used to it (and appreciated it more). Real nice floral hoppy character. Consistent, smooth, fresh. A very nice beer. I'm feeling the summer love on this one."
"O: Very enjoyable summer beer. I haven't had a lot of Victory beers, but each one had impressed me. This one is no different and is a ""gotta have one, gotta have six"" beer."
""
"Not a review as much as a comment - this was my go-to beer last summer but have been unable to find it in 2012. It is what a summer ale shopuld be... light but hoppy. Refreshing but not too filling. I miss it. In the meantime I will be cooling down with new holland white hatter. Although completly different styles they are very similar."

"O: If you ever wanted a beer that is simply straight, no-frills, German-style drinkability, this oneâ€™s for you. Itâ€™s not going to win any medals or satisfy a palate thatâ€™s looking for complexity, but it does do exactly what it advertises: drink smooth and tasty on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"O: Just not my glass of beer. It seems to have a great cult following, so if you're in to these types of beers, you may like it. Unfortunately, I did not."
""
"Taste is full enough and slightly grainy. Touch of spritz and grain on the finish. Full and spicy body and feel. Very neutral as for yeast influence but clever spicing/hop influence. Warming yields more lemon and pepper upon a nice pils base. Quite drinkable and not overdone with a clean finish."
"O - Love the hopcentricity of this summer creation. The lingering bitterness makes it a quaffable sipper, while the body makes it possible to take a few down. It might be a better fit as a summer pale ale, but again, expect no less from Victory. <4>"
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a pale, slightly hazed, goldenrod coloring with a slow flow of small carbonation bubbles present throughout and a thin ring of film around the surface. Aromas of toasted grains, slight buttery sweetness, and a light hopping. Flavors are a bit more hopped, with a slightly bitter forward flavor followed by a solid, smooth toasted grain backbone. The buttery notes catch the tail end leading into the bitter and spiced hoppy aftertaste. The finish is crisp, clean, and slightly dry. Very easy to drink, very refreshing, and slightly hoppier than most brews in this style...tasty beer."

"O. A really nice summer beer and one that I'd seek out again."
"O: Pretty damn good. This is the kind of beer that knows what it is, and knows what it isn't...drink it on a hot summer day (cough) without a care in the world, and it'll treat you like a champ."
""
""
"A real nice summer treat, this was perfect to throw back and enjoy. Very above average taste, and while not the most complex of beers it is a stand-out as far as summer beers. Forget the style, think beer to drink all day and night at a party which has much better flavor than a macro brew. Iâ€™ll definitely seek this out in the summer again."
""
""
""
""
"D- love this brew...bought a sixer and would buy another."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's rare that I buy a 6 pack of anything these days - I prefer mix a sixes, I did so with this and don't regret it. However, one thing I need to say - if you are looking for a ""traditional"" summer ale (light, easy drinking), look elsewhere. This one is highly bitter and doesn't really fit into the summer ale spectrum."
""
""
""
"Overall: I think American blondes are one of the more subjective styles of beer and this one is not only very good but also fairly different from others I have had. That being said it isn't the best summer beer out there fr refreshing character but it definitely has the flavor many summer brews lack."
"Today was Victory day - trying a number of Victory's that I had not previously recorded on BA, and the three I had all were better than expected. Well done."

"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a long lasting white head. Aroma is of orange, citrusy hops and pale malt. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Citrusy hops, ripe fruit and biscuit malt nicely balanced on the palate. Finish is long on a hoppy side. Excellent summer brew."

"Even with a relatively gentle pour, I still wound up with two-plus fingers of dense, bone-white head with good retention. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy lemon-yellow. Nose had a lemony-citrus hoppiness and my mouth began to water. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops were quite evident on the tongue. In fact, perhaps more than I would have preferred. If it is to be a summer blonde, I prefer a little more subtlety and yet recently I have been feeling more and more like Victory's beers are over the top, especially regarding their use of hops. And that from a hophead! I do not know whether it is on their end or mine, but as a consumer, I am not as pleased as in the past. The finish was quite dry and somewhat refreshing, but I just felt like it needed to be better offset with the malts that they mentioned. That, or tone down the hops ... Wait, did I really just type that?!?"
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, herbal, floral, lemon zest, grass, light pine, and slight bread. Very nice aromas with a great hop profile and good strength; fairly dank as well. Taste of grapefruit, orange rind, lemon zest, herbal, floral, pine, grass, and bready malts. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, floral, pine, grass, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Great blend of hops flavor with good balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice crisp and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a really great and well hopped blonde ale. Great balance and hop flavor profile; extremely crisp and very easy to drink. I will be getting this again, great summer beer."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a hazy straw yellow, with a half inch of white that clings some to the glass. Smell citrus, grass, biscuit, and some clove. Taste is a little different than smell, some lemon bitterness and sweeter than I would have expected, definitely more hoppy than I expected, in a odd way. Body is medium, plenty of life, not dry, and easy enough drinking. This is unique and strangely good."
""
""
"This is light bodied, crisp and refreshing. This might not be a great ""blonde"" ale but I like it. It's got a nice refreshing hop flavor that is a nice addition to a light summer ale."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to pound down for a while."
""
""
""
"Pours light golden, good clarity, smallish head of white, laces up decently. Smell is earthy, mild malt. Taste is pleasant, nicely balanced bitterness and mild biscuit malt give it an almost crisp presence, very lightly lemony and citric. Wet and refreshing across the palate with a medium light but well crafted body. Moderate carbonation imparts the correct feel to the flavor profile. Certainly one of the best blonde ales I've had."
"This is a decent beer for a summer offering. It has a solid hop character and great drinkinability. I'll definitely try this out again."

""
""
"O: Very easy to drink, very enjoyable, and very sessionable. Nice and light and very enjoyable, goes down easy on a summer day (or evening)."
"O: It could be a good summer beer, I would rather have a nice ipa with more malt flavors in it however. Its light and has a decent noble hop presence kick, but just not much in the body or complexity side."
""
""
""
""
"The body was light and good carbonation helped carry the flavors across. The beer was slightly sticky at the end however. Drinkability was very good, this could slip down your throat effortlessly all day long. Overall, a very good brew. I think the brewers hit their target for this beer dead-on. Worth trying."
""

""
"Overall: Quaffable, refreshing stuff. Best no-frills summer beer I've had in a while."
""
""
"O - Ugh. Started out well, but barely drinkable by the end. Maybe I'm super sensitive to a hop variety they used in this, or just cat piss in general, because I'm surprised not many other reviewers have picked it out."
""
""
"Very light up front. Its super light base malt, with a sharp herbal medicinal hop. Just a bit of lemon and lemon peel, just enough. Very balanced and light feeling, with the medicinal hop going through the finish. Doesnt finish as clean as I expected (which is the only problem I find with the beer)."
""
""
""
""
"Color is a golden straw, with an average sized head that fades quickly. The smell wonderfully balanced, reminding me of a fruit cocktail of pears, apples, and peaches. The taste leans toward citrus and floral hops, with a malty sweetness in the background. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but this is to be expected from a light-bodied summer ale. Makes a great summertime beer; pairs great with a baseball game."

"A lot of flavor and character in a lighter bodied beer. Fine summer drinking."
"Snappy. Grassy! Light bodied but full flavored. Grainy malts up the middle. Mild, crisp bitterness keeps me sipping -reminds me of a lighter version of the hop profile they used for Prima Pils. Effervescent. Perfect, but dangerous summer beer. 5.2% doesn't seem like much. But, on a hot summer day? A cookout? I could drink these as if they were a 4%ish session beer, alll day, and end up feeling very poorly at the end of the day. Might be my new favorite summer beer."
""
""
""

"O - Nice summer beer, but lacks a lot of meat on the bones much like many beers in this style. Refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A light, crisp beer just a little too bitter to be truly refreshing. Lingering alcohol heat and pine in the aftertaste cut down on drinkability. Definitely a good choice with a few different beers, but wouldn't be a good session beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer. Pours a light golden color in a glass, with good visible carbonation. A good head, although it disappears in a matter of minutes. A bitter taste at first, but finishes with a good balance of malt, hops, and a hint of wheat and lemon rinds. Not the best out of Victory Brews, but definitely one of my favorite summer ales. Great for its class. Given that I prefer beers with a strong hop presence, I give it a 9/10."
"A good, almost toned down version of their Prima Pils, a good solid session beer that would please any beer drinker. This isnt a style I would pick up and session all the time (at least at this time in my life), but is a good solid drinker. Good."
""
""
""

"Summer Love is a great summer offering from Victory. The taste is good and well balanced. The beer is smooth but not thin and can serve as a refresher or a session beer. If you come across this brew in any form during it's short summer ""vacation", be sure to grab one and experience the Love!"
""
""
""
"Overall, while I can appreciate the lightness of this beer, since it is meant to be summer fare, and while the flavors are present in good strength, the beer as a whole doesnâ€™t seem to mesh well. Thereâ€™s simply too many lemon and dried hay flavors in here, and they get in the way of everything else. The extra-bitter aftertaste is also strange, drying out the mouth and leaving the drinker wanting another sip to refresh the palate. Iâ€™d imagine this beer would be great with a good barbecued burger or a hot dog, but as a stand-alone beverage it doesnâ€™t quite balance out."

" This beer is light, but has a ton of flavor and a very clean mouthfeel. Summer Love is a perfect name to describe this beer. Incredibly easy to drink, and very thirst-quenching. Another fine effort by Bill and Ron. While we have Victory in Minnesota, why have I not seen this until a recent trip across the border into Wisconsin?"
"Overall: Reminiscent of their prima pills, which is by no means a bad thing. Another winner from victory, perfect for the season."
"highly sessionable, give me more summer love please!"
""
"Overall: not impressed. Pretty quaffable but even after a run in a ga. 95 degree, high humidity (perfect time to find out session drink ability), not too impressive."

"Poured from bottle into Brooklyn tulip glass. Pours a clean, crisp yellow transparent color. Nice fluffy head fills the glass, leaves some lacing around the glass. Nice looking summer beer! Smell- herbal, floral hops. Almost a rosey aroma. Really nice. There is a grassy quality to it too. Taste- clean, crisp, hoppy, with a tiny bit of malt sweetness on the end. This is just so clean, crisp, refreshing. So incredibly drinkable- it has some german pilsner qualities to it, but also some really nice hop presence that you might find in a pale ale. This is just a perfect summer beer, I will be buying it all summer for sure. Well done!"
""
""
"MOREYâ€™S BOTTOM LINE: Without a doubt one of my favorite summer beers. Ultra-drinkable, yet full of flavor. At 5.2% itâ€™s pretty session-friendly too. If Iâ€™m reviewing to style (which I am), I canâ€™t imagine there being a much better Blonde Ale than this one right here. Victory has done for Blonde Ales what they did for Pilsners. Highly recommended!"
"Summer Love is tremendously flavorful in its simplicity. Easily in the top tier of the style. Recommended."
"It's a decent beer for the summer. A little too bitter and grassy for my taste."
"Overall: A very impressive take on the lighter ""Blonde"" style. Very nice hop bite for a lighter beer. Like Prima Pils, Victory is great at taking lighter styles to another flavorful level."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For what this is meant to be, this pretty much nails the style. Well done."
""
""
"Overall: For a Blonde Ale, this really is a home run. Almost comes across as a blend of a Kolsch ad an IPA."
""
""
""
""
"The body is light with good carbonation. Leaves a nice bitter finish. Overall this one is very impressive. One of the better summer seasonals I've had. I'm sure to grab this multiple times."
""
""
"The palate opens crisp, snappy, dry and cracker-like with a wonderful hop resin oiliness that brings forth flavors of lemon, jasmine, grass and a touch of soap. The malt character is very light, with drying flavors of water crackers, and just a hint of sweetness. Wonderful hop flavor here. Drying and resiny on the finish, this beer is light in body with a moderate carbonation. Incredibly drinkable, this comes with highest recommendations."
""
""
"The above translates to the feel as well; this is an extremely light style that drives brewers to make a beer that's just thin. This one, though, is light without giving anything up. Crispness never fades off, and it remains very smooth all the way as well. Not perfect, but perhaps perfect for the style."
""
"Pours clear straw with a big persistent head. Smell is mild but has a nice citrus hop note which I really like. Taste is very well balanced. Moderate light malt sweetness. Herbal hops- again a slight citrus note, and clean sharp bitterness through the finish. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Sessionable. Really great for what it is. Somehow I did end up drinking this while watching a baseball game which I think is ideal. Very nice summer beer."
""
""
""

"O: I liked this, I would definitely get it again. Right there next to me while I'm grilling is where I'll find this one this summer."
""
""
""
"I think I've found one of my new favorite beers for the summer. Well done Victory."
""
""
"Palate is sharp and astringent upfront, and slowly fades through to teh finish. Super grassy and citric peel hops. Smooth, light toasty cracker malts. I would think this is a pilsner from the look, smell and taste of it. Either way, this is a hoppy, astrungent, lawnmower, baseball game in the garage beer."

""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy whitish yellow with a white head. A bready, piney, and citric aroma. Flavor followed suit. Starts off doughy bread, a thick wall bitterness quickly comes in, that flows into some pine and citric fruit. Medium bodied with some carbonation. Overall, a pretty decent and enjoyable brew. One of those beers that works well with the warm weather as its got some bright flavors to it, though it isn'tjuicy and refreshing like I have come to expect from a summer seasonal. That uniqueness though is a point in this beers favor."
""
""
"One of my favorite summer beers. Thank heavens there's a good American Blonde out there so that I don't have to pick some silly wheat beer. 4.0"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what an excellent beer! The aroma is just out of this world. My one complaint would be the bitterness feels a little too much for the style but it is a mild complaint. Unfortunately I can't buy this in my area but I am definitely stocking up on my next trip out of town."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear gold with one finger of white foam, a few spots left on the glass after it settles to a thin ring. Smell: spicy, light citrus and evergreen, grape, pale malt in back. Taste: semi-sweet pale malt, white grape, light spiciness and lemon rind. It's fine, a little soapy though, refreshing, but not special. Best by Sept 2012."
"O - Victory's done it again! I've yet to have a bad beer from Victory, and this one keeps that streak going! Perfect for a hot summer day, it really does taste like they've bottled summer itself up into a bottle, and I don't feel as though I can officially have a ""good"" summer any longer until I grab a case of this to drink. Great beer!"
""
""
""
""

"Another quality brew from Victory. Ive had their beers in Philly and bottles in SF. This particular style is straight forward: it's summer and summer calls for light style beer. Goes without saying that this is a session beer. Really enjoyable lager. I would purchase again."
"a very german or czech pils style summer brew. pours clear honey colored with a one inch white head and very large bubbles slowly rising to the surface. smells like german malts and bittering hops. refreshing aroma. flavor is a little bready from the malts, perhaps making this not the most appropriate style of beer for the season, but its on the lighter side of the malt spectrum and doesnt weigh it down too much. crisp hops at the end, some floral yeast in the background. feel is good, medium carbonation and a medium body, not filling, but not that light either. overall not a bad beer, but certainly not my favorite new summer offering this season."
"Surprisingly potent nose on this stuff, full of grass and grains, herbs and spice. Big noble hop character here, and big flavor profile in general. Crisp and clean grainy finish, but with an impressive 1-2 punch of Noble (grassy) and American (citrus). A great combination of quenching and flavorful, Summer Love is a standard setter in a generally weak style. Get some of this."
"It had a nice golden straw color body with a nice 2""white head that lay down quickly. The smell was very citrus (lemon and lime). The taste is the same as the smell lemon tasting with a hint of lime and a little bit of malt but just a little bit. The mouth feel is great and overall a very refreshing beer."

"Overall it lacked what I expected. Unfortantly victory has not lived up to it for me. But hey that just my take."
"Overall a nice blonde. Not my favorite style to begin with, but overall this is a solid representation."
"O: This brew was a pleasant surprise but I guess I shouldnâ€™t be surprised because Victory has a good beer. This brew was light and refreshing."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy, straw yellow color. There was a very small white head on it that didnâ€™t linger long. Nice aroma to this one. Floral, grassy, hint of lemon in the back ground. The taste is good. Slightly lighter body, just a faint whiff of bitterness and a slight dryness. Slight lemon flavor, with grassy a slight graininess. Very crisp and refreshing. An excellent summer choice!"
"Overall impression: very drinkable, lots of flavor without being overwhelming. Great lighter option."
"O: Worthy of multiple purchases, very quaffable and flat out great."
"Extremely refreshing. You know, if someone said that Victory has stuck a different label on their Prima Pils, and called it an Ale I'd believe it. That's no bad thing, given that that's a great beer, but it also does feel a little like this beer is unnecessary as a result."
"M: A good way to start the day, mild with a nice malty/citrusy blast."
"A light, white frothy head crowned the hazy golden brew, and a fruit smell wafted from the glass. I was impressed with the complexity of this 5.2%-ABV ale -- the lemon flavor mixed very well with the hoppy taste which yielded an extremely quaffable beer. The first sip and each subsequent taste was a delight. I love tasting the hops in a beer, and the mixture of hops and lemony-fruity-goodness in this particular libation was extremely satisfying."
"Iâ€™m always up for trying different beers on cask here at Victory, as you never know how some are going to translate, and this was no different. While it may have lost some of its crispness in translation, it definitely opened up the hop profile a bit more, with extra citrus flavors and a touch more aggressiveness shining through here. I canâ€™t really say if I liked this more than my experiences with the draft or bottled versions of this but Iâ€™m glad that I gave it a shot, as it ended up being flavorful and easy drinking enough to keep me happy on this visit."
"Smell is wonderfull. Hoppy and crisp together. Very drinkable beer with no complcations at all. Wish i had a few more of these beers in my fridge!"
"Overall, an OK subdued hoppier blonde ale. Not too exciting."
"Missed this one in Philadelphia last June so was happy to see it show up in six-packs in San Diego at the Super Junior beer museum. One of my favorite lighter beers I've tried this summer."
"I love Victory beers, and drinkin at the ballpark... but I'm not sure this is much better than any average adjunct lager... give me an old style at wrigley for a third the price..."
"It's a decent blonde ale - I would say a bit better than average. It has a nice balance to it."
"Lighter medium body, milder carbonation, creamy and smooth on the tongue. Crazy drinkable, decent flavor, and one of the better blonde ales I've had recently."
"Comes out of the bottle a clear straw yellow with a typical white head - not inspiring, but never judge a book by its cover! Strong aroma is malty with a yeasty undertone and hints of citrus and hops. Sunny flavor has a malty core and a strong, slightly sour citrus note, as well as hints of hops and apple. Average-bodied texture has a nice tingle to it. Great for summer, or saying goodbye to the bloomin' hot weather."
"Very pleasant blonde ale; not a style I'd normally get, but I really appreciate the hops here: not overly strong, but plenty to taste."
"Grainy and lively carbonation. Finish is crisp and refreshing. Great hop character. This is a great summer beer. I'll have to stock up on some of this next year."
"Poured into a pint glass, golden yellow with a fluffy white head that laced well. Light aroma, floral, organic and hoppy. Light taste, grassy, floral, lemon zest, refreshingly hoppy and flavorful without being strong at all. Light-bodied and drinkable."
"Had on tap at the Beer Store in Southampton. This stuff looks like a pilsner, smells like cat piss, tastes like a mass produced BMC product. I had to power through this one. God is this gross. I'm not quite sure where this went wrong, or if this is just the epitome of a beer that's just ""not my type'l but there's no love lost here."
"Great summer beer"
"Could this be the greatest summer beer? Quite possibly in my opinion. It seems as though it is dry hopped, I could be wrong but it has a nice cloudy look which is usually apparent in dry hopped beers. It is crisp, refreshing, a bit lemony. The thing with summer beers is a lot of time you lose the hops and just get the wheat. This is not a wheat beer but a summer ale. And it has a nice mellow hoppiness which is surprising. It must be the noble hops, I'm not sure but I could just stick my head mouth under the tap, open up and say ahhh! Especially on a hot humid summer night. If you ever see it, try it, you won't be disappointed!"
"This beer is obscene in its drinkability. I can see what victory was gunning for with this brew and I think they really hit the nail on the head. More flavorful than many blonde ales I have had and quite refreshing. Still, even on a hot summer day I think I could go for something with a bit more kick. I donâ€™t see myself picking this up over Prima Pils or another quality pilsner or APA."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a 1 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random spots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt, some grassy notes, and a citrus zest aroma. Taste is of sweet malt, grasses, and a bitter citrus zest. Mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good blonde ale with a nice hop presence. A good Summer beer from Victory."
"A decent summer brew. Not something I would seek out again but did enjoy what I had."
"This is a great summer ale. Strong citrus (grapefruit/lemon zest) and grassy flavor work for this refreshing blonde ale. I had a few of these on a very hot 90 degree day mowing my lawn, and it was one of the most refreshing beers I have ever had on a hot day. The mouthfeel was smooth, refreshing, and easy to drink. Carbonation was lively, but just right for this style. Overall, just a great summer ale. Highly recommended, and you will love the dog days of summer with Summer Love from Victory."
"I've never had a beer that goes better with a good burger. Despite the silly name this is a remarkably well wrought beer. The pour is a bright yellow with a little cloudiness revealing the unfiltered yeast. The head is white and becomes lacy in a few minutes. The aroma is a pretty subtle combination of lemony and herbal notes. But the taste is where this beer excels. The fine hops that are so prominent in Victory's Hop Devil are beautifully rounded off with malt and bread and a little lemon combination that is really satisfying and refreshing. The only problem with this blonde ale is that you have a hard time not having another as soon as your glass is empty."
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color ale with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of light sweet cereal with light floral undertones. Taste is also dominated by light floral notes with some refreshing cereal with a subtle hoppy finish. There were some light unrefined grain notes that were also perceptible as the beer warmed up which I wasnâ€™t too fond of. Body is about average with good carbonation. Good but not as great as I was expecting based on previous ratings."
"M/D - Medium body may be a little low on carbonation. Nice beer, but I wish it ended a bit drier/crisper."
"It was hard to judge the smell on this beer because it was very faint but from what I could gather you could tell some garden and minty aromas. Taste was also very herbal and minty, a bit medicinal as well with some metallic taste mixed into it. Decent carbonation. Overall, a decent beer to freshen up a little during hot days but lacking some tones and variety in the taste."
"12oz Bottle, won in beer tasting at ABC. Fresh, malty aroma. Flavors are crisp, clean and bright, with a breezy freshness. Surprised at how flavorful this beer is. Where most Golden Ales are listless, flawed, too chewy or with distracting side notes, this one is very drinkable. Nice hoppy flavor mid-taste. Light-to-medium body. Average carbonation. Clean finish. I really look forward to each sip. Solid work. I had not been a big fan of victory til now, but I think more of them after this offering."
"Light golden in color with a medium level of haze and cloudiness to it that obscured a bit of the sunlight poking through. Nice head of white capped the top and settled down smoothly and evenly, creating a decent broken crown that ringed the side of the glass and kept some nice lacing. Aroma was light, and this would be a trend throughout the day. Light notes of peach and light grain are really all that is coming through right now. Warming brought a smidge of citrus to it, but nothing really standing out here for me at all. Crisp, clean flavor"
"D: No gimmicks, just well done and supremely drinkable summer time beer â€“ or anytime beer. Other than the slight off-note in the nose, I really like it."
"Appearance is a bright yellow tone with a thin white head that leaves some lace after taking a couple sips. This one is more aromatic than other blonde ales with a nice lemon zest to it and some white bread. It has a taste of hops, citrus and grass. This has a body that is a bit thin, but finishes crisp. A very good beer for a warm summer day."
"O - a mix of good and bad. Rather striking contrast between aroma and taste."
"Pretty good summer brew here. Nothing fancy or exciting, but it has more character than many summer beers."
"O: I may get some heat for this, but I've decided to rate this beer to style, and since that is the case, I don't feel this one deserves any less than an A."
"I get more of the hoppiness in the taste, but this one isn't bitter or harsh at all. There seems to be hints of citrus and even apricot in there. A delicious and palate-pleasing summer brew with tons of nuance and flavor, all the while remaining light and drinkable. Winner!"
"O: I'll definitely be getting more- this is a fantastic summertime beer, tasty and well-made."
"O: Very drinkable... perhaps my new favorite summer seasonal. Light and refreshing, yet tasty... mmm."
"O: If you're into light, authentic German style beers, this could be your go-to beer of the summer. The sessionable ABV and light, clean flavors make it inoffensive and enjoyable on many levels, for the summer that is. Victory even does light beer well, not shocking."
"Overall: A great beer that does what it's supposed to do. Quench and refresh during the summer months. This is a straight forward, no frills, offering from Victory thats perfect when grilling."
"Drink- Tasty, balanced and a little hops bitter. It was a nice cold refreshing beer. I might go back for a six pack."
"Picked up a case at my local distributor. This beer pours a clear light gold with excellent carbonation and small white head. Smells of floral and faint citrus hops. A little lemon character is in there. Tastes crisp, light and refreshing with a kiss of bitterness at the end. Kind of has a Granny Smith apple taste to it (which I really dig). An awesome session beer. Takes a couple of beers to get accustomed to, but in no time I found myself flying through these. I think I just found my new go-to beer for the summer! Another great job by Victory."
"Overall a very refreshing crisp beer. I've heard good things about this and wasn't disappointed. One of the better summer beers I've had. Definitely more flavor than your average summer ale."
"O: This is a very nice blonde ale. It has considerable Kolsch characteristics with a hoppy American twist. I wish they had this beer at the ballpark, I'd be happy."
"A very good Blonde Ale! It's really a Pilsner but fermented with an ale yeast and has a little more ester profile to show from it. Pours like a Pilsner, and has a medium hop aroma. Another great beer from Victory, I haven't tried anything from them I didn't like!"
"The characteristics of this beer are very good for a blond. The coloring and head are perfect. The head is very light. The bubbles are light, and the body is enjoyably thin. The flavors are decently complex for a blond. I can't tell the ABV, but I am guessing that the alcohol content makes this drinkable all day. I am just sorry that I only bought one small bottle to try."
"This beer pours a hazy blonde color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of bready malt, and mild spicy hops. The taste has some nice light bready, toasty malt notes, with only a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice blonde ale that I could drink again if in the mood for something light and refreshing."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is a bit mild, some hops, some citrus notes. Taste is good, hops, citrus, some malts, very refreshing. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a very good summer beer."
"This beer was much lighter than I expected and a lot more bitter. Overall it was a very refreshing beer for a hot summer day. Not my favorite style but I appreciated it."
"This beer pours with about a half inch of white fluffy head, which dissipates leaving some spotty lacing on the side of the glass. It is a clear brilliant golden beer. Very nice looking. There is something weird happening in the nose. Something making me think I maybe got a bad bottle. there is a little bit of an odd maybe rubberband aroma masking some grainyness and a bit of herby hops. Kind of offputting, and making me not look forward to taking that first sip. After that aroma smacked me in the face, the flavor is surprisingly not that bad. Has a lot of herbey hops and nice grainy malt character. There is a very mild mirroring of that problem from the aroma, but it is not very present. The mouthfeel isn't overly light, which makes me suspect that this is not an infection, but it is a little bit astringent. Light medium body with ok carbonation. I really don't know what to make of this beer. It didn't make me want to get another, but I would like to see if this was a bad bottle or if this is really what this beer is like."
"O: This may actually be the best lawnmower beer. Light, refreshing, and with a good hop dosage to give it some zest."
"A great beer for those dog days."
"Cheers!"
"-Cheers"
"Overall: This is is a sure shot for a nice refreshing summer brew. It's balanced, light enough, and tasty. I'd get this one again."
"O: The more I drink the less I love Summer Love. I understand that the style calls for a malt-forward approach, but the paper and hay indicate something is amiss.Â "
"This is a well balanced, easy drinking beer. It doesn't fill you up and is refreshing on a hot summer day."
"O - a very good summer beer."
"O: This is highly drinkable but it's too similar to the rest of the boring Summer brews."
"Overall, another good brew from Victory. Refreshing with good flavor."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a very enjoyable beer and one of the best I've had of the style. The hoppiness was very nice in it, especially for the lower abv. I was definitely impressed with this beer relative to it's style and abv."
"Overall: Very highly-drinkable. Enough hop flavor to keep the beer from being boring, and the body of the beer almost teeters on the brink of being watery. If Victory was shooting for a summer gateway and/or high-end lawnmower beer, they hit the target straight-on."
"Wonderful summer brew, one of the better attempts out there. I'm a bit reluctant to give this a higher overall grade as I just bought a single. I'd want to see how this rolls after 2-3. Very worthy."
"O: Overall very drinkable, spicy and dry citrus hops work well with the grainy pilsner malt making this a great summer time crisp drinker and one I could drink all day with no complaint. Crisp lager like drinkability with a pale ale amount of hops."
"overall, one of the better summer beers I've had."
"Overall: This is a nice beer to drink in the warm weather. Not a lot going on, but I enjoyed it."
"Even if this was a bit stronger in the alcohol department, I could have easily had another one in my sitting. This beer reminded me of sunny days and a fresh-cut lawn without the humidity and dehydration that ruins so many outdoor ventures in the Summer. If you're a fan lighter beers that don't taste light or a seasonal worthy of you're hard-earned money, you owe it to yourself to go out and get this. It is that good!"
"Overall: A very solid summer beer when you're looking to break from the wheat/fruit thing. It's clean, crisp, and refreshing. Definitely another solid beer in the Victory lineup."
"Pours a clear golden color with a two-finger white head and some spotty lacing on the way down. Thin white cap throughout. The nose brings a bit of light citrus hops and a slight floral character. Light grain is there as well. Flavor is slightly bready and grainy with some slight hop flavor. Body is light and crisp with good carbonation and a light bitterness to the finish. Well done."
"The taste has a lemony hop flavor which seems to originate from noble hops as the flavor is familiar and herbal with some tinges of musty yeast and pils malt fills out the body with some light sweetness augmenting the taste with a gentle sweetness and a nice tea like hop dominates with herbal and slight grassy note. the lightly toasted tinges carry on with nice dry taste in the finish. This blonde really demonstrates that a low abv beer can have a good amount of flavor, the hop presence adds the counter balance to the malt with a refreshing quality and light acidity which makes this quaffable and has a refreshing quality perfect for summer because it doesn't makes you sweat from high alcohol and this fits the style well, another high quality brew from Victory!"
"O- a great summer brew that drinks like a pils nice crisp flavor highly drinkable and tasty..like a prima pils light to me"
"The beer is a pale yellow with a thin white head. I really don't know how to describe this smell, it is very funky and fruity, I could smell peach and mango with a light citrus accent. The taste has a very different bitterness, it is lemony and funky with flavors of mango and a bready finish. The beer is light with good moderate carbonation and a very dry finish. This is a perfect summer beer for me, lots of interesting hop flavor and very refreshing."
"O- I try to review beers by style, and this is a very nice, light, flavorful summer beer. As the bottle implies, this would be perfect for a summer pic nic, day at the beach or ball park, etc."
"The beer poured a nice light yellow color that produced a very nice 2-finger, foamy head that was decently retained. The aroma of the beer was a little weaker than expected, but still good...some citrus hops mixed together with a bready component. The taste of the beer is of the quality that one would expect from this brewery, a nice strong flavor that follows the nose well. A nice does of fruitiness and bready malts. The beer was crisp, clean and very enjoyable as I sat on my back porch in the 100 degree heat of Georgia in the summer. The beer did finish with a light bitterness and I did feel that the beer was perhaps a bit over-carbonated, but it did not really detract from the enjoyment of the beer. Overall, as stated before, another quality beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"What a refreshing brew! Very tasty! So easy to drink, I had to tell myself not to drink it all up in one sitting. Probably the best summer seasonal this year!"
"This brew pours fairly clear golden blonde color with a tiny cap. The aroma is bready hops, citrus, and hops. It never quite comes together properly, there's really no synergy on the nose. The taste is better, there's nice grassy and floral hops, some lemon, and bready malts. Very refreshing, with a nice hop kick. The mouthfeel is solid, it's well-carbonated and goes down easily. The drinkability is quite good, this one is really easy to drink. Overall, an enjoyable summer beer from Victory, it's delicious, easy-drinking, and has a nice hop kick to keep things interesting."
"O: really liked this but would have loved it with different hops-citra or amarillo possibly."
"O: I was expecting a little more out of Victory for this one. I'm a fan of this brewery, but I would seek other brews for a Blonde."
"Little less than a finger of clean white foam, mostly smaller to medium sized bubbles, above average retention for what head is there, in turn the lacing is wispy but lingers in thin lines across the glass sides. Bright golden colored liquid with loose bubbles percolating throughout, light metallic reflective sheen, no real hue change at the rims or glass bottom. The nose is full of pepper, rye, pumpernickel and then dried flowers, dried oranges, lemongrass and a forgiving overall herbal bite, hints of apricot or peach fruit, while thereâ€™s no clear malty sweet element it doesnâ€™t seem one-sided. Medium-bodied, the carbonation has some serious churn to it and gives it more energy than creaminess. Lots of green matter, earth and twigs/bark while remaining quaffable and never bitter. Pepper and some cumin to coriander, the flowers and mixed white citrus too dry to soak in. Pear, peach, apricot fruit more skin and pit than juice. Unprocessed grains and wheat germ around. When itâ€™s ice cold it is thirst slaking and has the scrubbing power to remind you itâ€™s there with each sip."
"Grainy and biscuit malts play second fiddle to the tantalizingly fresh spectrum of hop characteristics. Flows nicely from juicy flavoring hops to substantial bitterness at the end. Very refreshing, a summer blonde ale with personality and bite. Hops show some saaz-y-ness with a little warming and the beer is not totally unlike Prima. I would not get bored drinking a sixer of this at a BBQ or other summertime gathering. Victory has brought a few tasty new treats to Tx lately, and I thank ye for it!"
"M - Light body, but had a nice crisp finish. Lots of carbonation."
"O/D-For a summer Blonde Ale, I will compare it to Ipswich Summer. I personally find Ipswich Summer to be the superior brew. I enjoy the hop flavors more in the Ipswich. I also think that the mouthfeel here is not as good as it could be. Summer brews need a good feel, and this one is adequate at best. Not bad, not very memorable, glad I only bought a single."
"Overall--This, to me, is something along the lines of a ""light IPA."" It's simple, refreshing, and just different enough to stand out from other summer offerings. Unfortunately, the big hoppiness is just a bit distracting for a refreshing, simple summer beer, at least for my taste. (I will qualify this by saying that I generally prefer malty beers over hoppy ones.) Very much worth trying, just not a home run."
"This beer lives up to it's summertime name. Opposed to other beer that like to bog down their summer brews with honey and fruit this beer is crisp and refreshing, something you come to expect and want in an American Blonde. It looks smells and feels like summer. The tastes is nicely complemented by all of these, especially the carbonation. It tastes fresh with the right amount of hoppy tones. Just a classic summertime beer for the old open drink repeat ritual."
"D - A pretty standard summer ale. The spice character is quite nice in the aroma but becomes dull and a bit stale tasting in the flavor profile. Still, there are some malt and hop characteristics to help make up for the shortcomings of the spice flavor and it is a reasonably drinkable beer, overall."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent beer. The balance is a little hoppy in the flavor for my taste, but there are no fermentation flaws or anything...it is just a recipe thing. If you really dig hoppy beers, give this one a shot as it is pretty decent for a hoppy beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Bright medium gold with a fluffy white cap. Nose is bright and juicy, pleasant hops and some orange pulp, everything pleasantly restrained. Mouth is steadily and lightly bitter throughout, straightforward, through a fairly long finish. Light cereal grains and a touch of citrus. Light and pleasant, refreshing. Crisp and snappy, definitely has an edge like a pils but the nose is more pale ale."
"Overall: Unique blonde ale- more hops than the typical blonde ale in my opinion. Not sure if this would serve as a optimal summer thirst-buster, but a good experience nonetheless."
"Overall, a really nice 'pilsner.' Enjoyable and easy to drink. A nice amount of hops show. Well done."
"O: The Summer Love is the summer session. Although the ABV pushes a little bit out of the range of a true session, the beer is drinkable, tasty, and doesn't sit too heavy in the belly. The brew sets out to conquer the summer, and it comes out with a victory."
"Normally an advocate of all that is Victory, this beer was unimpressive. Not bad, just unimpressive. A slightly cloudy amber ale that smells and tastes just like any other ale. Unlike most summer seasonals that lean on the sweet side or at least citrusy, this ale does very little to stray from a basic ale. In fact, I'd imagine in a taste test it would not taste all that much different from Victory Lager, one of their staples. All in all not bad at all, in fact pretty good, but as a seasonal it is lacking in being something special."
"Overall: Very drinkable, bitter beer that I see as a good lawnmower beer. I could have a couple or just as well pass. Decent, not great"
"Pours cloudy golden with some haze. Foam disappears. Light malt smell. Light malty taste. Subtle buried hop. Mild bittering. Light carbonation. Blonde ale with some real body, not at all watery. Nice flavorful summer beer."
"D - Basic... Simple... Straight-forward... Not too shabby... No complaints, but I'm not sure I recommend nor seek out again in the future... Additionally, I love the label..."
"Summer Love pours a typical bright strawery yellow color, with a smaller head, but nicer then most other blond ales. For a blond ale there is a stronger smell, it smells crisp and just a tad hoppy. It has a dry flavor, kinda of like a straw flavor, or a cheap wheat like flavors, the hops just peak a little bit, which is nice. Stronger flavor for a blonde ale, decent carbonation. Overall I found it alright, better then some other blonde ales with a stronger flavor, but I just didnt find this very enjoyable."
"O - Again, not crazy about this style but I can definitely see myself picking up some of these to share with those who arent hop heads. Really like this'n"
"Overall, this beer is exactly as advertised. According to the label, this beer was brewed to be consumed during a baseball game on a hot summer day. I have to admit, that sitting in the heat at the ballpark or while at home cutting the lawn, this beer is perfect."
"I could drink a lot of these."
"Bottle from Premiere. Good hoppiness with a lighter mouthfeel. Seessionable alcohol. Golden with lots of white lace, a little head retention. Faintly hoppy aroma. Small tasty package, good drinkability. Carbonation right there.Something to beat the heat."
"The beer is crystal clear and light yellow in color, with an inch of fluffy white head that leaves ample lacing on the pint glass. An outstanding appearance. The aroma is of grain and earthy hops. The flavor offers grain and a pilsner like taste. The finish brings some nice hop bitterness. I am really enjoying this beer. Just got done mowing the lawn and popped this, and it has greatly exceeded my expectations. Overall, a really solid brew. I wish I had a few more in the fridge. I would buy a sixer of this."
"Notes: On 2014-05-07 I didn't enjoy this quite as much as the Columbia Kettle Works Blonde (2014-05-03), which had a more full mouthfeel, a bit more residual sweetness and not quite as many IBUs as this Blonde. However, on 2014-05-31 after having both again, I think this is as good and have raised by rating accordingly."
"This beer was something I wasn't too sure about. I really wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy it and I just figured I'd give it a shot since it was new and I had never had it before. The beer poured out like a typical pilsner or lager, it had a clear yellow color with a pretty good white head. The lacing wasn't the best here. The smell was a little grassy but had a good amount of hops to balance that out. The taste was great, it had a great amount of hops and it was just very simple. The mouthfeel was really refreshing. I must have drank this within a few minutes. I would buy this again if I was planning on drink several beers in a sitting. Overall it was very good."
"Pours out a nice golden blonde color, with a frothy, white lacy head. Smells like some floral tropical fruits, some herbal hops, and vaguely sweet malts. Just from the smell it could be a DIPA, but it tastes different. I am getting some nice bitter orange zest, some puckering lemon and spicey, herbal hops with a touch of bitter aspirin too but not in an off putting way. Wow! This is a very bold flavorful beer for such a low abv brew. Malts are slightly sweet and give balance to all the hops, almost like a wheat beer in its crispness. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated which is great for a hot Fourth of July Day. You know I was looking for ever elusive Gumballhead and decided to grab another six-pack of these and these have more than fit the bill for a refreshing, crisp, bold and hoppy low abv summer beer."
"Taste-Biscuit malt, citrus zest, soft kiss of citrussy hops. Clean finishing and very refreshing. Nice flavor and character for a lighter bodied beer. Nicely aromatic and tasty, perfect for outdoor gatherings. What a summer brew should be. I want another!"
"As far as summer ales go, this one is really well done. Its meant to be easy to drink, a thirst quencher, and a really well-balanced beer. It achieves all of these with ease. It starts with a nice clean taste of barley, wheat and maybe corn, followed by a healthy hit of some bitter pine or citrus hops. Definitely some grapefruit in there, hiding in the bitterness. The beer goes down so easily that its perfect for a hot summer day. Its one of those simple beers that beer snobs like us can sit there and analyze and pick out the complexities, and still enjoy the heck out of it. This is another really good beer from Victory. They do some pretty awesome stuff with hops."
"12 ounce bottle, label says enjoy by October 17, 2011. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear gold color with an inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is sweet malt, lemon peel and some light piney/grassy hops. I think the taste is just like the aroma, it's all sweet malt, lemon peel and pine/grassy hops. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and a bit slick with moderate carbonation. I think it's a decent enough brew, and a good brew for a hot day. I'd buy this again, $8.99 a sixer isn't a bad price for this brew. I think it's worth trying."
"O: This is a solid, light, airy, and enjoyable beer."
"One review said ""grassy", there is no grass in this beer! But either way. I was able to enjoy this beer out of a bottle poured into a pint glass while sitting down to a nice cheese pizza. Nice clean yellow color with a small hop content. I got a hint of bananna, I could be wrong, but I may be right? Enjoyed the lite bodied mouthfeel to the beer. Not ""wheat"" heavy like some summer style beers. Nice & easy drinking summer ale. Thank you Victory."
"O: Goes down very easily, very tasty, somewhat filling, low kick, nice representation of style. Blondes are starting to make presence in the northeast which I welcome - far too little attention has been given to this style. This is totally one that I'd drink of this style on the regular!"
"Enjoyed my first pint on draught in PA tonight and will seek out again whenever possible.."
"Pours a medium yellow with a nice tall head that sticks around and leaves lacing. The smell is hoppy upfront, but only some aspects of the hops like pine. The weird thing is you don't get much of that in the flavor, the pine is there but not as much as the smell would suggest. The flavor starts with the small pine then moves to a slight yeast/malt combo and finishes with a slight pine, but very refreshing taste. The mouthfeel is great, smooth and refreshing, great amount of flavor but not overpowering. Overall a great beer, nice for a hot summer night. Definitely worth checking out."
"This is a nice example of the style with just enough character to keep it in the style but not at all lacking."
"OA: One of the better summer style ales I've had in a while, It's a good brew and I am sure it will find it's place in my cooler again."
"D - Easy drinker with low ABV. I like it."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I initially wasnâ€™t expecting much from this beer but was quite pleased at how much I enjoyed it. It was both something nice to drink on its own, and Iâ€™ll be happy to do so again, and it was a pleasure to pair with food. My overall impression is that this is a winner. While it may not be world class it is quite good, quite enjoyable, and Iâ€™ll be having it again. Definitely a beer for a summer party and to enjoy with a light meal."
"The CPJ"
"I think this is a pretty damn good summer seasonal-it reminds me a little bit of Victory's Prima Pils with some American hops tossed in. Yummy, thirst quenching, and easy drinking. I'll definitely be drinking this one again."
"Light bodied with a uppity carbonation that settles out over time. Though that's not much of an issue as it's hard to do anything other than pound these back. Call it a lawnmower beer and I'd cut the grass more often. It's supremely refreshing."
"This brings me close to one of the reviewing goals on beeradvocate. With the exception of kvas (KVAS!!!) I have reviewed a top 3 beer from 103/104 styles on beeradvocate. Hooray me."
"Very little aroma, but it has a great refreshing flavor with tons of balance. More than you would expect given the translucent yellow body and low abv%. Just the right amount of sweet to balance the hops. Sweet German 2-row pils malt, grassy hops, lemon, dry apple, and crisp grain. High carbonation and light body. Highly drinkable. One of my favorite Summer beers."
"Overall, a very nicely done summer brew, soild malt and hop flavors and scents."
"For the style, this is very good. Pours a pale golden with excellent clarity and a decent head that sticks around as a cap. Some scant lacing. Light breadiness in the nose, a touch of lemony citrus, and some yeastiness. Pretty light. The taste is similar to the aroma, with some light breadiness, a touch of citrus, and some leafy bitterness as well. Smooth, a bit soft, and some light, late fruitiness on the finish. Not bad."
"Pours a very faintly clouded straw yellow, cap of fizzy white head gone quickly. Scent is clean and mild, notes of sweet malt, fresh dried grain, lemon, lightly floral and faintly herbal. Taste follows scent, clean and refreshing, faintly sweet and faintly lemony, touches of fresh grain, flowers and vague minty/herbal touch at the end. Lighter side of medium, moderately high carbonation. While neither bold nor standout in any one area, it is a great refreshing beer for the summer, if more widely available a case of this would be my regular tailgate/BBQ beer."
"Victory Brewing seems to be heading in an interesting direction releasing beers such as Summer Love and Headwaters Pale Ale. Rather than going more extreme, they seem to be going for more mass market appeal with smaller, simpler, more drinkable beers. Iâ€™m good with that. Summer Love is good beer (as is Headwaters). Summer Love really is a nice, drinkable beer to kick back with this time of year. Iâ€™m enjoying it. Easy recommendation."
"Musically I'd pair this beer with second chance by Peter Bjorn and John"
"This is a very good Blonde ale. Some bonus points for being in a category that is filled with many sub-par beers. Hops may not quite be to style, but they certainly add a great element to this beer. Would get again."
"O: A very drinkable beer- I could definitely have a few of these at the ballpark and enjoy life. This is one I feel comfortable drinking more quickly, and something to be enjoyed for beer's sake."
"Very drinkable to say the least. Really pushes the American Blonde Ale category and bridges on the gap of APA in general. It is quite easy to put back a few of these. Summer love indeed."
"Medium bodied with a good balance of floral, bitter hops, pale malt, spice and fruit notes. Crisp hop bite up front that provides some dry bitterness and compliments the earthy grass and straw notes. This is countered by the sweet malt and hints of apple, pear and lemon. Well balanced and easy to drink, especially during the warmer months. I was a little nervous by the initial appearance but this beer is pretty complex and flavorful. Pretty nice for this time of year."
"On tap at the Mellow in Greensboro.Poured into a standard pint a clear light golden with a sticky 1/2 finger bone white head.Citric and herbal hops dominate the nose along with a toasted malt base,really liked the big play on the hops.Flavors of citrusy hops provide the main flavor component along with light herbalness,a dryer toasty malt base holds true to the finish.This is a great summer beer,a great hop profile and very drinkable,well done Victory."
"I wish this was as cheap as Bud, I'd drink it all G-D summer long. The best commercial lawnmower beer I've ever had."
"Poured a nice golden color with a 1 finger bubbly head. Head faded to a 1/8", but clung to the sides very well and was constantly refreshed from a reasonable amount of carbonation rising from the bottom. Aroma was hoppy with a tad of sweetness, maybe vanilla and bananas. Pleasant, not overpowering in any shape or form. Taste was fairly plain, not much flavor at all. Very faint touch of lactose type sweet upfront, but that quickly gave way to a hoppy bitterness. The bitter faded with time, but wasn't replaced with much of anything. Felt a little watery in the mouth, and the carbonation was a bit sharp and overpowering tickling the tongue. Overall was a bit on the mediocre side. Not what I would imagine a summer beer to be."
"O- Pass the Festina peche please"
"Pretty good summertime beer! Served with a nice white, medium sized, foamy head that settled down to a light cover and lots of lace. Color was a clear amber yellow with some bubble trails. Aroma was grain, malt, fresh cut grass, and a little fresh hop. Flavor was very similar to nose. Body is good and so is carbonation. Was a little sharp on the tongue. Finish is medium long and like flavor. Session beer."
"Drinkability/overall- its easy to drink but overally simple i would say just really one dimensional, its just a very simple hoppy beer that lacked a malt backbone which i guess makes sense for the style but just certainly nothing that wows you, inoffensive but a pass for me"
"Pours a clear straw color with a nice white head. Good retention and excellent lacing.Lots of bubbles. Aroma is of tart fruit with a hint of piney hops.Nice, but a bit weak. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is a good balance of floral hops and malts.Light bitterness. Very nice Summer(or anytime) beer."
"Overall, a good hoppy blonde that went down smooth on this 102 degree afternoon. Still prefer a good wit on a hot day but this wasn't bad. Avail here in TX. Rotation - glad I tried it but one is probably enough for me with maybe at least one tap try. [N;O]"
"Clear, bright yellow with a thin layer of fine white bubbles coating the top of the beer. Decent head retention with some short-lived spotty lacing. Hoppy aroma, a combination of floral and mild citrus, more zesty than juicy. There was a little bit of a cereal grain smell too, but very mild and only noticeable once the beer had warmed. It was pleasantly bitter, not overpowering but balanced in this direction rather than towards malt sweetness. More of the same floral and citrus zest hop character, biscuity malt and a hint of herbal hops lingered in the finish. Refreshing. Light bodied with moderate carbonation composed of fine bubbles, a little dry. Quite good overall and it tasted really fresh and lively."
"Cheers!!"
"This may have become my summer grass cutting beer this year. It's not something I'd pick if I'm sitting down to really get into a beer, but it's perfect for bbqs or working outside."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Light straw yellow in color with poerfect clarity. Poured with a dense, foamy white head that reduced to a thick wispy cap. Big floral hop aromas up front with buttery and biscuity malt aromas beneath. Medium bodied with refreshing, tangy carbonation. Intense fLoral hop flavors that slowly taper from beginning to end with a light biscuity malt aroma. Would have liked a bit more malt presence. Finishes very clean with just a hint of bitterness. A good refreshing summer ale."
"Pours crystal-clear, lite-yellow. A very slightly off-white head patches the glass well. Smell is mild biscuit and mineral. A decent amount of noble bitterness at the top, dissolving into that mild malt base, including the mineral. Aftertaste is grassy and bitter, even a tad sour. An easy drinker. Tastes like a light beer, but that's alright for summer.."
"Overall - I love this beer. Probably the first ""summer ale"" seasonal beer for summer that I really think is outstanding. Most others are blah, but this one is really well made in flavor, drinkability and great for warm weather consumption."
"Victory Summer Love Ale is a super clear, pale yellow ale with an airy white head that has good retention and lacing. It has a very citrusy, orange aroma with a note of light grain. It smells a little sweet. It's medium-light bodied and very smooth with a crisp, dry finish. It's lightly bittered and quite flavorful. It tastes like light grain with a good amount of orange and grapefruit. The balance is perfect. It's incredibly quenching. This is everything a summer ale should be."
"With a normal pour, this brew formed a massive foamy head. Yellow/gold in color with high clarity. Smell is somewhat nuetral and muted. A little bit of sweet malt scent. Flavor is much better than the nose. The palate is balanced nicely between sweet malts and citrus hops. There is also a noticeable twang that separates this ale from pilsners. Finishes crisp with a soft hop bitterness. Pretty nice summer ale here and is certainly worth a try."
"Overall - Solid and easy to drink. About as good as any other blonde ale out there. Not as smooth as most, has some hops to it, but other then that, a great summer drinker."
"Not far from what one would expect from a summer ale. For a Blonde Ale it brings nice malt and hop flavor. As usual, most Victory beers are worth a try, especially for the low price."
"Pretty tasty, sessionable. Not a bad summer beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thin head. Decent head retention and lacing. Huge citrus hops in the aroma with a bit of an herbal component. The taste is citrus and earthy hops with faint pale malty notes. light bitterness, and the bitterness lingers. Medium bodied. A little off balance, but good, and very interesting. Seems there is some yeasty character in there I can't describe."
"O- This is a great beer for summer. It is smooth, has a lot of flavor, and would be easy to drink a few in one sitting. I picked up a bottle because it was something I hadn't seem before from Victory and I will definitely be picking up more this summer."
"Poured a very pale color, similar to a pilsner in looks, very clear with nice lively head about one finger. Smelled herbal. Rosemary? Taste was also slightly herbal, but I think I also tasted some Rye in the mix. Very intriguing, and very delicious. Mouthfeel was nice, cleansing in a way. This one is very easy to drink and has great flavors, mild, but ever present. Will be looking for more."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, peppery and pine like hops, kind of like Hop Devil. In the taste, starts pine and ends citrus. A lighter malt, almost notes of wheat. A hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry pine hop in the aftertaste. A nice hop profile in a summer beer. Dare I say, Hop Devil light?"
"its not too bitter and like I said perfectly balanced with the delicious sweet grain malts. It's like their Headwaters Pale Ale but this is a bit sweeter, grainier and has a slightly different hop taste but not too different of one. At first I thought this beer would be boring or uneventful since its just a standard blonde ale but the hop flavors bitterness and that wonderful sweetness really round the beer out into a fantastic sessionable summer beer."
"I don't have time for a full fledged review but I feel this beer is underrated and needs someone to represent. This along with Sierra Nevada Summerfest has become my go-to summer beer. Clear and refreshing but still full of flavor. If you're looking for some details maybe I'll come back later and give a proper review. I don't often pick up cases but I'm contemplating..."
"There isn't a ton to say about this beer, but I believe they hit what they were aiming for here: a flavorful, but very accessible and refreshing beer to enjoy during a ballgame or other summertime activity. Good stuff."
"Well executed Summer session ale, with enough flavor to keep one interested yet not bogged down with body. Light golden pale malts with a bright white head form thick down the sides of my glass. It has some German hops coming through in the nose with herbal mild citrus and a touch of earthy hops going on, pale semi sweet malts with a bit of slightly Belgian like spice accents, I'm guessing from the type of yeast used? Tried many new beers over the weekend at the Penn Brewfest but this is one of the new beers I've seen in Pittsburgh at retail outlets that got me ready for Summer. It's an odd mix flavor wise traditional German hop profile with some Belgian spicy yeast notes. Overall interesting but it doesn't go down as easy as you would think based on the description I've had about two bottles and I think I will definitely spread out the remaining four. Headwaters Pale begs to be drank in number this one, is solid but not as sessionable."
"Overall, a great summer brew. Up there with Sierra Nevada's Summerfest in my opinion."
"Overall my favorite summer session ale hands down is the headwaters but this is a pretty good one two. Would not be offended to have a six pack in one sitting."
"o: with a name like summer love I was expecting a good session beer find for the summer. I thought this will be filled with all of my favorite things. Rather, I get a very average ale with lackluster pop on the palette and no real need to venture into Ohio beer stores on a quest to locate. It is not bad, by any mean...just very average. Not the brew I'd Love to have all Summer...I can think of several pales I'd take instead in a heartbeat. Very average here."
"Thanks to my brother's random buying habits, I was able to split this bottle with VDubb86 while watching us some Ghost Adventures. Right on. Anyway, it pours a clear amber-straw (emphasis on the latter) topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises mandarin orange, grapefruit, leek, caramel, and light lemon zest. The taste holds notes of lemon peel, wheat, flowers, and orange peel. Gotta say, my tongue was let down after what my 'strils had reported just moments prior. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a nice blonde, but the smell wrote a check the taste just could not cash. Still not all bad, just not great by any means."
"A tasty Blonde Ale with a good hop kick. Great beer for the warmer weather."
"Overall, a really nice summer offering from Victory. Clean, crisp and refreshing. Will be adding Summer Love to my summer beer rotation."
"O - Easy drinking, lighter alcohol level, and a fine beer for a hot summer day. Reminds me a bit of Southern Tier's Hop Sun...although I haven't had one of those this year yet."
"Crystal clear straw color with a fat, pure-white head of frothy suds. Oily, grassy, herbal hop aroma. Cereal grain, zesty citrus juice, and peppercorn. Slick citrus oil flavor finishing with some fresh malt. Quite a bit hoppier all around than I expected. Crisp, grassy, and spicy over a nice cracker-like base. Medium-light and very drinkable. Fresh! Not exactly to style, but another well-crafted beer from Victory..."
"Light in feel, ""wet"" and slightly watery but with a crisp hop bitterness that balances. Mildly hopped, grassy and bitter like dandelion. Lightly crackery pilsner malt flavor, dry finish. Refreshing. It has a pedestrian character though that reminds me of ballpark macros in the summer. There is some hop nuance there, and the flavors are clean, just not a lot to keep you interested. For summer bbq's this is the beer to transition your craft-novice friends, but there are far better craft blonde ales out there."
"This is the type of beer that one could have at a pool party or at a BBQ. This is a beer that everyone can enjoy for the summer."
"I think my 6-pack purchase is justified here. I had no clue what to expect going into this beer but I've come to trust Victory puts out quality beers. And it's really nice to see them bottling different ones - a very light, crisp and fairly typical profile for a Blonde Ale. Not bad, not their best."
"Overall: Works for me! Am I a terrible person to suggest this tastes like a light golden ale version of the Prima?"
"Overall, this isn't bad. It isn't the best I've had in the style, but it is very easy to drink, and I'd certainly prefer this over a BMC lager! Still though, I'd prefer Gossamer or Bombshell Blonde."
"Overall, its good and very drinkable. More citrus than sweet, which i love. But im not completely sold, id like it to have more body and punch. A decent beer, and i appreciate Victory's recent push to start bottling and distributing a wider range of styles."
"YUM, WORTH TASTING!"
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink because the smoky aroma and taste is not overpowering."
"Victory makes lots of great beer, and Summer Love is no exception."
"I had this brew on draft. Poured a bright yellow/golden color crisp with a foamy white head. Lots of carbonated bubbles coming to the top. Smells of strong lemon zest and fresh cut grass. The flavor has some hay, grass, and lemon flavor, a hint of some grains more like cereal. Mouthfeel is pretty watery. The drinkable nature for me was hindered by the flavor. I did not really fully enjoy the flavor of the brew. I am glad I got to try it."
"D: Flavorful yet light in body makes this one a quaffer. Nice beer, real flavorful for a light style. Reminds me at times of a pilsner, at other times it's more like a Helles Lager, but a touch of sweetness says ""ale."" All in all, it goes down real easy, without packing a big punch, ABV-wise."
"FEEL/OVERALL: Good overall feel, well carbonated. Easy to drink and something I would definately have again. A perfect summer beverage."
"Drinkability: this was a superb beer that was very easy to drink. Several could be has in a session without getting bored. Really nice beer worth seeking out."
"Very light and very tasty. This one caught me by surprise and I highly recommend if you find it."
"Pale golden color with ample fizzz white head and with considerable lacing. Nose is pungent and full of grassy aromas. Very crisp and earthy. Flavor is much the same with a faint citrus profile. Malt is thin but present and slightly straw like. Very very refreshing and the most enjoyable Blonde I have ever had."
"Try this if you can find it in your local tavern."
"O: this is a great clean and fresh summer beer. Not heavy on the palate, but with a good dose of hop bitterne ss, with a steady malt backing. Pairs perfectly with a cheesesteak? You betcha!! Cheers to the boys up in PA."
"Overall a very easy to drink APA with an excellent use of hops."
"Drinkability: This was a very enjoyable beer that helped almost cleanse my palate after the three course lunch with three different styles of beer. It was a refreshing on a day that was too hot for me (high 80's). I can see myself drinking this at cookouts through the summer. Nothing spectacular, but not bad at all."
"I believe this beer is an excellent choice for those who enjoy some hoppiness in their beer, but are interested in a thirst quencher - crisp and refreshing. This is an excellent beer to enjoy on a warm summer night or kicking back at the beach!! I am not a huge fan of the color. The aroma is soothing and it had a nice lacing along the glass. I am sorry this is not offered through bottles!!"
"A special beer brewed in collaboration with Philadelphia ""With Love"" tourism board, is a pale ale made with german pale malt, and locally sourced water (duh). Summer Love was very pale in color almost blonde and had a nice tuft of foam on top. In appearance it could have passed for a pilsner, which is to say too pale for a pale ale. The smell is dominated mostly by grassy hops with a little tinge of lemon--there is a bit of sulfur in the aroma as the beer warms and a bit of cooked veggie. The taste was very nice and clean with light malt flavors, crisp hops and slightly citric finish. The beer was lighter in body than I would have liked, but was easy to drink and refreshing"
