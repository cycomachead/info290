I was a little surprised last summer when the Old Lady expressed her dismay at my pouring this way, but I like both the visual and the release of esters. This time, I got two foamy fingers of bone-white head that slowly collapsed on itself, leaving decent lacing in its wake. Color was a slightly hazy golden yellow (SRM = 4 - 5). Nose was very malty, but in a biscuit malt, not a sweet malt, way. Bring your Bare Ass closer, honey! Warming, it also began to take on a honey-like sweetness and now it was time for a sip. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the taste was very biscuit-like, making a nice counterpoint to the earlier Blonde. Finish was semi-dry, again more biscuit malty than sweet, and a nice choice on a humid Summer evening.","woodychandler","Jul 02, 2014"

3.46,2.1,3.5,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The beer poured a good clear old gold with a good white head. The aroma was of malt and hops but was very light. The taste was of light fruit with just a little hops. The feel was medium and wet making it a nice thirst quencher. This was a nice beer that would do for a session or two.","claytri","Feb 27, 2007"

3.65,7.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Served as a very pale yellow colored beer with modest white head. Smell is very light with some faint notes of summer fruits present. Taste is mainly a light maltiness mixed with some light fruits. Very easy to drink, very refreshing. A good beer for a hot summer afternoon.","tgbljb","Jul 01, 2004"

3.82,12.7,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Its clear, deep-gold bordering on amber body rests beneath a short lived head of bright white foam that drops to a thin collar and leaves little, if any, lace. The nose is clean and expresses a sweetish, straw-like maltiness with a slight fruitiness and just a suggestion of hops. It's smooth in the mouth with a medium body and a gently crisp and very fine, median carbonation. The flavor displays a grainy malt that's straightforward but clean, and balanced towards sweetness. It's clearly an ale with a nice bit of fruitiness that doesn't go overboard; and it finishes dry with some lingering grainy malt. It offers a good deal of drinkability as it does have some real character to it; and it pairs nicely with their Mesquite Chicken Roll appetizers.","NeroFiddled","0"
