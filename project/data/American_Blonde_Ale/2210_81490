No corn or rice which places it miles above the mass brewed standards. I enjoyed this for what it is: a refreshing crisp American Blonde Ale. Love the low ABV.","loubar","Mar 19, 2015"

The aroma is... bordering on non-existent: a light dusty scent of hops, perhaps some malt, but it's difficult to tell. The flavor is moderately bitter, though hop flavor is lacking, giving away quickly to a little sweet malt, slightly grainy. Body is well-carbonated, light but not watery. This beer is very drinkable, but also inoffensive, and not memorable at all.","allengarvin","Jun 10, 2014"

Well, not exactly completely basic as there are some hops to it (and they're really quite nice), but it's not trying to be anything other than that. Is it any better than an inexpensive American lager??? Probably. Better than a German or Czech pils? Well, that's apples and oranges. I've drank about 4/5th of it. Would I have another? If I was having one, yes, I think so. I wouldn't mind it. Good for warm weather. Any place a pilsner might fit in. Not really worth pairing with food though.","NeroFiddled","Feb 18, 2013"

Nice dark blonde in color with some nice pure white head rentention. Aromas nithing there but some sweet malts as expected... but the flavor was quite full for style... lots of slightly sweet malt backbone no hops, but malt flavors were nice.

And its taste is more of the same. If anything, it tasted like a weak pale ale where the hops weren't worked as much as they could. At least it was easy enough to drink, not terribly offensive, and was bubbly in the mouth. As far as everything else, I'll pass. It's a good thing this is brewed for the local Central Coast market, because I don't think it's necessary to inflict this beer on the people in my area (Orange County).","DoubleJ","Jun 24, 2012"
