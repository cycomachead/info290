"This might be the best tasting 4% abv beer I've ever tasted. I enjoyed it outdoors at 82 degrees and muggy. Walden was perfect in these conditions."
"Verdict: A wonderful session ale, I'm hard pressed to find a more impactful and flavorful example of the style. Refreshing, balanced and quaffable, everything one could ask for. Yet another Hill Farmstead success."

"Pour is a pale hazy yellow with a bubbly white head. Nose is balanced, bready and light dough with fresh grain notes. Hops are soapy and citrusy afterwards. Taste is strongly balanced leaning towards the grain and malt bill. Bread, fresh grain, balanced hop, faint soapy, balanced citrus hop, gentle bitterness. Carbonation is great, body is light and airy with a semi dry finish. Could be a bit brighter but darn this is drinkable and balanced. Wish I had a keg every Saturday to day drink for hours."

"Pours a light golden yellow color with nearly a finger of bright head, great lacing and retention. Smells of light lemony grass, grain, mild sweet malts and dry bitterness. Tastes essentially the same, dry lemony citrus hops, mildly grainy. Mediumish bodied or less, well carbonated, awesome feel. I thought this would be my least favorite in the tasting room, it was my second favorite (behind only S&S4)"
"O~ a lot of sessionable pales have been popping up this summer. which is definitely ok with me. out of what i've had (Song of Spring, Kane Ripple, and Carton Boat) this is probably my favorite. surely the smoothest of the 4 and not overly bitter like Boat gets after a while. the only problem is its not very available haha"

"Classifying this beer an American blonde ale may be a bit ridiculous, but I am definitely not complaining. Walden truly pushes the limits of the style. I cannot remember the last time I had a 4% ABV beer with so much character."

"O-Possibly the best session ale out there. Great balance, not too hoppy but at the same enough to satisfy hop heads."

"O-easy drinking ale, nice summer beer"
"Poured on-tap into a shaker pint, the beer is a cloudy, bright, opaque, lemon-yellow coloring with a filmy, white, sparse head. Nose of lemon grass, pine resin, lemon and tangerine, and a subtle bitterness. Flavors of tangy sweet citrus, lemon-centric, with a grainy undertone. Bitter tail-end. Very light and crisp. The aftertaste is citrus and hoppy, with a semisweet, crisp finish. Extremely drinkable."

"Wishing the flavors matched the nose a bit more, and with all the palate wrecking HFS varieties I've sampled recently, this one falls a bit short, yet not unexpected from the abv and ""sessionability"" angle. Worth trying overall, and an enjoyable blonde ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An extremely delicious session ale. I could drink this all day, and that would be a terrific day because this little beer has a ton of flavor and its extremely delicious. The hop combination creates a wonderful flavor profile. A delicious hop juice."
""
""
"Feels very delicate but brings a ton of hop flavor to the table without a substantial bitterness. A session beer indeed."

"Overall: a tremendous summer beer, that at 4.25abv is one that could be drank all day. It is palate cleansing and refreshing, and though it is different from what I would expect from these two brewers, but the quality is exactly what you'd expect."

"this is perhaps the best session beer on mother earth. it pours a curiously greener tinted hazy dull golden color, not green exactly, but hued on that side of yellow, I have seen this before. my globe was a little overfilled at the farmhouse tap in Burlington, so there wasn't much room for head, but i am certainly not complaining about a generous pour! great nose, a hop variety that is new to my senses here, its fruity and a little tart, like some of the new Zealand strains, but this has some bitter and high alpha simcoe action too, a great blend of hops here in smell and taste. the taste is intensely hoppy, more like an ipa than anything else, but the beer is gone as soon as i taste it, like, the driest finish ever, so dry in fact, that it doesn't have a finish, its more like a dry middle. love the quick hits of hops, lots of punctuation here, staggered but dynamic, splendid really, im totally digging this. i taste just the slightest hint of bretty funk in the finish, not saison yeast, but brett, new, like this might get crazy in a few more months. maybe its me, maybe not, but whatever the yeast is here, its got plenty of character. its like something mikkeller could have come up with, but more refined than that, way more refined. carbonated like champagne, lighter than air, robustly hopped, drinkable as anything, this is basically a perfect specimen, and i envy the Vermont locals who drink this stuff regularly, what a special treat! oh, it also instantaneously stopped an allergic reaction i was having, so there is some magic in the glass as well..."

"This was a semi-hazy, golden yellow beer. Definite wheat malt head, small glass but very fluffy. The body of this beer was very light. I don't know if it was the yeast that was in suspension or the wheat used in the malt but the grassy quality of this beer really surprised me, not citrusy at all but definitely grassy. I was also a bit surprised at the lingering bitterness on the tongue, not sure if it was from hops or perhaps a slightly funky yeast, but it was very good."

"Pours a light, hazed yellow with a dense white head. Leaves plenty of lace and thing ring as the head fades. Crisp bready malt and lemon/citrus hop aroma; nicely balanced. Light bodied, well carbonated with a dry grassy and citrus bitter hop finish. Flavor has a strong bready malt base and tons of lemon and grass, with mild grapefruit juiciness. Amazing for a blonde."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good. Very nice or a blonde ale. Light in body but still has a good hop bite to it. Impressive as always."
"Thanks to yourefragile for sharing the growler. Served in Hill Farmstead stemware. Pours a very pale straw color with a really nice white head and plenty of lacing. Nose has nice lemon and a touch of citrus. Intense. Flavor more subdued. Light grain. Fairly bitter and quite dry. Really drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Palate: Light bodied without ever approaching thin. Creamy, biscuity, with huge citrus flavors. Primarily orange flesh and rind, with lemon and a touch of grapefruit. Clean floral finish with mild bitterness. This is beautifully crafted and highly quaffable. Outstanding."

"O: This is fantastic; it is easy to appreciate in small bursts (makes for great sipping) and can also be consumed in mass quantities. I wish there were local options like this -- it would be an ideal kegerator beer."
""
""

"Medium, medium light in body, fantastically balanced APA. Iâ€™d trade some green beans for it."
""

"Overall: A really flavorful and interesting sessionable version of an IPA. I'm almost done the growler and I can barely feel any effects. It really succeeds in that regard. It is a bit watery in the finish, but I feel that is a byproduct of the powerful hop flavors upfront that just cannot be sustained throughout. Really good and interesting, but I would not say it is my favorite from HF. Perfect for a sessionable hoppy beer though."
"This is AWESOME...all this at 4%...YES, PLEASE! I had this with Life w/o Principle 1 and while that is really good, this is just a bit better with the low ABV really hammering it home. THIS is the definition of a sessionable beer."
""
"The palate opens hoppy, mildly grassy but mostly citrusy. A nice, doughy malt character is present mid-palate. Fruity - citrus, peach, fleshy grapefruit - this is an excellent showcase of hops. Not particularly bitter, this is drying on the finish with a fruity bitterness and a mild grapefruit pith-like bitterness. Very nice stuff, this is extremely sessionable."
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a medium white head. Smell is a really nice citrusy hop with bready malt in the background. Not quite as nice of an aroma as LWP, but still rather impressive. I think it might get a 4.5 if I wasn't comparing the two. Flavor, however, is more impressive than LWP. It's a little bigger and maltier than LWP but with a similar hop profile. It almost comes off like a baby version of Heady Topper. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is another great hoppy beer from HF and one I prefer (slightly) to LWP."
"The beer is light golden yellow with a soft, white head. The aroma is great, offering some citrus and tropical fruits. The flavor brings a light, biscuit, malty character that gracefully balances the beer. Still a hop forward offering, of course. Lingering hop bitterness and tropical citrus on the palate. Delicious. I could drink a lot of this."
"This beer also has a nice golden look though this one is notably hazier than the previous beer (life w/o principle), and has tons of lacing ith a small ring of white head. The smell is great and again reminds me of a hoppy citrus pale ale, with a light honey malt backbone to it. The taste has a big malt backbone with some grassy hop notes and a touch of citrus, lemon grass that reminds me of gumball head though not as aggressive. The feel is nice and light, ok carbonation. Another nice beer."
"Overall somewhat interesting, but not driving me that much for what is offered, but certainly plenty to enjoy."
"O - This one tastes like some of the other HF pale ales, even tho it is a blonde ale. The hops and base blonde work very well together, combining with the low ABV to make this one very easy to consume. This is a really awesome beer."

"Another winner from HF, obv. One of the tastiest, lightest, and wonderful ""Blonde's"" I've had. I would drink this beer so often if it was around me, hard to get tired of it even though it's so light."
""
"O- This was definitely the best blonde ale I've ever had, if you can call it that. Almost more like a citrusy IPA then anything, still finishes with a blonde ale feel. Extremely sessionable and lots of flavor for such a low abv beer. I definitely recommend trying this out if you can, I would drink this every day if I could."

"2L Growler. Pale hazy yellow, decent head that recedes quickly. Aroma of oranges, citrus peel, resinous hops and white flowers. Very aromatic. High lemon tartness blends wonderfully with leafy hops and citruz zest bitterness. Light bodied and dry finish makes it highly drinkable. I really like the actual summer beer trend. It reminds me of DDC Wallonade or TDD Traction ale with Hill Farmstead quality standards. This is a great preamble to the very promising low abv, high citrus series."
"O-Great session beer!!"
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. At times, it is fairly watery but considering it is 4% I can't complain. This is quite a summertime offering that I could throw a growler full back easily by myself without regret. My only real cause for concern here is that in the past 2 months I have now tried 5 different hoppy beers by Hill Farmstead that are new to me. Each and every one of them despite being an IPA, DIPA, Pale ale or hoppy blonde all have a dominating straw character to them that stands out more than I would expect. I guess that's just HF's house character? I recently got to try 2 other brewer's takes on using the Motueka hop and despite knowing that was in this brew it just doesn't come out to me... nor does the amarillo."
""
"D - Absolutely crushable stuff. Could have drank all 750ml easily on my own, or perhaps even an entire 2L growler. Shaun has certainly redefined the blonde ale with this beer."
""
"Beer is light in body, hoppy on the palate but not bitter at the end. It is mildly grainy and the aroma turns out to be the best part. It has a nice feel to it and I would have it again."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and plenty refreshing making this one incredibly drinkable. Overall, as expected, HF and the Alchemist worked their magic with an incredibly tasty session blonde. With so many hit or miss collaborations out there, this one was certainly a hit."
""

"This isn't the hop bomb one might expect from these breweries, but it is certainly hoppy with nice bitterness. I guess for these guys it counts as balanced. Yum!"
"The body is nice and light with good carbonation. Overall this one is pretty amazing. Lots of flavor for a tiny beer."
"M - Light body. Moderate carbonation."
""
"Overall... this is what a blond should be. Not any of that light malts and hint of hops. This is a blend of lots of tropical fruits, lighter malts with a full taste profile and soft feel, and ridiculously drinkable. I could pound the entire 750ml growler in a few minutes if I'm not careful. I don't think you can do a blond better, probably pinnacle of the style!"
"O/D-My two favorite breweries absolutely KILLED this collaboration. Has the flavor of a top-tier DIPA yet it has the feel of a Blonde Ale. This is why craft beer is my biggest hobby. I could drink this and only this every day and be completely satisfied. The perfect mixture of sessionability and hoppiness. If this can stand up to the best DIPAs and IPAs I have tried, it deserves a huge rating."
"O - Overall this is a superb beer once again from Hill Farmstead. The aromas and flavors on this are a home run. I wish more brewers created beers like this, or atleast it wasn't a 5 hour drive to get some HF."
