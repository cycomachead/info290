OCCASION: a ton of yard work done today--time for a reward...APPEARANCE: cloudy, slightly murky yellow-orange body; good effervescence; white, thick, soapy head; sporadic whips of lacing... AROMA: some lemon zest, some dishwasher detergent as well; faint wheat and clove... PALATE: slightly lively; easily drinkable, as the style would suggest; light in body and not fizzy--flat?... TASTE: instantly off-putting funk that doesn't subside with the next sip (wet cardboard?); malt is somewhat abrasive as well; this is NOT what summer tastes like to me... OVERALLL: sadly, a second chance at a first impression, and yet the same result: a bafflingly unsatisfying flavor married to a thirst-quenching body; plenty of other summer ales deliver more taste and harmonious experiences...","dacrza1","Jun 24, 2014"

3.53,8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"unfairly low ratings for this beer here. i admit, a lot of their strong and belgian styles have been lackluster, but this is a pretty good summer ale, certainly a good one to buy a case of in a box state like PA for hot weather mass consumption. pale blonde in color, bubbly, and emitting aromas of orange peel and extremely lightly toasted barley. the flavor is quite simple and straightforward, with a real soft grain front end and then a clean, slightly citrusy balanced finish, crispy clean drinking, supremely refreshing, and with the low abv, its a good summer slammer right from the bottle. i think it probably deserves a little more credit than it has on here, i mean, there are no off flavors, and the feel is great. i guess folks may be looking for a bit more hop character, or even just more robust flavors throughout, but this beer is for the light beer drinker looking to go craft. i think it works, and aside from being awfully light, I've got no real critiques. i like the biscuity front end and the hint of orange zest as it closes out.","StonedTrippin","Jun 15, 2014"

Absolutly not, but it has a very laid back texture and understated drinkability which results in an average beer that can be quite tremendous when enjoyed in the proper setting (ie hot summer day). It's strength lies in it's ability to avoid the pitfalls that too many summer brews fall victim too (ie excessive citrus, overstated flavors, etc.). River Horse tones it down nicely (unlike their liquid cement monstrosity Hop-A-Lot-A-Mus), and make a very solid (albeit not great) summer beer that I might not go out of my way to purchase, but will enjoy if I come across it.","HeroicDoses","May 29, 2010"

3.07,-6.1,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a deeper shade of straw in my glass with very little head despite what i thought was a good pour. Smells of some slight fruit, bready yeast and citrus. Drinking the beer i found it to be very bland yet smooth and satisfying yet at the same time you can def chug this beer. But that is about its best quality. There is a noticable lack of carbonation which i found strange too. All in all a great beer for the warmer weather, but thats about it.","mattpetti","Feb 19, 2006"
3.5,7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a 1/2" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, yet fruity malt scent that boasts of pale and wheat malts as well as a nice lemony zest. It has a slight bisquity aroma. The taste is pretty good. It has a light, pale and wheat malt flavor that goes down smooth and finishes earthy and dry with a slight lemon zest. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking summer ale, but nothing to write home about. It's perfect for those hot afternoons.","WesWes","Jan 28, 2006"

2.86,-12.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Drinkablity would be average. As mentioned before , there was a slight sour and a slight cardboard taste that means I caught this beer at the end of it's life, still, fresh, this would be an average beer with low ABV to drink in the summer while doing stuff in the yard.","Ricochet","0"
2.23,-31.8,3,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Thought I would try this beer as summer's end is knocking on my door. Unfortunately, not a whole lot to this beer. Pours incredibly pale yellow in color. Also, appears slightly tinged green. Slightly hazy. Only a thin and filmy head on top. Nose is amlts, but they come across as corn. In terms of flavor, tis beer reminds me of long nights working my way through too many macros adjuncts. Lots of light malts plus corn and other adjunct flavors, plus the hops are essentially non-existent. Perhaps could make a suitable picnic beer.","MuddyFeet","Aug 24, 2005"
3.1,-5.2,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Thin crisp mouthfeel and an overall pleasant enough character makes this one an easy drinker on a hot day, but it's not my favorite.","whartontallboy","Aug 15, 2005"
3.09,-5.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,4,3.5,"This summer ale pours a bit cloudy with a thin white head. An evident nose of sweet malt was appealing but the brew itself was somewhat thin and mostly sweet, ie, it lacked balance. The body was there, due to the sweetness I presume, but overall would not have me coming back for more. Overall a fair summer ale, which might fit the taste of your average "lite" drinker, but I'll stay away.","farHillsBrewer","Aug 07, 2005"
2.03,-37.9,2.5,2,2,2,2,"Not a very good beer. This was my first River Horse beer, and if all the other beers in this sampler are like this, they won't be in business too much longer. At least date the fucking things!","jakester","Jun 18, 2005"

3.07,-6.1,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Mostly clear gold blond color, just a thin white rim of foam. Nose is the only interesting part of this otherwise boring brew. Sweet, creamy wheat, mixed in with some vanilla. Taste is very sweet. Some light wheat taste, too. Real shallow feel, nothing. Light, off mineral aftertaste.","donnebaby","Nov 08, 2003"
3.08,-5.8,3,2.5,3,3,4,"Pours a very slightly hazy pale straw with a medium sized white head that quickly diminishes and barely laces the glass. Aroma is very light, mostly just a faint graininess.

3.43,4.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"The beer poured a hazy yellow color with a small head that quickly disappated. The aroma was of slight citrus. The malt come through on the tongue with slight bitterness. The bitterness lasted a bit after swallowing. Very dry, and light carbonation. Definitely drinkable since it has a lighter body, but not overly exciting.","Gavage","Aug 26, 2003"
3.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Pours a slightly hazey light golden color with a light head that leaves some light lacing,aroma is definently malty and grainy with some light sweetness.The taste has a nice malty backbone but nothing really gives it some umph.This a solid brew easy to drink quite a few of these not very complex.","oberon","Jun 19, 2003"
3.63,11,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The flavor is smooth and malty, with a spicy, carbonated mouthfeel. Hops take up the rear, providing a mildly bitter herbal finish. A little muddy tasting, but still finish the beer nicely. No dryness, yet crisp. Malts are fairly clean, with a slight pear esteriness. Some nuttiness towards the end, just before the hops slide in. Very slight soapy aftertaste, but all told, this is surprisingly tasty. Not terribly complex, but flavorful and quenching. Very true to the blonde ale style. Summer beers seem to be getting better and better.","UnionMade","Beers"
3.85,17.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A hazy golden body is capped by a creamy head of bright-white foam that holds fairly well before dropping to a creamy collar and some whispy surface foam. Lacing, however, is limited. The nose is intriguing with a soft, wheat-tinged grainy malt that's smoothed by a light touch of buttery diacetyl and backed by a subtle fruitiness. The body is medium and it appears creamy and smooth in the mouth due to a fine, moderate carbonation. The buttery diacetyl found in the nose is a bit stronger in the flavor, yet it actually seems to work for the beer by combining with a grainy maltiness that's gently balanced by mildly spicy hops. There's a malty sweet flavor to it that I associate with the dextrins delivered by cara-pils malt; but it's not overdone and it retains a refreshing quality. It finishes with a lingering note of sweet malt that slowly receeds to reveal some gentle background hop flavor and delicate bitterness. Overall, a very decent summer beer that might not be really refreshing right after mowing the lawn, but has a little bit more malt flavor to it for when you're relaxing after a late evening cookout. Enjoyable!","NeroFiddled","0"
