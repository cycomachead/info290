"I may not be a big fan of this style, but this doesn't even taste like a blonde ale, and unfortunately doesn't taste like a very good beer at all.  Drinkable, but a beer that comes off like a bit of an identity crisis, as it just seems like something that was hastily thrown together with no plan."

"Sweet Baby Jesus is soooo good I guess I had high hopes for the 2nd product I've found from DuClaw. I think it was just an average American Ale priced above some other average American Ales. I am having a hard time hating this because SBJ is so unique and original but I was not impressed enough to even explain my rating. Sorry DuClaw."

"Solid, but unremarkable blonde ale"

"Very good example of the style.  Clean taste of toasted malt, honey, with a hoppy backbone that mixes well.  I will pick this up again."

"Smooth tasting, drank from the bottle. I was pleased with this."

"Draft: Poured a golden color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of clean cereal notes with light sweet notes. Taste is also a well balanced mix of clean cereal notes with light sweet undertones and a crisp dry finish. Body is about average for style with medium carbonation. This is not a style I usually enjoy but I thought the example here was well brewed with a very high drinkability level."

"As usual, I went with a heavy-handed pour and sat back as the pseudo-cascade happened. I was a little surprised last summer when the Old Lady expressed her dismay at my pouring this way, but I like both the visual and the release of esters. This time, I got two foamy fingers of bone-white head that slowly collapsed on itself, leaving decent lacing in its wake. Color was a slightly hazy golden yellow (SRM = 4 - 5). Nose was very malty, but in a biscuit malt, not a sweet malt, way. Bring your Bare Ass closer, honey! Warming, it also began to take on a honey-like sweetness and now it was time for a sip. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the taste was very biscuit-like, making a nice counterpoint to the earlier Blonde. Finish was semi-dry, again more biscuit malty than sweet, and a nice choice on a humid Summer evening."

"O: Overall wasn't to impressed at first, but the pilsner grain backing and semi-dry flowery hops soon grows on you coming more to light and saving this from a mediocre rating."

"I just had Bare Ass Blonde for the first time at a beer festival and really enjoyed it. It has a golden color appropriate for a blonde ale, with a nice creamy white head and a subtle malty sweet smell. Bare Ass Blonde pairs very well with a multitude of foods. This is a good beer to serve to those who are just getting into the craft beer scene. It is only mildly hopped and yet is a full bodied brew."

"Appears honey blonde with a thin white head, forming. Aroma has some vegetal notes normally found in some malt liquor. Wow, I'm still loving it. Cereal grains slight fruit, the flavor is clean drinking beer with higher alcohol a bit of corn/vegetal notes saying we fermented to get the best of you it seems higher abv than your average blonde."

"Overall, a solid blonde ale, color was not as 'blonde' as i'd expect from the style."
""
""

"Not overwhelmingly hoppy, crisp, ale-like lemon or orange finish. Color is a harvest gold and the aroma is a deep bouquet of woodsy lemon. I recommend this to all pale ale lovers as a 'first kiss'. This is a great addition to my stable of micro brews that I offer customers on the lower eastern shore."

"Admittedly, this beer is better than I thought it was going to be with a name like ""bare ass"". Decent grain tone with some seemingly orange fruit tone going on as well. Carbonation is a bit high and full, but just a bit. Easy enough to drink. I wouldn't go back to it, but it turns out being not too shabby."

"The smell is faint of wheat with a hint of lemon. The taste is of sweet malt and s hint of hops. A light hint of lemon hits the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is grest and oversll s good drinking beer"

"clean lighte pale golden in color, some laceing.flavors of wheat. Over all this beer is muted as compared to a jevers.can see light beer lovers enjoying this brew some minor blue cheese flavors here as well.not the most interesting beer that they brew."

"Overall well worth the dollar a paid. It's a very easy drinking blonde ale."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amoubt of carbonation. Overall pretty standard for the style and easy drinking but it is otherwise a forgettable blonde ale."

"O: Decent beer – easy drinker – make a good session beer."

"O- extremely inoffensive, easy to drink beer. Nothing earth-shattering or excellent, but very solid"
"Clear golden-yellow pour, with a thin, white, bubbly head; minimal retention, lacing, and moderately carbonated. Light aroma, toasted grains, grassy hops, no surprises. Taste of biscuity malts, fairly sweet, honey, toasted grains, soft overripe fruits, grass and citrus peel. Light-bodied and easily drinkable, just not my style. (Though for the style, this wasn't bad.)"
""
""
"Single finger head with excellent lacing on a clear deep gold with slight copper hue body. Light aroma with mostly breads and barely, some wheat and slightly bitter. Very wet mouthfeel with lighter side of moderate carbonation and creamy body. Nice semisweet fruity body especially in the finish with wheat and pale malt background"
"D very interesting and unusual for the style, oddly fruity but enjoyable."

"Off-tap this beer was indeed a bright, blonde/gold color with a white head that left thin bands of lacing off the collar. The aroma was faint, mostly a blend of sweet malt and dry grains with a hint of hops. The flavors were similar. I tasted the fresh dry, grainy malt predominantly with some notes of bread coupled with a light hops presence. Though it leaned towards the sweet side of the spectrum the finish was crisp and clean. The body was medium/light, the mouthfeel a little above average and the carbonation effervescent."

"The beer is transparent and golden yellow hued. The aroma is pretty weak, offering hints of sweet malt and light fruit. The flavor is clean, but pretty bland for the most part. A bit of light toast and sweet malt, light grain. Thin bodied, easy to drink. Moderately low carbonation. Overall, drinkable but unexciting."

"Beer is sweet and thin with a mildly grainy bitterness at the back and some moderate hop flavor, earthy and piny throughout, interesting, nice beer for the masses but ultimately not interested."
"Overall not too bad. This beer is very light and refreshing. Should be good for the hot weather coming up."
"Pours a golden color with a white head and not too much lacing. Nose brings some grassy, grain, and slight floral hops. The taste is a mostly grain with some light grassy character. Light body with good carbonation. Drinks pretty well and actually has some flavor."
"Drinkability: The taste is barely there. Definitely a beer to have with a meal, not a stand alone."
"Alcohol Content: 5% abv"
"Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated over a light body. A bit creamy, mild."
"A little out of season for a cold fall day but good just the same. More of a summer session beer. It poured a crystal clear gold. Head dissipated rather quickly. Smell very fruity almost like a wit. Taste was a little sweet and fruity upfront and then very clean at the end. Almost dry at the end. Mouthfeel was great. Very light and crisp. Could have had a number of these if the weather was a little nicer."
"The beer poured a good clear old gold with a good white head. The aroma was of malt and hops but was very light. The taste was of light fruit with just a little hops. The feel was medium and wet making it a nice thirst quencher. This was a nice beer that would do for a session or two."
"A very nice summer beer. Got overpowered a bit by the Cajun chicken sandwich I was eating."
"Drinkability: a simple session beer here. Low alcohol and decent flavors make this a mildly interesting beer."
"Served as a very pale yellow colored beer with modest white head. Smell is very light with some faint notes of summer fruits present. Taste is mainly a light maltiness mixed with some light fruits. Very easy to drink, very refreshing. A good beer for a hot summer afternoon."
"Drinkability: The is a perfect example of a session ale: low in alcohol and long on good taste."
"Alcohol Content: 5% abv"
"Its clear, deep-gold bordering on amber body rests beneath a short lived head of bright white foam that drops to a thin collar and leaves little, if any, lace. The nose is clean and expresses a sweetish, straw-like maltiness with a slight fruitiness and just a suggestion of hops. It's smooth in the mouth with a medium body and a gently crisp and very fine, median carbonation. The flavor displays a grainy malt that's straightforward but clean, and balanced towards sweetness. It's clearly an ale with a nice bit of fruitiness that doesn't go overboard; and it finishes dry with some lingering grainy malt. It offers a good deal of drinkability as it does have some real character to it; and it pairs nicely with their Mesquite Chicken Roll appetizers."
