"Not very good. Honestly I think I would prefer a Coors light. Still like Ska though"

"Decent brew. Can't really review it bcuz I didn't dribknit super fresh. But again another one worth trying."

"Not bad in any way but also doesn't do much for me. I appreciate that it is mostly clean but it just lacks any compelling flavors or use of them."

"This beer might be light on color but not in taste I just had this beer about a week ago and it quickly has become one of my favorites"

"So-so; not unpleasant but not terribly impressive either. Looks quite nice, but the aroma and flavour are bland and understated. A decent body can't rescue it. The honey might be there - an evanescent floweriness lurks in the background, however it's hard to be sure. Drinkable but forgettable. No need to seek it out."

"This beer goes down quite well. Could use a bit more spice, just a bit. Body was light and carbonation seemed a bit down. Still, good summer beer"
""
""
""
"Pours out to a rocky, frothy white head that falls very little. Lacing is moderate. Pale straw-gold color. Aroma is sweet grains, floral hops and a slight butter-creme note. Flavor is mostly pale lager malt and noble hops to balance, with a dry, crisp finish. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is appropriate. This is a very good Blonde Ale."

"I didn't think this was so damn bad. It's just another very light beer but it has a little more style and substance than the average for this category. An enjoyable brewski for the twilight on the patio. From the 12 oz can at the Radisson on the Yavapai reservation."

"O: this is a great blonde, not sure why it is getting reviewed poorly."
""
""
"I actually like the beer, but its not exceptional. Its really balanced and really light, and highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"C-"

"O: decent blonde ale, but subpar. Very sessionable with high ABV, but not my personal choice for a blonde ale- drinks more like an American light lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, but not too impressive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is good enough. Fair body, and nondescript nose. Flavor is a light and crisp doughy thing. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
"Reminds me of a Kolsch, which is a distinct improvement from the smell. Lots of pale malt up front with just enough hop to provide balance. The body of this beer seems off to me; it's way too thin and the carbonation is way to high. This is distracting. Otherwise, I find this to be a flavorful blonde."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing, with very mild carbonation, a very light and almost watery body, and a session-able ease that lets it flow down like water. Micro impersonating macro, this was OK; a great lawn mowing beer."
""
"This is a rather malty brew. The bready flavors are intense. There are some fruity notes that come trhough as well. The lemon is most evident. There are some subtle, grassy hops, but overall, this is a bit unbalanced and ultimately a bit forgettable."
""
"Part of the Ska brewing mixed 12 pack of cans, enjoyed on a nice hot week at the beach. Blonde ales are typically boring styles, but this one does seem to have a bit more body and taste than the usual one. Nice lemony touch, crisp hops, and clean finish, an above average blonde ale but probably wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer has a nice peachy smell and a fairly decent clean, citrusy, bright taste. I am drinking it out of a regular pint glass. It is not the best beer I have ever had but it is a fairly decent session beer with a nice clean taste for a hot day. It is fairly drinkable but I wish it wasn't in a can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, standard fare from Ska. Not great, not awful. Pretty enjoyable when the temp is 103 and you're sitting on the deck, but I've had better. Not regrettable."
""
""
"It's a refreshing Blonde, sure beats BMC for tailgating, parties, ect. Very sessionable. Highly recommended on hot days or for drinking outdoors."
""
""
""
"The taste however, is not as impressive. There is no hop flavor and it is best compared to an adjunt lager with wheat. The beer is drinkable but the flavor wont keep you interested. The feel is light which isnt bad but the aftertaste is poor and rather bland. This is a step up from the big name beers but a small step indeed."

"From a can to a duvel tulip. Beer pours a clear golden yellow with a finger length white head. Aroma is light bread, corn, very faint floral. Not much here. Taste is bready malt, more corn, and lower quality grains. Mouthfeel is thin and forgettable. Not my favorite beer."
""
"Overall - It's a fairly good beer, very sessionable at 5.3%, but not quite substantial enough for my personal tastes. Looks, drinks and nearly tastes like a lite beer, but with some nice flavoe, complexity and balance."
""
""
"a straw yellow clear pour into a pint glass with nice amounts of head and lacing throughout the glass. smells of pils and grassy hops - a hint of citrus. tastes a bit bitter and wheaty. not much else there taste-wise. a nice refreshing mouthfeel though, light bodied and makes your cheeks cringe a tiny bit with the bitterness but is overall a crisp and refreshing summer blonde ale."
""
""
""
"pours a nearly clear yellow with a fading 1.5 inch white head, but i prefer this one ice cold right from the can. smells like a medium bodied wheat beer, some malty textures, but nothing overbearing. hops here serve merely to make it crisp, nothing ornamental with the hops flavor wise. feel is pretty good, bubbly and foamy and drinkable. this is a very light beer in terms of it filling you up, very sessionable on a summery afternoon. definitely nothing special by ska's standards, but it serves it purpose rather effectively."
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent blonde ale with some nice creamy textures and a solid group of flavours. Unlike a lot of American beers there doesn't seem to be the usual identity crisis here - it's just a straight homage (or rip-off) of a classic Belgian pale ale. Not sure how this was classified as an American Blonde (I'm sure that's not a real category...) but it's an enjoyable beer with modest aspirations."
""
"Thanks to Beermasons for this and pours a see through golden blonde hue which leaves a frothy three finger head and clingy lacing,the smell is quite average and has aromas of honeyed malts,herbal hops and some grassiness,the mouthfeel is lightbodied too light for me and the tastes arnt much better very similar to smell with hints of honeyed malts,grassy herbal hops,cereal and bread and overall love the label but thats it for me and wouldnt buy or drink again cheers."
"Pours a golden yellow with a slight white head that quickly drops down. Some honey, some lemon zest, some malt in both flavor and aroma. Very simple. A nice medium body to it. Overall, this is a very easy drinking beer. Not the most memorable but every once in a while it can hit the spot."
""
""
""
"Nothing wrong with this, decent, simple enough to be sessionable, body is big enough to be content with just one. Have bought plenty worse."
""
"Overall Drinkability: A bit disappointing, but still worth the try."
""
""
""
"Merry Christmas!!!!The first beer on this blessed Holiday is a True Blonde from SKA. The beer pours a golden clear with thin white head that is not lacing....due to the fruitiness. The smell has subtle lemon flare with delicate malt balance. The taste is a great balanced beer with good lemon zeal. The mouthfeel is a medium to light body with good carbonation. Overall the beer is quite tasty....and highly recommended."

"Tasted and reviewed on 10/25/11 @ 1930-2000."
"O: Overall it's pretty average, but is quite pleasant to drink and would make a good session beer."
"Overall - not a bad brew, but not very interesting either."
"Overall Impression- Refreshing but wouldn't go out of my way to have again... The main reason I went for this was it was in a can and the other 8 cans I grabbed were all to match up craft beers with other friend's A.B. cans and see what they thought. So far the O'Fallon Wheach is winning! (w/ Ska's Modus Hoperandi in a close 2nd)."
"OVERALL: At 5.3% this is easily sessionable if the sweetness doesn’t build too much. I think I could handle two or three before the sugar got to be too much. That said, I think Ska created a very accessible beer in the Blonde that is palatable for the uninitiated to good beer and the seasoned vets who can still enjoy it even if it is toned down a bit."
"Overall this is just simply boring. But don't rule this out being a light beer to be enjoyed and paired with food. Sampled one while eating pizza and one before bed... it definitely made my pizza into a pretty damn good meal. However, look to something else if you're just looking to drink a beer."
"One and done."
"Overall-Just another blonde ale. Nothing to brad about, but would drink more."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow color with a 1 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Nice rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt and slight honey aromas. The taste is mainly sweet malt with some fruity and honey notes. This beer has good carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good easy drinking blond ale that I am glad I got to try."
"light golden yellow with a nice white frothy head that faded quickly leaving behind a decent, but shortlived lace ring. Smell was lively, lots of yeast was present even in the aroma, and it was very light. Bread and earthy grains were the predominant aromas. Taste was crisp, light and refreshing, perfect for a summer day. Very smooth and full of bready and earthy grain tones, with a slight hop presence as it warmed. Overall this was excellent for exactly what it was"
"If you pour it out into a glass you will be presented with a hazy, golden color and just a slight head. The aroma of yeast, lemons and grains drift from the glass and begin to brighten up your day. The full essence of summer fills your mouth when you take that first sip. Flavors of sweet malts, lemon and a slight hop presence brings a smile to the face. Drinking this beer you can easily knock back a few cans and just enjoy the afternoon."
"Better than the typical can of beer i can have on the golf course, will keep looking for a beer that I can really enjoy out on the course without violating the rules."
"Average blonde ale, really potent honey character but that's all that was really memorable about this beer."
"Overall, a middle of the road blonde ale that I won't remember 15 mins from now. Not that it's bad but just not much there to get excited about. Avail here in TX. Rotation - I Like the other Ska offerings much better so I'll stick to those [N;N]"
"Needs more spice, possibly from hops. All other flavors in accordance with the style."
"Not a bad session beer. Might be better fresher. Nothing aggressive or memorable."
"D - Good for sessions, or multiples. Goes down easy, nothing to complain about."
"D) One is enough for me. Maybe in a pinch I'd drink another one."
"Drinkability - Different enough to keep me interested, but not too weird where it's more like a one-time experiment. I'd have a couple of these in a night and might pick up another one. But I am not infatuated."
"3.5/3.5"
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a white head. Head is foamy and hangs around for a while eventually leaving some thick lacing. Not much going on in the nose, mostly grains and a hint of citrus. Taste is again very grainy but with more lemon than was present in the nose, not much else going on. Lighter bodied with a crisp finish. Not the best beer I've ever had but I do have to say I could easily throw a few of these back. To summarize: a decent beer but nothing to really write home about."
"I guess if you like grainy brews this one is for you. Also, nice art on the can, very cool."
"D: A nice beer. Not overly sweet like some beers brewed with honey flavors. But it is still on the sweet side, so not too sessionable."
"D - Nice beer to sit down and drink. The mouthfeel really makes the beer one that i would drinkt more than one of."
"Pours a golden blond color with a small fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of grains bread honey and grass with a hint of herbal hops. Smells sweet and grainy for the most part. Taste is sweet with lots of honey in the taste mixed with a bit of grainy malt and almost enough hops to keep this from being a bit sweet. Medium body, crisp carbonation, sweet sticky mouthfeel. Not a bad little drinker. Smooth sweet and tasty. Its a decent brew, nothing really wrong with it, but nothing exceptional either."
"Average in drink. Not much about it makes me want to go rushing out for a sixer. It's ok tho."
"Ok, beer best before 2/13/2011 on the bottom of the can. Pours out a bright golden color with a frothy head, wonder if there are some wheat malts in there. Nice frothiness and lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is very clean, more like a lager than an ale. The taste is quite crisp, dry and bitter, with a clean herbal bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Another good beer from Ska, last I had was their winter Euphoria, this I guess is their summer style beer, for all year round it appears. I actually really like the can format, it goes into a glass anyway and it takes up less space in the trashcan. Anyway, I found this to be a tasty, highly drinkable ale with a nice clean aftertaste almost like a lager. Would pair well with a lot of great summer food on a hot day."
"Goddamn dye-jobs... Huh, wha? Oh, yeah, the review. Ahem. This chick pours a clear sorta-pale golden straw topped by about a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, flowers, orange rind, and light honey. The taste is nearly identical, though the orange rind and flowers dominate the proceedings, all filibustery and whatnot (wouldn't that have been a better political-charged thriller? Winnie the Pooh and the Filibustery Day? Yeah, I went there...). The one-sidedness really hurts things. The body is a heavy-feeling light, with a moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a decent brew, nothing worth raving or ranting about. I'm not sure I'd aim for another one any time soon."
"D - decent beer...nothing flashy or bold, but it got the job done of providing something to wash my dinner down with. Not bad, but there is a reason this sat in my fridge for a while. I've had better American blonde ales for sure. Worth a shot and would be a good choice while consuming lots of beer."
"drinkability: good - tailgate/lawnmower beer"
"Drinks easy, but not interesting enough for me to want to session on..."
"Poured a clear pale yellow with a inch and a half white head with minimal lacing. Aromas of biscuits and barley malts, much reminisant of a Budweiser. Thou lighter in carbonation than the fore mentioned it had more of a lager taste and pretty much the same disappointment. Save your money and have a bud."
"This isn't going to blow anyone away, but it's probably the best example of a non-boring American blonde I can think of. Definitely on par with the examples from Brick and Montgomery in the deep south."
"Overall, this one just reminded me too much of an adjunct lager. There really wasn't a lot of flavor. Should one expect a lot of flavor? No, but some would be nice."
"It's good."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mainly of hops. Taste is of malts and hops, well balanced, a touch of citrus. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Fairly drinkable but not a bold amount of flavor or things to pick out in the nose. However, I can't fault this brew considering I am not that familiar with the American Style Blonde Ale. My impression of this brew is that with it's easy drinkability and lack of big flavor, it would be a likely substitute for a lawnmower beer."
"The body is fairly full for this style. Slightly chewy and has a bit of depth on the back end. Carbonation level is low-to-moderate. Nice clean flavors make this up. The honey comes through a bit in the flavor as there is a mild sweetness present. Bitterness is low on this, but that is expected. Slight grassy notes on the aftertaste. This was pretty good. Every once in awhile, I could go for this style. This is a good representation. Check it out."
"D: A pretty good beer in a style that doesn't all too often interest the beer geek. Kind of kolsch with a kiss of mead, definitely worth a try."
"drinkability is good even with the so so mouthfeel"
"12 ounce bottle. Perhaps not surprisingly, pours a bright blonde color with minimal head. Aroma is all cereal malt with some faint grassy hops off in the background. Clear light malted flavor comes through with some light hopping adding to a bittersweet finish. Light mouthfeel with mild carbonation. Most assuredly a beer that comes in on the light end of the spectrum. This isn't a beer that will come out and wow you by any stretch of the imagination. It's a simple, straight forward beer meant to be enjoyed on hot summer days. Pretty not bad."
"D: Could drink this all night - low ABV - good flavor."
"A nice little ale that is available in cans. A winner right there. Pours a bright golden color with one inch of white head that slowly settled to a half-inch and hung in there to the bottom of the glass. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Clean aroma of bready malt and cereal grains. Not much else to expand on in the aroma. Pleasant taste of light malt and some hops giving notes of melon and grass. Just slightly sweet. Finishes clean. Light body with good carbonation that keeps things lively without being prickly. Really nice for a lighter tasting beer. A refreshing beer that hit the spot on a hot evening. No problem finishing off several of these in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Solid enough and great for a hot summer night -- nothing special about it, but it'd definitely sessionable with its light weight and low ABV."
"I was glad to find this beer in a can. The taste is really smooth and tasty. Golden color with just enough of a hop to give it a great flavor. It's just a good smooth drinking summer time beer. If you ate looking for a great beer for a night bye the grill with friends this is a good choice"
"D - Interesting to try and decent tasting, but I think 1 will last me for the rest of my life, kinda of an odd beer but not awful."
"P - White fish, toss into a beer batter for some onion rings, or a cheese sauce for pretzels, Sesame or leeks seem good as well."
"D: In a can bonus, but a very lighter blonde in regards to taste and aroma. A good drinkable and light bodied beer."
"Would I buy more of it? - I hear they do a mixed pack of Ska cans and that would definitely be a worthy investment for any weekend of outdoor activities. This one would be the perfect beer to start with before going on to the others."
"M & D - Nice crisp and light bodied. Very refreshing and a good summer beer."
"D: decent blonde and would be a great summer brew to enjoy in the hot socal heat."
"overall: I enjoyed this beer a simple beer with no rice or corn and you can taste the difference. well crafted brew with good malted barley touch of hops and a nice sweet taste."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this beer seems to fit the ""Lawnmower Beer"" role well even if there are some beers out there that fit the role better."
"D: Not well blended, not a very good representation of the style, the soapy nature is overpowering - not of true soap but of the overpowering floral nature. I'd pass on this one in the future."
"I look foward toi try the True Blonde Dubbel I saw on the shelf..."
"= taste is mildly interesting, and i would drink one if offered"
"one of my favorite beers. has a very good taste. poors nice from bottle to tall glass. very nice taste but needs to be your style of beer. not strong but flavorful. light fruit aroma, looses bite quick so drink when first opened. i can easily drink a 6 pack."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is thin but does leave a pleasant aftertaste. Overall this is a very drinkable beer, which could easily be sessioned."
"Light yellow, golden in coloer. Very pretty to look at. Smells a little of faint lemons. Head was thin, gone quickly. Crisp, cool, refreshing. Subtle hints of citrus. Slight after taste, though this would be good on a summer day at the beach. Not really my style."
"Pours cloudy yet incredible pale golden color with a shallow wispy white head that's gone in a flash, leaving spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is timid yet balanced between a sweet grainy malt and bright lemon hop. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is bright and tangy yet finishes smooth as the sweet flavor takes over and cleans up fairly quickly. The flavor is bright sweet refreshing lemon. While I'm not a big fan of this style, I found that this one was easy to consider."
"D: drinkable, though not very complex. Hops are only detected with a subtle hint on the nose and a sticky film on the lips, though I believe that is to style. It's a cold night in Chicago- this beer is more suited for a hot summer afternoon when you want something refreshing with some taste but not too heavy."
"Initially this beer came off sweet and light, then dries out throughout the finish with citrusy notes, nothing off-putting, just sweet and dry. Overall this is a very drinkable beer, but nothing stands out, I would pick some up and don't regret bringing this home in my suitcase."
"Drinkability: This is a chugger. Very drinkable beer."
"This is an easy drinker with average abv that is barely noticed."
"Pours a clear yellow with a thin white head. Nose has grassy hops and some pale malts. Taste is has subtle fruity hops and grainy malts. Light body is a bit thin and over carbonated. Could use a bit more hops, but a decent blonde ale from Ska. Comes in cans too!"
"Easy to drink."
"D- One of the cleanest ales I've had to date."
"Overall a well balenced wheat beer."
"Clear golden yellow with a short but dense head. The smell is quite average, maybe a bit of wheat or is it malt. I don;t know because the beer practically has no aroma other than a beery smell. The taste is an average blonde ale, nothing hoppy about it, the malts are unremarkable, boring. The only thing this beer has going for it is that it is relatively light and easy to drink."
"D - This is a great session beer that I could have a few of."
"D - This is a pretty nice blonde ale. It's great to find a sessionable ale in a can."
"Two fingers of bone-white head with good retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a sugary sweetness to it that reminded me of a lager. Mouthfeel was medium with a candy-like sweetness. Finish was likewise sweet. Much too sweet for my taste."
"Drinkability= Kinda high if you liked this beer. I however did not. Not much to this beer. I would drink this over BMC anyday, but would pass on it for something with more flavor. Just not my style I guess."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice two finger white head, with some very nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some slight yeast notes, and some spice. The taste is sweet, malty, slightly yeasty, with a spice note. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad little brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Pours a bright yellow with a fluffy white head. The bottles artwork is pretty neat as well. Says it's brewed with honey but I can't really smell or taste anything to indicate that. Not surprising seeing as how you have to really dump in honey to change the final beer. Tastes light and clean. Mainly of pale malt. Slight hop bittering and some noble hop-like flavors. Not bad but not really exciting. There are tastier (and cheaper) blonde ales out there."
"Pours brilliant golden with lacey white head. Nose has a light herbal hop quality, with cereal/grain and bready aromas. Palate is rather uninteresting with a light malt, more cereal flavors, and light hops to balance. Easy drinking, but only because it lacks much to savor."
"D - Overall, a very nice tasting blonde. I was a bit put off by the aroma and appearance, but the taste saved this beer. Very light and refreshing. My first beer from Ska brewing so I'm curious to see what else they do."
"D: Easy drinking beer. This is a pretty mellow beer and an easy drinking one to boot. I probably won't be seeking this out again, but it is something I would recommend to cross over drinkers."
"D: This is a nice and unassuming blond. This isn't my favorite style, but this beer does its job as a summer refresher."
"Kudos to Ska Brewing!"
"Should be successful in a can."
"D) A fine beer, just lost in the sea of Blonde/lighter ales and lagers. Probably best local and fresh."
"Color was a light golden color with a big thick white head that stuck around for awhile. Aroma was light grassy hops with very little else. Flavor was light slightly grainy malt with a grassy hop flavor and a fair amount of bitterness for a blond ale. Mouthfeel is light crisp and refreshing."
"Hops are pretty noticeable in this beer, a mix of floral flavors and grassy bitterness. That could be because the malt bill seems pretty tame. Not a whole lot going on besides some grainy, husky sweetness. Taste is pretty average for the style...light, crisp and refreshing. A nice no-nonsense summertime quencher."
"D: Drinkable, but I will not be seeking out this beer again."
"If you're looking for a beer that goes down easily and doesn't give you a fight, this one would be worth trying."
"D: A very nice surprise as most blondes don't offer a whole of anything interesting. While Ska Blonde is not the most original brew, it's done well and quite enjoyable."
"Decent thirst quencher, easy to drink."
"not a good one...5/3/4/2/8/2.2"
"D: Very easy to drink - smooth, crips and clean."
"D- Overall a good session beer. This was served at a pre-wedding party and provided a nice introduction to a broad cross section of beer drinkers."
"Bought this one at the Liquor Barn in southside Santa Fe. Out of the bottle this one poured a true gold color but the white head was very short lived and left on wispy lacing. Great clarity though. The aroma was light, slightly sweet and grainy. The flavors were at first a bit of honey sweetness with some grassy undertones and floral hops. As it finished biscuity malts appeared. Good mouthfeel and light to medium bodied. Not much to think about but a good session beer and easy drinking."
"D: Again, quite decent for an everyday watching sports, or grilling beer. I plan to buy more of this."
"A nice little drinker of a Blonde. Wholesome, bready, tender, sweet, and fulfilling for what it is."
"I'm really surprised at how much I enjoyed this one. I was expecting another run of the mill Blonde Ale, but this one takes the basics of the style, amps them up a touch and just makes everything work. Give it a shot...you might be surprised."
"Drinkability - This is not bad, but I certainly would want something else after one or two of these, and I don't think I'd ever have it very often in the first place."
"Easy drinking, well balanced, my only complaint on this one was that it seemed a bit one dimensional."
"A solid beer in every regard, very refreshing."
"this is one to gret your friends started on micro breweries."
"Overall quite drinkable. No complaints. Definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability: pure lawn mower beer here. Light and easy to consume, many of these could be thrown back. Decent but not overwhelming flavor brings the higher score here."
"The Ska brewing company should have spent more time on their brewing recipes and techniques than it did on the cool ""punk rock"" appealing bottle labels."
"I had this at Kuma's Corner in Chicago, and I thought it to be pretty good, especially for a style I usually associate with disappointment. This beer poured a slightly hazy golden color, with a towering pile of head. Aroma is very light, with some small amount of fruitiness. What I didn't get was a lot of cereal-ness, which I usually associate with beers of this style (that's a bad thing). Flavor was extremely light and pleasant. A bit of fruitiness and a touch of maltiness; pretty good. Mouthfeel was very light and clean."
"Bottom line: A pretty tasty blonde ale but I doubt I'd put it on my regular rotation if it was available locally."
"Drinkability? This is SESSION beer. Not something you are going to sit around and savor at all while drinking. But if you needed something to take to a party, especially one with non craft beer drinkers, this would fit the bill pretty well."
"What you have here is a Pilsner Wolf in a lambs skin. If you like strong Pilsner beers then you will love this stuff. This is very strongly hopped with Nobel hops and your liking of them will pretty much determine how well you will like this."
"D- very easy to drink, but wouldnt bother me if i didnt have another. Fits the style, that earns this brew some points."
"Not a bad beer, just another average attempt at a pretty average style."
"Flavors are balanced, but mild. Sweetness becomes cloying after awhile. Hop bite gets stronger as it warms. Fortunately there is a nice hop bitterness, providing a 'beer' taste. I wouldn't seek this out, but it puts me in mind of a decent lager."
"Drinkability: Another quite quaffable beer from the rude brewers of Colorado! So far I am rather pleased with my Ska Brewing variety pack."
"12oz brown bottle with bottled on date of July of 2005 (uh oh). Pours a very slightly hazy golden blond with a good 2 finger head and nice lacing. slight citrus and malt aromas mixed with a bit of honey. Slight hop aroma as well. Nice honey malt flavor up front with a decent hop presence in th middle and a malt/bitterness in the finish. I would love to try this when it is frsh especiall on tap. Not a bad beer, but it does have a ring of oldness to it. For a blond ale its OK."
"Body is just above light, with an expansive, forced-carbonation feel and grainy texture. They say gentlemen prefer blondes. I sir, am not a gentleman."
"Verdict: Indistinct and burdened by off-flavors. I probably won't drink it again."
"Pours pale clear golden color with a foamy white head that leaves a nice lacing in my glass . Light bready aroma, mild flavors of bread and grains, light bodied with a thin yet crisp mouthfeel, good carbonation, it does have a clean finish, not much flavor but a decent session beer."
"Overall impression: Not a bad beer, but certainly not an exciting one either ..."
"Drinkability is ok. It's enjoyable if nothing else."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with label notched two-months before tasting. Clear pale golden, head is frothy white, one finger, dissipating rather quickly. It does end up leaving a persistant, sticky lace. Nose was malty, grassy,sweet, made me want to jump right in and taste it. Taste was malt balaned with hops in the beginning, but a bit bitter on the finish. Light to moderate carbonation, crisp mouthfeel. Dry finish, easy to drink."
"The after its escape from the 12-ounce brown bottle resides in the Nonick glass a cloudless amber color with the head upon the pour moderate in size, semi creamy in texture and the color a winsome light tan, the resultant lace a fine coating surrounding the glass. Nose has a pleasant malt sweetness, a touch of fresh plowed dirt, fresh and pleasant to the senses, start has a mild sweetness, the malt decent and the top light to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is pleasantly carbonated the hops adequate for the style and the aftertaste droughty, a nice drinking beer that lies easy on the palate."
"This is a pretty nice Blonde Ale. Between the good balance, the residual sugars and the Saaz hop flavor and bitterness, it makes it enjoyable to drink. My favorite offering from the brewery so far. I bet it tastes quite nice fresh on tap."
"Light Golden in color with a big fluffy off white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is light grainy with grassy like hop aromas smells like a pilsner. Taste is light slightly grainy malt with a grassy hop flavor and very light bitterness. Might be an ale but reminds me of a decent pilsner. Mouthfeel is light crisp and refreshing would make a great lawn mower beer to bad its winter. Drinkability is ok but light ales aren't my cup of tea so to speak if there yours give it a shot, if your like me don't bother."
"12 ounce bottle. Kinda boring."
"I wanted something easy to drink while watching the Pistons game tonight so I picked this,pours a clear light golden color with a soapy looking light head.Aromas of toasted grain and some honey thrown in not to bad,taste is toasted up front with a lightly sweet/honey finish.This beer served its need good with some chilly dogs.Not a award winner by any means but a quaffer and better alternative to a macro lager for sure."
"Poured a light clear golden color, with a small head with big bubbles that mostly dissipated quickly. Has a honey aroma with floral hints. The initial taste was of honey with some citrous on the side. I normally expect a blonde ale to be pretty bland, but this had more flavor than most."
"Light pale yellow color. Fizzy beer color, only a bit more shiny. Thin small white head. Grainy sour beer smell. Taste is very grainy, wet grass, and pasta. Only a subtle wiff of honey, and that seemed more sour, than sweet. Old beer taste, like stale beer from your dad's stash in 10th grade taste. Still tastes like beer though, and that's good. Honey taste is nearly lost on me. Comes and goes. Light bodied, highly charged. Easy enough going down, not much lingers. A decent beer, nowhere near the level of their ten pin porter. Worth a try, but don't lose any sleep if you haven't had it yet."
"Thanks to Arctic Liquors for the sample."
