"Super drinkable.  Nice subtle bitterness I wasn't expecting."
""
"Overall: A satisfying beer but goes slightly wrong for me somewhere, probably in that slight bitterness unbalance I picked up.  I don't think the carb helped that so much later on in the beer but a decent bottle nonetheless."

"A crackery malt profile makes this beer slightly different from a classic American pale ale, which this very much tastes like (SN Pale Ale, Bear Republic Grand Am)."

"Overall, this is a flavorful beer and the 2014 edition is only 5.0 ABV. It tasted stronger than that which I enjoyed."

"The blonde ales I've had before have been pretty boring and monotone, but that wasn't the case with Knockout Blonde. Sean Lawson has a knack for interpreting styles with a certain verve, and panache. I wish I was able to get more of these as I enjoyed it more than I expected."

"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF 7. It pours a mildly hazy goldenrod topped by a finger-and-a-half of cream-white foam. The nose comprises light orange zest, mild brett-like funk, light wheat, and a smidgen of bold banana. A strong whiff of lemon zest wafts up as the beer warms. The taste holds notes of waxy lemon rind, light brett-ish funk, dirt, and a vague but sharp bitterness that pervades the finish and malingers a bit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, I found the odd bitterness to be too much to overcome here, especially considering the style. Not my cup o' tea."

"Poured from bottle purchased at the coop. Pours a nice clear golden with thick foamy head. Really great hop aromas, citrus and pine. Taste is a bit blah...it has very little personality and is super dry. Well...blonde ales in general are usually pretty lacking in flavor and personality, so I guess when compared to most blonde ales, this has way more to offer...including abv. Nice brew and somewhat superior blonde, but when it comes to overall drinking experience, Lawson makes better brews than this."

"O-an interesting blonde ale, easy drinking"

"Overall, a excellent easy drinking hop-forward beer. Nothing really blonde about it, just doesn't quite have the heft to make it a pale ale I guess."
"Overall - The best session beer I've ever had, probably? I just had two Hill Farmstead blondes the other night and I'm fooling myself into thinking that blondes are all like this. Only in ABV is this a blonde. It's really like a super hoppy pale ale/ Really nice."

"Enjoyed on tap at the Black Back Club. A tasty blonde, funk in the taste, a funky dirty blonde. Nice hops, piney and a little citrus. A sipper. Lace sheet.Complex and something I would have on a regular basis, as it would yield different flavour profile each time"

"O- This was an interesting blonde ale. I'm usually not a huge fan of blonde ales, but this one wasn't bad although definitely not my favorite Lawson's offering. I recommend trying it if you like blonde ales, but definitely not a must have."
"O - Not what I expected from the label, which listed cascade and centennial hops but I go no aroma or flavour from them. Perhaps they were used just for bittering. This beer was true to the style."
"Overall pretty good. Mostly drinkable except the big bitter spicy earthy hop finish, and slight oily taste. Big hop character for a blond, but nice malts. The hops go a little overboard, but still tasty."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"O - Overall this is a fairly solid blonde from the boys at Lawson's Finest. That said, theres better blonde offerings out there in my opinion."
""
"O/D-I love extravagantly hopped interpretations of generally non-abrasive beer styles. This is a vixen in a bottle. She has her ass-kicker boots on too. Very tasty but very easy drinking. Memorable. Surprised to see this clock in at over 6% ABV; feels like a 5%er."
""
"Light golden orange with a dense, white head with no real retention or lacing. The nose is enjoyable with a grainy, bready malt character upon with a citrusy and fruity hop aroma is layered. Clean and nice, this is quite refreshing. The palate opens lightly bready, a little watery and with a moderate hop flavor with citrus, honey and toast. Mildly bitter, this beer is bready and grainy on the finish, clean, a little grassy and moderately hoppy. Thoroughly enjoyable. The alcohol is well-hidden, but I think this batch was labeled 5.1 % or so."
"Excellent representation of the style. Split one with my girlfriend With the first sip it is s weet, then the hops come on, with a smooth, non-lingering finish. Very enjoyable. Could drink a few of these quite easily! Best ""blonde ale"" I've ever had!"
""
"Beer is medium to light in body, wet finish, no after taste, a moderate bitterness on the back end, a very enjoyable beer. I'd definitely have it again."

"On draft at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT. Served in a Lawson's Finest Liquids snifter. Classy. The beer appears crystal clear and light orange hued with an inch of foamy white head. The aroma is mild, offering a touch of hops, bready malts. The flavor brings notes of citrus, followed by sourdough bread and a bitter hop finish. Light bodied and flavorful. A solid example of the style."
""
"Medium-light bodied, medium carbonation, crisp and dry. A good beer but not the apex of the Lawson’s portfolio."
"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one at a recent tasting! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, fruit, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. While this was fairly nice for the style, nothing on it really stood out from anything else I’ve had. I really wish it would have been a little more complex here if I am completely honest. The earthy characters going on here were definitely the dominate aspect going on. Worth trying if you get the chance, but personally I wouldn’t go out of my way to do so."

"A very nice, tasty blonde."
"Nice representation of the style."
"The feel is smooth and goes down easy. This has a good medium body and was just about right for the hot day I am drinking this on"
""
"Knockout Blonde pours a light bodied, bright honey gold in color with a one finger bright white head. It looks great. The nose is pretty bland and average for the style, just pale malts and honey. The flavors are somewhat dry and bitter. It features pale malt, an ever so slight touch of honey, and a prominent bitterness perhaps from the hops. That said, it certainly isn't hoppy. It drinks light and dry and is really a pretty mellow beer. I wouldn't necessarily buy this if I saw it but it wouldn't be a bad beer to open after a hot day ate pool or in the yard."

"From the 22 ounce bottle that was part of the 2012 batch. Sampled on June 2, 2012. The pour is a slightly cloudy straw-pale yellow with a fizzy, foamy white head that settles down eventually. The aroma is full of earthy, piney hops with a little zesty citrus, grainy malts, and some yeast. The body is in the medium range but kind of acidic. The taste begins grainy with a moderate to bold bitter hop note on the end. But with each taste the hop flavor warms and grows. An enjoyable beer."
""
"The Knockout Blonde is a nurturing ale. Living up to its vivacious name, it is a fine beer to look at in the glass and its scent is attractive and fetching. Imagine the light, airy, yeasty aroma of bread in a hearth coasting through the air on a summer's day. Take that bright, light malty tone and imagine the staccato notes of grapefruit and pine from a lingering hop presence. The taste is exactly like the scent. It is a perfect summer beer to me. The mouthfeel is spectacular. It leaves a pleasant thickness at the back of the mouth and finishes a bit dry with the hops. This is a spectacular ale and another wonderful accomplishment by Lawson's."

" Aroma was light, but nice and complex with light hops, Light notes of peach and light grain really come through right now. Warming brought a smidge of citrus to it, and really let the light fruit notes pop,. Crisp, clean flavor though with light hints of clove and heather that sat on top of a base that resembled mostly light fruits and hints of grain. Smooth, light body was not overly carbonated but rather a bit silky and left just the right amount of dryness on the tongue"
"It's hard to imagine that blondes and cream ales were created by the microbrew movement as an alternative to light and pale lagers. This beer is a huge departure from these beer in the taste department. Knockout is BMC pale with a nice sticky head. Crisp hops and slightly sweet malt decorate the nose. The beer is super bitter with a nice crisp mouthfeel and a dry finish. Very good, I wish this were easier to get here in Philly because this would be a great BBQ beer."
"O: Definitely a different take on the blonde ale, and certainly for the better."
"Overall: Good beer that could easily be lost in the sea of IPAs and double IPAs."
"As a blond ale, this one is fantastic. To be fair, it's really hopped up for the style, but it still doesn't feel out of balance and I could drink this all night long. Possibly the best blond ale I've ever had."
"Pours light a light translucent orange. The keyword there is translucent, light passes through but there isn't really any clarity to speak of. Mostly hop bitterness on the nose, nothing terribly exciting here. First thing I detect is a bready flavor, but the hops come through at the finish. Ultimately there doesn't seem to be too much going on with this beer, but that's fine as nothing about it offends the palate. Really, I feel like I could keep drinking it all night... too bad I've only got one."
"Medium thick body, sharply carbonated with a grainy and citric hop finish. Flavor has a strong biscuit and bready malt body with a smooth, though not particularly bitter, green hop taste. More of an APA than a Blonde, the hops though well balanced by the malt body are still potent and aggressive. A solid all around offering, but not quite as exciting as Double Sunshine is."
"Taste is awesome, generally I find blonde ales to be pretty 'meh' but this is very well done, the C hops really give this something to work with, it's bitter and sweet while still being very easy drinking and smooth. The mouthfeel is spot on, a bit thick with light carbonation, theres a bitter finish that rounds it out well."
"Will look to score it again when available."
"D: My third beer by this brewery and I continue to be impressed. This has got to be one of the easiest drinking beers of all time. Thanks again Michael. Please keep the Lawson's beers coming!"
"A big thanks to jedwards for breaking this out. Bottle #98 out of #168. Pours a beautiful orange-gold with a semi-hazy clarity; no head on this one. Nose is light and citrusy on a pale malt backbone. Taste follows nose with a pleasant piny/citrusy hops character in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation. Not a big complex beer, but perhaps the best example of the style I've had the opportunity to try to date. Easy drinking and quite flavorful; I would drink this all the time if it were more readily available."
"The beer is light bodied, well carbonated and has a nice bitter, dry finish. The 6% abv is well incorporated into the flavors, this one is very drinkable, I was I had more than one bottle."
"Pours a golden color with a hint of peach. There is a one-finger white head with some spotty lacing. The nose brings some grains and quite a bit of fresh hops. There is a bit of light Amarillo-like hops. Fresh and a bit of green hops. There are also some light pine and floral notes. Definite fresh hop flavor with some floral and herbal notes. Light to medium body and quite drinkable."
"Slightly darker than your typical blonde ale. The hop character does not jump out in the smell, but is definitely present when you take a drink. I typically expect (and love!) lots of hops in the Lawson's beer but this one is more mellow. Overall a nice take on a blonde ale, very refreshing beer with a nice balanced hop/malt profile to it. Would love to have a stock of these available during the summer months."
"Wow. This certainly is a knockout for the style. At 6.1%, it's the big sister to Papelblonde. I can't really think of much else that could top this style-wise. Kudos to Sean for yet another excellent style interpretation!"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. A pretty nice blonde ale, very drinkable and refreshing with some nice character. Thanks Alex!"
"drinkability is good. nice balance. big malt and hop profile. good stuff."
"D - This is a superb session beer - I'd love to have it again some time."
"Another solid offering from Lawsons!"
"Big citrus notes with good balancing malt character. Golden straw color with off white head. If I could get this in a six pack it would always be in my fridge. Not sure if this really should be called a blonde but regardless I its too good to not get high marks. More to come from notes laters."
"Pours a hazy gold color with a one finger white head with good retention leaving patchy lacing. Aromas of lemon, biscuity malt and wheat. Light malty flavors with noble hop flavors with a lemony bite to it. High carbonation, light body there is a clean crisp mouthfeel with an extra dry finish."
