"Light, crisp and refreshing.  Could crush this all day.  Not huge in the flavor department, but on a hot day or while playing golf, it would do the trick."

"Mouthfeel: Light bodied and very lightly carbonated. A drying mouthfeel from the lemon hop acidity is really the only thing to mention as none of the flavors or even the weight of the beer doesn't last long."

"When summer comes, cases of Golden Ale are the way to go. Great year round but perfect in the summer. When I have friends looking to start drinking beer this is often one of the brews I suggest to start with. Light malt, light hops, great refreshing taste. Wonderful"

"O - Good work from Mayflower here. I know this is a year-rounder, but I think the brewery would be better served putting this guy in 12-packs and marketing it for a summer release."

"Overall: Exactly what I would expect from a golden ale. I typically like a more robust beer, but sometimes I want something light and crisp. This is what I'm looking for at those times. This would be perfect on a warm summer day after mowing the lawn or just hanging out on the porch with friends."

"It was however very clean and crisp. From that point of view, I think it is a good summer beer and still above the large beer companies light ales"
""
""
""
""
""
"O) A decent brew. A good alternative to other light beer options. I'd have another, although preferably in the heat of the summer."
""
""

"The taste really reminds me of a German Pilsener with a slight hop bite with low bitterness lingering at the end. Easy to drink but nothing out of the ordinary. Still, a good one to have on a hot day."
"Easy-drinking American Blonde Ale that is fairly straightforward overall."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is nice- very light body, moderate to full carbonation. This is a very well-crafted, very light, low ABV summer beer. That's all that I would recommend it for but it is summer now so enjoy."

"O/D-I generally enjoy Mayflower’s brews (their Spring Hop is one of my favorite local beers of all time). This is a pleasant little brew that has enough kick to keep me interested. Perfect for warm days like today. A nice little brew, won’t light your pants on fire, but tasty is the bottom-line here."
"Very light golden color. Fast fading head, and lots of bubbles rising through the beer. Crisp, clean aroma. Lightly floral and spicy. Basically, smells like ""beer"". Tastes like beer too. Drinkable, unremarkable, unmemorable. Maybe would have been a better choice on a hot, sunny afternoon."
""
"This beer when poured has a golden color body with a nice fizzy white head. The smell has a nice grain smell to it. The taste is very well balanced with hops and malt. Has a little bit of a minty taste on the back of the tongue. It has a nice and smooth mouth feel and is a easy drinker."
"Had this beer at the brewery during a brewery tour. Pours a nice white head and a very clear golden body. Smells sweet and somewhat metallic. Nice sweet malt flavor. Very light and spritzy mouthfeel. Very drinkable, not my favorite style but a very good representation of it. I would certainly go for this if I want something mid winter as a break from the heavy stuff."

"It would be evident if there were something amiss here, and there isn't. This is a really good beer for a day at the bar, a tailgate, or at home. Really refreshing and tasty."
"O: For what it is its good so I should probably rate it higher, hard to get too excited though, honestly for the calories I'd probably rather have a light beer."

"Overall: I generally wouldn't get very excited about a Golden Ale but this brewery just doesn't disappoint; about as good as it gets for the style"
"Thanks Dr.Jay."
"It's a tad bit overly dry, but true to the style, so can't fault it there. Nice session brew!"
"D: Drinks very well. Low ABV makes this one sessionable. I could easily drink a few of these."
"the CpJ"
"D: A good blonde ale. It's always nice when a ho-hum style impresses. On the plus side, the ale has moderate alcohol as well."
"Style-wise, Mayflower amped it up enough to bring it from potentially mundane to a killer session ale."
"This is my favorite anytime beer. Great for BBQs and parties. I love that I can share it with the BMC crowd and not be called a wuss."
"D. A good BBQ beer."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, pale malt scent wit low hops and a clean finish; not much else to say. The taste is good. It has a crisp and somewhat grainy pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes clean with little hop character. I definitely not a complex beer, but it's a damn drinkable one with no flaws. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a smooth, quaffable, session ale. Well done."
"In conclusion, another solid product from Mayflower."
"D - Crsip, clean and refreshing. Lot's of flavor for such a low ABV; I can certainly see taking a few down."
"Overall, I would buy this reasonably priced 6-pack again to support the brewery. The product is nothing exceptional, but it is a very serviceable, and certainly not unpleasant, warm weather, refreshing beer."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Crystal clear pale yellow color. Nose is green apples. Flavor is green apples, hints of caramel and some hops. Unusual golden. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"I wouldn't say that this ale is anything special, but it is a smooth, drinkable beer, a crowd-pleaser perfect for a summer barbeque."
"Crystal clear, bright gold colour with a rocky white cap. Light grass and citrus in the aroma, slightly fruity sweetness, malt. Tastes pretty good. Bitterness starts out subdued, but pulls to the forefront as sweetness fades away leaving hop bitterness lingering in the finish. Hoppy up front, citrus and grassy with a bit of herbal character. Cereal grain flavours appear towards the end, a bit of malt too. Plenty going on the flavour overall. Light bodied with lots of carbonation, fairly dry. Nicely balanced, well put together, and quite tasty."
"D- This was a crazy drinkable beer. I had no problem drinking this all in a short time as well. This beer is really easy to drink and with a lower ABV this means I could drink this all night."
"Mouth/Drink: This one goes down easy and drinks nicely."
"a good session beer. i always get a couple of sixers of this stuff during the summer. a great ""gateway"" brew. similar to Cisco's Sankaty Light"
"Drinkability: This beer was gone before I realized it! I can. not. wait. to drink this in the summertime."
"D - Could drink it all day and not remember it...."
"Mayflower Blonde Ale is a pretty impressive beer from a brewery that I hadn't heard of prior to my trade with damienblack. Thanks man. It's a good drinker that *almost* earns the next highest flavor score. Bottom line: as solid as Plymouth Rock."
"Not really my thing, but a pretty clean brew. :)"
"Feh-- not worth the bother. Mayflower's duplication of watery, thin, tart, bad lager. You don't need anything special for that. If that's what you want, save the $$ and buy a six of Bud. Otherwise, if you want a nice light beer from Eastern Mass, buy Mayflower Pale Ale or something from Haverhill."
"Eh. It was better than Miller, but not by a huge margin. Very drinkable, however. I wouldn't say no, but I won't seek it out."
"D - This is a good ale. A nice sessionable summer brew."
"A clean, non-descript blonde ale. Hot summer better than lawnmower beer. Decent but barely a step above some of the macros out there."
"I was pretty exited to try this because I really like Mayflower's IPA and Pale ale but it didn't quite live up to the hype. I poured it into a glass and it does have a nice golden color, but it's pretty average from that point on. It smells like any basic macro brew beer while having a very bland taste, almost kind of watered down. Probably would be pretty refreshing on a hot day to go with a light snack, but other than that I wouldn't really recommend it. I'd stick with one of Mayflower's other brews."
"It seems tasty, but it's mild and exceedingly drinkable. Not particularly exciting, but solid. Not much for carbonation, and the flavor isn't strong, but a solid offering that disappears quickly. I think I like it, but I may need to ""test"" another one."
"Put this in your fridge for people new to craft brew - break it out when someone asks for a PBR or a Coors. If they like it, recommend Mayflower as a brand and suggest they try the pale ale next. You may just get a convert."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Upon the initial pour, a frothy, bright white head consumed three-quarters of the glass before eventually settling into a one inch cap embedded with craters and honeycombed with holes. Brew was pale gold and translucent. Nose revealed mostly cereal grains - not much going on there. Taste follows nose with a biscuity finish. Mouthfeel is light and lively and finishes fairly dry. Drinkability is the best part of this beer; easy drinking and sessionable, but somewhat lacking in flavor."
"A solid contender for a great session beer."
"Pours a nice slight haze golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast, and spices. The taste is sweet, malty, slight yeast, and some spices thrown in. Medium body. Drinkable, this is not a bad brew, tasty."
"Not crazy about the slightly salty, seltzer-ish aftertaste, though it is brief. Drinks okay, but one was enough (unless it were the ""only thing available"". Bland."
"A decent stab at a golden ale. Drinkable and one could have several in a sitting with little ill effect."
"Drinkability: Yeah--my 100th review here. For the style, this one is excellent as it is more complex than most American Blonde Ales...Sort of what you wish macro beer could be, but light years ahead of it. More of a summer beer but certainly sessionable..Overall exceptional for the style."
"was drinking this with the expectation of a ""golden bitter", so perhaps my negative preconceptions of ""american blonde ale"" didn't creep into my thoughts."
"Nice. Definitely a nice session beer on a hot summer day. Will look for this one in the future."
"...it tastes much better than it looks or smells. Biscuitry, citrus zest up front with light grain in back. Very complimentary. Some peppery spice with swallow. Very refreshing, humble, and pleasant. This is beer beer-what I think of when I think of when I hear the word beer."
"It sort of smells like BMC beer, but the malt and hops immediately tell you with the first sip it's a golden ale. Very mellow, very present, and very drinkable. A good solid session golden."
"A fairly crisp brew, but with a creamier feel than anticipated. I'm not sure that - to my mind - it it quite with the rest of the package. Nonetheless, a pretty tasty ale that drinks easy and settles both easily and lightly."
"Went nicely with pizza topped with some hot peppers and veggies, smooth simple flavors akin to a macro lager but without the off-flavors. I'm enjoying this alot and will be getting it again for sure. Very Drinkable."
"D - This beer is what every American Macro lager should aspire to be. It's got all of the ""clean"" and ""taste"" and none of the bad marketing and adjuncts."
"Not a huge fan of blond or golden ales, but if anyone can do it right, it is Mayflower. Appearance is impressive, as it showcases a clear orange/gold with one finger worth of white heading. Smell is not overly assertive, mostly some clean grain smells along with some biscuit, and mild floral tones. Taste has bright grain flavors, hints of honeycomb, nice bit of earth as well. Mouthfeel is light, and perfectly balanced. The malt interacts with the hops in an awesome way. Drinkability truly shines with this beer. It is light and overwhelmingly refreshing, while still maintaining quite a lot of complexity. Looking for a session beer to pair with a snack? Forget the lager with beer nuts. Try this with some salted pumpkin seeds; the pairing is terrific. Outside of their India Pale Ale, this is probably my favorite offering from Mayflower. If you see it, buy a sixer or two. Cheers"
"A middle-of-the-road craft Golden/Blonde Ale. Could be a good beach/boat beer. I would recommend this to non-beer drinkers. Could be an excellent gateway beer. However, I will stick with the Mayflower Pale Ale in the future."
"This isn't a bad blonde, but not one of my faves either. The beer has a slightly sulfury, somewhat perfumey aroma, that is offset somewhat by citrus notes. The beer pours a nice clear golden with a white creamy head that dissipates pretty suddenly. The taste began somewhat creamy, but was interrupted by a sharp peppery, spicy, tart hop flavor. This is not a particularly crisp beer, but the spices make it more biting and crispy that is probably warranted. The beer is modestly carbonated, has a bit more of a stinging aftertaste than I typically like. But it isn't a bad blonde either. There is an astringent, tart, pepperishness to the beer that is just too much. Not heaps of malt presence either, but that is to be expected with a blonde ale. Not bad, worth a shot, but I wouldn't return to it either."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice lighter beer that is worth pounding several of, especially since it's a little bit more flavorful than most in the style."
"Better than most; I'd describe this as a malty blonde ale with lots of grain husk flavor."
"D - Drinkability is good. The light and mild nature of the style make it naturally quite drinkable. This beer is smooth and sticks to that style well. Alcohol is almost completely hidden which just helps this category out evbne more. Glad I got to try it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" eggshell head over the clear dark golden brew. Head fades gradually, with good lacing. Aroma is pale sweetness coupled with lightly citrus hops. Taste stays the course, with light grains and balancing hops. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and drinkability is excellent. Nice one!"
"A well designed label graces the bottle of Mayflower's Golden Ale. The brew pours a transparent yellow/brownish color with some visible carbonation and a small white head that lays thin and screen-like atop the beer. Nice balanced nose of fruity hops and nutty malts. The beer has a bold malt backbone even though the bright hop character is mostly dominant. The body is semi-coating and there seems to be the slightest flare of alcohol heat... which is odd for the low ABV of the brew. It has a light body and sparkling carbonation and is extremely drinkable. Would definitely drink again!"
"Pours a nice (duh) gold with a decent haed that is inviting. Smell suggest a sweet maltiness. Taste is mainly malty, light, with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is light, refreshing. Vey easy on the drinkability scale due to its lightness and low abv."
"Very drinkable, light, and tasty. A new staple for my beer fridge in the summer months."
"Pours a clear, bubbly gold with hints of amber. There is a very short lived white head that dissipates completely leaving no lacing. Smell is mainly light grains with some sweet caramel malts, though the aromas are subdued all the way around. The taste is also subdued and has a more roasted malt flavor with some caramel sweetness as well. The mouthfeel is very crisp, clean and leaves only the slightest bitterness with a dry finish. This is definitely drinkable and would certainly make for a decent summer session brew."
"Glad I stopped by and sampled the local craft brewer"
"D: Excellent drinkability. This will be one of my session beers for sure."
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. The drink settled with a murky, pale gold appearance with some good lacing. The aromas were predominately hoppy with some bready florals as well. The taste was generally bittersweet with that doughy floral flavoring prevalent again. Decent carbonation made the drink enjoyable throughout the evening. Overall, a good blonde."
"Picked up a six pack this past weekend so that I could try a beer from this new brewery that I have read so much about. Poured into a tall pilsner glass. The color was sunshine golden yellow. Slight constant carbonation noticeable the entire time. Minute earthy smell on the nose. Taste was just as I expected: great. Very smooth, easy going down, great on the taste buds and a wonderful aftertaste. With the abv at 4.7%, it's a great session beer. Glad I picked up a sixer as this ale is one of my new favorites. A great intro to a new brewer."
"D - easy drinking brew."
"Feel was nice though, not very thin with lively carbonation, Drinkability was ok but I'd rather have something with more bold flavors."
