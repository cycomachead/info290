The aroma was way too sweet and unbalanced with too much cinnamon and sweet vanilla bean. However the taste (in my opinion) was as spot on as it could be with nice vanilla bean qualities balanced with a pinch of cinnamon and rice pudding. Overall if you love rice pudding and unique beers I'd definitely check this beer out, if you don't I'd probably stay away.","jaasen64","Feb 26, 2014"

3.75,-3.4,3.25,3.75,4,3.5,3.5," The taste is unusual but good, pretty interesting considering the origin of the idea, I have made horchata and shared with others who enjoy this specialty and it is not exactly what you would expect- I think the flavor of the alcohol is what seems to distract from the drink it pays tribute to. I understand the brewer who created this is not known for low alcohol versions of any style, but to me the spice is the best part of the taste a little less rice tangy-ness may have helped. I think this is pretty decent for what it is, but to me it missed the mark if Horchata or Or xata is what they wanted to pay tribute to. I think for a first taste of anything remotely similar to the original beverage it is better than average. Thanks again Adam, so glad I got to try this!","Slatetank","Jan 17, 2014"

Notes of brown sugar, cinnamon, and caramel come first followed by heavy vanilla character. Taste is super sweet up front with notes of burnt sugar, mild cinnamon, sweet cream, and caramel. The flavor is reminiscent of horchata, but I'd say this beer comes off a few degrees more sweet than most horchatas. Mouthfeel is bordering on syrupy with moderate carbonation. Overall, the Bruery did a good job of translating the delicious Mexican beverage into beer form. The resulting beer is very sweet and serves as more of a dessert drink than anything else.","homebrew311","Dec 24, 2013"

The aroma is heavy on vanilla and ground rice. The cinnamon provides some depth and spice, as with the beer's inspiration. It smells about as close to Mexican-style horchata as I can imagine for a beer. A relatively mild boozy note. Smells a little syrupy, though less maple and more agave or simple syrupy. The taste is somewhat sweet with a lot of that same vanilla rice flavor. It's rich but also somewhat cloying. Lots of funny sweetness in the finish with a light boozy note. It's not altogether heavy on the palate but it is rather heavy for the abv. I would guess that this beer would be a mess at ~10% abv. It's an interesting beverage, and I applaud the effort, but it's not altogether pleasant to drink. It's like boozy horchata, which isn't something that I particularly like, I guess. Improves as it warms, but still, I would have preferred to split this one with a group and just get a taster's worth.","popery","Dec 18, 2013"

3.39,-12.6,3.75,3.5,3,4.25,3.5,"Luckily, this paired amazingly well with spicy food, as any great dessert wine does - the sweetness would cut the spiciness and leave behind a playful and warm, toasty caramel and honey finish that made it fabulous for the occasion. Definitely not recommended on its own unless you enjoy the sensation of slowly acquiring diabetes, and far better paired with either spicy Mexican or Thai food. I heard from an acquaintance that this fell off in quality about a month in - and I can tell. This does remind me of a rather sweet, shake-like horchata I had in SD earlier this year. Otherwise, it's definitely not the most practical offering but it definitely was worth trying.","magictacosinus","Oct 27, 2013"
3.85,-0.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"o - Overall a very interesting beer that smells and tastes good, in small quantities, and I imagine is exactly what they were going for. If I had a 2 oz. pour of this is at a festival, or a 4oz. pour as part of a flight, I could find myself really liking this one even more, but trying to take down half a bottle got a little rough on the back end of the glass, as it is very sweet. Worth checking out, and goes well with Mexican food, but share the bottle with 3-4 other people.","mdfb79","Oct 25, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, vanilla, cinnamon, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with vanilla, cinnamon, and horchata flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium body mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is more horchata like in the taste versus the smell.","UCLABrewN84","0"
