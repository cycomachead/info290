"Overall (3.44) : I wasn't expecting a pale ale when I bought this or even popped the cap. For that reason I'm lowering the overall score a bit. I guess I was expecting an ale with fruit, or maybe something shandy-like. For that reason I am somewhat let down. I have to get past that, however and rate it as a pale ale. In that regard it is pretty good. Not quite as good as Mirror Pond, but a fair shake is owed to Twilight Summer Ale."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, biscuits. Taste is citrus, floral hops, malts kicking in at the finish, very high drinkability. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes a fine session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent good tasting beer, but it fails badly as a blonde ale.  There is nothing blonde ale-ish about it."
"Smooth and solid, an easy drinking pale ale taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  solid, refreshing, easy-drinking red ale.  Nothing over the top, nothing spectacular.  But a well built beer that is pretty easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Rating: B"
""
""
"Clear light yellow body. Big white foamy head. Aroma of lemon and malt. Spiced malty lemon pledge taste. Only ok."

"O- This is a simple and incredibly enjoyable summer ale.  The bright and delicate hop character blends perfectly with the malt character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel:  Lively medium carbonation. Near medium body."
""
"Brilliant deep golden with copper highlights and a frothy cream head. Aroma is zesty, with grass, light floral notes, and that signature Amarillo savory character. There's a hint of bready malt. Flavor is slightly fruity, likely attributable to specialty malt, with floral, perfumey notes, a touch of citrus, and a grassy, almost piney, earthy, crisp finish. Very clean and refreshing, though the perfumey character is somewhat overwhelming."
""
"Overall, a nice version of a blonde ale. Maybe a bit more hoppy than other examples but it is a great thirst quencher with good flavor to boot."
""

"Bottle came from a too warm cooler. Net result being that some qualities of the beer are exaggerated good, others less. Appearance is great with a huge frothy head and lots of lace. Aroma is fruit and hops with a little grain and malt. Body because of temp is hard to gauge. Aftertaste may have been affected by a shot of rye whiskey which gave it some not so good flavs."

"O - Great beer for a hot summer's day. Nice grapefruit flavor. Very refreshing."
"There's a very gentle bite in the feel, and it starts on the tongue leaning sweeter before hitting semi-dry and keeping light dryness on the tongue the rest of the way. Crispness nips lightly and doesn't give out, while smoothness comes through nicely."

"Overall, a very crisp and refreshing beer. I'm typically not a fan of the ""Summer Ale", but this one does it quite well."
""
"With all of the malt upfront in this beer you would expect some sweetness, yet this beer didn't offer that or any really distinctive malt flavor. The hops are acceptable but finish dry and astringent. It left me thirstier than when I started which isn't ideal for a summer brew."
""
"Overall: Doesn't really match the style of beer. I assumed that this beer was a pale until I saw the label on BA. So that would be my biggest complaint about it. A very enjoyable summer brew, would buy again (if on sale or something)."

" Overall an outstanding 4 Twilight Summer Ale from Deschutes Brewery. This is one of the best seasonal summer brews I've experienced! I will buy this brew again."

"The Verdict: Good beer. Well balanced, and it has a nice orange zest without beating you over the head with bitterness. Another winner from Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer poured nicely with good carbonation. It was clear, although I swear the bottle said it was bottle conditioned. The smell was mild, which I was expecting with it geared towards a summer session beer. The taste was pleasantly mild, following the smell. I could taste slight hints of citrus, but again it was quite mild. I thought it would be a good introduction beer for newbies, but my friend was not too fond of it. Overall it's a good beer for summer barbecue sessions"

"A superb example of what a summer beer should be. Tasty, crisp and light, this is definitely the summer beer to beat!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty solid summer brew. It's nothing mindblowing, but it's well crafted and works well with the hot weather. It's definitely hoppier than I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer does a good job of drinking like something light but still offering flavor. With the surge in session IPAs, this beer suffers a bit by comparison with it's muted hop profile. By no means a bad beer though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A very tasty summer style ale with lots of flavor and a great balance. This is a go to."
""
""

"Amongst the plethora of Summer Ales this sets itself apart with a significantly hoppy profile, a decent malt structure and a crisp lightness. Though it's not liberally strong in any department it delivers a good amount of flavor, whether it's a hop pine bitterness or a caramel malt sweetness or a malted barley backbone. Deschutes seems to produce a vast number of beers with the same hop profile and this seems to follow suit."

"Overall - Decent, Another solid summertime beer. Nothing new or exciting, just easy to drink with just enough flavor that you don't mind having over a bud or coors. The malts are a little much and take away from the sweetness and a little hop kick but still pretty good stuff here."
""
""
""
"O - I will more then likely get another six pack of it this summer but Im not rushing out to do it."

"Appears a blonde glowing golden hue with eggshell white head, fine speckled lacing looks great. Aromatics biscuit malts, bready character all day hints of floral/citric hop notes nice Summer Ale character extremely easy to drink. No catpiss or crushed aspirin from the reserved Amarillo additions but there's floral citric notes in the flavor that work with the light bready character get drinking while it's available. I drank Red Chair out of style, I'm about to do the same with this one...glad to see Deschutes in the Burgh it took a long time to get it in Western PA well worth the wait. Mouthfeel textured with moderate carbonation lighter bodied easy drinking lovely experience. Overall beach beer, lawnmower refreshing qualities with flavor and all malt base can't go wrong."
"Overall: very pleasant and enjoyable ale. Well done."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very refreshing seasonal that I look forward to drinking again. Another beautifully crafted beer from Deschutes."
""
""
"Its light and refreshing quality is refreshing like tropical punch, but its hop spice and floral bite gives much more of an ale-like character than most sweeter, heavier and off-balanced versions normally portray."
"Overall,  what a great Summer ale I always love to come back to in the summer."
"Overall a tasty Summer treat. Best by date is 8/01/14 so very fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome mouthfeel. Carbonation is right up to speed, if not going just a tad over the limit. Body has a smoothness, yet feels light. No alcohol note to impose upon my enjoyment."

"O: I like this beer. It is the best ""seasonal"" beer that I've had. It's not fruity but full of hops and quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a late summertime/fall drinking ipa. Bright crisp, fall time malting with a spicy, bright american summertime hopping. Great repeatability, session like feel, can easily do 6 pack here at a time and remain interested, enjoyable. solid recommend."

"Arrived a nice lemon drop amber with ample white head, with the latter showing a pleasant persistence to go with a biscuit malt and mild citrus aroma. Although the aroma was understated, the taste most certainly was not. A very hoppy blonde, with strong grapefruit and pine/spruce aromatics accompanied by woody and earthy flavors that became more prominent as I made my way through the pint. Wow. A very nice Pilsener and rock candy sweet malt backbone provides a counterpoint but still a hops forward summer beer. All in all a great beer but hops approach American pale ale in magnitude. If you are a bit of a bitter beer wimp, consider yourself warned."
""
"Very enjoyable flavors in this one. Hop forward profile without a bitter backbone, allowing the clean malt flavors to shine through; biscuits, toasted bread, cereal. Hop flavors were fruity, citrusy slightly earthy. Like an assertive and confidant blonde ale. Tasty and sessionable."
"Sampled today on 9/14/13. Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler and poured into a billiards ball pilsner glass. Pours a yellow-gold in color with a almost a 2-finger white head. LOTS of lacing was left which each sip. The aroma was of just some grains/malt, not much going on actually. The taste was much different than the smell and is very 'hoppy' with a bit of a harsh aftertaste for my likes."

"O - I wanted to like this one more than I did. Can't pinpoint what it is I didn't really go crazy for. Think I wanted a nice summer brew like Oberon or 312 but instead was surprised by the different flavors this one packs. Definitely not a bad beer. Drank it pretty easily. Just probably won't add it to my summer beer list. To be honest, I was reminded more of Fall than I was Summer when drinking this."

"Very easy drinking summer beer,standard but enjoyable would be great for a day at the beach."
""
"Drinkability: This is a good, tasty brew. Though on the lighter side, it offers a lot of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very pleasant surprise, and will be on my summer list in future. Even the wife might like it."
"This pours a golden toasted straw color with nice foaming. The foam dies down leaving some cotton in the glass. The aroma has a subdued straw-pine hop characteristic, with just the slightest whisper of a biscuity malt. A bitterness upfront has a pleasing straw note which tapers into a slightly piney finish. There’s a dry and lingering finish with the slightest hint of caramel sweetness. To be honest it’s a confusing mix of contrasting flavors with the hops and a touch of malt contrasting rather than complementing but I definitely enjoyed spending time with it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good summer brew and a nice take on the summer beer - something light with lots of body and not too much citrus."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light to light in body, slightly watery around the edges, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a slightly fizzy, then foamy and smooth mouthfeel. Closes semi-dry, with little residual stickiness on the palate or lips."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- a pleasant enough light summer beer though nothing to rave about. Comes off as a light pale ale with nothing to really set it apart from competition."
""
"Deschutes makes drinkable and approachable beer. That's the truth and worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad summer offering by Deschutes at all, and definitely a change of pace from all of the pilsners I've been downing. However, I do wish the hop profile were slightly zestier rather than soapy, and that the malts came through in a heartier manner. Definitely well made if only a bit underwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not sure i call this a blonde. It seemed more like a copper or a light pale to me. It's a bit dry on the finish for the style if you ask me but its a nice summer session."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a thick white 3 finger head. Nice retention and lacing as the glass goes down, looks pretty. Not so strong on the scent, from the bottle I could smell some lingering hops, from my glass there is not much to speak of, just a little toasted malt. Taste is nice and mild, a good summer ale just as the bottle states. Overall a nice summer beer, I could picture myself having a few by the pool in 1 sitting although I'm not sure ill be running back to this one after my 6 pack is gone."

"O - Very refreshing. Fits the summer ale category very well. A good summer beer for someone to try the is used to drinking budweiser or bud light. Easy drinknig but still as lots of flavor."
"This has just the right crisp feeling with a nice dose of resiny hops. For all the IPAs hopped to total oblivion, this is a nice reminder that a light hand on excellent hops (they say Amarillo) is still the great way to make beer. It seems like I'm always saying ""there are other better light beers."" Well, this is one of them. From the 12 oz bottle bought at AJ's Fine Foods in Phoenix."

"12oz bottle, freshness date is smudged. but I know it's pretty fresh. Golden body with a tall, frothy, white head, good retention and excellent lacing. Fruity aroma with grass, faint mandarin orange and citrus. Tastes are biscuity, fruity, citric grapefruit & mandarin, mango, mild pine, grassy, white peppery tingle on the finish. Light-to-medium bodied, pleasant carbonation. Overall, better than expected, and with the addition of the Amarillo hops, this was really nice to drink - very refreshing."
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid summer blonde ale. Not my favorite style, but this is a good representative of it. Would be great for hot weather."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A blonde/pale ale hybrid that's fairly easy drinking, with a light body and subtle complexities."
"I think this is a perfect beer for grilling outside in the summer. It has a very nice orange appearance With minimal head. The smell and taste both have elements of citrus to them which is perfect on a hot day. It has a very crisp finish and no real lingering unpleasant aftertaste. I think this is just a great summer ale and plan to have more."
"Overall - Pretty solid beer. Nothing special, but worth a 6 pack for the price"

"update 8/2/13 nose make it very inviting and fresh near midnight"
""
"Overall: This is a pretty standard summer ale; wheat, light, refreshing. It does decently well overall. Nothing to get crazy about, just a plainly solid summer brew."
"o: as said above, it could use a little fuller flavor. but for a 5% 'summer' ale its a nice beer to have a few while manning the grill. not the best, but a thumbs up."
""
""
""
"Overall: An enjoyable, if slightly confusing beer. The intense fruity flavor and aroma, while enjoyable, is not what I expect in a Blonde. Calling this an APA would be a little closer, but still miss the mark. The combination of Amarillo hops and the typical estery English yeast strain they probably used results in a beer that smells and tastes a little like candy. Interesting and drinkable for sure, but I wish it had a little more focus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad- clear, light, drinkable and pleasant. Smells better than it tastes, which is too bad, but just barely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. I could certainly see myself drinking this as part of a very enjoyable session. Were it available in Australia, it would make a pretty damn impeccable beach BBQ beer. Alas."

"A fine enough drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this is a less-than-average pale ale."
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a nice orange amber hue with fair carbonation. A light thin foamy head sits on top. Aroma find some citrusy hop bouquet and malts, but quiet light on the nose. To me the flavor was very light on the palette with hops balancing malts nicely. But the flavor is weak and light like a light, say an light APA. There are no faults that I can detect. A desent all purpose beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a nice, drinkable beer, but it becomes a bit monotonous, and I wouldn't want more than one at a time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer was well worth the mix in match price. These guys really know how to make good beer."
""
"Overall: A flavorful, easy-drinking beer. This is very refreshing, I can definitely see how this fits well as a summer beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a good, light and crisp summer beer...easy drinking but with plenty of flavor too. Another fine brew from Deschutes...glad to have tried this one."
""
"O - A good all around summer brew."
"Taste saves the day as creamy malted grains brush up against a lightly hopped backbone. Mildly bitter after you swallow. Clearly well-crafted. Refreshing, sessionable, and tasty. What more could you ask for from a 6-pack in the summer?"
"D: Highly drinkable, warm weather fare. This is light, hoppy, with a crisp refreshing bite. Probably my favorite “Summer Seasonal” so far. Drinks more like a hoppy APA than say a traditional Blonde. Good PNW hop varieties and just a dash of something different in the grain/yeast character. Would recommend and will look for this one every summer moving forward."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, wish I'd bought more of these when summer started - although around here this year, it was kind of hard to figure out when that was exactly. Very nice, drinkable summer beer."
"I would definitely not be disappointed to find this beer on offer at a BBQ or other sun-laden event."
"Hard pour resulted in a bit over a finger white head very small bubbles, well above average lacing over medium gold clear body, multiple streams of grouped bubbles rising from bottom of glass. Significant bready notes in the nose some grassy and light resiny hops. Taste mirrors nose, quite bready ala English Pale Ale, slight bit of resin, floral notes, decent bitterness on back end. Mouthfeel medium, a bit heavy for the style, good effervescence, fairly dry finish. A nice seasonal, but not one I'll go back to by choice."
""
""
""
"Yellow-gold, average head. Smells more piney than it tastes. Citric hops are present, pretty mellow (which I noticed when comparing with alternating sips of a pale), but balanced with sweet malts that don't cling with plenty of carbonation for a nice summer beer. Nothing special, but an easy summer drinker."
""
"It's a really nice summer beer, going down way too easy."
""
"Picked up a single to try. This beer steps a little outside the blonde ale box to be more like a light pale ale. Most blonde ales I've had are bready or corny with a little fruit, this has a little bread but the citrusy hop finish of a mildly hopped pale ale. It's a perfectly fine pale ale, like hundreds of others."
""
""
""
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a crisp hop bite up front that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt into a slightly dry finish. Spicy hop flavor provides some dry bitterness that's countered by light fruit, bread and biscuit. Hop presence is stronger than nose suggests but there is some nice sweetness for balance. Hints of grass, straw, apple, pear, bread and biscuit. Well balanced and sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good summer beer here. This is not your typical Blond Ale. Has enough malt and hop punch in it to seem more like an American Pale Ale. Nice and vibrant while still remaining fairly light and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing too profound about this one - just a nice, pleasant summer blonde with a solid hop presence and smooth finish. Summer beers are some of my favorite, so I don't know if it stands up among the best, but I can see myself buying a six pack a year."
""
""
"Overall, a solid clean summer beer. It could be a bit more ""airy"" and light on the mouthfeel, but still worth a night on the deck as the sun sets."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very tasty and easy drinking summer ale. Nice in the 100 degree temps."
""
""
""
""
""
"Caramel color with a thin head - The aroma was light and reminded me of Irish soda-bread and citrus. There was a taste of bread and orange citrus, however the orange citrus was light. The hoppiness was distinct, yet understated. The carbonation led to a great mouth-feel and presentation. It had a slight crisp to the palate, and its taste was rich for a blonde. It's very easy to drink, and would go great as a pair with summer fare."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Whenever I hear the term 'Summer Seasonal' I just assume it's going to be on the lighter side, with spices and citrus. That is exactly what Twilight Summer Ale represents. If you're a huge Blue Moon or Shock Top fan then definitely check this one out. For the rest of us, however, there are better options out there for the summer months."
""
""
"Golden with a thin head, no lace. Smell is cracker, bread dough, soap, slight citric. Taste is a lighty crackery malt with a nice washing of citrus hop reminiscent of orange zest and steeped peels. Nice bit of hop boost to a blonde ale. Medium body that holds together well, decent level of carbonation adds to the character. Clean, very mildly bitter finish. Overall, a pleasantly hoppy blonde ale, easy going, easy drinking. I'll keep it in my fridge this time of year."
""
"Quite drinkable and pleasing overall."
""
""
"Overall: A solid summer beer but there isn't anything remarkable here. I would have another given the chance."
""
"O: good beer, so far my favorite summer seasonal I have had. Refreshing and clean and very well balanced."
""
""
"Delicious. Not an over the top hop bomb, but the light, crispy hops make this a very good example of a blonde ale. Only the color throws you off a bit, but hey, it's delicious, so who cares!"
""
""
""
"O-A nice summer beer, refreshing and nice balance."
"Overall: A good hot day beer option. Nothing exciting, just all-day summer drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"O: Drinkable, but unbalanced toward the sweeter end of the spectrum. Could use some non soapy bitterness to add more complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Extremely refreshing and balanced. Not entirely flavorful, but what's there works nicely. Perfect for a hot day."
""
""
""
"O: Gonna have to give this a 4.0 because I'm not 100% familiar with this category and I like it. Not necessarily a refreshing beer, so it's odd that it's a summer beer. Perhaps the twilight is the right time to drink this. Very comforting beer. Shouldn't be surprised from Deschutes!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"3.0 D: Middle of the road blonde. It's decent, but nothing is noteworthy."
"O- Good beer. Not the best summer beer around, but up there."
""
""
"Reviewed on 09-24-12"
"Flavor is hops-forward with a slight biscuity kind of undertone. Mild flavors lead by a very reasonable hop bitterness credited to Amarillo. Combine that with light carbonation and this is a supremely drinkable brew."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O: A great summer beer, enough depth and character to be really enjoyable, but not so much so that a person wouldn't want to drink more. I can see this being a definite gateway beer for non-craft drinkers. Great stuff, wouldn't expect anything less from Deschutes."
"Pours a hazy light orangey-yellow with a half thumbs width white head. A nice bright, sweet fruity aroma alongside a hit of malt. Flavor starts off with a hit of sweet fruit, countered by some of grassy hops that seem to accentuate the sweet fruitiness, and closes out with some rice cake. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, a decent summer brew. Very sessionable and low key, certainly not the most exciting brew out there though that's not what its trying to be."
"Overall nice, nothing special but then again you usually don't want summer beers to be too strong in any direction. This had some nice light malts and gave it a nice kick with the resinous hops, and nice hop flavors, but still quite drinkable."
""
"an outstanding summer beer, infinitely sessionable and plenty interesting. smells like fresh hops but not in an overpowering way. it smells balanced by some fruit, maybe clementines or something not quite tart and not quite sweet. flavor is very fruity, but not in a fruit added way, i think its just the character of the hops used, which leaves an excellently crisp finish. very different flavor profile for a summer beer. i could easily do a 6pack of these in an afternoon. delicious when ice cold. feel is good, light and drinkable without being watery. less than medium body, exciting on the tongue, and clean finishing. no complaints with this one, great summer brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this isn't quite what I anticipated, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. More tropical hops then expected, but this hop-head won't argue with that. It sacrifices a bit of depth for drinkability, but drinkability is key in a good summer brew. A great, gorgeous, hoppy blonde. Cheers!"
"Pretty good summer offering here. Decent hop content without going overboard for the style. A definite quaffer."

"O - overall it's a very good beer and a great summer beer. I got it because I was going to BBQ some steaks on a warm evening in Cali and it was perfect. I am BBQin right now with sandals on while drinking my 3rd twilight."
""
"Pours cloudy orange with white bubbly head that fades quick. Smells of floral notes, honey, pine, and light cereal. Tastes of light cereal notes, light honey, mild bitterness, pine, and citrus. Light in body with medium carbonation. Pretty good flavors here, better than a lot of summer ales."
"Overall: A very delicious one indeed. Glad I picked this up from my friend. This is a great example of a beer that can be enjoyed on a hot, summer day as the sun is setting. I would definitely pick this up again if/when I see it. If your a fan of a decent summer beer, this one is for you"

"Well balanced, excellent summer brew. Very, very high on drinkability. This just doesn’t get old. It’s the 3rd day in a row that I’ve had one, and very few beers interest me past the 2nd or 3rd bottle. I will get it again."
"Overall - A decent summer ale. The flavor is fairly one dimensional, and leads toward that lemony citrus hop, but overall it's gentle and an easy drinker. If you're looking for something to challenge your taste buds, steer clear. Nothing off-putting, but a tad boring."
""

"Awesome summer seasonal! I may like this even more than Mirror Pond and Inversion. So easy to drink and oh so enjoyable as well. This one just jumped into my top 5 for 2012 so far."
"A downright well balanced APA, light enough to quaff in the dead of summer and flavorful enough to keep your taste buds in check."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that disappears quickly. Scent is a well-balanced blend of hops and malt...with a bit of grain. Some faint citrus aromas. Taste is quite refreshing...almost like German malts with a nice hop presence. Some light citrus hop notes with balancing carmel malt. Nothing too much going on here, just a refreshing easy-drinkin beer. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a good session beer. Like I said, not much going on, but a good summer beer for when you're out mowing the lawn."
"O: Muh. Very bland. Not much going on at all. Miller-Bud-Coors drinking would probably like this."
""
"Body is medium, refreeshing and really overall a nice find. A great summer beer that will now take its place in my summer lineup among Anchor summer and Sierra Nevada offerings."
"O: Overall, I felt this beer to be pretty much as advertised: a great end-of-the-day summer brew that will satisfy your cravings for flavor but also be light enough to have a few. Not the most flavorful or complex offering from this brewery, but it fills a niche quite well. Cheers!"

"Pretty much your typical summer brew. You always hope for more, but they rarely come through."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium yellow-orange amber. Thin white head that dissipates to a ring, light lacing. Light aroma of herbal hops and sweet malt, not intense, but pleasant. Taste is dry hops and very light sweet malt, citus and pine. Subdued flavors, but does not feel watered down. Light to medium bodied. A pleasant, simple, subtle ale with a nice balance of flavors."

"O - This is a tasty summer ale and very suitable for the style. The flavours are mild yet satisfying. I could easily down quite a few of these on a hot summer's day and certainly won't overwhelm the palette."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, golden/copper color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight wheat, sweet malt, citrus hops, and a hint of pine. Fits the style of an American Blonde Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight pine, sweet malt, and a hint of wheat. Overall, an easy-drinking beer. Good feel, appearance, body, and aroma."

"O - Nice session beer that I would be happy to throw down at any time of year."
"O - a definite summer brew with bright hop flavours and big carbonation, the dry factor would suggest having another on a hot day"
"A light, crisp summer ale. Very good and refreshing."
"Nice orange color, crystal clear, with a nice cap of bright white foam. Somewhat bready on the nose, with just a bit of fruity hops. Nicely balanced on the palate, with good sweet malt balanced nicely against the mild hops. Drinkable, especially nice on a warm, spring Saturday afternoon."
"a great summer brew, twilight never fails to hit the spot. as with most deschutes (and most pnw breweries) it's definitely on the hoppy side, but that's not a bad thing."
"O: I would have to say my least favorite of the Deschutes seasonals. That being said I think that red chair and jubelale are outstanding beers. So the twilight is certianly worth your time and money, a very nice summer beer."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow hue which leaves a two finger head and heaps of lacing,the smell is citrus hops,lychee,passionfruit and a touch of toffee malts,the mouthfeel is light bodied and sessionable with tastes of passionfruit,lychee,citrus zest,piney hops,toffee,paw-paw and finished with a lemon grass spicy hop dry bitterness and overall like the label states its definately a true summer ale easy drinking still with flavour and great for next to the BBQ on a hot summers day cheers."
"Overall I enjoyed this for what it is. A summer ale that is to be drank while doing lawn work. Long live summer."
"This is a pretty decent offering that I found both tasty and refreshing. Not the best summer beer out there, but worth a try for sure!"
"Overall, not a bad beer. I wouldnt quite call it a summer ale. More of a pale ale to me. Still, a good drinker on a warm day."
"O - Pretty average beer. Nothing really stands out. A lot different than other Blonde Ales Ive had."
"Dark honey color. About six feet of off white head. My nose is in danger from it. Lacing remains cemented to my glass. Smell is light citrus and slight bread. Pretty hop forward on the palate for a summer beer. Explodes on the tongue then really cuts to a dry finish. Not thirst quenching for a summer beer. Drinks fairly easy though. The beer is rather ho hum. Nothing shines or is out of the ordinary bad. Rather simple and average. A tick, but nothing more."
"O: Decent beer, a bit heavy for the style IMO. A little too much sweet malts, a little too much body."
"Pick this up this weekend. After drinking I was a little let down. A- Drank from the bottle so I never saw the color. S- desent , not over powering T-nothing noticable till the bitter finish M- smooth O- decent beer but expected better. Next time ill try another summer ale."
"Dr: Very pleasant, refreshing, and drinkable. Quite affordable as part of a sampler pack. I'd have it again."
"O: Very drinkable and good amount of flavor for being 5%. A very nice summer beer with a nice little hop kick, that's well balanced as well."
"Overall one of my favorite light summer ales. Hoppy enough to provide some flavor, but light enough to be easy drinking."
"O – Eminently drinkable, could and would have another, a sixer will be going to my next backyard event 3.5"
"Light bodied, decent carbonation, a grainy aftertaste. Not a bad beer, but nothing special either."
"O: A decent beer, but for me kind of a disappointment coming from Deschutes. I guess this style isn't supposed to have a lot going on. For a summer release, it's pretty refreshing."
"The beer pours an amber golden liquid with lots of carbonation and a big puffy cap of foam. The aroma is a mixture of pine and lemony citrus. The palate has a touch of pine hops balanced by some biscuit malt. A little different as far as summer ales, and that is a good thing. It goes down easy and provides bit hops at the same time."
"O/D - Highly drinkable beer for the summer months, but nothing truly extraordinary stands out."
"I was pleasantly surprised to see this one stacked up in a private Vancouver store, but didn't want to waste my budget on another blond. Then even more pleasantly surprised to find this on tap at St. Augustine's. It was plasantly surprisingly hoppy, this is a pale ale, with orange citus taste. Faint hops. Nicely drinkable."
"O: Overall, it's a pretty good summer ale. Probably not my first choice for a summer beer, but not bad."
"This pours light yellow, maybe straw color with a white head which has okay retention. The smell is light, grainy, and a little grassy and fruity. Feel is medium light with good carbonation. The taste is about the same, its a little sweet, you get some grassy and grainy notes, with a little hop bitterness, it has a different aftertaste hard to describe. Overall a decent summer beer (which is a style of beer which I often find boring)."
"Cheers!"
"This seems like a solid blonde but there is a lingering after taste that is bitter and sweet and not in a good way."
"Overall: As an ale released as a summertime seasonal, I fully expected something a bit lighter, which it was, and served me fairly well on this sweltering summer afternoon."
"Haven't had too many Blonde Ales in the past but will now make an effort to drink more because this is a great representation of what that style can be. Recommended!"
"O: It is very nice overall. Easy to drink. Nothing mind-blowing, but wonderfully drinkable, easy going, a great summertime beer. It has some flavor and backbone in there while still being refreshing. One I'd like on a hot day that is enjoyable, but one I don't have to think about."
"Good beer, but be advised it might not be what you expected."
"O: This is a very good summer time beer. It is the one I most often purchase this time of year when the weather is warm."
"overall this is an extremely tasty, albeit simple summer ale. the amarillos makes this a bright and happy hop juice summer quencher. brilliant in its simplicity. loved it."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a small 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to an oily film. Random tiny spots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest and pine hops along with some grapefruit notes. Taste is of sweet malt, grapefruit juice, and citrus zest. Very mild bitterness on the palate after each sip quickly fades. This beer has a bubbly level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very refreshing and tasty summer beer and I am glad I picked one of these up."
"A very simple, easy-drinking summer ale. Average malt character and some nice hop, especially in the aroma. Solid all around, and quite good for what it is-I'd be happy to drain a 6-pack of this from time to time."
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice lighter beer with substance and a lot flavor making it worth drinking for a very long time."
"Pours out a clear golden colored brew, slightly darker on the top half than the bottom half. Lots of little rising bubbles form a nice foamy white head which is very sticky. Scent is light sweet malts with maybe a touch of floral hop. Light sweet start, some lemon zest, touch of bittering hop, a bit grassy. Some fruit notes show up. Medium bodied, pretty soft. Very nice summer beer."
"Very good, solid. Not really a traditional blond ale, more like an IPA light."
"Overall-This is supposed to be a summer beer which I agree because It's drinkable, sessionable and refreshing. Just a little too mellow."
"Summer vacation, long day outdoors - so, a light ale with a decent, but not decadent bitterness, sure goes down like 'twas nothing at all, in a good way. Something to sip away the hiking 'aches' with, as the sun finishes its long arc across the horizon."
"O: Good summer beer. The lighter flavor profile makes it easy to drink a few of these on a good day."
"Taste is a good IPA/American Blonde. Hoppy, dry but balanced with malt. Good on a hot day. Problem is, there are a lot of beers out there just like this one."
"o - Overall a pretty average beer, but a good alternative to a BMC light beer. Definitely some citrus hops in the nose, but just not enough from the taste to be anything special. Would order this if I saw it at a bar in Oregon and it was offered with some other light beers, but wouldn't seek it out again."
" I'm not a huge Deschutes Brewery fan, but this is a safe buy if I'm looking for something to have on hand when expecting guests."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is light with high carbonation, and it goes down reasonably smoothly. Overall, this is a good sessionable ale for summer. Pretty tasty and light enough to drink on a hot day."
"A crisp and refreshing beer that is perfect to enjoy with the summer months."
"Overall a great summer session beer. It is hoppy yet subdued enough to make it an easy drinking session beer."
"Would be great by the pool or in the park. Drink when outside and in the sun. Switch to something hoppier when the sun goes down."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"I like it"
"D - Not bad, but could be a lot more than it is. A touch of spice shows itself every other sip or so, but if they ramped that up a notch it would give this brew an entire other dimension."
"It pours a bright golden color whith a foamy white head that left a ring of lacing with each sip. It smells of lemon and grapefruit with a hint of sweet orange. The taste consists of bitter lemon and pine with a bready finish that lingers. The beer is light with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. I thought this was a nice variation of a summer beer, it's hoppier than most which is probably why I like it more than others."
"I was looking for a good summer beer to enjoy and chose this one. I am a big fan of the darker Deschutes beers so I thought I would try this off of the list. It was a little hoppier then I was expecting, but not bad. It was enjoyable, but not what I was craving. I would try it again, but nothing I am going to go out of my way to get."
"Overall: This is a good beach beer of on those long summer days working outside and you need to be hydrated but besides that I cant think of another time I would actually want this beer"
"This summer refresher does exactly what it's supposed to do, while even impressing the hophead in the process."
"Not really a blonde ale, more like a lighter take on a pale. Hops are very bright and the subtle fruitiness might rub some the wrong way as a bit of cider creeps forward in the middle of the drink. I found this to be very enjoyable and light in all the right places. Refreshing. Summer heat is intense enough, the beer doesn't need to be."
"not a fan at all, however, everyone else i was with loved it. it's a summer seasonal american blonde ale. it was like a watery pale ale with a hint of sweetness behind it. very drinkable except for the overcarbonation, which was pervasive. i could see knocking back a good 10 of these in an hour, the drinkability was that good, but i wouldn't enjoy it."
"O: Very easy to drink but there's nothing spectacular about it. I could see downing a couple on a hot summer day but we rarely have those in Portland. Price is reasonable - usually $7-8 for a six pack, maybe a bit more or less depending on where you go. Not bad overall, average."
"Would be easy to finish a few of these in one sittting."
"This is a great beer, especially on those warm summer days. Easy drinking, and only 5% abv...keep 'em coming please."
"I love this beer, a great seasonal light beer. It is a little on the carbonated side but it seemed to work well with the hoppy flavors. Pours clearer golden amber, small head. Very drinkable. I look forward to getting a few more of these and sharing them with friends on hot summer afternoons. refreshing and definitley worth trying it out."
"Drinkability: It's OK for a light summer beer. A little too light on the flavors for me, but not bad. It's light and refreshing, and I'd have one on tap on a hot day...but probably wouldn't do a session with this one."
"I cannot really say much about this beer. The smell was all hops, and tasted like that too. No malt at all, it was like choking down hop extract . Very astringent. I wonder if I bought a bad bottle; however, it was at a Portland beer store with a high turnover so I doubt it had gone bad."
"Same thing with the taste, light blonde, small hop dose, although probably bigger than a lot of people want in a blonde beer (i.e. those who want their beer to be as close to water as possible). Nothing bad, nothing extreme, just a straight forward blonde ale for a girlfriend or hot day with a lawnmower. Pairs nicely with spicy food."
"I'm not digging the bitterness on this one. Maybe it's still too cold, but it seems to be dominating instead of blending. Bummer. (A little better as it warms)."
"Pours a one and a half finger head that fills up the glass perfectly. The head is about half big bubbles and half small bubbles, but it looks very creamy. It's leaving excellent lacing, that is clear. The head is actually hanging around for a decent amount of time, not going away completely at all. Pretty impressive there. The body is a gorgeous golden color, very bright, very nice looking. Carbonation looks like it's a little on the high side, but not by too much, it looks like it'll be nice even if it is a little much. Visibility is ok, can't see much through this beer, but it's by no means ""cloudy", I can see some things. Overall the appearance is very nice, the lacing is very impressive and so is the head. Very nice smell to this beer, very refreshing smelling and clean. It has a small hop note up front and then some evident fruit in here as well. Light fruit, maybe lemons or something like that, very small, but it adds a very nice smell to the beer. Nice malt smell to this as well, light, maybe caramel malts. Overall the smell isn't to crazy or out there, but it's really nice, very summer like and refreshing to the nose. Taste is a little disappointing, for sure not as rich of a flavor as I was expecting, but still way better than there cascade ale, which is also a blonde ale. The hops and fruit are a lot more present in this beer than in the cascade ale, other than that they are very similar. Overall the flavor is just much bigger in this beer than in the cascade ale, still not as big as I would like, but good none the less. To describe this beer from from to end, I get the hops first, then some nice malt, mixed in with clean crisp water, then comes some orange and then a hop bite to finish it off again. This beer has a lot of the flavors enter and then come back later in the palate, it's very nice. I don't know if I just don't pay attention to this fact in most beers I review, or if it's just especially well done in this beer, but I am noticing it a lot now. It's not a chaotic palate, it's not all over the place, it just has nice flavors coming and going and then coming again. The flavor still isn't as much as I want, but overall it's a really well done beer and it's got really nice flavors and mixes them up well, even if it't not as flavorful as I would like. The mouthfeel is decent, not as much carbonation as I would like, but still for sure more than the cascade ale had. The body is big enough to fit the style, which isn't hard because it's a blonde ale, but still, it's not water. The carbonation is my only complaint, but it's still not bad at all. Drinkability is very good on this beer, it's tasty, crisp, refreshing, not a problem to drink at all! Overall this is a really good summer beer, slightly fruity, slightly hoppy, the best of both worlds. Not as much flavor as I would like, but that's not the end of the world in this case."
"O - a nice refreshing beer with a nice amount of hops and bitterness to keep it interesting."
"Pours orange-gold with a smallish white head. Grainy aroma with a subdued tropical hoppiness. Sickly flavor, rather astringent and boring with grains, crystal malt, meek hops, and a mineral water palate. Very pedestrian, like something you'd get at a tiny brewpub in a small town. Not worthy of the Deschutes brand."
"Overall Drinkability - You have to be in a hoppy mood, because this one will linger on your tongue for a while."
"Overall not bad at all here This was a very good little session ale that I would have no issue at all with trying out again some day"
"Another solid seasonal from Deschutes here."
"Overall: A good APA, lots of flavor and easy drinking."
"O: A well crafted beer. It was more than I expected to receive for a summery beer. $6.99 for 6 pack on sale. Looks like a steal now! The hop taste will surprise some, read the bottle after drinking beer as it mentioned Amarillo hops."
"It wasn't bad, just nothing special. With so many great APAs out there and easily found, I wouldn't get this again."
"Pours is a moderate golden color with a slight amount of haze. White head with good retention. Nice ringy lacing on the way down. Nose is some light citrus hops and a bit of bread. Nothing terribly complicated, but it works well in the nose. At the same time, the taste seems a bit too tame. Good feel with a nice balance. Perfect level of bitterness to drink quite a few of during a sitting."
"D= Nice brew. I like it there's no doubt about that but whether or not I'll buy it again is up for debate. I prolly will middle of next summer just to see how it is then."
"Overall a pretty average pale ale. I would expect more from Deschutes. Hopefully next summer they will revamp their seasonal."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker glass. Color is a little orange/amber with a small head and minimal lacing. Taste was sweet malt (a good thing) with a bit of citrusy flavor to boot. Very smooth, crisp, and quite drinkable. Will definitely look for this again next summer. Well done, Deschutes."
"O: Not an amazing beer by the brewery's standards, but it will appeal to a very wide market."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the trade, 12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp bubbly light orange with a thin off white head that diminishes to barely a ring and leaves just a trace of lacing on the glass. Aroma is crisp earthy citrus hops in front of sweet malts. The taste is a nice amount of sweet malts balanced nicely balanced by crisp citrus hops. The beer is quite smooth, crisp and refreshing with great smooth carbonation, a great summer beer, even on a cool late summer night."
"D-This is a pale ale? Really? Hmmm... It was easy to drink but too bitter to enjoy repeatedly if you were in the mood for a summer/pale ale."
"D - A mild and light pale ale that does the style justice. Not my favorite brew or style, but for what it is, it is done well."
"I really wish this brew were available in 12ers here in Austin, as a six-pack just goes too fast. If you live in a warm climate like I do, this could easily be a great year-round drinker, as there isn't one bit of that seasonal type of novelty feel to this beer that tends to pertain to a lot of the more fruity wheat beers a lot of craft brewers tend to release. Best of all, Deschutes is one of the only craft brewers I'm aware of that DOES NOT follow the norm of releasing their seasonal brews two months before the actual season. This way, you get to enjoy the beer fresh when you should actually be drinking it. What a concept!"
"Poured a golden amber brown with a half finger of head and left a little bit of lacing sticking to the glass. The nose was citrusy, with a mild hop aroma and had hints of caramel. It also had orange zest notes as well. The flavors were pretty much the same as the nose but the caramel malts were more potent on the palate but had citrus and hop accents that had a good balance. The brew was medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a slight sweet but citric hop bitter clean finish; very good. It drank really good and is a good session beer on a hot summer day in SoCal poolside with some BBQ."
"Very drinkable. A little milder than their ""Mirror Pond Pale Ale", but it's pretty good beer."
"m/d-Light bodied, even for a pale ale. It went down fairly smooth, but isn't on the top of my to drink list. This my least favorite beer that I had at the pub."
"Taste is similar, two-dimensional, boring grapefruit and cracker through and through. It is ok for the style, but I'll never buy it."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's an easy drinking beer. It wasn't the most flavorful beer I've had but the balance made it pretty easy drinking. Decent beer overall."
"Great golden color with solid lacing. Typical smell and taste of the better pale ales but crisper with a great hop finish more reminiscent of an IPA. Great overall taste, not foamy in the mouth the way some other PAs can taste, more clean if that makes any sense. Great beer, and not just a summer drinker."
"Medium-light body, medium-high carbonation. Dry finish"
"D- Well-rounded ale with a flavor to please and a consistency to chug"
"This is the best ""summer ale"" I've ever had, and yes, I know it isn't an official category-- but this beer is perfect for what it aims to be."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with red hues. The lacing is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of mandarin oranges, and grapefruit with a some light caramel malt tones underneath. The taste is similar to the aroma. There is a stale feeling to both the taste and aroma of this beer, but I don't believe it is stale. It is Deschutes' summer seasonal, and it is summer. And Deschutes has only been in Minnesota for a few months now so it couldn't have been sitting on a store shelf for the last year. I don't think this beer is old. I thing this beer tastes as though it is old, and that is not a good quality for a beer to have. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, I will pass on this beer in the future."
"a consistent brew with a rather proper look of amber with some lace. nose of straight pine. and a palate that cleans of in dryness. there is some citrus but just start consistent pine quality that blends well with the malt. not thick. not to lean. and rather one dimensional. not my idea of a summer beer. would like to see a bit more range. whether that means more mild or not."
"Just like it is suppose to be. A nice easy to drink summer beer. I enjoy it, but wish there was just a little more to it. A small grip, really a very good beer for the summer months."
"Drinkability - kind of a mild-mannered beer. I could come back to this one often enough I suppose."
"Twilight Ale poured a nice light straw color. It had a mild malty aroma with minimal hops noticeable. The taste had an upfront hoppiness, that was more spicey than floral and nicely balanced the malt sweetness. The mouth feel was good but nothing outstanding. I would say that this is a very good summer or session beer."
"A little too much pale malts in this one. The good orange and spice flavors get overshadowed but makes for an okay twilight sipper..."
"Wish it weren't seasonal, I am a big fan"
"Taste has a nice balance of zesty hop flavor and bitterness. Throw in a light, slightly sweet malt base with a clean yeast profile and this is a mighty tasty summer brew. I am already on my second sixer of it. Nice and easy drinker leaning towards, but not overwhelmed by, floral hoppy goodness. Like Mirror Pond's freckled younger sister, she's cute as hell...but not quite like her fine-ass older sibling."
"D: This isn't anything that stands out and I don't see why Deschutes uses this as a Summer release. Easy drinking but just gets mixed in with all other APAs I've drank."
"D: Would make a good session. The name is apt to an awkward extent, as I finish off the day sipping a few of these down after having a few more intense brews."
"If you don't mind a slightly hoppy summer quencher, then this is a great choice. I know I don't. Still damn tasty after it's started to warm up."
"Verdict: Unfortunately, this is a big step back from this brewery's other Pale, Mirror Pond. I can see what they were shooting for--a lighter, more summery Pale Ale--but this just ends up a little neutered."
"D - Great beer to split a 6-pack of at a BBQ, perfectly drinkable and works well for it's season."
"Drinkability: This one would be best ice cold. A hoppy ale that I would recommend to those in the like."
"Pours a transparent gold with a one finger head, good head retention and lacing all the way down. Not much of a scent to it. There is some breadiness that is noticable. The taste is rather bland for an APA. The hop bitterness is there, but it's not balanced by any noticable sweetness. This might be a good summer beer up north, but I can't find a reason to drink this on a hot Texas afternoon."
"D-Nice beer here...Love the fruity dimensions."
"Drank from my Highland Hollows pint glass. A very clear copper colored pour. Light head, no lacing, substanial carbonation. Smells somewhat hoppy, but doesn't taste hoppy. Not a very bitter beer. I drank 4 of them, so it is a very refreshing beer that goes down easy. This is a good beer to drink on a brightly lit 4th of july."
"Was looking for something new and relatively economical and this seemed to fit the bill. Pours a light, pale, copper color with about a finger and a half of white head that recedes quickly with a bit of lacing. Scent is mostly citrusy hops but a little underwhelming. Taste is also a little thin. More hop flavor than there is bitterness, which is a nice change of pace.Body is a bit on the lighter side with a nice crisp finish. A little lacking for an APA; however, felt it kind of made up for this in the sense that it marketed as a ""summer ale"" and it fits that description perfectly. There is no denying that this is a hugely drinkable beer that pairs perfectly with BBQing on a hot summer evening."
"I'll probably purchase another 6 or 12 pack before the summer ends. Yes... I'll give Deschutes another shot. Come on, they're from Oregon."
"Overall, an excellent summer session beer that is light but has good flavor. Another winner from Deschutes and highly recommend. Avail here in TX finally. Rotation: summer seasonal so will have to get it while it's fresh. Good summer session beer. [R-SMsesaonal; Y]"
"D: Super drinkable, a great simple summer beer."
"Glad I only bought a single bottle, wont be doing this one again. A self proclaimed apa that seems to stray from the style."
"This bright golden-copper colored ale forms a modest head after a pour into a wide chalice, quickly settling down. The nose gives notes of citrus hops and a pleasantly bready malt. The flavor complements the aroma, with a nice initial smooth maltiness giving way to grassy, citrusy hops. Otherwise, it tastes very clean and finishes dry. The lowish alcohol and light body make for a very drinkable summer beer, and an excellent session brew at any time."
"D - Easily sessionable, exactly what I look for on a hot day."
"The beer pours a clear yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is oranges and malt. The flavor is earthy hops and bready malt and is not very appealing. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. The smell and taste of this beer are not very good. I expect better from Deschutes."
"Nice beer. Not much to set it apart from the pack, but a solid pale that represents its genre well."
"Mouthfeel is light and has a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Nice mild aroma of floral hops and malty caramel. Taste featured sweet malts up front followed by some citrusy orange and a hint of bitterness on the finish. Very drinkable and smooth. Not overly distinctive, but by no means bland. Nice session ale for summer, as the name would indicate!"
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. I have had better but it is still a good hot summer day beer. I would drink it again."
"Excellent on drinkability. Not a stunner by any means, but a solid beer for ""sessioning"" purposes."
"pours a golden color with a fast receding 1 finger head to fresh ring..smell is some citrus ,grass, hops, malt, some lemon but its faint...the taste is a little better it has a malt forward taste like a good lager followed by some hops and citrus a little lemon zing in there its balanced ..the moutfeel is medium but this is just average to me ..its more like a golden bock or pils..it is very drinkable and its ok tasty..ill recommended it as a single..and its one ill drink again..just not one that comes to mind...BTW a little low score on this cause its listed as an APA"
"Edit 8/4/11: This has been on tap at one of my locals with a small number of taps, so I've been drinking fairly regularly the last few weeks. And I've been really enjoying it a lot. I still prefer the Mirror Pond, but I just went and bumped up all the number scores on this beer. Strongly recommended."
"Drinkably smooth, plenty of good drinking here. I prefer this one to Mirror Pond by a good margin. I'm in favor of a hint more body, but realistically that's not a good marketing strategy. Make an IPA this good!"
"Yet another winner by Deschutes. An excellent lighter ale that provides a good alternative for the lager-haters. This should be available year-round."
"Final Notes: A nice summer beer: light and refreshing with a little bit of substance. Could be better, but it's decent."
"Very drinkable, I would consider it sessionable. Another quality offering from Deschutes."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable summer ale that does not seem to quite fit any style. Too light to be an APA (as categorized here), too carbonated and too ""American"" to be an English Bitter (as it has been awarded in the past) - seems to be a hoppy American Blonde. No matter the style, it is very sessionable."
"Springy look and taste. Can't stop picking up a 6 pack. I would rate this a little higher than Deschutes' Mirror Pond although they are very similar. It has a light coppery color with citrus and floral overtones. Fills the senses with its hoppy zing but not overly done."
"Light, crisp, and very easy to drink. This is a good Summer brew. Not my favorite offering from Deschutes, but still quite quaffable."
"Glowing golden orange body. Thin bubbly off white head. Lacing is patchy yet clingy. Nice fresh bouquet of citrusy and orangey hops. A little lemon stands out too. Spritzy mouthfeel. Lively and active. It brings out the rillos nicely. Bright citrus palate is quite refreshing. Some more of that orange vs lemon tug of war. Lemon wins. Nice, flavorful, quenching APA for the summer months."
"Not a bad beer at all. I bought a six of it and have not been disappointed. Enjoy it this summer..."
"Lightbodied mouthfeel, light carbonation. Pretty drinkable and would be a nice refresher on a hot day."
"Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that had some staying power. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Quite a bit of lacing is left on the glass as well. Full of Amarillo hop aroma. Hints of grapefruit, pine resin, and hay. Nothing from the malt. Not really digging the hop flavor in this one. The hops really seem harsh and not just bitter. Leaves a lingering bitterness long after a drink. Again there is not much from the malt. Some people might really like this hop profile, but not this drinker. The body is not as big as I would of liked but carbonation is good and well matched. Not my favorite APA but I do enjoy the low ABV."
" Dry and thirst quenching, could drink many of these"
"Mouthfeel is nice. Not to overly carbonated, easy to drink also. For people who find Sam Adams summer ale to strongly lemony grap hold of Deschutes Brewery Twilight summer ale and enjoy."
"Summer seasonals can sometimes disappoint, trying to be quenching and bland enough to swill between gulps of lake water or gobsfull of BBQ. This beer refreshes without boring. Bold, toasty malt flavor with just the right hop bite. Pours a pleasing amber-orange color with a creamy yellow lumpy head. Not just a knock-off to boost summer sales. I'd drink this any day of the year."
"Drinkability is very good, as a summer beer should be. Very light and refreshing, this would make for a great session beer."
"D- easily among the best of the summer beers, despite the fact it's not a blonde or wheat whatever like most brewers tend to put out"
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. nice foam head diminished rather quickly. Had slight lacing that stayed all the way down the glass. Appearance was a light amber color. The aroma was very nice, earthy and slight pine. I thought the flavor would be more bitter. The taste was very refreshing and not as bitter as I thought would be. I really liked this beer and think it would go very well for a hot summer day, and went well with a snowy day like today."
"pours a nice orange amber color, with a one inch white head that settles to nice blankety film. It smells like summer with fresh oranges, citrus, honey, and a little fresh mowed grass in the background. The smell carries though into the flavor with a little more hops and caramel coming through. Not the most complex beer, but it doesn't need to be. This beer serves it's purpose well, a nice beer to just kick back relax and enjoy the warm weather with."
"All in all this is a good solid beer. Not spectacular, but definetely one of the better brews in its price range. I'll be drinking more of it this summer."
"Drinkability: despite some of its flavor drawbacks, I like the overall presentation. This beer seems like it would be better on a sunny afternoon."
"D - Very drinkable and quite refreshing. Definately fits with the late summer/early fall season."
"Balanced and flavorful, this is a very easy drinking offering from Deschutes. One of the better summertime seasonals I've had lately."
"Drinkability: I like the sweet honey taste in this beer that mixes with the hops. This is a good clean pale ale. I wish I could get it out here and have five or six."
" This may have been the best session beer I had all summer, as I could have easily finished one or two more of these in a sitting. Quite a shame that we don't get Deschutes in this part of the country. Although this beer wasn't true to stylistic form, I'd love to see what else they have to offer!"
"D- I'd enjoy this beer with no problems throughout an afternoon on the patio but it has lots of flavor and makes an excellent beer just to enjoy while watching the hockey game. It's crisp, while retaining a buttery profile, making this a nicely balanced brew!"
"drinkability: awesome beer for a PA"
"D: decent drinkability. Sometimes I get the feeling that I am drinking a heavy pilsner type of beer. This one misses the mark and is a feeble showing for Deschutes. I wish I had not bought a sixer of the stuff. Still, a feeble beer to Deschutes ranks higher than some other brewers mainstays"
"Flavor starts with some toasted bread from the malts on the front of the tongue, which quickly gets overrun from light yeasty fruit notes and citrusy hops. Juicy middle, and a kick of English-ale bitterness rides out for the finish. Very well crafted flavor profile, here. Sits light and crisp on the palate, with a medium-light mouthfeel that goes down smooth and finishes with a fruity burst. Good lord, this stuff is drinkable! An entirely sessionable Pale Ale that would quench any hop-head's thirst."
"M/D: Nicely carbonated and easy to drink, this is quite a session beer. Enjoyable and refreshing, the hop flavor is there, but the bitterness doesn't overwhelm."
"very light and easy to drink. Great for summer. A great session beer."
"D: Very balanced, very flavorful and very drinkable."
"This crisp looking amber beer was poured into a pint glass. The aroma of light hops and coriander greets the nose. The taste though is that of a even crisper dry hops taste with slight malt tones. Overall a good beer to enjoy during the in between time of summer and fall."
"D - Great overall, but not a pale ale. Not an American Pale ale either. Better as a special bitter. Outstanding for a special bitter in fact."
"D-This is amazingly drinkable. I first discovered this while at my favorite B&B (Cricketwood.com in Bend) last summer where it was stocked in the guest fridge. I drank one after another and fell in love with it."
""
"Drinkability: I'm already on bottle number two - halfway through bottle number two, in fact. This is a great warm weather beer. Flavor profile is mild yet tasty, and it's got a light enough body to allow you to drink several (even if it's 100+ degrees outside). Nice job Deschutes! You guys remain #1 in my book."
"Feels thin on the palate but has good flavors. Medium to medium low carbonation."
"Little nose to speak of, but pungent citrus hops with a hint of malty aftertaste rolling off the tongue giving the flavor a unique character. A good session beer, quaffable, but with a little more there to savor."
"D - Highly quaffable, a good summer BBQ beer."
"Other comments: A great seasonal ale with a somewhat understated complexity. The flavor profile changes as you drink it. Going from fruity to quite dry and fairly bitter."
"I could honestly drink this all day and not get tired of it. Plus the 5% alcohol keeps the mind clear and willing to keep downing these tasty numbers. This was one of those ""just what I was looking for beers"" perfect for the situation at hand. Next to Firestone Walker's Pale 31 this is my new go-to 6pk beer this Summer!"
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated, slightly astringent, and dry. The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is medium. This yet another Deshutes beer that is really good. I am glad that I got to drink this beer."
"Poured a golden to orange yellow with a finger of white head, just off from pure white. Nice look. The smell was citrus with a tinge of malt, but mostly citrus. The flavor was mostly citrus hops. Very nice citrus hops. A lot of lemon flavor. Carbonation was nice for this time of year. I had it really cold, and I think that's how it would be best. Enjoyable after a long day of work."
"Overall impression: Good stuff here. More flavorful than your garden variety blonde ale."
"D- Overall this beer is exactly what I expected from researching it. It is an easy drinking pale ale. I would almost say it tastes more like a golden ale actually, but just a tad to dark in color and hoppy to fit in that range. It is ok for what it is and as a golden I would probably rate it higher. But o well. If you like an easy easy drinking grainy pale this is for you."
"- Hugely drinkable.. and would be more so w/ less carbonation.. but overall great ice cold."
"D - Easy to drink easy to appreciate."
"Pours a faint golden orange with a creamy white head that lasts and eventually creates a nice ring on the edges of the glass. Aroma has orange peel, lemon zest and some sweet caramel malts. Flavor is very light with citrus hops and caramel malt. It has a medium body with plenty of carbonation. Definitely a sessionable ale, a bit sweet but I won't hold that against it."
"D: Nice flavors and lighter body make this a good summer beer. Good balance between malts and hops."
"Perhaps one of the most drinkable summer seasonals--and no need to go blonde. Without a doubt, it's one of those seasonals you wish was available year-round--it's currently the benchmark for American session ales. Pair it up with a plate of fried raviolis with a spicy marinara sauce."
"This is a well-balance beer that would be perfect for a session in the summer....why am I drinking it in December?"
"A mediocre APA. Pours the anticipated clear copper with an average white head. Perfumy aroma that captures the beer: light caramel malt with cascade hops, though neither in large quantities. Sweet, light, smooth malt and even wheat flavors with a bit of citrus. Good for a hot summer day, but that's about it."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced. has almost an american wheat feel to it more than an apa. easy going and would make a great session beer."
"Pours a slightly hazed amber, thin white head forms, quickly settles doiwn to a very thin ring and a few bubbles on the surface, no lacing. Smell is nice, lightly fruity, pineapple, grapefruit, bit of bread, not very complex but has a nice sugary backbone. Taste is similar, dry and bready up front, crackery, some sugar coated grapefruit and pineapple in the finish, simple but effective, lightly bitter in the finish and a touch watery. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very refreshing and drinkable. Perfect for sessioning over the summer, real nice stuff. Thanks Dave!"
"Barely hits the radar on all counts. Perhaps a decent stepping stone beer to ween macro drinkers onto micro ales, particularly pale ales, nothing indimidating or truly bad about it, just mostly flavourless."
"Pours clear, or maybe just slightly cloudy, orangish amber with nice white frothy head that leaves decent lace. Aroma is initially floral and citrus hops and gets to be more malty and earthly pretty quickly. Relatively nicely balanced IF with malt and bitter hops coming through. Nice bitter hops aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a lively carbonation but is a little astringent. Pretty drinkable overall, but I prefer their Mirror Pond. This is a little hoppier and makes a good session beer."
"Twilight Ale should be bought in no less than a six pack because you might just go through as many in a session. Deschutes has taken easy drinkability to the max it can go without any compromise on flavour. A solid ale from a great brewery. Thanks fartingdog!"
"D - A good APA. Worth finding, worth enjoying. I will have again if found on tap. Might bring a sixer to a party or something. A nice brew from a stellar brewery."
"A mild APA that is an easy thirst quencher on a warm day with enough to it to be satisfying (though not much more than that)."
"Drinkability - Pretty decent. I mean, I could definitely pack a bunch of these away, and it sure beats a Heineken. That being said, if I saw this in a cooler, I'd probably poke around a second to check out my options."
"D- Easy to drink, just like a beer should be."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Initially quite grainy and dry with a solid zesty hop flavor. There's a touch of malty sweetness in the middle that lingers on until mid-finish, where the hop bitterness takes over and dries things up. Light bodied, crisp, more dry than sweet. Good session material."
"D: One of the weaker offerings from this brewery, but still pretty good. Makes a nice session beer."
"D - Like the name implies, this would be a great beer to enjoy at the end of a summer's day on the back porch. Very drinkable, certainly not the best APA out there, but for $6.50 a six here in Oregon it is hard to complain. Drinking this invokes a vision of sitting by a mountain lake watching a sunset... ah nice"
"Clean finish and very easy drinking."
"Not much to this. Had to try anything Deschutes makes! Small head very little lacing. The nose had a light citrus aroma. The taste has a nice blend of lemon and orange fruit flavors. The malt backbone is lacking a little. But the drinkabilty is good because this beer is LOW in alcohol. This is session beer for people who like good beer. Nothing fancy, maybe you can get your lame freind who drinks water beer to try this and like something with some flavor??"
"Personally, for a seasonal, summer ale, I wouldn't buy another 6 pk. Maybe better to have on a cool summer night to warm you up with the heavier feel to it--hence, twilight?!"
"The aroma was a mild hoppiness with some citrus tones. The taste started out with a good malt profile and then finished with a delicate hop quality with some orange peel. In the mouth is was fairly thin and was nicely carbonated. Overall a good pale ale seasonal in the summer."
"Pours a copper color and has a thin tan head. The nose has mostly hops and a light amount of bready malts. The taste follows suit. I find bitter hops and not too much else. The body is medium to light and heavy on carbonation. Once this settles down, it drinks well and makes a nice session brew."
"Easily drinkable. Won't offend the palate."
"I mean, I'd swig this all day long without complaint, but I'd also be eying about for something better, too."
"Nothing really outstanding going on here, yet it was a pleasing brew which is worth a try. One of the better summer seasonals I've tried."
"Available in a 24-pack during the summer, and also on-tap at their Public house as well as some brewpubs in Portland and Bend."
"Balanced and unique enough to make me buy it every summer.. to really make me like it, it needs more hop flavor and aroma.. and actually a touch more body.. Definately more of a summer beer, than a ""cleaning out the fridge"" beer."
"Thanks again Tayner for the trade"
"Poured a golden yellow color, slight citrus in the taste. The smell is pretty faint, maybe honey and some lemon. This beer is very drinkable and again confirms to me that I cant go wrong with a new Deschutes beer. Very smooth and GOOD!! Really GOOD!!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" eggshell head above the slightly cloudy dark golden brew. Frothy head gradually fades, with plenty of sticking lace. Aroma is lightly sweet, with a vegetal character in the middle, and some pine hoppiness. Taste is citrus tang, over not enough maltiness, with a light pine to close. Mouthfeel is pretty good, and drinkability is alright. The vegetal and citrus kind of push me away here, but your mileage may vary."
"I do beleive this beer should be ranked higher. It pours a great yellow color. The nose is of fresh cascade hops and fresh cut grass and straw. The taste is a unique verry spring summery flavor with a great finish and a very floral aftertaste yet still quite different than the mirror pond. good summer ale. very chuggable."
"UPDATE 4/25/10: Enjoyed a pint on cask at the PDX brewpub and the beer was fantastic. Far richer in flavor that the bottles I've tried. Really a good session beer on cask."
"Drinkability: An OK beer, but it lacks standout character that would make it memorable."
"Drinkability is perfect. I could sit on my porch in the hot summer and drink six of these with no problem. This also would be the perfect brew for someone just starting out on craft beer."
"This is an easy drinking beer, plenty of flavor, very nice mouthfeel, I am not pleased with the primary flavors - well made beer that doesn't quite hit the flavor for me."
"Very pleasant smell from this beer, floral and hoppy. Appearance is very light, clear straw yellow. Taste is just alright, nothing terrifyingly spectacular. That said, it is not a bad beer by any means, I would purchase again for a party perhaps, but probably not for my own enjoyment. As far as deschutes goes, I would stick with mirror pond."
"I expected a bit more from this one; one of the weaker offerings from Deschutes. Not a bad beer, but not a great one. More like an english bitter maybe, than a pale ale. Not a lot of hop flavor, not much aroma, but feels good on the palate and leaves a bitter aspirin aftertaste. Given a choice, I'd take Mirror Pond anytime."
"Drinkability: The balance helps out with this, but it's fairly weak in all other respects. I have to get through a six pack, or give it away, but I won't be purchasing this again. Maybe it was my mistake for picking this up in october, but it tastes plenty fresh to me anyway, and shouldn't have aged considerably."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light. Moderate carbonation and clean, dry finish. Pretty easy to down! There isn't anything really outstanding about this beer, but it's very pleasing. I'll look for this again next year."
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a small white head. Aromas that are caramel malty, yet faint. In the taste, a mellow maltiness and a dry end. A very smooth mouthfeel and a small dry malty aftertaste, but very clean. A nice ale, very balanced with a small dryness."
"This ""summer ale"" from Deschutes poured a hazy orange-gold, with a nice initial off-white head that faded fairly quickly without leaving much on the glass. The aromas were very subtle for an APA -- light fruit, an earthyness, and that's about it. Delicious and well-balanced as I've come to expect from this brewery -- an interesting blend of malts and hops, though I'd be hard-pressed to pick out what's what -- some toasty caramel, nectarine. Interesting mouthfeel -- it doesn't seem very carbonated, but it gets a good tingle on the tongue, and then it dries up nicely. A pretty complex beer that's drinkable enough for a warm day, though I definitely agree with the reviewer that wrote that this would be equally welcome on a cold night. Overall, though, I definitely prefer Deschutes' Mirror Pond."
"An OK beer but I have better on a regular basis. Worth a try."
"Having half my family now living in Oregon, I first tried this American Pale Ale a few years ago during a 4th of July excursion and have made a habit of bringing home a few cases on subsequent visits. That is to say, I enjoy it quite so, as a lively summer kick. Standing golden in its glass as afternoon sunshine, with a bright white head reducing to a thin light lace, fresh and fruity fragrances touch the nose. The hops, they won't kick you in the face, but you'll definitely know they're there. Moderately carbonated with a crisp volley and a slightly bitter finish... I'd recommend it to ya, suited 'specially for those outdoor leisures during a summer's 'noon, but just as home in front of a winter's fire with some food and friends of choice."
"Pours a hazy yellow/orange color, what little head there is settles fairly quickly. Some flowery hop notes, but not much else. Taste is nice and malty sweet, some hints of citrus. Mouthfeel is great, smooth, not overly thick, not much aftertaste. Leaves your mouth nice and moist. Drinkability is quite good due to the combination of nice flavor and low abv. Pick up a sixer of this and enjoy it while it lasts."
"Thin and lacking any carbonation. Nice taste however. A backbone of malt and light floral hops with just not much else going on."
"Could drink a whole lot of these, very light and tasty"
"Appearance is a light golden brown with a nice head and lacing. Smell: light sweet malt, and fruit, citrus and hops. Taste has a light citrus sweetness that is balanced well with the hops giving it a light bite. Mouthfeel is medium - light with good body. To me this is one tasty beer without being overpowering that I could easily enjoy this as a session."
"Drinkability: Easily a session beer that is very enjoyable."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable and quaffable."
"Had a couple of pints at the Hilton in Seattle. Nice medium gold color with a decent head that laced down the glass. Not much aroma, but a nice fresh burst of flavor-smooth malt with a decent hop bite that tingled on the aftertaste. Ample bodied but light enough to be an ideal summer quaffer. A pretty straight forward enjoyable ale."
"D: Won't buy again, wasn't completely put off, but not one of Deschutes better brews."
"Not a whole lot to say about this beer - it's simple and quite good. Nowhere near as strong in taste as most microbrews these days, but to great effect on a hot day. Solid, real ale taste with no lingering demons on the palate or in the head. Have three."
"Pours a clear golden color with a finger of head that sticks around. Little lacing. Very little smells. A hint of hops, maybe some lemon or orange. Taste is very bland. A tiny bit of hops, slight honey but very watery with some carbonation. This is extremely drinkable and is very refreshing for a thirst or hot day but is not a conversation piece. Good for what it supposed to be."
"The taste was of a pine flavor hop with a bitter tart finish. Not what a whole lot of flavor here. This may be good on hot summer days for a quincher, but not an ale to sit and enjoy with a friend or two or three, etc. Glad I only bought one bottle at their Alehouse in Bend."
"Overall: nice pale ale, but the sweet finish is a bit much"
"D- It is a good session beer but nothing out of the ordinary. I'm not sure if I would buy it again but I wouldn't mind sitting around and having a few."
"Golden yellow color, slight citrus in the taste, very sessionable beer, I crushed four of these the first night I bought the sixer and the other two the next day. The smell is pretty faint, maybe honey and some lemon. This beer is very drinkable and again confirms to me that I cant go wrong with a new Deschutes beer."
"A clean finish gets rid of the malt residue and provides nice drinkability. Good for muggy summer nights."
"Poured a hazy straw color. The smell is mostly earthy earthy hops, hay-like. There is a medium bitterness that comes through at the start, but you get a lot of earthy taste overwhelming everything else. As much as I wanted to like this beer I couldn't. I was really looking forward to this summer style refreshing hoppy beer but I couldn't get myself to dig the flavors going on here."
"I'm not sure what market niche this beer is supposed to fill. It's not significantly different from the Mirror Pond Pale Ale, at least not enough for me to tell without doing a side-by-side comparison."
"The beer poured out a nice orangey-golden color with a thin long-lasting golden colored, flimy head. Very effervescent and some lacing. The smell isn't strong or complex - the most I can smell is a hint of mild yeast smell. However, the taste was surprisingly much stronger and more complex, with a blend of hops and citrus. Very drinkable, especially when it's cold - a great Summer Beer candidate for a hot Oregon day."
"D - A highly quaffable session ale. Not a big beer, one made for easy drinkiing. I enjoyed it and consider it above average in this respect. Tastes like a touch of wheat or rye in the malt. An interesting everyday kind of brew."
"Drinkability is good. Not a great beer, but it's refreshing, and is a nice summer sipper."
"From the very first sight and smell of this beer you can tell its not a typical summer seasonal brew. Nice golden color with good 2 finger head that leaves traces of lace and stays around for a while. Unlike most ""summer beers"" this has a strong hoppy smell. Taste is good, right on for a pale ale, nice hop flavoring but not overpowering. Low carbonation and light mouthfeel makes this a highly drinkable beer. I dont see so much it being a seasonal brew as I think this could hold its own any season."
"Drinkability- This is a nice beer with a great full flavor but its definitely not heavy. Makes for a great drinkin summer beer. This is one of the tastier beers Ive had from Deschutes."
"This one has enough to satisfy but still really easy drink. Nothing remarkable, but a good choice for brining to a bbq or party with both beer geeks and marcro drinkers."
"Drinkability is high...wish I had more. Thanks to Wasatch."
" This one is a couple months after best by and poured a light golden/orange color with a large white head that leave some spots of lacing around the glass. Smell has some fruit notes to it. Taste has a bit of a hop bite with flavors of citrus peels. Mouth feel is a little on the light side almost watery. This brew is very easy to drink and is thirst quenching. I would like to try this one fresher when released next summer."
"An average APA, and one that would be worth trying again fresh."
"Drinkability: Not what I typically look for in an APA but for a summer beer this has some real merit"
"Pours a cloudy golden color, nice carbonation, not much of a head, nice little islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. Scents of hops, slight malts, and citrus. Taste of hops, not much bitterness, ends with a dry finish. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad APA, but it could have more hops and bitterness to give it a little bit more punch, would recommend though."
"Overall, quite drinkable. Nicely refreshing and quite an interesting taste that is nicely balanced."
"D: Boring beer if you ask me. Nothing undesirable but there are a lot better things on the market."
"Overall, an excellent session beer. Hops are a touch lighter than I like, but taste is quite full."
"Mouthfeel is md-light with moderate carbonation that forms a momentary rise in carb sting that serves to wash away the malt sweet. Leave a tingy dry apricto as an aftertaste."
"thanks goes to kenb for sending me this out of the goodness of his heartwhen I had a trede go bad with blake.poured a nice honey color with a off white head. aroma, wow the hops were right out there followed by a nice sweetness, than the malts, orange zest. flavor this did not disappoint me the hops and malts came out nice, nice citrus with a mild bitterness. nice amd clean finish. had this after painting most of the day very refreshing"
"D- good easy drinking summer brew, malty balance with a nice hop profile blending into the background. I'd enjoy another. I do have to say that this really would only make a good seaonal brew, it just wouldnt have a place for the rest of the year."
"Pours golden pushing towards amber in color. I think they were shooting for the color of the name and did a good job. Not a big head but some lacing. Sweet upfront with a hop backer. Evokes citrus, maybe lime, maybe lemon. Not much aroma. Very easy to drink. One of my favorites for the summer seasonals this year."
"Nothing brilliant and lacks a little balance, but refreshing none-the-less."
"D: This is a fairly unbalanced beer, but still pretty good. It had a very good sweetnes, that I love in Pale Ales, and if the hops were a little bit stronger this would be excellent. It reminds me of a less hoppy version of Mirror Pond. I can see myself getting this a couple more times before summer is over."
"($5.99 / 6-pack)"
"This is an under-rated APA. Nice dark goldish color, with a near white head. Nice thick head, good retention. Floral cascade hops and grain make up the aroma. A little light on hops, but decent malt character. Traces of various grains can be tasted. A little light bodied but still feels good, thanks to ABV and carbonation. Very drinkable although slightly lacking in flavor. An overall good beer, however I would recommend the Mirror Pond APA (also from Deschutes)."
"The appearance is golden with a 1/4 inch white head. The nose has piney hops and bread grains. This beer straddles the line between a pale ale and a blonde ale. There's almost no malt backbone, but there is some piney and herbal hop bitterness. It's a good summer seasonal, although you have to admit, most summer seasonals tend to be light and easy drinking, rather than flavorful and exciting."
"Drinkability: excellent refreshing summer beer. Worth trying this one."
"Nice light copper color, decent head. Citrus hops, a spicy nose. Tastes of citrus, honey, sweet and malty but with a clean hops finish. Decent mouthfeel, nothing special for an APA, but light and flavorful, leading to great drinkability. Nice APA - I'm not a huge hophead, but this is a great summer thirst-quencher."
"This is an excellent Pale ale. It doesn't try and be the king of hoppy pales but rather kicks in with some fruity, citrusy, hops and lets it mold with the ingredients. It litterally melts in my mouth and makes me want more and more. Another winner from deschutes."
"D: Very easy to drink, especially as a summer seasonal. Definitely session beer-worthy."
"The taste is hoppy; notes of grapefruit, lime and grass dominate the palate with just a bit of malt sweetness in the background and...the finish is quite dry and crisp.. Hmmm...this one's quite the tasty APA and the drinkability factor is definitely there with its low ABV. Another summer thirst quencher found for sure. ;^)"
"Drinks too easy. A pretty solid APA, nothing too memorable. Not bad at all though"
" Palate strikes a nice balance between assertive floral hops and mellow malt, with some light citrus and a hint of coriander in the background. Body is well-carbonated and fairly light, great for warm-weather drinking. A truly refreshing beer, and an interesting switchup from the year-round offering of Mirror Pond. I'll probably be drinking a lot of this beer in the coming months."
"Quite light on the palate, and pretty dry as well. This has a lightly spicy, yet herbal hoppiness to it that is the dominant flavor. The malt character is quite thin, and actually does not do a very good job of balancing the hop notes. Finishes with a biting bitterness. Overall this just seems out of whack; the hop notes are jarring, astringent and too much for the malt notes to handle. Definitely the worst beer from this brewery that I have had, but it is still drinkable and has no real flaws (other than being out of balance)."
"Beer pours a medium amber color with a small had and just a little bit of lacing. Smell was just decent. I could pick up some floral hoppy bitterness and a light amount of malts, but that's about it. Taste, is very good and I was very surprised that there would be as much of a disconnect between the nose and the taste. It starts out with a floral hoppiness, and transitions smoothly into a burnt malt bitterness and then finishes a little sweet. Very nice. Mouthfeel and drinkablity are also good as well. Nice summertime brew here."
"This is a very drinkable beer, especially for a summer seasonal. Its a nice light refreshing beer, with a pungent aroma and acceptable taste. I like Twlight better than the Deschutes year-round pale ale offering (Mirror Pond) , and I wish Twilight were a year-round offering as well. I will definitely have more Twilight, especially in the evening, before the summer is out."
"Drinkability: This is a great seasonal pale ale. Comparing it to it's brother Mirror Pond, it is right up there but less floral and less complex. This may be a good thing if you're not in the mood for something super flavorful. Appropriately, it's a good pale ale for hot summer days."
"I really enjoy this beer a lot and have bought it again and again."
"The aroma is the peak experience. Still I recommend seeking this beer out as it is rare to have such fine balance with excellent complexity."
"A great summer beer. Highly recommended."
"Pours a deep golden color with mimimal head that does retain nicely. Nose is kind of malty but mostly non-descript. Taste is a nice balance of malts and hops-nice hop finish. Packs more of a punch than expected from a summer seasonal. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full and bit creamy. This is an excellent summer session beer...nothing less expected from Deschutes!"
"Overall impression: One of my new favorite summer seasonals!"
"Seems more carbonated and tangy than the two regular Deschutes pale ales (Mirror Pond and Cascade). Doesn't have the raisin flavour of Mirror Pond but does hint at black tea, and doesn't seem as hoppy as either of its counterparts, although I notice a metallic hoppy flavour in my mouth well after I had thought the aftertaste was over. This is a more mellow understated brew for kicking back and relaxing on the porch. A few of these would slide down well for a hearty summer session."
"Conclusion: Not a beer for cold winter nights or when craving serious hops, but very pleasing for hot summer days. Try it in a frozen mug or pint glass."
"Now this mes amis is how you make a summer seasonal; big bold and full of hops. Now I like this beer because it reminds me of Sam Adams Lager crossed with SNPA. Lots of hops on the nose and the palate with that classic balance on the finish. I wish this beer was available year round."
"Golden orange yellow that's not quite clear, topped by a finger of tightly-packed, off-white bubbles. Juicy hops on the nose. Light citrus, mostly orange, tones mix with sap. Biscuity and lightly sweet malt to boot. Taste features light, crisp malt up front--slightly buttery and sweetbreadish (shortbread cookies?). Juicy, citrusy hops follow. More orange and tangerine than grapefruit. Bitterness is moderate, but overwhelms the malt in the finish. Light-medium body, with a dry finish. Light and refreshing pale ale, and another great beer from Deschutes."
"Drinkability- Not well balanced. Almost like a carbonated water that is going flat with a touch of hops thrown in. Pass...."
"Not a bad summer offering that is quite drinkable, but a bit disappointed with the slight lack of hops. Throw in a bit more hops and possibly darken the color a bit."
"Smell is of wheat, grass, some floral notes as well. First taste is very mild, a little hop bitterness to start, but this gives way to a subtle and pleasant malt background. Very light body with a creamy quality a perhaps just a tad too much CO2. This gets better as it warms, more suble textures, reminiscent of the smell of a spring day. Extremely drinkable, I could easily drink this all day. This was brewed to be light-bodied and highly drinkable, and that's exactly what it is. This is one of the better summer seasonals I've had, and would make a fantastic sessioner."
"Light-medium bodied, coating. Lighter pale ale, good for the hot weather (as was their aim)."
"As Twilight warms (Deschutes consistently serves their beers too cold) a light malty sweetness unfolds in the taste and aroma. There's not much else to say about this beer. It is gentle and fair enough though rather routine."
"Refreshing and easy drinking, this would be good medicine for those with heavy exposure to Macro piss waters."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head along with floaties. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful malt complexity that balances well with the floral hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a very smooth malt palate that is slightly sweet and boasts of pale, carapils, and light crystal malts. The hop bitterness is mild. It balances near perfect. It goes down easy and finishes a bit fruity in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is outstanding. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good American pale ale. It has excellent flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"This is a good beer for the season, almost sitting on the heavier side of things."
"Needless to say, its a decent summer beer, but really adds nothing to Deschutes formidable line."
"Notes: There's nothing obtrusive about this beer, nor is there anything that makes it anything more than average. That said, it's a pretty decent APA and a smooth drinking session beer."
"I was very interested in tryingthis one when I first saw it out in the 12-packs. Finally got a hold of a single and was happy I didn't pay for the whole 12 pack."
"Twilight Ale is a lip smackin' good summer brew and is superior to Deschutes's year-round APA, Mirror Pond Pale Ale. Hopilicious and supremely quaffable, this is a beer to seek out and consume in quantity. Easily my new favorite beer from a quality Oregon brewery."
"To please me, they could go hoppier, but, eh, there's more than me out there, ain't there. This is just right for what it is."
"Very subdued for a Deschutes product...but then again, it is a Summer Ale."
"Light bodied, but not too light. This is an excellent variation on the style, and I hope this becomes a regular summer brew from Deschutes. I could drink lots of these with few problems, besides the ones I started with!"
"A nice break from your normal PacNW pale ale this was. Not everyday malt takes center stage in on of these beers. Hops do their thing as far as taste goes, but bitterness is relaxed. Crisp and clean. I'll be picking this on up again for sure!"
"The beer burst forth from the 12-ounce brown bottle a cloudless golden color with a semi-creamy white head that is modest in size and as it dissolves, the lace forms a thick and clinging sheet upon the glass. Nose is malt dominated with a slight hint of hops, lime like in its crispness, fresh and pleasing to the nose and the eyes, start is delightfully malted and slightly sweet with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is moderate in its acidity, the hops delectable in their spicy presence, very dry and lingering aftertaste, and a nice beer and really hits the spot."
"Not a bad pale for the summer, give it a try."
"ng"
"Thanks Jason!"
"This is easily Deschutes' worst beer. They already make 3 pale ale type beers (Mirror Pond, Bachelor, and Cascade which is a much better light summer thirst quencher than Twilight anyday), so there is absolutely no need for this beer. The real tragedy is that Twilight bumps Pine Mountain Pils out of the line-up, a very well-liked beer and one of a disgracefully small number of American micro pilsners. Bad move Deschutes. Bring back the Pils -- seriously. Actually I'm guessing most casual beer drinkers will not find anything too objectionable about this beer, and it seems to be an immediate hit, but its shortcomings are noticeable to those who are paying attention. I will not buy this beer again, although I guess if I see it on tap I'll give it a whirl. A disappointment, and a real bummer; dare I say, a disgrace."
"Must say this is an OK beer but its bad in comparison to one of the few good pilsners ever to come out of Oregon..bring back the Pine Mountain Pils next year ..PLEASE"
"Deschutes Twilight Ale, summer 2004, had a transluscent light straw color capped by short-lived quarter inch white head. There was some streaky lace.The pleasant citrusy aroma was predominently grapefruity. The taste was sharp and grapefruity with a good hop bite tempered by some malt sweetness. The finish was slightly dry and citrusy. Overall it was flavorful, but not overpowering, and definately thirst quenching. Just what a summer beer should be."
"Twilight Ale was served from the tap in an imperial pint glass at the Deschutes Public House in Bend. The beer was a slightly hazy rich orange-golden straw color, and was topped by a sticky white head that left thin sticky sheets of lacing. The nose presented a bright and citric-resiny hop bouquet and a complementary light crisp maltiness. On the palate, a crisp, clean, and subtlly complex malt profile with some crackery pilsner qualities opened and was followed by a citric-zest transition to a crisp and clean, moderately bittered, bisquity finish. The medium-light body worked very well with the flavors and summer character of this crafty and original brew. Twilight ale drinks very well, and is crisp and refreshing, yet is solid, balanced, full flavored, and satisfying...making it the summer seasonal of choice for me."
"Drinkability  Great summer seasonal that went down quickly."
"Good solid summer brew from deschutes. Pours a light orange/amber with a decent ivory white head that stays in size throughout. Lacing is minimal as you drink. The smell is of a summer garden, mint and berries tingle the nose. A slight hint of caramel malts, very clean to the nose. The taste is of sweet malt with a wet buttery puck to the tongue. Hop presence is light but there, a nice crisp medium bodied summer ale. Like the bottle says these are perfect for sitting on the porch after that hot summer day."
