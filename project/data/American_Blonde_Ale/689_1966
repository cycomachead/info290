4.17,19.8,4,4.5,4.25,3.5,4,"I was concerned that the beer was two months past its ""Best By"" date and so I employed a very gentle pour which resulted in just a skim of wisps in lieu of head. No problem as I then used the servers' trick and agitated it into producing a finger of foamy, eggshell-white head with good retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow (SRM = 4 -5) with NE-quality clarity and my old friends, Mammon, Croesus and Midas returned for a taste. I leaned in for a sniff and was rewarded with an odor like honey-lemon tea! No joke, the Saaz hops interacted really well with the Belgian malt to create a very mellow smell. I have been fighting a bad head cold of late and this seememed like just what the doctor ordered. My first draught was very tea-like, slightly thin on the tongue in terms of mouthfeel, but very much like drinking honey-lemon tea. I would have probably identified it as a Czech Pils or another type of lager, had they not identified it on the label as an ale. Finish was semi-dry and mellow to the point that I was driven to have a bit of a lie-down. Oh my.","woodychandler","Feb 10, 2014"

1.92,-44.8,2,2.5,1.5,2,2,"Didn't know quite what to expect from this beer, but being a fan of Two Brothers, I figured it was worth investigating. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. Pours a transparent gold color with a meager head that is soon gone. Smell is faint, but what's there is not all that appealing. Flavor leans toward the hoppy end of the spectrum with a wheat aftertaste (reminiscent of Bud Light Golden Wheat, to be honest). Overall, a pretty thin beer with little working for it in any regard. Two Brothers have far better brews than this.","MaximalC","Jan 30, 2012"

The appearance is clear golden color with very thin white (almost non-exisitent) head that appears to be trying to lace. The smell has very subtle citrus (lemonny) notes....not much else. The taste is a little bitter due to the citrus twang...not much grain or malt....I am guessing rye is used to give the beer a dryness and ability to clear the pallet except for the lemon sourness that hangs on. Mouthfeel is ok, I think the bitterness/tartness from the lingering pallet grasp of the citrus make this beer a bit dodgy.

The taste follows pretty closely, though the pepper comes through a bit more, and some lemongrass joins the party as well.

There is the slightest hint of euro smell/taste to it. The mouthfeel is dry and slick. Overall this is very refreshing but complex. As the label states ""looks simple but tastes complex"".

Head fades pretty quickly down an uneven layer of bubbles, although with lots of white lacing. Aroma is minimal, some pale malt and effervescence. Taste is light pale sweetness, countered and overcome by rounded bitterness that dominates the rest, on through the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, although the bitter is more dominating thatn I would want, and drinkability is acceptable. Nothing much I would strive to revisit here.","ppoitras","Jan 31, 2006"

2.53,-27.3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Clear amber gold with a slight tawny highlight, the color is a little deeper than insipid. That might not sound like much of a compliment but it is a lovely color. The head didnt form that impressively, at the apex the foam was still less than one finger in height and it quickly faded to a soapy cap. This aspect of the beer is not impressive. There was no subsequent lacing, aside from a speckle or two. It is uninspiring to look at. The nose is buttery with a kiss of popcorn. Floral hops at the back, some herbal spiciness. Disinterested malts. The nose doesnt explain anything to me. The label says Golden Ale, BA says APA, RB says A Belgian Ale (WTF does that mean!). Two Brothers Website says, Prairie Path Ale is a Belgian-style golden ale. Prairie Path Ale is a full flavored, slightly bitter, clean and refreshing ale. The Belgian malts along with the Saaz and Goldings hops give this beer great drinkability. Is this suppose to be like Duvel? They cant be serious. To me this beer smells more like an English Pale Ale. Whatever it is I dont find the aroma inviting. The first sip is boring. The second sip is buttered popcorn. The third sip is heavy with the residue of the second sip but some new flavors emerge like weak bitterness and some flowery vibes. Two Brothers thinks this beer is Belgian in nature? You got to be kidding me. First of all it is way to clean, it is also too English, and too damn simplistic for me to care. Where are the Saaz and Goldings hops? They are not offering any bitterness of note and little in the way of flavor. Either my definition of Golden Ale is wrong or this beer is just off. I really dont understand what is going on. Lets say, for the sake of argument, I completely ignore style guidelines and just go by taste. This beer doesnt taste good. I dont care for it. Boring with too significant flavors of popcorn. Blah. Medium-light in body, watery on the tongue, the carbonation is low and this only hurts the situation. This beer is not drinkable or enjoyable or anything Id suggest you try. It will take some serious convincing to get me to try this beer again. I purchased this bottle in Iowa City, IA. Not good.","bditty187","Nov 19, 2004"

3.53,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Prairie Path pours a crystal clear golden body beneath an average-sized head of bright white foam. The head retention is quite good, and it leaves some very nice lace at the outset of the glass. The nose delivers a combination of yeast fruitiness, floral and grassy hops, and lightly grainy (and perhaps subtly toasty) malt. The body is medium/light and it's crisp carbonation tingles the palate. The flavor is as might be expected based on the nose, with a bit more graininess to the malt and more floral, herbal and spicy hops than are already suggested. It's anchored by a firm bitterness, and what sweet malt is there at the start fades to a dry finish that lingers with some swirling hop flavors (floral, spicy, grassy). It's an interesting and refreshing beer, but it still remains fairly basic in character overall. Still, it's a nice summer beer to enjoy at the end of a long day as the sun goes down.","NeroFiddled","Apr 05, 2004"

A bit of hops in the aroma too, but nothing special. A solid swigger here....easy to drink, pleasantly mild on the palate, perfect carbonation level.

It probably contains the most bitterness I've encountered in such an ale.  I like it though.  The spicy Saaz notes really make an impression.  This beer is almost like a pilsner ""ale style.""
