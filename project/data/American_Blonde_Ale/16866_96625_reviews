"They really did nail it. Probably the best non-dark spiced beer I've ever had. Well integrated and nothing artificial about the flavors. The mouth feel is velvety, lending itself well to the vanilla. Makes me want to try White Chocolate."
"The smell is kind of awful. I don't know what I'm about to get when I stick it under my nose, but then I taste it and BAM, there's the cinnamon, rice, and vanilla that you know is horchata! Is it the best beer ever, maybe not, but did they nail what it's supposed to be? Yes."

"I adore this beer. The smell and taste are delicious, and they absolutely nailed it. One sip and I feel like I'm at a taqueria on a hot summer day, drinking Horchata on ice out of a plastic cup with a faint dusting of cinnamon on top. I can't get enough of this."

"Smells like your average lager with a hint of cinnamon. Tastes rich and creamy with tasty cinnamon accents. Spot on. Delicious."

"Lots of vanilla and cinnamon in this beer. Flavor is very different, but not bad. Would go nice with a spiced desert."

"O - Such a fun, easy drinking beer. The Bruery knows how to make an odd mix of ingredients come together and be a pleasure to drink."

"My buddies didn't like it as much as me. Very sweet. Definitely a sipper."

"Or xata pours a nice yellow beer. Foamy. Smells a bit to some yeast and vegetables. Taste sweet."

"O: This isn't offensive, but I don't find it particularly drinkable. I think a three-ounce taster would have been enough to see that it's a beer with some interesting flavors, and then been done with it. In the end, I couldn't make it through even my half-bottle pour before sharing it with the drain. Just too sweet and not enough complexity to make it worth pushing through."

"Overall an interesting and cool achievement by the bruery. A blond ale? No. But a cool drink? Definitely. It is refreshing and nice especially when the weather is getting hotter."

"Great scent of horchata with a big vanilla nose. Golden body that drinks quite smooth. There is a sweet bite at the beginning for me. The vanilla really takes over but you get a roundness from the rice. I'm not getting a ton of cinnamon which might add a little more depth. Really fun to try, but quite sweet."
""
""
""
"O: This beer hit the marks they were going for and I'm sure fresh the vanilla was much more apparent. Very well crafted and very well done. I don't know if we'll be seeing this one again but I wouldn't be opposed to it."
""
"O- I'm not a huge fan of blonde ales however Or Xata does not taste anything like a typical blonde ale and is extremely unique nailing what they are going for. The aroma was way too sweet and unbalanced with too much cinnamon and sweet vanilla bean. However the taste (in my opinion) was as spot on as it could be with nice vanilla bean qualities balanced with a pinch of cinnamon and rice pudding. Overall if you love rice pudding and unique beers I'd definitely check this beer out, if you don't I'd probably stay away."

"Overall - Having had two Or Xata beers, I can safely say I don't think I would enjoy the title beverage."

" The taste is unusual but good, pretty interesting considering the origin of the idea, I have made horchata and shared with others who enjoy this specialty and it is not exactly what you would expect- I think the flavor of the alcohol is what seems to distract from the drink it pays tribute to. I understand the brewer who created this is not known for low alcohol versions of any style, but to me the spice is the best part of the taste a little less rice tangy-ness may have helped. I think this is pretty decent for what it is, but to me it missed the mark if Horchata or Or xata is what they wanted to pay tribute to. I think for a first taste of anything remotely similar to the original beverage it is better than average. Thanks again Adam, so glad I got to try this!"

"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a very mild amount of carbonation. Having never had the drink that is the inspiration for this brew, I dont know how to grade this. I will say though that this pretty much drinks exactly as advertised with the listed ingredients. Quite unique and worth a try. I just have a difficult time scoring this since it is unlike anything ive had before and really just isnt beer-like in any way."

"Poured into Bruery snifter. Appearance is clear gold with minimal head and no lacing. The nose is very sweet. Notes of brown sugar, cinnamon, and caramel come first followed by heavy vanilla character. Taste is super sweet up front with notes of burnt sugar, mild cinnamon, sweet cream, and caramel. The flavor is reminiscent of horchata, but I'd say this beer comes off a few degrees more sweet than most horchatas. Mouthfeel is bordering on syrupy with moderate carbonation. Overall, the Bruery did a good job of translating the delicious Mexican beverage into beer form. The resulting beer is very sweet and serves as more of a dessert drink than anything else."

"Pours medium dark amber. Fairly cloudy but pretty far from opaquely so. Small to medium off white head, mostly dies off after a minute or two. The aroma is heavy on vanilla and ground rice. The cinnamon provides some depth and spice, as with the beer's inspiration. It smells about as close to Mexican-style horchata as I can imagine for a beer. A relatively mild boozy note. Smells a little syrupy, though less maple and more agave or simple syrupy. The taste is somewhat sweet with a lot of that same vanilla rice flavor. It's rich but also somewhat cloying. Lots of funny sweetness in the finish with a light boozy note. It's not altogether heavy on the palate but it is rather heavy for the abv. I would guess that this beer would be a mess at ~10% abv. It's an interesting beverage, and I applaud the effort, but it's not altogether pleasant to drink. It's like boozy horchata, which isn't something that I particularly like, I guess. Improves as it warms, but still, I would have preferred to split this one with a group and just get a taster's worth."

"Quarter finger head on a hazy copper body with nice lacing. Aroma is a bit light but what's there is nice with gingerbread, cinnamon rum, vanilla, caramel and butterscotch. The flavor follows with a stronger presence which for me is a little too unbalanced and sweet with again butterscotch, vanilla, rum, toffee and caramel with light malt presence. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This one isn't bad but it doesn't really appeal to my beer tastes. That being said you can still tell its a well brewed beer."

"O: Not perfect but I can definitely see what they were going for. Creamy and delicious for dessert."
""

"The beer is copper hued with ruby highlights. An inch or so of off white head with plenty of staying power. The aroma offers a huge dose of sweet vanilla, cinnamon, butterscotch candies, booze. Smells as advertised - like an alcoholic horchata. Overly sweet and cloying. A fun idea, but the sweetness combined with alcohol is just too much."

"Luckily, this paired amazingly well with spicy food, as any great dessert wine does - the sweetness would cut the spiciness and leave behind a playful and warm, toasty caramel and honey finish that made it fabulous for the occasion. Definitely not recommended on its own unless you enjoy the sensation of slowly acquiring diabetes, and far better paired with either spicy Mexican or Thai food. I heard from an acquaintance that this fell off in quality about a month in - and I can tell. This does remind me of a rather sweet, shake-like horchata I had in SD earlier this year. Otherwise, it's definitely not the most practical offering but it definitely was worth trying."
"o - Overall a very interesting beer that smells and tastes good, in small quantities, and I imagine is exactly what they were going for. If I had a 2 oz. pour of this is at a festival, or a 4oz. pour as part of a flight, I could find myself really liking this one even more, but trying to take down half a bottle got a little rough on the back end of the glass, as it is very sweet. Worth checking out, and goes well with Mexican food, but share the bottle with 3-4 other people."

"O - Sweet, but great flavors. A truly unique beer, fun stuff."

"O: My wife being Mexican and loving horchata was skeptical but we tried and liked it. Not my cup of tea but not a bad beer. I especially liked the cinnamon."

"Overall: Let's just say that my girlfriend hates the IPAs and imperial syrups I normally drink, and she told me, ""I'd buy this to drink for myself."" She was pretty sad when I told her they'd probably only ever brew this once. If you enjoy horchata, you will enjoy this brew."

"Pours a clear gold with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, vanilla, cinnamon, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with vanilla, cinnamon, and horchata flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium body mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is more horchata like in the taste versus the smell."

"This beer is creamy, smooth and tastes just like horchata. Has little to no head at the top and leaves no lacing on the glass. Great with mexican food. If you have a chance to grab one of these you should try it. One of my favorite beers"
""
"Brilliant. Horchata + carbonation + 7% alcohol. This may be my new favorite beer - it needs to be in a bottle more often. This beer is like a cream soda, an horchata, and a ""butter beer"" from Potter-verse all in one. Do yourself a favor and try it!"

"Overall, ehhhh, I want to like this, it has the flavors you'd expect, but for me who doesn't eat or drink anything sweet, it's hard to get through more than a sip or two. However, this with dessert, or mixed in ice cream or pancakes yum."
"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer, it would be a chore to get through a whole bottle though. Still, very well executed take on the cultural beverage."
"This is really good. And goes down super easily. I finished a whole bottle in less than a half hour like it was nothing (and felt the subsequent buzz). A slightly different beer- I'd almost say it's like a blonde version of a gingerbread stout. Worth a try for sure."
""

"Overall, while I don't love Horchata, this beer is right on the money. They made Horchata into a beer! The bottle calls this a blonde beer, but it is what it is. Great experimental brew (odd, but tasty)."
""
""
""
"This beer really does what it sets out to accomplish, and drinks exactly like an alcoholic horchata. This is an even better option to pair with Mexican food, as well as being a great summertime beer. I'd love to have a 4 pack of tallboys for a day at the beach."

"A really delicious American experimental ale, and I think The Bruery pulled off exactly what they intended with this one. Looking forward to pairing my next bottle with carne asada nachos...because, why not?"
