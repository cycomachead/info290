"wow. very refreshing! better than I expected. I mean, it's Widmer, ya know? low abv, but refreshing. I wonder how it would go down on a hot lawnmower Saturday afternoon?"
""
""
"OVERALL: I will return to this beer.I was caught off-guard by its balance and flavour."
""
""
""
"A good summer beer. Tropical, tangerine fruity aroma and flavor, with light malt: Sweet, bready. The aroma is really nice. Sweet orange malt and moderately bitter pine/grapefruit peel flavor. A very nice beer. A beer I would love to have again. Recommend this highly."
""
""
""
""
"Pouring a deeper, slightly cloudy gold, it has a short-lasting fizzy white head. A miniscule amount hangs on and leaves some lacing. The aroma is almost non-existent with a slight funky earthy hops and malt sweetness to it. The taste is little more complex than the aroma. There is a light hint more robust malt on the finish I can't quite identify. The body is a little watery and thin. It's definitely an easy drinker but it just hasn't have much oomph behind it in the flavor department."
""
"O: refreshing and well balance, although I would have preferred more citra flavor;"
""
""
""
"Overall- Very refreshing summer beer. Perfect for a hot day. Nothing over the top but a very well balanced beer that does its job perfectly."

"Pours translucent dirty gold with a ring of white foam. Malty chalky nose, a little citrus. Taste is a subtle pale, almost helles. Backed by some lemon citrus. Very mild and even. Flavorful summer brew, balanced and not too sweet. Good for the fourth."

"O: Overall while i wished the citra hops lasted a bit longer on the nose, this did follow within the guidelines per style of an american blonde. Nice soft dry grain base, bittering more typical per style, but lightly dry, a body that was a bit fuller with a pretty decent rate of drinkability. While not a big fan of Widmers earlier works they do seem to be progressing. Final thoughts, while those might be expecting a big burst of tropical citra hops, this is more focused on traditional style, softly dry bittering, and not meant to be an ipa. Overall pretty decent per style."

"O: There's room for improvement - the Citra hops could be shown off better, and it could also use less of a carbonic bite - but it's nice enough in its current state. Give me a six pack and 100 degree weather, and I'd probably think of this in a much better light. It certainly beats BMC, that's for damn sure (wait...)"

"Overall: for a profile of a great hop this beer showcases it extremely well. Great session beer and I believe it is underrated based on the brewery,,,no need to be pretentious"

"My anxious pour netted me just over two fingers of dense, bone-white head with very good retention. Color was a slightly-hazy sunshine yellow (SRM = 4) and I found myself wishing for the return of warmer weather. I just attended my 30-year high school reunion last night and by the end, my feet and right knee caused me to have to sit down. Today, the arthritis in my hands is kicking it. Warmth would be good right about now. The foam fell as I typed, leaving beautiful lacing in its wake. I plan on running the dishwasher later today so it all works out. The jackhammer can remain in the basement as a result. Nose was citrusy, evocative of tangerines or mandarin oranges. Mouthfeel was light, not thin per se, but not big, either. Upon tasting it, I definitely stand behind tangerines in terms of taste. A nice breakfast beer, although I have already eaten breakfast. Finish was semi-dry and this would make an excellent lawnmower beer during the summertime."

"Overall, this is probably a lot better fresh. Citra doesn't seem to hold up very well under too many months on the shelf, but if you could find this fresh, it'd probably be one hell of a tasty session beer."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy yellowish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is surprisingly hoppy, some citrus notes as well. Taste is well balanced hops and malts, a bit minty, some citrus, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing summer brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a tasty little brew. If you want a summer session brew with some flavor this would be a good one to go with."

"Pours with a foamy white head that leaves a great web of lacing on the glass; aroma is pungent, skunky hop goodness. Not sure if I get citrus from citra; the scent seems more musk to me; I can see why people say ""cat-pee", but it's a smell that is appealing with the hop connotation. The citrus comes in the flavor; tangerine rind, grapefruit pith. The malt backbone seems weak and small, a little water cracker and some white rice. Mouthfeel not quite light lager but still very thin. Carbonation has strong bite, also comparable to light lager levels. An interesting and sessionable beer at only 4.4%, very much a great summer brew."
""
""
"Overall most blonde ales are pretty similar. Light, muted flavors, and somewhat sweet so to style it's really quite good."
""
""
""
"This blonde ale at only 4.3 ABV is rather refreshing and holds its own in flavor. For a very warm, late August day, it did just fine."

"O: A nice citra summer brew; not something I'd probably drink a lot of, even with the low abv; could stand to be a touch drier."
""
""
"Overall – It is a rather refreshing brew overall but nothing all that out of the ordinary. A good go to for a more session style on a nice warm day."
""
""
""
"This is a really nice summer beer. The fruit flavors that come through are pretty intricate for such a small beer. This also has a great deal of drinkability and it's really refreshing. This probably won't please most of the hardcore beer drinkers, but if I'm going to be out in the heat, I would definitely enjoy several of these."
"Golden yellow straw colored ale. Fantastic clarity. Moderate head retention. Great carbonation bubbles. Eggshell white foam. Great citra hop nose . A bit of lemon on the nose,but mainly those lovely citra hops are very inviting. Very light,smooth mouthfeel is extremely refreshing. This is AA very refreshing summer ale but I would have enjoyed abut more go flavor. Of course it would have then been an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer succeeds as a refreshing and sessionable ale with rally nice citra hop character. If that is what you are looking for give it a shot. It is pretty refreshing, but it is basically hoppy water. It serves its purpose as a nice and simple summer ale."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, crystal clear, straw-yellow coloring with a frothy, white ring around the surface. Lots of carbonation action in the body. Aromas of roasted and grassy hops, dry and peat-like, with a toasted grain backbone. Very aromatic and balanced. Flavors of roasted grains and toasted bread, with a honey sweet highlight. Light, subtle, resiny hops presence that adds piney and floral notes at the end of the palate. The body is light, almost watery at times, with a slight effervescent feel from the carbonation. Grassy and sweet aftertaste, with a clean, crisp finish. Very drinkable, very light...perfect for warmer weather."

"Overall, just another blonde I don't care for."
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty average but would drink it if I were offered it."
""
""
""
""

""

""
"Overall: this is a fantastic beer. It is the quintessential summer beer. It is citrusy and refreshing without being too sweet. This is a very well balanced beer. I can't think of a better beer to enjoy on a warm summer evening."
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Damn good. If there were more bitterness I would call it an IPA. This could become one of my favorite summer brews."

"A great beer for a warm summer day...I love the Citra hops. I'm not a huge fan of the Widmer Brothers brewery, however their use of citra hops caught my eye. This beer has a nice color for a Blonde. I plan on adding this to my list of summer beers. Its easy to drink and has plenty of flavor."
""
"I'm more of a Citra brunette kind o' guy... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises spicy greens, light sweet biscuit, light grapefruit zest, and a few drops of honey. The taste holds notes of mild and funky grapefruit zest, biscuit, and some mixed greens all up in the finish and whatnot. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, an okay little blonde, nothing close to spectacular, but something drinkable enough for a lazy afternoon."

"nice light beer... has one of my fav. hops... citra nice flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy this beer again? Maybe."
""
""
""
""
"OK summer brew that smells a little funky and doesn't really stand out from others on the market. Maybe this was a bad bottle, however I still ended up enjoying it."
"At first the taste is on the sweet side but it slowly evolves into a clean, crisp hop flavor but not much lingers at the end. Still, it would be refreshing on a hot summer day."
"A really good summer brew. On the lighter side as a blonde but has great flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a light golden color with a coarse white head that stuck around for a bit. Smells a strong danky orange/ citrus aroma with some other fruitiness playing in the background, very pleasant indeed. I could taste orange peel with light bready malt and some grassy flavors. the beer is light with moderate carbonation and a refreshing finish. Nice summer beer, I definitely was not disappointed."
""
""
""
"Pours a clean yellow/orange - not much head but some bubbles. Surprisingly strong nose of hops leads to a well-balanced taste. The hops steal the show, but that's not a bad thing. It's not a ""wow"" taste or anything, but it's clean and crisp - perfect for a summer brew."
""
"not a bad summer ale at all - it's hard to be different and maintain style guidelines, but this one is sweeter than most - which is good for a wheat beer because they usually have that pungent bready aftertaste. this one still has a subtle aftertaste, but it is very citrusy/sweet so it makes you crave more."
"O-Fine to have once but I doubt I will seek this out again."
""
""
""
"O- Alright. Nothing special. Above bad, about average for a summery blonde ale."
""
"Overall dry and refreshing, something like a Lite version of an American Pale Ale. I could see buying this again, a good beer for a hot day."
""
"The mouth is medium with a touch of slickness. Easy beer to pair with grilled chicken or a fresh tomato salad. I have really liked the last two seasonal offerings from Widmer."
"My first swig of this beer let me know that it is a smooth, tame mouthfeel with citrus on the nose heavily as I swallow and get a nice quick aftertaste of lemon rind that quickly vanishes and I'm on to the next drink. This beer is uniquely refreshing because it has a nice body and a finish of a full bodied beer but every sip makes me want to take another which reminds me of a coors light or bud light ( you just wanna finish it). This beer is fruity and citrusy across the board from the smell to the taste and up to 3 seconds after swallowing. It defintely is a nice summer seasonal that I will share with many friends."
""
""
""
"O - This is a really tasty blonde ale. Love the citra hops!"
"Overall: It was really hot at the festival, and this just blew me away with it's refreshing, juicy, thirst-quenching flavor. I would session this beer all summer long. I hope it makes its way to the Great Plains before next summer."
""
""
""
"Good balance between the hops, malt and fruitiness. Good twist on the lighter summer seasonal flavor here, very drinkable ... super sessionable with enough flavor to keep it interesting."
""
""
""
"This beer has alot of qualities I like, but something isn't hitting right. I feel this could've been something very special, but instead it seems just average."
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens with a mild hop flavor and bitterness (just a little lacking on the bitterness IMO) with a blend of orange, mango, and even a little orange pith bitterness. The malt character is barely noticeable, lending a mild, grainy, sweetness before a rather watery finish kicks in. While there is some hop flavor and even a mild bitterness on the finish, this beer finishes rather watery. Crisply carbonated and relatively soft on the palate, this beer _is_ refreshing, and does win a Truth in Advertising award from me. Solid."
""
"An easy drinking, well done summer beer. Lots of flavor from the Citra hops in a lower ABV, balanced beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really, the name says it all. Nice citrus summer brew. Nothing off-putting about this beer. Just a simple, straight-forward, light and completely drinkable citrus blonde."
"This is a nice beer, but it's not going to knock anyone's socks off. It's simple and refreshing, but a bit thin in the mouth and with a rather bland finish. The citra hops definitely contribute a nice little bite, but once the beer gets past the middle of your palate, it starts to feel a little watered-down."
"This is one of my favorite summer beers this year....I see it as kind of a Kolsch hopped with Citra....the Citra hops really shine through with all their citrus goodness but the body and malt give this a crisp, Kolsch like feel. Lower weight and lower ABV but loaded with flavor....that makes this a top notch refreshing summertime drinker. Now I need to find it in bottles..."
""
""
""
"The name pretty much says it all, a summer session beer accented with citra hops. Pour is clear gold with a disappearing head of pure white foam. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy (almost pale ale hoppy) with lime, orange, and an herbal grassiness. The hoppiness promised by the nose is somehow absent on the palate. What's left is a not unpleasant herbal bitterness and citrus pith flavor. The clean, dry, softly grainy malt body combined with the Widmer house yeast give the impression of a hybrid between American Pale Ale and Kolsch. All around a solid summer ale, if a bit more hop flavor hung around into the finish it would be great. I've been pleasantly surprised by Widmer lately."
"O: I'll call myself more then surprised by Widmer's Summer Citra. I genuinely enjoyed this summer session ale, and I see myself returning to this many times over the next couple of months. For those citra fans out there, you should make a point of getting into this one."
"O: Blonde ales are not known for their complexity. That being said, this is an enjoyable and drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a drinkable beer, it would good on a hot day after mowing the lawn. But I doubt I'll have this again."
"O/D-Overall, aside from the metallic flavor found during some sips, this is a pretty nice Summer brew. Love citra hops. They did this one quite well."
"Was hoping the citra hops would come through in the flavor. Didn't really. Not bad though, crisp and clean."
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad brew in the big picture and pretty decent for the style. Worth a go, I say."
""
"O: Good beer, I do not regret the 6pack I picked up at all. Might even recommend this as the summer seasonal we pick up at the little cafe I work at."
""
"Flavor-wise, this one is citrus-hoppy, but there's no bitterness, as it's all balanced by a prominent sweet malt profile."
""
"O - Given it was an 80+F degree day a nice summer brew. Refreshing but with some bite to it."
"i really liked this one. it surprised me quite a bit, this is a major step up from the legions of watery summer brews. pours a radiant orange color with a tall white head and some haze. smells fruity and yeasty. fresh oranges for sure, possibly some tangerines in there as well, and a floral hop aroma. taste is sort of similar to new belgium's biere de mars, spicy and refreshing. they citrus flavor is great, not at all bitter, and a perfect complement to the yeast. im very impressed with this beer. the feel works well too, spunky carbonation and a medium body. there is a crispness to this that makes it an excellent warm weather beer, but i think it could be great in all seasons. a winner for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Not bad for a light summer beer. Citra hops are what make this beer. A little strong with the spiced aspects, grass, and bitterness and a touch thin (which compounds the first problem) but overall this is a nice change of pace summer beer."

"77."
"While I wish the flavor did more to mimic the nose, this was surprisingly tasty. Crisp, summery and drinkable. Citrus hops in a blonde — who’d have thunk?"
"Overall: A surprisingly unique summer brew. While it's a wheat beer, it has very little in common with most other breweries' summer seasonals. Perfectly balanced between hops and malts, this is an above-average, perfectly sessionable summer brew."
"O: The look and smell are nice, but the flavor is a substantial disappointment for me. One and done."
"O: Wouldn't buy again, but would drink again. Nice use of Citra hops, but not a whole lot else there."
"A linger of hop flavor and light bitterness remain in aftertaste, outlasing the vegital and grain flavors and encoraging the next drink. If any normal hop additions were made, this beer would struggle for respect, but it's saved by the rich citrusy flavor of the Citra hop."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. Its a real summer thirst quencher!"
"Citrusy hops dominate the taste but isn't overly bitter. Very good. Has a nice sweet finish that's short and doesn't linger too long. Light fizzy and refreshing. Good summer brew with enough flavor to keep you interested."
"High C+"
"light acid feel.the flavor lasts a little while showing a little sour on the end."
"(Lightly editted with May 2013 bottle consumed June 2013; and again in July 2014)."
"O: This fits well for summer beer styles -- light, drinkable, and distinctive with Citra hopping taking the lead with refreshing orange citrus and earthy, slightly oniony herbal combination that works well with subtly fruity pale maltiness. Great job Widmer."
"Overall - A nice change from the dozens of other summer brews that all taste like watered down beer with lemons mashed in. I would pick this up more often if it was an all year beer. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"A decent lawn-mower beer, but that's all I'll give it..."
"Overall: There're loads of other blondes I'd prefer to grab over this one. It's a bit of a snoozer, even for just a mild, meager blonde ale."
"Overall - Very nice beer from Widmer. I bet it would be even better on tap. Great for those hot summer days."
"Pours a crystal clear gold color with a 1 inch bubbly white head that settles to a thin cap. Decent rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is delicious with lots of citrus and tropical fruit aromas mixed with a spicy herbal scent. Taste is of the citrus and tropical fruits up front with a solid malty backbone on the finish. Little bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good solid blonde ale with very nice fruity aromas and tastes."
"o: a nice summer brew. goes down great and doesnt lack flavor.."
"This is one of the most refreshing beers I have ever had. The flavor is very clean and in no way overbearing. Bitterness is light, but the hop flavor comes through nicely. The malt is very crisp and snappy...husky grains and saltine cracker crumbs. Very well crafted, easy drinking summer brew. Citra hop lovers will dig this brew on a hot day."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on June 29, 2011. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about an inch off-white head. The head sticks around for a while, and there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass, too. Aroma is citrus (tropical fruit, lemon peel) and floral hops, along with some bready malt. The brew tastes like citrusy (tropical fruit, grapefruit) hops, light floral hops, bready malt and some orange peel. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit creamy, crisp and clean, and is well carbonated. It's also very smooth and easy to drink. At 4.3% ABV, it wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these in a session. It's a good beer for a hot day, I think I might have just found my new summer brew!"
"Overall I think that this is a great summer session beer. Its light pleasant to drink with good flavors. Perfect for a summer cookout, or as a lawnmower beer on a hot day."
"O: A good drinking beer on a hot summer day - I put down 5 of these on Saturday this past weekend without even noticing. The low ABV helps, while the nice flavor imparted from those Citra hops keeps it flavorful enough to be interesting."
"O: A nice, light summer ale. Well balanced, fruity, hoppy and just a little bit malty"
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint at 53 degrees. APR 22 11 indicated on the label. Pours a translucent honey gold with a loose, half inch off-white head. Head disperses into a bull's eye dollop and a thin, soapy band around the edges. Nose expresses citrus, grassy notes and a faint, sweet character towards the back. Taste is citrusy, but not very distinct or full-bodied. A slight earthiness comes out towards the back and there are some biscuity notes interspersed with the citrus; however, it all comes off somewhat watery. Mouthfeel is light in body with a prickly, almost gassy, carbonation and a slight acidity that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks and the back of the tongue. I know its only a 4.30% abv, but all and all it's a bit lackluster. Not something I would really care to session."
"Finish is pleasant yet brief with just a touch of lemony grain lingering after a second or two. Overall I'd recommend drinking this one directly from the bottle while sailing or at the BBQ where the hops remain prominent and the carbonation a bit more firm."
"overall this is a quintessential summer time brew...easy to drink, flavourful and appealing to the everyday hop head. pretty nice. recommended."
"The body was fairly typical, light, crisp and smooth. Drinkability was good, my bottle went down quick and easy. Overall, a very nice little beer. Worth grabbing a sixer for after yardwork, or for a cookout or picnic."
"O- This is a fairly average brew all told, but it works well for what it is. While it isn't something I'd knock people over to get, I'd drink it again in a pinch."
"Overall, it was a fairly average beer. It drank easy, but there wasn't a lot of flavor here."
"The lack of hop flavor, light body and low carbonation make this a beer I would go for when the weather is hot. A fine summer brew with nothing offensive, but nothing to put it much over the likes of Shock Top either. Definitely sessionable (as advertised), I could see kicking back quite a few of these while working on cars on a 100 degree plus day here in New Mexico."
"Overall a good beer for the category. Not something I'd normally seek out, but I could drink more of this."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. I don’t know if I could drink it all the time, but in the heat I’d be good for two or three. It’s light, refreshing and the smells and flavors really seem to mix well."
"Overall, this is a pleasant surprise. Very drinkable, especially with the warm weather outside, but still with plenty of flavor. Might not fit the strict terms, but this is pretty sessionable to me. Well done Widmer."
"Overall? I love this beer. It's HOT out in Florida. This is one of the best ways to beat the heat I've found so far, it's very refreshing while still having a satisfying flavor. I'm depressed that I only bought the single bottle, and am going first thing to the beer store tomorrow after work to pick up a couple more sixers. Bravo, Widmer."
"O: the best way to put this beer in a category is to say its a hop heads picnic beer. A great standout from the usual kolsch and wit summer beers. I'll be buying this a lot for a surprise picnic beer no one sees coming."
"The taste therefore was a little weak, since we had the citrus fruit notes up front, then some bread and grain in the middle and a weak hop flavor at the end. Good balance, but to faint and weak for my taste. But I know it is supposed to be a summer brew."
"12oz bottle with a Bottle On Date of Apr 22 2011. Pours a translucent very light golden color with almost no head. Very minimal lacing. Aroma has a nice amount of citrus and tropical fruits. Good amount of hops in the nose. Taste has a lot less hop flavor than I thought there would be. Faint citrus taste. Flavor has more breadiness and malt flavor. Light and watery with a thin mouthfeel. This beer let me down. The aroma was really good but the taste was lacking. Still an alright summer beer, but I would never get it on its own. Alright in the mix 12 pack I got it in but that is where it needs to stay."
"Keep this coming all summer long! A little citra (hop) goes a long way."
"D: Widmer does it right with this summer offering."
"O: While not an amazing beer, this is a good one to drink on a hot day."
"I find Widmer Brothers Citra Blonde Summer Brew--that's a lot of names!--to be very refreshing and highly flavorful. It's darn near a perfect beer!"
"Appearance has a light golden yellow color with a fairly crisp thin head leaving spotty lace. Smell of citra hops having a grassy note with mild malt. Taste of the citra hops are blended very well with the malt making it easy to go down. Mouthfeel is light with mild carbonation again making it easy to go down. A very tasty light brew that goes down quick making for a nice session."
"Golden yellow, fluffy white head. Citrus hops on the nose. Great malt and citrus hop flavor, doesn't lay on the tongue. I've tried a dozen or so summer seasonal beers this year and this was my favorite. Very drinkable. I like that the hops are for flavor, not for bittering to any great degree, as I've tried the citra IPA from Widmer and it's pretty harsh, even for an IPA. If you ever wanted to know why they named this hop citra, try this beer, you'll read the bottle wondering if they added orange/lime/lemon, nope."
"O: Not a bad blonde and a summer ale for hop fans. I'm pretty unfamiliar with Citra, but on this impression, I'm not a huge fan. The 4.3% ABV means you can session til the cows come home, but there may not be enough to hold the attention of most. Worth a shot this summer."
"O: Widmer continues to be one of the best value brands in beer IMO. Definitely just a beer for the summertime, I could see this being very refreshing. The Citra adds an interesting complexity and makes for a beer that's fun to drink."
"I recently picked up a bottle of this one as part of a mixed six pack, and I wish I has some more. Poured a light golden color with a little white head, which quickly disappears. Good hoppy aromas here, orange zest, papaya, pineapple. On the palate, this one was light and refreshing, with more orange, pineapple and papaya."
"12oz bottle of a super hoppy blonde. Bright yellow with a hint of orange. The smell is a fabulous melange of citrus, tropical fruit, and hoppiness, surprising. The taste is more fantastic citrus but at the same time it just doesnt have any oomph behind it and fades fast. The citra hops are showcased well here but I think they work better in an IPA."
"It's not a beer that's mean to be complex, but the hops are interesting; and overall it's easy to drink and quite refreshing. The label reads ""satisfyingly sessionable"" and that's certainly true!"
"O: Citrus and malt are the hallmark of this beer. A little shy on balance, but not cloyingingly so."
"Past the look, the beer is a pretty mild experience. Dry straw malts do the work up front. Bitterness is light and slightly lemony. The beer finishes dry and a little tart. Its light body and low ABV make it go down easily."
"(12oz bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge). Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a quickly dissipating head. Aroma has great citrus rind/pith notes: guava and grapefruit. Unexpected, but quite nice. I’m finding some hay notes as well. Taste is sweet with a touch of bittering hops. Medium bodied with a slick/creamy texture. Smooth finish. The flavors are a bit muted at first, but it opens up a little as it warms. Pretty nice, session beer."
"Overall - not a bad brew, but not terribly interesting or intriguing. Still worth a taste, and probably good on a hot day."
"A nice light fruity ale. No big flavors or off grainy flavors to slow this beer down and it has great balance. Good for the style."
"overall: very very similiar to the drifter. a refreshing light beer with alot of crispness."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s not a bad beer but there are several others in the style that I would pick first."
"Overall I think it's a decent light and refreshing beer to session. In no part of this beer there anything bold or overwhelming. I think this would be a good beer to transition a boneheaded Bud drinker to into a craft beer drinker."
"Overall: I have never had a really good Widmer beer and this I have to say is one I will buy again! This is a great summer beer. Besides Abita Strawberry I really like this one as well to have quite a few and really not be heavy on the palate. These will go down real easy in the Arizona Heat."
"O: Pretty nice for a clean summer beer. Would make for a good spring beer too IMO. For a beer on lighter side, this is pretty darn good. Give it a try, it might surprise you."
"- Overall this is a great cold drinker for a hot day. It's very light on the malt side, and you can tell they really played with the hops to create this beers flavor. It's light, bubbly, and refreshing. A beer I am sure most anybody would enjoy, or be able to get started on for a path through craftbeerdom. Overall the beers looks are average.. not a huge amount of lace or cloudiness. A little too typical for my liking, but the hops certainly stand out among others. Worth a try."
"Comes out of the tap a slightly hazy golden amber with an average white head. Strong, hoppy, fruity and slightly sweet aroma calls for a taste. Hoppy flavor borders on evergreen but surprisingly is not bitter, and has a nice fruity undertone and a hint of malt. Fizzy, lively texture is truly lip-smacking. Bottoms up for summer!"
"After I drank this beer more and more it did get crisper and easier to drink, and a little tasty, but it just has too many faults for me to change my rating."
"Overall- This is a good summer bbq beer, but lacks some depth. I am glad to try it but don't know if I will buy another 6er. My wife on the other hand is all over this beer."
