"Not one of favorites at RR"
""
"This should be graded on the curve, the scores here are way too low.  Unfortunately this category, like Irish Reds, don't reflect a true mean, like IPA's and stouts and wild ales."

"i am surprised to see this one rated so low. of all the non sour beers at russian river, this was one of my favorites. its a very light but flavorful blonde ale, more hoppy than most with a great citrus finish and enough body to not come through watered down at all. there appears to be some wheat in here too, a nice base for the higher hop dose. carbonation is happy and the finish is pretty clean. touch of sweetness there makes it stick. i dont get the low marks, its a great blonde ale. while i was in some ways unimpressed by the base beer offerings at russian river, i though this one was a success. definitely different from the crowd."

"On tap at the brewery in Santa Rosa. yellow color, I guess this is supposed to be a hoppy blond but I did not find it all that hoppy. In fact it was my least favorite beer at Russian River and was just overall very boring to me. I would not order this again if I saw it."

"On tap as part of a sampler at the brewpub. pours light golden with a creamy white head. the nose is light citrus and peach notes, very fruity, with some accompanying hay aroma. Flavor is light with hay, grass, light citrus, and a wheat-like finish that is just a tad dirty. Light bodied, spritzy carbonation, easy going. Very easy drinking beer that is worth sucking down on a hot day."

"It's dull, but very solid. I guess Russian River can't be all oak-aged Wilds and hopped-up Insanity."

"O - Overall pretty drinkable, but they have some many good beers here this just isn't a standout. Good one to start with on the sampler though."

"Dr: Incredibly drinkable. Very refreshing; well priced for the quality. Among the best blondes I've tried (insert sex joke here). How they get that fresh orange note in there puzzles me."

"O - Very solid. I just had to try it when I could."

"O: This is not usually a style I seek out, but really enjoyed this brew. Not overly complex but easy to drink and tasty."
"Clean and simple, pale malt that lends a little sweetness and grainy qualities., and a lightly bitter hop to balance in the finish. Lightly nutty impression also. Medium bodied with a generally light feel, something easily sessionable and pretty accessible to most beer drinkers."
"Golden and crystal clear with a small white head. Nice light hop aroma with a mild hop flavor that hints of everything that's packed into the bigger RR IPAs. Simple but very refreshing and enjoyable. This is a great intro beer for those new to craft beer and a fantastic session option."
"This is a decent Belgian/American Blonde ale. Light, crisp and slightly fruity this is just what the doctor ordered."
"D - Very drinkable. The balance between all of the various flavors here is very nice with out feeling empty or muddled. It is a great approachable beer for new craft beer drinkers as well as a great way to start off the night."
"O: There is really not much to this beer, but more importantly, there isn’t anything negative about this beer. I could drink this all day and never get tired of it."
"GOOD, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"With blonde ales you can expect a creative coma (even apparently from the world's most creative brewers). Blonde ales are nothing more than clean, moderately malty, and easy-going. There are far more interesting offerings at Russian River, and this is one that could stand to be spared, but if you like the style it's one of the best examples you'll find."
"O: Amazing. This is one of the best, if not the best, blonde ales I've ever had. Though, for a blonde, this is seriously hoppy, almost on the pale ale level (though without the grapefruit/pine character of most APA's). The hops provide a great deal of complexity and the majority of the character. There is a great malt counterpoint, as well. Overall, this beer is very well put together."
"Taste, full of it, refreshing, lemon, slightly bitter, hoppy, yet easy enough to pass off on the girlfriend. A crowd pleaser probably, beer geek centric or not. A little spicy, as if some rye, but its probably the yeast."
"drinkability: I could drink a few of these with a nice meal."
"Had this on tap in a restaurant in Santa Rosa (the name of the place escapes me). Pours a pale yellow colour with thin white head. Smells quite fruity and sweet, with some mild hops. Very sweet flavour, nicely balanced ale. Big carbonation level, would probably prefer it toned down a bit. A pretty nice beer."
"On tap at the brewpub. The color could be described as blond. Clarity is pretty good, and so is head retention. The nose is fairly bland, largely pale malt with a touch of honey sweetness and straw. Tastes pretty good for the style, it had a clean pale malt profile, a little citrus and breadiness. There's a very mild and clean hop bite in the finish. Solid for a blonde, but not standout in Russian River's lineup."
"Beer is light in body and has a nice presence on the palate, good carbonation. Midpalate is mostly citrus and minimal sweetness up front. It tastes really nice, its light, refreshing its sessionable, its about the easiest drinking beer I've ever had. Obviously not my favorite RR brew, but its totally solid."
"Taste: I'll admit, I tried this as a lark since this isn't my typical beer style but I wanted to see what RR could do. Crisp, light and fizzy with more graininess than I expected. Some underlying hop flavor, but not much. However it is very drinkable...though I'd likely contend that its too drinkable. The middle is more of the same, very grainy with an underlying rich, moist edge that I often taste in some German lagers. Finishes very clean with faint hops and grain notes to do get more intense as it warms. I'll give this a B since I'm rating to style.... definitely not average but not exciting, at least to me."
"Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. Surprisingly good flavour for a blond,gppd fpor style, and for the lower a.b.v. A little funky aroma. A good tangy bitterness. Good white lace on yellow. Average mouthfeel. Great points on drinkability, late in the session."
"Draught at the brewpub. Light yellow with a creamy white head. Clean doughy, bready malt aroma. Light bready malt profile with a surprisingly ample, spicy hop balance. Light bodied and crisp with smooth carbonation. Considering that this was the ""lightly hopped"" of their two blond ales, I was surprised at the nice, spicy hop flavor. Great balance, and somewhat reminiscent of a pilsener. Top notch choice for a session beer."
"D: Excellent. Very sessionable and would love to be able to grab a sixer of this one."
"This is an easy drinking beer that is perfect for hot days or when you don't want your sour or hop fix at RR. This will please most people."
"D: Kind of a conundrum. This is a pretty good summer beer, but I've only seen it on tap, and I don't go to bars to drink light stuff. I guess if I saw it on a really hot day, I'd get it. But for my usual pub crawls, this is going to be skipped."
"This easy drinking style is quickly overshadowed and forgotten when you start working your way through the 20+ beers available on tap at the brewpub in Santa Rosa."
"decent hop/malt taste, light-medium body, hoppy bite throughout the entire drink, malt and wood characteristics, straw gold color, very thin white head with delicate lace, malty, medium-long finish, good served cold, clear. not my style but okay for a starter beer on a warm day."
"Drinkability - hell, this was so easy drinking, I was done before I knew it. Quite excellent."
"Very drinkable blonde!"
"Enjoyable beer. Tap at O'Briens 15th, golden color, a bit cloudy? A bit of a whit taste to it. Dry finish. A little odd and I'm not a big fan of the style. Fun to try. Texture was a bit weird and not very smooth and or balanced. No Alc noticable so that wasn't an issue."
"D: Pretty uninteresting and as such easy to drink. Probably won't get it again, though."
"On tap at Russian River brewpub. Pours a very light straw colour, good clarity. Nose- light grassy and citrus. Taste- light bodied, medium carbonation, mild biscuit flavour with a lemon finish. Drinkability is very high given its session nature and its a good chance of pace inbetween big belgians or pints of pliny. Pairs well with the brew pub chow."
"Pours a clear yellow/light gold, thin white head forms, quickly drops down to a thin ring, some spots of lace are left on the glass. Smell is nice, sweet, honey like malts, grass, floral, some grainy and biscuity aroma, not exciting but nice. Taste is similar, some nice malty sweetness at first, grassy hops, some floral, light fruit, bit of a citric bitterness, toasty finish with orange peel. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very light and smooth and easy to drink. As noted, not very exiciting, but an easy drinking blond ale I would be happy to session all summer."
"Pours a clear gold color with a sticky white head. Aroma is soft and citric. Flavor is lightly grainy with a lemony zing and a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is semi-dry and the drinkability is off the charts. One of the most refreshing beers I've had."
"The taste is light, crisp, exceedingly refreshing, and very smooth, but full of flavour and subtle complexity. It tastes of grain, fruit, citrus, yeast. It's a nicely balanced bittersweet beer with a faint yeasty sourness lutrking underneath."
"D: Served purpose of starting off the day. Very easy drinking and refreshing. Nice balance between slight sweetness and hop taste but nothing overwhelming."
"I would probably order it again, but likely as a lead-in to something else."
"Got this on tap at the Brewpub in Santa Rosa. Came in a pint glass and was a clear yellow with a minimal head as are many pub pours. Nose of flowery hops and mild malts. Good clean mouthfeel. Nice flavors with hops sort of like a pils. Nice dry finish. Very drinkable."
"D: Very high on the drinkability scale. I put down a bunch of these at my buddy's wedding with ease. This isn't the best beer that Russian River makes but it's quite good, especially for the style."
"Very drinkable. This would be very good if it wasn't on the same menu as Pliny the Elder, Blind Pig, Damnation, Salvation, Perdition, and Compunction."
"I wasn't expecting much from this and I'm surprised I even reviewed it. I don't think I would've if it hadn't been made at the beer mecca, Russian River."
"Drinkability on a hot day is pretty good, but not lot to keep your interest."
"The smell has an assertive hop presence, mostly in citrus form. Hops also come through strong in the taste, from the front all the way through. Malts are light and barely present in the face of those hops. The mouthfeel is light while drinkability is good."
"Drinkability- Certainly one of the most flavorful blondes I have ever had, overall pretty tasty and recommended."
"The flavor was more malty than hoppy, again faint. Easy to drink and could be sessionable, but mostly forgettable to me compared to the other beers from Russian River. Interestingly there was no sour component despite a lack of hops to cover up said flavor. So I guess they have good control over their Brett."
"From my notes on recent trip, this beer pours a light golden color with no head as delivered, but spotty lacing here and there. Aroma is of citrussy, lemons and a slight malt floating around there too. Pretty decent. Taste is quite nice, an easily drinkable creamy smooth malt and lemon cirtus thats fresh and refreshing. At 4.5%, I'd drink this all night long."
"Overall: I realized that it was an American Blonde Ale, and I didnt expect a lot (even here!), but I wanted to try it nonetheless. It turns out that this was very good, yet it turned out to be the least favored return to of the RRBC beers that I sampled over my weekend visit, simply put, there is just too much competition. Still, this is a solid 3.95 though, almost a 4.0, says a lot that."
