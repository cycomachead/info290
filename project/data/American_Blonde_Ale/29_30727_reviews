"Poured this American Blonde Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear straw color, produced a thin white head, Poor retention and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma of this blonde ale smells of cereal grains, corn and fruit. Light in body, this blonde ale has a flavor of malted grain, some mild hop bitterness, warm grits , and red apples. Overall, this blonde ale isnt much to talk about, mass produced, seems its of higher quality then some of AB's mass produced lagers, but there are much better craft brewed blonde ales out there.

"Pale yellow color with an off-white head. There isn’t too much to the aroma except some pale maltiness. The flavor also has some pale malt, some citrus, and a slightly sour quality, but for the most part it is grainy and bland. Light to medium-light body. This is a drinkable session beer."

"O: If I had a fresher bottle of this to review, I'm not sure that I would give it any higher of a rating. To me, this is just a standard macro attempt at an ale. It's predictable stuff that lacks depth and substance. I won't be seeking it out again if I can help it."

"Pours a light orange/yellow body with a thin fizz of head, head dissapears instantly and spotty lacing. Aroma is citrusy and unremarkable. Taste surprises based on smell and appearance, being a nicly balanced mildly bitter brew. (Alsace, Hallertau & Cascade are listed as hops. Decent, but more of a summer brew!"

"This is drinkable, but not really enjoyable. Pretty average and forgettable."
"I'd say this is a pretty good beer"
"Very enjoyable."
"O: Surfs up, brah."
"Beach Bum Blonde pours our a golden blonde with a finely bubbled white head on top. The aroma off the beer is of grains, grass, and maybe some citrus (lemon) hop. It's to be noted that the beer is dry-hopped, but Michelob doesn't note which hop variety - or varieties - are used. The taste is surprisingly malty given it's light hue. You get a lot of biscuity notes which are well balanced by the hops in the beer. The swallow of the beer is clean and very light, but some of the hop snap does linger a little further into the drink."
"D/O- Nothing off-putting but overall nothing more than a thirst quencher. Good for a summer day when ABInBev products are the only thing on tap ;)"
"This was sampled from the tap at the Anheuser-Busch brewery in St. Louis, Missouri. Beach Bum Blonde Ale has a thick, creamy, off-white head and a bright, hazy yellow-orange color. Lots of lacing is left behind. The aroma is of citrus and hops, with lightly toasted malts as well. The taste is a delicious mix of malt breadiness and strong citrus, making one almost think it was flavored with juice, which it is not. Floral hoppiness is a pleasant note here at the end of the sip. The mouthfeel is light to medium, and Beach Bum finishes refreshing, crisp, and dry. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer, and I would like to have it again."
"I'm actually glad I didn't know it was AB or I might not have tried it. I'll try it again if it's the only thing available."
"This was a pretty good beer. It is nothing special but is averagely good. I got it on tap which came out as a light golden yellow color. Not fairly impressive. The taste was satisfactory with no real overbearing tastes to it. It has no bite and no bad aftertaste. If you want an average beer that will not disappoint you I recommend this."
"Overall - not a bad brew, but not very interesting or intriguing."
"Overall: Extremely refreshing, if a bit more watery than the aroma lead me to anticipate. Still, this brew offers a much more interesting aroma and flavor profile than an American lager. A fantastic addition to my lawnmower beer list! If only it were available in cans for days at the pool/beach..."
"Feels crisp and clean as well as wetting to the palate."
"Had this at the Copperhead Bar & Grille in Allentown. I wanted to try something I hadn't had before. This was the only choice at the time. So I got this beer in a pint glass can out with a nice little head on it and a little bit of a hazy yellow color. This beers aroma was pretty hoppy for a blond ale. The flavor was pretty crisp and nicely hopped. I found it to be pretty good , I don't know if I'd need to have it again. I would if I had too."
"I'm surprised that A-B produced such a quality brew. Definitely doesn't taste like a beer from the brewery famous for the macro-brewed Bud and Bud Lite"
"The bottle says the beer is dry hopped but you really can't tell from the aroma and flavor. Taste like caramel and butterscotch. It's got a bit of sharpness to it that I like. Light bodied summer beer that I'll probably turn down."
"I try to always look beyond the label and just drink the beer."
"Very drinkable with no trace of alcohol. It won't replace Shock Top as my favorite AB product, but this is not bad."
"That said, it's pretty easy to drink, and tastes better than most offerings out of Anheuser-Busch."
"The beer pours a clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is orange citrus with some biscuit malt. Somewhat surprisingly, the beer doesn't smell bad at all. The flavor is not as good as the smell. While I get a little bit of biscuit malt as well as some orange and pine notes, the overall flavor is very faint. The beer is very watery and has medium carbonation. There is just really not much too this beer. Not one to seek out."
"I wouldn't seek this out, but I feel this is better than some that were in my mixed summer 6 pack."
"D- this wasn't the best blonde i have had by any means but at the local pub on a warm day you have one or two of these with their famous muffietta sandwich which as a relish topping and it really gives the sandwich a good flavor."
"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Nice appearance... dark golden with a nice foamy head and a little bit of lace; nose is not strong, but does have a solid balance. Flavor is pretty decent. Nothing transcendental, but a nicely balanced, light-bodied brew. Overall, this is a pretty solid quaff."
"I poured into a pint glass to three fingers of white head. It is yellow in color and clear. There is not much of a smell. It's kind of sweet. The taste is lackluster as well. It is very bland. It just has the faintest hints of hops and malt. It is watery and goes down like it."
"One of those mass market beers where it is hard to review, not because you have bad things to say - simply that it is hard to say much at all. Moderate malt body with no distinction. Very mildly hopped, so as not to offend the casual beer drinker - enough to be present and then not much more. Finish was clean with a vague lingering bitterness. I would describe this as vanilla, but vanilla at least has a distinctive flavor. This is more aptly described as generic."
"D: Clean, albeit boring flavors all around. Beach Bum will find its place amongst the ""craft"" drinkers in the AB circle looking for a ""great refreshing summer brew with some good taste."" I'm not buying it though. Dress the craftsmanship anyway you want, but I'm never taking this one back to my place."
"Notes: Like my review hints at, this beer is definitely nothing special. Me and my friend drank this because we had never heard of it before and we weren't even planning on getting a beer. After drinking it, we came to the conclusion that it had to be a BMC product, turns out, it is. If any beer makes you think that, it can't be too good."
"I was not very impressed with Beach Bum Blonde Ale. Compared to other summer season beers I've had (Sam Adams, Skinny Dip, Honey Moon, ect.) this one was just not up to par with the others. I found the flavor to be lacking. I really couldn't detect much flavor other than a poor aftertaste. There are better options if you want a summer beer."
"A pretty innocuous, but easy drinking blonde ale, nothing off-putting here, other than the lack of deliverance (heh) of the listed hop ingredients in the flavour profile. Also, I couldn't resist cracking this particular beer, after having Tree's Beach Blonde a few days ago - although I prefer the latter's imagery..."
"ETA: I actually rated OE8 HIGHER. And the rating was deserved in both cases."
"This rich ale pours golden with medium lacing, and though it doesn't offer anything too remarkable or unique, it does shine with a crisp maltiness that walks all over the usual summer lager lineup. More than drinkable, Beach Bum would be an ideal middle-point for an inexperienced drinker (or seasoned lager fan) to be gently swayed into the wide and wonderful world of ales. Decent enough."
"I was in gas station with a pretty limited selection. I looked over and saw this one so I took a closer look at the package. 23 IBU's got my attention. So I grabbed a 6 pack. Got home, poured it into a glass, got really stoked, and then I tasted it. Horrible! Another complete failure form the ""big boys"". Ill grab a Steel Reserve over this one next time."
" ~ Overall it's not bad. I would never pay for one in a tavern but I would select this over a Bud or Miller Lite."
"Pours to a straw yellow, with an ok head but nothing to write home about. Not a lot of smell to go by. There is a weak almost stale hops flavor, smooth, but has an aftertaste of hops and malt. It seems like it sticks to your tongue. Decent, but not one to go out of your way for."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a pale yellow color with a 1 finger white head that settled quickly into a light cap, no lacing left. The aroma is slightly of hops, some corn lingers. There is no major hop tastes as is ""advertised"" on the bottle. In fact this is a thin, over carbonated, slightly hopped version of a bud light. Not happy with it, but it was a single bottle purchase for the review so not too mad."
"Overall, this is a very boring beer and nothing I would ever buy. It just doesn't have a lot going on. Hardly any flavors, a lot similar to a macro. It is light, so it is somewhat drinkable."
"D: Good ABV, pretty easy on the tongue... Could drink a ton... But it just does not make you excited... little on a flat side.... It is like a lighter side of Shock Top which is much better, it takes the Citrus all the way..."
"Overall, with the sour aftertaste and overcarbonated feel and smell, I wouldn't consider drinking more than two or three of these in one setting. However, for the summer heat, I would bring these out in favor of what other beers are self-proclaimed as royalty."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Well I don't know much about this style of beer, other than the small description here on Beeradvocate. This one was very refreshing, crisp & clean, Lager like really, Id say just about anyone can throw back a 6pack or more of this beer on a hot summer day, I certainly could. Not bad overall, but I would explore the style more before grabbing this brand, certainly look for better. Cheers to all!"
"D: Below ave. drinkability here, with the lemon pledge off flavors coming through making for a less then average finish. Would not reach for a second one, let alone consider a six pack or future purchase. Just did not go down as smooth as a summer blonde should, even with its watery nature. Very macro-like drink that starts off average and goes down hill from there. Wouldn't blame anyone for dumping this mid-way through, you just aren't going to get much out of this so why bother,"
"The beer isn't my favorite. Not quite a horrible beer as stated in some previous review. There just really isn't anything really special beer. I do agree with some of the after taste comments that were made though. I'm not quite sure what it is but I'm not a huge fan of it. Has ok smell and taste nothing that really jumps out. mouthfeel is of most marcros that role of the liquor stores daily. decently drinkable though. Not too impressed."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are better light alternative out there."
"really not that good at all, typical bud."
"Nikki"
"Dark yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is fruity.Taste is pineapple,citrus and malts.A pretty decent brew that goes down decently.It's nothing that will knock your socks off but still overall a pretty good experience.I probably would try again."
"Cheers!"
"Beach Bum Blonde Ale pours a pale golden color with a 2 finger head. Smells malty and sweet. Tastes good with smooth malty flavor which is a little on the sweet side. Finishes with very little hop flavor. This beer bring to mind the sweetness of a Red Stripe but it's quite better in flavor. Could be a fine session beer on a hot Southern day. I detect some metallic taste here but It's still fairly drinkable."
"There are some reviews on here that talk about the hops of this beer. Hops? Really? I'm not really sure how anybody tasted hops in this beer. They're non-existent. It is malty, but tastes really, really watery... which I expected once I saw the ""Anheuser-Busch"" label. There are actually some decent fruits, but it's a really weak presence. Not really a presence at all, actually. Really disappointing. I was hoping to cleanse the memory of Landshark Lager from my taste buds. Sadly, this just added to the disappointment. Haven't had good luck with new beers so far this weekend. Thank god for Dogfish Head 90 and Sam Boston Lager."
"A light golden color with carbonation bubbles. The smell is corn, caramel, malt and yeast. The taste is slightly hoppy with a hint of floral and pie. Can taste toasted malt. The mouth feel is thin and watery. No finish it is alright for a Budweiser beer."
"Pours a clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some spice. The taste is sweet, malty, and spicy. Medium body. Kinda drinkable, not too bad, but I've had better blonde ale's."
"Not to much else to mention, pretty good for lawn beer if you could get yourself to actually buy it."
"AB is moving in the right direction with this and its other seasonal brews."
"To me this is a crisp ale. Has a decent blond ale flavor with a bit of bitterness. it does taste just slightly watered down, (it IS from Anheuser-Bush...) I was definitely a bit skeptical at first due to it being released by a mega brewer but when my local store was selling it for $2.99 a 6-pack i bought a case and was impressed with its overall taste. it's refreshing, crisp, and has good flavor. this is one of the better mega brewer lighter beers I've had."
"Out of the bottle this A-B product looked surprisingly good. White head one finger head that retained well and laced in sheets atop a bright yellow liquid. The aroma was semi-sweet, lemon and sugary malt. The flavors were subdued but not unpleasant. A basic balance of malt and hops with a slightly astringent quality and no outstanding characteristics. The mouthfeel was fine, medium body and generally refreshing. Just an easy going, non thinking entity, like the blonde surfer on the label. It wasn't not good but it was too lackadaisical to actually call it bad either. This beer was simply beer and you could drink it if you like."
"I don't know if the month of extra time did anything to the beer, but if so, it couldn't have been anything negative. This is a great, refreshing summer beer, and I must certainly commend the boys at A-B for mixing this one up."
"Mouthfeel is rather boring and watery. It's a drinkable beer in that it's unoffensive, but it's certainly not good."
"Drinkability is ok, this is a lawnmower beer - nothing to seek out. Ok but not memorable."
"Another attempt by the big guys at craft beer. So far I haven't tasted anything by these guys that is worthwhile at all."
"I like this beer. After the head settles down a bit it has a great dempled lace floating. Taste is that of a sweet pale ale. It resembles the Michelob Pale Ale but is certainly sweeter. With all this sweetness it still tastes very well balanced. Actually, the hops are the first thing I noticed. However, it got progressivly sweeter after that. It's a great beer to drink on a chilly, late summer night. Like I said, I like it. And incase you were wondering, yes, I know that it is made by AB. Cheers!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- easy to put these down. If bud man wants to spice up his beer life it would be good for them. A decent brew from anny!"
"There are certainly numerous better ""summer"" beers available. Not a beer I would drink again given other options."
"Notes: No complaints here AB or not. Reminds me of Brooklyn Summer Ale."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a thick head on a golden body. There was a nice, surprising sweetness to the smell which was, sadly, nowhere to be found in the taste. Instead had an icky dustiness, and a poor, coating aftertaste. Fairly boring, actually, but I didn't have very high hopes to start with given the maker."
"D - This is a pretty good gateway beer I kind of like this pseudo craft from AB it has a decent taste thats refreshing for summer good to get if your at a bar that only has BMC products"
"Nothing great, nothing bad. Easy to drink and moderately flavorful."
"D: For what it is, it's drinkable. It's not bad on a summer day being that it has a thirst quenching effect."
"Poured on tap into a 22 oz mug. Pours a light golden color with a light head that did not last. All I can really smell is a light spice with a citrus aroma. The taste is very light again with the citrus and spice, but a dry hop taste comes through at the end. The taste isn't bad I was just hoping for more taste. The beer has a nice feel to it as it is not to light or heavy with the carbonation and is easy to drink as a summer time beer."
"Recommended..."
"D - I KNOW I COULD DEFINATELY DRINK A LOT OF THIS BEER IN THE SUMMER MONTHS."
"D : It's not bad for a hot summer day but there's other ones I'd pick over it."
"Not as bad as I expected,but once one has had a taste of good beer why even bother with gimmicky stuff like this. I tried it because it was free and I really hoped that AB would finally deliver a true hit,not to be. Try again. End of story."
"There's cheaper, more drinkable beer available. Stay away from this crap. It might be a blonde ale, not at all comparable to a Kolsch and more similar to an American macro lager."
"So this is what it tastes like to mix Val Deiu with water because if that is what Anheuser-Busch was going for they have suceeded. It is definitely a blonde looking ale with the gold and the cloudiness but that about it. Smells of sweet grains and corn from the school cafeteria. Tastes, well like a perfectly good Val Deiu shaken up and diluted with toilet water. The fact I got this on tap at a dirty bar in Fort Myers with that being their ""special seasonal"" says it all."
"eh. ah, um, er, shucks. *burp* It is a beer. Confidant of that. Nothing offending. Much. Better than nothing, I guess. Think I have to trim my toe nails now. Oh, that's right, this beer. Clear, yellow, somewhat fizzy. Beery, a littlle bittersweet. Forgetful. Some head and lace at least."
"My advice is to avoid this one unless you like over-priced, bland beer like Corona."
"Draft in Denver airport- Medium gold pour with little white quickly fading head. Smell is very light of sweet malts, and it somehow almost even smells watery. Taste is fairly smooth and crisp, with a hop bitter bite up front that lasts, followed eventually by a little sweet finish. Nothing spectacular. More bitter than expected but without any hop flavor to go with it really. Simple bitterish cheap easy drinking beer that I wouldn't go out of my way for or recommend."
"Got this at a wing joint in Chesapeake. Was on tap so I ordered it and was greeted w/ one-finger head that receeded and didn't leave lacings. The body is a light golden color, nothing spectacular. There is some faint citrus/yeast picked up in the smell, and that is what it tasted like. For a blonde ale I expected there to be more malt or more hops in it for that little bit of extra taste/dryness. This was just watery and more of a American Pale Wheat Ale since it was really smooth and citrusy in my mouth. I'd have a couple of these for a dollar draft now and then, but nothing to buy a 6-pack for."
"D - Probably pretty decent, I could do a sixer. I remember trying this on tap when this year's batch was released and not enjoying it nearly as much, probably dirty lines. I'm glad AB brews the seasonal beers, they're not bad, and they ensure (in my area at least) that there will always be something other than a water lager to drink when I'm in a mainstream locale."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"D- Would be easy to pound down a few, but the taste is not good enough to. Light on the stomach, and not bad. I just would not want this to be the beer I supply for my friends at a tasting party or anything."
"From a 12 oz bottle this was very mild and light yellow. Light white head with almost no lacing. Nose of mild citrus and a very light mouthfeel. Flavor very light malts and a touch of hops. Actually one of the better brews from AB, but still pretty plain and average."
"Thank you God for putting this on pallet special at Wal-Mart right before my football party. This beer was at the appropriate price of $2.60 a six pack. Also it kept everyone away from my Dead Guy on draft. Perfectly placed in a bucket of ice outside in our football theatre. I obviously tried to say really nice things about this malt liquor"
"No smell to it and tasted similar to a Budweiser Light to me, just with more alcohol"
"This beer has decent initial head that fades very very quickly. Has a nice pale malt smell, with faint hops. Taste is a little one dimensional and lack luster, but it makes the beer drinkable. A decent summer ale. Worth a try, but I fancy other summer ales more. Not a lot to say about the flavor profile. Not a whole lot going on."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a light, clear golden color with a thin, bubbly, white head. Smell is nothing overpowering, mostly slightly sweet maltiness with just a hint of citrus. The taste is also pretty much all malt too but there is a slight spiciness about it and moderate hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly velvety with a modest carbonation. A decently drinkable brew, not the greatest out there but I do have to salute AB for ""expanding their horizons""."
"A decent beer overall and drinkable, but nothing worth seeking out."
" .. I will take a lemon with me if i need refreshing!"
"Some better hop aroma and flavor would make this a respectable summer session beer. One of A-B's better efforts among their recent micro-attempts."
"Not the best blonde I've had, but, very decent. Nice job AB."
"D: This beer does seem pretty drinkable since it is a nice, light, refreshing, summer beer. Unfortunately, it is more alcoholic than malty, which takes away from its decent body and mouthfeel."
""
"I still would say either is worth a try."
"An OK drinkable beer but not one I can see buying again. Basically this is Michelob in ale form. Worth trying once I guess but I really can't see picking this over a Michelob Lager if this was one of the meager choices."
"All and all, not too bad for a AB product. Happy they are trying more craft beers."
"Beach Bum Blonde Ale pours golden yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a very mild, sweet aroma. This beer is more flavorful than I would have expected from AB, especially in a blonde ale. Hops in particular are more prominent than I would have expected. Mediocre, but better than expected."
"The beer is a yellow a gold color with a thin white head that quickly fades away. The smell, though light, has some pale malt along with a light hop aroma. The taste is good. There is a nice balance of pale malt flavor and finishes with a light hop taste. The mouthfeel is light bodied with good carbonation. Clean tasting, easy to drink. This is a pretty good blonde ale. Another one designed to be light, refreshing and easy to drink."
"Golden pour without much head. Kind of thin mouthfeel. Not much lacing on glass. Fruity taste, not heinous like most A-B products, but nothing memorable about it either. Smell was fruity as well, the smell was actually better than the taste. A-B should probably stick to making crappy pale lagers."
"This plays very well off some buffalo chicken pizza .. I had a couple of these out of a 6er a few days ago, and when I started eating the pizza tonight I knew I had to have one of these blondes in between and then with a slice. I think it would match any spicy food, it tastes more malty when enjoyed with spicy food."
"D: Believe me, I am a fan of Budweiser and not afraid to say it. I think Anheuser-Busch makes mass quantities of respectful beer. However, the Beach Bum was simply that, a bum. Not impressive and not something I plan on trying again. I am curious to still try their other seasonal brews though."
"This corny beer is corny. Light bodied and somewhat refreshing despite the corn flavor. Did I mention that this beer has a lot of corn character?"
"The beer pours a gold color with a thin white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light and refreshing pale malt scent along with a light hop aroma. It appears crisp and clean. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down very easily and finishes clean with a light hop taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good blonde ale. It's nothing too incredible, but it's an easy drinker. I'm glad to see AB taking a stab at different styles."
"Drinkability- Alright maybe a little refreshing. Even though kind of drank like a winter beer."
"Overall a decent ale. Tastes very much like Michelob - perhaps with ale yeast."
"I didn't know this was an A-B product, and I must tip my hat to them--I really enjoyed this beer and would not mind having it again. Definitely not a macro-lager, this is a well-made blonde ale!"
"Thanks to Pegasus for the karma point."
"Drinkability, sure, a good summer offering with a at home summer label"
"The beer has a fruity smell and great fruit flavor. The hops help with the fruit aroma but there is not enough KICK to keep it going. The beer loses some steam after room temp hits it. This is a great summer beer and is definitely better on draft than in the bottle."
"Served fresh from the brewery on tap. Poured into a sample glass, approx. 8 oz., a clear golden yellow with a foamy white head that has decent retention. Aroma is fruity along with some floral hops and a touch of pine as well. Taste has a nice fruity pressence also. Pretty clean and refreshing beer. Not an exciting style, but a nice representation. Pretty solid effort from AB. This should be their flagship beer marketed to the masses."
"12 ounce bottle, ""born on date"" of May 13, 2007. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear bright gold color with an inch white head. Head retention is low, but lacing is good. It smells like sweet malt and some grassy hops. It tastes like sweet malt, lemon, bread and grassy hops. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a good bit of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it goes down smooth and is easy to drink. Not a bad summer beer at all, it's nice and refreshing. I'd buy it again."
"Inoffensive and clean. Nothing ""bad"" about it, clean and inoffensive, though boring. Typical/average for the style. I didn't realize that it was made by A-B until finished with it, and I do have to say that for the brewery and style, it's okay and decent enough to wash down a burger with, but even still, not worth seeking out and it is rather bland."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability: Let's thank AndoBrew and give him a big ""Surf's Up!"" for bringing this by."
"AB's Beach Bum Blonde Ale pours a finger of foam over a clear gold brew. The foam collapses pretty quickly despite the steady carbonation. The nose is light malt, the flavor is sweet malt with a bit of corn in the mix, and a ghost of an herbal hop finish. The mouthfeel was thin and crisp. Not an awesome brew by any means, but quite pleasant anyway. A good session brew for sure."
"Recommended"
"Are we tired of these underwhelming summer beers or what? Pours with the typical creamyish Anheiser head....and typically dissapears quickly like a sober prom date. The problem here is one that plagues many mass produced seasonal offerings...the flavors come off as artificial and unpleasant....instead of natural and complentary. There is a lemon sweetness here that tastes like somebody dropped a yellow SPREE in my bottle. No hops to be detected....some strange florals here....again...they just don't taste natural.. As I move on to a second one.... I leave it three-quarters full and crack a High Life with a HUGE smile on my face. Leave this one for the real bums... There is a local offering that isn't much better....but IT IS better....Terrapin Golden Ale(6.99/6)...We'll call it 'LESS' artificial tasting."
"Overall, I would put this AB season as second place behind the pumkin ale. I dont find anything that i hate about it, but little that i like from it. I think it is more drinkable than the regular offerings from bud, and could be a safety beer if that is all they serve, but i could never imagine getting a six pack of this and enjoying it within a day or two."
"Overall, this is not really a step up from most macros..and I'd actually take a fair number of macros over this."
"Golden in color with a small white head. Citrusy and slightly hoppy aroma. Clean malty flavor with a hint of hop bite to it. Somewhat lemony flavor with a touch of spice. Ok body-quite thin and along the lines of a macro. I find this to be quite a nice summer's beer overall Very refreshing and drinkable. The guy in the store said something about it originating in Atlanta and being sold to AB? Got me but it is a decent effort. A bit pricey though I think it was mis- marked once I checked my receipt."
"nice clear golden color with a three finger white frothy head that holds well and a fair amount of lacing. slightly fruity aroma. taste slightly bready and yeasty with a grainy hop finish. mouthfeel light and carbonation is good. to plain jane for me needs some spice to kick it up much better beer out there."
"I am surprised at how enjoyable this one was overall. The Anheuser ""craft brews"" are all decent for the most part, but I'd say that this one has been the cream of the crop for them with their craft stuff. It doesn't have a wow factor, but it is more than solid all around and simply a tasty refreshing brew. Recommended."
"Light bodied, smooth and easy to drink, a nice summer cooler that should go well with grilled meat or barbecue."
"Beach Bum Blonde Ale was a clear golden color with a white head. The head was medium size and had decent retention with a little lacing. The aroma was light hops with some sweet malt. The taste was spicy hops with some light malt and a dry finish. It was crisp and refreshing with a light body and plenty of carbonation. Drinkabity was good. Overall it was a decent summer beer."
"this one screams to be paired with some summer barbeque or picnic food. and it also can be used to turn your macro swilling friends onto to slightly more adventurous fare. and i'm sure it would be one that would be ok to drink out of the bottle."
"Note: A/B has 4 seasonal sudo-craft brews, 3 of which I have tried, and they're pretty decent beers. This particular one is my favorite so far."
"Pours clear and light gold -- a very pretty color -- with no head, only a collar of foam around the top of the beer. Aromas are of light, slight grainy malts with just a touch of corn in the background which is not off-putting. Fresh, continental hop smell mixed with minor strawberry esters. Nice. On the palate, the flavors are well balanced, with brisk, straightforward bitterness first off, felt on the sides and back on the tongue, followed by a growing graininess through the mid-palate and culminating in a somewhat sweet finish with a flash of unripe pear at the very end, in the back of the throat. There are hops here for balance, but they don't add much in the way of flavor, aside from an airy taste at the beginning. Mouthfeel is light in malts and heavy on carbonation. Overall, this beer is pretty good -- one of the better AB craft attempts, IMO. It should be enjoyed cold, as it falls apart a bit at warmer temperatures, but it accomplishes its intended purpose (being a thirst quenching, light and simple beer) well."
"It's fresh and clean and bright, very well-balanced, and remarkably drinkable with an easy going charm and enough hop character to keep you coming back for more. I'd gladly enjoy a few of these with friends at a BBQ, camping trip, or sports event. ...Worth trying, despite the label ;)"
"Poured a thin looking orange brown. White head that dissolved almost instantly and nearly flat. Nose had a hint of citrus to it but no more than a whisp. Flavor was subdied as if drinking through a coffee filter. Very flat in flavor. Some very mild wheat. Any citrus I could smell was not present in the flavor. Light body without much of a finish. Still very easily drinkable but a bad take as a craft beer. I am glad my friend brought this six-pac over to share because I would have disappointed if I paid cash for it."
"Overall impression: Not bad - certainly drinkable enough, and I would take this over a normal Bud any day. This might be a savior in a BMC bar."
"Pours a clear gold. Head poured about 1/2 inch with dense bubbles, then quickly (< 1 minute) dissipated to a film. Some lacing. Only a mild, sweet smell to this, but not unpleasant. Taste has more of the same: a mild sweet flavor. I, too, tasted lemon toward the finish of this beer (finish of the taste--that is--not the finish of the bottle). The hops in this one came off less like citrus-hoppy and more like citrus-citrusy. It could be me or there may be some actual lemon in this beer backing the hops. Either way, they were very much a background flavor. It may have been the glass of the particular way I was drinking this beer, but all the carbonation seemed to settle toward the back of my tongue."
"Golden colored beer with a largish pure white head. Aroma very weak, what there is suggests lagerish hops. Lightly malty flavour, semi-sweet, a small, very small amount of lemony hop right at the end. Thin and no after taste. Overall not a good beer or even a good blonde. But cant say if I was at a neighbours grill-out i would refuse it."
"Pours a golden color, darker than your standard Busch macro beer by a couple of shades. I see VERY little carbonation, I can practically count the bubbles and i'd only need one hand! The head disappeared almost instantly with almost no lacing or collar. There is a very faint sweetish aroma. Taste is a very weak, kinda lemony bitterness. There's a grassy dryness on the finish, with a thin, watery mouthfeel. I REALLY wanted to like this beer for some reason, but I can't give it a thumbs-up by any means. I bought a single @ Total Wine & More in Claymont, DE, and i'm glad i didn't shell out the money for a sixer. An EXTREMELY weak attempt by Anheuser-Busch. With their resources, they can do much better than this! Or can they?"
"Not great, a below average blonde. Too much of the malt is sugary grain, with no translation towards body or complexity of flavor."
"12oz bottle from Shaw's in Augusta. Light amber/dark yellow translucent body with a thin film of off-white head. Biscuit malt and European hops share the aroma, though the smell is far from overwhelming. Biscuit malt dominates the flavor with a hint of hops toward the finish. Rather watery on the mouthfeel, which helps the drinkability. Nothing overpowering or overly impressive, but a decent easy-drinking summer beer."
"This is a mighty quenching brew! It's got hops, man those things smell good! It even has some backbone with the malt. I'd have to say it's almost the blonde ale that strove to be a pale ale (except for the brightness). This is a great beer, for the $6.99 for the 6pk I got it for it's a good deal (being that the same place has Sam Adams and it's ilk for about $8). I'm sure that at $5.99 this beer is a steal."
"Looks like AB is intimidated by the micro brew market, so they are selling their own. It is obvious that AB will never go over the top on a beer, since they aim to make beer tasteless for the masses. This is a decent beer, but could potentially be better. I taste a little bit of sourness, and smell it as well. It claims to be all malt, and that probably makes it better than their rice beers. Slight citrusy flavor from orange, and not a bad summer session beer overall. Would probably go well with a burger from the grill."
"Saw this at a beer tent and had never heard of it before. I normally shy away from AB products but figured I would give it a shot. Poured was a pale golden yellow with a huge white head. The smell was actually ok, with hints of some fruitiness in there and a slight grainey toned. The flavor was actually, quite suprisingly good. This was not bad at all. Lots of light fruit with a big carbonated feel. Really a decent session beer and I was quite suprised by how good this actually turned up. AB may actually have something worth drinking here, will have to give it another try before I commit totally, but really not bad."
"The character on the label looks like Spicoli (Sean Penn) from the movie ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."""
"The taste is as it smells, but amplified a bit, a light body with a watery bitterness in the mouth that becomes dry in the finish. Moderate ABV and overall, could use improvement for this style...average at best."
"Not one I would buy."
"From notes (on tap at Grants Farm). Light golden hue, a thin white head forms around the plastic offering cup. Some light fruit offerings in the aroma departmentorange peel and lemon, tender hops are also to note. Crisp and light bodied, yet refreshingly satisfying. Grainy malts and light hops noted as well. Wisks of citrus flavorings, coupled with a touch of adjunct-like tastings. Starts out well, yet becomes boring; somewhat refreshing and cleansing on a hot, humid St. Louis afternoon."
"One of two House Brews served up at Fat Fish Blue in Cleveland. Utterly crisp, clean, and clear blonde brew with a fantastic hop finish. I was very impressed, largely because I expected garbage. Pared well with an exceptionally spicy steak. Body is light, drinkability is through the roof, and hops are of the herbal to spiced variety. Really, there are hops here. I am very surprised."
"D - It is a pretty descent blonde ale. I was quite impressed by this offering from A-B."
"Pours a clear strawish hue, with a soapy-dense two finger head. Decent retention but very light or no lacing. Mild vinous nose, a pinch of wheat and hints of pilsener malt- clean overall. Crisp pilsener malt upfront, slightly sweet. Dry white wine bite- pleasently acidic with mild but balanced german hop bitterness. Hoppy aftertaste like cascade with some mild rice flavor. High carbonation and light bodied- the crispness prevents the dry wine taste from overwhelming and it finishes mildy vinous with american hop notes. A very drinkable summer beer with a mellow but interesting character."
"Well....when I saw this on tap I was unaware it was an A-B product, so at least I wasn't swayed by that in the begining. My pint was yellow in color, clear and had a small head and had a slightly citrus/floral aroma. I thought the flavor was a little on the weak side, not really a blonde that stands out. There was a mild hop flavor and a touch of citrus with general sweetness throughout. Overall, I'd say find a different blonde if that is your thing..."
"Drinkability: There was something odd about this beer that I can not fully explain. While I had a couple of these and they drank like a macro (easy to pound down, light and refreshing), I just got tired of them. I guess I was easily bored by this beer. Probably not a good sign. Maybe worth a try if one comes across it, but not worth going out of the way for."
"This is brewed by AB, so I really wasnt expecting much. However, I had it on tap on the deck of a bar in St. Simons Island, on a 90 degree summer night, and must say I was pleasantly surprised by this summer brew. Poured to a golden orange with medium, off-white head and okay lacing. There was a slight citrus aroma, mostly grapefruit and lemons, which were more evident in the taste. The palate was smooth and long, and actually reminded me of a mild version of an IPA. Not a bad beer."
"I'm surprised this has anything to do with A-B considering the garbage they put out these days. This was a definite highlight."
"If you see a little ""beach bum"" surfer on a tap handle. It's Beach Bum Blonde Ale. And it is excellent. Taste good and it isn't overly filling so you can do a bit of chugging. The tint is a blonde heading to red, and is really something I like to have sitting in front of me. It smells good, tastes good and is easy to drink. I can't promise the same reviews for this beer not on tap, but on-tap--whew, grab a couple pints."
"This beer poured a golden clear with a thin head. The smell was faint and a bit malty. The taste was sweet and smooth with a touch of citrus. It has a medium body and a nice mouthfeel. This is a smooth and clean beer. Id consider this an easily drinkable American beer."
"Overall: Suprisingly decent offering from AB. Pretty good lite ale flavor. Worth a try if you see it somewhere."
"Overall- This is a very bad attempt at a Blonde. AB has millions of dollars and after all their R&D they realized their minions love cheap p!ss beer. So they did the inevitable produced yet another 1. Stay far away from this p!ss."
"Not sure I like the flavor of the bitterness, but there is a summer thirst quenching quality that is appealing enough."
"I had a ""test"" blonde ale earlier served by A-B brewmaster that had a nicer mouthfeel and more substantial taste - hope it did not bring this one down."
"Per AB website: Pale and caramel roasted barley malts. Hopped with imported Alsace and Hallertau hops, as well as Cascade hops. 5.4% ABV."
"Had this on tap at a bar in South Haven and I had no idea it was an Anheuser product until looking it up here. Bright clear yellow color with a thick foamy head that dissipates quickly and leaves no remnants of its being there. Aroma is somewhat spicy, almost tangy (like the juice) with a straight pale malt dryness. Taste is similar to aroma. I noticed an adjunct flavor that didn't dominate but it didn't leave the palate either. Slight spice and tang with a cereal like aspect. A bit muddled really and although not sweet, it seemed cloying by the end of the glass. Odd, not really enjoyable."
"I don't care if this is AB or not, I liked it and drank more than my share's worth at a 4th of July picnic. Right from the tap, this is just as good as anything I'd enjoy at a hot summer BBQ. Too much carbonation. Fresh hops and very drinkable, it's nothing I would buy a six pack of, my would always drink it if it's free, hot, and the other choices are limited."
"I personally did not enjoy this beer very much. It smelled of corn and looked just like a lot of AHB's macro swill. I thought it tasted like a mix between Miller High Life and Miller Genuine Draft, with a much more alcoholic aftertaste. I found the highly alcoholic to be a big turn-off. There was also a lot of carbonation, ala MHL."
"I ordered this one in Flordia with alligator tail thinkin it would be some cool local brewed beer. Only to find out it was simply a beer that they changes the name to and it was made my Anheuser Busch. Anyways I will never be drinkin this on the beach or anywhere else for that matter. It poured a light strawish yellow that was perfectly transcendent. Smelled very sweet and citrusy. Tasted far to lame and was a rather unenjoyable beer. While it did not taste bad it sinply did not taste unique or fun or complex. It was just straight up boring."
"On tap at Hemingway's Cafe' in Oakland, appears a clear golden tone with a white head that dwindles ratherly quickly leaves behind light lacing. Aroma has some fruity apple esters with more of tart spicy sweetness. Taste has a creamy sweetness with herbal hop flavor along with a spicy alcohol finish and a bit more of a tea leaf citrus blend going on. Mouthfeel is light bodied carbonation seems a bit fizzy still. Drinkability...well it's not what I'm going for especially for 4.50 a pint...glad I had a sample."
"Aroma is light but has perfumey hops that smell both fruity and floral. Almost has a coriander wit type aroma, but much less concentrated. Body is clear gold with a diminishing thumb thick head. Fore is lightly hopped, but the hops are floral and pleasant. Fairly watery, but this has some flavor. Big citrus kick in the middle and finish tastes like orange peel and orange juice and its fairly well hopped flavor wise for the style and especially for a Bud product. Has a fairly lagery flavor in the far finish that is grainy and malty sweet, but this is not at all a bad beer."
"The women in the household like it, so there ya gothumbs up for a good endeavor by AB."
"The lastest Bud attempt, I had to try it. Nice golden color but the head and any form of retention was lost right away no lacing. Smell is not bad, a good fruityness, a little peachy, and a touch of malt sweetness. I think the yeast they use in these special bud releases is not right the beer is ok with a decent depth of malt character and a little fruity esters but there is also some off that is bothersome. The body is probably a little too thick of all thing for a blonde, but I had two glass so it wasn't horrible. If you are curious ..."
"Not a terrible beer overall, but I wasn't impressed with it in all the categories- especially taste. I'd certainly choose this over bud or bud light though."
"I had to ask for a lemon, after refusing a lemon. I can normally get behind macros more so than a lot of BAs, because hey, they're still beer, but the particular mixture of cheap grained used by AB never works for me. This is one to avoid unless your only other options are Bud and Bud Light."
"Can someone over-think a beer? If so, this is quite possibly proof."
"Bought a pint at my favorite Lexington Bierstube upon the bartenders recommendation....she's an idiot. Graini-ness, watery-ness, astringency, and vegetable-ness is evident right from the get-go. Looks pilsner-ish with promising head retention that soon fell flat. The aroma is purely of wet grain hulls. Tastes lightly lemony above the adjuct grain flavors. Vegetal and apples also decorate the banal flavors. Feels astingent in the jaws from a lemon rind and stressed grain flavors. Finishes with a fleeting hurry except for the bite-ey hook-up in the back of the thoat. It makes Budweiser look pretty good."
"Overall a good offering from AB that I thought was above average. I would even go so far as to say that I would buy this packaged on occasion if it was ever offered as such."
"D- nice and crisp, but a bit bitter to slam"
"Okay taste, peach, apricot, wheat, very light hops little malt. Much more carbonated in the mouth than in sight nice and crisp. Definitely a session type of beer not much else."
"Drinkability: average at best. I think some of the other A-B offerings in this line of specialty beers are better. Give it a try, but this didn't do it for me when the bar has DFH, Smutty, and Victory as alternative choices."
