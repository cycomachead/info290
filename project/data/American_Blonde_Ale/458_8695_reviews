"Good. Happy I tried. Would not seek again, but I've seen it in spots where if I had to make choice---it would be my buy."

"O: Pretty good. Nothing special, but it gets the job done. Good with pizza. Not heavy, which is nice."
"I do not write reviews."

"Pretty fucking good. I'll drink it again.  (That's basically how every review should be)."

"Good beer but not great a great one"

"Pretty good blonde ale.  Very refreshing"

"Pours an almost clear, opaque deep straw, producing barely a finger of frothy, white, shortlived head that leaves only a thin wash & collar ring of lace. Aroma is weak & thin: light cracker malt with notes of grass, apples & maybe a little yeast. Taste is more substantial: sourdough bready, grain & biscuit malt, apple sauce & lemon & grass hints in a dry finish that yields a pale malt, hop bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is  light-medium bodied, moderately carbonated, crisp, prickle & dry. Overall a mediocre effort."

"Overall- This essentially seems like a tastier adjunct beer option, and it serves its purpose well. I would definitely get this as a substitute for bmc when out drinking. However, day to day this isn't worth putting in the rotation, especially with better beers within the style available. (79/100)"

"I wouldn't seek this out, although if at a Texas night spot that serves only Bud/ Coors/ Corona fare, and this one happens to be in the mix, still best to order this."

""
""
"O - Overall light and inoffensive, as you'd expect. I do believe it is an ale, but it is very reminiscent of an American light lager, with just a bit more body and taste than that."

"Highly carbonated, thin bodied. A step up from the macros but little else. Raw grain, lightly sour and whiff of hop essence best describes this beer. Refreshing on a hot day, but little else in terms of redemption."

"On draft this beer is smooth and creamy with a citrus, apricot flavor on the finish that is the perfect antidote to all the watered down domestic varieties available. From a bottle the Fireman’s #4 doesn’t have the creaminess of the draft version, but is just as tasty. I had this Fireman’s #4 on a late afternoon and it was just what I needed to tame the heat. While some pilsners can be light and bright, I found this blonde to be bigger and bolder. The Fireman’s #4 is surprisingly deep and full on the palate."

"12 oz bottle at Boiling Pot. Pours hazy golden with a short-lived white head. Aroma is of barnyard yeast, sour apple and pear notes with some mild citrus and grassy hops. Body is medium and crisp. Biscuit malt, some herbal hops and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finishes with some fruity flavors of apple and pears with some mild bitterness for balance, endind is slightly dry. Overall a nice refreshing session brew."

"This might be a good gateway beer only in that it's made by a company that also makes some great pale ales, a decent brown ale, a nice tripel and other decent stuff. Get somebody on this one and maybe they'd branch out to other Real Ale products. But the beer itself is only better than or different from the average BMC offering by a fraction."

"with a hardy grass and wheat malt. Simple but well balanced and pleasing. This is relatively light bodied with a very crisp feel. A flavorful choice for the style."

"As a Chicagoan, I never heard of this Texas brewery before nor had I tried any of their products, but if this is an example of what they have to offer, I'll be on the lookout for more of their stuff. This was a very good blonde ale."

"Overall not bad, very drinkable and a definite summer style beer, but overall flavors are a bit too light. However, with a beer like this any real off flavors would most likely come out quickly, and that didn't happen so that's a good sign."
""
""
""

"I am mostly a dark ale drinker, but this one surprised me. I had the Real Ale Brewhouse Brown Ale and enjoyed it. I thought I would give this a shot. It pours light with a a small head. very common for blonds. The smell is similar to a lager but with a hint of hops. The mouthfeel and taste is very refreshing with a hint of something sweet, maybe molasses. I would say this is a perfect summer blonde ale. I am interested to see what it would taste like in a beer batter or on a steak."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Fireman's is a well-crafted beer, but its flavor lingers which is the opposite of what I'm looking for in an American Blonde Ale. Still, it is frequently the best option on tap and I will continue to drink it."

"Very light amber body, good effervescence. Floral hops, a bit of breadiness in the nose. Taste mirrors aromas, a bit on the sweet side. Pretty good mouthfeel. Very sessionable, one of the easiest drinking beers on the trip. Would like to try the tap version again for comparison. Worth a try."

"I close my eyes, and I am back in the UK. This really reminds of many excellent bitters I had on cask in the UK. All around excellent. This says volumes about Real Ale as a brewery and Hay Merchant as an establishment. Both for making/serving this properly. Highly recommend on cask."
""
"Overall Impression- A very easy drinking Blonde but didn't have the characters I wish were present. More hops and fruit flavors could have popped up more for me. Still enjoyed as my first brew of this festival."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: decent blonde, just kind of a bland style for me, but very enjoyable and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just another good beer from Real Ale. This is just so easy to drink and has a very nice taste."
""
""
""
"The one thing I enjoy thoroughly about it is its nutty character. It has a grainy and lasting mouthfeel. It is in some ways similar to Real Ales Octoberfest when it comes to the nose. I love hopping back and forth between the two in a 22 oz mug, the wofts are euphoric, the warmer they get the better the stank. As the carbonation dies down the better the flavors come through. Real ale is underrated for sure, esp. if your a steady beer drinker. I like it, recommend it, and will drink it again. FYI its better than their rye, pale ale if your staring at the planogram and don't know which one to roll the dice on. Peace lkeys."
"Pours golden and slightly cloudy with a modest head with minimal lacing. Aroma of citrus, floral, and maybe a bit of yeast. Flavor is similar to aroma, very smooth, even somewhat creamy, with mild hop aftertaste. Nice, drinkable blonde ale but nothing special."
"O- I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It had a great flavor and a nice appearance. I look forward to drinking some more."
""
"It's beer. I drank it. End of post."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not something that I would go out of my way to have again but not something that I couldn't bring myself to finish either. I guess I would describe it as too average, there is a nice balance in the beer and the highlight for me is the hints of critrus."

"This is a summer drink and will help help during a long day outside."
"O - Not something I'd come back to personally. My boss on the other hand liked it quite a bit."
"O: Overall a very drinkable beer could drink a few of these, probably best with some BBQ on a hot day."
"Pretty smooth and easy-drinking, but the more malt-dominated blondes aren't my favorite."
"I’d consider this a gateway beer for people who aren’t familiar with craft beer or for those hooked on BMC. For the rest of us it’s an excellent example of a quality craft beer’s approach and the difference it makes. I’d pair this with pizza, nachos, grilling outside and—if it was canned—tubing down the Guadalupe. (At least until beverages are officially banned on the river!) As far as blond ales go it’s a winner."
"This was a decent beer. It had kind of a sweet, honey flavour to it. It was otherwise fairly bland. Highly drinkable, not exciting. Probably not worth the price for that bracket. It had kind of a sticky mouthfeel."
"O: I guess if it's a light, summer/lawn mower type beer you're looking for this works. Not my thing, though."
"nice sensation on mouth, balanced"
"M: It was crisp and enjoyable and the only reward to the not so enjoyable taste."
"No where near my favorite craft brew- but it is very consistent. would be a good 'starter beer' for someone jumping off the main stream wagon. Not bad at all, but not great."
" Overall it was a little bitter to be a real sessionable ale, . Nothing really standing up and greabbing you about this one."
"Overall-I bought a single but it's 6.99 for a 6pk. It's affordable, above average, but not going to knock your socks off. Maybe the best year round beer from Real Ale(which isn't saying much)."
"A clear pale yellow with a thin white head. Smells of lemon and a hint of grain. Taste is a hint of sweetness, followed by a tobacco and grassy hop middle and finish. Very similar hop profile to a California Common I brewed that utilized northern brewer hops. Average mouthfeel and carbonation. Overall a decent beer. Refreshing and non offensive."
"O: A pretty good summertime beer. Not my favorite but one I would by again at it's price point."
"overall: a great beer for the summer. very refreshing, and at a great price, one i go back to quite often. This is one of the Texas beers converting BMC drinkers into craft drinkers."
"Stuck in the airport of austin linger than I would like to mention. Can't beat em, drink the local beer. This was tasted from a bottle so take that into account. Appearance was a bottle so towed the lone and said it is good. Smell is pretty malty as is taste, but a nice blonde overall. Good earthy notes, easy drinker and good blonde in general."
"Overall Drinkability - Enjoyable beer withs ome off flavors that don't do much to diminish the overall enjoyability."
"Pale apricot colored with a firm beige head that lingers long and leaves sheets if jagged lace up the sides of the glass. No aroma. Even flavor of breast malt, slight corn and grassy notes. Even mouthfeel, full and creamy. Tasty beer, not overly complex."
"This is a well made blonde ale, perfect for inclusion in the ""lawnmower beer"" category. It's nothing special, but sometimes you want just a plain ol' beer to ground your tastebuds in reality, and this would definitely fit that bill."
"From a trade with gawnphishin. Thanks!"
"Drinkability: This is one of those beers you can drink one after another without worrying about missing out on the flavors. Startlingly smooth and simple."
"The body is light and slick, which is par for the style. Drinkability is aided well. Easy to consume. Decent enough flavors. What I got in the nose, didn't carry over to the flavor, thankfully. There's some light malts, buttered bread, corn, rice noted. Light bitterness. This is an easy-drinking beer if there ever was one. Perfect for the grilling-season."
"Got this in a trade with Depechemode1983 along with a slew of other Real Ale beers. This was the first one I tried and it didn't knock my socks off, but it is a well made, easy going ale. Fireman's #4 poured a transparent golden straw color with a good bit of carbonation running through it. The 1 finger white head stuck around for a short while then receded to a film. The smell is of grains and a little bit of hops. Taste is similar, you get the grain in the front and it finishes with the hops. Mouthfeel is a little thin and bubbly for what I prefer in a golden/blonde ale. Drinkability is good. If you want to give something of much greater quality than their usual to your BMC friends, this is a good first step. Also, I think I honestly would have enjoyed this beer more in Texas, because a rainy Oregon winter doesn't bring out the better qualities of this beer."
"D - Extremely drinkable. This is a good beer to have while cooking outside on a hot day."
"Bready, biscuit, slight caramel. Hop bitterness is light-medium, mainly spicy noble hops, a little lemony. I taste some fruitness towards the end. Finish is crisp and semi-dry. Body is light-medium, refreshing, sessionable, well carbonated."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a tiny bit of a white head and not much else. The aroma doesn't bring much forward, just some light grain and a bit of yeast. Taste is mild grain flavors without any real yeast or any other characteristic. Really clean; I guess that's about the only compliment I have here. Goes down smoothly as well, I suppose."
"This was a competent, enjoyable blonde whose only real weakness was its appearance (which isn't really all that important after all). Flavor is a blend of light, sweet malts with a slight toast grain edge and a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. Aroma is simple and inoffensive grassy and pale malt blend. Mouthfeel is thicker and fuller than your average macro swill with a robust body and lingering earthy and grassy finish. Appearance is a pale, unfiltered golden cloud with minimal head produced by a vigorous pour. An average, enjoyable blonde, thanks to whoever sent me this!"
"This is a great sessionable beer, very refreshing."
"The beer pours a hazy straw yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat, lemons and grassy hops. The flavor is lemons, wheat, grass and biscuit malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very drinkable. Not too exciting, but there is nothing wrong with the beer."
"D: Goes down easy, no flaws to speak of."
"It was not full flavored enough to keep me going back. I would drink this at a bar while in TX if it were on special. I paid $4.75 for a pint and it was not worth it. If Real Ale was going for something that ""Light Beer"" drinkers could handle then they succeeded. To me this beer seemed to go for mass appeal and I would recommend this as a much better alternative to people use to the adjunct lager scene."
"I don't disagree with the band-aid smell comment from another reviewer. I would say that the taste was very thin. I want to the rhe Ila right after and I think that this beer made that beer taste better... and unerring rated quality I might add. This beer is fine foe a hot summer day but more than two in a session would get on my nerves."
"D-not a good beer, maybe infected; but problems all over. medicinal and under carbonated."
"Drinkability: The low ABV and great mouth feel make this an incredibly easy beer to drink. The nose and palate, seem right in line with the style, although it's not my favorite."
"Yeah, as noted before the taste is remarkably stronger than the aroma. Biscuity and slightly hopped even. Definitely pretty good and very drinkable. Solid blond ale, glad I got to try it again!"
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer however the flavors weren't robust enough to be anything more than that."
"Flavor matches the aroma well, with a bit more hoppiness/fruitiness on the front of the tongue. Malts are slightly grainy and taste of bleached bread dough and wheat. A slightly hoppy aftertaste fits the style well, but it was the clean profile of this brew that really impressed me, as it washed down the hot wings well. Body is light and nicely-carbonated. Overall a tasty brew by Real Ale. Not quite up to Southern Star's Blonde Bombshell, but it's a distant second. I'd easily have this again, but probably only on-tap, and probably only when the other options are all macros (as was the case today)."
"Its a light bodied beer, with a low bitterness in the aftertaste. This is a great beer. and I was able to drink 4 in one sitting... so this serves for a good drinkability."
"Admittedly this one of my favorite beers so my review is biased. Pours with a lighten golden color, minimal head. Transparent body. Has a smell of malts with traces of citrusy fruits. Taste is very smooth with a high amount of carbonation along with the fruits. Very easy beer to drink, has a light beginning and ends with a crisp bite. Not overpowering and a wonder to drink."
"Had from a bottle from grocery store. Pore clear gold, excellent carbonation. Exactly how the style should look. Aroma is malty, sweet, no noticable hop aroma. A great beer from a day on the patio. If it were available in cans, would be my go-to lake/beach/river beer. Accessable to beer drinkers of all types - this is what I give my friends when only craft beer is available and they are BMC drinkers."
"Once more, a thin, bone-white head that dissipated into wisps even prior to arrival. Color was lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a grainy, silage-like scent. Interesting! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a slight peppery taste on the tongue. Finish was dry and refreshing."
"Good mouthfeel, nice carbonation, overall very drinkable and a great beer for the people who dont like stronger/darker beer."
"D- Could be an easy summer cook out session beer."
"D: I had two glasses and enjoyed them both. This seems like a good fallback beer if I'm playing pool (which I was) and there wasn't anything great on tap (which there wasn't)."
"A very smooth drink and something I would enjoy at a bar. Definitely a beer to suggest to first time beer drinkers, and a beer to take to gatherings."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" bright white head over the clear light golden brew. Airy head collapses at reasonably quick pace, with minimal lace. Aroma is sweet pale and prominent vegetal. Taste is dominantly pale malt sweetness, with the earthy hops towards the end. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is okay as well. This one could be better."
"D: If you are looking for a beer that you can pound, this will do nicely. There is nothing that sets this apart from the blonde crowd, though."
"Golden, clear. head dissapates quickly. medium carbonation. this is my 1st blonde ale, so I have no others to compare it to. it reminds me of a witbier which is not my favorite. a little too much fruit. finishes clean and is easy to drink. malty with only the slightest hint of hops."
"A sessionable beer, but not one with a lot of complexity."
"Not bad at all for a Blonde. Decent balance and a softer body on this made for a refreshing quaff. Good summertime beer."
"Tastes more complex than it smells. More like a Kolsch than a blonde, peat and mineral nodes pleasantly accentuate very pale malt. Light, dry hops finish things out."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thin head. Leaves some lacing. Smells faintly of banana and noble hops. You can taste the banana as well. It's has medium carbonation and a creamy but clean finish. Theres some hop bitterness there as well, which serves to clean the whole thing up a bit. The finish is slightly dry - which contributes to the overall drinkability of the beer. I've had this on bottle before and didn't like it as much; on draft you can taste a lot more. It's one of the most sessionable beers I've had in Texas"
"A honey yellow pour with an already faded head, leaving a good bit of empty space in the pint (note to Ginger Man). There's a spotty lacing all around. Smells of malts, a bit of grass, and some faint hops. Tastes of sweet malts, some honey and subtle, almost undiscernible light fruits. I'm a big Real Ale fan, but this one could use some work."
"Fireman's #4 pours into the glass hazy (unfiltered) blonde with a wisp of yeast which all sits underneath a frothy white cap of foam. Simple nose of grain, yeasty fruit, and little to no hops detected. Flavor is a bit citruisy than the nose and yields a nice hop finish. For those of you who are new to craft beer, pick this up when you see it. Nice, nice balance - boil some crawfish and don't forget Fireman's #4. This will be a staple in my fridge all spring and summer."
"everything has been good session beers so far."
"Do not recommend this one again..."
"D: Drinkable, but I won't be having again."
"Easy to drink but smell was quite off."
"Pours from the bottle a golden yellow with a full two fingers of white head; bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass throughout the life of the beer. Smell is mostly malty with some citrus and pepper to make things a bit more interesting. Fireman's #4 tastes a bit bready and fruity with just a hint of hops in the finish. On the whole, the beer is crisp and light, and a nice local offering to enjoy during warm weather. This -is- a blonde ale... you can't ask too much more from the style."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with a thin white head that sticks around as a nice ring and provides some nice lacing. Smell is malty and earthy with a little fruit. The taste pale malts with a slight hint of earthy hops. There isn't much going on with this one. Its not too thin but not a lot of body. The drinkability is good but not spectacular. I would like a little more flavor and body."
"Fairly drinkable brew, I like it. This is my second real ale brew and I've been impressed so far. I was somewhat surprised by the fairly low reviews for this one on here, but I like it."
"Pours a golden clearish colored body, with a smallish head, off-whitish in color. Has a bitter aroma, some hops, a medium strength aroma. A weakish bitter malty taste, but balanced. Somewhat sweet. Reminds me of an IPA maybe."
"A nice beer for a change of pace from my usual IPA's and barleywines. This beer is becoming very easy to find in Texas."
"Overall I wasn't really impressed by this beer. I had heard good things about it, but I ended up being disappointed."
"The beer is very light bodied and has a small bitterness in the aftertaste. This is a well balanced beer that would go good with almost any meal."
"D&Notes: I used to drink this beer a lot more on tap here in Austin, but for some reason haven't done so as much recently. It's a shame, as this is actually a very good, simple brew. It basically tastes like a full bodied macro lager that used ale fermentation to give it the distinctive esters you don't get w/a cold, bottom fermented lager. This would be a great brew to give to a macro only drinker, to introduce them to the world of craft beer. It also has enough character to give to an experienced beer lover if they desire a simple, refreshing ale."
"Drinkability - Overall a good session beer. I have been known to drink my share of Fireman's on hot summer days :-)"
"It's watery and light bodied."
"Summation would be: Not great, but not bad either."
"single from mhewes in Pre-Season Football BiF...notched as best by December"
"This is a solid session beer, IMO. Not much in the way of taste, but good none the less."
"The taste isn't all that impressive. It's just a little too generic for this style. But it's not a bad taste. Overall, this is a very good drinkable beer. But don't expect anything to knock your socks off."
"Apparence was pretty good with a light pale gold colour with virtually no head retention and no lacing. Scent and taste was weak with some really odd flavours that I could not quite place. I finished the beer, however not one that I would purchase on my own."
"nice and light flavor that seams to be based on the yeast in this beer. smels kind of sour but the smell lies because i dont taste soure in this one at all, i dont tast any hops in this one eather, this is a nice drinking light flavor beer that i would drink agan for sure"
"Drinkability for this one is low in my view. I'll pour this beer out and probably won't seek this one out again - brought it back with me from my trip to Texas."
"A descent mouthfeel and not the least bit heavy heavy on my palate. If in a bind and this was on a list, I would drink this beer over just about anything else especially in a macro sense. Nice effort for a go to beer from the folks in Blanco!"
"D- I could drink these for hours but would pair with food because there isn't a whole lot of flavor. Although ABV% is not listed I assume it is between 4%-5%."
"Drinkability - very sessionable and a great summer pick. Thanks to BGThang for sending me a few of these, put to good use in some August heat."
"I had this beer with a #7 on the menu. It was worth the money, and anyone who goes to Katz's should try this...If you like good beer, you will not be disappointed in the least"
"mouthfeel is carbonated, crisp, sweet and has a great weight, very nice!"
"Other than a lack of head formation and a lackluster nose, Fireman's #4 is good beer. Since the final three attributes are far more important to me than the first two, the overall score is not a reflection of how I really feel about this Real Ale ale. I'd drink it again."
"Very pale yelloe hazey color with one finger tight white head that hung in there pretty well. Smells of grainy and sweet malts, some grassy and spicey hops and a white grape/green apple sent. Taste is bpretty smooth with a good malt flavor with more hop hit than advertised in the nose and the aftertaste is that grape/apple that I smelled. Its nice on the mouth if light and has a good dry finish, certainly sessionable."
"M/D: Definitely a quaffer if I've ever had one. Carbonation is perfect and a great combination with spicy dishes."
"Drinkability is about average. Seems sessionable but flavors are uninspiring."
"D- Its giving me heartburn, but i really like it..."
"D - quite easy to drink. great for when the sun is still up."
"D: I can see why this doesn't get better reviews; it seems kinda bland, boring. I liked the subtleties and enjoyed the malty, fruity flavor and aroma - a good version of this Kolsch-like style. Easy to drink, relatively light body and fine to sip on a spring-like day.."
"Poured a hazy straw with a big white head that disappeared in the time it took me to turn back around. No lacing. Aroma is really weak. There is a faint, malty sweetness but absolutely nothing distinct. Taste is much the same. There is nothing great, but nothing memorable either. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly dry. It's definitely drinkable. Had a whole lot worse beers then this one."
"As crappy as my review is, I still very much appreciate hopsleeroy for this brew. Thanks Lee, this is only my 2nd Real Ale BC beer.. Now.. on to the Sisyphus."
"A solid middle of the road brew, would make good session beer or an outstanding lawnmower if it was cheaper."
"Overall impression: Very basic beer, but for a blonde, its pretty good."
"The drinkability is good not a bad beer at all, Prosit. MK"
"D: Easy."
"Beer was fairly clear, a light straw color with a small thin head. The aroma was of very light malt, with no hop aroma evident. Taste was about the same, a little malt, slightly grainy with not much else evident. Mouthfeel was thin and watery. Overall, I didn't care for this one, it needed more of some type of character - malt - hops - something."
"Prosit!"
"Draft at Billys in Austin. Slightly cloudy yellow color, similar to some hefeweizens. Light smell of corn, malt, and spices. Similar taste, with a little hearty corn like malt taste followed by some light coriander-ish spice. Mild, easy drinking beer. Almost like a light hefeweizen. Nothing to write home about, but a decent simple beer."
"As for drinkability, i can see drinking this in the hot summer in AZ (or texas where it is made) as a lawnmower beer or something, but certainly not one i would seek out again."
"Cloudy straw color with minimal head. The nose is of light malts and subtle banananess. Initially it is hop forward (seems like a saaz-type), followed by a malty backbone with a timid amount of cloves. Tastes better than it looks. There is some substance to yet it is very light and refreshing. Becomes kind of bland as it warms so drink quickly. Special thanks to RickSawyer for this beer."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not very filling, not the best representation of style, mild kick, not much left to say other than I would not recommend this beer at all."
"This is a bit to mild mannered to be anything but the gentlest of crossover beers. Ive liked everything I have had from this brewery, I just like this one a little less."
"This beer doesn't have a lot going on, but is pretty easy to get down."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating system into a pint glass. It was a hazy golden color with some yeast bits in it. It barely had a head and that quickly dissipated into nothing. No collar, foam or lacing. The aroma was malty and sweet - very reminiscent of a kolsch. The taste was average to slightly above average. For me this style doesn't have much in the flavor department but they are easy to put down and make good session beers. I don't see this being a big player in the rotation but does make a nice change up beer in the summer heat. Overall, a good beer for the style and worth trying. (3.5, RB-changeup, T, Y)"
"Smell is very malty. Taste is malty, sweet and maybe fruity. A little hop bitterness but very little. Not sure what this beer is. To me it seems almost like a lager but lacking."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a hazy medium straw, forming a very thin white head. No lacing apparent on the glass. The aroma is a light mix of hops and fruit aromas, along with a little grain. The taste has a more noticeable malt character, mainly sweet, and finishing with a hint of hop citrus flavor. Nothing too complex about the taste. Medium mouthfeel, being a little thicker than expected, but not bad. Light flavor and assumed low abv. makes this a very drinkable summer ale. Overall, not as bad as others have said, but still nothing special about this ale to set it apart from the rest. In the end, just a typical summer ale."
"Better on draft--or, at least, it seemed better in the past, with more detectable hoppiness."
"Pours a crystal clear golden with a full head with a variety of different levels of elevation and some raised lacing left on the glass. The aroma of the malt has a candyish sweetness that reminds me of cotton candy and I get a bit of citrus hop underneath. Malt flavor is light, crisp, toasted, and with some graininess. Herbal hop flavor, snappy bitterness, and an overall dryness come in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and apropos for the overall refreshing quality of this beer, but I would've liked just a bit more carbonation. Tasty and refreshing, but I can think of other beers I'd rather have."
"D - Tasty with an aftertaste that starts out very pleasant and degrades slowly to a dryness that begs another sip. Sessionable. I don't know how to style this beer is, but it is a good alternative to the fake beer that both fake beer drinkers and real beer drinkers can both agree on (especially on tap)"
"Taste is spicy upfront, nice lemon flavor without any citric acidity. Big, deep, biscuity, malt base with cracked grain piping up at times. I get a liitle white pepper and the taste then darkens slightly to something I'm associating with bay leaf for the finish. I love this beer but feel it is kinda all over the place for blonde and could be brighter. Fortunately I'm not feeling like a style nazi. Mouthfeel is mid-bodied and grippy."
"Step up from a macro lager; unobtrusive in almost every way (except that graininess?)... but thats not necessarily a good thing for people who want flavor (and some hops maybe) and not just an easy quaffer."
"D: Fairly underwhelming."
"The taste is rather light and goes down relatively easy. There are some slight citrus notes with a mild hop finish. Overall it reminds me of a watered down cross between a wit and a kellerbier, which left me a bit dissapointed."
"Overall a very tasty and refreshing brew. Not quite what I expected and pleasantly surprised. Thanks chadspivey for the brew..."
"On tap at BD Rileys on 6th Street in Austin. It had a golden body with a slight haze beneath a creamy white head that displayed good retention and fair lacing. The nose was fairly basic with a combination of lightly grainy malt, yeasty fruitiness, and floral hops. It was medium-light bodied and crisp. The flavor followed the aroma. It was basic, but very nice. A nicely hoppy, not overdone beer! The bitterness was kept in check, and the hops were quite present but not to the point that they overshadowed the malt. Nicely done! Very drinkable. And, seemingly quite popular throughout the bars of Austin."
"This is one of my favorites from Real Ale and I am stoked that they put it in bottles. This used to be a ""bar only"" treat for me. I still like it better on tap, but now I am not limited in my options. Definitely worth a try."
"Light and creamy. Understated wheat edge and body. Powdery/chalky feel. Decent hop tartness. Finishes a slight dry."
"The beer was a slightly hazy straw color with a touch of white head. It laced the glass nicely. Smell was tart, like wheat malt and apricots, with a little touch of hops. The aftertaste had those same notes, though the main flavor was clean like a German-style lager. Enough hop presence balanced the beer's sweetness, making an overall well-rounded brew. The beer's body was the appropriately light for a refreshing summer ale. I would have this one again next time I'm in Austin."
"Not a bad brew, but not one I'd go out of my way for."
"On tap at the Flying Saucer in Addison. It is a distinctly gold (not yellow) color, with a thin head that dissippated quickly. The smell is caramel and floral hops (redundantly repeating myself). The taste is surprisingly malty with a crisp, sharp aftertaste that has a note of citrus. The mouthfeel is silky and a touch creamy. Definitely not the macro brew it looks like to start. The drinkability is excellent. It is very refreshing and the silkiness balances the crisp finish nicely. This one has ""session beer"" written all over it."
"The smell is floral, hoppy, and fruity. The mouthfeel is pretty light, but not watery. Overall, a pretty good beer."
"It poured a pale yellow color with a lot of haziness and a fairly high degree of very fine carbonation. Aroma was a slight malt sweetness. Flavor was also very lightly sweet like a very lightly flavored witbier, and I detected some cloviness. Mouthfeel was also very light and thin. This beer struck me as very drinkable, although its lightness was slightly off-putting to me...while I liked the way it tasted, it just didn't feel like beer in my mouth (not sure if that makes sense?). Overall I'd recommend it, but (and maybe this is just me), I'm surprised it has the broad appeal it does in Austin."
"D: All night long. I could play drinking games with this one. Too bad they don't make it in bottles."
"Very easy to drink, a session beer if I have ever had one. Quite nice taste as well. Somebody ship me a case when the weather starts to get warm, and I will give it a real test drive."
"Pours a clear blonde amber color with a short white head that fades into a medium lace. Nose is somewhat sweet with a bit of floral hops and hints of honeysuckle. Taste begins with sweet honey malt and a light fruitiness followed by some mildly bitter hops to round things out. Not a bad choice as a session beer or as something to enjoy on a warm afternoon."
"Opinion: I really like this beer. I don't know how much it walks the line between the ""Golden Ale"" that is printed on the bottle versus the APA that it is classified on this site. It is really clean and refreshing like a golden ale while it has a bit of a hoppy aroma and flavor that is not too common with a true golden ale. Regardless the beer is really clean and drinkable and that is why I would definitely drink it again."
"I thought it was intended to be a fruit beer based on the flavor. In the pint glass it looks APAish enough. Light gold, white head that doesn't spend too much time hanging around, no lace, and lots of columns of carbonation. The smell has an odd fruity odor, like canned pineapples or apricots. The flavor matches the smell, and I couldn't detect or was too distracted to notice any hoppiness. Light bodied, short finish. Definitely not a hardy winter beer. This would make a nice barbecue/lawnmower beverage."
"This was my first beer from Real Ale, found it better with food not strong enough to stand by itself though."
"I typially really like APA's, but I didn't really care for this one too much. Apparence was pretty good with a light pale gold colour with virtually no head retention. Taste was weak with some really odd flavours. I finished it, but I've definitely had better from Real Ale and much better tasting pale ales."
"cut out for a session ale. Its not heavy on either malt or hops and is a well made beer that's a good foundation for RA's product line."
"This is the 4th beer I've had from Real Ale and my least favorite. Appearance is golden pale with small head. Smell is rather weak, some hops mixed with fruit (After reading other reviews I think grapefruit) are present. Taste is of mild hops and grapefruit, not exactly what I like, but not bad. Drinkability is pretty good, but this beer didn't quite feel right on my palate. Maybe I just don't like the style, it's definently not like any other APAs that I've had."
"Overall Impression: A light refreshing tasty beer. Pretty straightforward, but a touch of intricacy lends itself to a good summer thirst quencher or session beer."
"Drinkability/notes: Tasted on tap at the brewery during the RealAle Seventh Anniversary Celebration in Blanco, TX on June 28th, 2003. According to the good folks at RealAle, this beer may be offered in bottles soon. Alas, there are no plans to offer the much-beloved Coffee Porter in bottles."
"This was a good beer. Much lighter than I normally prefer but a great summertime refreshing beer. Drink one on a hot afternoon and see if you agree. I was slightly reminded of a wheat beer with it's effervescence and slightly cloudy appearance. Very crisp with a hint of bitter and sweetness. Reminds me of a pale ale but a little lighter."
"My first experiences with Real Ale Brewery were iffy, but I think that was due to poor retail storage. This year I've revisited all the Real Ale brews and I think they've my favorite Texas micro."
