"Overall : A notch better than the average brand having a little more taste and body."
""
"Not the worst beer in the world, but far closer to it than to the best!"
"Had a pitcher on tap in Montreal. Tasted like a dirty diaper to me but to each his own."

"So overall would I recommend it ? For sure. You wanna drink a Molson product. Take a Molson Export. This is much better than a Molson Dry or a Molson Canadian. If you are at the bar and have the chance to try the Molson Export. Try it."

"Are neighbors to the North don't need to export this one, of course they probably don't want to drink it either"

"O: A nice take on the export ale style though could use a bit more body but a decent Molson product nonetheless."

"This is one of those beers that tastes way better on tap than in the can. I don’t know what causes that because I am not a professional canman. Good front end and the back gets a little sour and syrupy, kinda like your lesser American macros. Very nice front all the way through, though, and the downer back end ain’t that noticeable in the tap version. It’s a real bargain, too, the Bell Center only charges 11 bucks a tall boy!"

"This a good pretty good beer for a macro, but it was first made when it was a micro-brewery. It has a great ale color and smells fruity. The taste ia awesome for a macro so i think it is above average. The mouthfeel is like most of the ales. In average it is definetly the best ale you can find everywhere in Canada!"

"i like this better than either canadian or golden. its very sessionable and less artifical tasting. pours clear yellow color with a excited white head over an inch tall, decent retention. watery look overall, but not bad. smells like pale malts, very light, with on;y some bittering hops in there as to not be offensive. taste is the same, but i reckon a stiffer hopping would make this a damn fine beer, it seems to be lacking to me, and that could really set it off. mouthfeel is good, smooth and drinkable, lighter body but not too light, with bright carbonation. sessionable, especially when ice cold. i dont mind this one in the summer when i am on a budget."

"Molson makes a number of abhorrent beers and, in full fairness, also have a few passable offerings in their portfolio. Export, in my opinion, doesn't fit neatly into either of those two camps. It's not offensive, but it's far from pleasant. I can't imagine any scenario where I'd recommend anyone buy this beer. It is distasteful at worst, forgettable at best."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: One of Molson's better offerings, that is for sure. When I was younger, Export wasn't my cup of tea as it seemed to be a lot heavier and hoppier back then, however now, it is a suitable replacement for when only Macros are on tap."

"Molson Export is like most typical North American beers. It pours a golden clear with initial big head that dissapates quickly. The smell and taste are mostly grain. Mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer that is drinkable."
""
"Nice crisp taste with a hoppy spicy kick. One of my favorite styles of beer and Ex is a premier option. Mouthfeel is prickly and effervescent. My one complaint is the beer's flavor seems to diminish surprisingly quickly, so try to find one with the closest brewed date."

"Overall a decent macro that I have always enjoyed."
"the metallic influence? Doesn't seem as good as it used to be. Still better than Labatt though."
"On tap in Montreal. This beer poured a golden color, much carbonation is evident by the bubbles. Shiny white head dissipates quickly. Scent is a bit off-putting, not skunky, just a bit, well, macro. Smells like corn. Buttered corn. Taste was not comparative to the smell. Much better. Not great, just better. The appeal for export must be drinkability, not taste. Mouthfeel was a bit grainy and dry after a while. Not my favorite."
"I was out west for two years and never saw this stuff there. I'll admit to missing Ex a little bit during that time... it was one of the first beers I had after coming back. If I am at a pub that only has the bare minimum of selection, a pint of Export will almost always be the safe choice. As far as mass-produced Canadian beer goes, this is one of the better options - and I say this as someone who is not a fan of most Molson products at all."
"A favourite of a buddys, usually consumed when at his place, outside in summer. When poured it's a pal golden yellow with a frothy white head. Nose is grain, malt, bit of fruit notes come through and a touch of alcohol. Taste is decent, easy to down a bunch, certainly tastes like you'd expect a macro to: not much flavour, most grain and alcohol. Light to medium mouthfeel. Not sure how he can only drink this one beer every single day; to each their own. Overall, I can stand to have one if I stop it for a visit."
"medium body, crisp carbonation, easily drinkable. A slightly more flavorable macro lager."
"Molson Export pours a crystal clear bright gold with a decent head that lingers nicely. The aroma is faintly grainy with a bit of faint fruitiness. The flavor is clean, slightly grainy, and faintly astringent. There is a bit of bitterness in the finish. Overall, there is nothing offensive about this beer, but it's nothing special (and quite overpriced here in Ontario)."
"D- Easy to drink, not a terrible tasting beer. Overall pretty average."
"D - To me, this is what a Canadian beer should taste like, full flavor, and not too light. Worth a try!"
"$4.99 a 6 pack of 11.5 ounce of brown bottles"
"Overall it's a bit better then Molson Canadian but still has that mostly bland macro aroma & flavour. When in a bar that only has generic macro available this is one I'll likely order."
"Drinkability: This is a beer to get your drunk on, and with a few liter cans it's pretty easy to accomplish. And it's not that bad tasting a beer while you wait for the alcohol to hit your brain."
"Ok enough for something with its heritage - I had no problem drinking this, unlike its extended family..."
"i see they've modified the logo, which is a blue sailing ship. It used to look a lot like an armidillo when you tipped the bottle and viewed the ship on it's side."
"I was actually impressed to see an APA come out of Molson Brewing. Not my favorite, but a valiant effort consistent with the albeit open ended APA style."
"Drinkability - drinkability is strong. Good refreshment while not being boring. An OK choice for a session beer for sure."
"Notes: This is a sort-of guilty pleasure beer for me. I usually drink it right from the bottle, and it's better that way. Pouring it into a glass shows its true lack of character. From a frosty cold bottle, it's a different story. Needs to be ice-cold."
"The mouthfeel for this beer is a really even-balance beer, light and a bit crisp."
"Okay for what it is. Mainly inoffensive, but nothing particularly special or tasty."
"Extremely drinkable. One of the best ""bad"" beers I've had."
"Won't have this again."
"Decent beer with an identity crisis. Pours darker yellow with a white head. Bright aroma of saaz and crystal malt. It has a bit of a bite like an ale, but is sweet like a lager. Enjoyable, not great, but I can't really say that I've had a APA of this style."
"(bottle - 12 oz) Pours a very pale golden color. Thick, lasting head. Looks like many other beers when poured. Strong hop aroma. Good smooth flavor with no strong aftertaste. No distinct taste. It's a good tasting and drinkable beer, but nothing about it really stands out."
"Notes: This is one of my favorite beers from the big breweries. It's always good on a hot summer day and also makes for a good hockey watching beer."
"Honestly this beer is slightly better than the other beers that are widely available at bars in its class"
"I love Canadian, Love Dry, and hell, even Laurentide is better than this. This tastes like a strangely unbalanced macro lager, rather than an ale. If you're looking for a good Canadian macro ale, I'd go with Labatt 50, much better. I know this isn't Longtrail or Cooper's, but Molson gets ""K'd"" for this one!"
"Nothing too exceptional here, although I think there might be a bit of an identity crisis going on here. Says american pale ale, but smells and goes down like a lager... were the little beasties on top or bottom? Anyway, tastes just about like a molson to me, light hops and a lot of carbonation. Not a bad beer but not my favourite."
"Notes: This beer is spectacularly unspectacular. The taste just is not there, but to look at that positively, it really contains no offensive tastes. Its pretty good if you just want to drink for the hell of it or if nothing else is available to you."
"I certainly prefer it to most Canadian macros, and definately would take it over a Canadian. A safe enough choice if there aren't any micro brews in site. But that stink! Ugh."
"When I think Molson Export, I think of two things: Canadiens hockey and creamed corn. It's palatable, but some (such as myself) might find it too sweet and unbalanced."
"It didn't smell all that great, didn't taste all that great, and was not an instant favourite. At least it looked like beer. But not one I would recommend to friends or beer lovers anywhere."
"Molson Export is fairly standard for a macro. It's miles ahead of the flagships of Canadian macro brewing (Canadian and Blue), but that's about the only accolade I'm willing to give it. On cheap drink night at a crappy bar, I might have a couple, but otherwise, I'd take pretty much anything else - even a Rickard's Red or Kokanee would be infinitely more palatable. Still, there's something about the Ex that brings out a sense of nostalgia in me - and that's why every once in awhile, maybe only once a year, I grab a six-pack and slug 'em back right from the bottle."
"Originally reviewed on July 4, 2006. Pour of light straw with sparse white head. Aroma of rotting Saskatchewan grain in a dusty hay barn. Flavor is a salty armpit of tangy wheated grains and an edge of rotting lemons. The heafty reek of skunk runs strong. Light fusels waft upward. The palate contains a light drying edge of hops."
"d -- could drink a couple without thinking about it, but it does leave some unwanted tastes in your mouth. definitely not an all-nighter."
"The old standby. Without Molson Export there is no way I would have been able to get my masters done. When I lived in Albany, NY I first discovered this beer while broke and thirsty. While not the best beer in the world by any strech it is however IMO the best beer for one on a budget. Nice golden color but not much head and it quickly disipates. Nice flavor with some actual taste. No mistaking this for water. What really sells this beer for me is drinkability and price."
"Overall, it goes down smooth and has enough flavor to enjoy. One can tell it's a macro, but one can also see that it has a bit more flavor than most ""run of the mill"" beers. It could be nostalgia, it might be the taste, heck, it's probably a little bit of both! But I love this beer!! It's tough to buy in the states unless you find yourself up North. Very easy to find in Maine, NH, and VT. Anywhere else ... good luck. If you see it, grab a six of the ""red cap", steam up some lobsters or grab a fresh basket of ""poutine"" and enjoy!!"
"I was very surprised to see this in the states, especially here in Gardiner. It's all over the place in Canada, but I've never seen it here... Very light yellow, clear body with half inch offwhite head. Light scent of malt and alcohol. Similar to a macro lager. Slightly above-average mouthfeel, Tastes somewhat watery, somewhat sweet with a noticeable hop presence. Not the tastiest beer I've ever had, but surprisingly tasty for what it is and definitely one of the best macros I've had. Having said that, it's a bit more watery than I'd like. If the flavors were turned up a bit, it'd be a very good beer. I'd drink this again."
"Not as bland as a lot of macros, but flavour was a little bit off and unbalanced compared to higher quality ales. Still, among the better of Molson's standard products."
"A note on my ratings, the smell is nasty, but the mouthfeel is excellent and the taste is very good, so I don't know how that works a hundred percent, but it works. Worth drinking and nice to try something I can't get on the shelf in the states."
"Medium gold, light gold in color, initial 2 finger head when poured into nonic glass. Above average carbonation, head collapsed to a tight one that stuck. Smell is slightly sweet and grainy, no real hop aroma detected. Sweet malt flavor with very slight fruit element The fruit element increased as the ale warmed. Very faint hop finish, not as crisp as Labatt 50. Some residual bitterness/adjunct aftertaste. A light, smooth ale that's kind of underwhelming but fits into the throw-back old time flavor category."
"Its a golden beer with a pretty descent heaed that doesnt last too long. It taste pretty maltya nd has a few more hops tan expected. Overall a good tasting beer but nothing amazing. I personallly enjoy drinking it and could have many of them without feeling stuffed but probably feeling drunk."
"It's medium bodied and gently crisp in the mouth, and it's a little bit more drinkable in comparison with most American macro lagers, as the hops lend it a touch more character. On the other hand, this is a Canadian beer, and there are a lot more Canadian lagers with more hops than this."
"Not a bad beer here, pretty average tasting. I've had much better beers io my day, but I've also had much worse. This is actually a very easy drinker. I could down several of these with ease and without choking them down and cussing myself out for resorting to it again like I would with busch light or something. Nothing all that special, but not a bad beer at all for the price. Probably would make a great beer to introduce to your thick-headed bud light buddy."
"Overall, this beer did not impress me at all, no characteristics that would make me buy it again."
"Average tasting brew. Pours golden clear with little to no head or lacing. Quite crisp and clean, slightly bready flavor. Medium hop bitterness. Very little smell at all but I can pick up some sweet oats and wheat in the aroma. Definately a drinkable macro beer, better than most Molson products."
"Paired this up with a spinach and artichoke pizza and they worked very well together."
"Pours ultra clear pale straw. A soapy three finger head shows decent retention but minimal lacing. Simple grain and ceareal adjunct nose, without any noticable hop aroma. Sweet pils/munich malt base, hint of apple ester, and a weak hop aftertaste. Very thin body and high carbonation produce a light and crisp mouthfeel with a clean finish. However, the characteristics of the classic APA are lost for want of a beer more appealing to fans of light lagers. Highly drinkable, but at the cost of being watered down and boring."
"Molson Export can either be thought of as a terrible APA or an okay macro lager. It's obvious to me that it's the latter and that's how I've approached it. I doubt that I'd ever pay import prices for it in a bar. Then again, if BMC products were my only alternative, I'd have no problem 'going Canuck'."
"Both Export and Golden taste rather weak and adjuncty, but the saving grace with Export is the brown bottle as opposed to Golden's green (and some of its inherited lightstruck qualities). With the first sip, I nearly thought that this was as flavorless as Coor's Light, but some of its mediocre flavors ended up appearing. This is a swilling beer, nothing more."
"This is my #1 favorite beer, second being molson canadian, third being labbatt's blue. I love this beer, it is the greatest beer I've ever had. I love this beer cold with a hot pizza on a sunny new york summer day. Has a great frothy head, and pours a nice golden color. BEST BEER EVER! Highly recommended."
"I remember the day back in early high school when I used to wear my Molson Ex hat, my Chem teacher came up to me and said...you know what they call Export?..I looked at him with confusion and he says "" the armmedillo beer""...I figured it out later...when you turn the ship sideways, you see an armedillo. Anyways, this beer has prestige and hertiage over the past 100 years, the same taste and the same classic export finish."
"A friend brought this over fresh from the duty free shop. It had a nice color and a good old fashioned beer flavor. It was refreshing,but not too light. I'm sure the freshness was a factor. I liked this beer better than regular Molson Canadian. I would recommend trying this beer."
"I had Molson Ex on tap in Montreal and Quebec City pubs. The head disipates on this beer pretty quickly. If I'm feeling like a light Ale that is ""drinkable"" this is the beer for me. Mouthfeel is refreshing and the taste is much better than your average macro as the quick but potent hoppy aftertaste you get with this beer is what I like about it. It's what Molson's chief macro beer, Canadian, should taste like."
"Pours a clear golden color, head is light but not lacy. Taste is pretty much the essence of average - no negative tastes, sweet, slightly hoppy, but nothing interesting here. Drinkable. The best example of an average beer that I can think of. But why would you want to settle for average?"
"Wish that this was more readily available in the states. Pours out to a clear bronze color with a touch of red. Not much of a head, medium/low carbonation. Slighly chemical odor, with overtones of hops and ale. Rather dry taste with overtones of malt and hops with a small touch of what I would call sour mash. Slightly sour and creamy aftertaste that is quite dry. Not a bad beer, but not amazing either. Nonetheless, wish it was eaiser to get in the states other than in variety 12 packs. Worth a try."
"Golden color with a white frothy head. Nothing to note here with the aroma. The best thing I can say about this beer is that it's nicely balanced and very easy to drink. I guzzled three of these in no time. Very average beer with little redeeming value."
"A surprising beer, to say the least. After trudging through the other beers in the Molson mix pack, this beer actually has a little character. Clear Medium gold color, with a head that fades fast. Smell actually has a little bit of hops present, although faintly sweet and floral, they are there. Taste is underhhwleming for an APA, but for an APA from molson it is pretty good. Biscuity malt flavors lead into actual hops. AVersus the style, this beer is sub-par. Too bad you can't give points vs. the brewery..."
"Molson Ex was the first 24 pack I bought (when I was still ""never thinking to have my id on me today"". My taste have changed and I don't really appreciate it no more for a drinking night. I will make an exception for that review time. The appearance is quite good, but its smell is just too chemical / adjunct for me. Molson Ex taste is pretty sweet and fruity. A good bitter hops taste follows it and it is probably the most classic aftertaste you can get from a Molson macro. Drinkability: Average, but very good for an adjunct macro."
"Part of a Molson variety pack at a party. The beer pours a gloden yellow color slightly darkes than the Canadian and Golden. I'm actually somewhat impressed with the aroma, very bready yeast aroma with a hint of floral hops. The flavor is more or less what I expected which is slightly malty and not very bitter, clean and yeasty. This beer does have more body then the lagers offered by Molson. This is an okay beer, of which you can down severalin a sitting."
"Overall-while being a little light and thin for the style, Molson Export works, it stands up to any macro competitor I'm sure, most craft brew of this style is superior though."
"Pours a medium straw color with a 2 finger head that went away fairly quickly. OK lace.Smells of sweet malt with some corn and rice notes, not much, but some. A hair skunky. Not much if any hop aroma. The main difference between this and Canadian is that this being an ale, it does have some ""fruity"" tastes associated with it, as an ale should. It is a bit heavier than Canadian, as well. It tastes of sweet malt but the fruityness of it quickly takes over, but that too quickly fades into generalized macro aftertaste. Its OK for a macro ale. A nice change of pace from the typical macro lager. Not a great ale, just a nice chage of pace"
"Appearance was a light golden color with a foamy head about a finger thick. This head slowly dissipated over time. Many streams of carbonation bubbles coming from the bottom. Smell was malty and sweet. I thought I detected some hints of corn too. Taste was malty and reminiscent of straw. Mouthfeel was light, better than most macro beers. Aftertaste was doughy and pleasing. Not bad, but nothing really to get excited about."
"Light body, with decent mouthfeel. Actually quite light on flavour. Fairly clean tasting. Somewhat dry and not very sweet, especially considering what I expected from the smell. The mustiness of the hops comes through much stronger in the flavour. Taste starts kind of empty, then the hops come through. That funny hops taste lingers in the aftertaste."
"Very clear golden colour topped by a creamy white head that settles to a respectable lace after a couple minutes. Fruity-sour aroma with a musty hop smell. There's a fruity twang at the beginning of a sip, followed by light grainy malt. Very light bitterness is present and carries through to the aftertaste. Thin bodied and highly carbonated."
"The beer pours a pale yellow color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is decent. It has a clean and refreshing pale malt scent that a bit weak, but finishes with a fruity, yet dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is average. It has a weak and watery pale malt flavor with little hops present. It goes down easy and finishes a little skunky. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good drinking brew for those hot afternoons, but nothing else. It has a weak palate. It's one and done for me."
"After living in Canada for some time, I deeply enjoyed Molson Export. When I returned to the States, I was able to purchase a sixer of Export at the local supermarket. I was very disappointed with it when I tried it. The taste completely changed. Here, the taste was dull, at best. Also, when poured into a glass, there was alot of foam. I tried pouring it in different ways, and I still had foam. Also, I couldn't find any foods that went well with the Export. I even tried pizza with the Ex and it didn't complement it. Now, whenever I return to Canada, I have a pint or two to remind me of the original flavor, and I try to purchase a case or two at the border when possible. Overall, try the Canadian version instead of the American version."
"Quaffed 7 of these during the Seahawks game last night with some buds, who graciously brought a case of this into my home. Needless to say, while playing cards and watching football, beer is more of an added constituent than something to sit back and ponder the finer points of the beer you are drinking. That being said, this is a decent brew from Molson, the first of which I cannot find something horribly awry with. Standard straw golden color, white head. Not much of anything but some pale malt and slight hop twang. Very refreshing though. Goes down easily in mass quantities....and for this occasion, this is good."
"This beer has a character I'm just at a loss to find what it is,....that makes it unique, there really is nothing like it from the mega brewers. It's a Canadian staple."
"No head wathsoever when pourred into glass (I guess this too pelased Mr and Mrs everybody...). No spice and very little aftertaste. I'm not sure what the other BA's drank cause I don't see anything interesting here. This is the usual macro brewed beer that is very light and designed for those hot summer days..."
"This is a solid beer from the Molson Breweries of Canada. Pours out wih a decent head over a deep golden body, with plenty of residual for spotty lacing. Nicely balanced malt body that leaves a fairly neat finish from the hidden hop component. Decent feel with nice crispness, but a bit light on the aroma. Drinkability is good, though not as high as with many other similar beers."
"Notes: Very easy drinking, no off flavours yet dont expect any flavours to impress either. At $5.89 a six pack there is better and cheaper beer out there."
"I can get a 12 pack for under 8 bucks so who complains? And the cap is one of the coolest I have ever seen. Export pours a light straw color with a puffy cumulous head that receded into basically nothing. It smelled pretty bland and swilly, but its taste is somewhat alluring for some reason. Its pretty watery and malty but there is some hop kick at the end. I cannot really explain why I like this beer. Perhaps its because it was what was around the house when I was growing up. Who knows? Anyway if you want to drink reasonably good beer but only have the money for mass produced this is where its at."
"Poured a pale/yellow color with medium head that dissapated fast,a light spiciness in the smell.Taste is pretty straight forward with some hop bitterness in there,nothing complex.Not a great beer but Iam not offended to drink a six pack of this either."
"In the bottle this is very close to its tap incarnation. The brown bottles really help the beer from getting messed up!"
"Look, at times we are lucky if we can scrape together a few pennies for a 12-pack of something or other. Molson Export Ale is the top of the list for me. Admittedly, they only put 11.5 oz. in each bottle (go figure), but for about 67 cents a bottle, this stuff is okay (hence my high ""drinkability"" score). It pours a light golden colour, and the white foam subsided quickly--with lots of carbonation, as is often the case with the big brewery products. The smell is llight and yeasty, but the taste, frankly, is pretty bland. Still, well worth the so-called investment."
"An okay product from Molson. Straw gold colour with a head that dissipates fast, but leaves a nice rim. Lace runs down the glass til finished. Slight spicy taste, mediocre use of hops, some malt. Pretty good beer, but not the best Molson beer. Slightly better on tap, but most beers are."
"This is a good crossover beer, one that will be considered drinkable even by people who dislike your ""dark, microbrew"" stuff."
"Pours a light head on a body slightly browner than their golden offering. Head quickly dissapates. Light, barely noticeable flavors of hops. Has a mellow/slightly sweet maltiness flavor to it. Aftertaste is the same and not bitter. Carbonation is light and body is medium. Had quite a few of these and john labatt's classic at the bar w/o any feelings of fullness."
"The best thing to come out of Canada since ice hockey!"
"Crisp and clean with a body in the medium range and a head that retains its own character. I am now a fan!"
"It's called export because I suspect no one in Canada really wants to drink it. It does not taste like an ale, no real hop taste to it. Another ""high school"" beer. Even if it is skunked, it still tastes the same."
"Decided to finally try this, since it's quite highly regarded out in the Maritimes where it was only recent introduced.  Ex enjoys the reputation as a premium beer there much as Keith's does in Ontario.  Has a golden colour, with more head than usual for a Molson or Labatt product.  The smell and taste are unremarkable, but smooth and easy to drink.  There's no flavours which actually stand out in this.  So yes, better than most other Molsons, but still a step below a good beer."
"I really do not care for this beer or any molson beer, it gives me really bad gas. Light color and body with no hops or malt just a bunch of corn and rice. My mother in law comes and she brings the crap, so i have to drink it and my wife puts up with the gas."
"It's too bad that Ex isn't available in locations which aren't so close to Canada;  it's a fine product for the dollar and puts most macros to shame."
"A nice, introduction to ale, kind of ale.  I had several of these at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.  Easy to drink, light and somewhat fruity.  Not bad."
