"DATE REVIEWED: June 27, 2014... GLASSWARE: Ayinger willibecker... OCCASION: a ton of yard work done today--time for a reward...APPEARANCE: cloudy, slightly murky yellow-orange body; good effervescence; white, thick, soapy head; sporadic whips of lacing... AROMA: some lemon zest, some dishwasher detergent as well; faint wheat and clove... PALATE: slightly lively; easily drinkable, as the style would suggest; light in body and not fizzy--flat?... TASTE: instantly off-putting funk that doesn't subside with the next sip (wet cardboard?); malt is somewhat abrasive as well; this is NOT what summer tastes like to me... OVERALLL: sadly, a second chance at a first impression, and yet the same result: a bafflingly unsatisfying flavor married to a thirst-quenching body; plenty of other summer ales deliver more taste and harmonious experiences..."

"unfairly low ratings for this beer here. i admit, a lot of their strong and belgian styles have been lackluster, but this is a pretty good summer ale, certainly a good one to buy a case of in a box state like PA for hot weather mass consumption. pale blonde in color, bubbly, and emitting aromas of orange peel and extremely lightly toasted barley. the flavor is quite simple and straightforward, with a real soft grain front end and then a clean, slightly citrusy balanced finish, crispy clean drinking, supremely refreshing, and with the low abv, its a good summer slammer right from the bottle. i think it probably deserves a little more credit than it has on here, i mean, there are no off flavors, and the feel is great. i guess folks may be looking for a bit more hop character, or even just more robust flavors throughout, but this beer is for the light beer drinker looking to go craft. i think it works, and aside from being awfully light, I've got no real critiques. i like the biscuity front end and the hint of orange zest as it closes out."

"will not go over the flavors as it seems to have been done by other already. Good luck finding it at least in hunterdon county are in NJ seems to be on and off with availability in the summer months, sells out quick."

"If you're looking for a light, summer beer to enjoy this weekend, River Horse Summer Blonde is it. At 4.5% ABV, it's light and quenching but doesn't sacrifice any taste, making it a must-have this summer."

"One of the better Summer Ales and it helps that it is a local NJ brewery.."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and light enough (and low enough in alcohol) to be quite sessionable. There is nothing that really stands out about this beer but it is enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall, good clean summer drink. Not a big flavor or at all challenging."
"Overall a quaffable summer ale."
""
""
"O: The light body nature of this beer makes it go down easily but there’s nothing special about the smell or taste."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a subpar attempt at a Blonde ale. Flavor profile is muted and seems dialed back. Not horrible but there were much better options that I passed up on draft; won't make that mistake again."

"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy-golden with a long lasting, small white head. Aroma is of citrus fruit, some apples and cookies. Body is medium and crisp. Flavors are of biscuit malt, citrus fruit and hints of musty yeast. Finish is very short. On the whole it is tasty, refreshing lawn mower brew."
""

"Decently sized creamy mouthfeel up front. Bread crusts with a touch of butter, slightly toasty. Carbonation rolls in around mid pallete. Slightly earthy hops present on the end just to round everything out making for a clean sip. Not as crisp as id like this beer to be but it does add a unique twist to things. Nothing crazy but decent for a standard american blonde ale. Flavors are good. Could very well go great with summer evenings by the case."

"nice looking medium golden amber with a touch of light haze that settles out quickly. large head of white leaves a little side lacing but not much as it settles itself out. aroma is light grains and grasses, a touch of bready malts and a bit of a lingering hop note that is soo faint i dont know how i picked it up. clean, crisp, and light feel and flavor, there is really not much to it, a touch of peach perhaps on the tongue but that was all, nothing to write home about"
"Medium bodied but on the lighter end with some tight carbonation and zesty spice. Dry and earthy with hints of grass, straw and pepper. Bready yeast is the most prominent flavor but it doesn't add much to the palate. Sweetness toward the finish with hints of apple and lemon peel. Kind of bland but somewhat easy to drink."
"O- I like this beer for hot summer days and nights. It has just the right amount of flavor without beeing too overpowering."
"Well, this is a watery beer. But representing this benighted style, it's not bad. An enjoyable quaff, I have to admit."
"This is definitely a warm weather beer. It is light in taste, texture, color, and alcohol content; this is what I look for in a warm weather beer. It is straight forward without any need for lemon or lime flavoring. However, the lack of flavoring also leaves you wanting a little more taste in the beer, especially if you like darker beers like I do."
"This beer pours out like a traditional blonde ale. The coloe is yellow with a minimal haze to it. The small has some grains and citrus in it. The taste follows through with a lot of citrus, almost like grapefruit. The mouthfeel is light and smooth. Overall this brew is a decent summer beer. worth a try."
"m/d- body is thin but compliments the delicate flavor. very easy drinker, despite low alcohol there is plenty of flavor and it was priced well."
"This was strange to say the least, the expierience I mean. Got this on tap at a local Inn. First off and friend and I struggled to pick up on any scent particullarly with this beer, secondly this beer hit my pallet and felt and tasted like water, in all honestly my best describtion would be Coors only more water. I'm going to have to try this beer in a different format, this is to surprising, perhaps something was wrong with the keg. Regardless be forwardned."
"First impression is a wave of corn graininess. Not good. Kind of musty tasting. There is a kiss of bitterness on the end, followed by a lingering cooked corn flavor. Disappointing."
"This Beer is a very refreshing very Drinkable Beer and once I tried it I bought a case. A very nice summer Blond beer give it a try."
"Let me first say that I have not been a fan of River Horse beers in the past. That said, I actually don't think this is that bad of a brew. Is it great? Absolutly not, but it has a very laid back texture and understated drinkability which results in an average beer that can be quite tremendous when enjoyed in the proper setting (ie hot summer day). It's strength lies in it's ability to avoid the pitfalls that too many summer brews fall victim too (ie excessive citrus, overstated flavors, etc.). River Horse tones it down nicely (unlike their liquid cement monstrosity Hop-A-Lot-A-Mus), and make a very solid (albeit not great) summer beer that I might not go out of my way to purchase, but will enjoy if I come across it."
"Overall - A great summmertime brew"
"D: Not something I will drink again in succession. I could barely finish two. Maybe one of these, if it's all I have, but I doubt I'd purchase this again. Flavors are all over the place, sweet, artificial honey flavor is over the top, which cripples drinkability. Really off balanced."
"Bottle. A nice golden color. A fairly light aroma of faint malt and hops. The taste is more faint hops than malt. This is a light-weight fairly charcterless brew. Fine to drink after a lawn-mowing excursion, or to quench a summer thirst, but overall not a very interesting beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is crisp, light, some malts and slightly sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this makes for a good quality brew."
"Oopewan"
"D- Average, light ale. Drinkable yes, flavorful, no."
"D - Goes down nicely once you get rid of the pea flavor."
"T/M: Smooth, slightly sweet, crisp. Nice tingle from the carbonation. Short, dry finish with not much aftertaste."
"Drinkability besides being light and a low ABV I really couldn't stomach to have another one of these."
"Nothing special..."
"D- Session beer? I like Power Hour better. This is an extremely drinkable summer offering from River Horse."
"D: nice drinkability, and unique flavor makes this worthy of a try. I would buy a sixer of this."
"I really hope I got a bad batch of this. I can't imagine the carbonation level in this bottle could possibly be representative of the beer, however it has got to be the fizziest darn beer I've ever set my lips on. Absolutely undrinkable carbonation levels. I tried to pour it into a glass, but it immediately fizzed to the rim. Burp. Wasn't impressed with it otherwise, with the pungent citris flavor making it taste more like a 7-up than a beer."
"I would recommend for a hot summer day. Not a year round champ, but a good drinkable summer beer."
"Drinkability: Y'know, it's not so terrible once all of that damnable carbonation settles down."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, yet fruity malt scent that boasts of pale and wheat malts as well as a nice lemony zest. It has a slight bisquity aroma. The taste is pretty good. It has a light, pale and wheat malt flavor that goes down smooth and finishes earthy and dry with a slight lemon zest. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking summer ale, but not a beer you will go to lengths to obtain It's perfect for those hot afternoons."
"Average drinkability. Easy to drink, non filling; but there are so many more that are so much better."
"I wouldnt go out of my way to get it, but I would pick it up again."
"Bottom line - it doesn't taste ""bad"" because, for the most part, it doesn't taste. Strange brew. It might almost quench a thist in the heat because of its inoffensiveness, but...not much of a beer."
"A pleasant summer beer, but nothing outstanding."
"Pours a deeper shade of straw in my glass with very little head despite what i thought was a good pour. Smells of some slight fruit, bready yeast and citrus. Drinking the beer i found it to be very bland yet smooth and satisfying yet at the same time you can def chug this beer. But that is about its best quality. There is a noticable lack of carbonation which i found strange too. All in all a great beer for the warmer weather, but thats about it."

" Another fun but uninspiring beer from River Horse."
"Drinkablity would be average. As mentioned before , there was a slight sour and a slight cardboard taste that means I caught this beer at the end of it's life, still, fresh, this would be an average beer with low ABV to drink in the summer while doing stuff in the yard."
"Thought I would try this beer as summer's end is knocking on my door. Unfortunately, not a whole lot to this beer. Pours incredibly pale yellow in color. Also, appears slightly tinged green. Slightly hazy. Only a thin and filmy head on top. Nose is amlts, but they come across as corn. In terms of flavor, tis beer reminds me of long nights working my way through too many macros adjuncts. Lots of light malts plus corn and other adjunct flavors, plus the hops are essentially non-existent. Perhaps could make a suitable picnic beer."
"Thin crisp mouthfeel and an overall pleasant enough character makes this one an easy drinker on a hot day, but it's not my favorite."
"This summer ale pours a bit cloudy with a thin white head. An evident nose of sweet malt was appealing but the brew itself was somewhat thin and mostly sweet, ie, it lacked balance. The body was there, due to the sweetness I presume, but overall would not have me coming back for more. Overall a fair summer ale, which might fit the taste of your average ""lite"" drinker, but I'll stay away."
"Not a very good beer. This was my first River Horse beer, and if all the other beers in this sampler are like this, they won't be in business too much longer. At least date the fucking things!"
"Overall = A very bland, uninspiring beer with a taste not much different from macro crap. Not recommended."
"This is pretty good beer. It's one of the first blonde ales that I've had that actually tastes blonde. River Horse may not have a Derby winner here, but Summer Blonde is definitely no nag."
"I think I'd rather drink a Coke than this beer."
"Overall- a decent/mediorce summer blonde,won't offend."
"Mostly clear gold blond color, just a thin white rim of foam. Nose is the only interesting part of this otherwise boring brew. Sweet, creamy wheat, mixed in with some vanilla. Taste is very sweet. Some light wheat taste, too. Real shallow feel, nothing. Light, off mineral aftertaste."
"Pours a very slightly hazy pale straw with a medium sized white head that quickly diminishes and barely laces the glass. Aroma is very light, mostly just a faint graininess. Flavor is somewhat sweet, lightly bready/grainy, with a hint of lemon. Thin-medium in body, fairly bland and boring."
"This beer was not really to my liking, though I have no problem finishing the six pack i have already purchased. i would suggest it to someone who likes flavorful, smooth, light-bodied beers... but i found it too thin to be enjoyable."
"I could sit back and drink some of these on a summer afternoon/evening. It sort of sparkles. Nothing spectacular about this beer, and certainly nothing offensive."
"The beer poured a hazy yellow color with a small head that quickly disappated. The aroma was of slight citrus. The malt come through on the tongue with slight bitterness. The bitterness lasted a bit after swallowing. Very dry, and light carbonation. Definitely drinkable since it has a lighter body, but not overly exciting."
"Pours a slightly hazey light golden color with a light head that leaves some light lacing,aroma is definently malty and grainy with some light sweetness.The taste has a nice malty backbone but nothing really gives it some umph.This a solid brew easy to drink quite a few of these not very complex."
"The flavor is smooth and malty, with a spicy, carbonated mouthfeel. Hops take up the rear, providing a mildly bitter herbal finish. A little muddy tasting, but still finish the beer nicely. No dryness, yet crisp. Malts are fairly clean, with a slight pear esteriness. Some nuttiness towards the end, just before the hops slide in. Very slight soapy aftertaste, but all told, this is surprisingly tasty. Not terribly complex, but flavorful and quenching. Very true to the blonde ale style. Summer beers seem to be getting better and better."
"A hazy golden body is capped by a creamy head of bright-white foam that holds fairly well before dropping to a creamy collar and some whispy surface foam. Lacing, however, is limited. The nose is intriguing with a soft, wheat-tinged grainy malt that's smoothed by a light touch of buttery diacetyl and backed by a subtle fruitiness. The body is medium and it appears creamy and smooth in the mouth due to a fine, moderate carbonation. The buttery diacetyl found in the nose is a bit stronger in the flavor, yet it actually seems to work for the beer by combining with a grainy maltiness that's gently balanced by mildly spicy hops. There's a malty sweet flavor to it that I associate with the dextrins delivered by cara-pils malt; but it's not overdone and it retains a refreshing quality. It finishes with a lingering note of sweet malt that slowly receeds to reveal some gentle background hop flavor and delicate bitterness. Overall, a very decent summer beer that might not be really refreshing right after mowing the lawn, but has a little bit more malt flavor to it for when you're relaxing after a late evening cookout. Enjoyable!"
