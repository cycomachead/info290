The two-plus fingers of rocky, bone-white head were extremely fizzy, causing it to diminish in a hurry. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and lots of CO2 bubbles in evidence. A fizzy yellow beer and Mr. Koch may eat his heart out! Nose had a soft maltiness along with a lager-like honey scent. Interesting. Mouthfeel was slightly thin, but the taste was lightly malty with a honey undertone on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry and refreshing, but somehow, I felt as though it were lacking something. It was kind of an underwhelming beer. I would look for something else for the summer.","woodychandler","Jul 01, 2012"

The aroma was your basic toasted pale malts with a clean and crisp hop note in the background. The body was summer light. While the taste had a pleasant enough pale malt character I was expecting more of a citrus zest in there as well. Low bitterness. It was drinkable on the 87 degree day on which I tried it out.","puboflyons","Jun 27, 2012"

The flavor is likewise light, with a mild fruitiness that seems like some combination of banana and orange. The texture is light and fizzy, which works with the mild flavors.

The aroma is a bit off, bit citrus, grains, and overripe fruit. The fruit is the part that gets to me, it just doesn't smell that great. This bad boy tastes a lot better than it smells though. Comes in lemony and grainy at first, then some other citrus flavors come in along with some solid wheatiness to pair with the grains on the finish. Aftertaste is dry and wheaty.

3,-7.4,3,3,3,3,3,"The first notes coming through were of the grain and bready like tones, cereal grains, which were present right away in front of you, were now taking center stage. Soon though some subtle hints would start to come out as well. A nice subtle touch of Banana was apparent, as was the slightest little bit of a hop note. It was hard to discern what kind as it was very subtle, but I would guess a little citrus or fresh grass flavor, not very heavy and just more of background lightness then anything else. Predictably, the first flavor that came through was the grain notes that were so prevalent in the aroma, but quickly these faded, or rather mingles in with some light fruit notes, some yeast showing their muscle. Giving me hints of Banana, some light lemon almost, very nice with a little bit of a kick. The kick probably coming from a little bit of the hops that were poking their head around in there. Light grass now mixing in.","mikesgroove","Nov 17, 2010"

Taste has a subdued sweetness that goes well with the biscuity pale maltiness. Lemon zest, a faint note of grassy hop bitterness and an aspirin note comprise most of the flavor profile.

3.6,11.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste is somewhat sweet, with biting earthy hops and very subtle hints of citrus. I'd think they would want to expose the citrus element more, since this is a summer ale. Still this is a quality ale from Blue Point, something I would have again and would recommend to anyone looking for a solid session beer.","BBM","Sep 25, 2006"
2.78,-14.2,3,2.5,3,3,2.5,"D: The tastiness is a little lacking, but it goes down easy, not-too-filling, Ive definitely had better in the style and quite frankly I was a little disappointed based on what Ive come to expect from Bluepoint Brewing.","TheManiacalOne","Sep 18, 2006"
3.31,2.2,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the crystal clear light golden (yellow?) brew. Head fades at a reasonable pace, with heavy sticky lacing. Aroma is minimally ""beery", the lightest of grains and hops. Taste is light as well, a twinge of sweetness ""overpowered"" by a quick shot of hops crispness. We'll assume they are aiming more at the light beer market, and not the APA market. Mouthfeel is okay, and drinkability is actually not bad, for a summer brew. Could be more cutting edge, but it'll do.","ppoitras","Aug 14, 2006"
3.66,13,4,3,4,3,4,"Pours a beautiful golden color with a long-lasting head. Smells of citrus and wheat...wouldn't doubt if this were actually a wheat brew. Goes down very crisp and it finishes with a little bite of lemon. Very enjoyable summer beer.","JohnnyM2002","Jul 31, 2006"

3.23,-0.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Pours very light orange-tan with good carbonation, slight swirls of head. Nose has light wheats, not much citrus (was expecting more), and a hint of hops. Taste is a little fuller, more hops and light wheat, was expecting some citrus but not really there. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. All in all, easy drinker but not one of my favorites.","aquatonex","Apr 29, 2006"

1.88,-42,4,1,2,3,1.5,"Well this started off good. The beer was looking fine a nice golden ale with a fluffy dense head that dropped back and even left some lacing. Then I smelled it and everything came to an end. I almost poured it out right there, but I thought well if I can eat stinking bishop cheese I can try some of this beer. Well to give you an idea it smelled of cheap macro swill and had some corny DMS thing mixed with a lemon citrus and covering the glass to really get a good smell almost made me pass out. Well the smell carried over into the taste but thankfully it was cold enough to muted the wost of it. Suprisingly I was able to finish the whole bottle despite the smell and I opened a second one to make sure I didn't get a bad bottle, that one mostly fed the drain. Best part was the nice balanced carbonation and decent body.","Higravity","Jul 15, 2005"

4.18,29,4,3.5,4,5,5,"Smell is very subtle, some light fruityness, some lemonyness, but I wanted more. Taste is a bit dry, sweet, light- this is the kind of taste I wish every Coors or Bud or all those kinds of beers would taste like. Taste and mouthfeel are both extremely refreshing and lively. Bubbly, not too watery, no bad aftertaste- simply refreshing. Very drinkable- it's ligh, it's cold, it tastes good, and you definitely keep going back for more. Great beer, especially for a hot day.","scooter231","Jun 13, 2005"

3.55,9.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light and dry, pale malt scent with some lemon zest. The taste is decent as well. It has a light pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and a bit musty. There is a bit of lemon as well; not bad. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average summer brew. It's nothing special, but it drinks well on a hot day.","WesWes","Jul 23, 2004"
3.78,16.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"The taste is all about hops. Light, and not mindblowing, but enough to impart a slightly puckering lemony character to this beer. Nothing spectacular. Good mouthfeel, smooth drinking and no strange or gunky aftertaste. Highly drinkable. It's a refreshing brew, and perfect for hot summer days. Nothing spectacular, but a solid beer.","Litterbean","Jul 19, 2004"
3.3,1.9,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer pours pale yellow with a tall white head- it consists of large bubbles that quickly dissipate, though. There is a faint aroma of malt and hops. The flavor is crisp, clean and dry with lingering malt. There is a nice touch of bitterness as well. Overall this is a friendly, well made beer but ultimately uninspiring.","TongoRad","Jun 23, 2004"
3.62,11.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, pours light and clear, suprise, bready nose, with maybe ahint of hoppyness. White head, decent retention and minimal lacing left behind. My favorite aspect of this light, summery quencher/quafer is the mouthfeel. it was soft, rounded and very smooth, not what I would expect from an everyday summer type brew. All together, decent stuff. Cant go too wrong here as long as its fresh and cold.","Billolick","Aug 17, 2003"

3.86,19.1,4,3,4,4,4.5," Blindfolded, I'd have probably guessed it was a Golden Ale and a good one at that. Maybe a Kolsch but not a Summer Wheat. In any event, aftre drinking the first bottle, I wished I could have obtained a full 6-pack.","Greenlabel","Aug 15, 2002"
3.68,13.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Very interesting take on an ale that looks and acts like a cross between a pilsener and a weizen but doesnt lose its ale character. Great summer beer, went exceedingly well with a pot of mussels and fries. If beerfinancier is asking for another, get me one too!","nomad","Jul 06, 2002"
3.8,17.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Nice golden hue, with little head even when poured vigorously.  Some flowerly aromas are noticeable. Crisp and delightful, it has that ""ale"" tang of fruitiness.  Hops cling to your tounge, but not too long, nor does it distract from any food that you might be eating.  An extremely tasty and drinkable brew- it is prefect for summer.  I also liked this beer because it did NOT (at least to me) have that lemony flavor that accompanies summer beer nowdays.","AaronRed","Jun 20, 2002"
3.94,21.6,3,4,4,4,4,"I thought this was a delicious ale, and I didnt notice anything floating in it, possibly because it was on draught. I've had the bottle, and there is some weird floaters in there, but they didn't bother me. There is little head and is a nice amber in color. Goes down smooth, slightly sweet, and very refreshing. I had it on tap at the Lobster Roll, arguably the best seafood restaurant in the Hamptons. Went very well with the food. This is all over Long Island, so if you get the chance, try it out.","IrishRedRock","Beers"
