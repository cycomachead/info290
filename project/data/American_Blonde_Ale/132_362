Very well made, although I’d prefer if a bit more hops were applied to render just a bit more bitterness overall, esp. at the relatively high alc. content based on a simpler flavour profile.","wl0307","Jul 22, 2013"

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Light golden in color with a medium level of haze and cloudiness to it that obscured a bit of the sunlight poking through. Nice head of white capped the top and settled down smoothly and evenly, creating a decent broken crown that ringed the side of the glass and kept some nice lacing. Aroma was light, and this would be a trend throughout the day. Light notes of peach and light grain are really all that is coming through right now. Warming brought a smidge of citrus to it, but nothing really standing out here for me at all. Crisp, clean flavor though with light hints of clove and heather that sat on top of a base that resembled mostly light fruits and hints of grain","mikesgroove","Aug 07, 2011"

The taste was on the light side, not a whole lot going on here really. It's got just some grains up front and a little bit of a tart hoppiness in the aftertaste. I wouldn't need to have this beer again. I wasn't really impressed.","Knapp85","Apr 21, 2011"

4.04,10.1,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Alot going on here with the ginger being refreshing and zesty. The coriander softens things a little bit, but then some wheat tang comes out and is finished off by an ample supply of grassy, floral hop flavor and plenty of bitterness. A nice progression of flavors parade across the palate but the carbonation might be a bit high. This is one of the better Rogue beers I have had, a nice summertime brew. Still a bit pricey at 6.99 a bomber, but worth a try every now and again.","twiggamortis420","Jun 24, 2010"

4.05,10.4,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The bottle i have is called Shark Tooth Ale and has a shark and a stingray on the front along with the usual Rogue spiel about the brew i gotta admit im a big fan of Rogue especially the way they tell you everything about the brew the only thing that they leave out is the ABV anyways onto the beer it pours a vibrant golden colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger cloudy sky looking head and a nice neat rim of lacing a very attractive looking brew if i do say so myself,the aroma is straight out corriander mixed with ginger,freshly cut grass and a little paw paw,it has an above average mouthfeel which is nicely carbonated with the herbal combination of Ginger & Corriander first to the hit the palette which is followed by a nice hit of grassy fruity hops to beautifully balance out the tailend of this brew to make the Herbs not as dominant as they first smell and i wont say suprisingly cos it is Rogue but this beer is very sessionable especially for someone who doesnt like their Ginger or Corriander in their brews and think if you closed your eyes and smelt it you would say its a Witbier and if you didnt smell it and just drank it you would say more of a blonde and would be interested to see how it tastes with less or different Herbs or even none at all,will buy again.","ADZA","Mar 11, 2010"
3.83,4.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall: Another nice offering from Rogue. The steady carbonation is nice to look at and the taste is nice. The coriander is a nice surprise addition that leaves a hint of unfiltered wheat beers.","ianjsullivan","Feb 16, 2010"

Nose is a nice mix of creamy wheat and soft fresh hops with notes of soapy minerals. Enters the mouth creamy smooth with rich and slightly bitter wheat feel coating the mouth. A thick mouthfeel is created by the malty backbone and bitter bite but it is nicely filling and quite full. This is a very even drinking nicely balanced beer.

Aroma of cascade hops is providing some floral notes as well as some medium bitterness. Taste is mostly dominated by the mix of hops and I thought was lacing some malt characteristics. Body is not as full as I would have expected with some great carbonation. I personally think that this beer could have been more rewarding with a bigger malt profile.","Phyl21ca","May 31, 2007"

The aroma is a musty malt smell, reminiscent, in my opinion, of the Oskar Blues Dale's Pale Ale. Nice enough, but nothing spectacular. And seriously, if they're going to try to package this as a "bitter" then at least put give us a hoppy aroma. The taste is nice. A bit sweet up front, with some hints of cut grass and strawberries; mostly malt flavors. I get a little bit of the hoppy bitterness in the finish, but I would hardly call this beer a "bitter." What a misnomer. The mouthfeel is thin, but not too weak. Overall, I'd call this a proper session beer, and I could see having it again sometime. But the labeling is weird, as this is not what I would call a "bitter." I know Rogue cranks out a lot of brews (too many?) but there's no need to re-package something and give it a different name if it's really something else. Just my personal opinion.","Atlas1","Mar 10, 2007"

Leaves moderate lacing. Smell is malty first and foremost, bread and yeasts taking the lead, with mild spiciness and a hint of light fruits as well. Hops are noticeable, just a light citrus aroma floating in the background. Taste is very well balanced, leaning to the malty side but with an obvious hop presence as well. Bread, lightly toasted, is the first impression, with butter and sweetness as well. Orange and spices in the mix too, with a light herbal hop finish that is drier but doesn't overwhelm the rich malt profile in the finish. Mouthfeel is full and rich, very well carbonated, and drinkability is very good. Nice brew, light on the hops but with a distinctive niche all its own in the Rogue lineup.","Mandrake","Dec 04, 2006"

The taste is pretty good. Floral hops, pretty balanced carbonation ending in some light bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty light with a but of carbonation but not too much. Drinkability is not too bad but since I found it to be pretty average either way I would say if you were at a bar that offered a great selection of beers you would probably want to move on to something else after a glass or two. At least I would. Overall not a bad beer at all. Alot better then many common beers out there but not one of my faves. Overall I would say pretty unoffensive,","TheBeerWolf","Sep 17, 2006"

The smell is malty but drier than I had expected ultimately a bit hoppy on the nose. The taste of this one disappoints sweet fruity malts up front and some grainy smooth tones are nice in the middle but aside from some dry "cheekiness" in the finish...there isn't any thing...not much finish at all.

Kinda dusty and yeasty, with a doughy presence. Fairly clean otherwise. The flavor start with crackly, grainy pale malt. Wheat? Lighter medium bodied, with softer carbonation. Pretty smooth, aided by the yeast pour. Notes of straw and dried grass, a hint of apple, movinf directly into Modestly hoppy finish, floral and a touch citric, with restrained bitterness. Not a lot going on here, but it's easy drinking and tasty. Nothing I'd go out of my way for again, nut it's nice to try it once. Exactly like their Oregon Golden Ale. Why does Rogue rename their beers like this? Nevertheless, it goes great with my udon noodles. Not too substantial, compliments the meal, and easy drinking.

It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes toastey and bitter. The hop bitterness lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good English-style bitter. It has tremendous flavor and a fine aroma. It's not as dry as some bitters which sets it apart.

Pours a nice light amber color, slightly orange, murky, with a smallish white head. Smell is hard to pick out, but is full of pale malts and lightly spicy hops. Tasted is much the same - mostly a pale malty grainy beer, but a decent amount of spicy herbal hops add a bit of peppery zest. Tastes like a more malty version of their Uber Pils, which I like better. Nice smooth texture but a little sluggish. It seems like this beer is trying to be something it isn't. Maybe it's trying to be a lager or pilsner but doesn't quite have the crispness? Anyway, it's a decent brew but with the line-up of Rogue beers there's no reason why you'd want to pick this out of the bunch. It'll work in a pinch though.","twelvsies","Aug 27, 2005"

The aroma on this brew is remarkable: bread-like malt, butter, bubblegum, esters, yeast, malt, and hops. Theres a lot going on in there. Theres a lot of flavors that come out in the taste as wellcitrus and caramel, and a lot of sweetness. Hops get turned up in the hindtaste, and balance the whole affair very nicely. Its pretty highly-carbonated, and of medium body. Slightly slick on the tongue. Resiny, notably acidic hops poke out into the flavor from time to time, but arent nearly as assertive as a lot of west coast brews. Complex, but the flavors seem somewhat haphazard, and dont always mesh together in a seamless manner. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Its not a masterpiece, but I have few complaints. Id have a few more of these if I had them on hand.","Suds","Aug 27, 2005"

Nose is yeasty bread with a dose of juicy citric hops. Taste has the same yeasty breadlike character, with a fair amount of butterscotch coming through and a citric small hop bite. As I make my way through the beer and it warms the hops become more assertive like I expect from Rogue. As far as mouthfeel goes, this really killed the beer for me, as it was way undercarbonated---felt like an ESB. Also a little on the thin side. Reading other reviews, it seems like my undercarbonation might have been a fluke, so I'll give it another chance, but as it is this is my first disappointment from Rogue.","cubedbee","Jul 27, 2005"

I should almost give it a 5 here, but considering that it is supposed to smell like an APA it is lacking the cascade aromas. Other than the initial floral bite the cascades are destroyed by the Kent Goldings and the heavy malt profile provided by the Munich malt. I just read on their website that this is a 2001 limited edition bottling? Can this be so?

Retention was average as it slipped quickly to a fizzy cap. This cap lasted awhile though. Subsequent lacing was spotty and it clung poorly. Aside from the vast haziness of the liquid there isnt anything notable about the appearance. The nose lacks that typical Rogue aroma. Damn shame. I guess it is cool to be different. Fruity (apricots mainly, hints of mushy apples) upfront before the nose turns malty in the middle with a buttery undercurrent. Light kisses of spice from the hops I assume. This is the most muddled bouquet Ive ever encountered from Rogue. The potency is on the low side of moderate. I do like what I smell; it is inviting but not very articulate. The palate is pretty damn dull. Im surprised. Im disappointed. I like the spicy zip in the middle and the butter/malty mess at the end but the beginning is empty. It is earthy and juicy throughout (there is an small array of fruits like apricots and citrus zest). Weak toasty malts. Soft sweetness. This beer needs food. I think it would work well at a BBQ on a hot summer day, assuming the food it tangy sweet. This beer is very tame. This beer cant be from Rogue. Right? I mean the palate is just above average. The aftertaste is citrusy and sweet with a kiss of butter. Messy. Again, it needs food. Almost medium in body, the carbonation is low but natural and it seems to work well with the disheveled flavor profile. This is a lazy beer. Overall, this beer is okay and thus drinkable to a point. But what is the point? There are too many great beers on the market that are in the same realm as this one. I might try this beer again but I wont go out of my way to do so.

I popped the cap and a huge head developed out of the bottle. Poured out a nice golden color with a nice decent enough head on it. Aroma of malts, citrus notes and some hops blend in as well. Almost like an IPA. Taste was quite interesting. Hops attack quickly and last all the way through, even through the aftertaste, but like most Rogue beers, the hops seem controlled. Some citric notes and malts mix in towards the middle and end, and some hints of lemon. Almost like carbonated tea in a way. I'm glad I review this beer, because it is quite interesting.

The smell is relatively simple with some earthy malts and a bit of hops present. Has a small bit of earthy chocolate smell, as if from a stout. The taste is earthy as well, with a strange starchy flavor (not offensive, just curious) that tastes somewhat like a raw potato. It has a slightly off metalic flavor to it as well, which masks the hoppiness. The mouthfeel is dry and smooth, with bubbles that tingle on the back of the roof of the mouth. An alright brew, although it has a bit of a strange flavor","FranklinPCombs","Mar 11, 2004"
3.87,5.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"I poured it straight out of the characteristic screened bomber into a pint glass; very little cascading, and it settled to a mostly clear middling to dark amber with just a bit of a white foam. The smell is enticing: subtle hops, lightly filtered by sweet citrus, cedar, and caramel, suggesting a solid malt backbone. The mouth feel is thin to medium, accentuated by some uptempo carbonation, and there is an underlying buttery smoothness. The taste is rather fine; the ale opens with a tartness, dulls a bit in the middle act, but finishes strong with a balance of bitters and hops.","longpondbeerman","Mar 11, 2004"

I've tried 9 or 10 of them and they were all pretty aggressively bitter, even their American Amber was assertive. Finely crafted beers and a brewery that deserves a lot of respect, but I find the high hop rate a bit boring. It's pretty easy to throw a ton of hops in a beer.

The taste has a pretty good hops bite, but there's also some light caramel malt and a tiny bit of butteriness (diacetyl). This brew reminded of Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold (although I think the GL brew is better). It's a very lager-like ale. It's light-bodied, yet fairly full-flavored.

The label describes this as a "hop bite," though it's hardly the sort of bite one would expect from a "shark's tooth." More like a mildly ill-tempered guppy. Light bodied with a slightly dry finish.

Assertive grapefruit laced bitterness upfront in flavor, immediately followed by mellow, dryish, toasty Munich malt and pseusosweet residual dextrins. Understated malt character, with a minimal caramel malt presence. Well rounded, lightly citrusy hop flavor. Dextrinous and slightly slick mouthfeel perhaps from a high mash temperature. Finishes cleanly bitter w/ note of dry crackers perceptible with an exhale. Yet another unique Rogue brew.
