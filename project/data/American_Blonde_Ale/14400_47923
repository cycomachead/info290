The typical white grapefruit and evergreen hop tastes that we associate with Ninkasi are not restrained in this brew. Some roasted flavors combined with caramel and pale malts to provide a much stronger grain presence and bigger body than most blondes. This one is an American blonde that is not wimpy. One shade blonder than SNPA, with a hint of classic Ninkasi.","sam_bliss","May 07, 2013"

It drinks closer to an APA than a blonde ale, with the bitterness being fresh, pungent and with a blend of a German herbal/minty/spicy hop flavors and a secondary American citrus character. The malt character is less noticeable here, with a blend of biscuit and toast. Mildly sweet and moderately oily on the finish, this beer is medium-light in body and slightly over-carbonated. The finish has a lingering bitterness that's quite pleasing, with an herbal/minty character. Alcohol is well-hidden, but in all honesty, there's no reason this beer couldn't be brewed at 4.5% - just look at Victory's Summer Love, which combines German hops and a blonde ale remarkably well.

Aroma of lightly toasted and biscuit malt, faint hops, reminiscent of a light pilsner. Flavor of mild bready and biscuit malt, sligthly nutty, finishing with dry bittering hops with light herabl notes. Medium bodied. Flavors are appropriate for a light Spring ale; but nothing really stands out and could use slightly more hop flavor to balance the bitterness in the finish.

3.83,7.6,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Loads of carbonation in this beer. It looks like a spring (blonde) ale should look like, light and crisp, the color is golden yellow, or blonde if you will. It is a little hazy, you can't see through it really at all, which is surprisingly nice. The head is a nice two fingers and it is sticking around for a while, it looks fluffy and pillowy, and completely white. The appearance on this is pretty impressive. The smell is nice, it smells like spring! It just smells super refreshing and nice and crisp. It has a nice light hop smell and a sweet malty finish on the smell as well. It also smells a little citrusy and it might have some floral notes as well. A little complex, but not too much on the smell, either way it smells nice! Not as much flavor as I would have liked on the taste. The hops and malts are really skimping out on this beer. I mean that is kinda to be expected because it is a blonde ale, but it's a little more than I would have liked. On the plus side it is very refreshing, and it has some nice citrus characteristics and some flowery taste to it. It tastes like spring to me, which is really nice, I just wish there was more of that flavor all around. Overall, tasty, but I wish they increased all the flavors one notch! Mouthfeel is pretty good, normal for a blonde ale, and the drinkability is very high, higher than I should give it credit for, the taste would indicate low drinkability, but since I want more of that flavor that I'm only getting a little bit of, and because it's very crisp and refreshing, it just makes me want more and more of it. Overall, a well done beer, not too impressive on the taste, but it is so crisp and refreshing that it makes me want to give it a good grade.","MaltsOfGlory","Mar 20, 2011"

Offers a moderate body for the style given its texture, with a good balance of background citric sweetness, though not bitter by any means. Rather heavy in character for a Blonde Ale, adding some depth to the style. Nice drinkability overall and rather dry on the finish, yet a firm carbonation holds up to give the beer a creamy feel.

3.68,3.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer is a clear copper-amber color with a centimeter of resilient, sticky foam. The aroma combines caramel malt and flowery hops. The body is medium in body as sweet and grainy malt spill into a moist center. The mixture of hops is pleasant with both pine and citrus notes. This is a nice drinkable beer.

Looks like it'll be refreshing, though there's not much of a smell to it. The taste is dominated by the malt which tastes a bit like straw and a bit like bread. Not a hop taste to be found, though, no taste of alcohol either. It's ok when it's very cold, but as it warms up it becomes even stranger tasting. Not the best of Ninkasi's spectacular line of beers.","kdoc8","May 19, 2009"

Aroma is of caramel, slight citrus and a touch of butter/diacetyl but it isn't that vibrant. Flavor mirrors the aroma except for more citrus hops with some toasty malts. Its a light bodied beer that is slick because of the present diacetyl. Its a decent beer out of the bottle but the tap version was seemed much fresher and more flavorful.","DiabolikDUB","Apr 30, 2009"
3.37,-5.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Aroma is a bit woody, some straw, and a bit of metallic hop spice. Some diacetyl/buttery flavors in here, bleh. Some DMS cooked veggies too. Some grapenut graininess.

Right now I am glad to have bought it. A slightly vigorous pour gives it a light amber orange color with a 2 finger head, and a slight head retention and good lacing. Smell is mostly fresh hops with a little bit of light malt in the background. Taste is orange zest and floral hops, with a bit of roasted malt. Hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer, and makes me think of how some of the better pale ales out there would be if they were fresh.","nkersten","Beers"
