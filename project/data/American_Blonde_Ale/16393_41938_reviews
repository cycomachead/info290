"O: Aside from being a little overcarbonated, I really enjoyed this beer. Nice to drink while sitting in a lawn chair. It's certainly a thirst quencher and would go great with spicy foods, like Mexican, Curry, etc."

"Pretty much as clean and well constructed as a blonde ale is going to get, the honey and biscuit malt gets to be a bit much as it warms. Clean mineral finish and light airy hops are just about perfect. Rating to style, this one gets a high grade."

"O: Very solid blonde ale. If there were just a bit more complexity on the nose and in the mouth, it would be an outstanding example of the style."

"This beer is medium to light bodied. It doesn't leave any residue but is rather dry on the finish. It will dry your tongue out to a point where it almost feels as though its leaving something behind."
"4.5 D: This beer is damn drinkable. It's tasty and refreshing. No problems at all. Simply great."
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy tan head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, fruit, and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate that lingers long after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable and refreshing."

"On draft at Hops and Pie, $6 pint. This was listed as a kolsch on the menu. Aroma was slightly fruity, I guess it could be a kolsch. Flavor lacked the crispness I would expect and also had a sort of dirty quality that may have been the malts. I didn't much care for this and I'm not sure how close this hews to the style."

"Overall, this is an interesting experience of highs and lows but ultimately taste wins out."
"Mission hits the market with a fine Kolsch-style ale which is characterful enough to appease the craft beer crowds but uses enough finesse to win over adjunct lager buyers with ease. Its a wonderful ale that's very forgiving with food and mood ranges."

"This stood out for me."
"Carbonation give a bit of a prickly feel while remaining pretty fluffy. Crisp, yes, and moderately smooth, at least the mouthfeel isn't off."

"I don't dislike this, but I don't know if I'd have it again. The flavor isn't bad, there just isn't much there."

"Overall: It is a very drinkable beer for summer. I would buy again."
"actually self titled a kolsch, this is more of a german American hybrid. it pours a mostly clear golden blond color, with just a thin head that fades fast, nothing special to look at. the nose is slightly fruity, with pilsner malts in the background and some german feeling yeast that's both doughy and dry. the flavor of this ale is very light, with some straw-like malts and just a dusting of hops coming through. mellow fruit, although it flashes too quick to properly identify it. finish is mildly bitter, a little contaminated, as if by minerals, hard water or something, I don't know. good feel though, drinkable nice and easy. carbonation is much better than it appears, and the body is only light. a good summer quencher, but not a beer that has anything new to offer. I think the ipa is the best of the mission beers so far, but I still have the Russian imperial in the fridge, so there is some hope remaining. a beer my Molson drinking father would adore. for me, just another day at the office."

"I have a couple others from this brewery to try this weekend so I look forward to those after this good experience."

"A very forgettable ale that does bring both flavors of a blond and a klosh but doesn't really make you want to come back for more. OK I guess."

"Overall - not a bad tasting brew at all, but not terribly intriguing to think about."
""

"Highly drinkable and tasty if mundane ale, very easily sessionable despite being just at the high end strength-wise for that. Very thirst-quenching. Nothing unique but nothing to complain about either."

"Brilliant golden flowing carbonation, bright white head, which slowly fades away and leaves speckled lace patterns across the sides of my glass. Light kiss of herbal hops mild citrus note, smooth grainy bread filled blonde ale on the nose. Flavor light easy going, beer doesn't challenge the senses to the extreme but definitely a well executed warm weather beer that would come in handy in the summer on this coast and yearly on the left coast. Even malt balance light herbal hops, biscuit malt clean finish. Simple light bodied ale, with ample carbonation smooth clean finish minimal booze. Overall impressive simplicity quite enjoyable there's nothing wrong with any of the Mission beers I've come across."
"DOA"

"Overall not bad, but seems like it's missing something. It is a Kolsch but more like an ale version of a pilsner, lots of toasty grainy malts, straw, and plenty of noble hops, with a slight metallic twinge and a light and slightly crisp but more ale like finish. I think it would have been better with a lager yeast, or if they had gone more kolsch like... then again they call it a blonde ale and more ""kolsch-style"" so it's hard to really judge it that way."

"Taste is similar, yeasty apples, bread dough, light peppery grassy bitterness under the light sweetness. It is light ans simple, but solid and well-rounded, and holds up well."

"D- drinkable yes. More of a summer brew though"
""
"Overall: A damn drinkable blonde. I'd definitely drink this again."
""
"This could be a decent quaff except for the peculiar whiff of spoiled fruit flavor. Mission makes some good brews but this is not one of the stars."
"Nice level of carbonation, slight amber to the gold color and tight healthy head."
"O: Not something that I would consider worth having again. Only got less tasteful as it warmed."
"O: Not really a good example of the style. Their hefe is amazing so I know what they can do, but I wasn't a fan of this one."
"Mouth feel: Medium bodied, clean after taste, effervescent. Pretty quenchable."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Bright straw yellow with a deep haze. Poured with a fizzy white head that quickly disappeared. Prominent bready aroma with spice, lemon and yeast. Buttery smooth with subdued but tangy carbonation. Bready/biscuity malt flavors in the beginning lemon and yeast through the middle with a faint hint of banana. The tangy carbonation then ushers in a quick hint of spice before transitioning to a biscuit and bitter lemony ending. Finishes semi-dry with a lingering yeast flavor. A nice hot weather beer. Very easy to drink with moderate flavor complexity."
"Bit of lightly sweet grain in flavor, medium bodied and with a decently lingering finish. Light pils flavor carries throughout. Soft and light yet without much of a spice footprint."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. I am a middle-pouring drinker, and this glass completely filled with all foamy white head in an instant. After letting it settle and continuing to pour, the beer took almost 5 minutes to pour completely. I would say that denotes a solid sign of overcarbonation. The beer is an extremely light and pale straw-yellow coloring, again with the big bubbled, white, chunky head that finally settles into a manageable one inch level. Aromas of bright, sweet lemon zest and slightly sour tones. Also some scents of toasted oats. Flavors a bit muted, but a backbone of crisp, wet hops slips in and hits the back of the mouth. Bits of smoke and toasted malts riding the hoppy foundation. The beer is very wet in mouth, both light and slick. Minimal sour and toasted aftertaste, with a short lived finish. Not an overwhelmingly pleasant beer, and when added to the time involved just to pour the damn thing, it really was disappointing."
"Drinkability: I would rate this fairly high on the drinkability scale. It is not my preferred style, but I think it is a beer that could please a lot of people if I were one to limit myself to a single option at a gathering. This beer at a BBQ on a hot summer day would be amazing. Its actually dangerously drinkable, which is a quality I like in a beer, because I think its important to get those you love sauced up at social gatherings. :)"
"D - quite drinkable; I wish there was a little more going on here, though"
"Drinkability: this beer was nicely quaffable and pleasantly refreshing."
"D: A solid, non-offensive KÃ¶lsch, probably better local."
"Tasty enough, but not as smooth as a great Kolsch should be. The grainyness in the mouthfeel detracts and the bitterness is a bit heavy for the style. Also not screamingly fresh, which I think is essential in a lightweight beer of this nature."
"Drinkable enough, but not a style I especially enjoy."
"D: Drinkability was average and fair, being a bit sweet upfront with not much hoppiness to counter balance which may limit consumption for those who get sugary shock rather easily. Some acidity is detected upon the swallow. Overall a fair rate of consumption though unlikely repurchase by style."
"D - Okay, but a little too corny/grainy. Almost like a macro adjunct beer, but with a little more flavor."
"I've had a few different versions of the style now, so I'm not quite as new to it. Mission's isn't incredible, but it's still a light, easy-drinking beer with a pleasing flavor. My biggest complaint is that the vinous flavor gets overshadowed by noble hop bitterness. I like the really grapey ones best, and while the aroma is nice and grapey, the hops overpower the vinous note once you take a sip. Also, the mouthfeel seems to be lacking the effervescence of more traditional versions. They need to crank up the carbonation. All that said, it would be a very nice session beer. It's mildly sweet with a good hop bite in the finish and quite quaffable."
"Nothing extreme: It wont frighten away the non-beer-geek friends that come over, but with enough character that you wouldn't secretly cringe a little if they brought a bottle over with them for you."
"An all right beer but not a great one. A beer really made more for your average Budweiser drinker than the beer connoisseur."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable beer that paired wonderfully with my meal (grilled mako, smoked yukon gold mash, grilled zucchini, all drizzled with vanilla oil). The vanilla oil may have made the match. I really have never liked blondes before, but this is an amazing beer. I went out on a limb because I know Mission makes some great lighter styles and it paid off."
