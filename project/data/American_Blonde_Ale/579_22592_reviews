"1st beer in Severna Park"
"This was on-tap at the Astros spring training facility in Kissimmee, FL. On a hot 90+ degree day where I literally turned red from sunburn, I couldn't have asked for a better beer. It was a good hoppy while being exceptionally refreshing and having a clean finish. I walked away very impressed. I really like the Kona offerings."
"Not sure golden ales are supposed to be this hoppy, but it was too bitter for my taste."

"Overall - I've had bad experiences with Kona so I wasn't expecting much, but was actually pleasantly surprised.  3.75 paws."
""
"My ""go to"" beer, one of my favorites. Clean, crisp, and smooth yet has enough character to keep it interesting. To me, it is what I base all other golden ales on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very light golden orange color, the smell is faintly metallic, but that doesn't carry over to the taste.  It has a malty flavor that isn't overpowering.  Smooth and flavorful, no bad beer aftertaste at all.  Mild carbonation gives it a good overall feel and taste."
"Darker than I'd expect for the style. A little too malty for my taste."
"Not fond of this one."
""
"O: This is not a bad blonde ale. I could see this really hitting the spot on a hot day."
""
"Overall: Quite delicious, very refreshing with loads of citrus zest."
"If you are in Hawaii drinking this, how can you not enjoy this beer?"
""
"Overall : it's a good ale, and would be a superior one if it weren't for the rush of garbage hop that comes in halfway through the taste. That being said, I'd have it again, and share it with friends. It is one of the best golden ales I've had, and is satisfying and smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Really good and sweet. But all in all It's alright"
""
""
""
""
"How this could he anything less then a 5 blows my mind. Light, crisp, refreshing, and that hint of island that makes you feel like your in hawaii. Very unique."
""
""
""
"Brew pours a golden-yellow in color with a thinner white foamy head. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of some yeast, grass with a hint of fruit even. More going on with the taste as there are some light hops, grass and hay. Very tasty and goes down easy. Lighter-bodied with perfect carbonation. Really liked this brew and a easy solid ""8" if not a ""8.5"" Hang ten baby!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic! A great session beer. Surprisingly light on the tongue and smooth but flavorful."
""
"Overall - Fairly mediocre. Nothing to really get too shook up about. Its not bad, but just isn't anything real good either. Just grab it in a mix and match pack, drink it one time, and decide you won't buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good brew, not outstanding, but very enjoyable."
""
"Perfect light beach beer, lacking in flavor a little"
""
""
""
"2.25 on all accounts.  Outlier?  More like website glitch"
"O - Normally I like Kona and I understand this is meant to be a blonde ale, but it's still a big time fail. Just watery, bland, and generally terrible."
""
""
"Pours a transparent gold color with a quickly disappearing head.  Slightly flat with a watery feel.   Light bodied with some noticeable hops,  but not enough to carry the beer and little to back them up.  This is a small step up from their forgettable lager,  but not worth the price."
""
""
"Overall one of my favorite Golden Ales.  Not the best I have tasted but in the top 5.  Great entry level craft beer for beginners as well."
""
""
""
"Deep golden color with a decent white head. Earthy citrus hop, with bread and light caramel. Decent brew."

"Ok, nice color, head, lacing, blah blah blah. Let's get to the thick of things. There is something I like very much about this beer. This pale ale has a mild aroma which consists of hops, malt and some citrus. The aroma is pleasant. The taste, on the other hand is my favorite. Please do not judge me, but the taste is like a combination of hops, lemony citrus and some good skunk weed from the west coast(no really!!). This pale ale goes above and beyond and balances the citrus and hops so well. This beer is refreshing, feels good on the palate, and leaves you wanting more and more. Well Done, KONA !!!!!!!"

"Faint piney nose, pours golden yellow. Honey citrus taste, poured a 2 finger head, light and easy to drink"

"I only had one of these at a time but it would have been easy to down a few in one sitting given that I never tasted or felt the alcohol. While low on grain and body, there was a hint of bitterness and just enough fruit flavor and crispness to make this easily enjoyable. This would make for a great lawnmower beer when the warmer weather returns but by itself, this was quietly enjoyable."

"Light floral ale. Easy to drink on a very hot and humid Miami afternoon."

"Very pleasant. Appearance is a dark yellow/orange with a white head. The smell was very subtle although there were some hop notes. The taste was very crisp and refreshing with some grapefruit from the hops but overall very mellow. The mouthfeel was nice and light. A nice easy summer beer."

"Like Watermelon Wheat, this beer is extremely underrated. Sad Landshark Lager and other mediocre summer offerings get more recognition than this subtle offering."

"Started off with the beer in the bottle. No fancy glass. The bottle is aesthetically pleasing. Initial taste is light and flavorful. Smooth, but nice amount of carbonation. Alcohol content is on the lower side - allows you to enjoy the taste a bit more. Hint of sweet, and hint of hops. A good summer time beer."

"I actually drank this at home but would have loved to have had it at the beach as it does a good job of giving out enough flavor but holding that thirst quenching personality."
"I would get this brew again."
""
""
"BOD 4/11/14. Pours a clear amber that is slightly beyond golden with a faint hint of red. Normal head with weak lacing retention. Excellent nose of tropical hops (mango, passion fruit) over a light biscuit sweetness. Almost light medium bodied with an above normal carbonation level that effervesces nicely on the finish. The taste profile is well balanced between hop flavor and sweetness. It is more spicy than tropically oriented, which is surprising based upon the hop bill and nose, over a nice biscuit sweetness background. The finish is crisp and effervesces into a tropical peppery note."
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall a solid 3.25 for Big Wave Golden Ale from Kona Brewing Co. Its very light and refreshing. Just a little TOO light, or I would've ranked it higher. But in summation a very good quencher. Not life changing, just above decent. I may buy this brew again"
"O: A highly flawed, but serviceable session beer. Sweetness gets a bit grating and the flavor of the hops doesn't shine as much as the aroma would suggest but better than some similarly styled brews, but not by much."
""
""
"The Blonde and I were both beginning to sweat in anticipation, or maybe it was just attributable to the heat and humidity, but I was quick with the pour. The pseudo-cascade died down, creating two fingers of rocky, bone-white head that began to fall, leaving nice lacing in its wake. The color was a bright, sunshine-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4), like liquid sunshine in my glass! This would be far more heartening on a dreary winter day, but it was already hot and humid here in my kitchen. Nose was very fruity - peaches, mangoes, papaya, guava, even coconut. Aloha, honey! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was entirely fruity, like Juicyfruit chewing gum or a roll of Tropical Fruit Life Savers. My my. I stand behind all of the fruits that I mentioned on the nose with the exception of coconut. I may have been hallucinating on that one. Finish was semi-sweet, not quite semi-dry, but quite refreshing on this occasion."

"This golden ale is my least favorite of the kona brews. Going inot this I am not a fan of golden ale. The pale, pitiful yellow color reminds me of budweiser. Luckily, the beers smells much better. Once I take a swig I am again reassured that this is much more than a cheap domestic. Hints of citrus in an otherwise bland unsurprising swig. I like it though its somewhat refreshing. overall I rate this beer 3.00 okay. I would not recommend this to a friend however I would recommend this if your other options are unfavorable or unknown. Try it at least once, right?"
"O: I don't think it's as interesting as it could be - typical for a Kona beer, its trump card is how light and refreshing it is. Flavor-wise, it could have accomplished more, especially considering it uses Galaxy and Citra (two of my favorites). This will definitely make my rotation for hot weather duty, though."

"12oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer pours pale golden in color with a medium white head and is almost but not quite crystal clear. Pleasant, mild, floral hop aroma. Flavor is in line, mild and neutral. Somewhat fizzy, but drinkable. Slightly nutty grain flavor pleasantly complemented by tropical fruit hop flavors. This beer mostly succeeds in being inoffensive and drinkable. The exception, of course, is that it's really too boring to be a session ale."

"It's light, very crisp, and creamy in the carbonation. It could be a little cleaner in the feel from the grains, and it dries a little early,"

"Light yellow and slightly hazy with a white cap that starts about a half inch with a vigorous pour and fades to an eighth inch. Big on floral and tropical fruit notes on the nose very light bittering, reminds me a of hopped up version of a wheat beer. Very sessionable would be great to have in a cooler on the beach in Kaua'i soaking up some rays. Pick one up if you're looking to add some tropical feel to the next time you lounge in your hammock."

"Light grainy and toasted malty taste up front and then the grassy hops come in with a bit of a bitter kick at the finish. Neatly balanced. It went down quick and smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Inoffensive and lackluster aroma. Thin and watery on the palate, Not much on the finish. I could drink this all day long and get a decent buzz without getting out of control. I think of this brew as a high-end Corona."

"Overall I thought this was decent beer and a solid example of a Blonde/Golden Ale, it had most of the aspects that I would expect from the style, it had a pretty bright aroma, but I found myself wishing it tasted more like it smelled. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp, not filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these when it's warm out, but I think after two I would start to get bored with it. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty nice and I thought it was the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that taste, it came off a little bland and I wish it was a little more like the aroma. I might buy this beer if I want an easy drinking beer, but I don't think it's something that I need to keep in the fridge and I think it's worth trying at least once, but I doubt it will be an instant favorite. I think it's a nice beer to enjoy in warm weather. All in all I thought this was a fairly solid beer, it wasn't the most memorable, but for a Golden Ale I thought the aroma was pretty memorable and it had a pretty even amount of pros and cons. So far this is my favorite beer from Kona, but it isn't a favorite of the style. Nice job guys, this was a nice easy drinking beer, keep up the solid work."
"A floral and fruity beer. Slight citrus hints that pull all the flavors together. Malty flavors that pull everything together. Great for the hot summer days that you want a different beer. Has a great finish, but not too over powering leaving you wanting to drink more."

"A grand citrus like floral scent for an amazingly drinkable beer. The malts will grab the taste buds quickly flowing to the finish of this beer where the smooth citrus and almost herbal tones will sit in the back of your nose throughout, to aftertaste. So drinkable as would be Hawaii itself if it were a beer, a true vacation in a bottle!"

"Extremely light feel, incredibly floral smell, most notable feature of this beer is the finish.. Almost tastes of hibiscus. A truely incredible beer for a golden! A beer you can defiantly sit and cruise through allll dayyy lonnng! Perfect for a day on the boat with good friends!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I really, really like this one. It's like an Ale version of a nice Wisconsin Lager; simple, malty, and refreshing. It's just so drinkable. I could easily take a 6-pack of this and enjoy every sip."

"Kona Brewing - Like I've written before, I really want to like this brewery, and the latest beers I'm trying are starting to prove me right. This offering, Big Wave, does a pretty decent job. Out of the bottle, it's none too impressive - your normal yellow, run-of-the-mill beer color - not much head, but surprisingly it has good lacing. The odor is absolutely wonderful, fresh and citrusy. Mouthfeel would be outstanding to me if it weren't so carbonated - it just takes away from the feel for me. Taste-wise, I liked it. The brew was bold, fresh, I could taste the citrus and it mixed well with the hops. Unfortunately, there was just something there - I just couldn't grade it outstanding. Overall, it's a good beer, I definitely enjoyed the two I just had..."

"This stuff is easy drinking and a real taste treat. The last entrant in the Kona beer kick. This beer was purchased as part of a variety 12 pack for around 14 bucks at Three Bears Alaska (cheap!)."
"This was a good beer that drank pleasantly. It did not excite in any way but would be ideal for a summer beer as it is very refreshing and with the low abv this could really hit the spot on a hot day."
""
""
""
"A definite summer, or to be more precise, beach beer. Light, refreshing, nice bit of hops, highly sessionable ABV... could have been a very ""eh"" beer, but it's actually very solid for the style. Not super interesting, but tasty enough. Would definitely have this one again, especially in the heat when I want something light. My first (and certainly not last) beer from Kona. Mahalo!"
""

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is surprisingly hoppy, some malts as well. Taste is a good balance of malts and hops, drinks more like a pale ale than a blonde, pretty tasty and well hopped for the style. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and solid beer."

"Overall a very tasty hop forward blonde ale."
""
""

"This has to be one of if not the lightest bodied ales in existence. This unique property is by no means a good things, this beer is boring, bland and unexciting to drink. The aroma smells spicy and hoppy but its all misleading! One sip and you might as well be drinking a bmc beer. Don't buy a six pack of this, maybe get single if you want to try it. As far as kona brewing goes I did like their fire rock pale and their island lager. Those are good beers don't let this one turn you off the rest of their lineup."

"O-the smell and the taste are the same, and it turned out to be a crisp clean beer."
"I'm pretty much a sucker for anything related to Hawaii. Bought the variety pack from Kona, so I'll be reviewing those as well. Eh, nothing too exciting but not worthy of dumping. Decent color, average everything else. Glad it didn't taste like a beer flavored mai tai. Had much worse, had much better."
""
"Very clear golden ale. Nice session with hints of fruit and a floral aroma that do not overwhelm the beer like the waialua wheat does. So not as sweet but a very flavorful ale. Certainly a very good beer with a low alcohol content that is very easy to drink."

""
""
""
""

" The taste is good with some malt flavor which is toasted with some light sweetness and gentle yeast accents with a semi-creamy taste and mild hop in the background. Overall this is a pretty gentle flavored beer with some fresh tasting malt but not a very complex affair, just a pretty well brewed blonde which is easy to drink"

"Part of a pick-six at a local market, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a nice waft of earthy noble hops. Not much maltiness but lots of hops. Pours into. My SAPP with a nice golden color as expected with an off white multi faceted bubble head that recedes slowly. Taste is as expected from the smell a nice highly hopped taste that is not bitter but earthy. Not much malty backbone so the mouthfeel is a little thin. A tasty ale that wouldn't be offensive to any hopheads. Not one to seek out but imbibe able."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 8/14/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light bits of foamy lacing cling down the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pineapple, tangerine, floral, grass, pine, cracker, light bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes with moderate malt presence; and solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pineapple, floral, grass, toast, bread, cracker, light honey, and floral earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, toast, bread, cracker, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant flavor profile with very balanced hop/malt flavors; with a solid amount of robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is a nice blond ale. Solid amount of robustness with a nice balanced hop/malt flavor profile; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
"A good summer beer. Almost a suspicion of citrus. Reminds me of freshly mowed grass during a rain. I can't really find anything bad to say other than I might get tired of this fairly quickly; but I will definitely keep some of this on hand for the summer months for a nice change of pace"

"This is another beer I have loved, hated, liked and now think is just pretty good. Definitely a light summer type of beer. The flavor is pretty solid for such a light beer but I would suggest passing if you are not planning on being at the beach or at a BBQ in the sun and you like a little flavor to your beer. The taste to me seems like a lager with some fruitiness to it. Color is a light gold, not much of a head to it. Smell is light and fruity. If I am drinking this beer I am happy because I am on a beach in the sun :)"

"Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied golden ale that has a nice hop profile but not much else it is a good drinking beer but not great with that funny flavor."

"Overall this is a very well balanced Blonde Ale. If you like the style it is worth trying. If you don't like the style you might want to give this a try on a hot day just for fun."
"Slightly hazy gold with a nice soapy head with spotty bubbles of lacing on the glass. Sweet grass in the nose with soft malt odors; light grain, untoasted bread. Very soft flavors in the mouth; muted without being watery, tastes of water crackers, unleavened bread, lightly spicy hop finish. Very clean, easy and pleasant session beer, tasting like a cream/blonde style of ale."

"Just average."

"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of citrus hops, hint of pine, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, and floral notes. Fits the style of an American Blonde Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, hint of citrus hops, sweet malt, slight sugar, hint of pale malt. Overall, good appearance, decent aroma, body, and blend."
"The smell of the beer is floral and full of hop. Has a golden color to the body with carbonation. The body is similar to other golden ales I've had but has a hoppy and floral taste. The after taste reminds me of sipping an Oolong tea and is just as refreshing. A good beer for a summer day at the beach."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was smooth and even, with a nicely clean finish. Drinkability was as easy as you would expect a low alcohol, ""entry-level"" to be. Overall, not a brew that's going to thrill us beer geeks, but one that is a solid example of the style. Worth a shot if going to a cookout or other event that isn't beer focused."

"Initial drainpour, but then I wanted a crisp clean-ish brew. Cant recommend, but fits the summer profile. Kona can do better, a total miss."

"Very decent brew for a hot summer day -- a nice change of pace from stronger IPAs or another type of summer go-to beer. Pours a very pale yellow with a slight foamy white head. No significant lacing appears on the glass as you finish. The smell is slightly astringent but mostly has a moderate hop aroma. It's a very easy beer to drink as it is not too bitter, not too much carbonation -- very solid choice for a hot day or to pair up with some burgers or ribs on the grill."

"Light carbonation--which I like on a hot summer day--and a nice blonde color. It has a crisp and refreshing flavor. It tastes like a pretty good golden beer and it is worth trying. It is too light for me to enjoy on a regular basis--almost no alcohol."

"O - It is actually better than I anticipated. My friend a macro drinker loved it when he had it in Hawaii. I bought a sixer for him and snuck (sneaked) one. I was not in a hurry to try any Kona beers, but this one was decent enough to make me want to try some others."

"Overall: a good hot weather beer. Flavorful without being too strong, heavy or overpowering."

"solid blonde ale, look is typical, smell is wheaty and neutral. taste is rolling wheat, some citrus and bitter from the hops. overall it's very balanced and has no off flavors, everything jives well here.... brah."

"D- not so bad, if you're a fan of the style. This one really falls somewhere in between a pils and a kolsch as it totally has traits of both. Malt seems to provide nothing but structure which is odd, but the hops are nice enough so yeah like hang ten bro."

"Overall: What the hell is going on here?"
"not a bad golden ale, if a bit bland and generic, its plenty easy drinking. pours perfectly clear golden in color with gently rising bubbles and an inch of white foam that is gone in a few minutes but can be riled back up consistently. the nose is peachy, not sure if its intentional or an off essence, but I personally like it, pale malt profile and a bready ale yeast. the flavor hints of some mild hops up front, but its washed out quick by a big wave (pun intended) of neutral malt flavors that are just on the verge of sweet. finish isn't as clean as the longboard lager, but still pretty quick. not too exciting, but certainly not offensive at all. my dad would love this as a Molson drinker. carbonation is a little light for the style, and the body is super light. its an all day beer with the super low abv and general pleasantness. not something ill seek out again, but a beer that id be more than happy to quaff on the Hawaiian shores."
"Actively unpleasant."
""
"D: At just 4.4% this is a really nice session beer. Much hoppier than I was anticipating. It drinks more like a hoppy Pale Ale. Light crisp and refreshing warm weather brew. Not your typical Blonde and I would say my favorite of the pack."
""
"Overall this is just a filler review since I got a bottle best by August 2012 yet it wasn't offensive or skunked. I bet fresh this beer would be... something."
"This is a rather refreshing, light, very easy to drink, session beer. This would be great on a hot day."
"I can guarantee you that if I find this locally I will be enjoying it on a regular basis.. Might have to put on flip flops though, just so it feels right."

"A very ""fun"" beer, not ""in your face"" at all, just fruity, bubbly and fresh."
"The pilsner-style malts, though very weak, make this one taste almost like a lager. Overall, it is just watery."

"From the 12 oz bottle bought at Ralph's Supermarket in San Clemente."

"Taste-Fruity citrus hops, soft pineapple note, underlying citrus rind. Well-balanced, smooth, fresh and tasty. Fish tacos would fit the bill nicely."
""
""
"O - This is a very tasty golden ale. Bright and refreshing."
""
"It's alright, but I like my blonde ales to be fruitier and maltier."
""
"O - Wow, now this could be very refreshing on a hot day but you still get some hop flavor. I would like to buy this in 6 packs if available in OH."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I really like the aroma and the flavor to a lesser regard...the body is very light...I guess in the heat and sun a low ABV tasty ale like this would drink nicely but I wonder how much better this could be with a little more malt at say a still sessionable 5%?"
""

"O- Below average golden ale. Nothing special about this beer."
""
"Taste also echoes some of these tropical fruits, especially citrus, alongside the rich malty backbone. I get a bit of citrus hoppiness at the finish, too, making this a very enjoyable and easy to drink session ale. Perhaps my favorite of Kona's mainland bottled brews, so far."

"Overall: A decent version of the Blonde ale style. Light and crisp with a nice citrus fruit taste."
""

"Yeah, it's great for some gnar and whatnot, but you don't wanna get one too big... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear golden-straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises old mango, funky lemon peel, mild grass, and a few tablespoons of honey. The taste focuses on the lemon, with a slightly decreased sense of funk, altogether tempered by a crisp, watery biscuit-ish character. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish. Overall, an odd little beer, one that seems to wanna be a lightly fruity blonde, but one that ends up a watered-down and funky husk of its own aspirations."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and has an interesting flavor profile—I can't recall ever having a beer that had a hop profile similar to this."
"This brew is very well balanced with impressive flavor and aroma considering the session strength ABV. I really enjoyed this beer ,which could become a summertime staple for me."

"Pours a crystal clear vibrant gold color with a one inch white head. Head disappears rather quickly leaving a thin lace. Smells of faint floral and grapefruit notes. Taste is very delicate with a very subtle sweetness. Mild fruit/citrus flavor. I didn't pick up much hop flavor but the aroma is there. Easy drinking, reps the style well. Smooth light body."

"Big Wave pours a bubbly golden color with a small head. The aroma is quite nice, it's got fruity hops, citrus, and a bit of grains and sweet malt. The taste brings the grainy malt up front, but it's not too sweet. The citrus and fruit hop flavors, although rather mellow, do a pretty solid job at balancing things out. The grains and a bit of citrus ride out the finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and light, and the drinkability is great. Overall, a tasty thirst quencher."
""
""
""
"Half finger head but nice lacing on a clear golden body. Aroma of wheat, grains, tropical fruit with a slight floral note. Flavor also has a nice balance of tropical fruit and wheat/grains with bready notes. The fruit lingers nicely without being too sweet. light to medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Lease a bit of a sandy feel on the palate in the aftertaste. Nice drinkable beer. More complex than I expected. A nice one to try."
""
""
"Overall - Fantastic smell, decent flavor, but a poor body... still, if they made this the summer release over the Wailua Wheat, I wouldn't shed a tear."
"Pours a bright golden color with a quick flourish of white head. Aroma of very light pale malt with a mild biscuity sweetness and a hint of tropical fruit. Palate is rather, um, neutral. Pale malt with a touch of sweetness and an underlying note of tropical fruit. The sweetness fades on the finish, yielding to a mildly chalky flavor and texture. Body is watery and, again, mildly chalky at the finish. You could do worse than this on a hot day, but it is pretty uninteresting."
"O - a good example of the style."
"Pours a golden orange with a thin white head. Not much retention, and just a hint of laceing. Aroma is of fruit, and grassy hops. Body is light,and crisp with mild carbonation. Taste is sweetart, with a hint of bready malt. Smooth and refreshing. Liked it."
""
""
"O: Overall a beach/poolside refreshment. Tropical hints well suited per locale environment, easy going, well balanced and makes for a easy tropical refresher on a hot hawian summer."
"I really like this beer! It’s really drinkable, refreshing, and quite balanced. My favorite Kona Brewing Co beer!"
""
"This would be a great beer for the summer."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a fair head but it went away really fast, Not very pretty. The beer had a nice golden color to it though and looked pretty normal. I could not believe how bad this beer smelled, YUK! I'm glad it did not taste like it smelled. It smelled like a guys underarms that had been dressed in black all day riding a camel across the dessert. However the taste was really good, very refreshing and had a good grainy corny taste I like. I will buy again."
"Overall – Rather refreshing and easy drinking. While it is not huge on the flavor profile, it does make for a decent session style brew."
""
""

"Pours golden clear with fluffy white foam. good head. Pilsy smell. Clean uncomplicated. Light line of hop woven throughout. Smooth. Just a mellow, run of the mill blonde ale. Nothing remarkable or offensive."
""
""
""
"This poured out with as a really nice clean and clear looking yellowish gold. The head is white a fizzy looking. The retention and lacing are minimal. The smell of the beer has a grainy malt sweetness that it relatively inviting. Some honey-like aromas are coming in there as well. The taste of the beer has the same type of sweetness with a bit of a corn-like flavor. There is minimal bitterness throughout. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied, nicely carbonated and slightly creamy. Overall this beer is very drinkable and refreshing too."
""
""
""
"Medium body, carbonation is tart at the start but fades fairly quickly. It's a pretty innocuous beer, a good step in the correct direction away from mega-lagers. Nothing special but at least some flavor and a more restrained hop profile."
""
"I usually don't care to much for the so called golden ales but this one is quite good for that style of beer."
""
"Overall: I rather like this beer. Stylistically, it's pretty fruity for a golden ale, but I quite enjoy the blend of fruity flavors they managed here. I'm going to hark back to the days of rating a beer's drinkability and say that, overall, this beer is awesome."
""
""

""
"O: A solid blonde ale, good flavour, refreshing. Pretty inexpensive so worth a try."
"O-this is a pretty decent beer. It's very mild yet the flavors are actually quite bold. I could put a lot of this down for sure, though it wouldn't be my beer of choice. It's just an interesting try really. "
""
""
""
"Overall an interesting beer with a shockingly good aroma. P{pretty much this is a thirst quenching beer made to be pleasant but not win any awards. I can see drinking this again."
""
"O - I did enjoy the Golden Wave Ale from Kona Brewing Co. It is a very easy drinking light style year-round beer. Very refreshing beer to drink on any given day."
""
"Cool, Kona gets it. This is an easy-drinking summer beer (of course I say this in summer) with a spicy citrus rind element from the Willamette and Hallertau hops leading the flavor. The body is quite thin and the barley character is too light. I don't want to call a decent beer like this watery, but something seems missing. Still, there's a decent hoppy finish which is dry but only a little bitter. I'd say this a good crowd-pleaser in that its got clean, distinct hops for beer geeks and a light, easy character for the BMC crowd. Worth a try on a hot day."

"Another very enjoyable blonde ale - I'm sensing a trend, or even a conspiracy, to dissuade me of my apathy for the style. Nice, fruity, and yet balanced, with crazy local perceived flavours. Oh, and look - the final leg of the Amazing race is in Honolulu, even stopping down the street. Apophenia is in the air again."
"On tap at the hotel bar while on vacation in Hawaii, served in pint glass the beer arrives crystal clear with a straw color, 1 finger cream colored head, with good retention and pleasant lacing. The nose is a little faint is pleasant and approachable with a sweet biscuit malt character along with a blend of grassy and citrus hop. The flavor follows suit but is fuller in character. Starts with a gentle biscuit malt base from which a more pronounced citrus, tropical fruit character develops. Mild bitterness. Finishes with a lingering fruit flavor on the tongue, orange. Lighter bodied with moderate carbonation the beer is crisp and clear. Easy to drink. Overall, very nice."
"A decent beer, boring in some places but I can see this being very refreshing on a summer day. Better beers out there but not a bad blonde."
""
"I had this a few times on Maui in lieu of the lager and found it a simple refreshing ale that hits the spot when it is warm or you are getting the grill going on the Lanai. The hops are there but this not the focus of this beer. I got bored after a couple in that I wanted more complexity but still worth drinking."
""
""
"Light bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer crisp, clean, and refreshing (sound familiar?). The body is light enough to make this both a warm spring night sipper as well as a hot summer day gulper. The carbonation is only slightly fizzy and really helps this beer's drinkability (especially during the swallow)."
"D - clean and drinkable, not bad for what it is but still not really worth drinking."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin cap. Thin broken foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grains and maybe some grassy/veggie aromas. A bit of a metallic aroma as well. Taste is of malt/grains, grass/veggies, and salt. Why is this beer salty at all? A mild bitterness after each sip. This beer has a pretty good carbonation but it is slightly thick feeling for some reason. Overall, this is not a very good beer. I am still curious as to why this is salty."
""

"This is easy to drink a ton of. It's totally unchallenging and mediocre and highly forgettable."
"Thin, it was refreshing for the situation, but it lacks flavors in a major way, so descriptions here are limited."
"This turned out to be a very plain malt dominant ale. A little watery in the feel and definitely not Kona's best offering, but for drinking in an open air bar somewhere in the islands it works pretty good."
"Narrative: Life was rough for the staggered Tetris block, Reggie. Sure, there were times when he would help out the project and ease construction in a limited fashion, but mostly he found himself cast aside, waiting for others to step in and help. “Don’t get down Reggie,” the slim solid 4 block Agapantha would console him, “we all, you know we all get sore sometimes, that’s just how Tetris goes, line eat line world.” Despite these consoling remarks, deep down Reggie knew he was unwanted. He could feel the disappointed glares when he would arrive next in line and announce his willingness. “Ah jeez, I don’t…I don’t know, just put him wherever, we will figure that one out…later I guess.” Reggie sighed a generic sigh and held his head up high, waiting for his day in the sun."
"Ontap, a hazed straw yellow with a soapy white froth and little in the way of lace. Aroma of yeast, citrus and a faint flowery hop. Well balanced brew with notes of lemon, hay, grains and a little earthy hop presence. Fairly refreshing and very easy to drink. Overall I could definately drink a few of these."
"Overall drinkability is good, with nothing aggressive or offensive."
"Good solid and drinkable golden ale. It lacks the fruityness of the top fermenting yeast and to me it tastes like a clean malty lager."
"Overall impression: Nicely constructed brew here. Easy recommendation."
"Not my favorite style (I bought it because the store didn't have anything more to my taste), and I think Kona's ""Fire Rock Pale Ale"" is better (more hoppy/fruity/full), but Big Wave is a decent beer, especially considering its style (most of the ""golden ales"" I've had have been much blander)."
"D: Very easy to drink. Very good representation of the style."
"D: Pretty solid for a Blonde Ale; I wouldn't want a lot of these, but they're good for a nice beach day in Maui."
"M/D - Light body despite the honey or maybe because of the honey. Easy to drink, pretty tasty. Obviously brewed to appease the non beeradvocate tourists who want a taste of the local brew, not a bad thing, not a bad beer."
"I could easily have knocked back a few more of these, thanks to the pleasant taste. Very nice complement to the stellar burgers served at Cheeseburger in Paradise."
"Drinkability: Easy-going and inoffensive. Actually got better toward the end of the bottle, but it was still forgettable. This is a good purchase for a summer barbecue or similar outdoor gathering."
"Nothing too out of the ordinary here. Typical blonde ale appearance, not much of a hop note on the nose. Good mouthfeel though, and definitely provided way more body than the usualy Am. adjunct lager. I don't have any complaints here though, if you are looking for a light tasting beer but still want some flavor and character, this would be a decent choice."
"Golden yellow color, light aroma, reasonably carbed, and overall generally seems like a BMC with a little extra flavor. Its fairly boring to be honest, but that's the style. Worth drinking if you're looking for something light and has a lot of flavor considering that its a blonde."
"I recommend trying this beer."
"12 ounce bottle, a buddy brought some island brews back for me on a recent trip to Hawaii. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a hazy light gold color with about a half inch white head which went away quickly. Lacing is average. The aroma is light, it smells like bready malt, honey, and a bit of fruit. The taste is exactly the same as the aroma, I can taste the bit of fruitiness in this beer but I can't figure out exactly what kind of fruit it is. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it seems a bit slick with decent carbonation. It's still light, but had more substance than I expected. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink at all. Not a bad brew, but it's not my favorite of the Kona beers I've tried."
"M/D - To me a light bodied brew, sweet malt taste with little malt aftertaste. Finished pretty smooth though, not bad from Kona, not my favorite from Kona but for sure it's worth trying. I could enjoy a couple in one sitting."
"D: again, not a bad beer, just very simple. on a hot day and in the absence of other options, I wouldn't cringe at having a Big Wave in front of me. I wouldn't seek it out though."
"D-Very drinkable, This is a beer that I could drink all night long"
"Drinkability is average. There's not much to this beer, but it's also wholly inoffensive. It didn't set my nethers tingling, but I didn't want to puke and die either."
"My favorite of the Kona Brewing Company beers. Delicious... I love it. Probably one of my favorite beers (small beers) of all small beers. Fantastic."
"Just not a good brew, and I never would have guessed that I was drinking an ale. Watery, not very drinkable."
"that's three strikes for kona. sorry to say. although i guess maybe i'll give them another chance, since american blonde ale is such a crap style anyway."
"Drinkability - Not sure. This almost had the feel of a wheat beer to me. A lot of flavors going one coupled with mild hop presence may make this a favorate with the malty ""lawnmower beer"" crowd."
"The first of the several beers I tried while in Maui. Pours a hazy golden color with very little head. Sweet fruity tasting with a touch of bitter hops. Not overly flavorful but there's enough there to be a refreshing brew. I did however feel it was a little too sweet and could have used more hop flavor. Still pretty good in that Hawaiian sun, but what isn't?"
"This is the one beer that Kona bottles and does not send over to California, so that explains why I had never seen it, not bad for three dollars during happy hour at the Moose, that place reminded me of the old one in Redondo Beach, would drink again, recommended"
"Didn't think Hawaii would have good beer, but they do, and this stuff is made to take you through long lazy days fucking around at the beach. This one poured a golden orange. Smelled a bit of orange peel and malts. Light bodied and drinkable yet had some tastiness so didn't become boring. Tasted of malts and maybe some slight fruitiness and hops coming through and finished smooth and satisfying."
"Good for a hot day. If you are in Hawaii and just want a local brew go for the Fire Rock Pale Ale first."
"On tap. Nice aroma. Appearance is a golden color covered by a White creamy head with great lacing, very nice for a Hawaiian brew. Aroma is nice and flavor is refreshing but watery and thin body. Great way to start off my Hawaiian [Beer] Trip. Aloha!!"
"Light body, with ample carbonation. Not a whole lot here, but oddly enough, I found this to be rather refreshing, (maybe it was the dozen balls I lost on the course). Not very exciting, but decent."
"The taste of all the above just kept coming back. I really like this Golden Ale from Kona Brewing. I've had it in bottle and now in draft and I'll tell you that their is a difference in flavor and aroma between the two. I would rate the draft Golden Ale far above the bottle."
"Got this from my sister-in-law who went on her honey-moon in Hawaii. Never would have been able to try this beer in WI so I finally opened it. Poured into a pint glass this was a light golden color. Not much of a head at all and no lacing. This beer has a very sweet smell and a little citrus. Upon tasting this beer had a very thin and almost watery taste. Not much to it at all. I suppose with intense heat on the beach it may be a nice change from the mass produced Mexican beers, but here in WI it doesn't have much appeal. I am glad I got to try it, but I am not too impressed. Maybe if I make it to the big island I will give it another shot?!"
"D= very drinkable if you like the first one."
"Not bad, but not great. Still, a nice refreshing beverage on a hot day in the Pacific."
"D: This would be a good summer brew or during any hot time of the month, since the whole global warming thing is upon us. I could drink a pitcher of this."
"Pours a dense golden apricot color with a one-finger head that thins out quickly, leaving a nice looking film over the whole beer. The aroma is muted but malty. Not much hop character here. Maybe some pear, but not much fruit either. Tastes much the same. Muted and malty with a strong yeasty flavor too. Malty sweetness up front with a mellow, smooth finish. Not an overwhelming beer here, and not one I'll actively seek out when on the west coast in the future. But a good enough session beer that I would not turn my nose up at it either. Aloha."
"flavor is delicate, bordering on watery. light feel with a medium carbonation, but has a nice gentle sweetness. gentle honey maltiness, with a fairly clean finish. very drinkable, but could use a bit more heft to the flavor."
"Had on tap at the brewpub on Oahu. I wasn't really all that impressed, maybe I shouldn't have had it at the same dinner where I tried some of their other, more fine, offerings. The blond ale looked like a pilsner, smelled a little malty, and tasted kind of bitter. Not my favorite."
"A co-worker brought this back for me from Hawaii. An all right beer that would probably go down better in the summer months. A nice pour. The clean, white head was about two fingers thick. It sunk to a thin cap leaving lacing with each drink. Body is a hazy, straw color with a touch of orange. Sweet malty smell is very light with a whiff of citrus. Light to medium body with a sweet taste from the malt and light hops in the finish. Not too bad of a beer overall. Might have been better if I had it sooner - bottled on date is Feb."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer [not much to offend]. Decent, but nothing I'd go out of my way to have again."
"Fruity with hints of pear and apples. Snappy moderate hop finish. The mouthfeel is smooth with a nice body. A rather nice and enjoyable blonde ale with a pleasing drinkability level."
"Pours a light golden color with a light head of medium bubbles. Fruity aroma, covers the hops almost completely. Clean, crisp flavor of fruit, light malty sweetness, and slight citrus. Medium body. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste. A good all around brew to drink on a hot day, but can be just a bit on the heavy side. Similar to the Keoki Gold, although its an ale instead of a lager."
"Bought this in Maui on my first anniversary of my marriage. Kona brewing is pretty much the only craft beer that is found in the Ka'anapalli/Lahaina area of Maui. The color is a nice golden body with a light airy head on it. The aroma has a nice fresh grainy kick to it with a mild hop standout. The taste is clean and refreshing with a heavier taste than I expected. Not a world-class beer, but a nice little beer to add to my collection."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer in terms of quantity, but not enough flavor to make it interesting."
