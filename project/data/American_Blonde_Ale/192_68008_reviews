"O: Very light, very refreshing. Love the art on the label, great bottle from New Belgium as always, great name that suits the brew. Good refreshing summer beer. Got it in NC, drinking it in China."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, floral, some citrus. Taste is citrus, malts, a bit sweet, very easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"Taste is soft light sweetness with light herbal grassy bitterness, stronger at finish, peaches & hay up front, long grain-cracker-peach finish with hint of mineral water."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is easily drinking but with a bit of an exaggerated coriander and lemony feel that I just didnt dig all that much. For a summertime offering, yeah I could see throwing a few of these back without much effort. But it isn't something I would pick if I was given options."

"D - Not bad for what it is, though it is an odd one. The tartness is refreshing but the apricot flavor isn't to my liking."
"Overall: this is certainly drinkable and different in good ways. Wouldnt say I love it but can appreciate is appeal."

"Perfect keep your edge stuff for disc golf, barbecues, tailgates etc. . ."
"O: i prefer more complex brews that have a bigger body. i was given this by a family member so I am very grateful to have tried it. It would be a nice brew for anyone first starting out in the micro/craft brew world. It provides a nice touch of simplicity, yet at the same time adds a few characters to help the palate grow."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice lacing over a golden body with the a tiny tiny bit of haze. The look of it is great. Nice lemony grassy taste and smell. This is a very refreshing summer ale. I'm having it in the wet fall right now, and its still almost perfect, but in the hot sun this one would be spot on."
""

"O-A boring, bland beer. This did nothing for me. I could drink it again but I have no reason to"

"Pours a slightly darker golden color. Nose is of hops, lemon and a bit of a floral vibe overall. Taste follows with a touch of other fruit like apricot. As a summer beer, I think this one lacks the crispness and refreshing qualities that I personally desire. It's a little busier than most of my sumemr favorites, but given the more pedestrian nature of New Belgium's line (Fat Tire, Ranger, etc), I do appreciate the uniqueness here."

"O: An excellent, highly drinkable summer beer. Clean, light and refreshing."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall- Was impressed with this not being a big New Belgium guy. Very good summer beer. Not as good as some of the pale wheat ales but it holds it's own for summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - A nice summer blonde ale. Lot's of different fruity notes than the typical citrus, and really easy drinking."
""
"This is a pretty decent beer.... Not close to the best beer out of the New Belgium Brewery, but certainly in the upper half of what I've had from this Fort Collins brewery.... It definately tastes better out of the tap.... It has a ""not too hoppy"" taste, but quite enjoyable.... It's almost as if there's more citrus notes than it being a super hoppy beer.... I prefer it over Shift, 1554, and would place it right around Fat Tire as far as quality of taste, though they are completely different tastes."
""
""
"O - Exceptional! I will and have bought this frequently. Love this beer."

"Picked this up from the grocery store, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it is! Appearance and mouthfeel are average, but the smell and taste were very flavorful. Lots of fruit (without being sweet), spice, yeast, and lemon make this a refreshing summer beer. I'd have this one again and again."
""
"Pours golden with a really nice white head that clings to the glass. Aroma is very malty with a hint of citrus. Wow, flavor is not what I expected at all: again malty, but like a whole grain cracker with no sweetness. The hops make their presence known with a lime note in the finish. While this is an ale, it reminds me more of a pilsner and is equally drinkable on this hot Texas afternoon. I wish I had a sixer of this. Very, very easy to drink. Definitely one for those lawn chair days."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very drinkable, an interesting balance of citrus and bitterness that pushes the malt bill to the background. It has excellent lacing. Could easily put away 2 or 3 on a lazy afternoon. <4.5>"

"Pours a clear, golden yellow with a white head. A nice bright, smooth aroma' a little grainy with big and kinda sweet and juicy lemon aroma. Flavor followed suit. A nice medium bodied and active mouthfeel. Overall, I was really surprised by this and quite enjoyed it. A very nice summer beer."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable & easygoing."
""
""
"O- Decently drinkable for a summer ale but overall very underwhelming."
"Overall: A very pleasant surprise to find in the grocery store. Great belgian style blonde ale. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with mild zesty carbonation that's refreshing and easy to drink with a medium/light body. A summer beer with flavor that goes down easy and was perfect on a hot summer night. Well done, another winner by New Belgium."
""
"D: A successful summer seasonal. Light and fruity fresh. Easy summer drinking."

"This was pretty good. It definitely had a crisp and quaffable nature to it but didn’t get over sharp or aggressive feeling either. Between this and the Dig Pale Ale, I think New Belgium has two of the better warm weather beers that I’ve had lately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great easy drinking summer beer that has a fairly big flavor. New Belgium came into my area about a year ago and I have been looking for a regular beer that lives up to the bar that the ""Lips of Faith"" beers set and this one does. Can't wait to have more."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't necessarily the most flavorful beer I've had recently, but I found this extremely thirst-quenching. Very nicely balanced, and very drinkable. Seems like a solid summer seasonal to me."
"Can I have another?"
"Overall, this is a really nice summer beer. I have enjoyed many beers by New Belgium in the past, but I haven't drank too many of their seasonals. This is a summer beer that I will look forward to drinking again."
""
"O - A great summer beer from New Belgium, the playful fruit and spice complexities of Somersault give it distinctive flavor with a clean, soft finish for an all-around refreshing and enjoyable treat!"
""
""
"Overall, liked it for the first 6 ounces. Then the more I drank of the six pack, the worse it became. Another average New Belgium beer. Good enough to drink the entire sixe, but not good enough to buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like it and would consider it a good choice for a beer to bring to a BBQ or other outside, hot event where you want something thirst-quenching but also flavorful. However, it doesn’t blow me away to the point of wanting to buy a second six-pack, but I’d certainly be tempted to pick on up again next year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this brew is great for hanging out on the patio during the summer. Very drinkable, and full of flavor. Drink it and enjoy!"
"Drinkability is awesome on this beer. A great balance of all things needed. The perfect summer seasonal beer. A beer could not be matched any better to a season."
""
""
"Overall - Impressive summer seasonal from New Belgium. Complex, clean and crisp. Entirely drinkable, and session friendly. One of the better summer releases out there. Bud Light Lime, eat your heart out."
""
""
"Thanks Bry."
""
"Yummy."
""
""
""
"O: A more grownup shandy, though that’s not what the style classification designates. A lawnmower beer, for sure, and a good one at that."
""
"O: Good mellow beer…VERY refreshing!...Chasin’ Cheers :~)"
"Very interesting beer! I’ve had it from the bottle and on tap. Pours a golden color, edging towards amber with 1 finger of pearly head with abundant lacing. The smell is distinctly hemp to me, very grassy and resiny. The flavor is full of grassy and flowery hops with an almost honey flavor. Very complex and almost seems to change from sip to sip. Palate is almost syrupy from the flavors, but not in a bad way. Overall a tasty little beer with lots of complexity."
"O: Almost perfection, I think a bit thick on the oats, would like a bit better hop presence, but close...oh so close."
"Definitely a good warm weather beer. Easy drinking, with subtle, pleasant flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was very good with a memorable fruity profile. Well worth seeking out during the hot months of summer."
""
""
""
"Overall - An outstanding summer brew, I would highly recommend this to anyone. This could be a good brew to convert some of your AAL friends with, at least introduce them to some new styles! I will absolutely buy and drink this again. Everything about this brew says summertime, and I love summertime!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Personally, I can’t quite see how Ba (Jason) scored this at 100. Granted, the clarity and palate definition is impressive. But I would consider this another summer-type ale. High drinkability with the usual lemon component and a watery finish. Nothing special here."
""
""
""
"Overall impression: Loved it! Really enjoyed that this wasn't just a boring, crackery, typical American blonde ale. I loved the light hop character in the aroma, flavor, and bitterness. It provided a nice counterpoint without killing the palate. Well done and great for the summer!"
""
""
""
""
"Would be wonderful with a mild cheese plate (think brie) and a crisp dinner salad with chilled shrimp."
""
""
"Beer is light in body, a little bitter on the end, an interesting yeastiness to the beer, easy drinking, light, wet, not dry. Very nice. I may have it again."
""
""
"O - First off, I suppose its better than alot of the mostly crap summer offerings, but this NB is just not for me. I have been enjoying some high quality stouts and IPA/IIPA lately so maybe I am spoiled. This beer just furthers my belief that this time of year is the doldrums for beer. The search continues...."
""
""
""
"Picked up a six-pack while in OBX, seemed like a good beach beer. It was. Instead of the clean, bland blond ales you usually meet in the summer, this had a lovely mix of mild citrus hops and grapefruit sourness (not bitterness) that adds an extra-refreshing edge. The aroma has a mix of freshly toasted bread/malt and light apricot fruit. Overall, a great take on the style. I'm glad to see brewers finally figuring out how to make a fun and satisfying blond ale."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Average carbonation. Somewhat grainy but retains drinkability flavors are well balanced. Dry finish. Quite a flavorful beer for the style and a pretty damn good summer beer."
"Overall this is an exceptional summer ale. You can tell the main focus here is drinkability, while still maintaining a layered and flavorful brew. They succeeded, but fell short in a couple areas. The nose is a bit weak, and I think they could have brought the overall flavor up a notch and still maintained the level of drinkability. Recommended to anyone looking for a really good summer ale. Cheers!"
"C-"
""
""
"O: great summer beer, would purchase a 12 pack of this easily."
""
""
"O: Great summer brew!"
"Will definitely enjoy again this summer!"
"Excellent beer, surprised it took me so long to try this one."
""
"It's interesting because it's different but it's almost too much like cider and not so much like beer. I wouldn't buy another one because it's too sweet and weird."
"O - not bad for a summer ale; light, but fairly complex"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very refreshing and drinkable. Nice dry finish. Perfect summer beer. Nice lingering sweet citrus flavors. Would get again for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out to a frothy white head, excellent lacing, golden color, clear. Aroma is a nice blend of fruitiness, spicy hops and soft grain. Flavors are light but interesting and complex with apricot, and a hint of ""fat tire"" biscuityness. Mouthfeel is light and the CO2 is generous. Overall, this beer takes the concept of a blonde ale in some interesting directions. I don't know if they actually put apricots in it, or what the purpose of the oats were, but it works."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Lots of citrus upfront, mainly lemon with some crackery malt, peppery hops and a touch of tropical fruit. Apricot very present as well. Super easy to drink without sacrificing depth of flavor. Really impressed. Maybe the best summer beer I've come across."
""
"Oveall - There is a new summer beer champion and its name is New Belguim Somersault."
"Medium bodied, displaying a nice range of flavors from malts, fruits and a light touch of hops. The malt is very lightly toasted, not getting in the way of the apricot and lemon freshness. There's a slight tartness from these fruits, just enough to be pleasantly summery without making you pucker. The hops in the back are citrusy and a touch floral, giving a quick bitterness that is packed full of citrusy flavor and adding to a dryness to a juicy finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, almost slick and goes down incredibly easily. This would be a fantastic beer to sit down and enjoy a few of on a hot summer afternoon. Chock full of more flavor than your average summer beer, this one is definitely worth a buy."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: sweet, almost a fruit beer it has so much berry and lemon in it; the aftertaste drops into seltzer-water territory, which isn't my palate's preferred destination, so I dock points for that; otherwise, a good choice for a hot-weather beer."
""
""
""
"O- I look forward to summer seasonals. This one is an easy drinker after mowing the yard on those hot summer days."
"O=I am not overly familiar with the style, but felt that this was worth trying...will only try again if nothing else intriguing on the menu."
"Overall impression: This beer doesn't fit into my normal scheme of brews. The sweet and sour nature is like yen and yang going at it. I like sweet beers and I like sour IPA's.. But the contrast is balanced and is interesting. I think this beer would be nice in a breakfast situation or with grilled fish."
""
""
""
"Palate is a litle oily, but refreshing and vibrant."
""
""
""
""
""
"has the same high brownish/dark yellow hue of many IPA's when poured from a 12oz. bottle. Had the same distinctive fruit and hop smells of a classic IPA. Even tasted something like a mild IPA upon first taste. However, finished with the sweet malt notes of a lager. Imagine if Sam Adams Boston Lager had slightly more pronounced hop notes and toned down its big malt finish a bit. Very interesting and VERY good beer."
"Overall not a bad brew. It definately fits perfectly with the seasonal category as its offered. Ill probably drink this again with some grilled chicken at the lake."
""
""
""
"Overall, sigh, not doing it for me, not having another one of these that's for sure, but it could be worse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall another great brew from New Belgium that's worth your time. I certainly won't fault the high rating the bros gave to this one."
""
"I suppose this is a matter of preference, whether you like the sharp and tart flavor. It doesn't relate very well to the Blonde category. More like a malt-free Wit with an overdose of citrus. From the 12 oz bottle. ""Best before"" 19 Aug 2012."
""
""
""
""
"O- This a great blond from NB. It's a great summer beer and I look forward to drinking this on a nice hot summer day."
""
""
"I'm not a big blonde ale fan, this has more flavor than many, but that flavor is an artificial-tasting lemon. Not offensive, but not really what I am looking for in a beer."
"Overall: a great sipping beer for a warm, summer day"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely love Somersault from New Belgium, one of my favorite Blonde Ales and summer seasonal. The taste is fantastic, a nice blend of citrus and smooth finish. I highly recommend this beer to anyone for a summer beer, very easy to relax and enjoy a nice summer's day with."
""
"Not the worst beer of its kind, but horribly unbalanced. Why can't they make more beers like Dig, which are thick, juicy, and with a moderate hop explosion? This works aroma-wise but the drinking experience on its own is not my favorite. Works well with a meal due to its lightness, but it's definitely a blonde ale that was trying to be something else. Whatever it was, I've no clue."
""
"Pale yellow with a fluffy three-finger head and lots of lacing. Smell is grainy and not great, but the taste is nice--toasted grain, tart citrus hop, a little bit of apricot. Faint sourness in the aftertaste which makes it not as easy of a drinker as I would like. Would probably drink again in the summer."
""
""
""
"If I was to rank it from 0-100 I'd give it an 89."
""
""
"not a great seasonal from new belgium. pours a very watery looking pale yellow color, clear as can be, with a small white fizzy head. smells like czech malts and lemon extract of some kind. flavor is very lemony, but not in a fresh lemons way at all. a light biscuity malt flavor comes in there too, right before the metallic brassy tart aftertaste comes in. pretty gross at the end actually. feel is too light, even for a summer beer, there is just no body here at all. medium carbonation is fine, but this beer isnt happening from the get go. it is sad to see the spring seasonal dig be replace by this one. dig was pro, this one is weak street."

"Light creamy head with a bit of citrus and hops on the nose. Pale straw yellow color and clean appearance with steady flow of rising bubbles. Tight, sharp carbonation makes for great feel, also not to thin. Taste the same as the smell, slight hops with a citrus finish. A fairly drinkable beer, I'm sure I'll have it again."

"12 ounce bottle, best by 08/28/2011. I think this will be my first blonde ale. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2-3 fingers of fairly dense white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a decent sized lacing cap that lasts. A nice amount of lacing clings around the glass as well. Aromas of big lemon, pepper, biscuit, grass, spiciness, and other light fruitiness. Some very nice aromas here with good strength as well. Taste of lemon, pepper, spices, bread, citrus, grass, and a bit of tart graininess. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, bread, and spices that last for a bit on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moutfeel that is a bit on the watery side, but not in a bad way. Drinks really easily as I would have expected for a beer brewed for the summer months. No alcohol presence at all as expected. Overall, some seriously great stuff here. Nice amount of well balanced flavors and super smooth drinking."

"This is a well crafted beer, nice job New Belgium."
"Overall a decent blonde, but almost totally unremarkable."
"Tried the Summersault at a school soiree held by some friends of ours. The beer pours light copper in color and mostly transparent. The fairly thin, white head that recedes pretty quickly but leaves some nice strings of lace in its path. The smell includes spicy and fresh hoppy aroma. The taste has a mellow malt backbone belgium style. Fresh and lively hop flavor, mostly pine and ginger spice notes. Dry and refreshing flavor. The mouthfeel is lighter in body and well carbonated. Smooth even texture with a dry, crisp finish. Overall this would be an excellent summer seasonal. Highly refreshing. Bright, fresh flavors and very drinkable."
"O: This is quite good, though I'm disappointed I'm drinking my first at the end of October rather than the end of summer, as it would make a great summer drink. Perhaps a bit more acidity than I prefer on its own, but I will try pairing the next with food."
"O: a refreshing and interesting take on a Summer sipping beer. There is plenty here to like."
"o: great summer beer that was enjoyed by all who took part in helping me drink this six pack."
"Golden with a slight haze. Slightly off white head. Smells fantastic w/ a mild citrus hop. Taste is all citrus (Grapefruit and Apricot as promised on the bottle). Still quite fresh considering it's already October and this is their summer offering. I will be looking for this next summer."
"D - A very drinkable beer. A perfect gateway beer for the non-craft drinker. I will certainly recommend this one, and look forward to next summer to have another."
"Pours a straw yellow gold with exuberant white head that retains fairly well. Fairly strong lemon effervescence here, ginger, subdued floral hop pine aromas, biscuity malt character hides behind the fruit aromas. Lemon and citrus orange flavors up front, biscuit malt, crisp clean dry finish, very light, very refreshing in the summer."
"Pours clear yellowish cloudy with 1/4 inch of white foam. Wheaty malt smell. Smooth taste, full of lemon with low carbonation. Strong lemon, very citrussy. Some oats at the finish round out the flavor. Very drinkable, good taste, likable."
"Ov- Excellent summer session beer."
"O: This is quite flavorful and easy to drink."
"O-It's a summer blonde ale. Take that into consideration. Great for non craft drinkers"
"This pours a light golden color with a large frofty head which pretty good retention and come lacing. The smell is light and crisp, a little citrus, a little floral, some apricot. Feel is medium to light. Overall a clean light taste but with a little hop bite and some lemon. I got to say this is pretty good compared to most summer beers I've had this year, wish I would have tried it earlier."
"M: Bordering on light to medium bodied. Mouth feel is velvety, coating my mouth and cheeks. Carbonation does a great job cleansing and moving the flavors along, as well as resetting my taste buds. At 5.2% ABV, I don't get any alcohol presence."
"Pours a very clear, golden, amber color with a rocky white head. The aroma is a burst of citrus with hints of lemon, orange, grapefruit and ginger. It tastes of ginger, lemon and orange with a bready aftertaste. The beer is light and full of soft carbonation, it also has a nice lingering finish. This beer is very refreshing and thirst quenching, a very nice summer beer."
"This is blonde ale with a bright golden look to it. A very nice smell to this beer. Very well balance and of course perfect for the summer. Hints why it is New Belgium's summer season. I have to say I am very impressive with this beer. I have to say this is the first beer from this brewery I would drink on a day to day bases. A nice finish to this beer. I really love the after taste of this beer. Find it before the summer ends. Cheers!"
"Overall- I wanted to like this. I like blondes. It looked good. And while I went into it thinking that I should be comparing to session beers, not actual blondes, I still found myself bored and uninterested."
"D- Very refreshing summer beer. I'd recommend picking up a few of these. Typical sweetness to New Belgium beer."
"O) Not what I expected but still an average brew."
"Overall - Not my favorite style, but this is an Excellent representative of this style. Really nice balance and combination of flavors, and lite enough to be very refreshing, and lower ABV makes this a great session beer, and a great thirst quencher for the warmer months."
"Overall Drinkability - The mouthfeel really puts a damper on this beer. Makes it feel lifeless. Might make a decent session beer for newbies or as a gateway IPA/ESB. Meh."
"Nose is grassy and grainy with a slight mustiness and a gentle fruit presence. A wave of juicy sweet apricot and apple flavors up front, but a touch of tangy lemon keeps the sweetness in check. There’s a light earthy hop presence that lends a nice depth. Very lively feel to this stuff, tingly carbonation with a light toasty malt profile and a very clean, crisp finish. Regardless of style, this is a pretty damned refreshing brew (it was the perfect lawnmower beer on this day). As a blonde ale? Top notch."
"O - Fantastic ale. Great for if you want substantive flavor without the high ABV of an IPA. Hard to categorize and/or compare head to head with other beers I've tasted, and I like that about it."
"O: A very refreshing and satisfying beer on the lighter side of the spectrum. Clean, clean, and direct in its intentions to enliven your summer days. I enjoyed this one more and more with continued sips."
"Overall: A strong beer. Its probably one of my favorites from New Belgium. It amazes me how consistent this brewery is. I drank this beer whenever it was overwhelmingly hot outside. I have got to say that it filled the void well. While all of my lame friends were sitting around wasting their lives on lesser beer, this definitely gave me drinkable refreshment without compromising a complex flavor. One of the better ABA I've had. Wouldn't expect anything less from New Belgium."
"A very well crafted blonde ale. Fantastic summer beer for when the heat index is 106, like it is here today."
"This is an excellent summer seasonal. Highly refreshing. Bright, fresh flavors and very drinkable."
"O: A nice summer beer that has a bit of complexity..."
"Said it before, I'll say it again - blonde ales just don't do it for me. That, mes amis, is why this one is special - west coast allusions in the hop register, to go with a solid, if stoic, malt base. While not exactly encouraging me to act out ass-over-teakettle notions, it's still a decent summer quaff."
"O - a pleasant surprise. Although Somersault has a different flavor profile, there's enough similarity for me to highly recommend this to fans of Magic Hat #9. This one is probably best-of-style for me so far and one I anticipate seeking out in the future."
"Drink- As I mentioned, this was much better cold but still a tasty little beer. Unique on the balance between blonde and IPA or APA. Probably wont have this one again."
"I'm not normally real big on blonde (ales), nor lighter afternoon beers in general, but NB really did themselves proud on this one. Absolutely pick up some somersault if you get the opportunity. It's great on a sunny afternoon, but would be good otherwise as well. Even if you tend to prefer darker fuller brews (as I do), this is a well crafted and refreshing dalliance well worth your time and money. Well played New Belgium, well played..."
"I really like that not one component of this beer plays the dominant role here. The fruit / spice add subtlely to the complexity and flavor of this beer without overwhelming it. I wouldn’t guess there were any additions to this beer necessarily, and that is a good sign when adding extra ingredients in a light, summer quaffer. I am definitely enjoying this beer; light, refreshing, malty, fruity, spicy and even a touch hoppy, this beer is quite complex and I am quite happy to be having a sixer of this. I have a feeling this beer is going to be completely overlooked by the beer-geek set, but I am quite pleased with it."
"Overall: Easy to drink beer, and easy to dismiss as nothing special – admit tingly I did the first time I tried it. But as a light summer beer its got a really beauty to it. I’m glad I gave this one a second chance."
"D-Very drinkable. It is on par with other summer brews."
"Somersault pours a little bit darker than blonde, it's a step or two towards tangerine, and crystal clear. The white foam that crowns the beer hits three fingers in height, and displays above average head retention. The sides of the glass are left heavily coated in lacing. The nose has a light grainy sweetness, with a definite touch of apricot. The combination of grapefruit from the Centennial hops and a little bit of ginger forms an interesting counterpoint in the aroma. The flavor is more of the same, with a gentle, rolling bitterness serving as a transition between the sweet flavors and the hops and ginger mid palate. I'm pleasantly surprised at how nice and mild the grapefruit presence is, I haven't been a huge fan of beers that use predominantly Centennial in the past. The mouthfeel is nice, relatively light bodied for a summer ale and paired with a carbonation that does more than just cut through the beer, but stops short of the bubbly activity of, say, a well brewed Belgian. Somersault is a solidly put together beer, and one I could drink a lot of while hanging out with friends on a hot summer day."
"Overall this is a solid beer. Very refreshing and smooth. Could enjoy this all night long on a summer night."
"This is one of the best beers to drink on a hot day when your mouth is dry. Once you pop it open, you just can't stop drinking it. Easily sessionable, especially at 5.2%. Perfect summer brew. Gets high marks for a great tasting and supremely balanced beer."
"O: A good refreshing summer beer."
"This beer goes down very easy and is a perfect choice for a sunny day outside. Whether you are on the back deck, mowing the yard, or off to the beach, this beer is sure to satisfy."
"Somersault is no Hoptoberfest, but it has a lot to recommend it over Summer beers of the same price point. Give it a whirl and see what it does for you."
"Overall this is a great Summer blonde that will make most anyone happy they didn't pass it up. Additionally, it's a fairly low calorie beer which is an added bonus. I wish I had bought more of it."
"D: Good session beer."
"Great thick head that lasts a good long time. The color was a deep amber. So far so good. Not much in the aroma department. The flavor comes on with a bit of bitter, then fades through some subtle fruit hints. I am a big New Belgium fan, but the Somersault did not have me doing somersaults."
"I'm reviewing this to style. As a Blonde I think it's very good. It's not my favorite style but this is great summer drinking. Refreshing without being too filling."
"Overall, while not bad, I just couldn't get into this one. Not much aroma or flavor so it doesn't stand out at all. If I want an easy drinking NBB, I'd rather grab a Mothership Wit. Avail here in TX. One is enough for me [N;N]"
"First time I've had this beer it reminds me of Sunshine Wheat in that it was missing something...A orange or lemon slice and sad to say I didn't have either but I am happy to say a slice of grape fruit made this beer just right. If you get this beer I think a lemon slice would make it much better."
"Overall: A great summer beer."
"Pours a golden yellow with carbonation floating to meet the soft head. The nose offers up grains and fruit. Taste is sweet, fruit, and a hint of citrus; overall very good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and heavily carbonated. Another solid beer from NB."
"I generally don't have much love for New Belgium, and wouldn't have even tried Somersault if it weren't for a mom that is learning to embrace craft beer. I'm not blown out of the water, but this light pale ale was kept tasteful while including some fruit and spices."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a finger of white head that dissipates rapidly but does leave some lacing. The aroma is weak but has some fruity hop notes as well as some maltiness. The flavor starts with sweet malt and then becomes floral and finishes with a slighty spiciness. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and finishes clean. Overall a decent summer ale."
"Works well as a thrist quencher, as a sipper like at a BBQ I think it won't work."
"On tap at the Clips of Faith event in Santa Cruz. 3 ounce sample pours clear gold with a small white froth. Aroma is unripe apricots and honey malts with a floral tinge. Flavor is wheaty banana, tart apricots, floral hops, with a watery finish. Flavorful but the apricot thing gets old and the finish is too short."
"Edit: had another couple bottles a few days later.. got a bit of a tart/sourness in the flavor.. its just slight though.. added a nice touch.."
"Overall, I found this to be OK. New Belgium has done better work, but this beer is good at being a summer quencher."
"O: A decent enough light, summer beer. However, not really that great of a beer."
"A pleasant summer ale at a moderate ABV. I wish that the yeast flavor weren't so present in the finish and aftertaste, however, as it seems to take out some of the refreshing aspect."
"Overall: A very good summer brew. One of the more complex ones I've had."
"Overall, this is a well-rounded, highly sessionable summer beer."
"Tried the Somersault after having a Mothership Wit. Although it was completely different from the MW, it was a very nice improvement. The first sip had a nickel taste, but got batter after awhile. As I was finishing the beer, however, it became more of a blah taste. That could be it getting a bit warm, but it felt like it “faded out.”"
"Flavor relies on being smooth and light, but there's actually a decent hop kick here. Fruit component is mellower than the nose, which is welcome. Body is light, clean, and very drinkable. Interesting, slightly outside the box but pleasant."
"I had this one on tap this afternoon up at the brewery. Poured a clear golden color with a small lingering white head. Aromas of lime zest, wheat and yeast. On the palate, this one was fairly light bodied and very refreshing, with a flavors of wheat and light citrus."
"Mouthfeel is light, a little slick and sticky, overall, pretty good for the style."
"I really liked it. I found it refreshing and very tasty. I was apprehensive about trying it because I didn't like some of the other beers from New Belgium but I really enjoyed this. Perfect for a hot summer night. Good fruity taste that is very smooth."
"O: I have had almost a case of this beer now. I was really impressed with the beer when I first had it. I was staying in the desert and working outside all day. It was fantastically refreshing and flavorful in the heat. Now that I am in cooler weather in San Diego, I do not enjoy the beer as much. Still it is very well done, and is a good beer for initiating those who think they don’t like craft beer."
"This was a great hot weather beer. Sweet enough to give it flavor, but dry and crisp to make it refreshing."
"Goes down real easy, it's hard not to want to gulp this. A real thirst quencher. Tastes more like a lager than an ale except for the wheat and citrus notes. Sessionable without a doubt. Could drain a case of this on a hot summer day. All praise aside, it's not groundbreaking. But certainly worth trying."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of wheat with some grass from the hops. The flavor is more of the same with a little bit of citrus notes mixed in. Still, the dominant flavor is wheat with not too much else exciting going on. Easy to drink and I think this would go nicely on a hop summer day. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall I'd pass on this one again. Not a drainpour, but not sometime I'd actively seek out."
"Overall: A good, refreshing summertime option and more enjoyable than the, oh, what was it, Skinny Dip, that's it - better than that one. The apricot is very light, not nearly as distinct as in Magic Hat's #9."
"Overall: A crisp, refreshing, fairly flavorful Blonde Ale, and as a summer seasonal, it is light years better than the old Skinny Dip. While the apricot and ginger additions are minimal, that may be a good thing, as it just provides balance and subtle complexity. Love the exclusive use of Centennial hops!"
"Since I am not a hophead, I can't put this in my top ten. But, I certainly can appreciate it."
"Overall, a very good blonde, and I can easily say it is one of the best for the style."
"Appearance is a golden yellow with a thin but steady head and spotty lace. Smell of the light apricot blending with the malt and hops. Taste has that light sweet apricot note with a light blend of hops that make it go down easy, but leaves a twang in the end. mouthfeel is light with good body and carbonation. Not bad, I like the initial flavor but not the cloying twang in the end."
"O: I prefer citrus to stonefruit flavors, so I'd rather drink the Skinny Dip, but since New Belgium is rotating their seasonals now, this is the current option. Not sure I'll be buying more of this or not this summer, and will likely try other seasonals before returning to this one."
"Poured a light yellow with an average sized frothy white head that was mostly lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was very mild of a grain malt and a moderate dose of floral hops with a hint of citrus (lemon), apricot and spices. It tasted very lightly sweet with notes of citrus and fruit at first then became a tad sour with a mild hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery yet a little dry in texture with a very soft carbonation. Overall basically a lager with a little more of a hoppy flavor, very little."
"Really nice and very drinkable."
"The body is light but not watery. The carbonation is ample and adds a little bit of fizz before a slightly dry finish. This one is neither here nor there, which I think was the plan. Easy to drink, no problems, no frills."
"The color when poured was a golden yellow with medium foam and medium amount of lace. The smell of hops, citrus and a hint of apricot was evident and had a pleasant aroma. The taste had a fair amount of citrus flavor, with hops, peach and apricot. Also a fair amount of acidic citrus feel on the palate. All in all, a nice pleasant flavor and nicely balance of sweet/acidic/fruity flavor."
"O - It took me a couple of sips to like it, but now I can't stop drinking it. This beer can be quite assertive when you first try it, but believe me, it only gets better. Great summer beer. It could make a great pairing for an Asian salad or a Rosemary lemon chicken. Probably very good with Thai food as well."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a decent fluffy head and a bit of lacing. Citrusy hops on the nose, cereal and a touch of apricot. Biscuity grain on the palate with a decent hop background and a bit of apricot, though not sweet. Also it has that dry biscuit finish that I associate with a lot of New Belgium beers and I assume might be from the particular strain of yeast that they use. Decent summer beer and one I like more than some of their other offerings."
"O - overall, a well balanced, tasty, and even a bit unique beer. A really good outdoor summer type beer, which is exactly what they're going for here I suppose. Aroma was a little wanting."
"Bright yellow-gold with a big, creamy white head that sticks around as a milky covering until the bottom of the glass. Leafy centennial aromatics - peppery citrus, light fruit, and flowery hops over some pale malt. Juicy citrus and apricot flavor. Very refreshing. Floral, slightly oily, green hops and lemon zest. Light bodied and easily drinkable. The fruitiness can wear on the palate after a couple, but not a bad summer seasonal."
"Pours from bottle into cold chilled glass, golden colored clear, no haze moderate head that dissipates quickly. Light citrus flavor with light hoppy notes. Smell is quite floral but not overwhelming. A very solid summertime beer and a very good seasonal for hot summer days."
"Very nice notes of citrus and grains. I had a bit of an issue with getting choked on it... probably my lazy sipping mechanism... so I wont blame the beer. But, overall very nice and very drinkable. A very nice choice from NBB, not too over-rated like some of their other offerings. Order it and give it a try."
"D: I found this beer to be very drinkable and I took care of my 33.9 oz surprisingly quickly. If the weather had been warmer (and I had no obligations that evening) I wouldn't have hesitated to order another. Very"
"A pretty good beer, with a nice variety of fruity hops, but I find the flavors unbalanced and rather disjointed. Needs a stronger malt base, more carbonation."
"I could enjoy several of these on a hot summer day.. Super refreshing and delicious..."
"Pours a nice golden orange. Smell is grainy, dry, and some citrus. Taste is not that complex to me. It is very dry and grainy... Not very balanced, and the ABV seems higher than it is. This one goes straight to my head without any nuanced enjoyment. It feels light, but the finish is so dry that it hurts drinkability. It has more of a ""liquor"" feel to it than a beer feel. Maybe that's just the style, but I don't particularly care for it. I don't think I would buy this one again. It just seems like alcohol for the sake of alcohol... nothing special to give it taste enjoyment."
"Very quaffable beer, quite appropriate for the summer. But I still love Skinny Dip."
"Pours a clear, bright golden color with a medium white head that diminishes slowly. Scent is very grassy with hints of citrus lemon. Taste is initially lemony with some hoppy notes. Then I get some grassy floral notes that ate quite pleasant. Finishes with more lemon and hops. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and refreshing. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is not even close to being my favorite style in beer, but it is a great one for summertime."
"This pours dark golden and has very active bubbles and fluffy head. This beer, like some other New Belgium beers, seems pretty earthy. This one is particularly herbal and bitter, and not that amazing. This tastes like a bad salad. OK, ok, it’s decent. I don’t usually prefer summer beers for these weed-like flavors, so shoot me. This is medium bodied and drinkable, but I don’t want another."
"Gotta' love the play on words."
"O: Something I would reach for one nice warm day when I looking to have a few beers. Good summer style."
"-JH-"
"O: I was very thirsty when I was choosing what to review and out of all the beers I have, this one seemed the best for a hot day when your real thirsty. Definitely a good choice for that. Decent beer. Nothing to seek out or write home about."
"Pours a crystal clear light orange color with a 1/2 inch white head that fades to a thin cap. Fat foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt, honey, citrus, and slight apricot/peach notes. Taste is of sweet malt, citrus, apricot/peach and unfortunately a cooked veggie flavor which really detracts from the taste. There is a good level of carbonation with a bubbly and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, the veggie flavor in the taste kind of ruins the beer. I would be willing to try this from a bottle to see if the same thing happens again."
"overall: i got a few of these in the summer mix twelver from NB. the first one i pretty much hated, and i'm reviewing the second one now. my opinion of the beer has definitely improved since my first taste of it, but it is not a beer i would buy on it's own in single, bomber, or sixpack format. a few in a twelve pack is just fine."
"If I weren't hop crazed I'd drink this more this summer. Though I do have to say, pretty hoppy for a blonde ale. Good sitting by the pool brew."
"Overall-Another good beer from New Belgium. Nothing to fight over though. Good summer, session beer, but not all that refreshing."
"6 pack from Fred Meyer, N.Salem store. $6.99 Clear deep golden beer..small yet persistent pure white head. Fruity lemon scents and nice malty hops..simple yet nice! Smmoth malty flavour with noticable apricot..the oats seem to help keep this from getting too sweet and thin. Actually a nice smooth palate..probably because the oats. Overall i liked this..yet another good summer ""quaffer""."
"Crystal clear straw colored body with a lumpy eggshell cap that leaves some nice lace on the glass. Untoasted grain, citrus zest and herbal hops in the aroma. Mild but flavorful with a nice aggresive C-hop bite over a lean maltiness that falls just short of being really good but is a nice refeshing beer anyway. Soft, creamy mouthfeel no doubt from the addition of oats. A nice beer."
"Overall, this is really excellently drinkable stuff. I will definitely get this again some other time."
"O: Overall, this is a great summer session beer that has a simple, but strong palate. It's tasty enough to please those seeking more from a beer than the buzz, but subtle enough to be gentle on the stomach and thirst quenching. Cheers!"
"This drinks pretty easily. The style is the craft version of Light Lager-- just more flavor. This beer is a good example of a good brewery making a good beer that has mass appeal. This is an excellent summertime beer that would be enjoyed by Pliny AND Bud fans."
"Overall this was an excellent summer beer. Nothing over the top, just a very refreshing brew. I really liked the subtle apricot and how easy this beer went down. Definitely worth picking up a sixer. Now I just need New Belgium to can this beer so I can take it with me everywhere I go this summer."
"O: Will be taking the rest of this sixer to the ballpark tomorrow. I enjoy this much more than any American Pale Wheat Ale I've tried, but it has all the summertime drinkability and lemon presence that many folks flock too during the hot months. This could be a summer staple for me."
"Somewhat crisp. For style this is pretty good. For me, it'd have to be a blazing hot day to drink it..just for the lightness of taste."
"Overall - a very interesting beer..not as much in concept but more in its actual taste."
"O - This is a decent enough session beer, but the extreme hop flavor and yeast profile for the style make it not as refreshing as other versions of the style. This beer is a bit out-of-balance for a summer thirst-quencher."
"Overall, I have to say my expectations are far exceeded with this new offering from New Belgium. I think I may have found my summer beer! I love how drinkable it is and yet the flavor profile strays just far enough away from the generic light and sweet pale summer beers to keep things interesting."
"Overall, this is a decent summer offering that is drinkable, especially on a hot summer day. However, it is lacking in taste compared to other summer offerings."
"O: Overall tasty, this would be a nice summer brew. Although it is fairly forgettable. It matches the style well, but is not something I would get very often."
"Mouthfeel: Very clean and crisp, this is perfect for a summer beer. Goes down very easily. I personally dont care for ""heavy"" or ""thick"" beers in the summer (Which is contiguous with winter stouts and ales.)"
"This ale has honey golden color with a head that clings for a long time. The smell is bright with a hint of complexity. The flavor has a medium body but a lot of balance between bitter and sweet and maltiness. The flavor stays on the tongue for a long time and continues to get better sip by sip. This is a fantastic session ale."
"Overall – I will be picking this up again. A great summer beer and one packed with flavor. Easy to quaff, and quenches the thirst."
"good job new belgium"
"Comes out of the tap a clear coppery orange amber with a fine-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is malty, fruity, and slightly fruit-sweet. Crisp, mainly fruity is almost like a dry cider, but it has malty and wheaty undertones as well as just a hint of lemon. Texture is fizzy and lively - a great way to welcome summer."
"I will definitely be enjoying several Somersaults this summer."
"DELICIOUS, GET SOME!"
"New Belgium is hit and miss for me. Everyone LOVES fat tire. But not me. I enjoyed their Ranger IPA. Not enough to get another 6 pack of it but I wouldn't turn it down when offered. So when I had a chance to snag @BrewJockey's last Somersault I went for it. Glad I did. This is good stuff and a total departure from what I envisioned New Belgium to be. I'll be getting more of this beer this summer."
"Beautiful copper with clean transparency, thin white foamy head that retains nicely throughout leaving spotty sea foam lace. The smell is fruity. Definite touch of apricot and fruity hops on a clean biscuit, bready malt backbone. Touch of light sweet caramels and floral tones and ginger touches. Nice flowery hops kick in the front of the tounge followed by light fruits of apricot, lemon and pineaple notes. Citrusy. Clean bready malts with a touch of caramel with a clean finish. A slight creaminess in the front with a slightly watery finish. Overall, watery but this is nice for a summer beer. Nice fruity, light and easy to drink beer. Nothing cloying in the fruit, great well rounded hop profile with a light bready malt. Great, easy to drink summertime beer."
"Pouren into a noic a dull lighter golder with athinner but well defined white head that left a few broken rings of lace as it settled.Like others have said the aromas are quite yeasty and toasty,caramel/biscuit lends a little sweetness.Somewhat dry and grainy on the palate,the big yeastiness again is a big component of the beer.Its a good summer brew,a little bigger than many with its full on yeast attack."
"O: Great summertime beer, and that is what it was brewed for. I love New Belgium beers, and this is probably second to Fat Tire. I would recommend this for a hot summer afternoon as it is crip and refreshing and not too heavy. I would also recommend this for someone who regularly drinks commercial beers and wants to explore new territory."
"Pretty good. Whole lot better than Skinny Dip."
"All in all a very easy drinking summer ale. If this one is going to be on store shelves this summer, it could become a staple at my house, especially on sale."
"The overly soapy and oily hops detract for me. I love New Belgium, but there are many other beers for the summer that I will pick over this. Locally made at that. Nothing I would recommend."
"A well constructed and sessionable blonde or golden ale."
"Drinkability can be described as..Meh. Better that Fat Tire I suppose, but boring. No resell here."
"Taste is smooth and rich, with some hint of spice, hops, and a soft tint of fruit underneath it all. Quite complex, especially for a 5.4% summer ale. Excellent, and a brew I always stock up on in Summer."
"This beer proves that fizzy, yellow beer doesn't always have to be the enemy (ya hear that, Koch?)...it so often is, of course, but this beer is my pick for Summer Beer 2011."
"D: Very surprised by this one. A great summer beer while (IMHO) not a stellar overall brew."
"Overall- One of the best blonde ales I might have ever had (from an American Brewery)! Terrific for the summer and MUCH better than last summer's seasonal by New Belgium (Skinny Dip). I have had questions at the Pub if we are getting their Skinny Dip and I say, take a drink of this one! Fuckin right!"
"Pours a clear, gold color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, slight earthy malt, slight pine, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Blonde Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight pine, sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of earthy malt, and slight spice. Overall, good appearance, blend, and body."
"I was very excited to try New Belgium's summer ale, but I just wasn't that impressed. I'll stick to Fat Tire."
"Wasn't sure quite to expect but enjoyed this! Perfect for drinking on the patio on a Summer evening or with a light lunch! Been looking for a good summer beer since the demise of Petes Rally Cap! This has hints of citrus in a bright light beer that goes down all too easily!"
"Summer doesn't have to be light. It can have a great taste while retaining its easy drinking qualities. That's what New Belgium has done with Somersault. It was very difficult to put down my glass during lunch. Excellent all around beer."
"A refreshing summer brew with characteristic NB flavor. Malts are grassy and smooth. Clean, spicy hops in the finish. Time for another."
"I like this beer for several reasons. Well first off, I do not find Bud Light, Budweiser, Miller Light, Coors Light (etc, etc, etc) refreshing. I know many BAs do. That disgusting husky grain smell and taste are just brutal. I get that smell/flavor in so many American Blonde Ales too. This beer skips that and manages to become incredibly refreshing and tasty. It's a great hot weather beer and also a perfect beer to pass on to a BMC drinker."
"O - Its a session beer and I can see where they were going with it. Its actually pretty refreshing I certainly could see drinking a couple of these on a summer day. Nothing though stands out in this one. But I can't say its not a decent beer either."
"O: Overall this is a nice and drinkable brew, but the flavors are a bit low and overall very standard."
"Overall pretty good - a good summer thirst quencher."
"Somersault starts with the aroma, which has a certain level of lemony graininess. It also has a light sourdough bread characteristic that I usually get out of lagers. It’s a pretty beer, blonde in color, with a nice foamy head. I’m eating this with goat cheese and it actually goes really well together. The high carbonation of the beer helps to scrub the palate of the creamy goat cheese, and the citrusy taste plays well with the smooth cheese. I had this on tap earlier this week and didn’t really care for it, but for whatever reason tonight it’s kind of hitting the spot. Does a neat trick of being very light and easy to drink while remaining full flavored. Not bad at all."
"I know this is an American blonde but I swear I got a feeling of a belgian pale from it. Light yellow-orange in color, decent head. Smells like orange a little. The flavor had a bit of citrus and peach but just a tiny bit and then I tasted spice (I swear). This wasn;t bad but I did not find it as refreshing as some of the other reviewers here and I most likely won;t revisit this."
"The body was on the thin side of average for the style. Drinkability was OK, but why bother when there are better examples out there."
"Pours a brilliant golden hue with white head, thick at first, then retains a thin rim layer. Nice. Nose is on the light side, with some herbal notes & gentle funk in the background. Palate offers a pleasant spicy to herbal character, a little earthy/dirty, medium bodied (not too light!), and finishes herbal/spicy too. Enjoyable."
"Notes: This is perhaps the cleanest brew I have tasted from New Belgium. Light in body, yet very full-flavored. This is an ideal Summer brew. Very well-balanced and very drinkable."
"This is one of the better summer seasonal ales I've had in a long time. A very nice American Blonde ale. I will happily return to this a few times this year without hesitation."
"O: Easily drinkable. Not too over-flavored. Smooth and balanced."
"This beer pours a very, very clear yet nice gold in color with a one finger bright white head. It is very light in body but very well carbonated. The aromas are of yeast, a honey like sweetness, and nice coriander/citrus zest. It smells pretty damn good. The flavors are of sweet pale malts, light honey, spices, and orange peels. It has a nice crisp bite to it. The flavor isn't quite as good as the aromas but it's pretty solid. It drinks well and is an excellent option for a hot summer's day. Overall, I'm kind of impressed by this one."
"O - I'm going to buy a six pack for sure. If I had bought a sixer to begin with I wouldn't have been disappointed."
"Tangy sweet apple notes leads off the flavor too, zippy with a little bit of earthy dandelion and residual herbal hop bitterness. Light orange citrus in the first few sips that becomes indistinct later on, giving way to the apple and herbal notes. Light bodied and easy drinking, great summer session candidate."
"Flavor is coarse and dry, presumably from the addition of oats, and offers bready lemon notes and a bit of spice on the finish. Offers a smooth and full/bready feel with a light hint of bitterness. Overall a bit dense and not overly refreshing for the style, yet pleasant enough."
"I would not expect anything less from New Belgium, very easy drinking for a hot day but still packed with intricacies."
"Drinability. One of the smoothest I've had. It drinks very well. A great summer beer."
"O - This is a very tasty blonde ale. Very high on the sessionable scale."
"O: This is pretty much in the New Belgium simple summer beer style ala Skinny Dip. But it's better than that beer and is clearly well made. Worth a purchase in my opinion."
"Overall, a great summer beer. Bolder flavors and a bigger body make this a great sessionable brew."
"O- This beer was good. Is it something I would drink a lot of?? Maybe not. A nice clean tasting summertime beer. Nothing over the top special about this beer but I did enjoy it. The ABV doesn't show up much. Overall another nice beer from New Belgium."
"Overall I thought this was a good, light, easy drinking blonde ale that would for sure hit the spot on a hot summer day. Everything was pretty on par for it's style and good, the only thing I would change is to have the finish be a little less bitter and maybe make the body a tad bit lighter. This brew had great drinkability, I could easily put down three or four of these while playing disc golf in the summer. If New Belgium was available in Michigan I would probably buy a couple six packs during the summer to enjoy, but since they aren't i'll have to enjoy the two I have. If you have access to New Belgium and want a good light summertime beer then you might want to give Somersault a try. So far the two beers I have had from New Belgium have been good, I hope the third one I have is just as good."
"Another seasonal with that ""signature"" Fat Tire biscuit maltiness, I like balance but I really prefer my summer beer to be lighter and more uplifting. The sour flash at the end of the drink is a nice surprise, decent effort but I think I'll stick with a nice wheat beer."
"Always nice to see new faces in the mixed sixer section. This member pours a clear brass topped by a healthy finger of ever-so-slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises coriander, wheat, light grapefruit peel, very light caramel and light orange zest. The taste holds notes of heftier (yet still mild) caramel, coriander, light lemon zest, light butter, mandarin oranges, and light grapefruit zest. The body is a slightly hefty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a nearly crisp finish. Overall, a nice little blonde, no pretenses toward anything but refreshment, and this brew delivers in that area. Not bad."
"Poured a pretty clear golden color into the SA Perfect Pint Glass. Nice creamy white head that hung around for a couple minutes and nice lacing. Not a whole lot on the nose: malt, a little yeast, and some flowering overtones. Taste was pretty decent: malt, biscut, some citrusy flavor, and no bitterness whatsoever. Not bad for a summer brew, I guess, but there are better ones out there. Doubtful I'd seek this one out again."
"O: This will be a nice summer beer, nothing over the top and every bit as good as Skinny Dip. A welcome change to the summer line up. This will be nice to sip on as the weather continues to warm up. I would have no problem having a few of these at a barbeque or out camping."
"Nice light refreshing beer. Good summer seasonal. Not too much jumps out at me with this guy."
"Its the lightest tasting ale I've ever had. Its almost tasteless in a way but very refreshing. Its not sweet not bitter not watery not much of anything but refreshing. The smell is pleasent but nothing different, the color is nice and light and the head is average. I recommend as a nice session beer."
"This is a very nice summertime session beer. Easy drinking, and tasty. I was disappointed to hear that the weren't bringing Skinny Dip back, but Somersault is good as the skinny."
"O: Not a bad beer, but nothing to look forward to either, I could see myself again drinking one in the summer at a BBQ or something if it was there, but won't go out of my way to drink it."
"D: Such a refreshing beer from NB--it is nice to have a balanced but still pleasantly hopped session beer; this is definitely a beer I will come back to this summer"
"O- A decent summer beer. Light and clean with some pleasant flavors. A good effort."
"O: A nice spring ale - refreshing, crisp and clean. But not too flavorful... probably won’t be picking up any sixers of this - oh, well."
"Drinkability is average because my palate just can't wrap itself around the total package that is Somersault. My summer can do without this beer.."
"O- just an average ale for me,easy to drink..but not alot of intrest in this on"
"Picked up a Spring Folly Pack in which this beer is featured. Not much to say, I wasn't extremely impressed like I was with Mighty Arrow. Its sort of a pale Ranger. Very very earthy, takes you to the meadow pictured on the label. Probably won't pick it up separately, but be sure to pick up NBB's Folly Packs, they're amazing and are better than most beers in your local market. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"Overall -- An easy-drinker, but somehow doesn't hit the spot for me. The grassy hop bitterness grows tiresome over time."
"It's a tasty beer, but skinny dip and sunshine wheat are better in their summery type range of offerings."
"Very refreshing summer seasonal, as they should be. I highly enjoyed this offering!"
"O: A pleasant quaff. Will be good for the warmer weather, and I can see spending some time with this on the front porch a couple of months from now. Also has potential as a brew to lure the uninitiated away from BigMegaCorpSwill."
"Compared to the beer this replaced (Skinny Dip), I'd say New Belgium hit this one out of the park. It's not a great beer by any means, but it will be a mainstay in my summer fridge. Very nicely put together."
"Another amazing product from an amazing AMERICAN owned company."
"Definitely a good summer drinker. This will probably make it into the fridge once or twice more before fall."
