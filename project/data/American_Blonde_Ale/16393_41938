3.61,4,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,"actually self titled a kolsch, this is more of a german American hybrid. it pours a mostly clear golden blond color, with just a thin head that fades fast, nothing special to look at. the nose is slightly fruity, with pilsner malts in the background and some german feeling yeast that's both doughy and dry. the flavor of this ale is very light, with some straw-like malts and just a dusting of hops coming through. mellow fruit, although it flashes too quick to properly identify it. finish is mildly bitter, a little contaminated, as if by minerals, hard water or something, I don't know. good feel though, drinkable nice and easy. carbonation is much better than it appears, and the body is only light. a good summer quencher, but not a beer that has anything new to offer. I think the ipa is the best of the mission beers so far, but I still have the Russian imperial in the fridge, so there is some hope remaining. a beer my Molson drinking father would adore. for me, just another day at the office.","StonedTrippin","May 09, 2013"

Bready/biscuity malt flavors in the beginning lemon and yeast through the middle with a faint hint of banana.

After letting it settle and continuing to pour, the beer took almost 5 minutes to pour completely. I would say that denotes a solid sign of overcarbonation. The beer is an extremely light and pale straw-yellow coloring, again with the big bubbled, white, chunky head that finally settles into a manageable one inch level. Aromas of bright, sweet lemon zest and slightly sour tones. Also some scents of toasted oats. Flavors a bit muted, but a backbone of crisp, wet hops slips in and hits the back of the mouth. Bits of smoke and toasted malts riding the hoppy foundation. The beer is very wet in mouth, both light and slick. Minimal sour and toasted aftertaste, with a short lived finish. Not an overwhelmingly pleasant beer, and when added to the time involved just to pour the damn thing, it really was disappointing.","GarthDanielson","Mar 25, 2011"

Mission's isn't incredible, but it's still a light, easy-drinking beer with a pleasing flavor. My biggest complaint is that the vinous flavor gets overshadowed by noble hop bitterness. I like the really grapey ones best, and while the aroma is nice and grapey, the hops overpower the vinous note once you take a sip. Also, the mouthfeel seems to be lacking the effervescence of more traditional versions. They need to crank up the carbonation. All that said, it would be a very nice session beer.
