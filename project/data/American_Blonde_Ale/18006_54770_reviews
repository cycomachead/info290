"Mouthfeel is very light, a little dry. Overall, it's pretty good."

"Mouthfeel has alot of carbonation, light body and very refreshing"

"I wonder if I got a bad batch. The beer was just odd. Tasted at the tap room."
""
"Overall it is a nice session drinker. No complaints but it is little tough to get too excited about this one."
"Mouth is crisp and inviting. This is an easy drinking session beer with enough facets to keep you coming back. Well done!"
""
""
"An interesting, and not typical blonde ale. Looks nice, but cloudy. Good head. Interesting body. Full. Carries way more body than a blonde ale usually does. If this were what a blonde ale typically was, I'd be happy. Unfortunately that isn't the case. Other brewers should follow this lead. Either way, a nice beer to try."

"This is like a lighter version of Daisy Cutter. Good doses of tropical fruits. Easily one of the best American Blonde Ales that I've ever had."
""
"Overall, it really doesn't balance well. Just throwing hops at a beer does not make it interesting or complex, just hoppy. One trick pony."

"o - Overall a decent blonde ale, though with cans of Daisy Cutter also on the menu, no real reason to get more than one of this. Some nice fruit in the nose though the taste is a little blander. Would have it again thought wouldn't specifically seek it out."
""
"16 ounce can into pint glass, no canning date. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slightly foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, wheat, bread, grass, and floral hops. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good strength, balance, and hop complexity. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple, wheat, bready grain, light pine, citrus rind, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Light citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, wheat, bready grain, light pine, citrus rind, floral, grass, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Very nice flavor balance with a good amount of hop flavors; zero cloying flavors present on the finish as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol warming is pretty much invisible, with hardly anything present on the finish as expected. Overall this is a damn nice blonde ale! Very nice hoppy flavor with good malt balance; and extremely easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"O- This beer is very ""sessionable"". With it's low ABV and smoothness, I'd enjoy this on a hot summer day. This is also one of Half Acre's year round beers, and even though it isn't very special, it is still a good flagship beer that's respectable to their name."

"Full body for a lighter gold ale. Semisweet grains on the tip of the tongue, lightly buttery on the middle of the tongue. Citric and floral hop finishes balances nicely. Lingering hoppyness In the mouth. Held back and slightly boring but what blonde ale isn't. Nice and clean and tasty though."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was medium to thin with a smooth, mild carbonation."

"O - This is a nice blonde ale. Nothing too spectacular but very sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a golden color to a Russian River pint glass, with a fingers width of white head, smell is mild but some danky hop resins and mild citrus. Taste is very nice for being such a mild beer, I could honestly drink this beer all day long with pleasure. Nice citrus hop is most noticeable, slightly floral, and refreshing."
""
"O: Very solid overall and one of the better (if not the best) blonde I've ever head. Drinking many of these on a hot day would be no problem."
""
"O: Average for the style."

"O - Really like this beer. I give it bonus points for doing all that it does at only 4.2%. If there is a better Spring/Summer session beer, I have yet to come across it."
""
"Poured from can into DFH snifter. Pours a murky yellow/orange color. decent lacing and head retention. small bubbles come up from the bottom of the glass. Smell- there is a floral aroma..reminds me of potpourri and popcorn. Buttery aroma. Orange peel as well. Taste- mild bitterness with an unwanted soapy experience. somewhat watery. A little coriander, lemon peel. This lacks body, sweetness, and is a little high on carbonation. I suppose if in the summer, this would drink well from the can if it was a little colder. But, this isn't that memorable. A little bleh."

"From a schooner at the Portillo's in downtown Chicago. Definitely a nice complement to the excellent hotdogs, but nothing terribly special. Very drinkable blonde ale with a semi-sweet nose. Well balanced malt and slight hops taste. Could have used a little more hop flavor actually. I wasn't looking for something to blow me away, just a nice, drinkable beer with lunch."
"O: Somewhat odd flavor profile, but not totally bad. Very grainy with a little bit of bittering hops."
""
""
"Not bad for the style, but I'd strongly prefer Daisy Cutter (or hell, Zombie Dust) 100 times out of 100."
""
"O: My 4.5 betrays some of my other scores but this beer is definitely in my top 3. I love it. Its even better during the Summer. I can't wait to have a growler of this in the fridge during the warm days. One of my go-to's when I want to kick back and have a few."
""
"O: C+ or B- you call it. It's not a terrible beer, but that soapy flavor really was off putting for me. I don't know if it was my and my taste buds, or the can."
""
"Reveal: Half Acre Gossamer! I've also seen this in stores many times, but always reached for the Daisy Cutter. Really interesting. 4.2% Golden Ale is not exactly what I was thinking, but I guess it makes sense. Thanks for another beer I've been meaning to try!"
""
""
""
"O: this isn't your average yellow fizzy beer! This stuff packs a punch of flavors! If you come across this then pick some up as these would be perfect over a hot summery day. Very sessionable at 4.2%."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is golden hued with a half inch of white head. The aroma brings some grain, along with some tropical citrus notes. The flavor offers a lot of grain, with some musty citrus. Very bready. Easy to drink, though I would prefer the balance favor the hop profile a bit more than the grain. Light feel and smooth on the palate. Overall, highly drinkable. A great choice for the warmer months."
""
""
""
"O verall - solid beer, decent sessionable type, but blondes are not my favorite"
""
"O: This one totally embodies the idea of the ""session beer"" to my mind. I could drink this all day, and can't wait to bring a couple of these back home so that a couple of my BA peeps can experience the magic!"
"The tastes is really well balanced: nice citrus bitterness up front, a little malty sweetness in the middle, and it finishes with a combination between vanilla and sour. Light bodied and easy to drink, it's not as fizzy as one would expect. Overall, one of my standbys, particularly in the summer."
""
"Having a can of Half Acre Gossamer Golden Ale after a Wednesday Hockey game (2G, 5A) in a 9-2 win. The beer pours a golden straw color with thin white head that is leaving a mild lace. The smell is nice with a slight citrus hop. The taste is a combo of floral and citrus tones that leaves the pallet a bit bitter and acidic. I am guessing that Columbus hops were used....but I am no expert. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodies Ales with good carbonation. Overall it isnt a bad beer. Would be great on hot days."
""
""
"o - overall, this is not a style that i jump for joy over, but hi enjoyed this beer a lot. great example and smooth mouth...this is a beer that i could drink all day long in the summer. another great beer from a great brewery."
""
"This is definitely good, but it's not something I am disappointed that I can't get regularly. It's good for the style, but it could be better. I'm not particularly a fan of the grassy aroma. Maybe because I am allergic to grass?"

"O - nice, refreshing golden ale with flavorful hops"

"Tall-boy can into a pint glass. Bright golden body with fine head. Sweet malt dominates the nose, but decently balanced. Taste is smooth and mellow. This isn't my favorite style, but chicks seem to like it a lot--sweet finish with low alcohol. Nothing crazy exceptional here, but it's a good session blonde ale if you're into that sort of thing. Decent deal in the 4 tall-boy packs too and nice to support local breweries. Not sure if they distribute much outside of the Chicago area, but recommended...will order it on draught sometime and post a tap review too as this is frequently available on tap at bars I go to."
"Clean, crisp and highly hopped for a blonde, this is one of the better versions of the style I've had."
"Overall: Easy to drink and with just enough flavor to keep things interesting. This would be a solid beer to have around for drinking outside or on a hot day. Half Acre scores again."
"D. Very good. Another great beer from Half Acre."
"Always thrilled to try beers from these guys, this is nice sessionable blond ale that goes down too easy in this plus 90 degree weather here now"
"Overall, Gossamer is a solid session brew with more flavour and hop character than your average blonde ale. Perfect for summer time patio drinking, and definitely worth a try."
"O - A nice beer for warmer days where the just need some crisp, clean beer that is easy drinking and still provides a little flavor and body. Not an earth shaking beer, but it has its spot and fits well. Thankfully I drank this on a hot day where I did plenty of activity, so fit perfectly."
"Overall this is a really nice summer beer. Low ABV, light mouthfeel and a crisp refreshing taste . Good beer."
"O: Quite easy drinking, though not surprising given how light this beer is. A very good, enjoyable session beer."
"O - Very likely the best Blond Ale I've had, I could blow through a lot of these on a Sunday afternoon!"
"Refreshing and very drinkable blond ale. Nice hop, like a pale.A little yeast. Orange flavour. Above average mouthfeel. See what can be done at sessionable abv levels!SilverX's 500 ml can.Golden colour with wisp of head. Clean and crisp, neutral aroma."
"Despite that watery finish, it never feels watery in terms of mouthfeel. It stays at a consistent light-medium body with a balanced carbonation level. Overall, this is a mostly average beer. I do appreciate the unexpected or unique flavors here, I just wish that they stuck around from the initial taste through to the finish."
"Overall, decent beer. Not terrible. I could drink it again...it's definitely a sessionable beer at 4.2 abv. Refreshing."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. Just like their Daisy Cutter Pale Ale, this would be on the grocery list each week if I lived in Chicago."
"O- Overall this a very refreshing and enjoyable brew. Perfect for a lazy summer afternoon or a day at the beach. If this were available to me locally I would certainly have it on a regular basis. Very tasty."
"Finish: Great finish, smooth. I loved this beer, perfect for the summer. It gives great taste without killing your taste buds."
"Overall -- Aside from being the weirdest looking beer I have EVER come across, the cask version of Gossamer is a decisive improvement from the standard issue. The yeast derived flavors add nice complexity and the cask conditioning make this much more drinkable, albeit much heartier. With all of that yeast I think I'll be all set on Vitamin B for a while..."
"O - A nice brew, not one I would seek out, but I'm glad I got to try it! Good brew in a good trade! Try it if you find it! I would be a delicious summer camping brew!"
"Very drinkable and local. Will buy again."
"O: This is my favorite session beer, bar none. I could drink this stuff all day and not grow tired of it. It's not too sweet to get overwhelming, but has enough flavor to keep it interesting and refreshing."
"O: Gossamer is refreshing as they come and a joy to drink..the perfect beer when you've just finished mowing the lawn. Honestly, this reminds me a lot of some of the IPAs I had while in the UK a couple of months back due to their tea like quality and more muted hops, especially when compared to their American cousins."
"D-Daisy Cutter could be both a success and curse for Half Acre, I think that this beer will always be compared, and it just isn't as good. It is very light and drinkable, I think I would really appreciate having this on a hot summer day, but given other options there are plenty of beers I would pick first."
"O- I found a nice easy camping beer with this one. The can is an added bonus. The taste is somewhat disappointing because the smell is so pleasant. Overall, it is an easy drinking session beer that I would have no qualms about having quite a few in a row."
"Good stuff, when the temps get rocking, grab a gossamer...if there is no Daisy Cutter. Maybe the best Golden ale i've had, i normally don't buy them, but i will buy this each chicago trip."
"Great session brew."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice, light to medium hopped blonde ale."
"Overall, an easy drinking, light golden ale. Nothing aggressive or offensive. Good all around session beer. As light as a gossamer wing."
"Good light beer drinkibility, with light flavor."
"Overall (2): While very drinkable, it's not anything special. A good, light beer with some flavor but not something I'll come back to frequently if ever."
"O- This beer surprised me, very easy drinkability. I could throw down a bunch of these on a hot summer day."
"D - Golden ales aren't the most complex beers out there, but this one did a pretty good job of keeping itself interesting. I really enjoyed the Daisy Cutter and enjoyed this one too. Half Acre keeps impressing me..."
"O - A solid blonde ale. I'll admit, this usually isn't the type of beer I would normally buy if I were searching the beer cooler at my local shop. This beer is a fine example, and very refreshing. I can only imagine how nice this beer would be if I were outside shooting a round of disc golf. This would be a perfect beer to take to the course. I would buy this if it were available. It would be a great summer ale, or party beer. I would absolutely use this beer to convert BMC drinkers."
"O: A low-weight blonde ale, just a hair above 4%. More please, especially the orange citrus and grassy hops."
"D: Mmmm - session beer for sure."
"D: Great session brew! I still prefer Daisy Cutter over this, but quite flavorful for such a low ABV brew. Check out Half Acre brews, you will be impressed. Excellent Summer and newbie brew."
" Judging by other reviews I'd say I got an old can, but with no dating I can't be sure."
"Very crisp and flavorful for a golden ale, done an American way with the crisp attenuation and citrus hop notes. An all-purpose beer with a near sessionable quality- this is an absolute joy to drink."
"A very easy drinking ale from the folks at Half Acre."
"Can poured into a pint glass. Pours a crystal clear pale gold. A small white head coats the top. Fair spotty lace clings to the glass. The nose is fresh with scents of cut-grass, lemons, floral hops, and citrus. Very potent for the style. The mouth is much more full than expected as well. Good carbonation. Plenty of hops at the forefront of this one. Mild bitterness, but juicy citrus flavors abound. Grass-like qualities noted, some mild hay. This beer breaks away from the norm on the style by packing plenty of flavor. Good beer. Thanks for the opportunity, Baron."
"First sip reveals an average to light body with gentle roling carb. Flavor is caramel and white grapes with a hint of grassy hops. Overall the flavor is mild, with a decent mixture of tastes. The beer is not overly complex but is decent session beer that could be consumed while watching a game at the pub with friends and not get bloated full or bored. Its good for what it is."
"Color me impressed. Not a beer I anticipated liking based on the style, I was pleasantly surprised. Flavorful enough to keep me interested and light enough to drank several in a sitting. I would pick this up on somewhat of a regular basis if it were available here."
"All of which makes it sound more complex than it is - it isn't. Quick, simple hitter that slips away quickly, but without making much of an impression. Good, solid session brew. Small brewers, are you paying attention? Make more of these!"
"Lighter body, higher carbonation, a little sticky and dry. Quick drinking, alcohol is invisible, and the flavors are decent enough for the style. The nose was oddly subdued, although I'd enjoy this during the warmer weather."
"Notes: Insanely drinkable and super tasty. Don't think I could get bored with this one."
"I thought it was a very sessionable drinker--grainy malts, sweet grassy hops, smooth, with a pop of bitter orange rind. Maybe a little bit over-carbonated--it felt gassy?--but also pretty creamy and smooth. Goes great with pizza."
"Beer is pretty thin and a little watery. There is a lot of fruit hop flavors in the midpalate and the finish is so wet that there is no chance for an aftertaste....almost....there is a really late aftertaste of grains that comes much after you've finish. Overall its a decent blonde, I'd have it again, i love the artwork on the can and the flavors and aroma were interesting."
"This beer is exactly what it is supposed to be. It is light, refreshing, and pretty damn tasty. I tend to find American Blondes either so light that I shudder to call them beer or to sweet and cloying on the palate. Gossamer bridges the gap nicely. It has a decent body, a crisp clean taste, and is not overly sweet. It pours a beautiful gold with an impressive head and consistent carbonation running up from the bottom. Not much smell but there is a little fruity estery thing going on there. This is a lawnmower/grilling beer. It almost seems like a mistake to focus heavily on tasting notes. Super drinkable."
"Light, refreshing, and easy to drink. I was unaware that this was a style, but this seems to be a pretty good one all around, to me. The finish is drying, but not overwhelming. Overall, a very enjoyable beer, and a welcome beverage after a day of work around the yard and house."
"I'm definitely planning on revisiting this one as soon as I get the chance as I find it hard to believe that this is legit... Looked and smelled very good and then went downhill fast..."
"Light, refreshing, and a lower alcohol content - you could drink this all day long."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light but not thin. Carbonation levels work well for the beers character. This is definately a throw back sessionable beer. I could drink a bunch of this."
"Overall, an average beer. Nothing to special. I have had better from half acres. Okay drinkability."
"You gotta love free beer while touring a brewery, right? This freebie pours a clear bright pale straw topped by about a finger or so of fluffy white foam. The nose is a blast of florality, as though a small meadow had been pressed into my cup, which had been previously lined with some light buttery caramel. The taste toned down the florals by a fair degree, leaving some fossils to be gazed at while munching on some watered-down caramel corn. Basically, tone down a Daisy Cutter a bit, and you'll be left with this. That doesn't mean I dislike this flavor, by any stretch,, it's just a way to describe it. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a refreshing feel. Overall, a very nice, sessionable blonde. Good times down at Half Acre, I tells ya."
"The one poured a nice golden color with perhaps a minor haze to it. The head comprises of a nice ecru foam that is pretty cloudy and stiff. The nose was of hoppy citrus notes as well as some notes of the pale malts that may have been slightly roasted. The taste was fairly uneventful. The aromas that had been in existence to give it that extra pop were not very evident. As was agreed on by the others in my party, this tasted like a toned-down Daisy Cutter. There was a wheatlike breadiness to it that was surprising due to the relative clarity of the beer. It sat rather well in the mouth. The carbonation was spot on, and you can't say anything against the freshness of it. Overall it was extremely drinkable and very sessionable brew and something I would recommend for a relaxing summer day."
"drinkability: good"
"D - Very well hopped, this is the best example of the ""style"" I've had I'd say. Still, I can't get a Patton Oswalt quote out of my head when I think of this beer, ""Write it in the sky with gossamer teardrops. Battered...chapped...pussy."""
"This is a highly drinkable, summertime session ale. Definitely worth a shot."
"at 4.7 abv, cold in a can, looking for a cooler, this one is very drinkable."
"I really enjoyed this blonde. The malt bill is very good, and the hops are assertive. I'm also impressed with the flavor that is packed into the relatively low ABV."
"D: i love that this is a refreshing 4.2% beer in a 16 oz can, but i'd like a bit more american hops, or something, to make this anything more than a typical blonde/golden ale."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a large head that had good retention. The head slowly settled to a thick cap. A large amount of lacing is left on the glass. I pick up floral and grassy hops in the aroma. I do not smell malt. The flavor is more hoppy than most blonde ales. The hops gives some fruity qualities to the taste. The malt has a dry cracker like quality. Very clean taste. Bitterness is higher than most as well. Light body and nicely carbonated. Feels lively and does not linger on the palate for long. A nice little blond ale that comes in ""pounders"". A good summer brew with great packaging."
"This is a perfect low-abv sessionable summer brew. I really wish they would distrubute a little further into the western Chicago burbs because I haven't had anything I haven't liked from them and there use of hops is just phenomenal."
"Goes down really easy and is a very refreshing beer. Also digging the low alcohol by volume and the fact that it's canned. A really great American Blonde from Half Acre. If they nailed the mouthfeel it may have helped bump up the drinkability by 0.5 as well and made this a solid A."
"Very easy drinking."
"D: if you want a sessionable brew with loads of malt flavor- here you go. This is an expertly balanced brew. I don't typically purchase golden ales or blonde ales (not sure exactly what this is- can says golden, BA says Blonde), but this one is special. These Half Acre cans are my new summer go to beer."
"Drinkability is good. Not a lot going on with this beer, but the flavor has some decent citrus to it, the body is fairly crisp and the ABV is low. So a pint or two of this would be easy on a hot day."
"Tastes light with a hoppy bitterness up front and a watery, slightly nutty sweet malt finish with a bit of floral honey character throughout. Very fresh, clean flavors and well-balanced. Large, rounded and slightly tingly carbonation accentuates an otherwise light body. Drinks like water. I might wish for a little more flavor somewhere in the middle of it all, otherwise this is a perfect summer beer. Glad to have tried it."
"Nothing like a big blonde! I got two fingers' worth of French Vanilla-colored head off of my initial pour, which I had to back off of lest it spill over the rim of the glass. Color was a slightly hazy golden yellow (and remember, boys and girls, clarity is over-rated). Nose had a fruity sweetness, like tangerine or melon or both. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was fruity, but drier than the nose had led me to expect. Finish lingered with a pleasant fruitiness. This would be good on a hot day in the sun, especially given its low ABV, but conversely, it was not exciting enough to warrant seeking out for the cooler."
"Mouthfeel is light and the carbonation is on the higher side. Drinkability is good, it has some very nice flavors to it. The crisp citrus flavor was particularly nice and made it a pretty nice and refreshing beer. overall a very nice, flavorful and well balanced beer."
"Nicely easy-drinking. At 4.20%abv (dude!) this one is definitely sessionable."
"This was very tasty. A light Golden Ale with a fresh zesty profile and a super easy drinkibility to it. This one was a great choice for the tall-boy cans, as it's prefect for summer imbibing."
"I had this on tap at Half Acre. The beer pours a light murky gold with a decent white head, nothing of note. The aroma is light hops pretty boring. The taste is bad, its a trumped of version of a bud light. Light hop, mostly skunk and a super light feel. Mouthfeel is water and not something I would drink more than half a pint of. Quite disappointing."
"This is not a stand-out beer by any means, but is a great candidate for the cooler in the summer. Easy on the alcohol and somewhat easy on the wallet (in craft standards). Full flavored enough while still being incredibly easy to drink and refreshing. This is a great summer beer that will probably see a lot of cooler time from me this summer, whether it be concert tailgating, golfing, fishing, or chilling on the lake...cans are the way to go for the summer!!"
"As for drinkability: Half-Acre's version of a session ale truly hits the mark. It practically begs to be quaffed while relaxing on a porch. No other location would do it justice."
"Drinkability is immense. Not since Surly has a beer in a can been so good to me. Thanks again, Freddy - never heard of this beer before you, and I definitely seek it out next time I'm up in the Chi."
"D: I've had the pleasure of enjoying this on draft, from a growler, and now from a can. I can say that (as soon as it is readily available around town, in cans) this will be my go to summer session ale. This is a wonderful, easy to drink, and flavorful Blonde Ale. Great work guys!"
"A freebie to take home from DLD, I think this can was from Masterski. The beer pours a pale orange color, slightly hazed, with a few fingers of yeast-cake-looking foam. The beer smells like a straightforward ale, clean with hops presenting as a bitter note rather than floral or citrus. The taste is likewise straightforward, grainy and toasty, again the bitterness in the aftertaste but not as strong as in the aroma. Light bodied and easy to pound. With the low ABV I'd call this a perfect summertime beer, not the most flavorful from Half Acre but that's not what they were shooting for."
"D: I'd drink this as a session beer any day. It's not the most complex beer, but it's got a solid flavor that stays stable and refreshing until the end. I was pleasantly surprised when I remembered I hadn't poured the entire can, and that it survived warming up handily."
"D - If the aftertaste weren't as off-putting, I'd gladly put down a 4-pack in an hour or two. This would be perfect in the Wrigley bleachers as everything about it screams session. Love the 16oz tallboy cans, and the animal-friendly holders too."
"A great drinker and fairly impressive given the low ABV. I wish the flavor had lived up to the smell, but then it probably wouldn't be as great of a session beer."
"Edit: Just got a low-fill can at the brewery, super fresh. There was a clear grassy hop note to the aroma, and a nice creamy feel also. Seems like they are hitting their stride with this one. Great summer session beer."
"D - Highly drinkable, I'm not a big fan of this style of beer, but it is a pretty good take on it and easy to get down."
"Light bodied and fairly crisp, not too thin, not too full, refreshing."
"Something weird was in the aroma... hiding underneath the hay and grassy hops. I couldn't quite figure it out and it wasn't appealing at first, but then the taste revealed it. Pretty distinctly sourdough bread contributing a little tanginess. Crackers and a little lemon rind. Really pleasant once I figured that out. Some grassy hops in the finish and just supremely drinkable. It really grew on me as I kept refilling my glass. I could drink this all day. Extremely flavorful and palatable for a beer of such small stature. Impressive."
"The mouthfeel is very dry and light without being lifeless. The carbonation is at a high, refreshing level. I'm glad I got to drink a low abv beer that wasn't boring, even in between all the big stuff we were pouring this night. I would kill this growler no problem on my own. This was a good American style session beer, or ""imperial session"" for the English blokes."
"Notes: This beer is probably too hoppy to be considered a bitter or mild, so I guess the brewery defined it as a ""session ale.""  I see it's listed as an American Blonde here, instead of any of those. I just hope they brew more in the warmer months. We need more flavorful low alcohol beers."
"Libation: What can I say? This is an excellent ale. It has all the characteristics of what I'd want a great sessionable lager to be. Clean, drinkable and a complex flavor profile that does not try to assault the palate. It's unfortunate that so little of this was produced, it would be nice to see Half Acre offer this one again. Let's hope they do!"
"Great beer, pours a bright golden hue. Thick, rocky white head. Intensely and pleasantly dry-hopped; not overwhelming. Very little malt in the aroma. Mouthfeel is fresh, satisfying and fufilling but not heavy or crisp, just right. This beer has some legs to it, very enjoyable. Hops stay with you throughout, fruity, citrusy, not dry. Great beer...not surprising from the guys at Half Acre, they're off to a great start. Cheers!"
