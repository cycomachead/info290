The aroma is almost non-existent with a slight funky earthy hops and malt sweetness to it. The taste is little more complex than the aroma. There is a light hint more robust malt on the finish I can't quite identify. The body is a little watery and thin. It's definitely an easy drinker but it just hasn't have much oomph behind it in the flavor department.","delta490","Aug 08, 2014"

3.5,-3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: Overall while i wished the citra hops lasted a bit longer on the nose, this did follow within the guidelines per style of an american blonde. Nice soft dry grain base, bittering more typical per style, but lightly dry, a body that was a bit fuller with a pretty decent rate of drinkability. While not a big fan of Widmers earlier works they do seem to be progressing. Final thoughts, while those might be expecting a big burst of tropical citra hops, this is more focused on traditional style, softly dry bittering, and not meant to be an ipa. Overall pretty decent per style.","beerthulhu","Jul 10, 2014"

3.77,4.4,3.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"My anxious pour netted me just over two fingers of dense, bone-white head with very good retention. Color was a slightly-hazy sunshine yellow (SRM = 4) and I found myself wishing for the return of warmer weather. I just attended my 30-year high school reunion last night and by the end, my feet and right knee caused me to have to sit down. Today, the arthritis in my hands is kicking it. Warmth would be good right about now. The foam fell as I typed, leaving beautiful lacing in its wake. I plan on running the dishwasher later today so it all works out. The jackhammer can remain in the basement as a result. Nose was citrusy, evocative of tangerines or mandarin oranges. Mouthfeel was light, not thin per se, but not big, either. Upon tasting it, I definitely stand behind tangerines in terms of taste. A nice breakfast beer, although I have already eaten breakfast. Finish was semi-dry and this would make an excellent lawnmower beer during the summertime.","woodychandler","Dec 01, 2013"

Not sure if I get citrus from citra; the scent seems more musk to me; I can see why people say ""cat-pee", but it's a smell that is appealing with the hop connotation. The citrus comes in the flavor; tangerine rind, grapefruit pith. The malt backbone seems weak and small, a little water cracker and some white rice. Mouthfeel not quite light lager but still very thin. Carbonation has strong bite, also comparable to light lager levels. An interesting and sessionable beer at only 4.4%, very much a great summer brew.","Aaron_Ramson","Aug 28, 2013"

Lots of carbonation action in the body. Aromas of roasted and grassy hops, dry and peat-like, with a toasted grain backbone. Very aromatic and balanced. Flavors of roasted grains and toasted bread, with a honey sweet highlight. Light, subtle, resiny hops presence that adds piney and floral notes at the end of the palate. The body is light, almost watery at times, with a slight effervescent feel from the carbonation. Grassy and sweet aftertaste, with a clean, crisp finish.

What's left is a not unpleasant herbal bitterness and citrus pith flavor. The clean, dry, softly grainy malt body combined with the Widmer house yeast give the impression of a hybrid between American Pale Ale and Kolsch.

3.97,10,3.5,4,4,4,4,"i really liked this one. it surprised me quite a bit, this is a major step up from the legions of watery summer brews. pours a radiant orange color with a tall white head and some haze. smells fruity and yeasty. fresh oranges for sure, possibly some tangerines in there as well, and a floral hop aroma. taste is sort of similar to new belgium's biere de mars, spicy and refreshing. they citrus flavor is great, not at all bitter, and a perfect complement to the yeast. im very impressed with this beer. the feel works well too, spunky carbonation and a medium body. there is a crispness to this that makes it an excellent warm weather beer, but i think it could be great in all seasons. a winner for sure.","StonedTrippin","Apr 27, 2012"

Smell is delicious with lots of citrus and tropical fruit aromas mixed with a spicy herbal scent. Taste is of the citrus and tropical fruits up front with a solid malty backbone on the finish. Little bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel.

The brew tastes like citrusy (tropical fruit, grapefruit) hops, light floral hops, bready malt and some orange peel. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit creamy, crisp and clean, and is well carbonated. It's also very smooth and easy to drink. At 4.3% ABV, it wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these in a session. It's a good beer for a hot day, I think I might have just found my new summer brew!","bluejacket74","Aug 05, 2011"

Head disperses into a bull's eye dollop and a thin, soapy band around the edges. Nose expresses citrus, grassy notes and a faint, sweet character towards the back. Taste is citrusy, but not very distinct or full-bodied. A slight earthiness comes out towards the back and there are some biscuity notes interspersed with the citrus; however, it all comes off somewhat watery. Mouthfeel is light in body with a prickly, almost gassy, carbonation and a slight acidity that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks and the back of the tongue. I know its only a 4.30% abv, but all and all it's a bit lackluster. Not something I would really care to session.","Jwale73","Aug 01, 2011"

Flavor has more breadiness and malt flavor. Light and watery with a thin mouthfeel. This beer let me down. The aroma was really good but the taste was lacking.

I've tried a dozen or so summer seasonal beers this year and this was my favorite. Very drinkable. I like that the hops are for flavor, not for bittering to any great degree, as I've tried the citra IPA from Widmer and it's pretty harsh, even for an IPA. If you ever wanted to know why they named this hop citra, try this beer, you'll read the bottle wondering if they added orange/lime/lemon, nope.","kpoole25","Jul 02, 2011"
