"I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I got it on tap a bit late for the season, but I thought it to be a good, crisp, tasty brew.  I'd definitely get it again.  It's very smooth going down."

"Overall – Ah… A very lack luster beer. Nothing was all that great.. A rather weak look and very little aroma with the flavors never really find a balance and the body was a bit off for me. Not one I will likely do again."

"Hazy gold appearance, with nice lacing. Floral aromas of yeast, followed by some grain and stone fruits. Good mouth feel, with medium body and nice effervescence. Bone dry taste with a tight, hoppy finish. This is a very solid beer and great for summer session drinking."

" Overall: Not much flavor or discernable qualities"

"Average all the way around."

"Overall, I feel this beer meets all the criteria of an American Blond Ale and many of a Farmhouse Ale as well as they seem similar and in that respect I am going to give it high marks. To add to that, the extreme pleasantness of this beer is also going to get it a great score and I don't see why it has gotten lower scores on Beer Advocate but I am going to give it a solid 4 out of 5."

"Date tasted: July 7, 2013... Glassware: Rare Vos shaker... Occasion: lazy Sunday, post mattress-shopping peace....Appearance: nice golden copper body with subtle effervescence; white sudsy lacing--a good start... Aroma: lemony zest on top of a crisp, clean hop aroma; some lawn mower clippings are hinted at... Palate: medium-bodied, with a presence late at the throat; a pillow-quality body, perfect for this heat... Taste: not much in the way of complexity; grassy notes at the end with some herbal/floral hints--but oddly maltier than a saison usually is... Overall: a low alcohol (4.6 ABV) allows this to be a pleasant pre-lawn mowing brew; the overall experience is within its genre...."

"Pours a clear golden color. White foam forms with good staying power. Aroma of earthy herbs, honey bread and spicy house proprietary yeast. In the taste, more of the same with some lemongrass, peppercorn and bread. Lightly tangy, well balanced, and somewhat light. Had good flavor on a light to medium bodied ale. Well carbonated. Overall, this is a nice session ale."
"O: I'm not sure where the 'farmhouse' term comes from here - the yeast is way too clean/subdued. As a simple blond ale, though, it's okay. I wouldn't pick it up again, though."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and has some thirst-quenching properties. It's definitely sessionable and I would have no problem knocking back a few of these on a summer day. The overall taste is pretty good when compared to other beers in this style."
""
"D : Nothing crazy about this brew, just an easy drinker and very simple."
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are better choices within the style."
"a very clean golden yellow pour with a very minimal amount of head. smells fruity (strawberry), bready, and citrusy (orange/lemon peels). there is a taste of fresh apples up front followed by a slight funky bitterness (from the yeast i assume). light body with high carbonation, still has a creamy feel to it and is very crisp and refreshing. there isn't much in the taste department aside from sweet and fruity, but it's a simple beer like this that i can find myself going back to next year and making it my summer go-to beer (especially with this price tag.. )"

"Pours a murky light orange with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, wheat, yeast, and some spice aromas. Taste is much the same but the flavors are pretty mild overall. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but not something I would seek out again."

"O: An easy drinking summer beer, not really much to it, but it'll get the job done, enjoyable."
""
""
"O: A decent beer, probably not one I would be inclined to grab again though."
""
""
""
"O- As far as ""summer ales"" go, it's not bad. But, as far as farmhouse ales go, it's not very good. One of Flying Fish's less-than-interesting brews."
"When I see farmhouse on a label, I tend to think saison. This is just a drinkable american ale. It works as a lawnmower beer for sure, and is quite nice in that respect, but the name is misleading."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a foamy, long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of pale malt and grassy hops. Body is medium and crisp. Light, grassy, earthy hops and biscuit malt fill the mouth. Sweet malt gives way to drying hops in the finish. Nice brew for a hot summer day."
""
""
"Overall I would call this a winner. This is a good balance of malts, yeast, fruits and hops. I can see myself drinking more of this when the summer arrives and the weather turns hot."

"Overall, a great brew that I have not had in a while and finally got around to tasting. To grainy and sweet for pils crispness, but probably one of the better 'summer' ales."
"Bottle: Poured a bright golden color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention. Aroma consists of lightly sweet malt base with light dry hoppy notes. Taste is also an OK mix between some light dry hoppy notes with a sweet malt base and some very subtle fruity ester. Body is average with good carbonation. Drinks easily though lacks character overall."
"Final Thoughts: Even with the lacking appearance, I would buy this beer anytime. It's perfectly summer to me. It's a sit on the back porch and sip in the summer evening, taking in the smell of sun baked grass and fresh air. Great beer."
"Pours a somewhat hazy golden color with a very white, very foamy head that fades to a cap. Lightly sweet, and lightly funky in the nose. Pleasant. The taste is similar- some nice fruitiness, with notes of red apple and pear as well as some breadiness, a hint of bitterness, and a little bit of funk. Restrained, and very refreshing, but enough interesting flavors to hold your attention. This is in no way an American Blonde Ale, and those looking for such will be disappointed. This, as the label attests, is a classic Belgian farmhouse style ale. Call it a Saison if you will, but not a blonde. I enjoyed it, and suspect that many that didn't are looking for something more mundane."
"O- very easy drinking summer beer, real sessionable too"
"Overall: I'd get this again if I saw it on tap."
" The name suggests a saison but in my opinion it is far from anything Belgium. That said I would recommend this ale and will serve it to friends as a session beer with seafood or as breakfast at the Jersey shore and along the Chesapeake waterways"
"O - Nice beer for the summer, but other than that, nothing else going on here. I can see why it was the special for the night at $2.50 a pint."
"Serving type: bottle and on tap"
"Flying Fish Farmhouse Summer Ale pours a brilliantly clear sunshine yellow. There's a bit of wispy white foam sitting atop the beer, but it vanishes without a trace pretty quickly. The nose has some of grainy sweetness, but almost smells a bit like some corn product was used as an adjunct. There's also a small earthy-noble hop note to the aroma. The flavor is almost identical, same grain, corn, and hoppy points get hit on. Bitterness is pretty much nonexistent mid palate. If anything I'd say the hops are just a touch more present here (to the beer's credit), but it's really not enough of a difference that I can bump taste up to the next score. The body is surpremely light, makes it very drinkable/thirst quenching for the hot weather. The carbonation, if measured in volumes, would probably be a bit on the low side. However, when paired with this thin (and I say that with no negative connotation) body, it definitely pops a little and adds some liveliness. The great mouthfeel makes me wish the flavor profile was a little more fine tuned on Flying Fish's Farmhouse Summer Ale, because I think then it would make close to an ideal summer beer."
"Overall: One of the better American Blondes I have had. Refreshing. Hoppier than many Blondes out there. My rating for this is based on my comparisons in the category. Not necessarily to all beers across the board."
"Yeah, go grab a few more."
"A pretty desent beer spicy and dry. I would like to fry this from a bottle for comparison purposes because I can taste so off flavors I'm sure are tap line related."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. It's a mix of saison and a light summer beer."
"D - I could drink another, but why would I? Not a bad beer at all, just nothing here to hold my attention."
"(12oz bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge). Pours hazy golden color with white head. I thought this might be a saison, but it doesn’t appear to be once I opened it. Aroma has banana, spice and other notes that make this see a bit like a hefeweizen. Maybe a little apricot there as well. Taste is sweet with some bitterness on the end. Pretty well balanced. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Lightly bitter finish. A refreshing and easy-to-drink beer on a hot day (like it is here now)."
"O - Not impressive, but just a deviant of the other summer seasonal craft offerings out there."
"This beer poured out a yellow color that was pretty clear looking. The head was white and faded quickly. The smell was kind of on the weak side, some malts on the nose and just some light fruity notes. The taste is kind of bland, wasn't overly thrilled by the flavor or lack of one. The mouthfeel is very light since its a summer brew. The overall is that I'd probably take something else over this one."
"Aroma is fruity and sweet. Low grainy malt aroma. Somewhat underwhelming. Appearance is golden and hazy. White head fades quickly to a stable thin layer on top of the beer. Sweet grainy malt dominates the flavor. Low hop bitterness just enough to prevent cloying sweetness. Some fruity esters, low citrus and some apple and pear. Body is light and refreshing, with medium-high carbonation. Very drinkable overall. Annoyed by the ""farmhouse"" description, which is usually associated with the Saison style. Good example of an American blond, but not a style I'll return to very often."
"Overall, I have a soft spot for this beer. It's not going to blow anyone away, but it's a refreshing, light, flavorful summer beer. Always enjoyable."
"There were some fruit notes in the taste. I picked up pear and some light spice."
"O: Not nearly as bad as their IPA that I had before it, but still not a fan."
"Overall: I'll be honest, and maybe it's my own fault, but I purchased this assuming I was getting into a saison. The word ""farmhouse"" in the title is generally appealing, the word ""summer"" on the other hand... I've heard saison yeast can be tricky to handle, but I'm somewhat surprised they just copped out with just a standard English ale yeast. At least they did go for a sour mash. So the beer is a tasty blonde, yes, even a very fine ""summery"" beer, but I'd a bit happier if they dropped the word ""farmhouse"" from the label."
"O: This is a light beer that does not have an extreme amount of flavor. However, it is a summer beer. This beer has high drinkability. More to the point, it is an easy to drink beer that still has some nice flavor. There is some fruit, mild biscuit, and crispness from the hops. It is on the drier side, but the hops are not as aggressive as an IPA or even a pilsner. It would be a perfect accompaniment on a hot summer day or with a nice crisp salad."
"A fresh ale that I've seen described as both a blonde ale and a saison. Pours yellow-gold, slightly hazy, with a white head that gets thin rather quickly. Grains and hay in the nose. Grassy with light, floral hops in the taste, and slight tones of light fruits, melons, and the like. Light-medium mouthfeel, and generally pleasant drinkability. Good for a session, but not something I'd go for often."
"Overall - not a bad brew, but not terribly interesting from my tasting point of view. There's a little bit more variety toward the end of the taste, but it would be nice if it were there throughout."
"Not bad, but not good."
"drinkability: nice easy drinking american blonde ale"
"12oz bottle. Pours a cloudy straw color with a thin head. Some lacing. Aromas of yeast, some citrus and slightly sour. Flavor is malty and bready. A bit tart. Having trouble pinpointing what I am tasting. Tastes kind of grainy. Overall this beer is alright. Not really for me but I don't think it is bad. Don't need to have it again."
"Poured a very light golden yellow with a nice white frothy head that faded quickly leaving behind a decent, but shortlived lace ring. Smell was lively, lots of yeast was present even in the aroma, and it was very light. Bread and earthy grains were the predominant aromas. Taste was crisp, light and refreshing, perfect for a summer day. Very smooth and full of bready and earthy grain tones, with a slight hop presence as it warmed. Overall this was excellent for exactly what it was a great summer ale."
"There is a noticeable bubbly, yet smooth feel, and lighter body. Pretty easy drinking, but not incredibly impressive."
"12oz bottle Pours gold with small white head. Aroma of citrus hops, some grassy notes. Taste of light sweet citrus hops, very light malt. Palate is light carbonation. Overall an easy drinking, nice session beer on a hot summer day. A good summer ale."
"This beer took awhile (and a few) to start to get in tune with (it also reminds me much of their Extra Pale Ale). I enjoy it out of a glass and out of the bottle. It's light and crisp and it went well with grilled vegetables. It may not astound but it's worth a try and surely has potential appeal to a wide audience."
"First sip is... a weird corn flavor... doesn't finish too dry. Certainly not like other Saisons that I've had. The label says Farmhouse Summer ale - I call that a Saison and not an American Blonde. No matter what you call it - it is not enjoyable. needs a dryer finish and maybe a nice crisp hop finish. This seems under attenuated and corn flavored. Not a fan."
"D. I thought the flavors were interesting, but this beer was much too thin and flat for my taste. I'll have to try from a bottle/keg when available."
" D- This beer has a very light and lagered flavor to it with no yeast character or depth at all. There were no offensive or off flavors but I don't think I would work at their farm for long."
"And the pain train that is the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender chugs along. This car pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of fast-dying white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light coriander, light lemon zest, graham crackers, orange peel, and some fresh spring flowers. The taste is heavy on the citrus notes (orange peel, lemon zest, a splash of ruby red grapefruit), but they all blend together into a muddled citrus-y mess; coriander, cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg round things out on the tongue. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a decent summertime brew (for those seasonal drinkers among us), nothing altogether special, but tasty enough nonetheless."
"Not terribly impressed by this beer, though I was duped by it not being a saison/farmhouse ale (just ordered it randomly). Appears a light yellow beer with a bit of white head. Smell is faint, some yeast, some lemon, some zing to it, but also a bit of what smells like corn or something. Taste is the same way, crisp, clean, with some lemon, but the corny taste sticks around. It's like a craft version of a macro, if that makes sense. I'm just not a huge fan of blonde ales I guess. Medium to light mouthfeel, decent carbonation. Good drinkability if only because it was light and refreshing."
"Drinkability - Though not enamored on the taste at first, Flying Fish Summer proved to be an interesting and refreshing beer. I enjoyed it with a light dinner of salad and pasta and it was good enough that I had another. Probably one of the best ""summer"" beers that I have had."
"D: Overall, a very solid, easy-drinking beer for hot humid nights in Southeastern PA."
"Medium body with standard carbonation."
"Farmhouse Summer ale is a light beer that doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste like a saison either."
"This beer tastes like vomit. No really, it actually tastes and smells like fresh vomit. That might sound rather harsh, but it's the truth. I STRUGGLED through one of these, hoping at some point my palet would adjust to something that I was missing, but no, it just kept tasting like actual vomit. I don't really know what else to say, when a beer tastes this terrible the appearance and texture don't really matter. Epic failure."
"Light orangish-yellow color with a light haze. Thin foamy head with lively carbonation. Sweet wheat aroma with very light citrus undertones. Light, smooth feel with refreshing carbonation. The wheat character is very dominant, again with very light citrus flavors. Very good, refreshing summer ale."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is slightly sweet, some citrus. Taste is good, hops and grain, well balanced, some citrus. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a quality beer."
"This is my first time having this beer, but it is just plain bad."
"This is from notes I compiled last summer. I poured this into a generic pintglass. Appearance is golden colour with good lacing and good head retention. Smell and taste is a good amount of citrus, grains, spices, malts, hops, and bread. Mouthfeel is refreshingly light to medium bodied, and this is a very drinkable brew for those who like citrus and need a fine lawnmower beer."
"D - Besides the appearance which is really lacking, it's not a bad beer, it just needs some work. The spiciness isn't pronounced or distinguishable, its just there and the malt is the same way. It just needs some more character. Drinkable though as it is. A solid sessioner and refresher for a summer day."
"Had this on tap. This is really more of an American blond ale IMO. It's very good for that style but not so great for a saison, so I'll rate it as a hybrid of sorts. Pours a clear golden color with a fluffy white head and decent lacing. Aroma is wheat, citrus, light spice, and grain. Flavor is wheat, pale malt, grain, citrus, and light fruits. Palate is clean and crisp with fairly light body and medium carbonation. Drinkability is high since this is so light with somewhat mild flavors. Finally, let me say it again: if you're looking for a true-to-style saison, this is not the beer for you. If you just mowed the lawn on a 90 degree day, sure, it'll work."
"In my opinion, the name is VERY deceiving, in that no mention should be made of 'farmhouse' ale; this beer is nothing more than a simple summer beer. The mere implication that it had any of the complexity inherent in a saison/farmhouse got me angry. In that vein, it's drinkability is great on a hot day, the aroma and flavor were lacking, for even that style of beer. Very light-colored and carbonated, but no head. Sorry that this review isn't a little more detailed, but I was very annoyed after my first sniff/taste. If you want a top-notch refreshing ale made by Flying Fish to drink in the summertime, rush out and get some limited edition Exit 11 (American Wheat Ale) before it's all gone...it's outstanding, and puts this so-called 'farmhouse ale' to shame."
"I thought this was a summer beer and not a farmhouse ale. I liked it when I had it and now see why it was more interesting than I expected. Very light color, average smell, ok taste but as a regular summer beer. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good and worth getting if you're hot and thirsty."
"I found this beer to be one of the easiest-drinking beers I've ever had. Now, my review is flawed because I don't believe I have any other Saison/Farmhouse Ales to compare it to - this is my first. But from the description of the style, I expected something a bit more complex in flavor, and this was not complex at all. Low ABV combined with a mellow flavor equals very easy drinkability. For an every day Summer beer, I'd choose this hands down over the BMC beers; unfortunately this runs $32 a case, so it could be come an expensive habit. I may have to just fit it in here and there over the summer."
"Overall a nice drinkable farmhouse ale that carries a nice hop bite to it. Very satisfying and refreshing. I would drink anytime during the summer, I really enjoyed it."
"On tap. Pours clear gold with a small, fizzy white head that disappears instantly and leaves no trace. Smells incredibly faint; light malt with some light fruit. A bit floral, but that's a reach. Tastes of tangy wheat and sugary sweetness. Little/no hop presence, save for a hint at the finish. Light, fizzy feel. This doesn't even bare a passing resemblance to a proper saison; on top of that, it's too sweet to enjoy."
"this is a good farmhouse summer ale ,easy to drink during thoughs hot days,well worth buying again."
"D:A nice hot weather session saison and an interesting one because of the filtration process. Under 5% and enough flavor to hold up with a light lunch or sitting in a coller by the pool."
"D - Overall, I feel it is kind of low. It isn't offensive, just not quite as drinkable as some of the other domestic and imported varieties I've had."
"Definitely did not have any of the high points I associate with a saison--much more of an american pale ale, but average for that style. Wouldn't seek it out but might recommend it to friends who like light quaffable ales."
"D: Says it's a quenching summer beer, can't say I disagree. Nothing outrageous here, but fine for what it aims for."
"Nothing too spectacular here."
"Would drink it over most domestics, but nothing to get excited over"
"M/D-A fizzy/dry mouthfeel and an easy drink. Not my favorite beer in the world, but I'd suggest that anyone give this one a try if you have the opportunity."
"Much lighter body than expected for the style, but still smooth, pretty easy to drink. Overall, the score probably suffered a little due to when I was drinking it, I thought it was a pale ale or a pale wheat ale., but overall, not a bad beer, I would probably order again."
"highly drinkable with a thin mouthfeel and almost sour apple taste...very refreshing and could easily put away a few of these in one sitting...excellent summer beer to kill some time with"
"Mouthfeel is a little watered down, light but clean. Not a great farmhouse, but not aweful"
"The beer is very drinkable - could easily go through several in a night. A good refreshing beer for a hot summer day. You can certainly tell the difference with this being filtered. I prefer the unfiltered offerings of this beer style (Hennepin is the best) - but this is good as a different take on it."
"At 4.6% ABV, the mild and refreshing flavor makes this a great choice for a session beer. The apple taste might get to me after awhile, and it's not much to look at, but this is an easy drinker."
"Drinkability: This is surprisingly easy to drink. I could down several if I wanted a mildly favored beer to have several pints."
"D: A light drinking summer that goes down with barely a second thought. Worthy of a try."
"This isn't the best saison/farmhouse style ale. However, it is very complex, and a nice change from other summer seasonals. And clocking in at a sessionable abv, I can't find anything to complain about."
"Pours a nice golden copper with a nice retaining head. Smell is floral, hoppy and grainy. Drinks crisply and smoothly, not quite with a snap, but almost. Hints of coriander, lemon and orange abound, but neither are in the spotlight. Low in alchohol means that this is a quality summertime picnic beer that you'll empty quite quickly."
"M/D - this one is very drinkable but not necessarily in a good way. It wasn't overwhelming in taste so you could drink many and not be overpowered."
"Overall - Very watery and the flavor is very weak."
"I thought it would have lost a ton of flavor and character being filtered and such but this ended up being a pretty solid Farmhouse Ale. On the light side but it makes up for that with its superb drinkability."
"D - Easy drinking and enjoyable... A very good sessionable beer... A slight departure from the typical summer brew, which is greatly appreciated..."
"Nothing great, nothing bad about this beer. Definitely a session beer that one could put away without thinking about it. Very drinkable & easy to reach for another sip."
"d: This was okay overall, just a bit bland."
"D/O: Drinkability is quite good for this beer, despite its flaws and straying from a true Saison. My summer party guests enjoyed it immensely, but I was let down with the bottled version after having had it on tap during Philly Beer Week. My recollections were of a beer that had much more crispness, sweetness, and bite. What came in the bottle was just a bit simple for my tastes. I'm hoping I just got a bad run, and I'll probably give this another try next summer."
"I'd call this beer a small saison as the body and flavor are considerably lighter than the heavy hitters of the saison style. Still it has a pleasant and crisp body with mild biscuit malts and a smattering of hops and Belgian spice. A simple but tasty summer beer. I'd take this over Sam Adams Summer Ale on a hot day."
"Flying Fish summer ale...not too much to say. Tastes like Sam Adams Summer Ale (not a compliment) Pours a pale yellow that screams ALE! The appearance is not pleasing and there is almost no head on the beer. I can't say it doesn't taste good; it does. It is a refreshing summer beer. Flying Fish could do much better and should. From a company that puts out quality beer, the bar needs to be upped for an ale."
"Light, crisp, refreshing with a husky grain flavor and citrus hop bitterness. Not quite as lemony as some other summer beers. A subtle coriander spice is present, along with a somewhat bitter finish. Overall a really nice, drinkable summer beer."
"The beer is clear golden with a decent white head. Very light in the aroma with some wafting grain huskiness and hops. Very light on the palate with a light flavor. Grainy, slightly acidic, with slight bitterness at the end. Light and refreshing. Almost too light. I find little resemblance to traditional saisons, so I am not sure why they use the Farmhouse Ale moniker."
"It pours absolutely beautiful - light yellow with a vast, enduring billowy head that dissolves slowly to tremendous lacing. It has, however, almost no aroma, the main flaw for this beer. The flavor is lemony and slightly (and pleasantly) sour with a little hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin and refreshing. This is a highly drinkable, if somewhat unusual, summer session beer"
"D: A bit watery but fresh tasting. Doesn't quite satisfy like I was hoping it would. Drinkable but could be improved."
"Overall-A very dissapointing beer that I will never purchase again. I was also not pleased to see this was contract brewed at Matt's Brewing."
"The beer pours a yellowish gold color with pretty persistent head retention and modest lacing. The nose is pretty close to non-existent, with none of the spice and/or funk one would normally associate with a Belgium saison. If anything I get a very light aroma of hoppy bitterness. On the palate this beer is very light and crisp. I guess one might call it refreshing, except that it's so light, watery and insipid, I really had no interest in finishing off my 10 ounce glass of the stuff. While I give Flying Fish points for keeping the abv. down, in this case they clearly did so at the expense of having much flavor. At least IMO, this is not a beer that would hold any interest for me in the future."
"Certainly not the best depiction of the style..."
"M & D- Mouthfeel is carbonated & bubbly but thin, & thickens as it warms. This beer would be nice to drink on a hot summer day, especially when it's cold. As it warms, it becomes an okay sipping beer. Not bad, but didn't blow me away. It was my first rating of a Farmhouse so I'm eager to see what else is out there in this style."
"Pours a clear gold. Crème head. Nose is bland. Flavor is bitter. No saison qualities at all. Basically tastes like a metallic toned lager. Massive metallic aftertaste. Feel is not saison like at all. Thin and watery on the liquid. If this is a saison, then I have three feet. A complete miss of the mark (IMO) that holds no qualities that the well known saisons do. I didn't enjoy it at all and ended up dumping the majority of it."
"Golden colored ale with a malt aroma to it.Taste is malt maybe a bit of wheat and a smidge of citrus.There is nothing remarkable or offensive in this ale.It's fresh,smooth and drinkable.A perfect beer for a hot humid day!!I will buy again only on the warm weather months though."
"An easy drinking brew, not hard to take with a relatively low ABV."
"Poured a clear gold color with minimal head that left very little lacing. Aroma is generally weak but pleasant, a pleasant funkiness dominates with some wheat, corn, yeast and just a bit of fruitiness. Taste is like the smell in that it is also fairly weak. A bit spicy at first with a wheat backbone. Between the initial taste and the finish there is a bit of dead space, all I can really detect here is a light wheat flavor. The finish is a mix of bitterness from the hops and a bit of that typical farmhouse funkiness. Mouthfeel is, well, average at best. Despite the lack of a head this brew seems moderately carbonated with a light-medium body that is certainly more towards the light end of the spectrum. Drinkability is pretty good. It's crisp and fairly refreshing but a little subdued for my tastes. I think I'd like this brew better if the flavors and aromas were more assertive."
"Recommended."
"Drinkability: Refreshing hot weather alternative with a balanced malt, fruity and slightly herbaceous character; it is a real stretch to consider this among other saisons, however; enjoy it for what it is"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Some carbonation bite. Clean on the palate, drinkable. No overwhelming flavors here, yet enough to keep you interested. Very sessionable brew."
"That said, I can't see myself spending money on this one again; but it's cheap, pretty well-crafted, and extremely drinkable."
"This saison is at the very lightest end of the spectrum for the style. It's easily drinkable, but really lacks the depth and complexity of a true saison. Lawnmower beer."
"A very light Saison, I prefer the stronger versions. It is drinkable but light for the style."
"I bought a case of this brew after trying one in Lakewood, NJ on a business trip. They have a great logo and an attractive label. There was no freshness date to be found anywhere on the bottle. This is a very tasty and enjoyable beer. It poured a clean and clear golden yellow to golden orange color. Very clear and golden yellow when back lit. There was almost perfect carbonation bubbling up from the bottom. Nice two finger head with a rough pour. There is a strong lacing down the glass and nice head retention. It still had at least a quarter inch of head 3/4 of the way down the glass. Smell is light and airy with a slight hint of spice. It certainly has some pale malt and a dough like scent mixed in the nose. Perhaps some mild clove and some sweetness as well maybe some pineapple and banana tones. There is a slight tang or sour note in there too. The taste is smooth and very easy to drink. There is a taste of pale malt with a nice dry flavor in the beginning of the taste. No real sweetness found on the pallet. The dryness gives way to a nice spice flavor with some slight bitterness. Subtle hop oil lingers in the back ground. The finish also lends itself toward the dry side. Very nice mouth feel and a great taste. I wish I could find this beer further north but I think it pretty much stays in NJ. I have found another great summer treat and it certainly fits in my book as a great session brew. Nice offering from Flying Fish and I would seek this brew out again for sure."
"Smooth mouthfeel is followed by a blast of sweet orange citrus and a touch of bubblegum. Finish is dry and slightly herbal. This is a decent beer, but not a saison.	 Lacking in complexity, and funkiness that I've come to expect in my saisons."
"D- A refreshing summer ale, not really like other Saison beers I've had, but a decent warm weather drink."
"Overall an easy drinking saison. A very toned down specimen in my opinion."
"This beer was pretty good overall. A light golden color body - kind of reminded me of white grape juice - with no head but a decent lacing. Not too much of a discernable smell; hints of malts were evident. The taste was pretty crisp with nice, malty undertones that made the beer appear to be really light. The mouthfeel was pretty average; a little on the thin side, but good for a Saison. The beer, overall, is pretty light and surprisingly refreshing. Definitely a good call on a hot summer day when your only other alternative is a past dated winter warmer. I definitely will be drinking this beer as the late spring and summer months approach."
"Beer pours golden in color, bubbles quickly and constantly flowing to the top. Mild aroma, primarily malt and a little hoppy. Taste is definitely malty, and heavily carbonated. The carbonation takes away from any real discernable flavor, although there is a hint of hop flavor in there. Very dry aftertaste, but I can see this as a very easy beer to drink on a hot afternoon."
"On-tap into a pint glass. Pours a light yellow/straw, slightly foggy color. No real head, no lacing. Nose is nice, light and crisp hops with a little hint of malt. Nothing overwhelming, but tasty. Taste is a little weak; crisp but not strong, a little floral hops and some quiet malt. Feel is standard, good carbonation. Drinkability is okay. It's an alright beer, certainly not a good saison (I didn't even realize it was supposed to be this style while drinking it), but not one I would necessarily throw out either."
"Poured out a nice golden color with a big lacing off white head. The nose offered floral hops, some citrus, and tineiest amount of spice, nearly non-existent. This drinks very easy, again with floral hops leading the way, some bitterness, tiny amount of malt, and not much else. A crisp mouthfeel, and some bitter hops lingering on the palate. Not what I'm looking for out of a Saison styled beer, but on it's own, a decent easy drinking beer."
"Cheers!"
"My first impression of this beer was that it was just another cheap macro brew. All of the constituent elements were there; dry ashy yeast, corn, fruity sourness. But then I realized that these flavors were really well put together. The way the flavors played off of each other was what I had been wishing your average BMC swill tasted like. I could be silly and call it the grand-high emperor of BMC. Seriously though, this was really well done for what it is and really easy to drink. As far as Saisons go, I've had better, but this beer's originality really impressed me."
"Pours a clear golden color with a foamy head that didn't stick around too long. Not much of an aroma...grassy hints, but that's about it. Some wheat notes in the taste, but other than that, almost too light. It's drinkable in the sense that it goes down smooth, but don't expect anything special - it's not bad, just a very bland summer ale."
"Drinkability is alright. I know FF keeps this drinkable for the masses. One of my old neighbors knew I was heavily into craft brews and she brought me up a few bottles a couple of years ago. She described it like a lighter hefe weizen. She didn't know much about beer but something prompted her to buy a case of it. To me, this would be more of an American Ale than a Saison. Fellas need to make money though. Maybe we could get a Farmhouse ""Roots"" version of FF sometime soon in the big corked/caged bottles where they use the same recipe but a Saison yeast."
"The taste has some lemony bitterness up front from the hops followed by a good sweet malt presence with some biscuit flavour. The finish is quite dry. Unusual tasting beer and I'm glad I got to try it thanks to jwc215."
"This was a decent if uninspiring brew. Doesn't do much on the nose, and the taste is a bit thin. It is highly drinkable though, with a bit of a lemony flavor. It goes down easy on a hot day, which is the point of a summer ale I suppose. Not sure it's really much of a saison but it's not bad for what it is."
" Once I have more of Flying Fish's offerings, I could possibly pinpoint a trend or two among it's portfolio of beers. There wasn't anything wrong or unenjoyable about this, but this is not the beer one should delve into when learning about saison's. For the summer or a hot afternoon, it'll hold up alright...but I would love to see this redone for next year, more true to form."
"The body is a clear brown-yellow, with little head, just a ring. Nose is nothing more than a little grain. Tastes of light grain, citrus, possibly a wheat twang, and various spices I can't ID. The mouthfeel is medium and tingly from the high carbonation. This beer is refreshing, but too light and simple."
"Overall - bland. What smoothness there was came more from thinness than anything else. While not awful, and I had two or three and will be able to eventually finish the 6-pack (or find someone to help me do so), its blandness and aftertaste would not have me choose this again for a summer brew. Not satisfying."
"Smooth, even if spicy. Great drinking, good character, not a bad stab at a saison in the least. Not bad at all."
"Had this on tap at Antone's. It was served in a shaker pint glass. Kind of ruins the affect. Since the name says Farmhouse, I had expected a typical saison. I didn;t get it. Not much in the way of a typical saison aroma - not much yeast, or grass, or spiceness. I read one review that called in a blond ale. Kind of a plain beer.Not a good example of a saison, but it is a beer one could drink during a summer afternoon."
"Drinkability: The beer has a decent drinkability with no true flaws. I might have scored it higher if it was marketed as a blond ale. It clearly did not have the characteristics of a Saison and was not stylistically close to anything like Hennepin or Saison Dupont. I actually asked the waiter if he accidentally brought me some other beer because I was expecting so much more."
"The color of this beer was clear gold, with a small white head that quickly disappeared. There was some lemon in the smell with a slight spiciness, but all the smells were very faint. The flavor is dominated by peppery spice with a hint of lemon tartness with decent malt sweetness in the background. The mouthfeel is biting from the carbonation and the spiciness. Overall this is an ok beer, sour and spicy and refreshing."
"Overall this is not a good saison but more of a average pale ale. I've tried this brew with several types of foods. Nothing seems to bring out any flavors. With that said, this is a drinkable brew."
"Overall a pretty good beer, and one I would love to have when the hot weather returns."
"Pleasant darker golden color. Lots of malt in the nose. The taste is pretty solid. At first sip it seems like it is going to be too carbonated, but it smooths out considerably at the finish. The saison yeast is less noticeable in this beer than in other saisons I have had. To me, that's a good thing. A nicely crisp and refreshing beer. I would like to try it again next summer."
"poured a slightly hazy, medium amber color with magnificient white puffy head that was easily revived with a light swirl. Smell is very mild with some fruitiness (citrus) and a bit of spiciness. Taste is a good combination of a hoppy bitterness, fruity malt, and nice background spiciness. Finish is very light and dry. A very easy to drink beer that would bewonderful on a warm spring day."
"Pours a nice looking golden yellow with a large frothy white head and a little lacing. Nose is a very faint floral note with a slight bit of lemon. Taste is a slightly sweet lemony malt with balanced by a small dose of floral hops. This doesn't have any of the spiciness or the slight tartness I've come to expect of saisons. Mouthfeel is thin and very carbonated. This is a rather mediocre offering that isn't a good example of the style at all."
"Super carbonated. Whole lot of head. Color was a pale, pale yellow--perhaps even lighter than some pilsners. Nose was odd--malts with an attempt at spices but such a menagerie of spices I cannot even begin to place them. In terms of taste, I am not sure whether this is truly a saison. Very light and crisp with somewhat of a dry finish. Also, like the aroma the flavor is so mushed togeterh I cannot honestly place much of anything other than some slightly sweet malts and a light layer of bittering hops. There is some other flavors present, but they are so blended into each other I cannot place them. For me... just not a very interesting beer."
"Bottle is the standard 12-oz. brown bottle with no freshness date or any other information. I like labels to be a little more informative."
"Pours a goldened straw color with a 3 finger head taht falls to a light coating over top. The nose is peppery spice, overlaying a light sweet and lemoney base. I can't put my finger on the sweetness. Its somewhat floral. The flavor is a little light comparted to the nose. The lemoney floral component is most dominant with the light peppery spice playing second string. I get a light metallic twinge on the finish. The feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. Maybe a touch too thick for me. I'd like a litte drying on the finish too. The drinkability is very good. Its a refreshing and crisp brew. The flavor is nice. No real flaws, just lacking anything to make it stand out."
"Overall-a rather lightweight version of the Saison from Flying Fish but it's a nice lazy summer brew to kick back on and it's so easygoing that it's hard to be dissapointed. Decent brew."
"Spicy and refreshing, but not really that substantial. Still, a very solid example of the style and another decent brew from Flying Fish. Recommended."
"Pours a pale. straw-yellow color with a big white head that leaces nice lacing down the glass. Smell is an earthy, grassy straw smell with a hint of spiciness like corriander or clove. The taste is grassy and straw-like malt with a cloying spiciness from maybe saaz hops that has hints of corrainder. A pretty basic saison, but a good summertime brew thats crisp and refreshing, but nothing extraordinary or exciting."
"Drinkability: Would be a good beer to accompany a greek or italian meal"
"Nose was nice & inviting. Crisp, citrus tones pulled you in. Initial the play is even with malts & hops, then the hops reign and invite the citrus currents to dance on the pallete. The brew continues to build and peak on the throat with sharper tones and hops, swallowing very clean and crisp with a likewise aftertaste. An excellent summer brew that would pair nicely with a variety of foods, I would definitely recommend it as a early session offering or with lunch/dinner or by its lonesome."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The one thing I didn't like as much, the overly alive feeling in the mouth, is the thing that goes along with the zesty flavor to make this one very drinkable beer. A little bit of a dichotomy there, but one that benefits it when it comes time to choose which beer to drink. This is absolutely a great lawnmower beer. But, I think the cask has something to do with that, as the bottle is not in this league. A shame, really, that I can't keep a cask on my deck for after my yardwork."
"This in no way stands up to any of the Saisons coming out of Belgium. My advice to this brewer is to leave it to the Belgian's to do what they do best, and that is brew great beer. This had hardly any flavor to it, and what was there was straw and corn, no good farmhouse flavors in any way, and no old world quality to it. Not good."
"Drinkability is solid. Again heavy end of style, very intersting but not distinctive."
"Pours a very pale gold with minimal head. Aroma is of citrus and a bit of wheat notes. Taste is smooth. Not really a saison in my opinion. Wheat beer clove and spice notes with citrus. Nice hop finish at the end. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Overall this is a very easy drinking beer. Would make a nice session beer in the summer. Not really to style as it lacks the funkiness of a true saison."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pale malt scent that is fruity to the nose and has hints of wheat. There seems to be a bit of spice as well; very nice. The taste is good also. It has a grainy pale malt flavor that boasts also of wheat and a fruity yeast finish. It goes down with ease and finishes a bit tart and fruity. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine saison. It's not the best I've tried, but it drinks well."
"Nice deep golden color with a nice 1/4 inch head atop it.Malty aroma-not as much as I remember when I first had this a few years back.The overwhelming ""earthiness"" and ""bready"" qualities that I loved in it are gone as well. Great malty flavor with a slight hop bitterness.Some very nice residual yeastiness in the backround .Very smooth on the palate-nicely built for only a 4.6% beer.I could seriously drink this all night no matter what the season. Its pretty far from a saison for sure but on its own merits its quite the excellent brew."
"This was served from the tap as a light yellow color with very little head. There was a citrus scent to the the nose and a definite lemon flavor in the mouth. It had a dry mouthfell, which enhanced its drinkability, since each swallow left me thirsty for another. The lemon flavor continued to linger after the finish, which makes this a good choice as a summer seasonal."
"It feels thin in the mouth but is cleansing. I had one and said enough."
"Drinkability/Noes: Nice, but nothing outstanding. Would I have a couple? Yes, but there needs to be something here that isnt. Expected a little more out of the Flying Fish folks. Additionally, I was disappointed with the presentation. The label was very generic. I was forced to buy it from a questionable place, and would have like some sort of freshness label, or at least a year. (Same place had very old winter warmer sitting in the sun at full price.)"
"Poured from the tap, clear and golden with no head. Nice citrus and grainy scent. Very balanced and clean with hoppy overtones. Have been on a brewery tour at Flying Fish and know their process to be heavily filtered and highly refined, this shows through alot in this brew. Very nice drinkability, great session beer."
"Features a barely off-white head, clear brassy/golden liquid. Lager-like maltiness and lightly fruity nose. Flavors of biscuity chewy malt mix with a pleasant yeasty fruitiness then flowery hoppy bitterness rounds things out just right. Lively carbonation on the tongue. Finishes bitter with some dryness on the palate. A great session ale due to it's low alcohol content."
"Overall- Too weak, too watery, and what little taste wasn't that pleasant. Not horrible but not worth drinking. My summer won't be wasted on this. Sorry Flying Fish!!"
"Golden color with large head, quickly subsiding and leaving suggestions of ringed lace. Mostly clear, with some sediment chunking. Aroma is somewhat indistinct and hardly noticeable, with wheat and citrusy hops somewhere in there. Body is light, with medium carbonation, feels good and fitting. Sweetness up front, not that of malt, with orange sweetness developing on the way down. Clean finish. Not too much character here, but very refreshing and easy to drink."
"A very good summer beer which is somewhere between gold and amber. A ok head but a nice lace that made up for it. A good smell. The taste has a nice spiciness to it, aking to their Grand Cru. This is pretty much a lighter, more drinkable version of that. They don't seem to be using the same yeast strain which produced all those zesty esters in the Grand Cru. This is refreshing and well worth a try."
"Tasted at the 2003 Oregon Brewers Fest. Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is malty, fruity and slightly herbal. Touch of must. A medium bodied sassion (? ) Malts are fruity and mild. Hops are slightly spicy. Light and refreshing. Nice mild flavors. Well balanced. Light and refreshing this would make a great summer session beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"This beer is a pale gold/yellow color and is mildly bubbly. Thin off-white head that did not last. The aroma is wheaty and vaguely spiced. Light and crisp with a nice hops presence along with more spice and a little citrus. The finish is a little on the sweet side but has a small hops bite to it. Kudos to Flying Fish for actually making a Summer Ale with some flavor other than lemon."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this offering. Delicate at times, but very accomplished. Thanks to NeroFiddled for the sample."
"light carbonation, crispness, low sweetness, and excellent clarity (slight chill haze). I liked it more than I would have if they had rigorously nailed the Saison style. Great to have while cooking and eating some barbecued chicken."
"A day-to-day saison? To me, it was what a lager should taste like but with more raw flavors of course. Drinkable, but not the glory of a Dupont or Hennepin."
"Overall Impression: A great saison. Usually a hit or miss in the US. This is the first beer I've tried from this brewery. Probably my favorite of the 19 I tried at the festival. If the rest of FFB's beers are this good..."
"A light, yellowish colored ale that a pour develops a slight head. Not one of the better looking beers, but it is extremely drinkable as light citrus and wheat flavors are well balanced. Little to no aftertaste. More than one can be quaffed without getting bored. This ale has become one of my summertime staples in the refridgerator based on taste and reasonable price."
"another above average/good offering from flying fish. still haven't seen them achieve greatness yet, but they are a solid brewery overall. pours a hazy yellow/gold witha surprisingly strong head which dissolves rather quicjly leaving a bit of lace throughout. just the right amount of carbonation here, i thought. smells mainly of citrus but hints of spice come out as well. the spices are a bit more pronounced in the flavour, but citrus still dominates here, along with the expected wheatiness of a summer brew. again, not a bad brew overall. i'd say it's a middle of the road summer micro. pretty straightforward, nothing daring."
"Tasted: 07/03/03"
"Pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head that lasts. Aroma is citrusy with a hint of spiciness. The taste is citrusy, but not much from the yeast which is what I was looking for. It's very light and refreshing making this a highly drinkable wheat beer,"
"Translucent yellow hue, wispy white head, thin, quick to collapse to a soapy residue far from visually appealing. No lace. The nose is lean with soft lemon hints, wheat (maybe?), floral and grassy influences the aroma is apathetic. Light palate, with lovely hints of spice, pepper, lemon, grass, hay the finish is slightly dry very refreshing! Minimal aftertaste. It is most worthy of its summer ale moniker most enjoyable to quaff. Medium-light body, ideal low carbonation, smooth and easy to drink what a session beer this one would make. This beer has a niche Id love to imbibe in this one again."
"Poured a light yellow color with lighter head than what I expected,aroma was pretty spicey along with some powdered sugar notes.Taste was nicely balanced with some spicey notes with a nice light malty ending.Nice and refreshing and very drinkable,would buy again."
"A summer beer with some character...not a chugging beer..one to be studied and savored...relatively clear golden in color with a nice creamy white head that laces the glass nicely....Nose reminds me a little of a Whit Beer...some definte wheat notes on the nose but also a spicy hop accent...great aroma...body is light but not thin...pretty charged up too...taste isn't as nice as the nose but is still interesting and enjoyable...spicy characteristics take control of the taste...herbal like...also some lemon notes...malt is in the background but mixes in to offer some balance to the spiciness....overall this is definitely an interesting beer worth a try.."
"Had a pleasant grassy hop aroma. This was much creamier, smoother and had more body than the regular draft version. Very flavorful. An excellent summer sipper."
"This has pretty much all the flavors of a good summer ale, making me yearn for some warmer weather. Lemon, wheat, and a light maltiness culminate in a slightly bitter hop finish. This is a refreshing brew, is easy to drink, and ranks high on the drinkability scale. It will be nice to have a few of these once things warm up!"
"She did good."
"Hazy, light yellowish-gold body with a bright white head that seems to want to rise out of the glass - very highly effervescent. The flumes of quick-rising, tiny bubbles add to the appearance. The head is big-bubbled at first, but holds well and leaves some very good lace. After the initial pour has settled, the bubbles become smaller. The aroma is interesting: citrus - mainly lemony, a gentle peppery spiciness, some herbal & grassy notes, very soft summer fruit - crushed raspberry, perhaps?, and a very slight acetic note. The body is light with a highly effervescent carbonation that gives a zesty mouthfeel and makes the beer appear bigger than it is. The flavor offers a gentle malt sweetness that's well balanced by hop bitterness, a light spiciness, and the bite of the CO2. It finishes with a mouth-coating citrusy malt that lingers for some time, and some residual pockets of bitterness. Light but interesting, with some very nice character. Refreshing and enjoyable. Well done. With the addition of some yeast characteristics, this could be exceptionally nice."
"Pale yellow body with some carbonation. Thin white head. A lot going on in the nose: lemon, spices, grass, a hint of other fruit, and a slight sour tang, especially when opening the bottle. For all in the nose, it's light on the tongue, then a long lingering  wheat/citrus aftertaste, which detracts from its refreshing qualities. OK, but not that high on my summer drinking list."
"1/6 keg in my beermeister.  Very clear yellow look with lots of tiny bubbles.  It has a rich sticky rocky white head.  Freash hop nose with touches of lemon and yeast.  Slight toasted malt flavor with a well rounded hop finish with a slight touch of lemon zest.  Very clean hop finish.  Cleaner and crisper and a little lighter than the bottle version (fresher).  Very drinkable with its taste and its lasting head and lace.  Without question a solid summer draft selection."
"All in all not a bad summer brew, but I have had better.  A light, malty brew with some honts of spice and wheat.  Well worth seeking out for a change-of-pace and drinkable summer brew.  Prost!"
"Overall, a very good summer beer.  Slight Floral, fruity aroma.  Head doesn't last very long, but the beer seemed well carbonated.  Mildly hoppy.  Refreshing and enjoyable."
"The beer is a very clear light golden with carbonation evident. Head is insignificant.  A nice light malty aroma tainted with hints of lemon.  This is a really nice tasting brew.  I rarely sampled from this style, but this one is enjoyable.  Light body.  Very easy drinking.  Nice subtle maltiness (seems like a pils malt). A nice little hop bite that adds to the overall experience.  No overbearing or complex tastes, but for the style and what little I know of the style, this seems pretty good.  To me, a bit similar to a good kolsch."
