"I am not a fan of coffee flavor. It tastes like a mocha drink. Most who are into that style of flavor would probably love it though. It's just not my thing."

"Poured from bottle to pint glass. Pale, pale yellow with a little head. No lacing. Smells of coffee and cream, slight bitterness, roasted sweet caramel. Taste follows, sweet coffee with a tiny bite on the end. Mouthfeel is thin, could be a perception thing since I was expecting something thicker to go along with the coffee flavor. Little to no aftertaste."
"Just an odd flavor combination for me. Blonde ale and coffee...blah!"
"What I imagine a coffee enema tastes like."
"The coffee aroma is Divine. Smell of delicious coffee and vanilla. Taste is a bit messy. Pretty solid for a coffee blonde though"

"Odd side coffee taste.  Ok but not a repeat."

"Artificially flavored coffee and caramel added to water.  Nice attempt but lets be real, there is no complexity to this beer."

"Coffee forward on a light-bodied blonde"

"I was made to try this with my eyes closed and guess the color. Yep got it wrong. Love the light coffee flavor and crispness of the blonde. My palate isnt so sophisticated, but this tastes deliciously.... delicate? Im not sure but I enjoy this beer."
""
"Lots of vanilla flavor. Some coffee and a little chocolate. As someone else said, little carbonation which is ok with me. Smooth and drinkable but probably not a regular go to beer for me given the intensity of the vanilla flavor. But, a refreshing change of pace!"

"Tastes like cream soda with a coffee aftertaste."

"The body was medium to light with modest carbonation."
""

"O: One word: unique. Flavors make this interesting. Billed as a blonde ale with coffee...its a misleading label. This is a blond ale hidden within a mocha. Tone down the chocolates, turn up the coffee, but not too much letting the blonde come through, this might be a really interesting beer."
""
""
""
"I really enjoy the long-boarder porter made with coffee and this is the blond ale version. It is fantastic and they have mastered the coffee flavor but without compromising the taste of the beer. Because of the smell and mouthful was more like that of a cream ale instead of a blond ale i rated it a bit low, this doesn't take away the fact that the texture of the flavor is Superb!"

"Very interesting and a delightful surprisingly good beer! I wasn't sure what to expect, but decided to try it because it wasn't like anything I had tried before. I could taste some vanilla, and the coffee flavor is detectable, but not at all overpowering."

"Overall- Weird beer. As per the brewery, this is certainly odd and different than anything else I've ever had. I don't think I've even had a blonde with coffee added before, period. Otherwise forgettable."

"i would drink this often if i could for sure."

"I was perplexed when I saw a coffee infused blonde ale but at the same time exhilarated to try it...damn glad I did. This ale pours a golden hue with little white head and virtually no lacing. The nose reminds me of hot chocolate. Not a lot of coffee notes just a subtle sweet chocolaty smell. There's a lot of malt here as well and a bit of hops to round it out. This offering sips very light and smooth. The flavor is much more complex than I had ever expected. It is sweet and reminiscent of iced mocha at first but followed by a nice hoppy bitterness all to resolve with a sweet malty chocolate finish. This is a delicious and surprisingly complex beer. Nothing like what I expected but very refreshing and enjoyable. Would gladly buy this one again."

"I assumed something so dark, roasty and powerful as coffee would overwhelm a style that is clean, neutral, and light but I was amazingly wrong. Who'd have thought that a pale, easy-drinking and approachable beer could retain those qualities amongst such an appreciable coffee presence? Oddside Ales you are indeed very odd - but also clever and talented."
""
""
"O - This is an interesting beer that I will more than likely revisit. I like the coffee flavor in a lighter beer. I think this would be a great alternative to a coffee stout in the summer when I am craving the coffee flavor but want a light bodied beer."
""
"Pours a clear yellow-orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, earth, and slight coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with vanilla and coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the coffee aspect doesn't really work all that well with the base beer in my opinion."
""
""
"O - It was worth trying and an interesting attempt at a unique beer. Somehow the flavors do not mesh right and leaves the beer without any great qualities. Perhaps the recipe can be tweaked to make it blend better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Great beer. Unique aroma i'm getting, very difficult to describe. No astringency, amazing coffee. Weird vegetal flavor, green coffee beans? Definitely a must try, even if you don't like coffee and the usual espresso stouts."
""
""
"An interesting take on a typical blonde ale, with an unmistakable coffee. Other than that, this is your typical unproposessing blonde, with guzzle-down drinkabilty traded off for any sort of body. This is photoshopped supermodel-thin. Still, I enjoyed it. An above average and unique blonde ale. That may not be saying a ton, but one of the better blondes out there."
""
"O - Is it a lager, is it a stout? What is this concoction? I applaud the brewer for creativity, but the lack of identity makes this more of a novelty. I'd try it again, but I will not seek it out."
""
"Good mouthfeel and easy drinking, this would make for an excellent breakfast beer for those folks in Odd Sides' distro area. 4.5% abv..you got the right idea!"
""
""

"Bean Flicker is another interesting beer from Odd Sides. I can't say I'm a huge fan but the concept is fun and unique and certainly worth a try. The nose and flavor are both comforting until I get those strange notes of rubber. If the rubber wasn't present this would be a much better beer."
""

""
""
"Not sure if it's the influence of the night's prior selection, but this brew seems extremely chocolatey, rather than coffee dominant, which suits my palate well. The base beer is an afterthought. If it weren't for the off flavors(due to the base beer), this would really do well."
""
"This is an interesting brew. It goes down nicer than I thought, but the flavor is mostly artificial. Despite it, it's well balanced and easy to drink. I would buy it again."

"O- Goes to show flavor doesn't always follow appearance. I thought it would be a mess, but I quite enjoyed it."
""
""
"This stuff reminds me of that purple and green ketchup that Heinz put out many years ago. It smells and tastes as it's labeled, but it looks completely mismatched and causes a mild mind bending when you make the transfer from sight to smell to taste. I actually enjoyed Bean Flicker more than I had anticipated... It was quite tasty, really, though the optical illusion aspect is something my tickled brain couldn't overcome completely."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but was released recently. Pours lightly hazy and cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger foamy and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a lot of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big nutty coffee, vanilla, cream, light bread, floral, and light grass. Awesome aromas with big presence of coffee and malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big nutty coffee, cream, vanilla, bread, floral, and light grass. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of nutty coffee, vanilla, cream, light bread, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Awesome robustness of coffee/cream flavor with a fair amount of malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Hardly any alcohol presence after the finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is an outstanding coffee blonde ale. Great robustness of authentic coffee/cream flavor; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"An interesting use of coffee with a nice light body. Could be a highly quaffable beer, but it falls apart as it warms and it feels a bit mismatched. Carbonation doesn't help either."
"this is interesting, not something i would want many of in a row but here and there it is good."

"Overall- I have had this beer several times now. Twice on tap and have purchase three six packs of it. This is my favorite sessionable beer at only 4.5% ABV I could drink this beer all day. If it proves to be available year round I have a new go to beer. I hate blonde ales because they usually lack flavor and complexity but this one has me wanting to revisit the style. Love Odd Side's brews highly recommend this beer!"

"Taste/feel: Here we go again, Odd Side impresses me. Again. Really liking how this drinks... it's about what I expected. It's a blonde ale with coffee in it. What do you want me to say? The flavor of this is actually a bit more than I thought to expect, but that's fine by me. If that's not enough, there's a solid feel to this as well. The coffee flavor manages to stick to your tongue for awhile after you sip, which I enjoy a lot -- ya don't need a dark beer to get a coffee fix in your beer, and this blonde ale proves that. A 4.5% beer with a nice body? Surprisingly bold flavor? Count me in. Odd Side just doesn't disappoint... worth the slight up-charge."

"Overall: I really like this beer, and will drink many with my wife. It is nice to have something we both enjoy! It is an interesting take on a blonde ale, different from anything I have had. I love coffee stouts, but this is the first light style I have had. I recommend this for every one looking for something session able, flavorful and different!"
"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought it was a great example of a coffee infused beer that didn't have a dark beer base, it showed me that while the dark beer base can meld well with the coffee flavors it isn't always a necessary and that coffee has the potential to work with the other styles that I never would have thought would have turned out to be good. This beer has very good drinkability, it's smooth, crisp, not filling, and the flavors did a good job of holding my attention and keeping me coming back for more, it wouldn't be a stretch from me to drink more than a few bottles of this since that taste really doesn't wear on me. What I like the most about this beer was just about everything, all aspects of this beer were right where they needed to be to live up to it's name. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't a single thing that I didn't like or would change about this beer, it's great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I already went back and got a six pack and I see a few more in my future and it just my be a new regular in my beer fridge, I would recommend this to anyone who likes coffee infused beer. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I have been pretty impressed with Oddsides but I wasn't sure that they could pull of a Coffee Blonde Ale, but they did it in a way that truly impressed me. It really messed with my head at first because it looks exactly like a normal Blonde Ale, but the taste is anything but normal. Great job Oddsides, you guys are making some great beer and I have no problem claiming that their one of my favorite up in coming brewery's. keep up the great work guys."

"Overall: i was hesitant to buy this one and only bought a single rather that a sixer. i was very pleasantly surprised. nice light coffee taste. easy the most memorable and best blonde that i can think of."
"The feel has too much spritz at first, though that drops after time. While appropriately light-bodied, it tends toward a watery feel in the middle with nothing to really make up for the loss. a smoothness seems to attempt to develop but doesn't really. A minerality comes out at the end of each sip."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma. Here we get an instantly curious juxtaposition of a clean blonde ale base, with nicely bittered grain, while atop it we ride alongside stronger coffee flavoring than we’ve experienced in some straight coffee stouts. The case is very much the same through the flavoring, with the first and last thing you’re left thinking about is this bright hazelnut coffee roastiness. It’s quite the odd pair, no pun intended. That said, it seems as if they’ve accomplished what they set out to do with this one, and we are happy to have been a part of the experiment. One downside was the carbonation, which approached the level of champagne, slowing drinkability a bit. This beer will certainly not appeal to everyone, but if you’ve got the interest it is certainly worth your time."
