"D: This was an interesting brew, but the scent and taste weren't super well composed. The body was nice, but the finish wasn't very smooth, so it was not incredibly easy to drink. Doesn't seem like the sort of beer you would want to age, but maybe a few years could help this one gel and mellow. Fresh is not worth having more than once."
"Pours an orange like color.  White head and lacing.  Aroma of potpourri herbs and citrus.  Citrus and vanilla in the flavor blending with spicy herbs.  A clash of flavor.  Slightly acidic, though short lived and Medium bodied, well carbonated.  Semi dry.  Weird beer.  The flavors didn't really work."

"Overall not a bad beer, just one that is too sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not real special. Fairly delicious, goes well with food. Tastes like standard-fare imperial porter."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: This would work well featuring the vanilla and stone fruit or the stone fruit and sour. Unfortunately the sour doesn't complement the more prominent fruit+vanilla well though the beer as a whole does pair well with the Holst suite"

"Flavor is interesting, but not evocative.  taste profile of Belgian Orange Dark Chocolate. If you like orange chocolate, u r going to like this IMHO"
""

""
""
"A bit of a mess, but bounus points for originality.  Starting to sour a little which matches the apricot well.  Glad I had this one."
"Clear gold, small white frothy head, smells of apricot, vanilla, cardamom."
"A little too sweet and for my liking."
""
"Weird taste, not pleasant but not undrinkable either."

"First Bell's tasted and am enjoying the Planet's."

""

"Taste-Tangerine, apricot, hints of vanilla and a subtle hop note. Interesting flavor and character."
""
""
""
""
""
"just wasnt that pleasant. went sour quick"
""
""
"O-While this is an interesting and unique beer, it is not one of Bell's best efforts."
"Overall: I ended up getting a good amount of these, and I am actually happy I am, unlike most who did. At first I really liked the taste but thought the balance was way off. after a couple months in the bottle the balance became really nice and even drinkable. stiff could be slightly less medicinal"
""
""
"This could honestly be the worst beer I've ever had."
""
"3.33/5.00"
""
"Wow. Not good in any meaningful way and what a disappointment for Bell's with the caveat here being if you were looking for some sort of oddly flavored iced tea this beer would be on the menu.  That's what it reminded me of, some sort of funky, apricot, peach, cardamom iced tea. Although I personally wouldn't drink this whether it was labeled beer or tea. I guess this planet series is an experiment but it's one I wish I hadn't paid to participate in. It's off to an overall mediocre start.at best.. This particular beer, by the way, lowers the curve way way down."

"Very Bitter taste to it."
"Overall I enjoyed this immensely and would love another."
"Venus seems to be an experiment that fell short for my palate. Perhaps I expected more from Bells but this one wasn't for me. The adjuncts seemed to compete rather than blend together in any meaningful way. As I mentioned, I think my feelings would be different had this been done without the overwhelming cardamom."
"This was odd. For an American blonde ale it is really sour. I guess that's from the fruit they added however."
"This was absolutely terrible. Tasted like they came up with the recipe by throwing darts at a dartboard; oh look cardamom! vanilla! apricot! The flavors didn't blend AT ALL. A total mess, and one of the few beers I have drain poured that was MEANT to taste that way."
""
"There's no other way to say this than an alcoholic Red Bull with sour patch floaters. Not my cup of tea."
""
""
""
"I kind of feel like a 2 is being nice. This is a truly awful beer. I cannot believe Bell's bottled this. Just wow. A mess of rancid flavors with some apricot. Wife and I did not finish the 12oz bottle we split."
""
""
"If you like fruity blondes it's great but not everyone's first choice of style"
"All I can say about this beer is, ""YUCK"". This is bottled a$$ with a hint of Apricot."
"Lots of apricot.  Not the best.  Mars was real good though."
""
""
"After looking at all the mediocre reviews of this beer, I had very low expectations. However, Venus turned out to be one of the most pleasant surprises I have ever come across. Astonishingly complex and unique in so many different facets, this beer seems to be an incredibly successful experiment by the folks at Bell's."
""
"Overall, I can see what Bell's was going for but the vanilla is too strong and cardamom simply does not work with vanilla. The cardamom works with the honey but the vanilla just doesn't match up well."
""
""
"Too tart for my taste."
""
""
"I decided to try this much maligned Ale, and I found it to be tart refreshing and above all else, tasty! Admittedly this has a unique taste profile (not many brews have a sweet apricot taste that lingers on) and it isn't something that I would choose to have too often. As an occasional treat, I'd say this is delicious."
"Beer tastes great but looks and smells ight"
"This one has been getting raggedon as the worst of the bunch but so far I think it's the best of the bunch. Didn't get around to trying Mars though."
"I really did not like this beer. I took a few sips and couldn't finish it. It tasted too medicinal and sweet."
"I actually kind of liked it.  The sourness, the flavors.. very interesting brew. Might not be able to do more than 12oz in one sitting, but I'd definitely try it again."
"O: a unique blonde ale worth trying, especially if you like vanilla flavored ales."
"t/m/o - truth in advertising. All the flavors are present, honey apricot cadmium vanilla and it comes across very candy like. Sort of artificial tasting. Not bad, but the kind of brew you try a single of not the kind that you would want a 4 or 6 pack of. Novel and unique and not half bad, let's call it interesting...a bit of a fizzy fruit drink kind of."
""
"Packed on 10/2/14. Poured into a pint glass this has some lively carbonation but no head. Clear and golden. Aromas of sweetness apricot and slight vanilla. Taste is odd-tart and bitter at the same time. Overpowers anything else here. Really lingers. Rough brew."
""
"Drain pour.  Was with 4 other people tasting this and it was horrid.  I cannot imagine that the brewers tasted this sober."
""
""
""
"I hope that the little sour smell that I got in the nose will come out more with some age."
""
""
""
"really good beer and really excited about it"
""
"The apricot, honey, cardamom and vanilla beans are all prevalent. Not sure if they are all supposed to be together though. Glad this is only a 12oz bottle"
"Flavor is strangely close to the taste of Redbull."
""
"The body is light and the crispness has a firm nip without dirupting the smoothness that goes creamy as it builds off a consistent carbonation."
""
"It want my favorite taste."
""
"I didn't want to write a review but have to?"
"Fantastic fruity and a bit sour"
"Luckily this is a beer that is only being brewed once, as I would not seek this out or even drink again."
""
"Oh jesus, oh my I think to my self as I take the first sip.  There is a lot going on here and it is mostly bad.  Oddly soured fruits mixed with vanilla candle wax and musky honey tones on the tongue.  This can't be what they were shooting for here.  Really not enjoyable to drink at all.  I really wanted to like this beer, especially because of how hard it was to get, but I just don't.  Nothing good to say so I won't say any more at all."
""
"1st review! A truly unique brew. Apricots and honey up front and a slight taste of vanilla. Didn't catch much of the cardamom and wouldn't have guessed it was there if the label hadn't said so. Smells interesting and tastes exactly the same.  Not bad per se but definitely not something I'd reach for again. Nonetheless glad I got  to try this as its definitely an interesting beer."
"This beer tasted really bad"

"A very unique tasting beer combining the sweet, acidic, juiciness of apricots and the smooth richness of vanilla beans. Well crafted beer, the pairing however isn't that complimentary."
"O - It is an attack on the senses. The aroma and flavor are huge. I enjoy the apricot and vanilla aspects. I am still not sure if I grasp the cardamom. It is interesting and definitely worth a try."
"mouthfeel is good and overall I like this one 9pm"

"I would rather drink miller lite. Quite possibly one of the worst beers I've ever had. I usually will not waste a beer but half way through I couldn't stomach anymore and dumped it out. I"

""
""
"Valiant effort - however there really is nothing appealing about this beer. Overpowering/Unbalanced on the sweet/tart apricot. The only thing keeping it from being a drain pour was the $15 price tag on the 6 pack. Hoping for much better with Mercury this month."
""
""

"Poured a cloudy golden body with a thin cap of foam. It looks alright, though appearance is the weakest element of the beer. Scents of fresh apricot, vanilla, light cardamom, sugar cookie-like malt sweetness, a slight floral aroma is also present. Overall impression of aroma is of a wonderfully fruity and sweet beer, with a big hit of apricot, but also showcasing the vanilla and cardamom additions and a bit of the malt. Very nice. Flavor begins lightly sweet and sour, with notes of vanilla, sweet and lightly sour apricot juice and very light sweet spiciness, likely from the cardamom. Middle moves into a flavor profile that is very strongly reminiscent of the tart flesh near the apricot pit with lesser amounts of vanilla still present. Finish is sweet and tart with notes of tart apricot flesh, vanilla and a background of sweet spices. Aftertaste is sweet and tart with notes of apricot, vanilla and cardamom. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice fruit beer, one that melds the sweetness of apricot with the tartness of the innermost flesh and blends it well with vanilla and cardamom notes. My only complaint is that I wish there was a bit more assertiveness to the malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation and a lightly tart feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nicely done beer that captures the feel of eating an apricot. Overall this is a fantastic beer. More experimental than Mars, it has a wonderful aroma, a beautiful flavor and a lovely mouthfeel. Quite nice and well worth hunting down."

"My nearly inverted pour, following a Pop! of the cap, created two fingers of fluffy, off-white head with low retention. It fell like a souffle after the oven door has been slammed shut, but it left some wonderful lacing in its wake. Color was a Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, "
""
"O:  An interesting beer, overall.  It was enjoyable and refreshing enough, though almost more like a hard cider than a beer."
""
"Pours gold with almost zero head. Aroma starts off with the hit of cardamom paired with apricot, a touch of grain and vanilla bean round things out. Aroma starts off tart an spicy, finishes out sweeter and richer.  Tastes like candied apricot mixed with cardamom and paired with a little vanilla. Medium bodied, slight activity. Overall, interesting beer and it grew on me the more I drank it. Good balance in the use of ingredients. But in the end, I just wasn't much a fan."
""
""
""
"O- this is the only American Blonde Ale that I've had that has flavor, I'll give them that.  But this was just all over the place.  It's not terrible, but probably should stay a one time release.  3.5, just for sheer uniqueness"

"The nose is spice, coriander, barnyard yeast, apricot jam, vanilla and heavy floral hop content.  The flavor is the big let down.  What a disappointment.  Lots of apricot, but the coriander, spices, and flowers ruin it.  It is very soapy, astringent and grainy and thin.  A bit of a mess."

"Gold in color with some haziness from suspended sediment.  A fingernail of off white head sits on top.  Faint overly sweet aroma of apricots is hard to pickup.  The flavor is an intenselycloying sweetness quickly giving way to a hefty dose of herbal cardamom.  There's moderate carbonation and it's syrupy."
""

"maybe too weird for some? with apricot juice, cardamom, vanilla bean, and honey. I personally think this thing is amazing, expertly balanced between all these unique and not often paired elements, it really does work, and they really all do get tasted. there is a funny tang to the nose, the apricot and the vanilla the most robust additives, and a curious yeast character with some booze too. the taste is amazing through, the honey and the apricot are really vibrant and authentic up front with some sweeter and richer barley malt, which the cardamom is just subtle in the middle and brings out the hoppier side of this, and the vanilla is all in the finish, sweet, and circling back to the apricot in a well timed reprise. to say its complex is an understatement, and I see why others have not reviewed this beer favorably, but I for one admire its reach and think its as well put together as it possibly could be considering its constituent parts. cant wait for the rest of the series!"

"O: it is almost awesome. I love the way the vanilla finishes it off. The overpowering apricot leaves it is a bit of a disappointment."
""
""
""
"This beer is foul. It reminds me much more of the experiments of another Michigan brewery: Short's. Many of Short's creations are wildly off-target, and this is just like that. Massive apricot and coriander in the nose - huh? And the taste combination is just bizarre, and not in any way enjoyable. Cloying sweetness that gets shattered by an odd twang sort of bitter, sort of chemical. I feel like I'm being generous with my rating."
""
""
""
"overall: Dug Mars and trust Bell's...i.e will grab the next in the series but this ain't for me."

""

"Appearance was not overly odd, thin head and great color. Nose carried the apricot but I didn't get much else. Taste roller coaster as the apricots came first, followed by the cardamom and finally a weird finish that I can't even begin to explain. Mouthfeel was syrupy in a bad way with an oddly pleasant aftertaste of apricots. Brewed once, so I guess we won't have to endure this again"
""
""
""
"O: I know this beer gets a lot of hate on BA, but I actually enjoyed it quite a bit (although I will admit I am a whore for cardamom).  The aroma is wonderful, the taste doesnt live up, but is still good.  And its very unique, I really cant remember ever having a beer that was anything close to this.  4"
""
""
"Taste is less than spectacular. First thing I noticed was a thickness on the palate and a sugary sweetness. The malt is pretty rich and the honey adds sugar too. There is a bright apricot that loses it's way amidst the earthy vanilla that gets stronger as you drink and the cardamom which also adds earth. There is a strange spice taste int eh finish with a tinge of alcohol as well.  It's almost a plastic like taste or a taste like something in there is synthetic.  There is a sour undertaste overall.  Finishes with a bitterness form hops that frankly saves it and makes it drinkable.  That hops presence comes to the palate to lighten up all that thickness and thick flavor and leaves a bit of bitterness alongside the tart apricot.  This frankly tastes like a spiked fruit punch and the mouthfeel is just too heavy. I do not think these flavors work well together."
""
"Overall to me if they kept the base and just used the vanilla beans/ apricot juice this beer would rate much better. The Cardamom to me is what made this beer weird."
""
""
"At fridge temp, the Vanilla and Apricot really clash. As it warmed they started playing nicely together. This bottle is almost 5 months old, I'm thinking some more age might do it some favors. I definitely like it more now than when it was fresh. Will report back in the summer after cracking open another bottle."
""
"O) This beer will appeal to very few people. The fact the ratings indicate it is okay, rather than poor is likely due to Bells reputation as a world class brewery. I like Bells as much as any craft beer enthusiast, and will continue to buy their beer, but this one is just horrible."
""
""
""
"Disappointing. Not sure what the intention was here, but it sure seems that an innocent, mild beer was created to support a blizzard of clashing adjuncts. “We have some of that? Throw it in the pot & lessee what happens!” Not good."

"O: I enjoy Blonde ales and American blonde ales, this one is noteworthy for being different, just not my favorite that I have had.  I would prefer a less bitter taste, however I think Apricots go better with wheat ales than an imperial blonde."
""
"This was undrinkable. Drain poured halfway through the bottle, couldn't finish."
"O:  How did they release this beer?  I find it hard that a sensory panel would agree that this tasted good.  I love DFH, but this really seems like something that would be released by them.  I hate to say it, but this is disgusting.  It is basically undrinkable.  At least a macro beer would be drinkable."
"Tasted like cough syrup, pretty gross.  Unfortunate because I like a lot of Bell's beers"
""
""
""
"Orange body with a soapy white head. Super sweet with mint and spice. Instantly cloying. Ouch. Palate assault. Odd and gross. Avoid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an interesting beer to say the least. I don't hate it, but I'm not crazy about it. I know this will sound weird, but I'd describe it as ""Great Lakes Christmas Ale with apricot juice"". It is a beer that's fitting for the holidays."

"Unlike my whole Trooper immersion deal, I'm not listening to Holst right now, but I think I can remember enough of the piece to keep in mind during this whole endeavor.  This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises orange zest, powdered sugar, Creamsicle, light coriander, vanilla, and a touch of lemon peel.  The taste brings in more of the same, the vanilla and spices leading the way, followed by a strong wave of orange and apricot juices, which end up washing out all else.  Some mild lemon-like tartness pervades the finish.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a nice enough beer, but I think the fruit juices overpower the proceedings.  Not really a peaceful situation, if you ask me, but also not entirely chaotic."

"Pours a slightly hazy blonde is orange color with white head that retains decently.  The nose starts with heavy vanilla and apricot notes. Reminds me of orange cream soda a bit but with candied apricot instead of orange.  The cardamom brings a spicy herbal character at the back end. The taste starts with a strong tartness from the apricot.  The tartness was not too prevalent in the nose but dominates the flavor. The vanilla softens it a bit before the cardamom takes over giving the end a spicy flavor.  The combo of flavors is quite odd and totally unique.  Each of the adjuncts stand out and are identifiable with the exception of the honey.  Overall, I'm glad to have tried this unique and creative brew even if the flavors don't harmonize that nicely."
"O: I don't necessarily think this beer is as bad as the average rating makes it out to be. It is a strange beer in many ways, though. Worth trying for its novelty value."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: 3. I appreciate what Bell’s was trying to do here but this was just not for me. The blend of fruit, floral and vanilla left me with an unshakable “yup, hand soap” impression."

"I bought this one because it was a limited edition, it was ok."

"L=3.5, A=3.0, T=1.0, MF=1.5, D=1.0"

""
""
""
""
"Overall, it had some good flavors but was very weird in general. This bottle will be tough to drink."
""
"Bells really struck out with this one. I get dirty vegetation, a weird cleaning product like taste, and a touch of junky vanilla on the palate.  Drainpoured after three sips."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too sweet and a strange aftertaste to my palate."
""
"Overall:  Perhaps one of the most divisive beers ever targeting the craft beer community, with the majority coming out on the negative side; still, I found the beer fascinating with layers of flavor unfolding;  while I am glad to have tasted it, I doubt that I would seek it out again"
""
"This is a unique beer.  Fruitiness and cardamom in the nose brings to mind something Belgian.    The taste is tart apricot, with a candy-like aspect from the vanilla beans.   The finish has a wine-like aspect to it.   This didn't seem like my it was going to be my thing-- I don't like sweet, spiced or sour beers, and this is a bit of all three.  However, the flavors in this are very complex and blend into a harmonious whole.  A successful and interesting experiment."
"One finger rocky orangy/off-white head. Unobtrusive lightly malty, fruity aroma. Fruit dominates the flavor, followed by biscuity malt. The apricot just didn't work for me. At all. Medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a short finish. Sorry, but this just isn't for me."
""
""
"Not a fan, too sour for me. Although if you like sours this is really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a hard one to describe. Tastes like a weird fruit cocktail Creamsicle. Yeah...that's it."

"OVERALL:  I’m almost unsure if I should rate this right now.  It is simply so different from anything I’ve had that I feel I need to let it sink in for a bit.  That said, I’m digging it more and more as the glass begins to empty, it was just a shock to the taste buds at first."
"Much better than expected. I see how some don't get this, but as a chef I can fully appreciate how the apricot and cardamom work together. Great medium body with nice carbonation that allows the flavors to shine through. Tastes like a hard tea, so maybe not what people are looking for in a beer but I can fully appreciate how the flavors work here. Glad I took a chance with this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'd classify this more as a fruit beer than as a blonde ale, and it's a decent fruit beer. I'm seldom in the mood for a fruit beer, however."
""
"O: A great offering, but imperfect; less objective reviewers will also deduct points due to high expectations from the hype (and price). This beer has a lot to offer, both a strong suit and a weakness. Each major flavor is clear and ample, and most work well together. The fruit and cardamom certainly do, but the strong notes of vanilla made it too much. A good, adventurous concept that had very good realization, and it is a calming brew, but ultimately unbalanced. My relatively high score looks on the bright side of their adventurous goal and less on objective, balanced, traditional beer scoring- any adjunct-scorners will probably burn their hands just holding this bottle."

"12 ounce bottle, Batch 13524, packaged 10/02/14.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  Aroma is fruity and sweet, it smells like apricots, vanilla, cardamom, honey and a sweet spiciness.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it's sweet, fruity and a bit spicy and somewhat tart, too.  I do think it's more fruity and sweet than anything else.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation.  This sure doesn't drink like a beer that's 7.5% ABV.  Overall I liked this, but if you don't like sweet/fruity beers then you might not like this as much as I did.  $2.79 a single bottle."
""
"BTW, what’s up with Holst? He calls Venus “the Bringer of Peace,” which according to planetary science, is total BS. It’s the hottest planet in the solar system, and it has a super dense atmosphere. Clearly, he was interpreting the planets from a mythological standpoint…love, beauty, femininity.  He wrote Venus as a resolution to Mars, “the Bringer of War.” I wonder if my perception of this beer would be different if I had tasted Mars first."
"Mostly clear gold covered with a fine layer of milky white bubbles.  Smells like chai tea...sweet, powdery vanilla, cardamom, graham cracker, and light dried apricot.  Flavor is a surprisingly tart bite of apricot along with lemon, creamy vanilla, herbs, and flowers.  Creamy, dry feel, not cloying.  The aroma is the best part, a little too much dried apricot in the flavor for me."
"Amber, slightly hazy, and a white head that fades reasonably fast. This smells like chai....maybe fruitier. Sweet cinnamon, cardamom, brown sugary scents, sweet citrus, cocoa, and fleshy tropical pitted fruits. Very aromtic. Taste is sweet, tropical, delightfully fruity and sourly bitter with farmy funk. Excellent foamy mouthfeel.... A very unusual, surprisingly pleasant beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sour an refreshing, the smell is outstanding... The apricot delivers a strong sour 'lemon like' punch. Has faint spice and real nice sourness and complexity on the back end~"
""
"I can't believe this is getting scored so low, I like the vanilla notes with the tart apricot and cardamom spice in the finish it's working for me while I listened to Gustav Holst's Venus: the bringer of peace.  Appears with minimal head even after a hard pour a bit under carbonated, bottled on 10/2/14.  Hazed apricot glowing orange, minimal white head as mentioned left fine speckled lacing.  Aroma tart apricot, soft vanilla even some earthy apricot pit notes.  Honey ferments out pretty well, maybe some slight floral notes.  Flavor has vanilla all over, the base is a tart mild citric experience of the apricot juice, there's alot going on honey, cardamom, apricot, and vanilla compete and lack cohesion.  I'm enjoying it but it's a challenging beer to consume.  Mouthfeel is a bit cloying some residual sweetness and something in the texture makes it tough to swallow, light carbonation doesn't help this body move across the palate any better.  Overall, there's ups and downs I appreciate the effort, but I can see why there's mixed reviews on this one...although I did enjoy it."
""
"O - A good and interesting beer. I think that it would have worked better in a spicy Saison style without the vanilla. It was a fund beer to drink and taste."
"Overall: A pretty unique twist on a Blonde ale that comes out pretty decent. Nice citrus flavor with a sweetness that avoids becoming too messy."

"Not even close to what I thought this beer would taste like! Almost taste's like a mead but with  a lot more carbonation. Not bad but not that good either."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed pilsner, the beer is a bright, vibrant, orange coloring, with a ton of carbonation, and only a wispy, sparse, white surface coating of head. Aromas of sweet apricot, rich honey, subtle spices, and toasted grains. Very sweet, and a bit lopsided nose. Flavors are very tangy and sweet forward. Holy hell, cloying, like an overpowering piece of candy. The honey and apricot clash a bit, with sweet over sweet taking out their frustrations on your palate. Slightly sour, even. Vanilla notes come in, too, and it does not help matters. Yikes. Oily, slick body, with a slightly sharp edge from the carbonation. The aftertaste is very cloying, with a tangy, tart, and slightly sour blending linger. Slick, lingering finish. This one is not good."

"Glad I only got one bottle but i didn't hate it."

"This is without a doubt the worst beer I have ever had from Bell's. Way out of balance and a complete mess. Not sure what the goal was here but it's a wad of character and a mess that has no clear definition. Frankly, it tastes like poor homebrew. Really shocked at Bell's on this one."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle, this unique brew pours a hazy amber with a nice layer of white foam that dissipates to a thin pooling layer and nice lacing.  Nose of apricots, sweet malts, and an herbal note I can not put my finger on...most likely cardamom.  Flavors are unique with sweetness to the sides and tartness to the front and back mingling with apricots and vanilla beans as it warms.  The herbal notes are enticing with a sweet tart like candy flavor being rounded out by nice carbonation to make this one very pleasant to say the least.  Happy to have tried it."
"Slightly sweet.  Pleasant beer."
""
"This one was not for me; it was one of the worst tasting beers I've tried. It was dry and unbalanced and I didn't care for the apricot or cardamom flavors; even vanilla, a flavor I generally like, seemed out of place. My overall takeaway was that is was a ""kitchen sink"" brew (as in, ""we at Bell's threw everything in here but the kitchen sink."")."

"Fruit beers are not my favorite style, but I really appreciated the flavors and dry mouth feel.  The brew is refreshing and reminds me of a champagne cocktail from New Years Eve."
""
"On a side note, I'm usually not a huge fan of Brettanomyces, but I wonder if it would have helped this one a bit...just a thought."
"They started off with mars, which was great. Second round, not so good. Hopefully this planet series gets better..."

"if, for the hell of it, you bought every flavor of Yoplait off the shelf this would taste like the worst one. Pretentious label should say yeast instead of peace. Initial hit of apricot hides the freshly manufactured diaper taste . Bell's was a holy name to me before I tried this, I came to BA for someone to describe the redeeming qualities of this beer but only found the truth."

"Feel is all right- medium light body with moderate carbonation and a little cloying. I don't like this one. I feel like this is a gimmicky series and is producing mediocre brews below bells usually high level."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/2/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, apricot, cardamom, honey, bread, vanilla, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of pale malt, fruit, spices, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, apricot, cardamom, honey, bread, vanilla, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of fruit tartness and earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apricot, cardamom, honey, bread, vanilla, herbal, grass, light pepper and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and solid balance of pale malt, fruit, spices, and earthy hop flavors; with a solid sweetness/tartness/bitterness balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly slick/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid and unique spiced blonde ale. Good robustness and solid balance of pale malt, fruit, spices, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A bit off balanced with the spices and fruit with some slight cloying flavors; but quite enjoyable overall."

"Apricot sourness and cardamom spices dominate the taste. Kind of blends the holiday beer flavor with a fruited Berliner."
""
"The taste was more complicated. Tart and spicy. Apricot fruitiness was tart but not bitter. I really didn't detect any honey or vanilla until it had warmed up considerably and then only because I knew it was in the beer and I was looking for it. There was a surprising lack of sweetness in this beer. I expected with honey and apricot it would present sweeter but it was drying and tart. I am glad I tried it but I wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
"Cardamom jumps to the forefront of the aroma, with a touch of must and vanilla. Sandalwood comes to mind. Apricot is soft and subtle. There's a bit of funk and phenols. Flavor reveals a tart and sour base, sweetened slightly by the vanilla that lingers long in the aftertaste. Apricot becomes evident in the tart/sour character, along with candied orange. Reminds me of st Joe's children's vitamins. Honey sweetness emerges mid palate to accompany the vanilla. Cardamom weaves throughout. But, the apricot sourness rules the day. Very interesting, but I wish the vanilla were dialed down a bit."

"Almost shandy like..Had high hopes for this one but left much to be desired"
""
"D/O- I had been told by a couple good friends that this beer was a letdown before I tried it. I am hard-pressed to disagree with them. The label description reads ""malt beverage brewed with apricot juice and honey with cardamom and vanilla beans added""...that description is either a recipe for a really tasty beer or one that just kind of is there all muddled. Sadly, it's the latter. Drain pour after 6 ounces :("

"Being a fan of sour beers I enjoyed the slight amount of tartness behind it. Although I don't like fruit in my beer, but I didn't find it to be overpowering. Overall I think its worthy of the 3.75 I gave it"
""
""
""
""
""
"Finishing with the unique taste of citrus but without its associated fructose, honey or candy sweetness, the ale seems to capture the taste of orange cream sickle but without much of its sweetness. Instead a vanilla softness soothes the senses while a peppermint bite returns in echoes."

"A bit too sweet and fruity for my taste. Also, the spices don't really blend well."

"O - This is definetly a different beer. The flavors just don't work harmoniously, but I appreciate Bell's doing something different."

"Off flavors and sour.  Avoid. Not an enjoyable experience on 3 different occasions."

"O- the aroma and flavor was all over the place and so was the taste. I respect that they tried to branch out and do something adventurous (especially by eliminating the hop bitterness and replacing it with sourness to balance the sweetness), but I was disappointed overall. I had much higher expectations after Mars IPA, and for $19.99 for a six pack, it better be amazing. The other beer I picked up while at the liquor store was fresh zombie dust, and that was $4.00 cheaper. You can't tell me that someone honestly thinks this is worth $4 more than zombie dust."

"Not a huge fan, too fruity and tar for my taste"

"After Mars i was pretty excited about this one.  Thought its was going to be a solid tripel type beer, but sad to say I had to drain pour.  On to the next planet because this one was bad.  1.5 just because its Bells."

""
""
"I really do like this fruity tart sour of a beer.  I'm going to age a few to see what happens and if those colliding flavors ever settle down."
"Instead, the beer is boozy and unbalanced. The spice overpowers. Just a messy brew in general."
"Overall, disappointed in this brew - just too many different flavors and they just don't mix.  Glad I only purchased a single."
"This was quite possibly the worst beer I have ever tasted. These flavors do not meld. Bell's struck out with this. Barely could get through the glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't know.  At first I thought it was way too tart, and would be a chore to finish.  Some warmth brings out complexity and makes for a more enjoyable beer.  From a geeky standpoint, I'm glad I had it and can continue the ""Planets"" series.  However, I wouldn't seek out any extras on this one."

"Tastes like a vanilla/apricot brandy. Next to no hop flavor that I get. Full of flavor and lightly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not entirely certain this isn't beer but carbonated apricot juice.  No hops, no malt, just apricot... so much apricot."
""
""

"Golden with a soft spicy and fruity smell.  The smell reminds me a lot of a Christmas type of spiced beer.  Taste is very acidic, with a mix of holiday spices (cloves, cardamom?) and fruit (lemon, apple, peach). No hops.  Alcohol masked well.  A pretty unique oddball."
""
""
"I'm glad I only got a bottle at this price point. This beer just isn't the way I envisioned it, and maybe that's affecting my scoring... I just expected something more refined from Bell's. A great man once asked, ""Did Venus sweep you off your feet?"" ... and the answer is no. No it didn't."
"Really not my style. Mouthfeel and carbonation are ok, even aroma is good to me. But my god the taste is odd. After Mars I came into this with high expectations, and while I appreciate the attempted innovation, I'll be more than satisfied to share my other bottle."
""
""
"I can't believe bells actually released this beer to the public. No balance or moderation at all. Just glad bells doesn't fail hard like this on a regular basis"
""
""
""
""
"You have to really really really like apricot to like this beer."
""
""

"This one was quite bad. I applaud the experiment, but the acidity and tartness of the apricot juice overrides everything in the beer. I was looking forward to the vanilla and honey notes and couldn't do anything other than pucker. Disappointed by this iteration of the planet series after thoroughly enjoying Mars."
""
""
""
"This beer smells exactly like a cream soda. Strong spicy vanilla smell. Some juicy apricot. The flavor is acidic, bitter, unripened apricot with vanilla and hints of cardamon spice. Not that nice. No hops. Medium carbonation. Overall, it's not terrible, just not anything delicious. It's very unique, but it's too acidic and the various flavors don't work together nicely. I'm glad Bell's is being creative, but this is far from their finest. Hope the other planets come out better."
""

"Interesting and quite different for a blonde ale. Smells like a Belgian single with very light hints of vanilla and cardamom.  Tart and astringent taste with light fruit and vanilla on the finish.  Very bold flavors, maybe a bit too acidic and not enough malt or sweetness.  No hops to be found."
"O- This really resembles some sort of experimental Short's beer more than anything I've had from Bell's before. And like a lot of Short's  beers this seems to be a love it or hate type beer. I don't really care for it, it's not offense, just not a fan of the flavor combination."
