I didn't know at the time what an ale was,but it was pleasant enough & the price was always right. Had it at a wedding at a VFW this past august & was impressed. Now, as a nouveau hipster brew this could stand next to PBR as a cool slumming bev, only with flavor & character. A piney afternote surprised & convinced me. As good as Porkslap, Victory, or any other B+ pale.","bobdrob","Jan 03, 2015"

AROMA: funky tin malts--as expected from a 40 oz. bottle--and some banana at the end--mostly wet pennies... PALATE: thin at first; beefy ending; gassy and slick; easy drinking otherwise... TASTE: lemony wheat grass; biscuity and toasted malts reign supreme in this otherwise thin profile...OVERALL: intrigued by its history--and ODB’s proclivity for it, according to song--this 40 oz.er drinks easy and malty with a bit of refreshment to it--but it also is a bit thin and unimpressive in its refrigerated neighborhood, where OE 800 and Mickey’s reside...","dacrza1","Aug 29, 2014"

Has more hop flavor than others in its class.  Has a corny adjuncty finish.  It's far from horrible, it isn't the greatest beer ever made either.  The beer has its place.

It's clean, refreshing, and has real flavor. I was truly surprised and said 'wow' out loud several times with my first pint can. While it's not quite on the hop level of a contemporary APA, Ballantine really has a similar feel to it. Will try again when I get the chance.","DagenhamDavis","Jul 06, 2014"

Head dissipates and leaves behind some lacing, uneven distribution but its there. Smell is grassy, a bit of sugar too and some citrus. There's some sweetness and hops there, nice aroma. Taste is decent, macro-ish but a lot more hops are present. Now this is an APA, and it doesn't have the hop bill of SNPA or Sam Adams Boston Ale, but what am I judging this against.

Pours a light yellow/gold, with medium carbonation and an inch of frothy white head that doesn't really leave any lacing. Fairly aromatic, with light malts, citric orange zest and perhaps some pine. Very flavorful as well, with sweet corn, a minerally industrial twang and a dash of sulfur forming the base, topped with layers of citric, resiny, piney, almost woodsy hops that impart a mild, but noticeable bitterness. Very cleanly fermented, with just a hint of ethanol. Its body is crisp, tingly and dry, but a touch too heavy for mass consumption. This is a great light beer that has become a staple in my fridge. While it isn't really an APA (more of an American adjunct ale), I imagine this is very similar to what pre-Prohibition beers tasted like. Make sure not to drink this too cold, because light beers don't get any more flavorful than this; imagine having Cascade-flavored burps from a macrobrew. While I have not had this out of the bottle, I don't think I ever would because they use green glass. Regardless of whether or not you like light beers, if you find this in the can, buy it, I highly recommend it, if only to see that not all mass-produced beer is flavorless swill.","mmmbeer","Jan 24, 2011"

The taste gives you a quick flash of subtle citrus hop right up front and ends with a dissolving hop grain taste. It smells and tastes like a semi watered down Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. That was my first impression on smelling and tasting this beer. Obviously the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has more solid tastier bitter hops and a way nicer malt taste but this really does this trick if you cant afford Sierra. Drinkablity is very nice not filling and lower alcohol content. This is definitely beats out Budweiser, Miller and Coors. This beer seemed like a beer bursting with taste right after I just drank a Miller Lite... but then I guess a lot of beers have more taste than that. But the big 3 all taste the same to me anyways.

Nicely carbonated mouthfeel with superb drinkabilty. Its clean and smooth and feels more substanial than other cheap beers. I like it, alot in fact.

Even though it says it's an ale, it definitely tastes more like a lager to me. It lacks the crisp dryness that some of the other macros tend to have. I would have preferred a 12 oz can as 16 just seems to be just enough to fatique the palate with this beer. I can only drink one of these and would have to move on to something else. I don't really think it's significantly better than any of the other macro competition out there. In my opinion, it would be best as an accompaniment with some pizza or spicy food.

Flavors of watery hops and bland malts are hidden in the background, but a stale character fills the palate mostly. Mouthfeel is weak, very light and uninspiring. Fair drinkability.

The mouthfeel was watery as in most macro-lagers, and the off flavor made this beer low on the drinkability scale.

The taste is one of sweet malt, perhaps a tad too sweet, as this distracts from the drinkability, which is still quite pleasant. As the brew hits the mouth the sweetness is easily detected, then fortunately dries quickly.

The recipe supposedly dates back to 1820. Pours a golden yellow with a little head and some nice bubbling. Smell is slightly hoppy and crisp. Taste is wonderfully crisp and hoppy. Yes, there are hops in a beer that cost $3.99 a sixer! I know, I was as surprised as you. This would be a great beer for a hot summer day or to buy for when you gotta supply a large amount of beer for "the guys", a game, etc. Its cheap and its satisfying.

I can still drink it, and considering the cost and the fact that it is a macro-brew, it is drinkable. It is best out of the bottle and very cold. The beer is a darker yellow than a regular macro with a nice white head that fades quickly. There is little aroma to speak of, but the taste is predominately grainy with a little hops at the end. It has a crisp, clean though thin feel in the mouth. The beer is a nice drinkable beer that I like at picnics or with pizza. I indulge a couple times a year in a sixer.

The beer is very clean and refreshing when sipped (I preferred them right out of the bottle). It has a medium body, and faint corn adjunct taste. The aftertaste is tart, and might be due to a strange hop blend. This isn't really a pale ale, and the hops are so minimal I wouldn't even really call it such. Very macro in fashion, but also in price. I'd take these over many others in the price region. Good for a BBQ.","99bottles","Mar 27, 2004"

The appearance was a cloudy straw color with a nice firm head. The head was thick at first, but then died out to a laceing. The smell was nothing great, just your average hops, grains, and a little malts. The taste was quite pleasing with it's creamy texture, which was also it's big point in mouthfeel. The taste had elements of the hops and tinge of malts, but also had the feel of a yeastyness to it, as well as a sweet undertone. Overall a nice little brew.

Carbonation hits the tongue pretty hard, but there's no flavor on the front of the tongue. Then that intense flavor rolls down the sides and back of the tongue. The best I can describe it is that it tastes like the smell of shoe polish. There is a distinct sulphur aftertaste, and a bitter flavor that sticks in the back of the throat and lingers. I had to pour out the last third of the glass. The reason that this was so many Dads' beers is because the poor guys had no other choice back then.
