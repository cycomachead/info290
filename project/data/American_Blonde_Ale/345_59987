OCCASION: finding a new favorite show in Drunk History at State College...APPEARANCE: pale, almost wan, weak yellow car body; pillowy white, single-finger head that thins rather quickly... AROMA: sharp banana; damp yeasts with some funk--a wet blanket? noticeably light malt scents--not very alluring ... PALATE: medium-bodied; oily and palpably gritty; smooths out over the course of the glass draining; refreshing overall ... TASTE: light, spritzy lemon; a bit doughy for an ale; the funk in the aroma bleeds into the taste--odd dish detergent lingers... OVERALL: an oddly spotty offering from Victory--sharp and slightly abrasive with the overall experience rounding out the profile with some acceptance, but a mix of scents and tastes that do not seem to coexist peacefully... light enough to fit the season, but not large enough to occupy attention or demand a revisit....","dacrza1","Aug 05, 2014"

At 5.2% this is a great little session ale, easy enough for everyone and complex enough that I found it entertaining. Very nice summer brew - if you're going to be out on a boat, at the beach, wherever - this wouldn't be a bad choice. Give it a shot - nice beer.","Mantooth","Jul 31, 2014"

Seemed to have a little bit of a noble hop bite, kinda grassy, which I dug, nice and carbonated, much tastier than a Bud/PBR/ect. Had a more present malt body than would be expected, nice and bready. I probably would normally purchase something local/cheaper if going in this category but its one of the better "summer beers" out there. Quite quaffable.","BigCheese","Jul 30, 2014"

I'm assuming that it's also the hops, but I'm picking up an odd, brothy aroma. Kind of like onion skins. Not feeling the smell. Taste is an improvement. Solid herbal/floral hops with a cracker grain malt body. Finish is clean, with slight ale yeast fruitiness. Mouthfeel is moderate overall.

As being new to the blond ale style, I thought this was refeshing due to the thinner body and lemon zest it has to it. I thought the malt up front was a bit bland however, though that does not detract too much from it. Not a bad offering from Victory.","PA-hunter","Jun 05, 2014"

It did the trick, but wasn't anything particularly special. It has the same strong floral hoppiness going on as many other "summer" brews, though there isn't quite as much fruitiness as you sometimes get from blonde ales. One thing I'll say for it is it didn't lose flavor as I drank it, as some beers do on hot summer days.","ferociouswalrus","Jun 01, 2014"

Pouring into my SAPP this brew is a bright yellow with a big bubble white creamy top head. On the taste the hoppiness prevails up front, not bitter but very bright and sharp with a thin maltiness behind it that doesn't diminish the sharpness of the hops. A different hop belt very yerba like and sweet yet strong. Not really my kind of flavor.","mooseisloose","Aug 31, 2013"

Maybe Saaz or Centennial, but mostly for flavor. Makes way to a sweet, but still light malt body. Best parts about this beer is 1. it is consistent, & 2. it doesn't taste like a blonde ale. It's more like a light hoppy pilsner with and American twist. For a summer seasonal, there sure are worse beers.","dnphoto","Jul 20, 2013"

Aromas of toasted grains, slight buttery sweetness, and a light hopping. Flavors are a bit more hopped, with a slightly bitter forward flavor followed by a solid, smooth toasted grain backbone. The buttery notes catch the tail end leading into the bitter and spiced hoppy aftertaste. The finish is crisp, clean, and slightly dry.

If it is to be a summer blonde, I prefer a little more subtlety and yet recently I have been feeling more and more like Victory's beers are over the top, especially regarding their use of hops. And that from a hophead! I do not know whether it is on their end or mine, but as a consumer, I am not as pleased as in the past.

Taste of grapefruit, orange rind, lemon zest, herbal, floral, pine, grass, and bready malts. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, floral, pine, grass, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Great blend of hops flavor with good balance.

Thereâ€™s simply too many lemon and dried hay flavors in here, and they get in the way of everything else. The extra-bitter aftertaste is also strange, drying out the mouth and leaving the drinker wanting another sip to refresh the palate.

Nice looking summer beer! Smell- herbal, floral hops. Almost a rosey aroma. Really nice. There is a grassy quality to it too. Taste- clean, crisp, hoppy, with a tiny bit of malt sweetness on the end. This is just so clean, crisp, refreshing. So incredibly drinkable- it has some german pilsner qualities to it, but also some really nice hop presence that you might find in a pale ale.

3.55,-4.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"a very german or czech pils style summer brew. pours clear honey colored with a one inch white head and very large bubbles slowly rising to the surface. smells like german malts and bittering hops. refreshing aroma. flavor is a little bready from the malts, perhaps making this not the most appropriate style of beer for the season, but its on the lighter side of the malt spectrum and doesnt weigh it down too much. crisp hops at the end, some floral yeast in the background. feel is good, medium carbonation and a medium body, not filling, but not that light either. overall not a bad beer, but certainly not my favorite new summer offering this season.","StonedTrippin","May 05, 2012"

Crisp and clean grainy finish, but with an impressive 1-2 punch of Noble (grassy) and American (citrus). A great combination of quenching and flavorful, Summer Love is a standard setter in a generally weak style. Get some of this.","PDXHops","May 04, 2012"

The first sip and each subsequent taste was a delight. I love tasting the hops in a beer, and the mixture of hops and lemony-fruity-goodness in this particular libation was extremely satisfying.","JustinMann","Sep 29, 2011"

While it may have lost some of its crispness in translation, it definitely opened up the hop profile a bit more, with extra citrus flavors and a touch more aggressiveness shining through here. I canâ€™t really say if I liked this more than my experiences with the draft or bottled versions of this but Iâ€™m glad that I gave it a shot, as it ended up being flavorful and easy drinking enough to keep me happy on this visit.","Kegatron","Sep 28, 2011"

It seems as though it is dry hopped, I could be wrong but it has a nice cloudy look which is usually apparent in dry hopped beers. It is crisp, refreshing, a bit lemony. The thing with summer beers is a lot of time you lose the hops and just get the wheat. This is not a wheat beer but a summer ale. And it has a nice mellow hoppiness which is surprising. It must be the noble hops, I'm not sure but I could just stick my head mouth under the tap, open up and say ahhh! Especially on a hot humid summer night.

4.26,14.8,4,3,5,4,4.5,"I've never had a beer that goes better with a good burger. Despite the silly name this is a remarkably well wrought beer. The pour is a bright yellow with a little cloudiness revealing the unfiltered yeast. The head is white and becomes lacy in a few minutes. The aroma is a pretty subtle combination of lemony and herbal notes. But the taste is where this beer excels. The fine hops that are so prominent in Victory's Hop Devil are beautifully rounded off with malt and bread and a little lemon combination that is really satisfying and refreshing. The only problem with this blonde ale is that you have a hard time not having another as soon as your glass is empty.","dennarb","Aug 21, 2011"

Aroma consists of light sweet cereal with light floral undertones. Taste is also dominated by light floral notes with some refreshing cereal with a subtle hoppy finish. There were some light unrefined grain notes that were also perceptible as the beer warmed up which I wasnâ€™t too fond of. Body is about average with good carbonation.

Where most Golden Ales are listless, flawed, too chewy or with distracting side notes, this one is very drinkable. Nice hoppy flavor mid-taste. Light-to-medium body. Average carbonation. Clean finish. I really look forward to each sip. Solid work. I had not been a big fan of victory til now, but I think more of them after this offering.","chickenflea","Aug 18, 2011"

Nice head of white capped the top and settled down smoothly and evenly, creating a decent broken crown that ringed the side of the glass and kept some nice lacing. Aroma was light, and this would be a trend throughout the day. Light notes of peach and light grain are really all that is coming through right now.

Very nice looking. There is something weird happening in the nose. Something making me think I maybe got a bad bottle. there is a little bit of an odd maybe rubberband aroma masking some grainyness and a bit of herby hops. Kind of offputting, and making me not look forward to taking that first sip. After that aroma smacked me in the face, the flavor is surprisingly not that bad. Has a lot of herbey hops and nice grainy malt character. There is a very mild mirroring of that problem from the aroma, but it is not very present. The mouthfeel isn't overly light, which makes me suspect that this is not an infection, but it is a little bit astringent. Light medium body with ok carbonation. I really don't know what to make of this beer.

This blonde really demonstrates that a low abv beer can have a good amount of flavor, the hop presence adds the counter balance to the malt with a refreshing quality and light acidity which makes this quaffable and has a refreshing quality perfect for summer because it doesn't makes you sweat from high alcohol and this fits the style well, another high quality brew from Victory!","Slatetank","Jul 23, 2011"

The aroma of the beer was a little weaker than expected, but still good...some citrus hops mixed together with a bready component. The taste of the beer is of the quality that one would expect from this brewery, a nice strong flavor that follows the nose well. A nice does of fruitiness and bready malts. The beer was crisp, clean and very enjoyable as I sat on my back porch in the 100 degree heat of Georgia in the summer. The beer did finish with a light bitterness and I did feel that the beer was perhaps a bit over-carbonated, but it did not really detract from the enjoyment of the beer.

Very refreshing, with a nice hop kick. The mouthfeel is solid, it's well-carbonated and goes down easily. The drinkability is quite good, this one is really easy to drink.

3.7,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Little less than a finger of clean white foam, mostly smaller to medium sized bubbles, above average retention for what head is there, in turn the lacing is wispy but lingers in thin lines across the glass sides. Bright golden colored liquid with loose bubbles percolating throughout, light metallic reflective sheen, no real hue change at the rims or glass bottom. The nose is full of pepper, rye, pumpernickel and then dried flowers, dried oranges, lemongrass and a forgiving overall herbal bite, hints of apricot or peach fruit, while thereâ€™s no clear malty sweet element it doesnâ€™t seem one-sided. Medium-bodied, the carbonation has some serious churn to it and gives it more energy than creaminess. Lots of green matter, earth and twigs/bark while remaining quaffable and never bitter. Pepper and some cumin to coriander, the flowers and mixed white citrus too dry to soak in. Pear, peach, apricot fruit more skin and pit than juice. Unprocessed grains and wheat germ around. When itâ€™s ice cold it is thirst slaking and has the scrubbing power to remind you itâ€™s there with each sip.","farrago","Jul 21, 2011"

Not bad, not very memorable, glad I only bought a single.","VelvetExtract","Jul 18, 2011"
3.42,-7.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Overall--This, to me, is something along the lines of a "light IPA." It's simple, refreshing, and just different enough to stand out from other summer offerings. Unfortunately, the big hoppiness is just a bit distracting for a refreshing, simple summer beer, at least for my taste. (I will qualify this by saying that I generally prefer malty beers over hoppy ones.) Very much worth trying, just not a home run.","Kuromaru","Jul 17, 2011"
4.2,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer lives up to it's summertime name. Opposed to other beer that like to bog down their summer brews with honey and fruit this beer is crisp and refreshing, something you come to expect and want in an American Blonde. It looks smells and feels like summer. The tastes is nicely complemented by all of these, especially the carbonation. It tastes fresh with the right amount of hoppy tones. Just a classic summertime beer for the old open drink repeat ritual.","cbo2122","Jul 17, 2011"
3.7,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D - A pretty standard summer ale. The spice character is quite nice in the aroma but becomes dull and a bit stale tasting in the flavor profile.

Unlike most summer seasonals that lean on the sweet side or at least citrusy, this ale does very little to stray from a basic ale. In fact, I'd imagine in a taste test it would not taste all that much different from Victory Lager, one of their staples.

This is a very bold flavorful beer for such a low abv brew. Malts are slightly sweet and give balance to all the hops, almost like a wheat beer in its crispness. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated which is great for a hot Fourth of July Day.

I think the taste is just like the aroma, it's all sweet malt, lemon peel and pine/grassy hops. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's crisp and a bit slick with moderate carbonation. I think it's a decent enough brew, and a good brew for a hot day. I'd buy this again, $8.99 a sixer isn't a bad price for this brew. I think it's worth trying.","bluejacket74","Jul 02, 2011"

The flavor starts with the small pine then moves to a slight yeast/malt combo and finishes with a slight pine, but very refreshing taste.

Very faint touch of lactose type sweet upfront, but that quickly gave way to a hoppy bitterness. The bitter faded with time, but wasn't replaced with much of anything.

Tried many new beers over the weekend at the Penn Brewfest but this is one of the new beers I've seen in Pittsburgh at retail outlets that got me ready for Summer. It's an odd mix flavor wise traditional German hop profile with some Belgian spicy yeast notes.

It was a refreshing on a day that was too hot for me (high 80's). I can see myself drinking this at cookouts through the summer. Nothing spectacular, but not bad at all.","Axic10","Jul 10, 2010"
4.37,17.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,"I believe this beer is an excellent choice for those who enjoy some hoppiness in their beer, but are interested in a thirst quencher - crisp and refreshing. This is an excellent beer to enjoy on a warm summer night or kicking back at the beach!! I am not a huge fan of the color. The aroma is soothing and it had a nice lacing along the glass. I am sorry this is not offered through bottles!!","mtoniatt","Beers"
3.28,-11.6,3,2.5,3.5,3,4,"A special beer brewed in collaboration with Philadelphia "With Love" tourism board, is a pale ale made with german pale malt, and locally sourced water (duh). Summer Love was very pale in color almost blonde and had a nice tuft of foam on top. In appearance it could have passed for a pilsner, which is to say too pale for a pale ale. The smell is dominated mostly by grassy hops with a little tinge of lemon--there is a bit of sulfur in the aroma as the beer warms and a bit of cooked veggie. The taste was very nice and clean with light malt flavors, crisp hops and slightly citric finish. The beer was lighter in body than I would have liked, but was easy to drink and refreshing","Soonami","0"
