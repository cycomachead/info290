This is a C+ pale ale and not a standout at all when compared within that beer style, but taken as a macro I'm hard-pressed to come up with something more palatable... a B+ grade seems far more fair in that context but I'm not much of a curve grader.

3.25,8.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"355ml can from The Beer Store, purchased with my 'empty return' money. Pours a very clear yellow with one finger of white foam and sheets of lacing on the lager glass. Smell and taste are light adjunct grains, yeast, corn, mild metallic twang, fruity and floral hop extract, grassy sweetness, water, pale and possibly pilsner malts, crisp and subtle spiciness to end. Some funky off aromas develop while drinking but remain at tolerable levels. Mouth feel is crisp, clean, thinner than medium, nice snappy bite, grainy drying finish. Much more flavour and character than your typical macro beer, but still pretty plain and tasteless compared to most craft offerings. When fresh and at its best, 50 is a bright, serviceable fall-back that outshines its mainstream counterparts. However, unless you're in a dingy bar, there's no reason to buy this over superior micro options.","cratez","Aug 02, 2010"

The beer poured a translucent gold colour with a minimal white head, and a high amount of effervescence. The aroma was grainy malt and a surprising amount of hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was similar to the aroma with grainy malt and a surprising hoppish flavour.

Smell is good, smells very fresh, malt up front, with a citrusy smell in the back. This has a really smooth and crisp taste, malt up front, just like the smell and a crisp hot bitterness at the finish. Very full mouthfeel, very satisfying. This is a great beer to pound all night, something you can relax with, when cold it is easy to drink alot of this. This is labatt's answer to Molson's Export, and I think this is much much better, but unfortunately it is harder to find at bars. I highly recommend this one!","steeler","Nov 18, 2008"

Nothing really wrong here, but nothing outstanding either.","montageman","Nov 04, 2008"
2.76,-7.7,3,2,3,3,3,"Pours a three-fingered white head that quickly fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. No nose.

Surprisingly easy to drink. Starts a little sweet on the palate but finishes bitter. Down the middle. A little hops, a little malt. Lightly carbonated. Ok mouthfeel but very little body.

3.05,2,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Now this isn't a bad beer, but there's little resemblance to a typical APA. It's more of what I'd call a macro ale, as it reminds me a great deal of a macro lager. The taste is slight and sweet and the carbonation is a bit sharp. The flavor isn't bad when you pick it apart - husky grain and white bread with a sweet green apple note. There's even a hint of hops for balance, but this is closer to a blonde ale, than anything else I can think of in the ale category. On par with Genesee Cream Ale.","tempest","Jul 26, 2008"

Oh yeah and lacing is actually there evenly with each sip fine even and intricate on my chalice. Aroma contains an actual mild citrus and herbal toned hop profile with a minimal amount of cereal sweetness and mild perfume like accents. Flavor wise some residual honey like sweetness after the crisp light malt grain and adjuncts clear. Mineral water with a trace of citric and herbal hop kick just peaking through in the finish.

Smells somewhat malty, with adjuncts and DMS playing roles in the aroma as well. Tastes like biscuit malt with a small amount of American hops and adjunct flavor as well. Pretty drinkable, and more tasty than most macro-beers. Having said that, there are definitely better examples of the style with a lower price tag.

The beer's pretty mediocre. It's pale gold with a white head that goes away quickly. I smell a musty hop-like odor that I wouldn't say is a very good. It's not too horrible but not a great smell. Tastes like a typical macrobrew that's trying to sell something as being special. I don't know what ingredients I'm tasting here. Corn, rice, some stinky hops? The beer's OK.

4.02,34.4,3,3.5,4,4,5,"pours golden with a bit of head, much like any other macro. Smells sweet, but i get a sensation of hops which i find pleasant. Taste more or less like the smell, with a hint of hops rarely found in a macro. Mouthfeel is nice, not overpowering, but not to watery. The highlight of this beer is most certainly drinkablity. You could easily find yourself drinking one to many, and i have yet to find something that ""flows"" like a 50","dickieb","Feb 20, 2007"
2.71,-9.4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"I still haven't had what I would consider a good beer from Labatt. Canadian Ale might the best so far because it's actually drinkable in a 'gotta be cold' kind of way. Too bad it isn't as widely available south of the 49th parallel as is Labatt Blue. Not that it matters to me. I don't care if I ever drink either one of them again.","BuckeyeNation","Feb 04, 2007"
3.63,21.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Labatt Canadian Ale is, indeed, an ale. It was launched as ""Labatt 50"" in 1950, and was Canadas best-selling beer until 1979! It pours a deep golden color, and raises a finger-thick head of creamy white froth. The head retention is slightly better than average, and it leaves some nice lace about the glass. The nose is mainly malty, basic and sweetish, and there's a light touch of fruity yeastiness. It's medium bodied and gently crisp across the palate. The flavor offers a very well balanced combination of gently sweet malt, a mild yeasty fruitiness, and some leafy and mildly grassy hops. It's still a basic golden ale, but there's more to it than most golden lagers offer. It finishes dry with a drop of sweet maltiness that fades quickly, leaving behind a refreshing bitterness and some dull, lingering hops. An interesting and refreshing golden ale!","NeroFiddled","Dec 20, 2006"
4,33.8,4,4,4,4,4,"50 pours a light golden color with a white sticky head. Smell is slightly grainy and malty. Taste is sweet malt with a hint of hops. At $8 a 12 pack, you really can't beat it for the price. Labatt Canadian is definitely one of the best macros around, my favorite for sure.","ericj551","Dec 12, 2006"
3.4,13.7,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Poured in nonic glass achieving a surprising 2 finger head that collapsed but held its own down the glass, sticking/lacing. Straw colored with med. to high carbonation. Smell is slightly fruity. Flavor is grainy up front with medium bitterness, then slight fruit takes over and finishing with good hop bite. I get a little adjunct flavor near the end but not bad as some macro lagers/ales. Mouthfeel is average but good for a lighter ale. Seems to be a throw back that to me is very refreshing and satisfying. Pretty easy on the wallet, bought in the Detroit metro area for about $9.50 a 12 pack....","alehopman","Jul 09, 2006"

Tatse of somr amlt and with very distnict bitternes. It was very pleasent compared to other LaBatt brews Ive tried.

3.65,22.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours crystal clear pale gold. A one and a half finger head of dense bubbles shows decent retention and some spotty lacing. Aromas of pale malt and mild noble hops. Sweet munich and spicy pilsener malts make up a decent malt flavor, but the taste is still mild. Classic semi-dry german hops in the aftertaste are barely noticed in an otherwise clean finish. What it lacks in flavor, it makes up for with an excellent balance. Medium/low carbonation with a light body that combines with crisp malt profile for a smooth mouthfeel and good drinkability.","PBRstreetgang","Dec 13, 2005"

3.38,13,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This review is based on numerous bottled samples: This stuff is quite enjoyable. It's not as clean or smooth as Labatt Blue or the better Molsons, but it's more flavorful. Reminds me of the way my father's beer tasted in the 60's and 70's before just about all those old brands got watered down. The taste really settles in and makes sense if you happen to be smoking a cigarette at the time as well; not surprising given this was released to market in 1950, the latter part of the dear old Swing era. By no means the best available in today's beer market if you have the oof and can afford to sling it around a bit, but hard to beat at $18.50 a case (retail) in Worcester if you have to watch the decimals. That makes it a bit pricier than the standard US macros, but it's pronouncedly better than those, as well as a surprising number of more expensive brands (such as Corona, usually about $21 a case). A pleasant throwback, perfectly preserved after 55 years, and shrewdly priced to boot.","Rumpole","Feb 17, 2005"
3.4,13.7,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Drinkability: Underated. This brand exists since several decades and it used to be trendy long years ago. So, drink it in a nightclub will be you looking funny, but it is still a hidden gem in the current world of canadian macros.","Barraclou","Feb 14, 2005"
2.51,-16.1,3,2,2.5,2.5,3,"Decided to give this one a shot because of a $1.00 price tag for a single. I guess I got my moneys worth. Pours a clear golden color with mild bubbles. Medium thin white head and minimal lacing. The aroma is vaguely sweet with nothing really distinguishing itself. Light-bodied with a pretty bland flavor of mild hops and sweet corn. Luckily nothing offensive in there. The finish is crisp, dry and pretty much flavorless aside from the faintest hops bitterness. All said, it's a Labatt by any other name.","Dogbrick","Feb 07, 2005"
2.86,-4.3,3,2,3,3,3.5,"poured a straw yellow, not much head or retention, smell was almost non- existant, very little taste as well, lightly hopped, corn husk flavor, mouthfeel is thin and watery very carbonated, drinkability, is average at best, would make a nice lawnmower beer.","steinlifter","Feb 02, 2005"
3.18,6.4,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,3,"I tried this beer again after a couple of years and more experience. Honestly, I did not think it was so bad. A mildly hoppy and malty beer with high carbonation. A more rounded out maltiness and drier than Labatt Blue. A simple golden ale that is thirst quenching and non-offensive to the average beer drinker (which is mostly not a good thing). Recommended if your other option is a BMC or other Labatt product.","ahking","Jan 04, 2005"
2,-33.1,2,2,2,2,2,"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with almost no head. Aroma is very weak, almost non-existent. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt and light bitterness. Better then most crap that Labatt produce but this is still macro beer without taste. Im not even sure this one should qualify as American Pale Ale.","Phyl21ca","Dec 29, 2004"
3.05,2,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,3,"The best of the American Labatt's that you can get in my opinion. Medium to high carbonation, light bubbly head that is short lived. Golden yellow color that is typical of well made beers. This beer has more flavor that regular Labatt's and would be more to the liking of those who prefer a more complex beer. Flavors of malt and hops were most present. Overall, I see this beer as far over looked and highly underated. Worth a try if you have never had it.","Frozensoul327","Nov 12, 2004"
3.6,20.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a clean crisp scent that boasts of grainy pale malts, lager yeast, and some hops. The taste is decent also. It has a basic pale malt flavor along with a dry lager yeast finish. It goes down easy and finishes clean. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It has an above average makeup, but it goes down quick and easy.","WesWes","Sep 14, 2004"
2.63,-12,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Pours an unpromising translucent pale golden color, I've seen pilseners a deeper shade of gold than this. The head's pretty adequate, but the overall carbonation left is low and a few bubble streamers. Bready, grainy malts and a flickering of floral hops, but not much in either department, aroma-wise, corn is present in the aroma, too. Overall taste is rather subdued, white-bready and thin on the malt, and thin on the hops. Slightly crisp, but that's one of its only assets.","crookedhalo","Aug 17, 2004"
3.71,24.1,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Pours out a clear straw yellow with a light bright white head. Nice and smooth with a halfway decent malt profile. Crisp hop balance. Very light and drinkable. A macro ale if there ever was one, but a macro ale done right. Easy to drink and tastes good enough to enjoy. A good backup beer if only american and canadian macros are available at the beer store.","scottum","Aug 10, 2004"
2.93,-2,3,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Clear gold colour with a bright white head, which stuck around for a couple minutes and left light lacing on the glass. Very light aroma with some malt and a light hop character. Bitterness served as a base for the (light) flavour, and it carried through to the dry finish. Some malt sweetness at the beginning that didn't last long. Light bodied and fairly smooth. Not a bad thirst quencher.","DrJay","Jul 19, 2004"
3.12,4.3,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Labatt is as popular around here as snow. It's everywhere. But I don't come across the Canadian Ale too often. It's very pale amber colour with little head, if any at all is it's weakest point. Other than that. it's not a bad beer. A bit of a plain taste, but there are hints of earthy hops. As smooth as an ale can get.","CBFanWish","Mar 23, 2004"
2.13,-28.8,2.5,2,2,3,2,"Drinkability: Doesn't do much for me. In fact, I just assumed it was a pale lager and not a pale ale. It was an average lager, but makes for a wretched Pale Ale.","ManekiNeko","Jan 04, 2004"

2.81,-6,3,2,3,2.5,3.5,"A Canadian ale that is brewed like a lager leaving very little distinctive character. The beer looks like a typical Canandian lager in the glass, pale gold color with a wispy head. The aroma is corn sweetness and very faint fruit notes. The taste is clean, corn sweetness, and faded yeast flavors. Not distinctive at all. As are most Canadian beers, this is a very clean drinkable beer, but not much different than any of the other macros from Canada.","brakspear","Jun 01, 2003"
3.14,5,2,3,3.5,2,3.5,"This is quite drinkable, although the only remarkable quality about it is that it doesn't taste too bad. Compared with other macro-ales, this is a step above. Compared to some real ales, this is nothing. All in all, a decent Labatt offering.","Beastdog75","Apr 30, 2003"
2.51,-16.1,3,2,2.5,2.5,3,"If they say this is ""Canadian Ale", I guess this is it... eh? Tannish Gold in color with a rapidly dissipating head that lingers thin on the top and leaves a trail of wispy lace. Damp corncob, malt and alcohol aroma. Thin malt doughy body. Medium sharp-edged hops. Dry, with little in way of balancing sweetness. The alcohol is not hidden in the flavor. Drinkable.","BeerResearcher","Apr 22, 2003"

2.7,-9.7,2,2,2.5,3,4,"Straw light golden color with bright white head that receeds faster than the hairline of your uncle alan. Taste is dry and lacks any real punch of flavor. Heavy initial carbonation tickles tongue initially but fizzles down to moderate bubbling. Rather boring beer, yet might make a good hot weather summer session beer (for some reason I don't think they have summers hot enough to enjoy this beer in Canada though). For some reason I remeber it being much better. Its just dry and slightly veggie tasting...please give me something else. Its a shame but I don't know which is better this or blue.","allboutbierge","Feb 04, 2003"
2.33,-22.1,3,2.5,2.5,1.5,2,"One of the blandest ales I have ever tasted, though I can't be too harsh. This isn't a good beer, but it's not bad either. At best, below average. As usual, I drank this straight from the bottle. Smelled like a weak ale. Mildly hoppy and breadlike? Sort of like a bakery. Tasted like wet, whole wheat bread. My first bottle was a little skunky, but the rest so far are fine. Mild bitter finish, which adds to it's low drinkability rating. It's not too bitter, it's more that it just isn't a pleasant beer. Bought it in a Labatt Holiday mixer pack. Otherwise, wouldn't have bought it at all.","slitherySOB","Dec 29, 2002"

2.11,-29.4,3,2,2,2.5,2,"Crystal clear straw in hue topped by a thin, but sparse lace leaving head.  Sulfur hits the nose upfront, and is ensued by light cooked veggies and grain husk... this smells like a run of the mill megaswill.  It's relatively bland all around in flavor-- non - descript grainy flavors abound, but thankfully generic hop bitterness manages what would be overbearing flaked corn sweetness.  Hop flavor is virtually non - existant.  The finish is of yellow corn (where's my butter?) and a hint of bready grain.  Although Labett Canadian Ale isn't a bad brew, the high percentage of adjuncts compromise the malt profile.  This is reminescent of Genesee Cream Ale, but less clean.  My first and last.","marc77","Jul 15, 2002"
