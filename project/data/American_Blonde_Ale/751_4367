3.9,16.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 9/3/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, pear, wheat, cracker, biscuit, honey, coriander, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, pear, wheat, cracker, biscuit, honey, coriander, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, pear, wheat, cracker, biscuit, honey, coriander, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a goood malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected for 5%. Overall this is a very nice blonde ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 06, 2014"

I expected  more honey sweetness. Instead I got an adjunct lager taste honey hops and soap. Maybe I set my soaps, er...hopes too high. With that being said I'm sure it pairs with certain foods in a good way. As for the remainder, down the drain it goes. It served its purpose.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 20, 2014"

Nose is subtle honey and lightly sweet, pale malts. Slightly vegetal, and no apparent hops. Honey is apparent on the first sip, but is fleeting, a bit more than the minimun impression is left before the semi-sweet malts round out the palate, and a dryer, biscuity malt takes over. Nice and dry in the finish. Somewhat fruity and aromatic, with clover honey (just a guess) and apple blossoms. Aftertaste leaves an impression of peach, which is actually quite nice. The hops are there also, but very, very attenuated. Body is lighter and mothfeel is a little on the thin side, and the carbonation is reasonably easy-going, too. This is a nice, well-executed fruit-vegetable beer, and I'd say so especially if we were to consider it more of an amalgam of Golden Ale and Fruit Vegetable beer rather than an APA. For whatever reason this bottle is striking me as tastier and livelier than the last draght I had of the Summer Honey, so either the recipe has changed or it's less impressive on draught? Improves a bit asit warms, but no doubt goes down quite well on the cold side for some folks . . . is there a touch of wheat malt in this one?

The body is medium with a decidedly dextrinous edge, and it's crisp on the palate with a lightly bristling carbonation. The flavor is loaded with honey flavor and wheatish malt. Floral hop flavors and a bit of lemon zest help to round it out. It finishes surprisingly short and dry given the amount of flavor packed into each sip, and it lingers for a few moments with a combination of wheatish malt and floral hops as well as a very light touch of pine. Quite a nice summer ale! This one's perfect for a wide variety of events, and I could easily imagine enjoying this at a ball game, boating, a backyard BBQ, fishing trip, or cool evening on the porch. Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Oct 01, 2006"
3.12,-6.9,3,3.5,3,3,3,"There are too many amazing Big Sky beers I'd rather be having. Yes, this is better than any other refreshing lawnmowever macro beer due to its honey spiced flavor. But I just want to move on from this beer.","terrabyte","Aug 21, 2006"

4.02,20,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The smell brings strong honey flavor with some light flower scents. In the taste, pale malts start things off while honey takes over part way through and lasts through the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly light while drinkability is very high.","watermelonman","Jun 17, 2006"
3.28,-2.1,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Drinks okay. I prefer the crystal ale as a summer time libation. One of the better honey beers I've had, still a bit too sweet","russpowell","Jun 08, 2006"

3.6,7.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D- The sweetness of the honey was nice and the bitterness of the hops offered a nice balance. Most beers that add honey have some odd fermented honey flavors but this one wasn't bad.","rhoadsrage","Oct 06, 2005"
1.91,-43,3.5,2.5,1.5,2,1.5,"I came close to pouring this one down the sink. Its just too sweet, and the sweetness has some odd characteristics as well. It reminds me of the smell of over-aged beef. I can see how a lot of folks might like this beer, but I think Ill avoid this one in the future.","RJLarse","Sep 25, 2005"
3.33,-0.6,4.5,4,3,3,3,"Poured from bottle into pint glass a light transparent yellow color with 2 finger head and lots of carbonation. Smell is slightly sweet with grass/hay and hops scents coming through as well. Taste is pretty sweet like honey with a very light hoppy aftertaste. Nothing too special though. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, a little bit on the flat side. Overall this is a pretty decent summer ale that goes down easily.","loren01","Sep 14, 2005"
4.07,21.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"With Summer Honey Ale, Big Sky has demonstrated their brewing dexterity by keeping three balls named 'honey', 'hops' and 'spices' in the air at the same time. They've come up with an excellent summer cooler that I'd love to have access to when the hot weather rolls around.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 20, 2005"
4.3,28.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Looks like about 15,000 other beers, crystal clear gold colr, with a small white head that fades to almost nothing. Not a lot in the nose, but malt and honey sweetness, and a little spice. Taste is very nice for a honey ale. The honey is there, and makes the beer sweet, but enhances the malt flavor. Very light and crisp, the malt and honey are absolutely at perfect levels to each other. Good work Big Sky, you have made the best honey beer I have ever tasted.","TastyTaste","Aug 17, 2005"

4,19.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. Honey gold body. Nice, feathery off-white head. Thin lacing. Smell: gritty graininess, thin malt sweetness, slight hop earthiness -- nice. Taste: quick pinch of hop bitterness upfront, followed by a honey-like sweetness, hint of vanilla; dry finish with a nice toasty graininess. Mouthfeel: slick and clean, middling carbonation. Good summer brew.","RootedFool","Jul 13, 2005"
3.95,17.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I wasn't dissapointed....It is what its trying to be....a bit spicey yet sweet almost to the point of annoying but like george castanza's dad it pulls up short....nice, refreshing carbonation levels. I did this six pack in tonight and would like another, in my book thats some super drinkability. Far from a big beer, this is lawnmower material and it does what you think it will, refresh without boring you.","DogFood11","Jun 26, 2005"
3.97,18.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A nice summer seasonal that is quite drinkable. Seemed a bit more like a cream ale than an APA to me.","KoG","Jun 23, 2005"
4,19.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a vibrant, sparkling, golden yellow, with a coppery sheen. Tight-packed, persistent guaze-white head. Nice. Soft, tangy malt aromas underscore definite honey and some peppery spices--maybe coriander. Interesting and good. Peppery spices dot biscuity malt flavors up front. Light, honeyish sweetness gives way to an herbal, peppery bitterness. Soft mouthfeel on a medium body. I could swear there's some wheat in here. Nice summer ale that thankfully is not just another American pale wheat ale.","alexgash","Nov 08, 2004"
3.82,14,3,3.5,4,4,4,"It's pale gold with a big, creamy head. Good lacing. Looks like the kind of beer I want to drink after mowing the lawn. Doesn't smell too much, a little bit of spiciness, but tastes great. The scent is representative of the flavor, a very easy-drinking beer with a bit of spice. Excellent and refreshing on this particular day.","battlekow","Oct 02, 2004"

4.3,28.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pale and bisquit malt scent with some honey notes and a musty breadlike finish. The taste is excellent. It has a very smooth pale and bisquit malt flavor that is slightly sweet and very drinkable. It goes down easy and finishes spicey and breadlike. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine summer seasonal. It has real good flavor and aroma; a good drinker.","WesWes","May 02, 2004"
3.62,8.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a perfectly drinkable beer, though it's nothing fantastic. I'm just not a fan of honey beers. It was quite good at the price I got it at, but I'm not sure I'd seek it out and pay actual money for it.","woemad","Aug 24, 2003"

3.9,16.4,4,4,4,3,4,"Big Sky Brewing has done a great job with this light summer ale. Perfect for a hot day with both sweet tones and hop flavors. Color is just like honey. Not much head, even though it is over corbonated, which is why I gave it lower score on mouthfeel. The carbonation burn detracts from the flavor. So, I just swirl it a bit until the carbonation is released some. A bit pricey for a lighter beer, so I wait for it on sale.","Fabric8r","Jan 13, 2003"
4.42,31.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Light honey yellow in color with a small pencil width high head of even leveled, off-white, super tight, creamy foam. The head faded a little fast and has spotty lace. The aroma is very nice, very sugary with a touch of honey thats super fresh. Nice! Taste echoes the smell with a nice light sugary taste with sweet honey and a bit of hops showing up with a very slight lemon note that together keeps this nicely balanced and super smooth. Yum! Feel is a lighter to medium body, very clean, soft, and solidly smooth. This is some remarkable stuff, very unique, yummy, and very drinkable in my book. I think I have a new summer brew to add to my list, this summer honey of a brew by Big Sky is a must try.","tavernjef","Aug 17, 2002"

So far, the best honey beer I've had, though I haven't had them all (Dupont Biere de Miele, Young's Waggledance, where ARE you??. ) Bright honey flavor comes shining through. Light body, pleasant finsh, easy-drinking. Not much in the hop department, but that's not what they're going for. An excellent summertime refreshment!","feloniousmonk","Aug 07, 2002"

3.06,-8.7,2.5,4,2.5,3.5,3,"Clear yellow ochre color with a substandard head that's a trace after 20 seconds.  Bright aroma, trace of honey.  Off tastes (!), tap water with spicy impressions.  Stays medium-bodied to the swallow, but has some unsettling qualities in the esophagus.  There's a little mid-mouth interest in this brew, but it doesn't redeem the wandering finish of sweet/sour/weird to my tongue.  Big Sky Brewing is a real puzzler to me, high variation in quality in their brews.","ADR","Jul 21, 2002"
4.42,31.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This clear light golden brew throws out a medium white head with little retention.  Beautiful sweet clover honey is present on the nose with some light spicing perceived also (cinamon?).  This is really a nice tasting summer brew.  The honey is evident as well as some wheat malt it seems.  There's a nice little hop bite.  It's light to medium in body and glides over the tongue effortlessly.  There is also a very nice dryness present throughout the drink, but moreso on the finish.  One of my favorite quaffable summer beers.","Bighuge","Jul 03, 2002"

Fairly bland flavor.  The qualities that make the aroma pleasing don't transfer that well into the flavor.  Fairly dry over all.  Has a somewhat refreshing quality to it to make it an appropriate seasonal beer for summer. Somewhat full mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation.","garymuchow","Beers"
3.06,-8.7,4,3,3,3,3,"Nice gold-orange color, but unfortunately for me the beer quality did not match it's appearance.  Honey sweet with citrus undertones and a medium (leaning towards the light) bitterness.  Subtle hints of nuts.","jreitman","0"
