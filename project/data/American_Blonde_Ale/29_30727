Light in body, this blonde ale has a flavor of malted grain, some mild hop bitterness, warm grits , and red apples. Overall, this blonde ale isnt much to talk about, mass produced, seems its of higher quality then some of AB's mass produced lagers, but there are much better craft brewed blonde ales out there.

It's to be noted that the beer is dry-hopped, but Michelob doesn't note which hop variety - or varieties - are used. The taste is surprisingly malty given it's light hue. You get a lot of biscuity notes which are well balanced by the hops in the beer. The swallow of the beer is clean and very light, but some of the hop snap does linger a little further into the drink.","jmvecchio1","Jul 08, 2011"

4,36.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This was sampled from the tap at the Anheuser-Busch brewery in St. Louis, Missouri. Beach Bum Blonde Ale has a thick, creamy, off-white head and a bright, hazy yellow-orange color. Lots of lacing is left behind. The aroma is of citrus and hops, with lightly toasted malts as well. The taste is a delicious mix of malt breadiness and strong citrus, making one almost think it was flavored with juice, which it is not. Floral hoppiness is a pleasant note here at the end of the sip. The mouthfeel is light to medium, and Beach Bum finishes refreshing, crisp, and dry. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer, and I would like to have it again.","RonaldTheriot","Jun 08, 2011"

Moderate malt body with no distinction. Very mildly hopped, so as not to offend the casual beer drinker - enough to be present and then not much more. Finish was clean with a vague lingering bitterness. I would describe this as vanilla, but vanilla at least has a distinctive flavor. This is more aptly described as generic.","Brent","Jul 16, 2010"

Not really a presence at all, actually. Really disappointing. I was hoping to cleanse the memory of Landshark Lager from my taste buds. Sadly, this just added to the disappointment.

The mouthfeel was fine, medium body and generally refreshing. Just an easy going, non thinking entity, like the blonde surfer on the label.

On the palate, the flavors are well balanced, with brisk, straightforward bitterness first off, felt on the sides and back on the tongue, followed by a growing graininess through the mid-palate and culminating in a somewhat sweet finish with a flash of unripe pear at the very end, in the back of the throat. There are hops here for balance, but they don't add much in the way of flavor, aside from an airy taste at the beginning. Mouthfeel is light in malts and heavy on carbonation.

2.95,0.3,2.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Not great, a below average blonde. Too much of the malt is sugary grain, with no translation towards body or complexity of flavor.","BretSikkink","May 29, 2007"
3.72,26.5,3,3.5,4,3,4,"12oz bottle from Shaw's in Augusta. Light amber/dark yellow translucent body with a thin film of off-white head. Biscuit malt and European hops share the aroma, though the smell is far from overwhelming. Biscuit malt dominates the flavor with a hint of hops toward the finish. Rather watery on the mouthfeel, which helps the drinkability. Nothing overpowering or overly impressive, but a decent easy-drinking summer beer.","MrHurmateeowish","May 29, 2007"
3.67,24.8,3,3.5,4,2.5,4,"This is a mighty quenching brew! It's got hops, man those things smell good! It even has some backbone with the malt. I'd have to say it's almost the blonde ale that strove to be a pale ale (except for the brightness). This is a great beer, for the $6.99 for the 6pk I got it for it's a good deal (being that the same place has Sam Adams and it's ilk for about $8). I'm sure that at $5.99 this beer is a steal.","uncggop06","May 27, 2007"
3.55,20.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Looks like AB is intimidated by the micro brew market, so they are selling their own. It is obvious that AB will never go over the top on a beer, since they aim to make beer tasteless for the masses. This is a decent beer, but could potentially be better. I taste a little bit of sourness, and smell it as well. It claims to be all malt, and that probably makes it better than their rice beers. Slight citrusy flavor from orange, and not a bad summer session beer overall. Would probably go well with a burger from the grill.","zymurgy4all","May 26, 2007"
3.82,29.9,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Saw this at a beer tent and had never heard of it before. I normally shy away from AB products but figured I would give it a shot. Poured was a pale golden yellow with a huge white head. The smell was actually ok, with hints of some fruitiness in there and a slight grainey toned. The flavor was actually, quite suprisingly good. This was not bad at all. Lots of light fruit with a big carbonated feel. Really a decent session beer and I was quite suprised by how good this actually turned up. AB may actually have something worth drinking here, will have to give it another try before I commit totally, but really not bad.","mikesgroove","May 23, 2007"

Grainy malts and light hops noted as well. Wisks of citrus flavorings, coupled with a touch of adjunct-like tastings.

Really, there are hops here. I am very surprised.","DaPeculierDane","Sep 12, 2006"

Mild vinous nose, a pinch of wheat and hints of pilsener malt- clean overall. Crisp pilsener malt upfront, slightly sweet. Dry white wine bite- pleasently acidic with mild but balanced german hop bitterness. Hoppy aftertaste like cascade with some mild rice flavor. High carbonation and light bodied- the crispness prevents the dry wine taste from overwhelming and it finishes mildy vinous with american hop notes. A very drinkable summer beer with a mellow but interesting character.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 05, 2006"

My pint was yellow in color, clear and had a small head and had a slightly citrus/floral aroma. I thought the flavor was a little on the weak side, not really a blonde that stands out. There was a mild hop flavor and a touch of citrus with general sweetness throughout. Overall, I'd say find a different blonde if that is your thing...","sockeye101","Aug 22, 2006"

However, I had it on tap on the deck of a bar in St. SimonÂ’s Island, on a 90 degree summer night, and must say I was pleasantly surprised by this summer brew. Poured to a golden orange with medium, off-white head and okay lacing. There was a slight citrus aroma, mostly grapefruit and lemons, which were more evident in the taste. The palate was smooth and long, and actually reminded me of a mild version of an IPA. Not a bad beer.","kimcgolf","Aug 17, 2006"

Bright clear yellow color with a thick foamy head that dissipates quickly and leaves no remnants of its being there. Aroma is somewhat spicy, almost tangy (like the juice) with a straight pale malt dryness. Taste is similar to aroma. I noticed an adjunct flavor that didn't dominate but it didn't leave the palate either. Slight spice and tang with a cereal like aspect. A bit muddled really and although not sweet, it seemed cloying by the end of the glass. Odd, not really enjoyable.","granger10","Jul 10, 2006"

There was also a lot of carbonation, ala MHL.","ArcTeryx","Jul 03, 2006"

It poured a light strawish yellow that was perfectly transcendent. Smelled very sweet and citrusy. Tasted far to lame and was a rather unenjoyable beer. While it did not taste bad it sinply did not taste unique or fun or complex. It was just straight up boring.","ryantupy","Jun 29, 2006"

Big citrus kick in the middle and finish tastes like orange peel and orange juice and itÂ’s fairly well hopped flavor wise for the style and especially for a Bud product.

I think the yeast they use in these special bud releases is not right the beer is ok with a decent depth of malt character and a little fruity esters but there is also some off that is bothersome.

The aroma is purely of wet grain hulls. Tastes lightly lemony above the adjuct grain flavors. Vegetal and apples also decorate the banal flavors. Feels astingent in the jaws from a lemon rind and stressed grain flavors. Finishes with a fleeting hurry except for the bite-ey hook-up in the back of the thoat.
